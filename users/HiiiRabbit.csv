FuckYouKaren,ff78xdh,t1_ff6mdwl,1579643453.0,I grew up in a very different culture than US and there it is a common courtesy to get up for a woman out of respect.
FuckYouKaren,ff78nyi,t1_ff77ohp,1579643304.0,"Yeah but honestly I don't expect it from where I live. I live in Pacific Northwest and rarely will see guys getting up from their seat. I feel like maybe they just weren't raised that way, which I can't blame them. I didn't post on here to ""brag"" but rather post an opinion of ""non-Karen"" because I found this meme pretty corny"

I'm young enough where I can stand on the bus, honestly I'd probably give up my seat for half the people who commenting on here because they clearly need it more than me."

FuckYouKaren,ff75cp8,t1_ff70tkg,1579641438.0,"Yup. Raised the same way, but according to people on here I must be begging for pussy by doing so. Which is weird because I do the same for older man than me. Weird right?"
FuckYouKaren,ff7587x,t1_ff6970w,1579641368.0,"Look like I already stated, I come from a different culture. Different country. Where it's part of etiquette to get up for somebody older (man or woman) or woman.

Edit: lol at the cornballs who say I do for pussy or some shit, big surprise I do the same for men who are older than me. I was raised outside of US where that's common etiquette for men to do so. I'm not saying you need to do the same. Calm the fuck down."
DCcomics,ff5hn4n,t1_ff5hhtb,1579593290.0,I just don't have high hopes for anything that has anything to do with CW. I've been waiting to watch the Crisis crossover episodes and I can't even bring myself up to watching it.

nutrition,ff5agts,t1_ff47jlh,1579585207.0,"You literally said ""single most important thing"" 
So a person who's healthy weight is 150 lbs but they do drugs, lack exercise and eat junk is healthier than somebody at 160 lbs that's active, eats healthier and doesn't do drugs."

nutrition,ff45pei,t1_ff44wyu,1579556113.0,"Lol you sound very angry üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
Did I say to completely ignore BMI? I just for clarity to what they use as ""healthy weight"". The person says that your weight is THE MOST important aspect of your health. Where I stated that too many of other factors play just as important of a role. Your lifestyle will likely play a bigger role than just looking at your weight. I'm higher on weight than I have been when I was 20 but I also live 100x better and healthier lifestyle now. 
Just because I had less weight on me doesn't mean I was healthier. I'm planning to go back to that weight but this time it takes a lot more work and discipline than ever before. I was skinnier because I was a smoker and killed my appetite. So I wouldn't eat as much it doesn't mean I was healthier than I am now."
nutrition,ff42aiv,t1_ff41pmk,1579553988.0,"Exactly, I think people also don't understand that it's a lot about how much of carbs you eat and what kind of food you eating. What is your level of activity for that day. Like yeah if you consume a lot of food and sit on the coach that's one thing but if you eating then playing a game of football for 3 hours. Guess what? You gonna need some carbs!"
nutrition,ff41kz4,t1_ff2zbxt,1579553548.0,Meanwhile most athletes consume large amount of carbs as pregame meals üòÇ
nutrition,ff41evk,t1_ff3fhed,1579553443.0,"What's healthy weight? Are you basing it on BMI? Because you can be ""overweight"" but that would be more because of your muscle mass. 
Being in the ""healthy weight"" category won't mean that you're healthy. You're saying ""it's the most important thing"". 
You can be unhealthy and still maintain the weight. I was in the ""healthy weight"" when I was a smoker and have gained weight after dropping the habit. Are you going to say me gaining those 10 pounds is more harmful than being a smoker?  
Maintaining your health goes beyond single factors like your weight. Physical activity, proper diet and mental health are all just important imo."

Jim was there building their future. Because let's face it DM was one bad day away from getting shut down. Multiple branches were closed down, they both could have lost their jobs and she had nothing to fall back on. She applied at Walmart and didn't get a call back. 

She wanted to stay at Scranton doing same work she was very comfortable with, Jim wanted to grow. 

He should've stayed with Karen."

NYGiants,fdo4din,t1_fdo3qe0,1578598678.0,"My problem with Shurmur wasn't that we weren't winning it was his complete inability to adjust to the game. He made poor play calls time and time again. 
He didn't utilize the talent of players that we had. Maybe if he stayed as a OC he would have been better but he was way over his head being a HC."
NYGiants,fdo470d,t3_emdeab,1578598583.0,"He comes off as a very straight to the point guy. Articulates his goals and vision very clearly. The fact that he had some teaching background only makes me happier. 
He doesn't want to be a OC, DC or ST, he wants to work with everyone and be the actual head coach. I truly believe he will work very well with DJ and SB.
