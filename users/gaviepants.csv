dogpictures,fcwhdzq,t3_ej7fjk,1578025675.0,"Dogs teach us the most important thing a human could ever know, to know what love is. Some are here for a short time, and other a bit longer, but it's never long enough. In that time they love us with all thier might, unconditionally and without any reservation. When we lose that love, it comes at a great cost to our hearts. The best we can do is love them back with the same intent as I'm sure you did. I am sorry for your loss and your pain, it can not be measured and should not be contained. It's ok to grieve, it's ok to cry. A part of you is now in heaven with them. Much love to you friend."
