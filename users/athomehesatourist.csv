Hamilton and Baltimore are smaller, industrial, port cities that are gritty and have seen better days. While DC and Toronto are much larger, institutional/govt centers, with a largely white-collar work force in media, education, and professional services."

Kubischek and his government moved the capital to Brasilia in 1960 to be more centrally located within the country, to separate the function of government from that of the country’s business hubs, and to have an urban design that reflected Brazil’s strength and prestige in the post-colonial era. I don’t know what propaganda you’ve been force-fed, but it’s sad that you can’t see a beautiful building for all the phony cultural subtext you’ve digested."

I’ll concede there was a lot of blame to go around for the subprime mortgage bubble and housing market crash, but there were a lot more factors that went into the 2008 recession. The White House and Republican-led Congress dawdled on domestic issues for six years and did nothing to prevent that economic collapse."
