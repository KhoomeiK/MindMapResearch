depression,fejkfzx,t3_epibdv,1579177878.0,"""Reality? You told you of reality? The entire world is governed by the reasoning of dirty minded adults. We're able to obscure reality according to our obsessions. We are never shown what reality is."""

Anyway Happy birthday!"
depression,fejizhu,t1_fejilvy,1579176303.0,"Thing about depression is in 90% cases when you fall into it then someone starts to depend on you, you depend on them depending on you as a way to escape/deal with it and 100% of the time that gets mistaken for feelings of love and you are convinced that it's love.

I know you said you got depressed because of being rejected but that'd just reinforce it more from a logical point."
depression,fejh5rd,t3_ephq3m,1579174032.0,"This is the nearly the exact same wording as someone else posted an hour ago lol. So I'm just gonna copy paste my comment from there:

It is human nature that when you get to a certain threshold of doing something without any non-expected acknowledgement or reward, you give up or find reasons to no longer do that something. 

If you feel all your interactions are just the same typical everyday, standard expected thing then you have reached this threshold."
depression,fejgz66,t3_ephxpg,1579173791.0,"Sounds like it's more of a dependence on her depending on you more then love. Similiar to what I've experienced except the girl flat out used me as a tool near the end yet I ""think"" I still love her but when I think about it it's the times where she came to me for help that come to mind fastest.

If it is that then there's nothing you can do other then just accept that you ""love"" her yet there's nothing you can do for her."
