I wouldn’t stick around for that unless I REALLY loved the person doing that to me."

I’m very slightly less than you, on all points, but just barely."
sex,ff0a9x5,t3_eqs5nw,1579466871.0,"I don’t know how much comfort I can offer, but I can at least commiserate.

One of my best friends, really my mentor and the person who besides my parents easily had the biggest impact on who I became as I grew up, killed himself last August. By that time we only corresponded infrequently and he lived in a different part of the country, and so I only found out on Thanksgiving.

It’s awful. So unbelievably awful. But overtime it has gotten more bearable. I’ve gone whole days now without thinking about it, and when I do it doesn’t hurt quite as much.

I had always thought it would be him mourning me one day after I killed myself. Quite shocking to me that it’s the reverse.

But I can take comfort in what a hugely positive impact he had on my life, and in the positive impact I know I had on his.

This is super niche and silly, but I’m a huge history nerd and have always loved this line from a letter Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of five sons who died in the civil war:

“[I hope this will] leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.”

I also hope that you are only left with happy memories of this person, and a “solemn pride” in having to bear the loss of such an impactful person on your life."
sex,feyztyt,t1_fewkja0,1579452519.0,"Absolutely. The first few (or maybe several haha) times I had sex, I was very quiet. The idea of being vocal was quite embarrassing to me. The first time I found a partner with whom I was really comfortable to experiment with (that is, a long term partner rather than a month or two long fwb situation), I started to open up and WOW, such a huge improvement."
sex,few6qnh,t3_eqoynq,1579406091.0,"As a straight guy, I’ve found that the sort of “performative” aspects of sex were never just on the part of my partners. I’ve always tried to play up and lean into my feelings of pleasure by vocalizing them, more so than if I was with myself. Do I moan a lot when I masturbate? No, not really. Did I moan a lot when I was having sex? Hell yeah. I imagine this was largely true of my partners and it in no way diminished the fun of it, if anything it enhanced it."
PoliticalCompass,fevusfa,t3_eqpuko,1579401785.0,"So...as much as I love these kinds of visualizations, I think it’s worth keeping in mind that at the end of the day they are just shorthand, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel.

Maybe do some reading on various ideologies within this ballpark (social democracy, democratic socialism, liberal socialism, etc.) and see which one most appeals to you."
PoliticalCompass,fevtgov,t1_feuoisb,1579401274.0,"I mean, I don’t wanna overstate anything, but the times they are a changin. I’m a card carrying member of the first generation of the US to be born after the fall of the Soviet Union (I was born in 1993), and I’m sensing much less antipathy towards traditionally left wing ideas in that generation than in previous ones (at least in terms of percent of the population receptive to those ideas). Socialism and Marxism are of course a part, probably the biggest part, of that change (again, in terms of number of adherents), but adjacent left wing ideas are also starting to get a fresh reading, or at least a fresh-er reading.

I personally find some kind of anarchist leaning...something very interesting. I’ve been reading a bit on syndicalism recently, but I am not at all well versed enough on any of this stuff to plant my flag firmly in any one camp."

PoliticalCompass,fetqfeg,t1_fet8nfq,1579378380.0,"I should have read all the comments before I also suggested “The Conquest of Bread” haha. Probably best read as a foundational text rather than a comprehensive modern analysis, sort of what “The Origin of Species” is to modern biology."
PoliticalCompass,fetq31p,t3_eqij79,1579378244.0,"So, I’m always recommending people listen to this podcast, but Mike Duncan’s show Revolutions covers various political revolutions throughout history, and he is currently (taking his sweet time) covering the Russian Revolution.

In it, he starts by exploring the ideological history and framework of the various factions that vied for power in 1917 Russia, including of course the Bolsheviks (who espoused a version of Marxism), but also several of the liberal and, to your question, anarchist factions that were caught up in that mess.

Episodes 10.5 and 10.6 (“The Adventures of Mikhail Bakunin” and “True Liberty, True Equality, and True Fraternity) specifically cover the theories of one of the earliest “anarcho-communists” (I think technically he described himself as an “anarcho-collectivist,” but close enough for your purposes) who gained a lot of influence and a large following. It’s a really great introduction to those ideas, essentially that society should be run as a series of small, autonomous societies where wealth and resources are held collectively, but there is no “state,” and these societies would only be loosely connected by trade and culture, but have no political power over one another. “Political” leaders, such as they are, would have purely administrative and advisory powers, though the details of how this would work are...well, they are debated to this day. But in general, society is based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation, rather than coercion and hierarchies.

Also, “the conquest of bread” by Pyotr Kropotkin is arguably the foundational text of anarcho-communism, though I must admit I haven’t read it all the way through myself yet, just excerpts in school."
AskReddit,feto8ly,t3_eqfgfg,1579377524.0,"So...not exactly answering your question, but:

I first saw Pulp Fiction when I was 14, before I had seen a thousand movies. The way all the story lines tie together, and the timeline becomes crystal clear after 2 and a half hours of not really knowing what the chronology of the scenes were, blew me away.

For now, I think I’m gonna stick around here and see what else there is, since death is coming eventually.

Thanks for the kind words. I’m rooting for you as well. It’s a mix of things that have kept me here so far: existential fear of oblivion combined with evolutionary aversion to death; curiosity in what’s to come next; a hope that maybe there is some future joy to be had (which has occasionally, though not necessarily usually, proven true); and perhaps a healthy dose of spite at life itself."

There was a rule at his school that girls had to wear skirts starting in the spring, pants they could only wear in the winter. Well, one random April day it was particularly cold, and so one girl wore pants to school. She was told to change and refused, so was sent home. The next day every girl in school wore pants. That was the end of that rule.

Also, much less awesome but for myself: I for awhile refused to say the pledge of allegiance, just because I thought (and still think) kids shouldn’t be required to swear allegiance to a flag every day while at school. Also, you know...”under god”? Come on. It was starting to become an issue, so I caved but in my own way. Each morning when the pledge started I would jump to my feet and stand at rigid attention, and then say the pledge with everyone but *really* loudly and *really* hamming it up. Then, when it was over, I would finish by saying AMEN! They could make me do it, but they couldn’t make me not do it how I wanted."

I’m leaving the politics job. Thing is, I love talking about politics, so thought that would be a good fit. The grind was worse than I thought it would be. Similar thing has happened with every job I’ve tried. I loved being a camper and later camp counselor as a teenager, maybe I’d be good returning there and running the counselor-in-training program I was once in. Nope, turns out I hate working with kids and just liked working there with my old friends, all of whom had moved on. I love history, maybe I could be a teacher, maybe that one bad summer at camp was a fluke? Nope. I love politics and...well. With shitty jobs in between that all end with me quitting in a huff. I sure as shit wouldn’t hire me if I knew the details of my work history.

SuicideWatch,fdy7gtk,t3_enamkj,1578776890.0,"I don’t know your specific situation, but I have been a 14 year old guy with suicidal thoughts. The “it gets better” routine is at best hollow and forced and at worst deceptive, so I won’t give you that line. I will however, tell you three things:

1) A lot of us have been there. More so, I have been there. I can remember being 13 or 14 standing in my parents’ kitchen holding a knife to my throat. Never did anything closer than that, but man I stood at that precipice wondering if I should end it all so many times. I won’t say “it gets better,” although it may very well, in fact it probably will. But it will definitely get more tolerable. The misery and the loneliness are in many ways more overwhelming when you are younger because those feelings are *relatively* new. Over time they will start to hurt less, and you will develop your own coping mechanisms.

2) don’t ever believe that your feelings of happiness or sadness, or hope or despair, are ever invalid. No matter what the external situation, your feelings are your feelings, and no one can dictate them to you.

3) to quote from, of all things, dragon ball z abridged (which if you haven’t seen is hilarious and all on YouTube and I highly recommend), “you are so much stronger than you think you are.” You’ve made it this far. You’ve conquered many obstacles in your life, even if I don’t know exactly what those are, you do. And you can conquer these ones."

SuicideWatch,fdws9it,t1_fdsgubx,1578761885.0,"“The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.”

That’s a line from Andrew Solomon, and it rings so true on so many levels. I really do think when I’m in this way that fatalism is nothing less than wisdom and hope nothing more than naïvety. It’s impossible for me to judge whether this outlook is the one that is an illusion, or whether when my depression lifts and I feel more positive and less fatalistic is the real illusion. But I do know for certain that depression saps all energy and verve out of me. The best part of yesterday was when I was in my car, alone, sobbing and screaming to myself, because at least I felt SOMETHING.

I know I haven’t tried everything to get better, and that I probably can get better someday. But right now it feels like I have tried everything, and that I’ll never be better. That I’ll always be some version of a miserable depressed failure.

I sometimes have taken comfort in that poem “Invictus,” the one that ends with “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.” But right now even that rings false. The one out I’ve always kept as a backup plan is that at least I can end my life on my own terms if I choose to.

For the record, as a 26 year old, in my experience birthdays in your twenties suck, even if your life otherwise is doing pretty well. So even if you’re down in the dumps right now, I wouldn’t overly concern myself with FOMO. The last halfway entertaining birthday I had was my 21st, and that was just because my roommate got me a birthday present of a six pack with a drawing of me he had made passed out on the bag, which was pretty funny.

Maybe The only person that I want to talk to right now is my ex, whom I’m on good terms with. But one of the reasons we broke up was because our depression tended to amplify together, rather than help each other, and we both ended up leaning on one another too much.

AdviceAnimals,fcxtg7k,t1_fcxnmro,1578070187.0,"Sure, in theory, but I would hardly call things like Korea, or Vietnam, or the gulf war, or the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan “limited” or “narrow” in scope. Not even commenting on the morality of the issue or how worth it those conflicts were, the US congress has declared several wars that I would consider immoral and/or not worth it. Simply talking about scale here. 600,000-700,000 killed in Korea (45,000 of them Americans) in three years, 2 million to 3 million killed in Vietnam (58,000 of them Americans) in 15-20 years. These are not small interventions with specific and limited objectives, these are WARS.

At a certain point, war is war, and Congress has been abdicating their responsibility on that for decades as most of the last several presidents have usurped that responsibility.

Also, just to clarify, the AUMF was a resolution passed by the Congress in 2001 specifically in response to the 9/11 attacks. That terminology didn’t exist for Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, etc., although the basic sentiment certainly did.

AdviceAnimals,fcxklko,t3_ejfih3,1578065215.0,"Wanna make it even more confusing? The last time the United States of America formally declared war on another country was on June 5, 1942 (for the record that was against Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, allies of Nazi Germany at the time). Every war since then - Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan, to say nothing of the literally dozens of relatively smaller interventions in various other countries in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia - has technically not been a war at all. According to the constitution, the power to declare war is vested solely in the Congress. But since they haven’t done that since 1942, all subsequent military operations by the US have been approved and carried out solely by the President and his subordinates.

Which is, not to be controversial or anything, one of the most horrific perversions of the Constitution and the idea of representative government currently going on right now, and that’s saying a lot."
SuicideWatch,fcxi1lp,t3_ejfkg5,1578063445.0,"So, first off, I’d love to share a piece of advice that applies not only to this situation, but to basically any situation wherein you’re having a conversation with someone in distress (for the record, getting this quote by way of author John Green): “don’t just say something, stand there.”

Which is to say, often times the best thing you can do for someone in a situation of this kind is not to offer concrete advice (at least not right away), but to simply listen to their concerns and feelings and demonstrate your care and sympathy towards them. Often times, in the depths of emotional distress, the first thing people need is not advice on what to do about it but simply the feeling that they are being listened to and understood. Advice can come later, when the person is better able to act on that advice. But before that, not feeling quite so alone can help them feel better to the point where they can start taking concrete steps.

More specifically, I would say two things: first, if you at all detect any signs of real/imminent danger to your girlfriend’s safety, then get help as soon as you can from someone you (and hopefully they) trust. Sometimes that means calling emergency services, but I would only do that if the imminent danger is really QUITE imminent. More likely though you should reach out to a friend or colleague or older adult figure who can help you monitor your girlfriend’s safety in the short term, while helping you to find her more sustainable mental health help in the long term.

Second, assuming that her physical safety is not in danger, but her mental health and stability are still compromised, do your best to listen to her and be there for her whenever she needs it and whenever you can. But also, involve other people (particularly her other friends) in this process as well. You don’t want to be in a situation where you become the only person she can talk to about these things and where her mental health is dependent solely on you. That’s neither good for you nor for her. Maybe encourage her to see a therapist, try to host small gatherings of her friends and her together where social pressure on her is minimized and care and understanding for her is maximized. Watch a funny movie with her.

That all said, the fact that you are expressing this level of concern means that you’re head is in the right place. At the end of the day, use your common sense, and things should be ok. For the record, having suicidal thoughts does not in any way guarantee suicidal behavior. I, for one, have struggled with pretty debilitating depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 11, so for about 15 years, and I’ve yet to make a single attempt. Hang in there."
