AskReddit,ffg0yr8,t3_etbrdf,1579896093.0,"My cat comes when I call her name no matter where she is in the house. 

Also, my first pet, who was a hamster, when I put my hand in his cage, he'd grab it with his paws and flip it over so my palm was facing down and then climb onto the top of my hand and wait for me to lift him out. His name was Bubz."

AskReddit,fek5q1e,t1_fej4cer,1579193163.0,I'm so sorry. How awful. I hope you're getting the help you need. I'm sure it hurts emotionally as well as physically. I honestly can't imagine.
AskReddit,fek5cn1,t3_epfjje,1579192943.0,"Probably childbirth. It wasn't super long. Nine hours all together. I had no drugs except for the gas. But the part that was really bad was having to push for four of the nine hours. For reference, most women push for fifteen minutes to two hours. I know Carol Burnette once described childbirth as like pulling your bottom lip over your head. That is an apt comparison, I'd say."
AskReddit,feioclt,t3_eoyn3a,1579143224.0,That last push that pushes the baby out completely. It's like taking the biggest crap of your life.

So if I put the receipt aside and don't get a chance to enter it, it'll pop up automatically and I can categorize and approve it then. I love scheduled transactions. I use it for bills."
