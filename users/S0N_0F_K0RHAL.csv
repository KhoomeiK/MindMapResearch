ReformedHumor,ffa0wdq,t1_ff8z9gv,1579725642.0,Yeah I’m a Southern Baptist that holds to the 1689. I used to clash with my professors from time to time when they explained the “Baptist” view of the Lord’s Supper.

progun,ff47fi5,t1_ff43dyi,1579557185.0,"All those laws mentioned are pretty far already if you ask me.

We’ve already seen people die from these red flag laws."
progun,ff478g4,t1_ff465y0,1579557063.0,">One person was arrested with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. A 21-year-old woman was arrested and charged after having been warned two times not to wear a bandana over her face and then arrested when an officer saw her wearing it a third time, police said.

Seems to be the only arrest mentioned. That 21-year-old woman must have been very intimidating to receive a felony account for wearing a bandana."

So I would go to addictinggames, click a link to shockarcade, click a link to a funny videos, click a link to pictures of girls in bikinis, then click a link to full on porn."

todayilearned,fenauau,t1_fen73q2,1579280722.0,"I actually do pronounce the T in mountain, maybe that’s just easier for me to do? I can pronounce the t in cotton if I slow down and separate it like co-ton, but that sounds worse."
todayilearned,fen3753,t1_fen1rb0,1579275961.0,"Maybe she’s on crack then. She does point out other things I say like “fixna” (fixing to), but I knew that was probably a regional thing."
todayilearned,femzykl,t1_femxjsk,1579273862.0,"Ok good. I pronounce water with a D and I was afraid I sound silly not being anywhere near philly. I actually do have problems pronouncing my Ts in the middle of words, like cotton."

justneckbeardthings,fdqlqi1,t1_fdqi0bx,1578669682.0,"I heard a no sleep podcast that was basically this premise. Guy had a waifu pillow he bought from Australia. It had a heartbeat. He’d hump the pillow every night and the heartbeat would get louder. He was convinced his waifu was coming to life. Then he noticed a tear, opened it up, and millions of baby spiders spilled out onto him, with a large Australian spider in the center by the heart."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdnehq6,t1_fdn56vk,1578584086.0,"I’m a Southern Baptist and love this song because it shows how shallow most Christian worship is on the radio.

Edit: I wish I could find it right now, but I read a very insightful article from a Christian music insider who was an atheist. They explained that in the industry they are told to write songs for “Becky” (or Susan, I don’t remember the name they used exactly). Becky is a stressed out soccer mom with a husband who doesn’t pay attention to her, and just wants to listen to music in her minivan that makes her feel good. It should be clean so the kids can listen to it, needs to convince her that she’s amazing and wanted, and, oh yeah, sprinkle Jesus in there too."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fdebte2,t1_fdeazs3,1578335594.0,"It’s Reddit. Those odds probably aren’t exactly 50/50

Edit: [Found some stats](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261765/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-reddit-by-gender/). Looks like the odds are 2:1 male."
AskReddit,fdc0s1m,t1_fdabpy8,1578264897.0,That reminds me of the one recently that asked who they thought the sexiest actor/actress was and everyone answered Danny Devito. Danny Devito circlejerk threads are becoming more and more common though.

agedlikemilk,fbzhis5,t1_fbzgunl,1577246885.0,I can kinda see that for Biden. He seems to space out at times.
