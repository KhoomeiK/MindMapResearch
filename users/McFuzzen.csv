I have two very young kids (one is a baby). This Friday I am abandoning my wife and kids to get shitfaced and play poker with the guys. AITA?

Every day I wake up, go to work, come home, finish dinner my wife started, eat, clean up dinner, play with the kids, send them to bed, then get an hour or so to ourselves before doing the same.

I don't blame OP one bit for sending their kid to bed at a reasonable hour so they can have fun with friends. The kid is 6, she probably will never know the difference.
