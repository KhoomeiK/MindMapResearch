bipolar,fdhiuaq,t1_fdh8hyx,1578423564.0,"Makes me feel better that I'm not the only one who struggles to make it to an interview. I feel guilty every time I fill out an application. Thinking to myself ""trust me I'm a trainwreck, you don't want to hire me"" blah."
bipolar,fdhe397,t1_fdhdpua,1578420717.0,"Sorry to hear you experienced that. I think it's extremely common for ""us"" to be completely misjudged. In some confusing way, the only people who make me feel ""sane"" are those in this community."
bipolar,fdhc1dg,t1_fdgxc0k,1578419697.0,"""We don't work that way""
Ugh. The reality of this is so fucking frustrating. But this is the honesty and support I need to hear, having been told I'm just a childish cunt for the past 2 years who needs to grow up and control herself.
If only it were that easy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
bipolar,fdgxbic,t1_fde0ayx,1578410623.0,"I tried almost everything there was at the time. Latuda, Vraylar, Lamictal, Trintellix, so many more I can't even remember. 

I honestly think my doctor just wanted to see how newer meds affected her patients. I was on 6 things daily at one point. She also changed her diagnosis from BP II to I and haven't seen anyone in 2 years so who the hell knows now, way more severe than it's ever been."
bipolar,fdgwo4e,t3_elbrad,1578410174.0,"I feel the same way. It's like I'm watching myself destroy everything around me that means everything to me, and I can't help but continue. I don't understand."
bipolar,fddna4u,t3_ekrxsl,1578318505.0,Yes this is happening to me. Would it be considered rapid cycling?
bipolar,fddn6cd,t3_ekrlsg,1578318408.0,"I am experiencing the same memory loss. Seems to be getting worse as time goes on. I can barely remember anything prior to 16 when my mom passed, but my memory loss is starting to creep past that."
bipolar,fdcsfu2,t1_fdbr2q3,1578283007.0,"For me, I started smoking weed and then stopped taking meds. If you stay on your meds and continue seeing your doctor, your outlook is much better (in my opinion)"
BipolarReddit,fdbdu8c,t3_ek7wlh,1578256431.0,"I blacked out and cut myself really really bad with a box cutter. That's the day I went to get professional help.

No drugs or alcohol either."
bipolar,fdb907d,t3_ejo8wj,1578255057.0,"I smoked heavily for years while on medication. It was okay. However once I stopped my meds, if I don't smoke daily I get really irritable and emotionally out of control. It's really scary and annoying. I rarely drink and don't do any other drugs."
bipolar,fdb78xx,t3_ejng4r,1578254546.0,"That every one in my life thinks, no KNOWS, how much of a failure I have become after having so much potential 5 years ago."
bipolar,fdb4g3e,t3_ek33oa,1578253670.0,I'd go in a heartbeat if I could afford that.
bipolar,fdb35e5,t3_ejz1vm,1578253224.0,"Constantly stiff muscles, daily headaches, uncontrollable shivering even when I'm not that cold, my soul feels like it's broken glass piercing all my organs. Mental illness can totally destroy your body physically. Oh - lack of sleep then lack of eating really takes a toll on me as well."

bipolar,fdb21jb,t3_ek2kcp,1578252836.0,"Definitely prefer being alone, especially during an episode, to prevent myself from getting more worked up and hurting those around me one way or another."
bipolar,fdaynbq,t3_ek7w14,1578251859.0,This person is a SAINT. Don't block them! I wish more people in my life were so understanding.
bipolar,fdax2lz,t3_ekahjf,1578251396.0,I recently deleted my Facebook a few months ago. The relief is amazing. I also re-downloaded Reddit. I feel it is much more helpful.
bipolar,fdaw3yh,t3_ekfmgx,1578251018.0,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II in college. I completed 2 bachelors degrees and a minor with distinction as well as Dean's list, in 3 years, at Penn State. While working in a lab 20 hrs a week.

That's my last accomplishment. Got into a PhD program and quit after a month. 

Now I can't even keep a job üòû"
bipolar,fdavoup,t1_fdany2c,1578250839.0,I second the ranting to self
bipolar,fdas2u3,t1_fda3w3u,1578249378.0,"Thank you, I'm staying with my dad and his wife starting tonight, and they are extremely annoyed with me already because all I want (and need to do) is sleep. I don't have anywhere else to go. Times like this make it tough to try and not disappear to protect your family from yourself.

I wish you the best. And no matter what your brain is trying to tell you, I highly recommend sticking with medication - also you aren't married to your current psychiatrist. I sought out many opinions before I believed my diagnosis. Good luck!!!"

bipolar,faeomrm,t3_e8t5x0,1576004986.0,"I've had so many issues with impulsiveness, then the fear that takes over after totally paralyzes you. I've quit 2 jobs in the past year after having the same job for 5.5 yrs. I moved from NY to CO in June and now I keep making plans to drive back to NY to escape myself and my life here. Then I get my car packed and get scared, so anxious it's numbing. I unpack my car a few days later. It's happened twice in the past month. I've been off meds for 2 years now after falling off from 8 years of meds. I hate what I've done to my family in this downward spiral."
