london,fejedor,t1_feiht60,1579170004.0,Thanks so much! This comment really cheered me up :) yea I think I’ll go for it! And thank you for your advice ✨
london,feibydy,t1_fei8vox,1579134928.0,"Yes I’m on my mobile haha thanks so much for your input and for taking the time to write all this!  Even my friends who live there, and come from a smaller town, said it’s all about getting used to it and they all love London and they couldn’t imagine their lives elsewhere. So I’m hoping it will have the same impact on me, I think at the moment I’m more for trying this out and risk it but I also want to make sure I’m making the right decision!"
london,feibm09,t1_feiaf89,1579134699.0,Well I would look for an admin job which is what I’m doing currently. I’m studying part time also...I don’t think that would be an issue hopefully! I know north is so much cheaper but I don’t think I’d move there where really I have no connections :(
cats,feepvz0,t3_eokeql,1579038712.0,"My cat wakes me up every night purring cause she wants cuddles and she falls asleep on my chest, then she wakes up again and she does the same on intervals until I wake up to go to work lol still I don’t have the heart to move her."
terracehouse,fed3vl9,t1_feclx98,1578997513.0,This comment is spot on.

dating,fd5s85b,t1_fd5hxrc,1578180905.0,Haha I literally lasted for one drink and it was like the quickest drink of my entire life! Yes I try to be positive but I’m not positive about online dating anymore.
cats,fd5dl9k,t1_fd59udn,1578176590.0,"She does! She takes her little green ball you see in the pick in the box with her, and then she spits it out 😂"
dating,fd5cm03,t1_fd59x25,1578176292.0,"25, but I promised to myself that next guy I will start dating, will be because I met him in real life first. At least that way I know I find the guy attractive lol 

Well during our conversation which lasted around a week before meeting face to face, he would always talk about sex, pretty much everything would always go that point because he had a high sex drive. Nothing wrong with that, but still not ideal I haven’t even met you once. He even said quite a sexist “joke” which I wasn’t happy about and I told him, he did apologise so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I met him anyway. But then one of the first things he asks me at the date was if I take any drugs when I go to certain events 😅not really something you ask on a first date lol he just wasn’t my cup of tea and I thought better stay away from it."
dating,fd5647a,t1_fd528xa,1578174571.0,I dated my ex for 2 years and a half and we met on tinder.  I had another date on bumble and I didn’t like the guy much as he looked better in pictures  and he was a weirdo :/ I doubt I’ll find someone decent on it tbh. And I don’t have the energy to get to know someone and then it just goes to waste in a way or another
dating,fd2mpy8,t3_ejrmcj,1578149420.0,"Mate honestly, after being in a relationship for 2y and half with a tinder guy, which was toxic and abusive, I’m so done with online dating. I get you."

solotravel,fd2lmeu,t3_ejrvf9,1578148967.0,😂I’m using my Osprey of 40L for two weeks travel. Best choice just pick places where you can do a washing and you’ll be fine.
cats,fd2kyxy,t3_ejv6y1,1578148715.0,"My kitten doesn’t yet, she purrs every time I touch her and she sleeps at the end of my bed. Every now and then when she feels brave she comes close to me for a cuddle in the middle of the night, but then she leaves almost straight away. I only got her on Monday though so hopefully there’s still time for her to become like yours 😂"
terracehouse,fcx7kig,t1_fcx3s27,1578054431.0,"Exactly, I really like Barilla because it’s cheap in Italy and it’s still good. But definitely I wouldn’t use it if I wanted to make a good impression, I would make things from scratch!"
terracehouse,fcx2oiv,t3_eja54s,1578048563.0,"To be fair, I’m Italian and I’m quite surprised Peppe when cooks pasta only uses Barilla sauces. That’s easy cooking and nearly “cheating” honestly even Ruka could cook easily a pasta that way lol don’t get me wrong I adore Peppe, and that might be product placement + he probably doesn’t have time to cook the sauce from scratch being a mangaka! But every time the housemates complimented his pasta it would always make me laugh ‘cause that’s not much effort really 😂"
BreakUp,fcvbx2x,t3_ej0hsf,1577998872.0,"Processing and accepting the fact he doesn’t want me back, also dealing with the feeling of loneliness and memories that pop up. Mainly. If I could add a third one also the anger towards myself. I know breaking up with him was for the right reasons, he didn’t treat me right at all and he was verbally abusive. Yet I still love him and wish we could find a way to make it work. But he didn’t care while we were together why would he now? I don’t know how to get rid of this feeling. It’s unfair. It’s like an obsession almost and I need to over come it but not sure how."
terracehouse,fcur70z,t3_ei0y0w,1577986842.0,"I really don't like him either, I refuse to believe there are actually such dumb people to this world."
AmItheAsshole,fcuki4z,t1_fcuifzp,1577983041.0,"Yea I think that’s a good idea OP. You might just have very sensitive skin in general. Perhaps trying soap and lotion for sensitive skin? Or hypoallergenic products? They make shampoos and conditioners for scalps that get irritated easily using normal products. I know it’s different but they must do some for armpits or skin in general! If you really want to, you could ask your doctor to investigate more and what you could actually use, but of course it’s totally up to you and if you’d like that option and to go that far. It’s something I would do personally, but everyone is different!"
AmItheAsshole,fcuhsml,t3_eixb83,1577981281.0,"OP do you apply body cream after shaving? Cause if you don't that's why you get a rush. Also it's best shaving with water and soap of course. You don't have to shave every day because that would cause rushes also, but you could even once a week to compromise with your bf? As you admitted to have double standards. Although it's your body and you decide what to do and if he really loves you he will go past it."
AskReddit,fcucmuj,t3_eipzwh,1577977839.0,"Not sure if this counts as glitch, but just before something bad happens in my life (sometimes a week before, sometimes a couple of days before) I dream my great grandma or grandpa (who both died) warning me with gestures or actually talking to me. My father had cancer and my parents didn't want to tell me as I live abroad and they didn't want me to worry. 2 days before he had surgery, I dreamt my great grandma was stroking my cheek telling me everything would be ok. Mind you I had no idea or whatsoever my father was even ill! My mom told me 2 days later and I flew straight back home and the surgery went well. I was quite angry with my parents they didn't tell me, but I was really happy my father survived so I didn't make much of an issue. This sort of warnings happened before in other circumstances and I'm sure they will happen again. My mom has the same kind of ""glitch"" dreaming her father though."

terracehouse,fcnjpgp,t1_fcn68es,1577812967.0,Yea same I was shocked. Incredible also how we didn’t see the state of the cleanliness of the house until Ryo came!

AmItheAsshole,fcmtje8,t3_ehw713,1577791553.0,"NTA OP, I genuinely think as father and mother you end up loving your kids more than your partner eventually, or perhaps it's a different kind of love, but definitely stronger. They're a part of you and you see life repeating through them and you also live it through them. Maybe some people get a little (but like a very small amount jealous) but as a joke, it shouldn't even be the case though! Perhaps you haven't been given your wife much attention lately or in a long time? And that's why she acts this way? I'm totally supposing as we always need to consider both sides before saying your wife is a nutter. But yea NTA
Edit: I'm not English Mother tongue, I hope the term supposing is not rude."
terracehouse,fcl432u,t1_fckzliq,1577739368.0,Yea I totally agree on this! Also if he wasn’t that good looking/kawaii I don’t think people would have had much sympathy for him.
terracehouse,fcks9l4,t3_ehpv5l,1577732088.0,"I quite like Shoei, I think he is quite mature and very chilled simply. I don’t think he lets himself get affected by others or their opinions. There’s a reason if people from the house go to him for advice or to get some perspective. He doesn’t bring a particular explosive energy to the house like some others but he definitely has energy of his own kind. To me the most useless of them all is Ruka."
aww,fckfjjm,t3_eho2rm,1577724194.0,Love him he’s so cute! Not sure if I saw right but just as heads up giving tomatoes or cherry tomatoes to hamsters can provoke bad acidity to their stomachs and upset them badly! All of the citrus fruits as well.
relationship_advice,fckf9n2,t1_fckf1ju,1577724021.0,"No worries, honestly I get you I’m just the same. I’m trying to get better too and when I received this kind of advice from a friend once, it really helped me to put things into perspective and to improve! Good luck OP :)"
relationship_advice,fcketdj,t3_eho3z3,1577723734.0,"It sounds like you messaged him a lot already or that you double checked a lot with him if he was still up in going, which can come across like you are being a bit insecure and it can be off putting. Perhaps he’s just very busy since he’s a single dad, but I believe people who care always find time to reply to a message! Definitely don’t text him, let him come to you and if he ghosts, he ghosts. It will be a shame but in that case he’s just not meant for you and you deserve someone who doesn’t ghost you and actually wants to go to every gig possible with you!"
aww,fcked3r,t3_eho4gw,1577723442.0,Super cute 😍I’m getting my kitten today!

terracehouse,fc738w1,t1_fc730y6,1577496355.0,"Yeah definitely! I also love how hard he’s working for his dream! I live in the UK now, but for him learning Japanese at uni, moving there and then actually committing to become a manga writer is just on another level! Total legend"
