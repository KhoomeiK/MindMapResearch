unpopularopinion,ff9j0iy,t1_ff9cde6,1579714042.0,"Well I got involved with this church in high school that pushed Amway any given chance. I went to one of their church camps and they made it seem like you couldn’t live a good life if you had to actually work. It’s not work when you promote Amway but a way of life where you are surrounded by scripture and people with the same goal in life. They would have people testify on stage that were barely 18. They would discourage college and encourage their training program instead. I remember one of them even said that their training program is accredited but only in God’s eyes. It was a confusing time for me because people actually took interest in me when I was searching for somewhere to belong. I realized that I could never belong with these people and it’s all a fake charade. Another thing I noticed about that church is that everyone in the leadership was extremely good looking and very good at talking to people. A few years later, the church rebranded themselves. Here is a [forum](https://forum.culteducation.com/read.php?14,61939,page=351) that has some interesting reports from people who attended it."

insanepeoplefacebook,fdngq4a,t1_fdn56k3,1578585444.0,Not exactly.. I was adopted by a republican/conservative driven family and they were really involved with the church. I was only able to play into their charades until I started asking hard questions that made my parents resent adopting me. I remember telling a youth pastor that I am tired of pretending as I am waiting for the day where this life finally feels natural so I can blend in with my family and church. He told me that thinking is just pure evil and shortly after I was taken out of certain bible studies where you had to be selected to attend. My family shifted on me in my high school days and now I am the black liberal sheep as I am approaching my 30's. Luckily I wasn't completely sold by their values as my biological sister still is so maybe it just depends on personality.

politics,fdnbuiy,t1_fdn7thx,1578582419.0,"It is humbling to realize how the average person is not wired to think this way. I've always taken politics/religion with skepticism and that's not how I was raised. I was raised in two different types of republican/conservative households. I was destined to follow my last adopted family's footsteps with the church and live a miserable life but I was not wired that way. People would much rather be sitting ducks within their surroundings rather than to make waves by questioning uncertainty when it arises. An uneducated person gets offended when they are asked questions they can't bullshit anymore.

edit: added some clarity."
politics,fdgytpm,t1_fdgarkb,1578411635.0,Don't try and book an appointment at the end of the year since you are competing with everyone who has met their deductible that year. I legit told the administrator that I couldn't afford care in January so if there is anything she can do please let me know. Fortunately she made something work but she said that was a rare case since everything from October to December is booked solid.
politics,fdgy57c,t1_fdfr7zu,1578411189.0,"Lol I saw a surgeon before I met my high deductible of $2000 per year and it was $360 to get it examined without an xray. Then I was told I had to have surgery within 4 days and had to pay $1400 out of pocket before they would operate on me. Once my insurance kicked in then they reimbursed me $700 that I had to turn around and dump into the overall total bill. After everything was said and done, I spent about $3000 with hand therapy included. I am terrified to injure myself again because another injury could have me forced to move back to my parents and sleep on their couch. Oh and I also pay $120 a month out of my check for insurance."

aww,fcxor22,t1_fcxfb9q,1578067947.0,"I was bitten by a golden retriever all while being swarmed and nipped at by his chocolate lab buddy when I was a child. My head was literally hanging out of it's mouth where it almost sabotaged my eye but got my temple instead. Everyone was shocked about it, including the doctor that stitched my face up who immediately asked if it was a pitbull or german shepherd. Those dogs weren't disciplined since it determined that fireworks (it was 4th of July) caused them to act out of character. That moment created a large fear of dogs for majority of my childhood. I started reading about interaction with dogs and gained a new founded respect for dogs in my early 20's, now I am a natural around them and don't find myself getting nervous.

politics,fc2p2x7,t1_fc2kpph,1577369725.0,Yeah I just spent time with my significant other’s republican family during the holidays. I’m just appalled at how much they took opportunities to name drop Trump. They seem like good people but were born into wealth and see things differently when it comes to taxes and the economy. I had to bite my tongue many times but I don’t understand how they are not embarrassed to have that man represent them. The majority of the world is laughing at their party.
politics,fby0e8x,t1_fbxyy56,1577205070.0,Probably.
