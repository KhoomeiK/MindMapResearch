aww,fdc9kmj,t1_fdc9aai,1578269802.0,"My girlfriend has two dogs and one chases shadows all the time and it’s because he’s the submissive one and it’s a manifestation of his anxiety... They have to redirect him all the time, but it’s so hard to.  I’m not saying it’s the case for this puppers, I’m saying if it persists with other shadows that aren’t ball shaped..."
aww,fdc8xt2,t3_ekkb4k,1578269428.0,"Mixed feelings about this ... It’s cute, but if he continues to chase shadows, it’s not a good sign of mental health in the puppers :("

cats,fctfxvx,t1_fct70go,1577942002.0,"Might be the case! Our little guy got it from his sister, not because she scratched him but she was new from the foster home... Basically, she was a carrier and he never was exposed to anything so he got sick... I would (no pun intended) keep an eye on him and it starts getting gooey take him in ASAP."
cats,fct68gl,t3_eis7cm,1577933948.0,"Looks like he might have “cat pink eye” (conjunctivitis) ... Our little guy had it once and it starts with one eye, makes it look like he’s winking at you... Get him to the vet to get drops before it gets into his other eye and maybe to other cats (if you have them)... Also, if you don’t think that he hasn’t gotten into a fight with another cat, hurt, fell etc., don’t bother with any of the dye and then eye scans the vet may try to sell you on, not worth it unless you think he actually got into a fight with another cat and got his eye scratched"

Component or luck? LOL"
