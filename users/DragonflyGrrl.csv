Is this a pretty common sentiment in Lebanon? Or how do most of your countrymen seem to feel?"

Do an internet search for something called ""DBT Workbook"".. it really helped me a ton. It's just a method of working through your emotions and not allowing them to control your behavior. I used to act out like that some, and let me tell ya, it's horrible for interpersonal relationships. The sooner you fix this, the better your life will be. Seriously."

The people who have been in his house are all people who know his father has just died. They're very likely there to give their condolences and supposedly support him, as people do when a close one passes. 

It doesn't matter if they knew it was his father's watch or not. They knew it belonged to a person whose freaking father just died. This person is already going through HELL, let's compound that shitty feeling by being an absolute piece of filth and stealing from him!

I really believe that Trump only won because of all the very passionate Bernie supporters who were incredibly angry at Hillary for stealing the Primary. Many of them refused to vote for her. I did, because I knew the dangers of the alternative.. I think many learned a harsh lesson there and more will come out to vote for whoever wins the primary. Trump must go, at any cost. I would hold my nose, cringe, and vote for Biden to help make that happen. But Bernie is leagues above him."
worldpolitics,fc5kuiu,t1_fc5f3tx,1577460303.0,"Norway is actually high on my list! Such a gorgeous country, I know I would love it there. :)

The part that really hurts is that some (definitely not all, or even most) of these people are actually quite intelligent in other areas. My father was an attorney and one of the smartest people I've known, yet he was strongly in support of Trump. For the past year he had started admitting when Trump had gone too far and was showing disgust for some of his actions. Had he not passed away this year, I think he would have come around further. 

It just speaks to the power of propaganda and the danger of echo chambers. Fox news is in fact one of the worst dangers to humanity right now. I don't know how people fall under their spell but they do, in droves. :("

Edit: The TL;DR for anyone curious: from SW legends: he was an apprentice of Darth Sidious at one point long ago, but he branched off and created a ""Dark Force Cult"" that survived past his own death, but was entirely put down by Palpatine not too terribly long after.
