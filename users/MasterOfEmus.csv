dndmemes,ff9751c,t1_ff90uc1,1579706411.0,"Fair, it doesn't make it ""horrible"", but its a huge step away from what D&D traditionally does, and I suppose its more about class identity and filling different roles. I can see why they would want to rebalance the linear fighter vs quadratical mage dynamic, but removing it entirely in favor of giving all classes extremely similar progression trees doesn't feel right. You end up with, what seemed like to me, magic users having a real shortage of options to choose from while nonmagical characters had multiple ability options that just seemed forced and unintuitive.  Of course, the positive side is that it made it easier for them to release a crapload of extra classes, but I don't know how much of a help that is when all those classes start looking a bit samey."
dndmemes,ff8b60t,t3_es7a6k,1579671558.0,"Hey, 4e was my first system, and while it isn't good, there are some valid benefits to it. The division of abilities/spells into encounter, daily, and utility made it very easy to engage with, even though it heavily oversimplified spell lists.  It may have had horrible inter-class balance (namely everyone getting the same number of each type of power, dissolving a lot of class identity), but those systems really helped me learn how spells and resources are balanced.  Universal second wind was a reasonable way to make healers more optional.

Probably my favorite part is the multi-classing system.  It, like the way classes in general are designed in 4e, is flawed, but in principle the feature/ability-swapping idea is, imo, considerably more appealing than sacrificing your nth level in a primary class for a much lower level in a secondary.  Swapping out features or abilities at the same level helps maintain a power balance, and requiring minimum stats to be met and a feat to be spent keeps it from being easily minmaxed/powergamed. Comparitively, I almost always feel in 5e like a 5th level of, say, fighter is better than taking a 1st in warlock or sorcerer.  A 5/5 character lacks anything close to the power bump one gets from 5th level spells as a 9th level caster, or a 3rd attack, a second fighting style, or similar. I really *like* multiclassing, but 5e's method of allowing it just feels kinda lazy.

4e isn't a great game itself, but there's a lot to learn from it, and I personally wouldn't mind giving it a go if I ever have a group interested in it again."

Truscum is a term specifically for when someone *is* gatekeeping other trans people by applying a transmedicalist standard.

LateStageCapitalism,fdgupvn,t1_fdgb7jk,1578408800.0,"Yeah, basically.  Japan styled themselves as an Empire from early days, since they modeled their government and court life after the Chinese system, but aside from occasional occupation of Korea they never really *colonized* other countries the way Empires tend to.  There have been multiple periods of relatively intentional isolation, first in order to keep the ambition of China from bringing invasion armies to them, and then in the Tokugawa-ruled Edo period largely to prevent Christianity and firearms from Europe destabilizing the shogunate.

In the mid-late 19th century, the US used some good ol' fashioned gunboat diplomacy to open up trade.  As a result, the Imperial line, desiring to finally stop being mere figureheads for the Shogunate, found powerful foreign allies and took control of the country.  Once in control, the Meiji period saw very intentional adoption of the standards of Britain, Prussia, France, and the US.  Japanese people were encouraged to eat red meat (buddhism had previously made eating mammals unthinkable culturally), samurai and generals wore uniforms styled after western professional armies, Christianity spread far and wide and churches (with some gorgeous stained glass) were rapidly constructed, and the Emperor set his sights on Korea, Taiwan, and Mainland China.  Japanese Imperialism was more likely influenced by British Imperialism, there seem to be more cultural importation from them in general, but nonetheless its a practice that came into play relatively late in Japanese history."
LateStageCapitalism,fddz7np,t1_fddm6xa,1578327535.0,"No, that's not the response, the response is not to say ""Democrats good you can't prove them bad we must stop the Republicans"", because that's letting yourself get distracted into partisan debates instead of talking about dismantling gerrymandering.  Better response is ""In some states they probably do, don't you think that's wrong and we should make it impossible for the whole political system to disenfranchise voters like this?""

The democrats *have* engaged in gerrymandering, just in nowhere near as absurd or blatant a fashion as Republicans.  Its just one more weapon in a political arms race, its a tool that allows the leadership of a red state to ensure that it stays red in congressional and presidential elections, and it can be (and has been) finagled the same way for blue states.

Also, he makes abundantly clear that a $15/hour minimum by 2024 wouldn't even be that good.

Thanatos is definitely out since he's Zag's half brother (and they grew up believing they were full brothers).  Incest definitely exists in Greek myths, but not so much in video games that are trying to have broad appeal and avoid skeeving their audience.

Meg is a little more likely, but Zag still grew up believing they were half-siblings, and while their interactions feel a little flirty, they all fit just as well in that close friend/sibling context.

In general, Hades has few to no moments in dialogue with other characters where you make a choice.  If a romance option were added to the game, it would almost definitely be optional, and I don't really expect the devs to add dialogue options for just a few moments in the whole game.  They could, they already did it once in Bastion, but I still don't think its likely.

Ultimately, the biggest reason its unlikely is that, even if Than, Meg, and others come to understand Zag's choice to leave, they're still not going to join him, they're too busy in the underworld (where they, unlike Zagreus, feel at home)

mildlyinteresting,fckq3d0,t1_fckeqbc,1577730750.0,"English has multiple words for almost every concept, whick makes it a pain to learn but gives far more opportunity for nuanced and personalized speech.  Japanese has multiple writing systems, making it more difficult to learn, but offering greater ranges of specificity, and reading faster and with fewer errors for those who have achieved literacy.  These are difficulties and complexities which also strengthen and value the language.

And what part of English is easy to write?  Our spelling barely has any bearing on pronunciation, tell 10 new speakers to write down words like ""mnemonic"", ""philanthropy"", or ""Fuscia"" and you will get 5+ different answers, none of which are correct.  In Japanese, if you know the pronunciation of a word you can at the very least write it in Kana.  Kanji is a system many Japanese people debate the necessity of, but it provides benefits to each word.  When learning Japanese you absorb kanji alongside the words that use them, just the same as learning how to spell a word at the same time in English.

Also, you're just wrong about the use of English.  Japanese has numerous English loanwords (also a lot of French and German) which they reprocess into their own system of writing, grammar, and pronunciation.  This is a result of 1) The Meiji period efforts to emulate western countries, and 2) The American occupation of Japan post WWII, during which Japanese schools taught English and businesses were made to carry American goods.  Languages merge and combine when a nation suffers military occupancy, as happened with the Japanese language, which now has a huge number of loanwords.  They aren't speaking (as you say, horrendously-executed) English, they're using words with English, French, or German roots in their own native sentence structure and pronunciation model.  Its the same thing English has done (though less aggressively, due to generally not being forced to do so by military occupation) with French, German, Spanish, Italian, and bits and pieces of almost every language around the world.  The big difference is that we've had centuries to naturalize our loanwords which we gained slowly and peacefully, while Japan has had a matter of decades and a rushed addition through forced cultural merging."

mildlyinteresting,fck9y2k,t3_ehnb4l,1577720502.0,"Looking historically, there have been others.  During the Heiān period in Japan, only men were taught Kanji, the writing system that had been important from China.  However, since writing letters and journals was considered one of the better and more respectable noble pastimes, the Kana script was developed, a purely syllabic writing system with a few dozen characters to remember, contrasting with Kanji which had several thousand (each symbol corresponding to a single word).  Male nobles, typically all with government positions, would learn and use kanji/Chinese, but women used kana to write in native Japanese, creating an interesting cultural and gendered split.

Over time the two systems started to merge, until modern Japanese, which uses Kanji for nouns, verbs, and native Japanese names, Hiragana (a kana variant with softer, more flowing lines) for conjugations and non-kanji words, and katakana (a kana variant with sharper strokes) for foreign loan words, and sometimes emphasis.  Thus, a modern sentence would look like:

今日どんなテレビ番組を見ますか。

This reads as: Kyou (today, kanji) donna (which, hiragana) terebi (TV, katakana) bangumi (show, kanji), wo (article, hiragana) mimasu (look, kanji verb with hiragana conjugation) ka (functionally a question mark that you speak, although the syllable ""ka"" has other uses, hiragana again)

Understanding a sentence in Japanese as simple as ""what TV show are you watching today?"" requires literacy in three writing systems, one of which is literally an adaptation of Chinese and two of which developed from a system designed specifically to allow noble women to write letters and poetry.

Note that the only person of color of significance to make into the games at all (until maybe the expansions of The Witcher 3, which I haven't played) is an evil sorcerer from the east who seeks to subvert the natural order of the world, which is hardly very good representation (we also know they make bombs and have terrifying fauna, that's about all we get out of Zerrikania, roughly the only non-white country even mentioned)

And don't pretend like Geralt isn't supposed to be seen as, more or less, the good guy.  Yes, its a world of grey morality and nothing is cut-and-dry, and yes he makes questionable decisions (and the game allows you to make both worse and better ones), but at the end of the day he's the best person the universe has to offer.  Note that he is far from selfish, personally almost completely unbiased, and his moral quandries are largely one of idealism vs utilitarianism (is it alright to kill this person I know is a threat without a trial? is it okay to let that monster survive after it has done wrong, simply because I believe it will not do more wrong? should I kill the witch for cursing the town or the villagers for torturing ostracizing her?  The Witcher isn't about Geralt: the guy who might be good or might be evil depending on the day, its about Geralt: the guy who does what he thinks is right, but is troubling with doubts about his past that make him question what he does now.

And out of all of these, the rampant sexism and polr portrayal of women is probably the most relevant to a post about ""Geralt says trans rights""

I'm sure Geralt says trans rights, and if we were written into the Witcher's universe every one of us would be chomping at the bit to fuck him as thanks for the common decency, unless the author thinks its gay."

There's this website: https://norse-mythology.org/ 
It is good but falls into some common pitfalls and struggles with areas of queerness.  Some of the books the website recommends are good as well, but do some checking of your own as the website owner (and author of the first book he suggests) isn't quite as concerned with feminist and queer readings.

A lot of my info comes a person I spoke with online who only knew his sources in Dutch I believe.  I sadly don't speak it, and they didn't have any translations he knew of, so I can't provide much help, but you may find more if you look hard enough, especially if you look at Dutch or Swedish writers."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fcgcqpj,t1_fcg7kbc,1577638689.0,"Yeah but there's a big difference between characterizing a setting and characterizing the hero of the setting.  Geralt swinging his ~~dick~~ sword around as a solution to every problem, his fucking of half the things that move, and killing the other half, his whole backstory (and much of the setting) constructed to be an oppressed character but still played by a white man, thus not affording extra roles to actually oppressed peoples.  I get a little tired sometimes of franchises that jump through hoops to show oppression towards nonhuman (but white) races like elves etc so that they can have narratives of oppression without having darker skin tones or other representation of irl oppressed groups.  You *can* have your elves and dwarves and whatnot be the target of racism, but just make sure to do right by irl oppressed people and have some diverse casting.

And its just bad representation if most female characters are tripping over their dropped panties to get in bed with the main character, even a dude as hot as Geralt, and especially if its presented as a reward (we seriously need to fucking chill with using sex and women's bodies as a reward for doing the right thing)"

HadesTheGame,fcfs20h,t1_fcfqh1a,1577633225.0,"Yeah, I think its just an aspect of the game that remains incomplete, no character ever actually explains the ""bounties"".  You may have noticed a little chit-chat between Hades and his dad saying something like ""you're not mad I've been collecting on the bounties you set, right?"" and then his dad somehow being a total jerk about it while also saying ""nah you're fine""

atm that interaction is, I believe, the only one that acknowledges the boss reward system, they'll probably add a couple others with like, Nyx, Achilles, and maybe Meg (I would love a line from her like ""how's that blood treating you, Zag? was it worth it?)"

HadesTheGame,fcfo9wz,t3_eh6u6l,1577632197.0,"So the map animation shows that you already have gotten those rewards from those bosses, not that you *will* receive them.  When the map shows a question mark, that indicates that you will receive a special reward upon defeating that boss.  It's kinda weird, I'm sort of hoping they change the UI so the question mark shows an ""undiscovered"" reward, and then its left highlighted or not to show claimed vs unclaimed.

You only get each special reward once per weapon per heat level.  Until you've beaten the final boss at least once, the only way to get more is by going further with more weapons.

After beating the final boss, you'll gain access to the ""Pact of Punishment"", which allows you to trade increased difficulty for one or two side benefits and refreshed boss rewards."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fcfiycx,t3_eh6ddt,1577630499.0,"Yup, and at the very least reducing it to sex rather than a sense gender/social role also does major disservice to the queerness of faiths upon which wicca and neopaganism are built.

In Norse legends, the form of magic known as Seidhr is considered feminine, at least according to the texts that survive.  We have reason to believe that male practitioners of Seidhr were viewed as unmanly (and associated with being some form of gay/trans/queer), and that for what we have records of, that was culturally viewed as a very bad thing.  What no one talks about, however, (especially not Norse mythos-appropriating white supremacists) is that there are three figures well known for practicing Seidhr in all of Norse legends.  The first is Odin, who happens to have apparently invented magic and writing in general, Freyja is the second (and literally Odin's equal in every way, including receiving half of those who die in battle in her own version of Valhalla), and the last is Heimdall.

Heimdall, a guy who is in charge of Asgard's safety, who is considered among the most trustworthy and hardworking of the Aesir, is one of the greatest practitioners of the magic people see as feminine.  That's queer as fuck.  Sure would be great if the stories and text of Heimdall's achievements, which in all likelihood were also the primary guide on *how* ancient priests conducted their rituals, were still known today.  Sadly, the cultural genocide perpetrated by Christianity focused first and foremost on erasing feminine strength and magic.  Thus we are left with Odin, the fully masculine and not at all magical all-father; Freyja, the mother goddess and not much else; and Heimdall, the dude what blows a horn to warn the people of Asgard and apparently almost nothing else."
TrollXChromosomes,fcf8mvi,t1_fceva5i,1577627576.0,"The bail jumper, bar tender, cab driver, Greef, client or scientist, Kuill, IG-11, the jawa trader, and Paz Viszla could have all been female *without* the show passing the Bechdel test until at the very earliest the second to last episode, and even by the last episode just barely.  The show does not follow other characters, and no characters converse with each other about almost anything but the Mandolorian.  The only character who, if changed to female, would actually cause the show to pass the Bechdel test with ease is the Mandolorian himself.

Once again, I am NOT saying the show is good in terms of representation.  I am NOT saying it has anywhere near enough female characters, nor that it does justice to all those it has.  All I'm saying is that the Bechdel test isn't really the best way to critique the show, because the show is 100% unambiguously *about* the main character, and on the relatively rare occasion that other characters speak apart from The Mandalorian, 99% of the time they talk about him.  The show could have made the two stormtroopers that talk with each other in the last episode female, or given Carrano's character a throwaway line with someone else, or made one more of the train heist criminals a woman and the show would have passed the Bechdel test and it *still* would have had major problems with representation.  Any show can pass the Bechdel test and still have terrible representation, and this show could fail it and still manage to have good representation (it doesn't, but it could).

I think its reasonable to say that we should be able to have a female-fronted show or film franchise in this style.  A female Mandalorian, or Witcher, or cowboy/samurai style wanderer-hero would be great, and its a clear sign that the industry remains deeply unequal and sexist that we don't have numerous examples to give.  But as much as I hate the industry, I find it difficult to fault individual shows for not making their lead character female."
dndmemes,fcbvd4v,t3_eh0xgy,1577591391.0,"I love talking about the type of player that must have created you if the real world was an rpg.

TrollXChromosomes,fcb5ajz,t1_fcb28iq,1577582534.0,"The model of the show makes it very difficult.  I don't think many male characters talk with each other about anything other than the main character.  Gina's character is as fleshed out as Cuil, and the tropey sexual knife lady is as fleshed out as the other criminal folks.

I should have been more clear in my original post.  The Bechdel test is an excellent measure of the industry as a whole, and for most films, books, and other media.  I just think its important to remember that it doesn't apply equally to everything.  I'm also not saying The Mandalorian is somehow perfect as far as its female characters (I really can't stand the sexual knife lady trope), just that the Bechdel Test isn't the best avenue for critiquing it."
Kenshi,fc9pwuu,t3_egtl76,1577556413.0,"There is a lot more.  Now, having not played dwarf fortress, I don't really know if Kenshi does anything Dwarf Fortress doesn't, but what you've encountered is one of the most cherished aspects of the game.  The fact that the game treats you the same, and gives you a worse start than, virtually every npc means that basically the entire game world exists to be surpassed.

Modern video games train us to think that, in a good game world, there are a bunch of interesting jobs available that are relatively easy to do, with freely available modes of entry.  Skyrim has... well everything in Skyrim, M&B has introductory quests to make money and cheap recruits, virtually every game has fetchquests, and becoming a landowner in those that allow it rarely pushes you beyond your immediate means.  Kenshi offers few to know easy paths of advancement, because any of those that exist would obviously be nabbed up by other characters.  Positions in the guard? they go to locals trusted by the establishment.  Bandits? rarely recruit.  The only thing that's ""easy"" to train up and join a group for is thievery, which is in fact a completely broken system and way too strong.

I'll agree that its an incomplete game, but what's incomplete is mostly closing exploits and fleshing out of a few systems, like smuggling and slavery.  To advance early, you need party members.  Either take a start that gives you more, or spend a week or two mining and hauling copper.  You need easy training, so haul copper and drag bandits to town guards so you don't instantly lose, making sure that you have a character in reserve.  Once you have 5+ characters that are decent in a fight, you can challenge small groups of goats and starving bandits.  Buy a house, do some research, and then you can get on to base building.  Alternatively, haul copper and buy decent weapons and armor and hire on a few stronger characters, like Ruka or Rane in the Sheklands, and those plus the 5+ you had should be enough to do work and some adventures.  Find an environment that's good for training, I recommend the swamp, and kill things.  Find ancient ruins, exploring them can be great and can provide maps towards better loot.  You can even buy these sorts of maps from some merchants.

No matter what you do, you're gonna haul copper early (or take a slave start, which is generally the easiest) and you'll train by dragging enemies to guards for a time.  The world of kenshi is unfriendly to those who wish to advance their station, so its hard to scrape by.  The game is unfinished, but the difficulties you're having would likely remain in the finished project."

TrollXChromosomes,fc6wha7,t3_egizys,1577491281.0,"I love it, also its a perfect example of the Bechdel test not being very relevant.  The fundamental model of the show is following the main character and 1-2 side characters, who are largely connected to the main character but not each other.  Additionally, the main character (or baby yoda) is almost always one of the most interesting things in any given room, making it more forgivable that characters are usually talking about him.

There's maybe two episodes where it could have reasonably passed, with the train heist being one (if there had been a second woman with the criminal gang) and the first episode with Gina Carrano being the other (could it have happened here? I think her character might have had a talk with the local woman)

MurderedByWords,fbzqd30,t1_fbzesiv,1577256288.0,"There's a flaw in your analogy in that its a totally different type of work.  He's your *contractor*, not your employee, and you're his *client*, not employer.  As a contractor (at least as an independent one), you set your own hours, accept or refuse jobs as you see fit, and you are far less beholden to your client than you would be to an employer.  In return, you don't get benefits or a lot of the support systems present in other forms of employment, since you are responsible for your own hours (thus, you pay for your own medical expenses, either through private insurance or out of pocket).

If your contractor gets sick and can't work, you have zero ability to make him come in to work, you don't track sick days on him, and if he's unable to finish the job he is free to cancel the contract and return pay to you.  But you can be damn sure that that contractor, functioning as a one-person independent company, keeps money/insurance enough to cover when he's unable to work.

As a full-time employee with a salary and benefits, things are completely different.  You have to follow the rules and procedures of your company/employer, but in return they have a responsibility to you.  This is why employees get severance and contractors don't.  It's why employees get benefits and contractors don't.  It's why being an employer is a much bigger deal than being a client, because as an employer you are taking on responsibility for your employee's wellbeing.

This doesn't mean that everyone should have access to an infinite pool of paid sick leave.  Rather, it is to say that any employer should have a measure of compassion to their employees beyond the minimum legal requirement of sick leave, and that healthcare coverage is a basic human right.  If employers don't provide it, and contractors aren't paid enough to afford it, then it should be provided through a universal single payer program by taxpayer dollars.

HadesTheGame,fbxtp4s,t3_eeo6pk,1577200241.0,"Damn, I'm not seeing much love for Ares, my favorite of the Olympians.  Don't get me wrong, I love both Artemis and Aphrodite, like everyone else here, but practically the only boon Ares has that I wouldn't regularly take is his Attack curse.

Blade rifts do some of the most ridiculous damage in the game, and the fact that you can stack so many buffs on them is why I'm always happy to pivot a build into them.  I don't often take Ares in Tartarus, but if I happen into one or two of his boons there I'll often take his keepsake along with Artemis' in Asphodel and Elysium.  My two strongest runs so far have been blade rift cast on hera aspect bow with the tracking buff and size increase.  I can't even imagine how strong it would be if I had gotten his legendary boon (each rift tick does 1 more damage than the last) or the one that sucks enemies into the center (combining that with tracking seems seriously nasty).

Besides that, doom can be stupid powerful.  I recently had a chaos aspect shield where I literally only had like, 2 or 3 boons up until Styx.  I started by getting a special from someone else, then swapped it into a heroic Ares boon, giving me about 250 damage on the special.  I then got Urge To Kill for some reason, and the two boons that buff doom effects once I was in Styx, and got the base boon up to level 10.
