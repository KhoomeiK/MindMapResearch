NoStupidQuestions,ffahhnu,t3_esk5q5,1579735850.0,"Sativa = energizing weed to the point that it will space you out if you smoke or eat too much. 

Indica = sink in the couch and pass put weed. Indica = in da couch. 

Hybrid is a mix of these 2. 

Smoking will get you high quicker and it will wear off quicker. Edibles have a 1-2 hour delay and can be mild to completely overwhelming.

It may take a few sessions before you get truly high. I smoked my first few times without getting high. After the 6th or 7th time it was completely psychedelic and i was having mild hallucinations."

Re4 is pretty cheap on steam although ive never been able finish it due to lack of desire. I played it a lot on gamecube though and its a great game no matter what system you play it on.

The story kinda tanks at re4 imo so the story after re3 is fine to ignore.
