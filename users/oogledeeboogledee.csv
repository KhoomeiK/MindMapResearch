TwoXChromosomes,ff2b07p,t1_ff27sk3,1579499194.0,"a) ""third trimester"" straddles the viability line -- there's a big difference between a pregnancy at 26 weeks vs. 36 (as referenced in that interview you linked)

b) 20% is not a lot of support -- 3rd trimester abortions do not have real support with any group and are not the main legislative focus of the pro-forced-birth crowd, though they make a great bogey-man

c) That interview indicates that there are only 4-ish providers in the entire country willing to do 3rd trimester abortions, and they do it on a very case-by-case basis, depending on the situation/health/age of mother and fetus, as it should be.

As she says in the interview, no one would abort a healthy 35 week fetus. It's too dangerous anyway.

I mean, not knowing you're pregnant is not a great reason to get a third trimester abortion, (and they should only happen very rarely, which is the case), but if that baby isn't viable yet, the government has no business forcing a woman to risk her life to save it. In that interview you linked, she says: 
> ""Still, if you compare abortion at any gestational age to childbirth, childbirth is significantly more likely to kill the mother than abortion, which is something that no OB-GYN will ever tell you.""

Pregnancy is dangerous, and I support the current state of third trimester abortions, where they are extremely rare, but performed when necessary as determined by a responsible few doctors with their patients."

AdviceAnimals,fdc909g,t1_fdbyh87,1578269467.0,"Umm, not at all, but I'd argue that you are.

I mean, I actually do agree with you-- the oligarchs have basically won, and we as individuals are more or less powerless. But that cynical shit doesn't help anything.

It just leaves us more open to extremist bullshit.

The only hope for a solution is democrats banding together against  Trump, whoever comes out on top to band around.

And democrats may not be perfect, but to pretend they're anywhere near what republicans have become is absurd, and is exactly the idea that Trump and Putin are constantly spreading.

So get out of here with your bullshit Russian propaganda"

You're not gonna have some glorious revolution where the people rise up and take it back for themselves with that attitude. Instead you just get the Democrats to stay home on election day and end up with a bunch of Repubs burning it all down for Putin.

As far as I see, Democrats, centrist and progressive, still support the fucking constitution, which is more than you can say for any Republican these days.

The sides are different, and I'm sick of this cynical Russian bullshit that they aren't"

AppalachianTrail,fctrrnv,t1_fctqjur,1577956115.0,"Yeah I know-- that's a decent article. I worked in the industry for a few years, doing quality and regulatory stuff

The gist of it is that this ridiculous law passed in 1994, DSHEA, basically regulates supplements as food, even though they're used as drugs. So supplements have a really low bar: just that they are what they say they are. There's no guarantee that what they say they are is safe or efficacious though.

That's why I avoid any of the weird herbal shit that probably causes liver damage or whatever. But I'm all right with basic multivitamins-- compounds that are easily testable, and from decent companies."

AppalachianTrail,fctn4sp,t1_fctlw7a,1577949746.0,"Supplements are totally regulated by the FDA.

They're not regulated like drugs, as in they don't need to show any efficacy, but known dangerous things do get pulled off the market, and quality testing is serious shit. 

I mean, they're definitely not regulated enough, but it's not as crazy as you're painting it.

I do agree that the dosages can absolutely be unhealthy and there's really no control for it, and on the opposite end, often the forms used are poorly absorbed though"
fatlogic,fctlzn3,t1_fctkw7i,1577948322.0,"Yeah when I first saw this post, in the context of fatlogic, it was disturbing. But I didn't think of it in a recovering anorexia way til your comment, which seems to make more sense.

I mean, I have no idea the source of this post, but the idea of food only in exchange for movement sounds more like anorexia talking than FA-- I mean, I feel like it's a concept that wouldn't even occur to a FA-thinking person

Edit: to be fair, the whole problem with a lot of this FA crap is that it's trying to co-opt anorexia recovery type things for themselves. So a lot of the posts here could fit that: things that make sense directed at anorexia recovery, horrifying when directed at already-fat people"

AppalachianTrail,fclneo5,t3_ehougt,1577751886.0,"Yeah I felt like I was being pretty thrifty, but ended up spending so much because of how slow I hiked and taking too many zeroes.

I mean, you have to watch out in town, because it's easy to just hemorrhage money every moment you breathe, so if you stay, camp at hostels or split hotel rooms.

But the bigger factor for me was time-- it's a lot cheaper if you only need 6 days of supplies per 100 miles vs. 8 or 9 days.

So I'd say it's more important to focus on getting in good hiking shape with dialed in gear, so you spend less time mired in injury or searching for gear upgrades in town, than to worry too much about  thriftiness methods.

Also, mailing packages was way pricier than I expected, so trying to maildrop food will be mostly not worth it"
