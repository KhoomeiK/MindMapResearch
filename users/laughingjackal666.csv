fursuitsex,ff241pd,t1_ff23zc1,1579493221.0,"You got this, homie! If you attend look for me, I'm down to chill."
fursuitsex,ff23m95,t1_ff23g9i,1579492886.0,"I went to cons from 03-09ish, took a hiatus, started going back in '17. I encourage your con visitations!  I'm near furpoc now, but we'll see if I make it this year. Thank you, I might go to ANE depending on budget.. If not that, AC or Furrydelphia if I'm still in this area of the country. Either way, enjoy the experience and be safe!"
fursuitsex,ff20ra2,t1_ff20bix,1579490730.0,"I'm so with you on that. Honestly, at this stage in my life, I'm more concerned I did it in a way that's going to hold up in court for my due diligence. But you have a good head on your shoulders, just please be safe! If need be, Google who they say they are. Check FA, Twitter, whatever. Better safe [saying no] than sorry!"
fursuitsex,ff1wnhd,t3_er414u,1579487870.0,"In the early 2000s we tried using door bouncers to check IDs but honestly nobody cared.

I would say the only certain thing is using protection. Don't trust anyone at their word, documents can be faked. Be safe as you would in any other hook up. 
Checking ID is not a terrible idea, though fake IDs exist, it's better than no clarification at all."
RealLifeShinies,feknosc,t3_epki7m,1579203839.0,A bawkmoth!
Art,feflxel,t3_eolpr5,1579059149.0,"You really nailed the lighting and depth of the snowflakes. Like, I'm mesmerized. The subtlety of the snow falling behind the lamps and the careful attention to detail as they brighten and enter the light beam are brilliant. Might be a weird thing to focus on but it caught me since a lot I see go from one shade of grey into bright white and back real jarringly. Excellent job!"
aww,fefipqa,t1_fefi6l0,1579057154.0,"Ooh man I hope she finds a really great home. I want to adopt her so bad. I told all my local friends about her, hopefully this can raise awareness."
aww,fefim66,t1_feffbtw,1579057094.0,"Thanks for this! That's where I first saw her as well, I hope she finds a great home."
aww,fefi311,t3_eoumv3,1579056773.0,"I FOUND THIS DOG ON PETFINDER and tried to contact the rescue for more photos because I thought her original pic on the site was warped. I am SO GLAD you posted another view of her!! Thank you! If I could I'd snatch her up, but I already have a husky mix and can't afford double trouble. :3 

Is she still for adoption?"
Watches,fdsqlb8,t3_emw6ap,1578706669.0,I love this shot--i miss my rainbow boas! Both snek and watch are quite lovely.
pics,fdoe706,t1_fdo4zz5,1578603479.0,"Do they do this on rentals? That would be my first thought, if it's a rental you can't alter it. I could be wrong though!"
adhdmeme,fdld0gs,t1_fdl4sqw,1578521399.0,"I love that you made a fishy playlist for him! 

Btw r/bettafish is a great place to start to finding the best tankmates for your lil dude. Hope that helps!"
AskWomen,fdfjy9d,t3_ekvi2h,1578363463.0,"I don't mind my government name, but phonetically it sounds almost exactly like a few very generic, common names.
Jinn.
I get asked if it's Jen, Jennifer, short for Virginia, Jan, Jenny, etc.

I haven't been able to afford to legally change it yet but I've used Sabarika for around 20 years now. Worst I get is ""Debbie"" when someone doesn't hear ""Sabby"" correctly.

Only impacts my life when I meet people who knew knew me as Jinn because I no longer respond to it, so I'm thrown off guard. Or I hear Jenn and I turn my head. I can't wait to legally change it tbh."
coyote,fdeet1m,t3_ehoquo,1578337464.0,"Looks like that paw was in a trap and perhaps they chewed it off to get loose, but they seem happy and healthy as it is! What a cute friendship."
furry,fchq6gb,t3_eh6mhu,1577652965.0,Chester got SWOLE.

flashlight,fc4kg5u,t3_eg0qry,1577419284.0,I just bought a pair like this for my roommate.. Awesome!
ATBGE,fc4drv7,t1_fc3yykn,1577413738.0,Lick it.
ThatsInsane,fby3pan,t3_ees6jz,1577207335.0,I used to go see this as a kid! Love that they still do this.
nostalgia,fbrt9hu,t3_ee7san,1577046087.0,I got a pair and I was unable to use them as my mom and I couldn't get all the bands on the damn things secured in place. So I had half constructed moon shoes. That's my only memory of them.
