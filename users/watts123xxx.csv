Seriously who thinks like that?! No concern for their friend who is starting the scary journey of an illness. It’s shocked me the audacity of that bride 😑😡"

socialanxiety,fc21pap,t3_efl533,1577336942.0,"Sometimes it helps pretending to be someone else, someone who doesn’t give a fuck! Think I’m your mind yes this is awkward and embarrassing, but so what if I make a tit out of myself. Everyone looks like a tit too. If you’re crap, laugh at it! 

God I remember once in a board game with a large group my question was who’s the current queen. I just said queen Elizabeth I. They all laugh because it was wrong it’s queen Elizabeth II. Taking the mick that I thought it was the virgin queen..... I felt embarrassed but quipped “well she was once a virgin’ and then that was that.

Anyway moral of the story is... if you learn to laugh at yourself, it gives you the power and it will get easier xx"
socialanxiety,fc1wydu,t3_efmzm3,1577332271.0,"Omg I’m so happy tonight I’ve found this community. It’s nice to know people know and understand this debilitating fear and stress. 

I panic for days before a family meet up, probs somewhat to do with the drama I’ve had with them this past year... but also because I just can’t help it. The prospect of stepping foot out in public scares me. I feel hypersensitive and paranoid, so I don’t go out much and avoid social situations.

But with your situation today I want to say... do t beat yourself up!! So it got the better of you today. You now have another opportunity to show your face. If people ask “well why didn’t you come yday” keep it short and sweet. A sentence that doesn’t invite questions. Like “oh I know I wanted to come so much, but the last couple of days I’ve been so ill. (Being sock and diarrhoea lol) god there’s so much going round! I didn’t want to spread my germs lol but I feel so much better today. Also do overwhelm yourself. Show your face but in your mind say to yourself your goal is to stay for 2 hours then you can go. That’s a fair amount of time to be polite and won’t be so daunting. That’s what I did today. I stayed for two hours and left.

Sorry if I’ve over shared on my part lol
Just comforting to know I’m not alone.

I wish you a merry Christmas and send my love"
socialanxiety,fc1w7cf,t3_efkv52,1577331609.0,"Does Christmas suck for you because of your anxiety hun? I understand you, I suffer the same. I didn’t go out for the Christmas meal with the family today because I knew it would be too much. So visited them after for a couple of hours. Jeez believe me that was all I could handle! It was too chaotic! But maybe that’s just my family... we are a bit nutty lol. Just thought I would message to say you’re not alone with that fed up feeling. That feeling of anger of not being able to overcome anxiety. I get so annoyed at myself. Even though I know most of the time it’s not logical.... it’s also hard for most people to sympathise. So just wanted to say hey and say I’m someone who does get it and if you want to talk or vent message me. Merry Christmas my love and I hope you feel better soon. Don’t beat yourself up x"
socialanxiety,fc1vs4e,t3_efpoen,1577331251.0,"Yes darling, you’re not alone with that. I for one have felt it this year and there are many people that also suffer with S.A.D syndrome.
I know that I feel blue for other reasons. This time of year has been tainted by epic dramas that has happened to me in previous years. So I think that’s why I feel a dark cloud hanging over me.
But maybe that’s not the case for you.
I just wanted to share so you know you’re not alone and please if you want to talk or vent you can message me direct. Sometimes it’s easier to talk to a stranger and to someone who understands this feeling.

Merry Christmas and I hope your blues have lifted, but if not I’m sure it will lift soon ❤️"
