AskReddit,ff8seul,t3_es53p0,1579694271.0,"One of my sisters is really boring but I think it’s because her world is small. And I don’t mean that in a way that oh she should be travelling to amazing locations, or taking up a really time consuming hobby, or making some huge scientific discovery—I just mean that she doesn’t read widely or watch a variety of tv programmes or YouTube videos or talk and listen to a large cross section of people with the intention of learning something from/about them. She just stays within her own little echo-chamber bubble and as soon as something gets a little difficult or uncomfortable she quits. So when I talk to her it’s just literally the same shit I’ve heard over and over for the past 10 years. By contrast my other sister goes out of her way to read different books and articles, play new video games, watch a different show on Netflix, so although she’s not doing anything wild she has different insights to share and talk about. See I think sometimes people think that in order to be interesting you need loads of money and time to have amazing experiences to talk about but you don’t—you just need to have an open and curious mind and be willing to listen to understand and learn."
puppy101,ff4dra2,t3_eriqtz,1579561205.0,I feel we did pretty well but most recently—The sky. Apparently. My 9 MONTH OLD puppy appeared to suddenly discover the sky a couple of weeks ago and was amazed that there were birds up there. He’s very odd. It never occurred to me that I may have to socialise him to the sky—and this is a puppy I’ve owned since 9 weeks and have walked daily since around 11 weeks so he’s not a rescue who was shut inside—but he’s very sensitive and things do seem to take him by surprise that my older dogs never took issue with. He also faceplants sand when I take him to the beach? Like I have to watch him carefully because he just spends the whole time sticking his full face into the sand. I don’t know man—he’s quirky!
NoStupidQuestions,ff2leqt,t3_er1vm8,1579511645.0,After answering a number I didn’t know which turned out to be a computer virus scam and then subsequently being barraged by phone calls from this same company for around three months until I finally got the courage to play them and they gave up I no longer answer numbers I don’t recognise.
fatlogic,fezoufb,t1_feybt4d,1579459804.0,This is exactly why I now eat OMAD—it’s so much easier to keep track of. The only thing I stray on is having a few cups of tea or coffee with oat milk which I don’t track but I don’t get het up over. I’ve adjusted to OMAD now and it’s not taxing and I can know for a FACT that I’ve stuck to my limits because there’s only so much one woman can eat in a single meal lol
dogs,fexemhg,t1_fevbixa,1579429743.0,I also have a glass eater—when my guy was little he ate a LIGHTBULB and bizarrely was perfectly fine afterwards.
AskReddit,feu8r3f,t1_fesh50u,1579384257.0,Im European. People are allowed to wear shoes in my house but only downstairs where the floors are flat—NEVER on the carpet upstairs in the living room. But people still do! I have to tell people to take their shoes off before they go upstairs so it’s definitely not just American people who do this.
childfree,feo5x5m,t3_eq028t,1579295499.0,"Oh my god absolutely. It’s one of my main drives for not wanting kids—there are so many things I want to do and I don’t want to have to wait until my kids are grown to do them! I’m 30 and nearly finished my undergrad, hopefully moving onto med school next year. My husband and I have four wonderful dogs, a lovely home, we spent a month visiting China last year, we also went to France and Iceland. I spend my free time hiking and growing my personal library. Would I give all of that up to raise a couple of kids? Hell no! My world would be so much smaller if I had children—I see it in my friends and I’m just not willing to waste all my potential doing something so mundane as raising a family. Maybe that makes me selfish but at least I’m happy and fulfilled!"
childfree,feo3vkg,t3_epzu52,1579294751.0,I can’t believe they allow children in at all—I had no idea this was even a thing. The gym I go to has a no under 16s rule. Wtf are people doing bringing a baby to a gym??
dogs,feo2toc,t3_eq28nv,1579294354.0,This is ridiculous. The dog can’t even walk on a leash! This really pisses me off because it’s inevitably going to make it harder for genuine service dogs if people keep trying to pass their regular pets off as such. There needs to be a single regulatory body that ALL service animals need to be licensed by. If your animal is not licensed by this agency then it’s not a service animal and access is denied. End of story. Maybe there could be special tags or something a registered animal wears? ESAs need to be included because they seem to be the worst “offenders.” Honestly the whole situation needs to be more official because it’s a safety matter and an access matter for people who have real service animals. Makes me so mad.
dogs,fenyuy0,t3_epza1e,1579292814.0,"I’m so very sorry for your loss. It’s going to hurt for a long time but Lucy would want you to continue with your life and she would be so proud that you had the strength to go to your exam and pass despite your grief. That shows real strength and that’s the life she would want you to lead. 

I think composing a piece of music for her when you’re ready is a beautiful idea. When my sister lost her little pet friend, Stacy recently my husband wrote a song for him on his guitar and although it was very hard it felt easier to let him go after that and to do that one last thing for such a dear friend."
puppy101,femfq0t,t3_epuw31,1579253126.0,Oh no! I feel you—I’ve been there. We went through a serious poonami phase. Every morning the crate was just filled with liquid shit. I thought we were past in and my husband and I left puppy with my sister while we went away for the weekend. However I got a call the first morning we were away. My sister was horrified that she had to wash shit off the puppy’s EYEBROWS lmao. Dogs bring such joy to our lives.
Dogtraining,fekhzg6,t1_fef5aia,1579200437.0,I second the use of tug toys. My boy is obsessed with his but it took a while to find one that he was this jazzed about so experiment with different toys to find one that really motivates her. I have one made of real sheepskin and when I have it he will do anything for the reward of a game. Just teaching him good tug manners pretty much sorted our leash biting issue tbh. For my guy he bit at the leash out of excitement and excess energy. So using the tug toy to not only reinforce drop it but also to expend that burst of energy helped massively.
Dogtraining,fejw5up,t3_eox366,1579187237.0,I took a sort of chance and bought a puppy that had been left with its mother and two other siblings until he was four months or so and he has turned out to be a wonderful dog. He’s not smart at all so will be winning no titles in obedience (lol) but he’s a very level headed dog and is extremely well behaved out of the house. He’s also incredibly gentle. I feel that maybe this was due to the extra time he spent with litter-mates learning bite inhibition and learning how to communicate with other dogs. He’s so good with other dogs and I trust him completely. So this sort of situation can work out really well but it all depends on the work the breeder has put in and where the puppy has been living. My guy lived in the breeder’s house surrounded by her other dogs and family and he was well socialised. It’s definitely something to consider and I wouldn’t be immediately put off if I were you.
Dogtraining,fei545v,t3_ep8c7t,1579130484.0,Only two out of my four dogs actually alert me that they need to go poop. They’re all on a potty schedule though so we have no accidents. I would just start taking her outside more frequently and make it roughly the same times each day so that she knows she will have the opportunity to go potty regularly and so that gives her a reason to hold it. After a while you may find that she starts to ask.
childfree,fegirx7,t3_eo9l7l,1579094053.0,This makes me so angry. Why is a child’s life more valuable than an adults?? You see this all the time in the media and movie etc as well as real life. It’s honestly disgusting.
childfree,feg9alk,t3_eoxu5w,1579083234.0,"Love my dogs. My husband and I are going out for dinner for his birthday tonight and guess what? Don’t need a babysitter. The dogs will chill at home for a few hours no problem. They don’t need glasses or braces, I don’t have to fight to get them into a competitive school or spend thousands on college. We went on holiday for a month and my sister did the house sitting. The dogs didn’t mind that we were gone. They eat what’s put in front of them. They go to bed at 1030pm sharp. Pets are worse than kids? What bullshit."
puppy101,feg8zo5,t3_eoxxqt,1579082804.0,This happened to me a few years ago. One of mine got out and the PANIC! We live in the city and it’s busy. My husband called the vet and the dog warden while I went looking for her. Guess where she was? The park! It was a route she knew well only two blocks away and she liked it there so I guess after finding herself free she just decided to go hang out. I was so relieved but also amazed that she had navigated across two roads there without incident.
AskReddit,fef5nbj,t1_feeew26,1579048754.0,Oh my god SAME. I thought they were lying but it’s all true. And I’m not even inactive or new to exercise so why is it leaving me in pain now?? There are some excellent things about being in your thirties but this sneak attack joint pain is not one of them.
Dogfree,fe9ufov,t3_enu73l,1578941543.0,"All of these issues you have outlined are owner problems, not dog problems. ALL of them. Dog owners are the fucking worst. I have four dogs and I have put HOURS into training them but I fucking loathe other people’s dogs because most other people I have met are not willing to do the same and somehow just put up with all these crappy behaviours. Dogs are not intelligent like humans but they are very capable of learning through classical conditioning. And that takes a lot of repetition when the dog is a puppy. I guess many people aren’t willing to do the legwork that involves which is just beyond me because who wants to live with an animal that acts like a fucking demon?? It’s bizarre. 

One of my biggest pet peeves is people owning dogs they have no business owning. Why are people who live in the city and have no time or interest in training their dogs buying spaniels? These dogs are bred to work and pick up game in the field. So why are you taking a working dog into the city, asking it to spend 90% of its time home alone and refusing to train it then expecting it to behave in public?? I don’t get it. I hate spaniels. I know if I see one coming it’s going to fuck up my walk. Dogs can be great friends but they need to be taught how to do this and sadly most owners are lazy and so that’s why most dogs are a PITA."
puppy101,fe7ey6g,t3_eo1y1o,1578913688.0,"Seriously keep going with the training and control freakness—you will be thankful in a year! Ignore this person. Sometimes people speak like this because they have regrets, doubt or discomfort about their own situation and seeing other people taking a different route makes them feel bad about their own actions. It’s not worth getting upset over. Enjoy your puppy and continue with your schedule and training."
Dogtraining,fe5tflo,t1_fe3ka8z,1578874549.0,"I agree. Bostons are very smart dogs and they need to be occupied. I walk mine for an hour in the morning, a 20 mins game of tug or fetch in the pm and then another 30 min walk in the evening plus random training through the day and he’s a good boy in the house because he’s tired and satisfied."
Dogtraining,fe5mcks,t3_enshtr,1578871323.0,She’s not being an asshole. She’s just a giant puppy and picking these things up and not giving them back is rewarding for her so she keeps doing it. I found the best way to combat this with my own puppy is to provide an even more rewarding alternative. I don’t know how you’re training her to give things back to you but I’ve found swapping mine for something better works. Cold cuts do the trick for mine. I also upped my play time with tug to teach him that giving something back to me equals something better eg. more play and that gradually did translate into less stealing shenanigans. I also taught a really rock solid leave it by teaching him not only to leave it but to make eye contact with me when he left the thing so that I know that his attention is well and truly off the thing he was eyeing. And then again he gets a cold cut which is much more appealing for him than running around with socks or the remote. Honestly just upping the payload worked wonders. That and consistency and time. You’ll get there! Just keep going.
puppy101,fdy70dq,t1_fdxjfo8,1578776757.0,"I totally agree with all pp that the puppy needs to be trained, that resource guarding has a genetic component, seek advice from a professional if you can etc however, I also think you need to “train” your child. I know it’s not easy with a five year old but she shouldn’t be taking things from him. Daily irritation from a well meaning but maybe clumsy or thoughtless (not in a bad way—she’s only five I know!) child could all have added up to what the puppy is now expressing as aggression. You’ve said yourself he’s a sweet puppy but if each day he’s been feeling gradually more and more irritated by your child, adding on top of that if he has a natural predisposition to resource guarding, then he may be simply expressing himself the only way he knows how. I really urge you to get professional help because I don’t think this is past the point of no return but I also would urge you to teach your child to leave the puppy alone. I know kids want to play with puppies but unfortunately not all dogs are equally tolerant so listen to what your dog is telling you and watch all their interactions very closely and keep it all as low key as possible at least until you have some more advice from someone who can properly assess the situation and tell you if it’s going to be workable or not."
Dogtraining,fdwufsh,t3_emtmpu,1578762384.0,I have this issue with one of mine. A scary incident with deer a few years ago had me cracking down. I’ve not 100% fixed the problem but improved it massively—I’ve found that solidifying recall helped immensely but what made the big difference is understanding his body language. He has several tells that he’s about to take off and I’ve realised that if I recall the second I notice him pausing slightly and stiffening up in his body that he’ll return to me. If I leave it later than that then I’ve lost him as he’s gone into the chasing “zone” and can no longer hear me. I would start watching your dog really closely on a walk and notice subtle body language that they’re on the hunt for something. I can’t tell you how much better my dog has gotten just from me being more observant.
reactivedogs,fdvcq1v,t1_fdt68uv,1578746035.0,One of my dogs is like this. I spent years trying to encourage her to be like the others who love walking the trails and running on the beach and meeting new people. But she was so resistant and it was making both of us stressed. Around two years ago I “gave up” and accepted that she was going to be the sort of dog who only joins in on low key and gentle activities. Her world is very very small and initially I felt so guilty but seeing the change in her since then has made me realise it wasn’t giving up but accepting her for who she is and she’s so much happier now that I’ve realised that she’s a different person to the others and that she has different needs and a different outlook. There’s no shame in accepting that your dog’s personality may just not be suited to certain activities and environments.
Dogtraining,fdqy6ey,t1_fdq3v9w,1578676592.0,I’m also not really understanding the issue here? Is there something about dog urine on bricks that I don’t know about? Couldn’t it just be hosed down once a day and apply some dettol or whatever a few times a week?

puppy101,fdalony,t1_fdaglug,1578247458.0,"That sounds like a good idea—I am very lucky at my vet. We have the main waiting room, the “quiet” waiting room for cats and anxious dogs, and an outdoor waiting area which is a large grass square with view through the glass frontage so anyone who’s dog is really uncomfortable can be walked around the edge and then signalled to go in when they are called. It’s taken me a while to find a vet office which is so great (also provide stellar care for the animals and the humans) so it’s worth shopping around to find one that fits your needs."
puppy101,fdaf0v3,t1_fd950qv,1578245332.0,"Oh I don’t mind people who ask either. It’s those that swoop in! I get what you mean about waiting areas—it can be kinda tense anyway and then add in uncooperative strangers and it makes it 100x worse. But I also feel like that is a situation where it should be an unspoken rule that you leave other people alone. Like no one knows why you’re at that location (training facility, vet office etc) so it’s always seemed so bizarre to me that people choose that time to approach!"
puppy101,fd92oz7,t3_ek7i8i,1578227517.0,"I have a puppy in EXACTLY the same stage and I always say training would be going excellent if everyone else would just have a little respect for our space. Don’t even get me started on people who don’t/can’t recall their dog from mine. 

But with the stranger petting thing I am so tired of it that sorry but I have dropped a lot of my politeness but honestly I think sometimes you just need to be more direct. I’ll often move puppy to the side when people approach and have him sit directly in front of me and maintain my eye contact (this took a lot of practise to get solid but we’re really getting there). If people STILL move in to pet him I just say firmly no. I think if you have any more of a dialogue with rude people then they take that as license to argue. I don’t give them any space to argue with me because if someone is just standing there, back to you, staring at their dog saying no then I mean...that’s not the easiest thing to argue against IME."

puppy101,fcuzzzt,t1_fctx3k6,1577991876.0,"I actually agree and it concerns me that so many people here think this is fine. Aside from the fact that it’s not fair to leave a sociable animal alone for so long you’re missing out on hours of training opportunities for a puppy through the day and therefore general training could potentially be slower and more frustrating. Oh course dogs can fit in with a working schedule but considering leaving the dog alone for 9 hours five days a week is imo too much. Adding in sleeping this means the dog is alone for potentially 17 hours out of 24. Adding in all the other things humans need to do like shopping, cooking cleaning etc... How much quality time is actually left for the dog? 

I really wouldn’t be in a rush to stop the dog walker OP and I would be prepared to continue indefinitely to ensure good quality of life for your dog. We should be aiming for thriving not just surviving. I’m sure many dogs would cope with being left for hours but would they be happy, stress-free and reaching their full potential? I don’t know but I doubt it."
puppy101,fcuqzek,t1_fcucgp5,1577986726.0,"This is an excellent tip but with a small dog I have adjusted it a little and if the OP’s dog is small you might find this helpful—I have an across the body treat bag I use and I put a mix of kibble and stronger smelling beef strips in it. I only treat from the bag, even in the house so my boy knows exactly what that bag means. So when we’re walking and I want him right next to me I just rest my hand inside the bag and his attention is there and he will walk nicely beside me. It also keeps my hand in the right place so he doesn’t get ahead of me. He’s 8 months old now and as time goes by I can have my hands where I want them more but conditioning him to the bag has been really useful because he’s little so not so easy to show him a treat when we’re walking."

How do they know they will get along and it will fit in with their lifestyle before agreeing to owning it? What a crazy request even without the bizarre accusations of verbal abuse.

I also do birthday ice cream—we celebrate all the dog’s birthdays on the eldest dogs actual birthday (I have four dogs so I figure they can all share) and we always go to the farm shop and get an icecream cone for them to share. It’s nice to treat them on special occasions especially if like me you don’t feed treats through the year.

omad,fbtte8n,t1_fbt5odh,1577094843.0,In a way I agree—I give myself 3 days “off” over the holidays because I feel like celebrations are a legitimate time to enjoy food and togetherness and that there’s nothing wrong with that so long as I fast afterwards. That’s how we are “designed” to eat after all—feast and fast—however everyone is different and some people have a lot of emotions tied up in food and for some people mentally it’s not so easy to just hop back on. I think if someone genuinely doesn’t feel like they’re in a place where they can control their eating then they are entitled to do what they need to do to continue a healthier eating pattern and that family of all people should understand that struggle and be supportive. After all—no one is stopping them eating.
