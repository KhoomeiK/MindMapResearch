college,ff5p2yg,t3_erqvx7,1579604163.0,"People staying over without any “ground rules” set always tends to be a problem. Someone that rarely has people over will get upset about the electricity they use, the water etc. it’s best to discuss it before it becomes a problem. 

About the noise during sex. Yes she can hear you.
Think of ways to mask the noise, like running a box fan in your room or moving your bed to a different wall.  We used box fans in all rooms and they worked as white noise machines. 

If you can’t improve the noise coming out of your room then talk to her about it, when is it most likely to be disruptive to her and agree to not do it then. Most likely you’ll still want to have sex then and making an agreement will just annoy you."

college,femihsq,t3_epvyks,1579257293.0,"Most schools that professors can only overfill classes, the chain of command should be followed. For my school it’s instructor, chair, dean, provost office. At the chair level if they say no, you should ask if there would be a way to substitute a different course. 

Question and it does matter in these situations, why were you unable to register for this class on day one of your registration?"
college,femh4yk,t3_epwkz3,1579255258.0,"If it’s past the drop/100% refund date, the big question is will they allow you to withdraw, not get a W and get money back. Those would all involve exceptions to normal policy, you should ask you adviser how to ask for these exceptions."
college,fejiqef,t3_epfajq,1579176011.0,There is another secondary clause for degree revocation though which has no time constraints.  So it absolutely allows for this type of process beyond the normal code of conduct timeframe.

collegeadvice,fegon0h,t3_eoxf81,1579098851.0,"Yes, tell the colleges about your Learning Disability, they will provide you support during college. Start looking at the schools that interest you and have the major you want. Look at the requirements for admissions, talk to admissions advisers from those schools and decide which ones make sense to apply. There's plenty of school out there that you would get accepted to based on your scores and your openness to schools."
college,feg9doe,t3_eoz89d,1579083357.0,"Start by looking at eatrightpro.org. It shows how you can become an rd, I used to advise Health Science majors and for the most part it made more sense to go to a school with an RD program."
collegeadvice,feccjb7,t3_eoey34,1578970746.0,So it depends on your old schools rules. We have 2 years before they deactivate your enrollment. So any student that leaves for any reason can come back without reapplying as long as it’s within that 2 years.
college,fec1o2e,t3_eodo18,1578965351.0,"You can always go up the chain higher but they clearly feel that you had a chance to get sometime in the last 2 years. Maybe you could have prioritized it over the conflicting class. Or should have been asking your advisor what to do since the first semester that you missed taking it.  Either way if you hope someone higher up to step in, you will need proof that it wasn’t possible any other way."

collegeadvice,fe4bkr4,t3_enrxm4,1578857621.0,"Just graduate, then continue on to graduate school. Why spend more time and money just because your not enjoying your internship. Use it to learn how to give your best effort despite it not being the career you want. It help you develop some resilience, work ethic and appreciation for your future jobs. 15 weeks may seem like a long time but it’s not relatively speaking."
college,fe1raln,t3_enl4rf,1578829979.0,"If the hold is not legitimate, then raise hell but if it’s legit just get back on the waitlist and email the professor the proof of the situation. In the meantime,  start planning that you won’t be in the class. Most likely you’ll be unable to do anything to resolve it based on the described scenario."
college,fe1pla2,t3_enm4oa,1578829389.0,They will require you to send transcripts from all colleges you previously attended and evaluate the credits based on their own equivalencies. So there is a chance to get credit for courses at one school and not another. Most schools will have a database of searchable equivalencies somewhere on their website so you can see what will and won’t transfer. You should be using this to determine what classes to take especially if you’re not completing a degree before you transfer.
college,fe01h85,t3_enftin,1578800733.0,"My school won’t even let you in Trig without a C or better in College Algebra. Of course every school is different, but as an adviser I’d never recommend it."

college,fdzzrvi,t3_enhsnt,1578799668.0,"We offer classes based on need and professor availability. If you had enough students to fill the class show a true “need”, there’s a chance they would listen to your request. Still probably won’t get our department to offer it."
college,fdzz7mr,t3_enhsrw,1578799322.0,"Depends on the reason you can’t get in the course. If it’s a prerequisite, at my school this won’t help you at all. If it’s a full class it might work but more likely just annoy them."

It's one of the benefits of working in Higher Education, I get 50% of tuition for my family. Many schools offer even better discounts, a private school I worked at previously was free tuition for children of employees."
college,fdozbji,t3_emhvmx,1578616315.0,Most schools have time frames for cancelling classes but cancellations happen for all kinds of reasons beyond their control.

You will need documented proof of the issues but if you have been seeing a therapist they usually will write a letter if you ask."
collegeadvice,fdjp1us,t3_elpcax,1578481668.0,"Talk to the admissions office, they are the only people with experience in this situation at that school.

college,fcqxf1g,t3_eijc9z,1577893670.0,The best answer will come from your school. Hoping some automatic systems caused it and can be corrected once you talk to a human. It’s definitely shady if it’s real and they just lured you in for one semester. If that’s the case you need to talk to “a supervisor” all the way up until the fix the issue.
