nottheonion,ff4othf,t3_erbflf,1579568840.0,It's because it's true. EA made 1.2 billion in net revenue and still fired 350 employees Activision Blizzard fired 800.

anime,few6mbc,t1_few1u3i,1579406039.0,"I couldn't like it because the lyrics got drown out by the combination of the mixing and the way the singer sings.

It's not necessarily bad the singers voice is pretty and the music is pretty but it just was a disappointment to me  because if it was better I'm sure I would have had a reaction similar to everyone else. I would say it's fine not bad."
anime,fer85yx,t3_eqefqs,1579350990.0,I may be in the minority but I was underwhelmed by the whole Overhaul fight. I'm glad this is over and this was a neat episode. It feels like there were no losses to the Heros except Nighteye dying which is kind of disappointing because it kind of seems like they're getting a free pass and just killing a character that would be difficult to write around. Uri probably is going to disappear from the series because her ability is so strong.

anime,fer6kzw,t1_feqylgl,1579350505.0,I don't understand how it works. Because couldn't Uri rewind the effects of these bullets even if they were made with her own quirk. It doesn't really even make any sense how they made a bullet that rewinds the quirk but not the individual.
anime,fer65ku,t1_feqnijt,1579350358.0,I feel like the story would make no sense with Nighteye alive because he would constantly be predicting the future and it would just be a hindrance. It was a good gimmick for an arc but it's good they killed him off.
anime,fer5u31,t1_feqf1uz,1579350203.0,I'm extremely confused how this even happened. I thought his quirk allowed him to rebuild himself. How can he even lose an arm?

Depending on the type of rape arguablely the ascusation can cause more damage. Because it hurts the victims of rape as well as hurts an innocent person.

I would love a 4 day work week instead. If you being pressured to work a fuck ton of hours this will just benefit you and you might end up getting overtime pay for being forced to work on the week end.

Idk where they're getting that from. Crow is a synonym for all corvus. But saying all crovus are jackdraw is not what they're saying.

MurderedByWords,fdga8t5,t3_ekrew7,1578386847.0,"The law is on his side. The addendum they made again Nixon is so poorly worded that he can attack after our forces are attacked and that has been going on for awhile.

It's too bad that they didn't kick him out of office because this dumb monkey is starting a war with Iran to drum up support for his re-election.

It provides that the [president](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) can send the [U.S. Armed Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) into action abroad only by [declaration of war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States) by [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress), ""statutory authorization,"" or in case of ""a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.""

Therefore he can declare a national emergency and do whatever the fuck he wants. Iran has attacked our armed forces and possessions."
