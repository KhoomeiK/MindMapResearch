ontario,fetly2r,t1_fesyq30,1579376762.0,"I'm a flip flop voter myself, but voted NDP in 2018.

The problem is that people can't get past Bob Rae, and felt that the NDP were too radical or too hard left. So either the party swings to the centre and becomes liberal lite or gets seen as radical.

A really common discussion I heard during the election was people liking Andrea Horwath, but thinking the NDP were too radical. So they went with a ""devil you know (better)"" decision and voted Tory. A lot of folks figured the OPC would reign in Ford, as well, but it's a problem with policy."
