Also there is far more mutual benefit in trade. 

Prior to the industrial revolution economic power was tied directly on how much productive land was available to a state and the only way to grow the economy was to increase the amount of productive land the state had. there were 2 main ways to do this, first to do as the Dutch and the Russ and make more land by reclamation from the sea in the Dutch case or to colonise waste lands as the Russ did in Siberia however there is only so mutch tgat can be done in that department. The second and more likely way is to just take the productive land from ones neighbours. 

After the industrial revolution the economic strength became disconnected from the land and trade became among the most important factors in growing the economy and as technology has devloped and trade has become more interlinked invading another country has begun to go from a benefit to a loss unfortunately it has taken a long time for the old thinking to catch up with the new reality."
