I immediately offered to come pick her up, to which she didnt respond (found out later she basically made it up and was outside for maybe a minute). Another time, she ended up in hospital for a week or so and i was her only friend to visit. 

When it was my turn to need support and i asked if i could crash at her place for the night, she totally ghosted me. She really let me down. she is not my friend anymore."

awfuleverything,fedm4ng,t1_fedkjbe,1579014900.0,"idk if you really wanna get into it, id say men are worse drivers. theyre prone to speeding, driving riskier + more prone to tailgate and by extension, road rage. theyre also more likely to drink and drive. most accidents are caused by men as well. 

i think the stereotype comes from women being less experienced behind the wheel, maybe less confident too so that can cause accidents. 

but yeah women are bad at driving ^/s"

it is sad that someone would give their disability to say their name, but as i explained in a comment above, they are lonely people, they probably dont deserve to be mocked because im sure they already feel pretty bad about themselves and may be at risk of suicide. at least that one (albeit transactional) ""relationship"" gives them comfort, otherwise they wouldnt spend so much, so the work is clearly valuable to some."
