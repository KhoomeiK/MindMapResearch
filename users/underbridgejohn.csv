Needafriend,ffcdvfq,t3_esuz1w,1579797342.0,"I’m sorry things didn’t work out. I feel like I messed up some of my relationships too. Yet I’m ranting too (sorry). I feel like I failed at life. I’m 19 years old, and about a year ago when I turned 18 I received a $100k payment, and managed to blow through it in 90 days. I received that much because I’m Native American (and we’re an oppressed population etc.) I still get like 400/month for being native but I spiraled downward this last year with drugs/alcohol, can’t hold a job, and then ended up being 10 thousand dollars in debt. I’m in a town I really don’t care for, really feel like crap and I’m too afraid to commit Suicide, although I feel dead already. I made some big mistakes in life. I’m angry with the world, for being born, for putting me in this craphole of a planet. Why me? What do you know about being too afraid to live, and being too afraid to die?"
