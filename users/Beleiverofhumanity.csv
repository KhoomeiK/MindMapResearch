AskReddit,fcjlaw3,t3_ehg5ac,1577692307.0,"Not me but my parents. When I was a kid we won  free dinner at a restaurant, I don't remember much details but we had to listen to an offer they had in a separate dining area with a lot of people (sort of having their own mini meetings). 

They offered club membership that we could use to go on an island vacation, used a famous celebrity as the advertise, had a friendly agent etc. It was very well done. I remember being so enchanted by the idea.

I don't know how but my mom confided with agent about her mothers loss at that time and they even exchanged FB. I felt that the agent really sympathized. At first we couldn't afford the offer but they kept lowering it up to the point it was ridiculously way less than before. But they kept refusing(kid me was so disappointed). I asked them why they refused and I remember them saying how everyone in the dining room kept looking over suspiciously. Probably moreso observation than gut but still a good reminder of the if its too good to be true quote."
