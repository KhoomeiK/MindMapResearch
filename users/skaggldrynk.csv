I was lying in bed on an air mattress because I had recently moved, the main light was off but I had these purple string lights on the wall I was facing and I was looking at them and I felt like I had not fallen asleep yet, I felt totally lucid. Then I felt like my butt was slipping off the bed a bit, so I went to pull myself more onto the mattress, but I realized I couldn’t move and that feeling of absolute dread took over as something grabbed my foot and dragged me off the mattress, across my room and into my dark closet. I just tried desperately to move my fingers and was finally able to move a bit and I woke up on the mattress in the same position I was in before that bullshit happened.
