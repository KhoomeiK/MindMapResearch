ElizabethWarren,ffaciqz,t1_ff9cqut,1579732317.0,"Thanks for explaining, I understand now."
ElizabethWarren,ffa5zgc,t1_ff9p6kr,1579728548.0,Yeah I'm still confused. I've only ever known him for good stuff.
YouShouldKnow,ff9k5lr,t1_ff9ih1x,1579714722.0,Intuit. We need to remind everyone that Intuit owns TurboTax along with a million other products and wouldn't suffer much if one of them died due to new laws.
ElizabethWarren,ff9ap8u,t1_ff97im9,1579708676.0,I'm confused - why are people made at him for primarying?
ElizabethWarren,ff9al8b,t1_ff9317d,1579708606.0,"Why? I don't know enough to have an opinion here, but would like to know."
churning,ff8oeb2,t1_ff8ji4h,1579688798.0,This is it.
schnauzers,ff8ocxk,t1_ff8l2tv,1579688741.0,I feel nothing but sadness when I see clipped ears.
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ff20fnu,t3_er6pmn,1579490495.0,"That's correct. Getting pre-approval doesn't mean they've fully underwritten your loan, which is when they check all the proof of income and debt."
Cleveland,fenf8yn,t1_felnzy1,1579283420.0,"This isn't true and TJs and Aldi's are literally the same company models, created by the same family."
MiniatureSchnauzer,fejzuky,t1_fejn0r4,1579189580.0,Yeah it's worth it to me.
MiniatureSchnauzer,fejfbe4,t3_epd2ct,1579171424.0,Is there anything preventative we can do on top of brushing? Like a professional yearly cleaning?
Cleveland,feghpxz,t1_fefl1z3,1579093122.0,"Thanks for this advice, I didn't know any of this!"
Cleveland,fed89aq,t1_febk7g5,1579003370.0,I can't understand those outdated homes selling for so much. We've been looking on and off for a few years and the options on the west side of Cleveland compared to options in other Midwest cities are so terrible. So much old stuff selling for a lot.
progresspics,fed83co,t1_fecw9yt,1579003181.0,You are awesome.
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fed6v0o,t1_feckwg4,1579001691.0,Pre-approval is usually just a credit check.
ElizabethWarren,fed5phr,t3_eofemj,1579000162.0,I have a monthly donation going. In it till the end.
RealEstate,fe7tc9l,t1_fdxpnk9,1578919055.0,This is good insight. Thanks for sharing.
RealEstate,fe7t44h,t1_fdyhl10,1578918976.0,"Seems like a huge oversight, why wouldn't they raise the barrier to entry to maintain the integrity of the profession and the ability to earn a living?"
Cleveland,fe7sgml,t1_fe6lv2t,1578918731.0,Maybe you don't know how to buy produce. I've been buying aldi produce for 10 years.
science,fe7nvh7,t1_fe6hviy,1578917202.0,It's not hereditary but if you talk to those in the MS community they'll tell you that science simply hasn't yet proven it's hereditary. I knew a family were four of them had MS and doctors continue to tell them it's just coincidence. Nah.
ynab,fe5cw6n,t1_fe1zxd8,1578867790.0,Reconciling is so important. I forgot to do it for several months and much to my dismay I owed so much more than I thought I did
Cleveland,fe1rfgp,t1_fdy3kap,1578830043.0,That's fucked up.
Cleveland,fe1rbu1,t1_fdzu4cc,1578829995.0,"I worked for Aldi for 2 years in college. Their product comes from the same farms and manufacturers and we always laugh about people who think otherwise. I also worked in a factory that produced the same products for Aldi and other groceries, all they did was change out the label."
bestoflegaladvice,fe1ofr2,t1_fdztyg0,1578829059.0,"Unless, of course, the intention was in fact to steal the item"
RealEstate,fdwsgsa,t1_fdw2d60,1578761946.0,"The house eventually sold, so someone clearly managed to do it. We offered lower because we discovered most of the house was still on knob & tube outside of the major appliances and the rework was going to be incredibly expensive. In the end it was a good outcome, we'd never consider knob & tube in a home purchase today."
RealEstate,fdvp74n,t1_fdv2lsw,1578749962.0,I agree dude it sucks. I like the advice in this thread to go with someone who does realty full time. I'm gonna make sure I do that next time. This person was just doing it part time and I learned my lesson quick.
RealEstate,fdv1avt,t1_fdu62d8,1578741947.0,"You're literally replying to a comment that says 90% of agents can't even make a full time living with today's rates, and you want them to go down?"
RealEstate,fdv0nmy,t1_fduhzwb,1578741806.0,"Bad response times, lack of good intuition, terrible negotiation skills. One time we had an agent tell us a house would sell by the weekend and we needed to make an offer immediately. The house was on the market close to 300 days and it was winter. Needless to say, it didn't sell for a long time and they rejected our very fair offer because our agent did zero negotiating on our behalf."
RealEstate,fdmvezi,t1_fdm7hnq,1578567635.0,You can't sell back to the grid everywhere unfortunately. Power companies are being really dickish about this.
ynab,fdfky9d,t1_fdey2vu,1578364114.0,"I'm so confused by this response. All of my future payments are listed in ynab, including my running balance."
personalfinance,fd2sklx,t1_fd2jmpz,1578151276.0,"Thanks so much - long way to go, still have a lot to pay off but the gamification and using [undebt.it](https://undebt.it) w/ YNAB has really changed our lives. We had credit card debt + car loans + student loans, a total of around $130k. Planned payoff is in 2.5 yrs, it's grueling but worth it."
personalfinance,fd2dkkz,t1_fd0d4ob,1578145676.0,"Hey - fellow undebt it user here, since signing up a year ago i've wiped out nearly 40k. Good luck."
Ulta,fcza4l7,t1_fctgm25,1578096760.0,"In my experience the best time to get a raise is when you're taking a new job - employers (on all ends of the spectrum unfortunately, even in high paying jobs) don't like giving raises when you're already employed because they're leaning on the fact that changing jobs is hard and they're betting you're not gonna do it."
Ulta,fcz9qr8,t1_fcyonit,1578096532.0,"That's an incredibly naive take - you can be fired for no reason in most states, and proving you were fired for anything but is nearly impossible without explicit evidence."
ynab,fcvth90,t3_ej2k64,1578009733.0,"People have already said what I came here to say, which is you have to grow your income. You can't go back in time and change the debt, but you can change your future by working now to make more money. There are a million ways to do this, and a lot of variables to consider. If you want to tell us what you currently do for work, maybe we can help you figure out a good trajectory to a better income."
Cleveland,fcvkbpi,t1_fcvjchz,1578003931.0,"Aldi pays $12.50 minimum, $13.50 on Sundays. It's still low."
povertyfinance,fcu0j32,t1_fcrnobm,1577968308.0,Makes sense - I'm an introvert and really need bouts of silence in my day or I get drained.
Lastpass,fcq1dud,t3_eigs7e,1577876632.0,"You have to have an active password on your phone and biometrics enabled to unlock your phone. If both of these are not enabled, you can't use it for last pass"

povertyfinance,fcq05f0,t1_fcpbb3t,1577875905.0,But I bet the stress is lower.
povertyfinance,fcq03hg,t1_fcp8m4p,1577875868.0,"This is something that kills me. I am the most ""successful"" one in my family but half of them don't even pay rent and just have endless disposable income. Meanwhile I'm drowning in student debt repayment (paying extra) and they still all act like I'm somehow rich and should therefore be forced to be the savior for everyone else's bad spending"
Ulta,fcotcrq,t3_eiazmd,1577841008.0,"You should create a Google form and link it here so people can answer anonymously. That way you don't make people go out of their way to email you which gives you their personal contact info. 


Additionally, just from the sound of this, you might be treading into collective bargaining territory and as an FYI, it will more than likely get you fired. It's best to use market data and your own skills to ask for a raiswe, never to bring up your expenses or what others make (I hate it too, but that's capitalism)."
GooglePixel,fcn0cgz,t1_fcmzo26,1577799524.0,"I mean, good for you I guess? With the number of leaks/hacks happening, the only way to keep your shit secure is to change your passwords often."
povertyfinance,fcmym3o,t1_fcfytmu,1577797794.0,"I can't stress this enough - please apply anyway. I didn't qualify for much when I applied because of my savings, but I still got some help and it was so worth it."
sousvide,fcmykc9,t1_fcgn0ev,1577797742.0,Thanks so much for these tips! I definitely overblend!

GooglePixel,fcj04vz,t1_fci0wt4,1577673986.0,You need a password manager. LastPass works with biometrics. it'll automatically fill in the logins for all of your banking apps.

povertyfinance,fc15s2f,t1_fc0anhj,1577309061.0,It's absolutely insane that you can't see the cognitive dissonance in the words coming out of your mouth. You're talking about your kids being fed as if housing or shelter are not just as critical of requirements. And you're bringing another life into this world to do the same thing too. Insanity.
povertyfinance,fc15k6e,t1_fc00l6n,1577308882.0,This is a mess of a comment and I really hope you find some clarity and maybe some discipline. Stop getting pregnant when you can't afford to take care of your family.
povertyfinance,fc15hlb,t1_fc1456d,1577308824.0,It's absolutely wild that the argument is about abortion and not The fact that they are bringing even more kids into this fucked up cycle of homelessness and hard times. It's insanity. Everyone should be able to have kids if they want to. No one should be able to keep popping them out because of some fucked up BS belief system. It's just fucking wrong.
