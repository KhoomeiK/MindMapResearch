LucidDreaming,ff98v40,t1_ff96w43,1579707524.0,"everyone has been describing there experiences in the night. I have never been able to do that. It doesn't matter how much i try i will end up falling asleep without realising. I think the reason my experience is nothing like what you and some others are describing is I had just woke up so i was very easily able to fall back asleep quickly. whereas in the night the process takes longer. I frequently experience hypnagogic hallucinations and every now and then i will have really vivid ones, almost like a half dream state, but i always fall asleep without realising."
LucidDreaming,ff958n4,t1_ff94ln7,1579705143.0,"yeah i didn't need to do any reality checks when it happened to me. i just knew. but it seems everyone's experience is different. while i just popped into the dream world in a transition that lasted a matter of seconds, you felt like you were rotating and another comment said they felt like they were floating."

I didn't realise I wasn't on this  account (ignore NSFW in the name, we don't mention what I use it for). Anyway I was just saying the only luck is that the bullet actually hit.

webdev,fdott4p,t1_fdot4va,1578612714.0,"Java script is a programming language case and html are not. Css and html display information on the screen. There is no logic to it, it just displays information and styles it. I have just started learning css and it is a little more complicated than html but practice makes perfect. As for Java script well that is a programming language meaning there is logic, conditionals, if statements, variables etc. In my opinion programming languages are actually quite easy to learn in the sense that you don't have to remember all of the different tags or attributes of html or css. You just remember the functionality of different statements and how to use them and eventually you will start to apply them in your own projects without realising."

gaming,fcxj3wu,t3_ejel20,1578064195.0,"prey for my sister, seriously. so my sister was watching my 6 year old nephew play the spyro game and the first thing she said was ""This is a game i would actually play, because it's not violent."" Now i have no problem with people not playing violent video games because they personally don't like them but my sisters tone of voice said otherwise. it sounded as if she thought violent video games are the reason for all the worlds problems, as if she genuinely thought shooting someone in a game is equivalent to committing every single crime. that one sentence made me think she would be someone heavily influenced by mainstream media when she is older.

oh and the way she looked at me when she said it was also as if to say ""you would never play this game, all you play is games with guns and shooting."" Which is not true. Seriously prey for my sister."
modernwarfare,fcurcro,t3_eiwoxk,1577986934.0,"to anyone saying ""this is so me"" and stuff like that i can promise you, you don't have it nearly as bad as me. i started playing cod on black ops 3 and after about 3 months of black ops 3 my luck in all games just went downhill at a 90 degree angle. i can not tell you how many times this has happened to me over the course of the past 4 or so years in every single shooter game i have played since then. you think 25 seconds is long. in black ops 4 i held a head glitch for 7 minutes 56 seconds and the split second i looked away, after seeing literally no one straight down the middle of the map for almost 8 minutes, the entire team walked out and i died within half a second of looking away. seriously i am so unlucky at video games that you need to see my gameplays to believe it. otherwise it looks like i am begging for attention, which i assure you i am not. I have 500 second places on fortnite and not a single win. 75 games played on blackout, 50 second places not a single win. first and only game i ever played on pubg, second place. first and only game i played on h1z1, second place. choked multiple nukes. black ops 4 kd 0.99 every single time i got it even 1 kill positive overall with multiple days of tryharding and going positive every game i immediately went on a negative streak and dropped back to negative overall."

I'm not saying the times are inaccurate I'm just saying that because I don't know how it was timed and only you know. but they do seem very fast."
