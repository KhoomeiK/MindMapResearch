They don't maintain 1g constantly but any gravity helps. Beyond that they have sci-fi meds that help maintain bone density and health. As previously mentioned, there is a small gym in the roci with resistance band-style training. Hope this helps!"
trumpet,ff258an,t3_er6al3,1579494153.0,Don't forget to disinfect your mouthpiece and lysol the outside of your trumpet!
FREE,ff1t5te,t3_er31c0,1579485611.0,This is such a sweet thing to be doing. How did you end up with all of these extra keys?
trumpet,fefez0o,t1_feeygay,1579054907.0,"WELL DAMN. Thanks, bud! Now I have a word for it. Do you think it's just like a soft, incomplete tongue to do the same thing for trumpet?"
trumpet,fee8som,t3_eook9n,1579028757.0,Don't feel bad. We just read a piece that had slurred staccato.
trumpet,fe4ev5a,t3_enpvfe,1578858537.0,"Just a guess, but I bet that while switching from bone to trumpet, a larger mouthpiece will feel more normal. For trumpeters, the larger mouthpieces have a better sound but are more tiring to play on. I would try to borrow a couple from some band friends and warm up and play on different mouthpieces to see what strikes a good balance of endurance, sound, and control. If you dont have the time to practice a lot of trumpet, a smaller mouthpiece might give you a better range and more endurance for playing."

trumpet,fdl99lk,t3_elusbv,1578519214.0,Quality shitpost. Thank you for the chuckle and yes that is 100% how you play any and all trumpets.
trumpet,fcratn7,t3_eifd42,1577899273.0,"Is that mouthpiece attached? Is that a first valve slide...valve? Fantastic looking horn, I'd love to hear how it sounds."
college,fcrac0m,t3_eih4bb,1577899067.0,Pull the trigger. This is doable and a great investment into your future success. Make sure you keep a consistent sleep schedule and try to grab/make fresh food occasionally. Good luck and have fun!
college,fcaqu4c,t1_fcaf8k4,1577574781.0,Definitely do it. Any and all honors should be included.
trumpet,fc2ubde,t3_efvx95,1577374254.0,"Your left hand supports the weight of the trumpet. Ideally, you should hold the trumpet in your left hand in such a way that you can manipulate both the 1st and 3rd valve tuning slides.

 For most trumpet players this means thumb in the 1st valve tuning slide and their ring finger/4th finger in the third valve tuning slide.

When holding it this way you can put your index, middle, and pinkie fingers wherever you want. Just find a comfortable spot. For most people that will mean your index and middle resting against the valves and supporting the trumpet. 

If this isn't working for you, find a way to hold/support your horn with your index and middle finger that feels natural and go from there. Your third valve tuning slide ring should be adjustable so you can move it around until it feels comfortable to use in whatever grip you go with."
college,fc2t92g,t3_efuoa3,1577373381.0,"Dont be uncomfortable taking the classes you need to succeed! Check with your academic advisor to make sure you're allowed to enroll in them and then go back as far as you are uncomfortable. Math is hard enough as it is, dont make it more difficult by not mastering the fundamentals. Knowing it well enough to get past the math placement test isn't necessarily knowing it well enough to thrive in a math heavy degree."
college,fc2d1nc,t3_efsmfi,1577353048.0,"Notetaking: Some classes will post the lecture slides before class. Read them before class or have them up during lecture. When you are writing your notes this way you can spend more time writing down your thoughts, questions, and observations rather than copying down what the professor is saying.

Preclass reading: Most syllabi will have a rough outline of what material you're covering in which class days. Even if you are bad at studying, reading the material and taking some preliminary notes can really help with your comprehension in lecture. I would say that, besides practicing material for tests, consistently reading the material before its presented is one of the best ways of retaining the information.

Postclass: Read over your notes, did you have any unanswered questions, any processes or explanations that were confusing? Look up solutions for them, find answers. if you cant, shoot a quick, professional email to your professor or mark your calendar with the question you have and the next office hours for that class. This is a great time to try some practice problems and to test your knowledge. 

TLDR: Gain as much exposure as you can. your odds of understanding and retaining information go up the more often you see it. Try to organize what you're learning into a cohesive story. Good luck and have fun!"
