He (unknowingly) entered into a positive one: ate a healthy meal, felt good so decided to run, felt good so decided to take a nice soothing bath, felt good so decided to sleep early, no TV, felt good so decided to not snooze, felt good so decided to clean room.... the previous thing giving momentum and energy to the next. Inertia.

Most people are however stuck in negative feedback loops. They waste time so they feel bad. They waste more time to relieve the bad feelings. Which causes more bad feelings, then more time wasted (or bad eating etc)..."

Although you never really 'beat' (or cure, or end, or defeat etc) depression with it. You *manage* it. You learn to live with it.

Isn't finding a cure better? Isn't 'managing it' just like a consolation prize? 

Maybe. But after 15+ years with depression, this is the best I have found. 

With mindfulness, you aren't aiming at fixing anything. There is no trying to be any different than you are (fake smiley person), no 'faking it til you make it'. You are just creating space between the thoughts, feelings and emotions of depression, and your reaction.

Example:

Without mindfulness: You walk into a coffeeshop and you feel down and negative for no reason. You think you *should* be happy because it's sunny, you're healthy, you're about to get a treat, etc, but you're not. You buy a coffee, barely acknowledging the worker and leave.

With mindfulness: You walk into a coffeeshop and you feel down and negative for no reason. You think you *should* be happy because it's sunny, you're healthy, you're about to get a treat, etc, but you're not. You stop, take a second to observe that thought. You listen like it's a sound occuring outside you. Like it's a news ticker that just presented itself. Data. You take a second to feel the negative energy. Observe it. Like its this tangible thing you can look at. ""Hmm, look it's that depressive feeling again. It hurts"". You do not judge it as good or bad. It just is. You just look at it. You buy a coffee, make a decision about acknowledging the worker, you decide not to, and leave.

The only difference between the two scenarios is you are creating space to *respond* to life's situations and inner happenings, rather than always *reacting.* 

Depression makes you feel like a prisoner to bad emotions. Am I right? You lack liberty to just be. For me, freedom comes simply by observing my depression, looking at it like it's a thing, not judging yourself about it. Those things ARE NOT YOU. Mindfulness teaches you that. It won't magically make these go away (that's key), it just lets you not be so stifled by it, so bogged and beat down.

From here, I strongly recommend:

Someone else mentioned that instinctively/reflexively being negative is not a habit.. well it depends on how you define it. If habits are purely action based behaviors (mindless scrolling on your phone, eating sugar, biting nails...) then yes, but the way I see and understand it, habits are mentally pre-programmed reactions to certain cues. For you, you have a wired reaction of being negative as a reaction to certain situations. We could go deep and get to the source of that reflex (indeed you should, such could be an aim of therapy), but for now I'll offer the best tool I've come across.

Mindfulness.

With mindfulness, you aren't aiming at fixing anything. There is no trying to be any different than you are, no 'faking it'. You are just creating space between the cue or stimulus, and your reaction.

With mindfulness: You walk into a coffeeshop and you feel down and negative for no reason. You stop, take a second to observe the negative energy, like its this thing you can look at. You do not judge it as good or bad. It just is. You just look at it curiously. You buy a coffee, make a decision about acknowledging the worker, you decide not to, and leave.

The only difference between the two scenarios is you are creating space to *respond* to life's situations, rather than always *reacting.* The way I am reading your text shows you crave freedom. This is what you mean by 'bad habits' - you are a prisoner to your impulses. So you want freedom from negative viewpoints, negative self-reflections. Freedom comes simply by observing all that, looking at it like it's a thing, not judging yourself about it. Those things ARE NOT YOU. Mindfulness teaches you that. It won't magically make these go away, it just lets you not be so bogged down and identified with all that.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcvL230sBso&t=63s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcvL230sBso&t=63s) 

The jist is that our modern day habits and pleasure removes our incentive to want to exert effort (so you get that *I just don't feel like it* feeling every time you try). 

Focus on removing your vices, your bad habits. Just do that. You can do this, not by relying on willpower, but by developing a different perspective on that's centered on actively decreasing the desire you have for your vices (I've written about this [here](https://www.endofvice.com/free-ebook), if you are interested in an unconventional method).

That's my advice. In case you weren't looking for advice and you just wanted to vent and see if anyone can relate... yes 1000%.

Best of luck"
getdisciplined,fc09ds8,t3_eff7ki,1577283871.0,"You're trying to beat your addiction using willpower. But here's the thing: by resisting your urges; by making declarations, pacts with yourself and resolutions to quit... by locking away sweets or downloading apps aimed at controlling habits… you are subconsciously reinforcing over and over that what you are resisting is highly desirable, worthy, pleasurable and positive. Sugar is now taboo, and has earned a elusive,forbidden quality. You are set to think about it more, to want it more, which leads to intensified visceral  cravings. 

I think you could profit by seeing your habit in a different way. I suggest this book:  [https://www.amazon.com/Good-Sugar-Bad-yourself-addiction/dp/1784282391](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Sugar-Bad-yourself-addiction/dp/1784282391) 

Allen Carr thesis is that people normally have such a hard time quitting addictions through conventional means because when they put on the ‘I just quit X vice’ mentality, they put themselves in a position of seeing their past experiences of indulging as something they once loved and cherished, like a delightful pleasure. When the pangs of dopamine and serotonin withdrawal arrive (as another commenter pointed out), and it is extremely uncomfortable, sugar addicts think to themselves, subconsciously at least…. *is this what my life will be like now? Is this how it's going to feel as a non-sugar-eater? This feeling…this… awful sensation… aargh... this sucks... I hate being a non-sugar eater... maybe don't want to be one after all. What was I thinking?*  

 This negative attitude towards living a life of sacrificing your one little pleasure and crutch amidst an endless conveyor belt of life's stresses and pressures and worries, of course now amplified due to pleasure withdrawal, will make you blind and even willfully ignorant of the benefits of being a non-sugar-eater. You feel miserable.... and your misery as a new non-sugar-eater will further solidify and confirm the subconscious notion that life as a non-sugar-eater is a miserable, dull and shitty existence. 

Each time you quit, you end up doubling your desire for chocolate. The desire keeps increasing with time.

 So, to continue resisting the urges, to make it beyond day 1, then day 2, then day 3... you need to have more and more and more of an ability to resist the growing and growing and growing desire (willpower).  

Eventually...you will give in… the agony of withholding yourself from this all consuming desire will be too much…you just won't have the willpower. At that moment, a convenient little rationalization will present itself and you will give up on the attempt. 

And that's not bad enough as it is. There's more… when you do give in, the pleasure of the vice, the feeling of relief, of ending the cold misery…. It feels better than ever. The pleasure is like 10x amplified… i'm sure you know the feeling.

This heightened pleasure will of course further solidify in your mind that sugar is something good in your life … something highly desirable… something smart, justifiable and rational. Something worth desiring and craving, and grabbing impulsively when given the opportunity. 

...

The key is to unlearn what'a programmed into your brain (that sugar is this great desirable thing, that you have to... *sigh*... sacrifice) and see it for what it is: a wolf in sheep's clothes; a huge burden to your life with NO benefits or advantages. That's a huge shift; not something you can decide in a snap. I'd start with the book (it's centered on disproving what you think are its benefits), then add in mindfulness to really observe exactly whats going on with sugar. Is it really that pleasurable, or is it really just good at relieving an unbearable craving; a craving caused by the last time you ate it?"
selfhelp,fc077g6,t1_fbzy4yc,1577281508.0,"Fair enough. Tough to gage those kinds of details, and I didn't mean to imply you see yourself as perfect (in person interactions are better for that respect). I've been on the receiving end of lousy behavior and it plain sucks, no way around that.

My advice was meant to be generic; as in, in general, people could do well to take a step back and take a bit more responsibility for the circumstances in their lives. Not so applicable to your situation perhaps.

Much love!"
selfhelp,fbzxets,t3_efehhl,1577266868.0,"Sorry to hear about all that.

You should consider a third option: take responsibility and seek to understand their point of view. Seek to learn exactly what happened, how you could do better.

I know it hurts. I know your ego wants to get back (either by icing them out of your life, or by being confrontational). That's fine, but I think you'll learn eventually (sorry if I'm being patronizing) that life is 10000x best lived when you take responsibility for everything and use your experiences to learn and better yourself. That doesn't mean to take blame for other's poor behaviour, it just means looking at things objectively, seeking all the information, and using that info to best yourself. You seem to have high expectations from other people (what exactly are 'boundaries' other than rules of behaviour). You might find it useful to let go a bit. Seek to understand, rather than be understood. All the best to you."

I can't promise you the thrills and excitement you dreamed of having while in the thick of your dream life pursuit. But one thing I'm sure of, you're better off having gone through with this experience. Most people have a dream, and they half\-ass the attempt and give up too soon, or they keep procrastinating and waiting for the right moment to take the leap. They then live the rest of their life in regret and asking what if? You won't have that burden. You won't have your dream, but you won't have the burden.

You had the balls and work ethic to attempt at something big and you failed. I respect that. A lot.

Good luck pal."
