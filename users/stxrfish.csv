dating_advice,fe6rpkn,t3_enyo5u,1578902239.0,"Ahhh lmao. You're overthinking this as some kind of social media game. It's OK, everyone does. I'm a huge proponent of being completely honest with people. If you're gonna ""double snap"" him, just ask him if he wants to go on a date or if he's interested in you romantically! Stop putting yourself through mind games and rip the bandaid off. Snap and messaging makes it hard to tell how people really feel bc some people communicate differently over snap and stuff."

askwomenadvice,fe6psd2,t3_enptvp,1578899747.0,"Ask her how she masturbates. If she has never masturbate before, maybe suggest that she try it out. Sex is better for women once they've figured out their own bodies because we all get off differently. Then she can tell you how she wants it.

On the tight thing, is she a virgin? I can speak from experience that some women have unusually enclosed hymens that she might want to break on her own or have a gynecologist do it. My hymen used to be too enclosed for me to fit more than one finger through so I decided to break it myself before having penetrative sex for the first time."

I'm 19f and I love my bf (21m) to death but it's like he can't hold a deep or intellectual conversation and I don't know how to approach him about it :/ he is very talkative but will switch topics very quickly. When I express an opinion or belief I have with him he also kinda just agrees or makes a lighthearted joke about the topic. Let me know how you're handling this.

The solar eclipse is no different, if less harmful because the sun is partially blocked.

nextfuckinglevel,fcmdrmh,t1_fcm5tah,1577771637.0,"Right! American culture is shitty. The lack of stringent gun regulations increases the circulation of guns. ""good guys"" having guns and stopping a shooter, like this guy, is such a rare occurance that it is statistically insignificant. America has a higher rate of homicide per capita than nations with similar gdp but higher gun regulations. Then again, no country is as gun obsessed than the US. However, gun control is still common sense. 

Why should we expect citizens to be armed and trained for situations like these, as if we lived in a state of war? Especially children in school, children! Are children and teachers supposed to be expert marksmen? We need to mitigate the problem from the root. I don't want to feel like I have to carry a gun around, AND be trained to use it expertly, in case some crazy person starts shooting into the crowd. That logic is ridiculous and outdated."
terriblefacebookmemes,fcll5g2,t1_fcl0mtz,1577750344.0,My theory is that all the gender roles probably made the way people viewed dating really unhealthy back then. Men and women had all these expectations of each other to fulfill these roles and therefore they had less time to focus on chemistry and healthy relationships and other stuff. Anything divergent like gay marriage or promiscuity was looked down upon so people also had a fucked up sense of their sexuality which I think takes a toll.
HairDye,fckcfb4,t3_ehkfzv,1577722190.0,"I don't bleach my hair but my arctic fox dye lasts for about a month (well I use arctic fox violet dream and manic panic blue moon). Before you dye, wash your hair thoroughly with just shampoo to get it rlly dry and porous. Wait for it to dry completely and when you dye it, make sure to lay each strand on your hand or foil and massage it in on both sides. Let it sit for as long as possible, no harm in having it in too long (I usually go 5-8 hours). Then I wash it out with cold water and get some conditioner in there (dye fades faster with dry hair). My hair is very thick so I put a lot of coconut oil and argan oil based products in after I shower. I wash my hair every 3 days with lukewarm water. If you could figure out how to wash your hair less frequently (check out curly girl method/cowashing) or use less heating products like flat irons and blow dryers, that helps a lot."

amiugly,fccnxmh,t1_fc81mkr,1577600583.0,"Maybe this is true about their design but they still work. I met my bf using a dating app and it's the best relationship I've ever had. I know so many people with successful relationships from them!! Not for everyone but it could work if you give it a try. In theory, you're just opening your horizons to new people in your area so why would it not work?"
amiugly,fccmngv,t1_fc8czrt,1577600169.0,"Met my amazing bf on Bumble and have never used any other apps so I will biasedly recommend it. This is because there's no way I could judge my attraction to someone solely from a picture and brief bio. Bumble makes serious dating much easier because you can list your values (religion, wanting kids, smoking, etc) immediately, and I can just filter through them. For each person I swiped through, I read all the questions they answered and was able to get an idea of their personality. I hate how dating apps made for college-aged ppl like me are so ""quick"" and lack the space to even put info about yourself, but bumble actually lets you do that."
amiugly,fccmb0f,t3_egqfuf,1577600057.0,"I think there's a huge difference between pretty vs ugly and attractive. I think I could be attracted to anyone who holistically expresses themselves and has good chemistry with me. Someone could be drop-dead gorgeous and I wouldn't be attracted to them if I met them if I was turned off by their personality. Someone could be naturally very ugly, but they physically express themselves through piercings, tattoos, etc and are smoooth and Id be attracted to them. I find androgynous people who are beautiful from an andro standpoint but conventionally ugly from a male or female standpoint. Attraction is very intuitive and hard to define physical or social parameters."
amiugly,fccl341,t3_egnkun,1577599640.0,"I find it rlly attractive when people are super expressive. Your piercings and makeup are fire. So is the tattoo on your shoulder, it looks really cool and I wish I could see the rest of it!

For the sake of conventional beauty, I think your nose and cheek piercings suit your longer face shape well, but the placement of your lower lip piercings are a bit unflattering and draw the width of your lips inward. There's a difference between ugly vs pretty and attractiveness to me so I still think all your piercings are attractive, even if some aren't ""pretty"", if that makes any sense (which is why I kind of hate this sub)."

nihilism,fc7nuwp,t1_fc6qtym,1577513760.0,"The article you attached is a valid opinion article but I am quite confused because it opposes your argument. The author agrees that climate change is real and we need to reduce greenhouse gasses, but he disapproves of alarmist/exaggeration strategies that activists use to push these changes. While I disagree with his perspective (I personally believe alarmism is the only way we can get people/politicians to actually make changes), I do see that he is coming from a place of science and misinformation about climate shouldn't be spread, even if it calls for change. However, I do wholeheartedly agree to disagree with you. Just because there is some economic benefit in something, doesn't make it a scam. That logic doesn't complete the picture for me. Universities also benefit tremendously from investments in fossil fuel companies, which is luckily just starting to change.

Side note: I would never ever use the term ""propoganda"" to discredit anything. The idea of propoganda is the spread of an agenda. Sharing viewpoints (or having an ""agenda"") on complex issues is very important, and if the ""propaganda"" is well-researched, cited, and makes strong points, I see nothing wrong with it. I feel you man, people use the word propaganda if they're too lazy to argue with someone else's perspective.

This argument has strayed far from the intersection of nihilism and environmentalism but I'm cool with it."
nihilism,fc6pim4,t1_fc6h4qj,1577486220.0,"Large fossil fuel companies take advantage of climate change for greenwashing without making any major changes and continuing to build environmentally destructive infrastructure and plants. Climate change is an anthropogenic, scientific phenomenon that any reasonable individual should accept as a fact, so if you actually don't believe in climate change, I can't even argue with you if you don't believe in a fundamental scientific convention. The entire world did not fabricate it for the sake of fossil fuel companies who have tons of infrastructure and a shit load of oil at their disposal, who are doing just fine and dandy. This does not make them look good and their greenwashing is a pathetic PR strategy of desperation. The world is facing the effects of climate change now and I was asking of how you perceive climate change existentially, not for you to claim that it's a hoax. What is your belief on dealing with suffering that people are currently facing right now while enduring flooding in the long term?"

So I do agree with you theoretically. Yes, we are just a series of physical interactions. You have every right to view life from whatever perspective you want because fortunately our brain is advanced and can think that way. I just prefer to not to for more than philosophical reasons because I see literally no reason why I'd want to, also it'd be really hard to exist like that every day, and boring, and I might as well be dead.

There doesn't have to be some kind of underlying meaning to these feelings, but they exist and we have to relish in them as long as we're alive.

AskWomen,fc2rjr1,t3_efnsd2,1577371940.0,"This also raises the question of trans kids going on hormones at a young age. They get to live their life in a body they're comfortable in, but are infertile. Personally, I think they should be able to make that choice. By that logic, of course women can make that choice whenever they want. It's their body and they are aware that it's irreversible. Life is not all about having kids for many people, and if that's your goal, you can't push it on someone else because we're all different and could do whatever we want with our bodies."
