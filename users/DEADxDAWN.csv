Joaquin brought a haunted reality to this franchise that is both separate and equal to what Heath had put on screen. 

In my opinion, Joaquins performance was amazing. 

As cliche as it may sound, if you have ever been through severe depression, or have witnessed it, this movie hits home often on those thoughts."
