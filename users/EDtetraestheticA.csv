From what Ive researched it’s fairly genuine but you have to know how/why it works if at all"

As far as does it work? So I hear, I tried to myself but its hard to tell if its just placebo or not, it certainly isnt very powerful and I havent tried it repeatedly, and it basically works best as a kind of “reverse tolerance”, as in the more often you do it the better it works

Price tag to product amount is a huge deterrance, though. If you wanted to blow some money to try something different that’s legal, it’s probably good."
