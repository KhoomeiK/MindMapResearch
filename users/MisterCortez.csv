CannabisExtracts,fd7m2vu,t1_fd601y8,1578206573.0,"This is almost true. You have to multiply the THCA by .87 and add that to the THC to get the true THC content. 

Or, (THCA Ã— .87) + THC = Total THC 

In the above example:

(79.88 Ã— .87) + 4.78 = 74.28% Total THC

If you multiply by .13, you have to subtract the result from the THCA total then add the difference to the already converted THC because what you found with .13 is the total mass of the carboxyl groups, not the converted THC. 

Or, (THCA - THCA Ã— .13) + THC = Total THC

PEMDAS, motherfuckers.

CannabisExtracts,fd7kb8h,t1_fd5wifs,1578205829.0,"Hello! Decarboxylation is the process all THC undergoes as it converts from the acid form (THCA or tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) to the THC we all know and love. 

If you ingest THCA, it won't get you high.

The plant only makes THCA, you see, with the 'A' being like a little tail on the end of the molecule. That tail occupies the plug on the molecule where it plugs into your brain. So we have to break the 'A' off before we can use it. 

We do that with heat (or by waiting a looooooong time.) When you burn your weed with fire and smoke it, that's actually causing the 'A' to break off of the THC molecule.

The same thing happens when you dab using a hot nail or bucket. That heat causes the 'A' tail to break away so the THC can plug into your CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system.

That's how decarboxylation works and that's what it means when you see THCA on your packaging! I hope this helps.

Also, some testing methods (gas chromatography) blast the weed sample with heat, decarboxylating the sample before analysis. Because of that, we only see THC in the test results, not THCA -- because all the tails were broken off by the test."
CannabisExtracts,fd7jb8c,t1_fd5d790,1578205417.0,Idk about harsher. I agree you need terps but a clean distillate or THC diamond at low temp is as smooth as drinking water.
CannabisExtracts,fd7ixqh,t1_fd5woqt,1578205268.0,"This is correct. 

Diamonds are THCa so they lose 13% of their mass upon decarboxylation. So diamonds can't be more than 87% THC. If you have terps (what, 4-12% terps?) That's something consistently above 70%.

If you don't have terps wtf are you even doing?

Distillate is already decarboxylated, so it can theoretically be up to 100% cannabinoids. Even with 11% terps reintroduced you have a denser THC dab than the purest diamonds."
CannabisExtracts,fd7hn3p,t1_fd7cpt9,1578204661.0,"The two things which affect your experience the most are the cannabinoid profile and the terpene profile. Both of these types of compounds affect several overlapping factors of the high. 

I like a high CBG content for the anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects.

Lots of myrcene makes the high stony and sedative. Limonene acts as a mental stimulant. I find terpinolene to be creative and fun. Strawberry profiles always give me a good mood. Pine and diesel profiles have me staring into space. Lemon profiles make me want to get up and go. Combinations of these are what make every chemovar a unique experience.

He's right. We need a revolution because the government ignores the welfare, the standard of living, the happiness or prosperity of the people. 

Ostensibly, we all participate in this scheme because it makes our lives better than if we didn't have a government. It allows us to efficiently specialize labor and organize pools of resources for common goals which make everyone's life easier and better: education, infrastructure, protection, housing, food.

We've allowed a few people to convince us it's normal for corporations to shave more and more profit out of *our* lives. They squeeze tighter with lower quality products and smaller sizes while we die earlier, poorer, sicker, and sadder.

We can organize things differently. Imagine a 6-hour workday and a 4-day workweek while not having to worry about feeding or housing your family. People don't really care to be rich - they just want the worries of money to disappear.  Enough time to have a hobby or make art, or engage with the other people in our communities and have a real social existence.

We can achieve a lot, but we need real change which will not come from party politics and incrementalism.

1. Write founding documents laying out the structure and plan for this revolution.

2. Draw reasonable districts throughout the United States which accurately represent people without gerrymandering.

2. Elect local councils to represent those districts.

3. Elect regional councils to represent those districts.

4. Elect a national council to represent those districts.

5. With these councils, the People will crowdsource, standardize and approve a new Declaration of Independence and a new Constitution.

6. The national council will act as a model to mirror and criticize the standing U.S. government.

7. This Mirror Government will organize preparation for a general strike.

8. When enough people support the new model, the Shadow Government will call the general strike and assume control of local infrastructure which will be reorganized according to the new Constitution."
