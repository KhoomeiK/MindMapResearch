cats,fej2g4d,t3_eofr8o,1579154415.0,Got him!!!! Thanks so much for all your advice. It worked!!! I put out his litter box and set a humane trap and he’s a little freaked out right now but he’s back!!!
cats,fehcr1h,t3_eofr8o,1579113876.0,Still looking. This is so tough. Never lost a fur baby before.
cats,fech636,t3_eofr8o,1578973818.0,"Soooooo, don’t know what happened with the door. Was able to recover all our dogs but the cat is gone. He is strictly inside and probably terrified. The little town I live in is FULL of strays and we have several on our property that we feed to keep the mice away. I’m terrified that our teenager kitty was scared away by the territorial ferals.  We have a trap set by the door with his food in it and have already trapped his identical sibling. Thick coat, thick body, definitely not him. Anyways, I keep checking the trap. I’ve never lost a pet and don’t know how to stop my mind from circling around him again and again. Someone suggested setting out his litter box but I’m afraid it will attract the wrong attention from the ferals. How would you get your kitty back?"

Baking,fc1uv0f,t1_fc1rn2h,1577330438.0,I thought so! I have fallen in love with that  icing because of how it remains glossy after setup but I can’t seem to get my it to stay on the cookies as well as yours. I get sloppy sides. I heard a tip of doubling the milk and it will set up matte in half the time so I tried that this year and loved it but still it oozes.

axolotls,fbsuf3y,t3_eecp1p,1577060718.0,"Sullivan has always been a picky eater but he enjoyed worms in pieces till one day he choked on one. It’s horrible to watch while you wonder how to do the heimlich on an axie. Anyways, ever since then, he has tried to go for the worms but spits them right back out and any time he eats, it looks like the blinking you see. I know, no eyelids. So I mention this to my sis n law (she breeds them) and she says, oh yeah, I got one that does that too, and come to think of it, he’s a picky eater. Sullivan will only take pellets and pellet size shrimp pieces, never worms. Has anyone else ever encountered this?"
