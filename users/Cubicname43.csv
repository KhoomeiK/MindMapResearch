Regeneration 3 

Companionship 1

Let's go in reverse, shall we?

I pick companionship 1 because let's face it I want to live forever with my wife. Plus she'll get all my bones so you know.

Regeneration 3 because well I have three points left over and Durability 2 plus Regeneration 1 just didn't seem that useful. Plus if I get something stuck in my body it'll be really easy to take it out, you know except for the excruciating pain.

Ageless 4 because me and my wife both in the prime of our lives for the rest of time. 

I didn't pick termination because honestly all of the good options were too expensive.

The first thing I do is start working out like a champ. I mean seriously all my injuries are going to heal in a day or less there's no telling how strong I can get with some constant damn near psychotic try and kill myself type workouts. Then I'd take up martial arts for fun. Bring a knife to a gunfight just to fuck with people. Turn myself into a superhero. I will be known as Captain WTF, world's most annoying superhero. Honestly the superhero part's kind of a maybe.

Then maybe take of inventing build some cool shit and use myself as a crash test dummy. Maybe go skydiving. Or better yet shoot myself out of a homemade cannon into the sky."

you could pull a Doctor Dinosaur and just have it make absolutely no sense (at first glance) but it's still there like they did in Atomic Robo. See ""Why Atomic Robo hates Doctor Dinosaur"" and ""Why Doctor Dinosaur hates Atomic Robo""

You could also just drop them in with absolutely no explanation like they did with Dragon Ball.

You could pull an original Star Trek and have some mysterious race that keeps saving other races / cultures from Extinction.

You could pull a Star Trek the next generation and have a trickster deity type character just do it for the LoLs.

There's always the Jurassic Park solution.

Or you could go to the time travel wormhole route. which is one of the fan theories for Doctor Dinosaur by the way.

What he put into the one ring was not just work like the scientists did. What he put into it was literally parts of himself. Literally all of his metaphysical hatred and malice contained in a physical object.

The closest sci-fi equivalent would be like taking off your legs and turning them into a walker. Then using parts of your brain as a control circuit for the thing. Now using complex circuitry you can still connect yourself to it and be more than you once were. However you're not the only one that can use it.
