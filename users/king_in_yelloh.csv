This shit is intense."
dune,ff7o6wl,t3_es0u15,1579654270.0,So many photos in my phone of the bits and pieces from the series that resonate. This was definitely one of them.

Have you tried making a public event heroic with a group of blueberries?

:P"

dune,fevgbus,t3_eqn01d,1579397025.0,Love to see it! I need to invest in the hard covers now that I’ve finished the series. I have all older paperback copies so I could read anywhere.
AskReddit,fetzey3,t3_eqfgfg,1579381553.0,Highly recommend Uncut Gems. The pace in every aspect of the film made it hard not to get caught up with the characters and as a result made the story all the more intense and meaningful.
BeAmazed,fepmm3p,t3_eq92cr,1579324527.0,"Half of my brain: “This is fucking incredible, I can’t wait for the future of this tech!”


Other half of my brain: “What’s the point of doing anything if nothing is real!”"
TIHI,feoylrr,t3_eq4fhx,1579308212.0,"I upvoted because I do indeed hate this. That’s the course of action on this sub, correct?"

So good."
AskReddit,fem6y4k,t3_epr0g5,1579241951.0,"Knowing both of those things would only serve to feed my ego or destroy my confidence. 

I’m not trying to waste $1k on that."

DestinyTheGame,fej7maf,t3_epahca,1579160299.0,"I don’t understand why they let go of the Gunsmith Weapon purchasing system from D1. Some great weapons and “off brand” meta alternatives were acquired that way and it was amazing. 

Also felt satisfying to wait for the packages to arrive and see if a god roll was in - and if not, just wait till next week! 

Those were the days... (sigh)"
oddlysatisfying,fehvlmb,t3_ep3gkm,1579124748.0,"Audio, however, is not satisfying."
dune,fe9aith,t1_fe9767i,1578935868.0,Absolutely agree. I completely broke down crying - was like he was right there with me in that moment. Never have I felt so vulnerable after finishing a book / series.
AskReddit,fe4kjr0,t3_ennslu,1578860271.0,"Take the effort to maintain friendships/  relationships that you really care about.  

It’s surprisingly easy to lose your “people” after college ends."
AskReddit,fe4jkcy,t3_ennslu,1578859983.0,Steer clear of anyone claiming to have easy solutions to complex problems.
dune,fe03wvb,t3_enh57j,1578802450.0,"I made a point of finding old copies of the paperbacks because so many of the cover variations are so cool. 

Wish I could find some of the original art for them!"

My water pressure sucks."

aww,fdzf8ep,t3_enalsa,1578789647.0,"Not saying this is what’s happening here, but isn’t it common for Coyotes to lure neighborhood pets into playing with them, and then when they’re far enough from home the pack surrounds them and attacks?"

MurderedByWords,fds5xlw,t3_emtwlp,1578695085.0,"Had this discussion with my mom recently, though in a more productive conversation. We used the home she first bought, and showed her the math, accounting for inflation, vs the market value today of that house. Very similar numbers from this example. Thankfully, she’s starting to understand the faults of “boomer logic”, and I’m grateful for that."
dune,fdr9ie9,t3_emthdn,1578681357.0,"My older brother actually got me to start the series and now I’m almost finished with Chapterhouse. It’s been a truly positive bonding experience with him, and an eye opening journey through the series. 

Love to see it!"
dune,fdqxopx,t3_emhiyj,1578676293.0,"You’re the kind of teacher I wish I’d had back then. High school for me was 95% teachers who were apathetic about our education. 

As a 31 year old now, I’m just about finished with the Dune series, and wishing I’d had the patience to read it all in high school. It has changed my world view and I have never been so grateful for a book series to exist."

My mom cranked that in the car every time it came on, still slaps."

Hearing about the parts of the world that are taking action and pooling resources to help in this fight also almost brings me to tears. 

Turns out I’m just a sensitive dude,  :,)"
AskReddit,fdc8dqm,t3_ekdrs6,1578269104.0,"I know it can sound condescending, but practicing gratitude can help. Thinking about 5 things that I was grateful for within the last few days makes a difference. 

Can be something small, like a video or meme that made me laugh, or a treat I enjoyed eating. Gratitude is a mental muscle and exercising it over time can change things. 

Learned this through practicing meditation on occasion, which has also helped with generally feeling sad / bad."
CruciblePlaybook,fcxwftj,t3_ejccg3,1578071423.0,"Practicing quick scopes, jump shots and slide sniping on ads in patrol changed it for me back in D1 days. Close quarters snipes can be super rewarding if you practice."
