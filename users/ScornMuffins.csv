PS5,ff8clq4,t1_ff87tra,1579673008.0,It's funny because the PS5 sub is fairly active with rumours and speculation and memes but the Series X sub is fairly docile despite having more concrete stuff to go on.

PS5,ff7isbq,t3_erz8cz,1579650530.0,"Looks pretty good. The one comment I have is that there's a lot of text that takes up a lot of space and it's quite small. There need to be options to make the text larger for accessibility but that means the UI will have to scale with it and that can lead to issues. Notice how current console UIs tend to keep the text to a minimum on the main pages and always have a lot of padding around them so they can be resized without issue. The same will be the case for localisation. Some languages take up a lot more space than others and you run the risk of overfilling your boxes or having to make them too big.

A potential solution is to not have the text bound in cases where it is, especially with the news updates which can vary wildly in length. Possibly have the descriptions of options pop up next to the icon when highlighted instead of hard coded into the button."
pcmasterrace,ff6rrzi,t1_ff6gulg,1579633525.0,Interestingly the next Xbox has some tech in there that will inject the input from the controller into the processing pipeline so it doesn't need to wait for a new frame to register the input. I'm surprised it isn't more common on PC since mouse movement is usually an interrupt anyway.

gaming,ff57lae,t3_ernbyt,1579582562.0,"It's something called Dissonance-Reducing behaviour. It happens there's a large level of involvement in a purchase - i.e. it's something you're going to use a lot, is fairly unique in function and is an investment in terms of either time, money or joining an ecosystem - but there aren't a large amount of differences between one product and its competitors.

Basically people seek validation that they made the right decision after their purchase. By looking at reviews, staying up to date on its popularity, comparing it to the competition etc. When the involvement and ecosystem is particularly high it can create these clans who instead of just seeking validation of their own purchase want others to make the same decision while attempting to devalue the competition.

It all boils down to Fear of Missing Out. People want to know they bought the right thing and that they'll be able to continue using it without worry that it'll be discontinued due to lack of popularity."

pcmasterrace,ff442cj,t1_ff43smj,1579555083.0,I have a 4K/120Hz TV and a 1080p/144Hz monitor. I still prefer 30fps at 4K ultra settings for some games. It helps that when I game on my big TV I use my controller.
XboxSeriesX,ff43pll,t1_ff41p4k,1579554864.0,"If they can have it so the Series X and the Xbox One version ship in the same executable, similar to how X enhanced games work, then they can entice 3rd party support using a similar tactic.

""Here's your favourite new games on Xbox One, now here's how much better it looks on the Series X and you can enjoy the enhancements right now at no extra cost if you get the new console"" 

And then when they start introducing Series X generation exclusives it becomes a softer sell because potential buyers already have a value proposition in buying the new console without having to by any new games right off the bat."
pcmasterrace,ff4366l,t1_ff42ip8,1579554532.0,"Yeah. Sometimes I'll choose 30fps with higher settings and resolution instead of a higher framerate with lower res/settings. Some games you want all the response you can get, others you just want to drink in like a fine art."

pcmasterrace,ff3tw1w,t1_feztbmx,1579548750.0,Once you get used to it 30fps looks fine if it's stable. It's only dropping down from a higher framerate to 30 that's jarring and makes it look like a slideshow.

XboxSeriesX,ff3hrxx,t1_ff3gw16,1579541321.0,J don't think it was a risk exactly. When you do decide to upgrade you'll already have a library of series X games and few people will want to abandon that.

Because the person that doesn't want to upgrade just for the sake of better visuals is not going to buy a PS5 instead, they are going to keep their Xbox One X."

This has to be my favourite part."

PS5,fevuwtf,t1_fevtx02,1579401828.0,"I think both consoles have now confirmed hardware accelerated raytracing, and we've already seen that the Series X uses a single SoC (which is massive by the way). 

As for the SSDs, we can expect them to be PCIe 4 which has a theoretical speed of 7GB/s read. If so that would indeed make a SATA SSD seem sluggish.

One other feature that we know Xbox is using, but is ultimately AMD tech previously reserved for server-grade hardware, which is using the SSDs as RAM to load huge datasets very quickly. This is similar to how a pagefile works on PC but the key difference is with the SSD you can load directly to the CPU cache instead of having to go through the RAM first. I think that's some of the tech Microsoft were trying to show off with the Hellblade trailer so it really could significantly change gaming as a whole."

They don't care where you where you play them. Xbox, PC, mobile, it's all the same service anyway. So the Series X is there for console owners who want all the fancy bells and whistles of next-gen graphics.
