AskReddit,ff23ypy,t1_fezpido,1579493157.0,"As a mod, I can tell you that's the result of 2 simple issues:  

1. Asswipes *will* try to argue the stated rules, so you try to make them airtight, because most mods don't have the balls to be cunts.  
2. You have to make your rules airtight so enforcement is uniform across all your mods, because even if they're all cunts, they might not be cunts to the same degree.

See, I mod alone. I ban some people for a week and some for half a year. If I'm drunk, some get off with a warning. This approach, unfortunately, does not scale.

There'd be factory farming regardless of how little meat an individual ate. And factory farms are more efficient hence more environmentally friendly than the alternatives. Well-managed they can be just as humane too.

It's all just rhetoric. You can be cruel to animals in a pasture (e.g. check out how rams are castrated) and kind to them in a ""factory farm"". But ""factory farm"" sounds scary and impersonal so here we are."
