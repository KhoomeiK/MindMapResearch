Essentially third party companies claim to be from the city or utility and ask to see your furnace or water heater.   At this point they will tell you that you need a mandatory upgrade to some new piece of equipment or sign you up for fixed rate services in gas oil etc.  

I believe they outlawed the water heater and furnace door to door scams, so the new one is getting people in smart thermostats (I’m guessing they probably have subscriptions or are rentals etc)"
