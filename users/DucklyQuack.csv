One day, we won't even have our own computers anymore, and we'll just stream everything we need from a socket in the wall directly to your screen. Owning property will become more and more a luxury."
unpopularopinion,ffa4huv,t3_esiau3,1579727714.0,"We are able to tackle multiple problems at once, you know. And I don't like the whole ""someone else has it worse than you, so you don't get to complain/try to fix things""."
YouShouldKnow,fby7p7i,t1_fbxqmfj,1577210106.0,"I'm pretty sure that the 1% is just reported cases. Because that number conflicts with every other scientific article out there. Like I said, alot of people have no idea that they are, and go through life farting like the wind. My mother is one of those, now 70 and only recently got herself tested after I mentioned it is genetic."
YouShouldKnow,fby7130,t1_fbxe4jd,1577209640.0,"\*10-26%. 10 Is the lowest number I've come across. 26 Is the highest number I find believable, yet there are articles that go into the 30s and some even 40s."
YouShouldKnow,fbxlx8j,t1_fbxlt33,1577193312.0,"I commented this on an earlier reply, but lactose intolerance works differently for everybody. One might just have increased farts, the other might succumb to severe sickness. Consult your doctor if you want to be sure. Or just try a month without dairy, it won't hurt."
YouShouldKnow,fbxl79k,t1_fbxgzvh,1577192514.0,"Then they should consult their doctor. There are many reasons why people have this issue, lactose intolerance is just the most common one."
YouShouldKnow,fbxkjz5,t1_fbxju0j,1577191774.0,Added it to my post.
YouShouldKnow,fbxjey6,t1_fbxjcnb,1577190363.0,Uhm. No. Science. Or are you one of those flat Earth-ers?
YouShouldKnow,fbxj9kj,t1_fbxinu8,1577190170.0,"The one sentiment that people keep uttering after learning about lactose intolerance is ""I wish I knew sooner"". Kind of weird how such a common ailment goes under the radar."
YouShouldKnow,fbxj5fb,t1_fbxirbf,1577190021.0,Can't hurt to try! You might just make your life a 100 times more easy.
YouShouldKnow,fbxj3lw,t1_fbxitaq,1577189957.0,"It is, but the milk made it a 100% certainty I would be spending 'quality time' on the toilet. Since I cut diary, I can drink coffee without much trouble."
YouShouldKnow,fbxis6z,t1_fbxh8zb,1577189536.0,"Even in the Netherlands it's around 10-26% of people. Which may not sound like a lot, but that's millions of people."
YouShouldKnow,fbxiojl,t1_fbx646w,1577189401.0,There is a lot of cheese and sauces with lactose in (Americanized) Mexican food.
YouShouldKnow,fbxii5o,t1_fbxico5,1577189158.0,"Consult your doctor! I mean, you may find an answer here, but your doctor is the only one qualified to answer this question."
YouShouldKnow,fbxigbj,t1_fbxhl4a,1577189085.0,Lactose intolerance is the most common one though.
YouShouldKnow,fbxib4x,t1_fbxgycm,1577188883.0,"You can always just try and cut diary for like a month, see what it does. It might just change your life."
YouShouldKnow,fbxia51,t1_fbxgtuo,1577188847.0,Glad to hear it! It really is a life changer.
YouShouldKnow,fbxi73h,t1_fbxgfrf,1577188728.0,"I too was skeptical, but boy am I glad that I consulted my doctor just in case. You can eat diary with lactase pills, but consult your doctor before making any rash decisions."
YouShouldKnow,fbxi478,t1_fbxgvg4,1577188613.0,RIGHT. I always thought that coffee just made me poop. Turns out it was the fucking milk.
YouShouldKnow,fbxi32b,t1_fbxg3cj,1577188569.0,"My mother is only figuring it out now, after I did. She's 70, and still alive. So I guess not? I'm not a doctor though, consult yours before you make any decisions."
YouShouldKnow,fbxi095,t1_fbxf3lw,1577188455.0,"Lactose intolerance comes in all shades of brown. Some people just fart a lot, some people get really sick. If you're bothered by your farting (I mean, dating life for example), go get yourself checked out. Or just try to go without diary for a month, see what that does."
YouShouldKnow,fbxhwja,t1_fbxcbkl,1577188310.0,"Glad to hear you were able to figure it out! My mother is only figuring it out now, at 70 years of age, after I told her that it might be genetic. Her life could have been spared *so much* farts and poops."
YouShouldKnow,fbxhrya,t1_fbxd4kb,1577188125.0,"I wasn't anticipating that this post would have me ""sticking out my neck"", but people really don't like hearing that maybe their Ben & Jerry's are the problem."
YouShouldKnow,fbxhnls,t1_fbxak9d,1577187949.0,"Now that you mention it, I used to have a cold at least one week out of every month. That completely went away when I cut diary."
YouShouldKnow,fbxhl7e,t1_fbxbl5v,1577187853.0,"Big Milk probably has employees trolling this post. Seriously though, I'm also a bit confused. Got like 200 downvotes on my comments, so I just deleted them. It's not like I'm making this up or am shitposting, just trying to maybe help a few people."
YouShouldKnow,fbxgqvv,t1_fbx9ocl,1577186618.0,"Yeah but I assumed he meant that he and his whole family are having farty problems, but are not lactose intolerant. I was asking if he just assumed that or  knew it for a fact."
YouShouldKnow,fbxggkg,t1_fbxff49,1577186189.0,Yeah I'm not sure why
YouShouldKnow,fbx84lp,t1_fbx7wk5,1577173645.0,"That your life could be way more comfortable if you avoid lactose? If you or a loved one are having farty troubles, that is. Most people who have think it's normal, which it is not. Was that not clear from the post?"
YouShouldKnow,fbx7g0j,t1_fbx7bu3,1577172724.0,Poor toilet.
YouShouldKnow,fbx6zhd,t1_fbx6mtm,1577172113.0,Have you been tested?
YouShouldKnow,fbx6m1a,t1_fbx6bz1,1577171623.0,"Northern European would be more correct than ""whitey"" as a whole. American whitey is more genetically mixed. In any case, the numbers are around 10-26% of Northern Europeans, depending on which article you read."
YouShouldKnow,fbx6gtq,t1_fbx69bl,1577171434.0,Username checks out.
