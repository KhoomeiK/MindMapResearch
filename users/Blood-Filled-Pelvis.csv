depression,feut0p1,t3_eqnoq1,1579389648.0,"When I start to feel the wave coming on (it's not all the time now!), I go straight to Letterkinny and Bob's Burgers. Then I make sure that I'm doing my nightly routine so I wake up on the right step even though I just want to lay on my bed and be taken over by cats. Then I make sure I hit a running goal, maybe force myself to do some weight training. Watch any John Green videos (crashcourse history is my favorite but vlog brothers helps, too - all on youtube) whilst getting ready for work so I don't feel alone but, also, validated that I don't have nor will I feel great all the time (he has depression and anxiety issues, too, and I appreciate that he talks about it openly).

Going to work, I just make sure I have at least a snack and a fizzy drink (preferably CBD infused kombucha or klarbrum) and take customers one at a time. Go slow. Make sure one of my managers know whats up.

Have a warm meal. Doesn't matter if I ordered today or created from scratch, as long as it's warm, my cats are taken care of, there are no big messes around the house, and I do my night time routine again, within a few days, I'm usually a lot better.

I can start watching Rick and Morty or movies again.

The process used to not be so easy. I used to succumb to every emotion (which I am still working on) or lack there of and it might be months but learning what I actually need vs what my depression is telling me was the biggest step. I learned to go against all my depressional wants and it starts to get better for me. It's like mentally taking control over it instead of letting it run things. ""No, I won't lay in my bed all day - I'm going to clean the cat litter. Take that, Depression. I'm going to get you one task at a time."""
therapy,fetwg93,t1_fessbq3,1579380715.0,"Well, the last two have been over dogs.

The first was because I knew I had found the dog for me and I was taking him home and I was so happy so I started crying. Then I woke up crying ):

Last night, it was a dream where my mom died (she's my main abuser so I didn't know how to feel about that) but immediately right after, my dad and one of my supervisors came up to me and gifted me a puppy. There were 2 to choose from and I was deciding when I woke up. I was crying in the dream because I was so touched but I was crying irl (which woke me up) and I had to hard cry for a few minutes until all the dream emotions went away.

Typing this out, I think I'm looking for a connection, I feel like I find it and then maybe when I wake up, I find it hard to come to terms with the loss of something that never was.

Will definitely bring this up to my psych/therapist when I can."

I believe it was last month that I realized I've been worried about my JNM for years (dementia and Alzheimer runs pretty hard on that side of the family) but she just didn't care enough about me to listen to what I was saying. She's fine, technically - it's just that no one matters as much as she does."

SleepingCats,fec7px0,t1_fec5dji,1578968098.0,"When she was a kitten, she was found in a Hardee's dumpster by a dealer I knew (he also worked at the Hardee's). He took her home which I later found out was a room in a motel that was Notorious for shady people, shady dealings, shady everything. The place was falling apart and he regularly boasted that he was feeding her coke. Eventually, he and his gf got arrested so a friend of mine knew where he lived, we went to the room, broke in, and I took her home. My cat ran away a week before so I had everything she needed already. My cat that ran away came back a few days later and it's just been us three ever since. They're such cuddlers <3"
