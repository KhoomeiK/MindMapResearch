Futurology,ff18pcq,t3_djyoz7,1579476360.0,"The role of the police is not to serve and protect the people. It is to serve and protect the system that rules over the people. To enforce the relations of exploitation and oppression, the conditions of poverty, misery and degradation into which the system has cast people and is determined to keep people in. The law and order the police are about, with all of their brutality and murder, is the law and the order that enforces all this oppression and madness.﻿"

AskReddit,fdohcuk,t3_elssvy,1578605168.0,"I used to believe that mothers never cooked food, I know that sounds weird but there used to be this Hispanic kid about my age selling tamales from a wooden bucket that had a wooden lid. 

This was 1968 and I was 6 and this kid who was selling the one best thing I have eaten in my entire short life was sitting right in front of me, they were 27 cents each, that was what a gallon of gas cost in South Gate at the time I remember because my mom complained about the the gas going up 2 cents that year. So this kid who came around every so often and I was asking him questions trying to keep him around because my dad was on his way and I know he'll give me money for a tamale. 

Of course he never did show up, my parents were divorced so that happened a lot. So the one question that I asked the kid selling tamales, was who makes those tamales? And he replied my mom makes them at home. I could not believe him at first, I remember trying to picture my mom or anybody's mom cooking anything and I couldn't because I never saw her or another mom cook anything. I know you might think I might have seen a friends mom cook or something, my mom was on the run from my dad and we moved a lot, so I didn't have friends like that. It was always my sister who cooked and we never had enough food to eat and remember always being hungry. 

The next year my mother was arrested for child neglect, my grandmother her mom called the police on her. Still have the 1969 police report."

Ubuntu,fdf4kih,t3_ekeyig,1578353160.0,"I'm using an Nvidia GEFORCE GTX 1070 Ti  Founder's Edition on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, you can get the drivers for it too. The only thing I don't like is that there is no real Nvidia control panel like there is with windows. So I can't resize my second monitor, so it's a bit bigger than the panel, it it's too bad but I haven't dug into figuring out how to resolve that yet. I suspect that because my second monitor is a giant Insignia TV that's not really meant for a PC, so I have to resize it, so it fits inside, so that the top of the web browser isn't cut off at the top and sides. I have to pull it down with my cursor & resize it that way... UGH.

Here are my specs 

Intel® Core™ i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz,  

CORSAIR H50 HYDRO SERIES for cooling.

GIGABYTE Z87X-D3H,  

64 BIT PNY 64 GIGS. 

So far I love gaming on Ubuntu, I'm only playing titles like Day of Defeat source, Day of Defeat and American Truck Simulator. I don't know if Rock Star runs on it or not, I do have two SSD's in my gaming rig, one w/ windows and one w/ Ubuntu. When I wanna switch over I just spam F12 on start up for boot options. 

Good luck"
AskReddit,fdf2snw,t3_ejb3kg,1578352008.0,"I recently switched to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, because I bagged some work that required me to use it a lot,  I'm re-learning a new OS along with a web development team, I like how it's so easy to create files, and nano some stuff inside that lol I get such a kick out of creating with Linux, for some reason it's easier for me than windows. 

I tried Linux many years ago & did like it because I liked gaming. Now steam runs on Linux and the games I like to play to tale a quick break from work (DoD) run just fine on Ubuntu. I love the security, the privacy, the file system is easy to grasp. Sure remembering command lines can be a pain at first but when you use em 400 times a day you'll remember em :) 

I used windows my entire adult life and I'm 58 now and I have a lot of programs that I enjoy using on windows, like the video games that only work on windows. I have two SSD's, one with Ubuntu, one w/ windows & I switch over to whatever OS I want. 

As far as comparing Linux to Win10, for me it comes down to some factors like Linux is an open sourced operating system whereas Windows OS is commercial, with Linux  source code can be altered as per users needs. 

With Win10 both monitors work great together, on Ubuntu not so much, it's super buggy.

Win10 a lot of the top games only play on windows, and if windows doesn't want you to use a program anymore it will install code that will prevent it from working anymore (ADOBE

The only preference I really have is if I wanna play a game I'd rather use windows to play in."

history,fdeu9s7,t3_ekmkzh,1578346732.0,"' World at War**' My gosh I loved** World at War when I was a kid. I would come home from school '9th grade' and I had to switch our TV from the reg. channel to UVHS or something like that and switch the rabbit ears a bit to get the channel in clear and watch World at War for hours. 

I learned so much from watching World at War that I got straight A's in history in Jr high & high school, it was the only subject I got straight A's in actually. There was another one that was showed on the same channel back then called something like ""Victory at Sea"" or war at sea?
