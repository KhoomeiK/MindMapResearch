bipolar,ffc2oda,t1_ff7fk8p,1579790032.0,"It's really interesting to have some insight into this and hear about what it could potentially be like..  of course, there must be alot of variation between places.

I know what you mean - the other day, I felt that I need to call my gp and be admitted, but today I feel okay and calm.  You just never know, but just have to trust that things will always come back around, I guess.
This morning I was having thoughts that my life is blessed, which was a stark change from the negative thoughts I've been having lately.  It felt soothing.

Hope you're doing okay too."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff5yoj6,t3_eruqb3,1579614498.0,Lmao I'd love to have a friend like that.
bipolar,ff5osrh,t3_ersw5w,1579603747.0,Wow.. that is amazing.  There is so much pain in the eyes and grimace.  It hurts a bit to look at it because it's relateable.
bipolar,ff5o8e5,t3_ersrwn,1579602902.0,"I feel exactly the same way.  I'm so glad that we are both here.  It's very important for us to remember that we are not alone, and that there is support and people out there who get us.

Do you have a bipolar meeting group in your area?  I started going to the Bipolar UK one in my area.  They hold it once a month.
I'm not even a group person, but I tell you, I'm so glad I found it.  I feel very comfortable there, and hearing other people's experiences of bipolar teaches me things about my own experience, or gives me a new perspective that I otherwise wouldn't have had."
bipolar,ff4pv1t,t3_ermw4i,1579569564.0,That's gorgeous.
bipolar,ff4pdx5,t1_ff4ogp8,1579569239.0,"That is a very kind offer, especially considering you are going through such a difficult time yourself.  I really appreciate it.  Yes, I remember you replying very helpfully to another of my posts.

I think browsing and interacting more on this sub would really help me, actually.  Perhaps I can also try to help others too.

I like how your talkdoc (wow, I love that title) says that it is ok that you are going through this right now.  There is real acceptance in that, rather than resistance.
I think the voluntary work at the cat shelter sounds fab.  That must be really rewarding!  I used to work 4 days in my family business, and now I'm not really working since I got very bad a couple years ago.  I recently started going in for 2 days, but it feels very alien.  I feel like a different person, and I guess I am.  I can't handle responsibility as well as I used to.

But anyway, also let me know if you ever fancy a chat - about anything.  Even just to pass the time :)"
bipolar,ff4npu4,t1_ff22065,1579568061.0,"Thank you for laying out your experience like that.  It gave me some idea of what to perhaps expect..  can I ask where you are?  I'm in the UK.

Also, what sort of things did you do in group therapy?  Was it talking therapy, or arts and crafts?  I'm genuinely curious.
I'm feeling alot better right now in this moment, but I can see that I may have to do this if things get bad.  I never know how I am going to be day to day at the moment.

I really hope you are doing okay, and I'm glad you made the decision to go into hospital, as it gave you the space you needed.  I think that life and society is not calibrated in a way that is conducive to a healthy mental state, and it's a shame to say the least."
bipolar,ff4n6vk,t1_ff4lbde,1579567690.0,"Yes, sleep is so so important.  I have been keeping more of a routine lately, and my quality of sleep has been alot better too.  It does vary though, as you know.  Feeling well rested really helps other things fall into place.  
I do have a tendency of staying up too late..  I always preferred the night.  I am actually very tired now, and I wish it were earlier so I didn't have to sleep ðŸ˜‚
Out of interest, what are your go-to activities/distractions/hobbies?"
bipolar,ff4imuw,t1_ff3w2vq,1579564514.0,"I don't think we'll ever be okay really.  I think the anger is always there, but sometimes it gets quieter, and other times it comes back.  It's a huge block between us. 
I'm really sorry you had to go through that.  Trust is most definitely earned, and even dogs don't roll over when they are kicked.

Yeah, I've just started taking meds again (thanks for the reminder, almost forgot todays dose)"
bipolar,ff3sdqp,t1_ff0lov9,1579547820.0,"Thanks for telling me about your experience.  I do sometimes wonder if the same thing will happen with my mother and I.
I don't feel as angry about this today, which is a good thing.
I sent her a link late last night highlighting the various factors and causes of bipolar.  I was making a point by sending it.

I thought she would make some annoyed/passive aggressive reply, but she just said 'I do understand, sweetheart.  I do..  I love you xx'

I guess my anger and pride came from her acting like she knew it all, so I'm glad she replied in that way.  I couldn't stay as angry, at least."
bipolar,ff0l7tq,t1_ff0kl4k,1579469888.0,"That's beautiful advice, thank you so much."
bipolar,ff0iro6,t1_ff0740d,1579469235.0,"I know you're right - it's the guilt on her part.
I think it's lovely that you have a good relationship with your dad - I am the same with mine.
Forgiveness is such an amazing and liberating thing.  It is just not a possibility for me right now where my mother is concerned.

I also think it's great that you are applying your experience to helping shape your future, and the future of your family.  I guess that's where healing can come in.

I realise that there is pain underneath my anger, and that it is the easier option for me to be angry about it."
bipolar,ff042hq,t1_ff03pd4,1579464960.0,Thank you Lindsey.  I'll try my best to take things step by step.
bipolar,fezwqj4,t1_fezd7hs,1579462662.0,"Thank you for your advice.  I have a friend visiting me tomorrow.  Though she has invited me over many times, this is the first time I've asked her over.  I think I'm quite a private person, and that is why I don't mention things.
I may tell her tomorrow.

The thing is, even when the depression begins to lift, I'm never truly happy.  The fact that I have low self-esteem clouds everything, and makes the depression deeper somehow.  I wasn't always like this.  I've become a shadow of who I used to be.
Anyway, thank you again."
joker,feszbuh,t3_eqisq7,1579370417.0,I love this.  It makes it a special occasion :)
joker,fesxk41,t3_eqjgnr,1579369952.0,That is amazing!  Love how she did it in monochrome.
bipolar,fe5x7cu,t1_fdsl7yg,1578876953.0,"I'm so glad to see your update :) You did the right thing to reach out for help.  Take this time to give yourself extra tlc.
It's so good to hear that you're in a positive frame of mind.  That's such a big step!!

Please let us know how you get on."
bipolar,fdhdcj3,t3_elf3ru,1578420340.0,They look delicious!  Wish I could have one..  well done for doing something while you are feeling this way.  I think it's good to have go-to activities at times like this.
bipolar,fd94yqb,t3_ekbqsf,1578228497.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this right now.
You are not, and I repeat, NOT weak, but infact, your post shows a great strength.

You have been going through this with little support - you are showing a readiness to receive help.  Reach your hand out.

Please understand that you are not alone - we are with you.
Talk to your therapist, let it out.  I have also been  having dangerous thoughts lately, and so I have made the decision to talk to my psych in tomorrow's appointment, continue seeing my new counsellor.

Can I ask, what gives you distraction at the moment?  For me, reading graphic novels has been helping alot lately, as well as watching youtube vids, browsing reddit.

My counsellor taught me a breathing technique, it may help you.  You breathe in for 4, hold for 7, release for 8.  4-7-8.  You can count as fast as you like.  It does help me when I am having intrusive thoughts and acts as a natural tranquiliser.

Reach your hand out for any help - can you call your psychiatrist?  I know you said you are currently not on meds, but having a chat about what you're going through is important.

I don't know where you are, but here in the UK we have the Samaritans helpline, and it's been a lifeline for me when things have been at their worst (and even when they haven't).  Take advantage of the help that you deserve.

We are here for you, please believe it.

Edit - I saw that you are thinking to go to the hospital Tuesday.  Please keep us posted on how you are doing, even day to day.

Also, I hope my points about distraction and the breathing technique didn't make things seem trivial.  I'm just saying little things that have helped me enough in the moment, or hour by hour."
batman,fcf0t0v,t3_egzedc,1577625569.0,"Thank you for the help and recommendations everyone.  I just purchased the Arkham Collection from the PS Store for Â£15.99!
I'll leave Origins out for now, but it's a game I could have a look at later on.
I can't wait to play later.  The games look great."
joker,fbf4fsr,t3_ed1wxy,1576801291.0,Haha I would have loved to have seen that.
