If they don't match 401K, you can ask if there are any other benefits regarding retirement such as a pension. 
Also ask for any other benefits you might not be aware of such as pre-tax parking, company stock discounts, voluntary discount programs for employees like discounted phone plans and gym membership. It's pretty crazy how underutilized lot of the fringe benefits are since they're not always spelled out for you."
