Blind,ff7zw7j,t3_es1zb1,1579662368.0,"Do you have print available for everyone else or is it all electronic?    If you provide print, then having the option of a braille copy for blind students is equal treatment.   You can make the offer on websites or on advertising that a braille copy of whatever you offer in print can be provided on request.    You're not going to get many requests but printing one ad needed will make better economic sense than having unused outdated copies lying around.    Having an electronic version for everyone is what many colleges are doing so you wouldn't be amiss if you took that route and stepped away from print for some parts of your package."

On that point, tho.  If glasses help you see better for the time you have, then use them.     It's great that you had such a supportive experience in high school but you're going to be dealing with a lot more assholes, now.   It's time to start not caring what is said about you.   You are here to live your life.   Own that.   Forget the naysayers.

Can you get your tech shipped?  Can you get replacements or better tech where you're at, now?    Even a tablet with a good camera can make a difference in what you can see in class.   I use my phone to snap the overhead or anything on the board when I need to.   That way I can enlarge it and be involved in the class as it happens."
