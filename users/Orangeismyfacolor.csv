insanepeoplefacebook,fespkt2,t1_fesfgah,1579367671.0,"This is what people at work sound like when they're trying to defend him without offending anyone. You're right, people are very polarized but that's intentional. Divide and conquer is a real thing. It's been used successfully throughout history.  

Yes, the press is brutal to him. In fairness though it goes both ways. Fox and CNN/MSNBC are equally bad in their own left/right leaning ways.  I strongly recommend avoiding both. Honestly the man does enough to report on by completely unbiased news outlets to keep us busy reading without the spin. He's very publicly active and gives news outlets lots of material.  

People mistake liking Trumps personality with liking his policies. Why would anyone like him you ask? Well, he's racist and a lot of people are racist. They feel like they're right to be racist and glad they're no longer forced to be silent.  These people would like fewer of their tax dollars to be spent on non whites and non American. Crime is higher in darker skinned neighborhoods and employment is lower. They feel redeemed and glad they don't have to pretend anymore.   

He's fascist and a lot of people are fascist or fascist leaning and think more of it would be good for our country. I can't explain that one because a far larger majority would be hurt by it than helped.  Those darker neighborhoods aren't the only one that would be effected. (Affected? I'll never get those two straight). 

People like to believe that if they just had the chance they would be the big tough straight talking billionaire he is too so they feel a kinship. I know I love books that feature strong main characters who don't always follow the law. It's fun, it feels good, it's a power trip. Screw you bad guy. This is vigilante justice! People love malicious compliance and vigilante justice. Who among us doesn't feel like we've been treated unfairly!"
