I put the car into park and get out and she gets out and asks me why I backed into her. There was NO WAY I was in reverse. It wasn't a huge deal and barely left a mark, but her trying to flip the script and blame me, I just shook my head and explained that NO, I did NOT reverse back into her. I asked her to pull into the parking lot around the corner so we could get out of the way and exchange info. On my way back to my car, the car to my left, still waiting for the signal to change, the driver said he saw the whole thing and shook his head. I asked him to pull into the lot as well. I get in and turn on the green turn light and then pull into the parking lot, but then...nobody seems to have followed me. I waited a few minutes, then got out looking for the cars. Nobody. I shook my head, got back in and called it a day. I should have pulled out my phone and taken pictures and at least gotten pics of her license and paperwork.
