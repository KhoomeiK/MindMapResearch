Or these Monster who Destroyed the Arab Nationalism Idea in favor of religious extremists which backfired into the US losing the chess game.

gtaonline,fdjoxza,t1_fdjo642,1578481523.0,I think the Trick of a good Map is to place the Natural obstacles Like Mountains and lakes in between two or more places youd Like to visit. So it doesnt feel pointless driving through them and you still have the ability to Go abroad and explore.
gtaonline,fdjot0o,t1_fdjjema,1578481332.0," Nah, the upper right mountain range is one of the loneliest places in Gta .

Have you, the people decided that He was a thread or was it a small elite sitting in the high Towers?

AskMenAdvice,fdcbvov,t3_ekjszz,1578271205.0,"I can only speak for myself but If you mean those usual social Media Stories shared publicly Like places theyve Been etc.then I must admit that i mostly dont Care enough to answer or text back because its Not the Kind of socialising i enjoy or excell in. It doesnt Matter If its from my best friend or not i  See it and If its of importance i might remember it. It also goes for more private Messages of my Friends on Snapchat. I dont use that Messenger really, maybe im a Boomer (am 19) because i dont get why people use it. However i noted that there are two Kinds of people, the ones who Share almost everything or try to flex with what theyre doing as well as the ones that If ever Share stories once or twice a month or even only once a year. These Posts are usually alot more interesting because of the ""mystery"" about These people by Not Sharing everything and i used one of those once for shining  light on a topic i wanted to Bring up."

gamedesign,fd65ldd,t1_fd615o5,1578185848.0,"As another negative example though an unexpected one id throw Red dead Redemption in the Ring because it has exactly 0 procedurally generated content because every Mission is very scripted. This is Not the way to make your Sandbox fun, i expected to have generated quests like bountyhunting and Stagecoach robbing after the five missions and i got nothing. This made it really pointless to ever return into areas without any missions in the late Game/ epilogue which Made the endgame short and without entertaining Content."

The ability to jump through time and the clever usage of it was really fun and Made me suggest the Game to everyone of my Friends. It also has the best FPS Multiplayer in my opinion

exit the farm i smelled something burning and saw smoke from the barn and told my aunt who immediatly was alarmed/very concerned because if it was the hay burning we had to call the firefighters now or its lost altogether. So we searched the barn and the pigs den until we realized it was coming from the street nearby where a drunk driver crashed his car. He was alright and the firefighters had also already arrived, trying Out their new ""toy"" the vehicle they got the night earlier as a gift from the community. So we just watched for sparks until they annahilated the fire"

Rdr2 barely any endgame content, only 10 or so bounties in comparison to rdr's 40 also all Missions were exactly Timed and didnt allow for any individual choises or optional ways. R*missuon design is stuck at a 2005 Level of Game Innovation.  I really liked the beginning of the Story but was severly dissappointed by the optional Missions and the Lack of free choice so definetly Not a game of the decade for me."
