This is some very bad writing as far as I can see. It should read ""two bite attacks in place of a single attack"" or ""two bite attacks as an attack action in place of an attack"" (only these two spellings would allow it to work with the listed charge & AoO).

Attack actions are very specific uses of a standard action, and neither a charge nor an attack of opportunity are attack actions (some feats allow you to treat them as such). They're just melee attacks.
