NoStupidQuestions,fetvug7,t1_fet829v,1579380590.0,You've got that wrong. Attending tertiary school is much more attainable in the us than other countries.
NoStupidQuestions,fetvc9m,t1_fesg11h,1579380425.0,"Is there a correlation between secondary education and economic success.

I find it interesting that the countries where students believe they're the best and know what they're doing perform better irrespective how actually good their education actually ranks (like Sweden, israel, and the us). Theres also the point that innovation doesn't really come from excellence in one field but the ability to apply knowledge across fields (which is again, really pushed in those 3 mentioned before).

The US education system isnt designed to train you for a job, it's designed to let you be trained to do any job. With the mobility that's expected and normal in the US we wholeheartedly adopted the Prussian education system which wanted a broad base to draw officers and engineers from, but we wanted it because people moved so much so you wouldn't be doing your parents job when you came of age."

Similarly, the US does not accept the doctrine of universal jurisdiction that some of Europe follows (that some of their laws are valid outside the country, Spain is the most significant example of this) and will (and has) violently contested any country's or international body's attempt to extend sovereignty over the United States."
news,fes89lw,t1_fes7z3c,1579362453.0,"If you read the article, that has nothing to do with the seal of the confessional. 

It only deals with pontifical secrecy, which is akin to executive privilege.

Literally direct from the article:
>The change has no bearing on another area of Catholic Church confidentiality: information relayed to priests during sacramental confession. Even as some jurisdictions have tried to hold the church accountable for not sharing information about abuse learned during confession, the Vatican has called the ""seal of confession"" inviolable and an ""intrinsic"" requirement of the church."
news,fes47kx,t1_ferwy4r,1579361234.0,"Because breaking the seal of confession is a mortal sin (aka straight to hell)

If you were to walk into confession and tell the priest you were planning or murdering him, even then he couldn't tell anyone or change his actions to implicate the plot. 

Hell he cant even reveal it to you. You can walk up to him and say ""remember when I promised to murder you"" and he'd have to feign ignorance.

If the priest were to somehow reveal something that happened in confession that was both inadvertent and indirect, the punishment for that is basically life imprisonment. There's even vade in pace, which is a bunch of hilarious sentencing word play. Instead of the classic Catholic command to ""go in peace"" it is slightly grammatically different in Latin to mean ""go INTO peace"" where the person is confined in a room without human contact for the rest of their life. Though in the Church's punishment, they're provided food and water and books, think of it as lifetime of solitary except you never even see another person compared to the secular version where the people would just starve, suffocate, or die of thirst.

So yes, the sacrament of confession is a seal that is almost never broken and those who do break it are excommunicated and in some cases executed or imprisoned for life.


The reason it would do so little is that history is rife with examples of priests being tortured and killed for refusing to break the seal of confession. There's literally nothing you can do to a priest in this world that would ever compare to the punishment they believe will await them in the next."

Remember the guns they had fucking sucked. Much more useful than some untrained levies but they're not exactly mowing down the other side. The Swedes, who really refined the pike and shot as it developped, basically fired 2 or 3 times while quickly advancing then charging to attempt to rout. They weren't really there to stand and take fire and trade volleys like the Napoleonic armies... which as soon as guns were good enough to actually mow down people (like the Civil War) saw the disuse of the bayonet in favor of an entrenching tool. (I'll actually try to find the letters of British observers who thought the dueling American armies were cowards cause they didn't fire twice then charge like the British doctrine called for). Basically the pikes and guns worked great, because neither was great and as soon as guns got good (and generals realized it) you saw static warfare. Guns really suck because you have to reload. Cavalry and dedicated infantry could cover that distance before you could. Compare the first Bull Run to the Seige of Petersburg if you want to see how warfare evolves when generals realized that Napoleonic warfare just wasn't meant for modern (at the time) weapons with more accuracy and faster reloading."

In areas where they may be a similar level but outside of NA, language barriers and training differences (though maybe not standards) make it an unappetizing prospect to operate not as a full team. 

From what I'm familiar with I thought we were discussing whether an individual would be individually assigned to a foreign crew, rather than operating as a distinct unit. Which, except for Canada and few others, the US teams will not do."

There's been a growing thread of discontent in Iran over the past few years as Iran has gotten poorer and their populace is upset ove the Iranian government spending money supporting militia and terrorist groups abroad at the cost of welfare programs (like gas subsidies) at home.

&#x200B;

The Ayatollah has been taking to twitter, in weird musings, comparing Iran to the fall of the USSR arguing that the main difference is that the USSR gov't didn't have popular support and had domestic discontent while Iran has popular support and no domestic discontent. (This was in the middle of the aforementioned protests). Even conservatives in Iran (the dicatorships base) have been writing open letters in newspapers (which shockingly, get published) calling the Iranian government misguided because of graft and their focus on funding groups abroad rather than at home. The IRG units used to be the cream of the crop of the Iranian army (especially compared to their human wave tactics using untrained recruits during the Iran-Iraq war) but has increasingly become positions based on loyalty rather than merit and have grown into a sprawling international business/crime syndicate to keep the IRG soldiers in a higher living standard (thus, the loyalty is ensured).

&#x200B;

The sanctions were putting the needed pressure on Iran to create an untenable domestic situation to curtail their spending abroad. I don't doubt the Soliemaini attack was in response to prevent a future attack, but that could have been true for any time in the past 20 years. I think the administration saw it as a perfect wedge to force Iran to either ramp up their international outlays or look weak, while also making that internationl outlay become more and more politically unpopular.

worldnews,fcz26jr,t1_fcyx9j9,1578092165.0,It wasnt an assassination. They were a valid military target operating in a theater of war.
news,fcz2230,t1_fcyxff0,1578092095.0,"So wmd isnt a war crime. War crimes deal with the conduct of war.

Abu gharib was morally wrong but it was legal under all international treaties as the prisoners did not act to achieve the protection of international law.

Highway of death is the easiest. The us attacked and destroyed an enemy army. I dont see how that's brought up. Beating someone badly in war does not make the victor a criminal.

Kandahar, sentenced to life in prison.
 
Mai, you're reaching back 60 years.

Now reaching back 100?"

worldnews,fcyvzr7,t1_fcyv278,1578088291.0,"Yes, but you're talking about a lot of treaties which have ramifications on domestic policy. 

&#x200B;

Everyone was all pissy about the US not signing the UN aggreement to suppress fascist and neofascist movements, while ignoring that it called for exclusively domestic changes which ran right in the face of the 1st and 5th amendments. 

Similarly we're not subject to the ICC because the ICC lacks important constitutional protections like the right to confront your accuser, have a jury of your peers, the right to an appeal, and evidenciary gathering and sharing rights."

worldnews,fcwfhzg,t1_fcwfajz,1578024290.0,"The rationale was to deter future attacks or a specific attack, not every specific one. By taking a very competent person off the board, they can do that. To assume a single assassination takes down probably the most complex and competent terrorist organization in the world is such an unbelievable argument I can't see why you're making it. Taking out bin Laden weakened AQ, but didn't eliminate it. No one thought taking out bin Laden gets rid off all the evil in the world, it just takes a very good organizer of those evil acts out of it."
