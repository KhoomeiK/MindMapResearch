berkeley,fem66c0,t3_epvhoq,1579241151.0,"You can't get into Northside as a new member during the school year. If you get into Rochdale or Fenwick it will be in a four-bedroom, and it's highly unlikely unless you have some kind of priority like EOP, DSP, being undocumented or being a transfer student (Ik EOP and being a transfer are weighted the same; I assume it's the same for those other two priority characteristics.)

If you're even thinking about applying it's best to do so as soon as possible because members without seniority points are ranked by application number.

The leases are for a semester only, but you can renew your contract and continue to stay in the same unit from fall to spring."

I also want to go to grad school so I understand feeling like you need to get good grades. My extenuating circumstances have been resolved for some time now so I have strong hopes I will do much better this spring. I'm going to try to participate more in discussion, do my required readings more often, and attend office hours."

berkeley,fcj4fkk,t3_ehgdg6,1577677020.0,"It's easier to get a spot during the summer just cause less people live in the co-ops over the summer.

How loud/clean the unit is really depends on who's living in it. I think in general the houses are messier during the summer, especially because everyone's work shift requirement is less (since most houses don't get food deliveries in the summer).

They have three apartments.


They have a half-contract period that begins on July 5th. You may be able to move in earlier at a prorated cost.

You don't have to do as much work shift in room-only houses/the apartments. The room-only houses are also cheaper. I think it comes down to whether you're willing to make time to go grocery shopping and if you're okay with not having your money stretch as far."
