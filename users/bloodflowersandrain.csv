cats,fdnq1lx,t3_em9sjk,1578590691.0,"If you're nervous about letting her out again, I recommend TabCat. Like a GPS but much smaller and lighter. It helped us find our cat who was missing - turned out he was under the floor boards of a house which was a construction site. He went out early, then the JCB's came and he was too terrified to come out. Long story short, without TabCat he would've been buried alive. So happy for you and your kitty ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I would add to your list a good quality scratching post. The corrugated cardboard ones are ok but they don't last and make a huge mess. We have this one which has lasted years even with regular use by two cats (which is rare for a cat tree):

 [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/202758979222](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/202758979222) 

If you can't get that one (or don't want to), make sure to get one made with sisal as it's the strongest. Some are just string which doesn't last at all.

Oh and get 2, and put them in different rooms. Your kitty will be happy and so will your furniture!

Enjoy your new kitty, he's amazing."

childfree,fcezbdf,t3_egxv3y,1577625139.0,"You're not alone, I feel the exact same way. Ever since I was a kid, I just didn't enjoy babies or young kids at all. Still don't and it's never changed. In fact, now that I have nephews and a niece I would say it's got worse to the point of a phobia. I don't want to touch them or be touched by them, and I don't find them cute. I really want to as it would make life so much easier but it's just not in me."
