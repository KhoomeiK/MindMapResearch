Let me rephrase, there are beneficial aspects to taking a moment of reflection regardless of whether or not you believe there is a higher power entity.

Many non-religious cultures use very similar practices. It should never be pushed on anyone. But people who don't believe in religion shouldn't discredit the fact that the practices may still have real practical affects.  God or not!

Edit: repitition
Edit #2: lack of repetition of the letter ""t"" in the word ""repitition"""
