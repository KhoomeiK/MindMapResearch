First of all cyclists are perfectly capable of ""getting up a bit of speed"" all over the city, on the roads. A 20mph zone is certainly not the place to be going ""20-30mph"" irrespective of what powers your wheels.  
  
Secondly if students are too dull to recognise a specific cycle way (as opposed to a genuine shared thoroughfare like in Bute Park) then they deserve what they get imo.
