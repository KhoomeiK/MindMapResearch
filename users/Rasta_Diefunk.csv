I'd bet any woman would pick the 5'7 good looking man, over the 6'2 fugly dude.

In this case, you could say, that for her the character is replaceable and it comes off as if she was a bit borderline stalking him. I can understand informing someone, that his pictures have been used by someone else, but forcefully starting contact? 
Nah. It's weird at best and stalking at worst."

marvelmemes,fdbgzrd,t1_fdam8mt,1578257293.0,"That's the most white knight tweet I've ever read.

Nobody fucking cares what some total stranger does with their life. I've read enough stories of people deliberately lying, or ommitting things, they've done in the past and once people know and avoid them, they feel personally attacked. That just means these people were not compatible to begin with. They should cheer up instead, they avoided not understanding people and should cut losses and get a new circle.

Different people, have different boundaries when it comes to sex and there is nothing wrong with, not being okay with that. Everyone can live their life like they want but not expect to be understood by anyone. 

Everyone avoids certain types of people, because they think fundamentally different. For some it's religious people, for some it's atheists, for some it's people liking certain sport clubs, for some it's people having certain hobbies, for some it's people having certain views of life."

Speed dating is surprisingly more common in men under 30 and women over 30.

We had a speed dating event in my hometown once, with different age groups. They were 20-29, 30-39 and 40+. In the youngest age group, 23 men signed up and no women and in the higher age groups almost no men signed up and women in the dozens. As much as it may hurt them, but there is a reason these men under 30 are single and women are suddenly eager to sign up for speed dating. They are both either past their prime, or never had a prime to begin with. In other words, nobody wants to date them (anymore) and they use speed dating in an attempt to snatch a dumb bloke. 
The self-depreciating comments of OP are evidence. He is much likely not sought after. What leads people to try it, is resignation (these men know, they don't stand a chance to date people in other ways), or dishonesty (these women knew, they once could do better and it was easier and surely feel disgusted about having to stoop down this much)."
