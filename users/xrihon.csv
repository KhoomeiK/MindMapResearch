Another contender is me being terrified of PA announcements at the airport. They were quite loud and echoey. So my mom told me to pray to the voice so that it wouldn't hurt or punish me, and that it would go away.

It's good to look back on and to see what you're capable of. Especially important if you ever find yourself in a post-graduation rut (like I did, will be honest). But I'm all about looking forward from here. üëå"

findapath,ff30w21,t1_ff2x6qr,1579530699.0,"That's the same situation with me, and why I'm trying to be more careful about zombie-scrolling Instagram just because I see people I know taking all these trips and getting lavish items, and I'm still stuck at home, combing through some debt on a small income. Maybe they do have that money, maybe they were smart/lucky to get a fine-paying job in their early 20s, or there's massive debt they're completely racking up and ignoring. But somehow, I fool myself into thinking they're ""living their best life,"" so I should match that so I can live mine. When in reality, they're none of my business.

Anyway, I have also resigned to the idea that 30s are the new 20s. Everything sounds more stable and independent there. I can't fucking wait.

In the meantime, it sounds like you are aware of your accomplishments for your education and work history thus far, and I say: damn awesome job. Even if you aren't making bank yet, perhaps your work ethic will be appreciated in newer mediums. Take whatever you'll learn about your own work ethic from your current job, and make it applicable to jobs or educational opportunities down the road."

AskReddit,fdl5in9,t1_fdk71f8,1578517399.0,"Slowly binging random old favorites on Hulu or Amazon recently. Finished watching Spongebob, only up to the 3rd season though, and I could finally read into how the show was going elsewhere when it got to peak popularity. The script/jokes/skits were in a continuum of clever vs. cringiness. As a kid it was much easier to enjoy that surface humor, but now I can't help but imagine the actors and producers getting to a fuck-it point by the end of the 3rd season.

Now I'm on some Cartoon Network stuff. I never realized how dark and gross Powerpuff Girls could get. If they'd put more old-school Cartoon Network on, I'd be set to rediscover some shows I *slept* on."
socialskills,fdka33n,t1_fdjqqj5,1578499485.0,"Without Googling, it looks like one of those common English misuses because it sounds the same as a different word.

She should already know how valuable higher education is, and possibly have an inkling that you're *saving money* in the long run with CC.

If it becomes an oddly specific problem with her having to take you to school, I'd probably find some way to just take yourself to school. Either learn to drive or learn the bus schedules in your city.

I personally never experienced nor understood the hype of those college acceptance videos. Many come off as melodramatic instead of sincere, like free PR for the universities. Doesn't matter where you end up school-wise, it's what you make of it while you're there. Focus more on what you want to achieve through your hard work as a college student, instead of wearing the short-lived ""I gOt iN"" cape for too long."

AmItheAsshole,fcw3oxv,t3_ej43zt,1578016424.0,"NAH - but may become a YTA situation if not  discussed pronto.

I got in only one situation where roomie tried out having a stranger over, and I initially thought I was ok with it as us roommates (a trio) were normally ok with having partners over. I would just be locked in my room that night anyway, so I wouldn't even be seeing the person. But their presence was definitely made known, as the sheer ""force and volume"" of their movement that night was shaking my sliding closet doors.

I wasn't pissed at roomie per se, bc they were pretty clueless about having a one-night stand for fulfillment purposes. I was actually more worried for their well-being. :P Roomie eventually concluded that shit was too risky for them, the sex was garbage, profusely apologized to me, and never did it again.

However, after graduating and leaving my first shared apartment, I've come to realize how territorial I am. I don't think I'd be ok if roommate tried to pull it off every week. If there were no ground rules, I personally think I wouldn't be able to tolerate random strangers in my home often, even if they're only in one room the whole time, and already ""knowing"" exactly what they're there for. Not only that, being sexiled in your own space is on the same spectrum as being cockblocked in it. No one likes that feeling of always tiptoeing. You're still adults after all.

Since it is uncomfortable for your roommate, I'd have to suggest to you and roommate (besides ground rules): sleeping over at partner's place instead, or finding a new roommate/place to live that fits your lifestyles."
getdisciplined,fbxuypw,t1_fbxiole,1577201200.0,"Yup, I think the assumed urge that women have to become more ""independent"" was/is a product of ingrained history. Maybe a highly Western-influenced history - I don't know how other old cultures viewed their women in general. I have no specific examples to cite here - but you hear of some cultures that have a similar theme to the West, women being in a subordinate role to men, despite not having the influence of Abrahamic religion(s) and/or colonization. In other cultures, the women are venerated.

Without that history staining all of these values, there's almost nothing to separate ""masculine and feminine,"" if the terms even exist in a world like that, when it comes to human values. Since most humans are capable of being headstrong, caring, assertive, compassionate, stoic, emotional, powerful, powerless."

getdisciplined,fbwwyvm,t3_eeul88,1577161680.0,"Interesting shift. Gotta discern that fine boundary behind self-care vs. ""selfishness."" As well as vice versa, being altruistic vs. giving too much of yourself away to others. As a not-so-proud lady doormat, I long to achieve the inferred positive facets of these.

Also wondering why there is a predominating gender assignment to these methods of motivation. It seems as though the recent self-love movement is promoted often through a feminine lens, and being a provider/protector unto others (for true self-fulfillment) is through a masculine lens."
AskMen,fbb9ndt,t1_fbak38m,1576695906.0,"Old roommate did something slightly similar, but I pin it on the way their mom might have prepared ingredients growing up. They would always peel onions, garlic, etc. straight on the countertop, and just leave the peels there (wasn't 100% at cleaning up after themselves either).

My dad taught me to use the thin produce bags as a makeshift trash can. Or occasionally, old newspaper. So naturally I'd get a twinge when I'd see peels all over my kitchen counters."
