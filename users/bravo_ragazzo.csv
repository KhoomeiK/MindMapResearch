smallbusiness,fdnle6c,t3_em87my,1578588234.0,Introduce yourself to an owner of a mom/pop cafe in a neighboring town. So there isn’t any market overlap - you aren’t competing. Maybe they would be nice enough to send you their contacts for supplies etc. esp since you are not Starbucks and your shop will only help them by promoting small cafes vs coffee chains. Best of luck!!
