AskReddit,ffax7es,t1_ffavs2g,1579746580.0,"The prices for movies on YouTube are ridiculous. When I got YouTube Premium I expected the movies to be included. But no...

I don't know what the US prices are but in Switzerland YouTube wants $10 for Wolf of Wallstreet (in SD). That's not even a real digital copy. It's only a license to play this on YouTube as often as I want. For comparison, a physical DVD of the same movie costs $9.90 at the book store. I can sell it after I've watched the DVD. I can't sell my YouTube movie purchase.

A fair price for movies on YouTube would be $2 or less."
AskReddit,fevmg9w,t3_eqies2,1579399095.0,"When I was a kid we went an event where we attached cards with our name and address on some helium balloons and let them go and hopefully receive mail from whoever finds it.
When we arrived back home the balloon landed in our garden and was just hovering above the grass. The same balloon with the paper with my name and address on it."
bicycling,femrvox,t1_fekl01g,1579267833.0,"I have owned both previous versions. The lights do work and they work well as be-seen lights that you can just leave on the bike. The resistance is unnoticeable. The first version was so bulky and ugly that I ended up removing them. The second version was acceptable design-wise but the front lights were still a rather huge thing  to install compared to a Knog light because they needed an adapter so I only used the rear light. It worked really well until suddenly in winter it just died. I emailed they guy several times to get a replacement and never got a reply.

Regarding Kickstarter experience: Both times the projects took 1 or 2 years longer than planned and I don't expect it to be different this time.

Did I back the third version? Yeah, but I'm an idiot."
webdev,fe65rvx,t3_enntct,1578882418.0,"I wouldn't lock this down so that only owners of the domain can set up monitoring and receive notifications. Wanting to be notified when someone else's website is down is a totally legit use case. Like, what if I just want to know if Reddit is down?

Additionally, making it harder for users to set up their monitoring will significantly impact your conversion rate (in a bad way). Only implement restrictive measures if you notice fraudulent activity."
bikepacking,fe41vsm,t1_fe3zbcn,1578854996.0,"The stabilizer is 100% recommended. It really keeps the bag in place which makes a huge difference in ride feel.   It's also very reasonably priced.

Plus, it adds places to mount bottle cages. Can't have enough of those. And they are in a really convenient location. The only downside is that the bottle cage mounts are a little high and are pointed towards your butt. I had to [saw the corners off of my Anything Cages](https://i.imgur.com/ApJQr5o.png) with a Dremel because they kept poking my butt. But now, with the corners off, it's perfect."
bikepacking,fe3vhfo,t1_fe3jhn1,1578853211.0,"Sure! My setup is slightly different on every trip but on this trip it was as follows:

* The frame bag is a [Surly Straggle Check](https://surlybikes.com/parts/straggle_check_frame_bag). This is where I keep my tools, spare parts, medipack, a general fix-shit-kit, pump, water filter, battery pack, charger, cutlery, mini tripod, electrolyte tablets, energy bars, snacks, cookies, etc.
* On the seatpost is an [Apidura Expedition Saddle Pack](https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-saddle-pack/) (17L). It contains poles for the tarp, Thermarest sleeping pad, down quilt, underquilt for the hammock, hammock, hammock suspension, and a puffy jacket.
* The saddle pack is stabilized by a [Woho X-Touring Anti Sway](https://www.bikeinn.com/bike/woho-x-touring-v2-anti-sway/136657517) stabilizer which prevents the saddle bag from wagging and also provides a place to mount a bottle cage on both sides.
* On the stabilizer there two [Salsa Anything Cage HD](https://salsacycles.com/components/category/accessories/anything_cage_hd) that each hold a 1L Nalgene bottle in a thermo insulation pouch.
* On the top tube is an [Apidura Expedition Top Tube Pack](https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-top-tube-pack/) (1L) that contains smaller items like chapstick, MP3 player, flash light, chewing gums, small parts. I don't recommend this bag. It doesn't hold well on my bike so that I had so mount it using hose clamps to prevent it from slipping. Also, the zipper broke rather quickly.
* In front is a Surly 8-pack Rack that holds [Fabio's Chest](https://ronsbikes.com/products/fabios-chest-cordura). This is where I keep my cooking gear, extra blanket (it's hold and my regular quilt list its puffiness), the tarp, the food bag, clothes, and basically all the remaining stuff including more power banks.
* On top of the front bags is a [Delta Cycle Cargo Net](https://www.amazon.com/Delta-Mega-Rack-Bicycle-Cargo/dp/B000ACAMII) to hold my sitting pad and some temporary items like the shoes I'm not currently wearing, [bananas](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rij7R3j2hEjq3dfA8), etc.

In hindsight, I should have left the following things at home: Cooking gear (for the first week I couldn't even find gas and the second week it was also too windy to cook), Hammock kit (these islands often barely have any trees)."
bikepacking,fe3ncmu,t1_fe3h1at,1578850936.0,"I have toured in Spain a lot and nowhere else have I met such nice and patient drivers. The only times I was overtaken by asshole drivers they were tourists.  To my surprise, Dutch drivers often aren't nice to cyclists. The nicest drivers I've ever encountered were in Asturias in the north of Spain. It was almost surreal."
bikepacking,fe3lb3j,t1_fe3bsr0,1578850303.0,"The first and last night I slept in a hostel where I was also able to leave my bike bag for the duration of the trip. I slept in hotels when I either had to take a ferry early in the morning, or if I arrived late in the evening because riding out of the city in the dark to find a place to camp isn't fun. With one exception, I slept outside all other nights. I brought a hammock and a sleeping pad so I could sleep both in the trees and on the ground. I also had a tarp. In hindsight, I should have left the hammock at home because I was able to use it only once. There aren't that many trees on those islands.

Finding places to wild camp wasn't that hard. I usually found a place where there weren't any people and slept there. The few times that people did see me, they just said hi. The most difficult part was finding a place that's protected from the wind. Especially on Lanzarote because half the island is just volcano (you can't sleep on those rocks) and very windy.

If you look at my [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TgvSaKW23hH3rz3s7) you can see where I slept. I slept in a pick nick area, next to a lake, in a ruin, in hotels, in sand dunes, at a bus stop, under a bridge in a dry river bed, in a 5-star resort, on volcano sand, almost in a cave (still regret not having looked further), and by beaches.

I've been bikepacking / touring for 10 years and I've become pretty good with being comfortable in all sorts of places. Sometimes you just have to claim a spot and not care what people think.

In 2018/19 I did another trip in the Canaries where I toured on Tenerife, La Palma, and La Gomera. These islands have more trees and I was able to use the hammock about 50% of the nights.

If you're looking for places to ride your road bike, Gran Canaria and Tenerife seem to be the most popular and have the best road surfaces. They also have mountains where it isn't so windy.

Edit: Beware that all the islands are like little micro worlds when it comes to climate. Some spots are warm and dry while other spots are really cold and humid, or windy. Bring warm enough sleeping gear!"
bicycling,fe1vfli,t1_fe0o4m8,1578831313.0,I was gonna say the same thing. This is dangerous because if a driver actually tries to read this then they're clearly not paying attention to the rest of traffic.
bikepacking,fe1jrl9,t3_enm74s,1578827414.0,"I did a two-week trip in the Canary Islands over Christmas / New Year starting in Gran Canaria, then Fuerteventura, and a short loop on Lanzarote. The temperatures were great but it was really windy (especially on Lanzarote) and the wind was pretty cold at times. The islands are so beautiful and very diverse.

bicycling,fddtu5r,t3_ekgjw1,1578323819.0,"A colleague at work has the same bike and is very happy with it. The pedals that it came with suck and, if it was my bike, I'd upgrade the wheels. Definitively one of the best bang-for-the-buck bikes out there. I haven't seen other bikes at this price point that come with 105."
bicycling,fddslxe,t1_fddpct7,1578322920.0,"A good rule of thumb is to change the cassette with every third chain unless you start having issues before that. But that only applies if you actually change the chain every time it should be changed. If you ride an over stretched chain for too long it will wear the cassette much faster.

If you swap out the chain and you start having chain slipping issues the cassette is definitively worn. It it works fine there's most likely no need to change it."

She was black and white and was born in a monastery. She liked to chill under parked cars and always had oil stains on her back and sometimes her head. Unfortunately one day she in a car collision.

bicycling,fc8gyp4,t3_eghj5t,1577534678.0,"I think all my best rides were in 2019. I did 8 rides longer ghan 100 miles this year, two of them over 300km, and I toured in Asturias and Andalusia for two weeks each and I'm currently touring in the Canary Islands for another two weeks. All awesome tours and very different.  
My toughest ride by far was riding from Zurich to Milan across the Alps in one go. 300+km and lots climbing."
Ultralight,fbx8ivs,t3_eenr2m,1577174204.0,"I do a much simpler version of ""peanut noodles"". Just cook some spaghetti, drain the water, add 1 or 2 large scoops of crunchy peanut butter and maybe another pinch of salt, optionally add some paprika powder, mix and continue roasting on the flame for a minute, add olive oil until desired consistency is reached. Eat.

I accidentally discovered this when I ran out of tomato sauce. It's the shit."
AskReddit,fbqga4d,t1_fbo49af,1577031405.0,This happened to me almost on a regular basis when I was little. Hugging random people's legs or holding their hands when they wore a similar jacket as my mom or generally had a similar-looking lower half.
