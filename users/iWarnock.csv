So now soft tactics of bribery are over and cartel realized they can't bribe/blackmail their way in so they just go all out with .50 cals, rpgs, you name it, while our army only had automatic weapons but they were trained. 

So after months of carnage and the cartels getting obliterated (most of them are just guys that where in extreme poverty that got pulled into being a sicario, can't even speak proper spanish so by consequence can't aim shit) and the reported kills piling up higher than some middle eastern wars (with unofficial records much much higher). We got some peace, with cartels calming the fuck down and territories settled. 

Now enter our new president, ultra right dumb fuck that has no idea on how to wipe his ass and says he is removing the army from the streets because cartels are ""people"" and normal mexicans, with popular phrases such as ""abrazos no balazos - hugs no bullets"" ""díganles que los voy a acusar con su mama - i'm going to tell your mother if you keep misbehaving"" and stupid dumb shit like that. So as expected hell descended on earth and the center states of mexico are on fire, before this videos from 10 days ago the north has been business as usual and we were kinda ""pardoned"" of the violence the center is having (mostly because the north states to the east of the sierra madre have their cartel borders mostly in control), now lets see if the central cartel tries to take over the NE ones and well by now mexico should be completely on fire lol."
