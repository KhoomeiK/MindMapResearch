depression,fdml576,t3_elycos,1578554034.0,"Hi there,
I can fully relate to that. I'm 27 and  10 years or so are those lost years. I actually did nothing over these years. I lost my all my friends, if I can call them like that, cuz they were quite toxic. I have been taking medications since then but my real therapy started two yeras ago. I decided to finally visit psychologists and talk and talk and talk. Of course in the meantime I made many mistakes but I could finally learn from them and get my shit together. Nowadays I'm having few days episodes when I cry and even want to kill myself but  for the next day I am still alive again and have power to move on. I don't want to waste my life anymore. I'm still going to therapist, taking meds. I don't know if I ever be happy again and feel like a normal person. Maybe it is ok to feel different, it makes us special, kind of ;) 
I hope you will be better soon enough to move on. I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for you."

depression,fde6yxg,t1_fddfjlx,1578332543.0,My parents helped me a lot. I have been taking meds for almost 10 years. I had already two depression returns. Few months ago I thought I could lower my dose to minimum for spring but I have been feeling worse again. I dont have the strength anymore. I am wasted.
