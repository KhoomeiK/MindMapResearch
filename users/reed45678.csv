AskReddit,fcimr7s,t1_fcgqvnd,1577665165.0,"This us a double edged sword, stay ""just okay"" long enough and your internal monolouge will start to be negative towards yourself. If you push hard trying to break free from being only ""okay"" and youll tear yourself down and become a shell of who you were before. I find a good mix is when you put yourself in check but still allow yourself proper time to grow into the person you want to be. Change takes time and dwelling on standards can warp your veiw of how long real change can take sometimes. Rant over"
