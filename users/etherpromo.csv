>“We knew that sooner or later he was going to do something of this nature,” said Henry Rodriguez. “But not something this crazy.”   Miguel’s father talked about the times his son would stand outside the house and spit at cars or even try and kick them as they drove past.
According to the father, **Miguel’s sister has had to take out a restraining order against him due to sporadic violent attacks toward her**. The police were called, according to the family, **when he first started acting out three years ago**.  Miguel had been given medication by Baystate Medical Center, according to Henry but he didn’t take them.  “He said he’s not crazy. He said he didn’t feel nothing. He said he didn’t like the flavor of the medications ... We wanted him to take them but we couldn’t make him,” Henry said.  As the father spoke of his son, both Miguel’s brother and mother listened on the stairs. The whole family was shocked by the events of the day.  “We feel really bad, you know, as parents. We have kids ourselves,” said Rodriguez. ""We feel relieved that the girl was found safe and sound. We were relieved that nothing happened to that little girl and that she is back with her family. We are grateful she’s all right.

Family seems so fucking nonchalant about this shit too.  ""Ah yes, this issue; it was bound to happen sooner or later"".  The fuck, they're lucky their mentally impaired son didn't do anything worse."

>DHS estimated that the growth of the illegal immigrant population had slowed considerably, saying the population increased by 470,000 per year from 2000 to 2007, but only by 70,000 per year from 2010 to 2015.  CMS found a decline in the undocumented population, and specifically those from Mexico, of about 1 million since 2010. And the Pew Research Center found a peak of 12.2 million in the population in 2007, and a decline since.

Instead of a wall, we should have an army of drones that can just track border movement and send data real time to agents.
