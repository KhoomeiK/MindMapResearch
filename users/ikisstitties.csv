GreenBayPackers,ff3gmch,t1_ff3cgwh,1579540624.0,"> this organization would show no seriousness in getting to and winning another super bowl if Pettine isn’t at least considered for replacement 

and this is the difference between ted and gute. gute's shown that he is more than willing to make cutthroat decisions if he feels it will benefit the team"
GreenBayPackers,ff3gf02,t1_ff3emr0,1579540508.0,curious as to why you say no to Wade. he has a track record of very good defenses statistically.
GreenBayPackers,ff3g724,t3_erfh3r,1579540389.0,"i would agree that this does seem reactionary - but i find myself asking the same thing. the smith brothers talked about the lack of adjustments in their post game interview. lafleur seemed baffled by the fact that we couldn't contain the run even with a single-high safety set. these are not okay, especially the lack of adjustments."
nfl,fetohzr,t1_fetinxs,1579377629.0,can’t argue with that
nfl,fet7kmj,t1_fet6sgq,1579372478.0,that’s why i said time of possession would be an interesting stat to see. that also includes the production and efficiency from the offense when they did have the ball. i wasn’t trying to be so matter of fact with my comment. there’s obviously a lot that goes into it.
nfl,fesstgk,t1_fes8g69,1579368662.0,"tbf, if the D makes more stops, they’d have the ball more to score too. time of possession would be an interesting stat to see as well"

nba,fekhqvh,t1_fejc1pa,1579200294.0,the way he just sulks in his frustration while his teammates try to defend on the other side of the court boils my blood

nba,fejrlo1,t3_epemu4,1579184105.0,is this statistically considered a shot attempt and rebound? otherwise it doesn't make sense to me that you can only pass to yourself in this way.
GreenBayPackers,feeperl,t1_fee5v0w,1579038439.0,that stat is so fucking cherry-picked too. it was literally showing 3rd down and favors our offense. so we're looking at one down and one side of the ball to determine that the packers get all the calls? so stupid
GreenBayPackers,feak1pc,t1_feah8t3,1578949750.0,"yeah, i was looking at the seahawks sub today, and it seemed like most people weren't upset about it"

nfl,fdzzh5c,t1_fdzyuvb,1578799491.0,"yeah, 30 wins... the winner of the super bowl plays at least 3 games in the playoffs

nfl,fdhwyq9,t1_fdh9g2t,1578431660.0,"his career is far different than the average person's though. i think his career allows a lot more leeway to start because of his potential talent level. it's not apples to apples from person to person, and it certainly is much more different for an NFL QB."
AskReddit,fdhr5y8,t1_fdgwf5t,1578428558.0,"damn. i have been there. a couple days before my grandma died, my family and i were all over at her place. i went over right after work in the evening. we all knew it was happening and it was just a matter of when. she knew it too. she was 91. i remember i had a bad headache, felt very tired, and was super stressed because i knew i was going to be fired from my job in a couple weeks, so i wasn't very talkative. at one point i was sitting near her. she looked at me and said ""do you have anything to say?"" in a way that was more looking for conversation. i think i just kind of shook my head, and she said ""no?"" while i kept shaking my head. i know i should have tried harder to talk with her. i was so in the dumps at the time, and i just couldn't think of anything to say or talk about at that point. i still understand why i wasn't able to do it at the time, but i wish i would have tried harder than that."
nfl,fdhl6hr,t3_eldrd5,1578424989.0,i'd say it's pretty unfortunate imo though. they weren't able to pull mccarthy in (who i think would have been the best fit for them). there aren't any top well-known coaches with a good track record. they're going to be looking for a diamond in the rough at this point.
nfl,fdhjwni,t3_eldt3k,1578424215.0,i actually didn't know that harbaugh was a special teams coach. what are some other special teams coaches that have won the super bowl?
AskReddit,fdhj9cd,t1_fdh9m7u,1578423820.0,chiming in with r/ChoosingBeggars too. i'm sure there's a good number of legit posts on there. but so many of them seem to have the same format that i have a hard time believing a lot of it now
madisonwi,fdgxdwo,t1_fdgv9kw,1578410669.0,"this sounds more like a fuck-over than a fuck-up. to me, a fuck-up means it was a failed project. it doesn't seem to me like that was a failed project."
nfl,fdgx7iw,t1_fdgmtd9,1578410547.0,"yeah, this narrative is the correct one - not the one in this tweet. i keep seeing this getting posted and i don't understand it. he didn't utilize everyone around rodgers and our defense was shite"
madisonwi,fdgtkex,t1_fdg3b0b,1578407971.0,i'm very much out of the loop here. how was the x01 apartments a fuck up?
nfl,fdgt272,t1_fdgssn4,1578407599.0,"it's much easier to say that than it is to do it though. sometimes you have to go through hell to realize ""shit, i am not well. i gotta fix myself."""

nfl,fdehadi,t1_fddy25p,1578339003.0,and they're a perfect example of both that strategy working well when you draft well and that strategy not working well when you don't draft well.
GreenBayPackers,fdeeokn,t1_fddkjyn,1578337387.0,rooting for a game where each team looks just downright shitty and results with the 49ers just barely losing it
nfl,fde6ghz,t1_fde5jv3,1578332222.0,i don't think this is actually a rumor. rex ryan was just being a dumbass and brought it up as a possibility. not a very likely possibility imo

GreenBayPackers,fddzaf5,t1_fddvtmw,1578327587.0,i think this is one of the big questions that i haven't seen discussed here yet. obviously it would apply to any coach that could have been hired. but i think it's well known that jerry tries to influence coaching quite a bit too. i don't think that would fly with mccarthy and that certainly could cause some issues
GreenBayPackers,fddz0r5,t1_fddtmti,1578327408.0,uhhhh. no. the good thing is that he can't try and take pettine from us since it's a lateral move and not a promotion. unless he called him an assistant head coach perhaps?

GreenBayPackers,fddukvl,t3_ekv7kc,1578324350.0,"congrats to him. gonna be hard rooting for him in dallas, but it's also gonna be hard not to. as long as he's not coaching against the packers, then forget anything he's ever done for the packers"

GreenBayPackers,fcvg6ix,t1_fcuhbds,1578001414.0,"i had to unsubscribe from the packers podcast. pretty sure i dropped out after tom was trying to create a narrative of another rift between rodgers and lafleur after the chargers game. and then after rodgers had a perfect QBR against oakland, he still couldn't keep himself from criticizing rodgers. i swear, he's got a vendetta for him. he's just so frickin' negative. it just feels like he doesn't like the packers."

nfl,fcud14i,t1_fcu3klm,1577978097.0,"i think the thing about this though is that it's a lot harder to completely revamp your playbook in the offseason than doing it during the give or take 14 months that he's been unemployed. much easier to do now with the amount of time that he's had off
