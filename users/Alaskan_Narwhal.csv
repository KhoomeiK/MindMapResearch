MeepoBoards,ff7zpn4,t3_es4dbc,1579662240.0,"Have a v3, for a chinese company they are vey well built. Mine runs flawlessly at 600 miles. No maintenance unless you ride when its wet in which case disassembly and dry out the insides with a fan. Easy disassembly so thats not a problem. Its better not to ride wet because you can damage the board.

Very good, highly recommended for the price."
satisfactory,ff67690,t1_ff65rgt,1579620747.0,Idk man this studio has been pretty honest so far i believe them. I distrust if major game studios say its not microtransactions but this is a small team who has so far put out a good product.

college,fcmfura,t1_fcmdh5g,1577773702.0,Yea true its still crazy expensive
college,fclv1ti,t1_fclphvs,1577757158.0,Yea so about the same as us. The apartments are the most expensive but you can get triple occu for 6k a year
ElectricSkateboarding,fcluvwp,t1_fclpqdv,1577757043.0,"Clocked 3600 before the esc, he rides 2-3 charges a day. And yea motors sure but hes replaced the motors twice, the esc, battery, both cases / mount, the deck and now the back truck. He rides crazy. When the new esc wiped his log and he got it replaced he rode 400 miles in a week. My meepo has 300 and it shows more wear than his. It looks almost brand new. Also winter exists but we are in phoenix for college so the only winter we have is when we go home for break. Idk man boosted seems to be where its at."
ElectricSkateboarding,fclovnn,t1_fclo4to,1577752890.0,"Eh i disagree, things wear, do i think my meepo will last 4000 miles. No i dont. One part at a time but i attest to good customer service."
college,fclhnil,t1_fcl6qt6,1577748016.0,"Holy crap where are you, i pay 5200 and have a room to myself in a furnished apartment (besides couch"
ElectricSkateboarding,fcl73en,t1_fbfbwec,1577741227.0,"Ill have to disagree, my roomate has an x and boosted has replaced every part on that board without a second thought even though he was out of warranty and rides crazy. Its built super tough and has 4000 miles on it when he snapped the kingpin. I love my meepo but i would pay the extra money for build quality and support."
