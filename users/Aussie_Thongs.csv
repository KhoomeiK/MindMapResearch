One possible inconsistency id like to see if you can resolve for me.

You say: 

Ppl my argue they have a relationship with their horse who is well taken care of and ""likes to be ridden "" but of course horses can't talk and can't directly tell us if they are okay with it or are just conditioned into being okay with being ridden. Hence ""breaking in"" a wild horse, aka forcing it to stop fighting and let you ride

But before that for pet ownership generally you say owning a pet may be ok.

To me I fail to see a real difference between training a horse to be ridden and training a dog to obey all the commands a dog learns. Like the horse, there is a period where the dog *doesn't* want to do what you want it to, but through a system of psychological manipulation you curb its desires. Why do we do this? So we get the benefit of a nice pet.

It seems pet ownership of any kind should fall firmly outside of an ethical vegan lifestyle.

Its kind of moot anyway, because breeding animals for use as pets is *definitely* not vegan and largescale adoption of such a policy would mean there would be no pets alive to keep in a vegan world anyhow."

2) Trump looks strong and decisive to his base

Iran retaliates with rockets:

1) Get to look strong, defiant and brave to the Iranian people. 

2) Iran warned Iraq, who warned the US so that there were no casualties.

To be fair, its a 20 minute youtube video on a complex, it is oversimplified by default. I think you might be forgetting that he does go through how the key model relates to a democracy. In short, you need many more keys and each one is smaller.

Your criticism of the video is largely unrelated to my point though. Its not that important exactly where the cutoff is for the elite and lower classes, the appropriate level of seperation will be determined by many complex factors.

>It’s not limiting.  The most pertinent example we can draw upon are modern capitalist structures of hierarchy and power.

It is uneccesarily limiting. These concepts in relation to the elite - masses dynamic predated capitalism and included many sub-variants and iterations across places, times and cultures. 

> The only other power structure we really have to analyze is feudalism or ancient slave societies, which are long gone.

Exactly! You cant call the first 3000 odd years of recorded history 'the only other power structures' as if it pails in comparison to the last ~600 years. If that is not limiting I dont know whag to tell you lol. 

>But those same forms of tech can be used to increase SR. By building infrastructure and the internet, you permit the working masses a greater consciousness by exposing them to radical works and books

They can, but:

1) whats the elite's motivation to do so?

2) based on the behaviour of the elites in the last few decades, what do you think is the likelihood they would decide to keep us around? 

Why would I want the working masses to read radical shit and increase their consciousness? Thats only going to make them harder to control.

>By making the masses too comfortable, they inevitably ask the question why their rulers exist in the first place and why they’re necessary. 

I really strongly disagree here. A comfortable populace is a tame one, a hungry populace rebels. The rulers are deemed necessary because they own all the robot factories and hold all the AI patents. Its irrelevant anyway because they have sarin gas drones, nukes and that machine gun buggy on steroids and we dont. 

>I frankly don’t see how this contradicts or refutes what I said

You say its 'simply' economics. Its like saying its 'simply' brain surgery. The economic factors involved in the elite - working class dynamic are complex, not simple.

>The way the present ruling structure functions, it requires an under class to buy goods and products. That’s the whole basis on which capital functions.   

Key word there: present. That is the capitalist paradigm, my robovillage is post capitalist and effectively post scarcity. I no longer need to make a profit off selling the poor their own labor back to them. My automated workforce makes everything we need in abundance. So no, it does not require a human underclass.

> Without an exploited laboring class to produce the goods and then buy the goods they made, no capital profit can be made.

My robot workforce makes me a huge capital profit without any need whatsoever for a human proletariat. 

> The whole system becomes worthless.

Its the opposite of worthless. I have a self sustaining, limited population, automated workforce, highly advanced society. It is basically perfect nesting ground for an idealised kind of communism. The ultimate question is: why would the elite want to bring us along to that world? If they build it just for themselves it will be cheaper, easier, quicker and will fit into Earth's limited carrying capacity *much more easily*. There aint enough robocity for everyone if the wealthy want to live an opulent and uncrowded existence. Based on the elite of today I find it more than a little naive to think they wont shed us altogether when Sr = 0.

>Except that isn’t your goal. The goal of the capitalist isn’t to simply horde everything for himself. It’s to make profit

These have already been addressed so ill summarise. Im not a capitalist, im effectively a post scarcity communist. I have no need whatsoever for selling to make profit. We make everything we need.

>market system sweeps your away. This is the basis of our current system.

There is no market. This wont be our current system. This is what I mean by you limiting yourself to the capitalist paradigm. **It does not apply**. I think we can both agree capitalism has a use-by-date, why do you seem to insist it must necessarily apply when there is no longer a proletariat and the **former** capitalists are self sufficient?

>That doesn’t constitute a proletariat. The proletarians work for a wage to survive

The proletariat are decomposing outside the city walls. They dont need a wage anymore lol.

>The robots employed are merely another piece of capital

Not really. Capital, as far as I understand it, are assets that increase your ability to do useful work. The robots dont increase my useful work, they do it all for me! They are effectively all capital and all labor rolled into one, making human labor and those who rely on providing it to survive *superfluous*.

>Though I’m arguing from explicitly Marxist terms

Again, limiting, but I dont mind. Consider my society from the Marxist perspective then, it truly is a set of conditions under which a real and lasting ideal communist society could emerge. Marx said capitalism will be no more and communism will finally result, he may just be wrong about the outcome of the power struggle between proletariat and elite."

Youre right I didnt define the terms properly. In the context I use it, by elites I mean those people who make the majority of the most important decisions. So I would include rulers and also their 'keys' (google CGP Grey - keys of power on youtube). Imo its fair to say corporations' owners and executives are included, they hold incredible power in today's world.

>In the elites seeking more profit, they not only reduce the working class’s scraps through technology, but also through wages, benefits, safety conditions, pensions, and the like. The reason isn’t technology but the innate desire for the ruling elite to maximize their own wealth and capital profit. 

Its uneccesarily limiting to discuss this just within a capitalist framework because, to borrow a phrase, the problem is more innate. The elite will seek to minimise Sr under *any* system. Capitalism is a particularly compatible system for this though, I do concede that.

I would broadly agree with the elements of this but would restate it inline with my post:

the elites, like most humans, want to increase their relative power (and therefore wealth). Reducing Sr both gives the peasants less to fight you with and gives you more to fight them with. Technology is the number 1 way to reduce Sr. Roads, finance tech, healthcare, government surveillance, data gathering tech, improved entertainment etc all serve to satiate and/or dominate the masses better than before, all the while making more profit due to increasing efficiencies.

>I wouldn’t say this is remotely close to the communists. The communists demand a free and equal world without states or classes or money.

I think you have misunderstood the scope of that comparison. I only evoked the 'workers of the world unite' phrase to introduce the idea of people from different places but from the same class can work collectively. If the workers can unite, why cant the elite? Thats retorical, they already have. I did not mean to claim that the two movements were in any way similar at an ideological level.

> The elites of today simply want to be able to hire foreign labor for a fraction of the price of domestic labor. It’s simply economics and the natural tendency of capital. 

I think you need to review the use of the word simply lol. Economics is not simple, and I am making an economic argument as well as a political one. 

Hiring foreign labor is just one peace of the puzzle in reducing *your* working classes' bargaining position. Same with mass immigration, as Bernie Sanders himself says: 'open borders is a Koch brothers proposal'.

>They can’t. In giving the working classes literally nothing, the working classes could neither sustain themselves 

I think you are failing to fully appreciate the paradigm shift when we move from Sr > 0 to Sr = 0. Ill give you a hypothetical to illustrate:

Me and my elite mates are chilling in our walled robo-village. The robots fix and make themselves, solar panels, hydroponic farms etc. The AI runs the administration at a super efficient level. You and your hungry masses show up at our gate. Why the fuck should we let you past the laser turrets or the sarin gas spitting darpa drone? What the fuck do we need you for?

Once the elite few have severed their dependence on the working class completely by replacing them with robots and AI, what bargaining power do the masses have left? Feed you and give you medicine or you will throw yourselves against our unstoppable military tech? Oh no, what will we do???!!?

> nor buy the products that the ruling elite lay claim to (and to which the ruling elite make profit from).

The need for this disappears completely when Sr reaches zero. My robots are making better robots and my AI is programming better AI and solving more and more complext problems faster and faster. I dont need to leech profit from using the working class to produce, I produce it all myself and keep *everything*.

>Simply put, capitalism necessitates a wage-working class that must depend on their wage for their survival—a proletariat.

...the AI and robots ARE my working class. My techno-village is post capitalism baby!, for exactly the reasoning you give here. I dont need to pay my workers a wage, its the dawn of a new system. One where the lasting few have the tools to reach the stars without having to pollute and overpopulate the world."

politics,fdlvbvk,t1_fdltuxe,1578533351.0,">Person was willing to testify under oath 

Yeah but her testimony was *dog shit* tier. Seriously go back and watch it, its beyond pathetic.

>putting herself at risk if she was lying

Nope. For the same reason that a crime of that age is almost impossible to prove (even with logically consistent testimony lol) its almost impossible to prove she was lying. Perjury is really hard to prove even when the event being lied about is fresh.

>How long did that sham investigation last? 1 week.

Perfectly reasonable given the quality of the testimony.

>Think its appropriate for Senators to put a time limit on an rape investigation?

The testimony did not warrant an investigation. Such a thing would be a *terrible* precedent to set. Otherwise every new SC nominee could just get torpedoed with some 30 year old hoccum poccum nonsense. 

It was disgusting for the dems to even think that her story was enough to interrupt a very serious and important process. It was funny in a pathetic kind of way, just so god damn incompetent. 

>his perjury and outburst during questioning shows he is unfit to sit on SCOTUS.

Yeah, no. No perjury m8 that was literal fake news. The outburst was completely understandable and won him a lot of fans. How would you feel if you dedicated your life to a career and at the cusp of achieving such an honor someone tries to take it away with obvious, weak lies? He is passionate about justice, and he found the despicable tactics of the dems enraging. Absolutely fair enough.

>Kavanaugh is a political operative om the court, not a impartial jurist.

In a thread about RGB I can hardly believe someone is daring to throw the political operative accusation against *anyone* else. RGB has been touted for a long time as a model for activist progressive judges for her whole SC career.

Truly pathetic."

This is the natural progression. 

>Rich people are destroying the world by hoarding wealth. Its no longer a system of ""who works hardest gets the biggest rewards"" its whoever inherited tries to maintain it by keep everyone else down. 

This is pretty much exactly my point. We are getting more and more of it because we need to give you plebs less and less. Thats the progression and its only going to accelerate.

Do you deny the rich will no longer need you in the near future? What do you honestly think happens then?

Do you deny the planet would be better off if we just let the superfluous billions wither?"
