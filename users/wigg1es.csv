I grew up in an ultra-clean house. My mom was always cleaning and my dad was always doing some shit in the yard. I've walked into the living room to find my mom straightening the tassels on the rug with a comb. It was that kind of house.

But that's literally all my parents do. If they weren't at work they were at home, either cleaning, cooking, reading the paper, or watching the news. They never really had hobbies or traveled. I was there hobby really.

Now that I'm older, I spend my time much differently. I spend time online, playing video games, I go out and spend more time on leisure activities simply because there are more available to me.

Just very basically, you have to have a time frame to budget over so you can at least begin to anticipate costs, and you also need a time frame so you can go to investors and explain how the money will be used and when they can begin to expect a return. And that's only the simplest example I can think of.

In a perfect world, yes, we could say ""the game is finished when its finished"" and everyone would be on board, but we also can't have every game be Star Citizen and never actually be finished.

AAA games are going to continue to get larger, more complex, and more difficult to develop. So we have to make a choice. Either we allow for longer development timelines, which the investment side of the industry doesn't really want, or we ""accept"" that games are going to be imperfect at launch and we now live in the world of post-launch patches."

It doesn't have anything to do with player power or being ""OP,"" its about the challenge and the journey to get there.

And even if they do have a loot system that makes you OP at endgame, so what? Build a game that is replayable from the start. Again, Diablo. Or Borderlands. or Dark Souls. Multiple different characters, builds, and playstyles that encourage the player to start over and face a new set of challenges if their current game does feel OP and boring.

Then the game releases new content tuned for your current ""OP"" level, which makes ""OP"" now baseline. So you play 3/4 of the new content, do it all again, and become ""OP"" again for the last 1/4.

Have you never played an MMO or ARPG before? This is exactly how Diablo works. You can absolutely feel OP in Diablo, even in T6. But there are plenty of places to go beyond T6 where you don't feel so OP, so you have incentive to keep grinding for marginal gains to be a little more OP."

Normally Hammer Throws are done on a grass, sand, or gravel arena. This looks to be indoor off-season training. The floor is probably heavy-duty rubber to soften the impact, and you have the guy out there to mark where the hammer lands, because normally it doesn't bounce and bounces don't count towards the distance of your throw.

And some of the bosses like Security Droid and Rabid Jotaz are just slightly more punishing versions of regular enemies, which is pretty cheap.

I like the game overall. I think they did the Uncharted-style set pieces really well (like AT-AT hijacking and such), the environments are well-crafted, and they built a cool chunk of the Star Wars universe. But the combat and boss fights are one of the weakest areas of the game, I feel."
