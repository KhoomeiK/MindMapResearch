Being too expensive is a common complaint when it comes to plant based diets. And you're right when it comes to all of the ""vegan version"" stuff. That crap is expensive. I see those things as occasional treats. Not the base of the diet.

I feel like your friend should have worked with you on the cost of things before saying what they did about it (if they really cared that much). But really, avoiding fiber on a plant based diet sounds like hell to me. A reasonable person would understand that."
GetMotivated,fet1qvj,t1_fest3ze,1579371001.0,"That's probably true but at least there's an end to the student life. When that end comes, you're likely to begin seeing the rewards for your sacrifice. Scheduling around work is what it is and goes on unchanging until you retire.

Obviously the type of work you're able to find right out of school or in your early 20s matters. My gf found a great job that she's been at for over 13 years. Pay comparable to people who have gone to college, benefits, and many advancements over the years. I, however, have bounced from one dead end job to the next trying to find something with a future with nothing but my hs diploma. I missed living for a good amount of my 20s thanks to 60+ hour work weeks on 2nd or 3rd shift schedules with nothing to show for it. 

There are too many variables to really say which is better or worse. Medical school is absolutely going to require sacrificing a good amount (or all) of your 20s. A full time job might or might not. Depends on what you want by the time you hit your 30s."
GetMotivated,feszewj,t1_fesrcv5,1579370442.0,"That's true but so are many jobs. Many people I know (myself included at past jobs) consistently work 50-60+ hours per week. Adding in the fact that many full time jobs work on a shift structure meaning you could be working 8-12 hours every afternoon+evening or overnight when you should be sleeping. 

Point is, making time for a life in your 20s is often difficult whether you go to school or not. Don't let that be what's holding you back."
AmItheAsshole,fesvrj1,t3_eqfixn,1579369520.0,"NTA because ultimately it's your life to live and your decision on how you live it. BUT I was a little unsure about the quality of your vegan diet as you were describing your health while eating it. Everyone's body is different though so maybe. But then you said you can't afford it and you lost me. Body's may be different but money is money. A plant based diet can be expensive. Especially if you're buying vegan junk food. Prepackaged vegan burritos for example are literally 9 times more expensive than the regular burritos at my local grocery store. Certain ""oddball"" veggies can be expensive but things like rice and beans are among the cheapest foods in the store. 

I wasn't there to see your diet and honestly, as far as I'm concerned, you can quit for any reason you want. Like I said, it's your life. But, based only on the info given, it sounds to me like you might not have been eating the best vegan diet. From experience, I can say that's it's tough at first to figure out how to suddenly stop eating everything you've ever eaten and switch to foods you're totally unfamiliar with. 

I'm not trying to blame you at all. I'm just saying don't necessarily blame the diet either. If anything, I blame the over zealous, militant friend that pushed you into the diet but doesn't sound like they could be bothered to support you and teach you to make it healthy and sustainable."
GetMotivated,fesqcdw,t1_fesmf1q,1579367914.0,I think they mean you have to schedule your life around anything whether it's school or a full time job. Counting having to schedule your life around school as a negative doesn't make sense as you'd have to schedule your life around a full time job if you didn't go to school.
