AmItheAsshole,ff7zx0i,t3_erwdex,1579662384.0,"NAH

You probably should have explained it better, like say, I'm only going wedding shopping with my close family (if that's the case). But I'm from a really small town, and if I had a co-worker I haven't known that long offer to go with me, I would've been weirded out!

Just because you work with people doesn't mean you need to be friends (none of my coworkers are coming to my wedding, as it's almost all family or friends since childhood).

If you are from a big city and already had a bunch of friends coming, then maybe you could've let her come along, and maybe you are the asshole. But if you want it to be a small intimate affair, it's your wedding. 

You can take her out for a drink one night and try and make peace."
