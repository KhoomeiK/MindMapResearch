pcmasterrace,ff87ej1,t1_ff8644f,1579668125.0,"Ok hahaha that makes more sense! 

Just did some very light reading and seems like its a non playable game, even if its just at certain points, on PC as of right now. So I will just have to wait until they fix all the bugs before indulging in it. 

Still going to upgrade though lol so i will look into your suggestion!"
pcmasterrace,ff85tsi,t1_ff854a1,1579666811.0,"Well the game I am having issues with right now, specifically, is just the demo version of Detroit: Become Human. Wanted to see if I liked it or not but I can't get more then 30 seconds into gameplay without it crashing and saying some stuff about the graphics card. Not sure if it would be considered CPU-intensive or not. 

Im a little confused by ""such a great combo i cannot recommend it though"". Why would you not recommend it?"
trashy,ff7z718,t1_ff7dw8i,1579661875.0,Hence why i always try to go with honda or toyota. They are beasts. We have a saying in michigan where the body will rust off before then engine dies lol have a 97 accord at 208k miles still runs like a champ after putting 100k+ on it the last 2 years. My 93 accord was a champ. Have had zero problems (besides typical wear and tare) with either of them. Every other car I've owned (sadly chrysler products) were pieces of shit and i had nothing BUT issues with them.
trashy,ff7yswd,t1_ff7kpjg,1579661601.0,You have to FULLY prove without a doubt that it was because of the car and this email will not do that. And in a lot of cases that still wont work. The company can fire you just to fire you if they want.
CasualUK,ff66lsh,t1_ff5mlwe,1579620374.0,Use a debit card or something like that and you'll be done im 30 seconds haha especially for that thin frost that scrapers do nothing for lol
Cigarettes,ff65k3s,t1_ff4txb7,1579619656.0,"Lol no on one being ""mostly air"". Same amount of tobacco just more air going through the paper. Worked at a smoke shop for almost 8 years where main sales were tobacco hahah"
funny,ff4ezfg,t3_erlhnx,1579562021.0,Excuse me..... Your balls are showing.
Cigarettes,ff3vxq9,t1_ff3ull3,1579550026.0,"Idk im just saying it feels like more air because you are literally getting more air because of more holes in the paper but you are smoking the same tobacco and same amount of tobacco

Edit: i will correct myself. It is not always the same tobacco. They do have different ""blends"" sometimes for light cigs which can just consist of a different strain of tobacco. But it is all still the same amount of tobacco."
Cigarettes,ff3qefe,t1_ff2ccvr,1579546607.0,"""Light"" cigs aren't any ""healthier"" they just have more perforation in the paper to allow more air flow. Just a little fyi for the day :)"
Cigarettes,ff3q6o8,t1_ff2jcxz,1579546476.0,Agree and i dont get the dizzy feeling i would ALWAYS get with marlboros. Sure i get it first cig of the day but thats because of the nicotine lol
Cigarettes,ff3q1l9,t1_ff2udrj,1579546390.0,Yup hahaha o do that too especially on my half hour breaks lol
Cigarettes,ff1wmm2,t3_er6ily,1579487855.0,American spirits. Just tobacco and water. Yes they are slightly more expensive but they last way longer because there's no additives to make it burn quicker so it makes up for the cost. For example i was bummed 2 Marlboro lights for the ride home and smoked both of those by the time i got home. A spirit lasts me until i get out of the car in the drive way.
Panera,ff1wavc,t1_fewu4r8,1579487635.0,"Well it is literally ""panera standard"" and in the build instructions to have whip on it. Only ones that don't are cafe lattes"
feemagers,ff1w3be,t3_er6in7,1579487496.0,"Just start talking to her and get to know her. Just be calm and try to talk at a normal level. Honestly it doesn't seem to be a deal breaker for most women so i don't think you have much to worry about :)

My bf is a rather loud fella and so are his friends but i am very quiet. A tip for being in a relationship like that (even for future relationships if this one doesn't work out) is notice when she is trying to say something. There's nothing more defeating and frustrating then trying to be in a conversation with him and his friends and not being able to get a word in. Usually it gets to a point where i just sit there and don't say anything. And don't tell her to ""just speak up"" not that easy for us quiet people lol"
absolutelynotme_irl,feyxwoy,t3_equ0s3,1579451796.0,"Work with an incredibly religious home schooled kid......this is how he acts to a T. According to him the same sex can hold hands but you can not hold hands with the opposite sex until you're married. Still amazes me that people live such sheltered lives in todays day. Its sad because it has very clearly effected his social skills. Thankfully he is allowed to have a normal job so he is learning them later in life but still. Kinda sad. Mind you he is also the type of person that says all other religions are ""stupid"" and calls people sinners and what not. Incredibly judgmental for being so religious. As an almost 27 year old i take time to calmly try to explain things to him and i have gotten through to him a handful of times but he has a rough life ahead of him if he keeps on the path he is on."
Panera,few3z6r,t1_fdk5f6z,1579405022.0,One of those people here lol not uncommon for me to work 14 hr days or 60hr weeks but that's one of the many reasons im being move up to shift in less then a year of being there.
Panera,few3m2w,t3_emuzrq,1579404870.0,This cracks me up because everyone had a hissy fit when the french onion was discontinued......guess what we barely sell now that its back? You guessed it. The french onion soup.

I have that too but its literally MAYBE 2% lmao I've mostly only known about my polish/Slovakian heritage so that's what i mostly identify with. Now that i know im a quarter german it will be something i say but not something that will be boasted about if that makes sense lol
BeAmazed,fdfkl6y,t1_fdfhqjb,1578363875.0,I just found out im 25% german at the age of 26 which i had zero clue about. I vow to not hone in on this part of me hahahah

BeardedDragons,fcrd7pu,t3_eikt4c,1577900256.0,They are expensive but you don't strictly have to stick with them. I honestly would suggest not strictly sticking with them. Mix it up with crickets and other worms. Crickets cut costs down and help with nutrition. We also use super worms which are great for them

Considering (well I was doing a quick search for this) that a 45 (that's from around the same era as this one) of ""love me tender"" by elvis is going for 125 bucks i would have to say this probably isn't worth much.

vinyl,fcbnji0,t3_eh0i33,1577588892.0,Don't know if you want everything brand new or not but i highly suggest looking at local thrift stores or like salvation army's for speakers.

aww,fcb68e8,t1_fcb4ucs,1577582897.0,Well not only that but should be fresh greens and live insects. Way better source of all the nutrients they need then the freeze dried stuff.

BeardedDragons,fc79s5g,t1_fc797oq,1577501306.0,"I highly suggest feeding live food. We feed ours (about the same size in length) live large crickets and super worms on top of that plus leave a bowl full of ""greens"" for aries to eat throughout the day. I would say after two feedings of 10min free for all eating aries eats anywhere from 20-40 crickets and about 5-8 super worms on top of that just depends on the day and if she decided to eat some greens.

Edited to add: so i just looked at the link. Please start feeding live food and fresh ""greens"". It is way more healthy for them and gets them the nutrition they need. Im not am expert by any means but i cant imagine a diet of just this stuff is anywhere near as beneficial as real food."
BeardedDragons,fc77pmq,t3_egkf6w,1577499753.0,Might help to include the feeding routine :)
