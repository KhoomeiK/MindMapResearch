Glad that he is ok and didn't blow his head or his dick off. 

Hopefully other people will learn from this. 

Damn funny though."

I, myself, am 29 and only just now getting into my ""career"" over the last year. I graduated at 24 and had some ups and downs. My career field is in the same ballpark as what I went to school for but it is not what I expected to be doing nor what I attempted to find a job in.

Just live life the way you need to for you. Don't let people set these success deadlines. Don't feel disappointed if you end up on a different path. Things will always change. As long as you end up making yourself happy, that is what matters."

AskReddit,femdr5m,t1_femd5ef,1579250266.0,"I don't have any sibling of my own. However, I would think it would be extremely weird to treat your child as a sibling and have your child treat you as a sibling (of course due to their ignorance of the situation).

I personally think automatically assuming something is based on race is part of the problem with racism still.   
I believe that in this case, it is one of two things, either the people on the video are acting in poor taste or they are actually like that. Either way, it doesn't make it racist for people to assume they are the way that they are seen in the video."

So either he knew the details and forgot, or he is fairly ignorant and changed his mind over a more simplistic reason. 

Not really harshly judging someone based on their race here. I think people would assume the same of any race here if they behaved in the same manner. 

It's no one's particular fault that the guy in the video just happens to fit a certain archetype."

\*  
then just now, the stuff you suggested.  
The only way I could get it to work was either \~R \*, \~R \*WifiName, or \~R \*WifiName\* but it only seemed to match my SSID if I started with \~R followed by an asterisk.
