If your real lucky and live where you park on the street. you get to shovel your car out only to be buried again by the snowplows. You know you've hit the lottery when you get home from work and someone too lazy to shovel out their own spot, is parked where you spent an hour shoveling before the sun came up. 

That's why I now live in Texas."

I was visiting an elderly family member in a local nursing home just in time for medication.  They're giving these poor souls drugs to keep them alive so they can sit in their wheelchairs and stare at a wall for 16 hours a day. Not my cup of tea.  I'd prefer to choose my fate. 

It really is dark but after a certain age there ain't no sunshine."

I wonder why people don't like daylight saving. 

I guess if your an inside person rather than an outside person and prefer to lock yourself inside in front of the computer or tv then you wouldn't like daylight savings.

galveston,fec5id1,t3_eo725x,1578966957.0,We dangle chicken necks off a pier or boat dock & catch lots of crabs. (Use a string) You need a net to scoop them up after they grab the chicken then put them in a bucket. Its really a lot of fun. We catch 1/2 a dozen then empty the bucket and watch them scurry back to the water. Our kids always loved doing that.
