dogs,ff84vez,t1_ff84kve,1579666051.0,We are switching foods regardless and I wondered about the genetic component as well. Hopefully the cardiologist will have more insight as they will also test his taurine levels.
dogs,ff84n5h,t1_ff8489q,1579665877.0,Thank you so much. Would be seeing the cardiologist ASAP but they didn’t have anything until next week.
dogs,ff84kgv,t1_ff844h9,1579665819.0,Yes I wondered about the genetic component as well and in my shock I didn’t think to bring it up.
dogs,ff841w9,t1_ff83mmp,1579665425.0,"Agreed, and we obviously don’t take his comment as truth or fact."
AskReddit,feur3yq,t1_fesxazv,1579389155.0,This same exact thing happened to me but it was a police car with sirens sounding coming from behind. To this day I have no clue what I experienced.
Aquascape,fem177f,t3_epql8s,1579236443.0,So beautiful. Looks like a great place for the fish and adds wonderful ambiance to the room

"" Do not stand at my grave and weep 

I am not there. I do not sleep. 

I am a thousand winds that blow. 

I am the diamond glints on snow. 

I am the sunlight on ripened grain. 

I am the gentle autumn rain. 

When you awaken in the morning's hush 

I am the swift uplifting rush 

Of quiet birds in circled flight. 

I am the soft stars that shine at night. 

Do not stand at my grave and cry; 

I am not there. I did not die. ""

cats,fdngo8g,t1_fdm7w4x,1578585413.0,Is it true that it’s only for outdoor cats? Our cats are indoor only. Though we built them a catio in the backyard but they don’t touch any soil/dirt/grass.
cbdinfo,fdfqf48,t3_el27o7,1578367713.0,I appreciate this video. I am suuuper sensitive to THC (even though I was a fat stoner for years) now that I’ve stopped using cannabis. I have had this issue where I’ve consumed CBD that claimed to be THC free and I legitimately felt high and it was unpleasant since I wasn’t expecting it.
WLMFMOM,fcxlp3r,t3_ej9s9a,1578065954.0,"Hi! I’m 9mo pp and looking to lose 20-25lbs. I have started weight watchers- anybody else? Let’s be friends on there! My biggest issues are eating out (I hate cooking) and sugar consumption, literally every day I need chocolate/something sweet (usually multiple times a day). I stay home FT but am going back to work 2 days a week at the end of the month. I miss working out as I used to do it regularly but man, it is SO hard for me to find the energy and prioritize it."
weightlossafterbaby,fcwkelx,t3_ej30ld,1578028046.0,I’m interested! I’m 9mo pp and have about 25lbs to lose.
wholesomebpt,fcma2bw,t1_fclnzhk,1577768348.0,"My dad would carry me to bed after falling asleep in the living room watching tv with him. I used to pretend still being asleep. I can still feel my head on his shoulder and the way he so gently, lovingly laid me down. I lost my dad when I was 14 and even now at 32 I yearn for those small moments again. It is so true that it’s the small things. Hope you’re living life the best you can despite carrying the grief in your heart <3"

relationship_advice,fcimqim,t1_fch85xb,1577665156.0,"“That” thing you’re referring to is a BABY who never asked to be born. A human being who will grow up to have thoughts and feelings and joys and sadness, etc. The family gatherings do not have to always be clusters if the sister got her shit together and stopped with her selfish behavior. Overall, the family sounds toxic (w/the mom obviously not taking OP’s side). Seems like OP & baby are better off creating their own family unit away from that unhealthy drama."
NoStupidQuestions,fcc378b,t3_egxloj,1577593894.0,"You’re over tired. It’s a real thing. In your case I would make the environment conducive to sleep- black out curtains, white noise machine, do not go on phone before bed or when you wake up after 3-4hrs. Another option is to medicate with herbal remedy or cannabis or prescribed sleeping pills."
NoStupidQuestions,fcc2ruf,t3_egzehn,1577593759.0,"There is an actual criteria of MBP in the DSM 5, which is used by medical and mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders. Usually doctors will pick up signs when the parent completely disregards doctors suggestions or assurances. Also, lying- the mother might say “yes we did this or that” but actual medical evidence suggests otherwise, for example. An overly concerned parent would present as anxious whereas a munchhausen parent may present as confident in their suspicion of something being wrong, they’d use medical language to be more convincing etc."
NoStupidQuestions,fcc0dw4,t3_eh0ipf,1577592993.0,"Track what you eat. It is literally calories in vs calories out. But something like this is too much start even smaller. Cut out all soda and sugary drinks, guaranteed you’ll lose weight from that quick!"
AskWomenOver30,fcavmso,t3_egtuz6,1577577500.0,"I get exactly what you mean, you explained it so well. I feel this way too, especially because I am never able to be my “real” self in their presence. Luckily they live far way and we only see them every few months. But now that I had a baby my MIL comes monthly and it does get tiresome even though it’s only monthly. I had to just stop caring as much- can’t have a clean house every time she comes, all well if she hears me cussing or something. It was exhausting trying to keep up and tbh I really don’t care if her opinion of me changes!"

interestingasfuck,fc4km20,t1_fc4hct4,1577419426.0,This is so awesome. Wish I could go mine hunting with them!
TooAfraidToAsk,fc1yzts,t3_efpatj,1577334187.0,"It tastes chemically (maybe a little metallic?)  and has a numbing effect when rubbed in the mouth/on the gums. It has a very distinct “smell” that is obviously experienced when you snort it, though I feel the way it smells is different than how it tastes."
TooAfraidToAsk,fc1yo72,t3_efpsfv,1577333879.0,This is my perception with regard to social issues but I’ve always thought it’s because there is more of a divide between church and state in the EU.
TooAfraidToAsk,fc1yjqc,t3_efnmzf,1577333759.0,"There is no “right” way to grieve. The main thing to look for is if this anger interferes with your capacity to live you life. If you stay in this anger for years then I would encourage you to seek therapy because there is something called “complicated grief” where a person get stuck in one particular emotion and it leads to a downfall to quality of life. However, your anger is understandable and needs to be seen. The fact that your mother didn’t want to see you shows that she too, is having a tough grieving experience and perhaps she is not approaching it in the best way. But again, every family has their different experience. The loss is still so fresh- be kind and loving to yourself. Grief knows no timeline and will forever be with us. But time begins to sew the broken heart back together but the scar remains."
TooAfraidToAsk,fc1y23a,t3_efplyp,1577333292.0,Mommy issues. Sounds like you were not given a healthy female figure to learn how to connect with and/or feel safe around so it’s only natural to feel weird toward them. I’m kinda the opposite of you- I often feel weird and uncomfortable around older white men (I am white.) I feel like they are all pervs who see me sexually. But I’ve never been abused by one and had a good relationship with my dad and he was not like that AT ALL.
ambien,fbfjp68,t3_ebol0p,1576812244.0,"This is called rebound anxiety. It’s an actual thing. And it happens to many after a night of drinking, taking Benadryl to sleep for too many days in a row, etc."
