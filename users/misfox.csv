weddingplanning,fdq3hvj,t3_elnxia,1578653060.0,"I'm also worried about this! I've heard so many different ""rules"". 
I think 1-1.5 gifts per person/couple. We are doing an online registry where guests can share the cost of more expensive gifts, so we have fewer gifts with the assumption people will double up.
I'm also working on the basis it will average $100-200 per person/couple (although my gifts range from $10-300 plus an open honeymoon fund).
So for my 50-60 guest wedding, I'm aiming for 40-50 items valuing $5000-$6000. Better to have too much than not enough though so I'm still slowly tweaking it as I get ideas."
