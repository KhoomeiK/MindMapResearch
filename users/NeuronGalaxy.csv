awfuleverything,ffg48dp,t1_fffarh0,1579898115.0,"Camera on video. People don’t record and take the pictures by frame picking after the video has been recorded. Which could be a LPT.

Edit: Actually it’s easily available when you’re recording to take pictures. I don’t understand why there isn’t an onscreen button/option to “capture the frame” while watching your recorded video.

You can take a screenshot of a paused place on video but you should be able to spam it like you can spam the camera while taking pictures.
