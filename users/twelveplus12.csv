funny,ffb3k2a,t1_ffb05bx,1579750883.0,"I’m not saying you are wrong. Different approaches. Animals  are not buffoons for our enjoyment. They are not freeloaders. They all have jobs. 
Their domesticated toy play is all they have left of wild. They support us the best they can - from their first domicile with us in caves. And they took that as their job within a clan. Our border collies pen the flock, then wait for the kids to come home off the bus, same time everyday. You cannot sway them from this task. 

Animals protect the homestead, go for hunting excursions, clear the yard of squirrels, round up the neighbor kids or sheep,, watch out over us, comfort us and entertain us by their own spontaneity. They are actually working for us.

Yes, I am overreacting and am lightening up, I made a quip not anticipating reaction.  My dogs work, my horses are pasture ornaments. They are my babies and I spoil them and ride them by I don’t do things to then to make me laugh. Laughing is best gotten by dares to touch the high voltage fence."

I did find it satisfying, very satisfying for all the veggies not to be surrounded by flaking skin, eyes, stems. Store opens, the show lasts all of 12 minutes with the customers"

This isn’t an anti animal or anti Op. it’s just can we not leave things alone without pestering? Especially because we’re bored. Kids do that."

Mine is a border collie. Crazy driven with sheep, geese and tennis balls, also crazy good and smart, 6 yrs old.

He lets little kids read to him at local school and gently rounds them back to the group if they wander.  It then becomes a game. 
We don’t deserve dogs."
