That's the best market for 3D printed products, because it's niche enough that making injection molded parts would be wasteful, and with injection molding you can't just edit a model to customize the part.

The reason why most commercial places that make custom stuff require big orders (like 100 t-shirts or 1000 buttons) is because factory stuff like that needs quite a bit of investment for each custom design, so they can't afford to just do single pieces of anything.

3D prints have none of that, you just get the model and off you go with barely any investment.

RDR2,fc4lowy,t1_fc42kd2,1577420361.0,"Of course it's a subjective opinion based on where I live, just like yours is.

But Rockstar did have the choice of just making the ground white and having light snow like with GTAO. You know, the fun christmasy kind of snow. Instead they put in a permanent storm that swaps between heavy rain, sleet and a blizzard that forces new players to seek shelter constantly because they cant afford warm clothes."
RDR2,fc3oy58,t1_fc2g48w,1577394987.0,The entirety of Finland is further north than [half of Canada](https://africamostrase.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Map-of-World-map-with-longitude-latitude-and-longitude-map-world-map-with-latitude-longitude-map-longitude-with-of-Map-World-.jpg).
holdmycosmo,fbzxye5,t1_fbz9khx,1577267756.0,"I own a Vive and I handle the upkeep on the PSVR we have at work (community center type of nonprofit). I was the one that suggested getting a PSVR there since we already had a PS4, and I regret that. I didn't know beforehand what it's actually like."
SteamVR,fbzv3b5,t1_fbztwtw,1577263154.0,"You can point and click at the banner in front of the trophy from a short distance, like a foot away maybe, and it opens statistics about how many hours you have in the game. I cant remember if it lets you also launch the game, it might have a button for it."
insanepeoplefacebook,fbyzzu3,t1_fbyr02u,1577231023.0,"The picture being from an Australian page doesn't say anything. I follow plenty of American pages on Facebook, yet I'm not American."
SteamVR,fbysccc,t1_fbyquhz,1577225022.0,"It wasn't working fine. Half the settings weren't available inside VR and you had to take off the HMD, go to the PC, change the settings, maybe restart SteamVR and then go back into VR. And stuff in the dashboard was glitchy as hell, for example the desktop view was hellish if you have multiple monitors.

Just because they released a buggy update doesn't mean the update wasn't needed."
holdmycosmo,fbxmlsy,t1_fbx9ofa,1577194030.0,"Dont recommend PSVR to people. Its obsolete. The controllers and tracking camera are 9 (almost 10) year old technology. Plus youre only going to disappoint people when they find out it doesnt really have that many other games.

Recommend the Oculus Quest instead if you want to recommend something that doesnt need a PC, it came out like 2 months ago and only costs 500 dollars with the controllers included. It can also optionally be plugged into a PC, but its not meant as a permanent thing."
