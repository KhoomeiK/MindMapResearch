geegees,ff4c4o8,t1_ff497l6,1579560134.0,"That's a good idea, since otherwise the math courses who would be taking will take up future electives, if not be able to transfer at all (since there's limited free electives). Definitely talk to an academic advisor just to figure out the easiest way for you"
loseit,ff43n50,t1_ff3yzpw,1579554821.0,Maybe you should see about a proper bf% test to use as a measure of health. It helps alleviate the complexity of being more of an outlier
fatlogic,ff3k98l,t1_ff3eb4p,1579542833.0,Where are you getting 600 calories a day?
fatlogic,ff3k5lu,t1_ff3hqqe,1579542772.0,"Is it not saying she's typically given 1500 calories / day to consume, and then any exercise added (e.g. 100 calories burned doing whatever) it tacks on 40% of the burned calories to also consume. Thus putting her up to 1540"
GreekMythology,ff3jmzh,t1_ff3alnt,1579542459.0,I agree
progresspics,ff2ywqg,t3_er2imm,1579529035.0,"I know it's not the focus of the post, but look at those face gains! Your cheeks are chiseled now"
lgbt,ff2y0hc,t3_erao96,1579528230.0,You look a bit like cara delavigne
TrueOffMyChest,ff2x6rv,t1_ff2m0ez,1579527459.0,"Obviously not OP, but check out r/loseit for dietary advice and support"

fatlogic,fet81sx,t1_fensoxc,1579372607.0,"It's reached -30 Celsius (-22F) here with the windchill so I've been unable to do my morning walks to the bus (20ish minutes) and I miss doing them. I considered walking around a mall en lieu, but it's not the same"
GirlGamers,fepoz17,t3_eq749y,1579326525.0,Same! Did you buy it on sale over the winter break as well?
geegees,fdsj86a,t3_emtss2,1578703798.0,"Regardless of the teaching situation, know that the textbook for the course is pretty good, though dry (it's databases, what can you expect) so if needed you can entirely rely on it for a good mark"
fatlogic,fdo60zf,t1_fdnk2xa,1578599510.0,"I agree with this comment. You don't need to mention how drastic your CICO deficit was, just say it's how you lost it. No need for extra details"
geegees,fdgf11a,t1_fdff1e1,1578393749.0,"Exactly this. I had it with a different prof, who was alright but taught very slowly. I showed up to every lecture but just read the textbook and made my own notes"
loseit,fd4mq53,t3_ejy0r8,1578168982.0,You can also water down your juices to make them more calorie efficient
fatlogic,fd399gg,t1_fcyo23m,1578155949.0,"There's no need for perfect accuracy though. I'm a big math person, but I relate calorie counting more to how we judge the time complexity of computer programs than to perfect algebraic equations. For time complexity, a lot or rounding is involved and we justify dropping little additions because they don't contribute much in comparison to the larger components. So long as the answer gives the bigger picture then it's good enough"
fatlogic,fcouu1d,t3_eibhqb,1577842174.0,Nutrition labels are fatphobic
fatlogic,fcouq9v,t3_eia9xq,1577842092.0,"When you're flipping through channels, come across the food network, and kind of want to try what they're making, that's a hunger cue sweaty, not just you thinking it would taste good"
