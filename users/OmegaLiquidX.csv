https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/17/william-barber-tipping-racist-past-227361

""You might not think of tipping as a legacy of slavery, but it has a far more racialized history than most Americans realize. Tipping originated in feudal Europe and was imported back to the United States by American travelers eager to seem sophisticated. The practice spread throughout the country after the Civil War as U.S. employers, largely in the hospitality sector, looked for ways to avoid paying formerly enslaved workers.

One of the most notorious examples comes from the Pullman Company, which hired newly freed African American men as porters. Rather than paying them a real wage, Pullman provided the black porters with just a meager pittance, forcing them to rely on tips from their white clientele for most of their pay. 

Tipping further entrenched a unique and often racialized class structure in service jobs, in which workers must please both customer and employer to earn anything at all. A journalist quoted in Kerry Segrave’s 2009 book, Tipping: An American Social History of Gratuities, wrote in 1902 that he was embarrassed to offer a tip to a white man. “Negroes take tips, of course; one expects that of them—it is a token of their inferiority,” he wrote. “Tips go with servility, and no man who is a voter in this country is in the least justified in being in service.”

The immorality of paying an insufficient wage to workers, who then were forced to rely on tips, was acknowledged at the time. In his popular 1916 anti-tipping study, The Itching Palm, writer William Scott described tipping as an aristocratic custom that went against American ideals. “The relation of a man giving a tip and a man accepting it is as undemocratic as the relation of master and slave,” Scott wrote. “A citizen in a republic ought to stand shoulder to shoulder with every other citizen, with no thought of cringing, without an assumption of superiority or an acknowledgment of inferiority.” 

Several states sought to end the practice in the early 1900s, often in recognition of its racist roots. But the restaurant industry fought back and was powerful enough to roll back local bans on tipping. And tipped workers—along with most others, as the act applied to industries that together made up only one-fifth of the labor force—were excluded from the first, limited federal minimum wage law passed in 1938. 

It took until 1966 for advocates to win a base wage for tipped workers, and that amounted to only 50 percent of the minimum wage already guaranteed to other workers. Congress continued to raise the subminimum tipped wage until 1996, when Herman Cain, who headed the National Restaurant Association at the time, offered legislators a bargain: The industry would accept a small increase in the minimum wage as long as the tipped wage was frozen at $2.13 an hour.

Congress agreed to the deal, and the tipped minimum wage remains just $2.13 to this day. Employers are supposed to pay the difference if tips don’t bring workers to the full regular minimum wage. But too often that law is not enforced. When the Department of Labor conducted an unusual compliance sweep of 9,000 full-service restaurants between 2010 and 2012, they found that 84 percent had violated the subminimum wage system.

A century later, the industry lobby continues its fight to uphold this two-tiered pay system. Where social movements have gotten cities to pass minimum wage hikes, the lobby has pressured state legislatures to ban local wage increases altogether. The industry also fought to overturn voter-approved initiatives in Maine and Washington, D.C., that would have ended the subminimum tipped wage, while they lobbied legislators in Michigan to keep the issue from reaching the ballot in the first place."""

https://www.nkytribune.com/2019/04/keven-moore-old-wives-tale-is-it-really-dangerous-to-shower-or-talk-on-phone-during-a-thunderstorm/

“The NWS says it is indeed possible to be struck while showering because lightning can travel through your pipes electrifying your bathroom.

According to the show, MythBusters on the Discovery channel, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage took that weather alert to task and constructed a makeshift house, complete with grounded plumbing. Then, they doused it with simulated lightning in an electricity testing facility to find out whether the voltage really could leap from the sky to the shower.

Since the MythBusters were shy about showering on camera, they hired a stand-in: a ballistics gel dummy that had roughly the same electrical conductivity as the human body. To screen for a fatal lightning strike, the dummy wore a heart monitor. The 700,000 volts of fake lightning indeed arced onto the water pipes and jumped to the shower, causing a fire.

Although the heart monitor failed to measure the amount of current swimming through the stunt dummy, the visual evidence was clear enough to rule the myth plausible. Just as the National Weather Service warns, it’s safe to shower only once thunderstorms have passed you by.

In days of landline telephones, cast iron tubs and metal supply and drain lines, it was even that much truer back during my day.

According to an older 2006 New York Times article, Ron Holle, a former meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who tracks lightning injuries, estimates that 10 to 20 people in the United States are shocked annually while bathing, using faucets or handling appliances during storms.

For instance in July 2017, a 17-year-old working at a McDonalds in Alabama had a workers compensation claim when she was electrocuted as she was washing dishes when a storm started to roll through.”

On the plus side, the odds of dying are low:

“According to one article at www.independent.co.uk, the death rate of showering or doing the dishes is 0.013 deaths per 100 million people per thunderstorm which is rather low.”"

""Many people just don't wash their sheets often enough. A 2017 survey by Coyuchi, a home textile company, found that only 44 percent of the 1,000 Americans surveyed wash their sheets once or twice a month. Just 11 percent get around to it around once a season and 5 percent decrust their sheets only once or twice a year. A survey by Mattress Advisor found that out of the 1,000 people they surveyed, most on average waited around 25 days before cleaning or changing out their sheets.

So just how often should you wash your sheets? Well, it depends on the circumstances.  

The Good Housekeeping Institute says you should wash your sheets -- and other bedding -- at least once every two weeks. If you have night sweats, or just sweat a lot in general, bump washing up to once a week.  

If you're allergic to dust mites, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends washing your bedding at least once a week. You'll need to wash them in water that is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius) to kill the dust mites.
 
Now, if you're sick with something contagious, the rules change. Sheets and other bedding need to be changed as soon as you feel better to prevent contracting the illness again. The water will need to be between 140 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 65.5 Celsius) to kill the germs, so select the sanitize option on your washer. If your washer doesn't have a sanitize option, use the highest heat setting on your dryer.

**Don't forget pillows!**

A 2017 survey by Canstar Blue  found that 29 percent of Australians never wash their pillows. While you may think that the pillow case protects your pillow, it really doesn't do as much as you'd hope. Sweat, dust and skin cells still make it onto your pillow. Plus, washing can fluff them up and make them last longer, so giving them a spin in the washer is a win-win. 

You should be washing your fluffy friend at least every six months or so. Here are some instructions on washing your pillow."""

""All forms of sexual assault are considered criminal behavior under state and federal law. But how exactly sexual assault is defined varies by state.

Sexual assault is most often associated with rape, but it's actually an umbrella term used to describe a number of violent or threatening sex crimes, from rape to unwanted fondling and groping. This is the category under which many accusations against Weinstein fall under.

The US Justice Department, which can prosecute these cases, considers sexual assault ""any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.""

The US Code views unwanted physical touching and penetration to be criminal actions. But touching someone's genitals is a far more serious crime than touching other intimate parts of a person's body. So under federal law, sexual assault must involve some physical contact. Making sexualized comments, or even exposing oneself, is not considered sexual assault under federal law (though it can be considered sexual harassment if it happens at work).""

""Dr Jim Chandler, Consultant Cardiac Anaesthetist at Princess Elizabeth Hospital, Guernsey:

Firstly the short answer is yes, it is possible that being struck twice by lightning would firstly stop your heart and then restart your heart.  The answer is a bit more complicated than that though.  The heart cells maintain a voltage drop across them which controls the inflow and outflow of ions.  These ions allow the heart to beat.  If the heart’s struck by lightning that voltage drop is immediate and the heart will contract.  Unfortunately if the lightning strikes the heart at the wrong part of its relaxation the cells will not contract together, rather chaotically.  The heart will enter a rhythm called fibrillation.  This doesn’t allow it to pump.  For that reason the pulse would stop and the heart would be said to be arrested. 

If a second strike of lightning or an electric shock occurred at the same point when a heart was fibrillating it would be possible that the heart cells would all contract together in a more ordered fashion.  However, there is a problem.  The heart could also be struck by lightning and instead of going into this fibrillating chaotic rhythm it could go into no rhythm at all.  It could quite simply not beat again.  That’s called asystole.  It doesn’t end there unfortunately, our poor unfortunate victim also suffers elsewhere.  It’s likely that the chest would become relatively stiff and the chest muscles would go into spasm.  These muscles take a lot longer to recover than heart muscles so it would be very unlikely that your victim would be able to breathe again.  For that reason, although the heart may well restart the victim may well die."""

**""The Traditional Rule: Reasonable Force Okay**
A 2012 Georgia case illustrates the traditional rule that it’s sometimes okay to resist arrest with force. An officer had been investigating the firing of shots in or around an apartment building. Outside, he saw a young man wearing a hoodie heading for the building. The officer approached and expressed his desire to speak with the youth, who in turn muttered and kept right on his way. The officer quickened his approach; the youngster began to run toward the building. The young man ran up the stairs and eventually tripped. The officer pounced on and “arm-barred” him in order to apply handcuffs. The arrestee struggled to escape, “kicking his legs about and throwing his elbows back and forth.” 

Georgia’s Court of Appeals focused on that fact that the struggle between officer and suspect occurred after the attempted arrest. To the court, the arrest for supposed obstruction had no basis. Because that arrest was unlawful, the young man “was justified in resisting the attempted arrest with all force that was reasonably necessary to do so.” (Ewumi v. State, 315 Ga. App. 656 (2012).)

**Innocent—Until You Resisted**
It’s critical to note that one can be convicted of resisting arrest even without having committed the crime that was the basis for the arrest.

For example, in New York it’s a misdemeanor to intentionally prevent a police officer “from effecting an authorized arrest.” (N.Y. Penal Law § 205.30.) In that state, an arrest is “authorized” if the police have probable cause to believe that the suspect has broken the law, even if the suspect actually hasn’t. So, whether or not a suspect has broken the law, if the police had probable cause to arrest him and he resisted, he’s guilty of a crime. (People v. Laltoo, 801 N.Y.S.2d 591 (2005).) 

On the other hand, consider the New York case of young man who fled the police. An officer received word of a burglary in progress; he arrived on scene to notice the young man and two others near a parked car. The officer and his partner approached the men and asked them what was going on; the young man ran away. The cops eventually caught and arrested him. An appeals court noted that the officers didn’t have a description of the burglary suspects or even know where, exactly, the crime occurred. They didn’t even know whether the tip about the burglary was reliable. The defendant wasn’t doing anything other than standing on the street. The court found that the officers had no basis for chasing the young man, meaning he couldn’t be guilty of resisting arrest. (In re Manuel D., 796 N.Y.S.2d 345 (2005).)

A Florida court issued a similar ruling in the case of a juvenile who loudly (and with choice language) protested police actions at an apartment complex. The police commanded him to leave the complex, where a rowdy crowd had gathered. The charge was that he resisted arrest by refusing the command. The court held that the youngster was justified in nonviolently resisting because the police didn’t have probable cause to arrest him. (J.G.D. v. State, 724 So. 2d 711 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999).)"""

""What men and women request for their last meal reflects how they lived their lives and how they choose to face their deaths, and offers Americans a poignant human connection to the people they have decided should die for their crimes, scholars and legal analysts say.

And as a ritual, the last meal is intended not to comfort the condemned but to soften for society the harsh fact that a human is about to be killed with the law's full sanction, says Jon Sheldon, a Virginia death penalty lawyer.

He has sat with three condemned men in the hours before their executions, including infamous Washington sniper John Allen Muhammad.

""I don't know anybody who has eaten the last meal,"" Mr Sheldon says. 

""In my experience, it is unlikely that someone is going to be hungry and is going to want a meal. It's either not ordered, or it's ordered and it's not eaten.""

Florida, which has executed 69 convicts since 1976, budgets $40 (£26) per inmate, and the last meal must be purchased locally.

Take-away meals
Oklahoma - 176 men and three women executed since 1915 - is more miserly, giving prisoners only $15 to spend on a last meal, subject to the warden's approval. 

The meal has to be purchased from a restaurant within the town of McAlester, home to the death chamber, says Jerry Massie, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. 
""The staff doesn't prepare it,"" he said.

The last man executed there ordered a deep dish meat lover's pizza from Pizza Hut, and deep fried shrimp with cocktail sauce and hushpuppies - fried cornmeal balls - from fast food outlet Long John Silver's, Mr Massie says.

The man before him had a large pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza and a large Dr Pepper soda.

A review of last meal requests in Texas between 1982 and 2003 shows the most popular requests were grilled or fried foods like burgers, fried chicken or steaks.

This suggests the condemned had sought a last sensual reminder of home before they died, says Phoebe Ellsworth, a professor of law and psychology at the University of Michigan.

""Most of the offenders come from fairly poor backgrounds,"" says Prof Ellsworth, who has researched capital punishment extensively.
""It's a memory of something about life on the outside. 'When we went out to have a good time, what did we have?'""

A significant number of inmates forgo the last meal, whether in defiance of the ritual or for lack of appetite. Or for spiritual reasons: David Clark, executed in Texas in 1992 at age 32 for a double murder, told prison officials he wanted to fast.

""They have other things on their minds,"" Mr Sheldon says. ""Inmates have gotten tired of co-operating with these rituals of death.""

Alcohol is prohibited, and requests for cigarettes and bubble gum have been turned down.

'Christian connotation'
The ritual of the last meal captures the public imagination because the activity of sitting down for dinner is one Americans with no experience of prison life can relate to, says Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York and an expert on capital punishment law.

""It brings us back to the fact that this is a human being who will not be having any more dinners like we do,"" she says.
""There's a drama associated with it. This is the Last Supper. Maybe it has that Christian connotation.""

In Texas, the state that has executed the most people in the country since modern capital punishment resumed in 1976, with 475, State Senator John Whitmire says his push to end the last meal tradition was made of moral concerns, not financial ones.
And he vehemently disagrees with critics who say it is petty and mean-spirited to withhold from the condemned one last creature comfort.

""If you're fixing to execute someone under the laws of the state because of the hideous crime that someone has committed, I'm not looking to comfort him,"" he says.

""He didn't give his victim any comfort or a choice of last meal,"" he says of Brewer.

Rather than reform the last meal, Texas officials should worry about the justice, efficacy and constitutionality of capital punishment there, says Richard Dieter, executive director of research organisation Death Penalty Information Center. 

""They take it away, hopefully they're looking to what they should be providing. A last lawyer rather than a last meal is much more important."""""

""Back in February 2017, Donald Trump was asked what the government planned to do about an uptick in anti-Semitism, to which he characteristically responded, “I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.” That statement, like the ones he’s previously made about being “the least racist person there is anywhere in the world,” was, and is, obviously not true at all. Prior to being elected, Trump seemed to suggest to a room full of Jews that they buy off politicians; tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton’s face atop a pile of cash next to the Star of David and the phrase, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!”; and released an ad featuring the faces of powerful Jewish people with a voiceover about them being part of a “global power structure” that has “robbed our working class” and “stripped our country of its wealth.” After moving into the White House, and just a few short months following his assertion that he is the least anti-Semitic person to walk the earth, Trump refused to condemn neo-Nazis and, just last August, accused American Jews of being “disloyal” to Israel by voting for Democrats. And if you thought the coming holiday season would inspire the president to pump the brakes on blatant anti-Semitism, boy, do we have a surprise for you!

Speaking at the Israeli American Council in Hollywood, Florida, on Saturday night, Trump hit all of his favorite anti-Semitic tropes before a room full of Jewish people. He started off by once again invoking the age-old cliché about “dual loyalty,” saying there are Jews who “don’t love Israel enough.” After that warm-up he dove right into the stereotype about Jews and money, telling the group: “A lot of you are in the real estate business, because I know you very well. You’re brutal killers, not nice people at all,” he said. “But you have to vote for me—you have no choice. You’re not gonna vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that. You’re not gonna vote for the wealth tax. Yeah, let’s take 100% of your wealth away!” (It feels beside the point that neither Elizabeth Warren nor any other Democratic candidate has proposed a 100% wealth tax.) He continued: “Some of you don’t like me. Some of you I don’t like at all, actually. And you’re going to be my biggest supporters because you’re going to be out of business in about 15 minutes if they get it. So I don’t have to spend a lot of time on that.”

Not surprisingly, the remarks by the self-described “King of Israel” were swiftly condemned by Jewish organizations. “Dear @POTUS,” the American Jewish Committee tweeted Sunday afternoon, “Much as we appreciate your unwavering support for Israel, surely there must be a better way to appeal to American Jewish voters, as you just did in Florida, than by money references that feed age-old and ugly stereotypes. Let’s stay off that mine-infested road.” Calling the comments “deeply offensive” and “unconscionable,” the Jewish Democratic Council of America said in a statement, “We strongly denounce these vile and bigoted remarks in which the president—once again—used anti-Semitic stereotypes to characterize Jews as driven by money and insufficiently loyal to Israel. He even had the audacity to suggest that Jews ‘have no choice’ but to support him. American Jews do have a choice, and they’re not choosing President Trump or the Republican Party, which has been complicit in enacting his hateful agenda.” The group’s executive director added: “Jewish support for the GOP has been halved since Trump has been in office, from 33 percent in 2014 to 17 percent in 2018, because Trump’s policies and rhetoric are completely antithetical to Jewish values.”

Trump, on whose watch hate crimes have hit historic levels, has not seen fit to respond to any of the criticism yet, but presumably when he does it’ll be to note his appointment as “the second coming of God” and all of his many Jewish friends.""""

""On Saturday night, President Donald Trump served up a buffet of anti-Semitic tropes during his speech before the Israeli American Council advocacy group in Florida. He played on the dangerous anti-Semitic theme of Jews having dual loyalty to the United States and another country, when he said, ""They don't love Israel enough."" 

He then invoked the slur that Jews are hyper-focused on money, telling the crowd that to protect their money they will vote for him -- falsely claiming that 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's proposed ""wealth tax"" will take ""100% of your wealth away."" He added, ""You're not going to vote for the wealth tax... you're going to be my biggest supporters because you'll be out of business in about 15 minutes.""

And he went one step further, saying that Jewish people in the real estate business he knows ""very well, you're brutal killers. You're not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me.""

The condemnation of Trump's words was swift. Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg tweeted, ""It's not even coded antisemitism. It's not a dog whistle. He's saying this. Out loud. To a room full of Jews."" 
Journalist Emily Tamkin tweeted that Trump's view that, ""Jews won't vote for the candidate who wants a wealth tax because Jews are all about wealth"" is ""an old trope often used to justify violent discrimination.""

And Aaron Keyak, a former head of the National Jewish Democratic Council, called Trump's words ""dangerous,"" adding, ""Trump's insistence on using anti-Semitic tropes when addressing Jewish audiences is dangerous and should concern every member of the Jewish community -- even Jewish Republicans."" 

But where are the Republicans denouncing Trump's use of these anti-Semitic tropes? There's zero doubt that if Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the two Muslim women in Congress, had uttered anything even close to those comments, the Republican Party would've been up in arms. 

In fact, earlier this year, when Omar invoked an anti-Semitic trope -- saying American politicians support for Israel was fueled by money from the pro-Israel lobby -- she was met with a chorus of criticism by Republican, along with many Democrats. Omar later apologized for the comment. 

The GOP's silence thus far is even more concerning given the documented spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes we've seen over the past year. As the FBI recently reported, in 2018, Jews were the overwhelming target of religious-based hate crimes. This includes the horrific attack in October 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were killed by a man who blamed Jews for helping transport members of migrant caravans, who he dubbed ""invaders"" into the United States. 

It's true that Trump has trafficked in similar anti-Semitic stereotypes in the past -- but failing to call them out each and every time is how these dangerous tropes became mainstream. For example, during the 2016 campaign Trump was met with criticism when he told a group of Jewish Republicans that, ""You're not going to support me because I don't want your money.""

And more recently, in August, Trump sparked outrage when he said Jews who vote for Democrats shows ""either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."" Numerous Jewish leaders slammed Trump for invoking the anti-Semitic trope that Jews have ""dual loyalty."" As Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt stated at the time, ""Charges of disloyalty have long been used to attack Jews."" 

But despite the backlash in both instances, there was Trump playing on the exact same themes this weekend. While we can't know why Trump continues to traffic in this rhetoric, it's fair to say that he simply doesn't care if Jews object to his use of these dangerous stereotypes. 

Of course, Jews are not the only minority faith that Trump has targeted with his dangerous rhetoric. Trump made stoking hate of Muslims, my community, a visible part of his 2016 campaign -- from stating irresponsibly that ""Islam hates us"" to calling for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on Muslims entering the United States. And even as President, Trump continued inflaming tensions by sharing in November 2017 anti-Muslim videos made by a UK-based hate group with his millions of Twitter followers. 

The words of American Presidents can inspire the good, the bad and the ugly. That's why in the case of Trump, his inflammatory and irresponsible words about Jews -- as well as Muslims and other minorities -- must be challenged every time, making clear that we as a society will not allow them to become the new normal. 

And leading that charge should be members of Trump's own political party since they have the greatest potential to sway his base. Yet as of the writing of this article, there has been no full-throated condemnation by the Republican National Committee, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or other prominent Republicans in Congress. And the longer the GOP remains silent, the more they are enabling Trump's bigotry."""

""One, it’s a sign of hospitality. When you welcome people into your home or establishment to “break bread,” you’re showing them that they’re welcome.

Two, there’s a historical precedent. Tavern owners historically served one meal per day, at a set time and for a set price, so filling diners up on bread before the main course of meat, fish, or other more expensive foods helped keep expenses down.

Three, it’s a way to give diners something to do before their food arrives. When we sit down at a restaurant table we tend to be hungry, but it can take some time before the food arrives. Instead of letting customers sit around with nothing to eat, starving and watching other tables enjoy their food, giving them a little bread and butter to tide them over keeps them happy and prevents them from becoming impatient.

Four, it inspires subconscious reciprocity. If a generous and warm bread basket is placed on a table before the diner has a chance to order, he or she will subconsciously want to return the favor: “They were generous with their bread, so now I’ll be generous with them.” It puts customers in a generous frame of mind.

Five, bread actually makes you hungrier. Simple carbohydrates trigger insulin production, which makes you hungrier than you were before, and you most likely won’t feel any fullness from the bread until after you’re done ordering.

So there you have it: There are plenty of reasons for serving bread before a restaurant meal. Oh, and don’t assume that it’s free; the price of the bread is usually worked into the rest of the menu items."""
