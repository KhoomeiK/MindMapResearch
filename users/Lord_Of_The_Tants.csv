They were trying to change lane, didn't see me, moved over saw me and then returned to their lane, followed by an apologetic flash of the hazards. There was about one and a half cars space between us also they were out of towners, so not too major."

OnePunchMan,fck1f1e,t3_ehki8k,1577713625.0,"Hi Moony! 

First, the quality of the video was pretty good but it needs some work. Your balance between music and voice over was good, it didn't interfere with being able to hear you however your voice over needs to be louder as I was listening much louder than I normally do and was still struggling to hear you, at times   
 it felt like you need to speak a bit louder and perhaps more clearly. No complaints about the choice of music.

Having said that I do appreciate your tone of voice and the pace at which you spoke. This went hand in hand with your argument which was structured well but maybe when initially stating what the argument is you need to be a bit more clear in describing that (this may just be me, I did re-watch the first few minutes to make sure I understood how the later parts tied to it), a better use of text/title cards and basic web diagrams might be helpful in showing how each part relates to your argument.  

I'm not sure if I can fully verbalize my thoughts on your argument although I'd say I mostly agree with it, I guess the stakes in OPM tend to be low because Saitama is effectively a god and can intervene at times and also because most side/supporting characters journeys are related to him. Also as a matter of stakes, heroes don't die (in the OPM world) so their development isn't really hindered by obstacles they face in their own development which is what partly makes up the story seeing as Saitama's goal of being a hero is achieved. This isn't too coherent but I hope it makes sense when considering that at a macro level OPM seems to be about people finding their place in the world. And life being a journey in which one should find meaning in the process of reaching their goals and not so much about the destination/goals."
