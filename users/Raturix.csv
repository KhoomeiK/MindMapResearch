pics,fd3418g,t1_fd301ag,1578154553.0,"Ok, i agree with you about the most part of it. And also i'm sorry for the wrong information i give. But i just have one question. Why America should be the country to defend other countries from invasion ? 

The problem i have with the concept is that by placing military basis all around the world, by resolving conflicts (in a wrong or right way) around the world, Americans put themselves and their values as dominant in these areas. 

I'm not sure about that, but in the Vietnam and Iraq conflict, one of the main reasons for Americans to go into this conflict was to ""install democracy"", to destroy the enemies values that were against theirs. Communism in the case of Vietnam, dictatorship in the case of Iraq. I have a problem with that because, i don't know, it's not their business. 

This is all a reason of point of view.

Imagine if tomorrow, some kind of communist dictatorship starts to place military basis all around the world and solve conflicts in their way everywhere. It would be seen as imperialism, as an invasion, as a disrespect of the countries concerned. Why shouldn't be the same for America ?

Sorry for bad english."

Are there any iranian military basis on the usa ground? No, because Iran doesn't have the arrogance to put themselves as the defenders of their own values ​​around the world.

The american system really has to question itself or we're just gonna end in a global war were million of peoples are going to end like the guy on the photo. Americans, Iranians, Europeans, etc ... Is this really what you want ? Because as a European, that's not what i want."
