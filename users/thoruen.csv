relationship_advice,fedxtw8,t3_eoi396,1579022170.0,"Relationships are hard, they take work & very rarely do folks find the perfect partner, (I got lucky). 

You don't owe her anything, but you care for her & I'm guessing you still have good times together. 

The drinking is obviously a bigger problem then either of you thought. 

Ask yourself if you have at least the same or more good times than bad.

If it's more good than bad, don't make her promise to go to an AA meeting go with her to an open AA meeting. 

If she feels shame & embarrassed for what occured I say try to work it out, with professional help. If she says it's not that big of a deal & can't wait to hang out with your friends again, let her go. 

As far as the text messages you sent her, if she can't understand that you were hurt & angry when you sent them, then let her go.

If she doesn't understand that you will have issues with trusting her while she's drinking, let her go 

Keep in mind that the attempted cheating may have been a way for her to make you break up with her, because she feels like your too good of a person for her, because she can't get the help she needs to stop drinking. When I say can't get help, it's not that help isn't available, she might not see it as a possibility, or that it will actually help.

It always seems that all the advice on most of these type of questions is to break-up & leave right away at the smallest infraction.

I'm not sure where or who came up 21 as the age for these vices, but I do believe that we need to use something scientifically based. Currently scientists are saying that generally the data points to the age where the brain becomes ""adult"" is somewhere between 25-30 years old. They also stipulate that everyone is different.

AskLibertarians,fds8qyo,t1_fds5wuw,1578696925.0,"Except the people at Boeing that made the decisions that ultimately doomed those planes are going to be fine. The CEO was fired, but is walking away with an estimated $60 million golden parachute & will most likely be hired by another company with a high salary. If these people knew there was a real threat of losing their freedom instead of multi million dollar payouts, we'd see less fraud committed by white collar criminals.

I'm guessing that there are fewer & fewer CEOs focusing on the long term health of the companies they run over short term profits.  With the exceptions generally being family run businesses.

I blame this on the lack of business schools not putting more energy into teaching [business ethics.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/08/04/when-it-comes-to-ethics-b-schools-get-an-f/c92d6899-fd20-4451-8ca1-113708f5ef92/)

While I agree with you on not wanting a ""bureau of future crime"" jail time usually prevents someone from committing fraud while imprisoned, & that time can also be used to actually rehabilitate the conman.

I also don't think you're taking into account the emotional damage a conman can inflict on a victim. My doctor who commits fraud may cause his victims to never trust another doctor, and suffer health problems because of it. what kind of damage would it do if a company that made vaccines were caught in some kind of fraud? How many new cases of polio would we see because of some stupid shit like that?

I'm hoping that you at least agree that if a fraudster's lies lead to someone's dealth a simple payoff no matter the amount, might not seem like justice to the deceased person's family & prison time should be given to those that have caused a loss of life."
AskLibertarians,fdqo2ap,t1_fdpxsw6,1578671179.0,"The point of jailing a conman is that society won't be conned again by the same person, the defrauded consumer gets to know that the person that ripped them off is behind bars & can't do it again.
