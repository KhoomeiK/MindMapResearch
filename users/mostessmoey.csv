realhousewives,ffbs3l7,t1_ffb8uta,1579780607.0,Especially after the conversation last night.  Melissa and Dolores were right she just never listened to him.

realhousewives,ff9hnh9,t3_esewbb,1579713219.0,"It's so dumb. All these housewives acting like they are not homophobes but the favorite way to insult another housewife is to say she or her husband had a same sex affair. Wtf, like in my real life I've known of a couple of people who've had affairs but never same sex affairs yet somehow every housewife show has it?"

belowdeck,ff8u4cp,t1_ff8skk5,1579696149.0,"You don't think that his constant harassment and belittlement of his female coworkers sets the tone for more harassment and belittlement to occur? He does it sober, at least the other men had to be drunk to do it earlier in the season."
belowdeck,ff8sa1q,t1_ff8kvim,1579694115.0,"Before the season got really nasty Kevin was toxic while sober. Freaking out at Simone, saying Kate can't do her job because she was in the bathroom, said Courtney should be chief stew because mommy and daddy paid for her to have a decent palate. He did all kinds of awful things while sober and created the environment for things to escalate and flourish. Ashton was definitely the worst but the awful behavior from Kevin was constant from the start. Even the first fight with Rylee why can't someone ask for good low Cal options without him freaking out?"
BravoRealHousewives,ff86pn7,t1_ff8656x,1579667541.0,"I think he just flew under the radar because the other stuff is so big and serious. But he has been a constant toxic dividing negative presence both drunk and sober. I think his constant behavior made the others feel like it was acceptable and then they all fed off each other.


Adding at least earlier in the season the brus had to be drinking for them to act that way. Kevin just acts that way all the time."
BravoRealHousewives,ff851j4,t1_ff7z0gf,1579666185.0,"I think the toxicity began with Kevin. I think there is always a level of boh vs foh. There is often a level of misogyny among bros. Kevin was over the top with his behavior from the onset and he was left unchecked then his behavior spread and got worse with the frat boys. Remember him not allowing wine in the fridge, screaming at Simone, freaking out that Kate was changing or was she in the bathroom (can't remember), saying that Courtney should be chief stew because mommy and daddy paid for her to have a decent palate those are just the things I remember from before everything got extra nasty. But I really do think Kevin is where all this behavior spread from."
belowdeck,ff829y5,t1_ff6sh8b,1579664101.0,"Kate works front of the house hospitality. Many men seem to think they own their waitress, bartender, or hostess. Kate definitely has had to put up with shit from entitled males in the past."
belowdeck,ff81ozj,t1_ff6mnyo,1579663673.0,"I felt from the beginning of the season that toxicity radiated from Kevin and it spread to the rest of the men who ran with it. Earlier in the season his, you can't store wine for the guests in MY refrigerator was similar to the I say you can't clean early of last night. Just obnoxious men making power plays to make their female coworkers work harder. The deck trolls definitely took his energy and multiplied it but I think it originated with Kevin."

belowdeck,ff3z93d,t1_ff395t7,1579552100.0,I don't think he was trying to get her fired on the spot. I think he was trying to create a history of poor performance so he could use all of things he'd brought to the captain to fire her. I think it was reasonable for Kate to give her a heads up so if future things came up Rylee could address them with Captain Lee or at least be aware that she was being thrown under the bus and be able to prove she was doing her job.
Southerncharm,ff3yr1f,t1_ff3xhzv,1579551784.0,"I think she really is just not that nice of a person. Yes, she was treated horribly by Thomas and that forced some of her awfulness to show. But, she chose him in the first place. Chose to have another child with him. She treats her only true friend on the show poorly and in general is not very considerate of others. But she gets a pass because Thomas is a huge asshole who still treats her poorly and provides her with an excuse to treat others poorly."

Divorce,fez06xg,t1_feywv74,1579452643.0,I didn't say you never want kids. You said you're breaking up because he wants kids and you're not ready. Somewhere in these comments you say you've known him 16 years. It's my opinion that if you cant overcome whatever issue you have on hand right now with your partner and friend of two decades then you never will. I also believe that you will be sad and resentful once he moves on and has a family because all of that could/should have been yours. Good luck being someone's friend and stifling all of that.

Divorce,feylw8d,t1_feyiptc,1579447355.0,You'll be friends for a little while and then move on. I can't imagine his future family will have his ex wife hanging around. That's the reason for the split he wants kids and you don't. Often times when people have kids they naturally drift away from their childless friends. It's a huge life change that is easiest to understand when you've been through it.

An easy example would be division, you can set it up as a fractional representation and simplify before dividing or you could use long division. There is also lots of need to discuss math as standardized tests require answers to be justified.
