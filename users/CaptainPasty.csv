RedDwarf,ffajlid,t1_ffadcax,1579737348.0,Danny was also in cult murder mystery drama Death in Paradise.
curlyhair,ff9qyof,t1_ff909kk,1579719095.0,That's very helpful thanks. I don't think everything on the list is available where I come from but there's enough. I went for some Shea Moisture products if you're interested.
RedDwarf,ff9pifl,t3_esevzo,1579718041.0,"Two comedy geniuses there. Rik Mayall, gone too soon and sadly missed."
Boxing,ff9p9cp,t1_ff97br7,1579717856.0,"Not excuses but facts. Listen to what I'm saying - I never said Fury was hurt, I said he had a bad cut early on so decided to change tactics and fight more aggressively in an attempt to stop Wallin because he was worried the cut could force the ref to stop the fight. It wasn't a good performance sure but he was forced to fight in a way that played into Wallins hands and tbh he still won virtually every round."
Boxing,ff8zg2g,t1_ff8t8yb,1579700889.0,"Different fight, different mindset. Tyson got a bad cut early against Wallin so was forced to fight more aggressively, take a few more risks and therefore took a few more shots. Also Wallin is a bit better then Schwarz."
retrogaming,ff8tpl7,t1_ff7rsqi,1579695727.0,"No it was about a Megadrive game called Soleil. All I said in my post was that it was a hidden gem and very underrated. Then, instead of getting responses about the actual game the only responses I get are some idiots/trolls arguing that it can't be underrated because the cart is worth £500. WTF! Firstly, it's not worth £500 (although it is rare) and secondly what has it's monetary value got to do with it being underrated? Sorry for the rant lol, I just find Reddit frustrating sometimes."
Everton,ff7mb5n,t1_ff7di5x,1579652959.0,"I want Davies to succeed as do most fans - he's a true blue and seems a nice kid. Unfortunately I think most fans have also come to the conclusion that he isn't quite good enough. He's young but other young players like Holgate and DCL have shown improvement, Davies hasn't."
retrogaming,ff7d37g,t3_erz4j3,1579646760.0,"I once tried to start a serious discussion about a retro game that I liked and all I got were a couple of childish, snarky comments. Go figure."
Everton,ff77vot,t1_ff76aqs,1579642853.0,Everton that.
DeadSpace,ff6jkc3,t1_ff6depx,1579628569.0,Control intriges me. Is it a horror game then?
DeadSpace,ff6jfd3,t1_ff6aoxn,1579628487.0,"I don't think it's terrible, just overrated by certain fans. Maybe playing it recently I can see it more objectively without the rose tinted glasses."
DeadSpace,ff647gt,t1_ff612at,1579618711.0,"I played RE4 recently, tbh I found it a bit frustrating to play and overrated given how much people rave about it (but that's for a different thread I guess). I can see how the over the shoulder camera influenced DS though but the gameplay is more clunky and not as fluid as DS. It also obviously has a different setting and atmosphere."
Everton,ff5uncn,t3_erspy4,1579610843.0,"As much as I'm excited about the new ground my god I'll miss this place. I may even cry a little at the last match. 

The media may like to jerk off over Anfield or St James Park but when Goodison is in bear pit mode ther's nowhere better."
Everton,ff5ucw1,t3_erspy4,1579610552.0,❤️
gaming,ff5t7rm,t1_ff50clr,1579609349.0,"I think it was just a bit overwritten and longwinded. I don't think you deserved all those downvotes though, people are annoyed by strange things on Reddit."
retrogaming,ff5swck,t1_ff4io78,1579608996.0,"OK, you said you liked racing and action games so I'll narrow it down to those genres to make it quicker and easier.

Racing - Road Rash 1&2, Micro Machines 1&2, Ayrton Sennas Super Monico GP, Super Hang On, F1, Virtua Racing.

Action - Sonic 1&2, Streets of Rage 1&2, Flashback, Desert Strike/Jungle Strike, Strider, Ecco the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Revenge of Shinobi, Castlevania Bloodlines, Comix Zone, Street Fighter 2, James Pond 2, Quackshot. 

This is just my opinion based on the best of what I've played in 2 genres you mentioned. The Megadrive especially had a lot of great sports, rpgs and shoot em ups too and a large amount of hidden/underrated gems if you're willing to seek them out."
gaming,ff4m8ui,t3_erfkuf,1579567021.0,"This woman is ignorant and patronising on so many levels. I don't know about any other guys but I buy a game because it has good gameplay, plot an immersive game world ect not because it appeals to the male fantasy."
gaming,ff4ifp0,t1_ff49vfq,1579564378.0,"It took him hours to come up with all of that as well, bless him."
gaming,ff4gqme,t1_ff4dr7h,1579563212.0,"I don't think it's just gamers as such, it's more nerds and any nerdy community in general. For example go to a sub about any sci-fi show and start slagging it off and see if you get out alive. Nerds are vicious man."
retrogaming,ff4fcg4,t1_ff4avvt,1579562264.0,Well PS1 was a cool console as well. If you want some game recommendations for the MD I'd be happy to advise.
retrogaming,ff4ef8t,t1_ff4az7b,1579561647.0,You might be biased but ther's no disputing how great the 16-Bit era was. I feel lucky to have grown up at that time.
retrogaming,ff3whhm,t3_er9db2,1579550364.0,So is this your first experience with the Megadrive? If so you're in for a treat! It's one of the best consoles ever with a HUGE back catalogue of amazing games.
retrogaming,ff0mx53,t3_eqvwln,1579470381.0,I remember playing this with my friend and we were both laughing non stop at the humour and having so much fun. I actually think it's one of the greatest 2 player/multiplayer games on the Megadrive if not ever.
ResidentEvil7,ff0lmoi,t1_fdvlszz,1579470042.0,This. One won't make a huge difference but they're definitely useful so collect as many as you can.
residentevil,ff0k217,t1_ff0fxtv,1579469580.0,You forgot fresh underwear.
Megadrive,ff0j7a4,t3_eqzzxl,1579469390.0,The Streets of Rage one was pretty epic with the guy doing a flying kick in a thugs face and the city literally going up in flames behind him. Flashback also caught my eye because it was a bit mysterious and surreal compared to other box arts at the time.
retrogaming,fezqvkd,t1_fezcomn,1579460507.0,"I can't remember exactly tbh, it was obviously a long time ago that I played it. I think it was because the game world was open and (being a kid with a short attention span) I sort of lost track of what the main objective was because I was having too much fun just messing about and exploring. Either that or I found it too difficult to bother beating it properly. Like I said it's a game where it doesn't feel imperative that you need to beat it because ther's so much to see and do."
retrogaming,fez5lbd,t1_feyzj4o,1579454006.0,"Me neither. After playing for a while it always felt like I was going round in circles. Great fun though, especially in 2 player."
Boxing,fexxgak,t3_eqqs6o,1579437905.0,"""Tysons wank lotion"". How does he say these things with a straight face?"
DeadSpace,fexuok0,t3_eqn4ww,1579436591.0,The Stalkers were the most memorable thing about DS2 for me. Just watching this video has me on edge.
Boxing,fexttgv,t1_feviw0y,1579436086.0,"He hasn't got a glass chin sure but ther's a difference between a good chin and an iron chin. He's been wobbled several times in his carreer (including a couple of times against the supposedly ""pillow fisted"" Fury) my idea of an iron chin is someone like Oliver MCcall who was NEVER wobbled/staggered or Hagler. With Wilder you always feel he can be hurt (even though he's got the heart to come through it) but you never feel that way with guys like MCcall and Hagler."
Boxing,fevfc63,t1_feu3ym7,1579396749.0,Wilders got heart but I'm not sure he's got an iron chin.
retrogaming,feslwce,t1_ferqyrd,1579366609.0,Amazing what they did with Mastersystem Sonic when you consider the consoles limitations.
thewalkingdead,fesidvr,t3_eqh9uf,1579365485.0,I just think Negan was overwritten and overacted in these seasons. He wasn't believable or scary. He's a much better character now.
Everton,feseote,t1_fesdz7e,1579364423.0,I really want him to score the winner. He needs to step up today without Richarlison.
gaming,fese2rl,t1_fermlh1,1579364236.0,What did I just see?
gaming,fesdt8c,t1_fes49ql,1579364150.0,I'm out of orange juice.
DeadSpace,feocbuv,t3_epz88w,1579298167.0,"I agree, I'm convinced a new DS would sell well. I know EA blamed poor sales for not giving us another sequel but they can also blame themselves - DS3  isolated hardcore fans by going to far from its horror roots and simply wasn't as good as the first two. The thing is horror games are enjoying a renaissance these last few years (a renaissance ironically partly due to DS). I don't think survival horror is the niche genre was when DS first came out and DS still has a strong following, if DS4 was done properly it would do well."
Anxiety,fehazbx,t3_ep2lcn,1579112829.0,"For a lot of people college is the first time they've really been away on their own, it can be scary and tough and not just for those with anxiety. However it can also be the best years of your life! Embrace college life, have fun but remember to work hard too."
sports,fehah9t,t3_ep3b6t,1579112533.0,That's some real straight talking there. The looks on the players faces says it all.
thewalkingdead,feh3fyb,t1_fef3f7r,1579108347.0,"Me too, I miss both the character of Rick and also the performance of Andy. Don't get me wrong, the show is still strong after Rick but it just doesn't feel the same."
Megadrive,fe5te5v,t1_fdetddm,1578874525.0,I thought Thunder Force IV was very hard too. Great music though!
Megadrive,fe5t57z,t1_fe5o88j,1578874371.0,"Ther's probably more games you'd like them that, you're just not aware of them. As someone else said the Mega CD had a lot of hidden gems. It also had (arguably) improved versions of some Megadrive classics such as Earthworm Jim and Ecco."
Megadrive,fe2neny,t1_fe0qmsm,1578840903.0,It no Street Fighter 2 but I remember it getting solid reviews at the time.
PS4,fdrnolz,t3_emu478,1578687100.0,Uncharted 2 > Uncharted 4. Also surprised ther's no Fallout games and surely Portal 2 deserves to be there?
Everton,fdrmfgc,t1_fdqkfm8,1578686577.0,I wish him well. He wasn't good enough but he had a good attitude unlike some of the current squad.
DeadSpace,fdrjai5,t1_fdoecht,1578685249.0,Music in DS is very much used to create atmosphere though and very good it is too.
thewalkingdead,fdox5mw,t1_fdnq1vv,1578614901.0,"This. I'm not sure where people get the idea Michonne beat the Governors ass. He was clearly getting the better of that confrontation until she grabbed the glass out of desparation. I don't think anyone beats him one on one, not even Jesus or Abraham."
DeadSpace,fdovm6e,t1_fdo6r5x,1578613891.0,It's still to this day the best use of sound and music to create atmosphere and tension that I've seen.
dinosaurjr,fdoeaxe,t1_fdlpkkj,1578603529.0,"Amazing, never seen that before. J would certainly be a perfect choice if Nirvana reformed."
offmychest,fdodyr1,t1_fdmywr4,1578603368.0,"I agree with a lot of that but try to understand that being seen as a ""creep"" is, for a lot of guys, one of the worst things they can be called (and remember mud sticks). It's not being ""slightly inconvenienced"" as you put it, where I come from being a creep is utterly unacceptable and you're seen as a social outcast. Also, if a guy is thinking about his actions and the consequences does that not mean his head is in the right place? This isn't comparing it to what women go through and I wouldn't even pretend to understand what that harassment is like but again the guys who are worried about approaching are at least trying to see things from a womans point of view."
offmychest,fdoaigg,t1_fdm4vhe,1578601701.0,I think ther's probably a lot more guys like you then you realise. Ther's more guys who have anxiety even talking to girls then there are cocksure guys who brazenly approach/flirt with girls.
offmychest,fdo99ul,t1_fdlisay,1578601101.0,"Exactly, I actually got downvoted for saying how much I hate it when people make generalisations about either sex. Not all guys are creeps, in fact the creeps are in the minority. Not all girls are men hating feminists."
offmychest,fdo81mu,t1_fdljec5,1578600501.0,"It does and not only that, some girls need to stop thinking that every guy they make eye contact with is going to be a creep or is going to be into them."
dinosaurjr,fdlo2h5,t3_elzsjn,1578528423.0,I read somewhere that Kurt once asked J to join Nirvana but J turned the offer down.
offmychest,fdlnf3k,t1_fdllew5,1578527983.0,Very well said! I hate this gender stereotyping or generalisations that imply all men (or women) are the same.
Everton,fdjmh6z,t3_elpts2,1578478005.0,"The arrogance and delusion that they can't even accept criticism after one of the most embarrassing, gutless performances in living memory. It's a shame they didn't show some of that defiance on the pitch."
Dracula,fdihn88,t3_el68xf,1578443126.0,"It changed too much, not just the jarring sudden change of setting and time but the whole tone. It was like a completely different show, turning into a cheesy fish out of water comedy with unfunny jokes about Dracula in the modern world. I was actually cringing through most of the episode and the the ending was the final nail in the coffin (sorry!)."
Everton,fdhsvsa,t1_fdg8os0,1578429541.0,Too many players that have neither the ability or mentality to play for Everton. Schneiderlin is far from the only one.
Everton,fdhsjod,t3_el06t3,1578429352.0,"Carlo's not stupid, he knew the tough job he had on his hands but the Derby performance hammers home just how much work he's got to do. There isn't one area of the pitch which we couldn't improve (with the possible exception of the full backs), ther's so much dead wood to get rid of and the whole mentally needs changing."
rem,fdesw5l,t3_ekzv4g,1578345915.0,"It's not great all the way through but when it's good it's superb. I mean Half a World Away and Country Feedback are up there with the most hauntingly beautiful songs REM have written (and that's saying something) and of course Losing My Religion is iconic. Shiny Happy People and Near Wild Heaven aren't everyones cup of tea but take them for what they are and I think they're decent pop songs with great hooks, not something REM we're known for."
ResidentEvil7,fdekywj,t3_ekxip1,1578341238.0,RE7 simultaneously reinvented the series while taking it back to its horror roots. For me it was everything the series needed after becoming a bit stale. Apart from anything else it's simply a fantastic horror game and with the VR it's on another level.
Everton,fdat7f4,t1_fdaiihl,1578249810.0,Just when I thought I couldn't be any more wound up. Stupid bot.
Everton,fdar89g,t1_fdaq3p6,1578249192.0,"I don't want to hear a rallying cry or even an apology. I've had it with that shit, especially after this performance."
Everton,fdaqxe4,t3_ekgsyl,1578249092.0,That was an absolute discrace. I don't know about sueing but I think the players could refund the fans who went. It was that bad.
Everton,fdag83r,t1_fdafneq,1578245693.0,"Me to. Gutless, useless bastards!"
Everton,fdaai65,t1_fda8iye,1578243701.0,Only against Liverpool could we do this. I'm fully prepared for them to get a flukey last minute winner or dodgy penalty.
Everton,fda9vg5,t1_fda90by,1578243433.0,Looks like we're trying to find yet another ridiculous way to lose a derby.
socialskills,fd9zzpu,t3_ek8yg1,1578240091.0,"I had a ""friend"" at work who would always put me down especially when it came to my chances with the opposite sex. For example, if we were out on the town he'd say things like ""you've got no chance with that girl"" or if I was getting on well with a girl in the office he would try to make me feel like I was doing something wrong by saying things like ""Turning on the charm are you, I know your type.""

I eventually realised this guy was just threatened and jealous of me and stopped hanging out with him."
Everton,fd9xcbl,t1_fd9s9p1,1578239089.0,"Either way, if we win we can say we stopped them winning the double."
Megadrive,fd98xhn,t3_ei2m88,1578230150.0,"Sonic, Bloodlines and Comix Zone weren't that hard (at least for me). 

Atomic Runner, ESWAT, Budukan even Streets of Rage 3 were harder then most of the games on this list."
Megadrive,fd8sdud,t3_ek39zc,1578222759.0,OK can someone explain why everyone is getting down voted?
Everton,fd8roth,t1_fd3bujn,1578222442.0,"Attitude is everything. The number of derbies we've chocked, or just rolled over in recent years makes me sick. Liverpool haven't even had to play well in a lot of them. Call me naive but I'm expecting more under Carlo."
Astrobot,fd8qkej,t3_eio7zv,1578221913.0,The piano should make a noise when you press the keys down. Sounds like ther's something wrong with the sound on your VR or TV.
Astrobot,fd8q7nm,t3_ei2wow,1578221738.0,I think they're in a couple of levels early on.
Megadrive,fd63s96,t3_ek39zc,1578185136.0,B
Boxing,fd4pf0j,t1_fd3wrjz,1578169747.0,Ward's the only one on his level. They're clearly the best two (in that division) and I would find it hard to pick a winner. If I had to pick id say the handspeed and workrate of Calzaghe would be the difference.
retrogaming,fd2p0bg,t3_ejvldl,1578150308.0,"Lots of great games on the PS1. To start with the obvious - Metal Gear Solid and the original Resident Evil trilogy are all time classics that every serious gamer should play at least once.

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is fantastic, as is Parasite Eve 2. The latter being an original mix of survival horror and RPG and I've not played anything quite like it before or since. The Spyro and Crash Bandicoot games are fun platformers but perhaps a bit dated now. The Oddworld games are great platform puzzle games."
DeadSpace,fd2mwgk,t3_ejlk3t,1578149495.0,It's still scary and creepy after all this time too!
Boxing,fd2mi63,t1_fd232b9,1578149333.0,I think they're both love/hate personalities but ther's definitely a lot of Wilder fan boys here trust me.
Boxing,fd2l23y,t1_fd2d0kj,1578148746.0,Which is why he may need to really put it on Wilder and stop him.
Boxing,fd2kuig,t1_fd12el8,1578148668.0,Fury is full of surprises and I've got a feeling he's going do something spectacular and stop Wilder.
Everton,fd25eke,t1_fcu2s5u,1578141950.0,"Same. These days I go into the Derby with a ""nothing to lose"" mentally. It saves a lot of stress in the days and hours beforehand and it would make a victory all the sweeter."
Trine,fd24fau,t1_fd0kdim,1578141513.0,I've played Jonathan Blows other game The Witness. It's the only puzzle game to beat me.
SquaredCircle,fcz8j5x,t3_ejiqt4,1578095829.0,"So cool, he's like a Japanese Darryl from The Walking Dead"
Boxing,fcz7o7v,t1_fcyq2yq,1578095331.0,Reddit is just weird sometimes.
Megadrive,fcyw0w7,t1_fchkzv7,1578088311.0,It really was. I played it recently on the PS4 re-release and it's still plays well today.
horror,fcyvh7f,t1_fcyobtp,1578087965.0,I hated Sherlock so didn't have high hopes for this but it's actually pretty good and (thankfully) nothing like Sherlock!
Everton,fcyurcy,t3_ejihpo,1578087518.0,Danny Cadamarteri. I remember there being some hype about him then he broke into the first team and scored that goal against the shite. It was downhill after that.
Everton,fcyua1x,t3_ejjur4,1578087218.0,"Don't want second rate, ex red shites at our club thank you."
Boxing,fcyu1e6,t1_fcy0qrc,1578087071.0,Calzaghe clearly won but he gave Calzaghe a tough night (by Calzaghes own admission). To be fair though Calzaghe was on a different level to just about any Super Middle Weight.
Trine,fcvu8l7,t3_eg3z8p,1578010225.0,That's not a lot of money for 4 games. If you like this type of game it's absolutely worth that price.
DeadSpace,fcvt952,t1_fctpmdp,1578009586.0,Dead Space in first person could also be a VR experience. Just imagine that!
recipes,fcuyvt5,t1_fcuupya,1577991268.0,"Oh ok, I guess it would change the consistency as well. As long as it tastes good, that's the main thing I guess."
food,fcsshvw,t3_eikiu4,1577923989.0,Eggs Benedict is all about the hollandaise and that looks like a good sauce!
recipes,fcsrw4x,t3_eimmru,1577923547.0,Probably a silly question but why does it need tahini? The hummus already has tahini in it.
DeadSpace,fcslovo,t1_fcrfrzk,1577919180.0,"I agree. Capcom showed that it's possible to remake a classic game, successfully putting a modern spin on them without losing the spirit of the originals. The only problem is EA aren't Capcom."
metricband,fcs6k4s,t1_fcrbx1k,1577912142.0,I actually like it better then the studio version. The middle eight section is especially powerful.
PS4,fcqqsdj,t1_fcq6ecc,1577890728.0,I disagree and besides white pudding doesn't really belong on an English breakfast.
PS4,fcoveb2,t1_fcntuxk,1577842623.0,Black puddings the best bit!
