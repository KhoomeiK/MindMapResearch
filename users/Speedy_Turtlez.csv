Awwducational,ff4dje7,t1_fepydlb,1579561060.0,"Female calicos are nothing close to having Downâ€™s syndrome. Downâ€™s syndrome is where an individual has an additional chromosome 21, whereas an x activation pattern is simply patches of cells with dna from either mom or dad. Additionally, we do actually have an idea of what the Y chromosome does. This is evident in individuals with monosomy x, where the Y chromosome is missing, can still be functioning members of society. However, in monosomy Y, where only the Y chromosome remains, the fetus does not survive at all."

Awwducational,fefn3u8,t1_fef335n,1579059925.0,"Not exactly, as they have more or less the same genetics as any other cat. Calicos just have a unique x chromosome inactivation pattern which gives them the unique spotty color patches of fur. In male calicos, this just means that something went wrong in the chromosome replication where an extra x or Y chromosome tagged along resulting in a male calico. The Y chromosome doesnâ€™t actually many crucial developmental genes, just those for male development."
