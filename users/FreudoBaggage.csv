I don't have any problems telling another person that I see things differently. I don't have any problems believing that my experience of Christianity doesn't mean you have to have the same experience. 

My experience, as a progressive Christian, however, often involves being told that I am not a *true* Christian (by more traditional Christians) because I don't believe this, that, or the other thing.
