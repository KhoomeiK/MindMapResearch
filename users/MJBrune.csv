Edit: Not saying ""throw away your dreams they are too hard"" I am saying don't just wake up and quit one day and self-proclaiming to be an indie game developer without having a solid design doc and a good demo.

If studios were serious about crunch compensation they'd give double time or even time and a half payments on crunch. Most people in studios see that as ""Why would we do that, then we'd be in the same place as before"" because crunch is a way to get a head of your budget.

As a developer myself I can fully get behind someone not paying me money because I won't release for their platform or officially support it. Don't buy anything that doesn't officially support linux.

Even in Rust's case it can be shaky. Rust officially supported Linux but just decided that they didn't want to anymore and fully pulled Linux support, offering full refunds which is better but still not a great move.

The end of the day things like Wine and Proton are supposed help you switch over from Windows and give you a backlog of games that -might- work while you focus on buying new games with Linux support. In my opinion I wouldn't buy a game unless it had a good track record of native support or I wasn't going to be upset if the developer just walked away with the money."

Basically you are exploring, stealth-ing and strategically taking out guards to get to your objective. You basically get a large complex and you need to go find a hardpoint like a terminal or server to attempt to hack into. From there you will be hacking while trying to either avoid guards/workers walking around the servers to do their jobs, check up on them or perhaps noticing issues with the servers running slow so that there is a more direct reason for a worker to check out a server.

I also figure I could do something like the more terminals you hack the more brute force hacking power you have against a server within the same network. These are air-gapped networks so hacking a bunch of terminals in one level doesn't directly transfer to the next. This allows for a bit of a core loop."
