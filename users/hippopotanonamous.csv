massage,fekesv1,t1_fekceh1,1579198544.0,"It took me about 4-6 years. Mostly because I had a slow start, and I was told to not be myself. I was doing 5 6hour shifts previously. I was also working a few days a week at a satellite office that is very difficult to keep regular clients coming. I changed things, and picked up 3 days at the bigger office that has steady regular clients, instead of 2 days. (Convinced my boss to be open Sundays, when previously it wasn't an option) And expanded from my 6 hour shift to 7.5. Then this year I fully left the satellite office.

And once I realized I could be myself, and wasn't a massage robot, clients started coming back more. Because I was able to connect and form relationships with them. 

(I'm an employee at a small business massage clinic, and my boss had convinced me that my personality turned people off to me. I started here at 19, fresh from school)

xxfitness,fegjfoo,t3_ep0nu9,1579094618.0,"I did gymnastics/power tumbling from 4-18 with a gap around 9 where I gained just enough body fat to start puberty lol. Was always called ""skinny minnie"" and ate literally everything in sight. My coaches didn't do the weigh-in stuff you hear about, because they always wanted us to be healthy instead of hitting big trucks. I was incredibly fortunate in that regard. Once, at 13, my mom pointed out the very small pooch I have on my lower stomach. No clue what I weighed at the time. But I was doing gymnastics and marching band, so pretty active and like a size 4 at 5'1"" ish.

I retired after 18, because I was leaving the area for trade school and wasn't able to continue. And I gained enough body fat again, to go from a C cup to DD within 6 months I think. I wasn't eating nearly as much, but I was very inactive for about 3 years before I started trying to lose weight.

At 19 I finished school and got a job in that career field (massage therapy), and barely made enough to pay rent/bills, so I didn't eat much. I did try to count calories, but I just couldn't do it perfectly, and gave up.

 Until I got a second job at 21 as a hostess, where I got half off food after my shift. That's when I started gaining the most. Once my massage pay was more sustainable, and I could eat without the hostess checks, I left.

Even though I took a ""foods and nutrition"" class in high school, I still didn't know how to eat properly, do portion control, or cook much. And once I had money to eat, I'd just eat. My boyfriend (still together) didn't help. Turns out we both have a slight feeder kink? He'd take me out and buy food a lot. Liked me thicc lol.

I joined a fitness group at 25. Thinking being active would help me. I was about 150 at this point. Instead I gained 20 pounds. Didn't count calories, tried to do IIFYM (but couldn't hit my macros ever), hated diet culture, fatphobia, that whole schtick. At 170, obese for my 5'2"" frame, both of us were like ""that's gross"". I quit that group, and started working out at the group fitness classes at Planet Fitness.

27, is when I started actively trying to diet. But not diet. Lifestyle change. I was no longer eating until I was so full it hurt. Eating back the calories I just exerted. 

I just got back to my pre-fat acceptance weight, which is still overweight, but not obese. Found the Strong Curves program, and been tracking my body measurements more than my weight. 

I watched my mom struggle while growing up. And both my parents recently lost like 30 pounds together. But they've stopped logging in on MFP, so I don't think it's sustainable for them yet.

Currently, I'm trying to not think of it as dieting. When I think of it that way I stress about it and get frustrated when I'm not seeing the changes I think I should be seeing on the scale. I'm losing weight, yes. Super slowly, because I'm changing my habits long term. I aim to eat until 75% full, not bursting and it hurts to move after eating. It's ok to feel a little hungry, but always drink water just in case I'm actually thirsty not hungry. Eat more veggies/fruit over potatoes. But still eat potatoes, just less. Cook your own damn food!

Anyway, I'm rambling. TL;DR: I think it was around 20 that I started dieting? But more like 21 ish, but not seriously. 27 for sure."

If it's more towards the groin, it sounds to me like pectineus. It's a hip flexor and an adductor. So it gets used a lot in Strong Curves. Look for a massage therapist, or PT/Physio that could help release it. *Not medical advice. Definitely seek a local professional opinion!"

Rub butts. Talk when they initiate conversation. Ask questions to check in. Like another commenter said, I massage like I want to be massaged if I was feeling something similar. I deal mostly in pain management, not Swedish. Have fun, don't take it personally when someone doesn't like you.

When I'm done, I try to leave my work at work. I don't do much massage outside of my hours. Unless I'm making something from it, dinner or money or whatever. I'll read relevant articles, or read up on things that might be useful. (Recently read about Glute max, and it's massive role in low back pain. Truly wonderful material.) 

I started this at 19, and a few people were weirded out at being massaged by someone so young.

What I don't like: people being rude. Undressing in front of me (I don't actually want to see you naked). Asking me if we can make this more erotic. Saying ""that spot you hit over there (10 minutes ago in a different part of the body) is exactly where my pain is."" 

Not researching the Therapist or clinic they're going to, example! We do Neuromuscular where I work, no it's not a type of Deep Tissue, it's trying to find the source of your muscular pain and working with that. I slowly work through the layers and don't force my way in, things last longer and the body doesn't fight me. Don't come in saying ""I want that new deep tissue thing, and for you to just dig in there. I'm not afraid of pain!"" My bio on the website says that's not what I do. 

What I love: the pain relief I can provide people. Working on humans that just have good souls. The freedom of my schedule. Pretty much working when I want. Being challenged when something interesting comes in. Meeting people I'd never meet without massage. Generally feeling like I could probably solve world problems one butt at a time."

Did you use a barbell pad when thrusting? So it cushioned your hips? If it's following on the outside of your leg, I'd not guess sciatica nerve. It runs down the back (hamstrings, and calf). If you go to a Physio or PT ask about TFL involvement. It sits right at the front/side of your hip. Like find the boney part, then move an inch ish out. It starts there then goes down an inch or 3 (depending on your anatomy) and attaches to your ITB, which is the outer part of your leg. 

Definitely tell them what exercises you were doing when it started. They can give advice on what to do to prevent this.

Also, nerves take time to calm down once you piss them off. Take it easy. I'd even skip underwear in your free time, since it probably sits right on top of the irritated part.

gatesopencomeonin,fc4hhiw,t1_fc46qz5,1577416794.0,"It started early at my gym. Dude next to me didn't use bar clips to keep the weights on the bar. He wobbled, and dropped weights off both ends. One landed on my bag, which didn't have my phone. The other landed on another guy's phone. I stood there waiting to make eye contact to ask if he was ok, and point out the clips. He was so embarrassed, that he refused to look at anyone. Felt bad.. as a female I've learned to not approach people in the gym. Too many creeps."
Posture,fc4gw29,t3_eg42ax,1577416302.0,"I get that same pain! (28 F 5'2"" 147 lb 32H) For me, I make sure my bras are actually supporting me by getting refitted, and because the elastic wears out eventually. Also, I incorporate face pulls. It works that muscle too. When it gets super bad, I'll take a peanut roller set on a yoga block, lay my upper back on it so each ball is on either side of my spine, and do slow crunches moving it up and down my back. And taking that roller against my pecs on a wall, and doing like a snow angle arm against the wall. With boobs we round forward, so the pecs end up being involved."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc4fdee,t3_efwdjr,1577415051.0,"I created a sticker chart in a dot journal. Been using it for 18 months and it's become second nature, but I still want my stickers every day!

In the morning I wake up, brush my teeth and wash my face as soon as I let my dogs out. As I'm getting dressed for the day I'll make my bed. Nothing fancy, just the covers pulled back up, and straighten the pillows if they got weird.

At night, pick up my clothes and tidy up my living space, then I'll get my dogs to bed, wash my face, and floss my teeth after brushing. 

I get a sticker for brushing my teeth, washing my face, making my bed. And then a sticker at night for brushing my teeth and washing my face, and if I don't use my credit cards.

So create a chart of things you want to do. And give yourself an incentive if you want. Turns out I'm just sticker motivated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
LifeProTips,fc4et2w,t1_fc3jcyf,1577414589.0,"I do a daily journal/gratitude attitude change. I'll start with what I felt like when I woke up, 1-2 words is perfect. 2 things I'm grateful for that day. 3 goals I'd like to accomplish, like maintain my momentum of my diet. At the end of the day I list 2 amazing things that happened, today it was I found pants that fit. A brief run down of my day, couple sentences. How I'm feeling as I go to bed. Then how I'd like to feel tomorrow, setting myself up to be happier. It's stupid and weird, but it's surprisingly helpful."

TwoXChromosomes,fc3c269,t3_efumeo,1577386482.0,"I had a UTI every other month this year. Did cranberry pills, bought d-mannose, subscribed to Uqora and got their UTI prevention stuff. Did a whole month of low dose antibiotics to reset my system. What really helped the most: sleeping with no bottoms on, underwear or pants. And boric suppository pills after sex (I put one in my vag that night). And damn it if I stopped getting UTIs. Co-worker suggested sleeping in the buff, and a friend swears by the pussy pills. I'm prone to yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis too, the probiotic from Uqora and the d-mannose supplements are awesome as well."

Grew up having a dog that would eat until he got sick, eat that up, then go finish his bowl and ask for more."
