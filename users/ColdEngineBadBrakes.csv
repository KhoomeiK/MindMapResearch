NoStupidQuestions,fefbcfp,t3_eooido,1579052571.0,"There is no such thing as a gateway drug. If that were true, then when you drink beer, you'd move up into straight liquor. And ""drug"" is not ""everything that isn't cigarettes or booze."" Drugs include nicotine products and booze. And caffeine. And all the rest. Someone smoking pot doesn't find themselves suddenly in need of higher highs.

People brag about their pot use like big drinkers brag about how much they can drink. I've been almost a non-stop pot smoker (I mean, at night) for at least a decade, and I'm neither addicted nor do I want to try other things.  I've gone for weeks without marijuana on work trips, and don't find myself with the shakes or the DTs."
