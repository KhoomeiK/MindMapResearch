coolguides,ffg65tl,t3_et7ave,1579899295.0,"I downloaded this and read it carefully, multiple times. My relative with Alzheimer’s has never been an easy person to deal with. He does whatever he wants, sometimes against the advice of doctors. Now that he has little memory and is many years retired, he is almost impossible when he get something into his mind. In particular, he drinks way too much. When he hasn’t had a drink for several hours ( a rare occurrence) he can remember and think a little better, but we can’t get him to stop. From his morning coffee, to cocktails, to his wine at dinner.  

Can a therapist or other expert comment: was the writer of this list in experienced dealing with Alzheimer’s patients? How is is possible to say “Never argue” with a person like this? He has always been quick to argue about most anything.  I’d estimate that most of these are impossible with him, and I care about him and want him to be happy. So what is the advice in that case? Being critical and picking a fight is what he does."

transplant,ffcfi8l,t3_esvgo8,1579798347.0,"Medical procedures you have are no one else’s business. Be very vague. A few ideas: I’m going to be away on personal business.  Or, A friend really needs my help and I’m taking time off to help him/her.   Or, I’m going to have surgery, so I’ll be gone a while.  You can say  I don’t wanna discuss details but I’m fine.  Or, I’m taking care of something now so that it doesn’t get serious. Practice phrases like “I really don’t want to get into specifics.” Or “thank you for your concern.” Smile and be pleasant and positive. 

So you’re telling the truth, but not giving away your medical info, nor your friend’s. 

If you make up a reason, you’re going to have to remember that reason and lie again in the future, possibly years or decades. For example, if you say you got your tubes tied, someone’s going to come up and say “I was thinking of doing the same thing, can you tell me about your experience?”"

financialindependence,ff9j3r0,t3_esb29b,1579714095.0,"A little more to consider: I have two friends who are firefighters in their 50s. One even left his job as a financial advisor to be a firefighter when he was around 30.  The job gets harder as you grow older and your body slows down. Of course, you continue to work with firefighters who are younger and younger than you, and always more energetic. Both of my friends are in decent shape, but they look tired, particularly when I ask about the job. 

A previous poster said lawyers he knows suffer from health concerns as they grow older. My observation is almost everyone suffers from health concerns as they grow older; your job is a big part of which health concerns you are likely to have. 

Sounds like your lifestyle is definitely good for aspects of health. But never a bad idea to consider side hustles, or alternative careers, if and when you should be inclined to pursue one."

todayilearned,fecpvwd,t1_fecm719,1578980341.0,"So true, but not just for “the trades.“ It’s interesting to look at the continuity of life and the sorts of benefits and problems that people get in various occupations. And with other life choices, like leisure activities, childbearing, and lifestyle. Some people manage to live their whole lives without physical problems, regardless of their job. But of course there are statistical likelihoods. 

It’s my conclusion that every one of us gives our body to what we do in life. Yes, physical work can result in injuries and repetitive use problems. But sedentary work leads obesity, heart disease, stroke, & high blood pressure. Working as a typist can hurt your hands. [Sidenote: if you have severe hand injuries, what can you do in life? Answer: not much] Even athletic jobs like dancing and playing sports lead to injuries and often permanent issues like headaches, arthritis, etc. Musicians get carpal tunnel and tinnitus.

So choose your rut carefully."
