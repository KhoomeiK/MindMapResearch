wholesomememes,ff4tbf3,t1_ff4k2e9,1579571942.0,That seems to happen a lot with long movies. The director isnt rushing to get the story in. They take their time. This is really different than most movies that cram action in and makes them feel slow by comparison. A lot of people thought There Will Be Blood or the Revenant were boring too.

wholesomememes,fe8i9xt,t1_fe7tzdv,1578926434.0,"Totally fair. My point wasn't really ""everyone should hike."" My point was ""there are free/cheap/reasonably priced ways to have fun outside of the house if you desire to do so and are willing to try them."" My personal example was hiking."
wholesomememes,fe8hpi6,t1_fe6t9bp,1578926270.0,"That's all fair, and I understand that everyone is in a different situation, but if you already have a car, the price difference between sitting at home with a car parked in the lot/garage and driving to a park or trail is pretty much just gas. A my real main point was that, although I truly enjoy using my weekends to sit at home and do nothing, there are ways to go to things that don't break the bank. Doesn't have to be hiking."

wholesomememes,fe5rm79,t1_fe5qyfj,1578873599.0,I used to think this but then started to change the things I experience. Hiking just costs the gas to get to the trail.

dankchristianmemes,fdsc8si,t1_fds3f3i,1578699295.0,"If thats the view, I understand. I always understood it as Catholics praying to saints, not Catholics asking the saints to join them in prayer. But Im not Catholic, so I dont want to tell anyone what they believe."
dankchristianmemes,fdrnfb0,t1_fdraudp,1578686951.0,"I would say the Lutheran doctrinal differences between 1520 and 1530 are minimal, the change is really just the attitude toward fixing/separating from RCC after it became clear the RCC would not change or even discuss what Luther called false doctrine.

I'd add that the Formula of Concord maintains the same spirirt well after 1539 as the Gnesio Lutherans combat the kryptocalvinism that Melanchthon falls into. As far as ""one true Lutheransim,"" I think I would happily say that there is one, especially since confessional Lutherans hold a ""quia"" subscription to the BoC. As far as liberal Lutherans who tend to hold a ""quatenus"" subscription (like the ELCA) I cant really speak for them. They tend to have a broader ideology and Im not familiar enough to comment for them and wouldnt want to say something untrue or unclear since that is not my background."
dankchristianmemes,fdr9hwm,t1_fdr98gp,1578681349.0, I've done a bit and my guess is that if you do you might like melanchthon a little less by the end of it. I understand why he made the changes he did but can't support any of them
dankchristianmemes,fdr8gtw,t1_fdr7daf,1578680963.0,"I'll definitely look into this more. Just to be clear for when I go look at this later, and see what you're working with, you a AAC or UAC Melanchthonian?"
dankchristianmemes,fdr3nax,t1_fdqyvdd,1578679063.0,"So perhaps I misunderstood your stance and in that case I apologize. I guess my point is the distinction between invoking the saints and praying to them. Here they're talking about invoking the saints to pray, not praying to the saints. Some of the other comments here claim that this is the Catholic practice as well, and I would agree that a Lutheran wouldn't have a problem with invoking, but would with venerating the saints by praying to them as if the saints could answer prayers or be a needed mediator between living Christians and God or Christ."
dankchristianmemes,fdqsped,t1_fdqlrbx,1578674054.0,"As a Lutheran pastor, I'd really like to see some evidence that Luther support prayer to the saints. I've never encountered that in confessional Lutheranism (liberal Lutheranism is a whole other thing and I don't claim yo speak for them). Later when I have some time I can provide some references that speak directly against it from Luther and the Book of Concord."

OverwatchLeague,fdke15m,t1_fdkdf1t,1578501881.0,"Which is totally valid, but I think they look fine together and I think the fit is so strong it makes up for the fact that there are better color combos out there. Do you think different shades of purple/green/yellow could be better?"
OverwatchLeague,fdkbp06,t1_fdk96hv,1578500485.0,"Personally, I think the color scheme is VERY New Orleans. I like it. I just wish you could get a little green on the main logo besides just the stripe, like part of the fleur de lis. I do agree that the words ""New Orleans"" could be bigger and maybe ""Trinity"" be a little smaller."

nfl,fdhbvfy,t1_fdhb43q,1578419608.0,"But honestly there is some stuff Ringo does that's pretty tough. Don't get me wrong, he doesn't do much that would trip up an experienced drummer, but he's certainly no slouch with his technical abilities. But I agree. He's a better ""musician"" than ""drummer"" but I think that's a higher compliment than the other way around... like a guy who has played for nearly 20 years thinking that complexity is all that matter sounds to me like a pretty piss poor drummer with whom no band would really want to play."
nfl,fdgny9e,t1_fdg8cu4,1578403569.0,"My specific point was that complexity is not the measure of talent. Knowing what fits in with the rest of the song to enhance to whole instead of the individual is just as important. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of complex drumming, but its not always the right/best thing."
nfl,fdg29ik,t1_fdfy57s,1578377350.0,"Been playing drums the last 17 years. Ringo is a very good drummer but because he's a great musician he understands that sometimes the best way to serve the song is NOT to play something complex or showy. 
Example: Get Back is super simple on drums but can you imagine it with anything else?


That said, he does have some pretty cool drum parts and can get intricate when he wants but Im often more impressed by something creative and simple than something elaborate.
Example: Come Together is incredibly easy to play but sounds amazing and makes the song along with Paul's bass line."

patientgamers,fcansx1,t3_egunbx,1577572945.0,"The main point of games is to have fun. If you're having fun, you are playing correctly. How you have fun may very from game to game. How you have fun may be different than how someone else does, but if you're fun isn't interfering with someone else's, then great. For example, when my family plays Monopoly, we follow the rules. Free Parking is literally just a blank space. etc. My in-laws play with many common house rules. Chance and Community Chest money is collected and given out for free parking, etc. It's fine that they want to play this awful version of this already bad game that makes it significantly worse because that's how they have fun. The only time it sucks is when they say to me, ""oh you love board games. Play Monopoly with us."""
