hiphopheads,ff8grfr,t1_ff8dnno,1579677771.0,"That was third phase mac not second phase mac

Edit: if not fourth phase mac. Third phase mainstream mac*"
hiphopheads,ff8gqar,t1_ff88b10,1579677730.0,"EXACTLY. Much of Mac's draw, for me at least, is that I'm able to personally relate to each individual album. And it's odd to me that I have been able to pair my life events to his album releases. That's also why I, and so many, feel personally hurt by his death. Blue slide park came out when I was partying. Macedelic came out as I just started delving into psychedelics. Watching Movies with the Sound Off came out as I was at my heaviest psychedelic use. Faces came out and I didn't pay attention, Devine feminist tickled waxed my scrotum because I ended a four year relationship. Then I went back to Faces when I was at my lowest. Swimming and circles I feel match my current psychological state.

This artist has been with so many people for so many years, it's painful, knowing he won't be able to continue to make music."
hiphopheads,ff8gc7h,t1_ff8b6cu,1579677236.0,"I think what mac did so well was make albums that directly correlated with his life. And the feelings behind the albums he put out were genuine. In doing so, he was able to make people relate, and these albums feel very personal. For me, personally, the time periods in which his albums were released magch nearly perfectly with the issues in my life. Divine Feminine was right when I ended a four year relationship, and that album just strung every emotional cord in my soul, but if I was in the mindset I'm in now, I'm sure it wouldn't have anywhere near the same meaning. Now my brain connects the same emotions I felt at the time so I can't weigh that particular (or any of his albums) without heavy bias"

Supplements,feej11i,t1_fe5g5ue,1579034739.0,"To a degree. But there's a max absorption when certain supplements compete. Magnesium is a big one I can think of. Because doses ofagnesium glycine are so high, if you take a handful of supplements (I'm not sure off the top of my head what supplements compete with magnesium absorption) the absorption caps out at a certain amount. So taking two supplements that compete, at the same time, leads to less absorption of both. If you split up when you take both (one on the morning, one several hours later), you can significantly raise your absorption because they will be processed at seperate times and the areas they are absorbed will no longer be processing the other supplement.

I'm sure I got something wrong, just look into it a little. I get what you're saying but the end result is don't take competing supplements at the same time."

StackAdvice,fe1ez56,t1_fdyzj9g,1578825791.0,"It's not about the danger of high doses you dolt. There are a ton of things that are safe at low doses and deadly at high, and things that are safe all around. The issue is that there isn't enough known about it. One study potentially showed permenant downregulation of dopamine. We just don't know much about it overall"
Supplements,fe1c3hi,t1_fe02h5x,1578824853.0,"What. I've heard zinc should be taken with copper, but I'm assuming either your first language isn't English or you just don't know how absorption works.

If they compete for absorption you DON'T want to take them all at once. If you do, they'll all have trouble being absorbed. I truly have no idea how you were so elequently able to contradict yourself and not realize it.

Zinc can hinder the absorption of copper. So copper is supplemented besides it because the copper you are getting from food might not be enough and you could become deficient without additional supplementation."

homeless,fe15ncw,t3_enc6yo,1578822771.0,"As others have said, different degrees of homeless.

Some are by choice. Some have a difficult time finding homes because of past crimes and or credit. Some are mentally ill. Some are between jobs. I have been homeless several times in my life. All of which unfortunately could have possibly been fixed with some mental health support. But not knowing where to go and not being able to pay for a therapist, or antidepressants, I destroyed my life in the state of mind I was in. I'm doing well now but will forever have to deal with consequences from the lack of options available to me."

HeadphoneAdvice,fbyv7lb,t1_fbtj9pd,1577227222.0,"Would the K371 not be suitable for listening to music then? I'm looking for something that will allow me to enjoy my music as much as possible. I'll be purchasing an amp/DAC (idk what one yet), and I'm debating between the K371, beyerdynamic DT 770 or 880 (higher ohms maybe probably?), Sennheiser HD 599, or the Philips X2HR. 

I know these are all VASTLY different headphones, but I haven't had good quality headphones (let alone any at all) for five or more years, so I have no idea if I prefer open or closed back. I'll be primarily using them for music, because I absolutely love putting on good quality headphones and just vibing out with the music.

Unsure of sound, I generally prefer more well balanced and neutral sound. Though not completely lacking it bass. I don't like mids to be lost in a sea of bass."
