And a dump truck is a hydraulic bed, was slightly raised and smashed into a bridge. It closed the bridge and all travel from ND to MN (North Dakota to Minnesota) for a while. So they now had to drive extra long to the next closest auger best plant. For the farmer we worked for it was over an hour drive to the next plant vs about 39 minute drive."
smarthome,fefflp1,t1_fefe7vt,1579055294.0,"So. So far I have loved it I have had the lock almost a year. To use it through you phone without Bluetooth. You have to buy a separate hub(has came in handy a couple times). 

I also use the key fob dongles. I don‚Äôt carry an actual house key on my keys. And I have only replaced the batteries in the door once (4 AA). Since May 2019. 

I have a routine with Alexa to auto lock my door at 10 pm. Kevo works great with Alexa. I can unlock the door using a verbal password as well. The thing I like about the Kevo is it‚Äôs kwikset so you can rekey to door to existing keys. Or change the key to a new one anytime.
