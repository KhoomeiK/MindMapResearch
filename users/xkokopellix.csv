EverythingScience,ffa5pqs,t3_escmmv,1579728399.0,I was washing dishes yesterday and the tap water became bubbly itself.  It took forever to wait for the suds to wash out.  It had a different look compared to the soap I use and it smelled weird.
AskWomen,ff9mdt3,t3_es99h3,1579716029.0,"I was friends with someone who just had everything going for her: looks, style, interests, highly creative and a strong personality.  I wasn’t per say jealous of her because I respected her and valued her but I hated that I couldn’t figure it out, didn’t have a beautiful body, not stylish whatsoever, etc.  We sort of fell off as friends since I moved far away.  I had started a photography business on my own and had a pretty good solid business but when I found her on Facebook, I found out that she was doing the exact same thing I was but hers was better, far more creative and she had more power in terms of connections.  I felt so frustrated that I decided to stop following her on social media.  I was happy for her because her work was awesome but I don’t know.  I suck at life I guess.  

I would like to point out that she was never competitive with me on purpose or would ever say anything to make me feel bad. I could just feel bad all on my own. Lol"

cats,ff50h02,t1_ff3lzng,1579576930.0,"One year the fire department came to our building. I quickly told my daughter to grab one cat while I grabbed another. We didn’t have a fire on our floor but it was on an attached building. I managed to make it outside with our cats clawing our shoulders and we were stuck outside for hours.  I didn’t even think about their cages.  Luckily we didn’t have any damage to our building.  I now keep the cages near the closet by the front door and room doors locked when we’re home. My cats spend majority of their time in the living room dining and hall, but in case of an emergency they won’t scatter to the bedrooms and hide."
AskReddit,ff4zlkx,t3_erhu3x,1579576289.0,I had a dream that me and Ex were a pair of bad ass assassins.  We knew karate (I don’t know any karate) and we had crazy amounts of weapons (I don’t even know how to shoot a regular gun) but we were kicking ass.  At some point during my dream my cat decided to use my face as a launching pad in the middle of the night and woke me up as I was kicking butt in my dream. I had to go back to that dream. It was so intense and I probably did go back into it but don’t remember how it ended.
