You write very well and I like the characterizations. It's very interesting to read. :) Looking forward to more!"

regina,fdf49xp,t1_fderbjk,1578352967.0,Looks like a couple now for Integral. It's not too far out of my way so I'll definitely have to check it out.
regina,fdf463p,t1_fdeymn1,1578352897.0,"Interesting. I'll look into it, thank you! I need someone who would be thorough due to needing constant follow up on bloodwork... which I admit I've been lacking on."
AskReddit,fde9kzs,t3_ekxr0a,1578334187.0,"Still sticks with me now, even 20 some years later. I was about five years old and had chased my cousin who stole my bike as a joke. He rode right back to the house, but because he was on a bike and I was on foot, I never saw the turns he took. I was completely lost. I sat on the corner of the street and just bawled my eyes out.

Some random guy sees me crying, calms me down, and asks me what's wrong. So I tell him I'm lost and I'm still sobbing, and the guy gets my address out of me and takes me right home. He didn't have to help me, but he took the time out of his day to help some random child crying their eyes out."

I feel ecstatic that Victor crushed him... and it was really well written also. I love your descriptions and I look forward to reading more from you as I scroll through this community!"

WritingPrompts,fd6p609,t1_fd6lwfn,1578194039.0,I quite enjoyed this. Thanks for this gem!!
todayilearned,fd6ihkj,t1_fd6i2uy,1578191545.0,Makes sense. I honestly think I only use them for the symbols and never for the numbers.
todayilearned,fd6himq,t1_fd6avtq,1578191104.0,I couldn't do without it. I almost never use the one running across the top.
todayilearned,fd6ao6k,t1_fd6af9z,1578188084.0,Not if you're using the number pad. The 0 is just under the 1.
