SuicideWatch,feolkyo,t3_eq7tt1,1579301896.0,"I'm sorry to go against your wishes but you should definitely hang on at least a little longer, you never know what's coming. And I know how you feel, trust me I do, but suicide will only pass on your pain to those you love, and sometimes it's not about finding a will to live, it's about finding a purpose or something to live for:)"

confessions,fenam8y,t3_eq2y36,1579280581.0,"As a guy in a relationship that would really hurt me, I recommend that you don't keep the secret from him and then have a good, mature conversation with him and discuss what you should do together. I think it's kinda unfaithful but I understand why you did it, it makes sense.

If I were him if want you to stop, but at the end of the day it's what you want and I'm not judging, I do however think you should seriously talk about it to him. You never know he may understand and not have a problem with it :)"

TrueOffMyChest,fdv0h06,t3_en5fo1,1578741717.0,"My SO is amazing, she's F16 and I'm M17 we've been together for a little over a year, officially, before then we were both single and spending time talking and together as if we were already in a relationship.

Anyway, she's so amazing, she's gorgeous, kind loving, she's smart, she does these really cute things that are just so pure of her and show her being herself to such a level of purity it's just amazing, it makes my heart melt.

A couple of months into us being together she got diagnosed? Anyway, she got told she had adhd which was a big deal for her, but also explained a lot, I read into it at the time and apparently that is usually found in people when they're children. I obviously knew her before that and she has never understood why I don't think it matters,(in a good way, and I explained the good way) I always say, ""you're the same you I met and it doesn't matter because I always just saw your attention span and spontaneous changes in task as a part of what makes you who you are, which makes it amazing."" She had a few bad spells with depression and I always made sure she knew I was there, I'd go see her and spend time with her, we once got into an argument because she wouldn't phone me if she was up at night (a d wanted to) cos I was asleep. She really is amazing.

When I had a depressive period she was there for me, it put such a strain on our relationship, it was so sad, she made me get help and I ended up in therapy, she was so good, we split up temporarily before this and after i continued going to my sessions even without her she saw I wanted to get better whereas before I didn't even admit I wasn't okay, but she knew. Nearly four months down the line we've been together since a few days after our break, and had our one year together, she changed me for the better, she saved my life and I like to think that we saved each other's, she told me that herself btw. 

She never used to believe that she's pretty, or smart or that she deserved better friends than the ones who abused her when we were at school, or that anyone could love her, or that her pain was not permanent and that things would get better, together we have both become better people and I truly love her more than anything ever and all her little ""qwirks"" and parts of her she doesn't like or whatever, her flaws, her strong points and everything inbetween. I would do anything for her. 

If you're reading this bub I love you"

DoesAnybodyElse,fdhe12s,t3_el3odk,1578420686.0,"I can almost totally relate, I find it really hard sometimes to be even partially present in my own life, it's difficult sometimes and I struggle to maintain conversations, because I end up zoning out real bad and my body just automatically says yeah every 20 seconds whilst I'm talk8ng to someone so it seems like I'm listening until I say yeah and it makes no sense, I struggle to listen to voices over white noise sometimes even when it's really soft white noise and it leads me to then overthink the fact I'm unable to listen to what I'm being told and shit, and it makes me drive myself into a huge pit of all sort of things that I shouldn't be experiencing, all as if done on autopilot, 8ve never figured out why or what causes it but once it happens it's hard to go back to the normal yknow, this is the first time I've ever come across anything remotely similar to my own issues, I hope you figure it out :D"

My only advice is to keep strong, no matter how hard it is, as long as you're struggling, you're still winning, just maybe not as fast as you'd like :)"
