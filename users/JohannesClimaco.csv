Take for example my roommate. He liked coding, watching rick and morty, and playing soccer. His girlfriend didn’t really like any of those things. She probably watched Rick and Morty for his sake, and he would probably watch something like the Bachelor or her favorite romantic comedy for her sake.

I'd like more information on why he started cooking meth, as nothing concretely states that he started because he could or couldn't find a job.
