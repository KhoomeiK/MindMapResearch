LearnUselessTalents,fct7qg3,t1_fct6y3u,1577935096.0,"Right on, I'm Indian and our curriculum is equally fucked. Learnt a bunch of shit in school and college which I ended up forgetting anyway. So now I watch videos on YouTube to relearn some of that stuff. Also, congrats on becoming a grandma! Bet that kid's gonna learn shit the right way. Oh and a happy new year too!"
LearnUselessTalents,fcsv8p0,t1_fby28rv,1577925971.0,Idk what common core is but I do try to apply whatever I learn to the real world. Thanks for the reply (also you graduated high school two years after I was born)
fasting,fcstrns,t1_fcrg1zw,1577924898.0,Do you drink it hot? If so have you tried room temperature tea (or even cold)
LearnUselessTalents,fby0mlm,t1_fbxzw2i,1577205229.0,"Pretty neat. How do you know this? Did you just, like, think about it for a moment and then typed it out? Or did you read about it somewhere"
LearnUselessTalents,fbxs3gv,t3_eepch2,1577198981.0,Can anybody tell me why it works?
collegeadvice,fbfnjuc,t1_fbex1jb,1576815156.0,"Thanks so much for the reply. I don't have too much of a preference when it comes to the area as long as it isn't unsafe, racist (I'm not white) and has good employment opportunities. Academically, I'll be honest I could've done waay better but unfortunately I had to take a gap year mid course due to reasons. I feel like I could mitigate some of the damage by explaining it in my statement of purpose. And again I have no preference when it comes to campus size etc as long it has a decent mix of culture, decent faculty. I could DM you if you're okay with that as any more details and I'd be doxxing myself"
