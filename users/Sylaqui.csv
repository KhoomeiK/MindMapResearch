I never cried and it took another probably 5 years  before I realized that I was worth something, but I have a lovely life now and it's because she's gone.  You don't get a free pass in death if you were an asshole in life."

AmItheAsshole,fds67kq,t1_fds4rkk,1578695266.0,"That's a nasty attitude to have.  Ferals need TNR, it's humane, helps reduce and even eliminate the problem and helps the environment by reducing predation numbers.  It only takes a couple of years to see a large decrease in their numbers with good TNR programs.  

Advocating shooting animals that are only doing what evolution deems they do shows you to be cruel, is not very empathetic and doesn't help the issue.  It isn't the fault of the cats that some asshole introduced them to a new habitat."

AmItheAsshole,fdg9xa6,t3_el2ls9,1578386408.0,"NTA,  there's zero wrong with wanting to feel confident and attractive again.  Some women's bodies pop back after birth with a bit if exercise, a lot don't.  Wanting to feel good about yourself is not selfish, nor does it make you a bad mother.  Women have more purpose in life than reproducing.  Wth, is wrong with your family and friends."

It drives us nuts because the password doesn't change you just have different authorities under each job role.  If I'm doing something and a colleague asks for help doing / looking at something ( I work in multiple areas) I have to log out each time.  It doesn't save your permissions under your name, you're assigned different job roles for each different thing you do."

unpopularopinion,fd25w82,t3_ejs21m,1578142192.0,"So agree with this and the spatial awareness comment.  I don't mind if someone walks slower than I do as they may be old, sick, relaxing etc. It becomes a problem when they are completely unaware of their surroundings and take up the entire pavement.  I've literally had to walk in the road to get past people like this.  The worst are groups of mothers and their prams/strollers walking side by side or families that have mom and dad in the middle and let their herd of children spread out all around them.  Not only is this dangerous, because you're next to a road, but it's so selfish.  How hard is it really to tell the kids to move over and let other people pass?"
AmItheAsshole,fd23d5n,t3_ejshsu,1578141054.0,"NTA.  I am so sorry for your loss.  An important lesson needs to be learned here and if you pursuing legal action helps impart some consequences and understanding, it's important that you do so.   It sadly won't bring your wife back, but it may help prevent someone else from experiencing the same devastating loss in their life.

I worked with a woman that had epilepsy and was told that she shouldn't be driving but also still had a licence for some reason.  She ended up getting in a nasty accident while her child was in the car due to lightning with a thunderstorm that popped up.  She then had the gall to ask several of us at work to write affidavits stating that she never usually drove, what a moral person she was and that she was only driving that day due to an emergency...none of which is true.

I've gone through a period of not having a vehicle and am aware of how much not being able to drive sucks, it's horribly limiting.  However, if you have a condition that makes it dangerous for you to be driving, you shouldn't do it.  People forget that cars are chunks of metal moving and high rates of speed."
