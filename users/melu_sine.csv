relationshipanarchy,feusvr7,t3_eqltac,1579389619.0,"Hmmm.. I'm definitely not an RA spokesperson, and I'm not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but I cohabitate with a long-term no-longer-sexual dear friend. Additionally, I believe some would perceive our relationship to be slightly codependent; this tendency likely relates to my struggles with severe social anxiety and agoraphobia. In spite of this, we both still very much value our autonomy. 

I don't consider them a nesting partner, but they are an important person in my life, we've known each other a long time, and we live well together. Ideally I want them to lead a rich, fulfilling life and to be free to be fully self-actualized. They can come and go in my life as they please, and likewise for myself. I'm not opposed to the idea of being sexually intimate again with them in the future, should that be something we both desire at any point. We often share our resources, *but --* and this is very important to me -- we also frequently share our individual resources with other important people in our lives as well. 

In my opinion, as long as you're getting something out of RA philosophy, then maybe enjoy that aspect and don't worry too much about the label itself. There's such rich material out there from the RA community regarding human interaction and dismantling existing societal power structures, that I feel it's worth exploring, regardless of where you, or I, end up on our respective journeys. Also, if you haven't had a chance yet, I think it's helpful, to look at and read into the political aspects of RA and how they may or may not relate to your life."
relationshipanarchy,feoykvh,t1_fem15r5,1579308197.0,"I'm not sure. I'm definitely not opposed to it, should it ever happen. However, when I really connect with and care about a person, I tend to naturally want to dote on them and give them a lot of love and affection. 

I guess there's basically no intrinsic distinction I make between different types of caring, if that makes sense? In the past, I may have held myself back to only behave ""romantically,"" or believed it was only valid, in specific contexts. 

More recently I find it just feels more authentic to be that way with everyone I'm close to. I'm still learning, deconstructing, and working things out though."
relationshipanarchy,fekb8u7,t3_enjogh,1579196431.0,"I can relate, certainly. I prefer to operate from a place of giving love and just being open to meaningful connections in whatever form they take. I don't bother with labels for the most part, and just let things be, while trying to encourage good communication and discussions with important people in my life. I do struggle with boundaries, as far as ensuring that I'm protected emotionally. Also, I've been having a really hard time with friends who are ""dating,"" and want to talk non-stop about that sort of thing. In some ways I start to feel like they're speaking a language I just don't understand."
relationshipanarchy,fek9qri,t3_en45fm,1579195549.0,"Romance, to me, would be actively trying to make people that are important to me feel loved and appreciated, without worrying about social constructs or directing that aspect of myself only towards people that have some sort of sexual appeal. I guess I would consider most of my close friendships to be ""romantic"" in some way or another. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that I would want to be sexually involved with all my close friends."
AvPD,fcojusb,t3_ei8b28,1577834049.0,Thanks for writing this. It's nice to read even a tiny bit of hope from someone in what can seem like a pretty bleak world. Happy New Year!
AvPD,fcny5lw,t3_ei2yhx,1577820716.0,"Happy New Year to you! Know the feeling all too well. I'm trying to get away from people who can't, won't, or just don't, extend basic common courtesy or human decency. I would rather put my energy into people who have shown themselves to be sincere and kind. Maybe they'll still write you, but if it's a consistent pattern with no good explanation, doesn't really reflect well on the overall dynamic. I'm really sorry you're feeling this way."
depression,fcnqrrh,t3_ei2u67,1577816669.0,"Aww, that sounds so fun. Wish I could join ya, but no where even remotely close. Just know you're awesome, even if they cancelled. Happy New Year anyway."
depression,fcno42h,t3_ei2jv7,1577815181.0,"Happy New Year stranger! I've spent many a new year's eve on my own and know how lonely, sad, and awful it can feel. I'm trying to view 2020 as a fresh start and a clean slate. Wishing you the best this coming year and for fresh hope in the new decade."
depression,fcnlz2d,t3_ehotyn,1577814033.0,"Same. I've fallen into a pretty deep depression after pouring years and so much of my energy into some pretty shitty people. Last time I even tried to say I was having a rough time, I was told to go kill myself, in an incredibly snotty way. There have been a lot of other instances too. I don't think I can really forgive at this point. I know I am responsible for my own choices. Just trying to distance myself and set some boundaries now. It's hard though when you have a soft heart."
