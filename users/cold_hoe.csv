relationship_advice,fegyba0,t1_fee5x76,1579105235.0,"I come from a culture where families are also very tight knit. 

Trust me i'm 29 year old doctor in eu, make decent money, have a family who are all well cared for and my dad still beat me up last year because i didn't do things his way which he thought was better. (Spoiler alert: it wasn't)

His family probably really means good, that he looks demasculanated, but it's not always black and white."
