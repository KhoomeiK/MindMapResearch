I've said again and again that you simply can't win against a group of people that are willing to lie repeatedly and deny reality and facts. With Fox and other stations supporting the lies, and creating the idea that to believe anything other than the fox rhetoric is akin to believing the devils lies... Well the Republican party planned this out and nothing will change what they are planning to do.

This is going to get worse."

AskReddit,fc3hbtr,t1_fc3g9go,1577389809.0,"Yep, same stuff, although stabilized. The way they figured out what nitro does is kinda fun. Back when they were putting the railroad across the USA, they had a car at the end of the supply train(on the same track they were building) that had the explosives in it.

I'm not a chemist, but this is how it was explained to me:

Nitroglycerin actually is a byproduct of old dynamite, it ""sweats"" out the oil and is why the old dynamite is so dangerous.

They kept finding guys that unloaded the old dynamite would pass out. The nitroglycerin was touching their bare skin and getting absorbed, causing their blood vessels to dilate and dropped their bp down too low to keep them conscious.

After a while someone picked up on the effect and figured out how to stabilize it for medical use."
AskReddit,fc3ajxp,t3_efvlef,1577385458.0,"Paramedic here, one common one is when older guys are having chest pain and we want to give them nitroglycerin paste/pills to help the chest pain.

One thing that doesn't mix well is nitro and Viagra...it causes a blood pressure drop that can be really dangerous.

We always ask and make it really clear that if we give the nitro and they are taking Viagra and similar meds that they could die. It usually takes 3 or 4 warnings in a row before the guy will admit it.

Early on I made the mistake of trusting a guy after just a couple mentions of how dangerous it would be. 

I sprayed the nitro under his tongue and he said ""does generic Viagra count?""

Fuck.

At one point his BP wasn't even registering on the box cuff, it was bad. I thought I was going to get screamed at by my doctor, but he just laughed and said it was so common that he wasn't upset, and gave me a couple ideas on how to make it clear how dangerous it was to the patient."
