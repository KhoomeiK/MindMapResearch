KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff929eq,t1_ff8s30c,1579703062.0,Eh my parents had to clean up my dog's shit all the time cuz she really loved taking a shit in their bedroom. If they have pets its probably nbd
HPfanfiction,ff91qcw,t1_ff8xt91,1579702668.0,I know a fic where lupin teaches in 2nd year instead of Lockhart. That's not how he finds pettigrew though. Though they do get him
YouOnLifetime,ff7p2ag,t1_ff42mdx,1579654885.0,Idk he was still slimy. He did the pg 13 version of indecent proposal to those newlyweds and drugged joe without his consent.
YouOnLifetime,ff7ovgx,t1_ff6lkv2,1579654753.0,What was the reason in the book?
Awwducational,ff64f79,t3_erscnl,1579618863.0,r/TIHI
cringepics,ff64dao,t1_ff5a2ki,1579618827.0,I knew a guy who told me he worked in government. Later he said he worked as a cashier for fine wine and good spirits. All liquor stores are controlled by the state in PA
AskMen,ff61ycw,t1_ff5ji1s,1579617073.0,That's funny cuz my gay couple friends never recycle.
AmItheAsshole,ff3u2j1,t1_ff3frs9,1579548861.0,Why do you assume family = blood? OP or her sister could have been adopted or from an egg/sperm donation.
TheOutsider,ff3stc2,t1_ff38o4e,1579548087.0,"Ooh that's a really good catch. That definitely makes sense. Maybe TV version of the outsider will be more prolific in building ""followers"" than the book version"
TheOutsider,ff3sn5s,t1_ff2lvbd,1579547982.0,I guess they'll have the monster be more difficult to kill maybe? IMO the ending was kinda anti climatic. Didnt she literally just hit him with a weight in a sock?
TheOutsider,ff3sfei,t1_ff24eko,1579547848.0,I believe he hung himself so he likely didnt kill himself because someone else was about to kill him momentarily.
Avenue5,ff3pcb0,t1_ff39c5s,1579545962.0,His hair is on point
HPfanfiction,ff2a2v8,t1_ff0m03q,1579498314.0,"Well shit I thought there'd be a lot more lol. I think ffnet took awhile to add the pairing option. 

Hey, porn is plot too

But yes I suppose you're right it's not necessarily a good metric"
HPfanfiction,ff06uch,t1_fex721u,1579465793.0,"I think I wasnt using language english but I was looking at length > 1000

Well tbf I wouldnt use cho/harry as a good metric because basically no one likes her as a character. Theres way more daphne/harry fics even more lavender/harry I think. 

I cant really think of any other metric. Maybe using the pairings on AO3? Or if theres not a dedicated fan site for x pairing then likely it's a rare pair."
HPfanfiction,fewlcz3,t1_feshep8,1579413497.0,"So maybe use 100 as the cutoff then? Also I'm seeing 2100 for them. Using ratings ""all"""
Free_Accounts,fevcxvp,t3_eql43z,1579395887.0,I want it

AmItheAsshole,fernz16,t1_fer4x6z,1579356316.0,"So since you added the edit that you're moving to Norway of course that changes things so I don't think YTA. But as for your sentiment about common names. 

I feel theres a middle ground between super common names and extremely rare names. For example john, which many people have and like trey which is uncommon but not extremely rare."
HPfanfiction,ferknq0,t1_fepn6ww,1579355130.0,Are they straight female writers writing gay male slash or straight male writers writing lesbian scenes? Or straight men writing gay male sex scenes?
HPfanfiction,fepmxc2,t1_fenv90s,1579324782.0,I mean they kinda do broadly. I doubt many straight men want to write extremely graphic gay sex scenes. Of course there are some but likely a minority.
AmItheAsshole,fepbsfu,t1_fep0lh8,1579316675.0,"Deeeeeefinitely not an actuary. You have to take multiple exams to become an actuary and they're quite difficult. 

Business consultant yeah sure."
HPfanfiction,feou4v5,t1_feniwua,1579305564.0,You could define rare pair as less than 1000 fics under that pairing on fanfiction.net.
AmItheAsshole,felwc3u,t1_fekrbpc,1579232565.0,You need a stats or math degree to become a statistician. Often times a graduate degree. I dont know anyone who majored in business who learned more than basic stats.
PandR,felrq5h,t1_feg7nh1,1579229305.0,They say very often that cost of living is really low in Pawnee. Plus I think leslie probably got a full ride for college so maybe her mom helps her out a lot too.
AskNYC,fek3xy6,t1_fek1xgg,1579192095.0,Pretty sure anyone who ever said that phrase unironically has never actually made coitus
gaming,fejmw6z,t1_fejixgx,1579180246.0,Tbf you get murdered if you're famous in china but not spouting off pro China shit
TheOutsider,feix9f8,t1_feedzos,1579149741.0,Good catch yeah its ozark not the ozarks
AskReddit,feftlnq,t1_feepl4z,1579064810.0,Youd probably lose productivity in work from the excess bathroom trips rather than being inebriated.
aww,feekht1,t1_fednda5,1579035585.0,"Ehh 99% of adopted kids whose adoptive parents arent complete assholes usually turn out fine. 

If you're getting that info from going on the adoption subreddit then you're getting hugely biased views. Most of the adoptees on there had really shitty adoptive parents. 

Look into international adoption maybe? It's more expensive than domestic infant adoption but you dont have to worry about the bio mom changing their mind."
aww,feek4cs,t1_fedo6pg,1579035371.0,"You could at least try DNA testing. Many have had a lot of success using 23andme or ancestry. 

I was adopted from an Asian country so I basicakly have zero hope of finding my birth parents and even if I did, they wouldnt speak english."
aww,feej63h,t1_fee2w31,1579034821.0,"Eh if I could have hid my adoption from people I would have (I'm a different race from my parents so it wasnt really possible) 

If I ever adopt a same race kid I would tell them to keep it more on the DL cuz honestly that report doesn't work. I know from experience."
aww,feeikua,t1_fee5kgq,1579034478.0,"The baby most likely has alive bio parents. They just couldnt or wouldnt take care of the kid. 

I dont think these people are assholes for adopting a baby but the commenter is correct that theres way more people who want to adopt than there are available babies. 

IMO the people who really step up are the ones taking in foster kids."
aww,feei83k,t1_fee4qvd,1579034274.0,Plus kids who are taken away from their family at age past like 5 or so tend to have some serious trauma from either a) the separation or b) the situation of having such bad parents that you had to be removed from their care.
aww,feei11r,t1_fee00qt,1579034159.0,"Actually there's about 40 waiting couples for every available baby to be adopted within the US. 

OP is actually very lucky to even be able to adopt."
TheOutsider,feeh92q,t1_feeao6x,1579033713.0,"Yeah I read doctor sleep and the institute fairly recently and all of them had a ton of really specific references. 

Its just the outsider and those books that have do that though? The only other books I've read from him are carrie and firestarter"
TheOutsider,fee0312,t1_fedzpg0,1579023531.0,His other book the institute had the tv rights bought literally the day it was released
TheOutsider,fedyyj6,t1_febsysj,1579022845.0,"Heavy spoilers follow



<spoiler>Isnt he abit targeted? The outsider seems to hang out near the graves of the relatives of the person that he takes over. That's why he was in the Marysville hole was because a ton of Bolton's relatives died down there.</spoiler>

>! So the outsider wouldnt have much luck with taking over say an someone from out of town like a 1st gen immigrant. !<"
TheOutsider,fedx1so,t3_eoit3i,1579021701.0,I just finished the book after watching the first two episodes and honestly I hope the adaption becomes a lot less faithful.
AskNYC,fedlm6c,t3_eoc4f7,1579014554.0,"I'd probably suggest getting roommates in brooklyn. You could try befriending them. A lot of young people tend to live there and it's definitely cheaper than Manhattan. 

I live in the UES and I wouldnt say theres much of a community here for new grads."
AskNYC,fc1zjna,t1_fc1viui,1577334721.0,"I'd probably like to stay under $500 for ideally pants, blazer and shirt."
pokemonmaxraids,fc1tnzc,t3_efpj7e,1577329370.0,I sent a request! Thanks so much!
AskNYC,fc0xv9i,t1_fc0uyd0,1577302626.0,All I know is that itll take forever to get into. The line is ridiculous.
AskNYC,fc0xtwb,t3_efk7vc,1577302595.0,I went there for about an hour once to play video games and also we went upstairs abit. I dont think they are very strict about the hour time because we stayed maybe 20 minutes but it seemed others there were down for the long haul. However it wasnt busy at all so that may have contributed to it. I think we also didnt pay the $10. I hope this helps.
AskNYC,famvrsx,t3_e9zioz,1576214324.0,i try to time duolingo levels so that I can start one at a stop where I can access 4g. if i don't time it right then I end up just reading harry potter
