I have been on and off reddit since the pre-Digg disporia days and I remember when the front page was entirely recent scientific discoveries and the occasional self-deprecating nerd comic. As the years went by I started only looking at twox and the dog subreddits. Then twox went frontpage and became cool girl/feminist apologia central. For a long time I stuck to dogs, embroidery, pregnancy, and baby names. And then after hearing what a toxic place this is I came to check it out and it‚Äôs like twox got reincarnated to actually combat some of the horrific misogyny. Sooo nice to see it."
PurplePillDebate,ff7d3jp,t1_ff6wzyd,1579646766.0,"I would ask you to cite sources but obviously it would be impossible. Let‚Äôs look at sleep deprivation. 48 hours of sleep deprivation will cause: 

* immune system disruption

* hormonal imbalances 

* risky decisions

* speech impairments 

* altered metabolism

* decreased motivation

* disrupted appetite

* vision and hearing impairments

* altered perception

* memory deficits

* decreased hand-eye coordination

* tremors

* increased risk of accidents

Many of those effects show up after 24 hours of sleep deprivation and only get worse with more time. Studies have found 24 hours without sleep lead to cognitive impairments equivalent to 0.10 BAC. 

Chronic sleep deprivation leads to increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity. 

Plenty of men abstain for sex for years for a variety of reasons. Plenty of careers require it for months at a time. Sure, masturbation doesn‚Äôt feel as good as sex and being sexually frustrated sucks. But it does not carry even 1/10th of the risk factors of sleep deprivation, malnutrition, insufficient protection from the elements, etc. Sexual intercourse is simply not a human need. Believing that it is is completely ridiculous. 

Women should absolutely avoid sleeping with men too early in a relationship, if only to avoid dating men like you. What‚Äôs your plan when your wife has kids? What if she gets cancer? If sex is truly a human need I suppose that‚Äôs your moment to hire a prostitute? ü§Æ"

I understand that many men (like many women) desire sex greatly. I understand that men have much less to lose pursuing casual sex and many do so. I understand that physically men need to ejaculate. I understand that (like women) men need a certain amount of human intimacy and kindness to be happy. 

None of this makes sexual intercourse look like a ‚Äúneed‚Äù, any more than eating steak is a need. In the course of human history, many men have been celibate for one reason or another. Certainly explorers in many settings seem to survive just fine without it.

Going off of what you‚Äôve written here I think your best bet is a ‚Äúshepherd-mix‚Äù. Shelters frequently have medium-sized short-haired dogs with pointy ears that are moderate in exercise requirements but could keep up on a run. If low shedding is high priority you probably want either a standard or miniature poodle rather than a dog with fur though. 

Fill out the breed recommendation survey for better feedback. A big question is what‚Äôs the relative balance between running and couch potatoing?

He may need more exercise and/or mental stimulation. You should think about whether you can up the time you spend playing and training with him. I‚Äôd also really recommend giving him a good variety of safe chews. Frozen stuffed Kongs keep even heavy chewers busy a pretty long time. At two, he‚Äôs still learning about the world and by encouraging him to chew appropriate things you have a shot at helping him build the habit of chewing on things that aren‚Äôt likely to kill him."

If your parents refuse to rehome either dog or get professional help the dogs will probably continue to fight, and the fights are likely to escalate in intensity.

I don‚Äôt have kids and I only have one dog, but reading through parenting blogs it is very very common for new parents to feel a seismic shift in their affections and priorities. Obviously many folks can navigate this while still taking good care of their dogs, but I do think this is part of the frequent recommendation to space new kids and new dogs out by about two years. It can take a while to really settle into a routine with either a new baby or a new dog. If you know you want kids in the near future, maybe hold off on the dog for now and have faith that when the time is right, the right dog will be there for you."

The BC already had a record of snapping at the puppy and now both dogs could end up dead because of inadequate safety precautions. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned from this sub it‚Äôs that people overestimate dog‚Äôs understanding of appropriate force. Sooo many stories of dead cats, scarred puppies, toddlers with stitches, etc. etc. etc. Dogs have teeth and loving belly rubs and human affection does NOT mean they understand how to be gentle with small animals/babies. It is our job as owners to keep everyone safe. If your dog is snapping or growling at a small animal or toddler KEEP THEM SEPARATED, do not trust the dog to give consistently appropriate corrections.

dogs,fejmjqx,t3_epi99u,1579179923.0,"Are you able to take him to wherever you are living? And can you afford behavioral intervention?

I personally wouldn‚Äôt be that freaked out by the ‚Äúif he did this to a puppy he could do it to a child‚Äù line of thinking. I‚Äôm assuming this was a very tiny puppy, and that sort of size discrepancy can result in serious injuries if the dog isn‚Äôt aware how delicate small puppies are. Obviously he cannot have access to small dogs anymore, and I would muzzle him in public as a safety precaution. You would also want to work with a behaviorist to see if they can help him be more comfortable with other animals, and to see if they pick up on any red flags working with him. 

It is possible to own a border collie without a yard, it just means you need to commit to doing a lot of one-on-one work with him before and after work.

You‚Äôre doing a great job keeping her as comfortable as possible, but I suspect you‚Äôre right that she‚Äôs in pain. If you put it off another week, two weeks, a month, the best case is that you‚Äôll continue to see slow deterioration, but the worst is that she will cross a threshold where the pain becomes unbearable, she gets seriously injured slipping and falling, or loses her ability to eat and drink. There is something to be said for doing it when your dog can still enjoy some things and be aware you‚Äôre with her, so that her final days can be as pleasant as possible. 

The changes in her behavior are what really make me think this is probably the end of the road for her. Animals will often seek solitude in their final days. The restlessness and sleeping alone sounds like that behavior.  

If you‚Äôre really not ready you can talk to your vet about how to continue to keep her comfortable. It sounds like you have the capacity to have someone with her full time and I don‚Äôt think this is unreasonable.

BabyBumps,feh5ojc,t3_ep4q4v,1579109668.0,"I would stop arguing about the junior thing and lay out some baselines for picking a name together. Picking a name is one of the first parenting decisions you and your husband will make, and it‚Äôs important that 

* both of you feel like your opinions are heard and respected
* both of you are open, flexible, and willing to compromise
* the decision you end up making is one both of you feel good about, even if it‚Äôs not your first choice. 

It seems to me this is a really common sense set of baselines, maybe you and your husband will come up with other parameters important to both of you. This type of approach is completely incompatible with one person getting stuck on a name and clinging to it over their partner‚Äôs objections. It requires that both people make a good faith effort to find a name both parents agree on.

dogs,fee5zlr,t3_eooluk,1579027103.0,"There are a lot of studies about punishment vs R+ training styles. Since I see many of those have already been linked, I won‚Äôt reiterate them. But here are a couple more things I think about when working with my own dog. 

* Dog training is inherently frustrating. I‚Äôm skeptical of any type of correction because the human impulse to tug/pinch/jerk/shock when your dog is standing there glassy-eyed like she‚Äôs never heard the word ‚Äúsit‚Äù in her life is powerful enough that there is an obvious motive to do it. Whether or not it teaches the dog anything long term, being able to physically take control of a situation and make her do what you asked her to do is a powerful reward for the human. 

* All trainers insist that their correction of choice (pinch collar, shoulder taps, ear pinches, electric shock, etc.) aren‚Äôt *that* bad and don‚Äôt really hurt the dog. And okay, most dogs do not suffer permanent damage from that type of treatment (although some outliers do). But for any given dog, if your corrections are doing anything at all it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre making the dog uncomfortable enough that they alter their behavior. For some dogs, that takes quite a lot of discomfort. The more you use corrections the more you desensitize your dog to them, so that you will have to continuously increase the intensity to get the same results. 

* Positive reinforcement is mindblowingly successful at teaching most basic commands. If your training goals for your dog are the typical sit/down/come/stay it‚Äôs hard for me to see the use case for e-collars. If you can‚Äôt get your dog doing that stuff for boiled chicken you need to look at your training skills and consistency and maybe work with a pro. But I‚Äôm very skeptical of anyone saying they need an e-collar to teach that kind of Dogging 101 behavior. Meanwhile a whole class of ‚Äúbad dog‚Äù behavior is due to fear and lack of confidence. You can use punishment to get these dogs to outwardly behave better, but it‚Äôs not an effective way to teach them the confidence they are lacking.

None of this to say that all e-collar use is bad and abusive, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the correct choice for most dogs in most situations."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fee2oci,t3_eokvrf,1579025142.0,"I see the point here but there is a real distinction between how you treat someone you‚Äôre dating and someone you‚Äôre in a committed relationship with. Yes in the long run chores, emotional labor, and general ‚Äúgiving‚Äù should be divided equitably within a relationship. But in a long term relationship people hit various periods in their lives when a 50/50 breakdown is not realistic. Injury, illness, grief, career crises, family problems, etc. are going to intrude in one way or another. I don‚Äôt mind picking up the slack for my husband when he‚Äôs sick or has a stressful period at work because we effectively work as a team and he does the same for me when I need it. 

Unforunately women are socialized to be so helpful that LVM can easily exploit the urge to pitch in when we see a way to make someone happy. When a guy who hasn‚Äôt offered any commitment starts moaning about how stressed he is, resist the urge to jump in and take care of his laundry/shopping/meal plan for him. To be able to work as a team both people need to be committed teammates. 

That‚Äôs where I see the ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù come into play. Privileges exist in committed relationships but they are earned. If privileges are taken advantage of they can be revoked.

If you‚Äôve been dating three years and you‚Äôve *never* argued (when stressed, tired, hungry, etc.) my money is on 2). But maybe you are that unicorn couple or two people who both are very very skilled at conflict resolution. In that case there is no reason to fight, you have the skills you need to advocate for your own interests and a partner who‚Äôs respectful of you doing that. 

I think if you have the gut feeling you want to fight though it‚Äôs probably 2). In that case you‚Äôre going to have to do some introspection and maybe even work with a therapist on how to be direct and assertive.

Your girlfriend is abusive. Unless your dog was physically attacking someone there is no justification for this behavior. You should absolutely break up with your girlfriend, not because you care about your dog more but because people who abuse animals are not people you want in your life. 

If for some reason you do not get her out of your home, you need to rehome your dog until she is gone. It is your responsibility to maintain a home for your dog where he is physically safe. 

If you chose to stay with your girlfriend, permanently rehome this dog and do not get more pets or kids."

Well bred, mature border collies who‚Äôve been raised well and who‚Äôs needs are met should be able to relax once ‚Äúwork‚Äù is done. But that‚Äôs a complicated interaction between genetics, environment, and some amount of luck.

dogs,fdplfny,t3_emltls,1578631908.0,"The main thing I think about with border collies (and to a lesser extent other herding breeds) is whether you‚Äôre providing enough mental stimulation for them. Running is good for exercise but it‚Äôs not necessarily going to fulfill a BC‚Äôs interest in doing stuff because it can be pretty mindless. Some BCs do well playing at the dog park but others will try herding dogs or policing play, or are much more interested in interacting with people than with other dogs anyway. 

The best reason to get a dog like a border collie is because there is a specific reason you want a dog with that capacity for learning and engagement‚Äîmaybe you want a dog to do actual work (herding, SAR, etc.) or you want a dog to do dog sports, or you are for some reason really into training and teaching tricks. If you had those types of interests I could see it working with your schedule. And maybe you will end up with a mellower border collie. But you should also consider the scenario of a border collie who is mildly reactive to other dogs (so the dog park and daycares aren‚Äôt gonna work) and uncomfortable being left in a doggy zone while you climb and play soccer, and sensitive and a bit freaked out by all the noises in the city. Not all border collies are like that, but a fair percentage are. How prepared are you to handle those types of behavioral issues? How flexible is your lifestyle? 

If you‚Äôre working with a good breeder they should be able to have this conversation with you too. And bordercollies.org has a discussion board with a ton of insight from very experienced owners."

If you‚Äôre looking at herding dogs, shelties and corgis are good hiking companions without needing constant attention. That said, both can be barkers and might drive your roommate crazy demanding attention. Smaller border collies, Aussies, and Australian cattle dogs fit your size range but are going to need more focused training than it sounds like you‚Äôre really interested in. Mini-Aussies show up in rescue sometimes via often questionable breeders‚Äîdepending on the individual dog this could maybe work for you but barking and reactivity can definitely be issues. 

Outside of herding dogs I‚Äôd look at spaniels and miniature (not toy) poodles. Both can be high strung but if you‚Äôre looking at adults you can probably find more mellow ones. 

Your best bet may be to monitor dogs at local shelters and visit them when a dog in your right size range comes through. Your best bet may be a multigenerational mutt rather than looking by specific breed.

A trainer who‚Äôs recommending a pinch collar as a solution to a puppy ignoring commands is not someone I‚Äôd ever use. 

Your dog is almost certainly going to be a high-energy, high-intensity pup who needs more than a 30 minute morning and evening stroll. This dog might be best suited to life in a household with no kids and a handler who‚Äôs into training and dog sports, but if you work with a behaviorist and are willing to commit to serious daily exercise you might be able to make it work. 

If you do decide to rehome the dog look for herding dog rescues in your area. They will have the experience with this type of wild child dog and be able to place him appropriately. But you‚Äôll be doing the dog a huge favor if you do a behavioral consultation first.
