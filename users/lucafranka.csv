dogs,fezikp2,t1_f4oxtiq,1579457729.0,"How are you doing? I just reread your post from 3 months ago and it made me cry for you and for the memory of how I felt each time I lost a dog. 

I hope you're feeling a little better. Woondering if maybe you have taken the plunge and gotten another dog. I'm sitting here at the moment watching my boy sleep in the sunshine. Wanted to check in on you and let you know you were thought of today."

dogs,f7ctpc6,t3_dvbaba,1573599740.0,"I totally agree. My dog and I have met so many neighbors and their pooches that we would have never known except for walking every day. 

As for the dogs, there's sweet Lucy, wise Trooper, baby Hank and handsome Murray and old lady Gracie. We've also met Mark, Rene, Jim and Mr. Bill who's an older gentlemen that's my version of your french neighbor. He has two cats and he will sometimes wait for Frankie and me to walk by in the morning to share a pet and a kind word.

It's absolutely gorgeous right now where I live with all the fall colors at their peak. I'm very grateful to have the time and physical ability to walk every day and count my blessings!"
