As for ""asking to be an insult"", literally anything with negative effects (such as being handicapped, having a certain disease, or just being autistic) and literally anything that makes you different from the norm (autism also applies here) can and will be used as an insult, and that's never going to change.

As for why something is offensive, well, I don't know about you, but I don't want random strangers to diagnose me with any kind of mental illness or disorder unless they're my therapist, ya get me? Doesn't matter whether it's true or not, it's insulting at its core.
