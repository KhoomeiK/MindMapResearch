Well its been theorized (and i agree) that this shows he does care, he can tell when people like charlie are good and doesnt want to hurt them because he does care and is sympathetic. Well if ilhe was JUST an uncaring hoe, i wouldnt date him, but this shows he just might *date* someone and be faithful because hell care about them alot. Its for these reasons i would if i was a character in HH that worked at the hotel with Charlie, i would definitely try to date Angel, he can be caring and resentful and its only been 2 weeks! Imagine if i had a while to really truly get to know him. The amazing sex would be a plus but me personally, i just want someone who would care. Jesus if only i could plug a computer animation softwhere to my head i could make hours and hours of footage cause im a very creative person."
