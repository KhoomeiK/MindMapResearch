And I'm not sure about your dad but I'm going to assume that you posting on this sub means that he's either going to completely lose it if you explain why or he's just going to deny it all and nothing will come of it.

SAHP,fdh3e8m,t3_elaqe0,1578414522.0,"I've been a SAHP for almost three years now. This was not a deliberate decision we made before having our first, it just kind of... happened. My situation is very different from yours though. 

At the time I wasn't working in the field I went to school for. My husband's family also has a business and the expectation was that he and I would be taking over when his parents retired. So financially we didn't feel stressed, which I am so grateful for but I know that security isn't something most have. 

My husband works similar hours to yours, I have also been the one to handle grocery, p/u - d/o, laundry, cooking etc. We have a very traditional gender normative division of labor. Honestly that can be really frustrating on its own so I hope you're giving yourself plenty of credit for doing all that and working full time, it's no wonder why you're tired. 

I definitely felt as though I lost a part of myself. However I feel like I gained a much deeper understanding of who I am and what I want from myself by being at home. After just having our second I definitely feel like I've had to put things on hold but this time I feel much more secure knowing that when it's time for me again I at least know where to start. 

I have yet to meet a single person who does not hold guilt regarding staying home or not staying home with their kids. I feel guilty for not being a role model of female independence and empowerment that I preach to my son's. Whatever you decide I just reccommend talking out all the specifics with your husband about who will do what. 

Make the best decision for your family and tell anyone who criticizes that decision to shove it."

Those two mornings are wonderful for our entire family! My oldest has a life outside of our home which is hard for me to offer him with the baby. He has friends, social interactions with adults, a nice routine and play opportunities he wouldn't otherwise have at home. It allows my youngest to have some one on one time with me and then when he naps it allows me time to catch up around the house. It has been one of the best decisions for our family, I don't regret a thing. 

If preschool is within your budget I highly recommend it, but you do need to find a place that has a program that suits your family and your ideas on what education looks like at 3 years old. Stay at home parenting is going to look different for every family!"

MadeMeSmile,fcirr60,t1_fcimjws,1577668267.0,"You know what, fine, I'll engage. 

First of all this isn't about you and your personal experience. If you found success going limited contact with your family because they are unaccepting of your sexual orientation good for you. For some that isn't a possibility. Some people are emotionally and physically abused by their families for things they have no ability to change. To those people I say go for it, trim the fat. The family you choose is the one that chooses you back. 

Second, when we have experienced struggles there are two directions we can choose from. Say fuck it, I struggled so everyone else should too. Or say, fuck that, I struggled and I don't want others to experience that hardship. 

And lastly anyone who preaches tolerance but spews hatred does not deserve to decide what happens to others. Actions ALWAYS speak louder than words.

But it seems like they are roughly the same size as other prefolds so I'm going to assume it's the thickness that's the issue and not the dimensions of the insert. Sometimes when you have the snaps for the rise all the way up for those little tushes the inserts don't fit as well. Unless you're using the Apple Cheeks inserts because LO is soaking though quickly you should be able to use a less absorbent/thinner insert and get away with changing more frequently.

Some people gain immense satisfaction being at home with children, others from full time work and some people enjoy something somewhere in the middle. You get to decide what's best for you.
