fatlogic,fenawxy,t3_eq1ksj,1579280769.0,"Last week I posted a rave about my skin removal surgery having gone well. This week, I've got a rant.

Seriously, FUCK abdominal drains. Stepped out of the shower on Wednesday and one of them leaked heavily down my leg. I continued to have leak problems since then, making me feel gross and like moving around is a risk. The doctor basically said ""it's normal"" when I called about it and left it at that. There was no way to position things so that something to catch the drain leakage would stay without causing the leak to be worse. Plus, where they were inserted hurt a lot of the week. 

Finally got them removed today and feel like I'm pretty much smooth sailing now. Doc said my sutures are healing well so I'm overall happy. Felt absolutely disgusting to have the drains removed, for what it's worth. Felt it all the way up next to my belly button, and it still feels weird about two hours later."

vegancheesemaking,fe9oyuh,t1_fe9jlj8,1578940162.0,"I mean, I also interpreted the title to mean that there was something not vegan about the soy ricotta. Because of the second half of the sentence referring to the ricotta recipe as the subject, I thought that was the subject of the whole sentence and was pretty confused about it being posted here. Came to the comments and saw it was vegan so hey no worries to me. You seem kind of smug and self righteous with your name calling and declaration that the title couldn't be misunderstood. Please understand that not everyone thinks or interprets the same as you, and sometimes that is just because of a difference in language parsing, not inherent ill will or incorrectness."

PlasticSurgery,fe35gjc,t3_enkevh,1578846109.0,"Best thing to do if you are scared is get a consultation first. I just had abdominoplasty and breast lift done last week after losing 120lbs, and I already know I will be happier with how my body looks by far. The biggest risk factors are age, smoking, and remaining overweight. You're younger than I am (26), and my doc was very positive about my outlook being good to have no complications, so if you don't have the other two risk factors I'd say you're likely to be okay. Talking to a plastic surgeon about concerns is likely to ease your mind, as they are very realistic about probabilities (they don't want to take on risky surgeries overall)."
fatlogic,fe2kwr7,t1_fe0e4sw,1578839680.0,"Honestly I wouldn't trust a plastic surgeon that treated me like that with doing the procedure. I recently had plastic surgery to address loose skin on my breasts and abdomen, and the first doctor I went to for a consultation treated me in a similar fashion to the story. Rather than explaining anything before asking me to get undressed, he had me immediately change into a gown, and then the first thing he said when I opened the gown was ""odd shaped chest"". I don't know what the hell he wanted me to say in response, but I was not happy. 

The second doctor I went to had a separate room to talk first, he explained everything to me, then I went to another room for the exam. He expressed a similar concern about my chest, which was more like he was afraid I wouldn't be happy with how they looked without augmentation, but he also didn't pressure me about it when I insisted I just wanted a lift. I went with this doctor, because I overall felt much more respected in his office. He also doesn't post pictures of before and afters online, though he does take them (on day of surgery, unlike the first doctor that took some at my consultation), which feels like another layer of respect. And they respected me for as long as I was awake on the day of the procedure, as well, keeping me informed as to what they were doing. 

So, basically, if a plastic surgeon doesn't treat you as you'd like in the consultation, definitely do not go back to them for your procedure, because that is likely how they will treat you the whole time."
vegangifrecipes,fe2ice9,t1_fe2grb0,1578838655.0,"Jackfruit when used like this refers to canned green jackfruit in brine or water, and is pretty widely available year round. I know near me, Martin's carries it, and I can find it at international or Asian markets reliably. Also available to order online, but availability could depend on where you live."

It's tough, decent amount of pain, but I finally got to see today and my stomach doesn't have a fold in the middle like it used to. My boobs look great, too, even though they're still all bloody. I am so happy to actually see the progress I made more plainly."

vegancirclejerk,fc985uv,t1_fc97ogs,1577548566.0,"Generally they are similar on food options, but vegans also try to stay away from consuming animal products in the rest of their life (bath stuff, cars, clothes, etc.), and plant based dieters will do as the person in the post did sometimes, because it is a ""diet"", not how they choose to live their life (this is a generalization, you can be vegan and plant based meaning you don't eat much/any vegan junk food, but this is a simplification of the differences between the two)."

My MIL invited us for a dinner of beyond brats and frozen french fries, then right before dinner asked my husband if the buns she bought specifically to accommodate us were vegan. He told her to look at the package, and she saw they had milk in them. 

Kind of ruined Christmas a bit. She bought us both a vegan rep item (a shirt and a necklace), and then immediately demonstrated that she doesn't actually understand after over two years of trying to explain and show her why we do what we do."
