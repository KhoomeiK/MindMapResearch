Yes. Yes it is. The apps have many voices to choose from and different accents. The web version I'm less familiar with but there should be a setting for it."

recruitinghell,fc9tinc,t1_fc9sjwy,1577557998.0,I was talking about the pay rate may be different based on field. But unpaid internships are out there too. I've been working professionally for about 6 years but when I was looking at internships one that I remember seeing as unpaid was with the USPS. I work in marketing and at that time the pay rate was around $15/hr for marketing interns in my area.

Many people in their 20s stopped giving a shit about appearances after high school. The whole respect for boundaries and sexual exploration is also common with ""younger"" people now too."

When they realized it had a warranty, they got a replacement part but thought it was wrong. After 3 more replacement parts I looked at it and determined the original was the correct but they were trying to plug the wires together rather than eliminate 1 wire as required.

Additionally the seal has been moldy for the last several years. Even if they bleach it, the mold comes back. Horrible design overall."
