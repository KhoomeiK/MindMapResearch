worldnews,ff9lfyu,t1_ff9aocy,1579715478.0,"Haha thanks. I didnt really believe it, but wasnt going to argue a specific like that."
worldnews,ff847ob,t1_ff71jyv,1579665545.0,"No it is a fact that in 2016 russia interfered in the election through a disinformation campaign and actual hacks, like the DNC server. 

They wouldn't do that unless it benefited them. Therefore they believe meddling in the election helps Russias stance on the world stage."
worldnews,ff83gx4,t1_ff6yzvf,1579664982.0,"Wow. Is it really only 10k? That's rather shocking. However that doesnt equate to all the money they put into it. Ads are one thing, paying trolls to impersonate americans on Facebook is another."
worldnews,ff83bpe,t1_ff7w3kf,1579664874.0,"No I do know what I'm talking about. Most my comment was trying to explain that hacking an election wouldnt really be risky, or that far out of the normal behavior. I was giving an example of the Russiam capabilities. As well as as giving an example of how even the US and UK have hacked and attacked an ally. Ofcourse the issue is more complex than can fit in a reddit comment, but I chose two examples that showed the ability af the Russians as well as how even the US doesnt draw lines in the sand on who could be a target. 

And yes I do think it is important to point out what both sides are doing. It doesn't have to be ""I choose to only talk about the bad things Russia has done"". 

How about instead of picking at my one comment, you offer a counter argument, or correct my own?"
worldnews,ff6yfjj,t1_ff6l1a6,1579637462.0,Why else would they have done it in the past if they didnt think it would help russia?

worldnews,ff6gwqx,t1_ff6dkkt,1579626946.0,"Russia thinks they can benefit from swaying the election. So let me ask you this, with all the money and effort they put into disinformation campaigns why wouldnt they do the same for cyber? They do. 

They have strong cyber capabilities. Look up Notpetya and how it effected Maersk Shipping. Worldwide shipping stopped for them, this includes food, medical supplies, ect. 
Now Maersk was NOT the target but got hit anyways because they did business in Ukraine. 
Point being: there are no lines in cyber.

You could even take a look at Operation Socialist. This allegedly (Snowden leaks and Belgian prime minister all but confirmed it) was an attack by the NSA, GCHQ (UK spy agency specializing on crypto), and possibly Israel agaisnt Belgian's largest  internet service provider. This allowed the agencies to spy on Belgian Politicians and very likely foreign embassies. 

Again, point being, as of now nothing is off limits in cyber as long as it doesnt cost loss of life."

coolguides,feywaez,t1_feyuns1,1579451263.0,I was taught the opposite. Heaviest weight at the bottom where the hip straps are. That way your hips take most the weight not your back. And you're more stable

worldnews,fep3ypf,t1_fep2r93,1579311602.0,No it was diplomatic immunity recognized by the UK. A lot of cases with Saudis citizens dont have diplomatic immunity but leave/escape anyways.
worldnews,feov7t6,t1_feot9ub,1579306140.0,"See that's where you are wrong. She did have diplomatic immunity, you should read up on it. The uk asked the us to waive it and the us said no.

Your computer should be fine air cooled. Also if your planning on moving, air cooled would be better. For liquid cooles systems it can be risky moving those long distances without draining the liquid. You could also get a non-custom liquid cooler. Corsair has some that are a closed system and easy to install. 

I've heard of the custom liquid coolers leaking fairly frequently, especially on custom systems that have a lot of joints/connections."
