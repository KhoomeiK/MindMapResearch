Empaths,fe53m2x,t3_entf1k,1578865373.0,i experience this too!! music changes my mood so easily. i can‚Äôt tell u how many times i‚Äôve cried listening to music because i can feel the pain in it or i connect my own pain to it. i just get so lost in it that i can be alone not doing anything and just listening to music for hours

Anxietyhelp,fc4qwqu,t3_eg6cs9,1577425163.0,this is really calming and actually worked for me. i was feeling stressed but i just turned this on and my head cleared. i‚Äôve tried to find music like this but i never really like the ones i find; this one is great. thanks for sharing
depression,fc4qlee,t1_fc4powq,1577424847.0,i get study stress from school but i‚Äôm on a break right now. i get sad pretty easily. i get really sad after someone leaves and we were hanging out. i get sad thinking about my future. i get sad randomly when i start filling my head with bad thoughts connected to my friends and family
helpme,fbzqcsb,t3_ef8nni,1577256278.0,wanna switch; before i kept holding it in and barely cried and now i cry like everyday and it sucks.
