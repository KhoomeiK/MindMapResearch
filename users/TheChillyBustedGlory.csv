Opening up the page, you find a small photo album of your life. On the next page is a picture of an ancestral home. A depiction of a fight, outside it. On the next page is a black swirl, emanating liquid with one word: Get the paint.

On the next page is various color meanings and shape meanings.

德: Mind
Λ: Liberty
П: Progress
γ : Earth
Red: Reverse
Blue: Forwards
Green: Vital, Good
Purple: Decrepit, Bad

You decide to draw a Red 德, and a Green Λ. The swirl absorbs them.
A Red γ, a Green γ. The swirl absorbs them. 

Society clearly starts to change. With all the changes, you forget the shocking parts of what is in the book."
