Hvis det er rigtigt så vil jeg hellere bruge ASK først til 17% skat, men måske har jeg misforstået noget fradrag eller lign."

Which part do you have trouble believing? Latest conspiracy was mass surveilance that was a conspiracy theory until Snowden. There's backdoors built into hardware still and the government monitors your phone. There's a reason TikTok is banned from members of US military because China uses it to spy.

Read some of that.

Now, do you also need evidence the government is inefficient or what?"

3-4 hours I think from Atlanta.

> If you flew, what was your method of traveling with your trekking poles? I was thinking of bringing a cardboard box to put them in and check them.

I had mine as carry on from Denmark and again on a domestic flight. No issue. They're carbon fiber so the scanner didn't register them, I think. On another trip I also had to fly international and I bought a plastic tube in a hardware store and sealed it with duct tape once the poles were inside along with my friend's poles that were aluminum.

> My very, very generous dad bought me an Arc'teryx rain jacket for Christmas ( I was shocked).. should I risk taking it on the thru or buy froggtoggs that I won't care about getting destroyed?

Can't really answer that. I'd bring it if it was mine.
