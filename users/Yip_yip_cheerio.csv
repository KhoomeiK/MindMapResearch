..I saw an article recently discussing the possibility of a connection between BV and recurring UTIs. It's something I'm currently looking into.

Have you been tested for BV? One of the articles I've come across discussed BV confirmation through an ammonia test that produces a fishy smell. The results are the same as when you wash with soap and it creates the same odor.

I've considered the possibility that HPV effects vaginal flora and causes an imbalance leading to BV, and undiagnosed BV causes my recurring UTIs. 

I could be completely off base, these are simply my own thoughts and I welcome evidence challenging my theory :)"

I think the phrase ""looking for attention"" is misconstrued. It reminds me of a moment in my teen years when my self harm was at it's peak and I saw my therapist's notes stating the wound was ""superficial"". Now, in laymen terms that would mean something completely different from medical terminology. She was saying that once she saw it, it didn't need stitches or medical attention. I was offended lol it was deep enough that I had to duct tape it closed. She saw it well after it had healed to a ""superficial"" or surface wound.

 I wasn't ""looking for attention"" for the sake of attention, but when I showed it to her, it was for attention. At the time, I had no idea what kind of attention I wanted, maybe just acknowledgent of my pain? I wanted the internal pain or mental anguish to stop and self harm was a physical manifestation of it. I was asking for help recognizing what caused my pain and led to self harming behaviors.

I see suicidal statements in the same light. They are asking for attention in some way, perhaps they need their mental anguish acknowledged? Those who are on the edge staring into the abyss ready to jump have reached a point where their pain overwhelms their coping skills. It's an old debate, at what point has someone endured enough to say that death becomes a merciful act?

It feels as if civilization itself were on the brink, and that we lack the collective willpower and coordination necessary to address issues of vital importance to the very survival of our species.

It doesn't have to be this way.""

sex,fdp8hjd,t1_fdomw82,1578622471.0,"This. I've raised my kids this way as well. They have questions, we discuss it. I'd rather they feel comfortable coming to me and finding the answer through a book or search engine together, rather than receive misinformation or no information.
My pre-teen called me on my way home today to let me know his pubescent brothers were asking Alexa what sex means. So, I grabbed my copy of Facts of Life (pop ups and all) and started the discussion. We discussed puberty, reproduction, pornography (don't google sex, kids), the importance of hygiene (how many men wish someone had told them how to clean under their foreskin?), and masturbation. Then I put the book back on the shelf and told them that it would be there if they wanted to know about sex but were uncomfortable hearing it from me. 

Now, I didn't go into depth on all of those topics. Kids should know that if they are washing and it feels good, that's normal. If they had further questions, I would offer them a different book to explain masturbation. I believe that sometimes, creating a safe place to talk means having resources available to respect the private aspects of the subject. Not all kids will feel comfortable discussing sex with their parent, but they should be able to talk to a safe adult about where or how to find answers.

I'm glad the gurl book Deal With It came out when I was going through it all because my parents couldn't even be bothered to hug us, let alone talk to us about important subjects like sex or even menstruation.  If anyone knows of a good puberty book for males I'd appreciate it :)"

I've been crocheting for years but the magic circle and that technique solved so many of my problems early on"
dysautonomia,fdb194b,t3_eka5hq,1578252599.0,"There was an FB page that discussed this many years ago. One of the tasks that stood out to me was the dog would help with laundry. Lots of bending and stooping style tasks. 

You could be approved for an emotional support animal and train it to do more. Unfortunately, an ESA can't go into public places, if you're looking for a full time working dog. However, in some states, you can self-train a service dog and an ESA can be classified as a service dog in training. The important thing is to have documentation from a doctor that states you have a need for a service dog. They don't have to certify or know the dog themselves. You are responsible for anything that happens in public (dog bites, jumping, barking) and can be asked to leave if the dog is not well behaved.

I helped my sister with NCS rescue a dog. After a couple years, these two were so well bonded that her dog was able to alert her when she needed to lay down, among other unique tasks.

My dog was in training. He was well attuned to me and would alert me related to PTSD triggers. He could sense my anxiety, and that helped prevent some of the adrenaline spikes which exacerbated my POTs symptoms."

Sometimes they will choose someone unavailable because they're unavailable themselves. I've learned to make myself less available to those who become unavailable to me. It's helped in some parts of my recovery, and hurt in others.

I hope you feel better because you deserve better 💗"
