facepalm,ffbi63q,t1_ffawi78,1579766417.0,"The facepalm is that 69% of people who were asked, didn't know what Arabic numerals were. 

Something they were absolutely taught in school and have been using their while life.

It can also be said that, maybe most of those people were so blinded by racism that they said no to Arabic numerals."
facepalm,ffbhwit,t3_esc0vw,1579766062.0,"For a bit, I couldn't tell if this video was supposed to be serious or not. I mean, not like if it's fake or real, but if the person making the video is actually against energy drinks and is trying to be taken seriously and claiming that energy drinks are bad.

Up until the hammer. I then knew that this was satire. Then the damn bread. What would heating up bread with a light do? Why is that a necessary part? 

Would it not work without the light? If that's the case, then it's obviously the light that's causing the bread to made of foam, right?

How can someone watch this and believe any of it?"

gifs,ff5ncbj,t1_fem2wty,1579601550.0,"So I know this is late as hell as I'm scrolling through top of the week, but just in case you didn't know.

Hatchet is book 1 in a 5 book series. Well, kinda 4.

Book 3 is an alternate ending to book 1 so it takes the place of book 2. 

So if you go by the order in which they are referenced in the series, it's book 1, then 3, then 2 then 4 and 5.

Book 3 was ""what if Brian was never rescued and had to endure the winter""?

The author wrote book 3 after he got a bunch of emails asking that ""what if"". So he decided to write it."

Some states in the U.S. require a written 2 week notice or you forfeit your last paycheck.

Then there are others (Washington for example) where you are not required to at all and can just up and quit whenever you feel like it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fem5976,t1_fel5cts,1579240219.0,"Yup. My medical was ended when I got a job that paid a bit more and while waiting until the companies medical kicked in, I had to buy things out of pocket.

One of the medications that I have to take daily cost $500 for a months supply out of pocket. With good RX, they take it down to $20 to $30 depending on where it is filled.  

Still double from what my last insurance had me pay, but way better than $500."
AskReddit,fejphbj,t1_fej7w5w,1579182473.0,"Yup. I don't read 5 star or 1 star reviews. I look at 2-4 to figure out if the product is good or not.

Typically, a 4 star review will outline all the good qualities and also explain what could be changed to make it a 5 star product."
facepalm,feizxlw,t1_feiveie,1579152039.0,Behind the curve. It's interesting but very frustrating to watch. Get ready for an hour and a half of cringing.
interestingasfuck,fdwbxyv,t1_fdw77rm,1578757153.0,"That is an absolutely terrible idea. 

If you poison the boars, then you poison what ever decides to eat the boars when they die. Humans, wolves, bears, ECT. 

You will do more harm to the eco system. Including the water, as the boars might die in rivers and lakes, killing fish and other animals that drink from it."
interestingasfuck,fdug9w7,t1_fdt9ysm,1578732527.0,"Yeah, whenever boar hunting gets brought up, a lot of people go nuts with the fact that we shouldn't be killing a super invasive species that is killing livestock, destroying farms, killing people and children, destroying property and killing native wildlife at an alarming rate.

Boars are such a problem, that many states have almost no laws regarding hunting them. There is no limit, no weapon/caliber limit, no season, ECT.

You can literally rent a helicopter and mow them down with a gatling gun if you wanted. 

They are that much of a problem and yet, so many people say we should just leave it to nature and not kill them."
IdiotsInCars,fdtpvhs,t1_fdt8l04,1578720361.0,"Pierce county in Washington just got rid of their emissions testing. We are below our projected emissions and it was supposed to end in a few years anyways. Honestly, being broke and having to buy a crap car off Craigslist that more than wouldn't have passed emissions anyways, I was relieved. I really didn't have the money to fix it and there isn't any public transportation for 2 miles where I live. It was my only option if I wanted to keep my job."

Would I need to make sure it's not facing a window in my kitchen?"
