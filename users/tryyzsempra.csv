Give me their name and location. I'll bring my own knife.



No more messages after that."

todayilearned,fd2rg2w,t3_ejwxed,1578150897.0,"I am in the same industry as my dad (software). My career in software was, I think, less influenced by him and more by my appreciation for video games and math (sadly I don't make video games). I only saw bits and pieces of what he did while I grew up and was never really invited to check it out until I was older.

My son and I play games, maybe a little too much, and he loves to watch me program either work or random things. He often wants me to teach him how to program so I try to find little tutorials and Scratch IDEs to guide him.

I found a game that makes you develop your own AI for your characters. He loves to watch me work on it and can't wait to get his own computer so he can make it too.

Edit: the game I play is called AdventureLand on Steam. It's JavaScript so still too advanced for him right now."
LifeProTips,fa7lyfp,t3_e7qsyl,1575835961.0,"I had a professor give a syllabus with dates of work and tests. The class before a test was something like ""in-class review, Q&A"".

It turned out to be a slideshow of a trip he took many years earlier.

Second test, about 1/3 of the class skipped that session to actually study instead of watching another vacation. He moved the test up to that day and a third of the class got a zero.

We brought it to the dean and he gave no fucks. 1/3 of the class were at instant C since the tests were each 25%."
