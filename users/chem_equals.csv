We're all learning from each other and we all are human and make mistakes but we desperately need to reach that common ground which we do have,  and i think regardless of the conflagration of debate this devolved into regardless of fault,  I think it's important we've reached this point and I will respectfully bow and thank you for the opportunity to learn a new perspective so I may reflect and consider my own and other options and opinions.

I feel we're in agreement here and tptb prefer us to squabble and focus on the differences in option rather than realize we're on the same team with the same moral code and ethics and our frustration of the current state of affairs which digestive us to argue and not reach a cohesive compromise which is my goal here please don't misconstrue. 

We can reach a comin middle ground and find a solution,  we have in common that we're are American,  we're both love our country and wish to for everyone to be both safe and have the ability and freedom to protect themselves by any means necessary,  which is a tricky dilemma as you can't have both complete security and complete freedom at the same time,  you have to find a perfect balance which im ultimately interested in finding that solution,  hopefully together. 

This is a heated, emotionally charged issue and we both agree that it desperately needs rapid attention to save the lives of our countrymen. 

We are not enemies,  we have the same goal in mind,  we're just trying to figure out how to reach that goal and it's not going to be simple or black and white.

They were telling everyone they need to destroy or turn in all their guns which imo is absurd and pandering to emotion which is not a good approach when trying to rationally discuss a controversial issue that is in no way black and white. 

The point being that the second amendment is mainly in place so as to protect against an ever encroaching tyrannical government, which history has shown time and again that if you take away peoples right to defend themselves legally,  what follows is typically of an oppressive nature and many times led to mass genocide which sure you can call anyone paranoid but if you were in a situation such as that,  In the moment you'd prefer to be prepared to defend yourself and the ones you love.  

Is that really what you're arguing against,  the ability to protect yourself? 
Give it up,  lay down and bootlick, give up your guns and the ability to defend yourself with force, I will not because im what is considered a true patriot,  and i will fight and die to protect mine and your right to the freedom to defend against an oppressive regime bent on power and control.

Have you not noticed the rapid decline in our country with more and more of our rights and freedoms traded for this false sense of security? The oppressive reach of the police state continuing to snowball out of control until we now have a militarized police force which it's basically a standing army which it's also unconstitutional. 
I advocate for stricter laws preventing guns to fall in the wrong hands absolutely what rational responsible citizen wouldn't? But here's the thing,  criminals don't follow fucking laws... so all you're arguing against is to take guns from law abiding citizens, do you really think that will solve the problem?
Its a much deeper issue and has many elements to consider and investigate instead of just saying ""get rid of all guns""

Also im sure you're familiar with historical events,  here's some refreshers:

1911: Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Christian Armenians rounded up and exterminated.

1929: The Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929-1953, 20 million dissidents rounded up and murdered.

1935: China established gun control. From 1948-1952, 20 million political dissidents rounded up and exterminated.


1938: Germany established gun control. From 1939-1945, 13 million Jews and others rounded up and exterminated.

1956: Cambodia established gun control. From 1975-1977, 1 million educated people rounded up and exterminated.

1964: Guatemala established gun control. From 1981-1984, 100,000 Mayan Indians rounded up and exterminated.

1970: Uganda established gun control. From 1971-1979, 300,000 Christians rounded up and exterminated.

Also not sure if you're familiar of the Bundy Massacre... 

Really it's a matter of common sense.  If you're afraid of me having a gun,  that's your problem,  your fear to deal with,  not mine and certainly not your right to limit my right to defend myself just because it makes you ""feel"" a certain way

Also id like to add,  if you aren't American,  you have absolutely no say in the matter and any opinion you have would be completely irrelevant due to the fact you likely aren't educated on the topic apart from it being none of your fucking business anyway. But people love to point their finger and virtue signal on the internet for points,  but when it comes to rational,  civil discourse and debate that relies on facts and not emotion, everyone on reddit seems to act like a bunch of fucking children with zero chance for any kind of reasonable compromise or middle ground.  It's ridiculous.
