snackexchange,feji9oi,t1_feizc2q,1579175451.0,"Same here. I've literally just spent 15 minutes looking around for some lebkuchen, after seeing the picture. 
It seems impossible to find an online store that is selling them. I love them."
aww,fejd0ha,t1_feit5e7,1579167933.0,"First Schnoodle of the year for me. Soft, Sweet with a melancholic aftertaste. It seems 2020 will be an excellent year."
aww,fejcpzb,t1_feixh0e,1579167492.0,"There you go. 1 month to St. Valentine's and with no effort whatsoever from you, you already have a perfect gift. I don't think it's fair!"
italianlearning,fejc2h5,t3_epdhil,1579166498.0,"The message you want to convey is beautiful, but it's definitely not a good idea for a tattoo in Italian. 

Besides the insult argument, which is particularly true for some areas of Italy, the message you seem to convey is of doom and desperation, like ""when everything is lost, you kill yourself"".

It sounds more like a suicidal thought and, at least in Italian, doesn't represent appropriately the message of hope, strength and self-reliance you're looking for.

P.S. have you thought about Latin? Latin is full of beautiful idioms about courage and so on. Lots of people do it and maybe it would be easier for you to look for Latin idioms than for Italian ones, as an English speaker."

coolguides,fdqxg53,t1_fdqo3fc,1578676193.0,"Yep. The cost for the ""project"" has been roughly estimated in 3 billion, which more or less lines up with this chart."
careerguidance,fdqvln3,t3_emowep,1578675547.0,"It seems people here are giving you very good advices so I'll just add my 2 cents. If your bosses are good bosses, they'll understand. You're just starting your career and they know these are the rules of the game."
OneNote,fdq5bez,t3_emmkpb,1578655516.0,"It's just the way the audio recording works. I think ON generates a play button every time you lay down your pen on the screen, or something similar. Like: two letters? Two play buttons.
  
Not particularly elegant and kind of annoying, to be honest. A solution à la Notability would be more user friendly."

EDIT: Ok, nevermind. I just saw the price on the artist's website. Well worth the money, to be honest. But not for a student. Beautiful watercolor though."

ipad,fddj9rq,t1_fdcq25r,1578314497.0,"I've been using the AP on a matte screen protector for a year now, writing everyday a lot, for uni. I still have the original tip, and it looks just fine. 

The fact is that, at least in my experience, Apple Pencil is similar to a fountain pen: you just let it glide over the paper and it writes with absolutely no pressure. If you need line variation, then a tiny pressure will be enough.

It’s not the way we're used to write anymore and it takes time to get accustomed to it."
interestingasfuck,fcliggi,t3_ehksln,1577748548.0,Did the army bought some of this things from Gravity or what? I remember watching the company's founder on YouTube years ago. He was basically inspired by Iron Man movies.

I mean, every US recipe I watch on YT or here leaves me always amazed by the amount of cheese used. 

That said, cheese is life."

Also, when I was a kid I read a book titled ” the society of the murderous cats”, so I can see your point. Thank you dogs, for keeping us safe."

MadeMeSmile,fbu9m5o,t1_fbu0npz,1577110422.0,"Maybe you've already seen it, but there's a documentary on it, exploring how people with dementia seem to never forget the music they love and why. I may be wrong, but I think it’s on YouTube too. Very touching.

EDIT: thank you guys, it indeed was Music and Memory. I watched it on TV years ago for the first time and I’ve never forget it. And a big thanks for all your stories."
