Take your time. This is a commitment you make for the long term, not for the short ""I will try it"" term. All about the initial mindset, that goes long way.

Regarding experience, this is not a magic pill as the change happens so slow you barely notice it, but looking back 90, even 100 days from now, I see it clearly.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff7w7po,t1_ff7veyr,1579659826.0,"Cold exposure (in a proper way) is healthy for the immune system and triggers some body processes that work to keep the body warm, in turn train the body like a muscle to fight autoimmune problems.

For reference you can look up ""Wim Hof"" and his school, he does some crazy things and teaches other to achieve the exact same results. There is also a book written about him by a known writer called ""What doesnt kill us"" by Scott Carney which goes a little deeper into the subject.

I did the Wim Hof program for 10 weeks, swam in the ocean during February- march at 1-2am in the mid-east coast winter in 2016, haven't been sick once, lost weight, had far better sleep than before (I was a college student and sleep was an issue), and felt generally more energetic through the day. It involves a little bit of Yoga, breathing exercises and a lot of cold water exposure.

Also, the guy discuss it in his book, brown fat processes which are healthy are activated hyper during cold exposure when you refuse to shiver. That is one of the ways it help a little with weight loss if you are on a diet, but the auto immune system benefits are the main goal of these programs.

The religious guy in the picture is just doing something very popular in eastern Russia called ""Zakalenya"" which means conditioning to the extreme cold and became popular to a point they merged it with religion. This basically involves exposing to ice cold water in a somewhat-controlled environment. They do it a lot in the sauna when they heat up very well, and then run out to lay in the snow before coming back into the steamer, and in the picture, they will warm the kid up after the exposure, they do it short enough to prevent hypothermia."

Yeah, you read that right. First, I want to tell you the bad news - there is no magic pill, there are no tricks and tips and methods that will eliminate the one and only ingredient for self discipline which is will power. Forget about motivation, forget about inspiration, these are two things that make people money and are distributed in small amounts to make you come back and buy more. The truth is, you are in a box of comfort, comfort which you hate because that box sucks. That box is comfortable but it is tiny, dark and lonely. You stick your head out of that box and see fucking tornadoes, avalanches, chaos pain suffering you name it, and you stick your head right back into that box because it is still comfortable. You keep complaining but deep down inside you know very well that you feel somewhat safe, like you don't have the responsibility or the capacity for anything greater and you choose to continue with the lesser but longer suffering.

Here are the good news - you've been picking at the road to success all this time. That chaos outside of your box, that is a necessary evil. That is the road to greatness. The road to healthy and fit body, the road to great income, the road to amazing relationships,  the road to achievement and glory. 

There is no magic unicorn that will take you there friend, you are all you got. Step by step get out there. Go through the pain. Suffer your way up. You are not only capable, you are in self denial.

Stop masturbating to porn (the most helpful thing you will ever do after a few months), wake up earlier and do the Wim Hof Method (cold therapy), start meditating before bed, create a morning and a night ritual and practice it EVERY SINGLE DAY. Push and grind and push some more, and I promise you, a year from now, you will look back and thank yourself.

My point is from my personal experience with the matter combined with the observation with current mainstream society which the majority of are afraid to confront anything, whether it is a challange, a bully, a change in life, a family member, a problem etc.

I'm not saying fighting specifically is the mature part, I'm saying it is mature that they owned their decision and did it maturely (ended the conflict with a hug licking their wounds). In other examples situations like these end up in shootings, stabbings and what not. That doesn't cultivate anything. Atleast they cultivated their bond and I bet it is stronger than before.

Then, now, and at all times people had to maintain tactful awareness in order to survive and live prosperous. But today society actively pushes against confrontation and teaches young men that struggle is bad. It is proven over and over again that struggle is good. You can't get rid if bullying, and confrontations in the real world as one will encounter it everywhere whether it is family, work, social circle etc. Humans always eye eachother out and each group automatically filters weaker and stronger individuals by behavior and shit testing, the same way you filter a person you meet whether they are emotionally resilient or weak, by joking or teasing or whatever it is, and based on that you are attracted to hang out with said people. I.e ""no one wants to invite Steve to the party because steve tends to be insulted over everything, and steve is also a vegan."".

It doesn't mean fighting is always the answer, but sometimes in the male environment it is far healthier to fight it out and then strengthen the bond by hugging it out, than try to be civil, end confrontations with words that lead to endless grudges and harsh feelings. We dont know why these dudes were fighting, but seeing them being mature at the end and just leave it the way it is, without ""harsh feelings"" (assuming they did) is the opposite of immaturity."

People keep looking them up and consuming them, and more often than not they do nothing. Your ability to control yourself is the backbone to everything you do in life, from restraining emotions to your grind to success, you have to train it.

Willpower is like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it becomes. The whole ""do the first step and focus on that"" is all nice and games, but only as long as the willpower is there. So the best advice in my opinion, is learn how to force yourself directly.

Being expressive as a man has the opposite effect of what people thought it will have. Many stigmas are biologically wired and not socially constructed. There is a reason men tend to feel bad when they feel weak, nothing to do with social perception but rather with their instinctive need to be strong. Competition is a wired trait, males of the majority of species compete all the time, and we humans never evolved past it. You supress the need for competition in your own life, you will compete elsewhere, say videogames for example.

Just like you said, masculinity is considered ""toxic"" and men become weaker due to that and tend to suffer. Females are more expressive than males yet there are more female suicide attempts than male."

NoFap,fdo3nn7,t1_fdo1xj9,1578598296.0,"Well, the mindset thing is very complicated in males. I'm not mentioning females because I never was one so I cant give specifics, but in the males head, any concern and I mean ANY concern creates a physiological effect. Realistically, we all have some insecurities and we all have different experiences, but ideally sex would be in a form of a controlled meditation, you let thoughts flow but when they do you clear your head.
Males are most often dominant and females are submissive, and that is expressed by the things males and females enjoy in bed. Many times men are too anxious to try things, and tend to request too many permissions for example. These things can be avoided by adding a little confidence to try new things and be okay with hearing ""no"". A lot of men are scared of that word for some reason. Anyway this is where breathing comes in. My advice would be to become confident to try things without the impulse to investigate in advance. I.e, if you are having sex and want to pull her hair, try it. Dont harm her or be a dick, but don't be a pup and ask everything. Be a bit more dominant and your attitude will grow your confidence. In the same time control the breath, while thrusting make sure you breath heavy and slower than you are f*cking. No matter the speed and intensity, try focusing on breathing g deeply and slowly. It doesnt have to be awkward, but this little habbit goes long way with results. Breathing deeply and slowly calms your nervous system and helps your heart circulate blood better. Over time, it helps maintaining erection and kill the nervousness many men feel. Elliott Husle always says ""Breath down to your balls"". Over time this also helps with sexual anxiety and helps the body calm down.

Physiology is a very complex subject. For reference your muscles and body posture are directly connected to your feelings and mental well being. Some people experience social anxiety or fear of speaking in public because they have areas in their chest that are too tight, most likely due to trauma. The way you control your body, i.e beath, can directly influence your mental well being and that goes the other way around.

For example, your mental well being can harm the way your body circulates blood during sexual arousal and sexual stimulation will be much harder to control. Having a thought of PE during sex? That can be the reason for your PE. Keep that in mind.

If you are concerned, you can also check your blood, might be Estrogen or T problems too but if you're in your 20's or 30's and are generally healthy it is very not likely."
NoFap,fdnxgh0,t3_emdb8d,1578594821.0,"It depends. Usually PE has the majority to do with psychology *IF* there is no physical problem. Physical problems are most commonly T related, sometimes other things, but if a person is young and is not extremely overweight and not showing signs of depression, it is most likely a psychological problem that builds itself. 

Important to note that psychological problems directly create physiological problems. I.e being nervous or uncomfortable often makes males breath wrong and as a result of improper breathing PE. Had a trainee buddy who suffered from PE for a while, and breathing excercises and a mind shift about sex and sexuality made him extremely resilient to a point he sometimes holds too long. 

If you are experiencing that, it is very less likely to be due to porn but due to the psychological effects someone may be experiencing. If you have other problems noted above, test your blood for T and E."

2) in states such as Texas, the statistics are collected state wide, regardless of context. An arrest on the border and a shootout between two Mexican cartels in US soil is counted as a shooting in texas. The fact is, in areas where gun ownership is high the violent crimes are low. The majority of violent crimes happen in gun free areas especially in the larger cities. 

3) population and crime correlation is a legit thing, but not many studies take details into account, the same way that the planet did not heat a single degree in the last 15 years according to satellite imagery, yet the airport sensors which are the sensors used in the government funded climate studies suggest otherwise. Satelite imagery is the most accurate there is, which suggests that urban areas where concrete building is high tend to get higher temperature readings which are in contrast with the rest of the planet's temperature.
Same thing is happening with studies regarding crimes in large urban areas. What not many take into account is that zones where guns are banned tend to have far more violent crime than any other area. In such cities. 

4) Australian police is not exactly someone you need to take examples from, as Australia never had a high rate of crimes to begin with and before the mass immigration did not encounter such situations often.

5) Property theft is a violation of your human basic right. It doesnt matter how many burglaries result in violence, the idea of allowing someone to steal your property is sickening and weak. A society that agrees that it is okay to experience more burglaries and theft as long as there is no violence is a disgusting weak society that deserves everything it gets. Fact is that burglaries are rising. Violent or not, that trend needs to be stopped as it has nothing to do with population amount.

""7% of burglaries end in violence"" means nothing as long as burglaries exist. It doesn not matter if they end with homicides or just property theft - burglaries should not be occurring and that is the end of the discussion.

And anything happens from there, is on the robber's responsibility. You start some shit - expect some shit. It really amuses me how you believe that being passive is a good thing. You are not only allowing some scumbag take the money that does not belong to him, you are also showing all the other scumbags that it is that easy - whether it is breaking into someone's house, robbing a store, or mugging a person. 

So you know why shootings happen in schools and places or worship? Or why the absolute majority of breakins happen in big cities and locations where people are not allowed to carry? Because the risk factor for the criminal is non existent.
Let me break it to you, they do not fear arrest. Prison is their home, they feel welcomed there, they have bros waiting for them. They will ""get rich or die trying"". They care not about their future. The more resistance is shown by bystanders and workers the better, and that is irrefutable fact that has been proven over and over again. No robber will rob a store knowing that there are a clerk and 5 customers who are armed and know how to use these arms. No house burglar will enter a house knowing the owned is packed and is not afraid to pull one out and shoot them in the ass. No mass shooter enters a police station to commit a mass shooting because they know very well that they will be covered in 77 bullet holes, 15 blunt weapon injuries and maybe a few dog bites before they manage to pull their weapon up to their shoulder. 

Stop this passive - ""muh good people"" - stance because it is a weakling bullshit. Order and law are held up by responsible force. Cops are important, but cops are not the source of your security, you are. Just like a doctor is not responsible for your shitty diet that gets you dead at age 44, a cop is not responsible for your self defence as you are not paying them directly and they are not following you as bodyguards.

facepalm,fc7acn8,t1_fc79ih5,1577501748.0,"Trans bullying is the same as any other bullying. Being bullied for being trans is the same as being bullied for being fat or ugly. Bullying is the same with either condition, and being insulted is self inflicted. 
I'm not denying science, I am supporting science that is being studied and proven over and over again for hundreds if not thousands of years. Trans are not the only community that commit suicide for these reasons and are not much different than other communities when it comes to suicide. There are apostates in Sharia States that commit suicide, there are weakling young men who commit suicide due to bullying, there are victims from every demographic. Study any demographic and you will find they respond the same way to rejection and bullying, not to mention people with mental illness, just like gender dysphoria. 

Don't play your ""you're the same as *insert group here*"" because I am not, and you very well know it. Stop behaving as if you understand any of this and have any experience with any of this field, because based on your point of view, you lack the experience. Professionals look at ways to help weak people become stronger, while all you and your party funded science do is trying to silence natural responses to human behavior. At any moment when you enter a group and are drastically different, you will be either ridiculed of praised based on the behavior of the demographic. The same way a fat person will be ridiculed for being fat and sucking in a highschool environment, and the same fat person be praised in a self development group in a gym trying to lose weight and become better. 

I am no stranger to how trans people are being treated, but the answer is not playing the victim, as the time of actual assault is long gone and no one is attacking the LGBTQ community in civilized areas anymore, you have the exact same rights as I do, and your property is not seized or being damaged in any way. Tighten the fuck up, it is your choice to be insulted, no one elses."

As long as your human rights were not violated, killing one self is a self inflicted act and your suggesting that ""harrassment leads to suicide"" is a total bullshit weakling mindset idea that doesnt work. Trying g to fight tyranny with tyrannical means. Your safe spaces on college campuses are spawning pools for weak generations. Your laws that silence people with opinions are the basis of a collapsing society. Get out of the victim mindset, you can't blame something you can't change. Bullies are never responsible for your inability to stand up for yourself, and the concept of global policing is a dead idea that will never work, there is no one that can stand up for you other than yourself. So next time, when some weak teen guy attempts suicide, don't blame bullies and parents (ofcourse unless actual crimes were committed), instead start looking into why the teen was weak and why the father didnt teach them to be better."

All this has nothing to do with forcing acceptance. If you enter a room and the majority of people genuinely dislike you, you have no right to force them to think otherwise. If they hurt you, I mean physically or to your property or name, then yes they need to be punished, but otherwise if someone thinks bad of you it is their right and you have no word in it.

With that being said, that doesnt change the fact that the issue is mental. Put it any way you want, it is not ""norm"" and there is no need to incorporate it into laws and protection laws. As long as you are equal in rights, it is not my concern how people view you, as I am sure that your close friends who know you personally love you and enjoy your company, but when it comes to the populus, it is not in your judgement to force people by law to treat you the way you want to be treated.

But linguistically, if I call you ""he"" because you look to me like a man, and when you correct me I dont bother remembering, there is nothing wrong with that other than me being an asshole which is not a crime. If that hurts your feelings and makes you depressed, it is your own fault, not mine. Using the logic in which some words hurt your feelings therefore you are inclined to depresseion/self hard is idiotic as is lowering ones standards. The same logic implies locking up someone who calls some fat person ""fat"" or someone who calls and ugly person ""ugly"". Sure, it is mean, but it has nothing to do with someone being too weak to not being offended over everything they experience. 

As soon as I write anything you automatically assume I'm against you because you're trans or that I want to refuse you the same rights I have. That's wrong, as I never implied anything like that at any of my comments. I simply said I refuse to treat made up science as fact, and I refuse changing my linguistic nature to fit your feelings.

It looks like they went ""oh people like tits, and we need comedic relief characters because who doesnt enjoy a laugh"" and then proceed to write the short stories in the book but in a dumbed down version to fit each story for each episode. The first two episodes are the cringiest ones. The actor playing Geralt is doing an amazing job but the cameraman is drunk and the writer seemed to be very inexperienced, each dialog line is over the top cringy, attempting to be serious and moral when it shouldn't be, and pushes the story way too quickly.

The books though, the videogame adaptation, I dont count it as a competitor but as an equal. Game of thrones is based mainly on British history and western Europe while the witcher lore is Slavic, all the way from the politics to the esthetic and folk lore, urban legends and myth. Two sides of the same coin, both worlds are incredibly rich with thousands of years of politics and backstory, thought out narratives and very interesting character arcs. The only major difference in the way these stories are told is that Game of Thrones shows you POVs of all the sides it wants to focus on being neutral and letting you decide while the witcher tells the story through the experience of the main character who is trying to remain neutral and express the story as an observer but always being pulled to take part in the story."
