>~~For clarification, I've got no issues with a peaceful protest of an embassy.  Perfectly fine.  But that wasn't what occurred.  General Salami had his fighters attack the embassy.  Sorry, not sorry, he's dead.  Dude had it coming.  It's like an armed robber trying to knock over a liquor store.  When the clerk kills the robber, nobody cries for the robber, he got what was coming.~~  I suck GOP farts and love the taste of boots

A  throwable that fills like a balloon with noclip might be the best way to deal with it, that would allow it to regen like Gu/ Mags and have some defender perks such as taking OP's 3 hits from one direction to kill, but the hit box on the defender side only take 1 if you wanna wall bang so it encourages him to take anchor positioning.

Edit: Could have also a fogged-glass like look, semi-translucent so with the lighting on some maps it could work like a close-proximity mira window."

todayilearned,fcapbcr,t1_fcaouiv,1577573868.0,"South Park doesn't have the nuance that Futuama displayed, it's always survived on crude potty humor with a bit of wit, while Futurama has jokes for both science majors and average people contained in the same punch line for many scenes.

I'd also venture to say that south park's centrist viewpoints are way too preachy. If you want a cartoon to be political thats fine, just pick a side that isn't apathy"
