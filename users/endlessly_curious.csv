That statement right there tells me you are likely not nearly as successful as you claim to be.  Successful people learn very early that assumptions are for assholes.

Innovation is not doing what everyone recommends against.  It is progressing things others have done in a vast majority of cases.  It is taking an existing brick wall and pushing it above what others thought was possible.  If no one is doing something, there is generally a reason - there is no demand.  This obviously is not the cast 100% of the time but it often is more often than not.

Facebook was not the first social media company, it is was improvement.  McDonalds was not the first burger joint, it was someone literally improving it.

There is also a more rational choice than burning someone at the stake.  You can kill them more humanely and if they must be burnt, burn the body.  Burning someone alive is especially brutal and anyone who does that is not rationale.  It would be different if this were a world where magic was a thing and it was a ritual but it isnt."

It doesnt matter how long you are sober, you crave everyday.  I once had an addict with 50 years tell me his 27th year was his hardest.  The second thing is that surgery requires pain which requires pain meds.  That can cost you everything.  I have carpal tunnel I havent had fixed because I know it will require meds for recovery and that scares me."

Regardless, they covered those games extensively.  I hate the Cowboys but you dont become ESPN without knowing what to cover."
