Okay different topic a bit. I was talking to an Iranian about this earlier and he said that the reaction of a death of a ""beloved leader"" was strange. Normally there's some time in between before the death is even confirmed. In this case the body was still burning when the status was confirmed and that while the cries for vengeance are pretty loud, Iranians know that this guy is responsible for a lot of people disappearing from the streets. Basically he said he wouldn't be surprised if the time and location of the presence of this general were leaked from within pretty high up in the Iranian government to ""clean up and move up"" and basically they just had Trump do their dirty work."
