electronicmusic,ff17cft,t3_eqyvkx,1579475988.0,"Real easy. Here's what I do.

First, you listen to an artist you really love. I'll pick Justice for this example. Then I check a remix they've done that I really like. I like this Nightcall remix they did for Kavinsky, so let's check the EP. There's remixes by a lot of people here--Breakbot, Robotaki, and Jackson &amp; His Computer Band. That Jackson one sure is cool, let's check out his work--he's got an album titled Glow and it sounds amazing. I wonder if there are any remixes for this album? Looks like the track Orgysteria has a Para One remix, okay, and it sounds pretty cool. Let's check him out, now. Okay, I'm listening to Para One's work and digging it, and now I see that he's got some remixes for Elevation that sound really cool, with the neatest one being by Gener8ion, so now I check him out, and--

You see what's happening here? I went from an artist with 1.8 million listeners on spotify to 1.6 million to 21,000 to 50,000 to 25,000--look how quickly we dived into more obscure artists all while staying along the same page of a genre I love with artists I jam to. Remixes are usually done by either artists friendly with the record label or newcomers that other labels are trying to squeeze through. These remixes can be an interesting outlet into what sort of new music is being made."

the only thing that actually matters is *consistency*. if in movie 2374 rockets are shown to be able to shoot through water and explode rocks on the sea floor, then that better stay *consistent* throughout the entire movie, and there should never be a moment where a rocket just fizzles out in the middle of the ocean without a real proper explanation."
