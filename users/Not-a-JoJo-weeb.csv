But that is no reason to try and avoid finding renewable energy and helping the environment. While I don’t think it should be at the expensive of 10 trillion dollars on getting rid of planes and cars completely. I think it is an educational thing. 

If you are only 2 miles away from the dollar general, why not get a bike with a basket in the front. Instead of throwing something in the trash can, check if their is anyway to recycle it or reuse it. People say that necessity is the mother of invention. When (or if) the time comes that global warming a major threat to the world, I would expect some 10 trillion dollar action. But until that point, nothing gives you an excuse to be a lazy shit and litter or waste electricity and gas.

Edit: don’t understand the downvotes... is my opinion that global warming is theoretically unprovable wrong? That was a single sentence of my four paragraphs. Grow up"
