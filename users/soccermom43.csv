relationships,fenumhi,t3_eq08uz,1579291046.0,Would you rather leave now while it's just talk or wait until he's scary? Do it now.  There are other fish in the sea.
AskReddit,fenuciz,t1_fenqusg,1579290881.0,I did that once and kept falling asleep during the final. I had to read each question 3 times to even understand what it was asking.  Get at least your minimum amount of sleep!
aww,feeb6v4,t3_eonffw,1579030161.0,Congratulations! No greater act can be done for another human...both ways!!
aww,fdhz8ov,t3_elegoj,1578432866.0,"These are the best ones.  I thought my rescue was the oldest one in the shelter and he lived another 10 years! He was so appreciative and just loved his bologna and a quiet place to sleep.  It's sad that he died alone. During a routine vet procedure he had a heart attack.  I hope he didn't think he'd been abandoned again. I still cry about that sometimes. Ahh pets, you always wonder if the joy outweighs the pain of their loss when you're in the thick of it."
worldnews,fdhyh71,t1_fdh7fb0,1578432465.0,If they were smart they would target sales at his hotels.  That would hurt him the most.
AskReddit,fdhxz3j,t3_elbejj,1578432194.0,"I can't stand, ""to tell you the truth"" for God's sake just say it. I hope you are normally telling me the truth!"
gifs,fdhxrdl,t3_eldygb,1578432083.0,That would be me.  Grabbing and running. So so horrible what they are going through right now.  Such unique species in the world what a loss to humanity.
television,fdhximu,t3_eldap5,1578431958.0,Chris Elliot is too good he makes me get creeped out so bad I almost can't keep watching... but I do.
television,fdhwptr,t3_eldap5,1578431529.0,Great show. I've been watching it since it started. Similar to Arrested Development humor.
DIY,fdhw1d8,t3_el6z1f,1578431170.0,I'm going to install the type made for dogs.  Water and chemicals can seep through so that you can keep it clean and hopefully odor free? We use wood chips now on the ground and that can get pretty smelly and it's hard to clean up poop.
relationships,fdhddzc,t3_eld5bs,1578420360.0,Don't think that going back to the way you were will help. They are probably scared to believe that time is over they may hold some anger too.  Time will heal just be there.
TwoXChromosomes,fdhcyq6,t3_el5zq6,1578420154.0,for me it's mustaches :0( I'm glad you told him
relationships,fdhch4f,t3_el5fpe,1578419908.0,Sounds like either way he will need to work on himself for a while.  Separating is probably the best option.  There is no reason to take a chance with the kids.  He can always start to visit again once he's stabilized.
aww,fderfbv,t3_ekv4qx,1578345045.0,"These poor animals have no chance getting away from the fires.  Man, I would do anything to be out there trying to save them."
aww,fcnz6rp,t3_ehuh1m,1577821236.0,"Welp, no way you can say no to that!  Sweetest thing ever."
relationships,fcny25v,t3_ei4x3m,1577820667.0,"When you are a parent it is impossible to not help especially with grandkids involved. Maybe you could offer to have her live with you and tell your brother that they need to take over the rent until the lease is up. It might not work, I'm sure she will keep paying but at least she can relax a little and this will give them a deadline to get their crap together.  At the end of the lease they will have to move on.  Then she can go be on her own again after they go elsewhere."
funny,fcnwapm,t3_ei2gaj,1577819725.0,oopsy!
cats,fcnvx8n,t3_ei21cn,1577819502.0,Aww that's so sad.  But you loved him enough to ensure he was cared for in your absence.  Better than dying alone at your house.
relationships,fcnvlw2,t3_ei3a6y,1577819318.0,This happened to me he loved me like a brother but my wife hated him because of his arrogance it was quite annoying so i ghosted.  Felt terrible but couldn't see another way out.
relationships,fcnv89k,t3_ei4pxs,1577819097.0,"It's your wedding so I say no, do not include her. She has to mature and get through her issues before you can allow her back into your life.  Teens just don't listen until then.  I'd let her know why though including her known drug use.  Don't feel sorry for her.  McDs will always have jobs!"
aww,fcnubns,t3_ehygcw,1577818570.0,His son is smarter with his finger placement!
relationships,fcnu1lo,t3_ei4wny,1577818407.0,The strongest relationships are okay with alone time and confident enough to not be angry about it.  Don't give up your friends that's the first step in a controlling relationship.
funny,fcntl18,t3_ei3q4g,1577818154.0,Wouldn't that be hilarious for adults? Only come off during meal times.  I would buy it!
listentothis,fcnrxks,t3_ehsw58,1577817278.0,like!
pics,fcnrqd5,t3_ei5kqd,1577817171.0,"Bless you for being so kindhearted.  I know it's really a win for you because of the joy he brings but really, imagine if he didn't have you."
pics,fcnrp9t,t1_fcnmzd8,1577817154.0,it was funny tho!
relationships,fcnre6s,t3_ei2orp,1577816998.0,Tell her you hear him all night and ask if you can take him for walks or bring him to your place sometimes.  If you are willing it will be a win for everybody.  She would want to avoid the noise and for him to get more attention if she loves him.
relationships,fcnqrgo,t3_ei2uu3,1577816664.0,"They say stimulate his senses to help ground him along with the breathing.  Use odor, touch, taste"
IAmA,fcnicc8,t3_ehym96,1577812294.0,"At any point did you worry that they were going to give up on you and ""pull the plug?"" That would be terrifying!"
aww,fcnhsvk,t3_ei2r2p,1577811993.0,you can hear that engine revving up!
HumanForScale,fcnh6dp,t3_ehpj88,1577811621.0,These are the coolest creatures and they have them at the Omaha zoo in their rainforest!
AskReddit,fc362b6,t1_fc271l4,1577382335.0,"Wow, that would hurt. I now know it is better to be honest with someone about why and offer some conditions in which case you would be welcomed (ie, mom can't come because...). Then you could choose to not go if you did not want to.  Lying to you is just awful.  So sorry. I hope you find non-blood family, they will be better!!  We completely relocated to another state to be close to family and we'd find out about get togethers by the Aunt accidentally mentioning it at a later date.  Moved away, make our own fun now with amazing neighbors/friends that choose to be with us."
AskReddit,fb8p84t,t3_ebvgcg,1576618764.0,"When I was a kid I had a horrible nightmare that I was knocked down in the street, someone came to shoot me in the head  but instead of just shooting me they used the gun to break a hole in skull, stick the gun in and then shoot me.  How did I come up with something so horrible?  I can still hear and sense the cracking."
