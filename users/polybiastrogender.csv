WhitePeopleTwitter,few4ilw,t1_few2943,1579405241.0,"Simply speaking, anecdotally and from what other landlords have told me..


I'll try to explain it like this, landlords prefer families, even families with pets. Married with kids is the target demo. That's who you want. They are stable, they are generally safe. You'll sometimes even offer a lower deposit and rent because you know they will keep it clean.

Then after it's a steep drop off, and I'm speaking in general terms and demos. If you're a single male and wonder why people don't want to rent you an apartment or house, it's because bachelor's are messy. Same goes with single women but they are more clutter rather than odd stains type of messy. Single parents are also very unstable and generally messy but it's not horrible, you usually take their deposit and that covers it. Then you start getting into groups that you know are trouble. Now pet owners for the most part aren't bad and dogs are better than cats, but there's that person. We all know that person, socially inept, someone is funding their existence and think pets make better companions than humans. We all know this person. This person is the reason why we charge for pets. The deposit doesn't cover the clean up. I had a few where I needed to hire a whole crew for a week. Even remove drywall and flooring.

Sorry mate. Pet owners are the worst in terms of costly repairs."
