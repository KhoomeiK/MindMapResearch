unpopularopinion,ffcmjja,t1_ffc8nm8,1579802625.0,"And if some women chose that they prefer to have a controlled cut into their peritoneum rather than take the risk of having their vagina tear to their anus... that’s up to them, don’t you think?"
unpopularopinion,ffclw13,t1_ffcj28h,1579802229.0,"Pain is subjective. Some women prefer to go through a C-section because they consider that pain to be more bearable than that of vaginal birth. But they’re routinely told “No, you’re wrong. It will be worse and your baby will get sick” instead of just being told “Whatever girl, you do you”. That’s what bothers me. The pain and trauma that natural childbirth can cause is being downplayed as “the most beautiful experience of your life” and the relatively painless C-section procedure (you’re under local anesthesia) is being demonized because healing takes longer, even though the women who chose elective C-section are obviously okay with the longer healing period or they wouldn’t be chosing it in the first place. It’s a trade-off that they have decided makes sense for them and instead of accepting that, we’re constantly trying to convince them that they’re wrong and selfish because they’re depriving their baby of vajayjay bacteria and whatnot. 

This is purely anecdotal but I even know a woman who is ashamed of getting an *emergency* C-section, imagine that. She keeps stressing that it was an emergency and that she wanted to have her baby “naturally”, like it’s a very bad thing that she got a C-section. 

There’s a similar phenomenon happening around the epidural where there’s a certain stigma attached to getting one instead of just pushing the baby out the old fashioned way and going through all of the “natural” pain of childbirth. Breastfeeding is a similar story. 

To put it in [this journalist’s](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/02/nothing-wrong-c-section-quit-judging-mothers-hadley-freeman) words:
*”A woman’s reasons for wanting a C-section – anxiety, previous birth trauma – are dismissed by the same people who talk so passionately about the importance of the “birth experience”. It is extraordinary how tenacious the belief still is, that mothers prove how devoted they are by how much they are willing to suffer.”* 

(I highly recommend the whole article since it is very insightful and Hadley Freeman is obviously better with words than I am.)"
unpopularopinion,ffcdfzl,t1_ffcbi3r,1579797071.0,I never claimed one was safer and/or easier than the other. I said that some women prefer to get a C-section because they believe it is the best/easier option for them but people keep trying to talk them out of it. Or even worse: Guilt them out of it. In the UK they say these women are “too posh to push”. Do you have the expression in Ireland as well?

unpopularopinion,ffcapjb,t1_ffca2u4,1579795358.0,"Well just imagine you’re a pregnant woman who wants to get an elective C-section and then read the comments to my post. How do you think they would make you feel?

unpopularopinion,ffcaf1l,t1_ffc8tvs,1579795176.0,That is how you weigh both things and that is totally fine. But would you say that it gives you the right to shame and guilt-trip women who would chose the other way around?
Showerthoughts,ffca5ye,t1_ffc8u5k,1579795020.0,Okay then.
unpopularopinion,ffca30j,t1_ffbvwlo,1579794969.0,"I don’t know how you don’t get why *some* women would prefer to have stiches on their belly than on their vagina? Which isn’t to say that one is always better than the other but is it so hard to imagine why some people would prefer one and some the other?

Besides, the fact that *you* had a good vaginal birth and could walk around the next day doesn’t have to mean that that is objectively the case for everyone. Don’t forget that vaginas come in different shapes, sizes, levels of elasticity... And babies too come in different shapes and sizes. A petite woman pushing out a big baby might have a very different vaginal birth experience than you did.

But you are right that vaginal tears aren’t the only argument for a planned C-sections. Others include increased risk of injury and subsequent weakness of pelvic muscles (the ones that control urine and bowel function), lingering pain in the perineum, uterine prolapse... Not to mention the pain and stress of labor and the inconvenience of not knowing when it is going to happen (as opposed to a scheduled C-section). 

Obviously it goes without saying that C-sections also come with their risks and downsides. But  women should be able to chose a C-section without being shamed and guilted for it. And you should be able to chose a vaginal birth without being shamed and guilted for that, too."

YouShouldKnow,ff47oqv,t1_ff3b7fp,1579557342.0,"The NYT is a big news outlet with a lot of subscribers. They’re not going away any time soon. 

But most of your *local* newspapers are probably going through some trouble, I can guarantee you that. Just google a few names of your local newspapers with whatever the translation for “layoffs” is in your language and you’ll see. Those are the reporters and teams that need your support the most. They don’t have the budget for unnecessarily convoluted canceling procedures and it’s very likely you’ll be able to join their customer service by phone. If you have doubts, just call them and ask how canceling would work so you can make a more informed decision and be able to judge the quality of their customer service. But don’t dismiss supporting journalism (especially local journalism) just because of a few big examples like the New York Times. The industry is in big trouble right now, some of that through its own fault and some of it is because the internet has brought changes nobody could have predicted. But we’re already seeing the negative consequences of that through the spread of misinformation and the erosion of democracy around the world."
YouShouldKnow,ff3739f,t3_era4wn,1579535251.0,"Considering that newsrooms around the world are struggling more and more to make ends meet and shutting down one after the other... you should also know that by doing this you are endangering independent reporting and putting more power in the hands of those who create fake news and clickbait news. And no, having “the government” fund the news is *not* a good idea. If your country is small and mostly devoid of corruption, sure maybe. But if your country isn’t then you’ll just end up with a propaganda apparatus paid for by the people. 

Support your local newsrooms. Pay journalists for their work."

AmItheAsshole,fejrvbg,t3_ephtsp,1579184305.0,"Your intentions are really good. BUT if you took this money and hid it from the person it was intended for, you would be a bit of an asshole *towards your grandmother* as she is the person whose money it currently is. I can’t pass a final judgment though unless I know what exactly your plan is. Will you just hide it indefinitely and risk having your sister miss her rent payment? Will you keep it hidden until she finds a job, signs a contract and then tell her about it? Or will you keep it hidden until she graduates? I don’t understand how exactly you plan to do this. Also how do you plan to explain this to your grandmother when she later finds out that you took her money but did not do what she asked with it? 

Another thing to consider is this: If your father hands out the money to your sister in installments like your grandmother asked, she should be learning how to manage it better. It’s maybe not as strong of a lesson as letting her find a job but it would already be a big lesson in budgeting.

EDIT: After thinking about it some more, I’d say you would be the asshole if you did this behind your grandma’s back. You would not be the asshole if you involve her in the plan. The three of you would know about this emergency fund and your sister would only learn about it if all else fails."

AmItheAsshole,fedo87r,t3_eojuzh,1579016268.0,"Back when I was in highschool there were these two guys in our class who were really funny. Because they were funny we were always joking around with them and kinda pulling pranks on eachother. For example if one of them asked to copy our homework we’d give them a wrong version on purpose so they’d read that in front of the class and we would all laugh about it. None of us were part of the “cool kids”. All of us were equally uncool and equally nerdy. It seemed to me like we all thought it was hilarious, the two funny guys included. At no point did any of them complain about the jokes and the pranks. 

It was only 10+ years later that I found out that one of them took the jokes and pranks really hard and felt like we were bullying him. I had absolutely no idea at all and I obviously feel horrible about it. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that teens can be pretty dumb and are generally not very good at communicating their feelings. OP doesn’t give any details about what they felt was bullying nor did he tell us whether or not he confronted this supposed bully about it. Did this kid bully OP and make their life miserable? Maybe. Or was this kid just someone OP didn’t like and disagreed with and OP felt this disagreement in itself was “bullying”? Also maybe, we don’t know. 

What we do know is that a 17 year old died and OP is *celebrating* it. Is OP an asshole for feeling relieved? Absolutely not. Is OP an asshole for gloating over someone’s untimely death? Yeah, kind of. Even if this kid was indeed a bully, he still had most of his life ahead of him and in this life he could still have become a better person. So it’s a gentle YTA from me."
