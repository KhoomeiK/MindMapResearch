Maybe it's time to have a talk then. Apologize and ask how he feels about the relationship. Come clean about how you feel too. Perhaps you can develop strategies on mitigating these things.

Just remember that everyone deserves love. *That includes you*."
bipolar,fewsn34,t3_eqswcr,1579418888.0,This is like the perfect interpretation for what happens in a bipolar mind. I may steal this to show my close friends if you dont mind!
bipolar,fevowv8,t1_feujb9g,1579399795.0,"I don't know how to deal with it. I take 400mg and my brain short circuits big time if I miss a dose.  Out in public, people probably think I'm a huge mental case... well, they wouldn't be wrong but it would show..."
bipolar,fev5bc8,t3_eqokh6,1579393277.0,That is a really cool idea. Especially when music therapy is definitely a thing.
bipolar,fev56he,t3_eqoobo,1579393217.0,"Yep, for some reason its been happening to me a fair bit casually. For me it's more of an casual approach to committing suicide. I'm not suicidal though or depressed. Been there before and I know enough to protect myself.

Whenever you think of suicide, start thinking about how irrational it is. You know it's going to go away after a little bit, so why act on something that's so permanent on thoughts that are so temporary?"

It should be on no different level than if someone was actively threatening to harm someone else in here.  Solicitation of a minor is definitely a crime, Reddit can provide IP addresses to law enforcement upon request.  While most ISPs are dynamic IP assignment, a lot of them specifically tie hardware MAC addresses to the IP so it wouldn't be too hard to find out who it was.  There is a method to make that harder but I won't discuss it here..."
