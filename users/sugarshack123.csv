personalfinance,feuu9wx,t3_eqlbtd,1579389979.0,"Theres no way I would split it and pay 1/3, that doesn't even make sense. If you're going based off of how many incomes, that means there are several people living there for free. 

Honestly sharing a house with two couples who both have young children sounds like a nightmare for a single person anyway. I wouldn't do it"
personalfinance,feutil5,t3_eqknf5,1579389728.0,"Your savings is a sufficient oh shit fund - you could easily fix or replace your car if needed, as well as cover six months of rent if you were to lose your job, so I wouldn't worry about that. It sounds like you will be financially independent enough to live on your own immediately.

If you currently make $3300 a month - but you subtract your rent and your lifestyle costs off of that, it sounds like you will have the wiggle room of a few hundred dollars. How do you feel about that? Do you feel you will be saving as much as you'd like? Have you actually accounted for all of the expenses you will incur living on your own that are not included in rent (like your utilities, cable/internet, groceries)? 

If I was you, I'd wait until winter is over because it sucks to move in winter but then I'd go for it."
preppers,fe9s8v6,t3_eo3huv,1578940992.0,"Northeast, live in a midsized city. You could wear just about anything here and no one would think twice - the public ranges from a decent sized homeless community all the way through wealthy upperclass. What would make you stand out is flaunting what you have, or your method of dress not matching your bag (ie. being dressed for business with a tactical rucksack)."
preppers,fe6cgfy,t1_fe6a7u3,1578886918.0,"I'm a novice prepper by most accounts but I do a lot of research. In my mind, the most likely catastrophic event to occur in my area would be a moderate to long term power outage which would effect the availability of clean water and other necessities. I prep because the world is unpredictable, and it gives me a sense of control."
preppers,fe69qbu,t3_enxojl,1578884928.0,"Ugh that show. I've watched it before, its funny but I can't take it seriously. Those people are so extreme from their personalities to their methods, and most of them are prepping for unrealistic events. I wish they modeled that show after people with your average resources, although I suppose that wouldn't be much of an audience draw.

Most people on this sub agree and are pretty sane about their preps and mindsets. You need a healthy mind+body, but I don't know how many put it into practice."
dogs,fe5vdq9,t3_enve1n,1578875797.0,"Literally everyday on this sub is someone saying ""please stop \*insert random topic\*"". Getting super old, its more annoying than whatever the OPs are even complaining about.

Your logic on this is pretty flawed. I agree that a lot of shelter/rescue dogs come with baggage, no denying it. A lot of them also come with information which is very helpful when choosing your dog, such as how much affection they like, health issues they may have, aggression/resource gaurding tendencies. etc. 

Your talk about extensive health tests doesn't add up, maybe for some reputable breeders sure, but lets face facts, most breeders just get two dogs and breed them and slap on an outrageous price tag. 

If you don't want to adopt then fine, no ones making you. Just be a good dog owner thats all anyone cares about."
women,fe5tg5f,t3_enn0rg,1578874558.0,"Does this happen to you every time? Or was it your first time? If it was your first time, thats very normal if your hymen was intact. 

Even if it wasn't your first time there are quite a few common reasons you could bleed, such as if the sex was very rough or if you are suffering from a yeast infection."
preppers,fe5oadl,t1_fdzyccq,1578872066.0,"Yup, most people can't jog even a mile. When I first started running, it took months for me just to figure out how to breath correctly, I had no breath control at all and my chest would hurt after a quarter mile - I wasn't overweight, it was just a problem for me.

To add to the OP's point, I often see ""if you take prescriptions, make sure you have backup!"" However its very difficult to get your doctor to write you an extra script so that you have it just for your preps, and most people can't just get refills whenever they want, regardless of the type of medication. Even if you have backup theres always the possibility that you will run out or that the backup is lost/stolen/damaged.

I think its important that if you fall into this category that you figure out any homeopathic, natural, or OTC substitutes you can so that in a pinch so you aren't completely screwed. At the very least, don't just know the name of your medication but what exactly is in it so that you can identify similar products with the same active ingredients."
preppers,fe5l49p,t1_fe5iri2,1578870846.0,"Pretty much. Not exactly what I have, but thats basically my thought process. 

What matters to me most is that it fits what I need in it, that its light enough that I can carry, and that it offers some waterproofing protection. (You can always pack a waterproof shell or cover in it if thats a big concern for you, they're usually very lightweight and fold up really small). On the outside I don't like it to look very tactical or official, I just want it to hold what I need on the inside."
preppers,fe5joug,t1_fdy0tt5,1578870310.0,"Agreed. A go bag is an easy start to wrap your mind around and its fun. Not to mention most of what goes into it can be used other ways well, like camping or hiking, so you can get use out of your money even if you \*hopefully\* never have to use it. 

To throw in my two cents also - watch some youtube prepping videos, even if you don't agree with the reasons why people are prepping, or particularly like their persona, its a good way to get exposure to brands and ideas you hadn't thought of.

Beware of what you buy on Amazon, a lot of imposters on there, buy direct from manufacturer or a trusted retailer. The last thing you want is a knock off water filtration unit that fails when you need it most."
preppers,fe5hks1,t3_ent3a1,1578869478.0,"I do think it matters, maybe not to an extreme - but if the unlikely scenario of bugging out happens - ideally, I want people to think I grabbed my old high school backpack and put my favorite stuffed animal in it."
preppers,fe5f721,t3_entbip,1578868750.0,"Why are you worried about the police searching your home? Under what circumstance do you think that would happen? Genuine question, because there are a lot of reasons not to keep too much cash around, but this is a very odd/specific reason for concern. Not likely in my opinion, unless you are actually doing something illegal and are afraid eyes are on you.

I would be more concerned with theft, fire or flood.

In any case, my suggestions are:

Keep your money in a fireproof/waterproof safe. Preferably one that is bolted to the ground, or not easily movable (most good ones are heavy to an extreme anyway and would take a lot of foresight to remove). Keep the keys in a separate location than the safe, and do not tell anyone you have a safe.

If a safe is not a viable option for you, spread your money out. DO NOT KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PLACE. Keep it in areas that are unusual, but that you will not forget, ex. taped to the underside of a drawer, or cut a hole into the wall and put an outlet plate over it - stash the cash in there. If you are forgetful and you spread it out to many areas, make an untitled list of hiding spots and keep that in a separate area as well. 

Personally, keeping more than 1000 of cash at home would make me feel more uneasy than at ease. But I'm not sure what you're prepping for so you do you."
women,fdcsrxt,t3_ekjlds,1578283287.0,"I understand what you are saying, I actually relate to it quite a bit. - But something you must know is that you are more than your resume, and someones job or bank account does not measure the type of person they are.

Some of the richest people I know are some of the scummiest, they are also some of the most unhappy. 

Its cliche but, focus on what you have to offer rather than what you don't. And in opposition, if there is something you don't like about yourself you can always change it. During your job search, look for jobs that help with tuition reimbursement, that promote from within, etc. Get yourself into an environment that can benefit you in the future, and express that you desire it during your interviews so that they know you're driven and don't just want to be stagnant.

Good luck with everything, its a fresh start - not a set back."

newhampshire,fd9is2p,t3_ejpvrm,1578233990.0,"I lived in an apartment that had random fees as well. These fees were not considered part of the security deposit. The security deposit is meant for exactly what it sounds like, security for the landlord- to make sure if you damage their property or default on your last rent payment that they are not screwed over. 

Example, there was a fee for if you locked yourself out and someone from the management office needed to come and let you in, $25. If this happened it would be tacked onto your monthly rent when you got your bill. It definitely would not have been deducted from the security deposit - the only way I could see that happening is if you refused to make payment then upon moving out when you were attempting to recoup your security deposit they would deduct any unpaid fees from it."

preppers,fcoypgo,t3_eib9yx,1577845272.0,"IMO, spending copious amounts of money on guns/ammo/weapons is a waste. You need some - sure I agree, but you can only carry so much, and you only have two hands. I'd rather have copious amounts of food.

I also think people who only prep for bugging out are making a mistake, you're much more likely to need to bug in than bug out."

women,fchgab7,t1_fbxxxxi,1577650234.0,"Agreed. I've looked younger than my age most of my life, however, I've gotten comments before that were ""oh I thought you were a teenager until you started talking."" It may just be the way you carry yourself makes you seem older.

If you are worried about your physical appearance you are certainly young enough to implement a lifestyle that will encourage you to look youthful for longer. Drink lots of water, stay out of the sun, eat correctly and take care of your skin, etc.

I wouldn't take what other people say too seriously though, people are idiots."
dogs,fcfn9gl,t1_fccvvf7,1577631941.0,"Agreed, your nephew is the issue not your dog. The way your dog reacted is pretty understandable and in my opinion not a sign of aggression, more like a sign of self defense. Don't bring your dog around the nephew - even though I don't think its your issue, you're better off taking control of the situation than leaving it up to someone minding their child, its obvious thats not going to happen."
dogs,fcb8bi6,t3_egytxw,1577583674.0,"I generally consider the US pet friendly, however it depends on what region you live in. I live in the northeast, its pretty common for local rescues to ship southern dogs up here to find new home because dogs are treated differently down south than they are around here (no offense to any southerners!). I guess it is common for people to keep their dogs outdoors down south - resulting in more strays, injuries, parasite contractions, pregnancies etc. Where I live thats basically unheard of. I'm not saying there are only ""good"" dog owners here by any means, but generally the shelters have low populations of dogs and I'd like to think thats due to a low rate of surrenders and strays. A counterpoint to this however, is I feel there are a lot of shady breeders around here, just random people who get two dogs and decide to use them for income. 

I would agree that most stores do not allow dogs unless they are service dogs. Leash laws are also very common and I'm thankful for that. I don't consider either of these practices being non-friendly, there are people with allergies and phobias, prior circumstances have lead to these requirements and businesses need to protect themselves."

And, If it is tapeworms - they can be transmitted by a dog ingesting an infected flea. If you have a lot of stray cats/dogs or wildlife crossing through your yard it ups your chances of your dog contracting."

dogs,fbvz72z,t3_eensbo,1577138222.0,"I disagree -- you can get a dog for whatever reason you want - including if you want your current dog to have a companion. I'm not really sure who these people are who get a second dog expecting the dogs to take care of each other in a sense...like who is out there doing that? I have experience with a friend who's dog became very visibly depressed when she moved and was no longer able to take him to daycare (none close by), she got another dog and his entire demeanor changed, he started to play again and his quality of life increased. He probably would have died a lot younger and had a less happy life if she hadn't done that. She took care of both, loved both, etc... so who cares why she did it in the first place?"
