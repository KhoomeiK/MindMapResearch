depression,fdduaza,t3_ekqubq,1578324155.0,"I really can feel this so bad. It’s so fucking annoying when you can’t even fucking kill yourself, You feel so completely helpless and can’t help but to live which is a fucking dread everyday. It’s so hard, I wish dying was easy"

misanthropy,fd97o6j,t3_ek8qop,1578229641.0,I totally agree with this. There’s literally no point in making friends because you’re going to get hurt anyway if you trust them. It’s better to be off by yourself than be in a crowd full of fake people

depression,fcxhp3o,t3_ejeyfi,1578063196.0,I feel like everyone is alone in this world... because your problems are your problems and no one can help them but only can listen and say “aw that’s sad”
AskReddit,fcqp5fk,t3_eifsmg,1577889905.0,"I was Afraid of Henry the 8th... no joke. When I was about 8 years old, in school we were learning about the tudors and how Henry killed his wives so everyday after school I would get so terrified of him if he would kill me... I had to do rituals to prevent me from thinking of him (eg like repeatedly saying a word 24/7 or avoiding items that link to him?) lmfao I don’t even know, I just know it was a ridiculous fear 😂"

depression,fc8e1gf,t3_egg1l7,1577532808.0,I feel the same... I really wake up hating to breathe. It’s the most emptiest and deadest feeling ever and I hate it I wish I could just not wake up one day. I can’t even type a message because my concentration has gone so low I’ve lost my grammar. But other than that hold on... we can do this together
