But I still have hope, especially since yesterday, I hope you too and everyone can find a shimmer of hope someday. Hopefully, the hope I found doesn't turn out to be fake hope."

But Honestly, judging just by your post, you probably aren't as dumb as you think, just by judging yourself and overthinking the possibility that you're stupid you have proven that you at least have a critical thinking mind (which is worth a lot, even if you have a below-average IQ). Stupid people are always the ones that feel too confident and don't doubt themselves."

depression,fevdd31,t3_eqpgp2,1579396079.0,"I just want you to know that you're not alone with this, I also have the same problem were sometimes a Wave of Depression hits out of nowhere.  
I Completely understand how you feel when you only give plain and boring answers, it feels like they now hate you because you seem uninterested, and because of that you can also start to hate yourself for being so socially inept when seemingly nothing is wrong at that moment.  


at least that's how I feel,  
I know that might not help, but I hope you can find some comfort in knowing that you're not alone. And Most likely those people don't hate you, despite what everything makes you feel like that."
