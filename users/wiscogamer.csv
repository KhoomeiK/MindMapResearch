instantkarma,ffarncr,t1_ffarfsh,1579742889.0,Why do they have to be around that old man could have a son just out of prison just doesn’t happen to be there. I’m sure he can be found. But the main point is that’s never ok. Or better yet that old man has a knife or gun and kills the kid in that situation he’s bigger and badger or crazier

Kid got what he deserved for everyone saying you shouldn’t strangle a child the kids at least 14 if not 16 he knows right from wrong I’m more for protecting the elderly and teaching this little prick a lesson. Also he learned a valuable lesson there’s always someone bigger and badder so watch who you mess with.

It happens to married people and people from every walk of life I personally think it should be mandatory to keep shit like this from happening. 

What’s even worse is if your married wife cheats and gives birth because your mairried even if a dna test proves the child isn’t yours your still on the hook for child support but I guess at that point you have more way more problems than just that"
GamingLaptops,ff1xxtw,t1_ff1xnjb,1579488719.0,"Your right some are probably not but using my own experience we have had our buisness for 20 years many people are repeat customers 1000s of jobs done we only have three reviews 2 good one bad most people don’t leave reviews if they did you’d be seeing really popular items with million reviews it’s just how it works. 

I mean we can’t even get everyone to vote in our country let alone leave a review"
GamingLaptops,ff1xsfs,t3_er6lkr,1579488618.0,Well I know it can be a long wait depending on what you get and availability. The only laptops they stock so to speak are like sagers. The rest are preserved and then upgraded so there is a wait and all of us once people are impatient
GamingLaptops,ff1ww6b,t3_er6lkr,1579488034.0,I got 4700k with a 980m all repaste  more ram and ssd screen clabrafion and back light bleed check thinknit was one of the first gsync laptop screens back then. Took few weeks but I had a good experience and a lot of others as well. The truth is if u sell enough eventually your going to piss someone off it even happens to me in my own buisness offered to change something people got pissed said they wanted to cancel the contract because they thought it was to much money seemed ok East two weeks later bad review with lies about the situation on google. Some people you just can’t make happy. These companies don’t want bad reviews and generally go out of there way to make people happy I my experience
GamingLaptops,ff1wf57,t3_er6lkr,1579487714.0,I think those people with that leave unfavorable reviews are slightly dishonest imho. I ordered a beast rig way back when and had everything work out. Main thing is they will honor there warranty as long as it’s within the time if u want an extended warranty buy it.  Get is use the crap out of it and if something does go wrong it will happen right away. Most people if u read into the reviews are people that bought something and then didn’t like it and kept trying to return and then make up a lame reason to return if u want that kind of return ability go to bestbuy or amazon. They are a legit company as long as you’d a legit person not trying to game the system
pcmasterrace,ff0fap1,t1_ff0667l,1579468302.0,Thanks this is what I was looking for I’ve seen a lot of benchmarks and price for performance it seems like amd is the clear choice
pcmasterrace,ff02w0n,t1_ff02m14,1579464598.0,Are we expecting g those this year and also what about updates in the past there’s minimal if any bios updates from amd same with graphics cards. Especially now with all the new chips what’s the support for older hardware.i was thinking of an entire amd rig but this was a thought obviously

pcmasterrace,feygrlh,t3_eqwdkh,1579445318.0,Yea 2080ti is good but what about going from 14nm to 7nm if this is true the heat and power saving should be huge depending on how well it’s optimized
pcmasterrace,feygewc,t1_feygayf,1579445175.0,But that’s the thing new 3000 series gpu are right around the corner it seems like
pcmasterrace,feyewme,t1_feyempa,1579444557.0,Yea that’s why I’m thinking with a jump like that it could deffinetely be worth the wait
pcmasterrace,feyes5r,t1_feybr46,1579444504.0,Basically top of line everything like if they are coming a 3080ti or amd 5900xt with new amd Eyez. Etc basically a nice high end rig

pcmasterrace,fey7fb8,t1_fey70ot,1579441750.0,"I hadn’t even thought about that but since most of these announcements are right around the corner a lot of details should come to light soon. I’m also seeing sony is planning to release more games on pc which would make for even more since for a comparison.

pcmasterrace,fdqctmy,t3_empykm,1578663225.0,"Whoever else on this thread said it and biggest problem is driver support it’s almost non existent whereas Nvidia will push out a patch to address gaming issues on there GPUs ASAP. That’s the big one for me. 

Even if they were both the same theoretical power Nvidia cards  are always going to be better optimized than amd. Personally I think part of this is because they are playing catch up. At some point they might be on par with Nvidia cards which would give them more time to catch up with software enhancements on the driver side of things. 

I would deffinetely support and once they have better updates and top end cards but my humble opinion is there not there yet and they are the budget competitor which some people will use but they aren’t the best and won’t be for a while."

pcmasterrace,fdf8jol,t1_fdf73xo,1578355797.0,I have a Sony 900f great tv and I have seen other threads that say 1440p at 120 is possible with a high speed hdmi cord. It has a pretty good upconversion on regular programming. So I thinknit would look good at 1440p down side is I read 23 ms lag Input hopefully ces has some new crazy tv that makes this perfect setup
pcmasterrace,fdez8j7,t1_fddl3mg,1578349759.0,Question for you since I’m considering doing the same thing. Is it still a good gaming experience at 1440p I’m curious because over hdmi can’t you only get 60hz or am I wrong......I hope I’m wrong and does the picture still look good lowering the resolution

pcmasterrace,fd69z1g,t3_ek4tdc,1578187781.0,I was reading up my tv has 23ms lag response and even though the screen is 120hz it only has an hdmi port which means 60hz so that wouldn’t be ideal I still think I’m situation that a laptop would be best so I could move it around everywhere still have high refresh rates just use a cooling pad and don’t overclock u servile and watch temps

pcmasterrace,fd618jk,t1_fd5ygbl,1578184124.0,Exactly so what happens if I turn it down to 1440p I wonder
pcmasterrace,fd613pl,t3_ek4tdc,1578184062.0,That’s what I’m worried about it more size and shape of room very small house and not much space for a desk monitor chair so either a laptop and I can move it from the kitchen table to my lap on the couch etc all over or I get a rig I can hook up to my tv.

pcmasterrace,fd5xwcs,t1_fd5xgkb,1578182887.0,Yes but what’s the experience like gaming on a 4K tv is what I’m really trying to figure out is it gunna be horrible
pcmasterrace,fd5xj9n,t3_ek4tdc,1578182754.0,The question is more towards how is the gaming experience on a tv from a pc I guesss especially with a lower refresh rate screen
