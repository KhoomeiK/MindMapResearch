To substitute the chaos and meaningless of the universe with a set of rules, an accountability for our actions, a reward for good behavior and a punishment for bad, something to have faith in, structure to build community around, it's easy to see how appealing it is to people, but unfortunately either one, some, none, or all religions are ""true"" and since there would be a whole lot of contradiction if they were all true then that means at least some of them are based on lies.

Someone would come up, I'd ask ""how many bracelets do you want?"" they would say ""Three please"" and magically I would write that number down and make that many bracelets, and at no time does anybody keep an imaginary inventory.

So my question is why can't Etsy do this instead of using their same inventory system they use for non made to order listings?  I fail to see what problem it would create.  The site would still be able to keep track of sales, because each time someone orders they would specify how many they are ordering.
