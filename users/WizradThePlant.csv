TooAfraidToAsk,ff5ax9v,t3_erc31s,1579585648.0,"Just wanna make something clear here because of the various comments, in the United States,its not as common in either south or north to show hatred or look down upon minorities as before, due that any extremist person from the right, is afraid of being infamous, or as twitter calls it ""getting cancelled"" so they switch sides, but not ideologies, they make most people believe they are progressive by adopting a pro-extreme left stance or endorsing minorities entirely, and ngl most people buy it and lash out to anyone who catches the bluff as a ""homophobe"", a ""racist"", a ""transphonic"" etc, etc.   
The real problem is expressing a non-extremist opinion about things regarding race,gender,sex,etc and someone getting offended and attacking them.  
Most moderate conservatives share the collective mindset of disliking extremists, although, some see other moderates as extremists, for example a moderate conservative calling someone who was mildly offended by something on social media a ""snowflake"" or a moderate liberal calling someone who personally doesnt really like a black actor a ""racist"" or ""neo nazi"" or something.  
I personally prefer being a moderate republican conservative for personal reasons i will not disclose atm, but that doesnt mean i hate the other side, only their extreme as well as ours.  
Most of these events occur because of misunderstandings between moderates, which can come to seeing each other as extremists while they are not.  
However, this may seem biased on my part, but a community of people known as Social Justice Warriors has been on the rise even more than any alt-right communities in the US ever since Trump became president. And dont get me wrong i do know what the difference between social justice itself and being a social justice warrior is, or for short SJW. Social Justice is meant to bring equality and fairness to every race, not even excluding White People, men, straight people when it comes to the LGBTQ discussion, however, SJW's implement this ideology the wrong way, instead of spreading tolerance and bringing people together via understandings, they continuosly attack people who disagree with them or people who they deem racist, sexist, homophobic, fatphobic, etc, by implementing fear tactics by threatening them verbally to make them infamous on social media or IRL.  
On multiple occasions and on different subreddits ive been downvoted for this exact same topic, and some people keep telling me that SJW's are a vocal minority compared to others, and while that may have been true before, its a very widespread ideology as of now, even reaching news media such as CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc, and even websites, such as tumblr, twitter, and yes, even reddit, but unlike the others, reddit is more tolerably liberal and understanding than the other sites, which is why it's my favourite out of the three.  
The problem for me is that personally we shouldnt be treating these people like they are just mobs and ignoring them, because that's most likely what they want, to make us think they wont do anything while they prepare to spread those ideologies and gain even more support.  
As for alt-right groups, i cant stand the hatred most moderate conservatives get because of the vile acts of these people, its honestly so aggravating.  
Note:im not saying that minorities arent discriminated against in their respective local communities, nor that their problem are less important than ours, im just stating my point of view about all this mess years of misunderstanding have created."
