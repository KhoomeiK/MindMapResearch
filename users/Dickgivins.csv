todayilearned,ff77ltc,t1_ff7798h,1579642699.0,"There are quite a few people who nominally identify as religious, but don't actually practice or hold strongly to the worldview. I myself don't pray, go to Church, or participate in any Church activities; however I was baptised and sometimes still identify as Christian because it played such a big part in my upbringing."
Rhodesia,ff6w798,t3_erwmrj,1579636148.0,"The British Empire's sole purpose was to make money and advance the geopolitical interests of the British Elite. To that end it enganged in widespread slavery in Africa, the American colonies and the West Indies, only giving it up when it stopped being profitable. They subjugated millions of people around the world in order to extract resources from them and take their land, using whatever pretext was neccessary to justify it. 

They conquered the Boer Republics in South Africa because they wanted their diamonds. When Boers refused to surrender after the first few years, the British rounded up their women and children into concentration camps where thousands died of starvation and diesase. 

They conquered India to corner the spice trade and use it a base to sell ungodly ampunts of opium to the Chinese, then fought two wars against the Chinese when their government tried to put a stop to the state sponsored drug dealing and all of the crippling addiction and social chaos that came with it. In India they made the Caste System legally binding and used it to set the natives against each other.

Rhodesia's Independence was predicated on Ian Smith's refusal to allow the black majority, who made up more than 95% of the population, to be given equal rights. Many things can be said of Smith's government: it was competent, free from bribery and personal corruption scandals, it did a remarkably good job of maintaining the economy and the armed forces despite being beset by international sanctions. However it was not democratic. No country in which a minority of less than 300,000 rules over a population of 5,000,000 can make a credible claim to that.

Smith gave all sorts of reasons as to why this was neccessary: the blacks were not ready to rule, they needed education, they were too susceptible to communism, black rule had descended into authoritarianism in much of Africa, they would reap vengence on the white's the first chance they got etc, etc. In many ways Smith's refusal to allow the blacks to power peacefully ensured leaders ensured that they would take it by force. So instead of peaceful democrats like Bishop Able Muzorewa coming to power, it was the violent strongman Mugabe.

Smith never made any serious effort to make the black population ready for self rule, because in reality he never wanted them to be. He himself said ""I don't believe in black majority rule ever in Rhodesiaâ€”not in a thousand years. I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day it is black, I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia.""  Blacks remained second class citizens in virtually every way: their rights to own land, live and work in ""White Areas"", hold government jobs and receive higher education was severely restricted. This only began to change in the late 1970's  when tide of the war had turned against the white's and Smith began to get desperate Many blacks still lacked access to basic infrastructure and education even in the final years of smith's reign.

I highly recommend Peter Taylor's coverage of the conflict for Thames TV, it provides a great insight into both sides od the conflict. https://youtu.be/g3u5CxS3j5M"

Besides, it's not as if Florida is way better than the other states when it comes to the rights of the accused. Arrests are still public record everywhere else, other jurisdictions just have more regulations about how and when that information is released.

ireland,feyhqqc,t1_feybvlb,1579445745.0,"I don't think a United Ireland is imminent, but Brexit does weaken to the union in several ways.
Northern Ireland is still in the same customs union as the Republic, but it will now have customs checks on goods going from England and Scotland that are likely to end up in the Republic. This sets both a practical and psychological precedent. 

Northern Ireland has, for a good 22 years now, been moving closer to the Republic and father from the UK, and this is a small but significant step on the journey. Ultimately I think the major impetus for a border poll and reunification will be cold hard demographics. Obviously other factors will be at play: there will be discussions about the economic burden of the north, the possible downsides of losing the NHS and UK government jobs, the place NI will hold in the Republic (continued devolution vs full integration, cultural and religoious protections for protestants) etc. But honestly I think the higher Catholic birthrate ensures that at a certain point, popular demand for reunification will be unstoppable regardless of what the politicians say and do. I'm no fortune teller, but I honestly don't see it taking more than a decade or so."

I think that important lessons from this occupation could have been applied to the occupation of Iraq. That occupation was a bad idea to begin with, but it's execution was dreadful from a strategic point of view. We disbanded their army, so all their soldiers went home angry and without jobs, but they still had their weapons. We also fired all the civil servants who had connections to the ruling Baath party. This included thoudands of schoolteachers and  most of the competent people with experience in government and administration (many of whom only joined because they had to in order to keep their jobs). And finally, we detained huge numbers of men on shoddy evidence (many informers recieved a bounty for every trouble maker they accused, which naturally led to a host of false accusations) and kept them detained for months. The detention camps became jihadi indoctrination centers, where the few genuine militants inside radicalized the average joes thrown in with them. A real recipe for disaster it was."

1. Much of that federal land is uninhabitable desert. Other large swathes of it are already being used for commercial cattle grazing, logging and resource extraction.

2. It's very difficult and expensive to acquire the amount of land (and the right type of land) neccessary to sustain a human being. Back in the 19th century you could claim a homestead and the government would just give it to you, but it doesn't work that way anymore.

3. Even if large numbers of people wanted to live primitive lifestyles like this, it's only possible for a limited few. The truth is there are just too damn many human beings on the planet now and there isn't enough land to sustain us all living in this fashion.

Eventually his rule became so divisive that he was overthrown by the army. One heavily fraudulent election later, and they have another oppressive general in power. Sad for the Egyptians.

Yemen had mass protests that devolved into a chaotic civil war which is still ongoing. Disastrous for the Yemenis, thousands have been killed.

Syria's protests turned into a horrific civil war which have largely been won by the brutal dictator Assad.
