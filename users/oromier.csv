Pro Tip: Install visual studio community edition and use that for C++ / C and not VSCode"

wma,femhn74,t1_feme2w5,1579256027.0,"oh you don't automate it ? Hmm, Maybe write a scraper or a script which will try to aggregate those events ? Surely websites like Hema Alliance have access to the calendar where you can get their data for example. (Maybe send them a mail or add on the website a disclaimer taht the data is from X source)"
javascript,fekw7p3,t1_fejx4lb,1579208877.0,I think since TS those entitled backend devs have no reason to hate JS. If you want JS with type safety then just write typescript it borrow so much syntax from C# and Java.
wma,fed93g1,t3_e5ez1t,1579004256.0,"interesting, where do you get the events from ? 

I'm also a dev who looks at ways to improve the HEMA community experience since I'm new to it and can't find some resources I want.."

todayilearned,fdq61m2,t1_fdpxkiq,1578656434.0,"Well.. I have a friend who knows jack shit English. He can speak it barely.. once in college the teacher would ask him ""Hej Tim how are you?"" and he replied I KID YOU NOT ""I'm 20 thanks"".. 

Today Tim has a IT company working with various clients in the world.. and when asked how you do you development job.. he says: I google until I hit the right solution. 

So Tim is a hero.. He barely speaks english, he understands it well enough to talk to clients and he is a software engineer who googles randomly until he hits a solution... I admire the guy"
Stadia,fdq54yi,t1_fdq2azl,1578655284.0,"you are one of the few ones.. I mean if I was a broke college studnet I would play the shit out of stadia since I remember having a crappy laptop and playing Dota2 on like 30FPS with everything low to the point I only saw pixels.. but now that I work and can afford a console or gaming PC i really don't see the appeal to stadia. 


The biggest downside for me is that you have to pay for the games again.. if they could link your steam account or ssomething like that like GeforceNow does it I would not mind it. I would urge people to try GeforceNOW since Imo it is the better Stadia atm."

javascript,fdk6ltj,t1_fdk48d7,1578497255.0,"True, combining them is the best solution.."
javascript,fdjwnxk,t1_fdjvozo,1578489899.0,"Ah sorry I have to elaboret more on this second part, I meant the generated types used for example with GraphQL. We use the same graphql types on the backend and frontend with react (in our new project) I won't go into details now on this but let it stay like this, you have to have same typs front and backend.. 

Now on the first part, yes, the codebase is wrong, it was prototyped to an MVP and never got the time to do a refactor, its a startup what can you expect.. Never have I worked in a codebase that was super concise from front to back. There are parts, which are sensitive with some calculations that use unit tests of course, but the coverage is maybe ~10% ish, but you are right with decent Unit tests this would also ""fix"" the problem... depends on you do you like to write tests or types ? :D"
javascript,fdjsgn6,t1_fdjngpg,1578485858.0,"Sure. The app I'm working now on in my fulltime job has seen great benefits of TS. It was just JS and clustered / hacky code and to debug a simple typo you would loose literally days. 

Lets take an example(super stupid example since Its the last thing i can remember), lets say you have an invoice type you declare it like Invoice myInvoice = new Invoice() and this is a custom type you made for your app to be an invoice it has its attributes like issueDate, value etc. 

Now If you don't have TS and you just have normal JS, you could write in those values WHATEVER the heck you want. intentionaly or not doesn't matter. So if I work with a team and they screw around our super hacky / messy JS code and change something unintantionally, which affects the attribue of my invoice I'm not thrown an error nor do I ever get the feeling that I have done something bad. 

And so the days go on and on after 1 month user start reporting issues with the invoices bcs something is not right I have to fix it asap since its invoices, time is money literally, and then I start debugging. By debugging I go from the frontend where the invoice is issues do the API and the Fuzzy / messy JS business logic. and I cant find the issue. everything seems fine the ORM returns the correct data, the business logic seems to have the same logic but the issue persists. Then after maybe 1 day of breaking my head on the table I find something weird in the code bcs I'm debugging every function one by one every input every output and check their values. I found a werid one and trace the issue back to one specific case which I didn't know it exitst.. 

IF there was TS it would not let them change anything without changing the Class. it would SCREAM at me so loud and would not let me compile the code to JS. 

So I love Functional programming but for something like this i just can't have OOP. It made my life sooooo much better and easier on the backend. 

However I'm starting to warm up to the idea of TS in the frontend. Since you share types between your front and back end which means if you don't received the same type from the backend, something is wrong and someone messed witht the code, or it breaks nad you know that you have to adapt your frontend code. 

Anyway I hope this helps and if you have any other question feel free to ask I also just work a few months with TS for now."

javascript,fdjiufx,t1_fdj9hbk,1578472815.0,If you work on a large scale backend project with NodeJS TS is a life saver.. I was the same opinion as you but then I just had to rewrite in TS and it is so much better..
