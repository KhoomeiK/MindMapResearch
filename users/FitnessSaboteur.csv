 Many of them have never done real work that requires somebody to actually control their own real, physically demanding workload instead of some abstract clerical job.  Yet these same people criticise police, military, oil workers, and capitalist business owners.

You might even disagree with me politically abd economically, but there is a cancer in society of adults who are now in their 30s and can't take care of themselves, but can vote.  It could be a very scary future.  I'm glad there is someone else that sees things for how they are."
