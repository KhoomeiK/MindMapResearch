Personally, I switched back to OFW (back when henhaku was the exploit) in order to connect to psn, play my remaining games, sync trophies, and then I'll switch to cfw in order to have my device open. I hate closed stuff, so I hope nobody gets banned anymore, because those people were most likely just supporting open source.
Personally though, I wouldn't take that risk, and I'll never buy anything related to consoles ever again (PS4 was a huge disappointment as well, for me)."
