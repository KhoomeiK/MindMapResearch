I think I know what you're getting at - Piebald animals are way more likely to be blind and/or deaf, but still more likely to be fine than not. For example I think white pits have about a 20% chance of deafness (mostly bilateral, but a couple percent only have deafness on one side)."
aww,fespemj,t1_feskfmx,1579367615.0,"Feel free to look at my posts - DNA tested half AmStaff, head no thicker than this one. Maybe less thick even.

This dog has distinctive pit features, but is definitely a mix."
aww,fes70xj,t1_fes6nvu,1579362056.0,Ouch. Truth hurts.
aww,fes1daa,t1_fepjuug,1579360431.0,"1% sounds super concerning.

I have a pit mix who hasn't so much as growled or shown anything but completely even temper and friendliness/sweetness her entire life.

Let's not perpetuate the idea that every pit or pit mix is a hair trigger away from ripping your face off."
aww,feryu5n,t1_ferp6x9,1579359756.0,"Really bad and misleading data. You'll see websites that quote the percentage of pure bred Pit Bull Terriers and then make a misleading comparison to (poorly reported) bite statistics that include a dozen different bull breeds and mixes.

People also like to mock the notion that ""it's the owner, not the dog."" But it really is accurate that there are a lot of bad owners of guard breeds: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17065657

People also fail to realize that a significant majority of dog violence comes from unneutered males (and I'm guessing rarely breeders - primarily irresponsible owners again).

A properly socialized small pit like you have here is generally an extremely docile, even-tempered dog."
aww,ferw2fv,t1_feq2hfl,1579358973.0,"You're writing the dog off because it's a smallish half American Staffordshire Terrier? Properly socialized, they're known for having a very docile and affectionate temperament towards people, especially their family.

This isn't some stocky unneutered purebred Pit Bull Terrier with cropped ears used to guard or fight. It's a pretty important distinction."
aww,fertbqi,t1_fepl0xj,1579358171.0,"""Pit bull"" is a pretty broad term that applies to about a dozen breeds. This looks like an American Staffordshire terrier mix - a thinner kind of pit."
aww,ferscrl,t1_fepl1ua,1579357812.0,">Very sweet. Be very very careful with the baby with a ~~pit~~ dog. Even the most well behaved ~~pit~~ dog can be startled and act irrationally.

No reason to malign pits here."
