AsianBeautyRehab,fdclssx,t3_eju28z,1578278086.0,"Not Asian beauty but my holy grail Vitamin C serum! It‚Äôs great for sensitive skin and doesn‚Äôt break me out like most do and since using it I‚Äôve seen significant improvement in my dark spots and acne scars! It‚Äôs the only one I will ever use again! There‚Äôs no fragrance, I mix a few drops in with my night time moisturizer and it doesn‚Äôt sit on top of your skin. Fast absorption!

cats,fcmz3hh,t3_ei21cn,1577798304.0,I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. Please make sure to have the cause of death verified by a veterinarian. I don‚Äôt mean so sound skeptical but it‚Äôs been an occurrence one too many times a pet mysteriously passes at pet daycares/hotels. Just to be on the safe side I‚Äôd have an autopsy done if your furry baby was in fine health before your vacation. Rest peacefully Berlioz!
