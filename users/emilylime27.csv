Sorry, but this is her natural hair color and it is unreasonable to ask someone to change something natural for just one day of pictures. Even temporary dye; you can‚Äôt predict that it won‚Äôt have negative effects. You asked her to be your bridesmaid knowing she had natural red hair. It is unreasonable to expect everyone to change just for your one day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs customary to ask your guests to wear certain colors but for me that was a weird thing to request as well. Your theme extends to your colors, napkins, cake, dresses, decorations, etc. That‚Äôs all.

I had the exact same wedding theme as you. Peacock accents with teal, blue, green, and purple colors. One of my bridesmaids was also a vibrant natural redhead and she was beautiful. But she was not distracting to the whole ceremony or anything. People aren‚Äôt going to notice. Green is a complementary color of red. It does not clash as much as you think. You are lucky to have a friend with such a rare haircolor, she will add some interest to your photos."

OldSchoolCool,fcmmh4h,t3_ehwkt8,1577781570.0,OP you scared me because your title read like the beginning of a Reddit obituary and interrupted my casual scrolling
exchristian,fcmmb7j,t3_ehs1ry,1577781349.0,"Jeez, are you me? And are your parents my parents? Lol. I could have written this."
exchristian,fcmm89j,t3_ehsutg,1577781240.0,"I am so glad people are finally talking about it in this way. Finally there‚Äôs enough of us to say out loud ‚Äúactually, this is a malignant institution in a lot of ways‚Äù and we can all stand up, brush off the dust, embrace each other and say ‚Äúboy that was fuckin‚Äô weird, right?‚Äù

I‚Äôm hoping more psychologists and psychiatrists and therapists pour into this body of work and give it the legitimacy it deserves, starting with describing it as ‚Äútrauma‚Äù or talking about ‚Äúdamaging‚Äù like as in purity culture and minority ostracizing. It‚Äôs about time the professional martyrs and victims are held accountable for their own victimization."
exchristian,fcmlv8h,t1_fclgk8e,1577780765.0,"They literally do not care about how well you get along beforehand. The Christian subs encourage people to ‚Äújust get married!‚Äù all the fucking time like they‚Äôre the guy in the infomercial slapping that tape on the water tank. They think you should be treating every date like a potential spouse and when you get the urge to have sex with this person you‚Äôre attracted to, just wed them and bed them. Then build the relationship later. Get to know them AFTER you move in together and sign a lifetime commitment to them. their dating pool is already way shallower (and evaporating rapidly still) because of the very picky specific virginal godly boring people they‚Äôre trying to find so they are already settling for the best they can get. 

I mean I‚Äôm no person who believes in one true soulmate or that you don‚Äôt stop learning about someone after marrying them, and life changes during the journey, but a good *foundation* needs to be there IMO. Otherwise they might as well be arranged. How many of them are miserable in marriage? How many women get trapped with a dogmatic misogynistic porn addicted abusive dickhead? How many men get worked to death trying to support 6-10 unvaccinated kids and a wife who sits home and half-ass ‚Äúhomeschools‚Äù some dogshit young earth curriculum while slinging essential oils on the side? Proverbs 31 and 2 Timothy, babyyy! How many of our grandparents were like this, with no way out but death? And how many first time Christian marriages are ending nowadays?

It‚Äôs almost like sex isn‚Äôt even the most critical part, and saving it has no bearing on the health of the relationship as much as fortitude, communication, and chemistry does."
exchristian,fcmkym5,t1_fcmbj66,1577779610.0,"It‚Äôs true. I have to remind myself of the bright side of this sometimes because it gives me perspective and understanding. A lifelong atheist would see the batshitness of belief outright but have a hard time understanding or appreciating what belief or that level of conviction in a fantasy *feels like*, as well as the politics and environment of being in church and the sociological impact on your family and your tribe. 

It‚Äôs likely more impactful, too, for existing believers to see convicted people leaving the fold in dissent and lost faith. It‚Äôs easier to resent the atheists throwing rocks from the outside than to pick up the call coming from inside the house. 

Sorry if some of this doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm an insomniac right now."
aww,fckanjb,t1_fck3irq,1577720994.0,Off topic but does your username reference jun tea? I got really into fermenting drinks for a while.
