In the real world you would ride downhill, gain speed, but then start riding uphill. You wouldn't have enough speed to make it uphill, so you would slide back down into the bottom of the valley. That's because the conversion of energy loses a bit of energy.

But with dark matter there's a near-perfect conversion of energy. The energy you gain downhill is equal to the energy you lose uphill. Or rephrased, the energy you gain downhill is sufficient to get you back up the hill.

I'm playing a song on piano with notes and chords indicating it's in the key of D major (using notes D E F# G A B C#  and chords Bmin, Emin, Dmaj, Amaj, Gmaj, F#min).

But then I realised that those notes and chords are also in the key of B minor. (If I understood correctly, then every major tonic has a corresponding minor that contains the same notes and chords. Cmaj-Amin, and Dmaj-Bmin, and Fmaj-Dmin, and so on).

So how do I know it's not in the key of B minor?

The song ends on B with Bmin chord, but overall it doesn't have that 'minor' feel to it. But those are ambiguous indicators. Is there a rock hard indicator to look for? Or have I misunderstood something about corresponding minors?

I realise it's not important to know if a song is in Dmaj or Bmin. It doesn't change the song. I'm just curious if there's a way to tell the difference."

When ABC made that vote, they had to consider a few options. Who to include? The story was about Klobuchar, so Klobuchar is guaranteed. But who else to include? Apparently they decided to take the top 3. So the final vote options were Klobuchar + 3 democratic front runners + Trump + other.

Where to get the names of 3 democratic front runners? Apparently they decided to go with the top 3 from  https://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2020/01/20/january-poll-results/

For instance, a little googling reveals that 4 weeks prior to this video clip, [republicans gained majority control of both House and Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/104th_United_States_Congress) for the first time since the 1950's.

moraldilemmas,feq17qp,t3_eqd4cg,1579335943.0,"You involve two different aspects. I think it's important to recognize them, and distinguish between them.

- One is people we know, and therefore might be more willing to save, because they're more important to us. A kind of subjective/personal moral philosophy. 

- The other is consequentialism. Am I saving a murderer? Am I sacrificing a medical doctor? What are the consequences of my actions down the road?

I think it's important to treat them separately.

First, the subjective case. Mark Zuckerberg famously said

> A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.

I think that quote is so awesome, because it really makes you think. It sounds terrible, but I think there's some truth to it. Deciding between friends and strangers, I think that's a test of your egocentrism. How do you value your world versus your perception of the world around you? Personally I'm afraid I might lean quite heavily toward saving my friends. We can phrase two questions that make the matter much more cynical and more poignant:

> How much money would you give to a friend in support of a life-saving operation? How much money would you give in support of Doctors Without Borders?

I think my ratio would be very much in favor of a friend. Maybe 100:1?

The other aspect is consequentialism. Looking at the ripple effects, consequences, the future of the saved people, and so on. A problem immediately pops up, that we don't really have perfect information. We can't know all the consequences, we can only make guesses. If we have perfect information, then it becomes an easy question to me: You just do the math, and pick the option with most lives saved. But this option only belongs in thought experiments. Realistically it's not something we can calculate. So I would lean towards saving the greater number of people straight away. But it's a muddy decision in my opinion. I would not sleep well with either decision."

He kinda blasted into a big fan base and that created huge pressure on him to deliver comedy. He had breaks a couple of times, then came back, and now he's been away for a long time. I think he streams more on twitch than he makes videos."

But correct me if I'm wrong, in politics we didn't really have it through the 00's. Sleepy Biden, Crooked Hillary, and dems have begun with Moscow Mitch.
