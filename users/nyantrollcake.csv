trains,feyknem,t1_feykchu,1579446854.0,"Older trains use steam gauges but these ones show an awful lot of information with various menus and sub menus to access all the systems on the train. Keyboard would be too difficult to put in a train cab, let alone a major distraction for the driver if they needed to access a certain system menu. Touch screen is much easier and intuitive. Also a train cab is a fairly cramped space, there's a lot of equipment required to be in certain viewing angles of the seat etc so in order to fit everything in within the standards screens are the best option"

todayilearned,femjlui,t1_femh3j7,1579258909.0,"That's the cost of high speed railways, they require special maintenance because at the speeds involved the track has to be perfect. 
A metro system is usually operating at sub 60mph speeds which allows a lot more imperfections with the rails."
todayilearned,femjhit,t1_femhnwc,1579258737.0,It works for automated trains and these kind of high speed purpose built lines. Retro fitting platform screen doors to existing platforms with manual control trains is extremely costly and difficult. I think a cheaper solution would be more staff at stations who can be on the platform and be able to stop trains if somebody falls down.
