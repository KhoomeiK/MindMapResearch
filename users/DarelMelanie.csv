ENFP,ff1vaf5,t3_er4m1f,1579486968.0,"\*raises hand\* Have had clinical depression since age 11. I've been on medication two different times, and did therapy for around 2 years, still occasionally when I need someone to talk to / check in with / when I'm going through something.

It still comes and goes sometimes, but in general I feel pretty stable and content. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Don't give up, and please look into getting some professional support. You deserve to be happy!"

ENFP,ff1uwbc,t3_er4c49,1579486722.0,"Super similar to my recent post. Lol. Glad to know I'm not alone. I fall in love with everyone.

I don't show it, or pursue it, but I definitely feel it... and it lingers sometimes. x\["
ENFP,ff1uskr,t1_ff1e8b8,1579486659.0,"I'm married too.. and I don't want to be with anyone else.

But like... I feel those strong love feelings with other people - I squash it before ir grows, because I respect my husband. But it's hard for me sometimes, especially if it's people from my past (before I met my husband) where the feelings really did grow. It's not like I would want to be with them now, but I just love them really strongly. And it's extra hard when we don't keep in touch."
ENFP,ff1um33,t1_ff1rvzi,1579486547.0,Might be. Those wonderful daddy issues that are in such high demand. I'm open to this idea.
ENFP,ff1uiq1,t1_ff1bs2n,1579486487.0,I'm guessing you don't share this sentiment.

ENFP,femccuj,t1_fem1csy,1579248369.0,"I do that too. I have an INTJ friend I cant talk to all that often, and when i really feel emotionally constipated i just write a journal entry and pretend I'm writing him an email. 
Our damn extraverted brains"

ENFP,fe3o2vi,t3_enn1ie,1578851226.0,"Omg forever.  If they got in really close, like 5 years to stop thinking about them regularly. Move on yes I can move on to another relationship but I am a very slow healer."

ENFP,fdopbo6,t3_em87qy,1578609861.0,"This is literally my biggest fear. New goal this year is to be bold, honest, and unapologetic. 
I grew up with narcissists so I'm terrified of saying the wrong thing that might set people off."
ENFP,fdop8mp,t1_fdodxbv,1578609810.0,"My favorite thing about INTJs.

I'll take a clingy INTJ please. I need someone that can handle my bluntness."
ENFP,fdop5p5,t3_emh6la,1578609760.0,"The fact that you're better at dealing with others than yourself makes sense to me. We are often so interested in helping others that we can forget ourselves.

However, I think outbursts that intense definitely signal a lack of coping skills. Seeing someone that could help you learn some skills of how to deal with those outbursts - in a healthy and balanced way - sounds like a very good idea, in my humble opinion."
ENFP,fdooq9s,t3_em96uo,1578609502.0,"Both. If I feel sad and stifled with no one to talk to, sad music all the way up and let the tears flow. 

Otherwise yes, up beat music."
ENFP,fdookgt,t3_emewru,1578609404.0,"Still figuring that out bud. And I'm 26. What I've got so far is doing small stuff and waiting for people to reciprocate before continuing to give. 


Have standards of how you want to be treated, and dont give yourself to people who just want to use you up for your attention and care. 


And just meet a crap ton of people so you can pick the ones you like most. Lol.



But I'm definitely still learning."
ENFP,fdoo3i0,t3_em3ems,1578609117.0,Your happy makes me a little happier. Thanks for sharing.
ENFP,fdontiz,t3_emaub8,1578608951.0,"It sounds like you are describing me, myself. I'm pretty sure I have some mild level of social anxiety. Rejection really screws me up too.
However I'm a thousand percent sure I am an ENFP. I am also an HSP (highly sensitive person), with a traumatic upbringing to boot! 

So even though I get along with everyone and people around me say it looks like I make friends quickly and easily... I dont feel like that at all. I'm super insecure and honestly dont really have a bunch of friends. 
I definitely never felt like I fit into the cookie cutter stereotype of popular, happy go lucky, have a thousand friends ENFP.
However I do identify with the emo side stereotype of ENFP. Loving myself one second, then isolating myself and wondering how anyone could ever be my friend."
Shawnmilafans,fdolq34,t3_emeiao,1578607699.0,My most listened to song of 2019 was SeÃ±orita. Lol. I started stanning just before it came out so I'm living my best life over here.
isfp,fdo8c4e,t3_em58uc,1578600644.0,Good on you for bringing this topic up. And all the comments are awesome. Big hugs to ISFPs out there. You have beautiful minds and perspectives and you all deserve to find people who will take the time and interest to listen. I was the first person my ISFP husband opened up to after 22 years of life. The FIRST.

ENFP,fcubmtp,t3_eitq7w,1577977190.0,I understand the curse of being able to live life through everyone else's eyes. I'm having a little break down / break through with this myself this year. I want to be more authentic and not give so many f*cks about what people think.
