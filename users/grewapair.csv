In the US, no one would think about doing this unless you were very sick, and even then, you'd probably call your doctor to avoid the cost if you could.  Your doctor would probably tell you to stay home unless it got a lot worse and would give you the above advice about a fever and such to distinguish it from other things going around.  In China, you''d tell him to fuck right off and head right for the ER.  That's why this Dr. is panicking.  And that's why he doesn't need more doctors.  Few of his patients actually need one.

science,ffdbwoe,t3_eswz5j,1579817586.0,"There are 3 million domestic violence reports every year and 20 mass shootings.  The chance that a domestic violence attacker goes on to be a mass shooter is .00067%.  The chance that they will not be a mass shooter is 99.99933%.  It is therefore a near certainty that a domestic violence perpetrator will not be a mass shooter.

If you think you're going to justify removing someone's constitutional rights over an unsubstantiated report of domestic violence with odds like these, I think you're going to have a hard time at the Supreme Court."

DrainTheSwamp,fcsqh5u,t1_fcs0sjc,1577922527.0,"Great summary.  Complete news to me.  I have a few questions.

So Stevens asks for the missiles back and they attacked him as a response?  i.e. why did they attack the embassy?

You said they were ordered to stand down because the administration was worried the missiles would be traced back to him, but couldn't he also be worried that all of our helicopters would have been shot down, so at that point, it was pointless to try to do anything?  In other words, isn't it possible that Obama was trying to keep more people from being killed, and then he covered it up later with the phony video story.

Finally, Quadaffi was ultimately toppled.  So the original mission was in our national interest, and it seemed like the interest of quite a few of our allies.  Yes, it was done in unconventional ways, but did it contribute towards his toppling or were the rebels unrelated to his toppling?

I'm no fan of Obama, but I try to keep an open mind.  I'm not trying to defend the guy, but I think these sorts of missions go on under the radar all the time.  This one clearly went astray, but I think Trump will look at the bigger picture and not want to cut off any future administration's ability to wage these sorts of missions in the future by prosecuting for one that clearly spun far out of the neophyte Obama's control.  I think he doesn't prosecute."
