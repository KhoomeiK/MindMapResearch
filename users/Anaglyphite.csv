Minecraft,fdgtanx,t3_el76v2,1578407772.0,"first off, I love the overall structure and style for this particular build, that layout is quite lovely. What you do need to work on is block variety, including colour usage and block type. For example, using at least 2 different wood type colours (eg. oak and dark oak) and using one for the walls, and one for the roof, preferably the darker colour for the roof itself. Then there's logs vs. planks, for example, you can use logs as part of your wall structures in certain places, like the bottom blocks of walls. Your use of stone is pretty nice, but I do see a few spots where logs would work as well.

You should also look into other types of building materials, such as brick, or even using polished versions of diorite, andesite, or granite, and having those be floor blocks. A neat trick to save up if you run low on supply is converting them to slabs using a stonecutter (1 iron ingot + 3 stone) and use those to give an illusion of full blocks for flooring. I've exploited this method when building small towns using diorite and granite/andesite for roads and pathways, so highly recommend

EDIT: whoops, forgot to mention shrubbery and plant decorations. If you plan on trying to use grass blocks for them, it'll take some time and patience in survival if you plan on using dirt blocks and not hunting down an enderman with a grass block, since we all know they (dirt) can become grass blocks when in contact with another grass block (takes forever though), so another trick is trapdoors on the sides of those blocks to give an illusion of a garden bed. Look through some minecraft decoration pages, maybe even pinterest as an example, for techniques and tips for exterior decoration"
