Catholicism,ffciog8,t1_ffchoen,1579800292.0,"So it's much more humane to suck out the brains of these children (after you cut their spinal cords to facilitate death easier, then make sure the hole at the base of their skulls is big enough to stick in the vaccuum), dismember them (just make sure you get all the contents for proper identification, a large pan is best for this), or immerse them in a vat of caustic saline (which keeps them intact, but burns them alive).  

Because cages.  You're soooooo Godly."
