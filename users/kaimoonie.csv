And whereas computers may be doing quite well with facial recognition, humans, especially gifted ones, are still superior, since we actually have a part of the brain specifically designated to recognising human faces, the Fusiform Face Area."
AskReddit,fel6dyn,t1_fel4gnx,1579215034.0,"So I quickly hopped onto my computer and luckily I still have the paper :)

So there actually is a test called ""Cambridge Face Memory Test"" (CMFT) that was invented in 2006 by Bradley Duchaine and Ken Nakayama specifically to diagnose facial blindness (Prosopagnosia), and was later also used to find Super Recognisers. It consists of 3 stages with varying difficulty in which the subject first has to memorize one face in 3 different angles and then has to recognise that face amongst 3 different ones. There's also a long version of this.

Then there's the Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT), invented by the same two people plus Laura T. Germine. In this tests the subject has to sort 6 faces in order of similarity to a sample face. They have to do 8 sets normally and 8 upside down, each in under a minute.

I guess there's also other methods, but those are the ones I know. Let me know if you have any questions about this (or just google it, it's super interesting) :)"
