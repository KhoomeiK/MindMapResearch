It sounds like she would shoot her dog. Also... getting training for a puppy can curb oncoming aggression issues. If she paid 900 dollars for a dog she can pay for training."
trashy,ff50zhl,t3_eroq8a,1579577305.0,Also: many people under the post offered to adopt the dog but couldn’t afford the 900 dollars she was adamant on selling for and the original poster did not want to do anything less. She would rather shoot her dog than adopt to loving home because she won’t recoup the money. Fucking trashy.
PeepingPooch,fepoxw1,t3_eqar7s,1579326498.0,I thought you were saying “pipe down” because there was a pipette on the mantel. Then I was like “shit gurl that’s a Saturn V” still cool but a giant pipette would be a sight to see.

cats,fdm64ie,t3_em1lax,1578540721.0,My fiancé is always trying to get the cat to snuggle. I always tell him you gotta act like you don’t want her to and then she will come. Works for me every time. Game recognize game.
Anxiety,fdedhc4,t1_fddqma7,1578336635.0,Wait. This is me. God I’m glad I’m not the only one. Undergrad was emotionally stressful and I got very sick and had to drop out at one point and then I was really behind my peers and I have routine nightmares about undergrad.
trashy,fdcsozp,t1_fdchd0k,1578283220.0,We got a fair fish too! He looked so sad. Once we took him home and moved him to a big tank with a friend. That fish lived for 7 or 8 years. I think he had a good life.

AmItheAsshole,fcwoivo,t3_eiou74,1578031675.0,"YTA 
Would you still love her “perfect skin” if she had stretch marks, scars, etc? If she feels beautiful with a tattoo or a piercing could you support her and try to see the beauty through her eyes? It seems like you are extremely hung up on physical aspects. Unless she’s getting so god awful tattoos that could actually have an effect on her profession, you are just being controlling."
insanepeoplefacebook,fctfh9x,t1_fctd00o,1577941587.0,Putting it on your skin can lessen the appearance of dark spots but this person is clearly not mentally ok and probably was not using it as a beauty product.
funny,fctdtsr,t1_fcr9ip8,1577940105.0,I honestly just laughed out loud and read this 5 more times. That’s the funniest thing I’ve read in a while and 100 percent would not be able to contain myself if I saw this in person
YouShouldKnow,fcnz3hv,t1_fcnstj1,1577821192.0,I’m ok now! I’ve got some  post traumatic anxiety and chronic pain but it gets better with time and I’m very lucky.

insanepeoplefacebook,fcmdodw,t1_fcl3dwy,1577771556.0,It’s called the Dunning-Kruger effect. Basically the opposite of Imposter Syndrome. An inability to recognize their own lack of ability because they do not possess the self awareness to evaluate their competence or lack of competence. It’s pretty interesting!

antiMLM,fcmbt0g,t3_ehs9bq,1577769854.0,I’m pretty sure you could buy the entire candle section at Marshall’s for $129 AND not get scammed.
antiMLM,fcmbaaj,t3_ehxw5h,1577769405.0,I can’t believe I’ve been walking around with these UNACTIVATED CELLS! What the hell. I give them life and my lazy ass cells can’t even activate? Disgraceful
YouShouldKnow,fcmack9,t1_fcm91ip,1577768591.0,Initially entered my spinal fluid due to either 1) steroid lumbar injection or 2) lower back surgery (both were so close together it’s hard to determine the exact source) And from there my CSF and then everywhere it could until I started antibiotics
insanepeoplefacebook,fcm9xi3,t3_ehtgaa,1577768235.0,But we DO know. Just because you barely passed high school biology and don’t understand the science behind vaccinations doesn’t mean ~no body knows~ KAREN!

YouShouldKnow,fcm225o,t1_fclvu54,1577762195.0,That’s... not how this works... that’s not how any of this works.
YouShouldKnow,fcm1iyb,t1_fcltnac,1577761803.0,Yeah I had MRSA in my spinal fluid and subsequently my blood leading to sepsis so... I was on antibiotics for 6 months I think. 2.5 months IV antibiotics and the rest TID for the remaining months. 0/10 would not recommend getting MRSA bacteremia.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcm0xhh,t1_fcl9gas,1577761358.0,"Was thinking the same thing. Died from toe break? Unlikely. Died from chronic disease and subsequent sequela of toe break... possible. Correlation does not equal causation but toe break probably was the first sign of Heath decline. Also avascular sequestrum leading to fluid overload leading to CHF? 

I hope he passed without immense pain and was of sound mind. Sorry for your loss."

Anxiety,fc4gufd,t1_fc4ednl,1577416264.0,"OP, I support you and none of this is your fault. I am exmormon as well. I haven’t been through the exact same experience but similar. If you need to talk PM me. Also check out r/exmormon for support. The person commenting above has no idea what this is like and also is lacking sympathy without realizing it. Some Mormons value mormonism over family. It’s fucked up but true. Some come around, some don’t. Sending positive vibes your way."

Anxiety,fc20ydv,t3_efpztk,1577336156.0,"Brief research results: 1) found an article where ibuprofen was found to have an effect on the nervous system. Specifically the acid receptor of the nervous system. 2) there was a study done on this phenomenon specifically. They used rats and found (I’m paraphrasing a lot) that ibuprofen acts as an anxiolytic (anxiety reducing medication). The also found some connection to reducing inflammation in the hippocampus which is the primary area the underlies the development of anxiety. I’ll link the article.  If you are a science person it’s a pretty interesting research article. I skipped to the discussion and skimmed the abstract because ain’t nobody got time to read about their methods and statistics 

TLDR: there is evidence that ibuprofen does have anti anxiety effects.

myfavoritemurder,fc1xodp,t3_efmn24,1577332929.0,My murderino friend invited me over to watch quote “a Christmas movie or something about murder.” We watched the Bikrham Yoga documentary on Netflix which isn’t about murder BUT is about a culty yoga guru that is very upsetting. Would recommend to any murderino/anyone who loves cults like I do!
Anxiety,fbtg64c,t3_eebgko,1577077729.0,Yes... it’s my tell tale panic attack sign. I have thrown up 2 times due to panic attacks.
