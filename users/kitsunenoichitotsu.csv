Naruto,fduht3t,t1_fduhlw3,1578733212.0,Is that true? I didn’t know.
Naruto,fdu2egj,t1_fdtzkds,1578726307.0,Yes but I thought there were ways without the Gedo Mazo or anything else.
Naruto,fdsxgqq,t1_fdsv71z,1578709208.0,I don’t get it.
Naruto,fdsxdst,t1_fdsx2jr,1578709176.0,"Ōtsutsuki, Hyūga, Uchiha, Uzumaki, Senju and all of their side branches (Hatake, Haruno, Nara, Etcetera)."
Naruto,fdst0uh,t1_fdsssfx,1578707562.0,"How do you get Karma and what is it specifically? Sorry, I haven’t seen Boruto yet."
Naruto,fdssws0,t1_fdssqag,1578707522.0,"Well, yeah but that doesn’t really answer my question. Thanks for telling me that though!"
Naruto,fdssdjm,t1_fdsrnwf,1578707326.0,Kishimoto didn’t confirm that to my knowledge so either prove it or I call a fake.
Naruto,fdss6h9,t1_fdss078,1578707251.0,I still am confused on how that works too😂. Kishimoto kinda has Kaguya surprise us with her presence.
Naruto,fdss095,t1_fdsrjr8,1578707187.0,"I mean, yeah but the only reason Naruto and Sasuke were able to get to her is because she wasn’t experienced in fighting like at all.
Killing an experienced Kaguya is literally almost impossible unless maybe you have the brains of a Nara, Stamina of Naruto, Rinnegan of Hagoromo, etcetera."
Naruto,fdsrgrz,t1_fdsr9ib,1578706987.0,"Funny but that’s not how it works. If you haven’t noticed already, I am quite the fan (maybe even an obsessed one) when it comes to Naruto so I want real answers. Sorry."

Naruto,fdhnr5k,t1_fdhnkk5,1578426537.0,"Yeah, if Kishimoto inputted that into Naruto though, I hope he calls it Hurricane Release lol."
Naruto,fdhn2t3,t1_fdhmu51,1578426136.0,"According to many dictionaries and websites, in the definition of “Storm”, it tells a rain cloud in which usually has wind and lightning. So we are both right than lol. Still though, we haft to abide by Kishimoto‘s rules, making our own would make things canon."
Naruto,fdhlrby,t1_fdhlo6z,1578425341.0,I don’t know about the Nara clan. Shikamaru was Yon Release. But since when did Naruto get Yin-Yang Release?
Naruto,fdhlno1,t1_fdhfqmf,1578425280.0,But storm has lightning and rain. Not all storm have much wind. Water and Lightning fits Storm Release in my opinion.

rant,fd4gmui,t1_fd3xti4,1578167335.0,There are none that are real. A real therapist would understand pain and relate to it. Most therapists are fake.
Naruto,fd3o3v0,t1_fd140ai,1578160186.0,Yeah but he really could’ve informed Tsunade before going on the mission. He could had a team and still have gotten the information he was looking for.
Deppression,fd113kv,t3_ejp9gp,1578126482.0,"I have BPD, said to be the worst mental disorder in he history of humankind. The way I deal with it is be heartless, even in yourself, that includes your own thought. Just be ignorant to negativity, fuck anything anyone tried to tell you, be happy. Even if it means you haft to be hated and shamed upon by all, even if it means that no one will ever trust you again and that you will forever be alone, your happiness is yours to keep. Don’t waste it.
I could help more but I need to know why you’re depressed."
rant,fd0x69e,t1_fd0u0f3,1578124970.0,"The environment can heal. And I don’t care if others desire to live, they are blind, they let their emotions kill them. I won’t let that happen to me. I am my own therapist, my last one didn’t help. One can only know true peace when one knows, understands true pain. A life in peace isn’t a smart one. A life in pain and peace, this is a life of almost perfection. Although, a life in true peace is perfection, we can’t reach that level of happiness. Just saying but why do we feel pain if we are supposed to be happy and evolve? The pain is there so we don’t reach a higher light. By whom is this curse belonging to? You wouldn’t understand. You can choose a path, life or death. Live to help the ascension for all, or die to be ascended alone."
rant,fd0heig,t3_ejlais,1578118826.0,"If you haven’t noticed, yes, there are some who joke, yes, but have you ever taken the time to think that some want out of this life? Or are you to spoiled to know? I don’t have any hate towards you personally, it’s just that I don’t like when someone tries to say we shouldn’t die, when that what we all need. Think about it, what have we done for earth so far? We have fucking destroyed it! War would kill most of us off, the effects of the war will kill the rest, hopefully.
I want out of this pain."
offmychest,fd0gudi,t3_ejlcuo,1578118591.0,As you you know what it feel like to want the world to end.
Naruto,fd0c1j7,t1_fd09948,1578116691.0,"Yep, Kishimoto was prolly jus trynna find a way to play wit our hearts again."
Naruto,fd0bws8,t1_fd08ze0,1578116636.0,Yeah but he could’ve survived! I just don’t understand why someone would want to die and give someone else so much pain while they know they there is a risk that they can’t take it.
Naruto,fczkwca,t1_fczkc59,1578103465.0,"Well, thank you."
Naruto,fczkv2r,t1_fczk4jg,1578103443.0,Yes but like people who know their Naruto and Boruto to an extent that they know everything Kishimoto has to offer.
Naruto,fczjyx3,t1_fczjwdz,1578102891.0,I’m guessing that’s a hard no.
Naruto,fcz9vf9,t1_fcz3sab,1578096606.0,"Ah, I haven’t to that part in Shippuden. Don’t worry, I know EVERYTHING that happens in it (I’ve seen many spoilers). And where did Madara get that advanced of knowledge about a rare eye barely 10-20 people have? Does Kishimoto answer to that?"

Deppression,fcxcpqk,t3_eja4w8,1578059350.0,"I couldn’t help but she’s a tear when I read this because it reminded me of my own stories. Love is war bro, you can’t expect to be with some forever. You always haft to have that doubt in love and if you don’t, it’ll hurt you more than anything when they leave. You haft accept that her life is hers and that it shouldn’t effect yours in such a negative way. Move on, try and find someone else or focus on loving yourself more. Be happy and stay that way, happiness is the one thing I seek for and can’t get so I hate seeing others fail at it too.
I’m always here to talk bro if you need it."

Naruto,fct11k5,t1_fct05by,1577930106.0,But I thought Magnet Release was Wind and Lightning.
Naruto,fcszoxx,t1_fcsznf3,1577929141.0,So what is an Earth + Wind Chakra Nature?
Naruto,fcszgfb,t1_fcsz3uy,1577928972.0,I thought a Sand Release was a Earth-Wind Nature mix.
Naruto,fcswaw8,t1_fcsqn0x,1577926741.0,I thought Earth and Wind was a Sand Release? The Chakra Nature Shiukaku has.

Deppression,fcrz4tq,t1_fcryu33,1577908742.0,Why think about friends if I know friendship won’t last forever? Why think about family knowing the only connection is blood? Why focus on positivity if it won’t last?

AskReddit,fcm1bdo,t3_ehvggv,1577761647.0,"17 of my friends committed suicide during the same month. I had to see some of them as they died. I won’t say who did it but they did it because their family was poor, their house was taken from them, they’ve been bullied and cyber bullied for all of their life and that they’ve been raped.
Yeah, their sister also committed suicide afterwards in which I saved her life six times for the same reason before her death. I felt bad for her boyfriend, who was also my best friend. I was dealing with suicidal thoughts myself at the time. I still do, kinda. “Being alone really lets you know that all you have is yourself”, this saying is very true. I miss the old days. Sorry, there is a lot more but I really don’t wanna keep talking about it. Besides, I’m not good at storytelling."
