Lesson here is same as always, your employer will fire you the second they think it will help their profits. No warning, no two weeks notice, no one gives a shit you just had a baby or bought a house or moved to a new city for the job or donated a kidney. You’re toast. So I find employee loyalty laughable.

The tents block the entire sidewalk; they’re surrounded by garbage, urine and feces, a few of them openly use drugs. Hard drugs, you can see them cooking with a spoon and using needles. One direction towards restaurants no longer feels safe and actually isnt safe because now you have to walk on a busy streeet to go past the ever increasing number of tents. 

I think cities should be able to control where people can camp/live when we are talking about public space sidewalks because allowing these tent communities for homeless folks means taking these spaces away from day users/commuters/workers and likely hurting surrounding businesses."
