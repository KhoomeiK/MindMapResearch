keto,fehg6o6,t1_fehfqm9,1579115872.0,You as well!
keto,fehfau8,t3_ep39mk,1579115353.0,"I started 15 days ago and yesterday was the first day that I felt great. My appetite has decreased significantly where I am only eating lunch and dinner. I also find that I am not able to eat the same amount of food as I used too. 

I feel very happy that I was finally able to make it out of the weakness and see what everyone was talking about. The only negative is that I seem to have a harder time sleeping but more overall energy which is weird.

I am now down 11.5 pounds and notice a reduction in my stomach which seemed bloated previously. 

My only craving is popcorn which is strange but good. 

Keep up the great work and know there are lots of us just like you grinding everyday to become better versions of ourselves."

mississauga,fe2u9qs,t3_enmv2f,1578842931.0,Leave your phone on silent/vibrate mode and it’s no big deal.
aww,fe2d8d0,t1_fe2ckph,1578837108.0,I can’t watch it as it makes me sick to me stomach
aww,fe28mr2,t1_fe27rbf,1578835642.0,"Great point. I love animals so much and it really is a horrendous situation. Tough to stomach. 

Let’s hope things improve quickly."
aww,fe28dkm,t1_fe27dql,1578835537.0,"So true, they are vulnerable and have no clue what’s coming. I honestly can’t watch the videos on the news. I hope things get better ASAP."
aww,fe26d0f,t3_enlafg,1578834980.0,This breaks my heart. I consider myself a pretty tough guy and this stuff guts me. I feel for the people in Australia but the animals just break my heart. Prayers to everyone including the poor animals.
keto,fdyxq9i,t3_end649,1578784640.0,"Great work! I am 11 days in and have been doing very well with cravings and eating well. Toughest part is feeling weak for me. 

I actually love the food we have been cooking and can’t wait to see how I look in 3 months. 

I hope your journey is as good as mine. Hopefully you have lots of losses."

CasualConversation,fcn5sqo,t3_ei3j0g,1577804027.0,That is so great to hear. Hard work and a great attitude go a long way in getting what you want. It sounds like you are in for an exciting journey and I wish you all the best.
AskReddit,failqvv,t1_faila5a,1576110921.0,"Where do you have to go to get the food handlers certificate? I assume it is through a city agency? Get me the name of it and message me privately. I can reach out and see if I can pay for the certificate for you. I am in Canada so it might take time to send a money order. If there is another way, please let me know."
