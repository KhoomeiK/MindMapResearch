AskDocs,ff6mt6k,t1_ff5zvqs,1579630546.0,MALS! Join the Facebook page. It’s an amazing group of people. And if you don’t have MALS they are very knowledgeable people on there with other intestinal issues that can lead you in the right direction. They even have a list of doctors that you can see to treat you. I’m getting MALS testing in two weeks. Been sick a year with pain when I eat. I try to avoid fruits and veggies and eat things like soup and mashed potatoes. On really bad days I just do liquid protein drinks all day and I get relief. I’ve had millions of tests and has my gallbladder removed! It’s a long process and you have to keep asking for testing. A vascular doctor tests for MALS. Also look up SIBO and Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. PM me if you need but I strongly strongly urge you to find the MALS Facebook page. Greatest resource I have found in a year. Best of luck.
