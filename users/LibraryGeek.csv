relationships,fe10vwd,t1_fe0lfqr,1578821294.0,"Really, most are very bad for you when ingested. Unless we are talking about herbal essential oils which are made from edible plants. But some companies will tout how pure their essential oils are as a way to say they are safe - but that makes them \*more\* potent and thus \*more\* dangerous. Also be aware that some visitors to your home/business (especially if a business) may have reactions to air born essential oils.    
"" Contrary to what several essential oil companies recommend, the oils generally should not be swallowed, Power says. The body absorbs more this way, boosting the chance that they will interact with medications or cause an allergic or toxic reaction. Even continued exposure to small amounts (a few drops a day in a water bottle) can lead to fatigue and headaches. Taking in larger amounts of certain oils -- like tea tree oil, wintergreen, and camphor -- can lead to throat swelling, a racing heart, vomiting, and even seizures, says the Tennessee Poison Center, which saw the number of toxic essential oil exposures double from 2011 to 2015.

Meanwhile, essential oils like eucalyptus and peppermint contain compounds called phenol that can irritate the respiratory tract if inhaled, particularly in babies.

And recent research by scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that lavender and tea tree oils contain estrogen-like and testosterone-inhibiting properties that, if overused, could lead to abnormal breast growth in young boys.""  


Again, this is generally with overuse but a few drops here and there add up.

TalesFromYourServer,fe0z4yi,t1_fe0trrq,1578820620.0,"If you are trying to say ""basic minimum wage"" then maybe you don't know that tipped professions have a different (and \*much\*) lower minimum wage. Also the employer has to pay out the equivalent of minimum wage over the course of a week - not for your meal.   
The fact is that when you knowingly go into a tipping establishment (one where you are served) you \*are\* agreeing to pay the waitstaff for their service. As long as they provide decent service you owe them pay. Would you refuse to pay a lawn service or any other service because you don't have enough money? No. You do not hire a lawn service if you cannot afford them. You mow your own lawn. Same with eating. If you cannot afford to have someone take your order, make recommendations, bring your food to you, maintain your drink, clear your table - then you eat at a non tipping establishment such as a fast food place or at home.   
No one is saying you have to pay for bad service and no one is saying to pay an exorbitant amount for meh service. They are saying you don't get to do the equivalent of hiring someone and not pay them.

todayilearned,fdqjapf,t1_fdpvu3t,1578668052.0,"Except that we do not \*have\* a free market and large corporations do not \*want\* a real free market. They want regulations that small operators cannot follow. They want regulations that allow them to cut corners and focus only on making money. Corporations don't 'just lobby against bills, they lobby \*for\* regulations that benefit them over competition.   


When your allegiance is only to make money for a certain group of people (share holders), you cannot make any moral choices.  If you would save money by cutting on employee safety, money demands you do so. If money demands that you take the cheapest way to dispose of waste, regardless if it will pollute local water sources - you must. If money demands you find the cheapest workforce - you go overseas. You have no allegiance to a country or a group of people.  There are actually laws that says the shareholders can sue a government if they did not take an action that would have either made more money or saved more money. We need government regulations to provide guardrails preventing us from the cliff that this ""free market"" would drive us off of. Otherwise, you have to have faith that your shareholders hold some moral standing that says they want workers treated fairly, environmental damage  to be considered, etc. That is \*highly\* unlikely. You cannot depend upon a small group of (usually relatively wealthy) shareholders. They do not have to consider the interweb of second and third level consequences on the population as a whole. they don't have to work within the large picture the way a government does. Shareholders never will. Customers rarely will.   
There are few businesses that are as \*large\* as US federal agencies. Amazon would be the best example, and they are rife with employee treatment issues and safety issues. They have been repeatedly looked at because they emphasize speed over safety - including delivery drivers. They have nothing but the external laws to make them consider how their drivers' dangerous driving can impact the people around them.  Money does not make them reconsider the absurd rules about toilet breaks for example.  (it is reported that breaks are timed even though bathrooms are quite a walk in their enormous warehouses. The times set and limits for number of breaks are unreasonable for menstruating women for example. Money does nothing to correct for that. Money would say you cannot hire women because they need 3 more minutes for a bathroom break. Money alone would even encourage the use of undocumented workers over workers who cost you more just in required benefits. Even now we catch large corporations outsourcing to companies that are shady because they are the ""cheapest"" and surprise surprise they are using people who will have to do anything in order to stay  in the US.  Thus, they don't complain if the work causes them to injure themselves for example.   


Whereas in the government, there are systems and regulations for doing everything, including treatment of employees and the environment. Governments do run system improvements and modernize. Efficiency, accuracy and financial records are inspected periodically. But they are the last to get the latest technology thacould improve efficiency and security. Why? in the name of money."

Most of the ways to access nature require a car in the US. Our public transportation sucks in most cities and is non existent in smaller towns. I assume you are not from the US from your use of kilometres :)   


My wife and I used to tent camp at parks where you can pull your car right up to the area you are camping and you don't walk far at all.  I know you don't have a car so it would be harder for you to drag in everything you need to camp softly. Your area is large enough for essentials, usually enough room for 2 tents. There is usually a table and bench and fire circle. We used a blow up mattress rather than just sleeping bags. I knew I would pay a little later but we reduced the consequences. Our focus was on just enjoying nature from the camp spot. The only issue I had was that sometimes you have to park and camp a walk away from the bathrooms. Since we had a car we drove to and from the bathroom when we needed. So this is something you might aim for when one of you gets a licence :)   


See if any small local par have picnic tables. We have a local park when you can pull your car up very close to pavilions that have a grill (or 2) and picnic tables and trash cans.  We have a tiny county park at the end of my street that has a couple of picnic tables and trash cans (no grills) so check before taking raw meat!
