I do not murder anyone. 

Don’t even hurt anyone. 

But the attempt was made. 

I’m 0% of the time going to be charged with murder bc the criminal act didn’t succeed. 

What I would be charged with is attempted murder.

The reason for that is bc the act of making the attempt is also a crime. 

That crime is the one that I succeeded at, therefore that is the crime I would be charged with."

And that’s my point. You aren’t charged with murder if you fail bc you didn’t succeed at the criminal act of murder. You get charged with attempted murder bc that’s the criminal act that you succeeded at. You succeeded in making an attempt. 

Edit: same with intent to commit murder. You get charged without even attempting it bc you succeeded in the criminal act of intending to commit murder."

The criminal act of attempted murder is the attempt itself. 

The criminal act has to succeed. 

Conversely, let’s say I intend to commit tax fraud, but I fuck up entirely and do my taxes 100% correct and pay the appropriate amount. My intent doesn’t mean shit bc no criminal act was successful.
