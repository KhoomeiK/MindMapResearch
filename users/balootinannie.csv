Merry Christmas everyone!

I just got a msi 1660 ti and im having the whole boot drive problem. I select my boot drive and it says

 ""reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected booy device and press a key""

Ive watched countless youtube vids and have been going for two hours with nothing working

Any ideas?"
