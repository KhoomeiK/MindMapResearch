BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff9wa5o,t3_ese7r8,1579722900.0,"This feels a little forced. While movies are great, and generate a lot of attention and hype for the IP, imo it should be more organic like ""Oh, we've come up with a great new movie story to work on, really looking to flesh this out""  
Instead we know something's coming and it'll just be like ""oh cool, another movie""   
Just my two cents."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff94cvb,t3_escg6m,1579704544.0,"It's near enough 80 chapters. They could definitely fill a whole season with just PH and JT arcs, with a little set up for the Liberation chapters. Any more would feel extremely jam packed, for a full season imo."
Warframe,ff91ep3,t3_esba4c,1579702424.0,"I'll probably make a more fleshed out post myself, but personally what I'd like to see is for Empyrean is to connect all the dots, a real time Connect 4 if you will.   
Picture this: ""Tenno, the Corpus have been working on a new stealth Jackal prototype, in the sea labs of Uranus. They know we're coming, but you need to Sabotage their efforts, go there now""   
You hop in your Railjack, fly to Uranus, fight through the defending air support of the corpus, and break through to the planets surface, beginning the aforementioned sabotage mission. After smashing all the prototypes, you get a message.   
""Oh no one of the things escaped and is gonna kill the women and children of venus, rush to fortuna and save them tenno!"" Which you fly to and down to Orb Vallis and fight one, saving Fortuna and getting a cool part for a new frame.   
On your way out of orbit, what's this? A Corpus capital ship has arrived, knowing you'd break their new invention. 

Captial ship battle dun *dun* ***DUNNNNNN***

DestinyTheGame,fez1r7f,t3_eqspwd,1579453098.0,"I'm still of the mind that, while Titles are cool, there needs to be a way to display the fact you have multiple.

I've only racked up just over 1k followers in something around 1100 hours streamed, mostly because while variety is the spice of life it isnt for streaming lmao.   
From whatever my perspective amounts to, you need to be able to pique a new viewers interests immediately, because the attention span window is seemingly dramatically lower without a point of interest (your cam) to relate to. As long as you can consistently do that, people will stick around if you're what they gel with, and that's basically all there is to it if what you offer is what they're after :)"

A *lot* of people gave me those withering looks as you'd expect, and it took most of the rest of the class for the atmosphere to get less frosty. No idea what drove me to make the joke, I'd only found out a few days prior about his situation and up to that point I didn't even know he was married.

It would be nice to have 2 different engrams to differentiate old/new players, with vastly different loot pools respectively.   
For new players, the old engrams are excellent for picking up items for no cost they weren't around for. For old players, as you've stated, the engrams are worthless for us.   
A new engram, with only a chunk of dust in and maybe a few other select items would be much better.   
However, the main draw of them would be a token with a fairly low drop rate which guarentees you a new item of your choice from the current seasons EV stock. This would both stop the engrams from being immidiately invalidated, and provide chase for us older players."
