## What is HIV reporting?

Beginning June 1, 2000, doctors and laboratories are required to report to the State Health Department all cases of HIV infection and HIV illness - as determined by CD4 and viral load testing - in New York State. Since 1983, doctors and laboratories have been required to report AIDS cases. Since people usually live for many years with HIV infection before they develop AIDS, all cases of HIV infection and HIV illness are now reported to better measure the size and makeup of the HIV epidemic in New York State.

### What's Required?

Doctors and labs must report to the Health Department the names of persons with HIV infection, HIV illness and AIDS. Doctors must also report the names of sex and needle-sharing partners of people who test HIV positive that are known to the doctor.

### What's Voluntary?

* Getting an HIV test.
* Giving your doctor or the health department the names of your partners.

### What Choices Do I Have?

You can work with your doctor to decide the best way to notify your partners.

[*Back to top*](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/providers/regulations/reporting_and_notification/about_the_law.htm#Top)

## What is Partner Notification?

Doctors are required to talk with HIV-infected patients about their options for letting sexual and needle-sharing partners know they may have been exposed to HIV. Doctors should discuss the three options for partner notification. These options are: have the counselor from the Health Department's PartNer Assistance Program (PNAP) or Contact Notification Assistance Program (CNAP in New York City) tell your partners for you without ever revealing your identity; tell your partners with the help of your doctor or a PNAP or CNAP counselor; or tell your partners yourself. If you choose to tell partners yourself, a PNAP/CNAP counselor will work with your doctor to confirm that the partner was told. If PNAP/CNAP cannot confirm this, they may also follow-up with you or your partner."
