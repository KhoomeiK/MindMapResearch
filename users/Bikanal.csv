explainlikeimfive,ffcm8az,t1_ffcgfw5,1579802434.0,Checks already have ‚Äúdollars‚Äù written At the end of the line. You would just right ‚Äúone and 50/100‚Äù on the line in this example
pittsburgh,ffbu4fr,t3_esp4jv,1579782806.0,Is this their retaliation for the pathetic fines they were given not too long ago?
television,ffbr8c3,t1_ffboe6h,1579779557.0,I thought the shoehorned comments were pretty bad too
Frugal,ffabwnl,t3_esij90,1579731903.0,How is it free? Did you not buy the potato? What about the gas that you use for the oven? Were you using the oven for something else?
happy,ffaa6er,t3_esb1fm,1579730894.0,"This is a fucking repost, I saw this posted months, if not years ago. And of course the OP‚Äôs account was just created....

Fuck you, OP."

Miyazaki,ff2y95f,t3_eraanm,1579528448.0,Except North America? üò¢ What sad news.

necrodancer,fenc6k2,t3_eq27vg,1579281550.0,"The music is what makes this game special to me. 

1-3, 4-3, 5-3 are great. Dead Ringer is really special, and phase 2 of Necrodancer is a banger."

bujo,feh18x5,t3_eoo8j9,1579107026.0,How is this calendar minimalist? Looks like a normal Calendar to me.

personalfinance,fegmp2y,t3_eot6r3,1579097403.0,Can we sticky this post? I feel like this sub gets bombarded by these questions and we aren‚Äôt even in the heat of the tax season yet...
fixingmovies,feepd07,t1_feens1q,1579038410.0,"Losing your whole family does not necessarily mean someone else fills the void. 

Even with your point, I never saw their relationship as loving. Sure they cared for each other as friends, but I wouldn‚Äôt go so far to say they loved each other."
fixingmovies,fedd9f9,t3_eog9w6,1579008248.0,I kind of like this idea. The whole thing in Endgame between Hawk Eye and Black Widow trying to get the stone didn‚Äôt make sense to me since the sacrifice had to be the person you loved the most. I never saw their relationship to qualify in that way. Ant-man and the Wasp would definitely qualify and would probably make that sacrifice more impactful.

bujo,fdlglfw,t3_ely5mt,1578523575.0,Best way to make sure that you can contribute $500 a month is by creating a budget where you allot the funds so it like you never had the money to begin with. I maxed it out for 2019 this way and I highly recommend it.
notebooks,fdkv7dr,t3_elwcqy,1578511836.0,I tried moleskine a long time ago and didn‚Äôt understand the buzz around it. I agree that the company is a lot of fluff

financialindependence,fcyojlw,t3_ejkqwh,1578083927.0,"Wow, the similarities between you and me are surprising. Same city, school, and profession. I had a slower start though after graduating in aug 2014 by getting an administrative position. It‚Äôs interesting to compare numbers! Is the business analyst role in pgh or DC?"

CrappyDesign,fcqp1o6,t3_eihdy9,1577889855.0,"If you consider this a crappy design, how would you suggest the design be improved while still using balloons ?"
Frugal,fc8zy7g,t1_fc8zo8f,1577544808.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure why this is a frugal thing either. FICO scores are pretty much only for taking out loans. How is a loan a concept of frugality?"
ghibli,fby90mv,t1_fby3ywy,1577211024.0,I have them tucked in potted plants. The ones that can‚Äôt stand on their own are either snug in the soil or leaned against the plant :)
