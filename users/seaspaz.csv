Whatcouldgowrong,fezzag7,t1_fexzjzd,1579463468.0,"This reminds of the book ""celestine prophecy"". Its put in a way more mysterious and almost magical way but that book was incredibly helpful if you take things with a grain of salt. In the book everyone has control dramas for ""stealing energy"", there are 4 types, the aggressor, the poor me, the interegator and the aloof. Its almost like rock paper scissors. The point in the book is to break from your control drama and do basically what you were saying, verbal judo. The book gets really far out there near the end but my god its one of my favorite reads."

BattlefieldV,fdxswc7,t3_en7aq4,1578772542.0,"Alright, im going to be honest here. Im really tired of seeing these kind of posts, theres been so much negativity on this sub that its starting to get to me, i really like bfv, it needs some stuff to get fixed no doubt, but man it really feels like the posts here are only shitting on the game when i really actually love the game even with its problems. As far as this particular post goes ive had many games start like this, but five minutes later the teams are even, i mean you can clearly see the game hasnt started. Every single post here is just about how bad the game is, i get it i guess, the people that are posting this stuff are diehard bfv fans and so anything that is wrong with the game becomes a major thing to y'all. But damn, if the game is really that bad, dont play it or play some of the older battliefields. Whenever i play a game too much i get fixated on any problem because i know the game inside and out. Ok well this is my opinion, i would really like more clips to be posted to this sub, because ironically at this point, i want this sub to get fixed more than the game itself.

Tldr: i really love this game and all these posts are bringing the game down for me. I appreciate people bringing light to problems but when it becomes the only thing that is posted it dilutes it. If you want devs to actually listen, balance the negativity with what you guys love about the game. Because if the devs only see people saying how bad their game is then they will feel like its a lost cause, ok this is not tldr"
