peyups,ffboa21,t3_espugz,1579775428.0,"Hi op! Pro tip: have an extrovert friend to apply with you :)  if pwede, have the mems interviews with that friend and you'll learn how to initiate and continue a conversation. 

It's also helpful to state to the members that you're not really the talkative type, they will appreciate it. Sila pa magwewelcome sayo and they will make you feel comfortable. 

I'm speaking from experience. Good luck :) grad na ako and I regret not joining more orgs hahaha"

AskReddit,ff2pzqk,t3_erbsdb,1579518670.0,"One time I went to a store and bought a lot of stuff. When I was walking home, the plastic bag handle snapped and all the stuff just splattered on the sidewalk. I was an awkward 9 year old, so I just stared at the floor the whole time and looking at other people walking by for help without uttering a word.

A man just sitting outside his house saw me, understood my silence, and managed to give me another bag and helped me to put all of it inside. Again, being the awkward kid that I was, I just smiled without thanking the man. I still feel bad that I forgot to thank him."
