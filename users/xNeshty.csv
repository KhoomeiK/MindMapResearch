ADHD_Programmers,fdn59wr,t1_fdiapcs,1578577667.0,"Alright, sorry for the late response - to be genuine I simply forgot to check back into reddit yesterday (luckily we're in a sub already where you may understand why haha)
 
I see - a personal assistant similiar to Alexa etc. is something that I always massively disliked, for the particular reason you stated: Privacy. While many always focus on the ""I'm not really interesting enough, if someone wants to listen to my daily talks idk"", my main issue is what can be processed from all the information. And until there is no clear ruling how my data is allowed to be processed and what may result from it, I'm against personal assistants like Alexa.
 
But a personal assistant where the code is open source and my information isn't ""shared behind the curtain"" would definitely be something interesting to look into. Especially if the main goal of the framework is to generate data that I can build my own applications upon or (as you stated) to extend it and easily add commands I need. The latter is someting I have loved with my jailbroken iPhone, as I was able to add my own siri commands (ie. run ssh commands on certain keywords).
 
Before even going further, if you really want to share your framework with others, it is important to understand your target audience. From what I understood, your tool is probably only suitable to other developers. The platform your building on, the way you've described your application and from my feeling, in the current state, the average doe will simply have no idea what to do with it. And for that specific reason - given that you have no commercial interest in it - I'd suggest to host the application on github. Beside the obvious benefit of others being able to ""stumble across"" it and suggesting improvements/solutions, it is a very helpful way to become involved with a community and understand who is really interested in your application. Obviously it will cause overhead on your project management, simply because many people provide useless information or ask ""boring"" questions from the perspective of the creator (yours), but your application **could** benefit heavily.
 
The design based on what you've described sounds pretty neat - properly organized and presumably easy to extend. With the source-code given, many of us could help you if they really have an interest in it.
 
Taking your statement under consideration that clients are easily created, it may be beneficial to have multiple clients on different platforms as well. Maybe a quick documentation on how to interact with the server and someone will create the client on a specific platform themselves and request to push it onto the github server.
 
So, to keep it short - thanks for such an detailed description of the application. It sounds pretty well organized and actually useful for someone who was always interested in a personal assistant, but doesn't want to depend on an service provider. I think getting the application production-ready and posted on github may actually result in a solid traction. Make sure to invest some time into documentation before tho.
 
If you decide to post the source-code, let me know - would like to take a look on this ;)"

If the latter is the case: Does it crawl through literally every note on a phone, collect all health information, etc? If so, why? Is it just to gain a dataset to look through and hopefully stumble across some patterns?

I'm not trying to discourage you, but it kinda sounds like something you (as in you as an individual) probably could play with, but noone else really without grasping the data crawler you built? Or can I use your crawler in my own application via an API or built my own application upon for my custom needs (hence why you call it framework)? Maybe release it for the exact purpose it serves - to generate a huge pile of data of oneself to look through, rather than going 5 steps ahead already and thinking about what you may or may not want to add.

I'm not telling you this to anger or embarrass you, I am drawing such wrong conclusion way too quickly occasionally too. Everyone does.

There **was** on a previous FW, but on the current console gen FW - which again, is necessary to play online, where you want to use an aimbot - there is 'no hacking'. Noone with some knowledge argued that there has never been a hacked FW. I've literally [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/eijbv0/player_using_aimbot_in_ground_war_needs_to_be/fcrtq2w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) this.

csharp,fcuoqpt,t1_fcu9rkw,1577985475.0,"Use WPF if you're learning and building your first application, because WPF is what you will work with the most in the future. Also, in WinForms you may learn some some 'bad habits for WPF'.

WinForms should be considered for stuff like 'I just need two buttons and a text field, no fancy gui nor will this tool get bigger', in which case WinForms offers quite some benefits. But as soon as you need to scale the application, you're going to have a hard time and invest alot of time just for UI. Lots of business application still rely on Winforms tho, so it's still good to be able to work with it. Microsoft also maintains it, but new features are morelikely to be expected in WPF.

Learn both, but favour WPF at the beginning."

> The fact you're using the term ""jailbreak"" speaks volumes to your knowledge of the subject matter.

Just because the term is mostly used in relation to iOS, doesn't mean it's restricted to running unsigned code on (and only on) iOS. In fact, all ps3 and ps4 cfw's and exploits can be found by using the term 'jailbreak'. Educate yourself and actually look things up, instead of just blathering about theoretical stuff."

modernwarfare,fcrtq2w,t1_fcrrwey,1577906494.0,"> That's a cool story, but wholly irrelevant to the point.


I don't think you understand my comment dude. This guy could be on FW 5.50, where a jailbreak existed. He could have used some userland mods on 6.20 even. But unless he has a way to spoof the FW against the PSN, he will not be able to play against others on the latest firmware - and there is no such spoofing.

So while there did exist full user-friendly jailbreaks on earlier Ps4 FWs (where your video could have been recorded on), these cannot play against the average doe who updates his ps4 because he couldn't go online otherwise.

Beside the fact that you took so long to finally provide a video, it's worth dumpstershit. It's like showing GeoHot's iOS 3 jailbreak and claiming you can install custom themes on iOS 13.3.

Just because you was able to use an aimbot on an arbitrary FW, doesn't mean there is a hack available right now, such that you playing casually online could result in meeting with an aimboter.

> This development lifecycle exists for all malware, hacks, and exploits.

That is correct. And at them moment, we're in the stage where all exploits are patched and we're waiting for a smart person to release vulnerabilities for the latest FW. Until then, you will not meet someone online using an aimbot."
modernwarfare,fcroaw2,t1_fcrjj4y,1577904429.0,"You're both making claims, you both need to proof your claims. Just because you're incapable of proofing your statement, doesn't mean shifting 'the onus of proof' to the other side makes your statement suddenly true.

Beside that, it's way easier for your claim to be proven if you could just link a single ps4 kernel exploit or a tweet by someone who announced to own one for the latest FW. But there is none public available. The latest vulnerability known which led to userland exploit is on 6.20 found by lokihardt and used by SpecterDev to release the exploit. There is no single Kernel exploit publicly available dude - if you claim there is, you gotta proof it, because 'proofing there isn't' would mean I have to proof the ps4 FW 6.20+ contains zero exploits. That's stupid dude.

Fire30 has released 6.20 kernel dump strings, which you can conclude to him having an actual 6.20 kernel exploit. But for anything above 6.20, noone even shared such dump strings, let alone release some vulnerabilities or PoC for an exploit."
