baseball,ff9pmlp,t1_ff9loqi,1579718125.0,You've got a guy who is well liked in the organization who has managed throughout he minors and also was supposedly integral in breaking down the analytics for the players last year for the Mets. Basically he's exactly what you're hoping for in this situation. I wish him the best of luck.

Games,ff0d9z9,t3_eqzfxs,1579467812.0,My father owned and operated a boardwalk arcade during my youth so gaming has basically been in my blood my entire life. I don't truly become a gamer until I was like 8 or 9 and my cousin lent me a bunch of ps1 RPGs. The first one I played was Star Ocean 2nd story and it's still one of my favorites.

TheCircleTV,fehfvv6,t1_feg9edp,1579115695.0,Exactly. They may have casted better for that roll but liked Ed too much to find someone whose mom they liked more. They could have also nudged them to do something different with it too.
baseball,fehffsc,t1_feh2jn3,1579115432.0,.  *  in shambles. I'm trying to get people to use just the symbol. They don't deserve an actual name.
TheCircleTV,fehbarf,t1_feg5awx,1579113020.0,Makes sense. She's the one thing he got to bring so she's just about as useful to Ed as a ping pong paddle and ball is to Shooby.
NYYankees,feh8nr3,t3_ep4it2,1579111431.0,No way. Trivia music is playing during mine.
NYYankees,fef298o,t1_fef26ge,1579046469.0,Good! The idea is to have as many as possible to.

baseball,fef0pg8,t1_feelgpe,1579045443.0,"Same bias. *'s players were haunted by ghosts at NYS and were quoted as basically saying as much in 2017. We were cheated out of a Dodgers Yankees series. No idea who wins that. But if there was no cheating, it's hard to argue the Yankees lose this series."

baseball,feab4jl,t1_fea6gpb,1578946508.0,Yep. And Astros players were talking about how the environment in NYS was so crazy it was disruptive to them.
aww,fea3lke,t1_fe94qf2,1578943998.0,He's very anxious here. Not agressive anxious though. I work in vetmed so I've seen those eyes daily.

baseball,fe9yfcm,t1_fe9vphx,1578942585.0,My take as well. The punishment needed to be steep enough to deter anyone from trying to use a system to cheat over a prolonged period of time. This punishment doesn't do that. Make it a $50 million fine and lifetime bans for  Hinch et al and I'd be cool with that.
SquaredCircle,fe9808l,t1_fe7l7vy,1578935181.0,Hell even PCO would be great as a Dark attraction.

TheCircleTV,fdl6hhk,t1_fdl5bgp,1578517868.0,I'm sure for some. But part of what this show demonstrates is how different every one is. As some are clearly casted because they play to some stereotypes but it's edited in a way to show you more wrinkles to each person as time goes on.

TheCircleTV,fdkuwx3,t1_fdk4i31,1578511664.0,It's because he's never been popular or handsome or athletic. He's in such unfamiliar territory that he doesn't have close to the vocabulary that Adam should have. At least Rebecca sounds mostly authentic.

I was watching for the first time intentionally in ages and that had nothing to do with his health. I just wanted to see these three go at it in what is probably the biggest quiz show ever.
TheCircleTV,fdkngn4,t3_elp367,1578507222.0,Yo Adam is the worst catfish ever. He just used the word romp. How does that sound to any of them like a word a 27 year old uses?
