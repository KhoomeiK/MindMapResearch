depression,fekw76z,t1_fekhgvg,1579208869.0,Here in the Canadian prairies it was the coldest place in the world for more then a few days. -50 last night. I feel bad for the animals stuck outside. It's only -27 now though so its back to normal at least
worldnews,fei7j5e,t1_fei31nt,1579132025.0,That's scary hey. I feel so bad for animals like deer and stuff out here. I hope this dies down quick just for them.
worldnews,fei07ca,t1_fehoxni,1579127450.0,Holy shit. And here in the Canadian prairies its brutally cold. Gonna get down to -50 tonight with wind. Fuck everything about this.
AskReddit,fef1o4c,t1_feemnsf,1579046081.0,Yeah 9 flat beers? Fucking gross. I'd just drink the 12 after my days done. Like I did for 10 years

funny,fdvgqty,t1_fdv9zct,1578747228.0,No shit and I love seeing the reasons people use to justify it. Oh sometimes I forget a vegetable so I need to look at the 3 screens inside the fridge to make sure... I dunno if I was super rich sure I guess. But I'd spend like a grand at most today
todayilearned,fdsdbgt,t1_fdscknx,1578700037.0,That sounds like alot of fun actually
personalfinance,fdqq8hn,t1_fdqlr20,1578672541.0,Then can anyone really afford a house by that logic
personalfinance,fdqq3vi,t1_fdqky3x,1578672460.0,That's my mentality. I love my cat and hes well taken care of but 5 grand for a surgery? Sorry buddy we had a good run. It just seems more realistic to me. I can get another cat for 50 bucks.
ABoringDystopia,fdqpn7o,t1_fdq6gbq,1578672169.0,Your right. Most ended up in horrendous factories and mines.
worldnews,fdowc2a,t1_fdomot1,1578614361.0,Yeah there's alot of theories floating around but it me it just seems like incompetence. The minute I heard about this I thought yeah some mid level iranian anti aircraft guy fucked up hard. I cant see what Iran would remotely gain from this. Its terrible for sure. But also a national embarrassment for Iran so I cant see it being intentional. To me it seemed obvious from the beginning but I didnt want to rush to conclusions
history,fdn0k85,t1_fdmpsl9,1578573517.0,"Beef isnt exactly poor. Not like rich but where I live chicken and pork are cheaper, beefs mid, seafood tends to be higher priced."
history,fdn08r2,t1_fdmykrx,1578573199.0,Holy shit I never even thought about that

depression,fdme3qr,t1_fdlf0x9,1578546921.0,For me it's a bridge but to each their own
worldnews,fdmd7k1,t1_fdm9kks,1578546145.0,This guys a total piece of shit but I kind of agree with you on this one. Not like it matters I guess. But this dudes bombarded with all kinds of info all day of course hell get something wrong. I guess hes got everything wrong so far. I guess hes the human equivalent to seagull shit but I get this one.
depression,fdlceg0,t1_fdlaf2o,1578521028.0,"Lol none. You'll think it's all good then wake up the next day, realize you didnt succeed cause your body is surprisingly resilient. Then just wither away of organ failure in a hospital. Or you'll choke on your own vomit like that guy said. Then piss and shit yourself. Then probably get found by like the 1 person who actually gives a shit about you.

Were all gonna die someday. Some sooner then others. Dont rush it."
depression,fdlbzmg,t1_fdlajg3,1578520780.0,I dont do it cause everyone else was doing it. I've been a straight up alcoholic for 10 years. This isnt new to me. And I'm not on lithium. Might be moving up to it soon though. I drink with people I drink alone. Doesnt matter. Been trying to quit. I dont drink quite everyday anymore. How I'm still alive I have no idea. Drugs work accidents car crashes. I dunno
depression,fdl9nhi,t1_fdkk22j,1578519410.0,Honestly acid is pretty fucking intense. It can be amazing but can also be truly terrible. Watch yourself with heavy hallucinogens

Boomerhumour,fcvkopr,t1_fcvkkac,1578004155.0,America lost. Vietnam's still communist. Their only legacy is all the unexploded bombs and landmines kids are still stepping on to this day. I dont know why I'm talking to you.
Boomerhumour,fcvjv59,t1_fcvjms9,1578003643.0,What big difference did vietnam make though?
Boomerhumour,fcvjftg,t1_fcvj8vi,1578003382.0,Multiple wars with most kill counts? Vietnam's not really close. Not from an american stand point especially.
Boomerhumour,fcviwzj,t1_fcvi3a5,1578003059.0,Wars with most kill counts? World war 1 and 2.
Boomerhumour,fcvh8ae,t1_fcvahfs,1578002037.0,Boomers didnt fight the wars though. Their parents did

Cause yes we're in for trouble, so get ready and do something about it. Join a movement of some sort, get into environmental law. I dunno do something, or dont and shut up. Dont just bitch on reddit."
worldnews,fcbw7ac,t1_fc9wmg6,1577591647.0,That's pretty much what I do. It doesnt keep me up at night.
worldnews,fcbvjdz,t1_fcawkui,1577591442.0,Yeah I've never met an obnoxious vegan in real life. I hear so much about them. I want to meet one to see what all the fuss is about.
worldnews,fcbsbxp,t1_fc9q9j3,1577590423.0,"Yeah I dont mean go punch a cop in the face. I mean have a goal, a movement, an idea you can stand behind."
worldnews,fcbs57d,t1_fcaj7rb,1577590362.0,"No shit! Like all around on this god damn site is defeatism and depression. Go join green peace. Join some kind of movement.

worldnews,fcbreec,t1_fc92q3k,1577590132.0,I'm becoming a paramedic so at least theres some kinda skill set there. My cousins becoming an environmental lawyer.

bipolar,fcaqiv1,t3_egxqbe,1577574592.0,I'll be honest. It didnt work out for me. She ended up cheating with my piece of shit roommate after we fought and that was the end of that. But I know some people have had better experiences
worldnews,fc8w45v,t1_fc8rqu6,1577542983.0,Fuck that. Fight. If that fails then consider that option after. Not first.

bipolar,fbfo5pk,t1_fbdxkm4,1576815659.0,"Holy shit same with me. Word for word my uncle said ""that's no excuse"" when I first told him I was bipolar after he had picked me up after I got fired from a job a couple months ago. I was just manic and drinking and gambling and didnt give a shit. Then he gave me a religious speech. I knew then that that relationship took a dive. First thing you say is that's no excuse really? If you want to push people away thats how you do it."
