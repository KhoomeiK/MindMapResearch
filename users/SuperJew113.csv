The woman riding in her friends convertible pulled into our drivewsy, presumably to turn around. Peter was getting out of the truck to go inside, the woman was like ""YEA WE'LL TURN AROUND IN YOUR DRIVEWAY, DON'T YOU SAY SHIT! WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK!

Peter looked at his truck snd said there's no dents in it. She then apologized loosely. But when Pete told me this epilogue, I said well the dumb bitch forfeited $500, I guess her parents didn't rsise her to be smart, or ethical.

Oliver North didn't go to prison, Fawn Hall didn't go to prison for shredding documents. No one went to prison for lying to the country to drag us into a war with Iraq. How often on youtube have we seen cops do conduct that gets us ordinary peons 25 to life, that they get acquitted and a commendation on?

I watch The Big Short and he says ""Oh comeon, this is criminal, even for Wallstreet"" but no one goes to prison, instead they call their lackeys up in the Halls of Congress to grant the banks a big bailout but don't use the bailout to help out any peons with underwater loans.

Affluenza kid. Brock Turner. Only reason Madoff went to prison was because he stole wealthy people's money. If he ran a payday loan outfit he'd be living it up in the Hampton's right now for the same grift.

Boeing 737 MAX CEO another example. He gets $60,000,000 for being fired. He should be in prison, he's a corporate lockerbie bomber.

I'm at a truck stop right now, if I see a transgender I'm not going to be rude as shit because there's a m2f transgender. Everybody gets a long that way, particularly in big cities, people.find its just better to have a mutual standard of respect no matter what thejr background, society functions better that way, why I think there's more left wing politics in cities than homogenous rural areas. You can be rude as shit to outsiders, and there's no real consequences there, I think they do think more tight knit and tribal there. Sundown Towns would be a great example of that.

If I do look at people in a different lense, its much more economical and power based. When there's a societal or government failure I punch upwards. I blame those at the top. The buck stops here. Well whys my healthcare insurance costs through the roof and doesn't cover anything? Somebody way up top is failing and is in a position to correct it but chooses not to. Why'd the Boeing 737 MAX crash twice? And whys  Boeing's CEO getting $60,000,000 leaving the company after his plane killed 346 people? I find clear, direct faults in those at the top of society, and I question them, heavily if necessary.

In regards to pedophilia...no, I do not look upon pedophilia as a ""protected sexual orientation"". Because there's the concept of consent. Sex must be mutually consensual or it is a crime. And i dont think any child below 18 is a good number, has the agency to give consent on matters of sex with adults much older than themselves. The only real.exception I make.to this is Romeo and Juliet crimes, bf 19 and gf 15, well that's not the same bf 40 and gf 15. 

Most left wingers I know we do place an enormous emphasis on consent which is mutually exclusive from pedophilia. 

And you are right. When I see Clinton, Trump, Prince Andrew, all hanging out with Epstein...yes we may need to look into what's going on there. But these are powerful men, and if you don't believe Epstein killed himself I wouldn't either, why was the security camera? Whys his neckbones broken?

I'm not just going to blindly defend Clinton because ""he's on my side"" but the least I would expect from someone on the right is not to do the same for Trump.

Except for bottom of the barrel friends for a time, never has a tight circle of friends in my locale. I'm socially awkward. I have a sharp tongue. Ive met a lot of GREAT people through the internet and trucking who tell me Im a good guy.

Im kinda stunned I got so many downvotes. I guess the downvoters are people who arent crying at night because they've been entirely alone since adolescence and never had a significant other. If there's a subset of people who have a decent reason to visit sex workers it would be people like me. The loneliness, it crushes my soul, and it just makes me so god damn sad, its always with me. There's this one girl I like Ive known since high school, I always have a great platonic time with her, and when I get home I cry because I know I would have been profoundly happier in life if she had ever found me attractive but that was never in the cards. When I hear the song ""Just my imagination"" by the temptations, that's me and her in a song form.

If I'm not doing well with women I say i have no right to bitch unless im actively improving myself, so I went out and got a good middle class job, another new used sportscar that I like a lot, lost 50lbs, gonna lose another 30 hopefully, have just recently quit smoking these past 5 days after 11 years so I can regain lung function and workout again. I just say Im not fuckin good enough so I have to try harder to meet their standards.

I don't talk to women well, or pretty much every woman I met that I liked has said ""we should just be friends"". Ive never met a woman who seemed to care about me, if I attempted to communicate with they'd treat me like I was a chore they didn't really like. Never met a woman who might say Blow up my fone because she's crazy about me, those women don't exist.

Any hare brained scheme I come up with gonna be pickup artist bullshit, which isn't respectful to women. I'm an egalitarian, disdain misogyny, very pro-reproductive health rights for women, have a concern about the disadvantaged. Im not a broski if you will, or a frat bro. I'm a bit more of a loner.

Im so bad at talking to women, I just want to put on a shirt ""I'm James. I'm single and looking for a girlfriend. Inquire here"". Because I flat out suck at introducing myself or making a first move, I just assume they're not going to like me.

I just figure I'm not fucking good enough and I have to respect that they hold high standards for who they wanna call their bf.

Now iirc Obama's last EPA Head was a woman with a background in environmental sciences, qualified for the job and acting in the best interests of the public at large.

Trump's epa head is a former coal industry lawyer who worked under Bob Murray of Murray energy, and the epa is a regulatory agency tasked with regulating the environmental practices of industries like the coal industry.

Now only to the most blind partisans of Trump could someone not see a clear conflict of interest a coal industry lawyer, runs the epa, and decides to ""relax"" regulations on the coal industry. This is a clear cut case of regulatory capture. If a libertarian type tells me government doesn't work, they're right when private industry causes government failures like regulatory capture. But that doesn't mean that private industry is inherently superior either since they have a very direct hand in the government failure. The libertarian wouldn't want to hear this that the actual solution would be to remove private industry from matters of governance over that of removing government.

It was like 12 am, I think this might have 2012ish because I was playing Red Orchestra 2 and it was relatively new. And I was having a blast playing it. Prolly february or march or so. And all of a sudden all the power in the house goes off. Nothing. Shit I wanna get back to gaming. Half an hour goes by, no power I'm dicking around on my cellphone to pass the time. 

So finally I call the power company up. Ask them what's going on? They tell me a car hit a pole in my neighborhood. Ok that's kinda weird.but it is what it is. 2am the power comes back on but now I'm too tired to game so I go to sleep. I wake up the next day, and within 12 hours, someone had already erected a memorial to the young man who lost his life hitting the power pole outside my neighborhood. It was a windy 25mph road and he was doing 60 and fundamentally roads aren't engineered for safely traveling at excessively higher speeds over speed limit, he lost control, and the moment the power went off in my house, was the moment that young man had his life snuffed out from under him.

You can say he drove like shit, he had it coming. I'm a more empathetic person, I don't like seeing violent ends to other people."

Per my article it's mainly a right wing problem. And islamic religious conservatives tend to be the ones doing terrorism, so in their own societies they're the conservatives there.

But transcending beyond simple left and right wing politics theres also a strong component of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism can transcend both left and right wing politics but the authoritarians in this particular society tend to be very right wing.
