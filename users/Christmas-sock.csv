It was my first experience with basketball, as neither of my parents watched. Pop became my idol and I still love everything about him to this day. 

I grew up about 20 minutes from the Warriors stadium in Oakland, so naturally I gained a liking for the team. Those were some Goddamn tough years we had to endure, but we all felt like family watching Monta and Jason Richardson play their hearts out, even if they came up short of a W. I dont even get me started on watching the skinny, broken ankle young man that was Steph Curry."

>>Even as a slip of the tongue, this odd phrase betrays Romney's true lack of understanding, knowledge and comfort level on women's equality. And besides the binders comment, there are several problems with the story Romney told Tuesday night.

>>First of all, it is not true. The ""binder"" of women's r√©sum√©s was prepared before the election by the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, a coalition of nonpartisan women's groups. When Romney won, the women -- not in binders -- gave him the r√©sum√©s.

But as you can google now, it turns out the binders were real and CNN was just spreading fake news apparently"
