Yeah, it may not everybody's favorite UT game, but it was fun for its time and helped paved the way for UT2004. From what I can see, it's been signed by Epic's Tim Sweeney, Andrew Scheidecker, Shane Caudle (I think?), and Cliff ""CliffyB"" Bleszinski. I can't make out the signature above CliffyB's name, the one on the right, or the one in the upper right corner, so your guesses are as good as mine."
