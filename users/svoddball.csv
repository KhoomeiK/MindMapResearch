Ended up spending the rest of the week I was there going in groups of four entering small ravines or bushes looking for them. So many close encounters because of the weather was aiding them in hiding but my word there was a lot of them around.

AskReddit,fegvry3,t3_ep364k,1579103637.0,"Some things I would like to see high school teach are some life skills and things work. Seriously some people I come across it either wasn’t taught or it never sunk in. But here is my list:

A little automotive stuff not big things tiny stuff. Like how to check your tires’ air pressure and how to check the oil...how to check the oil...how to check the oil and that vehicles have a maintenance schedule. Sure some schools may have automotive class but until I had a job working with a car rental company...I never knew how many people did not know that vehicles needed oil changes...or thought that cars that needed oil changes were poorly designed. That BMWs did not need maintenance ever, never ever and as such never brought them back for service from when they bought the thing two years ago. Sure the turn signals are a cosmetic thing but come on. Maybe that last one was because we were located in a BMW service Dept building that was shared out with a number of other manufacturers. 

How to pay taxes after getting a job and how taxes relates to things people get/use. Too many people I wanted to slap for saying things like Obama give me money and not the government or taxes doesn’t pay for my assistance. It’s like they believed Obama, or whoever was president at the time, literally wrote them a check every month to live on. Plus, the IRS are dicks...sometimes.

That there are alternatives to colleges such as trade schools. And how much both options cost. How to look for colleges that may suit them, help them look through programs offered and if possible school tours. Differences between community colleges, state universities, private and for profit schools. That last one can’t be allowed to be grouped with the phrase “allowed to exist at any point in our future.”

Average pay trends for jobs types and not just the phrase college student graduates just make more money...on average with whatever degree. Which is a good way to tone down those random degrees in some random study that when you ask the student what job/volunteer work that degree is going to get the student they can say something other than, “I dunno.” Plus, the question of if you graduate are you going to be able to survive as an adult and pay off your debt if you had take Loans. 

How loans work and who is responsible for paying them. What happens when you don’t. APR and credit cards aren’t free money.

How the economy works such as how minimum wage (since livable wage is a recent thing for my interns) effects businesses. Or how a surplus of job seekers in an area may push down wages in that area. Supply and demand. How automation is going to affect careers and how sending jobs from one country to another changed their’s.

Pretty much the last year of high school should just be how life is going to punch in the face as an adult. Or take a couple of pages from Gabriel Iglesias."

Like what’s the point in getting a part time job for 20K a year (for easy math) if you can get 40K in government assistance plus whatever under the table paycheck/benefits you get from being in a gang. Seriously when I was looking for a job after moving to the states from Japan I had hell of a time at first and went to an unemployment office for help with my resume and watched as three people walk out of the office saying they would rather live off of government assistance than get a full time job at 33K a year because the government gave them 43K plus health insurance. 

Even if, IF, you manage to ban guns doesn’t mean that’ll it will stop the gangs from just moving over to the next available weapon. Like take Sweden last year their bomb squads had responded to over 100 bomb blasts as in explosions and it was barely covered for those in the west. Oh, blasts as in actual explosions as a means to intimidate other gangs. At least according to the Guardian. If that doesn’t work knives, spoons, cars or a flying bicycle wheel."

Take for example Rwanda and Sebrenica those were considered massive failures then we have in 2016 where UN Peacekeepers refused to come help aid workers as they were being raped by local militias.
