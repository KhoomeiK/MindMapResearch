EVOO on top.     1.3 lbs if he‚Äôs gotten plenty of treats that day , which is usually freeze dried treats.  95 lbGSD.   I should add powdered egg shell and egg."

dogs,fek0sbn,t1_fek0bld,1579190160.0,"This is the first I‚Äôm hearing (and from you )equating dog -dog aggression with aggression towards humans.   Nowhere else till now have I read this or come across this. In fact, when people talk about aggression, they are very specific about where it is directed.   The original comment just said that once a dog gets a taste for fighting other dogs, it makes them more aggressive.  The adrenaline is itself a reward."
dogs,fejzuhv,t1_fejx8mk,1579189579.0,"I have a working breed dog as well.  And while he has a high prey drive he‚Äôs a lamb with people.  And you know very well that certain methods are used in training  to increase the prey drive.  What I was saying is the phrase  ‚Äútasting blood‚Äù does not deserve that retort. It may not be well expressed, but it‚Äôs understandable."

dogs,fejwjlg,t1_fejuyct,1579187482.0,"I‚Äôm
assuming what they mean by  ‚Äútaste of blood‚Äù is  that once a dog feels the adrenaline of chasing/ fighting it becomes more prone to going into that zone.  The  drive gets stronger and stronger.  That‚Äôs how most working breeds are.  And fighting breeds are trained this way as well."
dogs,fejw8j4,t1_fejoagy,1579187285.0,They were very  irresponsible.
worldnews,fejvr03,t1_fej9wne,1579186966.0,"It‚Äôs also a way for people(red hats) to insinuate the other country or person is insignificant, not worth knowing about or getting along with.  It‚Äôs again just plain old racism, and hate.  But the ironic thing is the dumbness is just plain stupidity. They are all emotionally and intellectually vacuous people."

Trump will ""deescalate"" and work out a great new deal with the great country of Iran.  And everyone can applaud him. Both sides get to claim victories for their people."
worldnews,fdivmxt,t1_fdiumb0,1578452059.0,It‚Äôs been debunked.
worldnews,fdivjx0,t1_fdiutlk,1578452003.0,"It‚Äôs not just about publicity.  They‚Äôre aware how much Americans (except for trumpers) are against this escalation by trump.  Trump has been criticized vehemently at home, and investigative efforts reveal no ‚Äúimminent danger‚Äù as trump claimed.  It‚Äôs to the future benefit of Iran  to continue to try and befriend Americans.   They want to progress beyond this handicap  that has been imposed on them economically as well.   And courting American public is beneficial to them.  They‚Äôre actually pretty shrewd in understanding that Trump  and his cabinet are not trusted at home and a majority want Trump removed."
