I work with charity organisations to increase donations and so having been on both sides of the fence, all I can say is thank you for supporting such a wonderful institution."

YouShouldKnow,feu6z7j,t1_fetsc57,1579383750.0,"I live in London and go regularly to the Science Museum (have an annual pass now) but there is really no pressure to donate if you don’t want to/can’t! Museum staff here are super chill, just smile and say “thanks” and walk past if you don’t want to donate that day :)"

BPDrecovery,feg5gyq,t1_feg45m3,1579077822.0,"Thank you for your apology, little troll. Your life seems so sad!"
FTMMen,feg3vbj,t1_fefylqm,1579075738.0,"Hi, I was in a similar position once and wanted to make a few points. 

1. Your email can’t be “changed” but the sysadmin can make you a new one so get in there quick and request that it be altered. It’s a very quick process, don’t worry.

2. Just set up a meeting with HR. Take a list of everywhere you’ve noticed your deadname in place of your actual name and remind them (succinctly) that although this may have simply been ignorance on their part, you feel extremely uncomfortable when your deadname is used. 

I don’t know which country you’re in but in the UK I tend to state two pieces of legislature that protect trans people from a) being outed and b) being harassed in the workplace. Works a treat."
BPDrecovery,feg3o7c,t1_feg3lvq,1579075495.0,"This is just so funny to me don’t worry you’ve exceeded your limit as humour fodder for the day. I have to go to work now but Godspeed, little troll. Delight in your inane pursuits, as only imbeciles can."
