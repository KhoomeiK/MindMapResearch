rupaulsdragrace,ffals68,t3_emofh2,1579738933.0,Honestly it has holes... But who don't love holes. I didn't hate it at all and in fact I thought it got better as it went along. Except the last ep ended really dumb imo. It felt rude tbh lmao. But it was good overall I really enjoyed. And aj really wasn't that bad like I get it her shit got old but like idk get over it. It wasn't like trying to be some intense thriller it was light hearted. And it was literally pregnant with cameos. Much love.
worldnews,ff9k5yc,t3_es53v6,1579714727.0,I swear to God every headline sounds like it's from the onion what hell dimension are we living in
rupaulsdragrace,ff9i7y7,t1_ff9dzmt,1579713568.0,Wow I wish I didn't waste my reddit premium I would have golded this lmao

movies,ff659dv,t3_ertfkx,1579619451.0,Just like Spiderman movies they keep making these like it's some joke I don't get
stevenuniverse,ff5p4v5,t3_erjx2g,1579604240.0,Tbh this is high drag
StateOfDecay,ff2mppp,t1_ff2c4us,1579513645.0,When NM is not challenging enough? Fuck my face you're truly the definition of METAL.
todayilearned,ff2h2uc,t1_ff2fg63,1579505836.0,"Yes hemophiliacs, as described in the documentary bad blood, which is what I said. The post was about a singular person, and the replies I read sounded pretty shocked this happened to this singular person. See also ""a lot of people"" which fits your hundreds. But thanks for your receipts sis."
todayilearned,ff29lvw,t3_er6hp8,1579497886.0,This was actually quite common and a part of a larger problem. It's described pretty in depth in the bad blood documentary. Lots of people receiving infusions were from contaminated blood. It happened to a lot of people. This wasn't an isolated incident.
deadbydaylight,fey8uyg,t3_eqwfsg,1579442247.0,"OK it's probably not gonna be fixed and this is the  1 millionth post about it, not that this is particularly upsetting or anything. Your game was probably more upsetting, tbh. But thank you for reminding me to unsub from this place."
Witcher3,fey8khe,t3_equ7tz,1579442124.0,I'm pretty sure you fail the collect em all quest if you do that without finishing it? Or at least that's what happened to me but it's my first playthrough. Either way somewhere between me finishing that and something else I failed the quest.
rupaulsdragrace,fev86kj,t3_eqlj9e,1579394352.0,I fucked so many 'straight' guys in college smh
rupaulsdragrace,fer7ud7,t3_eq4e39,1579350916.0,Ugh I still have to watch this season and idk where to. If anyone wants to slide into my dms with a suggestion ty for being fishy to the fish

rupaulsdragrace,fem7v11,t1_feluts1,1579242916.0,I was gonna say this is good. But it's Friday.
worldnews,felpjk3,t3_epmvr1,1579227806.0,They diagnosed me with sepsis a couple years ago but I didn't have insurance and didn't wanna pay for pip/tazo which is one of the common abx used for treatment. So I was discharged against their recommendations (which I do not suggest whatsoever). I survived but idk if it's because my body fought it off or they misdiagnosed me (assuming the latter because I probably couldn't have). Even if you manage to eliminate it before it starts shutting whole organ systems you have the concern of many health problems down the line. Still worried I will like develop osteomyelitis or endocarditis or something down the line.
food,feloryi,t3_eprvln,1579227280.0,I would literally eat this whole thing omg
movies,fejjf50,t3_epbh4o,1579176788.0,"I've seen it a bunch of times now and have showed it to a few people. Incoming spoiler but the ending of the movie?


When they got out upside basically, do you think they really escaped?"
AskReddit,fejip4a,t3_epdqvi,1579175971.0,"So many repeats but I can't find terms of endearment. The soundtrack. It makes it feel like one long seamless life for the main character. It's INCREDIBLY HEAVY and only gets worse. Like it's like tragic and then it one-ups itself. Such a great cast, too."
rupaulsdragrace,feit3df,t3_ep5dkv,1579146498.0,I don't even remember the original song now tbh
aww,feikv2g,t1_fei34ye,1579140888.0,Fine eat it

rupaulsdragrace,fehe3pu,t3_ep3hiy,1579114657.0,This subs off season is hit or miss. Between this and micromanaging and policing who wants to post here?
Witcher3,fefpv4e,t3_eo5zxx,1579061836.0,I sell everything to their respective master craftsman in crows perch and novigrad as in making armor with them they always have money. If they run out buy diagrams.
Witcher3,fefpger,t3_eokhkx,1579061536.0,The base game and dlc were on sale just recently so I would recommend to keep your eyes peeled for it again.
Witcher3,fefo6yt,t3_eousst,1579060663.0,"Did the same thing and it was kind of an uphill climb figuring it out. There is an in game tutorial you can do I think? Not sure I just kinda winged it. I would recommend going into settings with the back button and lower the difficulty until you get some decent cards. Your default cards with make it so agonizing to win on the standard difficulty. Spies are a big play, and decoy to take spies played by the opponent and use them."
Witcher3,fefkd7k,t3_eonc6a,1579058170.0,In the beginning you have like no cards and I lost so many matches before I realized you can turn the gwent difficulty in the settings. After you get some decent cards it's not bad but if you have like just infantry like what can you really do?
Music,fee7w9l,t3_eonvva,1579028225.0,I saw guster live as an opener for Ben folds and was completely blown away. Hadn't heard of them before. They are really good live as well
deadbydaylight,fed43uh,t3_eo9dan,1578997851.0,Is it sad I always assume it's mockery? This community blows
AskReddit,fecxjct,t3_eo6l00,1578988648.0,I used to show up late and just casually stroll by the office in the entryway which is where you sign in and whatnot. There was a suite for the music kids which was usually just unoccupied rooms and I would just linger there for whole periods doing nothing. Right after I graduated they got mad cameras everywhere. Pity
deadbydaylight,febkt8b,t3_eo93mb,1578959869.0,I h8 that I love this so much ugh

deadbydaylight,fdfx14z,t3_el04s6,1578372534.0,My relationship with Dbd/bhvr is dead my new lover is literally any other game with devs who are awake. This was literally the last straw for me I can't believe I bought that stupid battlepass and every dlc like what is the money going to other than breaking the game with bandaids to critical flaws and ignoring the other ones. WILD.
deadbydaylight,fdft0cy,t3_el4stw,1578369463.0,Survivor objectives are braindead and require no skill idk why they even call them skill checks. Now they don't even need to look at the TV.

deadbydaylight,fdfrh5u,t3_el4wt7,1578368413.0,No its not and expect more next patch!
deadbydaylight,fdfr9p2,t3_el57jw,1578368274.0,Yeah honestly this just ensures killers will be playing like proper cunts and I can't even be mad. I swear more people whine about noed on this sub and now you can almost guarantee you'll see at least a 25-50% increase in noed use imo. I usually play really fairly but now buckle up kiddos prepare for tunneling strap on your ds.

deadbydaylight,fdcs0d2,t3_ekj4rp,1578282643.0,"Yeah solo queue is such a random mishmash of dumbasses and groups of 2 or 3. Last night my team got murdered by a doctor while I got every hooksave, cleansed 3 bones (I run IS), and did 3 gens. So I ask what were my teammates doing? He ended up closing hatch so I walked up to the door he wasn't gonna let me leave like I wiggled out and I knew he was gonna down me so I 360'd and got a perfect 32k game. Everyone else was <8k. Ugh."

deadbydaylight,fd4zdtk,t1_fd4qnt5,1578172690.0,"Look I'm just saying if you didn't do bones don't get shocked by noed. It's a base game perk. If it does pop you can either be good and save who gets the first hit by it or dip. At that point most of the points are made you probably pipped already and if you didn't you were a potato.  Besides most totems are like obvious if you aren't new to the game (other than some maps lerys comes to mind for me) I don't even HAVE to look for them. And if you're getting found looking for totems you were probably gonna get found doing gens, too if that's your argument because you can't play immersively or last in a chase.  🤔🤔🤔"
deadbydaylight,fd4mhl6,t1_fd4hzps,1578168897.0,"Well, now you know. 🤡🤡🤡"
deadbydaylight,fd3x9mw,t1_fd3wxjn,1578162406.0,If between 4 survivors you can't do 5 totems maybe you deserve to die. 🤦‍♂️
