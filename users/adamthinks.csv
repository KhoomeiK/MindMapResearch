MMA,ffapqpb,t1_ff5z790,1579741608.0,"Hell, some of the best fights in UFC history are on the undercard. I can't imagine being a fight fan and *not* being interested in watching the undercard."
news,ffamugs,t1_ffajkiu,1579739657.0,"That's not what he meant. Biden is polling better overall in a hypothetical general election against Trump than Bernie is. In the 2016 primaries, when certain polls showed Bernie polling better against Trump than Clinton, many of his supporters suggested people should vote in the primary for Bernie because of that. He's saying that now with Biden polling better, he's not seeing Bernie supporters shifting their primary vote to Biden. I don't think he expects that to happen ( nor do I, personally I'm wanting either Warren or Sanders), he's just pointing out the hypocrisy of those individuals previous argument."
news,ffamezn,t1_ffaapy6,1579739364.0,"I see it all the time here. People talk about Trump voters as being tremendously stupid. Saying things like, "" Think of someone of average intelligence, half the population is stupider than them. There's your Trump voters."" Yeah, no. Sure they're being incredibly stupid for buying Trump's obvious bullshit. But everyone else is just as susceptible to manipulation as Trumpers have been, and it's demonstrated over and over on Reddit every single day. People want to just believe things and move on.  They don't take the time to read articles, verify sources, and discuss with an open mind. I can partly understand why, it's not a skill that's taught well. And life is crazy busy. When there are social systems set up to vet things for legitimacy, that isn't as much of a societal hindrance. In the age of clickbait and Facebook likes though,  it becomes extremely dangerous for society."

The things Bernie is running on though is very popular with most of rest of the populace so it'll be a hard go to convince them otherwise. They'll certainly try.

nfl,ffa0a07,t1_ff9m754,1579725279.0,She's made over 30 accusations against people other than Peyton also. And they were also pretty suspicious. It seems pretty clear she's been chasing a payout to stay quiet from someone who doesn't want to deal with it. It's a reasonable question though that certainly shouldn't have been down voted.
nfl,ff9zs50,t1_ff9k4f3,1579724987.0,Also it seems likely all he did was moon someone else while she was nearby. That's what the only witnesses I've read about have said. She also has a long history of accusations (over 30) and seems very unreliable. I'm not one to dismiss sexual allegations but this one seems pretty clearly bs.
MMA,ff8gltj,t1_ff7s21y,1579677568.0,"I'd kinda like to see another angle of that.

I don't think the users that are doing it are aware of how much of an echo chamber they create and how much it throws off their perceptions of the rest of the country.

Also, PPV buys have been down since ESPN + started. It's harder to buy, so less people have been doing so. Having said that, since ESPN is part of Disney and publicly traded, I wonder if the exact numbers will come out at some point."

MMA,ff4njnd,t1_ff4mg0s,1579567940.0,"You know why. People like to hate on social media. When they get an opportunity, they run with it. This seems especially true with some black public figures. If you notice a black person getting criticism for something that someone else wouldn't, or at least not nearly as passionately, there's a reason for it and its racism. Those individuals (and I have no idea what percent it is, it could just be a very vocal racist minority) don't feel like they can be public about it, so they eat up the opportunity to publicly hate on a black person."

MMA,ff4kns1,t1_ff4hzj5,1579565925.0,"It's not a reason all of his detractors dislike him, but it's part of it. Racism in general is taboo, and many don't want to be very vocal about it so they hide it behind phrasing or other means. I see this showing up with black public figures often in that when silent racists have an opportunity to hate on a black person, they do it with gusto. Again, this isn't everyone, but it happens. If a black person is being criticized for something to a level you wouldn't see were they white, there's a reason for it"

It's also pretty clear you haven't actually looked at any of the tweets in question. I don't understand why you think you have an opinion worth making public on this issue if you aren't actually familiar with it at all.
SquaredCircle,ff4fa12,t1_ff479nl,1579562218.0,"Bulking cycles (this is unrelated to steroids, though he's certainly doing that too) where you eat at a calorie surplus are common for building muscle. It gives your body fuel to build with, and there's a hormonal shift that allows you to build muscle easier. When done, you diet off the excess weight.

SquaredCircle,ff1kg7h,t1_ff1iifu,1579480627.0,"On general, you could be right. People tend to move on from things pretty quickly these days. Especially on social media ( including Reddit). Look at how few people talk about the LeBron China thing now. Now, she has a couple things working against her here that could change things. One is that outside of the hardcore, no one knows who she is. There isn't enough fans of her to overwhelm the criticism. Second is that she's female, and while people don't often speak of it, Reddit is hugely misogynistic on the balance, and hatred for female stars in any entertainment medium tends to fester. Just look at Rhonda Rousey. And she never did anything particularly wrong ( being somewhat of a sore loser is not the end of the world and certainly not congruent to the backlash)."

SquaredCircle,ff0385b,t1_fezj9pv,1579464737.0,"You're right in a sense. It is WCW as competition forcing them to change that people are thinking of.  It wasn't just that they were competition though, they were leading and beating WWE for a very long time. WCW was the #1 company. WWE needed to change or there was a very real chance of them failing. With the network and their more diversified revenue, that's not anywhere near a current concern. So while they will certainly be more motivated now that they have real competition, I wouldn't expect any sort of real major overhaul unless AEW completely takes over and network subs absolutely plummet as a result. We aren't anywhere near that happening yet though. If AEW were to somehow hit on a major angle/star that broke through  significantly to the mainstream, their ratings started beating RAW and Smackdown regularly and by a lot, and their popularity started overshadowing WWE, only then would I expect Vince to truly change things up in a meaningful way. I don't expect that to happen. I'm thoroughly enjoying AEW though, so as long as they keep being entertaining and putting on great matches, i'll be watching. I really don't care about the rest."
