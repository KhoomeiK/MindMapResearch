Mind you that this was a minimum wage job and they asked me how much I want to deduct out of my paycheck. I said I want no deductions as I don’t have money to feed myself let alone feed a child. They said that it’s mandatory that a deduction is made. The minimum is $0.25 per check. Being that back then we were still in a recession and it would take 6 mos to find a new job, I bent backwards and let it slide."

What is the point of Impeachment if 

1. The senate has to vote him out of office. When a senate majority is full of republicans, that is never going to happen. 

2. He can be re-elected and do more damage to our country than he already has. 

3. He is still capable of starting a fucking war leading us to another recession. 

If this guy is sitting in the Oval Office then, impeachment is nothing but a fucking label."
