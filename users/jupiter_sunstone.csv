askwomenadvice,ff3swjt,t1_ff3p0gg,1579548143.0,"The golden rule can go out the door on an instinctual level when ‚ÄúDo unto others‚Äù means putting yourself in direct harms way. ‚ÄúThe Golden Rule‚Äù is beautiful in theory but the reality is that a situation like that is dangerous and complex. 

OP is not contributing to her own problem- OPs problem is not one of a domestic violence situation. OP has a stalker. Those are two very different situations that overlap in their similarities only because dangerous men and public transportation are a factor. 

I hope that no harm comes to you if you ever do feel it necessary to intervene on behalf of someone, and I hope that should you find yourself in that situation your courage would encourage others to help. It is unfortunately doubtful to me that that would be the outcome, but what‚Äôs the world without hope?"

DV is extremely dangerous, and there is nothing you could have done overtly except *maybe * call the police, but honestly if he saw you calling the cops it‚Äôs just likely that he would have hurt her worse and hurt you."
askwomenadvice,ff30avy,t1_ff2h3gz,1579530215.0,"have you been on any major public transport in a major city? Announcing out loud that you‚Äôre calling the cops is probably a great way to get your ass whooped, by a variety of people. 

It isn‚Äôt okay that you‚Äôre giving OP a hard time for not taking action. She came to this forum for help with a real problem she has that could escalate to her being hurt in a very real way. She didn‚Äôt come here to be berated for not taking action in another situation where someone was getting hurt. If she could have intervened in that situation, she‚Äôd probably be more able to keep herself safe in her stalker situation.

askwomenadvice,fd6pk3e,t1_fd3vh5k,1578194162.0,"You should look into pelvic floor dysfunction- see if there‚Äôs any specialist relatively close to you or find some groups on Facebook for support and information. If they idea of sex gives you anxiety you might have chronic tension in your pelvic floor muscles, which could certainly contribute to pain and discomfort.

Also, cuddling is the best! I get super turned on from the intimacy of it- and it can be great foreplay for sex. Sex definitely feels wayyyyy better when you‚Äôre in the mood. If you get to the point where you think you‚Äôre comfortable enough to try having sex, make sure you *like* the guy as a human and that he‚Äôs good to you, and spend lots of time cuddling beforehand. Also- talk to him about what you‚Äôre experiencing. Communicate. He needs to be empathetic and sympathetic and happy to work with you, like no pressure to try to have sex. 

Also, lube, if for some reason you aren‚Äôt getting wet when you‚Äôre turned on. It happens sometimes and that‚Äôs okay! Every body is different. Has anyone gone down on you yet? Because I have found that if someone goes down on me eventually I get way more relaxed and things are easier, mentally and physically. Of course, not everyone enjoys getting oral and that‚Äôs also totally okay too! 

You are allowed to guide someone. Tell them directly what feels good and what you like. If something doesn‚Äôt feel good you can tell them to try something else, or to stop. That is totally okay! 

Sorry if this was all over the place and/or way too personal. I have had extreme sexual anxiety and panic in the past, and don‚Äôt wish it on anyone. 

All the best!"

insanepeoplefacebook,fcksiip,t1_fckrnt4,1577732240.0,"Well, the stats about trans women being murdered disproportionately are actually false, so we can get into that, or not- but I‚Äôve done my homework for good reason. I used to be more on the TRA spectrum, until I started seeing stories from other women being shut down and out from women‚Äôs spaces, events and language. It made me start to think differently, and I fell down the rabbit hole of information about the trans movement, and was shook by what I found. 

What‚Äôs funny about a lot of this is that by trying to deny gender realities it actually enforces negative gender stereotypes and cliches. Denying sex reality is also extremely problematic, and something that I‚Äôve seen over and over in any attempt at dialogue. 

I‚Äôm exhausted at this point, mentally from this diatribe, which so often happens with the trans issues. But I think it merits attempts at ending a conversation civilly. 

What I have seen since the trans movement made it to mainstream media is women pitted against one another, time and time again. I see division, and one of the most common fallback approaches I‚Äôve experienced from both trans people and libfems are resorting to physical violence as a threat. The number of times I have been threatened with assault, and seen others been told that they deserve to be raped and assaulted, is actually countless. When the movement of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù defaults to petty threats of physical violence against women I lose all respect for that movement. The TRA movement needs to check itself because the ones from the outside who do are beyond tired of being told we are ‚Äúscum‚Äù or ‚Äúworthless‚Äù or that we just need to take some girldick."

unpopularopinion,fckku4l,t1_fckfxui,1577727520.0,"I consider myself a RadFem, but I would not ever say men are trash. There are a lot of angry people out there though, so I guess it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me that some RadFem subscribe to the ‚Äúmen are trash‚Äù ideology. Generalizing and saying a whole group of people are trash is never okay, unless we‚Äôre talking about racists, xenophobes or sexists. There are lots of good men out there, who I have been fortunate to know personally. Unfortunately there are shitty people everywhere in the world, male and female, every race. I like to think there are more good than shitty though."
