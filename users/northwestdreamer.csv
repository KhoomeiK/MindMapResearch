LawSchool,ff25sg7,t1_fejnjmy,1579494602.0,"No that's the first year salary. Summer positions are a proportional fraction of that, so $35-38k a summer depending on how many weeks you work."

fasting,fe9svv6,t3_eo7i4y,1578941189.0,Starting while you're already on your period might be okay. All of my problems come from starting a fast right \*before\* my period is about to begin. Horrible horrible cramps whenever I do that. I also had terrible cramps while on the keto diet that ultimately made me switch to another way of eating.

unpopularopinion,fdtzy2q,t1_fdttmpq,1578725040.0,"As someone who was born into poverty I'm so sick of others trying to say that how someone was raised is the end all, be all of their life. I wanted a better life so I fought for it. It's not your fault if you were born in the gutter. It IS your fault if you die there. Especially in the US."

ChoosingBeggars,fdtwv75,t1_fdt73c7,1578723520.0,"Goodwill with passengers went out the window when the airlines stopped treating customers well, fleecing them for everything including ""extra"" seats that have what is normally the minimally acceptable amount of room for a person."

ChoosingBeggars,fdtvdy5,t1_fdt4npw,1578722817.0,I love how you assume he would've been thrown off the flight in that situation. Newsflash: you're the asshole.
ChoosingBeggars,fdtukp3,t1_fdtgndq,1578722445.0,"Congratulations, do you want a medal? Lots of people pay good money for their seats and are not in the wrong by refusing to move."
ChoosingBeggars,fdtu0tt,t1_fdt0ftd,1578722195.0,No need to blame the Americans here. Back when airlines didn't charge for seats there was no reason for your mom to forget to choose seats for you both together. No one else's problem but hers.
ChoosingBeggars,fdtrf1s,t1_fdt8884,1578721027.0,"I'm sad to say I agree with this. It's not right, but it's how it is."
ChoosingBeggars,fdtra81,t1_fdtebvv,1578720969.0,"Just curious, why didn't he check in online? I've always thought that checking in at the airport is more of an international flight thing. Was it a Horizon Air flight by any chance?"

It's not normal to completely avoid talking about your spouse to friends, even if they are a private person. Coworkers though I get that, unless you're also close."

newhampshire,fdkuko1,t3_elwz2w,1578511461.0,Henniker is 20 minutes outside of Concord and quiet. Lots of outdoorsy things to do but still close to the more urban areas. Very beautiful out there. Love driving out from Concord to hit up Pat's Peak and Henniker Brewing Co.

unpopularopinion,fdbkwak,t1_fdaypql,1578258354.0,They know - but at the end of the day they don't care because they're selfish. People know that their children are vulnerable beings yet choose to put them in even more vulnerable positions simply for attention. Absolutely baffles me and a warning sign of bad parenting.
unpopularopinion,fdbjphj,t1_fdbj443,1578258035.0,Okay Boomer.
unpopularopinion,fdbjbbg,t1_fdbi1i3,1578257887.0,"I have a better idea. Stop placing your children in the way of those who would sexualize them. Posting naked photos of your children is inviting people both good and bad into a part of their lives that should be private. It doesn't matter what you want. What matters is their privacy. Do your fucking job as a parent and protect them. There is literally no good reason to post these things online other than to elicit ""likes"" or other comments that are self-serving."
unpopularopinion,fdbi1k1,t1_fdbg8cu,1578257561.0,Okay Boomer.
unpopularopinion,fdbh8fr,t1_fdbgcrw,1578257385.0,"No, your argument is the one that is misplaced. So the reality of raising humanity includes making naked photos of your child's body available to the public? I think not. Your child has a right to privacy and your job as a parent is to shelter and protect them, regardless of your selfish desires. Stop posting naked photos of your children on facebook. It's wrong."
unpopularopinion,fdbfk4h,t1_fdauzda,1578256873.0,"Far too often the children are naked in these photos. There is absolutely something wrong with sharing these things when the child has no say over it. Their body belongs to them, not to their parents to share freely with the world."
German,fdb0y1v,t1_fdagtlt,1578252478.0,Sounds like a great way to cause a break up though. Communication is hard enough without removing one's fluent language from the equation while the other person is fluent in both..

barista,fcrlzaa,t1_fclvomd,1577903554.0,"Starbucks doesn't teach their baristas to stir the drinks either. You're not actually trained properly. I wouldn't generalize if this didn't happen at nearly every Starbucks I've visited.

Edit: Additionally, I said latte. A flat white is not the same as a latte. Thanks for proving my point that you're not trained properly."
barista,fclgvf3,t1_fcl25lo,1577747492.0,"As someone who worked as a barista for 11 years I really enjoy reading the experiences of others, especially involving customers (we all have our stories). Please go be unrelateable somewhere else."
barista,fclgk3v,t1_fcle6or,1577747282.0,God as a former barista I get so frustrated when I order a latte at Starbucks and they put a ton of foam on it instead of the small dollop. They're clueless as to the difference between a capp and a latte. Because I go there so infrequently I always forget to emphasize no foam.
EntitledBitch,fcletnw,t1_fcld03f,1577746148.0,Oh come on his comment was entertaining.

offmychest,fcka55p,t1_fbywfwq,1577720639.0,"Only an engineer would say that science and engineering are the same. There's a reason that the S and E are separately represented in the STEM acronym. You're very clearly ignorant, but I wouldn't expect anything less of someone whose reddit posts consist heavily of self-indulgent selfies. Very hard to take your opinion seriously. Word of advice, if you want to go to med school you should reconsider what you're putting out there on the internet. There are so many applicants that they're looking for reasons to reject applicants. You're very easily identifiable with photos of your face on reddit."

freefolk,fc6pred,t1_fc62xgd,1577486394.0,"Yeah but GoT came out years after LOTR ended, so there was more distance between the two. The Witcher came out the same year that GoT ended, so I can see why they were cautious. Plenty of excellent, non-famous actors to choose from."
Marriage,fc3vrl2,t1_fc3uwhk,1577399881.0,"Telling your parents about issues with your spouse will likely lead to resentment of the spouse down the line, by potentially painting a poor picture of your marriage in their eyes. This is a very, very bad idea."

offmychest,fbyqa07,t1_fbylv0h,1577223490.0,"No, engineering is applied physics, which is applied math.

Edit: Ah you're an engineering college student who wants to go to med school. You'd best figure out the difference between science and engineering before you go through the interview process. Best make sure you understand the differences too."
unpopularopinion,fbs3hq3,t1_fbrsixl,1577049749.0,Not necessarily. Most people don't qualify for high level private loans. Getting federal loans is much easier.
