Visible,fezuk56,t1_fezsepb,1579461842.0,"For me it was worth the $3 to get past Verizon’s limit on hotspots. To me, that’s the only benefit. Other than that, yes it took about a month for them to add my UDID to their repo, update for iOS 12, etc."

SATACTprep,feyel16,t1_fewosvm,1579444423.0,"It’s not suspicious it’s just sample bias. The survey was conducted on r/SAT at a point when UWorld was given out for free to all of the members. It doesn’t represent everyone who has ever studied for the SAT, just r/SAT during the period when UWorld was given to them for free. Of course they chose it as their #1. It’s a paid service given to them for free.

That being said, you can’t really call yourself unbiased when the icon for this sub is the logo for your tutoring service."
