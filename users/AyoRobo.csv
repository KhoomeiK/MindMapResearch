My campaign has two goolocks, one being my brother's firbolg and the other being a major antagonist. The former's patron is a forest guardian from an age long passed, his powers diminished by time and a lack of worshippers. He's a personal friend of his lock. The other is a devourer older than the world itself bent on eating every soul on the continent once more. His lock is a pawn to whom he has promised immortality (the tiefling lock incorrectly thought that his heritage garunteed him eternal suffering after death).

The only real concrete features of a great old one are that they are a: great, and b: old. Being super wierd is expected, but not required.

But linguistically, I can say that you have a lot of room to play with for naming your units of currency.

Politics are based on who's tired to who, so for example if the new king favors the aristocracy at the expense of the common folk, then we have two factions, one with the power of wealth and a sitting monarch, and the other with the power of popular support (and likely charisma, it does help).

Of course, who actually sticks their neck out for their preferred monarch is another story. And of course the revolutionary needs enough power to promise that people will believe in him."
