If you step on these hard enough to get splinters, then splinters are likely the least of your problems."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff7jwft,t1_ff7fzqw,1579651287.0,"Ah, the old ""yet here you are posting"" argument. Didn't the second paragraph in my statement show that I still hope that Pat changes his approach because of this (and similar incidents?), which is why I still want to be around?

And ""fact checking will ruin the podcast"" is an old statement by people who didn't realize that the ramifications of doing so is an increasingly annoyed audience because not knowing the facts about a situation yet ranting about it anyway week after week is, unsurprisingly, tiring. 

I started listening to the podcast because I believed, at the time, that they had a good and entertaining insight into the industry's workings or gaming in general, a belief that was generally true. This is now less and less the case. Wouldn't it be reasonable to ask for change, or at least point it out in this instance?"
mildlyinteresting,ff7hoed,t1_ff7gatq,1579649786.0,"They have that pretty satisfying Lego ""snap"" when you join them together. These ones were in a tub at a fairly busy shop, so I imagine they get some use but haven't seen any worn down ones or splinters."
todayilearned,ff7d9sj,t1_ff6hrxo,1579646882.0,"I've worked with lots of military memorabilia in my job and it's surprising how well they hold up even with minimal storage. The boots may be a bit different though, because they tend to get really stiff over time. Not sure they'd survive a tough shooting schedule though.

I wouldn't be surprised if the uniforms were also remade to better fit the actors. One thing people often tell me when they show me their grandparent's uniform is how small it was."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff76db4,t1_ff75k0x,1579642007.0,"I am, hence the whole ""I don't listen to them as often"" bit. In the beginning of last year, I would refresh a few times a day when I knew the podcast was coming. Now, I don't think I've listened to a full podcast since November. I had two 7 hour flights over Christmas and I *still* didn't bother listening to the backlog.

I honestly want Pat to listen and change because I don't think I'm alone, and that the only thing that's changing is that more and more people are realizing it. It's hard, for instance, to see this level of backlash two years ago. There's even a bunch of comments asking for a TLDR about the controversy, which may say something about people listening to the podcast, not the mention that a lot of the top voted comments on this thread about people getting tired of his shit.

Also, Pat saying he's not an expert on something and admitting he's wrong doesn't fit into the narrative where he also has half hour rants about these things. In my experience, saying you aren't an expert about something takes like three minutes tops."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff72mhd,t1_ff6z2di,1579639880.0,"Because laughing at someone who spends half an hour ranting on an argument that he has done no research about on a semi-regular basis isn't actually that fun? There are literally tens of thousands of podcasts and other audiobooks out there that I could be listening to, so why should I opt to listen to a podcast where bad arguments are the norm?"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff6v5gp,t1_ff6kgxc,1579635529.0,"Not for me. He may have hit worse topics before, but it's because he consistently does so and doesn't really change that cumulatively built up my annoyance with his shit. It's a pretty big reason why I don't listen to the podcast as often and I never watch his streams anymore."

AskReddit,fd366kz,t3_ejubhh,1578155120.0,"Grew up in Indonesia but we would often go to visit Singapore as a kid. I was always amazed by the cleanliness and modernity and wanted to move there. My parents ended up getting transferred so I spent all of high school and later moved back to work for 8 years.

It’s still clean and modern, but the charms feel more and more artificial and empty. It doesn’t help that the little areas of roughness that I enjoyed have slowly been smoothed over and replaced with glossy chain stores. I’ve also experienced Singaporean work culture first-hand and (now that I’m older) see what friends have to consider in their kid’s schooling, and it doesn’t sound fun. I’m now based in Melbourne, and the differences count not be more stark (The MRT wins out though). I can see myself moving back to Singapore to work temporarily (especially since my partner wants to teach overseas for a bit) but neither of us plan to live there long term."
