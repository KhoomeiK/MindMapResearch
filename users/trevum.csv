tumblr,fep621b,t1_fep1ogi,1579312937.0,"""A volcanic winter from an eruption in the late 17th century BCE has been claimed by some researchers to correlate with entries in later Chinese records documenting the collapse of the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in China. According to the Bamboo Annals, the collapse of the dynasty and the rise of the Shang dynasty, approximately dated to 1618 BCE, were accompanied by ""yellow fog, a dim sun, then three suns, frost in July, famine, and the withering of all five cereals"".[60]"" - Wikipedia

It seems insane, but when the top of a mountain blows up into the atmosphere it can travel pretty far before it eventually comes down. Go look at satalite images of the smoke from the Australian fires. It has spread very far, and the smoke is much lower than the contents of a volcano eruption."

I have a dog that is leash reactive and it happens far to often a dog will come up to us with no owner nearby and my dog starts getting worked up. When that happens my only choice to to let my dog off otherwise she'll probably bite the other dog(mine is gs/rottie), whereas off leash she is fine with other dogs. 
Fortunately I've put in the time and effort with her that she is behaved and actually listens to her commands and stays nearby unless I say otherwise.

FanTheories,fcp2q7r,t1_fcoss66,1577848662.0,"It's all about power. It wasnt necessarily about the master 'wanting' the apprentice to kill him, it was to ensure the sith constantly grew in power. One to hold to power, one to crave it. So the apprentice would learn all he could, then if he was powerful enough to kill his master, he was stronger and the title of dark lord is rightfully his. Darth Bane believed the true goal of the sith should be to destroy the jedi. But he knew it couldn't be done by force, it had to be subtle. So it was almost a form of self sacrifice. If the apprentice is strong enough, he will kill the master because he is stronger, and find an apprentice of his own, who will eventually become more powerful as well. And that's how you end up with someone as powerful as Palpatine, whether he is all the sith or just learned from his master."

My wife and I dated for 4 years before getting married and it took getting married for my mother in law to actually accept me as part of the family.
That being said, the first Christmas my wife and I were together I went to her parents for Christmas, and they got me about $80 worth of car stuff (booster cables, shammies, cleaning stuff ect) because I had just bought my first car a month before.
Even though she didn't like me, she still called my wife and asked her what I would like and got me a thoughtful, useful gift.
You put 0 effort into this gift, she has every right to be offended.
Also ""they've only been dating a year"" really?? Again, mother Inlaw didn't like me and likely didn't think we'd last, yet here we are almost 11 years later..."
