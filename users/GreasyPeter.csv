videos,ff7ri24,t1_ff5i6e0,1579656594.0,"The internet has created a class of person that barely existed when you were their age: The Internet Shut-in. People (mostly children) mostly between the ages of like 12 and 30 who get all their human interaction from the online world. Video games, chats, voice-chats. A lot of them have little to no real-world friends. This leads to depression usually, which makes the feeling of being alone worse, and in turn encourages them to keep getting social interaction the only way they know how: the internet. You don't really see them or speak to them in the real-world because they never come out into it unless they have to. I know all this because I became dangerously close to becoming one of them before I managed to escape somehow. I was somewhat when I was younger until I got out of my teenage years and slowly learned to integrate into society and speak to women as a normal human being. 

These guys/kids are super frustrated, usually depressed, unable to socialize (and find it hard to learn because when you're past a certain age and you're really socially inept, people will just ignore you or try and get away. Lacking social skills and a real ability to connect with a women in real life, they turn back to the internet and they discover streamer girls. They aren't like camgirls who sell sex, these are ""real women"" who talk and don't take their clothes off for strangers. Their like a girl you would see at the mall, or maybe you're neighbor's daughter. And because they seem real, they seem attainable. ""Maybe if I show this girl how nice I am, and interesting, and funny in the ONLY environment where I feel like I can be myself, maybe she'll like me back and we can eventually become something"". This sentence is essentially what drives most streamer girl's traffic. They don't care that there is 1000 other guys doing the same thing and they don't realize how much different it is out in the real world so they stick with it. If they don't escape they end up completely socially awkward forever and unable to attract a women unless she is somehow as awkward as they are (which is rare because this problem primarily affects boys/men.
