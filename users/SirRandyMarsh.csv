Here should be a good rule of thumb. With out the title it it a cool and interesting photo? No? Then don’t post it in R/pics where the whole point is the picture and not the title or situation. 

There are plenty of other subs to post Facebook stuff in. Stop highjacking this one as just some default sympathy sub."

They literally said people with  mental disorders are more a threat to them selfs, which directly implies depression and such. When there are tons where they aren’t a danger to them selfs at all and only a danger to others.

But because they don’t and can’t pay the $1000 for the dr visit they wait until it’s a bad situation and then we all pay 20x more for it. There is a reason all other western nations have better healthcare and pay less then half per capita then we do.. the average Americans cost per capita is $11,000 a year when the next closest is France and Canada at like 6k a year with way better healthcare.

I could literally go on for days with 100s of sources but it’s tiring when people like you refuse to face reality. Private healthcare makes it so there are a fuck ton of middle men who don’t do shit."
