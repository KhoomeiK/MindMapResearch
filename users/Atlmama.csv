JUSTNOMIL,ffaiinz,t3_esk99v,1579736547.0,"OMG. She’s an idiot. They can’t afford to live on their own, and now she is  bringing a baby into their lives just to compete with you guys??  *I can’t understand that lack of critical thinking!*

As for the rest of it, OP, I would suggest you ignore it. Don’t acknowledge this weird competition she wants to create. Look confused when people allude to any fertility issues. Just don’t give SIL any satisfaction by reacting in any way.  That’s what she is counting on.   

And I can get petty. You may not want to, because you sound like a nice person, but I’d be tempted to throw a line at her like “we might put off having a baby for awhile - maybe we aren’t ready yet...” just to annoy her. (Of course, don’t do it if you think she might go to the extreme of harming her baby!)"
AmateurRoomPorn,ffaf5h6,t3_erpmr8,1579734275.0,Really lovely choice of colors and textures!  Well done!

Please ask her if she actually been to Israel and seen a kibbutz because then she would not be so ignorant."

DuggarsSnark,ff7i5sf,t1_ff7h2mm,1579650109.0,"I saw it that way, too. I saw the video when a commenter posted it on a thread in this sub, and my heart hurt for her.  She was excited and earnest, and he stomped all over it."
JUSTNOMIL,ff7e2or,t1_ff56f5i,1579647414.0,"Yep. No more picking out thoughtful presents, planning trips or even reminding SO about birthdays, holidays, and Mother’s Day.  If nothing you do is good enough, then nothing she shall get."

DuggarsSnark,fep9oum,t1_fep5gq5,1579315277.0,That makes me so mad for you. I’m sorry some idiot told you that. I hope you watch all the videos and find your love of math again!
DuggarsSnark,fep99hk,t1_feo1a3v,1579315001.0,Whoa. I had to go back and look. That’s quite a difference.
JUSTNOMIL,fep8slo,t3_eqac8y,1579314697.0,"You made the right choice. She would never leave and clearly saw your baby as her do-over baby (she called him by *her son’s name* for goodness sake).  Moreover: 

she can’t convey an emergency in English if something were to happen;
isn’t trained in infant CPR like professionals are;
Won’t listen to your requests and instructions like professionals would; and 
Would not engage and encourage baby development like professionals are trained to do. 

Don’t second-guess yourself.  You made a reasoned and safe decision for your child."

DuggarsSnark,femq4l1,t1_fem77zl,1579266299.0,"Definitely not. I love looking nice and wearing appropriate accessories for an activity.   This just seems a step beyond to me.  The best way to describe it is the difference between starting to run every day and 1) wearing $60 running shoes with T-shirt and running pants, and 2) buying $250 running shoes and $300 running outfit endorsed by pros to wear on your first run.

JUSTNOMIL,fekx9g4,t3_epn1gd,1579209498.0,"It is absolutely acceptable that you and LOs keep NC even if DH decides to be in touch with her. That’s his decision, but it does not require that the rest of you participate.  As a mom, I would keep my children away as she’s shown no remorse or change over the years, even when your big-hearted DD gave her a chance.  

She’s ill, yes, but she hasn’t shown any signs that she’s a different person.  Keep protecting your kids."
JUSTNOMIL,fekwm4l,t1_fekvikv,1579209115.0,OMG. He played that song at a baby shower??  🤣.  It’s like the DJ wanting to play the Titanic song at our wedding. We cut that off before it even started.

JUSTNOMIL,feexk3k,t3_eoslhv,1579043397.0,I don’t see his issue.  No grandparents are going - she’s not being singled out. He can take DD to see her the next day.

Now, my for tough love advice:   Stop giving her so much information.!!  You are trying to convince her that the move is a good one, and you won’t convince her because she’s not approaching it rationally.  Please do yourself a favor and stop discussing it with her. 

Moreover, if she’s unpleasant and childish, then limit your interactions with her.  You don’t need the negative attitude around you, as you have enough on your hands with the move and new jobs. 

And, OP, I wouldn’t share the pregnancy news until after you move. If she’s a pain now, she will be exponentially worse after hearing that news."
