LifeProTips,ffaicx1,t3_esiw3v,1579736434.0,"This absolutely works.  My wife’s grandma always used to make me a full size banana cake that I was supposed to try to eat all on my own since my wife didn’t like it.  So, I took it in to work one time and ended up having way more conversation than I wanted or have the energy for.  I haven’t brought cake in since."
relationship_advice,ff9toza,t3_esg96s,1579721045.0,"I feel ya here.  My wife is not quite as cold, but some of the things she says when she has an audience definitely rubs me the wrong way and it takes every ounce of my patience not to make a situation awkward by confronting her about it.  

One example is asking me if I need help when I’m changing a diaper or preparing a bottle, which are things I do just as much as she does, maybe even more since I take care of those tasks every time whenever I’m not at work.  Her asking gives the illusion like I’m just another uninvolved husband/father who doesn’t do the dirty work that comes with babies.

I’m very straightforward about it once we’re alone.  I point out how much I help with the task in question and if she doesn’t want to shoulder more of the responsibility, she needs to be fair to me if the discussion of our respective workload comes up."

My wife had an ectopic and it was the worst day of our lives, but it completely changed our perspective on the responsibilities of taking care of the two kids we had afterwards.  The 3am feedings didn’t bother us a bit (both had to be bottle fed, so I fed while she pumped).  The massive diaper blowouts are minor inconveniences at worst.  Best of luck to you, the future joy will far outweigh the pain in the past."

gaming,fe5c5d3,t1_fe5a7x1,1578867572.0,I have good news.  You know who sleeps a lot after a baby is born?  The baby and mom.  I have a four month old and the day we came home with her was the day I started a new game of AC Odyssey.  I finished everything I wanted to do in it in about six weeks.  I’m now pretty far along in yet another Skyrim playthrough.  You’re entering a golden era of gaming.  Enjoy.
gaming,fe57s0p,t3_entbu7,1578866351.0,"It’s an amazing phenomenon.  Whenever my brother and his wife are visiting, it never fails that when we turn the console on to play hockey or whatever, our wives decide that they’re finally going to stop having their hours long conversation that didn’t involve us and insist that we do something else.  It’s to the point where my brother and I wager on how long it will take before one of them says something.  The correct answer is usually a few seconds."

From that moment on he doesn’t have the threat of future child support as a consequence of sleeping around, so that’s what he starts doing."

dataisbeautiful,fdn4g63,t1_fdn3lmd,1578576994.0,"That can’t be right.  If the OP data is correct, that means it has cost nearly $2,500 per golf trip just for the carts, which is impossible.  I also find it hard to believe Trump’s own golf course would charge him full price for any accommodation, if at all.
