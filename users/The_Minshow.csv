You want to get eyes early, if you spot 13 tanks in a lemming train your team(at least the good players) can adjust, then you want to roam around and take shots of opportunity so the reds always have you on the back off their mind, pushing view range as much as you can.

I recently tried playing with a group from a Free talk thread, but they only wanted to do the tourney rules, 1v1, no items, final destination, and it isn't my jam. I had loads of fun when i was deployed playing 8 person smash with everything. Yeah there was rng and team ups to try and take out the most dominant player(or i had someone who would fill Mr. G&W's bucket for me for the lols), but the better players still won more often than other people, and everyone got to have fun.

The genre draws in people who want to show pure skill, and who hate rng, which is fine. But not everyone has that mentality where they want to be perfect, and don't want to lose every time until they get better. In a MOBA you can play support and at the very least tank some damage for your team as they go ham, in shooters you can be a distraction, and a noob mentality can throw off people's game as they have to worry about the skilled strategies, and noob strategies. In fighting games noobs will usually lose until they git good.

Tldr Most people don't want to have to be perfect to win. The path to getting better can be fun, i enjoyed learning Smite and getting better back in the day, but in fighting games the person who executes better always wins."
