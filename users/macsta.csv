politics,ff8o4sa,t1_ff629p9,1579688396.0,"It's correct. The world's most successful countries are all socialist in policy if not in name. Conversely, right wing governments want to rule, not govern, and the results are clearly inferior. 

Socialist countries have better health, longer lives, less social inequality, more social mobility, lower crime, better rehabilitation for those who do commit crime. They have better education, better infrastructure, better support for the vulnerable, and of course, happier citizens.

The US, mired in nineteenth century right wing thinking, is tumbling down the ratings on all these measures. Despite all your money you have a wretched population, third world health, and crumbling infrastructure.

Because when so-called conservatives trick people into electing them over some stupid blind prejudice, they don't owe the people anything. 

The left goes to the people promising schools and hospitals and better government generally, and if elected they're expected to deliver, but the right doesn't need to make (or keep) such promises. Their appeal to the voters is merely to support their prejudices. 

The left aspires to govern, the right only wants to rule."

Secondly you will eventually recover but it sometimes takes a long time. You should consider going on medication, for many months if necessary. There are very effective medications and they make a big difference. It's difficult to make changes in your life when you're sitting at the bottom of a well. Medication restores some of your ability to think and act, it doesn't fix your life but it brings you to a place where you can fix your life.

No need to feel guilty, shit happens. Save your energy for building a determination to beat this. It's a long haul but complete recovery, joyful, constructive, life-restoring, love-restoring recovery can and does take place, even for women who've been buried under chronic depression for years.

Castro summoned an American journalist with personal connections to RFK, and told him to convey a personal message to RFK, if it happened again Castro would retaliate.

RFK sent another assassin. Around that time LHOswald had returned from training in the USSR and was keen for some action. He traveled to Cuba looking for a job and was told if he wanted to off POTUS, that would be fine. 

When JFK was killed during the LHO incident* , RFK knew immediately it was probably him who got his brother killed. RFK went into a very deep shock, followed by a long depression. His behaviour seems quite odd, unless you factor in huge guilt, then it makes perfect sense.

As soon as LBJ learned that the forensic leads on LHO led straight to Havana, he clamped down the Warren Commission to ensure they wouldn't follow up on it. And ""miraculously"" the ticking time bomb that was LHO was murdered by a passionate patriot with government connections, thereby ensuring the story wouldn't be told.

Democrats rightly feared that if Castro's part in JFK's assassination became generally known it would put the belligerent Republicans in the White House for twenty years.

*Learn another thing today: The bullet that killed JFK was 2mm smaller than the rounds from LHO's old gun. It entered the President's head at the midline at the back, and exited on the right in a cloud of pink mist, clearly visible on the Zapruder footage. The trajectory of this bullet was almost at right angles to the direction of Oswald's position.

LHO most certainly did not kill JFK, he was shot accidentally by George Hickey, a Secret Service carwash employee who'd been placed in the vehicle behind POTUS, and armed with an AR weapon he probably hadn't been trained to use.

Hickey stood up upon hearing LHO's shots and swung his Armalite Rifle to the right, to bring to bear on the Book Depository. As he did so the weapon discharged, killing the president.

To keep this short I'll end here. If you're interested, by all means ask intelligent questions and I'll explain further."
The_Mueller,few7krj,t3_eqrb4c,1579406474.0,"This career criminal, Donald Trump, has been using real estate deals to launder mob money for decades.

He is an international gangster, the sort of psychopath the RICO Act was designed to nail. Criminal enterprises concealed within apparently legitimate business, Trump's standard operating procedure, are the reason the RICO Act was created. 

All it needs is a nation prepared to enforce its own laws. Against white people. Against celebrity rich white people!

And at that point my argument falls to the ground. America idolises billionaires, even phony ones, so Trump's life of crime, his effective membership of the Russian Mafia, may well never be punished.

And that, the US's craven abandonment of the Rule of Law, is the dumb corrupt choice that has put the entire American enterprise at risk of complete collapse."
Fuckthealtright,few5crb,t3_eqrbem,1579405639.0,"Islam is rotten at its heart and cannot be reformed. It's long past time the West took a very close look at Islam, and faced the fact it's a ruthless system of mind control established by a psychopath for his own amusement. The central tenets of Islam are entirely incompatible with even the economy version of civilisation.

Freedom of thought and speech, freedom of association, education not indoctrination, separation of church and state, reverence for human life, even freedom of individual conscience itself, all are haram, despised, in Islam. 

Equality of the sexes, rule of law (real law not mumbo jumbo), respect for minorities, tolerance of difference, all will have no place when the Caliphate is established. 

It is time to stop pretending all religions are from some sort of cookie cutter in the sky, all of exactly equal merit. Islam is a clear and present danger to civilisation and it must be defeated, not by scorching the sands of the Middle-east, but by arguing the case in every public forum we can find. 

This is not a matter of culture, or simply seeing the world in a different way. Islam is the personal creation of one of the vilest, cruellest, most licentious and bloodthirsty monsters of history, the prophet Muhammad. People who want to live in the twenty-first century not the middle ages need to wake up to the danger Islam poses.

There is no moderate Islam. There are hundreds of millions of moderate Muslims and they live exemplary lives, but they are moderate in spite of Islam, not because of it. My point is that it's essential this argument must be about Islam, not Muslims. Muslims are the main victims here.

The West needs to explain to the Muslim world is that Islam is implacably opposed to what we all actually want, a world that gives every individual a fair chance to be their best self and contribute as much as they can for the betterment of the whole community.

Islam is an accident of history, a cluster of really bad ideas that has held together for fourteen hundred years, mostly because it's such an effective means of mind control. Every generation sees a new crop of parasite mullahs who use it to exercise brutal control over their victims.

There needs to be a knock-down-drag-out contest in the marketplace of ideas, about Islam. Is there a place in the civilised world for a religion that advocates killing those who leave the faith? That believes women are inherently inferior to men? That actually promotes the idea of middle aged men having sex with children? Clearly, inevitably, the outcome of such a conversation can only be one thing, banishment of Islam from civilised society.

Islam may be a successful cult but it's a cult. Islam, at its dark heart, wants only one thing - its own success as an organisation. Every part of Islam's sacred writings directs us constantly toward one thing, Muslims have a divine obligation to obey, promote and extend Islam and there is nothing in their lives that is more important than that all-consuming purpose. 

That's how you kickstart a cult to be still going 1400 years later. 

It's time to shine some daylight into the dark heart of Islam and get the world to agree it just has no place in any civilised community. Let's set these wretched people free from their cruel medieval superstition."

Build your independence. Have a place to go that's not being a homeless fugitive, maybe buy a cheap van and fit it out, or have a cheap motel or backpacker place on speed-dial.
