AmItheAsshole,ff8bqp2,t3_es01t3,1579672128.0,"ESH. 9 months is great, congrats! Unfortunately, alcoholism is a family disease that doesn’t magically go away for you OR your loved ones when you get sober (proven by your selfishness and short sightedness and your wife’s overreaction and need to control in this situation). 

 Keep working your program. I hope your wife can find her own recovery in Al Anon one day."

I miss someone who doesn’t exist, and doesn’t even really know me anymore (and i don’t know him either tbh). To get back together, we’d have to start over, which I don’t think he’d ever do, so no contact is really the only logical answer (besides being friends which I also don’t think he’d ever want to do). Just gotta keep it up one day at a time!"

askwomenadvice,fdetbeg,t3_ekru5p,1578346165.0,"I like babies, and sometimes get the “oh my gosh they’re soooo cute i could melt” feeling when I hold/interact with them, but it’s never triggered a “wow I want one of these for myself” feeling. I don’t want my own children, and don’t plan on having any, I think it’s perfectly normal to not have the “ovary explosion” women talk about (especially if you’re child free)."
