I’m not saying that any other politician, Republican or Democrat, is any better. Just pointing out an analysis from a service that tries its best not to be politically biased and focus on actual fact checking.

Edit: ok, trying to reason with either side in this debate is ridiculous. Downvoted because of an objective analysis? DMs accusing me of being both a Trump supporter and a libtard? What the actual fuck?"

A few pallets of stuff in a warehouse doesn’t prove any kind of conspiracy or wrongdoing by either side. This comment section is a train wreck.

Instead of arguing about “Trump bad, Bernie good” or “mainstream media bad, Trump good” or whatever, we should be 1) holding our federal government accountable for the suffering of Americans in a US territory that still desperately need our help, and 2) holding corrupt officials in PR criminally accountable for their actions."

AskReddit,fck8o36,t1_fck3vt9,1577719604.0,">	Apart from preventing unauthorized use, it is equally important to ensure that the weapons do not explode accidentally. For example, if it is accidentally dropped dur­ing transportation (such incidents have occurred), it should not explode. A nuclear weapon is one-point safe if, when the High Explosive inside the weapon is initiated and detonated at any single point, the probability of producing a nuclear yield exceeding 4 pounds TNT equivalent is less than 1 in one million.

They put a lot of engineering effort into this concept to prevent exactly what you’re asking about."
