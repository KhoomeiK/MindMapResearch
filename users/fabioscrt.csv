SuicideWatch,ff4eavb,t1_ff3ssi8,1579561566.0,What’s the show?
heartbreak,ff0mwv4,t3_er25zk,1579470378.0,"I’m so sorry you are going through this! I can’t seem to understand how people can just jump right to the next person after being with someone for so long, but that seems to be just too common! I’m really sorry! Stay strong!"
BreakUps,feyhk7z,t3_eqoiz3,1579445674.0,"Yes, I’m definitely like that! And it’s so exhausting to go through all those emotions everyday!"
BreakUps,feyfbnm,t1_fewo1lc,1579444747.0,I never get why people have the need to be so hurtful like that!
BreakUps,feyf7m0,t1_fevsxsj,1579444699.0,"Damn, that’s ridiculous! I hope you didn’t take him serious at the time!"
BreakUps,feyf1a2,t1_fevtqcu,1579444617.0,Really? Lol like wtf?!
BreakUps,feyewed,t1_fevx9m5,1579444555.0,"Damn, I’m sorry to hear that! I had a similar situation whit my ex, I found out he was interested in this other person and when I confronted him about him not telling me he replied “well, you never asked me about it!”"
BreakUps,feyendw,t1_few12ho,1579444449.0,"Damn, that’s harsh! I can’t even begin to process that way of thinking! Lol"
BreakUps,feyegu6,t1_fewbn1z,1579444378.0,I’m sorry you had to hear that! I guess they feel saying those kind of things makes it slightly easier somehow!
BreakUps,feye8no,t1_fewjywd,1579444282.0,"Wait, what? That doesn’t even make sense! If he’s too content why break up? Lol"
BreakUps,feydo3a,t1_fewk3ld,1579444197.0,"Oh my god, what a shitty thing to say!"
BreakUps,feydktv,t1_fewqhan,1579444166.0,"Wow, I don’t know why she would say something like that... Maybe she thought it would give you hope and she expected you to make a move but still... Stay strong, man! I wish you all the best!"
BreakUps,feyd5eg,t1_fexc9nx,1579443997.0,"Wow, that’s fucked up! I’m glad to hear you are happy now, and I hope everything turns out good for you!"
fasting,fevl7ze,t1_fevk7kp,1579398745.0,I see and that actually makes sense! I just never thought about it before!
fasting,fevgobo,t1_fevby5i,1579397174.0,"Really? That’s news to me too, I’ve never heard of that!"
BreakUps,fepe5x0,t3_eq90j4,1579318281.0,"Yes, it sounds absolutely like me right now!"
ExNoContact,feou884,t1_fem6bww,1579305601.0,Thank you! I find it incredibly hard to take this through but we just got to stay strong and think about ourselves and our well being first! I’m sending you strength! You can do this!
BreakUps,fejvev2,t1_fejsean,1579186746.0,You are welcome! Stay strong! I wish you all the best!
BreakUps,fejo8c3,t3_epfz4e,1579181428.0,"Yes, I feel we are left in this position where we are so vulnerable and sensitive that anything can be a trigger! I cried over so many stuff I never did before (porn too), to the point that I sometimes feel stupid! But hey, we are not emotionally stable, and that is a way to release emotion, so yeah, we just got to accept that!"
ProjectRunway,fe3bpm6,t3_enj0sy,1578847846.0,"I might be wrong, but I think they've done this before already! What I missed from having the whole team there was the judging was more focused on the individual designs and there was not much said about how the designs worked together, which I think it's important since it's supposed to be a collection."
BreakUps,fdly7sd,t3_em1f8u,1578535336.0,"Yes, feel free to send it to me!"
AskReddit,fdftlxx,t3_el2az5,1578369891.0,I just saw “The Witcher”! Never felt so lucky! Haha
ProjectRunway,fdfpb93,t1_fdfj938,1578366976.0,He said that but he’s actually been vocal before about getting his work copied... So him saying that actually confused me!
BreakUps,fdbrbf2,t1_fdbnhy6,1578260745.0,"Yes, exactly! You should be able to open up with your friends and feel like they understand you!  Instead, with the exception of one or two, all I feel is like they dismiss my feelings and make me doubt them and feel bad for feeling this way!"
BreakUps,fdbmgkp,t1_fdb9l1c,1578258777.0,"Yes, I agree with you! It’s really frightening once you realize how alone you are after a breakup! You might have friends and family to support but you still feel it! And you have to take the time to heal and to learn how to be alone again and how to be single... And actually take that time to reconnect with yourself and reflect on your whole experience from the relationship and the breakup to find out what might need work. I think this is extremely necessary before even considering seeing someone new! But I’m afraid the feeling of loneliness sometimes speaks louder!"
BreakUps,fdblkmo,t1_fdabqza,1578258526.0,"Yes, totally! I now it doesn’t come from a bad place and that they only mean well, but it’s not what I need to hear, for sure! It might work with other people, though, I don’t know, but sometimes, I just want to feel like they can understand me and don’t make me feel even worse for feeling this way!"
BreakUps,fdbkxto,t1_fda8j86,1578258372.0,"I know! My sister told me crying was only allowed in the first week, then I have to move on! .... Ok then!"
BreakUps,fdbko4z,t1_fda8qid,1578258266.0,"I completely understand what you mean and I relate basically to everything you wrote! Yes, sometimes it feels very overpowering and out of control! Like you, I have cried out of the blue every single day! Sometimes  multiple times a day, sometimes just a tear... But before this I rarely cried and it’s now been almost 2 months of crying everyday! It’s exhausting! But yeah, somedays it feels better, somedays back to zero again... It’s just part of the process, I guess, but the most important part of it all it’s the learning that we can take out of it, to understand ourselves better and try to work on what might need work! This, I think, it’s the only positive part of my breakup, because I feel it wouldn’t happen otherwise!"
BreakUps,fdbir8z,t1_fdatbsq,1578257791.0,"Yes, of course, I can relate to you since me and my ex are kind of in the same situation, wanting to remain in each other’s lives... It just hard not to mix and mistake things and keep everything and every intention clear at this moment! 

I can understand you wanting to leave the light on, as I do, just in case... We just need to make sure it doesn’t block us in any way and that we don’t end up limiting our lives because of that!"
BreakUps,fd9ylhx,t1_fd9xp7m,1578239662.0,"I know I eventually have to move one and that that time will come in the future... But right now that’s just not where I am at, and I don’t feel like I am able to be there yet, because I have so many feelings still!"
heartbreak,fczq23u,t3_ejob5h,1578106606.0,"Yes, I’m struggling with this right now!"
BreakUps,fcsxsw1,t1_fcswiie,1577927806.0,I guess so... It’s so strange nevertheless!
BreakUps,fcsxr8n,t1_fcsp5te,1577927774.0,"But I don’t necessarily think of him while I masturbate, it’s immediately after, like it strikes me out of nowhere!"
BreakUps,fcsoit7,t1_fcs42ot,1577921132.0,"I understand you do, but you’ll probably never get one, at least not one that answers all of your questions, because it will always seem like there’s more you need to know! So try to find closure on your own, or proceed to ask you boyfriend about it, knowing it can leave you in an even worse place! I did the later and even though I’m glad I did, I had to listen to some horrible and cruel things from him that to told me just like he was telling me how his day went, super casually!

But yeah, distance played a major part on my situation too, even though I still believe it isn’t defining... When there is love, strength, persistence and will to fight, you can conquer anything... Yeah, I’m far from perfect, and I probably had to change more than he did, but at least I didn’t give up and was willing to make things right! He just didn’t felt the same and as much as it hurts me, I have to accept it!"
BreakUps,fcrxpfq,t1_fcrv03w,1577908058.0,"I know, today marks 51 days since the breakup and I’ve cried everyday minus one day I managed not to! But it’s just out of my control, I can’t help it! 

I relate to what you say, my relationship wasn’t perfect either, it had its ups and downs and we would fight from time to time... There were even times I wondered if it was worth it and thought about breaking up... But I never gave up, and he ended up being the one who did! But I just love him so much that I can’t take him out of my mind now!"
BreakUps,fcrwuro,t1_fcrms42,1577907719.0,"I know! It’s so annoying, even before I open my eyes he’s already on my mind! Tonight I dreamt about him all night and I just hate when this happens! 
Bless you too, I’m sending my love!"
BreakUps,fcr5q28,t1_fcpkzrd,1577897167.0,I’m sorry to hear that! You’ll get trough this!
BreakUps,fcr5bsw,t1_fcr1vt1,1577896998.0,"Yes, this is very important!"
ExNoContact,fcr1sv9,t3_eiizz7,1577895527.0,"Thank you for putting the time and effort to write all of this! I think this will be helpful for a lot of people, who like me, are going through that dark period of hopelessness and despair! I will save your post and I’ll read it whenever I feel a little lost again! Thank you! All the best to you!"
rupaulsdragrace,fcqz58n,t1_fcqg2x0,1577894392.0,I was about to ask the same! Haha
Needafriend,fcqyvbu,t3_eie29u,1577894274.0,It never enough to be reminded of this! Thank you! You are too kind! All the best to you!
BreakUps,fcqwx9w,t1_fcqstg4,1577893462.0,"Yeah, I ended the year crying and started the new year crying again! It’s a process, and it takes time, who knows how much... Yes, we have to be patient and there’s no way we can rush this, but I just wish I could skip all this pain already!"
BreakUps,fcqwku5,t1_fcq5ir9,1577893314.0,You are welcome! I’m very sad too!
BreakUps,fcqwh8v,t1_fcpug0b,1577893264.0,"I know, I can relate, I went to bed it was past 7 because I couldn’t sleep, I dreamt with my ex all night and woke up feeling very bad!

No one deserves to feel like we are feeling, I don’t know what to say to you... Everyday I wake up and think I should quit too, that this all isn’t worth it, but we have to keep fighting, because things can get better! It happened in the past, so it can happen again! Just take it a day at a time! I’m sending you all my love!"
BreakUps,fcpgt9x,t1_fcpdp8w,1577863387.0,"This is very sad, but probably true! I think the same happened with my ex!"
BreakUps,fcpgr2q,t3_eifdkm,1577863309.0,"Yes, it’s normal you feel that way, if you still have feelings! For me, I think I’ll never be fully comfortable dating until I completely get over my ex, not because I think it might hurt him (I know he wouldn’t care) but because of me! I wanna be in the right mindset, feeling good about myself and feeling ready to invest the time and energy to even try to connect with someone else.

But don’t be too hard on yourself, healing it’s a process and it takes time, one month might not be enough still! Just try not to think so much about what he might be feeling and try to focus more on what YOU feel, because now you are the priority!"
BreakUps,fcpgad9,t3_eif14y,1577862692.0,"Yes, like the other person said, don’t think about it too much, because you’ll never know... He might have seen, he might have skipped it, but it really doesn’t matter because even if you knew if he has seen it or not, you wouldn’t know if he payed attention, if he saw it on purpose or by mistake, why did he decided to see it, what he really thought seeing it... It’s endless, so don’t waste your time thinking about this because it will drive you crazy!"
BreakUps,fcpf56w,t1_fcpemie,1577861280.0,"It’s normal, it bet it all feels very hopeless and dark! This sub and a few others helped me quite a lot with advices and just general support just from reading others situations but also posting about mine and my feelings! At least I keep myself distracted for some brief moments! I’m sure it can help you too!"
BreakUps,fcpekg4,t1_fcpdbxv,1577860604.0,"It’s nice that she tells you that, but don’t try to search for meaning beyond that, it probably means just that and nothing more!"
BreakUps,fcpcvds,t1_fcpbefr,1577858662.0,"Yes, we are!

I know, I wish the same, but in my case I know he doesn’t, he told me he got over it already and he was ready to be with somebody else!"
BreakUps,fcpbcjc,t1_fcpb20o,1577857034.0,"Same here! I dated him for 2.5 years, and it’s been 7 weeks since the breakup...

But I still think about him everyday, when I wake up until when I go to sleep, and I cry everyday thinking about him and our memories! Sometimes I’ll even dream of him!"
BreakUps,fcpai60,t1_fcpa0yj,1577856184.0,"Yes, it is! For how long did you date her and how long since the breakup? I’m fighting the same battle!It’s really hard, and everyday it’s a struggle, but we have to, do it, for the sake of our mental health! Take your time, it won’t happen from day to night, but eventually you’ll have to start letting her go and focusing on yourself and your well being!"
BreakUps,fcp9zhs,t1_fcp8rjk,1577855652.0,"I know, I know! But she might never doubt her decision, even for a second, and even if she does it might not be enough for her to want to get back together... That’s why it’s dangerous for you to be holding back to that feeling! It will only hurt you more in the long run!"
BreakUps,fcp8pl8,t1_fcp6nao,1577854246.0,"I know what you are going through, believe me! Everyday I ask myself that same question! But at some point we’ll just have to accept that this was their decision and there’s no going back! It’s dangerous for us to hold on to the feeling they might eventually want us back, because it stops us from moving on! So cry all you need, grieve, scream, break things if you feel like it, but just let go of the feeling, because it will drive you mad! I’m struggling to do the same here but I’m trying really hard! Stay strong man!"
BreakUps,fcp1xx7,t1_fcow3vh,1577847976.0,It’s such a small detail but it’s so painful still!
BreakUps,fcnsqhh,t1_fcnptlo,1577817701.0,"I’m sorry to hear that, and I can’t even imagine the pain of having to burry a loved one, let alone a son! But I can understand, of course, it’s even more hurtful and heartbreaking! 
I wish you all the best!"
BreakUps,fcn7mi1,t1_fcn6a3h,1577805372.0,Sorry to hear that! 😕
BreakUps,fcn66qi,t1_fcn5cw0,1577804318.0,"Yes, exactly! And even during the same day my head goes through so many different thoughts and feelings... It’s exhausting!"
BreakUps,fclizhh,t1_fcli3wg,1577748901.0,"No problem, it’s a normal assumption! 😉
Wow, I’m sorry to hear that! I can’t imagine the pain of breaking up after a 15 years relationship! That’s so much time, you build so much together... I’m really, really sorry for you! All the best to you!"
BreakUps,fclh36b,t1_fclgaz4,1577747637.0,"Thank you! Unfortunately I replied saying I’d like to keep a distance for now as we had discussed, and he just said he didn’t knew how his message could affect me so he decided to text me either way! He’s just so clueless of it all! 
(I’m a guy too, but I have trouble knowing how we think lol)"
ExNoContact,fcl3kco,t1_fcl22rm,1577739042.0,"Thank you, that was really helpful!"
ExNoContact,fcl2mnp,t1_fcl0vcz,1577738465.0,"Yeah, I know, and thank you for sharing your insight! It’s so hard to think straight when you are in the situation! I thinking I’m just starting to try and focus on myself first! Yeah, I’m wrecked but I have to move on for and by myself and stop acting around every sign of hope he shows me! After all this was his choice, and he said he was willing to deal with the consequences of it, so I have to make a choice of my own of moving on as he did! I’m not quite there yet, but I’ll be soon!

Sorry to hear you’re in a shitty situation too! Stay strong and I wish you all the best!"
ExNoContact,fcl0kl5,t1_fckzvpp,1577737195.0,"I see... Thank you! I don’t think he even considers getting back together but yeah, if he wants it he’s gonna have to show me because I’ve shown it on multiple occasions already!"
BreakUps,fcl00wa,t1_fckzs40,1577736857.0,"I see what you mean, and I think I agree! It’s just so hard to put the mind and the heart on the same page... But yeah, I think I’ll set my boundaries, that’s probably for the better!"
BreakUps,fckzv8q,t1_fckzlxe,1577736759.0,"We’ve dated for 2,5 years! 
I know he probably feels lonely, he even told me that, but he’s always been the lonely type and dealt good with that..."
BreakUps,fckziut,t1_fckyyqe,1577736547.0,"This is so freaking hard! And annoying! It really messes me up! My ex wasn’t selfish during the relationship, maybe a little bit during the breakup and I always tried my best to understand him and his reasoning but I just don’t know how to relate to him anymore because I don’t know his true feelings!"
ExNoContact,fckzaf8,t1_fckyuux,1577736403.0,"Yes, I want him back, more than anything! But I just don’t see a way that can happen in our circunstancies and after the things he told he felt!"
BreakUps,fckyi02,t1_fcky2f0,1577735917.0,"Sorry to hear that! Why do you think they do that? To alleviate their guilt? Or maybe they’re just concerned? Idk, I wish I could see things clearer!"
ExNoContact,fcky7nd,t1_fckx1qc,1577735742.0,"Yeah, I’ll think for a while still, but I guess if I answer him it will be something along the lines of what you wrote... Thank you!"
BreakUps,fcky1b7,t1_fckx4wm,1577735634.0,"Argh, I wish this wasn’t so hard! I know it means nothing, it probably doesn’t even mean he’s lonely, I think he’s just concerned about me..."
BreakUps,fckwzgk,t1_fckwe0o,1577734991.0,"I’d love for a reconciliation, but I don’t think that’s possible, considering the situation, the things he said to me, and the way how I know he is, or least thought I knew... So right now I just want to be well!"
BreakUps,fckws5w,t1_fckv0b2,1577734869.0,"I think he’s just concerned about me, and that’s why he texted!"
ExNoContact,fckwpvo,t1_fckv1o6,1577734831.0,"Yeah, I kind thought it was clear that we were going no contact, but apparently it wasn’t. I think I’ll just tell him that, I just have to figure out the right way to phrase it. Thank you!"
BreakUps,fckwldu,t1_fckvixs,1577734756.0,"Yeah, somehow I feel that is the right thing to do, I just have to figure out how to phrase it!
I know it’s just a text, I think he’s concerned about me, but nothing more than that! It’s dangerous to believe anything else!"
BreakUps,fcbzfmh,t1_fcbv4m7,1577592685.0,"Wow, yesterday, it’s still so fresh! I’m so sorry! I’m not gonna lie, this is gonna hurt like hell and it will be very painful! But you just have to go through this and the sooner you accept that, the better! Just don’t block your emotions, cry when you feel like crying, post here, speak with other people about your feelings and understand that you’ll have to find coping mechanisms to deal with this! I got dumped about 7 weeks ago and I’m still struggling really hard with all of this! It takes time, but not everyday will be the same... You got to take it a day at a time! I know it all seems hopeless but you have to understand there no way to escape all the pain you are feeling! Stay strong, and DM if you ever need someone to talk to! I wish you all the best!"

BreakUps,fcb15yp,t3_egx7hu,1577580669.0,"I know how you feel, believe me, I feel the same way and it hurts so bad! Hang in there! Better days will come for both of us!"
ExNoContact,fcalypz,t1_fcah39o,1577571873.0,"Wow, so sorry that you went through all of that! I think all things considered, and even though he hurt me a lot and told me some things that were really harsh, my breakup was pretty smooth comparing to some others I hear about!
The thing that annoys me is that I keep trying to understand him and his reasons, and that keeps me from being angry at him somehow! But yeah, he made this choice for the both of us, and chose that we didn’t stay together, so fuck him! That enough should be a reason for me not wanting to speak to him ever again! I just have to keep fighting and trying to look for more reasons! 
Thank you, I wish you all the best!"
ExNoContact,fcalgij,t1_fcaif4b,1577571572.0,"Yeah, and not knowing makes everything even more difficult, I think, because all possible scenarios, from the best to the worst cross my mind and it just drives me crazy! 
Yes, I can, and you can too, we just have to remind ourselves that we can! I just checked my ex social media a while ago too! Haha stay strong and all the best to you!"
ExNoContact,fcag9vp,t1_fcaewof,1577568711.0,"Thank you! I’ve read that before, but I guess when you’re fighting yourself so hard it’s never enough and you can’t be reminded enough times!
Unfortunately I don’t think he’ll miss me because he got over me already, and because we didn’t go NC right away but maintained some contact for a while... But it’s effective for all the other reasons!"
ExNoContact,fcadgql,t3_egv2gn,1577567340.0,"I know what you mean! I keep thinking the same, even though I know it’s not going to happen... Things I’ll say when we’re together again,  things we’ll do... It’s just inevitable, I think, but it’s so worthless..."
BreakUps,fc9zsfu,t3_egt9lr,1577560671.0,"Congrats, that is good news! 
I know how you feel, my breakup was almost 7 weeks ago and I’m struggling so much! I think about him every day, get sad with every thought, every dream and every memory! There was only a day I didn’t cry since and it felt great, it truly feels like a victory! There will be bad days in the future, and there will be some days like this again, I’m sure! Just be strong and take it a day at a time!"

Yes, I’m planing to discuss it on my next session! It just left me thinking about it! 
I will look into those resources, thanks!
Yeah, I know it’s just a name, it’s like naming a feeling, it’s just in the moment it felt very serious and took me by surprise!"

I have already accepted the relationship is over and that I have to deal and live with this choice which was not made by me but that determines my whole life.I know these things can’t be rushed, but it seems to be easy for some people to get over their exes that I just keep wondering if I’m doing anything wrong, or if there is something else I could be doing!
I have already started learning how to drive, because it was something I thought would keep my mind busy and it does, and right now it seems to be one of the moments when I can get distracted by myself...
You did help me. I know I’m not alone, but I can’t help to feel very lonely! Hopefully this will change soon!"
