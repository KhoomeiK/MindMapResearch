CasualConversation,ff3zg89,t1_ff3z8pv,1579552222.0,"Before going to China, I’ve heard of the Chinese cock being small and I’m sure everyone has at some point. I wasn’t really on the habits of sword fights, so I could care less if they had a small chapstick for a dick. But as soon as I got there, something I wasn’t ready for happened. Something that really blew my mind at first, got me curious and then finally started getting me angry.


Chinese were curious to want to see what a black cock looks like in real life. Gay and straight, male and female, old and young. Everyone literally wanted to have a peak at it. That curiosity had no boundaries, no shame and not even a peak to be honest. 

Some of the things that have happened to me in China, regarding my cock are just too fucking weird to even post here. I’m sure I’ll have to post this in multiple communities before it gets a pass for posting or else it will just be a hidden story from all. 

Anyways, starts in my first week in China. I’ve been to Beijing before but now I was there for an indefinite amount of time. I was staying with a friend but I’d have to find an apartment anytime soon. I’ve heard that it could be tough to get an apartment there(this is another post by itself btw). 

On this particular day, my friend takes me to this bar around an area called Santorum, which is a shopping area mostly. Beijing night life for me is a bit dull. And other cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou have a more appeasing night life than Beijing’s. 

For some reason, Chinese like to drink their beer warm. I hate that and it gets your belly bloated. Other alcohol, you have to drink at your own risk, as most liquor is fake(bootlegged). Unless you drink Chinese wine, that’s a bit disgusting. You know counterfeit is a big problem when you start smoking Marlboro’s coming from North Korea(not shitting you). 

Another thing I hate about warm beer is that it makes you want to pee(at least for me it dies that). So after the second beer, I went to go pee. The yolo okey was where they had like 4-5 stalls and I chose to take the middle one as all of them were empty. Thats when the weirdest shit happens. I don’t know where they came from but all of a sudden all the stalls were occupied. I said normal, and didn’t give it much thought continues doing my thing. But then I kind of sensed someone behind me and then I turned around, “There’s a fucking dude, trying to look at my penis from behind me. Then I also notice , all four of them were actually trying to see what my cock looked like. 

I was shocked and I said, “WTF ARE YOU DOING?” I was actually pretty mad but who wouldn’t be. You have 5 guys staring at your cock and talking loudly in Chinese by now. I repeated, wtf are you doing?

One of the guys poorly spoke English and he said, “we want to see, black penis hahaha” and he said it like it was a normal request. As if like I was gonna feel sorry for his curiousity and drop my pants to be examined by 5 Chinese guys in a toilet at some random bar.  

I just said you guys are stupid but I don’t think they understood me as they were caught up in their conversation, which I’m sure was stilll about my cock. I didn’t even finish pissing but i has to leave cuz that made me uncomfortable.


I told my friend, who was also black everything that happened and started cracking up. He was like, “I should’ve told you about that, it always happens”  And even told me that I’ll have to get used to it if I wanted to survive in China. I knew it was gonna be a problem but him associating it with survival sounded absurd. 


Case 2–


I’m in Shenzhen. Beautiful city, great night life and I wished I had lived there to be honest. Shenzhen is the electronic of China FYI. 

I went to Shenzen from Guangzhou with a group of friends for a weekend of partying. Sunday morning, I wake up early and everyone is sleeping. We had a pretty long night and every one didn’t look like they were gonna wake up anytime soon. 

So i decided to buy something from shenzen, electronic city and all. I googled where the nearest mall around me was and I grabbed a taxi and go there. I I reached the place and I’m walking in and from behind I could two older ladies talking loud(shouting actually). Then they started shouting “u, you” I turned around and they’re obviously calling me.

I stopped for them. They’re obviously in their 60s, short and very loud. Typical Chinese old woman as you’d expect. One of the older ladies holds my arms and without even acknowledging me, they’re still talking. I’m still trying to be nice,, 60 year olds. 

Then one of them takes out 200yuan and starts talking in chinese and I said NO CHINESE. Then she started pointing at my penis area and making a binocular sign. 

WTF! WTF!

Did I just get offered 200yuan to show my penis. I said what?? Now both are doing it, pointing towards my dick and binoculars. When they hailed at me, I expected rude, but not this. Not this at all. 


I couldn’t help but laugh. But I said sorry, sorry and I left the two old women who were trying to lay me for a peak. WEIRD OLD BITCHES.



Case3– I rented an apartment and there was a shop underneath and one time I got condoms from there and surprise, surprise. They didn’t fit. Chinese condoms are small. Very small. You’d have a bloated dick after all the action. Sorry for the graphics but that shit is true. I told the shop owner  about this using my translator app and he laughed so hard that he made a phone all hole I was shopping there and he started laughing loudly on the phone. I had a feeling the conversation was about me. 

So the next time I go to the shop. The guy and his friends were there and they started laughing at me. Not in bullying way but it just made me uncomfortable as hell. So then dude takes out a package and says YOU, YOU. And he gives me DUREX XXL condoms. Idk where the hell he found XXL comdoms in China but I was really surprised. But as much as I’d like to write saying I used them all in a day, , XXL can fit my elbows, let alone my dick. I told him too big, then like he was saying really and starts trying to grab and feel my cock and laughing out loud with his friends backing him up.. I just left the shop pissed. 


Case 4- I am trying to hook up with a chinese girl. Girl started liking me but there’s something holding her back. I knew what it was, but I will say there was something holding her back. Then after a night out, she says “Promise me, that If we have sex, I’ll not go to hospital” She said I know about black penis and I’m chinese, I could die. 

I’ve never seen it as a cock of destruction but I promised her, nothing of that sort will happen. Not going to write the sex stuff but the aftermath,,sorry🙄


We started sort of like being serious and then I started noticing a trend with her. She’s love to come to the house, she’s love to go a bar that is dark but she wouldn’t want to be seen with me at day time. At first, it didn’t bother me but it gets to you. Like what the fuck. I didn’t do shit. 

So I asked and she said it was coincidence and nothing if that sort happened. Then she eventually started going out with me at daytime but I also started noticing people on the streets would point at us shamelessly and start talking in Chinese. I asked her and she said it’s not about us and that they’re talking about random things.


Whatever language it is,, you will know when somebody talks about you and I insisted for so many says that she tell me . It happened everytime so it was getting annoying too.

Then she tells me,, almost crying “ the reason I don’t like to be seen with you is because of people say about you and me,, she said that black guy has destroyed her pussy now, there’s no way she can be satisfied with a chinese penis now...her oust must be so wide, probably inserts a chinese mans head,, his dick probably reaches his knees.. blah blah,,I was like wtf,,my knees🙄🤷🏽‍♂️🙄"

But I only hate HK of what happened to me in HK and there is nothing more to it and also nothing sinister as well."
