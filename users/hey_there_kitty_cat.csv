Maybe it was just timing, but (of course) it was Sixth Sense and there was this surge of like ""OH SHIT IT'S <X> BY HIM!"".  I'll be honest I didn't care for Signs or The Village, but they aren't bad.  But then he just like took a nosedive, it's like a jump scare /plot twist was something never done before the 2000s and people got super hyped up, then collectively realized wow this guy kinda sucks, one good twist is not enough to make me watch 2 hours of shitty directing.  He should definitely be on his knees any time he sees Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis these days, they are definitely the reasons for his fame."

Like obviously fantasy points don't show the whole picture, but when it's Gronk, Kittle, Kelce, and then like everyone else doing almost nothing, something is up.  The only thing I can think is it's just a weird position, you need to be big, but also need to be pretty nimble and/or fast.  I guess I can see why teams have trouble finding a playmaker that fits that position, those are all but mutually exclusive besides some serious standouts with genetics and football knowledge being able to basically play any position on the field where you're needed.  Heath and Jesse and Vance have all been awesome, but not the level of just blowing a game apart like Gronk or Kittle or Kelce."

I see people on the road every day doing worse things, I shouldn't have been driving, but I even knew that and was staring at the road.

But an agent is there to help you negotiate the deals, get you meetings, not be your best friend and his one and only love.
