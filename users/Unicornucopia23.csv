Since a scientific discussion is based on logic and not personal bias, I’d say it’s actually the exact opposite of a God worshipped in blind faith. 

True philosophy and science have no place for “interesting but completely unprovable”"
AskReddit,fex4rgx,t1_fewzmyy,1579424338.0,"I don’t know about you, or anyone else, but I didn’t “leap” to that conclusion. It’s a recurring and uncanny feeling that should not be ignored, just because we can’t prove it. 

I don’t understand how you jumped straight from this sensation to an adrenaline rush. I think we know the difference.... perhaps it is worth considering that you just haven’t experienced it yet. 

At some point, as a speculative mind, you just have to accept that it’s possible that some things are very real even though we can’t prove. Perhaps, even things that we’ll ever be able to prove. But that doesn’t make it any less real. It’s important to be this open minded because that’s how new discoveries are made in the first place"

That’s what you said. It’s called blaming the victim, and it’s a real dick move. That’s not gonna fuckin fly anymore.

I have been in your situation. You have two choices: Get the hell out, or accept that the rest of your life will be a waste of time, and total bullshit. 

And I don’t mean to sound insensitive - the hardest part of breaking up with my ex was saying goodbye to his son. Even though I was always CF, that kid loved me, and I loved him. I had to accept that it wasn’t my responsibility to wreck my own life in a desperate attempt to make his son’s life a little better.

This was in 2013, and I’m pretty sure I’d be dead, or wishing I was, if I was still with him. Please hear my words and consider the value of your own life.

What both sides truly want, is to not be judged by their government. Almost everyone is just trying to let the other side know that NONE OF US WANT THIS! There have been many discussions today. We don’t understand why the fuck it’s happening, and we all hate it. 

I think it’s important to remember that historically, the “powers that be” always profit and gain control when the masses are divided.... because we are strong together.... but only if we wake the hell up and do something about it. Otherwise it’s all too easy to divide, and conquer.

We’re all just people. Except for Trump supporters.
