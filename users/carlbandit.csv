I'm not saying smoking/drugs are healthy for you, everyone knows they are bad for your body, much like many of the other things listed above, but if I tried to avoid all of them, I'd probably hate my life. 

Imagine going on holiday and never sunbathing because the sun can give you cancer, or never having a greasy meal as a treat because it's high in fat. Never having a drink to celebrate your birthday or good news. Never going into higher education as you'd also have to work a job and that could lead to stress.

Any one of us could die, right this second. We could be feeling fine and have a major underlying health condition, we could be sat peacefully at home relaxing and a gas pipe could blow causing our house to explode. From a quick google, around 1.25 million people die per year while driving, that's an average of 3287 people, who woke up that morning expecting a normal day and had it end suddenly behind the wheel.

tifu,fdr5qmn,t1_fdr28cn,1578679808.0,"You do you, I’d never force anyone to take something they didn’t want. But don’t go claiming all drugs are bad because you where told so.

I never took drugs when I was younger as I listened to the lies about how it will ruin your life after 1 smoke and all that shit. I decided to give it a go after seeing how it affected my friends and seeing them continue normal lives.

Drugs like most things in life are all about moderation, there are plenty of 100% legal and socially acceptable things out there that are much worse for you. The most obvious being alcohol and cigarettes, I’ve seen no end of trouble with people drinking too much on nights out, not knowing where they are, passing out, throwing up, etc... I’ve also seen the health of loved ones deteriorate from smoking after doctors have advised them to stop.

I’ll usually smoke a joint 2-3 times per week, sure there are some weeks I’ll smoke a lot more, but there are also times when I’ll go weeks without smoking, I don’t miss it when I don’t smoke and I could smoke in them times if I wish (it’s not down to finance or availability), it just doesn’t cross my mind. I smoke because it’s a nice feeling, even though I’m not usually stressed, you still feel more relaxed and even though I’m usually always happy, it makes me feel happier.

Other drugs I’ve tried are-
 LSD (acid) - makes me extremely happy, music sounds x10 better, food (especially sweet stuff) takes amazing
MDMA/ecstasy - your more open and friendly towards others, music again sounds x10 better and you often want to dance 
Cocaine - not a big fan personally and have done it very few times in small quantities, just makes you feel awake and almost more alive I’m a sense

I draw the line with drugs known to be addictive and ruin lives, stuff like meth and heroin are big no no’s with me and everyone I know who’s done drugs. If I ever found out someone I knew was touching them, I’d do everything i could to help them get off it, but I’d also make it clear if they continued to do them, I’d no longer be a part of their life

Think about what it is your going to say beforehand, you need to make it clear to your child and the school that you accept his actions where wrong. Be careful not to go in defending him, violence is never the right course of action unless it’s to defend yourself from violence.

As for the hallucinations and blacking out, drugs react differently to different people. I’ve known people who rarely smoke claim to have mild hallucinations after smoking a joint and I’ve personally passed out for half a second in the past after smoking and taking a really big hit, when I’ve not eaten for like 20hr (stupid but a learning experience).

I’ve never smoked a cart, but I believe many of them are strong, others could probably go into details better and it will depend on the cart, but OP could probably have had equivalent to a full joint or 2 in them 8 inhales, if your not used to smoking and suddenly do 8 proper inhales of concentrated THC, it’s going to hit you"
