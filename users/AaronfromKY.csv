jobs,ff8axjr,t1_ff877bj,1579671331.0,"I’m just not sure what exactly my skill set is. Basically I just work hard, follow diagrams, and that’s about it. I lack control over how much product I get from the warehouse. And as far as learning, when I leave work in the morning I usually just want to Reddit, play Diablo, and watch anime. I keep up on politics and get very disheartened. I tried taking programming courses in college, I passed C, but most of the time was very lost, especially overhearing the more mathematically inclined students talk about prime numbers and things. I’ve always liked technology, but I haven’t been around enough of it. A lot of people in my life have said they hate PCs at one point or another 😅"

You'd need to run premium gas for best benefit, but the higher compression and higher lift cams would add some decent snap. Could always do some port work to the head and run a Racing Beat header and aftermarket exhaust for a little extra, but probably be hard pressed to get over 130-145whp NA."
jobs,ff0yhaz,t1_ff0m2ep,1579473507.0,"How did you manage to keep finding jobs worth applying for? I’ve been looking for at least a year while I’m working at a job I’ve been at since I was 15(35 now). I literally don’t know what else I’m good at, but I have a mortgage, student loans, and car payment, so taking a huge pay cut sounds awful(I’m making 19.65+$2 shift differential working nights as a department head in a grocery store). I have a degree, but it’s one of the ones most would call useless (anthropology). Any ideas?"

jobs,fexps5i,t3_eqq9er,1579434557.0,"Yep, interviewed for a customer service role within the company I currently work for. Interview went really well, had really good chemistry with the interviewers, one of whom would’ve been my new supervisor. About a week and a half later, near the end of a 12hr day (I work 3rd shift so around 10am) I got a call back from the supervisor. They said I was a really good candidate for the position, but they didn’t get the headcount increase approved so no one got the job. My company is actually inept enough that they wasted time interviewing people for a role that wouldn’t exist. I’ve been trying to get out of the company since, for almost 1.5 years now and it hurts having to go to work there everyday and especially since they rebranded and have pushed being uplifting everyday."

I think that what society is experiencing is a result of the stagnation of wages, the gross inequality that we see daily, the unchecked public corruption, the FOMO culture, the Facebook effect of comparing your private life to what people share publicly and being found wanting. Were there depressed people in the past? Of course, but to say that there were just as many, is to ignore the past 50 years of global economics as well as the specific influence of reality TV, social media, and vanished opportunities for freedom and social mobility."

careerguidance,fdrr23h,t1_fdrq027,1578688364.0,"Let them judge you. Who are they? Do they live your life? Carry your burdens? For myself I do mostly what I want to, take criticism and change if I feel it’s warranted and if not just ignore it. I do some comparison at times, but mostly I try to be happy. My job is probably my least favorite part of my life right now, and that gives me perspective. I am blessed, and should focus on the things that are good, rather than worry about things that might be. Could I get stuck at my job? Possibly, although I like to think about quitting often. I’ve told. My girlfriend, and it’s true, I’d rather lose my job than lose her. I can always get another job, but our relationship is what matters."

Had a hard time getting through college and even though I graduated in 2001 from high school, didn’t get my bachelor’s degree until 2012. I think the thing that I try to do, is I run my own race. It’s my life and while I wish sometimes that things could be different, the fact is as long as I’m alive and have a job and shelter, I’m doing ok. I’m working for the same company I have since I was 15, and I probably could have gotten somewhere different if I was inclined to. I’m looking for a new job currently and I’m definitely worried about falling down salary wise, since my current retail department head job is basically a glorified stocker position, very little office software usage, and even customer service is a smaller part since I work night shift. But I still am hopeful to pull off a career change and start to build a life together with my beautiful girlfriend. Stay positive and realize comparison and FOMO are thieves of joy."
gaming,fdqz1h4,t1_fdqv9vj,1578677116.0,"Some key points of difference between switch and the other consoles include that it can be a portable device, whereas others need a TV, it comes with 2 controllers (other consoles only include 1), and while the graphics aren’t super detailed and FHD, what is there usually looks cartoony and good. I understand the hate, but it is the same as it was with Wii: make fun games that anyone can pick up and play, and appeal to parents and kids. They’re not targeting “hardcore “ gamers for the most part, but a casual player who might get a few games and work on them, rather than buying a bunch."

AskReddit,fdp4jxk,t1_fdoyqnf,1578619834.0,"I’m in a red state, and surrounded by those who are Republican and constantly was bombarded with “evil liberals” and “corrupt Democrats” rhetoric growing up. I voted for Obama in ‘08, then Republican in 2012, supported Bernie in 2016, but voted Trump because I couldn’t stand Clinton. I have realized the error of my ways however. I think part of it is just growing up and actually seeing how each time we elect a Republican things get worse, as well as following a lot more leftist subreddits. I’m all in on Bernie now, and realize I have to back the Democratic candidate no matter who if he doesn’t win(although Biden would be depressing), simply because 4 more years of Trump and we may not even have a country, let alone a functioning government. I deeply regret my vote for Trump in 2016."

I too have been very despondent at times, due to the workload(heavy), my coworkers(some of the slowest I’ve ever worked with, like takes 30-40mins to break down a skid, and 20 cases per hour on a target of 60), and trying to stay social. Thankfully I have an understanding Girlfriend. But if you’re truly only getting 45mins-2hrs of sleep per day, see a doctor. I have hung up blankets over my windows and only recently have needed sleep aids due to being keyed up from my job. I have experienced emotional outbursts too(randomly cried in the shower thinking about a song, think nightly about quitting putting in my 2 weeks). You may need to see a doctor even after quitting to get your head right. Good luck!"
memes,fcgp4sb,t3_eh541v,1577642559.0,"A few simple tricks for coping with anxiety and intrusive thoughts:

Write down the things you are stressed out about. Writing them down helps objectify and quantify what is stressing you out. It gives you perspective, and tossing the notes afterwards can be releasing.

Stop and breathe. As thoughts come into your mind, step back and analyze each one. Are they true? Are they realistic? Do your feelings reflect the actual gravity of them, or are you perceiving things through a negative lens? Let the thoughts go, especially those that aren’t reflecting objective reality.

Give yourself distance from things that stress you. Leave work at work, leave hurtful things at the door when you come home. Let go as much as you can."
