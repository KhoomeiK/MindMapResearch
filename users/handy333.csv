1. My mom and dad’s answer to everything was yelling and whippings. Plus constantly hearing shut up and I hate you from them a lot.



2. Growing up poor and not having (or caring for) nice things and clothes among other things opened me up for bullying. Even today at work.



3. On a funny note. I had to rap in front of class. Something about estuaries or something.



4. Skateboarding and falling where I lived was a nightmare.
