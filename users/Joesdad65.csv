He worked his ass off, and he smelled. I silently judged him for the smell part, but I kept it too myself. Then I got to know him, and he's a great kid. I say kid because he's in the age range of my two sons. I found out that when he started at my gym, he had already lost 100 pounds, from 400 down to 300. He is now down to 240, and looking good. He's still got a ways to go for his goals, but he has my total respect. We are both lifters, so we're in the same area of the gym."
