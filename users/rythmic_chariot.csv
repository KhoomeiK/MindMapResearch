And about the argument that he's not personally responsible for the role and should be absolved of the failures is not right at all in his case. He was given complete  freedom, more than required as a matter of fact. [He gifted the cast dead pigs, didn't talk to the cast members, locked himself in, visited psychiatric wards and other gnarly shit ](https://screenrant.com/wtf-ways-joker-prepared-for-jared-leto/). Asked for the tattoos and stuff, meddled with the script and wanted his own take on joker.

And what did we get? A super edgy K-pop looking joker, who did no justice to the character. It's time we hold some accountability against these overpaid 'artists'. Jared leto has been a let down other than (I admit) Dallas buyers club and needs to give a few good performances to redeem himslef"
