Therefore, since ABC is an isosceles triangle, line AP must coincide with either line AB or line BC or point P must be outside segment BC.

But this is absurd, for by construction, point P was made between B and C.

Therefore, point P is less than lines AB and AC."

Life,ff91jjx,t3_es9uom,1579702525.0,"That is called ennui. It is also translatable into boredom or misery. Since education provides constant stimuli and diversion it usually isn’t noticed until that phase of life is finished. Diverting oneself away from it temporarily helps but it always returns. Accept that it is part of the human condition.

Also, ennui is very broad; and hence it is distinguishable from laziness, fear, and apathy, which are the feelings you have toward developing your writing career. Though it is reasonable that you would think them the same, you can overcome the latter but not the former. In fact, overcoming your apprehensions about writing is integral to diverting yourself from ennui and having at least some happiness. Ennui will never truly disappear because it is part of the human condition but at least you can be hard working and do something you are passionate about.

Personally, I found that religion is the best answer, because it offers the promise of an eternal afterlife in which mortal imperfections such as ennui don’t exist. It gives me something to look forward to after this life."
education,ff607cg,t3_eruxwy,1579615737.0,"I think personalized learning is at its best when self-guided. As always; a good instructor should be skilled in assessing the student, and guide them in developing organizational skills, orderly modes of thinking, study habits, and the appetite to learn independently. And they should do this by example. Moreover, a teacher should be generally knowledgable enough to address any subject matter found in a set of personalized curricula.

If a teacher lacks the aforesaid qualities, then I do not think they should be a teacher, because they will not be able to lead by example. Thus, to answer you question, I think the mediation of instruction should be directed at those things. I think the education of teachers *a priori* would have to change in order for education itself to change effectively. Like today, they would have to be participants in a model that they are accustomed to."
Life,fezi4c1,t3_eqv2r6,1579457612.0,"I’m not married but I had a discussion with a friend about marriage yesterday and it is still fresh in my mind. He told me he met a guy who had been married for seventy years, and when his wife died, he felt like he lost half of himself.

That made me think about what it means to be married, how two people become one. The thing is, we have control over our own thoughts, feelings, and actions as individuals; but that control does not extend into others. Therefore a married couple is like a single person but with no unified sovereignty. Its one half cannot control its other half, and that is very different from the individual experience.

I’ve dated before and have experienced this to a lesser degree, but I can only imagine what it would be like to be married for seventy years. Or have children. Do people just become more and more alike over time?"
TrueChristian,feyxz2p,t1_fevth7o,1579451822.0,"While I grant that questions are, in a certain sense, necessary for faith, they must be the right questions. For some questions do not apply to religious theology. Non-applicable questions tend to be complex, they focus on ambiguities and logical contradictions. They also tend to presuppose that there is an answer where there might not be. Those questions are philosophical, and they can lead someone astray from religion, which is simple.

Religion only has doctrine, which has authority, and someone either obeys the doctrine or they do not. But philosophical questions do not need to be asked in religion. Rather, scriptural or factual questions must be asked. The scripture can satisfy and calm the soul’s desire for philosophy by filling it with divine wisdom.

For instance, your question “what does good mean?” is a very famous and ancient question without a definite philosophical answer. Men have troubled over morality since their beginning.  But good in the scripture invokes a higher form of contemplation.

In Genesis, where the term good is first used in the scripture; we learn that God’s creation is good, and it is a wonderful experience to contemplate this. But also evil exists, and that is frightening, especially since our immortal fate can be overcome by it if we stray from God. Therefore it stands to reason that loving God is good and will save our souls, and that was his basic message through Christ. There are other uses of good in the scripture as well, but contemplating their meaning is not philosophical."

philosophy,felgsl3,t1_fej92mc,1579221819.0,"Some people think that philosophy and religion can be believed simultaneously, whereas others believe that philosophy and religion are mutually exclusive. It all depends on how they are defined, and some very strange implications can come from these definitions. For instance, if religion can gain someone access to heaven, but philosophy cannot, then what is the point of doing philosophy if it won't secure eternal happiness? Below are some thinkers who had different approaches to defining them.

Pascal is someone who thought there was a contradiction between religion and philosophy. For Pascal, religion or theology was an historical study that depended on the authority of men who existed during religious eras. The aim of religion is simply to know what these men knew, and arrive at faith and salvation, according to how it is in the scriptures.

Philosophy, on the other hand, is secular, and it employs reason to arrive at its conclusions about the nature of existence and morality. Thus, unlike religion, philosophy does not necessarily depend on the support of scripture and authority for its conclusions.

Other people, such as Spinoza, thought that religion and philosophy were compatible. All of religion can be reduced to the golden rule; and people should be free to follow whatever religion they want. However, the choice to be religious must be protected by the state, and the state must be guided by philosophy. Therefore, one can be religious but only in a philosophical context.

Another way to ask you question might be something like this: just how universal \*is\* philosophy? Is philosophy something we can apply to our approach to religion like Spinoza said, or is religion a sort of barrier that blocks philosophy from entering like Pascal said?"

AskPhysics,fehexat,t3_ep5at0,1579115134.0,"The velocity determines the radius of the orbit, but at a certain point, if an object is moving too quickly, it can achieve a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory and leave the gravity well. When an object is in a perfectly circular orbit, we say that it has an eccentricity of zero.

Wikipedia on eccentricity: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital\_eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity)

Perfectly circular orbits are incredibly rare because there are so many different forces in space. The Earth, for instance has a nearly circular orbit, but it's not perfectly circular because the other planets slightly change its motion. Its motion is elliptical, meaning that it is closer to the sun sometimes, and farther at other times. Because of this, according to Kepler's Laws, the velocity of the Earth changes as it goes around its orbit. It accelerates when it is closer to the sun, and decelerates when farther, but its period is always the same.

Wikipedia on Kepler's laws: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s\_laws\_of\_planetary\_motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion)

That said, the centripetal force of the sun remains proportionate at any distance because its mass remains constant, only the distance between bodies changes. Gravity is proportionate to mass (of two bodies) and distance (either radius or semi-major axis of orbit), but not necessarily equal to something's velocity.

Wikipedia on sphere of influence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere\_of\_influence\_(astrodynamics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics))

Circular orbits can also have different velocities around the same body. This can be demonstrated by something called a Hohmann transfer. Again, the velocity only determines the radius of the orbit, so I don't think it needs to equal the centripetal force of the sun per se.

Christianity,fedwvea,t1_fecmztf,1579021592.0,"How should we distinguish culture from law, and how do they relate?

Idk if my question makes sense but it seems like culture and law are the same to me."
education,fedr812,t3_eojq0w,1579018153.0,"The curriculum would have to be very general and intensive for it to work in one month, and for this to be most effective, we would have to know what we are allowed to assume about the student’s current level of education. For instance, if the student had an education from that time, say like Ben Franklin, then he would be pretty well versed in his current state of philosophy, math and science, literature, and of course the classics. In a certain sense, if it is someone like that, then they would already be better educated than most in today’s world. Since Liberal Arts educations in the colonial era were very general and historical, it lays a solid foundation for its natural progression. To use an Hegelian term, it is an historical dialectic; hence the basic idea of getting someone up to speed assumes that the modern world is a consequence its past necessarily.

In this view, many of the same foundational questions and problems exist today that have existed since the beginning of society. All the student would need is a general overview, like a liberal arts education, that covers the most important developments over the last 250 years. Kant changed metaphysics with his rigorous approach to philosophy, but he was also met with existentialists such as Nietzsche who have impacted the way modern people think very much. America had a civil war and started its two long paths; one to expanding its promise of freedom and equality to everyone instead of the few.; the other to dominating the world. There were many wars since the Colonial era, and two world wars which taught humanity they now have the power to destroy themselves practically overnight, and so many people live in a complex blend of fear and hope that exceeds the religiously dominated simplicity of human life until yesterday.

Mathematics has advanced along with science. Huygens, Leibnitz, and Newton have changed the world with their physics; and Maxwell’s equations gave us the ability to master electricity. Lorentz and Einstein figured out the theoretical implications of traveling through space at high speeds and we now have special and general relativity, and even more recently, quantum mechanics. Computers assist the flow of information at rapid speeds and the entire world is in communication like never before. The first men have landed on the moon and we have rovers on Mars. Genetic information is revisable and we have cloned animals.

Music and pop culture have become highly sexualized and society generally no longer finds certain behaviors and attitudes unacceptable. The church and political leadership can be outwardly criticized, and in the same breath, someone can advocate for others to become addicted to cocaine. The doctrines of freedom and equality; like Newtonian Physics and electrodynamics , weren’t universally accepted or seen as self-evident, or I daresay even taken for granted, as they are today. Economics has changed as well; communism has entered the fold and global and electronic trade has connected the world into one body of economic activity. Corporations are purchasable but also have rights, and there is now central banking and strange forms of insurance and taxation.

And this is all to say very little of the internet and population growth.

In short, I don’t think one month would be enough time even to provide a general overview of all these changes. At least, not in detail.

Everyone who is born into this world must accept it and adapt, and someone from the past would be no different. They would just have to assimilate like everyone else. If they have an interest in how things became that way, I think an historically based liberal arts education would be ideal for delivering that information.

Furthermore, it would be prudent to incorporate adaption coaching into curriculum to teach basic necessities such as how the english language has changed, how to use modern health care resources and hygiene, a primer on modern law and culture, navigating bureaucracy, and handling finances and property. Additionally it should direct the student towards resources for starting a vocation or entering university to develop skills that are in modern demand. 

Therefore, I think the program would have to be a live-in condition, where the student can be safely educated and housed, free from any concern about maintaining basic survival until they are adequately prepared. To tie this back to what I started with, the curriculum would be best facilitated and presented with the theme of historical dialectic and natural progression; the student should constantly be asking: how does this world follow from the one I lived in before?"
