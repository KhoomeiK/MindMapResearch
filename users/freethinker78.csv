In the occult, you may be transferring energies to another person. There was some Catholic rumour I heard when I was a child that everytime you masturbate and waste semen, a demon is born. The karma would get back at you in the form of someone masturbating about you. 

What I personally think? If you don't have other type of sex, masturbating is necessary,  to release your accumulated sexual energies which otherwise can create health problems for you. And masturbating without thinking in anyone probably is more difficult, I usually think about some situation in which there is other people, for example, I imagine a big guy having sex with me, etc. 

You could try spiritual practices to harness your sexual energy, but even Gandhi had problems with it. So good luck with that."

I am betting you have conflict of interests in this subject, but an adversarial reply is welcome for further independent analysis by a reader.   

> The potential market for a cancer curing drug is HUGE.

Certainly. So is the market for chemo treatments. 

> The company with such a drug would basically have a monopoly on the  entire oncology market because who would want to take the drug that only  partly treats the cancer instead of the drug that fully removes it. 

Question is, which would provide more profit to big pharma?  Cancer‚Äôs most promising therapies come with $100,000-plus price tags. What if one pharma company comes up with a cure that can be marketed for $10,000 and a generic version can come out that only costs $50?  

> do you think that they would simply scrap a drug for being TOO effective?  

Yes, I do. You think they wouldn't?

AskALiberal,ff3yfpb,t3_erd3ps,1579551585.0,"Tbh I have mixed feelings about gun control. As a person inclined towards Buddhism, I think the ideal would be a world without the use of weapons to attack people. But towards such a goal, neither citizens nor governments should have tools designed to cause harm to people. Gun control only aims to disarm citizens, while government remains fully armed. 

Then apparently my non-Buddhist side wants to participate in the thought process as well. This because I recognize that absolute Buddhism is ultimately a nihilist philosophy, strict adherence to which means the complete abandonment of self defense or the defense of others if such defense requires killing or gravely injure other people. Although I haven't abandoned the consideration that this should be actually be the way to live, my self preservation instincts want to recognize the importance of self defense and the defense of others even with the use of violence. 

Therefore I come to a thinking that disarming citizens might be a recipe for government oppression which might lead to massive bloodshed, and taking their right to proportionate self defense away. 

Given my mixed feelings, I encourage fellow Democrats to keep in their platform policies they think would be just and an instrument to bring a better society without bloodshed."
