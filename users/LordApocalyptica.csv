I'd personally try to lean really hard into that psychier indian element if it were a song I wrote -- I'm personally finding that that is territory where genres right now are seeing the most innovation -- but do whatever your own aim is.

As far as the mix goes though, that thunder at the end seemed way loud (though to be fair I just started listening to music on a new set of speakers with a subwoofer like 5 days ago so I may just not be used to that much bass).

SoundsLikeMusic,fdsazy6,t1_fdr9jxq,1578698458.0,"I’m not a physicist but I do a lot with audio, so I’ll take a whack at it.

Remember, sound is fundamentally a physical vibration. Different items thus produce different vibrations and different voicings. Fans already produce sound that we’re all familiar with, so turning it into a musical instrument was just a matter of controlling the vibrating parts (in this case the fan blades) to get pitches of your choosing.

Its interesting to note that a point closer to the center of a rotation moves slower than a point far away from center. The differences in rotational speed depending on distance from center is probably something he factored in and used to his advantage when figuring out what size gaps to cut and where. Speed affecting pitch is something you may have noticed before as a kid — perhaps when waving a plastic bat through the air or something. Conveniently, this being rotational speed means there are a lot of speeds happening at the same time at different points along the radius, which permits the easy access to different pitches.

From there, “playing” it is kinda like playing a guitar with a radial fretboard, where you hold the mic up to the fret to select your sound instead of plucking and fingering strings."

And *I’m* the one in the classrooms who takes multiple opportunities per class period to wash their hands if it shows up, or of I can’t take that opportunity I do the weird thing where I intentionally use different fingers than usual until I can. 

Lol, I literally signed back in to the building today (after leaving for lunch) using *my non dominant hand to write words* just so I could minimize germ spread as practically as possible with the time available.

I’m lucky enough that my “homeroom” actually has a sink in it — most people don’t usually have the luxury of the room they work in being the same room they can wash up in. The amount of time to walk between a classroom and bathroom seems like nothing until you do it multiple times in an hour and realize just a trip to wash your hands offsets your work time by 3 minutes.

Even just like...as someone who gardens and does yard work. If I were to give my hands a full wash between every use of outdoor and indoor equipment, I’d probably get like only 25% of my planned jobs done.

audioengineering,fdop2fu,t1_fdo5a5b,1578609707.0,"Maaaybe. Sometimes it depends on your particular system/setup/equipment. But it sounds solid.

When I’ve ever had “no sound” problems it’s almost always been a stupidly overlooked fix of “I plugged the guitar into my output jack instead of my input jack.” Since the actual units we use almost always only have female jacks, its an easy mistake. Have you checked to make sure the channels you’re actually sourcing from are both female output jacks? On equipment with a lot of ins/outs it can be easy to assume they’re set up differently than they actually are.

Also make sure that the mixer is actually sending the audio to the outputs. Its not uncommon the have to manually set up an output via the software etc. For mixers that are standalone, it may be a matter of just pushing a button (I.e. you left “mute” on) or actually hooking up the physical sends. For example if you’ve accidentally got Mixer L Out coming from the master outputs but Mixer R Out coming from a send output, this would happen because sends are manual. Or it could be as simple as “this cable is bad” so the mixer output is actually correct, its just there’s a jack that shouldn’t be trusted somewhere.

If you haven’t yet, I’d troubleshoot by hooking a speaker up to each channel at every intermediate point possible in sequence. That will help narrow down where in the setup the problem actually is."

Being able to delineate different genres is largely what helps us *make more genres*. It also helps us find sounds that are less popular. 

“Genre” doesn’t really matter anymore in its concrete sense, but the modern use as adjectives is immensely helpful. I sure as fuck don’t know what “Psychedelic Singer-Songwriter Sludge” sounds like, but damn now if I don’t wanna find it or make it myself. There are so many bands innovating today because we’ve embraced the power of both flexibility and delineation in genre descriptors. And being able to promote that innovation and flexibility starts at creating a baseline frame of reference like distinguishing between “Rock” and “Metal”

No, genre labels don’t change what I’m hearing. But they sure as hell help me find more of *what I want to hear or haven’t heard*. The only time genre is a problem is when people are diminutive dicks about it.

**EDIT:** Damn, this really got my gears turning in the morning. Anyway, expanding a bit in case it flies over anyone’s heads.

Delineation and description, even outside of genre, is pretty much *never* a bad thing. It’s in fact what allows us to learn *more* about these things. Problems from delineation only arise when people are dicks. For example: racism. Recognizing differences in ancestral genetics is actually *super* helpful for diagnosing disease. It has also helped with a lot of anthropological study and cultural exhibition. It only becomes a problem when *people are dicks about it.* The problem has never been the delineation itself; its the people using it (and meta-cognitively: the people putting down those who delineate) to put others down. Those are the people using it to boost their own egos.

Wrapping back to the genre discussion for concretion: diminution of someone for delineating is just as malicious as diminution of a genre. Guys, yes, rock and metal are different... **AND THAT’S OK**. Use that as a platform to discuss what elements of a band are rock and what elements are metal and how the band blurs the line. Its super fun when you get the ego part of genre discussion put of the way and focus on the identification, intermingling, and “adjective-izing”.

Blame the dicks, not the differences. Recognize differences and allow them to enrich you and others. Celebrate being able to recognize new things and that things can be different. It makes things pretty wild as long as you aren’t mean."

Whether or not you can outplay your opponent is no longer a complete measure of skill, but a significant bit of luck in what level of inaccuracy the game adds.

343 has stated that they'd completely remove bloom if it weren't for the fact that Reach's weapon balance was *built* with bloom in mind. Even in SWAT its technically an issue; with the magnum as your secondary, you'd practically have a pocket DMR with an insane fire rate if bloom was removed.

IIRC bloom was removed in later installments (Halo 4, 5) or so significantly humbled that it barely affects the gameplay because of how much of a detriment it was to competition.

**SUPEREDIT:** Wow ok lol this is just a normal comment and I’ve got 1k+ upvotes plus silver. I figure a lot of it has to do with new players to Reach due to MCC PC, and considering this is an immensely exposed comment for some reason I’mma take the responsibility/opportunity to make it more comprehensive for future use. So a few things showing up often in replies etc.:

1. **Bullet Spread vs. Bloom**
As far as this topic is concerned, Bullet Spread refers to a fixed spread or overall spread, while Bloom refers specifically to *spread with a direct correlation to how fast you pull the trigger.* Technically Bloom is a subset of the former, but the point of this is: the faster you pull the trigger, the more the added inaccuracy *blooms.*

2. **Presence of Reach’s Lifespan**
Reach started with its fullest bloom settings, and in a Title Update (i.e. a patch) was officially reduced. Towards this time period and the end of Reach’s lifespan, there were Zero Bloom settings for competitive purposes

3. **Other Games**
So I’m not a scholar on bloom in Halo, but to my knowledge Bloom was not present in Halo until Reach. A recent comment states otherwise regarding Halo CE. I’m out of my depth there, but for most purposes I believe Bloom was not utilized (at least noticeably) up until Reach.



~~Edit: addendum: I forgot to mention that bloom specifically refers to how inaccuracy gets worse over repeated fire. I.e. unless you pace your shots, the inaccuracy *blooms*~~"
