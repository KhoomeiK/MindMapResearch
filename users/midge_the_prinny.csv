fatlogic,fdcqb7e,t3_ekd3yk,1578281368.0,I will never understand how someone’s decision to do something with their own body is taken as a referendum on the other person’s. This person is so insecure and self absorbed. Yuck.
fatlogic,fcwfda8,t3_ej6o9x,1578024197.0,I’d tell them they need to see someone else bc we aren’t interested in committing malpractice today.
FeminineNotFeminist,fcw5kqr,t1_fcszkqd,1578017672.0,"It is, but it’s in my budget and worth it, in my opinion. No one should spend beyond their means and I haven’t always done this much. It’s a priority for me though and I have the money, so this is what I do now.  Obviously, not everyone would choose to do this even if they had the money, but that’s their decision."

fatlogic,fcn3i0n,t3_ehv5cd,1577802245.0,Am I allowed to say that treating your body like a fast food dumpster is suicide?
netflixwitcher,fbryg3b,t1_fbrneqe,1577047811.0,Interesting. Maybe I’ll check those out before continuing my watch of the series. Thx!
