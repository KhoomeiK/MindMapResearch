Warhammer40k,fexyqct,t1_fexpirg,1579438437.0,"Just had a quick look at wet blending. Think using lahmian medium straight onto the model, then adding the colour would give you the same effect as applying a clear glaze then colour?"
Warhammer40k,fexye8n,t1_fexsdmm,1579438281.0,Thanks for this mate! Appreciate it.
Warhammer40k,fexya19,t1_fexhp43,1579438228.0,"Thanks mate, really appreciate you taking the time to reply! I'll try doing just that."
Warhammer40k,fexgnqg,t1_fexe59b,1579430683.0,"Yeah, I agree! Good first job. The quality you get from thinning down your paints makes a huge difference. Build up you colour in layers."
Tinder,femjtbw,t3_epuo3b,1579259207.0,All good. You're not looking at the mantlepeice when you're poking the fire.
stopdrinking,feel3zl,t3_eol7aq,1579035947.0,That funky fortnight feeling! Well done!
skateboarding,fe1jma7,t3_ench90,1578827347.0,Outstanding brother!!
stopdrinking,fdzh76k,t3_end5g1,1578790208.0,"Congratulations brother! Making my way through this weekend as well. We share the same starting point. We can do this. You can do this.

stopdrinking,fdx5ehu,t1_fdvnfi3,1578765521.0,Thank you!

stopdrinking,fdv1rd0,t3_en33e8,1578742171.0,"Another Scot checking in. 

Got a day planned in Glasgow with my son who I've not seen since boxing day. Time for him to spend his christmas money on all the things he loves and I'm grateful that I am present both physically and mentally to share that joy with him.

IWNDWYT!"
stopdrinking,fdr5k33,t3_emryvt,1578679743.0,"Well done, you've done yourself and your Dad proud!"
stopdrinking,fdnb6i2,t1_fdna7bh,1578581987.0,I relate completely to this.
stopdrinking,fdnb3yf,t3_ema9bq,1578581941.0,"I'm guilty of going back and believing I have control. Which I do for a period, but then old habits start to come back and the greed when drinking becomes greater. I wish that anyone who wants to be able to drink moderately can do so successfully. Best of luck!"
stopdrinking,fdn8os7,t3_em7n5u,1578580257.0,"As others have said, you're not powerless. Your acknowledgment gives you power as it shows the  ability to build the strength to beat it, one day at a time. IWNDWYT!"

trashy,fdjrs7g,t1_fdijjem,1578485096.0,"It's their job to ensure its clean from general mess, like spills, popcorn etc. It really shouldn't be an expectation for them to have to pick up after adults who are perfectly capable of throwing their trash in the bins on the way out."
trashy,fdjrq5g,t1_fdjqr0k,1578485029.0,Exactly! This isnt even a generational thing either. I see all ages treat cinema halls like dumping grounds. Really feel for the staff having to clean each hall after every movie.
AskReddit,fdig014,t3_elbejj,1578442055.0,"""Same difference""

Sorry, what!?"
nextfuckinglevel,fdiez52,t1_fdi7v61,1578441390.0,Dammit!
nextfuckinglevel,fdi4zuv,t1_fdi4jbg,1578435831.0,"r/woooosh

Edit: I do admit that on this post I did miss an 'o'."
trashy,fdi277z,t3_eleewm,1578434412.0,Same goes for cinema halls. How hard is it to dump your trash as you leave rather than expect someone to come and clean up behind you.
Warhammer40k,fdhfpua,t1_fdb52gi,1578421682.0,"Love this comment, thanks for taking the time! It's much appreciated."
stopdrinking,fdhdssp,t3_eleobz,1578420570.0,"The fact that you keep trying speaks volumes. If you lacked strength or character then you wouldn't be at day 1. Take something from that. 

At the risk of sounding like an arse and quoting from a film ""Its not about hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward""

That last drink was you're last knock, but you got up and have moved forward. Doesnt matter how many times, so long as you dont give up. You'll beat this mate and I say this having reached day 7 for only the 3rd time since I started drinking."
Warhammer40k,fd8qm40,t1_fd8lv39,1578221936.0,Thanks for the encouragement bud! Glad to have stuck with this attempt as its definitely brought back the joy I experienced with this hobby as a young teen. Plus this sub is pretty inspiring.
Warhammer40k,fd6ltof,t1_fd6jxdi,1578192881.0,"Thanks mate, will do!"
Warhammer40k,fd6i3sg,t1_fd6h6yn,1578191374.0,Models were based using mechanicus standard grey with an airbrush. When attempting to dry brush some highlighting with dawnstone it went on really coarse unfortunately. I hadn't considered using a primer prior to the base coat.
Warhammer40k,fd6feno,t1_fd6cj5p,1578190150.0,Thanks bud!
Warhammer40k,fcsauox,t1_fcr8yk8,1577913948.0,"Agreed, some drybrushing and edge highlighting would make this really pop."

We are talking about folk who just wanna see titties. So wont exactly know how to fully utilise a search engine.

Regardless, it's all quite seedy as f**k."
EarthPorn,fc12f39,t3_efhnb7,1577306321.0,Looks like a good spot to mount a black diablos.
facepalm,fc0ss3y,t1_fc0jab0,1577298831.0,This was a thing a while back after private photos of hers were leaked. Dark pockets of the internet were scrambling trying to find/share them.
