I mostly dealt with intake and my clients were elderly so if I didn’t say where I was calling from they would never call back. A lot of elderly in my county knew us by the name of our organization but they were almost never the ones calling for our services (because “there’s no way I could qualify I’m way too independent”) -even if the hospital/rehab told them we’d be calling they often wouldn’t remember and definitely wouldn’t recognize just a number.

You can easily say “hi this is so and so calling from this office, please give me a call back when you’ve got a chance” without even saying who you’re calling for or why. They know if they’re expecting a call or who their doctors/case workers are. They have to confirm themselves when they call back, so no HIPPA has been violated."

Refusing to watch Lily May be what’s best for both of them- but I highly doubt it’s protecting Lily.  If she can’t even look at  a damn drawing it won’t matter that Lily will age. Lily will eventually get old enough to realize her aunt hates her and that’ll potentially damage any adult relationship they could ever have. 

 She’s NOT putting on a facade. She’s not faking it. Unlike your son and your best friend- Lily lives with the person who hates her. And she doesn’t even try to hide it."
AmItheAsshole,fepona9,t1_fep90ff,1579326239.0,"I couldn’t imagine treating anyone I chose to live with like this. Personally I think she’s disrespecting her niece and both her siblings.  

And even with an animal. My roommate has a cat and a dog. I chose to live with her. I hate cats and her dog can sometimes be a pain. She doesn’t ask me to walk her dog or change the litter box, but occasionally just put food out if she’s going to be out. If I’m not around she has friends who will swing by (like on days she has work then class) but similar to this situation - I don’t want to be responsible for her animals, and it’s very rare that I am- but it’s just wasting her friends time for them to come over if I’m just sitting here.  It’s really not that hard for me to do... and takes a all of about 2 mins. It doesn’t matter that they’re not my animals or  oftentimes I don’t like them... it’s the decent thing to do."
AmItheAsshole,fepo1i6,t1_fepfvt4,1579325714.0,"Your last paragraph, it really doesn’t matter if they don’t point it out. She flat out tells Lily no when Lily asked to show her a drawing or something. If lily doesn’t already know Jenny hates her, she’s going to figure it out soon. If Jenny doesn’t step up and stop being an ass she’s going to lose the respect of both her siblings and her niece who won’t remain a kid forever. It’s not like being an adult with a roommate you are only friendly in passing with but doing really talk to. Kids are inquisitive and I doubt she’s going to stop trying to communicate with Jenny just because she says no. It’s an adult she lives with not a stranger. 

If you never want to be responsible for a kid or communicate with a kid- don’t live with one. She’s in college not her teens. She could move out. And that doesn’t mean to being walked over and used as a constant backup babysitter.  But friends, family- they have emergencies. Is she only going to be friends with other child free people? What’s see going to do- drop her best friends once they have kids? Never help out if they’re in an emergency? I guess it’s not a requirement but that would definitely put a strain on the relationship. Beyond being an ass to Lily, it’s also pretty disrespectful to OP. The daycare is right near home so it’s bad enough OP is driving like an hour and a half round trip to (decently) help out when she’s right there. But then for an hour till mom gets home there needs to be two adults at home to watch one kid drawing/watch tv... and one of the adults lives there? Seems like a time waster. Even yelling for her sister when Lily asked for a sandwich. You’re making a sandwich... how hard is it to make another one?"

I’d also recommend folding down pages with the big charts that break out the differences because those were a lifesaver on test day.

AmItheAsshole,fefrli1,t1_fefew8j,1579063153.0,"I remember a story from about a year ago about a guy in his 20s who aged out of his parents insurance and couldn’t afford insurance so was saving up. He was going to get back on insurance the next month but in the meantime he was rationing and going without his insulin because it was too expensive. He died before he managed to get back on insurance. 

My best friend is a type 1 diabetic and he told me that last year his insurance saved him around $30k according to the report he got for all his supplies... which if he lost his insurance he would never be able to afford. He collapsed when I was visiting once after suffering excruciating headpains all day so I took him to the ER. He wasn’t really with it, and the hospital was crap and didn’t do anything for him, so he jokingly gave me crap when the bill came. He dropped it when I told him I could barely get him to his car and he was just lucky I didn’t call an ambulance. I probably should have, and if cost wasn’t a factor, I would have.

I was an average server in a cheap restaurant and I still pulled home on average over $600/week so bitching about $5 being a poor tip when it's 20% is being picky. In a normal week, unless you're a subpar server or in a really stingy customer base, the great tips more than outweigh the average, bad, or no tips. 

The only time anyone bitched about $5 was if the table decided to camp and didnt consider that when they tipped."

AmItheAsshole,fdsypvn,t1_fdstgrf,1578709676.0,"Idk. As reasonable as it may be to wonder that when BC fails, I feel like only someone who is capable of thinking out all possibilities would truly foresee that being the first question. You’d have to overcome all your emotions- and being the one who (and I’m just assuming OP is telling the truth) knows 100% she didn’t cheat- that thought may never have even crossed her mind that he would think that. I don’t even think it’s irrational for him to ask it. Just...not immediately."
AmItheAsshole,fdspfl3,t1_fdslki8,1578706240.0,"I think anyone, no matter who it is, is an asshole if the first thing they or say is that you must’ve cheated the minute you say you’re pregnant. Wanting a pregnancy test and asking for one before anything else makes him an asshole. Regardless he was never going to get one if she was getting an abortion so the relationship was ruined the second he thought it and especially the second he said it. Maybe going nuclear wasnt the best option- but either way the relationship was done. 

And what’re they teaching now? I’m 30 and the people I know who had kids on BC are generally older than me. Sex education is still shit in plenty of places so 15-20+ years ago it likely was even worse. I had pretty decent sex education but considering lots of places still teach abstinence or gloss over the basics it’s not shocking that there are lots of people that don’t understand the intricacies of the best way to use birth control/condoms/ etc to minimize your risk of pregnancy."
AmItheAsshole,fdscds8,t1_fds3ykk,1578699391.0,"I’ve been friends with plenty of people who have kids despite one or multiple forms of BC failing. It happens. People are incredibly ill informed about the effectiveness of BC and what interacts with it.  I was on a medication for months before a pharmacist pointed out that it made my BC ineffective for preventing babies. Ive been put on plenty of meds that my docs have no idea it interacts until I look it up. For all he(or she) knows...she was taking some medication that made her BC not work, then the condom fails. Bam. Baby. 

It’s not only about BC and condoms either. There are plenty of people who don’t realize that just coz a guy has a vasectomy doesn’t mean he’s no longer loaded and jump to the cheating thing too. Plenty of guys never go back to check their sperm counts because even after going through with the procedure they don’t understand there is still a chance of it failing.

I also doubt a girl who took multiple years to be comfortable having sex with one guy would care that condoms “ruin the experience”."

Realized my mistake right after I got outside the station. Conductors helped me searched and I checked lost & found. Nothing. Pulled out my iPad to check the find my iPhone and I had a message from my friend I was texting that morning telling me the guy sitting across from me had already reached out and told me where he worked so I could get my phone.

SleepApnea,fcm78qa,t3_ehxhin,1577766060.0,"Your best bet is to see a sleep specialist and do a sleep study. Could be sleep apnea, could be narcolepsy, could be both, could be neither.  There are so many different causes of excessive fatigue that without seeing a doc it would be hard to say for sure one way or another. 

Regardless, if it is- its not the end of the world. You work with your doc to treat it. Depending on the diagnosis it may end up being something you treat rather than cure, but it doesn’t mean you’ve irreparably damaged your body. I was diagnosed at 22 with narcolepsy and 29 with sleep apnea. While it makes things more difficult and sometimes it makes things near impossible, it doesn’t need to stop you from living an overall healthy life."
IdiotsInCars,fcd1dib,t1_fccnpmj,1577605151.0,I mean if you watch the entire video you can see there was no one in the lane OP swerved into.

AmItheAsshole,fcb4tp7,t1_fcb1s4c,1577582359.0,"Idk, ive had convos with gen zers who honestly didn’t think the recession was that bad, I doubt my 20 year old brother even knows there was a recession. I honestly don’t see how being raised in an economic boom makes us more optimistic. It just means we came of age just in time to miss out on everything we’d grown up being promised."
AmItheAsshole,fcayawg,t1_fcasyu4,1577579015.0,This is the first I’m hearing that millennials are supposed to be optimistic. 30 and definitely don’t have any of that optimism.
JUSTNOMIL,fc9ei1v,t1_fc8kudr,1577551454.0,They shouldn’t separate you. My mom and brother went into a domestic violence shelter when he was 13. The shelter only accepted mothers and their children. I was 23 so I was unable to be on the premises- but it helped them get back on their feet. This was initiated a welfare/food stamp office so when you get where you’re going I’d look into social services and stop in to see what they can offer.
MAguns,fc4hm9o,t1_fc4g045,1577416903.0,My friends sold one of his shotguns in the parking lot of a police station that had one of those Internet safe spots in Michigan. He now has a fun conversation topic of how someone saw them in the parking lot with a gun and called to warn the cops. Fortunately they were very friendly and understanding.
boston,fc3uwys,t1_fc3hshp,1577399262.0,I know there’s a cop holding up traffic to prevent this one light past south station but I will never understand why there isn’t a cop during rush hour doing the same at south station. I made a wrong turn once (turned right towards seaport instead of left) and it took me 25 minutes just to get back through the light because of people blocking it.
CPA,fc3spgx,t1_fc3s3uv,1577397648.0,"Possibly. My coworker was notified he needed to send the transcripts when he went to apply for a new NTS, if you’re able to apply you should be OK for now- but I would definitely resend after graduation. Nasba wouldn’t even let him complete a second application until they received his transcript and cleared the hold."
CPA,fc3qs5a,t1_fc3n3u4,1577396277.0,It’s a one time thing unless you haven’t gotten your bachelors yet. A coworker of mine applied before graduation and forgot to send in his transcript after graduating which puts a hold on getting a second NTS.
SleepApnea,fc2ylg7,t1_fc2xdqo,1577377428.0,Thank you!
SleepApnea,fc2yjm3,t1_fc2wal7,1577377396.0,I’m not getting a leak near the eyes but it definitely hasn’t been staying tight on my nose when I lay on my side.
CPA,fc2uw12,t3_efulmv,1577374696.0,I got my NTS within 24 hours the second time around. Of course with the holidays it might take a little extra time but you should have it very quick.
Narcolepsy,fc155wd,t1_fc0zc5z,1577308558.0,"Honestly the portrayal of narcolepsy is what made me think I didn’t have it. I was a senior in college, and a psych major, when I went for my first sleep study. I knew about narcolepsy- but only in its most extreme form. When talking about sleep disorders we watched a video of a narcoleptic dog that went from playing fetch to passing out mid jump and so I honestly still thought narcolepsy that was narcolepsy. It wasn’t until I’d talked to a sleep specialist that I realized my classes didn’t do a good job of explaining it."
AmItheAsshole,fbyc0l8,t1_fbybk75,1577213125.0,EXACTLY!!!! He’s not on her fucking team. Do you know what labor is like you fucking imbecile? If all you’re going to do is fucking sit there and stare at her fucking vagina he’s not fucking helpful and therefore doesn’t need to be there. How fucking awkward and uncomfortable would it be while you’re spread wide open would it be for him to just be staring. I wouldn’t even want that with someone I was in a loving relationship with. Maybe take a peek while the babies actually coming out but most guys are there holding your hand not just staring. She straight up said if he was going to be supportive she’d be fine with him being there but HE said he wouldn’t support her at all just wanted to see the birth. You’re clearly a fucking idiot so goodbye.
