NintendoSwitch,ff2xpeq,t3_er8epn,1579527948.0,"Like others have said, it's sort be of a life sim, but it's also much more relaxed... Or tedious depending on how you like to play. 

I haven't played New Lead (3DS) where they introduce the mechanic of being the Mayor and planning out the town, but in all other games you basically move into a small village with humanized animal neighbors, and take on little activities to earn money to pay the mortgage of your new home, and eventually upgrade it. 

You can fish, dig up treasures, catch bugs, harvest fruits, run errands for villagers , write letters to villagers and sell most of what you get to help pay the bill... Or just buy a ton of stuff!!

The store has new items every day to customize your place, or your wardrobe, there's usually a shop in town that let's you design custom clothes, and there's traveling merchants or guests from time to time that sell or give out unique items. There's also seasonal holidays, and this is where the real time clock comes in to play. 

The game matches your real world time. Some events, some fish or bugs, are only available on certain times or certain days. So what happens when real life gets in the way and you miss out? Just that. You miss out, because life got in the way. Don't try to change your time settings either, or reset, because the game will usually have a feature on place to tell at you for doing so, usually in the form of an angry mole. The more you play against the rules, the longer the lecture you get about how you can't just ghit reset on real life. 

So yeah, if you like to sit and play video games for hours on end, animal crossing may not be for you. The activities you do are better for small bursts, and since the game runs on real time, it's best to play throughout the day. 

It's a great game to kick back and relax with. Personally I plan on buying this digitally, it'll be much easier to play wherever whenever."

tifu,fep5gmy,t1_feoywjs,1579312556.0,"Oh man. Reminds me of my first time. 

I was with this girl, she didn't believe when I said I was a virgin, probably because we did some other stuff and must have seemed like I knew what I was doing. 

One night my parents are out of town so she plans on staying the weekend. I thought yeah maybe we'll actually have sex, we've been close before but it's always at her house and there were always people over. But I was also too stupid to think I should probably have condoms. 

So he comes over, doesn't take long for the making out and heavy petting. Obviously it was leading towards sex and she asked if I had a condom, and o was honest said no, and reminded her that I didn't really have use for them as I had not had sex yet, and just wasn't something I kept on hand in the off chance that would change. She's like so go get some? 

Luckily my folks left the car behind in case of emergencies, and boy did this feel like an emergency. There was no where nearby that was open, so I had to drive 15 mins across town to a Walgreens that's open 24/7. At that point I realized I didn't know where the condoms were, and instead of asking I just walked around the pharmacy aisle looking for Trojans since it's the only condom brand I'd ever heard of (thank god for condom commercials, good job marketing, Trojan!).

What felt like an eternity later, I found them, had to wait on the longest line, felt all sorts of horny anxious and confused, made zero eye contact with the old lady cashier while also trying to hide the biggest smile of my life. 

On my way out I ran into some dude I met at a friend's party a few nights before, who claimed to be a magician... And he recognized me so he's trying to catch up and be friendly, but by this point it felt like it's been an hour since I left home and I had to interrupt him ""sorry dude I don't mean to be rude but I bought these condoms and I really wanna use em so I'll catch ya later!"" And drove off in my mom's minivan. 

I got home and... She fell asleep waiting. Luckily she's a light sleeper and woke up when I got into bed and the make out continued soon after. Glad I bought the big box cuz I totally proved I was a virgin, but we had our fun in the end."

Honestly this is one of the reasons I never used a screen protector on my phone, because they always did this, or would start to peel somewhere and the adhesive would collect dirt/lint and look funky and I didn't want to buy a new protector every couple of weeks. 

Wasn't until the switch and Reddit that people pointed out there are glass screen protectors. Bought one before I got my switch on launch, placed it on before even turning the system on, no bubbles, no fuss, still looks great 3 years later.

Funny how your math works out for your argument, when the reality is that buying Sun + Ult Sun for $80 is you comparing a 3ds game price to a Switch game price. 

If Sword had a Ultra Sword release, that would be $120 for both, whereas the DLC model is $90. I think your average non salty gamer would prefer spending an additional $30 over an additional $60 on that extra content PLUS the convenience of not having to replay the same story from the beginning.

What I can say is the state I'm in determines health coverage eligibility based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) which you'd think would be an average nation wide, yet it's somehow higher for Hawaii and Alaska. Also, the state I'm in is huge, and living expenses where I am are vastly greater than some of the more rural parts of the state, so even if it was based on a State poverty level, averaging income and living expenses like that leaves some people at a disadvantage.

Correct. 

I work in state run health insurance (think Medicaid) and while the state tries to do checks on their own using someone's Social, from time to time they need more information. 

I can't count how many times I've had to explain that a Bank statement is not proof of income, or how the state needs to confirm gross income (and how a bank statement would only show your net anyway), or how some people (like myself) have my paycheck direct deposited into two banks, this showing one statement still wouldn't be sufficient.

Because that's exactly why they announced it with no more than a logo. 

Context matters here. They sounded it before announcing the 3ds title because the last time they announced a metroid game for 3ds, it was federation Force and the loud parts of the internet were hating it. They wanted to avoid the negative PR, that was all. 

Remember, a similar thing happened when the Luigi's Mansion 3ds port was announced. Reddit, YouTube, Instagram and I would assume their FB page were flooded with ""why isn't this on switch?"" comments. He'll, I have a buddy at work that finally picked up LM3 for Christmas and he's still lamenting that the first game was ported to 3ds and not switch."

Completely agree, which is why I hope you don't get downvoted for having a different opinion. I wouldn't mind a 30 minute battle, but yeah if the game doesn't explain those mechanics well and I'm just moving pieces sound the board hoping to win, I would be bored and regret my purchase too. 

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about Mario + rabbids for example, I'm not big on strategy games, but I ended up loving that, and yeah some boss battles took forever, for various reasons, but at least I knew what I was doing."
NintendoSwitch,fddi1zd,t1_fdcv3rp,1578313150.0,"Trust me, I know the feeling. The most I can do right now is 2, maybe 3 games at a time tops. But it also depends on the game.in September I was trying to do Links Awakening with Astral Chain. AC was my ""main game"" and would play that on the weekend, where as LA was my ""side game"" that I could play in smaller burst. Explore a bit, reach a dungeon, save and quit. Pick it up the next day, do the dungeon, save and quit. Weekend rolls around, spend most of the day doing a single mission in AC cuz I like to explore, and I'd im not too tired maybe replay an older mission to catch things I missed. 

It was fine, but I feel like it's such an adult way to play games. It felt too responsible, I just wish I had the kind of time and energy to play a game on the weekend through the entire night and he to sleep much later than what would be healthy. Fucking responsibilities man.."

Pretty soon you'll have something added to your combat repertoire to do all those fun combos. 

Just make sure you dive into the menus periodically. You can use WP (weapon points) to level up your combat arts (like Rex's grapple move from the very beginning of the game) for more damage and bonuses, as it doesn't level up automatically with your character level. 

Before long your arts will fill faster and you'll barely need to auto attack. By the end of the game I remember being able to do that thrusting move repeatedly while some of the other art gauges filled, the more arts you do the faster your special gauge fills, the faster you can level up your special attack, and the more likely you are too pull off those sick blade combos. 

Just remember that the more blade options you and your team have the better, and make sure the blade weapon types (sword, knuckles, ball, cannon, etc) you assign to your party have skills that compliment each other. Rex by default has a Break maneuver, so someone (whether a blade on Rex or someone else) has a move that can Topple, then one that can Launch, the. One that can Slam for those type of combos. Trust me, it's really satisfying when you're facing a tough enemy but you can break/topple/launch/smash them for crazy big damage, and then perform an elemental combo on top of that."
NintendoSwitch,fdcqtt3,t1_fdcoxnl,1578281753.0,"If I remember correctly, XC2 picks up around the third chapter. Don't dick around with sidequest because as far as I can tell, anything you get that early on can be completed at any point. I think there's maybe only one area later in the game where sidequest can be missed due to story progression. So just rush through the story a bit and worry about exploration later.

Also, crafting system? I don't recall a crafting system.. for me the biggest hurdle with the beginning of that game was the combat. It starts off so slow with little to no options, but by chapter 3 I believe you'll have a party of 3 (you gain more characters later but can only have 3 active in combat) as well as unlocking the combat combos, which made the combat really fun, IMO. Just don't forget to use the core crystals to unlock blades like I did. 

I spent longer than I'd like to admit using only pyra and the one common blade I unlocked as party of the tutorial."

Xenoblade on Wii was like this for me. Hadn't played a proper rpg since SNES, had no idea how the cake mechanics worked, wasn't following the story much and put the game down for months, picked it back up and felt way more lost than before but I plowed through and by the end of it was amazed with the game.

I work all over Westchester, we do home visits to help people apply for health insurance, and I know Yorktown heights fairly well. This type of house could be shared by multiple families,  each one just barely surviving. 

I grew up in Yonkers and the Bronx, to me the ghetto neighborhoods looked like projects and old apartment buildings, maybe the occasional crack house with boarded up windows. Then I started this job, dealing with mostly Medicaid eligible recipients (read: poor) and working on areas like Yorktown Heights and Peekskill.

NintendoSwitch,fdb75i3,t1_fda39zi,1578254509.0,"Agreed, it really isn't. 

I have at least like 40 games, mostly digital, on my switch and the games that end up in the ""all games"" section are either games I've already completed and haven't gone back to in a while it games I haven't touched yet. 

Everything on the home screen is something I've played recently and personally I don't ever really juggle more than 3 games at a time, so everything is super easy to find. 

I can see how having folders would make organization better, even I moved my completed games and demos into appropriately titles folders on my 3ds and Wii U, but those folders tend to look really bland and ugly compared to the rest of the icons, so I ended up moving those off screen anyway. 

Themes would be nice too,. It it's not a deal breaker. I'm not on the home screen more than a few seconds to enjoy a theme, and after hearing the annoying music on my roommates PlayStation theme play on a loop for so long, I don't think I'd ever use such a thing in my switch given the option. Again, I can see why people want it, but it isn't a deal breaker. 

It's a console first and foremost, not a media center. I use it to play games, not browse Twitter, not to watch movies, just games. And it does that well."
