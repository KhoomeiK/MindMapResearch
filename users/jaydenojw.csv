I feel like Woodward and Co will have a backup plan, like heavily advertising tickets to sell to maybe overseas United fans or what not.

I'm kinda tired of all this shit, but sometimes a reform, we will go to places that are very low for us but it's essential because of going rock bottom, then we can learn and go back up. I'm just saying this to console my passion for this club."
