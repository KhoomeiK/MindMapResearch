He also seems to be attracted to women who get quite attached or what he would call ""dependant"".

It sounds like this is how he treats his partners, it might be how he treats his secondaries. It's also possible that his other partner has her own issues and he's prioritising her over all others which is why the both of you are struggling.

It sounds like he's not treating either of you fairly unless he's alone with one of you.

Btw, I'm poly and my wife is mono. She's been incredibly supportive, I've also had to take the time to work on myself to make sure that I'm being fair to her. Its obviously harder than if we were both poly but we still want to be together so we put in the effort."

This is unacceptable. He needs to be able to manage his relationships. Its possible that he has plans and doesn't have time on that particular day/week but then another suitable time should be arranged when he is not busy. He is not doing anything to be there for you. He is completely unreasonable.

>I considered leaving but this relationship means too much to me and I just don't want to lose it. At the same time, it's often so painful and unfair, and I really want to accept things but I have no idea how.

I can't help but think that this relationship means more to you than it does for him. And I'm really sorry to say that. You deserve to be treated better. You are being so understandable and trying to work through your discomfort, you seem to be communicating really well about your difficulties but he is putting in zero effort and is not even remotely trying to support you.

The reason you can't accept things is because there are some very basic needs, support, respect, understanding, that he is not offering you.  No one should accept that, even nonmonogamous folk."

Expecting someone to be in a constant state of obedience as the object of desire is unfair, unreasonable, and disrespectful. It's one dinner.

If he instead said:

""Sweety, love of my life, light of my days. You know you are the world to me, I adore you. You are carrying our baby and I can not imagine how hard, tiring, and weird that must feel. I also noticed you didnt shave your legs today before going out. You know I don't find hair legs attractive. Next time, if you don't feel up to it, I could shave your legs for you before we go out. If not, we won't go out.""

He'd still be a misogynistic ass hole. 

Had this been a sex thing or a date and he said:

""Sweety, love of my life, light of my days. You know you are the world to me, I adore you. You are carrying our baby and I can not imagine how hard, tiring, and weird that must feel. I also noticed you didnt shave your legs today before going out. When it comes to sex, I prefer shaved legs. Next time, if you don't feel up to it, I could shave your legs for you before we go out/get sexy. If not, we won't go out/get sexy.""

There is room for consideration so long as:
1. The partner is happy to and doesn't find it offensive.

To summarise:
This is an every day dinner thing, and she does not need to meet his standard of beauty every single day. Or ever should she decide it her preference."
AmItheAsshole,fcsqc4e,t1_fcsltb1,1577922425.0,Okies. If we become friends I'll keep that in mind.
AmItheAsshole,fcshl9q,t1_fcsh5dn,1577916680.0,"Nope not delivery. It was his expectation of his wife. The fact that it's not acceptable for her to be anything other than desirable for him a d that she is obligated to be attractive to him in public is absolutely appalling.

This is not something that was worth bringing up, regardless if how nicely he delivered it he was telling her that she was wrong to leave the house without shaving her legs. That is appalling."
AmItheAsshole,fcsgv2q,t1_fcsfbk1,1577916342.0,">When we got home my husband went on about how gross my legs look since I haven't shaved and how ""nobody wants to look at that while eating"" apparently because I knew we were going out I could've gone somewhere to wax my legs, at least.

The husband chastised his wife for not being attractive to him in public. Ass hole. It's not about what he finds attractive it's about him having unreasonable expectations of her and throwing a hissy fit because of her natural body."
AmItheAsshole,fcsdccu,t1_fcscata,1577914953.0,Nope. Not basic grooming. There is no difference between the hair on a woman's leg and the hair on a man's leg other than people have different sexist standards for men and women.
AmItheAsshole,fcsd5ry,t1_fcsbgfx,1577914877.0,"Because it doesn't exist. There is no reason. The only valid reason anyone has to shave their legs would be ""oo I want to shave my legs today""."
AmItheAsshole,fcscwow,t1_fcs9mfm,1577914779.0,"Regardless of his delivery not his legs, not his problem. Hair is perfectly natural and he should get over his sexist shit."
