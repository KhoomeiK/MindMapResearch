gaming,fffn827,t1_fffkbzo,1579887593.0,I figured this out preety quick after getting introduced to this game and also learned I'm preety sadistic.
interestingasfuck,fffn2ef,t3_etap4h,1579887497.0,I dont know why but this really creeps me out.
NoMansSkyTheGame,ffbxxfr,t3_esl57u,1579786314.0,Fuck yes! I love this studio and game soo much. Keep doing great work hello games! Hope to see more titles from yall too.
worldpolitics,ffbwxe4,t1_ffbvwbw,1579785451.0,Because one side (democratic minority) is pleading heavily to have a fair and legit trial with witnesses like a real court and the other side (Republican majority) just wants it to be over and done without hearing the case because most of their minds were made up even before the impeachment. Partisanism will sadly be the death of our democracy. It was literally reps on the floor sleep lastnight. Disgraceful!!!
worldpolitics,ffau7zg,t1_ffampxm,1579744602.0,And this is the beauty if being a independent! Fuck all the tribalism shit and actually form your own opinion.  Do your damn research if you actually wanna talk the shit instead if just easy name calling. To even call yourself a conservative and support trump still us laughable. Wanna be a true patriot do your damn homework and realize this bacon is truly disrespecting our country!
worldpolitics,ffatfkd,t1_ffaj2p2,1579744080.0,Sadly fox is normally for those Americans who wanna feel informed but cant stand to actually watch a hr long hearing or speech.

worldpolitics,ff875t9,t1_ff63f3t,1579667919.0,Bringing up to a Republican family member who was praising Dr. King that he would probably hate him if he was still alive because of his obvious socialist outlook was such a satisfying meltdown to entice.
aww,ff54514,t1_ff4x9w1,1579579711.0,I'm sorry for your loss. And yehh many factors go into aggression. I just see it as any dog can snap unfortunately. Just gotta be cautious and limit those factorsas much as possible.

rickandmorty,ff39ub2,t1_ff39qi9,1579537062.0,Haha let's be real half the beauty in rick and morty is the trolling aspect of it. To be a fan of this show you gotta love pain

oddlysatisfying,fes618l,t1_feryrs2,1579361813.0,It's like in karate movies after they meet sowards and pause for a moment to assets eachother next move. Only one cat will leave that living room alive.

television,fejpw39,t1_fej3ope,1579182801.0,I have to wholly disagree with this. There are still soo many little known amazing stories to be told from that era. When I first heard they wanted to do a revisionist history of this my hate for these to asshats began.
politics,feg0ig5,t1_fefurzi,1579071745.0,That was my beef with bernie in 2016. If he ran as a independent like he was  at that time I feel like he would of definitely won.

PowerTV,fe3nphe,t1_fe0dc3p,1578851109.0,Wish this episode never happened. Fucking pointless.
PowerTV,fe3ne1x,t1_fe0e38j,1578850954.0,I agree. If it wasnt tasha it was someone she worked with...probably tommy. Tasha basically said it when she was talking to Paz.
PowerTV,fe3mxr0,t1_fe0ilex,1578850801.0,"""Subverted expectations"""
PowerTV,fe3miqg,t1_fe0e343,1578850636.0,Well I cant say no worthwhile information.  That talk with paz and tasha definitely eludes that she knows who killed ghost or she did it herself. That and tommy has slipped town now.

BanPitBulls,fdors02,t3_emdwt1,1578611438.0,"Like any medium/large dog such as pitt, boxer, mastiff, doberman, lab, retriever, etc. Just continue training and always trust your sensesbjudgeing their mood. Ik they like deamonizeing pitts here but any dog can be aggressive trained or untrained under circumstances. It's the risk we all take they are animals at the end of the day. Though humans can be just as unpredictable."
BanPitBulls,fdoqwfw,t3_emg8n7,1578610879.0,Yall are truly idiots inhere if you really think pitts are the only breed that do this.
