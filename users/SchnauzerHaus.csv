diabetes_t2,ff6mys1,t1_ff6jz3o,1579630641.0,"Ditto. I probably started taking them 8 years ago, went from walking 45 minutes daily and a standing job to crippling pain in my legs, like something was squeezing my muscles. Finally quit them, and am ok, able to walk and exercise. Took a couple years for me to feel close to normal.

No thanks, never again."

schnauzers,feh32w0,t1_feglp4s,1579108129.0,"I'll say the difference between a vet expressing anals and me doing it is, the vet will put a finger inside your dog. I don't do that, that's *way* above my pay grade. Usually, if you lift a dog's tail up, and notice bulging where the sacs are, gentle pressure can relieve them. That's what I do. I'd rather not, but customers ask for it so...

It could be your dog has a chicken allergy. Are there any pet supply stores near you that sell small bags of food, or have sample bags? I see you said your schnauzer does better on fish, and best on cans. Yep, canned food is really expensive. I give mine a tablespoon or two of canned along with dry food. Nice poops! LOL

FWIW, I feed mine Canidae dry, all life stages. Not sure if it's available where you are. It's multiple protein food, have been feeding it to my various dogs for about, geez, 20 years now.

I think the suggestion for feeding on the bags are always too high. I'd have very fat, happy dogs if I did that LOL"
schnauzers,fegkdbb,t3_ep1u4y,1579095413.0,"Schnauzer owner and dog groomer here. Yes, I express anal sacs, not that I *want* to. My experience is, if your dog has a problem, they will always have a problem. I'm not sure it has to do with the firmness of the poo, but the ""squeezing"" off afterwards.

It is something to be concerned about, because the sacs can become impacted and infections can happen. 3-4 months isn't that frequently, I think. 

Just FYI, no judgement, but the FDA has been investigating grain free foods and the uptick in dogs heart issues. I did grain free for a year or so, got firmer poos, but then put them back on food with grain.

Got him when he was 2 1/2 years old, clipped him maybe twice, then started to see signs of grey in his black. Like you, did some research, and talked to a couple of schnauzer/breeders/groomer/handlers while they were working on their schnauzers at a dog show. 

They recommended this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6J9Crq5C60  for instruction, with the advice to let his coat grow out before trying it. 

So I am doing it! I let him get long, strip him, bath him, then run a long clipper blade over everything to smooth it out. Letting his furnishings and beard grow in. https://i.redd.it/jyl9zp0g47941.jpg

If it hurt him, or bothered him, I wouldn't do it. He doesn't care at all about it. Good luck if you try!

Bought this blue knife and the red one, both on Amazon.

That's a big red flag for me. All the info the application didn't include because they didn't ask:

Dog groomer. Work at home, and at home all day. Fenced in yard, and walked daily  (weather permitting.) Experienced schnauzer adopter, have adoptee #4 (not a schnauzer) and adoptee #5 (schnauzer) right now. (Dogs 8 & 9 in my home.)If they had called my vet, they might have found all of that out.

Typically, some dogs don't like their legs clipped, so groomers scissor them. Even if you ask for shorter fur on legs, it may be longer than the fur on body for that reason."
