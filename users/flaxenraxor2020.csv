It matters. Try to understand that we are now allowed to show how we love our children and put aside the generational bull, tell him you’re proud of him,how shitty you were and how you want to try to repair the damage. It honestly is better late than never and regretting it for the rest of your life. Good luck. First start with yourself though, the rest of the family hopefully will follow suit."
