AskReddit,ffbk00g,t3_eskc2n,1579768938.0,"Personally I've dated an ""overweight"" gamer and a ""normalish weight"" gamer and now I'm seeing a very fit casual gamer. I personally love games but I also really like being with someone who encourages me away from the keyboard and towards exercise with them. I love the outdoors so it's really nice to be encouraged to share that with someone, whereas I'm very prone to staying inactive too much which has knock ons to my mental health. With the first two men, they also had mental health issues which I suspect were also being exacerbated by being physically inactive and not going outside enough. 

Now, I've realised that a healthy balance is much more attractive than an extreme. I find the 'ideal' is someone who is clean and physically active in some way (group sports, hiking, cycling, swimming, etc, I don't care) but also enjoys settling down to play games separately but together for a few hours in the evenings."

Because either you travel and cause environmental damage, or you import, and cause environmental damage. So at the very base every item has a level of environmental impact, it's just a case of which is worse. So importing Scottish tartan into America for example is probably worse/same as using American made synthetics, because of the transport.

Fabrics,ff8gv51,t1_ff67s4b,1579677906.0,"I'm not a vegan, I'm pretty much pro animal product. But the main arguments against it are cruelty to animals, variable depending on the species (sheep have to be sheered for wool, but leather and fur are animal skin, angora rabbits are often plucked alive repeatedly, etc) so it's really variable which animal you pick Vs which farm Vs what your requirements are. 

Personally I would use any animal products from animals I'm already choosing to eat, but I wouldn't use Mink fur for example. Sheep wool depends on the country of origin. I've been on british farms and I'm comfortable with buying British wool, but I wouldn't know another other countries systems and what's considered acceptable practice elsewhere. There is the issue of animals producing Co2 and methane, but if they're already part of your diet and the material is a by product it's not an additional amount.

There's also the chemical processing to get leather and fur products, often with chemicals being dumped into rivers. But also there's also similar issues with chemicals to produce faux... 

There's the same issues with shipping around the world as any other material as well. Fossil fuels used for transport are one of the two largest producers of CO2 and methane- the other being power stations. So just using imported material is an eco nightmare."

adhdwomen,ff7cdg7,t3_erxplg,1579646265.0,"I calorie counted for a while and realised how filling veg was compared to how low calorie it is. So then I started adding more and more veg to meals. I love that feeling of being full, so now I have two large meals a day and have as much veg as I can physically eat, plus some protein and carbs and whatever sauce I need to make it all taste good. It's really helped change my relationship with food from consuming everything to at least I'm consuming a lot of healthy stuff with low effort because it tastes really good. And two large meals keeps me full longer so I snack less.

Also- just don't buy snacks. Maybe one individual thing per weekly shop but that's it, because self control is hard once sugar is in the house"

NatureIsFuckingLit,feoizmv,t1_fen0nq7,1579300816.0,"It's not a coincidence. It's that a random mutation made the moth look less like prey, so it was more likely to survive. Generations later another random mutation made it look even less like prey, and more likely to survive. They reproduce every year, so over tena/hundreds of thousands of years, every mutation adds up into weird and wonderful new forms, which become new species. And this form must be successful, otherwise previous generations would have never survived to reproduce and pass it on. 

Mimicry happens many times in the animal kingdom, although not normally quite this spectacularly. Often it's a harmless animal appearing like a harmful one for example by mimicking the colour/pattern of a venomous or poisonous species. They've never chosen to do that, it's just through random mutations and gene recombination, the offspring that looked more like something dangerous were less likely to get eaten, and so over time the selection pressure resulted in species looking very different."
