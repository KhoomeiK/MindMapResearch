Today her and her later adopted brother are both lying next to me as I type this. It does get easier! And the rewards and love are so worth it."

I have seen so many posts like this lately where a bride wants a bridesmaid (and I have seen some for groomsmen too) to change her hair/beard/etc.  Do not do this! She doesn’t get to say this.  What do your parents say?!

Edit- if she’s jealous of it, tell her you’ll wear it up/ in a bun or something, as someone else suggested.  I don’t think that is a terrible ask. But this would take years for you to get back.  And she doesn’t get to ask that of you.  No one does."

legaladvicecanada,fdogx27,t3_emb8tj,1578604914.0,"NAL - but you should consult a family lawyer.  You want to get supervised visits set up (this is all you would get to start with after your history), and start paying your back child support.  Once you have shown you are responsible and will keep doing everything you are supposed to, you can try to modify the custody (this would be after a good while of proving yourself, mind you) to get, say, unsupervised visits, working your way up to overnights.  Good luck."
