ADHD_partners,feye8rh,t3_eqvjw6,1579444283.0,"My husband's small victory this week was going to bed before midnight on a Friday. This man will not sleep. It's very difficult to get him away from his computer. I'm a gamer too so I get it's hard and even harder for him. Most nights he gets 4-5 hours sleep. I can't convince him to get more. He doesn't want to lose out on the time he could be doing stuff and doesn't want tomorrow to come yet. So I'm pretty excited that he actually went to bed at a decent time and slept 7-8 hours. 

A larger victory for him was not losing his temper and yelling when the kid acts like a little self important snot. Lol the kid is going through puberty and has been off the rails with yelling and slamming doors. Husband has had a hard time not yelling. This whole week he didn't yell at all. He didn't raise his voice. He kept control of his emotions and handled the kid's outbursts better than I could have in that moment. I am super proud of him. I'm going to make his favorite meal tonight and give him a nice leg massage. I say leg because he's on his feet most of the day at work. I love my husband very much and I'm glad he's here. I'm happy to celebrate his wins and console him on the defeats. I hope you all have a good weekend."
ADHD_partners,feyc5z8,t3_eqvjuf,1579443601.0,"A petty complaint. If I complain here I am less likely to bitch at him I guess. I obviously do 99% of the cleaning, which is fine. I have no issues cleaning. What makes me irritated is when he will go to our food shelves, take one of those store bought fruit pies that looks like hot Pocket/calzones. They flake and crumb everywhere. He stands in front of the shelves and eats the pie right there. I just got done cleaning up all the crumbs on the floor, which he also tracked into the hallway and the bits on the shelves. I know it just doesn't occur to him to eat it over the sink or the table or to get a goddamn paper plate, but it pisses me off. It feels like I'm being disrespected, but again, I know it's not intentional. Thank you for reading my rant. My closing statement is I love my husband and wouldn't trade him for the world. I hope you all have a good day and remember, a lot of our loved ones are trying hard and they need patience and kindness because change is hard. ‚ù§"

Video games and maybe reading? It seems to me my issue is that if I try, I can be interested in anything for a period of time. The I'm paralyzed by too many choices. I don't feel I'm good enough at anything I've ever tried to consider keeping it around or pursuing a career in it. It's left me feeling lost and in a position where friends and family are constantly trying to get me to do something. Like ""oh you play video games and you're smart, go to college be a programmer"" or ""your cookies are excellent and you not opening a bakery is a waste of your skill."" . I took up knitting and now the whole family expects me to pick up where my grandma left off and knit slippers for everyone. Turns out I didn't care for knitting after all but crocheting is nice. I'm struggling to finish projects. Parents bought me a sewing machine and now my brother expects me to fix his expensive pants and stuff when I haven't even used a sewing machine, ever.

He tries very hard to help me with anything that I have trouble doing in the house like moving furniture, taking boxes down in the basement etc. Yesterday I gave him a to do list because we had family coming over. It was a lot of things that needed to be done in a short period of time. HE DID EVERY SINGLE ONE WITHOUT REMINDERS. He was 100% successful. I am so pleased and proud. He was an intense help and I am thankful for him. I am so proud that he didn't get distracted or if he did, it wasn't for very long.

ADHD_partners,fe30dlb,t3_enmwhb,1578844753.0,"So here is one I haven't complained about before.  I'm big PC gamer and so is the hubby. We met on WoW ffs. Anyways, we play lots of co-op games. We're playing Conan Exiles and he keeps saying he wants to do stuff together. I'm out gathering a lot of the basic supplies while he goes off, explores, does risky stuff, dies, tries to retrieve body and dies. Sometimes I have to help him retrieve his body. So I'm at base making hardened brick and he goes off and does main quest storyline shit WITHOUT me. I'm so mad and I'm hurt. Why didn't he ask me to go? We're are supposed to do main storyline stuff together. I've waited to to do so much stuff with him and he's just gonna go off and do it himself?! Fuck you dude! He later asked if I was mad. I asked him if what he did was main quest related. He said yes. He then apologized and said he didn't think it's a big deal. I feel lied to since we literally agreed to not do this shit without the other one. I know he's impulsive but wtf? So right now I'm trying not to be petty about it. I'm incredibly tired of him agreeing to things and then supposedly temporarily forgetting about agreement, then him feeling bad he went back on agree while getting into my face saying ""well I make mistakes!"". Yeah, trust me dude, I know you make mistakes.

Just a little life tip here, if you play Minecraft or a survival game where you must father resources to make stuff or ""gear up"", be prepared to do ALL the work. You will be stuck planning everything, building everything, gathering resources, keeping track of supplies ... Oh wait, you mean just like every day Life?? YES."

ADHD_partners,fdfqalh,t3_el25fk,1578367631.0,"My husband has ADHD (diagnosed in childhood) with some side mental illnesses and I have mental illnesses too. It's been quite the struggle. We've been married 9 years. There were a few times I thought I was going to leave, but ultimately didn't. My husband does the best he can to create the routines, habits etc he needs. I had to change me, not him. I figured out that all the negativity was coming from me, not him. I had to change my expectations. Instead of lecturing him, I'm aiding him. I'm not here to teach him or raise him. I'm here as an equal. I'm here as a partner. I am a support and an aid, not a parent. I aid him the way I would a friend. I try to let go of the things I cannot control. He's got to meet me somewhere and he's late? I stay on time and keep doing the thing (whatever was planned). I will enjoy myself just fine until he does arrive. Frankly, I'm happy he arrives at all because so many bad things could happen to a person on the way like car crashes, shootings etc. He is his own person and he is an adult. Getting mad at him for struggling to perform to a ""normal"" standard is cruel. It's like him getting mad at me and threatening to leave me because I have anxiety. Ultimately if you can't accept that you will shoulder a bit more of the planning and time management forever, then you probably shouldn't stay together. You need to find compromises to maximize what he is good at and minimize (shoulder the load) what  he's bad at. This way he gets to feel better about himself and maybe won't be constantly nagged and you get the stuff you want done, everyone's happy. As far as anniversaries go, get over it. Why not plan something together instead of setting him up for failure by expecting him to remember and plan something himself? Why does it have to be a surprise? You are asking this human being to perform in ways he is not capable of at this point in time. If he isn't in some kind of therapy/whatever to assist in finding ways to cope with his ADHD already, he needs to work on that and see a Dr. If you're already emotionally checked out I doubt anything I say will make any difference. I wish you much luck and hope you figure out a plan of action and move forward in whatever way you need to."

BPD,fcu5cop,t3_eiua2c,1577972942.0,"I'm in a healthy relationship, I think. My husband is aware of my issues and has read some about them. He is patient and understands sometimes I say things that he has to just let go. He is able to separate ""me"" and my mental illnesses. He can tell when I'm having a hard time emotionally. He is amazing and I am lucky. I work very hard not to name call or to keep the argument going. I work extremely hard at being self aware. It took awhile before the hard work started to pay off. It's hard to change your way of thinking and to catch the shit that doesn't get filtered out properly. It's not impossible though. You just have to keep doing the right things. Take time to calm down and distract yourself instead of arguing. When you feel that rise of intense emotion gtfo and go read reddit. I actually read this subreddit for just that reason. It reminds me I am mentally ill, I'm not making it up and I do need to keep trying. If you fail? You keep trying again and again and again. You can't be afraid to admit being wrong. Just because we feel it, doesn't make it true. 

I want to relate something I just learned yesterday. I was having a nervous day (anxiety) and so was my husband (anxiety). My husband didn't interact with me very much. He kind of kept to himself, didn't play Conan Exiles with me like he said. He seemed restless. The whole fricken day I was selfish. I kept thinking 'Why isn't he helping me?"" or ""Why doesn't he want to play games with me?"" or ""He didn't touch me as he walked by. He's disgusted by me."" Of course as the day progressed it became ""He just doesn't want to put up with your shit. You're a stupid asshole to think he cares about you. Why would anyone want to interact with you? You ruin everything just like you ruined your marriage... "" etc etc. I didn't communicate. I was selfish. I was looking within. What I SHOULD have been doing was thinking about my husband. He had a bad day too. He could have used some comfort. Maybe he was too nervous to ask. Why should he have to ask all the time? Why was I so dependent on him comforting me? Then I realized I'd fucked up. I let that stupid nasty voice take control. I only thought about my comfort instead of his. The reality is I could have made us BOTH feel better by reaching out to him, suggesting and activity, proding him a little or simply hugging him. Helping him would have helped me. Instead of seeing what he wasn't doing, I could have paid attention to what I was doing instead. Sorry if this was a ramble. I'm a little fuzzy headed today. If nothing else I've said makes sense then just read this: stay the course. If you are improving, then that's progress. That's good. You can't change over night and it's a long long process. Please take care of yourself. Don't crucify yourself, it doesn't help. Just keep doing what you're doing. <3"
