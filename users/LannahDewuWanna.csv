Inability to keep breast milk and most formula down, severe reflux, rawness from reflux,  watery diarrhea,  slight jaundice.  It was a horrible ordeal but he's 10 years old now and no lingering effects of anything from the early months thankfully.  Good luck to you and your family.  Keep us posted please"

OCD,ff8cxmb,t3_es0t37,1579673357.0,I've not gotten up the courage to post on Reddit yet and when I comment and get downvoted ( most I ever got was 7 downvotes for calling a bug nightmare fuel on a What's this insect subreddit) I feel devastated and embarrassed.  I feel equally lousy when I post a positive/ helpful comment on a subject and get zero or like 1 upvote. I mean sometimes I really open up and share to try helping and my comments lack of upvotes makes me feel embarrassed ( yet again). I tend to get long winded and am working on that but I refrain from commenting quite often because...lack of confidence.

relationships,ff86dnj,t3_es1z1p,1579667262.0,I just think all ties should be cut with this other couple.  If you're interested in starting over with your wife ( I mean really) then the friendship with this other woman isn't more important than working things out with your wife. The affair and these people should remain in your past. If you're interested in revenge ( or in the possiblity of finding out that your new female friend has revenge on her mind now or later) staying friends with her is one way to find out. Im sorry to say but your new friend will always dislike your wife and you'll always dislike her husband. Is there anything positive to come of being friends with someone who obviously has hard feelings for your S.O?

At age 11 my son got a psychological evaluation from an awesome Dr who had tattoos and skateboards in the office.  Some decks were on the wall but he kept 3 in the room that could be utilized as footrests or ottomans.  Lol. No riding but sitting in a comfy chair being allowed to all fidget our legs and feet while talking was a real ice breaker and perfect for a family full of attention deficit disorders.  Lol"

AmItheAsshole,ff79dv8,t3_ervv4n,1579643788.0,"NTA..My stepdaughter did the same to and then some from when she was 11 until 20. Ignored the children I had with my husband even though she was mid 20s when we had them. My husband held a torch for the shred of decency that she may have once had ..ever. We gave her another chance in her late 20s by way of giving her money for her wedding and downpayment on her house. All of a sudden she was semi cordial.  My husband was as happy as a pig in shit. Fast forward 6 years she has 2 daughter's under 5 who's birth we found out about on Facebook. Has never once invited us to her home, cut ties with us and our son's and doesn't have her children acknowledge my husband as grandfather.  They actually met him twice when he went to church to observe their baptisms and got to see them in passing because his daughter wouldn't be the true phoney she is and shun him in front of her in laws.  The in-laws are supposed to believe he's been the bad guy her entire life."

AskReddit,ff5dud2,t3_ero8mj,1579588710.0,Shocked and amazed that I survived the deaths of my parents and grandparents without dying of a broken heart myself.  From about the age of 8 until about 16 I became obsessed and terrified at the thought of anyone I knew and loved dying and thought I couldn't survive without my parents.  I lost them when I was in my early and late 30s and while the heartbreak and loss was excruciating (and still is at times). I survived and have kept their legacy alive for my own children and nieces and nephews.

therapy,fdpu2v5,t3_emmz2t,1578640516.0,"I used to be very social as well until about 7 years ago when my mild depression became severe and was accompanied by unexpected anxiety/panic disorder that rendered me agoraphobic for about 8 months. After cognitive behavioral therapy and trial and error with different medications my agoraphobia was under control,  next panic disorder was manageable to the point of feeling ""able to function"" outside of home again. The depression has never gone away fully. At best I've found the right medications and saw light at the end of the tunnel but wasn't able to be in therapy for the past 5 years and still have ups and downs with the depression. I'm more social than when I first got blindsided with depression and such but nowhere near the way I was prior to all my mental health issues. Still, I have been able to make a couple of friends in recent years ( I lost old friends due to isolating myself for years). I think with therapy I can do better and move forward more. Looking into starting again soon. Cognitive behavioral therapy helped me a lot. If you're not familiar look it up. Helped me learn to stop thinking certain negative, self sabotaging thoughts etc. My opinion on your situation is that you very recently had a break down and it sounds like you've made some pretty good progress already by being back in university and having the desire to socialize more.
The fact that it's not something you're acting on or comfortable with yet is probably just because you need a little more time to ease into socializing and making friends just yet. Taking small steps forward is fine right now.  You just went through a difficult time fairly recently. Give yourself some more time to really heal and get more confidence back. No rush. Be polite and cordial to people who seem nice or interesting to you but take things slow right now. Work on yourself and maybe get some therapy if you're not doing so already. Group or individual therapy are options. Group therapy can help with feeling more social again. Explore your options and honestly give yourself credit for the progress you've made so far. Don't push yourself just yet. You'll start feeling better and more comfortable with being social at your own pace.  Don't sweat it yet and don't compare yourself now to yourself before your breakdown. Things are different right now but that's ok. You'll get back to where you were socially or maybe find a new normal that's a bit different from the past you but works for you now. Your interest in people and making new friends is hugely positive.  I had no interest in making friends or being social for a few years( while I struggled with depression and anxiety). But in the past 2 years I made two new , quality friends without even thinking about it and even have a couple of quality acquaintances who I think will become good friends as well.  Good luck to you."
Parenting,fdpmquv,t3_emjfve,1578633046.0,"I'm with you. Late night has been ""me"" time since my boys were on a regular(ish) sleep schedule and I was able to stay awake once they went to bed. That probably started when they were about 3 and 6 years old and I'm still doing the late night thing now that they're 10 and 13 years old. Not every night of the week but at least a few nights. They're more self sufficient now but there's still something about being awake alone after they and my husband are asleep that feels like relaxing and productive to me at the same time."

Either they would claim to be out of Adderal, or claim that Adderal was on back order and sometimes they'd even say I was too early for my next script when I absolutely wasn't.

adderall,fcpc61m,t3_ei8xd4,1577857884.0,"I can relate to so much of what you wrote about here. I'm a disaster when I stay off Adderall for more than 2-3 days. I oversleep, over eat ( and lots of carbs and sugar. Ugh). My laziness and lack of motivation undo most anything good I accomplished on Adderall ( work, house cleaning, keeping appointments, socializing and more). Then Ifall into some kind of weird swamp where I am not even really motivated to take my adderal once I get in such a down head from not taking Adderall for a few days. Then when I do go back body my prescribed dose I spend the first day or so feeling guilty and melancholy about what a waste I am without my medication. Adderall breaks of more than 3 days suck for me. Need to stick to the occasional weekend off here and there for tolerance and because sometimes a day or two or relaxing is good for the soul."

When they were about 4 and 7 we started a ""time capsule"" tradition. We'd take a small box and put little things in it that represented life over the past year. Maybe a Pokemon card , a small toy, drawings or a short written story about the year that was ending. Some years we'd write notes to our future self.  Then we'd write the year on the box and decorate it a bit and off the box would go into it's safe place ( a storage trunk in the basement)  to be opened the following New Year's Eve and so on.
