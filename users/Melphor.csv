FundieSnark,ff48eur,t3_erki9o,1579557789.0,"This guy probably veers too far from “Fundie Snark” to “Straight-Up-Evil”, but I figured I would post this here nonetheless. 

I hadn’t heard of this guy until yesterday. Unfortunately despite being like 90 damn years old he is still alive and preaching whatever version of the “gospel” he has concocted.

Here are links to everything I have come across on the guy. It’s crazy. One of the women in his congregation went crazy and butchered her own child. He also drove a woman and her husband into hiding because he insisted for years that he was married to her.

swdestiny,ff40sx4,t1_ff3askr,1579553065.0,"I actually don't think that Baby Yoda is inherently too strong. Maybe there is some card combo that I am unaware of that exploits him, but the restriction of activating once per game I think balances him out. Although, every time I see someone post a custom Baby Yoda card I think ""that just needs to be a support and not a character.""

&#x200B;

I do think that Mando is too strong though. I think his die is generally fine, but being able to activate for 3 shields is very, very strong. Remove the line about gaining Ambush and reduce his health a bit, and I think he would be fine."
swdestiny,ff3ytiv,t1_ff3cry1,1579551827.0,Why on earth did your comment get downvoted? Is the Destiny community as pedantic and butt hurt as the MTG community?

memes,feo2gox,t1_feo0gtn,1579294194.0,"I find that it’s more entertaining to fuck around with angry dudes like you. No rational argument will convince you that there is a sexist double standard against Cardi B.

Sure she did some bad shit, but unlike her male contemporaries she didn’t make a career of glamorizing and glorifying the bad shit she did to turn a profit. Rather, she used her sexuality to compliment genuinely catchy music that appealed to the masses. Especially lonely dudes like yourself who - if they were honest - would gladly let Cardi B slip them a Bill Cosby or 2 if it meant they would finally have a female look at them naked without laughing. 

I’m glad you like her music. I do too. Now enjoy it without making or sharing mean spirited memes about her. You don’t have to like her as a person. Damn dude, Phil Spector straight up murdered someone and I still listen to The Beach Boys. 

I’m just saying that people are complicated you know. She had a rough life growing up and had to do what she could to survive. I’m sure looking back she isn’t proud of what she did. We all do regretful shit. 

Hey wait a minute... You got me to start providing you with a substantive argument. I see what you did there. Clever girl...

Edit: that last line was a Jurassic Park reference. Remember Sam Jackson in that movie? He got ate by a dinosaur!"

memes,fenwa6m,t1_fenven8,1579291774.0,"I don't believe you bro. I think you just don't like her because she is a successful female rapper. Now please understand that I am not defending her. Rather, I am simply being critical of YOU and your fake outrage."

swdestiny,fehqdjn,t1_fehiewa,1579121784.0,"That happened because the Player's Committee kept the game alive by issuing erratas to cards and releasing entirely new Virtual Sets that you could print and play, and they are still going strong. The game will definitely crash for the next few years, but if the community remains then the value will remain with the cards and prices will creep back up."
