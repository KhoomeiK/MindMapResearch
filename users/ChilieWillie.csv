CryptoCurrencies,fendnbw,t3_eq3gpl,1579282442.0,What do you think about Privacy coins? Such is RYO (Ryocurrency) do they face problems like securities laws?

CryptoTechnology,fek383g,t3_ep6g3l,1579191661.0,I think you need to focus on the the things that can be changed after Crypto adoptaion. I think this will be good for people who don't know crypto well or have any missunderstanding about it.
hardware,fej6unr,t3_ep8yx0,1579159333.0,Great and so much informative post. Thanks for the effort..!!
CryptoCurrencies,feghm12,t3_eorcfv,1579093024.0,"I think it is a real problem that can only solve through Atomic swaps, Ryocurrency has it in its [roadmap](https://ryo-currency.com/#roadmap). What do you think Atomic swaps are better than Centralized exchanges or not?"

Thanks in Advance."
CryptoTechnology,fdmwdjr,t1_fckusxs,1578568871.0,Lack of trust is building because of people's lack of knowledge and understanding. Projects that have real-life usage features not matter if they are small like Ryocurrency or big Like Bitcoin are worth to look because they are going to solve the real financial issues. I hope with passage of time people will understand the importance of quality.
altcoinmining,fdmw3zd,t3_eiwrza,1578568540.0,"It is really nice and well written article. What about publishing an article on the best coins to mine with GPU's? I'm Currently mining RYO with my Nvidia 1080's, but if you can publish a report on the best coins to mine with GPUs in 2020 it will be good for other people to understand the facts about any project before actually starts mining it."
