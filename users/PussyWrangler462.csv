If either of them aren’t fixed, that can help drastically especially if one is a male. Sometimes it can take a couple months for cats to tolerate each other much less be friends 

It sounds like the original kitty is just pissed about no longer being in a one cat household and may be holding a grudge. Make sure there are two different litter boxes, water dishes, food bowls etc so they don’t have to go near each other, that will help as well

Do you listen to yourself? Don’t try to act like it’s going to be rich kids vs poor kids, this is just about people in general, doesn’t matter how much money their parents have. I don’t know what country you come from but instead of education debt let’s pretend it’s medical debt 

Do you seriously think, that because people in the past were forced to go bankrupt just to have a life saving operation, or die because they couldn’t afford it at all, that we shouldn’t provide free medical care to people now and *in the future*?

REGARDLESS of who is currently suffering and how, we should not stop evolving our society to do what’s BEST for people. And just because YOU are pissy that you worked to clear away school debt when others may not have to, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t start providing education for free. I’m getting the feeling that you would also think kids in kindergarten shouldn’t get to go there for free and that they should have to go into debt to learn basic shit like how to read and write just because in the past that’s what happened 

There was a time when only the rich could school their kids but because we evolved as a society, more and more levels of income are now able to access education and information, and we have some great minds as a result of that.

Essentially, what you’re saying, is because YOU had to pay, everyone else should too and that you don’t want to change that simply because you’re a scorned grumpy old man who thinks everyone should have it as bad as he had it.

If you’re not going to help leave the world a better place than when you were in it, then you’re an ass, that pretty much sums it up. Now me writing all this was likely pointless because it’s obvious you’re not going to suddenly see the light and how good it is to help others despite *your* hardships, so I’m also going to turn notifications off, because there’s no point in trying to debate with someone who has already made up their mind.
