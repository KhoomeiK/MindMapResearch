Barrel hits the ground and empties out. The guy still holding the rope goes down - barrel hits him as he goes by .... he hits the ground. Hurt. Let’s go if rope. Barrel falls on him."

UpliftingNews,ff78p5n,t1_ff74qez,1579643323.0,"If you are willing to bear the responsibility - I have no problem. And it’s not only legal responsibility. If you think you can live with the fact that you kept a gun locked up and the neighbor kid came in with a soldering iron and got into the safe and then went home and shot his baby sister.  You have no legal liability but the guilt you’d feel might be devastating. That’s all built in to owning a gun. Legal or not you are risking a hell of a lot. Yes you can all yell it’s my right but can you live with the worse case scenario. If my car was stolen and killed someone - I’d feel bad but we all  need a car to live. 

If my locked up gun was stolen and killed someone - fuck. I think most people would be devastated. “I just had it because I like it and have some abstract argument that it’s my “god given” right and I live in a constant fear of a home invasion or the Federal government coming to make me a slave.” No one would blame you and you wouldn’t be responsible but you know that in the back of your mind and the neighbors minds would be the thought - why did you even have to have one?"
UpliftingNews,ff776yj,t1_ff76o1c,1579642474.0,Because they’re not weapons! Jesus Christ! By law are you required to keep a car in a safe? Or to even keep it locked. Yes or no?
UpliftingNews,ff75lzo,t1_ff714dg,1579641585.0,"Show me your source where cars are statistically more dangerous - Wikipedia gun deaths in the US. In 2017 = 39,973. Each day 109 dead. 23,854 suicides.  And the total has been increasing since 1999. Car deaths = 40,231. The number of deaths and rate per 100k has been decreasing since 1999. That’s statistically pretty even. Interestingly car related deaths are called accidents. Not murders or suicides."
UpliftingNews,ff73791,t1_ff714dg,1579640213.0,I think I’ve made it clear what I believe - if you own a weapon ( again for the third time a car is a mode of transportation not made to be a weapon) you have a heightened responsibility. I gave a bit to be reasonable but who brought the weapon into “the market”? The purchaser. All things being equal he introduced a deadly weapon where none existed. He locked it in a safe. His kids or wife or someone finds the key or combo. And uses it. He’s negligent.
UpliftingNews,ff6ydtc,t1_ff6x1w6,1579637432.0,"Is a car designed solely to inflict physical damage to an object or living thing? Does a car by law have to be locked  in a safe? If not, why not? Because its primary purpose is not to be a weapon. You’re not using logic. You’re looking for a fairy world where you can do whatever you want and not be held accountable. You own a weapon. You have heightened responsibility and liability because - if it is determined that you were negligent ( somewhat modifying my stance  - but not too much) your negligence can lead to multiple victims."
UpliftingNews,ff6wfw6,t1_ff6sa9y,1579636289.0,"My brother is on anti-depressants and still owns multiple guns, is a proud racist and a right winger anti- government nut and is surviving only because he was allowed to pay up after years of not paying taxes to get the bare minimum on social security which he had denounced all his life, and he did nothing to help when both my parents got sick at the same time and died.....so I tend to blame everything on gun owners! Actually my original post was badly edited ( I’m at work ) my point was increases in gun ownership is directly linked to rise in suicides. ( the brother part is true my blaming gun owners because of it was a joke)"
UpliftingNews,ff6vmt1,t1_ff6ngtx,1579635808.0,Yeah after I posted that I read where most gun suicides - no psyche problems had been detected.  Which actually I suppose strengthens the argument of tougher gun laws because it shows anyone can snap. And I think gun advocates always have said we need improved mental health care - well if psyche tests don’t work - what to do?
UpliftingNews,ff6v2ok,t1_ff6ovqc,1579635485.0,"Depending on the level of negligence found. Yes. If a train goes by and a vending machine falls and kills someone. Should the owner of the building be liable, the installer be liable or the vending machine company be liable. That gun would have not been in the area if the owner didn’t buy it.  

There are differing levels of liability and owning a gun should require a heightened level of responsibility and therefore - at least some - liability."
UpliftingNews,ff6u0sn,t1_ff6ovqc,1579634863.0,By definition a responsible gun owner guards their weapon. I think because it is designed solely to inflict physical damage to an object or living thing it entails heightened levels of liability.  I’d be willing to negotiate that but that’s how I feel and if someone let their gun be stolen and someone you know was killed by it ..... you’d want to make absolutely sure that that owner had done every single thing they could’ve done to safeguard that weapon.
UpliftingNews,ff6tfc0,t1_ff6sjrk,1579634513.0,You assumed the heightened responsibility of owning an object solely designed to inflict physical damage - not a car designed for transportation. You say you’re responsible gun owner. That is part of being responsible. Its is a priority to guard that gun and letting it be stolen is negligence in my book.

UpliftingNews,ff6lte4,t3_ervw8g,1579629941.0,"I’m liberal since 2016 but don’t have any real problem with gun ownership - we have far larger problems. But - aside from giving everyone a gun once they can walk - what are proven ideas to cut the number of deaths - particularly mass shootings and youth suicide up 30% since 1999. 

I don’t think there are any ways to prevent mass shootings other than psych tests for gun owners And everyone in the house.  And a good guy with a gun can help but 9/10 times they’re caught by surprise too. And frankly suicide  in gun owning homes? Too bad. You decided to have a weapon in the house.  You should have considered the risk. 

One last thing - if your gun is stolen - it should be 6+ months in jail and a hefty fine.

Edit: youth suicide rate is overall not just gun owning homes."
