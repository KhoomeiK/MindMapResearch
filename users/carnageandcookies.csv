I can't even imagine my excitement of this ever works, I've done it to every truck since I was a kid and it hasn't worked since I was maybe 12-13. I just want them to think damn it."

Needafriend,fdfz4qp,t1_fdfyxaj,1578374353.0,"No. That's shitty. I've been cheated on and it's the worst feeling to wonder why you're not good enough for someone. If you're unhappy, she probably is too. Talk to her, maybe you can fuck other people together. But don't break her spirit like that."

AskReddit,fc7nxe0,t1_fc6sa2q,1577513837.0,"When bartending I had customers who would come in when they knew it would be empty (opening mostly) and would confess to me like I was fatherly AF and they were at confession... I was a 20 something tattooed princess working in a metal bar. I got to hear about weird kinks, and do some pretty weird shit for money (there was no ""sex"" but some weird stuff they got off on) I was once paid $100 to punch a dude in the face and then tipped another $50 because ""that did it for him"" another guy paid me $300 to step on his face and tell him how much his manhood was lacking, and a regular wanted my empty x-rated bottles, but only if I personally drank the last sip from the bottle directly, and he paid handsomely for them. Humans are fucking weird."
