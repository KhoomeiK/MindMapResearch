AskReddit,fcuaedp,t3_eiq8xs,1577976363.0,"First one, my mom told me this:
When I was still in her womb, my parents lived on an island in the Philippines. Since we live in the Philippines, elders took superstitions VERY seriously.

One night, my parents were both asleep when they heard scratching on the roof. Both jolted awake. So my father went outside to investigate. Nothing. He shone the flashlight left and right and up and down. Nothing. The place they were living in was under some trees so they assumed it was a fruit or something.

The next day, my mother had a chat with other women near the village. When the late night topic came out, the ladies (elders) were quick to suggest monsters. Maria Labo, manananggal, tikbalang, elves. Technically almost every single monster they could think of. They said that they prey on baby fetuses so that when it comes out the child is dead. I wonder what it really was.

Second one, my take:
So, fast forward six years and I now live in another village. This one was nearer to the city.

The house we lived in was nearby a church. The church had an organ (hammond) as the instrument. We went there on days of church came. 

One night, I woke up to a very loud but familiar sound. Listening a little more, I recognized the sound. The organ was playing. The music was so serene...so emotional. But I looked at my clock there and saw the time. 2:45 AM. The Service didn't start until 6 AM. As a child, I was too afraid to go and see who or what was playing the organ. I told my parents the next day and they seemed to be bothered as much as I am. To this day, we don't know the real truth behind it all.

Third. A friend's take:
My friend lived and lives in Legazpi. He once said that when they were kids, they used to play near an abandoned building. The building was still... new when put into context but no one lived in it. Outside the building was a tree. A mango tree. But along the branches was Balete, a known plant to hold curses or be haunted. When they played near the building one night, they saw a figure hanging from the tree. Hanging. HANGING. AS IN ROPE AROUND NECK. It was a woman. Maybe no more than 18 or 20. They rushed to tell their parents but nothing was there when they came back. They never played near there again."
