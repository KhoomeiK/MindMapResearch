ECE,fe6kafo,t1_fe6j56q,1578893683.0,"VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration. Almost any modern integrated circuit is designed this way and consists of millions of transistors. The actual FPGAs are designed using VLSI by their manufacturers, but end users of FPGAs design for an application, typically using VHDL or Verilog languages. This design is then compiled for a specific FPGA, requiring proprietary software.

Few people who work with VLSI will ever design an FPGA. Most people that do VLSI design are instead making ASICs for a specific purpose. VLSI design usually means you are doing a physical design of a chip. This means you need to design birth the physical layout and connectivity."

FPGA,fdox8bl,t3_emhnrb,1578614951.0,"High level view. 

An FPGA already has all of it's hardware designed and exists a complete piece of circuitry. The designer just determines what parts to use and how to connect all those internal parts to each other. The design uses the resources that already exist to perform a function. Almost never will every single resource of an FPGA be used in a design.

An ASIC design needs to be **physically** designed from scratch. Granted there are probably ""known"" designs that will be used if they're the most tried and true way to perform a task, but each entire new chip design is necessarily unique. An ASIC is designed to fulfill a specific need, and the entire design process is driven by that. Unlike an FPGA, there should be little to no waste in terms of resources."
