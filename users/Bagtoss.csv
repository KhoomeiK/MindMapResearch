I Honestly understand where you’re at, I have autism and I honestly starting having doubts about even having five friends, let alone one, I’m still dealing with it life and things are moving slowly here for me right now, I’ve thought about cutting but decided to just play rpg’s or (RolePlayingGames) because of the state I was in and needing something to escape life, I’m starting to reach out to people right now, still worry here so I understand how your feeling cause I’ve been though two years of getting up every morning and regretting even being alive, I’m still worried about going back to my old ways but I’m just pushing for my life to get better. Wanting to give you advice on some bits and pieces that I can give out to help you. First thing of advice to give out is to just bite the bullet and push, I know it may be hard but I understand how social anxiety can really screw you up, So if that is really hard for you right now, I’ve got other pieces of advice that may help. Another piece of advice is to make you’re self a better version of you and what I mean is to take out things, that to you are personally traits you rather not have to keep and get help for your social skills so you can keep improving as a person, I’m not that person who says, (be yourself or you’re perfect as you are), cause that just stupid, Most people who are saying that are just trying to make you feel better about yourself, If you really want to, it’s you’re choice and it’s not my place to step in. Another thing is to get help with whatever issues that are causing pain mentality, I go to your parents or someone who you can trust without really any doubts, Cause getting help with social anxiety can help with being able to talk to people much more without feeling a sense of dread or panicking at the sight of another human being looking at you, It’s a step that could help with your life and allow you to not feel helpless because of you’re disability and or mental health issue, I feel that it would be the right direction for you to go into, I would ask your parents or if your an adult, You should see about getting help for your self, (Depending on where you live in the world, it may cost you to get help, so you should try to find something like a government funding plan to allow you to get the help you need). I hope none of this hurt you, I just want to let you know that it’s hard and I fully understand where you are at in life, it maybe years or maybe months but nothing really lasts forever, things change for the good or the worse, I hope this helps out so you can at least have something there in life to come to. If you need anything, dm me if you want, I will help with anything I can."
