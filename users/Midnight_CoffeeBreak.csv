me_irl,fdzx3w8,t1_fdylryh,1578797918.0,"But like, why they have to be mean. There has to be a reason or an explanation."
me_irl,fdx8gah,t3_en9pvy,1578766350.0,Makess me wonder why they do that?
me_irl,fdwwnvy,t1_fdw9v9w,1578763031.0,story time
me_irl,fdwpg6c,t3_en4bg1,1578761105.0,Wow I never thought I'd see this template here hahaha!
wholesomeanimemes,fdwmqzu,t1_fduwiw4,1578760284.0,"Haha man this is exactly my thought proccess: ""Oh look its cute"" , ""god I wish that were me"" , ""no no I'm too ugly and unsocial it will never happen"", and then it evolves into: ""damn I'm so ugly the other person would be scared already"", ""oh sh\*t it will never happen I'm sure"", ""maybe if I die I'll go to an isekai or something"""
wholesomeanimemes,fdwmbmt,t1_fduwg4i,1578760174.0,"I mean the first half seemed hopefull, but then the ""get off reddit and godo something"" part"
2meirl4meirl,fdwllrz,t1_fdv2wfu,1578759920.0,"You know, after being attacked so much it starts to get funny"
2meirl4meirl,fdwlixi,t1_fduqn2x,1578759892.0,I think his point is that even if he did it no one would believe
socialanxiety,fdwi9iy,t1_fdv9lzl,1578758907.0,I like how life is like Dark Souls. After you defeat a boss you think you're a baddass but theres a lot of bosses just waiting and they'll be even harder than the first one. Why do we need to do this?
socialanxiety,fdwh6l7,t3_en5361,1578758646.0,"Me when I literally do anything adult. Like seriously, even leaving my house to do something already makes me feel kind like this."
wholesomeanimemes,fdny4k0,t1_fdmrrgn,1578595212.0,I saw a :) so heres a :D. I hope your day is even better

socialanxiety,fdm1ybn,t1_fdm13uo,1578537880.0,"I guess I could try that. Thanks, really."
socialanxiety,fdm0uem,t1_fdm0k5y,1578537130.0,I'm not sure. Right now I'm not capable of even approaching them to be fair.
socialanxiety,fdlzty6,t1_fdlzptm,1578536445.0,I guess you're right.
socialanxiety,fdlzosr,t1_fdlz4i0,1578536346.0,Yeah thats right. However pushing through that is sometimes hard.
socialanxiety,fdlzlf4,t1_fdlxwu3,1578536279.0,I didn't even got messages haha...
socialanxiety,fdluyf6,t1_fdl1pz9,1578533101.0,Its kinda sad how society got to a point where some people just want random shallow relationships or sex or something like that.
socialanxiety,fdlt8xw,t1_fdldda2,1578531951.0,"I don't know about OP. But this ""selling yourself"" thing always only makes me think of how many better guys probably did the same and went way better."
socialanxiety,fdlsx9x,t1_fdlqerh,1578531731.0,"But what if they do feel weird about it and think he, I or you are creeps? Because thats the thing to me. I don't wanna be the guys who randomly do these things, that prob bother them."
socialanxiety,fdls79b,t3_em1qd6,1578531239.0,one thing I learned. This world was not made for us it seems. Everything is social and social and social and if youre not part of it they jsut want you gone.
socialanxiety,fdls1t9,t1_fdlrwg6,1578531138.0,Oh how society has degraded
socialanxiety,fdlryid,t1_fdl1yqj,1578531075.0,Last time I tried it only lasted a day.
wholesomeanimemes,fddwqlf,t1_fddwj84,1578325852.0,"Ah I don't use instagram and snapchat, I'm not much into those kind of social media."
wholesomeanimemes,fddvx1d,t1_fddvoce,1578325286.0,Definitely haha.
wholesomeanimemes,fddvpm9,t1_fddvhpz,1578325142.0,I watch it sub. I'm not sure about my favorite character because I like so many of them :D.
wholesomeanimemes,fddvim8,t1_fddvfqd,1578325007.0,"But still he's so funny. Like that ep where they're showing their rooms and the girls decide to not go into his because he's like ""Come here and I'll show something interesting..."" hahahaha poor boy."
wholesomeanimemes,fddv8pb,t1_fddv3e1,1578324812.0,I feel like none of boku no hero's characters are bad. In fact they're all very unique in many ways.
wholesomeanimemes,fdduvf8,t1_fddumzl,1578324554.0,Haha... Bakugo is actually one of my fav characters of boku no hero. I love how he just gets angry and do stuff based on that haha...
wholesomeanimemes,fddu5k1,t1_fddu2ix,1578324048.0,Haha funny thing is that I just watched that fight.

socialanxiety,fd6zclc,t1_fd6xrhs,1578197586.0,"Yeah this happens to me as well. People start acting as if I was different, it feels bad."
socialanxiety,fd0fcqv,t3_ejn928,1578118002.0,"Hello. I've been through something similar since I started college this year. I ended up not talking much to people due to my anxiety and in consequence, I ended up becoming the ""weird quiet one"". It really does feel pointless and its like if nobody cares. 

I don't have any advice to offer but all I can say is you're not alone. I hope someone can help."
socialanxiety,fd0ewu0,t3_ejrmv1,1578117831.0,I'm also like this. I end up feeling as if I'm always the weird one.
socialanxiety,fd0eexx,t3_ejqyu8,1578117641.0,"For me the worst part is that after many years of this, my brain kind off rewired itself  from envy of not being able to talk. So I end up getting angry when someone likes the same stuff I do. I don't really know why and it makes me feel like I'm crazy or something."
socialanxiety,fcb8nrm,t3_egspp0,1577583804.0,"I don't understand why people always go for the classic: doesnt talk -> hates everyone.

&#x200B;

Why they always think I hate them just because I don't say anything."
me_irl,fcb8a8m,t3_egqx5u,1577583660.0,I'm a CE student and I can confirm this
anime,fcalida,t3_egx4fs,1577571603.0,I remeber somethinf like Yami Shibai but the name is probably wrong. But it was more or less what you described. Gonna look into it later and edit this if I find it.
wholesomeanimemes,fc6od2i,t3_eggh96,1577485397.0,but I'm ugly ;-;
me_irl,fc6ngzq,t1_fc6bxyy,1577484767.0,"""Hey cool I'm dead"""
wholesomeanimemes,fc6ndrr,t3_egc4ye,1577484705.0,My uglyness is too strong to be beaten by this kind of spell.
2meirl4meirl,fc6ms98,t1_fc5g7nj,1577484283.0,Right? That was my first thought when I saw it.
socialanxiety,fc6mnev,t1_fc5yb9w,1577484187.0,And that feeling you get when you know they're ignoring you... Ahhh it just reminds me of the past and how people looked at me.
socialanxiety,fc6m0ak,t3_egherd,1577483743.0,I also feel like this sometimes when I see them having fun too. Which makes me think they only keep being my friends out of pity.
socialanxiety,fc4mor6,t3_efqrd2,1577421249.0,"So, whats the book's name?"
socialanxiety,fc4m48d,t3_efs9ja,1577420741.0,Thats so cute.
socialanxiety,fc4lemm,t3_eg4cre,1577420114.0,"I also have abit of this... I avoid looking to people, mostly from the opposite sex, because I'm afraid that they will feel bad because ugly me is looking at them. Due to this, I feel like I make them end up thinking I dislike them."
socialanxiety,fbfib2r,t3_ecsxzw,1576811278.0,"These are the worst moments. When you see or at least get slightly hopeful that someone is starting to like you or is at least a tiny bit interested, but then get too anxious or simply end up doing nothing about it, then seeing them slowly going away and losing interest.

Happened before, happens now, and probably, unhappily, will happen again. ""For its the fate of the cursed"""
