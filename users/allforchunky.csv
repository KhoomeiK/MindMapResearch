I’ve met some amazing people along my way of searching for him, but this is the absolute worst feeling I’ve ever had. I’m just at a low point and praying for a miracle now."
mentalhealth,fej79n1,t1_fej7413,1579159857.0,"Oh good. Me too.

It sucks because I realized all the closest people around me don’t feel the same.
People told me he was dead since day 1, and even the first search dog crew I got out here..

I would go to the ends of the earth for this cat. I just wish I knew which way he went"
mentalhealth,fej6ur0,t1_fej56ph,1579159336.0,"Yeah it cuts deep.. I know it’s lame but I’ve never felt this type of pain before and am crying like a baby when I realize I’m unable to control the situation like Usual.

Thank you!! I’ve been obsessively scouring the internet on tips and tricks.
I thought we had progress on my cat, but turns out it was a look alike I was trying to trap. Black and white wildlife cameras only show features - not colors

So I need to start from square one again . I’ll read these and craft a search strategy again"
mentalhealth,fej316c,t1_fej2ue6,1579155015.0,"That’s amazing you found the owner!!

I’m not giving up, just hit this road block in the search and it’s started to really affect me. I feel so stagnant as we have snow now and cats are most likely to hide during the cold. 

I thought i was inches from him, and now I’m months away. 

the apartment complex is being less helpful and now taking my signs down, and my best friends have been absent for 9/10 weeks he’s been gone.

I hope I find him soon, or that a nice 90 year old lady has him just hasn’t seen the signs. I’ve posted on fb and frequent the shelter sites."
mentalhealth,fej2ost,t1_fej2asy,1579154662.0,"I appreciate the honesty. He’s incredibly shy and I have started to post signs again to gain exposure just in case someone has him. 

I’m not giving up it just sucks and it’s been taking a toll on me. 

I’m sorry about your dog. It’s so devastating to lose a pet, and I’m sure they had a great life with you considering how you mourned for them."
mentalhealth,fej1zws,t3_epf543,1579153983.0,"I’ve hired expensive search dogs, have a cat lady consultant, etc because I can’t handle it alone.

My friends and family have been neutral / not supportive so I’m alone in the search for my best friend"
cats,fej06z5,t3_epbq87,1579152277.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss.. that’s heartbreaking.
But sounds like she was completely loved for all her life, and is really lucky to have you as a human companion. ❤️"
aww,feiziua,t3_ep3h5q,1579151677.0,So cute!! Glad this kitty can sleep knowing it’s ok and has a home
cats,feiypkx,t3_ep2y71,1579150964.0,She’s gorgeous 🥰
cats,feivdjw,t3_ep7cq5,1579148237.0,My heart breaks for you. I’m sure you gave him a life full of love and happiness
