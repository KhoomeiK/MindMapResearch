AskReddit,fdx0brz,t1_fdwcv5w,1578764036.0,"I can beat people so easily. It's very uncomfortable but when it's competition with friends, I don't mind. Sometimes I see a guy staring at me but I ignore it. I don't think he knows that I know. I see it from the corner of my eyes. I decide to confirm for myself if he's actually staring at me or not. I had my Macbook in front of me and a spiral to the right of it. If my head were facing the paper but up, I would be looking at him. So, looking at my Macbook, I see him staring. Sure it's possible he just aimlessly stares. Which is why I wanted to find out. Was he staring at me or just aimlessly. I take my pencil and slowly turn my head, keeping it down, towards the paper. Place my hand as if I was going to write. My head was angled so I could still see him in my peripheral vision. As my head turns toward the paper, I watched how he literally snapped his head to his Macbook screen trying to keep his face normal. I just wrote down random words to make it seem like I was actually writing something and not making it obvious I was pretending."

Dreams,fdiifyk,t1_fdhef04,1578443634.0,"That scary... I‚Äôve had scary dreams but when I wake up I would realize I actually liked it. Is there something wrong with me? Once I dreamt a friend of mine and I were in a restroom. She was in one stall while I was in another. There were 4 or 5 stalls. At least I think there were. There was a monster kicking stalls open and somehow we were then in the same stall waiting for the monster that was about to kick our stall open. Right when it kicked the stall, I woke up. So, I didn‚Äôt see it. Part of the dream was in third person but when things went weird it became first person. I actually liked the dream though. Why? Anyone know? I basically always like my dreams. I‚Äôm calling it a dream instead of nightmare since I liked it. I really don‚Äôt know why I liked it though."
