Generally a few sniffs of black pepper will have an almost immediate effect, while chewing peppercorns should provide relief in about an hour. ... Pepper contains a terpene called beta-caryophyllene which allows it to produce a “phytocannabinoid-terpenoid effect” that reduces anxiety.Nov 29, 2016



Does black pepper help anxiety?

According to a scientific review published by Ethan Russo in the British Journal of Pharmacology, cannabis and pepper have very similar chemical traits; pepper has a “phytocannabinoid-terpenoid effect,” which is known to help with pain, depression, addiction, and anxiety.Dec 3, 2014

Maybe they'll remove it. Or maybe they will see you're a whiny little bitch who keeps trying to tell people, over and over, what belongs here and what doesn't. Maybe even mute you like the retard gatekeeper you are.

Wait. They already did? How about that. No one at all cares to hear your shit. Have a good night friend."
