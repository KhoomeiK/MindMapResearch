You only see her at night, in a fugue state, when she drinks your blood. But she never kills you--just uses you as a bloody wine press.

You're weak and tired all the time, and when you try to explain why, people think you're becoming schizophrenic--imagining your dead paramour is still alive, and visiting you, and making you late for work.

Edit: it ends 5 years from now, when she's slowly drained you to the point you die, and come back as a vampire.


Yeah you're immortal, but you've spent the last 4 years either homeless or in-and-out of institutions. Your life became so wretched that now you hate her. You have to spend the rest or eternity avoiding her--extra awkward, 'cause since she's your sire you feel whenever she's nearby, and feel compelled to find her every time she gets drunk and summons you."

The South was whooped, but they've never really gotten over their defeat. The battle flag is a ubiquitous symbol of the South. While some argue it's just a symbol of ""southern heritage,"" it's always been a symbol of racial oppression and white supremacy. Slavery as a white right was in the Confederacy's constitution.
