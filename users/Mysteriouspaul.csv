Those same animals in captivity being bred by humans: exist to be eaten by something higher up the food chain.

And sure I think the animals being bred for slaughter need to have proper living conditions and not the bullshit most corporations are allowed to pull nowadays, but I do think you're comparing apples and oranges. Humans and dogs are quite literally evolutionary partners. We're hardwired to see each other's species a certain way from living alongside each other for around 40,000 years or more. Animals bred for slaughter have been bred for meat and don't share that same bond. They are sentient though and they deserve to be treated ethically."

You also have to know the maps like if you're inside Factory Office going down one of the staircases and you hear metal towards the outside there's only so many places they can be based on that cardinal direction so you make a checklist in your brain of where they can be and you start peeking those angles with your gun up and aiming for a good shot for the type of ammo you're using.

I feel like a lot of people check the very first angle from that direction that could be metal, we'll say in the above example near the quest room for Delivery From the Past, but if it was just one or two brief steps on metal it could also be someone entering the ground level of that staircase as there's some metal shit that's knocked over near that entrance that gives exactly one or two metal footstep noises.

dankmemes,fdbi4j5,t3_eke67m,1578257582.0,Wait how are we still alive I thought the Amazon fires were going to end the world? Or the plethora of other climate crises since Al Gore made it cool.
worldnews,fdbhduw,t1_fdbesdu,1578257438.0,Because the Europeans on this subreddit love dead Americans. They're still in shock they have no say in the direction of our geopolitical strategy even after handing over their sovereignty to a paranational organization with no legal basis.
darkestdungeon,fdbc2iw,t1_fdb4uno,1578255916.0,Isn't that like double stress though? Backtracking and no light?
nfl,fdb5oej,t1_fdawjp0,1578254049.0,"I can. Just follow my tried and tested scale of ""Is the run working? If yes it must be abandoned in the second half if you're down by at least 1 or more points. Is the run not working late in the game with a slim lead? Use the exact same inside run 100 times and lose the game""

It's the easiest test to tell who's really calling our offensive plays. 3 different coordinators wouldn't do that shit"
EscapefromTarkov,fdb2xjx,t1_fdaxvxg,1578253180.0,Its popularity is going to last as long as the new players are looking to refund a game that has been running like complete trash for over a week now.
EscapefromTarkov,fdb1oj8,t3_ej97qt,1578252694.0,This is getting real sad at this point
todayilearned,fd7af0o,t1_fd6lcmg,1578201550.0,Don't house actual terrorists in your country. When the NATO/US forces come to your village and ask you where the terrorists are don't spit on their outreached hand and tell them to fuck off.
EscapefromTarkov,fd4wa7d,t1_fd36v9w,1578171626.0,"I wouldn't consider myself a top tier player, but I ran Interchange on repeat for a while early on in this wipe and most newer players are better off learning Reserve and using their Scav to farm Interchange/Factory. Being able to scav on Interchange for a new player removes more than half of the danger of the map and having the noob late spawn as a scav gives an immense advantage of most players already being dead for a majority of scav spawns on that map. You gravitate towards the center where most dead bodies are likely to be and you make sure the coast is clear before picking up all the trash everyone else left and making bank. Factory is also good for that but there's a lot more you have to watch out for there.

Back of Goshan isn't exactly camped but most people use it to PMC hunt and traverse the map very quickly and the same goes for the parking garage. If you're walking through the entirety of either of those areas in the first 15 minutes of the raid, you're almost certain to run into another player. Imo Interchange pistol/backback meta is now more Idea/Oli and the computer chains or rushing Kiba if you got a good spawn for it."
EscapefromTarkov,fd4tj6l,t1_fd4s4hu,1578170946.0,"I've noticed the same issue recently when I fuck around on Factory with my trash friends. I'll run some meme gun usually in a poor ammo type like 9x19 or 9x18 and now I've started the search for best semi-budget meme gun in a decent ammo if I need to blow away a Thicc Boi. I started doing modded Ak-104s (the one that's 7.62 and not 545) with the 73 rounders filled with some trash ammo and some good BP ammo, but those aren't as memey as a modded out glock with a drum."
EscapefromTarkov,fd4qz0l,t1_fd3sa50,1578170206.0,"""Allowing you to buy any more items per restock would ruin the market too much""

Meanwhile they're giving out millions through twitch like it's fucking candy to bots who aren't going to play the game for more than a week and completely ruining the market."
EscapefromTarkov,fd4qlgf,t1_fd4km8s,1578170057.0,No but you still lose your gear anyway when the loading screen getting into or out of the raid decides it never wants to progress and your gear gets eaten.
EscapefromTarkov,fd4phqw,t1_fd4l5c4,1578169775.0,"Depends on if those streamers are being paid to play the game or not either from BSG (doubtful) or Twitch now that they're partnered with BSG (likely). I see a lot of Fortnite diaspora in the Tarkov community now as well as the generic streamers that play shooters, but their audiences are more interested in more casual games I'm assuming"
EscapefromTarkov,fd4ouib,t1_fd4m13a,1578169527.0,"Yeah BSG keeps biting off more than they can chew and they always somehow fail upwards. The launch day of this wipe was a complete disaster and now that Tarkov is a ""big thing"" in the gaming community BSG needs to learn that bad launches/broken promises =huge shit storm that major corporations struggle to weather. 

Meanwhile they're ""working through the holidays"" and spending half the day with Pestily."
cowboys,fd4lkj6,t1_fd3w1qb,1578168681.0,"Lol I have watched most Big 10 games for decades, Urban Meyer is an amazing recruiter who relies **heavily** on superior talent. Sure he can get creative and set a running QB up and still win games, but that isn't going to win you shit in the NFL."

""Eh I think he's alright and we'll see what happens if he shits the bed this year in the playoffs"" doesn't really help anyone's situation."
4chan,fd484os,t1_fd3kfk4,1578165259.0,"It's only sad because they lost. Sucks that those things had to happen but what can you do as someone born 400+ years later.

I can understand being able to be mad about something even 100 years prior, as living members of my family are still upset over shit that happened to their parents who were still living in Europe while it was a shit show, but being genuinely upset over shit that happened 400+ years ago is stretching it a lot especially when we're comparing two different eras of time with two radically different ways of seeing the world. I also love getting lumped into the ""colonizer"" group because I was arbitrarily born in this country when my grandparents came from non-colonizer European nations, as Reddit is great at rationally seeing issues."
