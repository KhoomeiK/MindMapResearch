The engine was so dead quiet and smooth that I asked if the the engine had stopped. ""No, it's still running."" I also remember resting my knee on the padded dash during a road trip and putting a permanent dent in it. Later her dad bought her a new 1970 Camaro SS 396 with a manual transmission. She couldn't drive it without burning rubber for half a block, so he turned it back in. Good times."

I'm enjoying my new system. Bass is pretty good. I could use better speakers, but the the ELACs get the job done for the most part.
I still need to add some room treatment, maybe just a rug on the back wall.
I ripped all our CDs using Apple Lossless to a DLNA server running PLEX. The recording is done on an Apple 5S, so it poorly reproduces HiFi.

It could be an individual making $30,000 guitars or someone making $20 a pound cheese or a $300 a night stay in a motel. If you are dealing with a service for example, the people or person providing that service will benefit immediately which enables them to purchase something that benefits someone else. Yeah, someone at the top may benefit also, but it's all the people in between and the people and that support them in some way (grocery store employees for example) that will benefit from someone (anyone) moving money.
