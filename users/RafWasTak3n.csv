sex,fcv2lkr,t3_eizo3w,1577993348.0,"20M virgin here. We give too much significance to our virginity nowadays. When it happens, it happens. Life is a lot more than sex. I absolutely love working on myself to become better, right now though I'm a bit distracted with a recent crush I developed. And that's the path my life is taking me now. I've finally left my shyness behind and this time I'm gonna do something about my feelings. I have had strong feelings since I was 12/13, and I'd be lying to you if I told I didn't wanna do something about it. But I'm totally fine with not having done so, because in hindsight I think I wasn't ready to. Maybe this crush isn't even significant. Idk, all I'm saying is your age doesn't matter, whether or not you have had a guy in you doesn't matter."
