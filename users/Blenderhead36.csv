ModernMagic,ffbylu7,t3_esoyth,1579786888.0,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I think Modern has greatly improved over the past year. It was my favorite format from 2014-2017, but the 2018 meta was unpalatable. There was a lot of praise for the diversity of Modern, but I found that diversity to be largely fake. Decks ran a multitude of different cards, but an overwhelming number of them had the same general gameplan of ""Do something fast, linear, and resilient to win on turn 3,"" often using the graveyard to do so.  Far too many game ones were determined by opening hands and far too many games two and three were determined by who cast their sideboard cards on curve, with postboard games where both players found their hate being the only games that were actually fun.  I would consider the time from Jace, the Mind Sculptor's unbanning to the banning of Hogaak to be one of Modern's worst periods, arguably worse than Eldrazi Winter because gameplay was nearly as bad and lasted for much longer. 

It's difficult to say the magnitude of influence of Modern Horizons, the Faithless Looting ban, and the Stoneforge Mystic unban were because they all happened so close together, but I suspect it was that order. Hogaak was a mistake but I'm glad they erred on the side of doing too much rather than too little (no matter how obvious a 0 Mana 8/8 trample should have been). Urza was probably too good as well, and we're still feeling that out. Oko being a mistake is something that everyone who follows Magic enough to be on a subreddit about is well aware of. 

I'm really optimistic about Modern's future. Even the flawed environment of the past six months has been an order of magnitude better than the 18 months before that. I feel like Modern is in a position to be the best it's been since 2014."

PoE put the vast majority of abilities on per-rest refresh rates, and resting required investing a resource.  No matter how trivial said resource was, that made me feel like the game really wanted me to use my handful of per-encounter powers and basic attacks and only fall back on the stuff my class was actually supposed to be good at when absolutely necessary.

Most abilities in Tyranny were at-will with cooldowns, with a handful of per-encounter or per-rest haymakers.  It made combat much more interesting, since a tank could actually focus on CC instead of just using your two per-encounter knockdowns and bodyblocking.  The added wrinkle of their being a stat that governed cooldowns made level-ups feel much more interesting, since ""use all of your skills once more per fight"" was always a siren song that you needed to balance your other stats against.

Also, the spell crafting system was excellent.  I've seen a lot of games try to do something like it, but this game perfectly balanced complexity and utility."
Games,fezjvog,t1_feyl433,1579458110.0,"I always wonder how big of a factor's Tyranny's release date was to its success.

Games,fezjaly,t1_feyy0f8,1579457936.0,"Not really.  One of the points of the game is to illustrate how being good is often difficult.

Compare to something like BioShock.  Evil (harvest the Little Sisters) means a big reward right now.  Good (free the Little Sisters) means a small reward now but an even bigger one later.  It's not about doing what's right, it's about whether you want a big boost now or a small one now and a bigger one later.

In Tyranny, you're often faced with a reward for doing evil and resistance for doing good.  The Archon of War tells you to burn a village because it's full of rebels and we don't have time to ferret out the agitators; burn the whole place down and we're guaranteed to destroy what needs to be destroyed without getting bogged down.  If you burn the village as he asks, he begins to trust you and will start letting you into his confidence, which means he can be called on for favors later.  If you show up at the village and acquiesce to their pleas for mercy, now you'll have to answer to the Archon of War and explain why you disobeyed a direct order.  Rather than trusting you, he now starts seeing you as a liability and will try to sabotage you later, rather than helping.

The point is to illustrate how a lot of real-world evil happens.  Someone makes an order that is immoral but has reasoning behind it, and those who are ordered to carry out the order know they'll be rewarded for doing and censured for declining.  They're just following orders, and nevermind that that means burning a village just to deal with the 5% of that village's population who are a problem."

fantasywriters,fesi4s0,t3_eqfu6o,1579365362.0,"I would advise you to scrap this idea.

Fantasy worlds are *extremely* complicated by their very nature--the laws of physics aren't consistent with our own world, and that's before we get into completely different histories, cultures, and landmasses.  You should avoid unnecessary complication--i.e. additional complexity that doesn't have a narrative payoff. 

Possibly putting the cart before the horse here, but this will also make any attempts to make an audiobook of your story really cumbersome, with listeners going back and wondering why the reader started pronouncing words differently or else requiring you to hire multiple readers at greatly increased cost.

If you're absolutely married to this concept and your story won't work without it, I'd advise leaving the different words untranslated.  I.e. some characters don't know the word in languages outside their own.  ""Donde esta el town hall,"" etcetera.

This strikes me as something most readers are either going to miss or be confused by, in the name of a verisimilitude that can be accomplished through the writing itself rather than a gimmick."

There are bad movies that are *sincere.*  They're not good, but they were trying to be.  Examples include the above-mentioned The Room and Who Killed Captain Alex (an action movie shot in Uganda by amateur filmmakers with a budget so low that when he reached out to the director about getting a copy, the director sent him the film on a DVD-R).  IHE has tended to like these the most.  Stuff sticks out as real--if flawed--attempts at genuine film making.

Then there are the insincere movies.  Cheap mockbuster ripoffs like The Amazing Bulk or What's Up? Balloon to the Rescue.  Merchandise-driven kids movies no one wanted, like Woody Woodpecker 2017 or The Garbage Pale Kids Movie.  Out of touch adaptations that lost sight of what made the original fun like The Last Airbender and Suicide Squad.  Etcetera.  All of these movies are the result of a film crew going through the motions and creating the movie because they were paid to create a movie, not because they wanted to make art.

It's from the team that did Pillars of Eternity.  They pitched it as ""Judge Dredd, but Dark Fantasy.""  It takes place on Terratus, a world that the evil overlord Kyros has nearly finished conquering.  You are their agent as two of Kyros' armies--who don't get along--are assigned to conquer the last free kingdoms left.

I cannot oversell the worldbuilding, reminiscent of *The Black Company* novels.  You learn not just who the Archons (wizards) are, but how they got that way and what it means to transition from a normal person into an Archon.  Most interestingly, three of the Archons present *aren't* classical wizards; Graven Ashe is an armored fighter, Tunon is a lawyer, and Bledon Mark is a rogue. 
 Terratus is also a bit earlier in its history than we normally see in RPGs; it's approximately Roman, with iron just starting to replace bronze as the metal of choice.  

Gameplay wise, it has all of the good RPG shit.  Lots of nonlinear solutions, clever workarounds (the first thing you're supposed to do is read a scroll that triggers a kill spell on a specific calendar date a few days away. Yet there's a place to rest, passing time, in the very first town.  Curious...), and mutually exclusive outcomes.

I think one of the reasons this game got mostly overlooked is that it was marketed as ""A dark fantasy RPG taking place in a world where evil has already won,"" and it dropped less than a week after the 2016 presidential election.

The dragon dismisses the Chosen One, saying its seen a dozen humans who claim to be Chosen based on the same prophecy, each quietly dismissed as a ""false Chosen"" after their failure, re-contextualizing the hero's place in the world.

Also, as a corollary: anyone who says ""trope X is *always* bad/cringey/childish"" is wrong.  There a million different ways to do even the most cliched concept, and some of them are worth it."

The thing most people forget is that the RL has been shrunk multiple times, including purging all non-Rares from it circa 2001.

Unfortunately, they didn't even do that.  The parts of the War of the Spark novels I've read were not written by competent writers.  The scenes that come to mind are Ob-Nixilis fighting Eternals (the only action sequence I've ever read that uses the phrase ""and/or"") and the amateurish way that Kaya explains how she can Planeswalk with Rat (a long-established limit of Planeswalking that's basically described as, ""Except I can break that rule for some reason,"" which is never revisited later).

magicTCG,fdzpwyv,t3_en77jd,1578793103.0,"This isn't surprising, honestly.  I wouldn't be surprised if a Theros Beyond Death story existed at some point but was axed.  The reason?

*War of the Spark: Forsaken.*

The first novel was poorly written.  The second one, *Forsaken* was poorly written and *also* killed off the relationship between Chandra and Nissa.  Worse, it did so hamhandedly and phrased the relationship as something that had never happened, because Chandra was definitely straight.  The reaction to this was a loud outcry, complete with former members of WotC creative coming out of the woodwork to say it was a retcon and a Nissa/Chandra relationship had been planned for some time.

TL;DR: *War of the Spark: Forsaken* was *literally* offensively bad.  WotC had to make a public apology and statement of values--i.e. that queer erasure wasn't their policy.

It's hard to imagine a story going over worse than requiring WotC to apologize for it *and* disown its content.

It doesn't surprise me that WotC is taking a set off, ( [and MaRo has confirmed that Theros Beyond Death's story being so minimal is not the new normal](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/190190017288/is-the-lack-of-story-for-theros-the-new-norm-going) ) and getting its house in order before moving forward."

The bot tables made ELD a miserable format for most of its run by the single most boring deck--monoblue mill--being the best deck and also easy to force.  In a draft with 8 human players, that deck doesn't come together every pod, and when it does it has 3 Merfolk Secretkeepers, not 6.

I think the reaction to Nyxbloom Ancient said a lot.  If that card had replaced Tendershoot Dryad in Rivals of Ixalan, everyone would have said it was a neat card.  Coming after 2019, the reaction was almost totally negative, that it was another piece of gross power creep no one wants to exist."

Get an investment fund.  You mentioned buying from cardmarket so I assume you're in the Eurozone.  I'm American and can't help with specifics; talk to a broker.

If you want to do it with collectibles, Lego (the plastic brick toy) tends to appreciate more predictably than Magic cards.

If you're really scared, buy a jeweler's loupe (Amazon sells them) and the common of your choice from the sets these cards came from (Origins and probably Theros or Iconic Masters).
