nottheonion,ff9vuqw,t1_ff9op03,1579722631.0,"Yep - well, technically the quarantine period is 10 days in most states, close enough. I was just responding to the post before me that indicated that every animal bite incident would lead to a prophylaxis which is not at all the case!"
nottheonion,ff9ipw7,t1_ff98g98,1579713864.0,"You would think this would be the case but it's actually incorrect - healthcare providers are surprisingly not that quick to pull the trigger with rabies prophylaxis. I've worked in veterinary medicine for years and have had several coworkers get bitten and if the animal in question is a pet with an up to date rabies vaccine, the doctors won't treat since they know the pet isn't rabid. I've also worked with rescue organizations in which volunteers were frequently bitten by feral cats and even healthcare professionals didn't opt for prophylaxis simply because cases of domestic animals contracting rabies are far less common."
Pets,ff6b315,t1_ff68151,1579623294.0,"The clarification is definitely helpful - and I am so so sorry to hear that she's facing such a devastating condition! I know that's incredibly taxing for you as well as her, and you're in my thoughts. It's so wonderful that you're doing so much to help her.

One thing I did not mention in my initial comment is to look into finding donations of carts. More and more carts are donated after pets pass away nowadays since carts are becoming more common. It may be helpful for you to contact local rescue organizations, especially those that specialize in special-needs pets, to see if they have any hand-me-down carts that would fit your pup. If not, K9 Carts, Eddie's Wheels, and Walkin' Wheels are cart companies I've worked with in the past with great results.

Help 'Em Up Harnesses are great options too if she still has decent mobility but just needs a bit of added support - it's a special full-body harness with handles both in front and the rear so you give her an extra hand when she's walking around. In the meantime, if you aren't already doing this, it's easy to fashion a basic harness out of a reusable grocery bag to sling under her belly for some extra support! If you google 'DIY grocery bag dog sling' you should find plenty of pictures and videos on how to make one. You can use a towel for this too but the handles are definitely helpful."
Pets,ff66s6m,t3_eru4xy,1579620490.0,"I would encourage you to first look for animal rehabilitation facilities in your area to try to treat the issue before resorting to a cart/wheelchair. Larger dogs very commonly develop arthritis and it's often just a matter of getting them moving more regularly to reverse its progression and get them back to normal. Wheelchairs are more of a last-ditch effort for dogs with severe neurological damage or paralysis because using them regularly leads to muscle atrophy. You can typically adjust them to allow the dog to still move their hind legs, but since they don't have to carry their full weight the muscles and joints just degrade further and more rapidly, which of course severely impacts their quality of life. Additionally, wheelchairs have to be carefully calibrated for your pet's size, and may have to be custom built. A new cart will usually cost closer to $500.

Pets,ff64c2w,t1_ff63fvl,1579618802.0,Being a house cat has nothing to do with UTIs. They're usually caused by bacteria that enters the urethra or can be a secondary symptom of more serious underlying problems such as bladder stones. If it is a more serious issue it is extremely painful and can lead to other health issues. Your vet should be well aware of the seriousness of potential bladder stones or urinary blockage and should accommodate an earlier visit. Treatment could range from a simple course of antibiotics to surgery depending on how long this has been left untreated.
AskMen,ff612jk,t3_erlbbu,1579616408.0,"Years ago I hit it off with a guy on Plenty of Fish and after talking for a few weeks we made plans to go on a casual first date to the casino nearby. I was really excited to meet him, he picked me up and things were going really well until we got in the building. It's a big casino so there are huge elevators to get from the parking deck into the building, and it was a weekend night so it was packed. We squeezed onto a packed elevator full of people and it was relatively silent aside from some faint classic rock music playing in the elevator. And then the guy started BELTING along to ""Carry on my Wayward Son"" very off-key in the elevator as about 20 other people, including myself, just stared at him in shock. I tried to cut him some slack and thought maybe he was just nervous, but then we got to the casino floor and he just kept going. Whatever song was playing in the casino through the whole date he was singing very very embarrassingly loudly. Not very long into the date I couldn't take anymore so I faked a stomach ache, he took me home, and I never responded to messages from him again."

dogs,fehdi3v,t3_ep5jpm,1579114310.0,"I worked in veterinary medicine for years and the advice we usually offer to clients in your situation is to think of everything she does daily and classify everything as either good/positive/normal behaviors or bad/challenging/painful. Think of each day then as a whole and average out all of her actions to consider whether the day was overall good or overall bad for her. Then in a single week consider how many days are good days and how many are bad days. As a general rule, it may be time to consider euthanasia when the bad days outnumber the good days.

I'm sending you and Emily lots of hugs, and I hope that you will find peace with whatever you decide is best for her."

TryingForABaby,fdkow8y,t3_ekbpu0,1578508086.0," Hello! I've been lurking for a while so figured I should get around to introducing myself.

**What's up with your username?**  I just really love poodles.

**Where are you from?**  The Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania

**What do you do IRL?**  I'm a college admissions counselor for a private university in PA. I love my job!

**Tell us how you met your partner!**  We met online through a mutual friend, did lots of flirting for years before ever meeting in person and have been inseparable since our first official date.

**How did you decide it was time to try for kids?**  We suffered the unexpected losses of both my dad and our best friend in 2018 which led us to appreciate life a hell of a lot more. We essentially canceled our wedding plans and eloped and started talking about a family right away but didn't officially start trying til this year.

**Brief summary of your TTC situation?**  DH and I had the official TTC talk in May and have been trying since, but the first few months was kinda just having fun with more BD and then I had to travel for work through the fall which unfortunately coincided with my FWs of a few months. I'm now starting OPKs and getting more serious.

**Any major life plans in the works other than that whole baby thing?**  DH might be looking for a new job soon and we're planning a nice summer vacation!

**Medical concerns?**  I've struggled with my weight for the past few years so I'm planning for a major lifestyle overhaul to try to get healthy while we're trying. I'm considering pausing the TTC process for a few months while I focus on losing some weight (ideally 50lbs) and building up some muscle since I know it will only benefit me and any future children in the long run...but against my better judgement I hate to put the process on hold."

You would not see it as a petty action if someone else had been in your shoes before, did not pursue action against the pit owner, and one of your dogs was now critically injured or even dead due to someone else not taking this seriously. In addition to the safety of the dogs involved, a pit lunging suddenly could seriously injure a young child on the other end of the leash. The pit owner owner needs a wake up call.
