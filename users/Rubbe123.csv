bipolar,ff5jg54,t3_errded,1579595725.0,I second that. Fuck abilify.
bipolar,ff1jrxf,t1_ff0tduu,1579480310.0,"Firstly. For me personally, and many others, the implementation of Lamictal can be quite problematic. It's quite individual, but shifts in mood (for the negative) can occur, it did for me. Post 100mg it started getting easier (100mg is the lowest effective dose in the general population), and 200mg is the ""ideal"". Since you're posting in here, I assume that you have a bipolar diagnosis? 

How has your period on Zoloft as monotherapy been? You say that you've ""heard"" it's good for depression, but mentions nothing of your personal experience. Choosing to start Lamcital hints at it being lackluster depression wise. But yeah. It's difficult for me to say, based on so very little information about your experience on it wether you should stop or not.

The treatment courses for bipolar people are many, for people like myself, antidepressants are very bad and destabilizing. I thought I had experienced hell prior to antidepressants, which I hadn't. But antidepressants are none the less a common part of the treatment, almost always teamed up with a mood stabilizer to counter the negative impact from antidepressants on bipolar people. Lamtical, unlike the other stabilizers are almost exclusively intended for depression treatment. So there is a possibility of a risk to trigger some manic episode here. If that makes sense, they're both anti depressants primarily. Otherwise I can elaborate on it.

Now, finally, I'm going to answer you question. I think stopping Zoloft is most definitely a thing worth to consider. In terms of bipolar depression Lamictal tends to pack more of a punch (an accurate one) and Zoloft might not be necessary anymore. But it is just a consideration that you should make, and maybe try. I can't tell you that you should because it's the right thing to do, it's too individual. What you need to remember I'd say is to take it slow when stepping off of it. 200mg is the max dose and you've been on it for a long time so withdrawal is to be expected, you and your doctor needs to make come up with the approach, and then of course you adjust it depending on your experience. Don't be discouraged immediately if your schedule is too aggressive.

In terms of anxiety management, if the Lamictal proves to not do the trick there, maybe a lower dose of Zoloft is ok. There's also Lexapro which is supposedly is very good against anxiety, it was my least negative antidepressant. Apparently it's more ""narrow"" than other SSRIs in what receptors it affects. And like I said earlier, there is a bunch of non serotonin agents that can be used for anxiety.

In conclusion: It's worth to consider and try, but it's up to you in the end what works and what doesn't. Good luck!"
LivestreamFail,fettd5e,t1_fetoro6,1579379842.0,"""but the benefits are not great enough to recommend universalnewborn circumcision."" - It comes down to the preference of the parents in the end.

""Note: Some studies show that good hygiene can help prevent certain problems with the penis, including infections and swelling, even if the penis is not circumcised. In addition, using a condom during sex will help prevent STDs and other infections."" So there's this thing called hygiene, idk if showers and soap is a rare commodity in america.

Even in America where it's standard procedure medical experts can't recommend it universally with a straight face because in reality there is no real basis for it other than religious and cultural preferences of parents on what their childs penis should look like. It's a fucking violation of a persons integrity to dismember them without any medical reason or consent.

bipolar,fejmq8g,t1_feiub3p,1579180093.0,"Ah, perfect. I'll look into this for sure. As of like the 9 last months I've been doing better, relatively. And you know, I fill in these charts to grade my mental health etc, they'll ask me how I'm doing and so forth.  The problem however, and this has been going on since 9 months back, is that I usually meet these people early on in the day, which is when I'm in my best shape. So I tell them I feel ok, because I do in the moment. Same goes for these charts. But in reality, over x period, I have times where I'm moderately to severely depressed, and almost on a daily basis during the afternoon my mental health decays quite rapidly. Very volatile fluctuations, but for some reason I always forget to mention these things, and when they ask me in general I can't even remember that yesterday I spent the entire evening with very intrusive suicide thought as an example. Which means I give a false positive. And then you know, I get home, the shitshow starts again. But I won't see my psychiatrist for like another 6 months."
bipolar,fej5o0e,t3_ep95ap,1579157896.0,"It's a difficult question for me. Mental illness' runs quite rampant in my family, some killed themselves, most didn't. Others struggle for various reasons, and some came out golden. Big diversity. I struggle with this question a lot myself. But at the same time, I know that there are many bipolar people that manage life very well, including family. The real problem is when bipolarity isn't identified or if they aren't taking treatment for it. Also, there's a wide range of bipolarity so what would be passed down? Some bipolarity is extremely genetic, while others rely heavily on environmental factors. We know it's hereditary to a degree. But iirc, there appears to be different sets of genes that result in it. What kind of bipolarity do the different sets correspond to? And we all know how common shared genes are within humanity, how common are these in the general population? Do we also stop those carrying the genes but have no family records of the illness just in case?

A lot of us have a more or less traumatic life experience, but why is that? In a lot of cases it is because we spent decades not knowing what was going on. If a diagnosed person receive children and they're otherwise a normal person, and it is passed on. How well can that child tackle life if we're able to intervene with help early on and explain the illness to them?

It's not a yes or no question. Sorry to disappoint. It's a slippery fucking slope discussing this. How far can you drag a discussion like this? Are our lives not worth as much as others? Do we not deserve a chance at life? Should someone else decide this for us? And what other ""traits"" can we apply this to?

I have this illness. It has caused me a great deal of pain. I wish I didn't have it. But it's the card I was dealt. Diagnosed in mid twenties, too late IMO, could've perhaps had a great life by now if I had help early on. Next bad episode I might actually succeed with suicide, only God knows.

From a genetic perspective this is really my only flaw. I'm considered a good person, a great friend. My physical base health is above average. I'm also a verified genius, despite being heavily sedated when evaluated (Hehe, I know I'm swearing in church by saying this). My intellect made me a very valuable asset to the companies I've worked for, and in my social sphere. Despite my personal torment caused by this illness, my aggregated output in society during my lifetime will probably be heavily positive, possibly better than many ""normal people"" (I'm not a nazi, by normal people I mean those free from mental illness, nor do I consider my life more valuable than anyone else). Genetically I'd be a fucking breeding bull (half joke) if we practiced ""selective breeding"" outside of sperm donations (I despise the idea of it), if it wasn't for my bipolarity :D

My suicidal behavior or thoughts isn't based on the idea that ""everyone would be better off without me"", if anything the only reason I'm still alive is because I'm aware of the fact that I have a positive effect on people around me and my departure would impact them in a negative way, most of all my parents probably. I'm just sick of the pain that I keep causing myself and want it to FUCKING END. And in this sense I'm not unique at all, a lot of us reason like this. But there might be a day where the straw that broke the camels back come. And let's be honest, if that day **truly** comes, there's nothing or no one that would be able to stop any of us.

Oh well, enough about that. It's a question I struggle with. But I think my decision is leaning towards personally not having children, at least not biological ones because it'd be unfair for me, I THINK, to risk passing this down and make them experience what I do. Let alone the reality of the straw that breaks my back coming and how it would affect them. If anything I'd consider adoption because somewhere deep down I really want children, and I do know that there are millions of children in different parts of the world living in horrendous conditions, and whatever I can provide for them till the day I die, hopefully from natural causes, will hopefully, and probably be better than them remaining in the same situation. And in that case I wouldn't feel guilty for passing something down (parents die, it's the cycle of life and children overcome it), and if my departure comes before they're adults and ready to live independently, I think (and would make damn sure) that I have people around me that I trust and would be willing to care and love that child as if it was their own.

These are just my own thoughts regarding **myself** only based on my own personal life experience. To give a final answer to your question, it's up to them as it is for everyone else. I'm not going to devalue people to not being able to be good parents based on, especially, something as diverse as bipolarity."
bipolar,feilrdl,t3_ep9fj8,1579141499.0,Why do you and others refer to these as life savers?
bipolar,fehnmc3,t3_ep5fsb,1579120194.0,"""and all that stuff associated with it"", what does this mean? What is lack of sleep to you, and poor decision making? The thing is that IF your ""normal periods"" are actually hypomanic, that could explain why you have a ""tendency"" to be severely depressed. The normal bipolar cycle is more of a ""after sunshine there's rain"". So if you're abusing substances, such as cocaine ""looking for euphoria"", because you might be depressed or whatever your reasons are. What you could actually be doing is triggering hypomanic episodes through substances, which in turn will result in reoccuring depressive episodes. This is why substance abuse is so common for bipolar people, and one of the most essential parts of treating it is excluding substances like that. A lot of mood stabilizers work so well because they're actually ""lids"", to prevent manic symptoms, and thus also reduce the depressions. Antidepressants is also risky to use in bipolar people since it runs a high risk of triggering manic symptoms, unless you got a mood stabilizer for example. Which Lamictal is, but it has poor efficacy on manic symptoms.

I think there's only so much energy in the human body or brain, manic episodes makes us spend too much energy in a short period of time, and then we're left drained and depressed.

But I'm not your doctor, this is just what I've managed to gather. You two will figure out what works best. Good luck!"

One instance I was in the midst of cleaning, then out of thin air I got something that resembles the sugar shakes for like 5-10 seconds, and then I could barely move, my body got SO heavy I had to hold on to things and drag myself to bed. Took several days before I was even able to walk up right. Granted I've never been in an up phase for so long before. I could be awake for up to three days at a time and sleep for 2h rinse and repeat for several weeks. Never had any euphoria during these episodes though :( It's mostly just torture, sure I get productive but mostly it's just to direct the excessive energy to something to preserve my sanity. NEVER any euphoria (opiate like euphoria is all I've experienced since I' only dabbled with downers.) I might not even be bipolar. I just have the diagnosis bipolar NOS because I alternate between atypical depressive states and these ""ups"" and the only thing that doesn't fuck me up is stabilizers. I guess what I have resembles mixed states, but I can't even say that with a straight face really, got no proper name for them. Which is quite annoying actually. Atypical depressions (am I even depressed?), ""mixed states"" (Wtf is that, really?). I don't even know where I'm going with this long ass ramble (I always do this). I guess, a: it would be nice to experience an ""up"" that actually feels good and b: I'd be able to actually name it properly.

Oh well, I'll see what I do. I wouldn't take ""all at once"", just 300 or 450mg and see what happens. I don't like to turn in my meds IN CASE I'm ever asked to go back on them. Wellbutrin is expensive as fuck for some reason. Not that I'd like to go back on it, my period of taking 150mg was horrible. Just thinking what if I just didn't take enough? Maybe caffeine pills is better to try.

I'm the least experienced with Lithium, but I experienced nothing negative from it. The concentration of 0,6-0,8 that is the modern standard is low enough to barely affect your kidneys or thyroid. And even if they do, it takes over a decade typically before it starts showing up. Lower kidney function is kinda meh (we can even donate one), it might cause minor swelling of the feet, but can be countered with those medical socks and those meds that like make you pee more. The thyroid effect is treated easily too. If it works for you, you'll buy decades of mental stability at a possible small cost years from now. Mental health > physical health.

The only thing worth mentioning is that NSAID is off limits on lithium (which they for some reason forget to mention often), such as ibuprofen, it can put you in a coma. So if you ever get a headache, stick to paracetamol.

Anyway, I did go through a few series of ECT treatments, the memory loss lasted for about two weeks for me iirc. After that it normalized. The supposed effect of ECT didn't happen to me at all. But I was always on antidepressants while going through with them. So antidepressants made me have ECT which had no effect because I was on antidepressants.

Universal tax based health care is cheaper than insurance on an individual basis. And the worst part of this is I suppose, people in your situation that has to suffer for no reasonable reason.

There are several different mood disorders, neither of them is a pleasant experience to have, but there's help to get. My point about people flaunting around with OCD and Migranes was just that it's always a wide spectrum, and at some point on the spectrum it becomes a problem that needs medical attention. Albeit the mechanisms of migrane and headaches differ iirc so they're not really the same.

So don't stick it out, go see a doctor when you get the chance, if there is a mood disorder, early treatment is always better. Saves you a lot of time in terms of being more stable and function better, especially in your early adulthood where the foundation is supposed to start building.

If you're experiencing this to have a negative impact on your life, restricting you and what not you need to go and see a doctor for it. Find out if there's a reason for your behavior. Seeing a doctor, therapist or whatever it may be over a longer span will give them enough observations to put the pieces together. It could just be part of your hormones being in your teens. That'd be the best thing, since it'd disappear. There are also quite a few other diagnoses that could be behind this.

It could just be the way you are as well. Like you stated yourself, we all have up and downs, it's part of humans and the shifts differ between individuals. People say they have OCD because they want a painting to hang straight. People say they have a migrane when it's a headache and so forth. When OCD actually means e.g. washing your hands until you bleed because you're not clean until an entire layer of skin is gone. So a lot of these diagnosis are just describing emotions that are part of the human experience but so extreme that we're unable to function properly.

Anyway, none of us can determine what you have. But the rule of thumb is that if you feel like this is preventing you from living a normal life or causing you pain, go see a doctor to get it sorted out, whatever it may be.

bipolar,fcpgs3n,t3_eicyov,1577863346.0,Yes. Another year where I did nothing.
bipolar,fcpgqbh,t3_ei9fpc,1577863281.0,Good thing you had the candy before the meds. It'd be bad to take them all at once and chew. In most cases.
bipolar,fcm0ay6,t3_ehw82h,1577760902.0,"Yes. The condition is holding me back a lot in life, I'm currently on sick leave for 2 years. So I don't interact with people in a natural way on a day to day basis. Being on sick leave for 2 years also makes it difficult to engage with people in other areas, let alone dating. Since the question is often ""Oh what do you do?"" and well... I'm ashamed of being on sick leave, and more so of the reason as to why. Considering what nuclear waste I became in my social sphere when it surfaced that I had this, I struggle to believe that new people, especially in a romantic way will want to engage with me.

Oh well, things are looking up mentally so perhaps there's a way out of this solitude down the road."
bipolar,fclzhmd,t3_ehvdmm,1577760306.0,"You will come to accept it, and live with it. It will take time though. I understand the hesitation for medication. For many it's a trial and error, but eventually you find something good enough. Classic mood stabilizers is the best thing to be on. That is the golden three: Valproat, Lithium and Lamotrigine. From my experience and reading most bad experiences seem to relate to medications outside of that. Sleeping is also absolutely essential. The reason medication is so important, especially stabilizers is that the the cycles often trigger each other. Especially the mania. So 100% yes.

There's plenty of good educational videos and studies etc out there to read. From my own experience it was much more valuable to look for these looong ""boring"" presentations about the disorder to get a good understanding of it. The mainstream ""10 signs bla bla bla"" doesn't quite explain the mechanics behind it."

bipolar,fcibo1e,t3_egxoxe,1577660192.0,"It's a CNS depressant, so it does help against mania. Rarely used though due to potency, tolerance and addiction etc etc though."
bipolar,fcibasb,t3_eh0ssa,1577660054.0,"I was on 1800 a day, I went CT, felt like crap for 3 days or so, but totally endurable. I think I cut some other med too at the same time, can't remember what that was though. Not sure which did what.

I think the therapeutic range is up to 3200 or something a day? So maybe further up it gets bad, but it's all very individual. Pregabalin is a real horror though supposedly, all though it's the same stuff just more dose potent. And mostly recreational users falling victim to the obscene withdrawals."
bipolar,fcia2di,t3_eh28mf,1577659602.0,"From my searching I assume your med is valproat? It will make you depressed if you don't adjust the dosage. By far the best med I had to take me the fuck down, but I kept going down and down since they didn't decrease the dose. I did some research on it because I was blown away by how strictly positive it was for me. The research I found suggests that it is probably even better than lithium or anything else, the issue is that many practitioners aren't familiar with it as a treatment and thus lack the knowledge to adjust it accordingly.

Mention your concerns and possibly bring up lowering it to see if it helps. Hopefully it works out!"
bipolar,fci83im,t3_egz3dl,1577658872.0,"Yes. When I'm depressed I get hypersomnia and I eat a lot, mostly carbs in the form of candy and bs like that. Probably some failing attempt at trying to combat the tiredness. Then when the switch flicks (sometimes because of medicinal change, which can cause some of it) I lose weight insanely fast, several pounds a week at times. I probably eat less (it's very blurry so...) and being at full speed almost around the clock for weeks, all that jazz, anxiety, walking around super anxious and aggressive (I interpretate the aggressive behaviour as anxiety)."
bipolar,fbzexsi,t3_ef2de9,1577244435.0,"It has destroyed many of our lives. The reasons vary, but yours are not unique. The beauty of life and everything else in this world for that matter is that after destruction, it can always be rebuilt. Both the mania and depression are just toxins that makes you act weird and see things in poor lighting. Mania is the trigger to depressive episodes, so your mania probably wore off and why you feel like there's no way out is because of the depression. I haven't been in your particular situation regarding infidelity, but many others have. But the depression and feeling like there's no way out is something I know very well. But... it is NOT permanent, it feels like it is and the road to recovery can be a very long dark bumpy road, but you do get out of it eventually. No matter what your poisoned mind tells you, don't listen to it. ***The light is there***, but it's like a curved tunnel, you can't see it until later.

&#x200B;

Keep seeing your therapist and your doctor and take your meds. And remember, it is temporary, and everything can be rebuilt. Cling on to that no matter what. As far as your marriage goes, your mentioning of regret, infidelity and what not. I'm a strong believer of honesty being the best solution (it has worked for me the best), things like these linger on and keep wearing you down very easily, and that is NOT something that a bipolar person should bear. When (if you haven't) to tell the truth to your spouse is up to you, but it's the only fair thing to do, to BOTH of you and then move on from there.

And as a senior in the bipolar club (just a joke), I welcome you with open arms, there's no judgement here, we all know what this thing does to you. Bit of 101 in the club: #1 Take your medication (!!). #2 Make sure you get your sleep (it's almost more significant than medication for most). #3 Keep in contact with your health care personnel and have an open and honest dialogue with them regarding your current mood and medication, so that it can be adjusted in the best way possible. #4 When you are ready (if you haven't) let your loved ones know about your situation so they know what's going on. Ask them to read up on it or have them join you at the doctors office.

&#x200B;

Anyway, that's the end of my rambling. I hope you can make use of some of it at least. Good luck!"

bipolar,fbz5hrv,t3_ef6l8i,1577235690.0,"I mean, the way to differentiate the two is the length of the episodes I'd say. I have both, it's not uncommon for them to go hand in hand. I got evaluated for ADHD, and it became pretty evident that I had it. Apparently I had typical body language of someone with it, and the specific tests I had to take for some reason really triggered it? I guess that's their purpose though. And they explained to me that if the ADHD or ADD is properly managed it will also stabilize the bipolarity, since the characteristics of ADHD whatever it may trigger bipolar episodes more frequently. Which in hindsight I can confirm. I was terrified at first though to take the ADHD medication out of fear of it triggering an episode (been on wellbutrin which is an NDRI and other AD meds that did NOT work well), I don't quite understand it, but for some reason it worked as they said it would."
bipolar,fbz3sv3,t3_ef777x,1577234219.0,Yes. Very annoying. So tired of being tired. Also comes at really inconvenient times.
bipolar,fbz3mxz,t1_fbytt0e,1577234078.0,This is probably the only positive thing. It really got rid of all the filth in my social sphere. Sometimes a plague can be positive :)
bipolar,fbz3fib,t3_ef7s6u,1577233901.0,"Of course. Bipolar isn't a personality disorder. It just alters the way you handle or do things. There are three versions of you, there's the manic (whatever that entails) you, you and your depressed you.

When I have an upwards episode I stop sleeping, I get very agitated and unfiltered and so forth.

The normal me is pretty laid back, doesn't get angry easily unless it's justified, I guess just a normal person?

The depressed version of me... Well, that's... Idk? Dark. I get extremely self critical, very intrusive suicidal thoughts and hypersomnia etc. Sometimes it goes as deep as total apathy where I simply don't react to anything. (Total apathy is quite peaceful actually compared to the rest of this shit)

I don't like 1 and 3. Coping... Don't know exactly with #1 I guess I try to controll myself as much as I can, and contact the doc for something that gets rid of it? Either myself or someone around me. It depends on the situation.

3... Tougher to deal with medically, just... Idk, sleep as much as I can and not act on my thoughts or impulses and ride it out.

Not a very big fan of my regular self either, but at least it's not an existential torment."

For me it is throughout the day. I have one of those Mon-Sun with 6-8 12-2 6-8 and 10/night. I bought it when I had more meds than I do now, but it still works well since I have them throughout the day. Carry it around in my bag during the day. And I have some other ""as needed"" in one of those nice little medicine thingys.

08:00 am: 250mg Lamictal, 2mg Klonopin, 54mg Ritalin

12:00 pm: 18mg Ritalin

08:00 pm: 2mg Klonopin + 50mg Propavan

10:00 pm: 7,5-15mg Imovane (These I don't take all year round, sometimes nothing and sometimes up to 15mg. It depends on my state, to prevent mania). Sleep is the most important thing I've found to not spiral out of control."
