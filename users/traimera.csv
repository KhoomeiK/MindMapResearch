sports,ff5ty05,t1_ff5aa0v,1579610129.0,HA!  This made me laugh more than it should have. Enjoy your day and thanks for the laugh.
todayilearned,feksn4o,t1_fekakyz,1579206767.0,I feel like he was there when Hitler wasn't. Hitler would offer it to his people when he wasn't using it. Kind of like the high dollar box seats at a sports game. Employees get to use it after winning some rafflenor something but not when the owners there.
videos,fejocqy,t3_epbt6y,1579181533.0,I wanted to see this in theaters but I didn't think I could cry like a little bitch in public for that long. My roommate for 4 years was in the volunteer first force in Iraq. The stories he told me after he finally opened up to me were horrific. The things these people had to and still have to live with today is unimaginable.

The kid should never suffer but the parents don't deserve anything special. You wanted the kid you got it, and all the extra hassle that comes with it."

vegan,fcskb00,t1_fcr725b,1577918285.0,"I know this isn't the place and I will be downvoted into Oblivion. Hunters have a self imposed tax on all hunting equipment, gear, ammunition, etc. This money directly funds wildlife conservation and management. Hunters care more about the animal they're harvesting than most vegans. Also what happens if we don't take the animal? They starve to death or become weak from disease or old age and die being eaten butthole first by predators many times while still alive. So either the animal feeds people and dies quickly or it dies a slow agonizing death and feeds nobody. Also if you're vegetables aren't hand picked then the combines used to harvest most wheat and other produce kills mice, voles, and most of all fawns. The baby deer defense mechanism is to not run and bed down and hide because they can't outrun predators. So they're ground up by the blades of the combine for the vegetables. So your hands aren't clean either. No matter what the animal dies. One way feeds people, the other way feeds nobody. I'm not trying to change anybody's mind but I don't like the idea that somehow a vegan is more human than a hunter. Hunters spend more money on wildlife conservation than any other group by a Longshot."

todayilearned,fc6jp09,t1_fc5uycj,1577482196.0,When the Chevy avalanche came out in the same body style as the Escalade there was a huge market for Escalade grills that people could put on their avalanche. It was pretty funny.
