Music,ff1vlur,t1_feoarzr,1579487174.0,I fucking love him and I haven’t had a listen yet. First I’ve heard he’s on the album so I’m even more hyped to have a listen when I get home!
funny,fern15p,t1_ferivew,1579355988.0,Fair enough. I definitely believe you  but with all the weird caps I’ve had I think they’ve all been properly perforated haha.
funny,feqvv3r,t1_feqrp0i,1579346686.0,Yeah makes sense. Just never seen an unperforated cap and I’ve bottled probably millions of bottles haha
funny,feqqhrz,t1_feqjs31,1579344910.0,Definitely think that’s the case... however I can’t work out why it’s so tight. A water bottle shouldn’t really be able to hit torque someone (especially a solid guy like that) can’t deal with.
MadeMeSmile,fepwogw,t1_fepvnhe,1579333601.0,"Yeah but the male we had was caught from the wild and he was an aggro boi haha. The first errr litter (idk what a group of baby blue tongues is called haha), we got like 21 which I thought was a crazy amount. It’s amazing how many babies they can fit inside them."
MadeMeSmile,fepv71x,t3_eqalw0,1579332471.0,Aww makes me miss my blue tongues from when I was a kid. We raised like 40 of them from two parents. They’re pretty cute and chill when hand raised.
single,fekd331,t3_epmg5k,1579197521.0,29/M/Aus by the way. Won’t say ‘hey’ then immediately send unsolicited dick pics I swear.
whowouldwin,feka0p4,t1_fek5r2q,1579195711.0,Good bot.
science,fek75vb,t1_fejr697,1579194016.0,"Addicted? I definitely craved coke more than most sugary goods, so maybe coke specifically was worse. But ultimately any sugar was what I wanted. I didn’t seek out caffeine. I went crazy for small amounts of sugar though."
science,fejqhqd,t1_fejq0qk,1579183277.0,Haha okay hero.
science,fejo2tx,t1_fejiy9l,1579181296.0,When I worked for Dominos I was allowed (read: took) as many cans/bottles of coke as I wanted. It was a lot... I realised when I stopped working there it’s WAY harder to quit sugar than I thought. And I’ve done my share of drugs and quit them. Sugar is no joke.
Yogscast,feew5kl,t1_feevaf5,1579042506.0,I wouldn’t say they “immediately” learnt that haha.
gifs,feb7fpr,t1_feaqubg,1578956127.0,"We’re actually expecting rain this week, so fingers crossed we get a good downpour far and wide."
single,fdxcak1,t1_fdx1hs9,1578767361.0,Sounds like a real champ. 😉
single,fdx1e3h,t1_fdx1bj8,1578764290.0,What a lovely name 😂
single,fdwy0hw,t3_en8w6x,1578763369.0,Hope you have a handsome fuzzball to talk to.
todayilearned,fdqp6kv,t1_fdqoukh,1578671878.0,"Right? It was silly and didn’t act otherwise. Solid story, writing and acting. Not great, just solid all round. And I thought the story should have been enough. Admittedly though I didn’t know about the show until a friend mentioned it."
todayilearned,fdpk4bp,t1_fdp9e2v,1578630817.0,"Oh damn me either. I actually really enjoyed it and was keen to see where they were heading. Was a bit odd towards the end of the season, but I was excited by the cliffhanger. :("
funny,fdjvufz,t1_fdjqb44,1578489180.0,I don’t think I’ve seen anything more perfect in my life. Thank you sir/madame.
CallOfDuty,fdd71qh,t1_fdczk8x,1578297657.0,I completely agree. We shall stand tall on our sinking ship!
gaming,fcu1y1e,t1_fctx3fr,1577969890.0,Only losers get gold I’ve heard.
single,fcteuvc,t1_fcta1sv,1577941018.0,You don’t look old! Ahh I feel that. I recently had to spend a heap on my car and I’ve been pretty broke ever since. :(
single,fcsu4u1,t1_fcs0h0p,1577925167.0,"Yeah exactly, pretty sure my last three years have just been spent drinking and playing games. Although in fairness I’m getting old anyways so I’m pretty bored of New Year stuff it’s all the same haha. Well I hope you enjoyed your New Year! Nice pic btw."
funny,fcqv15b,t1_fcqt8nd,1577892641.0,Wouldn’t even mind them being big hairy fuckers if they weren’t the Usain Bolt of spiders 😂
funny,fcqsnjt,t1_fcqprh7,1577891590.0,Yeah I’m scared of huntsmen but not worried about them if that makes sense haha. Just don’t want the speedy fuckers running all over me. But I know they’re harmless so I always let them be.
single,fcqklm6,t3_eiigke,1577887652.0,If you can’t get lucky then I’m no hope.
OnePunchMan,fcq9jes,t1_fcp1xz9,1577881587.0,Holy shit you’re right. I don’t look at usernames that often but I love his posts.
funny,fcq74hj,t1_fcq6xtb,1577880159.0,"Oh I thought it was a tree for some reason. But yeah, that thing. As an Australian I’m more afraid of the stuff most people don’t think about. Snakes and spiders are fine."
funny,fcq3cq5,t1_fcq1hjg,1577877828.0,You should see our tree that inflicts possibly the most painful sting in the world! I’ll take the explody ones any day cheers.
videogamedunkey,fcq1ud7,t3_eiays1,1577876915.0,I actually thought he was higher for some reason. He gets amazing views for his sub count.
single,fcq1nxe,t3_eifozj,1577876805.0,I’ve literally always been single on New Years! May have something to do with me being perpetually single but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Haha
AskReddit,fcpwjx5,t1_fcp5tgw,1577873689.0,Yep. I think anyone around the 30 year old age who isn’t in an ideal spot has the best chance to take advantage here. I could do so much differently.
OnePunchMan,fcp0bmp,t1_fcoaia9,1577846589.0,"Saitama would have only smacked him hard enough to make him regret all 300 years. Doubt he’d have killed him.

Doesn’t mean we’ll ever see him again though haha."
WTF,fcoo92d,t1_fcodg00,1577837218.0,Tea tree oil/powder is a great anti fungal for something like this.
OnePiece,fcnekmx,t1_fcnei3k,1577810100.0,Well... I don’t mean to show off... but yes.
whowouldwin,fcnc9wp,t1_fcnc88d,1577808597.0,Yeah true I’ve missed that. My bad.
whowouldwin,fcnbw5w,t1_fcn81w8,1577808342.0,They aren’t though? They only “eat any animal matter they come across”. Brutal downvotes over so little haha.
OnePiece,fcnbich,t1_fcnb4e1,1577808081.0,Yeah but it has been for nearly an hour in Japan. 3 hours here in Aus. 5 in NZ I think.
whowouldwin,fcn5usq,t1_fcn5qe2,1577804067.0,"Yeah true, for some reason I was thinking bloodlusted so was considering a more rapid progression."
pics,fcn2usj,t1_fcn2s4d,1577801722.0,Haha yeah that’d be nice. Unfortunately I think they try and bait this for lawsuits and followers.
pics,fcn2ro4,t1_fcn2kom,1577801651.0,Huh? Did you just learn a new word and decide to use it?
pics,fcn2923,t1_fcn1pxa,1577801218.0,Yeah on the surface any sane individual wants to see them punched... but it’s playing into their hand in reality.
gaming,fcmyt5q,t1_fcmwmvg,1577798000.0,Oh absolutely. But can anyone compete and show us otherwise?
gaming,fcmx2a7,t1_fcmwp39,1577796102.0,"I mean if you want to be pedantic, no I don’t. But plenty of people but every year of fifa... So does it matter?"
whowouldwin,fcmvncb,t1_fcmr6h4,1577794385.0,Agreed... they easily leave the state though unless they’re plopped into one spot. No way a president (maybe trump) nukes a state.
gaming,fcmv78i,t1_fcmv1wx,1577793814.0,I feel like they make okay games though. Battlefront is the closest I’ve come to buying one of their games and that was still a near miss to me. They’ve had a stranglehold on sport games for better or worse for decades and I can understand buying a few titles here and there.
gaming,fcmuu34,t1_fcmusbq,1577793336.0,EA does what EA does for money though. It works.
gaming,fcmu7j4,t1_fcmrf0s,1577792480.0,"Sorry you’re right, I shouldn’t have said incomplete. New Years drinking has me a bit hyperbolic. It’s more of a rehash every year, and I definitely don’t think it’s worth the money."
gaming,fcmqajc,t1_fcmq4t6,1577786910.0,True. Only makes it worse to pay full price every year for what amounts to an incomplete game haha.
gaming,fcmpsdr,t1_fcmnkq2,1577786200.0,I mean OP is why EA does what it does.
aww,fcmjxh6,t1_fcmg4h3,1577778317.0,I feel like the kid had safer form than the father tbh.
aww,fcmjryt,t1_fcm6k8u,1577778134.0,The fur looks like it would be rough.
funny,fcmjpmd,t1_fcmegbp,1577778058.0,Oh man it feels like it’s been a while since I’ve seen a switcharoo. They really died down.
Zoomies,fcl6h6e,t3_ehmcy2,1577740844.0,“Here we go again.”
single,fcjud89,t3_ehkber,1577705176.0,But what is your final form?
MadeMeSmile,fc5htj0,t1_fc42vwg,1577457994.0,"Fair, but I was responding to someone else. I see you commented saying someone else jumped to conclusions but you’ve done the same here... I know what your story was about and that’s why I made a comment to someone else about something else?"
MadeMeSmile,fc3s81b,t1_fc38vx5,1577397302.0,Haha my mums staffy could eat the hardest cow bones. Was actually amazing to see such a big baby crunch through such solid bones like they were nothing.
MadeMeSmile,fc3r6n7,t1_fc3k9ck,1577396563.0,I was playing SNES when I was 3...
aww,fc2ix1r,t1_fc25sq1,1577362636.0,"Yeah my old boy was overdue... but it was still sudden if that makes sense. Like it was expected to happen,  but I came home one night and found him fallen over... that had never happened before and it was apparent he had a bad night."
aww,fc24zd4,t1_fc1r7u2,1577340656.0,"I was lucky to have my boy that passed a few months ago for 17 years. He was blind, frail and deaf by the end but a bowl of food in front of him and he’d light up. Such a good boy who I miss dearly. He was by my side through more of my living memory than anyone!"
HumansBeingBros,fbyraim,t1_fby0c9s,1577224238.0,At my work it’s in our contract that we have a “birthday day”. We can use it whenever we like though so it’s basically just another day of leave.
gifs,fbylmub,t1_fbxgg10,1577220046.0,My fridge is broken it’s been rough.
WTF,fbx0te8,t1_fbwl922,1577165098.0,"Poisonous spiders and flying bugs mostly. Huntsman spiders are a bit spooky if you happen to run into one without it or yourself knowing, but otherwise if you have one and know where it chills it’s just free pest control."
OnePiece,fbg8mkl,t3_ecvkp5,1576840013.0,You’re making it really hard to decide which wallpaper to use.
