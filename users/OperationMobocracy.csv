Further exposure to normal background loads makes them fail prematurely.  

Mine went dead about two months after I bought the car.  I replaced mine myself because the car was at home and it was Easter (Subaru of America reimbursed me).  No problems since and my fuel economy ticked up after installation, too, which led me to think some of the disappointing mileage was due to excess alternator effort trying to charge a failing battery."

I feel like if a Dropbox senior support person/dev took at look at my machine (maybe with some debugging enabled) they'd find this problem really fast.

* I don't know about alternatives.  I switched from SugarSync to Dropbox a few years ago because Dropbox was better supported, tons of things work out of the box with it.  I like the idea of Sync because of encryption, but I can't tell if it supports LAN sync.  I have close to a TB of data and I dread the idea of keeping 5 system updated via Internet only, especially if I migrated.  I want to migrate *one* system and LAN sync the rest.

I have a 1 TB OneDrive as part of a subscription, but OneDrive has limitations I don't like.  I looked again at SugarSync, but it's way more expensive now than it was.  1 TB is like $600 per year.  I could run a SMB server in Amazon EC2 for that kind of money."
BasicIncome,ff60qny,t1_ff5y4w8,1579616154.0,"On the other hand, I think it's probably reasonable not to fall for utopian illusions.  Even with the best UBI possible, we're not going to achieve a world with no suffering and some element of that suffering will be the byproduct of people who make poor choices, whether its to be drunk all the time, commit crimes or whatever.

Some element of socialist paternalism may just be a sense that the lumpenproletariat are like children, with a naive and poorly formed sense of agency, who will just hurt themselves if they're not managed properly.  You can get there with class snobbishness and probably through fatigue; I've known people who had to quit social service roles because they burned out on people that couldn't be helped."
BasicIncome,ff5wrio,t3_erkdco,1579612839.0,"There's a certain amount of snobbishness in-built into socialism that identifies the lower strata of society as devoid of class consciousness and revolutionary potential which has been exploited by various authoritarians in the socialist/communist universe to justify their power and imposition of restraint on segments of the population.  Marx and Engels referred to the lower strata of society as the ""Lumpenproletariat"".

I would argue that its not impossible that some socialists see basic income being squandered by this strata -- not used for food, shelter or basic needs, but instead squandered on inebriation, sex, and cheap consumerism -- and that these people are better off being given housing, restricted food vouchers, and enrolled in make-work programs vs. free cash they would just squander, leaving a remaining basic necessities problem still burdening society.

So part of it is probably a baked-in class discrimination problem (which may be basic racism as well) and a resulting kind of paternalism and ""necessary"" authoritarianism to keep this strata in line.

I think there's also the idea that basic income isn't a control-based system.  There's some enforced taxation to pay for basic income, but basic income also doesn't have with it a large bureaucracy controlling and determining where the enforced taxation is spent, resulting in less overall power and authority than a traditional socialist system."
conspiracy,ff5uthi,t1_ff4cif5,1579611011.0,"If I'm trying to ship drugs into Europe, don't I want to break up my total amount shipped across multiple shipments and ship them in the least suspicious (ie, most legitimate) paths?  

Fresh fruit is kind of ideal for this -- it comes in all the time over known and reliable shipping routes.  Because its fresh and has a limited shelf life, it needs a certain amount of expedited handling or the entire shipment's value could be imperiled, meaning it may be less subject to thorough inspection given the time constraints associated with it.  It's also vulnerable to excessive handling, so highly thorough examination may result in damage to the product, creating a disincentive to inspect it ""too much"".  It's also high in water content, which could make it more difficult to use scanning machines to detect smuggled content.

Dividing up your shipments means they are less vulnerable, and maybe over time you can do a regression analysis on stopped shipments vs. unstopped shipments to identify enforcement patterns or more/less successful smuggling techniques."
conspiracy,ff5tyh6,t1_ff4s1tw,1579610142.0,"My question has always been why haven't they been funded with pallets of cash just picked up at the Bureau of Engraving printing plant?

Usually ""just printing money"" produces inflation, but the US M1 money supply is nearly $4 trillion, so a couple of billion in extra cash is unlikely to have any inflationary effect.  Especially if the money is used overseas in generally ""black markets"" where its less likely to be recirculated directly within the US.

I also wonder why the DEA never used a similar tactic to corner the wholesale drug markets for cocaine or heroin.  The idea being you'd buy up the supply the wholesale level enough to dry up retail markets and price most buyers out of the market.  Production is fairly inelastic and it might be possible to disrupt the supply chain enough that it would take years to recover.

I guess I also wonder why this couldn't have been done as an outright strategy but using ordinary budgeted dollars (ie, not pallets of cash from the printer).  Instead of spending money plotting complex paramilitary arrests and prosecutions, simply spend this money buying up supplies in the market.  This would seem particularly effective if the goal was simply to get people to stop using drugs since you would be taking them off the market and driving prices high enough to price people out of the market.

I'm sure there's some argument to be made that the ""enforcement"" technique of arrests and prosecution *also* seizes the drugs in addition to stopping the people involved in the trade, but I question how much overhead cost goes into a big drug bust that often involves years of informants, dozens to hundreds of agents, complex surveillance, etc, vs. just buying the drugs outright at a wholesale level.

I actually support legalization as the most effective strategy, but I'm always puzzled at the repeated and futile application of the enforcement model and why there was never very much innovative thinking or application of economics used to create new strategies.  As with most things, they probably lacked the required level of moral judgement and outrage.

Yes, some kind of ""winning"" the war on drugs reduces the opportunity to use drug markets for illicit financing, but I guess I see that fractional benefit as too small and diffuse relative to the overall size/scale of drug markets for it to make a difference."

There was a retired couple in their late 60s who kept a space heater going in their place with an extension cord into the hallway so the landlord would eat the electrical cost.  Probably a fire hazard but I couldn’t blame them.

Office365,fen9xox,t1_femyzl6,1579280161.0,"No, an on-premise/O365 hybrid setup is basically two distinct Exchange servers with some glue software, which is partly why on-prem mailboxes show up as contacts online.

You only lose the contacts and get kind of the merging effect of user mailboxes once they have been individually migrated from on-premise to cloud.

Before I worked with it, I was of the opinion that it was really a lot like adding a cloud-based Exchange server to an Exchange organization, as if you had added an additional on-premise one, and it's really not.  It's slightly more than two separate Exchange Orgs sharing a directory, but that's mostly in the glue.

This fact has led to many debates where I work about what to do for/with clients that have a single on-premise server and want to migrate all their users to O365.  There's some argument for the hybrid setup based on migration (vs. a cutover managed with something like MigrationWiz), archiving mailboxes on premise (or keeping some on-premise to begin with).

But for a one-server shop that won't use the on-premise server for anything, it also seems like a lot of baggage to hang onto (another system to patch, potentially upgrade, etc), especially if its a low-talent shop.

This was new to us, as we had always been told before that if the AD property for a locally mail-enabled user was present, a mailbox wouldn't get created until it was migrated.

The last migration I worked on, though, I had several users who wound up getting an online mailbox created even though they had an on premise mailbox with the correct AD attributes synced.

But honestly, the innovation in phones has slowed to a snails pace and most of it is cosmetic or tick-tock improvements in CPU performance.  Given the growing suspicion and sometimes outright hostility to big tech firms combined with environmental concerns, it wouldn't surprise me if we started to see regulations around phone features like charging ports, battery replacement or minimum support windows for environmental reasons.

Planned obsolescence, bundling and forced incompatibilities which have nothing to do with innovation drive a ton of electronic waste.  I have a giant plastic tub of mostly useless proprietary cables and connectors from the last 20 years.

Standardizing on USB C as the connector doesn't seem like it would hurt much innovation.  USB C is literally the byproduct of decades of use and evolution of the USB standard and connectors, and I don't see how you could make it ""better"".  It does 10 Gbps of throughput, is basically immune to bent pins, misorientation and so on.

Ideally, any standardization rules would also be flexible enough that actual innovations (like say a magnetic connector for USB C) could be made a co-standard, with mandatory licensing rights and some small compensation to the company developing it."

Norway is also liberated by the end of the war and would serve as a bomber base, allowing the Allies to bomb the harbors on the coast and the rail hubs in Moscow, further restricting Soviet logistics and command and control.

Booze is somewhat similar, although I think it's easier to replace booze with marijuana in many ways.  Although I know zero marijuana uses who don't also like to drink.  I think if you made marijuana use legal in bars and tap rooms, there would be a ton of concurrent use.

I think putting up big booze, big tobacco or big pharma as the boogiemen of continued criminalization has always been more conspiracy than solid theory.

Success in school starts early and takes a lot of parental engagement.  It is not something the schools can do on their own.  No amount of school-based welfare can fix that, unless you're talking a residential boarding school with staff adults who will fulfill the parental role.

And people do put a ton of energy and money into their schools.  My wife ran the PTA and the parent foundation when we were in elementary school, and the money the foundation raised remodeled the entryway to the school, painted, and installed lockers in the hallways.  Of course people will be pissed when they lose an investment into their school, and it's not just ""my kid won't get my stuff"" because these improvements are meant to be enduring benefits for anyone at the school -- it's not like we got to take our son's locker home when he left the school.

You could just start introducing pure nitrogen into a sealed room and let the air escape through a one way valve.  I'm not even sure you'd have to strap the person down like they did for cyanide gas executions.

The crazy thing is that despite the risks of nitrogen asphyxiation being pretty well known and a fair amount of evidence that it's not only not painless but semi-euphoric -- avoiding nitrogen narcosis is a known problem in deep water diving -- it's not used in executions, despite being cheap, easy and very likely meeting the ""not cruel and unusual"" checklist.

It makes me think that the people behind executions *want* them to be at a minimum a drawn out death ritual for the inmate, if not actually as painful and miserable as they can make it without some court preventing them from doing it because its cruel and unusual punishment.

The down side of nitrogen asphyxiation being found to be an ""ideal"" execution method is maybe the idea of capital punishment gains more traction and we start executing a lot more people.  It seems like the struggles to make lethal injection work -- the apparent trouble getting the drug cocktail right, especially when the drugs they want to use are held back by drug makers, and so on -- kind of makes capital punishment more complicated and less easy to get on an assembly line basis.

I've also never quite understood why they have such a hard time devising a lethal injection system, either.  It seems like a second-year nurse anesthetist student could probably tell you what drugs to use to obtain unconsciousness and probably death.  I know they have trouble obtaining the drugs, but what's to stop the prison infirmary from just handing over the drugs?

Whenever I read stories like this its like they wind up needing to follow the letter of the law in obtaining these drugs, like getting a prescription.
