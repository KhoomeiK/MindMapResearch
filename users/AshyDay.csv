raisedbynarcissists,ff57h8h,t3_erpncn,1579582462.0,"Hey! I‚Äôm 19F part-Indian too, and I grew up there so I know exactly what it‚Äôs like. My mom is almost exactly the same as yours. Luckily my dad is better (though very formal). I‚Äôve been in college for a year and a half and it‚Äôs a blessed escape from my mom‚Äôs craziness. She truly believes that everything is my fault and that she can never have any fault of her own. It‚Äôs terrible but at least I don‚Äôt have to deal with her. When I go home for holidays, we don‚Äôt speak to each other. It‚Äôs been years since we‚Äôve even acknowledged each other. It‚Äôs really tough at first‚Äî I remember hating her with all my guts, especially when she made passive-aggressive, ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù comments about how everyone was better than me at xyz thing (even when it wasn‚Äôt true!) and of course when she was physically abusive. 

Fortunately, therapy and spending time in college away from her has done me a lot of good. I‚Äôm in a good place now; I‚Äôve let go of all the hatred I had for her, and it‚Äôs turned into something like pity. I feel sorry for her, for her narrow and dead-end mindset, and I relish the fact that I will always be happier than her in life, and that I‚Äôm proud of the person I am. 

So all I can say at the moment is‚Äî hang in there, OP. One day you‚Äôll be far away from her, away from her toxic self. Don‚Äôt bottle up your emotions‚Äî feel free to ruminate and introspect, even if the thoughts scare you sometimes. If you need a kindred spirit to talk to, please never hesitate to DM me. Us kids need to stick by each other. Good luck, keep your chin up, and remember you will be so happy someday soon."

depression,fema5j1,t3_epw0p6,1579245563.0,"Hi! I‚Äôve been in the same place as you, and I know how horrible the anxiety can be. Just take a deep breath, first of all. There‚Äôs still plenty of time, and if you organise it into manageable chunks, I guarantee you you‚Äôll be able to finish it off. If you want me to help you plan out your papers, let me know. I‚Äôll be more than happy to help. :)"
depression,fem93qf,t3_epwe2q,1579244305.0,"Remember, when you need time to yourself, then take time to rejuvenate and reinvigorate yourself‚Äî but be sure that this is what you really need to feel better, and that it won‚Äôt spiral you further into a depressive episode. 

Here‚Äôs what I do when I feel like this‚Äî I curl up in a blanket, listen to music and then put in the humongous effort to contact someone who is close to me. It takes a lot to do that but they always know how to cheer me up. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll work for you but it‚Äôs worth a shot :)"

feemagers,feft7xo,t3_eoxkl0,1579064478.0,"Hi! From what I‚Äôm reading, I think you‚Äôre going through a lot and need professional help, at least so that they can do a better job explaining your condition than I can. It‚Äôs understandable if you don‚Äôt want to tell your parents right away‚Äî in that case, I suggest going to your school counsellor (most schools have one) and listening to what they have to say. Remember, you are not a stupid teenager, and your feelings are valid. No matter what anyone else says. ‚ô°"
