worldnews,fc4w1ox,t1_fc4vb89,1577430757.0,"Well, Just ignore the part where i agree about the stupid law, and than Twist the rest until you feel good with your own opnion. Im not surprised at all.
By my logic, you can foresee what will happen if you break a law. Because, y'know, the consequences are written.
Still searching for the part where you read we shouldnt fight against said laws, and  your eagerness to attack me is something that doenst seem health to interact with, so i wont reply again. Thanks for sharing your wisdom with me."
