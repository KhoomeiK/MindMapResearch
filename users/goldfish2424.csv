suggestmeabook,fd0ta84,t3_ejnmuq,1578123457.0,"Light book series by Michael Grant is absolutely amazing. It's a few books (about 7 I believe) and they are around high school difficulty level; however, these books exhibit quite a few darker themes that surprised me. Its very much like The Lord of the Flies in the sense that it centralizes around the theme of the corruption of innocence as a group of kids is forced into an adult situation with no help nor guidance. 
I also heard somewhere they inspired The Dome by Stephen King but I am not entirely sure about that. Either way, they are an amazing read."
SuicideWatch,fcvtybi,t1_fcvsndk,1578010039.0,"Alright great then if you are I also recommend my all time favorite anime Elfen Lied, as well as other better known animes like Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, When They Cry, and Another.
Other honorary mentions are Black Clover, Seven Deadly Sins, The Future Diary, Dragon Ball, and Deathnote"
SuicideWatch,fcvplmi,t3_ej31bn,1578007236.0,I like to go out to read at cafe's. You get to emerge yourself into a story with a good drink/snack (my favorite is hot chocolate since it has that cozy feeling) while being surrounded by other people. Sometimes people comment on the book and you can start talking
SuicideWatch,fcvpe46,t1_fcvilmq,1578007103.0,"You should try out Code Geass, it has a great story line and is very entertaining, easily one of the best animes I've watched. There's a lot others but I don't know how much you are into horror or tragic stories"

AskReddit,fcjib8o,t3_ehg5ac,1577688675.0,"My family owns several houses, out of which 1 was unoccupied for a few years. My mother and I went by every other week to keep it clean and make sure everything was working. 
One of the many follow ups we did I had a feeling something was off but I brushed it off as the creepy and lonely feeling houses get when they're empty for so long. My mother was taking care of the first floor while I went upstairs to the second. Upstairs in what was the master bedroom I found a pair of dirty man's shoes, along with an unmade bed and a pack of cigarettes on the bedside table. I was in shock and approached the bed, only to feel the warmth as if someone had been recently laying there, as well as grazing the handle of what I found to be a huge carving knife underneath the pillow. At that point the thought of running was the only thing in my mind when I heard someone move down the hallway. I've never descended stairs so fast in my life, as soon as I got to the second floor I grabbed my mom (who was thankfully by the door) and ran out the house. 

We ended up calling the cops and after a search through the house they didn't find anyone but they did find the backdoor of the house open. Whoever was the man living inside our house ran and my family hasn't been back there since."

Making a wish every 11:11 is a thing I've done since I was a kid and passed it on to this special person, and although I know it probably doesn't mean anything we all have wishes that are precious to us, so it doesn't hurt to try, right?"

dating_advice,fc0rx7s,t1_fbzzloj,1577298190.0,"Weirdly enough, I take a lot of comfort in fate (sort of). If things don't work out it just wasn't meant to be, stuff happens, keep on moving until it does. Maybe it's more of a defense mechanism to avoid self blame, probably, but I'd like to believe it either way"
