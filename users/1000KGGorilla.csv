But while laying in bed before sleeping, think of your thoughts. Imagine them as horses running around a corral. You'll notice the same thoughts keep popping up, circling around in your mind.

Pick one, and ask yourself, why does this thought circle my mind? Go back as many years as necessary to find it's beginning. Spend time analyzing it.

Then do the next one. After a few days you'll have them all.

&#x200B;

Then... Focus on the things your gf tells you and figure out her thoughts, analyze them, ask her questions to figure out from whence they came.

In other words... think about what it is you are thinking about. Then do the same for others. I like doing it before sleep since that's ""quiet time"", but long hi-way drives are even better.

Good luck!"

She was willing. (I know that hurts, I'm not being mean, I'm asking you to face the truth)

Maybe... He then just left her the next day, so she came crawling back to you.

So, all that said, this could make the relationship stronger, she knows you're always 'there' for her... and you can forgive her for an indiscretion. Just don't fool yourself into thinking you're the only boy she thinks is cute.

You want these 'stitches' to last at least a week. Plus they're open, so the wound won't fester. You'd want to change the gauze, if you applied any, twice a day. That's a lot of peeling off and re-applying a bandaid... to a wound that's trying to heal.
