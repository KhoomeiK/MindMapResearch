One one side, you have  1 ”K” and 2 “I”s, and on the other you have 1 “K” and 1 “I”. That 2nd “I” you started with didn’t just disappear, so you must find a way to end up with the same number of “I”s as you started with. You could produce 2 ”KI”s, and therefore have 2 “K”s and 2 “I”s on the right side, and simply add another ”K” to the left side. Then, it’s balanced.

yale,fdjj30x,t3_d48a3h,1578473135.0,"Do I accept my Yale interview offer?  


A couple days ago, I received an e-mail from a Yale alum offering an interview. I never thought I’d actually get one (I know Yale “interviews as many applicant as possible”, but I figured with as many people they have applying I wouldn’t have to worry about it). I’m caught between accepting and respectfully declining the offer because of my unique background.

After I left the 8th grade, my father wouldn’t allow me to attend school (long story, but imagine him as an alcoholic anti-vaxxer). I stayed at home and took on various responsibilities, like doing the cooking, cleaning, and budgeting. I didn’t complete a formal homeschool program, rather I studied independently from textbooks and online college courses (edX and that sort of thing). I never had the opportunity to participate in the community (clubs, sports, etc), as my father wouldn’t have it.

I’m worried that I would show up to the interview and seem boring. Unlike almost every other applicant, I have no grades, AP exams, community service, extracurriculars, awards, etc. I didn’t publish my own book, or build homes for the homeless, or play on the basketball team, or join math club, or write for the school newspaper. I haven’t even hung out with people close to my own age since middle school. Every day of the last 4 years has been spent at home working or studying. The only thing I enjoyed was the nights I spent reading, watching lectures, and learning about new and interesting things.

I know Yale interviews are closed file, so I can just imagine a question like “how have you contributed to your community”, or one of the many other very open ended questions they ask popping up and I have to answer every one by explaining I’ve been literally locked in my home for the last 4 years. And if I spend the entire interview talking about my shit life, it’s going to turn dark and negative.

What am I even going to talk about? Nothing really interesting has happened to me in years.

I think it might be a good opportunity to explain my situation better and show maturity, but it might go down the tube if I have nothing to talk about.

Do I accept the offer? What do I say?

I know there are some Yale alumni interviewers on here. What are your suggestions?

I wish the interview was open-file, such that they would know beforehand about my past and not come away underwhelmed, expecting to here stories of all the amazing (or at least semi interesting) things i’ve done and reasons I should be admitted.

I know I could hack it, I know I could do amazing things, I know I have the academics down. I just don’t know how to show it. I’ve done nothing to prove myself, not because I didn’t try, but because I couldn’t."

Won’t go into a lot about him but he’s an abusive, insane alcoholic that often spent nights on the laptop at the dinner table (WHILE we and my mother ate) near-naked on skype with women. I stayed at home for a year, stuck in the house with all the windows covered with cardboard and the lights off (he would drink at night and the hangover the next day was irritated by light of any kind) cooking and cleaning and that sort of thing.

I went back to school after wasting a year after some relatives threatened to call the district truancy office. Something happened to me, though, and a lot of people suggested I may have developed social anxiety due to the social isolation (at the age of 12-14 it is really easy to develop), and I was suddenly super anxious in social situations and found it hard to do things as simple as basic communication. It was as if I was a completely different person, and the teachers at the school (the same school I had been attending before) noticed something was wrong but assumed I had autism And never looked further into it. I was so socially inept I couldn’t find the courage to go to them and explain what was going on.

I went through the 8th grade with really high grades (I was even taking college classes in middle school via computer because I had exhausted the courses offered at the school), and I thought I’d be able to get into one of the college prep schools in my city (we have a couple really good well known (and free)college prep schools). I put in a few applications, and found out toward the end of my 8th grade year my father had withdrawn all of them. I left the 8th grade and went back to being locked in the house all the time.

I had a baby sister to take care of (they are completely nonexistent in her life), I had to cook and clean, and usually had a list of other things they wanted me to do each day (I’m taking hours worth). If they wanted a drink, I got it. If they didnt like dinner, I remade it. For some time, my father injured his knee and didnt want to have to use his crutches to walk to the bathroom so he went in a carved open milk jug and gave it to me to empty and clean out.

I tried taking classes online, but I could afford the payments. All I had was money I saved up from testing (in my state, you get a money award for achieving advanced scores in the state’s standardized “EOC”s through middle school, and I’d saved it all up). I couldn’t keep up with the work, either, because I had so much to do during the day.

Its gotten to be super lonely, and I’m more or less certain I have some form of depression (i have all the symptoms, the tiredness, aches, suicidal crap and such, and I went through an awful eating disorder phase so I’m now basically a pencil). The smallest amount of social interaction (like last month when I met a couple people about my age taking the SAT) almost feels like a literal high.

I have tried taking online classes again (a nearby school district let me join their online summer school program), but as busy as I am during the day I had to stay up all day Monday, all night Monday night, all day Tuesday, and then do the same Thursday, Friday, and Saturday just to keep up with the work. When you’re depressed and really tired shit hits the fan so I couldn’t keep up with it. A highschool nearby said they might be able to work something out for me but I couldn’t start until next year and I’d have to take online classes, a bunch of exams, and regular classes, and I’d be 20, so I decided to just take the GED and apply to college. Right now I’d be happy to be accepted anywhere not in this state. I’m ready to get tf away from them and hopefully change myself because I don’t like where I’m at or who I am rn."
