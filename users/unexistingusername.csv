depression,fecwmtz,t1_fecwh8d,1578987562.0,"thank you so much for the kind words, take care :)"
antinatalism,fdjrxc9,t1_fdjri3t,1578485260.0,"yes, the likelihood of that happening is very low. i think it's simply not worth sacrificing new lives with such a plan in mind, we're extremely outnumbered."
antinatalism,fdjme7h,t1_fdjm8pb,1578477885.0,"i completely agree with you, and they aren't my friend but just a stranger on the internet who believes they are right and i'm wrong, ha-ha"

antinatalism,fd1x3wm,t3_ejtizk,1578138189.0,what the fuck is wrong with people?!
offmychest,fcx5w1o,t3_ejdc6m,1578052536.0,"this is a good example of why people should be careful with online stuff.

i'm so sorry this happened to you, i can't even imagine what it was like and i'm glad you got out. i wish you the best."
offmychest,fcl9a2x,t1_fckuqx4,1577742589.0,thank you and i wish you the same :)
Anxiety,fcjxnta,t1_fcjx9s4,1577709553.0,"i understand. it is hard, especially when you don't know if you'll face someone who understands. but if you know deep down that you need help, it's worth it to try again. it's not your fault if you come across someone incompetent, so don't focus on that. good luck :)"
Anxiety,fcjuq4o,t1_fcjt57y,1577705686.0,"yeah find another one as soon as you can, the one you saw is totally unprofessional. i've had similar experiences and the worst thing is when they don't take you seriously just because you seem ""normal"". it's their job to recognize your high-functioning as being a coping mechanism and see how you really feel beneath the mask. i hope you'll find the help you need soon :)"
antinatalism,fcike2y,t1_fciis8o,1577664029.0,"yeah i think you described it well, i guess i'm more familiar with the latter so i might not be very objective. there's definitely a difference. even i only dig into some philosophical topics that i personally find interesting, regardless of what others might think of it. that's probably the most important thing, to just be open-minded and learn not to look at others for approval, but judge for yourself."
antinatalism,fcihh36,t1_fcigzy3,1577662618.0,"it might be a good place to start, even though in my experience those can be the most stuck up..."
antinatalism,fcigp77,t1_fcie3g1,1577662264.0,">I wish we all had a live meetup.

oh boy me too. it feels like the chances of meeting a fellow antinatalist in the wild are *extremely* low. i mean, it's not like we can walk around telling people how we feel and it's kind of paradoxical. it's so frustrating to know that there *are* people who think like me, but only on the other side of the screen."
offmychest,fciefph,t1_fci7ob5,1577661312.0,this is very interesting and i also see why it would make sense.

misanthropy,fc3pqo7,t3_efz6mh,1577395561.0,">I strongly believe if people want to change their views, or their life, they have to do so themselves.

this. i think exactly the same way, because i got a first-hand experience with it. and i completely understand and relate to everything else you said.

this is a bit off topic but i sometimes just observe people around me and lately i can't help but find them unbelievably idiotic. when i was a kid, i used to believe that adults were so much wiser than kids. it makes sense, right? but all i find is that even those who seem *mature* and wise are in fact nothing more than actors. they all appear to know something, to be capable of actually using their brain, but in reality all they do is act like everyone else because of societal norms. it took me a while to realize that just because someone's made it to the age of 50 or 80 doesn't mean they're better than me. they all seem so convinced they know better, though, and i find it as irritating as you do. i also don't see the point in trying to argue with someone over pointless things, and i particularly find it useless to try to explain some of my views to people who i already know will never get it."
