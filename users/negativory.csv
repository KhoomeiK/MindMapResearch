MMA,ffambj7,t1_ffac61g,1579739299.0,"What does destroying opponents and having ""heavy hands"" have a anything to do with being a freak athlete? To me someone who is a freak athlete is someone who is insanely athletic, regardless of sport. The type of person getting away with things someone with lesser athletics wouldn't be able to accomplish due to sheer athletics and not training, and likely someone who is good at many physical activities. That doesn't sound at all to me like BJ penn is even in the top 10 of freakiest athletes. Even Jon Jones is a much better athlete than BJ Penn"

underlords,fdti4cf,t3_emzp42,1578717082.0,Not trying to be rude but what do you even care? Let racist idiots be racist idiots. It shouldnt be hard to not be triggered by a racist name that isnt even directed at you in particular. Nobody knows what race you are. Just laugh at them for being sad and know youre about to stomp a racist idiot

GlobalOffensive,fczb2bf,t1_fcz7s7x,1578097317.0,"I still dont believe thats true. I have been on both extremes FL and CA my whole life and rarely experienced over 60 ping to central servers in CS, this is over CS, 1.6, Source and GO. But it seems like it might be a bottleneck issue which is odd. If I ping to these servers outside of CS its like 50 ping. But in game its 80. So it might not be routing but some other connection issue, whether its hardware, modem, router, cable, etc Im not sure."
GlobalOffensive,fcz4nwv,t1_fcz3uls,1578093589.0,"I will also note that if I put my rate to 768xxx max, a pretty significant % of games I will fully be unable to move and get consistent disconnection on top of screen then come back. I lower my rate and it instantly stops happening. So yes I am being bottlenecked sounds like, but why? Like I said. Zero other devices on this line."
GlobalOffensive,fcz41wl,t1_fcz3uls,1578093235.0,"Its possible but odd, I have 200down 10up? Its not the best connection but obviously way above average internet speeds. Spectrum as well which is a huge company. But this specific pole and area I am in just sucks, it only services a few homes and they just dont care"
GlobalOffensive,fcz3i4n,t1_fcz2s8l,1578092918.0,"Yes on Cat, i just ordered some new cables and a new router to see if that would make a diff but not sure if it will.  


Outside of the game, using pinging, tools meant to region lock etc it says I should have 50 ping to Oklahama, but in-game I have 80+  


Speedtest ping to local ""best server"" is 10 rn, sometimes more like 6-7  


Ive done jitter tests and sometimes it has a little. Sometimes in game Ill get up to 50% choke, but its never consistent from start to finish of a game, it comes and goes, usually in fights and right after is when the choke spikes. I rarely see loss"
GlobalOffensive,fcz2cm3,t1_fcyn3ae,1578092258.0,"Wired. No other connections on the modem/router. 10ft cable. Idk why peopel are saying thats a normal ping, its simply not. Most people I know ping 80 or less to the complete opposite side of the US. My friends are equal distance form the same server (I am CA and they are FL and they ping literally half of me, all of them, including several different ISPs)"
GlobalOffensive,fcz2961,t1_fcysz6d,1578092205.0,Definitely not for CSGO. Anybody who has played at a high level would disagree with you. Especially talking MM quality servers. I die around corners at least 6-10 times per game.
Foodforthought,fcvuavk,t1_fcvtv9m,1578010266.0,"I didnt delete my comment, the admin did cause I called the other guy an idiot.

Taking over a market is a very vauge comment, taking over a market in that context simply means being the dominant sales force.

But anyway I dont have time to argue with poor people on reddit who have socialist values due to their lack of ability to create wealth. Once you double your net worth and see the government take 50% of that from you, youll realize that socialism is a flawed system.

Wait the core function of a governement is to take from people who create and allow those who dont create to function for free cause they cant afford it?

Charity should be done by social movement, not by increasing taxes on those who are successful. Bill gates pays more in taxes than 99% of bernie supporters combined. I would say hes paying plenty of his ""fair share"""
Foodforthought,fcvtopn,t1_fcvsvs2,1578009867.0,"Some exaggeration on the ""revolutionary""-ness of the product but doesnt really change much of what I said. He created a product and it became one of the most successful products of all time. But now losers like xm are allowed to decide how much money is too much money and that people dont pay their ""fair share"" when they pay the taxes equivalent to millions and millions and millions of people combined, and they created tens if not hundreds of thousands of jobs, which then combined again creates more tax revenue than millions and millions of more people combined, yet somehow, hes a greedy piece of shit and a ""parasite"" - these casual communists are so brainwashed its insane. Im all about breaking up monopolies, forcing banks to do ethical practices, stop bailing them out, and plenty of other stuff but Im still a capitalist and someone should be able to make as much money as they want and nobody else should decide how much is ""fair"" to take away from them. Insane that 1 person can pay literally millions of dollars in tax every year and people complain that its not enough."
Foodforthought,fcvolcb,t1_fcvfk3x,1578006599.0,"Youre an actual idiot. The fact that you can even make arguments for taxing someone at 99% cause it leaves him with a billion dollars or if he ""gave away 100 billion he would still have 8 billion which is more than anyone can use"" nonsense. You are a fucking child. How do you think its greedy to want the money you earned, in Bills case, not off of generational monopolies, slave ownership, or any of the bullshit dynasty arguments people like you would typically make. He created a product like none the world had seen at the time and took over that market, but now because people like you think he has too much money, its unethical for him to keep the money he earned fair and square and the fact that hes already paid more money in taxes in 1 year than your entire friendsphere 5 circles out will pay in their entire lifetimes combined somehow makes him unethical?  


Somehow people like you think its greedy to want to keep the money you made yourself, but its not greedy to suggest that everyone who makes a lot of money needs to give away all their money cause they have more than anybody should have.   


Funny you call it parastic when you are a literal parasite. Achieving nothing in life and complaining that someone who started a company out of a garage isnt allowed to keep the money he earned completely honestly."
AskThe_Donald,fbe4yf9,t1_fbcxx2c,1576778291.0,"I mean thats the whole argument. Whether you agree with it or not, theres literally 50% of the world who says that he just got impeached without evidence, and many of them are not Republicans or live in the US or support Trump.  


The only bi-partisan vote both to get to this point and then actually impeach him were a few votes from the Dem side. Even in the actual impeachment there was at minimum 2 votes from Dems not to impeach... and Zero for republicans to impeach.  


So whether you agree or not, to make this person sound like a moron, several trump-hating people said the same exact thing, and like I said, the Bipartisan vote was in favor of NOT impeaching, so....... i dont get it."
