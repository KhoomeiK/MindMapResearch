SuicideWatch,fe8u5ta,t1_fe8srdi,1578930921.0,Thank you so much for caring!

SuicideWatch,fdc8p5w,t3_ekb9m6,1578269288.0,"You're just going to have to kick her out, she does not respect you and your home and she is a grown ass woman. Sounds like she needs to go live in one of those sober homes, DO NOT let her manipulate you and control you with guilt! Stand up for yourself, you don't have to put up with any of that BS, I wouldn't allow my Mother or any relatives to disrespect me and my home like that, I'd kick their ass to the curb in a heartbeat if they did."

SuicideWatch,fd8hzvx,t3_ek61nb,1578218547.0,"I remember feeling like this when I was 13 in middle school and I was bullied everyday at school, my Dad and StepMom abused me, I felt like ending it everyday to escape yet I still held onto a slither of hope that things would get better and they did, still had hard times through my life but I would have missed out on so much had I ended it then.

Give yourself time, things will get better and you will look back one day and be glad you held in there,"
SuicideWatch,fd8dv0o,t3_ek12wx,1578217229.0,"Well damn, it sounds like you have already accomplished alot  more than i have my entire life lol

Don't put so much pressure on yourself and certainly don't let others, there are always other careers, jobs etc, you only have ONE life to live for yourself!"
SuicideWatch,fd8blx8,t3_ek7r0z,1578216429.0,"I've been there so many times in my life, battled with depression my entire life,

I have been at the very lowest I thought I could get and somehow managed to hold onto a slither of hope that things would get better and they did, I'm still here at 48 yrs. old and have been through hell on Earth and back, still have to constantly practice self care to keep from slipping into the dark hole.

Just hang in there and you will see it will get better."
SuicideWatch,fd89y08,t1_fd7mri8,1578215676.0,"I have battled with depression my whole life and when I was at my darkest time when I was on the brink, I still held on to that glimmer of hope that things would get better and they did, they got a hell of alot better than my lowest point, hold on to some glimmer of hope and it will get better I promise."
