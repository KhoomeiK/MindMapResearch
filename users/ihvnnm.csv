aww,fc30p2c,t1_fc0aoyg,1577378788.0,"All my couches have heavy duty tarps attached to the bottom of them because my ferrets (yes, very short lived, typically 5-8 years, most coming down with adrenal diseases) would lay on their back under the couch and shred the fabric and eventually weasel into them. One time one somehow pulled an air vent out of a wall and got into it, luckily he got himself out, but I made sure to heavy duty screw everything. They are able to squeeze under a door with less than a one inch gap and made an unused dresser its new potty... so much poo.

They are very intelligent for their size so they need constant stimuli when they are awake otherwise they will find their way into everything, and then probably use it as a hiding storage. They need large cages if they do not have a dedicated cage, and you can't just have one as they are very social creatures."
