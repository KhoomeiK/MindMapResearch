AntiTrumpAlliance,ff91zcz,t3_es3nxn,1579702856.0,So sad for the Wisconsin farmers that lost their Farms.  Maybe you should re think your support for the MAGA liar you elected president who then stabbed you in the back and said he was helping you.
thesopranos,ff90n5r,t3_es5efg,1579701833.0,Paulie calling Ralphie a piece of shit is like the pot calling the kettle black.  Paulie is a piece of shit in his own right.  FUCKEN Queers ...As he throws a chair at the wall scaring the post out of all the people in the room.   I loved that scene.

CasualConversation,fe6fuwh,t3_enyjql,1578889638.0,In Saving Private Ryan.  The guys were going through a field and heard a vehicle coming so they all laid down in the tall grass to hide.  They were about to open fire on the truck full of germans when all of a sudden there were other guys there that were hidden too and they opened up and just wiped out the germans.  It turned out that one of them was the private Ryan they were looking for.  They couldn't  be pissed and angry with  him because it turned out that he was a bad ass fighter and was equal to them in guts and fighting courage and ability.  It was my favorite part of any movie.

A few cars pull up a bunch of Spanish guys gaet out of the car.  Tony and Paulie are outnumbered like six to one and Paulie was an his normal obnoxious and insulting self.    Says all kinds of totally Spanish insulting shit to these guys and even references Charo.  You could tell Tony wanted Paulie to shit the fuck up and he was freaken fearless with the insults.  Tony negotiates a deal and they move on but the whole thing was a riot.

TooAfraidToAsk,fdhauzr,t3_elefia,1578419073.0,He was a terrible business man that bankrupted his companies and stiffed his suppliers.  He was a reality TV star who was famous for saying the word you're fired.  I worked in business for over 35 years and the measure of your success was not only making money but getting through the day and not being despised by everyone you came in contact with.    Trump doesn't believe in global warming and makes fun of it when 99% of the worlds scientist say it is a problem.   America's greatness has been it's openness to immigrants from other countries and the benefits they bring with their culture and beliefs and Trumps response is to separate parents from children and then lock them up until they can be deported.  I don't  have enough time in the day to continue listing the lies and untruths that he has said.  As a final note he has the vocabulary of a 4th grader and has acknowledged that he hasn't read a book in years.

As far as living home at age 25, if the circumstances made sense because of going to school and having medical issues then it was appropriate for you.  There is no correct time line in life for people to do things.  All people are different and they do what is right for them.
