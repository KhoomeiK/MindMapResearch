funny,fexfnsx,t1_fexf385,1579430215.0,"Yeah this car got a weird mix of features, like it’s a focus ses that has the sync system but no sub, interior colored lighting, leather wrapped steering wheel but cloth non heated seats, no sunroof, it’s  5 speed manual, has traction control but no abs. Though this is my second 09 focus without abs, the first didn’t have traction control either and I had a 10 that had both and the 09 without either was the most predictable. Other cars might implement it better but the same car with the same tires 100% id take the one without either because abs has actively fought my braking efforts and thrown me into a slide that I could’ve easily avoided if it hadn’t started pulsing the pedal when I didn’t want it to several times. And traction control is useless if you actually want to go anywhere in more than a dusting of snow."
funny,fexed0x,t1_fex1er4,1579429629.0,True but on the same car in a lot of cases narrower tires actually work significantly better in the snow because instead of packing it down as it drives over it it’ll cut through it to the ground and grab. My focus had 195/65/15s on it when I got it and I swapped over the 175/85/14s from my civic and it’s a night and day difference in the snow we’ve had the last 2 days.
funny,fexdzrr,t1_fex8nvk,1579429441.0,In most modern cars that don’t have abs (my 2009 focus for example) pumping the brakes makes it worse because you use up the vacuum reservoir and the brake pedal gets harder with each pump and grab harder. The best solution is to gently brake slightly above the point where the tires break free.

Compared to any Samsung flagships the iPhone batteries are exponentially easier to replace. 2 screws on the bottom, pry up the display, a few screws to remove the cover plate if you want to remove the screen though it’s not completely necessary. Pull 2 sticky tabs, 1 screw and unplug the battery, plug new one in and close it back up. Vs a galaxy s9 for example you have to heat up and slowly work the glue off of the back panel (good luck not breaking it) then there’s a ton of screws under the glass, and when you finally get to the battery it’s glued down and doesn’t have pull tabs so you have to be very careful not to stab through the battery while prying it out of the case. Oh and good luck getting the back cover to stay on once it’s been removed because now the adhesive layer is fucked."
dankmemes,fe6baox,t1_fe5lz5g,1578886060.0,"That lawsuit was from people that didn’t understand why they were throttling phones. It wasn’t a blanket all old phones are now slow throttling that was implemented. What it was was battery health monitoring finally being implemented and when the battery isn’t capable of delivering high peak current anymore before that controversial update the phone would randomly shut off or reboot if it tried to pull too much power. Apple chose to start monitoring for those random reboot conditions and throttling to stay under the peak power usage that caused the past reboots. A phone that works but is slower is more functional than one that shuts off it you try to actually do anything. It doesn’t apply to all older phones only ones with dying batteries, and a new battery will bring it back to full speed."

LifeProTips,fdhb8os,t1_fdgouve,1578419273.0,"Half right half totally wrong. He’s right it does help fuel economy because less tire touches the ground, less rolling resistance=better mpg but it’s also less grip and more wear in the areas that are touching."
LifeProTips,fdhb10e,t1_fdh4owt,1578419162.0,"It definitely does but there’s trade offs, for the reason he listed. There’s a pretty small range where all of the tire is making contact and that’ll give you the best grip. If it’s too low the middle won’t be making as good of contact and the outer edges will be, this increases rolling resistance because the sidewalls deform under the weight of the car and force of acceleration. Higher than that range will make it kinda bubble out and the middle of the tire will be making contact but the outer edges will be raised up and not touching the ground, this will lower your rolling resistance and increase mpg but you’ll have less grip to accelerate and stop with because less of the rubber is touching the pavement."

Futurology,fdgoxjx,t1_fc5js92,1578404401.0,"Locally, check out some local vape shops for some that are good for high power draw. Most vape mods use 18650s and the ones I have are Samsung 30Q, they’re 3000mah, rated for 15a continuous draw, 25a pulse. Typically higher capacity cells won’t be rated for as high peak draw, you get one or the other. If you’re looking for peak power draw with slightly less capacity something like a Sony vtc5a would probably be a good choice. They’re 2600mah rated for 25a continuous, I think 40 or 50a peak, I’ve used both and they’re both really good batteries especially compared to some of the cheaper brands like efest (which are usually recycled/rewrapped cells from other manufacturers).
Online just search for bulk 18650 cells or the specific model of battery you’re looking for, there’s tons of options.

Jokes,fc1x7wu,t1_fc0q34r,1577332508.0,On a usb keyboard that is correct. On older systems with a PS/2 keyboard it sends a hardware interrupt and absolutely does have higher priority.
Jokes,fc1x5mp,t1_fc0lc00,1577332452.0,"Only on a PS/2 keyboard. Usb both are software interrupts and are stuck waiting in the same frozen queue, PS/2 allowed hardware interrupts, the motherboard sent the command directly to the cpu vs usb has to be processed by software."
Jokes,fc1wxxo,t1_fc14r08,1577332260.0,"To be honest the drivers were the biggest issue in ME, it ran amazingly on certain computers but others were complete shit. In my house we had 3 computers at the time and one couldn’t even boot from a clean install without bsod, one would do it randomly every few hours, one was rock solid for 2+ years before its first issue. On systems that it ran correctly, it was a huge performance jump, like half the time to boot to the desktop compared to 98SE on the one I had that was stable in ME. Everything felt quicker. Eventually we moved them all over to 2000 pro and that was stable but not as quick as ME"

space,fbzoz2w,t1_fbysuwc,1577254576.0,"To be fair they probably ran off the road because of a separate recall on the cobalts, the electric power steering system can lose a few teeth and have huge gaps in turning like a really worn out truck or suv. I’m talking like suddenly there’s 45 degrees of free motion between turning the tires left and right. Then once they went off the road, the car bouncing shut the ignition off and the airbags didn’t deploy when it hit the tree because it was off. I’ve been in 3 different cobalts that did it (one of them would randomly snap back into place and have tight steering every once in awhile but then hitting a bump would make it loose again.) these all had <30k miles at the time."
space,fbzoskh,t1_fbyu0ts,1577254356.0,"Nah, for one it wasn’t just the delta platform it was the n platform too, and yes they did change the angle on the replacements but I’ve owned a few grand ams and had them replaced on 2 of them. most of them were how you described but my red one’s ignition was one of the bad ones the recall happened because of. I have 4 keys on my key ring and I could hit a pothole and that thing would shut off. It took less effort to turn the key than to turn the steering wheel which if you’ve been in a grand am you know it’s already very minimal effort turning unless something is wrong. The replacement turns like the rest of my normally working originals did."
space,fbznxs1,t1_fbyxa9y,1577253372.0,"Well it was kind of a joint issue, the tires had more tread separation issues than others but the explorer was top heavy and more rollover prone and oversteer prone than the other suvs around at the time, especially when one of the rear tires blows. If those tires failed on something smaller and lower to the ground like a blazer the rollover chances are way lower, I’ve owned 2 blazers and thrown them around enough to have 2 wheels off the ground but never rolled it. I’ve driven an 01 explorer and wouldn’t even attempt half the shit I did daily in my blazer."
space,fbzno8a,t1_fbytgxd,1577253069.0,"I’m gonna guess they were Firestone tires? A lot of details came out in the lawsuit and it basically came down to end of day shutdown they wouldn’t run out the line and just used solvents on the ones that sat overnight, those are the ones that delaminated under the heat of driving, and ford recommending lower tire pressure than firestone does for the tires caused them to heat up even more than at Firestone’s recommended pressure so it made the existing issue worse."
AskReddit,fbz25m0,t1_fbxuyhy,1577232817.0,"It’s a lot less complicated than you’re thinking. You can buy a programmer for most modern vehicles, either email a tuner and tell them what vehicle it is and what mods it has and they can most likely email you a program which you just upload to the ecu with a few simple clicks. Some changes you can even do on a handheld programmer. Worst case scenario take it to a tuner and they can dyno tune it."

Hard drives typically die because either the controller board dies or the bearing goes, or it was hit hard enough the read head hit the spinning platter. With an ssd each block of the chip has a limited number of write cycles before it can’t reliably store information anymore. It accounts for this by moving data to unused blocks and marking the almost bad ones as unusable. Using something like dban is writing over every block multiple times so it does definitely shorten the overall lifespan."

AskReddit,fbwt1v5,t1_fbvy3s0,1577158666.0,"The reason maintenance is so expensive is because you want everything checked over to make sure it’s in perfect shape every time you fly because the risks associated with failure are exponentially higher than in a car. If the engine overheats or stalls in a car it gently coasts to a stop, same thing happens in a plane and you’re hitting the ground. Hard."
AskReddit,fbwssra,t1_fbv4i4v,1577158475.0,That’s actually a lot better fuel economy than I’d expect a plane to have. There’s suvs that are smaller than that plane that stay on the ground (most of the time) and get worse mpg.
