dogs,ffeqdxs,t3_et892u,1579860289.0,"You sound like the ideal candidate for adoption. I have no idea why you'd get rejected except for possibly not having a fenced in yard, or maybe the rescues you've been trying at are particularly selective? The only other issue may be the breeds you're looking at or the breed of your dog?

Adopting a pet near me is similar and has been since around 2005. When I got my first cat we had to go through a whole interview process, home visit, submitting pay stubs, etc that lasted several weeks. Adopting our second cat from the same rescue was a breeze. We went in two months later and came home with another cat the same day. The adoption process at rescues I've fostered cats with has been the same expect for the home visits. Usually adopting is extremely difficult in my area because of the long waiting lists and the hoops you have to jump through, especially with dogs. 

My advice is to try and look at other rescues if you would still like to rescue or consider a reputable breeder. Two Septembers ago, I adopted another cat from a rescue 50 miles away just because the process there was easier and faster. This year I was given a dog by a family friend. I can't imagine how difficult it would have been to adopt a similar dog near me."
TwoXChromosomes,ffep9qy,t1_ffeozn8,1579858584.0,"Yeah, it isn't nice to shame people for it because it's normal! It's something some of our bodies just kind of do and it's a part of life. I think it's important for stuff like this to be researched more and taught more in schools. I was taught this in my pre-med coursework at the very end of my last basic physiology course which honestly isn't good enough. I'm just glad that I know what I do now and the man I plan on spending my life with embraces the parts of me even I'm not into."
TwoXChromosomes,ffeoqky,t3_et7hii,1579857785.0,"From what I've learned in my physiology courses, female ejaculate is composed of urine and prostatic secretions. The study I believe you are referring to shows that arousal fills the bladder and squirting empties it, which is why we believe it's at least partly urine. Therefore, female ejaculate is at least partly composed of urine and that's okay. It's involuntary and it's normal to squirt and it's normal to not squirt. I do it when I'm really worked up but it's not something I find hot as a bisexual woman. That's just life really, we all have different things we appreciate and find gross and that's okay. I think it's okay to say that the human body is gross sometimes but we can still embrace it."

dogs,ffeia8k,t3_et5q57,1579849122.0,"I think rehoming to someone with experience with dog aggressive dogs isn't bad. You also need to be clear that she can and will kill a small animal if given the chance. Muzzling is a must and a fenced in yard with a minimum 6 foot fence is needed, not that she should be left alone outdoors unsupervised. She's also a cathoula pit mix which is concerning because they tend to have a real prey drive and you need keep in mind that sometimes dogs see very small children as prey. She hasn't shown signs of it yet, but it's extremely important to be careful just in case. 

Personally I would euthanize, just because dogs with a history of agression can be kept as single dogs and accidents still sometimes happen. My friend's yorkie was killed by a neighbor's pitbull and our neighbor was extremely cautious with her, but she still managed to get away from him once and that one event is all it took. If you choose to go through with rehoming make sure you find someone who is experienced with this and will muzzle her in public. If my neighbor had muzzled his dog, my friend's yorkie would likely still be alive."
bestoflegaladvice,ffefs0w,t1_ffecrle,1579846323.0,"Most vets I know honestly. I have a 12lb mutt and our veterinarian recommended we get him fixed after puberty hit and that didn't happen until he was 6 months old. In total I think I consulted about five different veterinarians because this was a new thing for me. Even my vet friends I've met in rescuing animals (mainly cats) agreed which was shocking. They all told me that it isn't recommended to spay or neuter until after the dog hits puberty due to potential joint issues unless the dog is of a breed where spaying/neutering is of more benefit than risk. I totally think that unless you're a reputable breeder it's important to get your pets fixed. It's good for their temperament, prevents unwanted litters, and it prevents certain cancers."

dogs,ffb3m6y,t1_ffa4qma,1579750926.0,"The dog park is more for dogs who have been properly socialized with other dogs and trained in the basics already. Bringing in a puppy who isn't great with doggy etiquette can lead to some bad situations since it's such a different environment altogether. It's also important as owners to know the basics of the dog park, such as not bringing in toys and treats. 

I'd try to see if there are any age appropriate puppy classes or play groups in your area where you can get your puppy used to other dogs first. Make sure you also have your basic commands down and your dog has decent recall. There's always some jerk at the park who will leave the gates open. After that I'd start going to the dog park if you find that it's something your dog will benefit from. Some dogs don't like dog parks so don't feel bad if this ends up being a thing with yours. They can still benefit from having dog friends and interacting on walks and stuff.

For your barking issue I think you just have to work on socialization with dogs and training out the barking. Your dog is never too young to start teaching them not to demand bark. It's something I wish I'd started sooner with my seven month old. He's eager to learn, but he was learning so much faster at a younger age."

My uncle is a big snacker and for a while he was letting him have half an apple biscuit whenever he got up for his own snack at around midnight. The night before my dog's neuter surgery he cried for hours because we wouldn't give him his apple biscuit. The day of the surgery I went to pick him up and he looked like he was dying. He was all hunched up and shaking. I couldn't even get his coat on him to bring him home. I felt like such a bad mom. As soon as we stepped out of the clinic he was perfectly fine and happy. Just wanted to make me feel bad I guess. 
Yesterday he cried because I wouldn't give him his super loud squeaky pig."

dogs,feanpx3,t3_eoaa0y,1578950648.0,"Do you know what service or company your microchip is from? Typically you get your pet microchipped through your veterinarian, breeder, or shelter and are then required to register your chip (if it isn't already) and update the information on it. I have HomeAgain for my dog. There's a $20 fee every year if you want to pay for their member benefits, but the chip itself is registered in their database for life. There isn't one database everyone uses, so it's best to register with at least one that participates in the AAHA Pet Microchip Lookup from [this ](http://www.petmicrochiplookup.org/participating_companies.aspx) list and make sure your pet has a collar and tags. [This](https://www.foundanimals.org/5-things-didnt-know-microchips/) website has a more detailed explanation. 

TLDR: you can register any chip with any free service, but it should be a service that partners with AAHA. Shelters won't look up chips with all the common service providers, so I recommend an AAHA microchip lookup partner."

My dog has been pretty easy to trick because he really likes pill pockets, but my cats are much harder. We've had success crushing up pills and thoroughly mixing them with the stickiest wet food we can get them. My cat will refuse to eat the food if she can smell her pills in it so we had to really try out different foods to find the right combo.  I've heard that some dog owners have had success using stuff like feta cheese and peanut butter to mask the taste and smell.

My cat is fine on her own while I work, but once I'm home she clings to me like crazy. She and my dog are made of velcro and every single day they compete for space on my lap.

dogs,fe9avzk,t3_eo5tdp,1578935977.0,"That sounds like such a disaster, I'm so sorry. People can be so stupid, stubborn, and naive. 

I had a girl come on this sub asking for advice because her two intact female dogs who were aggressive towards eachother were also aggressive towards her new intact male dog. Any reasonable person would tell you to consult a professional and get your dogs fixed for health and behavioral reasons. Unless you live in like Sweden, Norway, or some other country with weird laws. 

Anyways, I tell this girl and things just get worse from there. She's planning on breeding two of her aggressive dogs and the male dog she just ""rescued"" is a stud she bought directly from a puppy mill. It has severe behavioral issues from being abused and it isn't health tested at all. She also doesn't want to consult a professional even though one dog has injured one of the new dog's eyes. 

So I start discussing the dangers of breeding animals when you don't have experience and medical knowledge and she gets *pissed*. Listen lady, I have worked in an actual rescue setting as a volunteer and I have seen awful things. I saw a dog get surrendered after the stud ran while tied and it caused a prolapse in the bitch. We had someone bring in a dam who died in my arms because a puppy was too big for her to birth. We were a block away from the animal hospital. Literally the worst thing I have ever seen and experienced. So yeah, people can be so stupid, naive, and stubborn."

I have to agree that planner communities on reddit are pretty dead for whatever reason and I've seen people have questions go unanswered all the time on the hobo sub.

It's been really easy with our cats because I have an aunt who hates travelling and is always very happy to look after our cats. Now that we have a puppy things are very different. My aunt would love to watch him, but she doesn't really have the time a dog needs. 

Travelling is just barely worth it for me right now. I refuse to travel with my dog because I know three people whose dogs have died on planes. All three dogs were perfectly healthy younger dogs with no history of heart problems and they weren't brachy breeds. They were thoroughly examined to make sure they could handle the flights and in the end they couldn't. Having seen my friends go through this, I refuse to take the risk with my dog. That means my only option is to board or hire a sitter. 

The cost of boarding at an acceptable place in my area is around $1k for a week. This includes solo play time, play time with other dogs, walks, feeding, updates, and a vet on duty. I don't really enjoy travelling that much, so I think I'm going to sit out our next vacation and instead stay with my dog. I know it'll give me complete peace of mind and the cost of a boarder is just slightly less than what I actually spend when I travel."

We just made sure to keep the cone clean from that point on. 

E-collars can sometimes be a little disorienting for them, but they get used to it after a while. It can sometimes makes it more difficult from them to eat so you can elevate their bowls on a larger upside down bowl, hand feed, or remove the cone for supervised meal times.

From the number I've seen here, I honestly think you would possibly end up paying less if you had a wellness plan and still paid for the cardio related costs out of pocket. The numbers you've provided are around (if not a tiny bit less than) what we would be paying if we did everything out of pocket. 

I think that you're paying a fair amount for everything, but you still have the right to look at other options. We went to VCA because we found them to be the most convenient and affordable option for us once we factored other costs such as transportation to the low cost clinics, which we also found weren't as low cost as we initially thought.

dogs,fdg5be0,t3_el7kiq,1578380611.0,"I think WSAVA approved and just not grain free is best. Make sure to also pick a formula that is appropriate for the size of your dog. 

My puppy is currently eating Purina ProPlan, but we've had to test a few different brands/formulas/feeding tools in order to get him to eat. We had the most success with Royal Canin, but it is pricier. Whatever you decide to feed him, make sure you gradually transition away from the shelter food so you don't cause tummy troubles."
dogs,fdg549w,t3_el7lf0,1578380384.0,"I've seen a handful in Illinois after having only met one of them before. The first was my best friend's uncle's dog. He was very sweet and the dog he had before coming to the US from Korea. No issues with him at all, but you could tell he was a trained hunting dog. 

I did learn from all of the owner's of the others that they're korean meat farm rescues. Poor little dudes have severe issues and I feel so bad for them, but they've fortunately been adopted to homes with the resources to help them."
dogs,fdg25qs,t1_fdg1d9b,1578377244.0,"Yes, I have met plenty of debarked dogs and it is inhumane. The procedure involves removing laryngeal tissue in order to create this quieter hoarse bark. It is not a normal bark and it is unsettling for some dogs. They have body language to communicate, but it's entirely wrong to take a significant portion of their bark away when they do use it for communication or expression. 

Even the American Veterinary Medical Association thinks it's unethical and inhumane. It won't cause the same issues as declawing, but it's an unnecessary procedure that is of no real benefit to the dog. Debarking involves a significant risk for glottis stenosis and there's the risk for airway infection, aspiration pneumonia, exercise intolerance, collapse, and heat intolerance. It's inhumane and dangerous. It's done to reduce the number of dogs surrendered or euthanized, but a good vet won't euthanize because of excessive barking."
dogs,fdg0boo,t3_el6ts6,1578375445.0,"First of all, all of them should be fixed. Not fixing your dogs can lead to unwanted litters and diseases such as pyometra, breast cancer, testicular cancer. Unless you're a responsible breeder, it's just plain irresponsible not to get them fixed. All of this is preventable by just getting them fixed. You also don't want an unwanted litter, dogs die giving birth when their owners aren't educated or prepared to handle this. An inexperienced dam could easily hurt a puppy or the sire could injure the dam when they're tied. The dam may also injure the sire or even kill him. So many different things could go horribly wrong and you definitely don't want to be breeding three dogs with severe behavioral issues. 

Next you need to figure out if this is the best place for the male westie. Your chihuahua and female westie seem to be doing mostly fine on their own. I don't know why you'd keep two dogs that hate eachother from what you've described with the female westie and chihuahua. If you decide the male is better off with you, find a veterinary behaviorist who will help you with his behavioral issues and the situation you have going on between all the dogs. You just bought a dog with severe behavioral issues from a backyard breeder and you'll need professional help if you want to try and work this situation out. Honestly, I think it's for the best if you find someone who is experienced in animal rehabilitation to help. Maybe a westie rescue? Doing this on your own isn't easy and the fact that your other dogs aren't spayed concerns me."
dogs,fdfwjst,t1_fdfss9y,1578372143.0,"If you purchase a dog from a show breeder, it can be difficult to get one that isn't docked. This is done very early on before it can even be determined if a dog will work, compete, or be a family pet. It's also done early on for a reason. Finding a breeder who will do just what yours did is difficult and it grazes the territory of what's fishy. Responsible breeders don't allow you to select a dog at birth because then they'd be setting you up with a dog whose temperament may not be suitable for you."
dogs,fdfw618,t1_fdft3vx,1578371837.0,That's great then. I hope your pups recover quickly and that this attack doesn't bother them too much.
1200isplenty,fdfvlr6,t1_fdfs41d,1578371396.0,"My mom works in mid-level management for an independent multi-unit McDonald's franchise in my city, but she started working in the kitchen of one way back in like the early 90s when it was possible to start small and climb the ladder. I grew up with this being an occasional treat, so I have some fond memories of being a kid and having a double cheeseburger, small strawberry fruitopia, and small fries. That was always the treat for me and it was rare, because my mom was aware of just how unhealthy it was. I definitely go to McDonald's for my treats, but it's always at locations where my food is guaranteed to be fresh and tasty. Some of the other independent franchises nearby are disgusting."
dogs,fdfriac,t1_fdfpmgl,1578368434.0,"I definitely think you should get a lawyer and get their insurance to pay for ALL of the vet bills related to this attack. That includes care and follow up appointments related to this. It's a big deal and it should be treated at such, there's absolutely nothing petty about it. People need to be held accountable for their actions and in this case some idiot allowed two children to walk an aggressive dog, knowing the dog was aggressive and that the children were incapable of keeping the dog under control. Today it was your dogs, who will it be tomorrow and will that animal or person survive? Not only that, but those poor children aren't safe. We all know this situation could have easily resulted in an injured child if the dog had dragged or turned on a child. It happens all the time when dogs fight and owners try to intervene."
dogs,fdfm90e,t3_el3jd5,1578364963.0,"I personally think declawing and debarking should be outlawed. It's barbaric and inhumane. I can't imagine what it would be like for a dog to suffer from losing such an important form of communication and declawing is the equivalent of cutting off the tips of one's fingers. It's disgusting and selfish to mutilate animals that way. If a person cannot handle barking, they shouldn't own dogs, especially breeds known for barking. If a person can't handle the occasional scratch or trimming of claws, they shouldn't own a cat. People also seem to forget that there's ways to train or manage these behaviors without mutilating animals. 

I don't care for cropping and docking, but I don't see too much of a problem if it's performed by a skilled veterinarian. I personally wouldn't want to own a dog that has been cropped or docked, but there's not much of a choice when you're purchasing from a reputable breeder."
1200isplenty,fdfb61r,t3_el2kt8,1578357565.0,"I'm also a small and sedentary lady. This is what we're supposed to be eating. Most people who disagree with it are in denial or uneducated about nutrition. 

I feel you on the cravings! I've been craving a double cheeseburger from McDonald's for a week and I had a little pickle with ketchup on whole wheat bread for less than 100 cals yesterday. You could probably try making yourself a low cal shake or something like a shake. My favorite sweet treat is jello with whipped cream. It's kind of hospital food, but it satisfies me."

GirlGamers,fdd8e1g,t1_fdd5glx,1578299491.0,"It does kind of sound a little annoying, but I think it would be kind of neat to see stuff like that be optional in more realistic simulation games. I've only been playing planet zoo for a couple weeks and diseases in the game annoy me so much, but the effort for realism really draws me to it."
GirlGamers,fdd7cyd,t3_eknyli,1578298072.0,Thank you for this lovely review! It really spoke to me as someone who grew up with horse/animal rescue/pet owning/zoo simulators being my big source of entertainment. It is so sad seeing some of your favorite genres kinda shrivel up or just not meet your desires anymore.
aww,fdcx3xb,t1_fdcqmld,1578286875.0,This is so happy! Your dog looks adorable tearing into that gift. My first dog is turning one in a handful of months and we're really looking forward to it!

dogs,fdccgjm,t3_ekiy42,1578271561.0,"People seem to mix up protective and aggressive a lot. Agressive dogs show inappropriate behaviors when people come near their homes and owners. Protective dogs, in my opinion, will be very wary of strangers in and out of the home. Protective dogs also tend to bark in order to get people to stay away, but they won't go after them in the way an aggressive dog will. 

These are also behaviors you don't really want in a lot of breeds, but we see them often due to poor breeders, poor socialization, and people actually encouraging their dogs to be this way.

 My dog is tiny and he is not a fan of people standing outside of our apartment. He's super friendly with people on walks, super friendly with people in our building, and super friendly with guests. But he doesn't like hearing people he doesn't know and can't see. He's scared off a few drunks now because he has a very very big bark and honestly it's great. We've had a few near break ins and having him here gives us peace of mind because we know that he'll scare people off or alert us if something happens at night."
dogs,fdbh6yq,t1_fdaumjr,1578257369.0,Thank you! I probably never would have learned about this if it wasn't for you. This is such an interesting article.

The other day he was chilling on a bed and decided to make a three foot leap onto a nearby couch and he knocked the wind out of me. He really felt huge then!"
GirlGamers,fcz0is6,t1_fcyt2l2,1578091193.0,"This looks amazing!!! I really wish I had your skills or the skills to buy a switch and take it apart in order to replace the shell. I would honestly just ruin it and be so sad. I'm really torn between waiting for a cuter edition, getting the tsum tsum edition, or going go the ColorWare route.  I really just want a cute switch and with New Horizons coming out, I'm also hoping that maybe we'll see an animal crossing bundle or something."
LushCosmetics,fcyvkt1,t3_ejitd7,1578088026.0,That's such a cute use for them! I'm using one as a tiny table cloth on my nightstand. It just makes the area look happier.

LushCosmetics,fcvb9h7,t1_fcuy2jp,1577998486.0,"Yes, not everyone is lucky enough to have access to safe transportation and not everyone is able bodied!

 It's usually a one hour trip to go to the closest store (on jam packed public transportation), at least thirty minutes waiting to checkout at the store, and another hour on public transportation that is jam packed and not super safe. 

Just a few days ago a pregnant woman was beaten by a group of teenagers on my main way of transportation, two people were shot at the train station I actually board at in order to work and go to school. People get robbed in that area all the time and just last month one of my neighbors who lives like a minute from the station was pistol whipped in his own apartment. I actually was the victim of an attempted mugging last year and this is supposed to be one of the safe areas in my city. 

I also suffer from spinal issues after an accident I had almost a couple years ago, even after tons of physical therapy.  So I'm complaining but not about the availability of lush stores in my city. Those are available, but getting to them is just not worth it for me most days and a scratch and sniff catalogue would be an amazing way to improve my shopping experience."
LushCosmetics,fcuwrfy,t3_ej0u4y,1577990090.0,"I got the restock email and I really wanted to go for it, but I went a little crazy at Target yesterday so I couldn't justify it. All of their holiday eyeshadow palettes, brush sets, toiltetries, socks, and skincare things were super on sale yesterday. I'm talking less than $2 for sets of real techniques brushes and entire makeup sets. I bought a set of brushes for myself and a set for my mom, plus some socks for myself because thanks to my new puppy, I have no socks! Then I bought as many of everything as I could carry (and buy without being a hog) for a local women's shelter. Lush will probably still be there next year and they'll hopefully still do boxing day 🤷🏽‍♀️."

It's a nightmare for the sociallly anxious. When I do buy in store it's because I'm with my boyfriend and we're able to visit the Lush near him (30 miles away) which is a lot quieter and better stocked."

dogs,fc5kt5f,t1_fc5gjo5,1577460275.0,"That's crazy, we spend $200 a month on our 12 lb puppy and we pay for high quality foods, toys, chews, pet insurance, a wellness plan, and preventive treatments. If we were to only pay for food, toys, and treats, we'd be spending around $80.  $20 is just insane."
Shihtzu,fc328gr,t3_efvpjz,1577379769.0,I've seen way too many small dogs get mauled in my area by pit bulls to not take precautions. My neighbor/friend's yorkie was literally torn in two by a pitbull about a month ago and it was so awful. The attacking dog hadn't shown signs of agression before and it's so common with the breed. I specifically take precautions with all the big bully breeds but I do take precautions when I see bigger dogs that look anxious or aggressive.
GirlGamers,fc31c4m,t3_efwv0s,1577379205.0,"This is so good to know! I don't have a switch yet, but I seriously want one. I like for almost all of my things to be cute if they can be made that way, so I've been torn on what switch to get. I was considering a normal switch with this cover case, a pink or pink and white colorware switch, or the Disney tsum tsum japan exclusive switch. So thank you for letting me know this might be an issue if I got down this route."
dogs,fc0si1s,t1_fc0r3ii,1577298633.0,"I have to agree. Most people aren't equipped to handle special needs dogs, especially bully breeds. They can be so challenging at times and unpredictable. They're definitely not for everyone and treating them that way really isn't helpful. Too many people adopt them not knowing what they're getting into and they end up right back where they started or worse. I say this as someone who had worked at and volunteered a shelter. Many dogs who have been here the longest (those were a year or more) are also there for a reason."

I really really hope that this was a one time thing because you deserve to be shown love and appreciation and you deserve a man who will parent his child without feeling the need to be praised for it. I really wish I could use reddit currency so someone would physically give you a hug on my behalf. 

My long distance boyfriend of a handful of years is sometimes like this and it honestly makes me feel awful. I know what this feels like and the idea of it being my future if we get married is so sad."
