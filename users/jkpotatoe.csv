gifs,fep4wqz,t1_feoyxt4,1579312202.0,Band of Brothers is fucking timeless. The only time it looks obviously outdated is the end of the first episode and the beginning of the second when they're in the planes. Everything else utilises so many amazing practical effects. Spielberg did a fantastic job of capturing realism.
absoluteunit,fep4hzd,t1_feodv7d,1579311945.0,You could briefly keep it on your mantlepiece and you could definitely move it given that you apply enough force.

PlanetZoo,fel37k9,t3_epq22u,1579213081.0,"It's the type of game that puts high demand on your cpu rather than your gpu so any 10 series gtx would probably run it fine - you'll have to find one of these second hand and they're a bit of a collectors edition right now so do some research. A new 1660 would be fine otherwise. Your cpu is where you want to put your money. Any new AMD Ryzen 5 series or higher will work great and will be good enough to run heaps of other games too! Failing that, an older core i5 Intel cpu will be fine too. DDr4 Ram is relatively cheap these days so you can get 16gb of 2400mhz ram pretty easily and will be more than enough. All in all it's not a hugely demanding game but can put stress on your cpu once your zoo grows past a certain size so any bottom end pc can theoretically run it just fine!
Good luck :)"
oldpeoplefacebook,fel1bgw,t1_fekzpm8,1579211918.0,My experience with these kinds of chips is that the ratio of flavour to potato is smaller meaning they're not as tasty as the flatter and often thinner chips. I haven't tried these ones in particular though so can't confirm.
PublicFreakout,fel109x,t1_fekc505,1579211735.0,"Similar thing happened to my friend in highschool. Went with him to get his first set of prescription glasses and on the way home while wearing them he said ""I didn't know there were numbers in the dashboard!"".

PlanetZoo,feky18a,t1_fejk8z4,1579209959.0,I love the architecture styles people have in this game but I prefer zoos where you barely even realise you're in a zoo. I don't like my zoos looking like a modern art gallery of live animals. I appreciate the vision and creativity of this kind of stuff though.
Twitch,fekfutp,t1_fek9x3q,1579199170.0,"Wait so they have twitch accounts and I assume they use them to watch people on twitch but then so make fun of people who stream? I don't see the logic in that. It sounds like something that young teens would do. Also, having no viewers when you first start streaming is obviously very normal."

Are they within their rights to physically remove you from a class? Does it count as trespassing once you've been suspended? I'm assuming they may just refuse to mark/acknowledge any work you do."

holdmycosmo,fe5i44b,t1_fe4ug6r,1578869740.0,Here in NZ 98 is $2.50+ per liter... Diesel is sub 2$ though if you don't include road user charges.
PlanetZoo,fe09med,t3_enb2ld,1578806964.0,This is so clean I love it. How you you feel about adding some kind of fencing (functional or not) embedded into the rock barriers. I like having realism in my zoos and the rock barriers are good for keeping animals in but wouldn't be as effective as keeping people out? I always struggle to find the line between realism and aesthetic in this game.
Minecraft,fdor6n4,t1_fdooo17,1578611061.0,But not starving is SUPER easy if you're not taking damage and it's not like farming is very difficult. Takes all of 20mns to set up any kind of farm that will sustain you for the rest of your game. Having to eat and carry food would just become an arbitrary chore rather than an actual survival aspect

therewasanattempt,fdicvvp,t1_fdiae37,1578440035.0,"OK sure, but his remark wasn't meant to be sarcastic or ironic. It was meant to be confused or even exasperated. Also, how many people are currently aware that,,, is a thing used for that purpose? It's the first I've seen it used like this and, judging by other comments, I'm not the only one. 

Also, sarcasm or irony have had many proposed symbols, most recently this one - â¸® - although this isn't ""officially"" part of the English language. And yes I get that language evolves over time and I  can definitely see (,,,) being used to portray sarcasm but, as of right now, its use hasn't been established for that purpose. And I don't think this random guy on twitter is about to start that trend."
catswhotrill,fdi4hzn,t1_fdgslf7,1578435584.0,"It's a relatively new kindle of some kind. Was given it as a gift so can't remember what model exactly. But it is touch screen and has Bluetooth for audio books and text to speech. But, in all honesty the touch screen is kind of annoying. It has quite a thin bezel and you can touch anywhere on the screen to zoom in or change page. Because of this it's super easy to accidentally change page or zoom when you're adjusting your hold or if you go to put the kindle down without locking the screen first. It also means you are quite limited with how you hold the kindle as you can't put your fingers or palms anywhere near the screen.

Other than that though kindles are great! Books take 2 seconds to download and are always cheaper than buying new. And you can have 100s of books on you at once. But I prefer the old models with the buttons on the side (my partner has one)"

trashy,fcshb44,t1_fcs4q7s,1577916548.0,The ones we have here have always done both of those things. It's hit and miss tho because the gps on them is so bad it sometimes doesn't know if you're in or out of a slow zone. It either doesn't slow you down at all or thinks you're in a slow zone your entire ride even if you're not.
