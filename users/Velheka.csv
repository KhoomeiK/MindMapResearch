AskReddit,fc5luig,t1_fc5kljb,1577461027.0,"2 Min to find two sources *that didn't backup what you were claiming*. It doesn't matter how fast you found them if they don't have any credibility and/or don't even talk about what you're trying to prove. And you've completely missed the point of the teapot analogy,  but I can't say I'm surprised and I'm definitely not going to try and spoon-feed you it. Can we stop this now?

EDIT: Actually because I'm a moron I will try [One more time to try and explain how it's up to you to give proof for a claim, not for someone else to disprove it. ](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof) That link also has a more simple explanation of how the teapot thing comes in, so maybe you'll find that useful. This is unfortunately proving to be a huge waste of time as you're clearly not a very receptive person, I won't bother replying again. Have a nice life."

And none of these 10 reasons backup your claim that you can feel pain for 72 hours after death, even if they were true (The video even admits  in the description that the very first example given is bullshit lol). I'm not wasting my time with this anymore - The fact that you're apparently in your 20's but write like a child is incredible, I can hardly understand what the hell you're even saying. For your sake I'll hope you're just dyslexic.

> they go there to learn not share everthing plus if there onto something there not gonna give there progress away lmao what are u like 12?

So.. you're argument here is that the lack of evidence is evidence? Ok. You do realise a college *is* actually there to share information right? Like that's the entire point of them?

No evidence, no sources, writes like an angry 8 year old, I'm done.

Incidentally, I'm sorry that you're apparently going through a bad time at the moment, but if I was you I'd focus more on improving your own quality of life, and less on... This."

AskReddit,fc1pizj,t1_fc1i3sa,1577325644.0,"1.) That's an analysis piece of reporting, which is to say it's an opinion piece

2.) The article is almost 20 years old


3.) the article itself says that this is not evidence: *""Chillingly graphic though that evidence is, it is not proof that the dead feel pain, or indeed sensation of any kind.""*

And in the 20 years after this suggestion, the Royal College of Anaesthetists has said nothing else on the matter nor have brought up anything more than this vague idea that 'it might be possible but there's no evidence'.

Nice try though."
