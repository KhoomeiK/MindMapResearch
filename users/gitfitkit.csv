Fitness,ff31fdb,t3_erdt4d,1579531128.0,"Work on hip/ankle mobility (I also have to work on my knees). I personally wouldn't recommend using lifted shoes or anything, in my opinion that's just a bandaid and doesn't get to the source of the issue. I have the same issue. I started yoga and have a ankle/hip mobility routine(you can find one on YouTube). My squat form has improved by focusing on my mobility rather than how much I can lift. This will also help with your deadlift, lunge..mobility is key, it's the base, the foundation. Better mobility means better lifts. Just like lifting and strength it takes time, determination, dedication and discipline, but if you really work on it, it will improve. Best of luck! Hope I gave some good insight!"

loseit,fdtikr6,t3_en2qui,1578717273.0,"You can try meditation? This may sound a little coocoo, but I've been listening to affirmations as I sleep and making good decisions is getting easier and easier. I don't have cravings really anymore, and if I do I don't feel like my world will end if I don't fulfill them. I'm just overall more positive. I just couldn't seem to get past my addictions, boredom eating and emotional eating until I started consistently listening to those positive affirmations. It doesn't happen overnight, and it will never be absolutely perfect..heck it might even be a placebo effect..but my mindset overall really has changed."
fatlogic,fdrux4x,t3_ems7pb,1578690177.0,"Continuing my complaint last week about my mother in law who found out she had a brain aneurism and is supposed to be losing weight, watching what she eats and stopping soda and coffee drinking

My husband and I made delicious, healthy venison chili, decent in caloires, a perfect, inexpensive, healthy meal for dinner.  

I look in my mother in laws fridge and there are 3 new packs of pepsi, a new pack of ginger ale and a new pack of orange soda. On top of that, fried taquitos on the counter she had been eating, there was coffee brewing on the stove, there were cookies on the counter, two giant ready made cakes in a bag she hadn't put away yet, a half eaten bagel with butter that I'm sure she'll finish before the day is out, zero options that are remotely nutritious. Her cabinet is full of crackers and cookies and chips, her freezer is full of burritos, taquitos, waffles and pizza bites, oh and pie, her fridge has 6 different types of jellies, a bunch of bread, some tomatoes, lunch meat, milk, juice, margarine and cheese (and the typical condiments). Zero effort to add healthier options into her diet, shows no signs of stopping her terrible habits and there are no fucks given. It's hard for me to look at her anymore. Seriously, she was talking to me and I had nothing but short answers while I was setting up dinner and just looking down the whole time. I feel like I'm about to explode on her but I don't think it's my place and it wouldn't make a damn difference anyway, she doesn't give a shit about her own husband and son's pleas. She's sick again, she's sick for weeks like every other month..she does absolutely nothing to take care of herself. I'm like past caring and being upset and I am pissed off. Sorry for complaining again it's just..how can you care so little about yourself? I just don't get it and it pisses me off."
fatlogic,fdk8v87,t3_eltxt9,1578498718.0,Okay but if you're obese your hunger cues are fucked up because you overeat. So sometimes we can't listen to our grumbly tum tums and should tap into that cool brain piece we got in our skull and use something called..what was it..logic!

fatlogic,fdh2mzv,t3_elcpmx,1578414052.0,"My mother in law recently found out she has a brain aneurism. Part of her doctors orders is to keep her blood pressure and cholesterol down by losing weight and eating a healthier diet. She was told soda and coffee are also things she needs to give up. She still drinks soda and coffee daily. The other night we were having dinner and there was an open pack of cookies on her counter and she takes one, explains to me the type of cookie it is, laughs while eating it saying ""it's perfect for my diet""

This to me is so infuriating and depressing and..I don't even want to be around her because she's basically showing she doesn't care if she increases the chances of her aneurism rupturing and threatening her life. Her soda and cookies mean too much. She'll be 61 in a few weeks and it's like she's already given up. It's just so..I'm angry and hurt and I don't understand why hearing that you have a fucking brain aneurism wouldn't make you stop buying and eating the fucking garbage that is killing you. I don't want my daughter to be a witness to such complacency and defeatist behavior. I'm glad she is too young to comprehend what's going on around her. I just am so lost, she doesn't care. She doesn't take the advice of her doctor, she doesn't listen to her husband when he tells her to stop buying and drinking soda or to stop eating junk all day and lose weight..just..why??"
