SubredditAdoption,fdsdhfa,t3_emv6ro,1578700150.0,"I'd like this sub to be about people doing their job really badly in a really good way.

Like ""you had one job"", but it actually works out somehow.

Or like awful taste but great execution, but though they are way towards awful execution, they still pulled it off. We don't know how.

Snap a picture of that weirdly mended bridge you passed. Or the fantastically secured load on the flatbed. Or the artfully stacked logs on the truck. Or the food which looked like barf but tasted like heaven. The ol dude painstakingly ploughing a long damn road with a snow blower. You know these people! We all know them. 

These are the people who have a calling. It's not pure talent, it's not just skill. They are not the best. Maybe nobody can really understand why they keep doing it. Why they don't change jobs, or do something else. (Or do it differently.) 

It's because they have a calling."

However, yes, I don't remember the person's name. And I did say it's better if the bag is made of sugar, which makes it biodegradable. I also did say it was only for the production. And I also said it's better to use them more.

I don't see your point tbh"

todayilearned,fdp3233,t1_fdoa618,1578618819.0,"Yeah, I've heard that if you just reuse a plastic bag once, you've compensated for it's production that way. So carry stuff home and use it for waste or your dirty shoes or dog poop, and that's all you had to do.

Of course, good thing if the bag is made of sugar as well. Or if you reuse it even more. But, basically, once is enough."

Showerthoughts,fdoyz95,t1_fdnxny8,1578616093.0,"Many physiological systems have negative feedback, so if there's a lot of something, less will be produced. Telepathy could work this way as well, like sniffing things and sensing less and less of the smell.

Could also be like for pain, that you could have modulating effects which could lessen the impression of thoughts on your brain, but that it in the long term could sensitize you to further telepathy, making it harder and harder to ignore thoughts from others, or filter them out."
todayilearned,fdoykus,t1_fdoqres,1578615833.0,"It's called multimodal treatment and is very effective. As long as you combine two pain relief drugs which have different mechanisms of action and does not interact negatively, they can often add to each other's effect, so by using the NSAID as a basis, you will need less of the stronger pain killer and will thereby get less side effects. It also usually leads to less ""breakthroughs"" of pain, so the effect is more stable.

It's a good thing!"
