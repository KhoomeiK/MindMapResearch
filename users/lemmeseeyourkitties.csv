I was five, he was making me take naps with him/falling asleep with me in my tiny bed at bedtime and I couldn't sleep because he snored like a congested dragon. Even at five I remember that I needed to be considerate of his feelings so one night after I laid there long after he fell asleep and I couldn't sleep or move I prodded him awake and told him that I wasnt able to fall asleep because of his loud breathing.

That makes me ungrateful and I better *never* talk like that again. Smh"

relationships,fco77bc,t1_fco65e5,1577825403.0,"What is ""completely normal""?

You're having a very hard time accepting that him messaging young teens to tell them that they look nice is not a normal thing to do, and an adult shouldn't be complimenting random teens to try to ""cheer them up""

I think your normal meter might not be as well adjusted as you want it to be. I'm not trying to attack you or make you feel bad for anything. You're  young and you've been with him for a couple years. We all want you to be able to see this for what it really is, and we know you're in a tough position. We also are aware that he is unknown except for this tiny bit of info you have given us."
relationships,fco5fq3,t1_fco4cpp,1577824428.0,"I'm sorry darlin' but you are deluding yourself. I'm sure he likes your petite figure, but also he definitely likes your mixed race and young look. He can be nice and sweet and make you feel loved while still being attracted to you because of your youthful appearance.

It is wrong for a grown man to seek out insecure young teens to compliment them. I can tell you are having a hard time coming to terms with this in the last few hours, and that is ok. I get that you love him. I get that he's nice and sweet and cares about you. I am curious to know how he treats you in public and in front of his friends / coworkers, and honestly I wanna know if he has a daddy fetish, but none of that changes the fact that his behavior with the young teens is immoral. 

He's seeking out children to tell them he likes how they look. Take a beat to process this. Best wishes to you sister, I wish I could help more."
relationship_advice,fco4keu,t1_fcnxnr0,1577823953.0,"Did you know that Ted Bundy worked as a 911 dispatcher and no one got serial killer rapist necrophiliac vibes from him? Because he knew how to appear normal. 

The Golden State Killer eluded capture for decades and no one had any idea that it could have been him raping and murdering scores of women. He was a husband, father, man of the law... that appeared pretty normal.

Not saying at all that your bf is a rapist / murderer, but sweet people can have dark sides and hide them away."
relationships,fco36yi,t1_fcny1vp,1577823211.0,"You came asking for advice. Everyone is telling you this is concerning behavior and you keep defending and making excuses for him.

Yes it sucks to realize your partner might have a different side that you weren't previously aware of, but you need to stop trying to find reasons to make it ok.


He needs therapy.

Also you, because you're being delusional.

Question: how old do you think you look with your petite build? What if he is attracted to you because you look younger?"
