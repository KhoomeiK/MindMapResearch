raisedbynarcissists,ffacvfw,t3_ese2us,1579732559.0,"One response I've found that helps is, ""Yeah she may be my mother. But I'm  also her daughter, and that's never stopped her from treating me like shit. Why should I let the fact that she's my mother stop my from cutting her off like any other toxic person?""

I never asked to be born. That was her call. And as long as she claims me on taxes as a dependent and flaunts her status as a mother, it is her responsibility to take care of me. How well she does that will determin if she stays in my life and I don't give a gorrillas left tit about her blood relation to me. I know it's hard when you're dependent on them and they make it seem like giving you what you need to grow into adulthood is some kind of privilege, but please remember that they signed up for this.

One more time for the people in the back: THEY SIGNED UP FOR THIS!"
AmItheAsshole,ff6vw9e,t1_ff6jvh4,1579635964.0,I concur. Lost so many friends to dumb shit like this in high school and afterwards it stops hurting you. You meet better people.
AmItheAsshole,ff6r6gr,t1_ff6mmh2,1579633166.0,"So in other words you talked to her, she said no, and you ignored her and gave away money that was meant to go towards both of your collective futures anyway? YTA."
AmItheAsshole,ff6phwj,t3_eryoqw,1579632165.0,You realize by staying with this racist prick you're giving him the okay right?
AmItheAsshole,ff6p8fb,t1_ff6omrj,1579632009.0,"To be fair you didnt ""ask"" you verbally abused this child. Wanna know how you traumatize a kid and make them socially anxious? This. This is how you do that. Chill the fuck out, realize this is a child, and use your words in a nonabusive way."
AmItheAsshole,ff6oh2w,t3_erys7l,1579631550.0,"NTA. I think she does need proffessional help, and its not on you to be her emotional support animal. If its getting in the way of you living a good life its understandable."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff5yvgn,t3_eroke7,1579614658.0,"I don't see anyone bringing this up so I will, in America pretty sure it doesnt matter where you are, if you are 18 and parents are withholding paperwork like this the police can be made to get involved. Whcih sounds like something that should have been done ages ago considering the neglect."
abusiverelationships,fekxabj,t1_fekx5ff,1579209513.0,Cats are good replacements for assholes. Though to be fair they can be assholes too.... But cats are still better.
abusiverelationships,fekibmw,t1_fejlyws,1579200638.0,I suggest getting your own cat and taking care of them in his place. At least the cat is more likely to appreciate it.
raisedbynarcissists,fej7eri,t1_fej7de2,1579160035.0,"understandable. Well I wish you all the best, and please remember there is better out there!"

JUSTNOFAMILY,fdkn8hh,t3_elktd4,1578507085.0,"I've been there before. And right now I'm going to tell you something I wish was said to me when I told my mother I got my first job: IM SO FUCKING PROUD OF YOU! You are making your way in this world and there is nothing quite as scary, and exhilarating as that. This job is a step in the right direction and I'm glad you chose to take it. I'm excited to see what you do with this opportunity.üíñüíñüíñ"

JUSTNOMIL,fdjdoaf,t1_fdjdj9a,1578466510.0,My sister is an army recruit so she's getting paid enough that if I ask she'll definitely try to help. Ive tried the student loan route but without a cosigner it seems impossible due to my lack of credit history.
JUSTNOMIL,fdjdhxe,t1_fdjddgn,1578466314.0,It is. I'm throwing everything I've got at this situation to fix this but theres only so much I can do. I refuse to let this be the reason I drop out though.
JUSTNOMIL,fdjd9of,t1_fdjd6vg,1578466070.0,"Thats definitely the plan. Ive applied for summer housing and I'm looking for jobs off campus so that I can affored to stay out of her grasp, but then things like this happen. Its... Hard, to say the least."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjd4xn,t1_fdjcz0j,1578465929.0,However I am considering working on getting her on board with just sending the miney to my bank account each month and letting me keep my paycheck so I can pay on my own.
JUSTNOMIL,fdjd1yu,t1_fdjcz0j,1578465842.0,"Partly guilt, partly because I know that if I stopped she would cease all payments to my school and leave me homeless and stranded in a city where I know no one."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjcb3x,t1_fdjc1u8,1578465071.0,"Ive been applying since last month but I will definitely take your advice. Ive been meaning to look up more scholarships anyway, and maybe they'll know some that aren't as popular or well known"
JUSTNOMIL,fdjbx7u,t1_fdjbr2x,1578464681.0,"Thank you. I've texted my sister asking for help and I will call her, and my dad, to explain more tomorrow. I guess I'll just add this to the list of things I will never do to my future children."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjbiqo,t1_fdjaw2c,1578464280.0,"You dont know me, or my life. Not enough to make a comment like this. I'm 18 years old, socially stunted, and still trying to figure out how to survive. Frankly I cant do it on my own. If I leave this school, even to transfer, I will be thrown onto the streets. You try battling homelessness with no way to move forward and better yourself, and no one to depend on."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjait4,t1_fdjad99,1578463299.0,Thank you. I've been really struggling trying to keep my head above water and that comment really didn't help.
JUSTNOMIL,fdj9zz1,t1_fdj9nd1,1578462815.0,"As long as she claims me on her taxes and claims the name mother, its her responsibility. Again, it was between going to college and living on the streets. I did not ask to be born, again that was HER call. So yeah I consider this as something she owes me consudering the fact that she chose to birth me, fucked my mental health, did her damn hardest to keep me financially dependent on her, carted me off to other family members my entire childhood instead of stepping the fuck up, and continuously making stupid ass, selfish ass decisions that have interfered with the well being of all her children. If she's going to make me go to college you can bet your pretty petunia she's going to be the one kicking out money for it until I can afford to do so."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fdbga7h,t1_fdbfydk,1578257115.0,"Never feel guilt for demanding what's rightfully yours. Easier said than done, I know, but remember that normal parents wouldn't hold onto it without their kids permission in the first place."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdbfpnv,t1_fdba8we,1578256930.0,"By all means, post an update to their response if possible. Your situation is eerily similar to my friends and I'd hope things end well here."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdbf0bp,t3_ekinb2,1578256736.0,Legally you can have police come with you to demand your personal info. Just an FYI. If they are holding your birth certificate hostage you can call the non emergency police line and have someone come to help.

JUSTNOFAMILY,fcm2az6,t1_fck864y,1577762379.0,That is a very bad way of thinking. You and your daughter need to have a conversation about what happened in that house and you need to make it known to her that her mental health is your priority. Dont let her grow to loathe you over this. You are her mom. Protect her.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fclr9yb,t3_ehut39,1577754548.0,"Im cracking up. Its always amusing to see small children put adults in their place when they go too far. And good on you, for teaching her about boundaries and putting an end to the cycle of ignoring bodily autonomy! You are great parents, keep it up!"
AskWomen,fcft07v,t1_fcckvjg,1577633415.0,Very good point. But gay people are more likely to appreciate it.
AskWomen,fcc7nxp,t1_fcc6q2r,1577595314.0,Doesn't make you a bad friend. Just... make sure the amount of effort you put into a relationship is equal to the amount you're getting back.
AskWomen,fcc6hbv,t1_fcc69gw,1577594957.0,"OH I misunderstood, sorry! And sorry about your shitty friend. You deserve better than someone who uses you."
AskWomen,fcbq92x,t1_fcaykwd,1577589771.0,"Stop. It makes you an asshole. No one likes asshole. Except maybe the gays, understandably."
JustNoSO,fc5vqdp,t1_fc5vhq6,1577466925.0,That makes sense I suppose. Just remember that you shouldnt have to drown to keep others afloat though.
JustNoSO,fc5t8jf,t1_fc53ovz,1577465355.0,Is there a reason why you're waiting? I mean personally I wouldnt want to start the new year off with this prepubescent ass wipe but I'd like to know what's stopping you.
