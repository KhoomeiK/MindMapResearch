Animesuggest,ff8i5fw,t1_ff8hivm,1579679562.0,What isekai have you watched and liked? Maybe that could help others with recs if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after
Animesuggest,ff8gxwi,t3_es7w0o,1579678005.0,I watched all of the first season and sometimes rewatch it. But I like cutesy world building stuff so . Gave up in season 2 cause things were starting to get too complicated for me to not be anxious about
masskillers,ff8g719,t1_ff844la,1579677057.0,I think about this one all the time just because of the time factor. Like I watched the take down video expecting the number of casualties to be like 5 so to see that many compared to the time and what would‚Äôve happened if it hadn‚Äôt been cut short is insane to me.
StardewValley,ff4nsb1,t1_ff4matm,1579568108.0,Ah yes you‚Äôre right good idea. Basically I just checked the calendar everyday to see who‚Äôs birthday was coming up then headed to the saloon to check out the specials. 4/5 times I tried at least one of their loved meals was being sold. But maybe there‚Äôs a higher frequency of some loved meals across the characters? Like chocolate cake was one. But for Elliot it was Tom kha which I think only he and Leah like? So I dunnoooo
StardewValley,ff2p0um,t1_ff2ogad,1579517220.0,I honestly have another tip and I‚Äôm too scared to share it until it‚Äôs been thoroughly investigated through 3 double blind randomised control trials üò≠

StardewValley,ff29tf5,t1_ff29hx9,1579498075.0,Oh heckers. See edit 2.
StardewValley,ff28kfp,t1_ff27vfa,1579496955.0,"I‚Äôm definitely gonna have to test it I just noticed it with four birthdays so far, so as you say it could just be random. Plus when I went to the saloon the actual day before abigails birthday I found fish taco but the day before that was chocolate cake. I was super excited and posted this without fully researching it first my bad but I‚Äôll def update!"
StardewValley,ff27mfa,t1_ff27lb2,1579496134.0,Hahaha no he had chocolate cake !

masskillers,fdlu8ds,t3_elzs0v,1578532612.0,"There was one of these on the log in page we used to check our enrolled classes, gpa, etc at my college. Now living in aus that‚Äôs usually something I tell people to help them realise how normalised mass shootings are in the states."
slp,fdj7koz,t3_eleua6,1578460696.0,I think there are other things involved like choosing later developing sounds first vs earlier or choosing sounds that aren‚Äôt stimulable. Basically goes against ‚Äútraditional‚Äù goal choosing. Caroline Bowen‚Äôs website may have more info

ADHD,fcq4mf1,t1_fcq2n5u,1577878598.0,Maybe we have awesome facial recognition skills? I recognised nick Jonas from his eyebrows only in jumanji. And also another guy I met through a friend once I recognised from two stories up and said hey isn‚Äôt that? And she was like holy fuck I can‚Äôt believe you knew that was him.
ADHD,fcq45ik,t3_eiftws,1577878319.0,Today I thought about how p.sherman (finding nemo dentist) shouldn‚Äôt give his niece anymore fish if he really loves them as much as he claims to because she keeps killing them. And then my friends were like wow that‚Äôs such a random thought because we were cleaning up our air bnb when I voiced this realisation. And I tried to justify it by saying oh it‚Äôs cause of...and then I couldn‚Äôt remember what thought or word led me to it while I was in the kitchen. So. I relate so hard. Good work if you managed to read this whole comment instead of noping our when you saw how long it was. But I also bet you only read the first and last sentences. I‚Äôm on to you!
BDSMAdvice,fcbopbw,t3_egtiaf,1577589283.0,Age regression and age play are not the same thing. Have a listen to the candy kinkdom episode 16 to gain further insight.
