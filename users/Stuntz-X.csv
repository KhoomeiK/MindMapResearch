My point is if we get taxed make sure the majority of that is taxed to benefit the people not others.   
everyone cant be at the top everyone cant earn tons its impossible no matter how much ambition people have everyone cannot earn millions. 

This ideology may have worked 80 years ago its changed so much the entire system is rigged to move the majority of revenue to the top not to the workers.  all companies sending the hard work people do all to the top.  My guess is most of those people at the top did not all get there by hard work and dedication.

A persons defense cannot be  """"They dont like me so they are trying to impeach me.""

Libertarian,fejpua3,t1_fejojm4,1579182761.0,my point is everyone cannot. If you created a perfect society that made nothing but innovators/entrepreneurs they all cannot be successful.  You cant have everyone get a well paying job regardless of ability. There are not enough jobs. There are not enough things to innovate there are not enough things to create and sell.   Its just the way it is right now. My point is more about being taxed.  No one wants to be taxed because they need that money to survive.   Not having money to eat or have shelter or get your broken leg fixed pf course you dont want to be taxed you have to go and pay healthcare. most people are not well off the majority are pretty shitty place no matter how many jobs they work and they mostly are just scrapping by to survive.      Innovators entrepreneurs let me know how you can have a system where that is what everyone does and no one does the jobs to make that happen.  The majority of people are workers. its not crazy to think people would not be so mad if their taxes benefit them.  Tax me all you want just make sure my taxes goto the people. Healthcare education mainly.
Libertarian,fejon1s,t3_epjd7i,1579181777.0,it bothers me how much evidence is out there against Trump and how many really never look at it or flat out deny it.

Libertarian,fejnt56,t3_epj0du,1579181066.0,"Marginal Tax rates dont work that way and the majority of people wouldnt even come close to earning that much to make that effect.  

Everyone cant be a CEO or a manager it is impossible. work harder? how there are not enough jobs.   everyone cant make 200k a year its impossible. 
So in reality it is not how hard you work. There are other factors at play location, contacts, overall luck in promotions. Your healthcare is based on what job you have or their retirement plan im guessing the bottom tier workers are not getting the best plans.  

If taxes went to the well being of people - health care, Food, Housing,   Then in reality it wouldn't or shouldn't matter.   Your money goes to these things no matter what. Are you not going to eat? Not going to get care? not live in shelter?    So if i am taxed these things i have no problem with them add in education because we don't need stupid people.   

Then it doesn't matter what job you have as long as you have a job. The money you have left over is for anything else.  The people on the top still going to make proportionately the same as the bottom so whats the difference? 

If we have every human in the US work to the max potential they all wont ever be top earners. Even if you are equally or better qualified they will still be stuck at the bottom/middle."
