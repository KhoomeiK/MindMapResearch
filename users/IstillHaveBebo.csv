Owners of the clubs have enough money to inject into the clubs through group structures or directors loan accounts. They can afford to put money into the club but the EFL restrict that.

What it is, is the biggest load of shite from the EFL.

They basically put in their business plan that we have to sell Che Adams in January (No other club in history has been told to sell players by the EFL). We were offered £8m by Fulham which we turned down, we then sold for £15m in the Summer.

We made nearly double on him and stayed up because of his goals.  Why is there any issue? Other than we didn't follow how the EFL 'thought' we should run the club rather than actually listening to financial advisors who have the clubs best interests at heart."
