Certainly, it wasn't a scene for scene movie version of the game, but I think they didn't excellent job of capturing the Silent Hill feel, even for all of its faults and the overuse of the Pyramid Head. it felt like it could be a Silent Hill game to me, like if they made a game version of that movie it wouldn't be terrible.

There's a company called Fell Knives that he worked with to do a sort of reproduction, but they are sold out too."
chefknives,ff67fw4,t1_ff61fkf,1579620928.0,"Yeah, the description reads like it was written by someone who's selling it for someone else and doesn't actually know anything about knives.  Which isn't too helpful for me when I don't really know anything about knives.  

I really really want a knife of this shape, that has some heft to it. I currently have a cheap cleaver that I purchased for about 15 bucks to see if I would be able to use that type of knife as a daily driver.  I love it, and I'm ready to buy something knice that sharpens well, but I'm a little overwhelmed by all the options.  The reviews on Amazon are worthless these days, but in addition to this I found a few other options that I'm interested in.  

I'm cooking from a wheelchair, so the angle is weird for me as I have to use my full reach and the counters are just below mid chest.  That's why I want something with some solid heft but not exactly a rectangle like my current cleaver. I want to be able to use it for vegetables and light meat work.  I mostly don't want to spend a bunch of money and end up with something I can't keep sharp.  For me, $50 to $100 is ideal, but also expensive for my budget.

My ideal world would be a cleaver like this, something serrated,and a paring knife and that's all, so then I can get rid of all my other knives. I'm basically trying to minimalize my kitchen, so that cleaning it's not such a bitch, because I'm handicapped and don't always have the wherewithal to clean every single day, and I get behind. basically if I miss a few days of cleaning up after dinner, I don't want to have a million things in my kitchen to wash LOL.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

That was a lot.  If you read all the way to the end, I say thank you!"

NintendoSwitch,fev4quy,t1_feuycjs,1579393060.0,"I'm talking about how the launch price of the system may have fit into an overall strategy of selling the Switch to people who already own something else. The Xbox One launched at $500, the PlayStation at $400, and the Switch at $300, from a quick Google search. A lot of people don't consider the lifetime *cost* of a system or how much games are going to cost in 2 years. They buy things one pay day at a time.  At $300, (and $200 now for the Nintendo Switch Lite), it's easier to buy into the Nintendo system when you already have something else, and it strengthens the position of a product that Nintendo wants people to consider purchasing without taking their other consoles or gaming PC into account.  When you already own an Xbox or Playstation or both,  $200 or $300 for a brand new Switch is a much easier pill to swallow than $400 or $500.  The Xbox One and the PS4 were released significantly sooner than the Switch - that $300 price point was very important in a market that already had large install bases of Xboxes and PlayStations.  If Nintendo had released a powerhouse system in 2017 at $4-500, they would have been competing with the Xbox One X and the PlayStation 4 Pro, directly. By releasing this hybrid system at $300, they were able to dive directly into a market regardless of what everybody else already had, as well as capturing new sales from non console owners and building momentum with lower specs and cheaper components.  Overall I don't think it's all about any one thing, I just think that either through providence or  genius (probably both), they really nailed it this round, and pricing is a big part of that."
cars,feupz49,t3_eojexg,1579388905.0,"Hey peeps. I have a car that has been sitting out all winter, and the battery is dead.  I live in cold country, and we are in negative temps right now. there's really nothing wrong with the car it was perfectly fine, and I was driving it, I parked it one day and started driving my other car, and then a bunch of shit happened and it's just been sitting there for months.

anyways the battery is dead, I need to move my car, I tried to jump start the battery yesterday, and we sat there with it hooked up to my other car for a good hour and I never got past the click click click stage where the interior lights work and nothing else. It sounded like it kind of wanted to turn over. But barely, just barely at all. Just a hint, and I could be wrong about that. 

Would it be in my best interest to just get a new battery, or would I be able to get away with buying a trickle charger and putting it on the battery overnight? I don't want to buy a trickle charger and then still have to get a new battery, and likewise I don't want to get a new battery if a trickle charger would do the job because I'm extremely limited on funds.

NintendoSwitch,feqbzz0,t3_eqc6sx,1579340004.0,"Nintendo's strategy isn't to directly compete with Sony and MS anymore, and it hasn't been that for a while now.  They want to be a product that you'll buy regardless if whether or not you already own another platform. 

Almost half of all Switch owners own another console or PC. They've made great strides in that direction through hardware innovation, world-class first party IPs, and by keeping the prices down. 

I'm not wording this well, but I think they want potential buyers to stop thinking ""should I get a PlayStation or a Switch?"" and start just thinking ""should I get a Switch?"" without other platforms even being part of that decision, because the Nintendo platform is in a category of its own."
