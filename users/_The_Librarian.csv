They are a goliath barbarian and a halfling rogue. They are dragon hunters but can't seem to find any dragons.

The barbarian carries the halfling around on his shoulders and they go around helping people with various things."
AskGameMasters,few8dh2,t1_feviszt,1579406839.0,"There is no need for in-depth backstory, especially in the first few sessions unless everyone wants to be bored as hell while they wait their turn for their own exposition speech."
AskGameMasters,fev00xk,t1_feup5vv,1579391622.0,That's what Session 0 is partly about. Shouldn't start a D&D game without that.
AskGameMasters,feunkwa,t3_eql4y5,1579388277.0,"Yo, set a date. This is how I got my friends to start playing:

DMAcademy,fefk0xz,t3_eojqpx,1579057958.0,"Not sure how it would be written properly, but that post made me think of something like this:

If one of their allies goes down within 60ft, town guards can blow into a whistle as a reaction. They must have a free hand. If they are grappled, the grappler can make a DC15 Dexterity saving throw to grab the arm with the whistle."

DnD,fe58ja5,t1_fe51yj6,1578866589.0,"I did that last Xmas during a one shot. I said before the game that for this session I will not pull punches, or be nice about what happens to your one shot character.

The game ended half way through when they all failed a DC10Dex roll to escape a closing wall trap. It was basically: Those that succeed pull those that don't succeed out before the trap shuts. Highest roll out of 3 players was 6.

Before I said anything they all started to pretend to be crushed by the walls, so we played Dungeon Mayhem for the rest of the night."

AskReddit,fdmmz6z,t3_em2vfz,1578556181.0,Every morning between 6 and 6.30 we would kneel down on our hard threadbare carpet floor while our parents sat on a comfortable couch in front of us. We would pray for the whole half hour while they sat there making sure we were doing it right. Staying at my friends house for the first time was a revelation.

This movie, and 'War and Peace', cemented my opinion that war is the ultimate stupidity. It's annoying that it's so necessary for things like defending yourself against a totalitarian aggressor, or freeing slaves, or rescuing a city from a horde of barbarians."
