The problem was that it never actually worked - they got some planet geology/topology stuff to work, but not the rest, and it was apparently really boring (because procedurally generated stuff is not hand-crafted, and procedurally creating stories is beyond us, and story is key to RPGs). So eventually people realized it wasn't going to work and they ended up making what became MEA in, again, less than two years at the very end of development; while they were able to salvage some assets from the procedural work, a lot of the actual game was put together as the deadline loomed and what they'd been working on previously didn't pan out at all."

gaming,ff9pljk,t3_esb5p2,1579718104.0,"The ""link"" between gambling addiction and loot boxes is not established at all. The claim comes entirely from an online survey *on Reddit*, where the person said what result they wanted, and the survey participants were self-selected. It wasn't anything even approximating science.

There's zero evidence of any link, and indeed, I severely doubt there is a *causal* link - that is to say, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that loot boxes would *cause* problem gambling.

Problem gambling itself is a form of impulse control disorder, so it wouldn't be surprising if people who were problem gamblers (or drug addicts, or criminals) were more likely to open loot boxes. But this isn't because loot boxes cause those things, but rather because they all have the same underlying root cause - poor impulse control. Poor impulse control leads to all sorts of negative consequences, which is why all of these things have high rates of comorbidity - if you have poor impulse control, you're more likely to abuse drugs, you're more likely to gamble irresponsibly, you're more likely to commit a crime because it seemed like a good idea at the time, ect.

There's no reason to believe that loot boxes would create impulse control problems, and indeed, [casino revenues](https://www.thecentersquare.com/louisiana/analysis-louisiana-casino-industry-decline-raises-concerns/article_102af960-af30-11e9-aa02-2ba983199753.html) [may be declining.](https://www.cdcgamingreports.com/nevadas-casino-industry-experiences-a-revenue-decline-for-the-third-straight-month/) This is often attributed to [young people being less interested in gambling.](https://www.cleveland.com/casino/2016/09/millennials_not_interested_in.html) In fact, one study found that millenials were half as interested in gambling as older age groups.

gaming,ff7p0yy,t1_ff7e52s,1579654860.0,"> Rushing

The games weren't rushed.

Bioware is just incompetent.

Anthem started development after Mass Effect 3 was finished, so circa 2012.

It came out in 2019.

That's *7 years* of development time.

Mass Effect Andromeda was in development for about 5 years.

Neither game was rushed in the sense that they didn't have enough time.

They were rushed because Bioware's staff is incompetent.

In the case of MEA, they decided to reinvent the wheel and redo a ton of dev work done by the Dragon Age Inquisition people - and then the Anthem people did the same thing with the MEA stuff.

But the Anthem people spent years procrastinating on making important decisions. They didn't decide on what the game was actually going to be until 2017. They spent years tinkering around with stuff that didn't even end up in the game, like changing seasons in an environment. They would have meetings to decide on stuff, and then not decide on stuff.

The problem wasn't that they didn't have enough time.

The problem was that they were incompetent.

The reason there was a ""rush"" was because at the end, when they were a couple years out and actually had to show stuff, they actually had to start making decisions, and as such, everything in the game had to be made after that point because up to that point, they made no decisions and so just didn't have anything put together.

They wasted their time.

This isn't a board problem, unless you think that the board should be micromanaging staff.

In fact, the only reason why Anthem even had flying - which is, I'll note, it's major selling point - was because of a member of the executive staff recognizing that the game needed an actual selling point and it was really cool.

This was not a problem with the top of the company, but with Bioware itself. Bioware's teams had a long tradition of scrambling at the end of development and sticking stuff together and having it all work out. They called it the Bioware magic.

But it was obvious as early as Mass Effect 3 that this was resulting in major problems. And it just got worse over time.

It's just not possible to make a modern-day AAA game in that fashion. And Bioware has now learned that lesson, painfully and repeatedly.

During Anthem's early development, Anthem's team had the highest internal happiness ratings of any part of EA. This was while, I'll note, they were accomplishing absolutely nothing of value whatsoever.

Their morale went to crap when they actually had to get stuff done.

I have no sympathy.

They screwed around and did not make decisions, and the result was a game that, on release, was riddled with bugs and was not the sort of expansive experience that people were expecting.

I am not optimistic about Bioware, because they've been doing this for years and years now, and it is catching up to them very painfully. It's obvious that they have a very poor process, and it has been showing in their games."

ME3 and MEA both had live service components, and in fact, the multiplayer was the best part of MEA.

The reason why they made Anthem was that they wanted to do something different from what they'd done before because they'd gotten bored making traditional RPGs for so long, doing the same thing over and over again. Remember that they'd been making the Mass Effect series for like 8 years at that point. So they decided to do something completely different and make a more action-based multiplayer third person shooter with story elements and decisions matter (though the Mass Effect games had already been heading in that direction, they went much more extreme).

They were very ambitious, which is why the game never went anywhere; they kept adding and removing features and tinkering with stuff rather than committing to anything. It was only when they made their first vertical slice - and it was absolutely godawful, and less than two years from the projected release - that the higher-ups realized what hot garbage the team had been producing.

It was at that point that they ended up revamping the game to avoid it being cancelled (and maybe a bunch of them losing their jobs for spending five years durdling around doing nothing of value), and they added in flying around in iron man suits (something they'd added/removed several times previously) which was the best thing about the game and gave it actual novelty value.

MagicArena,ff4pmhe,t1_ff4oxf0,1579569402.0,"I'd rather have Elspeth in that situation, because if you get swept in that situation, you're likely out of the game if you just played out two more creatures, whereas with Elspeth, you can easily rebuild the next turn and are much more likely to be able to turn Heliod back on."
4Xgaming,ff4oyva,t1_fendtzy,1579568944.0,"Magic has a lot of variance, but decks are built to deal with it. A lot of decks either involve a lot of redundancy or things like card draw/filtering to manipulate your ""luck"".

Less than 10% of games are determined by mana issues. The main things that determine most games are tempo and card advantage.

For those not familiar, tempo is basically a board position thing (for instance, one player has out three creatures, while the other has out none; they have a large tempo advantage, but if the opponent then casts a ""sweeper spell"" that kills all creatures in play, that advantage is reset) while card advantage is basically how many cards (or similar resources, like token creatures) a player has in play and in their hand.

A big part of why Magic has comebacks is because your life total is independent of these factors; in-game, being at 20 life and being at 1 life is exactly the same, unless you have cards that trade off life for some sort of advantage. As a result, most of the time, being at 1 life, while it puts you in a *precarious* situation, doesn't actually stop you from winning; you can still take control of the board and then beat the opponent down.

Indeed, a lot of control vs aggro matchups have the aggro deck try to turn an early game tempo advantage into a win, while the control player tries to ""stabilize"" by killing out creatures or playing defenses that render them moot, and then playing out stronger late-game cards that swing the game back in their advantage so they win crushingly, despite the fact that they might have been reduced to only a few life points in the early game.

As such, even though your opponent might be beating on you, it doesn't stop you from counterattacking.

The reason why 4X games don't have this is because they lack these sorts of alternative resources. If you attack someone else's cities, you're not only taking away their ""life points"" (the thing that determines whether or not they lose, as losing all your cities is game over), but you're also taking away their ability to fight back.

In Magic, if you blow up my creatures, I'm at a disadvantage, but that doesn't affect my life total directly at all. And likewise, if you are beating on me with your creatures, that doesn't stop me from casting a spell next turn that can help me swing the game back in my favor.

It is the fact that there is no independent ""life total"" that makes 4X games work the way they do - 4X games are very slippery slope, because taking someone's city not only puts them closer to defeat, but also makes them less able to fight back."

This is one of the great flaws of games like Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night - it encourages the player to play it in a very unfun way.

DOOM's glory kill system and other features encourage the player to move around constantly and get up close and fight, which makes DOOM way more fun to play than Call of Duty."
truegaming,ff4h8if,t3_equ4y5,1579563551.0,"You fundamentally understand neither pyramid schemes nor Elo/MMR systems.

Indeed, most MMR systems for video games don't actually require equal gains/losses amongst opposing teams, especially not in early games, where your MMR is often fluctuating wildly match to match as the game tries to put you in the right level.

MMR systems have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with pyramid schemes; the two things are fundamentally different and exist for entirely different purposes.

MMR systems exist for the purpose of determining how good (or bad) a player is, and putting them at the appropriate level. As players get better (and sometimes worse) over time, and there is no ""absolute"" measure of skill, rather they use relative rankings against other players to determine where a player is on the scale. The goal of this is to ensure that players have relatively equal matches, as players tend to have the most fun while playing with people of relatively equal skill - close games are more fun than crushing people repeatedly (which can get boring) or being crushed repeatedly (which can get frustrating).

Pyramid schemes are money-making schemes and are a form of fraud.

The two have entirely different purposes and functions, and have nothing in common. MMR systems don't require new players to function, while pyramid schemes are entirely contingent on new suckers for their growth.

Also, playing games for 8+ hours has nothing to do with video game addiction. WHO is kind of worthless when it comes to such things anyway, but the defintion of ""video game addiction"" (which isn't actually a thing, FYI) is when playing video games interferes with your ordinary life tasks. A professional player is being paid for playing; playing video games is *work* for them. Playing video games all day for money is not addiction, it's a profession.

""Video game addiction"" is not a real thing anyway; there *are* people who play too many video games, but playing video games is not the root cause of their problem, but a *symptom*. Their actual problem is mostly poor conscientiousness, which manifests itself in a number of unfortunate ways - obsessive behavior that isn't very useful, but which gives momentary gratification, while disregarding more important things in life. Frequently, taking away one vice from such people doesn't actually fix their problem; I've seen many obsessive video game players instead start obsessing over social media or websites when video games were taken away from them or they temporarily ""swore them off"", as the real problem was not the video games, but their own lack of self control. Impulse control disorders can manifest themselves in a number of different ways, from drugs to gambling to video games to obsessive use of social media websites.

Other people are instead suffering from depression or anxiety, and are using video games as an outlet for that instead - basically, it's a way of hiding away from the world/not interacting with other people/only interacting with people in a ""safe space"". Some other mental illnesses and personality disorders can also cause seemingly obsessive or compulsive video game playing.

The whole idea of ""video game addiction"" is pretty flawed; it's confusing a symptom with a root cause. Taking video games away from people who obsessively/compulsively play them *can* be useful, but only if you address the underlying problem."

1) This is extremely common and won't be solved by this at all. It's just people overreaching, which happens all the time, no matter what.

2) You're eliminating confounding variables by controlling for sex, not adding them. Preemptively excluding male or female subjects from your study is the exact opposite of the blue M&M issue, where you try and find some subgroup with a significant effect. It does not make this problem worse. In fact, including subjects of both genders and then retroactively looking at sex differences is an example of this sort of problematic subgroup analysis.

3) Making crappy results even crappier makes lack of replication even worse. Moreover, if the study is never replicated, it probably doesn't actually matter very much, and is probably a bullshit study. Actually important areas of research are much more likely to have overlapping studies and replication, whereas unimportant effects are not, but it doesn't matter, because the effect isn't actually important. Most psychology studies are worthless to begin with, so it's not really a big deal that they're not replicated because they weren't even worth spending the money doing once in a lot of cases. If you're hinging something important on a single psychology study, the problem isn't the study, it's you assigning far too much weight to a single (often questionable) experiment.

4) If every study is applying the same controls, that's a good thing, as it makes it easier to compare results.

Trying to find a cohort of very similar individuals is very useful for applying controls, and failing to do so is a great way to end up with a garbage study and false experimental effects - the exact opposite of what we want.

The problem is not ""we shouldn't exclude people of group X from studies"". The problem is that if we do a study in group Z, we should make sure it applies to groups X and Y as well if it is actually important.

Okay, just going to stop you here.

There's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that ordinary crops are safe. For all we know, tomatoes could cause cancer. It's never been extensively studied because we simply assume that the food is safe.

All plants, however, contain numerous known and suspected carcinogens, albeit in very low quantities. These exist as natural pesticides, among other things, and are present in absolutely everything you eat.

If some random food gives you a 5-10% higher chance of cancer, we'd likely never know.

And indeed, it's actually known that conventional breeding increases the prevalence of these chemicals much more than making GMOs does, because by crossbreeding different strains you end up mixing the genes that produce these things and thus, often end up with them being at a higher activity level.

So GMOs are actually *safer* than other plants in this regard, and in fact, are pretty much the only agricultural product to undergo testing as to whether or not the product itself is safe (as opposed to issues with contamination)."

Privacy. Same reason why we don't disclose a lot of personal information.

Anyone who has worked for the government and had to deal with private information knows that said information must be carefully stored, not accessed without good reason, and, in many cases, should simply be destroyed unless the government actually has a reason to keep the information in question. It's why we delete a lot of old police cam video that isn't related to any crime - beyond the fact that it would cost money to store, it would also record a bunch of people going about their lives who did nothing wrong and just had a police car drive by at some point.

It's pretty obvious if you think about it.

Stuff like security footage *shouldn't* be made available to the public unless there's an actual reason for it, and your personal curiosity is not good enough. If there isn't, then we should respect the privacy of the people in question and not release it.

It's because the coastal kingdoms there were happy to enslave people from further inland and sell them to the Europeans. Indeed, the Europeans giving them guns and other advanced equipment made it much easier for them to successfully enslave other Africans, who lacked it.

The Europeans had largely abolished slavery centuries before, but ended up enslaving Africans (and briefly Native Americans, though that didn't end up going so well) because they needed manpower and they were convenient. They didn't have to do the work of capturing most of the African slaves; it was a lot easier to buy them from other Africans and then ship them off to the New World.

Indeed, this was pretty standard. The Spanish used native people in Mesoamerica to rule over other native people. And in the Congo Free State, almost all of the atrocities were actually committed by Africans, not the Belgians themselves, because there were only a tiny number of Belgians there in the first place - the Belgians basically armed groups of Africans (often groups which were hostile towards other groups they were ruling over) and used them to enforce their will, and the people the Belgians employed were absolutely brutal."

It's dangerous to climb Everest, but with all the stuff that's installed up there now, the actual technical climbing aspects aren't that hard.

The hard part is the hypoxia, the cold, and, if you're stupid, the weather. And hypoxia can harm your judgement, and thus, make it more likely for you to make dumb decisions that get you killed, like climbing when the weather is questionable, in an area where if you get stuck, you *will* die, because there isn't enough oxygen up there to sustain human life.

It's probably a little more dangerous to climb the mountain as a rando vegan, because vegans tend to have lower blood-iron levels than omnivores do, and having a lower blood-iron level is bad when you need every bit of oxygen you can get. But people who climb Everest aren't typically rando vegans.

That being said, saying ""I'm going to climb all these mountains to prove vegans can do anything!"" really is just asking for it if something bad happens. And the more tall mountains you climb, the greater the likelihood of something bad happening sooner or later, which will of course generate the ironic headline that we all crave.

Incidentally, one reason why the fatality rate hasn't gone down in several decades is because more people are doing it. It's safer than ever before, but that means that people who are less and less fit to climb the mountain are going there to do it. If only the best climbers in the world climbed Everest, the fatality rate would have gone down, but there's a lot of people who pay to get taken up that mountain who really shouldn't be up there, and so some of those people die.

Not that experienced climbers can't die on the mountain (they can, and do), but idiots who shouldn't be up there getting themselves killed certainly contributes to the fatality rate. It's very misleading to suggest that the fatality rate hasn't declined; it actually has come down quite a bit since a lot of tourists started going up there. It was over 2% back in the 1970s and 1980s. The people who climbed the mountain back in the 1950s actually knew what they were doing, so weren't really representative of the quality of modern climbers."

Most of the Americans were still in the Stone Age and lacked writing, with the Aztec and Inca being in the early Bronze Age. Much of Sub-Saharan Africa was in the Iron Age, but again, most of it lacked writing. Both civilizations continued to practice slavery, which had been largely abolished in Europe.

Meanwhile, the Aboriginal Australians were hunter-gatherers who were tens of thousands of years behind the rest of the world technologically.

It's not surprising that the Europeans considered them to be primitive, because from their point of view, they were.

It should also be remembered that the Europeans were Christians, and one of the aspects of Christianity was the abolition of animal and human sacrifices. Such practices were associated with ancient civilizations, before the spread of Christianity, and so when they went out into the world, they encountered a lot of civilizations that still practiced such things - the Mesoamericans practiced human sacrifice, and in fact, one of the reasons why a bunch of Native Americans sided with the Spanish against the Aztecs was because of how many people they captured from other city-states to sacrifice to their gods.

2) The level design was bad. Almost all of the levels committed the cardinal sin of basically just having a bunch of stuff stuck around in the levels rather than actually feeling like a coherent whole. Only the first two levels - the jungle/ruins world and the ice world - had reasonable design, and neither of them blew me away. The rest of them felt like amusement park design - a bunch of isolated elements stuck around the level that didn't really interconnect and build on each other.

But the swamp level wasn't very good, either, and while it was less transparent about it, it still had the same serious flaw. That really left only the ice level (which I thought was kind of mediocre - not bad, but not great) and the ruins/jungle level (which was... okay), which isn't really where you want to be as a game, and both of those had ""theme park attraction"" type issues as well, they just weren't as severe.

I also just didn't care much for the characters in the game - it felt like it leaned way too heavily on the fourth wall for its humor, and I never really ended up caring about anyone or anything in the game.
