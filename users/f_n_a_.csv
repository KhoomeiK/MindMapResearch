It’s believed the quakes could go on for weeks and maybe months, still a very real possibility of another similar or even larger sized quake.  I’ve heard of a lot of folks going stateside to stay with family, I’m sure many will stay.  But to add to that, this is normally peak tourist season but even the more popular destinations are relative ghosts towns, especially in the south.  Aid would relieve but a small chunk of the financial burdens ahead of this island."

interestingasfuck,fc91u7t,t1_fc8rvur,1577545671.0,"I read somewhere that they believe these mushrooms may have had a hand in influencing some of the traits we associate with Christmas.  

The psychoactive properties aren’t fully broken down in the body, and so even in urine there are significant amounts still there.  It was normally the tribal leaders who would eat the mushroom, and when they’d urinate (into snow or whatever) others would then ingest that.  Thing is, reindeer also really, really love these mushrooms and can smell them from a considerable distance.  So imagine tripping your ass off, and next thing you know there’s a bunch of reindeer swarming, maybe even *flying* around you...

Also, the red and white coloring of the mushroom is believed to be associated with Santa’s color scheme.
