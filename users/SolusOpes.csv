People always talk about luck, but often fail to realize that amount of work that often comes with supposedly ""getting lucky"".

A friend of mine, in one day, received 22 million dollars. Pretty lucky!

Except I've known him for 30 years. And for 30 years he single mindedly focused on this one event. Maybe it would have happened 20 years ago. Maybe 20 years from now. But he stayed focused, literally every day of his life. And got his payday.

He jokes with people that he's a ""30 year overnight success"". But all people see, and hear about, is his one day windfall. Not what went into it.

Even the guy mentioning connections above. What the hell do you think builds connections? It's work. 
Getting up every day, researching who you need, going to where they are. Pounding on doors until you're let in. Joining things they belong to, even if you can bearly afford it, just to shake hands. That's work."

Hell, you could even build a weighted system based on income.

Doing so would actually give you insight into the behavior as a whole, instead of cherry picked data of a single data set.

Because at the end of the day, you're literally limited it to a single data set (18-23).

Case and point, I W2 245k/year. And I've never bought one. It's not about cost, it's about the fact that I don't suffer from Rash Impulsivity and Sensitivity to Reward. But that input will be omitted from your data.

In short, age isn't your factor. Income is.

But don't remove the unemployed, because your study is the purest definition of impulse control. So an unemployed person who spends what little money they have on lootboxes is very telling data for your thesis. Ergo, a wealthy person not spending money is equally as valuable.

The #1 female player has played the #1 male player on multiple occasions (once just recently), and to date they've never won. As an example, here's [Judit Polgar vs Magnus Carlsen](https://youtu.be/9iAa7WYi9OA). Magnus had no issuss the whole match.

Lots of factors why. At peak levels chess is surprisingly physically demanding. Doctors have tracked caloric burn during intense matches as well as muscle fatigue. And it's far higher than anyone would imagine for two people sitting in a chair.

Players keep regimented work out routines and men tend to have larger muscle mass with which to develop. And assist them through the physical side of it. But that's very incidentally.

Most people agree it comes down to lifestyle. Top male players seem more at ease with the solitary lifestyle of world class chess. Most spend days and weeks essentially by themselves in hotel rooms playing and studying chess. Women tend to be more social and spend more time away from studying chess theory. As an example, Bobby Fischer lived entirely by himself for months with just chess books, a single player chess training board and that's it. He was World Grand Master for a number of years.

But so far there haven't been any women that are in the same class at the top men.

Side note, the Polgar sisters were basically a social experiment. Their father simply decided they'll be world chess champions and gave them kind of a shit life while he forced it on them from birth.

Total Mayhem is thankfully back. It's easily the best game mode. It's fast and insane. 

Low Grav is fun. Slower, but more tactical.

And most people seem to like Mystery Heroes because it's nutty matches and it forces you to practice everyone. 

Unless you're going to do comp, ignore normal QP entirely."

>Speed skydiving is a [skydiving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skydiving) competition in which the goal is to achieve and maintain the highest possible [terminal velocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity). It was developed in the mid [2000s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade\)) and is the fastest non-motorized sport on Earth. The speed, achieved by the human body in [free fall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall), is a function of several factors; including the body's [mass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), orientation, and skin area and texture.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skydiving#cite_note-1) In stable, belly-to-earth position, terminal velocity is about 200 km/h (120 mph). Stable freefall head down position has a terminal speed of 240–290 km/h (around 150–180 mph). Further minimization of [drag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics\)) by streamlining the body allows for speeds in the vicinity of 500 km/h (310 mph)."

GP does **not** stand for General Purpose. The G stood for ""Government"" and the P was a designation that indicated it was a recon car with an 80-inch wheelbase.

The CDC, OECD, and WHO track by demographic (and you can use their sites to sort the data table).

White Americans have a lower firearm related events than France, Canada, and Finland. We're tied with the Czech Republic at 1.7 per 100,000.

Black Americans however have a 19.8 per 100,000 rate.

The US is a very large place, with 350 million people. Using one number to declare ""this is the US"" is very misleading."

I was following this project for YEARS! And then...... Nothing. Dark. All papers and information stopped.

Ergo, it bred my one and only conspiracy theory I believe in.

Water purification system, like a Sawyer.

Fun fact, in the US for liquids, we use ml, oz, pint, liter, gallon. Because I'll be damned if I'm going to learn my height in meters, but we take our drinking seriously enough to use all fom of measurement to accurately convey how much we've drank.

No one cares about copper. At all. For any reason. Cash or bullets. That's your only trade items. Too few people even smoke anymore to consider cigarettes.

The Iranian administration has turned off the internet twice in 12 months in order to crush large uprisings of the Iranian people.

There will be no ground war with Iran.

They can't even afford gas for their ""navy"" (which are just coastal PT boats).

There will be drone strikes and ship fired missile strikes.

The US can degrade the Iranian regional capabilities until their inevitable collapse without any type of ground war.

Zarya for sure.

Junk's strong in suicide missions onto the payload. And his ult is a beast.
