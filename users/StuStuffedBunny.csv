I'd much more likely be thinking of all the relationship stuff.  

>Honestly I think they only really had a problem in season 2 when it was a recurring gag for Sara, which undermined her sexuality and made it into one of the only things people cared about, but they have improved on that IMO.  

I agree, that was somewhat my point.  People didn't like it because it was a silly Kirk thing, but now that she's in a settled relationship it's not annoying.  Just like when they tried to make Nate be a rico suave in the first episode of season 4, that was bad writing.

Yea, Wentworth is gay IRL.  On Legends they write him as a man who happens to be gay and loves Ray.  On the Flash they definitely wrote him as more campy gay.  It actually led to me asking my gay friend questions about representation and he told me there's this big debate in the gay community about if some representation is better than none even if it's super stereotypical and not positive.
