Next with Zora swim the idea was likely to make precision easier since the swim was that fast no matter how you did it so there would be less bonking.

It's a rough argument to claim that just because we weren't around for its release we can't understand what it did for the industry there is a lot to see why it would be in the game alone. From the understanding that new players and old players would have a rough time understanding camera controls so they handed out characters like lakitu for sm64 and nazi for Zelda giving people something to hold on to. But at the same time a lot of its mechanics are outdated now which is why we can't keep saying best of all time and only look at it the time it came out."

unpopularopinion,fdws8qi,t1_fdr85ka,1578761880.0,I don't think you deserved to be downvoteed as badly but I would still disagree the 3ds is kinda the only thing that kept Nintendo afloat for a number of years and on top of that it had one of the greatest game libraries of any system to have released ever. It's size is so it can be portable. For example I find the switch almost too big to bring everywhere even though it is much more portable then a PS4. Idk I like my 3ds even still
unpopularopinion,fdwrs2q,t1_fdrhn06,1578761737.0,"I respectfully disagree, I'd argue the gameplay is smoother and more fun to play. However I'd also argue that the grezzo fucked up when it came to art direction and lighting since the game lost a lot of its somber dulled tones creating an atmosphere of the bleak reality, making it so the game is way to bright and loses its darker quality. This being said I'd still rather play this one over the original. But fair is fair they are pretty much the same game in the end with there own ups and downs pick your favourite for sure my guy."
unpopularopinion,fdwr3cy,t1_fdsupbw,1578761505.0,Of you enjoyed stuff like that then game makers toolkit discussed the nuances of what makes a Zelda dungeon good and has done a lot for most of the games I really reccomend the ones on ocarina to see where the game designers were coming from in a puzzle view point. This being said as much as j genuinely love ocarina if argue it doesn't hold up as well for me personally though I vibe hard with water temple and forest temple they got that good good sweet feels.
unpopularopinion,fdwq5io,t1_fdunv61,1578761318.0,I mean the 3ds remake exists for this kinda problem. Though I'd still argue ocarina isn't the best I enjoy it a lot.

unpopularopinion,fdwnxoc,t3_emt3g3,1578760672.0,"See I tend to think of it in a game by game basis, based on the ones I've played I can guarantee ocarina is extremely over hyped. When they say best of all time it should be able to hold up to today's standards and we can't just look at it when it came out. Just because it was revolutionary at the time doesn't mean it should maintain it legendary status.

I think it's quite fair to dislike the gameplay loop, it's not for everyone. However I like argue that so long as they provide the right information it can be quite fun. Majora's is definitely the one that does this best. In Majora's they really emphasize your priorities and balance time management with the amount of side quests in the game.

2d Zelda however is when I'd start to disagree with it being boring as a whole. Link between worlds would land in my top five. To the point that I learned how to speedrun the game and still okay through it to this day. I'd argue 2d Zelda is stronger in a lot of cases because it's a lot easier to both develop puzzles for and maintain your own aware. Exploration become easier as well since it's a screen by screen basis without it being one large area it's several small ones with things to discover.

My problem when it came to breath of the wild is the game tended to be too big for its own good. Don't get me wrong I loved wandering about in the world but I always found that without me finding something to do the game never provided much to do. People claim the world is busy and filled to the brim but 900 koroks are not what I'd call fun.

Windwaker is a strong example of both a good and a bad Zelda game. The art style is fun with strong puzzle design and from a speedrunners perspective is incredibly interesting. But the world exploration can be annoying and a pain in the ass with its constant changing of the wind direction it just doesn't know when to quite.

I love the Zelda series, it's one of my favourites it's not on the top of my list but I definitely like its core gameplay loop. I joined this sub Reddit because I was hoping to post my personal opinions on ocarina but since your here I may as well do it in here and who knows maybe one day I'll post my own full complaints in a post of my own but for now this will do.

 However if your looking for more recent I can always reccomend demon Slayer kimetsu no yaiba I specify because there is a harem show by the name of just demon Slayer. 

I'd still reccomend Noragami and my hero academia as well but this is all stuff I've actually seen. I have not seen death note so I can't really say much about that. I can also say ""your name"" is pretty well written and a blast to watch with strong characters and animation and it being a movie will make it less of a time commitment.

The only thing I would really change is really enforcing the drunk driving rate by getting the bouncers are bartenders to confirm how the customers are getting home by either designated driver or if he will be calling them a taxi.

It's borderline abusive to tell a victim he is wrong for not forgiving him. Had the situations been more sever like a full blown criminal were to be in the same situation like say a rapist and their victim found out they were dieing then we wouldn't bat an eye at their emotional trauma and yet because they're kids and the situations aren't as extreme a lot of people see this as salt in the wound when in reality he was reaping what he sowed.

The group ended up being people who either thought I sucked or bullied me relentlessly. In the end I did the entire project myself the whole thing. By the time we did presentations I'd had a follow up appointment the same day... A week later the teacher calls our group up to the front and says ""I've been informed by the rest of your group that you didn't participate enough in the project"". I spent a great deal of time making this project and in the end she wouldn't believe I had done anything because it was three against one. After all that she turns to those three and gave them the power to say whether or not I was to get a passing grade. She asked them if I was going to get to pass. In the end they had a 98 on the project I made while I recieved flat passing of 50. And this was just one example if the bullshit I was made to deal with that year alongside all the bullying. Idk teachers tend to be assholes and are largely focused on believing the majority. This all happened because I wasn't there to pick a group or for the presentation.

sololeveling,fcspzai,t1_fcrbda2,1577922174.0,"See I like it particularly because it's going to be a brutal reminder that Jin woo is the alpha male. He will be the one to single handedly take down the s rank gate then be after them if he so chooses making him unbeatable. Idk I'm really excited

Edit: I won't be editing anything just kinda re read my exhausted state ramblings, alpha male just sounded weird to me when I re read it."

exmormon,fcb3fv9,t3_egun85,1577581827.0,I wish it weren't such prevalent thing to push the mission. Like I chose not to go but now my mum wants me to either be on a mission or in some school program... All of which she wants me to pay for myself and says I have to do it. The mission is already a no and whenever I say that I'm not going on a mission and that we'll see about school when the time comes she starts to cry. Crying is a form of manipulation whether or not it's intentional
