fatlogic,ff95064,t3_es9s6i,1579704984.0,"The best part of this is the zig zag text and how it undercuts the other messaging. First 10 pound weight loss is based of cutting out candy, but then the dieter ""gives in"" to cravings which results in going back to ""natures intended weight."" It seems nature just intends for us to eat candy.  

Or how being tried of counting macros will somehow lead to binging. There's so much wrong with this... in general macros by themselves won't help you lose weight unless you're doing it as part of calorie counting.  (I concede that some individuals might do a bit better on different macros based on complicated factors. I'll also concede that trying to maintain certain macros can have the side benefit of steering people into making healthier food choices such as avoiding high carb sweets) That said getting tired of tracking macros isn't necessarily going to lead to binging. I don't even really see what would be tiring about it, with phone apps this stuff is really easy to log.

I also take issue with how ""metabolism slows"" in this context (a graph of ever increasing weight gain) appears to be suggesting that diets permanently damage metabolism like some permanent horror, but that isnt the case. Losing weight slows the metabolism cause there less weight to haul around... just eat a bit less or exercise a tiny bit more, like just 20 minutes of walking, and if you do happen to start gaining the weight back well your metabolism does go up again."

I can see why people might like this game it is an interesting take on the open world genre, but it just felt like time had not been kind to it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I just felt that GTA and Assassin's Creed did what this game was trying to do much better."

fatlogic,fejtxbz,t1_fejkidk,1579185765.0,"It's not that I lack an interest in lifting weights because it is repetitive or anything, it's more that I'm reticent to start because I'm worried I could hurt myself or something. I don't really have anyone to workout with and show me the lifts so I'd have to learn based off of workout videos online... and I'm not sure I'd be able to get the right form down. I lost some cartilage in my knee several years back, not related to weight lifting or anything, which has perhaps made me more reticent than I should be. 

My apartment complex has a small gym that has recently been upgraded and renovated. It now has a weight machine, a selection of dumbbells, a stationary bike, treadmills, medicine balls, exercise balls, and a stair climber. The weight machine looks fairly all encompassing with four different stations on it, I think there are instructions on the weight machine itself about which exercises can be done on them, so my tentative plan is to look up those exercises and see if they work as a circuit, if the weight machines don't have the exercises on them I will look up the model online to see what exercises can be done on them  My thinking is that a machine would be harder to mess up on than with free lifting."

I really should go to the doctor... but honestly the idea of doing a barium swallow and/or getting a tube shoved down my throat is extremely unsettling to me. I think the choice is outside of my hands at this point since it still hasn't gone away even with OTC medication and diet changes. It's gotten better and it's somewhat manageable now but I do probably need to be checked at to make sure I'm not getting any complications like Barrett's esophagus even if that does mean a tube down the throat."
fatlogic,fehhve1,t3_ep3ge4,1579116857.0,"I'm officially no longer overweight. After four and a half months and 40 pounds down for the last 3 days my BMI has been under 25 . At first it was underwhelming, when I imagined reaching this point I had always expected some sort of moment of elation, but that didn't happen. Of course I've been watching the scale inch closer and closer to this for the past two weeks the lack of surprise might have tampered down my expectations. Notwithstanding my failure to find joy in the moment I've still been pretty pleased about it all. I still have a bit of pudge in my center,  a bit of a belly... but I look really good when I tighten my gut the slightest bit, the normal amount of tensing one does when one stands up straight.  

My original goal is 4 pounds away but I'm probably going to try and lose about 10 pounds or so... according to some sources I've read that's the optimal weight for someone my height, but I admit not being sure on my path forward. Do I try to maintain for a bit and then get back to cutting calories, do I try to go to only a half pound a week, or do I try to maybe start lifting weights? I honestly don't really know for sure... because honestly I don't really know what I want to do. The only reason I really started losing weight was because of acid reflux and not really for vanity reasons (annoyingly I still have reflux) in theory I'd like to have muscles but I've never been really interested in weight lifting. At the end of the day I'm glad I've lost the weight, but other than looking better and probably being healthier I'm not really sure what I've accomplished per se. I mean I know I've accomplished something intellectually but I don't really feel excitement that normally comes with achievement."
fatlogic,fefi2fy,t1_feembz8,1579056763.0,Maybe you should stop eating until you fill full. I mean the feeling of fullness at each meal isn't really something to shoot for when you start dieting. When I first started dieting I suffered through about two weeks of hunger but it eventually abated. The thing is I stayed at my calorie count despite the hunger. The body eventually adjusts or at least mine did.

If the GOP decides to forgo their duties and oaths in order to give Trump a quickie acquittal,  Dems will complain about it but they will not continue to fight a lost battle. That's the problem, Dems surender in the face of political realities while the GOP fights dirty. It can't even be said to be irrational either that's the sad fact. The GOP maintains a huge edge since they right wing media ecosystem to appeal to which if fanatically partisan and will go to the mat for whatever they do. The MSM is impartial to a fault, and will bend themselves into knots in order to both sides any outcome. If and when the GOP acquit the mainstream media by the large will blame democrats for not getting enough evidence to convince the GOP. They will do so because that will be the official GOP narrative and they will take the GOP at their word. It would simply be wrong for them to assume the GOP could be anything other than truthful.

SubredditDrama,fdac6fp,t1_fda8v7f,1578244438.0,"Think back to how the alt right started up in 2015 spamming shit where SJWs get owned or triggered. I mean just go on youtube and you can find several videos of protesters getting hit by cars with views in the hundreds of thousands. Dark shit like that is appealing to alt right. Hence the breeding ground issue. When you expose people to a lot of content like this it will either appeal to people predisposed to  already believing violence is an acceptable response or to those not predisposed at least condition them to think it's okay to revel in these sorts of things online. I'm not saying all the users are this way I'm just point out the appeal.

I'm staying close to my allotted calories but I feel a lot hungrier at the end of the day. I probably just need a day or two more to readjust back to normal. The fact that my scales went up 6 pounds is annoying even though I know that's just water weight from the carbs of sugar. Still I think on the whole I probably ate less than I normally do for Christmas. I used to just chow down on cookies and fudge... and while I did indulge a lot I can't help but think I had less than I normally did for special occasions. Plus this time I didn't take any sweets home for myself either. I also take an odd sort of comfort from the mild stomachache I got after eating too much for dessert, that's not really something that has happened before, and while I'm probably overthinking it all I'd like to view it as a success in its own right.
