I’m saying what we call one thing can easily be called another thing but to someone else objectively they might not be able to tell the difference, it’s all relative. I think I agree with you but at the same time I feel I’m being misquoted in a way, but over all I think we both have the same general view point on what OP’s concerns are. People, as far as I’m concerned, so long as they don’t bring harm to me, others or themselves can do as they please. But yeah cheating is not ok by me, casual intercourse is not ok by me, and I never said being in an open relationship is taboo or wrong, but it’s also... not for me. Hope that clears it up!

And to the Op cheating is not ok either,  but the whole reason I even explained myself cause cause someone asked what I meant by hooking up isn’t normal to me. It’s not, why would it be, many people were raised to believe it wasn’t and I’m  one of them, I can’t be the only one lol. But that’s not to say Op is wrong to think cheating isn’t ok but so long as he understands I think it’s wrong to make casual sex ok. 

I only wanted him to understand that not everyone is going to agree and for the people on his campus he’s just either going to have to accept that way of life around him or surround himself with other like minded people.

Also, I see now I may have over shared my opinions so sorry about all that. Not to worry though I’m in no position to enforce my way of thinking on anyone nor would i want to."

Or is he just not good enough in many respects for his ex and ultimately will have to understand regardless of what he thinks of himself, it’s her that doesn’t want nor desire him any longer that’s ultimately more true."

I really don’t understand how they are ripping people off? We can do our own research and pick our own batch and go to yaobao or whatever or alibaba and get this stuff for the same price they get it for but y’all don’t? Why, cause most of you don’t know anyone that can read Chinese and help you. But you’ll belittle “these people” who work everyday, long hours, and are constantly ridiculed by the masses so they can feed their families. These middle men (pardon my French) aren’t making diddly squat! The reality is they make enough money to feed themselves and their families and keep a tiny roof over their heads.  And btw if it wasn’t for “them” there would be no repfam, none of y’all would be rocking loud, fire, kicks, so show a little appreciation. It’s easy to pick up a torch and say yah they are crooks, but I don’t hear the same anthem for people who use bots that buy up all the kicks and resell them for obscene prices, I don’t hear noise about that, but I guess it’s easier to point the finger and pick on your brother and sister from another continent so you can make yourself feel better that way?

I hear OGTony has the best AF1 Off Whites and I’ve bought all 3 colorway’s and no one can’t tell in hand or on feet except dapper pros, H12 and OWF have the best prestos, and Monica is very pleasant to deal with and she has access to many factories as well (but maybe not as many as OG Tony).

BUT you could have easily gotten a second pair for free or a refund but the way you went about it didn’t help. Yes, she needs to take responsibility because she’s the middleman regardless if The Factory sent the wrong pair. But it sounded like (at least to me) she was very willing to help you. You came in accusatory and your tone wasn’t respectful or calm. When she was going to check for you that was when you should say something like “ok ty and pls let me know.”  And then give her time to work on your behalf. Because English isn’t their (all sellers) first language they can’t get into an argument (it’s unfair) it would be like fighting with a child. Also, I don’t know the entire history of Vicky and I’m new to the repfam but bro you know you lost your cool and you know if you went in with a little bit more composure you could have gotten another pair shipped to you from PK BASF. If you don’t know that much and have that much sense, then I think maybe you should take a communication course maybe for your undergrad. The only reason I say this is because as a community we are looked down on by people who buy legit pairs and yet some of us think these middleman aren’t human and aren’t prone to mistakes especially when handling a large volume of orders?? Shame on all y’all you if you be doing that. I haven’t ordered from
Vicky but even Og Tony messed up once on his 2nd QC of my OWF Prestos but I thanked him, pointed out the flaw, said to do a better job for someone else and we were even at that by his word that he would. Be the bigger person especially when these peeps are trying to hook u up my man. Btw, Og Tony profusely apologized but I can tell a real Og humble person has a genuine soul when I see one (whether it be in person or over a text)... and he didn’t need to apologize. I’ve also had good dealings with KickWho and and the lovely Monica. Every middle man like every person has their own time constraints and personalities bro, remember to treat them with respect like you deserve to be to. Like how I addressed all of this in a respectful way and spoke the truth, not just my opinion. Be good bruh I know you can do better next time and so will Vicky 😎👍"

I shop at factory stores to and those clothes are made in Guatemala (probably deplorable conditions and wages) but you’re not talking about that one in particular. I served my country for 6 years so does that offset the harm you imagine I’m doing by feeding families in China by buying reps they willingly make?

Those kicks somehow make the entire outfit look even better to me, like business up Top and party at the Bottom.

Edit: it’s come to my attention some people really despise replicas, and the kicks I listed are replicas so sorry for the confusion but I did not mean to mislead anyone. So I’m just gonna add a comment about that. You shouldn’t devalue/stereotype/judge a person just because they wear reps, that’s not ok and sounds a lot like racism or someone who is egocentric at least. I’m a grad student so a) I don’t have the money b) would rather use the money to pay off loans. 
Lastly, think about this if someone used a military discount at a Nike outlet store and got a track suit for 40$ and someone else bought the same track suit at the official Nike store for 140$ does that mean the military veteran should be despised and belittled? So if that same vet/person decides to buy reps and add them to their wardrobe and they are called unhealthy and unstylish for that sole reason then isn’t it true this is the same as devaluing them as a person based off their attire?

I think you may need to review your most recent material mate."

starterpacks,fcv2u17,t1_fcuvjng,1577993488.0,"Then we’re all on the same page, many people do take it in private for all sorts of things  (not me mind you) and I would even say for them not to take it for x,y,z reasons when considering alcohol only. But someone might theoretically be fine, maybe 50-100’times throughout their life, but what else are they taking and with age, the variables start to stack and then all of a sudden 💥 something is the catalyst for an illness and it’s all down hill from there."

Can I take Advil® if I have a hangover?
“We don’t recommend taking Advil® if you have a hangover. NSAIDs, like Advil®, can cause severe stomach bleeding, especially if taken at higher doses.”

Looks like you’re gonna be a 4th year Pharm
Student next year as well old sport."
starterpacks,fctr36r,t1_fctfuxe,1577955133.0,"I agree, but I still wouldn’t green light this treatment if I was asked at a community or clinical setting. I can’t trust the patient is going to understand to take an NSAID with caution and non- habitually to “treat” a hangover, every other weekend or so. Nah I can’t do it, sorry but in the future you do as you like but I’m not a risk taker."
starterpacks,fctqusf,t1_fcte8cf,1577954795.0,"I’m a 2nd year in the accelerated program at MCPHS so I guess that would be equivalent to 3rd or 4th year in a traditional 4-6 year program (I’m assuming you’re in your final year)? But I still stand by what I said, I absolutely, without a doubt, do not recommend taking any kind of NSAID If there is alcohol still in your system simply to “treat” a hang over. Y’all may not like it but it’s best to sleep it off, or drink plenty of water and get a decent meal.

Also, many of us have at least a bachelors in a junior science (e.g. biology, chemistry etc). Though technically you may be correct, I would not recommend an NSAID after a night of binge drinking, and the patient would continue to do this and eventually may damage hepatic function. I’m not recommending this and risking my license, y’all do what you want. ✌️"
starterpacks,fctdy4g,t1_fctbhsf,1577940210.0,"It is, but only in relation to it being a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX enzyme). So it doesn’t have as many of the sides effects or other NSAIDS but we’re taught to not take with alcohol or to take after a night of binge drinking. If peeps wanna risk liver or hepatic toxicity I guess that’s on them but I’m just the messenger. ✌️"
