CPTSD,ffaayoh,t1_ffaaera,1579731346.0,"I just recently discovered what shame is and that this feeling I had (and it made me different from others) stems from my abusive childhood....I had no clue..
I have not gotten over it myslef yet but I know it is hard work...self observation, journaling, trying out new things...I don't think my therapist is understanding this feeling well ....so I try to find ressources myslef (YouTube videos by Mark Smith from family tree brand coaching) ....but I expect it will be a long process...it took so many years to feed us all those lies and shame ...it will take super long time to get rid of it. 

What type of therapy are you in? I am sure you did tons of work there already...do you think your therapist gets cptsd and shame?"
depression,ffaahyl,t3_esiii4,1579731077.0,"Are you diagnosed as depressed? Are you on meds? I would not say your week off is ruined if your body demanded sleep and you provided it.

Are you working shifts or regular hours? Do you drink? 

If you are depressed and on meds then adjusting meds is the first step here. If you are kot on meds then see a doctor. Antidepressants can help you with energy levels! If you don't think you are depressed but you are affraid you might be look at other symptoms, take some tests online to see if you might be. Then see a doctor.

If nothing of the above is true for you ...check your blood and do general rests as you might have some other health problem...good luck!"
CPTSD,ffaa4pg,t3_esilv5,1579730867.0,"Gosh! ....sorry you went through that much...it is so shitty:(((

Unfortunately understanding your troubles and symptoms (chronic shame is a big symptom of cptsd) is just part of the healing...the other part is to undo the damage that happened, get some new experiences (through therapy group or individual) and feel things that you might have not experienced previously like safety, trust, support, understanding , validation...if you have relational trauma (and you do, the person who was supported to love and protect you abused you big time) you need to heal via another realtionship...usually it is a therapsit or therapeutic group, sometimes a partner. Sadly understanding or pin pointing an even won't help in a long run. And feel free to vent....as much as you want....this forum is perfect for that!"
mentalhealth,ffa9kwu,t3_esim1e,1579730551.0,"This was very hard to read....I could tell you how sorry I am that you had all those experiences and you might not believe me ....this kind of stuff really leaves you messed up. Heavy stuff...It is no surprise you have difficulties being an independent adult and forming relationships:( 

Your mind is not making anything up. Those are very disturbing experiences. There is probably tons more that are not experiences but LACK of them (i.e. your attachement needs not being met, lack of safety and support, parental attunement). It is very often now want happened to us but what did not happen. 

Once again: you feelings are valid! Yu are probably not used to this but you feel what you feel...and all those feelings matter!!! They are all real and what is sagnificant for you IS sagnificant. Even tho I did not have experiences of this measure I also believe I have right to my feelings of shame, anger and sadness...

Find ""adverse childhood experiences"" test online and check your score....it is good to know and will give you validation.
 
Is there any way you could move out in near future?"
depression,ffa8fv1,t3_esiopv,1579729911.0,I know....well just treat depression like any other ilnesse and give youself some slack...if you had a broken leg you would also do less right? Well adjusted meds can help with energy levels too!
EffexorSuccess,ffa88zd,t3_epq50q,1579729805.0,"UPDATE: after tow days of taking part of the dose in the morning, part of the dose at 6PM...I have to say I am feeling much better in the morning then before (basically I can function and not sleep). I realize it is only two days but this drug spikes up in the blood rapidly (especially if you are using IR version like I do) soI believe this is real effect and not placebo. Anyhow: worth trying to tweak the time as I believe it has impact. 

Another interesting update: I took 50 mg IR at 9 and then by 6pm I started to became sad and letargic....luckily It was time to take 75 mg ex and I quickly started to feel better, I did challenging workout, yoga etc..it was a good day overall!"
CPTSD,ff7ciqk,t3_es26vt,1579646368.0,"Ouch....I am sorry you experienced this...sucks...!!!

I am still puzzled by emotional flashbacks ...I don't really know if I am experiencing them or not...sometimes I have a very strong reaction or a dream and I feel exactly same way as I felt in the past because of my mom's behaviour. Sometimes I have strong feeling of sadness, lonliness or pain just out of nowhere ..not connected to anything. Yes there is a lot of shaking and muscle twitching..sometimes whole body is jerking (I guess this is the right term?) ...it all started when I entered Therapy. Before that I only had those nightmares that brought up feelings I knew from my past. How is it for you? Is there some point when those flashbacks started appearing? Have you tried to work somatically (with a therapist or on your own) to help you process these emotions?"
depression,ff5iggo,t1_ff5hgkv,1579594362.0,You need to work on your trust in your self. Maybe in the past your partner or parents would make you feel bad for your decisions or belittle you. Time to take power back and get to know what you want. Also to realize what is the worst thing that can happen. Sometimes imagining it helps (not always). Also seems like you have a particular decision in mind but you are overgeneralizing be saying *always* ...think about 5 times last month when you made a good decision - even small - to start growing some confidence in your ability.
depression,ff5h720,t3_errbme,1579592712.0,"By getting to know youself and make decisions that align with your values and not what your parents or society expects you to do.

TalkTherapy,ff47wfy,t1_ff4559k,1579557471.0,"One more thing: there is another instagram account called finding_lucy_king she also talks about self harm due to attachement needs...I think it would be a good read for you. 

If you have the courage to do it ask you therapsit for transitional object (I am sorry if I f*** the name) ...basically it is a tiny thing she can give to you (like a plastic key chain or what ever ...tiny non valuable item) you can see one on Lucy's King instagram. It is something that keeps you connected to your therapist. If you are shy to ask write it on a piece of paper and pass the paper to your T . If you are still shy to ask...just grab a tissue from her office and have it with you for the week. Better then nothing if it prevents you from slef harm. 

Basically if you are shy of this conversation in general just write it down and bring with you:) it is really not as scary as it seems and you are not doing anything wrong. You have strong feelings....feelings are not actions."
TalkTherapy,ff4752a,t1_ff4559k,1579557005.0,"I talked about this with my T in connection to the fear I had/have to be attached to somebody. It was so bad I would wake up at night and cry -I was so scared to be attached. I told him that I absolutely hate this attachement and I never wanted to be in situation like this. I was furious he did not warn me...(furious means I used strong directive language not screaming or anything....) I believe this is so common in therapy that therapist have moral obligation to warn clients (at least my moral spine tells me to do so) . He said that it is horrible and unwanted by some clients and some clients enjoy this and ask ""give me more"". He also asked if I see this attachement dissolving in the future - I said yes I can congitively understand this but my heart and body screams I will be hurt. We have talked about it again few weeks ago: he never used word transference, even ""attachement"" wasn't his favourite (we are both non natives doing therapy in English so don't pay too much attention to particular words). He told me that just because I had bad experiences in the past this does not mean it will be the same here. What he means is that even tho I was hurt in the past this will be different. 

Long story short he was totally cool with it. Actually talked about it less then I hoped for and encourages the ""connection"" as we dont see each other often enought and he wants the connection to stay there so I am welcomed to write him emails if needed. 

On the side note: a CBT therapist I saw for a short time knew I am very attached to this guy and encouraged me to came back to him as ""this strong bond is very important and it is quite amazing you manage to build this together"""

TalkTherapy,ff3vu49,t1_ff3eoe1,1579549962.0,Do you know about cptsd? This is often misdiagnosed with bdp...
TalkTherapy,ff3vb8f,t3_er7p12,1579549635.0,"I feel strong attachement it my T too but not as much as you do. So I understand and had this conversation with him too. One thing you can try it realize is that those longings and needs are really not of today. Don't shame yourself for it. Imagine you are shank g super young version of youself ...2,3 or 4 year old you. You don't deserve shame you deserve understanding, love and compassion! If you frame the feelings this way they are very understandable right?

I have been in a phase of therapy when I was simmilar to you ....a bit obsessed, googling etc. One reason for it might be that you developed Preoccupied attachement style to your therapist. Please read about it. Eventually it should settle down and you will be more securely attached. You can also learn about object consistency and how we (me included) probably have problem with it.

How to address it in therapy: first of all let your therapist know you have something difficult to talk about, tell the person they became super important attachement figure in your life. You can say you are overwhelmed and you need for connection is strong. You can say you are ashamed of those feelings but you have done your research and you understand this is common in therapy. You can say you are angry/scared/ .......but you hope she can help you work throught it and this is a pattern in your life. You can also ask some questions that really bother you about her just to feel closer to her. (If it helps, she does not need to answer). If your therapist handles this well you can talk about googling her (and why..out of need for connection or simple curiosity?)

Please don't beat yourself up for those needs! Your parents were supposed to be your attachement figures and help you develop into independent adult....for some reason they failed and therapy should help you get pass this...it won't be easy (especially if you are on bdp spectrum) but the attachement to therapsit has huge healing potential.

My therapist assure me I will not be hurt in the end of therapy but a)I dont believe it and b) I will need to quit him soon..we are fighting too much:( he is burned out and I am ""sometimes too much"" for him"
TalkTherapy,ff3pr4x,t3_ergf1n,1579546212.0,"Reach out to him. It is important that you feel the connection and my T is encouraging it. This is the part of therapy and it is super painful but the sooner you dive deep the sooner you will be done. Don't feel embarassed....you therapist had tons of clients with the same needs. These are NOT needs of today. These are needs that your parents should have attended to along time ago but for some reason they failed. The realtionship with therapsit should uncover and fix that a bit (there is no way to fix it entirely so there will be grieving and pain involved) . 

Good job for talking about your attachment to therapist! Some believe that without the attachement healing can't happen. 

Think about a 4 year old whose main attachement figure left for 2 weeks....you would be devastated and anxious right? Do this little child in you a favour and get some care from therapsit! The little 4 (or how many years old you feel that child is - for me it is 4) is hurting! It is ok to miss your therapist! Check out @girlintherapy.uk on instagram for more info on the subject.

TalkTherapy,ff3p2wh,t3_eragvj,1579545804.0,"I feel you! I just had the same conversation with my partner!!! 1h ago! 

I told my therapist that I take a backpack full of thoughts into the therapy, I turn it upside down and lots of stuff falls out. I talk about one for half a session and we never get back to it. We never discuss it really. He just helps me to sum it up or describes how I might feel. Then we move on. I am VERY frustrated about it because I am not doing better. If I had some ideas like what my hidden needs are or how to attend to them, stop negative self talk or how to find a goal in life, want is important for me, what I don't do the things I want to do, why I contact toxic people, why I get dissapointed, how to work with chronic shame, how to not take criticism so personally....THEN I would see progress...we don't do any of that. I am in your FRUSTRATED team. I am very attached to him and he is okish with it but we never talk about why, how could I get these needs meet outside of therapy room. 

I know the therapy is there to fix your attachment wounds and create ""internal"" therapist. Bit on the way there we could be doing something...otherwise I can get attached to him by taking about puppies at this time...so so so frustrating:( ....

Can you are your therapist what is the goal or what you are working on? Do you have a lot of transference towards him? Strong feelings in general are popping up(for me they do and it is so painful and horrible that I can see how my T is not going to put more burden on me) but it seems to me like for you it is more about self discovery then working to connect to burried strong emotions...do you have better realtionships with people? Nice romantic relationship? Are you less triggered? More self confident? More you then your parents projection?"

She told me there are many ways to take medication and you just need to try. I also try to drink a lot of water (2l per day minimum) but I also have 2 coffees every day.

It hurts soooo BAD but some people believe that feeling those strong emotions and not pushing them down is a sign of progress. Having attachement to you therapist and feeling safe is a sign of progress, feeling shitty is a sign of progress since you are not hiding your emotions anymore and not running away from them.  No idea what issues you are dealing with but 5 sessions is nothing... Sorry to say but it might be super long journey with ups and downs by the time you will see progress.

CPTSD,femtzz7,t3_eq0lfb,1579269551.0,"It all depends on the type of therapy you would do...and there are so many! There are approches that are more about gaining insight ( like psychoanalytic and psychodynamic partially) that are those that deal with your ""faulty"" way of thinking like CBT. I am sure you know this already. What you might not know is that trauma has changed your brain, literally stress hormones has flooded it and through neuroplasticity of the brain via therapy you can change the connections and have a corrective experience with another human being. You can partially fix what trauma has robbed you of or what you have never experienced due to trauma (like full development) you can find surprising emotions that are still, in your body, without you knowing it....this would be what deep psychotherapy with somatic elements could offer you. You could also take part in a group therapy to learn how you behave with others, how other see you, how you build relationships (this is also possible with a therapist), you could experience secure attachement, release emotions, learn new skills, take risks in trying new behaviours....you could also try emdr to deal with traumatic memories...so yes thee is a lot on a body/emotional/experience/brain lever that therapy could offer you."

CPTSD,femffkg,t3_eprqgi,1579252691.0,"First of all...it is hard to judge what therapist says since to you since it is like ""watching washing machine from outside"" while you are both in it. 

The feeling of sadness and emptiness after therapy session is difficult and there should be moments of deep connection in my opinion but you need to be open to receive that. Often people who are in therapy are not open to this, it overwhelms them, they pull away, they keep distance, they are affraid of being hurt....the care can turn into abuse within seconds in their mind. I feel this way often. I have shaky relationship with my T. but I do believe he cares. 

The part of therapy that is very hard is to MOURN what you deserved and SHOULD have gotten but you didn't. Your inner child, your deepest pain and longings show up due to the nature of terapeutic relationship but those needs can not be fully fulfilled by the therapist...by nobody really. Noone will be able to be there for you 24h. The ""good enough"" parent need to be attuned with a child at least 30% of the time. It is so little yet so much for many of our parents. It is very hard realization and it is ok to be sad, angry, lonely, hurting like you never had before....this is what many people would say Therapy is about. If you do t experience it and can't heal it in the present of caring therapist who can help you process it you won't be able to heal in and move ahead. You will be looking for people to fullfills those needs until the rest of your life and you will be very dissapointed.

In the flip side: good relationship can be extremely healing! I am a walking proof of that! My husband takes care of me, I take care of him. We are not meant to be alone in the world with our struggles. We are social creatures and if it totally ok to count on others to help us. It just won't be to the same level your inner child hopes for. 


I hope this answer helps. Also make use of the therapy in away that suits you. If you need more connection with the terapist TELL him that! I am sure he would love to hear what works and what brings you closer to the feeling of connection. (Even moving chairs closer can help). For me it is when therapist names my feelings or says how he would feel in my situation."

 Cant you go with a friend? If your mom does not know about the abuse she can still go with you - she does not need to know exactly what you are talking with therapist about. Also ...it is ok to tell therapist on the phone that you are stressed before the meeting. Good therapist will not ask you about details of your trauma.

depression,fe70pr5,t3_eo1usb,1578908432.0,"I don't work at the moment...actually I take half a year off in winter and work really hard in summer. 

 Be honest with people why you work part time as tell them the actually it is ok for you. You are still very young and you wilk have enought time to work your ass off later. Also they should be actually jealous you can have a ok lifestyle while working half of the time they do. Your mental health is your priority. Other people might have different priorities and this is ok too. 

I also hate the idea of slaving my life away. This is why I have high paying, very challenging but extremely flexible seasonal job and I dont care if people call me lazy because I take months off. 

On the side note: make sure you actually enjoy what you do. If you have the energy you can spend time off on education of self development and this is great investment. And if all you do is sleep cause your body needs it now that tis ok for some time too!  Good luck..and dont let peoples opinions affect you! You boyfriend should be more supportive. He probably is stick between you and his parents and does not realize you should be his priority and he should be having your back. He is adult now and he should stand against his parents to protect you. But he is still super young so I see this can be difficult."

Schedule regular appointments - is it possible to see them every week? Or every two weeks but for longer? Psychiatrist is a good idea too and I am sure therapist would support this especially if you are having suicidal thoughts. Treated it as any other ilness and just try to work every day a bit towards getting better. Work with therapist on finding the reason for your depression, Talk about your feelings, thoughts....don't be shy, journal and come prepared to those sessions so you can use this time to your benefit as much as possible.

Medication is not going to fix your depression but it is going to give you energy and a little boost so you can slowly trunk your life around. I am not from USA so I have no clue how it works there unfortunately. I would also think about therapy at some point down the road. Living in a homeless shelter can definetly mess you up. Trauma or PTSD can be very much want you are dealing with. Exercising, hobby, regular schedule, social life can help but it will not solve the issue. I assume there was a reasons by you guys lost home and there is much more to the story. This all should be dealt with if you want tog et better long term ...but first step is to get meds so you can maintain some ki dog schedule and care of your basic needs. Good luck!"

depression,fdqlcok,t3_emqt4j,1578669435.0,It is very hard to say anything really based on interaction via internet. Nobody (even not a professional) can give you diagnosis without spending some time talking to you. Also drugs really influence us and it could be all casused by them. This are two reasons why you should see professional help even if it is overwhelming :( maybe your wife could help you with setting up appointment? Also you wrote you are struggling quite some time...have you tried ever a deeper therapy? CBT is working for some people but not for everyone also it does not solve old emotions and i.e childhood traumas or attachement wounds...I would dug deeper for the casue of your depression with a therapist.

Normally I would call a therapist and ask questions before even booking an appointment! I hate this places that are therapy factories ....in the end it is real good for you that you did not waste 200$ for ""we don't know what and who"" It is always better to reach to a professional directly ask about their experience, if they deal with issues you are bringing, who they work with, how often you need to see them , what are the cancellation rules etc etc....Maybe writing an email would be easier then calling?

I really don't thing there is much that can scare him tho. You are honest, you are very self aware, you are ready to work on it. I would not be scared  and I have zero training in mental health. I would feel honored I can help you and impressed by how brave you are for dealing with your past. I would treat the email as a normal thing. Therapists know it is not about them and try to not take things literally. 

I sent simillar email to my T not long ago. I told him I Hate him because I have  that attachement and that it is so painful and that I wasn't warned about this in therapy. I told him he is important person for me and ...he sees it as progress...I also told him I regret starting therapy ...every day I regret it. he told me I am the most critical client ever. He had to talk twice with his supervisor about me....and we are still working together. 

Don't expect a long reply form your psychologist vis email. It is tricky to ""do therapy"" in writing so most likely he will acknowledge this email and sat ""we will talk in session"" or he won't sent reply (depends on your agreement about contact between sessions). 

You are not too much. You found a person you can trust and you ant to know more about him. He probably will ask why and it is good to think about it....ok? Take care!"
