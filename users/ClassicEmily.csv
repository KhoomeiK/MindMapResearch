Debbie is going through a learning curve, I just hope it will not become too bitter, I don’t expect her to keep the job position, either Debbie will have a conscience or the mother will find out.

Carl usually does the right thing (currently) so it looks like he will have advanced job prospects, if the officer doesn’t turn on him.

Vee and Kev storyline was hilarious, I was thinking the same as well, but if it means a better future for their daughters, I totally understand, even if it means being a spectacle of lower-class.

A bit of trouble in paradise for the boys, it will take some to build up some trust, I don’t think this situation will do much damage to their relationship. I actually thought Micky was going to immediately console Ian after he broke (or injured) his leg (the special effects didn’t look like it could be serious) but I suppose Micky is going to need some time to process. Mickey’s father being around is uncomfortable, interesting to see where this all goes, particularly when (I assume) Ian and Micky do get married. 
About time the past bites Frank, I wonder if the consequences will have a deep effect on Frank’s psyche and this isn’t easily brushed off, I was also surprised that the storyline is more substantial then the woman being a nut. 
I was more focused on everyone else to care about Lip.. the baby is alive, that’s good. It seems Lip will take over the fatherly role in the house, which is suiting, for now. Still many learning curves with Tammy and Lip."
