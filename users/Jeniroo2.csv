dating_advice,ff6pcwb,t1_ff6d551,1579632083.0,"This person has excellent advice! Just think in the back of your mind, who is this person!?id like to find out! Try and be present in terms of genuinely finding stuff interesting. 

""Oh yes I went to Prague""

Well if you dont know where it is but like geography, ask!


If you dont really travel but you like food! Ask about the cuisine!


If your cousin want to Prague and you enjoyed hearing about it from them , say, ""my cousin went, dont they have great (BLAH) there or am I thinking of somewhere else?""

And slowly but surely with more practise, you will read people better, and just find yourself enjoying it. Then it's less than a half step away from just... really enjoying someones company. When you make a new friend and you find out they make you BELLY LAUGH it is the best feeling. 

And hey, if you're meeting new people for the first time, and you dont like them, remember you can pop outside for a bit, go get a drink, go smoke a fag (last two either advisable in small doses or not at all , and, in that order) pop to the toilet, whatever. If they seem weird or you're not feeling a good conversational flow, theres the potential (in some settings, like a party) where you just casually mingle with some new people. Even taking a break from someone you like that you are vibing with is allowed, no one minds as long as you just say ""I'll be back in a couple of minutes"". If you dont like them, just say ""scuse me a sec guys"" and excuse yourself"

Also  you have NO control over whether they'll get in touch or not which for me is annoying for a while and then is just ... forgotten. If they pop up it's a nice surprise!"
