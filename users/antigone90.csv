StardewValley,fedjfux,t1_fedisco,1579013058.0,"From what I understand, giant crops don't either with the season change. I broke down my pumpkins right after the picture, so I didn't test it. But I've seen people with pictures of giant melons in winter."

cats,fed7nhl,t3_eohyai,1579002662.0,I'm so happy for you guys! Four years apart is insane. I hope the older couple gets another kitty to love.
StardewValley,fed7e89,t1_fed7aes,1579002350.0,"I feel your pain! It's been years of actively trying to get giant crops for it to happen for me. Keep at it, because one day you'll get lucky like I did. ü•∞"
aww,febkjp0,t3_eoavye,1578959762.0,I thought it was a Mandrake at first. I feel dumb. Cute burrito!

ThriftStoreHauls,fe9amlc,t3_eo2s7w,1578935902.0,I need to find these. I've never been in greater need of a material item.
TalesFromYourServer,fe8m65v,t1_fe6xmxb,1578927807.0,"Oh I'm in Utah. I don't mean to imply that most people are rude, just that it happens. Out of all the guests to the restaurant, at least one a day per server would treat us poorly. I only ever reacted that way to bring snapped at, otherwise it was jokes and taking responsibility for the mistakes like you said."
aww,fdyd45a,t1_fdwt3g1,1578778465.0,I hope you're doing okay sillysillyjordan.
TalesFromYourServer,fdya4wx,t3_en92pm,1578777662.0,"The time I was snapped at, I just instinctively replied ""do not do that."" And then got what he wanted. He kept trying to justify himself and I just kept pointing out how other patrons got my attention. At the end of the visit,  I told him how it made me feel and he apologized. 

People often treat servers poorly, but for some reason the snapping of fingers crossed a line for me."
freepatterns,fdy72rf,t3_en862e,1578776779.0,I love it and you for making it.
13or30,fdmhwdn,t1_fdlb1gn,1578550486.0,"Can't hide the garments in that dress, haha. My only friend who is still a member calls stuff that she considers immodest ""sassy."" I showed her the picture and she said ""oh what a beautiful bride! That dress is a little too sassy for my taste though."" Yeah Krista, tank tops are sassy to you girl."
13or30,fdlvb5a,t1_fdl92s7,1578533337.0,Me too. I was told I looked like a teenager every time I went makeup free until I turned 28. Now people just ask if I'm sick.
13or30,fdkx5io,t3_elt6bk,1578512984.0,"Lol, multiple comments about how Mormon this dress is, when no member I know would wear it unaltered. It's very pretty and I don't think it's ""immodest,"" but members of the church would. The top is shear and you can see her back. Both are no goes. 

I know the joke is probably more about child marriage because she has a baby face. It just kept making me laugh as I thought about my friends' faces if I suggested this dress for their wedding.

cats,fdgat4e,t3_el3rpt,1578387632.0,I'm sorry. I know I can't say anything helpful. I hope you and your kids are okay. She was a gorgeous kitty.
cats,fckjlyi,t3_ehkqrg,1577726758.0,I wish I could say something helpful. I'm about to go through the same thing with our cat and I can't think of anything to comfort my siblings either. I'm so sorry that you're going through this too. I hope you are doing okay. Luna was gorgeous and I'm glad she had you.

Eyebleach,fc5lh6j,t1_fc5cdbp,1577460760.0,"My dog wouldn't snuggle until he was three. Now he curls up with me quite often. He may just need to calm down a bit. Regardless, hope you and your dog are best buddies."
aww,fc4i7zv,t3_eg135x,1577417405.0,"As a sister who has one sibling I've drifted away from, this has touched me a lot. I'mma figure out how to reconnect with him. Your sister is talented and sweet. I hope you guys always stay close."
