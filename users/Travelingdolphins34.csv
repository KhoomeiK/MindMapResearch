college,fdjvvxz,t3_ellmuf,1578489218.0,"I commute 45 minutes. I listen to a daily morning radio show called ""Dave and Chuck the Freak"". It's hilarious, gives me a chance to get ready for the day. Same with driving back, gives me a chance to relax before going home and digging into homework or facing the challenges there.

However, waking up at 6 AM to get to my 8 AM class can be a bit challenging."
