FinancialPlanning,ff4ie40,t1_ff3y294,1579564349.0,"Courts don't give a damn what your agreements are - if the kid needs more than she can provide, you will pay. Hell, there was a case where a dude was paying child support for a while after a divorce, then years later found out the kid wasnt his. Court STILL made him continue to pay child support even after that. So yeah, you will pay at some point, like it or not. 

Best of luck. Hopefully you get more for your house than you are expecting."
financialindependence,ff4hsaj,t1_ff4e9h2,1579563936.0,"Have you been called out by management at all yet, for a warning or by any kind of passive aggressive whatever? I'm curious how you'd handle being called out- like give some b/s excuse and then not change, or be more honest. 

Btw, I'm genuinely curious, no judgement here either. I had been in one of those high pressure situations, pulled back some (although not nearly enough), and saw no consequences. So I think you are on to something and wish you luck. Hopefully you can milk it for whatever your timetable is, not theirs."

homeautomation,fddx96y,t1_fdc6237,1578326205.0,"It seems some can, some cannot. I have some GE light switches that I was able to switch light modes on - LED on when light on, LED on when light off, and LED always off.

I switched modes on the first one I installed (light on, LED on), but when I installed another in the same box, I couldnt find the setting on either of them (too lazy to investigate). So, they are opposites of each other now."
atheism,fd51uun,t1_fd3dirl,1578173415.0,"I do that every day. In my eyes, I'm raising future adults, not children, so my job is to guide them to develop those skills. I always stress that the most important thing is to learn how to teach yourself new things, which requires exactly that type of thinking. 

I'm just waiting for the first time they encounter a teacher who is wrong about something but just wants them to accept whatever it is as fact. I also am teaching them to be polite, but still, that should be interesting."

atheism,fd2vmef,t1_fd2727r,1578152072.0,"I agree that you can do that, but my problem is I am doubtful that I can say much without completely trashing it. I am of the belief that religions are the biggest scourge on society and have always been. So, I'd be hard pressed to keep that from showing through. 

Honestly, I've considered letting someone ELSE who believes in it explain it to him, and I would answer questions after. If my son is ANYTHING like me in terms of curiosity/critical thinking, I'm sure there will be MANY questions."
