2. If a StarBucks vulnerability fell into my lap, I would probably report it for the $4K.  I have no doubt it could be sold for tens of thousands - if one knew where to find buyers.  Negotiating that transaction sounds painful.  Does the buyer just trust I am not bullshitting and give me the un-revocable bitcoin (or un-revocable equivalent) or do I just trust the buyer will deliver the money later.  Should there be a dispute, the courts will be of no use."
unpopularopinion,fcwxp1w,t1_fcwi55u,1578042075.0,"I was not thinking that the entire arsenal's confirmed location was public knowledge - just the majority.  It was my understanding that the purpose of submarine based missiles is to hide the location of the missile.  The location of silo based missiles can not very well be hidden.

However, I was curious and looked it up.  It seems various arms control treaties such as START ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START\_I#Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START_I#Implementation)) have provisions such as

>The START Treaty verification provisions were the most complicated and demanding of any agreement at the time as it provided twelve different types of inspection. Data exchanges and declarations between Parties became required which included exact quantities, technical characteristics, **locations, movements**, and status of all offensive nuclear threats.

If I am understanding that correctly, then by treaty obligation the Russians know exactly how many nuclear weapons we have, where they are, and how they move; and vice-versa."

A better example would be the identity of spies embedded in hostile nations.  Clearly when these spies signed up, our part of the bargain was we would not divulge their identity.  If we made that bargain we should keep it.

Perhaps OP meant that we should not be signing up spies, but for spies already signed up we should not reveal their identity."
programming,fcuofjt,t1_fcuju8h,1577985296.0,"I 100% agree deterministic tests are better.  However, if your team is used to pressing the ""retest button"" and it would take too may hours to fix the non-deterministic tests at this time, then having the build machine auto-retest is an easier sell.

Let n = 3.  Let p be the probability of a single spec failing = 0.10.  Then probably in the next build everything will pass, but it is only a matter of time before individual specs fail.  When they fail the 3 rounds, they will have to be fixed one at a time.

At some point in the future everything will become highly reliable (if not deterministic)."
funny,fcu0tn5,t1_fcu02vk,1577968638.0,"I do not really know what is going on.  But I suspect:

They had a car.  Something went wrong with their floor mat:

1. Someone stole it.
2. Someone pooped on it.
3. Someone threw up on it.
4. Whatever

It is gone and needs replacing.  They got a floor mat from another car - not the same make and model.  The floor mat was perfect for its make and model but not for their make and model.

Like I said, I don't know what happened.  That is just my theory."
programming,fcu04p2,t1_fcswqne,1577967849.0,"I really believe there should be no intermittent test failures.

However, one easy fix to intermittent test failure is to have the build server rerun the tests *n* times to the first success.  Your team chooses *n*.  A typical value would be 3.

If it passes the first run, great.  If it fails the first run, then it retries.

If it passes the second run, great.  If it fails the second run, then it retries.

If it passes the third run, great.  If it fails the third run, then someone needs to fix this shit.

Developers should not be pushing the retest button to get tests to pass."

unpopularopinion,fcqtbon,t1_fcq2e21,1577891882.0,"Regardless of the posted maximum speed limit and the posted minimum speed limit, in certain circumstances the only safe and legal speed is 0MPH.

I can understand the posted maximum speed limit.  If the posted maximum speed limit is 55MPH, they are saying that in optimal conditions the maximum safe speed is established as 55MPH.  Just stay under the maximum of (you feel safe, 55MPH).  If you get a speeding ticket for driving 50MPH in a 55MPH be prepared to argue in your defense why you felt 50MPH was safe (e.g., talk about the weather, the speed of traffic, etc.).

I can not understand the posted minimum speed limit.  If the posted minimum speed limit is 40MPH, then can you get a ticket for 35MPH?  Clearly there are times when 35MPH is the maximum safe speed.  How do you show that?"
