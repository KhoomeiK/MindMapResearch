succulents,ff9n8h6,t1_ff9l8qf,1579716537.0,"The window is the translucent green stripe that goes down the middle of each bean/banana. When the plant is thirsty, it with make a little crease at this part. And if the roots are rotted, just cut the strings off and put them in a new pot. If you take a close look at the strings you'll see little nodes every inch or two down the string. These nodes are where the roots will grow from, so make sure the nodes are in or close to the dirt and the plant should do the rest!"

succulents,ff952um,t3_escuhe,1579705036.0,"They look like they're rotting, but it isn't too late. I see new growth happening. When they wrinkle at their windows it means they're thirsty. When they wrinkle up like dried peas, something is wrong. I would take them out of this pot asap and see what is going on with the roots. Also, you will always want to get them out of their nursery pot and into some new dirt right after you buy them."
cactus,ff942xf,t1_ff8ux1t,1579704353.0,"Sweet. I will do that. Should I QT for 30 days? That's how long I have to QT animals for, that's why I ask lol also what other signs should I look out for?"

succulents,ff69x7o,t3_erva19,1579622548.0,I'm not sure what this plant is. If it is anything like a normal succulent it would like lots of sun and infrequent but thorough watering when the leaves start to get soft.
succulents,ff69neb,t3_erviwx,1579622371.0,"The cold may have been a factor, but some props just aren't successful. It won't hurt to put it on top of some dirt to see if it will take off. Since the leaf still has water in it, it might work. If not, just try again with another prop."
succulents,ff697nc,t3_ervs0g,1579622089.0,How exciting!!!
succulents,ff693sn,t3_ervyj7,1579622021.0,"A picture would be very helpful. If the overall plant looks okay, you could probably just replant it with more of the stem in the dirt so the roots are a little deeper. The stem should also put out new roots if you do this."
succulents,ff68yoe,t1_ff640dn,1579621931.0,"Does the powdery stuff wipe off? And what does the leaf feel like at those spots? Dry, crunchy, squishy? It is hard to tell exactly what we're seeing with the color of the light. Usually the white powdery stuff is farina which is natural. But this looks like it is just at the base of the leaves, is that right?"
succulents,ff611jy,t3_erj35u,1579616387.0,"It is a jade plant. Water it only when the leaves get soft. Don't go by the dryness of the soil. When you do water it, completely saturate the soil with water. You will want a pot with a drainage hole, preferably terra cotta. Find a pot that is about and inch bigger than this one. Use well draining soil; 50/50 mix of succulent soil and perlite. Be sure to shake out as much of the old dirt as you can before you repot it. Then don't water it for at least a week, even if the leaves feel soft. Put it in the sunniest spot you can find. Jades are hardy. It will be forgiving during your learning process. Lots if sun and infrequent but thorough watering."
succulents,ff60mi1,t3_erjy4x,1579616067.0,"The soil still looks too wet. I'd suggest taking it out and letting the roots dry for a day or two, then repotting it again. These plants can go weeks without water. Water every 3 days is too much."
succulents,ff60hqf,t3_erkltf,1579615964.0,"Leaf reabsorbtion is normal. Your plant will want all of the sun it can get. Literally all of it. And when you water it, you will completely saturate the soil with water. But only when it's leaves get soft and wrinkly. Don't go by soil dryness. You risk rotting your plant that way."
succulents,ff60993,t3_ermyg7,1579615779.0,Definitely some kind of mold. You will want to repot it asap.
succulents,ff606zy,t3_erpmfg,1579615729.0,"Clean out the dead stuff. You can cut the green parts away and put them back in the pot. If you take a close look at the strings you will notice little nodes every couple of inches. Those nodes are where the roots will come out, so make sure they're close to the soil."
succulents,ff5zin5,t3_errq0m,1579615180.0,"It looks thirsty! The soil looks nice and gritty too, so I don't think drainage will be a problem for you."
succulents,ff5zdrr,t3_erswj2,1579615069.0,"Some plants lose their leaves if they get too much water. I'm not familiar with pileas, but I'm willing to bet this is the case. You may also try over at r/houseplants they love pileas over there haha"
succulents,ff5z6fa,t3_ertiqo,1579614903.0,"You mean the brown spots? It kind of looks like scale, but it is kind of hard to tell under this light."
succulents,ff5z438,t1_ff5y3jn,1579614851.0,"The crack on the leftmost leaf? It is physical damage, like it got bumped or pinched."

whatisthisthing,fep538e,t3_eqa28j,1579312317.0,"This is in the Omaha/Bellevue area in Nebraska. For title clarification, there are two traffic lights for the turning lanes and two traffic lights for forward moving traffic on each side of the intersection. There is one blue light for each pair of lights. They are on day and night. They aren't visible to the traffic that follows the direction of that light. So, in this picture, the cars that are stopped by that red light can't see the blue light. And the blue light behind the green lights is not on."
succulents,fenhv45,t1_femohnn,1579285023.0,This is awesome thank you!
succulents,femccpq,t3_epq7nv,1579248364.0,It is likely putting more energy into growing the other pups rather than putting out its own new growth.
succulents,femc7yx,t3_eprtnb,1579248192.0,"Yes, you will need to repot it in a 50/50 mix of succulent soil and perlite. Find a pot with a drainage hole that is about an inch bigger than this one."
succulents,femc2ed,t3_epuk7f,1579247990.0,I would suggest taking it out and cleaning out the dead stuff. Then repot it in new soil (50/50 mix of succ soil and perlite) and pile the strings into the pot. They will make more roots and then will eventually start to make more strings. It also looks a bit etiolated like it needs more light.
succulents,fembwlw,t3_epvnnn,1579247782.0,"If they don't look or feel like they need water, then they don't need water at all. Typically, giving just a little water does nothing for them anyway. Watering freshly repoted plants that done need water is risky. I once had a plant that I had watered a short while before repotting. When I put it in its new pot, it absorbed the moisture that was in the new soil and it broke out in so much edema. Granted it had problems before, but I probably repoted it two months ago and the leaves are still ROCK HARD."
succulents,fekti9w,t3_epmfy1,1579207279.0,"Pack similar sized pots together. Put styrofoam, bubble wrap, paper, or something along those lines in between the pots so they don't break against each other or spill."

succulents,feitfnm,t1_feirthe,1579146749.0,"It likely is just the leaf not being successful. If the plant was freshly watered, the leaf might have just been so full of water that it couldn't survive. Propagating is trial and error."
succulents,feit9ik,t1_feirier,1579146622.0,"People's opinions and experiences vary. In my personal experience, when they start to grow roots, but start to get wrinkly from thirst, I water them. When they're not a fully established plant they're not able to hold water the same as established plants. I find that my props grow the best when I water them until they're able to support themselves."
succulents,feirpn8,t3_epdhan,1579145519.0,"Not all leaves will be successful unfortunately. When you take them off of the plant, is it a clean break/pop off of the plant or does the leaf rip off?"
succulents,feircm0,t3_epcnqo,1579145267.0,"The individual pearls or bananas won't make new plants, so you'll need a clipping of the actual string. There will be little nodes all along the string. That is where the roots will come from. So when you get your clipping, make sure to get those nodes close to the dirt. Wait until some roots start to sprout, then water it once a week until it can support itself."
succulents,feiqpj9,t1_feimnr5,1579144820.0,"Yes! Just treat it like you would if it had leaves. Eventually it will grow new little buds, but not on the top. They'll grow off of the sides."

succulents,feibvh9,t1_feiat9a,1579134876.0,"Yes it is very etiolated, that's why it is so tall. It is reaching for the light. Once you clip it, you will need to gradually introduce it to full sunlight. Or if you have a grow light that would be good too."
succulents,fei9f57,t3_epahmm,1579133242.0,"If you want to clip it then you can, just be sure to let it callous over before you put it in a new pot. But you don't have to clip it by any means. It'll keep growing."
succulents,fei99iq,t3_epamyp,1579133140.0,"Winter is when they're typically dormant, so it won't need more water than it does in summer. I think succulents sometimes reabsorb leaves for a little nutrition boost, so maybe that is what yours is doing?"
succulents,fei7xar,t1_fehvqy6,1579132274.0,It sounds like it rotted :(
succulents,fehvl0v,t1_feht2pb,1579124739.0,Definitely sounds like rot. Did you water it before you left and does the pot have a drainage hole?
succulents,fehsays,t3_eoy25m,1579122882.0,"Were the leaves black and mushy or black and crispy? Did you water it before you left? There is still hope for this stem, but what you do next depends on why the rest of the plant died off like that."
succulents,fehryht,t1_fehrld1,1579122688.0,I guess you could say that haha it is stress coloring which is like a succulent tan.
succulents,fehrvms,t3_ep5mic,1579122644.0,"When the leaves get soft and start to wrinkle is when you'll want to water it. Don't judge it by the dryness of the soil. When you do water it, set it in a deep bowl and fill the bowl with water until it is just below the brim of the pot. The plant will soak up the water from the bottom of the pot. Once you can see or feel that the top of the soil is wet, you know it is soaked through. After that, leave it be until the leaves get soft and wrinkly."
succulents,fehrh4a,t3_ep6kxn,1579122413.0,"That pot is an appropriate size for the plant. If it gets too much water then the lowest leaves will get yellow and mushy. That doesn't seem to be the case here, so I wouldn't worry about rot. Just be sure not to water it again until the leaves get soft and wrinkly. The pink tint on the newest leaves is more than likely some blushing. It must like the light that it is under now."

succulents,feh8dni,t1_fegr6y2,1579111265.0,If the leaves are browning at the base and the roots are black and falling off then it is likely rot. I would still suggest leaving it out for a while to see if it will dry up.
succulents,feh8246,t3_ep1rnb,1579111078.0,"I'm not sure what exactly your patio looks like. If there is a lot of reflection off of the metal that would hit your plants, then it wouldn't be good. I think that if you are able to comfortably stay out there, then your plants will be fine. Just be sure to gradually introduce them to the sun."
succulents,fegqj41,t3_ep2xul,1579100171.0,"The picture is kind of blurry, but I'm going to vote no. The base of the plant still looks white and healthy and the plant itself still looks good. Is it mushy? You could always leave it out to dry for a day or two and see if the roots dry up or if they still stay wet."
Omaha,feg1snb,t1_feecjmk,1579073233.0,"They obviously did. What a silly comment... Everyone knows a white paint bucket in the crosswalk means there is wet concrete somewhere in the general area. Where did you learn to drive? Sheesh.

succulents,fee0x0r,t3_eof4uo,1579024082.0,"That sounds good. About a 50/50 mix would be ideal. Also, you won't want to put it in a pot that is much bigger than the one it is currently in."
succulents,fee09fs,t3_eohjr9,1579023658.0,"The lighting sounds okay. When you water it, how much water are you giving it? If you're watering properly (soaking the soil all the way through), once a week is too much. You'll only want to water when they get dull and pucker or crease at their windows. Otherwise you're at the risk of over watering. It is likely dull in color due to too much water at this point."
succulents,fecf1w7,t3_eoa3me,1578972376.0,"Also hold off on watering, especially after you repot it."
succulents,fecevvv,t3_eoa4lg,1578972263.0,"I would lay it down on its side and then work the pot off of it that way. After that, get as much of the old dirt off as you can and the put it in a new pot."

Even if the soil is bone dry dust all the way through, the plant my be just fine on water. Always wait until the plant needs water; it's leaves will get soft and wrinkly. But not yellow and squishy."

succulents,feccnf8,t3_eoevsu,1578970816.0,"In my opinion, it looks like it was over watered. When lower leaves get soft and mushy like that, it is usually a good sign of too much water. It is tall because it is stretching for better light, so more sun will be good. I would just not water it for a very long time. It will eventually reabsorb the droopy leaves. If it is currently in soil that is damp, take it out and get it in some dry soil."
succulents,fe9vpvw,t3_eo73bc,1578941829.0,"It is normal for succulents to reabsorb their lower leaves. There is really nothing to worry about as far as that goes. However, it does appear that your plant may be thirsty. It might be reabsorbing its leaves to get some water. With the exception of the ones it is reabsorbing, are any of the others soft? If so, water is definitely your solution."

I work at an animal shelter, and GSDs and rottweilers are easily the most unpredictable dogs we see and they come with the worst behavior problems. As a matter of fact, a GSD trapped me in her kennel a couple of days ago and would mouth my arms and clothes if I tried to leave. It was scary. People get them because they're cute puppies and/or tough dogs, but they aren't prepared for the behaviors that come with them. My point is, the high standards that shelters have are sometimes there to protect the owner too. Rescues are also a good way to go if you haven't tried that already. If that still isn't an option for you, please please please find a reputable breeder. If you do your research you will find a dog that should be overall healthy and has a good temperment."
