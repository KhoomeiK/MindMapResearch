Next thing, take your journal, and/or a book. If you can afford it go to a Coffee Shop, get a drink and sit down to plan for 2020. Choose goals, any goals to start, house, family, pets, whatever. Whenever. Holidays? The more you write the more you will feel what you are interested on and what not.

You might want to check r/bujo bullet journals can be therapeutic for some people and a way to keep everything *under control*.

>I don't like having things to do so I turn down anyone who invites me to sth

this one is a bit strange. What is your intention to wake up and your concern with having things to do?

Is that you don't want to socialize? but you want to do things alone?

>not having plans and even if I did, I end up doing little of that and procastinating a lot.

Do you have plans, or just **to do's**?

Plan further, plan steps, break the process of whatever you want to accomplish. Some task are too big to just ""do it"" If you are procrastinating with a single task, (after breaking it into steps) procure to do just one step at a time, even if it is one per day. Eventually the task will be completed.

Start with simple tasks, washing dishes, sweeping the floor, things that don't require much thinking or planning just get on to doing something first and escalate to more complex things.

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to add, if you can't afford the coffee, which could turn expensive everyday. Get a bottle of water/juice or something. Go to a park, in fact an open space is much better than indoors, but if that's not available either, find a spot where to go, library, food court at the mall, whatever. 

Don't let the location limit the plan.  Worse comes to worst enter a Hospital, find a waiting room inside an public building or anything alike (some even got free water, lol).
