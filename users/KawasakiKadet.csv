“We know not to eat certain foods because it’s illegal and people keep asking where all the other neighbors have been going and why you keep digging holes in your backyard at 3am?”

A.) The customer specifically *asked* the cleaning crew “Hey, when you guys clean the room, can you make sure to leave my special table-pillow and matching table-robe in their places?”    

OR 

B.) The customer came in to the cleaned room and proceeded to **go to the same bed the elephant is on** and grab a single pillow, right before taking off their robe/grabbing the robe from elsewhere.. and then putting both things on the table (because reasons).. and ONLY *after* they had  finished placing their table-toppers, they finally noticed the giant towel/guests-personal-shit/bedding-elephant creation and had to take a picture to share this entertaining random act.. by an employee that cleans the same type of shit from hundreds of rooms a day probably..

unpopularopinion,ff5z1wy,t1_ff5tkls,1579614803.0,"You’re arguing that the minors role in the situation should be considered as a mitigating factor, but the bottom line is that the situation should never progress to ever BECOMING a situation in which mitigating factors are relevant. The adult should always decline and remove themselves from the situation. 

Now - as another person commented here - if it’s a situation where the adult was incapacitated or drugged or forced into a situation out of their control, that’s different and absolutely mitigating factors should be considered.. but other than that, no, I don’t see how ALSO punishing a child/minor is going to help anything at all, when ultimately it should be the ADULT in control of the situation and making the final call to proceed or not. 

The entire point of these laws is to protect children from not only others, but THEMSELVES, because yes.. kids do dumb shit and often have thoughts and urges that aren’t fully thought out or done with much rational thinking or with forward consequences in mind. So your argument that a minor is just as complicit, or just “also complicit,” while technically true from an absolutely objective viewpoint, is completely wrong from a subjective societal position that we’ve adopted with modern laws and overall just morally unsound to imply that punishing a minor for a decision that they made (in a time where they’re biologically at a disadvantage when it comes to rational decision making) is just pointless and vindictive. It really leaves a bad taste in the mouth, almost like it’s saying “Well yeah I fucked that kid, but they wanted it really bad so why aren’t they getting in trouble too?

AskMen,fdgabkf,t3_el8ibg,1578386949.0,"For me personally — I think I’m too damaged to be in a healthy LTR right now. I’ve got some things that I’m working on with myself and my own happiness as an individual, so I think to allow anyone to get caught up in the middle of this process is not only irresponsible and possibly harmful to the woman.. but also it could potentially ruin a relationship that, if pursued at a later time when I feel more stable and healthy mentally/emotionally/etc could actually turn into something serious and long term at some later point in time.. 

So basically, I don’t want to hurt anyone unnecessarily or jump into something serious (just to realize that I don’t want that right now) OR possibly ruin a future LTR that would actually be great once I’m in a better position myself.

I always tell gals I’m open to seeing how things play out, but I’m always very up front and say something along the lines of: 

“I’m not in a place mentally or emotionally where I’m actively seeking a relationship, but Im open to whatever life brings about and trying to approach things in a healthy way with open communication with whoever I get involved with, whether it’s a one time deal, FWBs or possibly something more down the road.. but if you’re looking for someone/thing official right now, I’m not making any commitments for anyone. If you still wanna get to know each other, then awesome and we can take things from there!”

But I’m not sure how common a situation like mine might be. I’d say probably more often than many guys would like to let on.. I think culturally, guys aren’t expected to really take any “down time” to focus on themselves.. they’re either dating/taken or fucking.. nothing much more complex than that. But I think that’s changing and I think more guys are open to.. well, being open.. about their true emotional state and how intimate relationships affect their lives. 

I’ve realized that I was very good at manipulating people I was in relationships in ways that they didn’t know I was manipulating them and I was basically doing things in a way that made them need/want me. I would strategically find ways to be exactly who or what they needed in their life at that point in time for whatever reason.. and because of this, I eventually would get bored and then wonder why we seemed to have fading compatibility or the ‘flame’ between us was dying. I avoided women that I couldn’t read/predict easily.. but in all honestly, those are the only type of women that truly excite me and that I’m sure would actually hold my desire and my respect by their own merits and not this fantasy relationship that I tried to create.

But in order to put myself out there and build something meaningful with a woman holding those attributes, I first have to figure out whatever attributes of mine have become habitual or present in my behaviors that will be damaging to the type of woman that truly sees me for who I am, and not the character I invent for the purpose of a relationship."

AskReddit,fd1g7n7,t3_ejupot,1578130961.0,"To expand/clarify as much as possible right off the bat.. (since I’m sure many people are going to immediately try to find loopholes or point out flaws based on things I didn’t cover..)

What I mean is basically assume that humanity has progressed to a point where technology, medical science, genetic biology, engineering capabilities, etc, etc, etc.. ALLL of the fields that would be factors in this situation are basically developed and advanced enough to do what I’m proposing without any sort of short-comings that would distort and/or prevent any of the process(es.)

Now, with that assumption, let’s say that we (you, me, a group of weird scientists, a crazy, DMT-fueled (but perfectly healthy) couple with a God-complex) ended up becoming pregnant with twins.. Then, through modern science, both of these twins were genetically modified to have 100% identical DNA, brain mass/size/structure/whatever, physical traits, etc in every considerable aspect of their being. They are 100% the same in every way.

So, after they’ve been born, we place them each into their own respective ‘environment’ that is essentially a completely functional, interactive, entirely immersive world that encompasses all facilities/items/people/etc of *EVERY* single possible situation or occurrence that exists. Literally identical and impossible to distinguish from reality for the person inside, if not previously made aware of this circumstance. From the moment of their birth, both of their environments are controlled and adapted in the exact same way, so that they both do the same things, eat the same food, watch the same tv, have the same routines and habits and so on.. you get it..

Let’s assume this continued for 25 years.. Would you say that they’re effectively clones of each other? Or do you think that — despite literally everything in their entire lives being identical and occurring at the exact same time — they could still each have original thoughts that the other one doesn’t have?

I’m sure I’m not explaining this very well at all, but essentially I’m really curious how much people think that genetics play a role in the creation of our person-hood or our “soul,” I guess you could say.. Cause if both twins are 100% identical in every way to the point that they were incapable of having original thoughts or actions.. then you’ve basically erased any illusion of free-will. On the other hand, the chances of running two concurrent, identical environments in complete unity with absolute perfection without some sort of minor deviation due to complete chance or something is, for all intents and purposes, impossible.. 

But if it did happen.. and then one day, they were both released into the natural world.. would you argue that they’re both different people the second they step out into real life and begin having interactions and experiences that differ from the others? Their paths have been 100% parallel up until now, where they begin to fork.. so are they now different people, in that instant, because they will now have differing exposure and memories? 

Or have they always been different people? And if that’s the case.. why? What makes someone a “person,” if not for their unique experiences and memories and the entire culmination of their experiences, constantly reshaping and building their personality and influencing their choices. 

Anyway.. If you stuck this out and read all the way to the end, I apologize for any damaged brain cells that may have occurred in trying to understand what the fuck I’m talking about. I promise it makes sense in my head. Hopefully it does in at least some other people’s as well.

Soooooo tell me your view on the issue! Or yell at me and tell me I’m intellectually challenged.. can’t take any of it back now, so lesssssgggoooo."

Sorry, I couldn’t resist.. my friend and I always call each other, things, people, etc “artistic,” instead of “autistic,” — mainly to see if other people notice and if they do catch it, to see how they react to it.. it’s pretty entertaining usually. Random, I know.. just thought I’d share."

Especially considering I didn’t “take it seriously,” unless you consider a few minutes of exchanging text messages - mainly for the purpose of seeing where the convo went - to be super “serious” business. In which case, I guess I did take it seriously and this guy totally trolled me hardcore. Him calling me four times in a row ~20 minutes after I stopped replying to him definitely screams “lol totally messing with this guy and he’s falling for it,” instead of ‘dumb C.B. realizes his lame offers and shallow threats aren’t actually getting him anywhere and now he’s regretting his approach.’

But you’re the expert.. so I guess I’ll text him and congratulate him on successfully trolling me and making me waste so much of my srsbizness-energy on such an obvious charade."
ChoosingBeggars,fctmll9,t1_fctlsg1,1577949074.0,"Absolutely. I often get anywhere from 10 to 50% off my groceries every time I go to Walmart, because I refuse to pay or move out of the checkout line until my demands to speak to the manager are met.. 

At which point, I inform them of the perilous journey I had to make — all the way from my house in the barren wilderness of the Arctic Pole — to their beach-front property (because it’s the closest Walmart to me with an Applebee’s next door.) I tell them that realistically, the time and money I’ve spent to shop at their store should entitle me to a 100% discount and *then some,* but since I’m generous and like support small businesses, I will accept a lower discount. 

At this point, the total price amount & general behavior of the staff is the determining factor in deciding to pay anywhere from 90% to 50% of the total, with hesitation, excuses or rudeness pushing me towards the 50% mark. 

If no pepper spray is used, I’ll usually end up paying 80% or so. If they call the cops, that automatically puts them at 50%. If I’m actually arrested, then they lose my business for life.. which I imagine ultimately means the location closes shortly after that happens. 

Only once have I actually paid 90% and that was because I didn’t even have to checkout.. This toddler that they had employed at this particular location simply motioned me towards the door and waved goodbye, obviously recognizing my status and knowing that I was undoubtedly good for whatever the price might be.. I dropped a $100 bill at the door, which I assume was well over 90% of the total bill, considering I had only filled two shopping carts during this specific trip. 

I still haven’t received any sort of thank you note for the gratuitous gesture, but I don’t do it for the recognition, so I’m letting it go..

ChoosingBeggars,fctkaq2,t1_fctjdrp,1577946335.0,"You mean like.. how do we get it in this format, so that it’s long and shows all the messages without multiple separate photos?

Well, at least in my case, I took 4 different screenshots to get all the different text bubbles involved.. then I edited each of them individually to crop out any of the parts that overlap/repeat between each screenshot.

For example if [photo 1] ends with:

“Blah Blah blah blah.. 

So then blah blah..”


And [photo 2] starts:

“So then blah blah blah.. 

Because he blah blah blah..”

I would crop out the bottom of [photo 1] right *below* the first sentence and crop the top of [photo 2] right *above* the first sentence.. so that when they’re stitched together/stacked on top of each other in order.. you get one continuous sentence: 


“Blah Blah blah blah.. 

So then blah blah..

Because he blah blah blah..”

Make sense? Kinda hard to explain via text, but hopefully that gives you a decent idea.. if you search “photo stitch” or something along those lines in the App Store/Play Store, you’ll find an app that works - even the free ones work perfectly as long as you’re willing to do a little extra work. 

Like the app I used only lets you add 3 photos/pics together with the free version.. but I had 4 pics total. So I added (pic 1 + pic 2 + pic 3) together, which = (pic 123), saved that to my gallery, then started over and added the new one (pic 123) with the final one (pic 4), so (pic 123+pic 4) — which then leaves you with the final product of (pic 1234) as a singular pic.

Sorry for the lengthy reply, but hopefully that makes it pretty clear what I’m talking about and how to do it."
ChoosingBeggars,fcte5ko,t1_fctcerp,1577940391.0,I shouldn’t have to explain it because it should be pretty obvious considering normal screenshots aren’t anywhere NEAR that long.. common sense is apparently in short supply these days.

The photo *IS* edited! But NOT in the way that you think you’re “exposing” it as.. 

If you hadn’t noticed, this picture is very looooonngg; normal photos/screenshots are NOT this long. So how did mine get so long, you might be wondering? The answer is - a photo-stitching app! Yes, exactly like it sounds, the purpose of the app is to ‘stitch’ multiple photos together to make them into one photo. 

So, for the sake of neatness and streamlined viewing, I took a whole 3 minutes to crop/cut off the repeating/overlapping portions of the conversation that were in each of the 4 original screenshots.. then I uploaded them into the app and stitched them together.

That’s all. End. Donezo. No mas. Terminado. So yes, the text bubbles DO “look like it was cut off” or “like someone copied text over the bubble,” because — its 4 pictures put together/overlapping, because I don’t have a phone with a meter-long screen that can take giant screenshots.. 

There’s even a nifty little logo/watermark at the bottom of the picture in two places - one where I fused the first 3 photos (max number you can add together in the free app) and then the second watermark below that where I fused the 4th and final photo to the newly-created combo photo that I had made just prior.

So, sorry to disappoint.. no other editing has taken place here and you’re definitely nowhere near the first person to notice whatever you noticed that made you think you were about to unveil some conspiracy.. so please stop messaging me and calling me all sorts of lovely names, making equally lovely claims about the wrongdoings that you’ve imagined I’ve committed.

Thank ya much."
