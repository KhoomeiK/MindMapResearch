I feel like it’s something very personal and I don’t like an audience when I’m having a spiritual journey, so I make sure my room is extremely safe (like no sharp objects or metal etc) and I’ll lock the door. I don’t remember how I got to my door but I caught myself fiddling with the handle, I guess I had forgotten it was locked, but it definitely helped me realize the situation and went to go sit back down. If I hadn’t locked it I’d probably walk somewhere and not have realized it."

news,fcdo4l3,t1_fcdm7vw,1577611885.0,"I think I’m understanding. So minimum wage would just be the minimum requirement that local business or companies would have to meet to pay their employees.... ? And it has no correlation with more money needed to be “made” in order to keep up, rather business owners would have to find ways to meet and maintain the requirements to pay their workers.

So I was thinking, if everyone’s getting 15 an hour for minimum wage then more money needs to be produced to keep up with all the money that’s now being produced for labor and then prices will go up due to inflation because of high amounts of money being distributed?? That’s why it’s expensive to live in California, but minimum wage is high to keep up with it, but in VA it’s less expensive because minimum wage is lower. So it evens out? This is so confusing lol."

beauty,fc7gzxg,t3_eglkq6,1577507162.0,"Waxing removes the entire hair strand, with the root attached, where shaving cuts the hair strand just at the surface of the skin. So, if you get a wax the hair starts the regrowth cycle entirely, where as shaving just slices the hair and leaves a blunt end to the hair strand. Shaving also doesn’t make hair grow thicker, that’s a myth. It just appears that way since the hair now has a blunt end instead of a pointed one."
