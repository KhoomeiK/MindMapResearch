socialanxiety,fe0rt3q,t3_enhn99,1578817868.0,"Being a ""nice"" person was one of my facade to cope up. I genuinely liked to help others whenever I can. Some teachers like me but never really got close to anyone. Now I can see why aside from being a target of bullying. I shut myself from others like showing no opinion on anything, etc.

Its hard to put down walls that previously serve me well but it's better to come in terms to myself. No longer had to force myself to be an extrovert when I'm introverted. People do really notice if you are being authentic or not. And this has been helpful in my case and made my close friend in years. Still have SA though."
socialanxiety,fdsdbk9,t3_emst6p,1578700039.0,"Verbal bullying in elementary contributed a great deal to my anxiety. Unlike physical bullying its never taken seriously by the authorities. I'm just told to ignore them or their just jealous of me because of being the smart kid (and for having weird interests) in class. But it's easier said than done. The feeling of being unwelcome is a bad feeling. I felt people either had great respect for me but never being friends with anyone  or outright hated me. I bet rumors about me spread then.

Bullying ended in high school but was constantl depressed on top of the anxiety. Things got better eventually but still socially anxious. Learning to demolish the walls of mistrust I put up to be able to genuinely connect with others."

socialanxiety,fdp3hcn,t3_emdgfo,1578619112.0,"Me too, when I'm alone I could laugh at internet memes, jokes and puns but when out in public I can't do it. Only a smile at best"
socialanxiety,fdiin9q,t3_eleuqx,1578443765.0,"Most probably the bullying and ostracization, compensated by getting doing well in school but social anxiety worsened in high school when socialization and connecting with others becomes more important."
socialanxiety,fddtzbj,t3_ekt9mn,1578323924.0,"Imo that's alright. I'm the one who usually do the PowerPoint presentations and theres another person/s who do the presenting. It's an absolute win for all parties given that all contributed somehow.

That is until the the teacher requires everyone to present   one by one portions of the group's presentation. Then that becomes problematic since the presentation has a tendency to become incoherent. Some parts will be presented well while other parts not so much."
socialanxiety,fddgblw,t1_fddbdkj,1578311019.0,"Yeah, I can relate to the feeling, I made sure that they know I had time to recharge since I'm an introvert which is separate from being having SA. I can feel clingy at times, good thing I learned how to manage my feelings of doubt and envy. Heck I learned many things from my first close friendship in years."
socialanxiety,fddauz4,t1_fdd9gih,1578303130.0,"Putting walls is a nice way to summarize this feeling. Having past terrible experience in school caused this and I also had this ""me against the world"" going on in my head until college too. So I tried to consciously change this to move away from being the stoic bland guy.

Good luck on your new job too. Thanks to my efforts to open myself up. I managed to make a good friend at work though there are still walls. Even non-anxious people put up walls as I learn from this friend, they were frustrated one time being unable to connect with others. They are the bubbly extroverted type who can appreciate some quiet time. And that I guess it means progress for me. Having hard connecting with my other colleagues still. Learning to set up boundaries rather than walls atm. Just sharing my experience. 

And again good luck with your new job."
socialanxiety,fdd9dfy,t1_fdd8erb,1578300909.0,Or do a gesture like covering your mouth briefly. But sometimes anxiety does really affect one response to a joke. But not always.
socialanxiety,fdd8514,t1_fdc0ax7,1578299138.0,Some NPCs initiate such as trainers walking in circles in Pok√©mon games. When they see the player they don't hesitate to challenge the player to a battle.
socialanxiety,fdd7q1w,t3_ekl14d,1578298560.0,"""Beware the silent ones"" they say. That's why I hate it when they had to say about this about serial killers/school shooters."
socialanxiety,fdd7dc2,t3_eklymg,1578298085.0,"No way, plus I also fear legitly shady people like conmen, cult recruiters and mlm salespeople approaching me. Or it's just me catatrophizing."
socialanxiety,fcy81yl,t3_ejaf4k,1578076099.0,"My heart shrinks whenever I hear that when presenting. I don't know if my anxiety distorts the perception of my own voice. While from my perspective I sound audible enough but admittedly it isn't that ""smooth"" enough like I can sense anxiety creeping in."
socialanxiety,fcy76rx,t3_ej8for,1578075803.0,"I hate this, whether back in school or at work. I constantly worry what to say. In this case I likely would stand awkwardly pretending to find someone to introduce myself to.

Its no better to be told to introduce ourselves one by one in front of class. Its not that hard to just say my name but usually you are asked to tell something interesting like a hobby which makes me nervous.

I worry if I say something is too boring or cliche. I decided to listen sometime and noticed that people aren't really that interested in these kind of stuff and would rather prefer to get over these kind of gimmick asap. So I gave up and just say generic bland hobby that some other person also said. 

People really learn more about each other outside these shallow interaction which unfortunately is a challenge of its own for people with SA."
socialanxiety,fcw2wj8,t3_ej5d69,1578015896.0,"The admiration for Komi by her classmates is surreal and probably exagerrated though I imagine Komi actually having no real friends prior to Tadano, only admirers, does not do her any favor."
socialanxiety,fcw1bpe,t1_fcutqj9,1578014859.0,"I feel you, in my case at least its probably due to my past experiences so people would not find anything to ""use"" against me. It's either I'm an anxious mess or a stoic cold distant person. Though this has been by bothering me in the recent years. By not making myself vulnerable I have limited opportunities to connect wihh people."
socialanxiety,fcw0tf7,t1_fcvpsn0,1578014524.0,I can relate to this struggle. So I worked hard to be able to continue the conversation when I'm asked as much as possible. So far I'm able to do this but starting a conversation with a group is still a mountain to climb for me and I find myself listening to a conversation as I walk behind the group.
socialanxiety,fcw0g7i,t3_ej4a53,1578014285.0,"An issue of mine is they seem to have their own groups. I find it hard to enter an existing circle and I haven't manage to ever do it yet. In groups I find it hard to influence the flow of the conversation and I just get relegated to the background.

Also another challenge is I'm craving for deeper relationships. I want to get pass the ""small talk"" phase and this is even harder in a group setting."
socialanxiety,fcphb54,t1_fcovyr7,1577864043.0,"My SA is situational, I think when presenting in a  public speaking class is different than just having a casual interaction with your classmates. This is more on performance anxiety than SA though I sometimes worry about my voice not being loud enough.

 I aced a presentation once when we had an opportunity to pick any topic for our public speaking class so talking about something you are passionate about and at the same time to fulfill an academic requirement does wonders.

I still dread the introduce yourself spiels which unfortunately is still present in the office since it is more personal (often they encourage telling one of your hobbies) which I think in this cases SA affects me more."
socialanxiety,fcpgq1p,t3_ei9wor,1577863270.0,"Good thing, back when I was studying, we had assigned seats and pretty much stayed on the same classroom. So no need for such attendance roll call.

But college was different, there are some professor usually had to call each of our names  at the beginning. And it takes courage to utter ""present"" while raising my hand. My heart would ache if it wasn't loud enough."
socialanxiety,fcmi84d,t1_fcm625m,1577776299.0,"Same, unless there some kind of authority figure. Though for some reason I'm usually not good with kids and people my age."
socialanxiety,fcmi1r9,t1_fcmguzf,1577776092.0,"That was blunt lol. Though I prefer to view the customers, others as NPCs. It really does wonders when you remind yourself what you are doing is for ""business-only"". May not work for all and this doesn't work for me when ""socializing"" with colleagues."
socialanxiety,fcmhv12,t1_fclzdjw,1577775874.0,Yeah it moved me. It's a whiplash of emotions and could relate with the female lead. While normally I would not be sympathetic to the male lead's bullying his redemption is really something.
socialanxiety,fcksidy,t3_ehnozg,1577732238.0,"I used to thought this too. But may not be necessarily the fact. Like I know what is appropriate to say in a situation and I can discern if others are are saying inappropriate to others but SA disables me from actually picking the ""right"" option.

If this is a visual novel game the appropriate option for the ""good end"" would be disabled/unselectable. So sometimes I do come across as someone socially inept."
socialanxiety,fck4hsr,t1_fck2ia3,1577716338.0,"I think so, OP getting good grades and helping with the chores. Though gaming addiction can come from many forms such as compulsive spending on microtransaction. Though I feel part of OP feels they would use the time spent in gaming in more productive stuff but that is just me assuming."
socialanxiety,fck46ho,t1_fcjxk4o,1577716074.0,"Oh, can't comment since I dont play those games myself but I know them. There household titles. Nothing wrong about it. Why do you think you have gaming addiction though?

On a lighter note, are you more into games for the gameplay or the story?"
socialanxiety,fcjyoh9,t1_fcjvqew,1577710763.0,"Lol, but seriously Naruto connected to me to some level. The isolation of Naruto early on the series as well as Gaara due to having a tailed beast inside of them. Not exactly SA but still...  other characters such as Sai and Kakashi. Too bad the the series imo overextended itself. Others are household name but can't comment since I didn't watch them as much."

socialanxiety,fcjoaas,t3_egtqlt,1577696358.0,"I think I was really shy when I was young unless when I'm talking about my interest and can be a bit competitive at times. 

What messed me was the bullying I endured in class and in the school bus. It was nasty gaslighting and malicious name calling and they made sure to make me feel I'm unwelcomed. I was ridiculed for being weird. School authorities don't care unless it went physical and I was scolded for standing up to myself just because I was caught retaliating physically. Looking back, I thought it was a cry for help that was basically ignored. I overcompensate by doing good in school but never had a meaningful friendship.

High school came, and my SA worsened. I subconsciously made myself ""boring"" so that people had no ''ammo"" to use against me and put up a wall and my urge to make friends grew at the same time. The bullying thankfully stopped but damage has been done People said I was guarded but the same defense mechanism prevented me from becoming vulnerable in a way people have a way to reach me and form bonds.

Its gets better though. Even after college, where in my part of the world is pretty much a necessity to have a good life, SA still affect me in some way."
socialanxiety,fcjneke,t3_ehio9l,1577695118.0,"It's good thing you acknowledge the problem. I too had a gaming addiction as some sort of escape from SA.

I would compensate myself by doing well in school back when my SA isn't preventing me from reciting in class thanks to me reading my textbooks and other academic books back in childhood. Other than that video games was my best friend though I was more addicted to single player games than online/multi-player games since I had no friends and wasn't interested with shooter games that was popular back then in my area. I'm more into RTS and simulator games. The multi-player games tend to involve a lot of trash talking and cursing. Call me sensitive but it's not my thing.

What kind of game do you play OP? Though addiction is definitely a bad thing, no need to quit gaming altogether. It could be managed but I understand it would be easier said than done and there is no one-size fit all solution."
socialanxiety,fcjmyiu,t3_ehir4w,1577694509.0,"Mindfulness is something that helped. I noted how I react when I do interact with people. Like I do acknowledge my feelings of anxiety instead of denying it at least internally. I try to rationalize my negative thoughts and try to remind myself like how people are not mind readers. I also try to observe other people interact. I'm working on it at least. There is no magic pill. I sometimes still succumb to SA, like ruminating on blunders or lambasting myself for being a mere ""observer""

Also taking time to know yourself gave me some confidence that I'm not a boring person and that every person is unique in their own way. MBTI, enneagram, or even those what X are you type of quiz. I know some question the scientific validity of such test but it's thearuepetic at least to me and you will sometimes disagree with the results.

I slowly trying to accept my introverted nature which is not synonymous for having SA. Sometimes it's just okay to enjoy by yourself. In the past I loathed myself more for not being an extrovert. I realize I'm fine not befriending the whole class/office but sometimes I still crave more meaningful bonds."
socialanxiety,fcjerv6,t3_egw00w,1577685003.0,"It depends on the person really. Though, the bigger the group I tend to freeze up. When it's a close friend, still anxious but I can still had meaningful conversation with them. As more people gets add in the group I fall to the shadows.

But if its with a colleague or a not so close friend. It's just as worse. Like when I'm with a close friend and their friend who is not close to me, and my close friend temporarily leaves us. The situation quickly becomes awkward and I can feel the other person either being clueless how to engage with me or just doing their thing."
socialanxiety,fcjcxh7,t3_ehheds,1577683355.0,"Yes, when I'm alone I ruminate on dark thoughts on how I suck at connecting people and making fri nds. But with other people I worry coming across as boring who don't contribute anything in the table. There is a time for being a ""good listener"". 

Otherwise, I do like being alone, just drinking coffee and browsing reddit."
anime_irl,fcja94u,t3_ehaems,1577681183.0,"Actually they do, whole of Asia Pacific has their own set of names their typhoons. Though their are Chinese, Tagalog, Thai, etc names throw in the mix. And some names are adjectives rather than person names. The Philippines has their own set of names, most of which are person names.

Though this is Japan, I bet someone already turned typhoons to waifus (and husbandos) already..."
