$1230 if you max out a Falcon launch with 22.8 ton. It's $62 M for one launch to LEO. Did I do that math right? Lots of decimal points.

https://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities

But really it depends on other factors as well. Falcons would be better for higher density payloads. For example 22.8 ton of water wouldn't fit in the payload bay. If you want to go farther, like to Mars, you have only about a quarter tha payload mass. If you want to launch ultralight payloads you'd need to find enough friends to share a payload bay with you.

Or you could use a different rocket, like an Electron and pay $6M for 150kg. So $1800 per pound?

Newsworthiness already exists as an exception. Journalists already can show protected images in their broadcasts.

Sports isn't much of a problem either. Everyone on the team would just sign an agreement to be recorded. If the crowd shots are necessary and can identify people, then you can put that requirement into the ticket sale contract.

Recording people committing crimes is more interesting. But in order to pursue the claim they'd have to agree that it was them in the video. That's probably not something they'd want to do unless the crime was so minor that the photography violation was even more severe. Also people could claim that videos of crimes are newsworthy even if not broadcast by a registered journalist. So the question here is going to be what newsworthiness is and what the press is. If I post photos of kids being bullies at my neighborhood park (something I've seen posted before in neighborhood groups) is that an example of a neighborhood crime that is newsworthy to share with the local audience? How about positive stories, like if I post photos of a kid being nice at the park instead?"

So I would say tentatively yes from a space planning perspective, but it may turn out that living underground is pretty unhealthy without some serious study going into it to design spaces that provide the same stimuli that we need.

But, even if we did that, creating underground space is very expensive, so cities would end up being way more space efficient. But may cities already are great models of how to live that densely, e.g. Paris. So if we were going to live as densely as Paris, why not just design a Paris-modeled city on the surface. It would be one or two orders of magnitude more space efficient than current suburbs and exurbs, meaning that our ecological impact would be massively reduced just by doing that already.

YangForPresidentHQ,feesmla,t1_feen8ue,1579040339.0,"The article claims that the Sanders created the organization, yes this is an easily verifiable fact. Similarly many others close to Sanders have worked there, yes again. 

The article does not claim how closely the current Sanders campaign interacts with Our Revolution. This is a question of fact which no significant evidence is provided either way, but may not be too difficult to collect by an investigator. I'm not sure how much public information there is in this regard.

The article further claims that in its opinion Our Revolution is a SuperPAC though it appears likely that the FEC won't agree. This is speculation by the author. Perhaps it is correct. I don't know enough about the legal definitions to say.

The article states that SuperPACs are not allowed to coordinate with candidates, which is again an easily verified law. 

The article then states that because Our Revolution is a SuperPAC it is not allowed to coordinate with the Sanders campaign. The premise is based on speculation but the conclusion would follow if the premise is true.

The article says that Sanders disavows big money donations like dark money SuperPACs. This is an easily verifiable fact in regards to Sanders' statements, and we have no evidence to suggest it isn't privately true as well.

The article concludes that therefore Our Revolution is likely committing campaign finance violations. This premise is again based on the speculation, which is fair enough.

The article then says that even if all the speculation is true, and if the organization appears to be violating the statutes and regulations that the FEC probably won't care as it appears to be caring less more recently. This then gets into the semantics of what legality is, since violating a statute that isn't enforced by the other two branches of government may not be considered illegal.

But in any case, if Our Revolution is acting as a SuperPAC but aren't registered as one, this could be illegal but also not suggest that Sanders is actually doing something illegal, as he is no longer part of the organization.

As a side argument, it can be argued that Sanders is being a hypocrite by allowing Our Revolution to help him, even if it isn't illegal. But if he isn't coordinating with them, there's no way for him to ask them to stop. And if he did ask them to stop, then he'd be potentially coordinating with a political action group.

The article does mention some examples which it presumably considers are Sanders coordinating with Our Revolution. For example, Sanders was on a conference call for their birthday party. But does this actually count as illegal coordination? I don't know, but politicians do tons of events where they tell organizations that they appreciate the work they are doing. I imagine the difference is whether Our Revolution counts as a SuperPAC or not. If Sanders went to a local river cleanup and told them they're an awesome community organization, then of course that would be fine."

Hopefully Our Revolution isn't doing anything illegal, but also it's plenty problematic on its face that the situation even exists where this is possible.

Not sure why you're downvoted for a solid question. kW is how much energy is produced in one instant, kWh is the integral of that. So you could produce one kWh in one hour with a one kW generator. Or you could produce it in ten minutes with a ten kW generator.

Water is the common analogy to electricity. kWh you buy from the power company like you buy gallons of water. If you want 25gal (kWh), it will take you 10 minutes on a common shower head for example at 2.5gal/min (kW). So kW is the flow rate while kWh is the total quantity of power buckets you want. The units are kinda confusing here since they don't exactly match to compare them.

Both of these numbers matter to a generator of course. For example if a solar panel produces 11kW at noon, that means it produces 11kWh from 12 to 1pm (ish). but at 1pm maybe it produces 10kW, so that's 10kWh from 1 to 2pm. Over the day an 11kW solar panel may produce 66kWh of power because the sun isn't consistently at its noon height. Theoretically that panel could produce 11kW x 24h is 264kWh if it was in sun all day, but it only produces a quarter of that in real use."

Electronic voting machines that are paperless are literally impossible to trust. I agree totally.

We have the ability to design the ballot to look like whatever we want. But yes we shouldn't just allow any random design. Yes there are lots of terribly designed ballots. But if we paid people to design the ballots properly, we would mitigate that issue. Good design isn't necessarily complex design, I agree.

There are very similar advantages for an individual or a university to want to cheat on their evaluations (and appear better qualified so as to recieve a financial benefit) as there are for a congressional candidate to want to cheat or for a third party to want to cheat to get a certain candidate selected.

It would be subtle so that there would be no way to verify the result, but it could be plenty in a particular swing location.

Don't draw the random numbers until after the election, so nobody could possibly know which boxes and which machines would be tested (to hack the other ones).

Worst case, the machines are useless, and we just manual count the paper ballots, which is exactly where we started anyway, so all we lost was a tiny amount of time.
