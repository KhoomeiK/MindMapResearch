gaming,fdpw4di,t3_emlcsf,1578642951.0,"Cool, some guy who has no idea of the marketing strategy goes and whips some really quick photoshop candy and he’s amazing and the Sony marketing group are idiots. 

The design team working for Sony has plenty of people who can whip these out easy but they end up pinned to the wall at stage 1 with 100 other cool sketches. 

They’re not planning to sell you a t-shirt or a cool wallpaper, it’s all part of a massive worldwide strategy where they’ve talked and talked about the decisions they’ve made and all the work and ideas and cool mock-ups are stuffed somewhere we’ll all never hear about. 

This guy may be very talented but there are a million home Photoshop wizards who are at home making dream logos and not flat out at work working on real projects. That’s why their portfolios are on Dribbble and Instagram."

It’s not as if car manufacturers realise that some people are never going to stop drinking and driving so might come up with a compromise. Full concentration should be on driving. The UK Highway Code still classes hands-free sets as distracting. So what car manufacturers may do and what the law may do are two different things."
