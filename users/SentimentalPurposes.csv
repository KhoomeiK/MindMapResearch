Yep, this is something I worry about as well.

In general cleaning is hard for me because I feel like I'm just spreading germs around and like collecting them all in this one washcloth I'm using and then not to mention the fears I'll absorb cleaning chemicals through my skin... 🤦‍♀️ I honestly cannot believe how much I find a way to overthink something as simple as cleaning but I do.

If my friend goes on about whatever they're excited about for 10 minutes straight and then allows me to spend 10 minute talking about what I'm excited about, I'm cool.

I sincerely do not understand why y'all are okay with the idea that the whole purpose of existence is to glorify God. Like no offense but it makes God seem really ego-obsessed and selfish, like nothing else matters to him but being worshipped. We're all suffering down here, babies die of cancer, billions of animals die in wildfires, but it's all good cause God has a plan... For everyone to either worship him or suffer for eternity? Like our only value to him is to worship him, he doesn't love us for who we are because if we don't worship him he designed a system where we suffer for eternity. It seems like the very definition of conditional love. 

I don't understand why it's seen as a good and loving thing when it sounds so narcissistic. Shouldn't a loving God care more about his creation than himself?

dankchristianmemes,fesii2q,t1_fers8wl,1579365545.0,"To explain the angry, ""edgy"" athiests in the sub: A lot of people who have been harmed by religion post there and they are looking to vent. Yes, sometimes religion is a tool used for good. Sometimes it clothes the poor and feeds the hungry. Sometimes it brings people peace and comfort. 

But other times it's used to frighten, shame, and control vulnerable people, including children. Sometimes it's used as a weapon to cause harm and ask victims of abuse to practice tolerance towards their abuser and let down all their boundaries for how they ought be treated. Sometimes it's used to justify heinous abuse happening at home or in the Church. Sometimes it brings people *decades* of trauma, isolation, and extreme fear. And by sometimes, I mean this is a reality for hundreds of thousands of people, potentially millions. Especially in the American South where more extreme fundamentalists tend to pop up. Many, many people are abused in Christian homes and the religion is an essential part of that abuse. It is used against them. You have a VERY different experience of Christianity and a church community than these people do. 

Those type of people are tired of others worshipping and idealizing something (the religion itself) that has brought so much pain into their lives and the world at large. It's hurtful to them and they need a place to vent and let out their anger. It's important to the healing process that they let out this bottled up resentment. 

I know it can be off-putting to Christians to hear such strong language against their religion, but most of the edgy type athiests (and please remember I'm talking about the very angry, crude people- not the majority of athiests who just feel no need to speak about it, or speak about it rationally, not everyone was traumatized) are deeply hurt and just trying to process their experiences. Most come out on the other side still an athiest but less angry and less ""edgy"". They just need some time to work through the trauma first."

dankchristianmemes,fdnte3h,t1_fdnt33h,1578592455.0,"You're saying an all-powerful God couldn't figure out a way to give us free will without condemning billions of people to an eternity of torture? I'm sorry... That just doesn't make sense to me. Either God is all-powerful or he isn't. It's not like this is out of his hands. He controls everything. He created the concept of sin, the concept of eternal torture, and he didn't have to. He could have made a different system. He's ""saving"" us from a Hell HE created. If he actually loved his creation and wanted to keep them from being eternally tortured, all he had to do was not create the concept of Hell"
dankchristianmemes,fdnsn0t,t1_fdnsbq6,1578592022.0,"Yes, but everything is part of God's plan, right? Or at the very least he knows everything that will happen. He knew man would fall. He knew he created flawed beings. He knew they would sin. He knew people would be condemned to an eternity of torture because of their sinful nature. He knew Adam and Eve were dooming BILLIONS of people he claims to love, and yet he did nothing to prevent it. In fact he put the tree right in front of them, knowing the Devil would trick them. Even before he created them, he knew all this. And yet he still persisted, he allowed billions of people to be condemned to Hell by one small move on the Devil's part. Why would he do that when he is all-powerful and could devise any system he wanted? Or do you not ascribe to the idea that he is all-powerful?"
dankchristianmemes,fdnryto,t1_fdnr99e,1578591632.0,"The Bible literally states that humans are inherently sinful. That means we *are* in fact being punished for being human. God created us to be a certain way, he gave us a sinful nature, and then chose to cast people into eternal flames for being the way he created them to be? It makes no sense, not if you truly believe God is loving, all-powerful, and all-knowing. 

This is just gonna have to be something we disagree on. I was raised Southern Baptist and I already know everything you're going to say and have already rejected it. I'm still a spiritual person but I do NOT believe the Bible to be anything even close to inerrant. It's been used as a tool of propaganda and population control for centuries and it is quite clearly tainted by man justifying their own atrocities (ie OT ""God"" commanding people to commit genocide). That's what I believe. I still respect you as a person and wish the best for you, though. Have a good one."

Let's say I come up behind you one day and stick a gun to the back of your head. I say, ""Listen, kid. You're a bad person. You were born bad. But I can fix you. I can make you better. All you have to do is follow everything I say exactly, and never question anything, and accept that I'm your God now. This is your choice of course, I would never take away your free will. I'm super loving and kind in that way. But I do have to warn you, if you say no, this gun will go off. It's out of my control, really, just the way things are. But still. Don't let that affect your decision making process, really search your heart and decide what you want to do.""

Would you feel like you had genuine free will in that situation? Or would you feel like a hostage?"

Also in your religion so long as this dude decides to accept Jesus in prison, he's going to Heaven. That's all it takes to erase the bad of MURDER. Yet the good is erased over something so much more arbitrary like a lack of belief? Even in absent of heinous acts such a rape and murder? 

That's not justice."

StarWarsCantina,fdnl9a0,t1_fdn4gwf,1578588153.0,I think the reason they give in a cannon short story (in *From a Certain Point of View*)  was that they didn't want to have to deal with all the paperwork it would require or something? I know they've fleshed it out a bit more.

And what about other types of leaders? In businesses, government, etc. Is it the leadership that's affording this privellege or something else?"
exchristian,fdkfdwe,t1_fdk6gb1,1578502700.0,These people have a very real influence on politics in America. It's a very privelleged stance to say you wish they would go back to being openly discriminatory when I'm guessing things like their lobbying against gay marriage and adoption for gay couples don't affect you personally. Not to mention all the gay kids being brought up as Christians who will be deeply harmed if the anti-gay attitude persists. It does real harm in this world even if it doesn't impact you personally
