I randomly had one pop up on my farm but I only saw it at the full size so I don't know if it starts out at a smaller size? Also I read your tip above about getting the best chance to propagate more. I'm not sure if I understood correctly. If I leave a bunch of trees (not fruit) growing on my farm (with NO tappers on them) then there's a better chance of them popping up in fall? Thanks for posting!

Edit: crap I replied all wrong lol. OP didn't post the propagation comment it was u/bigben01985
