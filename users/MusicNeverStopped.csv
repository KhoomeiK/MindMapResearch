entwives,fe0bx27,t3_en9h1g,1578809154.0,"I had a boyfriend of four years who was anti-drugs, so I snuck around with the pot use. The relationship ended for other reasons, but after that I decided part of my selection criteria would be that the guy either supports my use or doesn't care about it. Not an issue I wanted to deal with again.. DH and I have a couple of issues, but that's not one of them. :-)

If that's who you are and that's who you want to be, keep being you!"

Personal steam inhaler as desired - pretty much instant relief. Good for colds and stuffy nose. too. I like Vicks personal steam inhaler.

Humidifier at night before and during sleep. Can use all day in any room, too, if you want."

gratefuldead,fcwmjmv,t3_ej8ncu,1578029862.0,"My favorite Wavy Gravy quote was from when he was emceeing Gathering of the Vibes during or after one of the downpours that became usual for the festival every year. He said, ""There's no such thing as bad weather, just bad dressing for weather."" That's when I learned to put a plastic bag over each of my socked feet before putting them in my shoes for rainy outdoor shows, like he said he did while growing up. Keeps my feet warm and dry."
