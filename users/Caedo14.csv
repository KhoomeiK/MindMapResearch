toptalent,ff6o8ia,t3_ertian,1579631408.0,She won because of technique. He is obviously stronger out of the gate. But you can see in the video that he doesnt keep his wrist straight. He lets her bend her wrist away from the pressure which is right when she takes momentum. Then she fixes her grip on his hand and takes it down. Technique is better than strength in most things.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff6k329,t1_ff6icu2,1579628886.0,"Worldstar predates tyler perry movies. By only a few months. They literally both came out in 2005. 

I get what youre saying, but there have been countless movies that portray black people negatively before madea. Madea is just who was popular at the time. Doesnt change the fact that i still dont care about the opinions of poor white trash. The smartest thing a president ever did was when they convinced poor whites that even tho they were poor at least they werent black. That ensured that poor whites would never support poor blacks to make everyones life better. And it still works today. Theres a redneck out there right now putting on a Klan mask and he doesnt have a pot to piss in while im here worth millions and hes not worth my time to speak to. My kids will never go to school with his because he cant afford private school. He cant afford the clubs im in and he cant afford to live in my city limits. Those arent the people that scare me or make me feel less than."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff6gtwq,t1_ff63j8f,1579626897.0,"“I think those movies did more to encourage racism than any other media property”

Thats not realistic at all. The actual media in the real world has done more to paint black people in a negative light than any movie could. 

No movie will change racists. Theyre racist because they are ignorant or choose to be. If madea movies didnt exist they are never gonna go watch selma and say “oh man we’ve been terrible to these people”.
Racists dont seek out what will change their heart, they only seek out confirmation of their bullshit ideas. If a racist needs a laugh, they only need to watch fox news or go back to the comments on Worldstar.

Also, i dont care what a so called “trailer trash white” laughs at. Ill never be around them because they dont have the money to live where i live. Im much more concerned that the president, high up CEOs, bank loan managers, and judges are racist. Because they are the ones that matter. And tyler perry making money causes him to interact with them far more often."

Now nobody knows you even won.

Now, you need to find a way to account for your newfound wealth. Your family will notice your change of lifestyle. People have no problem asking for thousands of dollars from people they feel didnt earn it. My go to story when i win the lotto (again) will be that I sold a patent that i have to the US government. Nobody that i know can prove this false. And it is something i can say im not allowed to talk about. Now i have a source of funds. 

Now, realize that you are rich, and you do not follow trends anymore. Rich people dont need to flaunt their wealth with material goods. If you wanna show wealth, wear the clothes you like, and have box seats to football games. Pay for a family vacation. Send your nieces and nephews to college."
