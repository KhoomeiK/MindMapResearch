JusticeServed,feiyj2i,t1_feiy32l,1579150806.0,"It is 'some dogs'; the article says he is accused of killing half a dozen (6). 

The man was not in any danger (acted in anger/for vengeance, not to protect himself) and is therefore not protected by any self defense laws that may be in the Chinese constitution. 

There is a chance he would have gotten away, but as China is heavily surveilled he would have likely been caught and punished fairly. Ramming someone to death with your car after they kill your dog is not justice. It is murder and I hope he is punished for it."
