You do not owe her absolution. The fact that she immediately turned on you shows the superficiality of her regret. What I think bullies do not get is that they leave deep scars on their victims, and one verbal apology does almost nothing to lessen those scars."
YouShouldKnow,fez349b,t3_eqqges,1579453443.0,My brother is named Kasper. The number of times that people make “friendly  ghost” jokes is staggering and boring.
AmItheAsshole,fefofje,t3_eoq0fz,1579060826.0,"ESH Your neighbour sounds like a huge nuisance, and wildly inflexible,  but you sound like a delight  too. Your assumption that you work so much harder than your neighbour ever did is annoying as well. I wonder how that translates into you interactions with others in the neighbourhood. I am a boomer and we had similar luck buying our home in the eighties. But we both worked straight night shifts, for many years to be able to do it, and while our house price was low our mortgage was 17 percent."
AskReddit,fdi3070,t3_elijx2,1578434818.0,In Canada my daughter has been witness to a few terminations. The process usually involves the person being called from their desk. They are taken to  another office. They are given notice and led out of the office by another door. Someone else clears their desk and they are handed this as they are escorted out the door. This is for termination or lay off.

AmItheAsshole,fcxd6ji,t3_ejeuq8,1578059743.0,"Asking people to get the flu shot and any other vaccinations is totally reasonable. We had our first grand child two years ago and were asked beforehand not to come the first day. We understood and respected this,but then the kids were so excited  bout the new baby the invited us to come much sooner than we expected. Starting a new family is a huge life shift and you should do what you feel happy with."

CampingGear,fcw8o3m,t1_fcvyxms,1578019681.0,"I used the cat litter with a lot of paper post cards that smelled so terribly of smoke I thought I would have to throw them away. Cat litter completely removed the smell. Baking sofa and coffee grounds which were also recommended to me did not help. Your items do not need to be touching the clean litter, so no damage to the tent fabric. If you look up uses for cat litters you will see it is recommended for removing mastodons and you know it controls cat odor"
CampingGear,fcvhb9b,t3_ej39d4,1578002085.0,"If you have a cat, put the tent and a whole bag of cat letter in a sealed container and leave ir for a week or two. Cat litter soaks up an amazing amount of bad smells. You can still use the litter afterwards on icy sidewalks"

My daughter lives in a larger city than I do. I use her library card to download books for that library system and I never have to go to the  library itself."

AmItheAsshole,fco6tn8,t3_ei3eco,1577825184.0,"NTA These are not your friends. They want you for the drinks you are bringing, nothing else. If you were not bringing the booze they would have not bothered to include you in the party at all. This is a tough lesson to learn but you need to look around and find new friends."
