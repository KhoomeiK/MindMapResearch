buildapcsales,feldk4l,t1_felaldi,1579219658.0,"I live in NYC and shipping from them took them like 5 business days not counting processing so real life it was like a week and a half if I remember correctly maybe longer. Assuming you didn't go for the downpayment/ship first option then you'd need to ship first and they wouldn't send till your gpu was processed. If I did a traditional RMA, there's no way I'd get it sooner than 3 weeks. That said, so long as you don't mind a temporary hold on your credit card then you don't have to wait that long. This isn't anything against EVGA, they're amazing with their CS, but unless you happen to live near by then you won't see your kind of turn around."

The downside being that you have to have external sensors lol. External sensors also make roomscale function properly. Inside out can do an ok job but for true roomscale you need external.

Once you start not enjoying yourself, you can just stop playing that game. My most recent abandoned game is RDR2, I played it non stop for like two to three weeks but did not finish it cause I was enjoying doing random stuff. Not a single but of me guilted myself when I didn't load it one day and instead played something else. I might go back to it one day, I might not, and it's ok. 

It's not about finishing, it's the getting there that's fun, if you don't finish then who cares."

It truly does not even matter how much OP would be getting paid if she didn't babysit. She could make nothing and it STILL wouldn't matter. The husband was a judgemental ass and didn't like how much OP was willing to do it for and responded in an extremely hateful and judgemental way. You could make $10/hour and still not want to baby sit 3 kids for 3 days for anywhere near that amount.
