You're going to want a bigger, slightly softer set of wheels. Maybe something like 60mm.

Basically, you'll have a board from the 80's. They were heavier and clunkier than a modern board, but if you get one with an upturned nose, like you'd start to see in the early 90's, you can still do all the same tricks as on a board today.

Kurt took some artistic license with the song, but it does seems like he was homeless for a while. He was lucky not to be full on ""on the street"" homeless, but having been there myself briefly, even having to rotate crashing with people or sleeping in a car can be really shitty.

The ""Classic Albums"" episode about Nevermind really showed the emotion in ""Something In The Way"", for me. Like you said, you were driving around where Kurt lived and that made the song resonate.

For the ""Something In The Way"" segment of Classic Albums, they filmed around Aberdeen while SITW played. It's a fucking depressing place."
