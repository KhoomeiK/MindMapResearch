The answer is, the tree doesn't really know how to ""balance"" the branches at all. When a branch is growing strong it produces auxin hormones that inhibit growth of other branches near them, so big branches are spaced out nicely, but the tree definitely isn't doing any kind of overall planning to make the left side as heavy as the right, or anything like that.

Yes. This is actually a real experiment you can do, since the laws of relativity don't actually forbid motion faster than c! They only forbid physical objects from exceeding that speed.

For example, get a bright laser and shine it on something big, like a distant mountain (or the Moon even) so it makes a visible dot. Now rotate the laser. The dot appears to move, but since it's not a physical object but just an image, you can make it move faster than c just by rotating the laser fast enough.

Ordinary observers will be able to see this motion.

WouldYouRather,fcxuitw,t1_fcxdpr9,1578070661.0,"Guy with a physics degree here... This isn't really how it works. For starters, the names for the stuff to describe what we're talking about are ""special relativity"", ""Minkowski spacetime"", and ""Lorentz transformations"". I've never heard of something called ""photon degeneration"". The proper time experienced by a photon moving at c (speed of light) is 0, this is well known and everybody working with relativity is comfortable with it.

Moving faster than light does not automatically mean you can move backwards in time. How it works is, everything is relative to the observer (hence the name ""relativity""). If something is moving the way ordinary objects move, slower than c, different observers might disagree about how fast it's moving (because of the time and space warping effects of motion), but if it's moving toward ""galactic North"" in one frame of reference, at least everybody's going to agree that it's moving toward galactic North, not toward galactic South.

Now, if something is ""moving"" at say, 36c, all bets are off here. Different snapshots of this object are separated by ""spacelike"" intervals, not ""timelike"" ones, and what that means is there's some potential observer for whom the events are simultaneous. So if one observer sees you move from point A to point B at 36c, there must be some other observer who sees you instantly jump from point A to point B without any time delay between the departure and arrival.

Furthermore there must be other observers for whom the arrival actually comes before the departure in their reference frame, so they see something bizarre - first two different extra copies of you appear out of nowhere at B, then one of the copies moves backwards (faster than c) to A, then it collides with the original at A and both of those two copies disappear, leaving only the new copy at B.

Is that like traveling backwards in time? Well, in some ways it is, because that temporary copy moving from B to A is moving in the ""wrong"" direction - from destination to source. And if you caught up with that copy and asked them questions, would they remember being at A (which they appear to be rapidly approaching)? Or would they remember being at B and starting to travel toward A? Relativity says they wouldn't be able to remember either, because information can't flow along spacelike paths, but that's the same law that says nothing can travel faster than light in the first place so we'll take that with a grain of salt.

What does all this mean for our hypothetical superhero powers? It's hard to say, because it's difficult to avoid accidentally overpowering this superhero while keeping things consistent with the laws of relativity. Motion faster than light is equivalent to teleporting, because of the observer mentioned above who sees the departure from A and the arrival at B as simultaneous. But if we allow the hero to decide exactly when and where to teleport, to remember everything from the old location all the way up to the time of teleportation, and to act on that knowledge immediately after teleportation (and if this ability works the same in any possible reference frame), then that IS equivalent to being able to send yourself back in time, and would allow truly godlike powers from being able to manipulate paradoxical time loops.

Instead, I recommend limiting the ability of the hero to travel (or send information) in closed timelike curves by tying it to a specific reference frame, such as the average frame of all the nearby galaxies (or the dark matter or whatever). We also limit their ability to think or take any actions while in transit, so they're frozen in time until they arrive. These restrictions would make it impossible to send a message back to your past self, in order to have infinite time to think about a problem or whatever... but you could still claim to be ""moving faster than light"".

If instead you wanted to preserve Lorentz invariance (equivalence of different reference frames) at all costs, we would have to make sure the hero can't precisely control the teleporting (so they can't use their position or time of arrival to send information), and we'd also have to make sure they don't remember anything from times that are too recent. This would be quite bizarre because it would mean if you teleport 1 light year away, you don't remember anything from the last 1 year of your life, at least until the light travel time elapses and then your amnesia goes away. Or what if you teleport 1000 light years away? This would be a very strange super power."
