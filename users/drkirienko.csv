You'll probably be disappointed in the results, since your topic requires some level of engagement with the material, and isn't merely asking people to list their favorite books.

This subreddit has very little engaged conversation and is mostly just, ""OMG I LOVE TOLKEIN!"""

tifu,ff1prso,t3_er1wqf,1579483466.0,"This is bullshit. You can't have 15 lb of poo in your colon without serious, life-threatening consequences. You also can't get miralax toake you shit in less than a day. It is an osmolyte. Even if you were pounding water, you'd need a day. Usually it takes several days to have an effect.

Even if all of this were true, 15 lbs in your colon don't circle you like a fucking inner tube. It would be spread across the six foot length of your large intestine, and perhaps into the little one. Especially if you're small enough that 15 lbs would add 5 inches to your circumference.

OP dropped a pound or two, decided to make up an exaggerated story."
