AskReddit,feowcqv,t3_eq1wzh,1579306818.0,I just want a job. Living off student allowance with a partner on disability pension sucks. I have work placement for my course coming up but I'm literally terrified I won't be able to get a job in my field (Aged Care) as the last course I did the company (and school) that promised me an interview literally ghosted me and I could never find work in that field.
creepyPMs,feow3by,t1_femv2bf,1579306664.0,Good question. Perhaps you could say you could put it on display and charge people entry to come and see the 'exotic and mystical bird who will bless you with good tidings'.

Our self serve check-outs also say ""thank you for shopping at Coles/Woolworths"" or whatever, and I always say ""you're welcome"" or just generally get aggro at it when it starts yelling at me to ""please take your items from the bagging area"" while I'm trying to pack everything into the trolley.

Anyway, I'd believe someone saying ""thank you"" to the machine, just not the rest of it."

No offence, but simple language is great because it opens up your story world to much larger audiences of varying levels of literacy levels. It seems silly to restrict it to such a small percentage of people because you want to 'sound smart'.

Of course theasaurus' can be great and useful but for crying out loud, have some self control. You feel me?"

And don't get me started on men critiquing how I wrote a female character in one of my stories once. Apparently me writing about how it had been drilled into her from a young age how 'conventionally beautiful' she was, as if that was all she had going for her, made her an unappealing character because ""she's too vain"".

While I understand from a story point of view maybe it's a good RPG, but to me I can't invest myself in roleplaying as a character I feel literally zero connection with (sorry Witcher fans). 

I prefer playing as a female and pretty much actively avoid playing anything where I can't be a woman."
