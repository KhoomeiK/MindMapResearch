funny,fekj7n8,t1_fekacmq,1579201172.0,"The apathy and ease of the act. The lack of empathy to even see anything beyond yourself as important. 

If a living creature isnt living in your eyes, just an object, then whats destorying it? 

Like ripping a piece of paper apart, or crushing a bottle or hitting a button, or throwing a ball. Everything is just a thing to them. No malice.. just disinterest and maybe with a mix of curiousity to see what happens."
AskReddit,fehydmh,t1_fehnawr,1579126353.0,"See thats how i see the struggle of humanity. Its generally always working towards good, it just takes time for things to happen cuz its SO big. Conversely humans are also in love with instant self gratification, so they're trapped in progress never being fast enough to sate human need.  And it doesn't help humanities defining characteristic next to adaptability is amnesia. So much is just forgotten within the span of a few years, let alone a generation, that any actual progress is seen as the status quo and thus evil cuz its ""always"" been there and stagnation is bad. And thus it seems nothing is happening when it is.. Its baffling.

Thank you for the work you do. No doubt that the world is and will benefit from it. Stay awesome!"

space,fdqb5ps,t1_fdq6oqw,1578661783.0,"And theres always the potential of the Observer Effect. The fact we look at the stars means nothing until we start to observe them and they choose to do something. And that something isnt beholden to a singular moment of observation. 

We don’t even understand the mechanics of what is pushing the universe apart from every point, let alone the actual cause. As you even stated, it could not be uniform. Or it could be layered in space that we can’t even see from light that will never reach us. 

I doubt we will even know beyond observation unless we know what Gravity actually is. That i feel is our next Keystone in physics equations beyond the mathematics and models we have now. Before another Einstein with the Theory of The Source of Gravity and ways to control it, well be stumbling in the dark of our visible universe. 

I love the wonkiness of reality."
