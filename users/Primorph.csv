television,fdaxdrp,t1_fd5smsu,1578251511.0,"So you know how Irene Adler is famous in the original stories for being the person who beats Sherlock, and also for being in a story where Sherlock is really not the good guy? Like she’s just someone who’s done nothing wrong except be involved with a royal in her youth?

In Sherlock the tv show they change Irene Adler into a dominatrix who also sidelines in selling state secrets. She also falls in love with Sherlock because he’s just so smart. Sherlock beats her because she’s in love with him and can’t stop thinking about him, and she has to go on the run. She is caught by isis (maybe) and about to be executed when Sherlock rescues her with a machete.

Also Sherlock is smart because he realizes that the dead dude everyone is wondering about wasn’t murdered, he threw a boomerang and it killed him when it came back (boomerangs don’t actually do that)

That’s *one episode* of Sherlock. It gets worse."

television,fdauhq4,t1_fd7e0yf,1578250338.0,"> There will be twists of a secret sibling/family member

Weak yes. A character gets so sucked in by D that he forgets his fiancé’s face, and she has been secretly there the whole time

>a secret mysterious organization trying to control things from afar

Again, sort of. A modern organization run by *bad people* shows up in ep 3, intent on studying D. Their actual goal isn’t stated in the show, and they swiftly lose relevance.

> at LEAST one Irene Adler character (Moffet's version, aka River Song)

I’d say Agatha van helsing fits the bill. She starts as a tough as nails nun bent on opposing Dracula, but it turns into some weird special relationship she has with D.

> 1-3 character deaths that are later undone

Calling this a yes. There’s one death that is undone, then redone later in the same episode, there’s D surviving being on an exploded ship, and there’s one character who dies only to be sort of reincarnated in one of her descendants (like the original character partially takes over her descendent)

> and little to no explanation on how characters actually discovered or realized things in the story, just that they're smart and we should take their word for it.

Mmm, weak no. They solved this in part by having D absorb the memories of people he eats, so he just knows things. The final twist of why D fears the cross might count, van helsing just figures it out."

Second, there was no plan.

George Lucas gave them “ideas”, not a plan, and Disney decided to ignore that long before 7 started filming. I’m not sure why you think that’s relevant, since if there was a plan and they decided not to use it, the films would still have been made with no plan.

Also here’s what rian Johnson said about writing the last Jedi

“ I was truly able to write this script without bases to tag, and without a big outline on the wall.(...) If it had all just been planned out and written down beforehand, it might have felt a little more calculated”
