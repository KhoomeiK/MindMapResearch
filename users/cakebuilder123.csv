But if I’m an alcoholic at 65 and I know it, odds are that sitting on my neck about it and filming me and showing me how I act when I’m drunk isn’t gonna change anything because I’m pretty sure that if I cared about my self image as much as I care about drinking I wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place."
