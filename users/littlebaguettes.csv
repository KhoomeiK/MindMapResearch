bipolar,fcwszek,t3_ejas74,1578036370.0,"I married my opposite. He's logical, straightforward and non-emotional. We challenge each other everyday. He is my rock. He has pushed me and been there through my best and worst moments. 10years and 1 child later, I still respect him more than anyone on Earth. He leads by example with no agenda. Our relationship is strong because he puts in the effort. We constantly learn from each other. I know I am not the easiest person to live with but everyday he chooses to be with me."
