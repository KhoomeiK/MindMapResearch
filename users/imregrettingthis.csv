A great first step is realizing you’re echoing a problem from your mom. 

It’s great to have an example outside yourself to look at as well. 

I would talk about this with your partner and how he reacts should tell you a lot. 

Does he want to learn and grow and recognize his problems? Great. I will stick around with someone like they snd give them a chance to grow with me. 

Does he deny them or try make it seem like it’s your fault? I would be done. 

You want a partner that builds you up. 

If you’re willing to learn and grow and your partner isn’t where does that leave you in 10 years. If they are willing to learn and grow then it’s worth seeing what you can do to affect change together. 

Just be honest about everything. Try step outside and view the relationship as if your mom was in it. Sometimes that helps.

You have to set the tone you want in the beginning of a relationship. 

You shouldn’t do things and complain about it later. 

You shouldn’t reward manipulative behavior. 

If you can’t have an adult conversion where he realizes that he’s not being a good partner then you shouldn’t be in the relationship. 

Before you decide if he’s not pulling his weight ask yourself what he’s doing that you’re not.. if it’s truly one sided leave and work on yourself so you don’t repeat the cycle. It really does take two. 

No woman I have ever dated would put up with me trying to manipulate them into being my mom. My advice would be to ask yourself what in your past makes you ok with it.

todayilearned,feyp8u9,t1_feylx5r,1579448549.0,"Sure. Or at least I can touch on it. 

A giant company that is involved in rounds of investment might not worry about profit for a decade or more even. 

They might project 5 years of rounds raising capitol knowing that a long time they will make money by selling off portions of their company in order to build to profitability. They will do this to grow and survive and last until they can be profitable but that doesn’t need to be their immediate goal. 

Take Uber as an example. Current profitability for them means nothing compared to controlling market share by the time their cars aren’t being driven by humans. 

Or Amazon who’s focus for the past decade has been to undercut and expanding into whole industries to grow their market share instead of focusing on current profits. 

Very rare are companies first steps profitable. When you’re disrupting whole industries profitability is often a long long term goal. 

A lack of profit is not a lack of success. It just depends what stage you are at. 

Hope that makes sense."
