Televisions,ffddw4j,t1_ffbrp2z,1579818824.0,That is probably the same reviewer I saw. He is a good English speaking Asian guy. I am not sure he is telling the truth but I have noticed when I browse through Crutchfield (where I bought mine) they used to have a lot of Oleds whereas now they probably only have a half dozen. mI hate it because from my personal experience there is nothing else that even comes close. This guy was from HDtv on youtube
knives,ff3ka6z,t3_erd0k0,1579542850.0,"When I first started collecting edc knives I thought that lanyards were the ugliest things ever and could not understand why anyone would ruin the looks of their knife with one. One day, when I got my sebenza with the ready attached lanyard I found out that it made the knife so much easier to pull out of my pocket and I loved it. From then on every knife I buy has to have a lanyard hole on it or I won't buy it. It kind blows carrying in secret out of the water but I don't care."
Televisions,ff3jkj6,t3_er85n6,1579542416.0,"I recently saw an article from a reviewer from CES show saying LG is bringing the OLED to the discontinued list. Something about OLED's being too expensive to produce and then price moderately. LG is apparently having money problems. Funny, that is what happened with Pioneer when they quit producing the great Kuro Plasma's. They blew all the other tv's out of the water but Pioneer said they were not making enough profit. I had a 50inch Kuro and I spent $3000 for it while other lcd's were going for under $1000. I hate to see LG drop the OLED- I have a C8 and it has the best picture I ever have seen."
Roku,ff3eed3,t3_er9mf8,1579539380.0,I really liked the Reuters app. It gave  quick and to the point news.
aww,ff0wur5,t3_er0yqv,1579473044.0,Sweet face!
aww,ff0wl9k,t3_eqwhb9,1579472972.0,Labs are the most empathic dogs ever. So kind and loving.
Comcast_Xfinity,ff0tu50,t3_er0va9,1579472241.0,Did you contact comcast and have them reprovision your modem.
WTF,ff0ri7n,t3_eqzd3p,1579471630.0,Thats kind of creepy!
dogs,ff0r4yt,t3_er09c4,1579471509.0,If I was sure it was him and you liked him (which it sounded like you did) I would absolutely adopt him. I don't know anything about this shelter but over here His time could definitely be running out.
knifeclub,feu1fyy,t1_feomj2a,1579382149.0,Whats the blade length and weight?
knifeclub,feojsuk,t3_eq632m,1579301122.0,Very Nice.  Expensive?
subwoofer,feojjxz,t3_eq57sc,1579300978.0,I have a huge SVS 995 watt Bash amp. and two 12 inch down firing speakers and when cranked there is absolutely no doubt the pressure it's putting out. I knocked down a shelf bolted to the wall upstairs and I was downstairs. You can feel the force in an explosion like somebody slinging a basketball hard right into your chest. I loved it but my wife and friends hated it so it has sadly just sat there for the last 6 years.
funny,fee0p94,t3_eoma76,1579023947.0,That is one smart dog!
1022,fdx2707,t3_emlcv1,1578764561.0,I have just about the same set up with the volquartsen cantilever but I have a vortex sparc 2 and it just mounts flat on the rail. I think red-dots are much more forgiving than scopes as far as eye relief goes. That is a great looking scope though.
Hunting,fds80j0,t3_emvqe8,1578696440.0,Rat Bastards- Thats the youth of America.
knifeclub,fds7dyx,t1_fds5o9z,1578696028.0,"That is one of the things that gets to me with Spyderco. Their prices are getting higher and higher and a lot of them end up being dumped because of design screw ups. I have bought probably 3 or 4 knives that I had liked from Spyderco but could not afford (prices in the high $200 and well into the $300) That after they had sold thousands of them at way high prices there would be some kind of mistake with washers or pivots or other things and all of a sudden the prices would drop 40% and be discontinued for example- Southards, Domino's, Advocates and more to come. I bet Spyderco knew pretty quick about these problems the whole time they are selling them at full retail. I love Spyderco but I don't think they give a rats ass about their customers."
aww,fds60cr,t3_emuca9,1578695136.0,God Bless Australia. The poor people backed up to the shoreline and over a billion animals dead. It's enough to make you just hurt inside. Our prayers will be with you.
1022,fds5p6p,t3_emihgv,1578694934.0,Uh-That wouldn't be the reincarnation of Annie Oakley - would it?  Did you give her some help dialing in that red-eye?
Roku,fdr87x2,t1_fdoqvm9,1578680821.0,"I really wish I had more choices. I live in Loganville Ga and there are only two choices if you want fast internet. Comcast with all their little bag of tricks and AT&T which have fiber available in certain area's. I have never checked if AT&T has fiber near our house because I kind of hate them with a passion. Just about anytime I got involved with AT&T I have ended up really regretted. My Comcast is reliable as far as no outages but as far as anything else goes they will screw you any chance they get. I am in the second year of my 2 year contract with Comcast and I am paying $139 a month for Gigabit and voice. I have never been able to get more than 700 mbps with Comcast but I believe it is some kind of flaw with my equipment. I have gone down their Gig requirements list and the only flaw is I still have Windows 7-they want windows 10. If you have a problem and they send out a tech, they will check your  ethernet  from the street to your modem and if everything checks they just walk out without having done anything to restore your service. That really pisses me off because I know that it is probably some simple setting in my network but if you own your own equipment they won't even attempt to help you."
Roku,fdopt7p,t1_fdolr3e,1578610155.0,That's flying. My Comcast gig does not get nearly that fast.
Roku,fdoglv7,t1_fdnzea9,1578604737.0,I have not ever been entirely about my network system in general. The ethernet on mine is always way faster than the wifi. I have never gotten a wifi speed over about 70. I don't know if there are just too many devices being hooked up or what. My comcast Gigabit has never pulled a speed test faster than 700. It may be that I am still on Windows 7. All of my streaming devices manage good user speeds but not rocket fast. I am able to pull 4k UHD HDR off of netflix and Amazon onto my LG OLED.
Roku,fdnqz44,t1_fdlogb3,1578591136.0,I don't agree. I have 3 roku's in the house. Two on wi-fi and one on ethernet. I have gigabit on comcast that runs into the main router-an Asus RT-AC68U and then on to the access point-also an Asus RT-AC68U. I have strong 2.4 and 5.0 all through the house. I like the check connection that roku has built into the boxes because it lets me know just what is coming into all of them. Every single time I check the ethernet roku is pulling in just about double the speed of either of the wi-fi roku's which are both set on 5.0. Ethernet connections are always going to be faster than wi-fi.
Roku,fdlgpsk,t3_elwjwb,1578523648.0,If you can reach an ethernet cable to it -that's the way to go.   At least twice as fast as 5ghz.
1022,fdkj6el,t3_elj1s1,1578504839.0,I have a Magpul on my Takedown and I really can't imagine them not making more. I have seen them on so many 10/22's and they have even made a second style for th T/D. I really like my Magpul because they put opening's all over the stock that can be used for optics or tripods or many things. There also was a kit you could get for it that would let you make the stock longer (like 3 steps) and you could change the cheek pad on it also to make it more customised to your arm lengths.
knifeclub,fdki865,t1_fdiabcm,1578504366.0,I can agree with you but it is just so pristine I just can't get myself to do it. It's the only one of my knives that I have not edc'd.
knifeclub,fdkhytz,t1_fdiku6y,1578504235.0,I think that Paragon Knives is who moved into the old Citadel factory. Microtech also has a factory in Asheville. There is another called Carolina Knives up there.
knifeclub,fdkhkfr,t1_fdik144,1578504021.0,"For some odd reason Spyderco not too long back put out a round of Embassy auto's. I wondered because I started seeing them popping up on knife sales. I kind of thought that it was a scam but I never found out. But, yeah I really started wanting a Citadel about a year after they quit making them and I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice one but the few that came up had been abused."
knifeclub,fdi8s1t,t3_elj8f9,1578437783.0,I was searching all over for a couple of years to get Citadel. Finally I  found an ad way back in Google. I immediately called him and it turns out he had just bought the factory in Asheville where the Citadels were made. He was walking through the place checking things out and at the very end of the production line there were two of these left sitting there. He gave me a good price and now I wish I had bought both of these. It just sits in my knife safe and has never even cut paper. I really love this knife.
dogs,fcz0545,t3_ejiwuy,1578090949.0,"I had a 9 year old Lab that had a mast cell tumor-huge-and my vet recommended I have her put down. Instead,I took her down to the University of Georgia animal hospital. She had to go in once every other week for a year for chemo but she loved it because the whole staff down there loved her because of her sweet personality. It was expensive-around 5000- and a lot of driving but she lived almost 5 more happy and healthy years and I never regretted it for a minute."
1022,fcyzk84,t3_ejj3y7,1578090576.0,"Yeah, That could be very dangerous."
FordTaurus,fcsmsgh,t3_cylqdx,1577919902.0,Did you ever find an answer? I am putting morimotos on my wifes 2015 taurus and I just don't anything about this stuff. Iam having them installed by a shop and am hoping not to regret it. Those stock quartz projector headlights that came stock on this car are rediculous scary on back roads.
1022,fcsm35g,t3_eil81g,1577919437.0,In three weeks they might just confiscate that if you are unlucky enough to live in Virginia.
techsupport,fckjntr,t3_ehlg0t,1577726791.0,"I had a windows 7 ""major"" update that they slipped in on me somehow and it really screwed my computer up. I tried to delete it but it would not work. I finally did a restore back to a few days before the update and everything got back in line."
depression,fckg05i,t1_fcaif9f,1577724490.0,You are welcome and hang in there. God Bless
depression,fcaia0t,t3_ed4i3y,1577569711.0,"You most likely will gain on prozac but not absolutely. I think some of it is you just get to feeling so much better, you feel like eating. The only a/d I know of that is not supposed to cause weight gain is wellbutrin. I think the suicidal thoughts are more prevalent among children. Don't freak just don't analyze every feeling. It will work out ok."
Roku,fbeuyco,t1_fbbxtav,1576794555.0,Good idea. Thanks
