SuicideWatch,ff2p2wi,t3_erb1qg,1579517307.0,"Incels aren't harmful to society. Incels have probably done as much harm as Christians have.  Actually probably exponentially way less. Incels are a very recent phenomenon. Having a sometimes bad track record doesn't make Christians harmful automatically. Don't make generalizations you don't have to. 

You sound kind of normal honestly. You've just had a bad time and probably need some help like everyone here. 

Cross dressing has become more normalized in pop culture. Maybe you can be a little more hopeful there."
SuicideWatch,ff2oq08,t3_erb99g,1579516757.0,"Couldn't you grow plants inside? 

You probably stay in as much as most people these days. TV and computers and everything. Even if people are outside, they aren't outside. They have their cell phones in front of them or their preoccupied thoughts clouding out the daylight."
SuicideWatch,ff2ol77,t3_erbehf,1579516548.0,"Emotions have a way of feeling unstoppable at times. They have a force of their own, a will, their own properties and dynamics. It takes a while to understand them, to accept them, and then learn how to control them. If everyone could do so easily, therapists would be out of jobs. Don't think you're alone for having feelings that you don't want or think it's ok to have. I think I have felt some wretchedness like you describe too. It takes time to get out from under these wholly unwanted thoughts and feelings and frames of mind. I hope eventually you can think of your friend who you care about so deeply as someone among many, and whose opinion is not worth more or less than anybody else's, but the same. It's a shame about her, but some things would've ended anyway, even if in less dramatic fashions. Maybe it would've been worse if she still liked you."
SuicideWatch,ff2k34s,t3_eqy2fj,1579509748.0,wow sounds like a song. Good job!
SuicideWatch,fe5ymh3,t1_fe3tv1x,1578877853.0,same
SuicideWatch,fe5yln6,t1_fe3ypqt,1578877839.0,you're welcome
SuicideWatch,fe5yknt,t1_fe0zf77,1578877821.0,I'm happy to help. I hope you can feel a little bit better today.
SuicideWatch,fe0ycf1,t3_enk77b,1578820237.0,"Hey thanks for posting. I'm glad you posted here. I think it's good to keep track of what trips you up, like writing about it here. Sometimes it's good to deal with hard feelings, but other times it's too much. It's good to allow yourself to deal with things, and to allow yourself to deal with it another time too, if it's for the best."
SuicideWatch,fe0xtp6,t3_enkb8v,1578820016.0,"I think a good thing to do is develop some kind of daily routine so that you can adequately reset yourself should you find yourself slipping into depressive thoughts. I honestly haven't made a routine for myself either but I keep meaning to. The times I did have been helpful. 

Is there something small that you enjoy, maybe like a nice picture, or a motto, or a piece of music, or a video? Make it part of your day."
SuicideWatch,fe0wy3s,t3_enkbt4,1578819684.0,"Haha, wow I'm behind too. 

I understand what you mean and feel it myself. I don't really have anything hopeful to say. If I really want to feel shitty I just think of the Youtube influencers who might be in their teens and clearing a million dollars. The world is a changing place and there's always someone to feel shitty next to. Lets spend a few minutes thinking of Mozart composing his orchestras as a toddler or just really young."
SuicideWatch,fe0vrwy,t3_enkflm,1578819209.0,"This kind of darkness can really get to you when you're alone. Is there something you can do to distract yourself from the thoughts in your head? Maybe put on a movie or listen to some music. Can you also post to other subs, or comment on other people's posts here, just so you have something to do? Commenting on other people's posts gives me a sense of purpose sometimes, like my experience with dark depressive thoughts like yours can actually be of some use to somebody. When I felt my most useless self after being unemployed a long time, I began commenting here so I could at least feel a bit useful. 

Children can be selfish and uncaring. Sometimes time goes on just because of life. Don't let something like your son not speaking to you drive you to suicide. Something like a messy house shouldn't make you kill yourself either. Realize that what you're feeling is a bunch of segments of unhappy situations strung together and they can each be dealt with in time.

Everyone has their low point. It's how we stay humble and can relate to others so they don't feel alone. Reach out to someone else and you might feel better."
SuicideWatch,fe0tht3,t3_enk8c0,1578818484.0,"You have some good food for thought here.

I think this space (r/suicidewatch) can exacerbate a sense of imprisonment in a life of agony. I don't think it's meant to. But lots of people post here--the long time, chronically depressed, the very young (even as young as twelve years old), the overworked, the grieving who grieve the loss of a friend or family member or the end of a relationship, etc. Even if someone gives a big synopsis of their life and its conflicts, you still don't really know. In my opinion, people here aren't equipped at all to talk you out of suicide, even though we may relate and may have gone through similar troubles as you. It is up to you. But perhaps someone here may have an experience that could be helpful. To me, that is what this space could be for.

But we are even more unequipped to support your decision to commit suicide. That is entirely irresponsible especially as strangers on the internet. The stickied post mentions about ""covert incitement"" and even though I think many of want to resonate about our honest feelings and shared unhappiness, it is important to do so in a way that doesn't push you towards the most extreme option when there might be less extreme solutions available.

I wish there was a place where these things could be talked of without fear. Maybe if you were able to express yourself freely you could get help."
SuicideWatch,fe0p705,t3_enc7tm,1578817042.0,I also feel like I can't be happy. I wish things didn't have to be this way.
SuicideWatch,fcttmqz,t3_eivso5,1577958893.0,"There's a lot in life that doesn't recover. It's part of maturity. Don't let it drive you to suicide though. Please do reach out and get help. There are many kinds of people willing to help. And whatever part of you that doesn't feel right or good, that's just one part of you. A therapist will help you understand that it doesn't have to overshadow all the rest. Sexual tendencies are part of everyone, but you do have to learn to express it in a way that lets you like who you are, to be kind to others, and that allows you to get along with society which has its rules, and many of them are good."
SuicideWatch,fctt4lu,t3_eiw0yz,1577958141.0,Both understandable
SuicideWatch,fctt2nf,t3_eip7g5,1577958060.0,Posts like this make me wish for innovations in the field of mental wellness
SuicideWatch,fctt0g2,t3_eiqazb,1577957968.0,This is good
SuicideWatch,fctsvyv,t3_eiw56r,1577957780.0,I get the feeling
SuicideWatch,fctsuu3,t3_eiw5y0,1577957733.0,I think it's good to connect to people about these things. Please do post again. Just let us know how you're doing.
SuicideWatch,fcmkoqy,t1_fcjvxls,1577779266.0,I guess. I bet it wouldn't matter what they said though if you thought they meant it.
SuicideWatch,fcjhxeb,t3_ehgvvu,1577688255.0,"I don't know if you can convince her. That's not really in your power. But maybe you can chat with her a couple times a week or something. Sometimes it's helpful just to have a friend. If anything you can invite her to post to this sub. That's pretty much the point of the sub--for suicidal people to vent. I think it would be good for her not to feel alone. But also keep checking in. This sub can help some, but others say it doesn't change anything for them, and maybe others can be adversely affected too. It depends. 

If you want more specific help also try ask in r/depression. 

If your friend has a mental illness you can also recommend a specific sub for her perhaps. Haven't visited in a while but r/BPDmemes (having to do with borderline personality disorder) was kinda relatable for me and even was humorous."
SuicideWatch,fcjhh1a,t3_ehhtxn,1577687759.0,it's just hard to come up with new stuff

SuicideWatch,fcjhbdt,t3_ehegyu,1577687591.0,yes
SuicideWatch,fcjh2t8,t3_eh59rn,1577687340.0,I dunno. What you're asking for is commitment and fidelity from people who just met you. Isn't it ok to get mild support from a bunch of people--can't that rival the deep support of a few people?
SuicideWatch,fcjbow3,t3_ehfqyw,1577682320.0,I wish there was a way to help these feelings.
SuicideWatch,fcj1ly0,t3_ehfzez,1577675010.0,It's hard isn't it

SuicideWatch,fcdifac,t3_eh3v4l,1577610277.0,Are you at a college dormitory by chance? Could you change rooms at all?
SuicideWatch,fbztnvl,t1_fbzta3t,1577260944.0,I don't really know about that. Wish you didn't feel so shit though.
SuicideWatch,fbzt7pv,t3_efdr0u,1577260266.0,Man that's vivid. :-( I feel the hurt
SuicideWatch,fbzt57x,t3_efdr5i,1577260163.0,I know right
depression,fbijpxh,t1_fbghi3y,1576903078.0,"Seeing you wrote all those things, and the way I think of them for myself, makes me think I should take care of what's going on with me, and find ways to stop letting all those dark feelings pile up. I can get pretty depressed sometimes. I've written in this sub myself probably near a dozen times all in all, in various ways. I'm not here just to give everyone else help. I'm feeling kind of okay right now but I really want to feel better."
