The series has a great source to pull from and some great performances. Is it as pretty as it could be? No. In comparison to the game (and yes I know it’s based on the books) it’s a bit drab and muted when it could be breathtaking. Because let’s be honest, while the show is based on the books 90% of the people watching either don’t know anything about it or only know the game. 

But Cavil is as close to the Geralt I know from the games as you can get. He’s the best casting knocking Perlman as Hellboy off that pedestal. He delivers the lines in true form to how he was written in the games and the books, and the supporting cast is incredibly interesting and has so much potential. I was initially unsure of the casting for Yen and Ciri but the more I see them the more I’m getting to love them. By the end of Ep 3, the actress playing Yen convinced me she was spot on for the part. Ciri is getting there.
