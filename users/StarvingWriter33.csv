We haven’t really talked much about politics, but I felt the day was too historic to just let pass. I showed her a picture of Trump and told her that he had been impeached.

Just as I was about to explain what “impeached” meant, she interrupted me. 

She immediately asked “Oh, does that mean the bad man is gone?”

I was surprised she had already formed such a strong opinion on Trump. Mind you, we live in a rural area that is extremely pro-Trump. Yet she told me that all her friends had talked about “the President” and how he was such a mean person and a bully and how he was “yucky.”

The first perspective is the medical perspective ... that is, that deafness is a flaw to be *fixed*.  That is the standpoint that most doctors are operating from.

Thus, doctors recommend cochlear implants (CI), intensive speech therapy, and discourage sign language because they believe sign language will interfere with speech development.  

The second perspective is the cultural perspective ... that is, deafness is just a different way of being. The Deaf community adopts this perspective, and they believe that language and cognitive development is more important than “fitting in.”  Therefore they strongly encourage exposure to sign language as early as possible."

Exposure to language during the critical 0-5 prelingual stage is SO critical in any child’s linguistic and cognitive development. For deaf children, that means being exposed to sign language. 

However, many doctors out there still cling to the outdated belief that speech is more important than language. They will promote CIs while discouraging sign language.  They believe that if a deaf child learns sign language, this will negatively impact their speech development. Research, however, has shown that not only does sign language *not* negatively impact speech development, it actually can be used to enhance speech.  

However, because of those doctors’ outdated beliefs, many hearing parents opt to deny their deaf children sign language, and thus deprive them of language.  After all, if you’re a parent with a newborn deaf baby, who are you going to listen to?  Doctors or a bunch of deaf folks?

I’m a teacher of deaf students, and I’ve seen so many deaf children show up at school with practically zero language.  They’re almost always from families where the parents don’t sign at all.  However, the students whose parents signed to them right from the beginning tend to perform just as well as their hearing peers and are considerably more successful in school.

worldnews,fc78c7i,t1_fc729pw,1577500219.0,I think it’s more the fact that Trump oh-so-casually suggested that the whistleblower should be executed (which resulted in death threats being sent) that caused Schiff to backtrack on having the whistleblower testify.
politics,fc570w1,t1_fc4sq7y,1577446484.0,"Yep. Exactly. They will put out a feeler first (like they did with the whole “I support Russia over Ukraine” “joke”).  Then they will gauge the base’s reaction. 

I do think that, shockingly, the public opinion tide is actually slowly turning against Trump.  Between the evangelical “Christian Today” magazine’s scratching editorial against Trump and the MSN 55/40 support of Trump’s removal, it seems that the end might be coming. Hopefully I’m not being overly optimistic."

I think collecting gold bricks just for the sake of getting gold bricks is kinda pointless (not that it’s stopped me from doing so ... I’ve played 7 LEGO games and 100%ed / platinumed all of them).  Maybe it’s because I grew up playing JRPGs but I like the concept of working towards unlocking side quests. If LEGO games must have gold bricks, at least make them somewhat meaningful."

Worse. Trump was thisclose to getting what he wanted from Zelensky and Ukraine. 

The personal favor was for Zelensky to announce that Ukraine was going to investigate Biden for corruption. 

Zelensky *was* going to cave in and do what Trump wanted. He had an interview set up for September 13 on CNN. Trump was literally only days away from getting the quo in his quid pro quo. 

Then the whistleblower report came out on September 9.  The foreign aid package for Ukraine was released on September 11, and Zelensky promptly cancelled his interview since he got what he wanted. No announcement of any investigation into Biden’s “corruption.”"

The Constitution is a bit vague on whether Trump can be pardoned of the crimes outlined in the articles of impeachment. Some says yes, others say no. 

Either way, Pence can only pardon federal crimes. He cannot pardon state crimes. And the State of New York is absolutely salivating to go after Trump as soon as he’s out of office. All the crimes that Cohen was sent to jail for?  He implicated Trump in them."
politics,fc4fpz8,t1_fc492ki,1577415335.0,"Agreed. When FoxNews fully turns on Trump will be one of the pivotal moments when Trump’s presidency is shut down. 

We’re not there yet. But with the recent poll showing a 55/40 split in support of removing Trump, I think we’re almost there."

Because “liberal tears.”

Seriously. He pisses off liberals, and that makes them happy."
politics,fc4cznx,t1_fc38mnz,1577413096.0,"What Trump meant by “due process” is that he wasn’t allowed to bring Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Adam Schiff, and the whistleblower to the stand to be grilled by the Republicans. 

Especially the whistleblower. Trump is absolutely pissed off that the whistleblower revealed his “perfect call” to Congress and sparked the whole impeachment process. Trump honestly believes that the whistleblower only revealed what they did because they were politically motivated (aka voted against Trump and wanted to remove him from office) and that if he could just force the whistleblower on the stand and make them testify about their political leaning, this would automatically invalidate the whole impeachment because it would be “proof” that the report was done in bad faith, and “fruit of the poisonous tree” would wipe out everything else."

It’s for those who believe that FoxNews is too liberal. 

I wish I were kidding."
