Note: Some time ago my city imposed a stupid rule to make the number on elevators buttons to match  the actual floor. Usually the floors where facilities (parking, gym) are located are designated by letters (like “P” for parking), so the “first floor” (where are the apartments/offices starts) are in fact the second or third floor.

My condo changed the buttons to abide to this rule, so there was me, with the key on someone door, trying to guess why it didn’t turn open.

The second time it’s happened was because I am an idiot."
