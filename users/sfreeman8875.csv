thisismylifenow,fdm18t2,t1_fdm0t70,1578537403.0,She is the most beautiful and tolerant angel ever! Idk how I would be fostering without her
thisismylifenow,fdm16px,t1_fdlgoju,1578537363.0,She puts up with so much fostering! Typically I have new borns and she's used to the tiny ones but these are 12 weeks and already 16 pounds. She's a champ and my biggest helper!
