astrology,ff0wf4p,t1_fevr61l,1579472913.0,"If you have a strong knowledge base already, I would recommend Aquarius2Go for Android. It is a simple chart display app that does not give any interpretations or meanings in the app, which I appreciate since I'm more of a data-minded person and it also encourages me use my own brain power in chart reading.

It also has customizable graphics (you can pick your own colors for signs/planets/aspects/elements, as well as size of font/lines/planets). I am big on visual pleasure so I appreciate this.

It can do transits and solar returns/solar arc and composite charts and all that fun stuff, too. It also has an ""astro clock"" feature which displays the current chart for your position. I like this for checking current influences."

tifu,fetzq7o,t1_ferlh58,1579381662.0,"Who would downvote this? It's not off topic. I wish more people were honest about how shitty parenthood can be, because future children will be better off for it if we can take stock of ourselves honestly. 

That, and if we learned more about how children work *before* having them. OP clearly didn't know what sleep regression is which is what their child seems to be currently going through as is normal at 4 months of age. Sometimes it happens again at 8 and 18 months too, but after this stage the child settles into a regular sleep cycle that will stay with it into adulthood."
tifu,fetwz0y,t1_fes8uky,1579380908.0,"I'm baffled by all these parents who don't know what sleep regression is, or even other developmental quirks. They often have a hard time sleeping at 4 months before they settle into the sleep cycle they carry for the rest of their life. It's a normal and almost expected stage of a child's development, and temporary. 

And if it really isn't temporary with your kid, then it needs a doctor's advice and possibly treatment well before it needs glowing worms or objects in the crib at naptime."
tifu,fettmmm,t1_ferkuxe,1579379933.0,"If my child *literally could not sleep*, you bet your ass the first thing I'd do is haul it to the doctor or other health specialist for help and advice instead of hoping a glow worm will solve whatever health issues are going on.

 Animals don't need to be ""taught to sleep and eat,"" it sounds like this baby can sleep when it needs to just fine but parents are just being unhappy about *when* it sleeps... like it's an inconvenience. If it was out of love or concern they'd be seeing a doc, who would gladly tell them what sleep regression is because they clearly didn't already know or care to find out that this typically happens at 4 (and 8 and 18) months of age before baby's sleep becomes normalized."

AskReddit,fehsgjm,t1_fehnz1y,1579122971.0,"The UFCW, at least my local, is a fucking shitshow of a rat union that is paid out of the *company's* pocket in addition to their member's dues, we are lucky if we can get a union rep to even get back in touch with us within a month (let alone actually fucking fight for us on even a simple goddamned rightful grievance, not like that's their job or anything hurr durr). We have members getting paid a whole $5/hour more than other members doing the exact same jobs because of bullshit reasons the union doesn't give a rat's ass to fight. Anytime members bring shit up to the union it gets hummed and hawwed over until they pat your bum and tell you nothing is actually wrong, you're just being mad.

Can't speak for all local variants of this union, but UCFW specifically is fucking garbage for my fellow local workers. And this is in Canada where we enjoy far more adequate worker's rights than the US. We've been telling them for years that the company's productivity standards and their actual SOPs and safety rules are incompatible but they don't fucking listen. Nobody should have back issues in their fucking 20s because their employer is pressuring (or explicitly telling) them to ignore basic safe lifting to get things done faster and faster. But then when you get hurt, they go ""well why weren't you working safely?"" and they refuse to hear you tell them its not possible to work safely and up to the company's standard while the union goes ""well, sucks to suck.""

It wouldn't be better to not have any union, but I'd be a lot better off at a different one."
witchcraft,fehpxl4,t1_feheju9,1579121529.0,"I am wondering why OP thinks the relationship between her husband and his best friend would be *ruined* if OP's husband did the right thing by telling his friend that his partner is treating their relationship like garbage. If husband's friend would get upset and cut him off for trying to save his ass from wasting precious time with a *cheater*, then husband is better off without ""friends"" like that anyways and ""friend"" can stay in the bed he wants to lay in.

OP says they want all this out of their head, but they also seem to be putting a *lot* of energy into placing themselves into a situation that happened between their husband and someone else. And as far as I've read, I don't get the sense that OP distrusts their husband. I don't get why the husband is not the one handling this situation and telling this cheating lady to fuck off, even if its tricky for him he still needs to navigate this for himself. If OP trusts their husband, there is no need for worry or jealous anger because you know he won't do something wrong."
TwoXChromosomes,fehe68g,t1_feh6q5k,1579114697.0,"Yeah I'm sick and tired of getting disgusting vitriol from people who just have an issue with Abrahamism/Christianity and then project their displeasure with it onto *every other person of a different faith* instead of fucking picking themselves up some books and learning anything without being spoonfed. Their experience with religion tends to only be with Christianity/Abrahamic faiths and they don't know that there are completely different faiths operating under orthopraxy and different views of deity. They can't comprehend that a religion can also be atheist.

As a pagan I am literally the farthest and most detested thing to Christians, but the nonreligious and atheist treat me horribly because if I said I'm religious then it must be that I am Christian?

And, respectfully, no, that is not the only religion with adherents doing this work, freedom of sexuality/reproduction is near and dear to the general pagan community, you'll find many of them working for the same goal."
TwoXChromosomes,fehddjd,t1_feh1j42,1579114236.0,"It wouldn't matter. Even if there were 100 Commandments and they were reasonable, the Bible explicitly says all humans are imperfect and will never perfectly adhere to what God tells them to do. You don't have to follow them to be a Christian.

Your Christianity depends on the beliefs you hold, not the actions you carry out. This is known as an orthodoxic faith (as opposed to orthopraxic faiths whose membership depends on your actions/adherence to their rituals, and not your held beliefs), which all Abrahamic faiths are a part of. 

You can literally never read the Bible or go to church, and you can be a mass murderer. Yet as long as you hold the minimally required beliefs, you are a true Christian no matter what anyone else thinks or says."
