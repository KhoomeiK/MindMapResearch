KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff78w1k,t3_es0bfb,1579643433.0,"I've learned not to ask kids what they want or if it's ok if you can make something.  Make the food slap it in front of them,  and if it's familiar they will probably eat it. 

Also my husband threatens to eat the food they don't want which makes them want to eat it. Kids are weird."

insanepeoplefacebook,ff77fzq,t3_es04ze,1579642613.0,I had a guy in high school say a similar thing to me while we were driving alone in his truck.  He said members of three opposite sex can't really be friends without some sort of mutual attraction forming. I was also dating his best friend at the time. That was the last time I went anywhere with him alone.

facepalm,ff714rr,t1_ff70j0b,1579639042.0,"As I explained in another comment,  I'm more worried for my baby,  as she will need a few years to get vaccinated enough to be considered protected.  It's also well known that there is a small percentage of vaccinated people that have an ineffective vaccine, so they could be vulnerable to a disease you think you've protected them from. That's why everyone needs to be vaccinated so that those compromised individuals have a minuscule chance of being exposed to the disease.  And your comment about unvaccinated children having no diseases is so silly that I think you must be a troll."

PrequelMemes,ff6hp7o,t1_ff6h1mt,1579627434.0,Wow that's quite the reaction.  You didn't feel like it was symbolic of Luke and Liea coming together to defeat palpatine and the sith? That it was the love that they shared with Rey that made her strong? She brings all the Jedi together along with the lightsabers of Luke and Liea. I think using them both gave her the strength she needed.  But that's just my opinion.  It wasn't just the lightsaber itself that made her stronger it was what those lightsabers meant to her.
PrequelMemes,ff6gube,t1_ff6gc32,1579626904.0,No I don't think that's what they are referencing. They say 'force pull' not 'teleport'. I also think the teleportation of the lightsaber was set up well so im not mad about it.

Midwives,felioi7,t3_en4wr3,1579223105.0,"I think education is one of the best tools to fight any sort of anxiety or fear. Birthing classes aren't that expensive but I'm not sure if you absolutely must be pregnant to be able to attend. Taking my hypno-birthing classes really helped beat back my fear of child birth.  One of the best philosophies they teach is that child birth is not a medical emergency and labor without complications wont injure you no matter how intense contractions feel. Looking at child birth as bodily function that delivers your baby to you helped me not to fear it. 

It is also good to know and be prepared for complications as common as tearing to as severe as placental abruption. However knowing about complications and obsessing over them are two different things, and dont let your mind trick you into thinking that panicking or obsessing is the same thing as being prepared. My experience with severe panic and anxiety has taught me that it is a totally useless feeling that makes itself seem relevant or important. 

I hope you can over come your fear and I hope one day you can have a child of your own. Dont give up!"

Exactly. Being pregnant sucks. It takes so much out of you,  but you have hope that all will be worth it when you meet your baby for the first time. A baby you wanted and sacrificed so much for. You dream about how special they will be. How much you'll love them for who they are.  Then it's all ripped away from you. No cuddles, no kisses, no hearing their voice or seeing what they love about the world.

A guy on the street asked me if I had any money (I had none,  just my debit card) and he got all disgusted with me and told me I was 'part of the problem'. I felt like I should be guilty,  but no. I was living a very modest life,  trying to keep my head above water during school. I had a strict budget, which included donations to charity.
