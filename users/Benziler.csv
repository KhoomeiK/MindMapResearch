Hopefully your cat’s alright! Birds and other wild animals can make cats (and dogs) aggressive for no reason and overall not themselves when they interact or eat one.

Did I every day that it’s “not the cat owner’s fault”? No. It’s rude and unnecessary to assume, that’s how you lose a battle. 

Of course *BOTH* the dog and cat’s owners are going to be at fault. However, a cat can sense when a dog is going to attack; when they are aggressive and when they are sweet. Same for a dog. So it would not only be the dog and cat owner’s fault; it would be the dog and cat’s fault too.

Once an animal dies, it hits their owners like a bowling ball.
