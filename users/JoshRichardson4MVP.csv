When you advertise and encourage other young women to want to participate, they work harder because it’s something they’re passionate about. In time, the league gets better and better, the players become much more fun to watch, and it will make money. We’re already seeing this happen. I do watch the WNBA and can tell you they’re sure as shit on par with NBA teams from the late 70s. People make fun of them for not dunking, but if you’re only there to watch the dunks then you’re a simpleton who doesn’t have a greater appreciation for the game. There will be a day when they throw it down much more than they currently do. Women aren’t pursuing careers as WNBA players because it doesn’t make any financial sense, this is a fantastic move in the direction towards having another elite US basketball league to watch. It baffles my mind that people want to repress the growth of what could be something amazing. You can’t build an elite league overnight, it takes encouragement, financial health, and some god damn good ethics which people seem to forget all about when they talk about women’s sports.

How about the classic example of the roars from the lion king being done by Frank Welker and a trash can? Is it different considering those lions are more “characters” than Godzilla is?

Edit: maybe I’m unclear on your use of “manually recreates”?"

NBA2k,fe5u5u5,t1_fe4g76j,1578875012.0,You said you agree and then wrote a paragraph that directly contradicts the post.
NBA2k,fe5u2h0,t1_fe4i29e,1578874949.0,Intimidator is broken. Idk about OP but on standing layups you can literally be wide open and have a guy 2.5 feet behind you looking the opposite direction and they get credited for a heavy contest and you miss. There’s no way that makes sense.
BorderlandsPreSequel,fe5noz1,t1_fe5kvym,1578871906.0,"Wow I totally thought they meant story wise. But I endorse this answer and would like to add that Nisha is arguably best for casual players who don’t really want to aim. Claptrap isn’t great either though, so worst is a toss up imo. But jack, Athena, the baroness, and Nisha are definitely primary choices."

todayilearned,fe5cfjo,t3_enqlig,1578867688.0,Foley is the field of sound effects and it’s incredibly interesting. It’s a whole part of movies that we (normal consumers) just don’t understand.

HumansBeingBros,fe4wovh,t1_fe4g3lu,1578863453.0,Why would they be dropping infected food? It’s safe to assume these are farm quality and the same grade as consumers would get.
LifeProTips,fe0esct,t1_fe012ij,1578812106.0,"Maybe you should ask your superior how they’re supposed to sign off on the legitimacy considering they haven’t seen the vehicle yet. Obviously I don’t want you to risk your position, as this is all just a rat race where the top people are unreasonably compensated and everyone else is just getting by. But maybe it’s worth planting that seed to get things moving upward. Hopefully one day everyone at the top has a conscious."
todayilearned,fe0cycm,t1_fdzv4eb,1578810256.0,"Got into Mensa in the fifth grade through family pressure and was never interested in it. It always seemed like a bunch of weirdos going to an “I don’t have many friends” convention. Tbf the gift shop was great, they had cool lighters. But the spam mail honestly would’ve pushed anyone out. You’d be better off going to a book club or something actually intellectually engaging."
