bipolar1,fee9jdt,t3_eoamkr,1579029194.0,"The greatest lesson I learned from my therapist is chasing Euphoria doesn’t equate to happiness. Mania is fun while it lasts but the after effects are hell. We’ve all probably been here and I’m sending you tons of love to get through this. It’s possible but it’ll be hard and we’ll all be here to help along the way. Don’t feel guilty, the past is the past. Just focus on the present & future."
bipolar,fee67e4,t3_eofu2b,1579027232.0,This is dope!!
bipolar1,fe60tec,t3_eniamj,1578879247.0,"This is beautiful, thank you"
BipolarReddit,fdloo5d,t3_elwpa7,1578528833.0,"I was depressed for nearly a year after both of my manic episodes w/ psychosis + hospitalization. It’s absolute hell to say the least, especially the constant change of medications and therapy. Sending love and positivity. Wellbutrin does help a bit, your Pdoc just has to administer it well enough so it doesn’t push you towards mania again."
BipolarReddit,fd6eqnv,t1_fd5gfm3,1578189859.0,Wow okay thank you! I think I’m going to do this
bipolar,fd572xa,t3_ek1jib,1578174850.0,Way to go!! Proud of you
ENFP,fc7kjk6,t3_eginqs,1577510394.0,"Honestly, I studied Psych & Neuro Research and there’s no way I could personally take on the emotional load. Re-routing my career to Academia, I think we can also make a difference as educators!"
ENFP,fc6nsv7,t3_ege99l,1577485000.0,"Oh wow, I’m so happy I’m not the only one"
bipolar,fc45giu,t1_fc2t9e7,1577407127.0,"Thank you so much! And thanks for clarifying haha just a bunch of misunderstanding. I really wish you the best in finishing your Masters, you’ll really help comfort your patients because you’ve been in their place :) I’ll definitely keep making art if you keep pursuing education 🤝"
bipolar,fc2o5pc,t1_fc2njxl,1577368836.0,"Oh wow, this was really sweet. Thank you."
bipolar,fc2n6nl,t1_fc2n3bt,1577367839.0,"That’s fine, go ahead!"
bipolar,fc2n2bt,t1_fc2mo3b,1577367714.0,"Okay, so can you please explain to me the nature of your comment? I’m not really understanding because I have already apologized. I saw I made a mistake and tried to correct it, conveying my understanding that my comment was sour."
bipolar,fc2kpii,t1_fc2jye6,1577365061.0,I’m honest to God sorry. Check my post history as to why my brain is out of whack recently. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings and that’s just what I did. I’m sorry.
bipolar,fc2kmuu,t1_fc2k2oa,1577364972.0,Sorry for being the worst honestly. I don’t wish to spread hate on this platform.
bipolar,fc2kikd,t1_fc1uu44,1577364826.0,"I’m not trying to be rude but I came to reddit as the one place where I do not have to compete. This is the first time I’m sharing my art so I’m honestly sorry if for hurting yours or anyone else’s feelings by being too sensitive. Within the past month I’ve gotten diagnosed with heart disease, one of my friends was murdered, and I lost a best friend to brain cancer. My head for obvious reasons isn’t in the right place because of the grief I’m experiencing as a 22 year old. Again sorry for being the worst everyone, I took the comment negatively & I shouldn’t have. I’m just having a really hard time with life and that’s no excuse for being rude but as you can tell my brain is wired a bit differently."
bipolar,fc2k202,t1_fc22vbq,1577364225.0,Thank you for just trying to explain! I honestly appreciate it
