relationships,fc6so37,t3_egdqei,1577488479.0,"I just read a bunch of comments and your responses.   I think you're asking the right questions here and that will keep you from letting him gasslite you.  I suppose it doesn't help any that you love him and it probably hurts quite a bit with him basically making you feel like he doesn't want you? 

    Is that how you feel?  

      If I'm right then maybe you could communicate all this to him.  And how him constantly changing his mind is hurting you and making you feel unwanted.  Maybe you could try this before pushing for a counselor visit.  Usually if you try to be vulnerable with us men it triggers us wanting to be protective and we are more likely to communicate rather than just pointing your finger at him and saying you have issues.  I bet if you could get him to open up to you about this stuff in a more private way his love for you may deepen.  I think this is important because it wont make him feel powerless and that's an important th ok ng to us older men.  

   I'm near his age and have always loved it when a women opens up to me about these things."

Mechwarrior5Mods,fc2jkps,t3_efhmbr,1577363576.0,A lot of how a mech acts and performs is dependant on what skill pilot you have and what slot you put them in before you drop.  Slot 4 will always play fire support/range.  Slot 2 and 3 are your front lines.  Slot 2 will be the one that takes the most fire so you want you're heaviest armor and highest defensive skill pilots there.  It's not perfect but it works for now until mods and dlcs starts rolling.
