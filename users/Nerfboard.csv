They are supposed to be actually helping you learn the concepts to the best of their ability. You might be able to reach out to your academic center (the department who most likely hires the tutors) and talk to them about your experiences with these people, as that is absolutely unacceptable. 

It’s also unusual for academic advising to be filled with college students as opposed to trained professionals. Do you know if any of them are fully trained adults or if all of them are peers? Perhaps you could specifically request an adult if they have one available."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fc9mnwp,t1_fc9gwjl,1577554973.0,"I was forced to be homeschooled until college. Please, for the kids’ sake, let them go to real school. There’s no amount of activities you can bring them to that can be equivalent to or replace the daily interactions with peers and adults of an accredited public or private institution. This social interaction is a basic human need and critical for them developing the proper skills to navigate the adult world, not a privilege.


Also, no matter how smart you are it does not make you equipped to properly and fully educate a child (much less multiple children) in all subjects as necessary. My mother thought that and made that mistake, and what happened was I ended up having to struggle to teach myself or I didn’t learn at all. Even if you think you’ll do differently, burnout for both parents and children does happen. Teachers at public school are 1.) not responsible for the entirety of any one child’s education and 2.) *specifically trained for years and have the relevant degree to educate, especially in the subject they teach.*


I trust that you’re only seeking to do what’s best for your children, which is precisely why I’m writing this as someone with a full 12 years of experience from the other end of the situation. 

Your children are bright and full of potential, and I’m confident not only that they will learn quite well at an actual school, but that you can successfully support them and nurture their development and independence in that endeavor."

trashy,fc19d2a,t1_fc0kt74,1577312008.0,"I doubt it, honestly. Nothing against Channing Tatum, but people (esp celebrities in general) don’t usually have successful charges pressed against them for things like this. It is awful that he suffered a huge breach of trust and the person who leaked them *should* face backlash, but the gender of the perpetrator/survivor doesn’t play into it as much as you might think.


The culture surrounding consent and sexual harassment/assault or public humiliation still tends to be largely dismissive of victims of all ages and genders. Louis CK still has a career, Lena Dunham still has a career, the creeps that harassed Terry Crews and Brendan Fraser still presumably have careers. 

Progress is sadly slow but we need to push unilaterally instead of making it a competition and being unrealistic about current outcomes."
trashy,fc18wi2,t1_fc0hztf,1577311619.0,"Christ that’s such a horrifying breach of trust, I feel bad for him. The hypocrisy is definitely strong at Buzzfeed, and they seem to play into toxic gender stereotypes at times (ie, men are all hypersexual zombies therefore they don’t mind being objectified) and it’s uncomfortable. 


It’s not hard to respect people as people and not ogle them or seek out nude images of them that they didn’t consent to being released, regardless of gender. Consent applies to celebrities and nudes too, always."
