Add to the mix the biggest tax cut in recent memory, during an *expansion* which is completely against all understood economic theory. This means no revenue to fund stimulus.

Then throw in near 0 interest rates for the past 10 years while we should've been steadily raising it. That's resulted in practically no savings for anyone, everyone living on a razor's edge.

Add to that unprecedented levels of student and consumer debt across the board. Defaults could easily stall or collapse the financial system.

Add to that financial deregulation, and highly over leveraged businesses propped up on nothing but cheap debt.

Add to that heavy securities investing because nothing stable yields a worthwhile ROI, overexposing us to the market.

Add to that a public debt approaching 100% GDP

Add to that levels of inequality that haven't been seen in 100 years.
