follow your heart and be sure to be able to look into your own face at the end of every fucking day."
nihilism,fet5k99,t3_eqjer2,1579372026.0,Is this made just to trigger nihilists? thankfully I'm a nihilist so I don't care enough.
nihilism,feqf4tj,t1_feo0fh5,1579341169.0,"the box is made by yourself. the box is you keeping doing boring things. make it your goal to find something that fulfills you. if your out of ideas, search for workshops at your nearby community college (or similar schools, im not from the usa so I dont know how to call it).   
for me the whole world seems so incredible grey, but from time to time I'm encountering a moment that is so beautifully colourful that i try everything to remember and relive that feeling again. i found it in art (drawing), cooking (deserts), sports (swimming, climbing), being in the nature and loving. I'm quite openminded so I just try everything and then decide if i like it or not. but even if it isn't fun or feels uncomfortable, the challenge is to overcome that feeling. so i joined some kind of dancing group. I absolutely dislike dancing, but I already learned so much about myself.   
also I befriended new people who gave me even more input and ideas to try out. Life's not greater now, but I feel alive and busy and everyday is kinda different.

also it's right that you cant magically change your feelings. it's a process. a long and hard process. but if you don't like your current lifestyle, there shouldn't be anything stopping you from following those hardships into a maybe more interesting life.

those are just my thoughts and my way of trying to live. it's neither correct nor wrong, it just is. same as everything. you are. and that's all."
nihilism,feo01a6,t1_fenzbep,1579293269.0,think outside your box.
nihilism,fenys00,t1_fenqzaj,1579292767.0,"then you either didn't try everything or got depression.  
you could just change your lifestyle, like food, sports, social interaction. try something new and see for yourself what it does with you. how does your body feel in certain (unknown) situations. throw yourself into uncomfortable situations.   
are you afraid? do you feel fear? is that what it means to be alive?   
if you can't a reason to live on, why not just doing whatever you feel like. explore your soul and body, not only your mind. 

is it boring? how and where exactly do you feel that boredom in your body? are there other feelings buried under your boredom? isn't being bored kinda interesting?"
nihilism,fenqlvq,t3_eq4rsd,1579289364.0,try doing something interesting. even breathing can be fun. the problem isnt the world. it's your attitude. your brain is just another muscle. train it. lie to yourself until everything's fine.
nihilism,fd1as4o,t3_ejr9m8,1578129285.0,"like a normal human being.

to be able to feel is the greatest joy humans was given."
