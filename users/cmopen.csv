motivation,fd60iai,t1_fd5qwsx,1578183833.0,"Let me give you a better understanding. If you put the time and work towards your dreams and goals at a young age. Such as getting good grades, saving up money, so basically doing what is important and necessary in order to succeed and make your dreams a reality. Instead of wasting time going to clubs, chasing women, slacking in school, wasting money and so on. Later in life, you will have the freedom to enjoy it more while you're still young compared to the rest. For instance, someone who is an entrepreneur runs their own business, makes their own schedule and makes 6 figures. Some of these successful entrepreneurs have the freedom to travel a lot and do the things they want in life."
