Despite being the most population dense state it still has higher quality of life than most right wing states because it has better healthcare and education.

Third world relates to countries neutral towards both the US and Soviet Russia, what you're looking for is Developing World. The deep south is where you're likely to find people living in condition akin to the developing world. Lower life expectancy, poorly educated, extreme religious beliefs, virtually no upward mobility. 

Yeah they have lower taxes but that's literally because their states are subsidizing their low tax rate by depending on the federal government to pay for things their tax payers should be. The only reason it's sustainable is because blue states pay more to the government than they get in taxes. Conservatives love the redistribution of wealth when it benefits them but balk at the idea off paying their fair share. There's a reason our country's deficit shoots up anytime a Republican is in office and lowers when there's a Democrat.

The Jedi were aware of other dark side cults existing, like the Nightsisters, but left them alone since they didn't really cause any galactic scale incidents.

It's ironic that the sequel trilogy obsesses over building bigger and bigger superweapons and yet somehow the scope constantly feels smaller.

In Legends the New Republic actually did get their hands on an Imperial super weapon prototype called the Sun Crusher. It was a tiny, heavily armored, ship that carried torpedoes which could cause a sun to go supernova. Some in the New Republic wanted to use it on the Empire but the cooler heads decided to drop it into Yavin Prime.

For all they like to bitch about the taxes they still move there, buy property, and set their residency to California. 

All the rich people flocking in and buying up property like crazy is pricing the natives out, hence the flight to cheaper areas. They've also lobbied the state government for decades to prevent the building of high density housing to relieve the housing crisis because it would negatively impact their investments.

So as usual the problems stem from rich people flush with too much cash manipulating the government for personal gain. According to conservatives the only way to fight this is to cut their taxes down to nothing so they'll have more money.

Nobody knew what it was really for, but every planet with the slightest bit of mineral wealth felt the sting. And the second Death Star was likely sped along by them collecting the debris from the first one instead of having to pull it out of the ground. 

Also the Unknown Regions are virtually impossible to navigate. You have to system jump which is slow as hell and potentially dangerous. There's no hyperspace lanes to efficiently move material around because the whole region is one big anomaly that's always shifting."

The Empire caused a decades long galaxy-wide metal shortage when it was building the first Death Star as depicted in the new Thrawn trilogy and Rebels to some extent. The First Order built that when they didn't have the resources of the Galaxy backing them up in only ~~5~~a few years?

EmpireDidNothingWrong,fdvunxd,t1_fdvqnyn,1578751669.0,">There were remnants that hung on after Palpatines death (as we see in The Mandalorian), and those people eventually came together to form the First Order.

If only that were the case. What we're told in the Aftermath series is that Palpatine created the First Order. He hand picked the best, most capable, officers and personnel, orchestrated a big fake death for the Empire at Jakku, loaded all his favorites into his personal Super Star Destroyer, and had them sail off into the Uncharted Regions. 

Then this is where it gets stupid. Somehow in the span of 30 years they created massive shipyards and resource gathering operations and logistical systems for creating an enormous fleet and fighting force. And then they built a planet sized super weapon that put both Death Stars to shame in the span of ~~5~~ a few years without anyone noticing. 

And again, these guys are supposed to be the cream of the crop so they wouldn't make the mistakes the Empire often made due to political appointee, dead weight, commanders and Vader/Palpatine reining in military procedure for their own machinations right? 

Nope. They do stupid shit like firing their artillery at the empty ground base instead of the Mon Cal Cruiser preparing to leave. And they engage in a pointless days long chase of a ship when they could have just micro-jumped a couple Star Destroyers to cut off their run and reduce the chance of them escaping to 0.

Their origin was interesting. An Old Republic prison ship was scuttled on Dathomir millennia ago after the prisoners rioted. In the highest security cell was a Dark Jedi who promptly declared herself queen. But inexplicably only her female descendants were ever force sensitive. The trait never manifested in any male creating a permanently matriarchal society. Their understanding of the force dwindled to the point where they believed in ritual and superstition. And dark siders were cast out of the clans but gathered together in the [Night Sisters](https://i.imgur.com/mhJXsJW.jpg) coven. Palpatine was aware of the Night Sisters and was rightly terrified of the idea of them getting off the planet so had it permanently blockaded. 

It all highlighted how mysterious and unpredictable the force is and I loved it. In new canon the weird [Dathomiran race](https://i.imgur.com/TWoxC1W.png) whose males were all Zabrak and females were all Rattataki never felt as well thought out and developed. The one thing I'll give new canon credit for is they had completely different ways of using the force compared to Jedi or Sith which was interesting.

You're essentially judging the entire book on a weak first chapter.

That was a fun little nod that helped get into the character's head and accept that he's always several moves ahead of everyone. When he seems ignorant or helpless more often than not he's testing the people around him. 

The Sherlock-esque deductive reasoning and Eli Vanto playing our beleaguered Dr. Watson were nice additions to that. And I agree his rise through the ranks was a fulfilling story. Furthermore I enjoyed the way he groomed his subordinates for success. That was a small part of his original EU appearance but it was really expanded upon in a wholesome way here.

PrequelMemes,fdcq51f,t1_fdcp9sg,1578281243.0,"The Darth Bane book was the first place where it was mentioned.

Revan fought in the name of peace. When he found the Sith Empire he wanted to destroy it and tried to decapitate it. Because he believed peace had to be established with power the Emperor was able to manipulate him into joining the dark side. Vitiate sent him out to find and capture the Star Forge which would advance the Sith Empire's timeline for their military buildup considerably. Revan instead took it for himself and tried to conquer the Republic so he could unify them under his banner and return to the destroy the Sith. However the Jedi captured him and were able to turn him back to the light. 

So yeah, I guess I could see him having a holocron to contain his musings on the dark side in general, but the Rule of Two seems like something that would only benefit the Sith. Perhaps Bane just reached the conclusion of the Rule of Two inspired by Revan's philosophy rather than Revan creating the rule and Bane just copying him.

He wiped out all the remaining Sith with his apprentice and set into motion the generational plan for revenge.

The Sith were a force sensitive culture though, so they had holocrons and force ghosts which could teach new acolytes. The Banite Sith would wipe out anyone foolish enough to claim the title of Sith though. In theory once Palpatine and Vader died a new Sith order could have flourished, and did in Legends.

Every now and then it's due to incompetency because many commissioned officers were political appointees with little to no skill. But the crux of the matter is the whole concept behind the First Order is there were no political appointees to drag them down because the Empire didn't exist anymore. The First Order was founded by people who were hand selected for their ability and not their social standing. They're supposed to be the elite of the elite, the Empire with all the fat trimmed off. Making such obvious and stupid mistakes is supposed to be beneath them. 

It's the Stormtrooper problem. Ben Kenobi praises Stormtrooper accuracy, we're told they're an elite fighting force.

According to the documents he submitted to the crown Columbus' rule as governor was marked by extreme brutality. According to a letter sent by Columbus to the crown in his defense his brutality was attempting to stop the heinous exploitation of the natives by Spanish settlers.
