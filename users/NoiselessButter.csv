Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.


Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

cats,fem2k6n,t3_eppit4,1579237657.0,"Im in the same boat , litter maid looks ok (doesnt require expensive crystal litter like the other one with that design) especially since I have one big cat.

Omega paw is barely an upgrade from a standard box but no electronics means no cord for them to chew.

Cat genie is awesome if you have room in your bathroom (hooks up to a water supply) which I dont.

Obv were both talking litter robot when we talk about the 500 dollar one that we cant afford

Pet safe simply clean , apparently a smallish area and according to some reviews the mechanism isnt great but idk , other reviews say it was fine so maybe its finicky depending on the litter you choose?

What's wrong with me?
Why am I sick?
What will cure me?
What do I have to do get well?

A big thing I think is important coming from a western avrahamic tradition and exploring buddhism is that dukkha doesnt mean ""suffering"" in the day to day sense we are familiar with. It means that and more , broadly speaking the closest i've seen is to describe it as ""unsatisfactoriness""

Which relates to the impermanence of all forms.

Another thing to keep in mind is that buddhism split from hinduism during a period of philosophical renaissance in india. Rebirth was taken for granted in the same way that abrahamic religions (except judaism) presuppose this one life followed by damnation or paradise. So understanding that going in is clarifying."
