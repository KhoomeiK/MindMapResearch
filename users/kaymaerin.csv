My favourites are Kirakishou and Souseiseki though."

vegan,fe55lfk,t3_ennih7,1578865839.0,"Where I live even restaurants with vegan options 99.9% of the time don't have a vegan dessert, not even raw fruit... so I just stay there, doing something in my phone when everyone is enjoying theirs (I don't envy them though, I've came to a point where non-vegan desserts either gross me out or make me feel like I gained 10kg just by looking at them).

There's only one non-vegan restaurant I've found that has a vegan option for dessert - it is raw, but raw-prepared; a delicious cheesecake!"

childfree,fe1chhl,t1_fe0szrg,1578825020.0,"Actually you're quite mistaken.

His audience is not really CF people, as most of us already know (at least at a basic level) all what having kids implies and don't want them. The book is for those dubious/questioning, as well for those who really don't know/think about it. The point is to make people *actually* think about having children and its consequences; whether they have them or decide not to is still their choice in the end.

However, I understand some missed the content of it or don't understand Spanish, so here is a translation of the title and the description of the book:

>***Are you sure you want to have kids?***  
>  
>*The most important decisions in one's life must never be taken lightly.*  
>  
>*Find out about the reality of what it means to have kids and their impact on your life, on society and on the planet.*  
>  
>*Procreation can be darker than you imagine.*"

demons,fdx8wok,t3_emtxes,1578766418.0,"If it didn't harm you in any way (and you even mentioned what it was doing felt nice), it's something you shouldn't be afraid of, no matter how creepy it looked (looks can be deceiving).  
The fact that you woke up quickly could be also a sign it was trying to make you feel more at ease."
