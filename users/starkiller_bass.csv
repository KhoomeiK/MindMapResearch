TeslaModel3,fekm667,t1_fekf9j7,1579202935.0,"The SC network is the only reason that many people in places like So Cal CAN own a Tesla.  It’s prohibitively expensive to own a home and renters can’t usually make major electrical modifications to their home and certainly not to an apartment.  Landlords don’t have any incentive to solve this problem until electric cars begin to dominate the market.  Tesla is bridging an early adoption issue with their own network of chargers and by continuing to promise that this is growing they keep selling cars, so they should bear some of this pressure."

There was much rejoicing and very few leftovers.  I think if we cooked MUCH longer it could have been a problem breaking down the meat too much, but for a thicker and tougher cut like that it really seemed to maximize the flavor and tenderness."
Futurology,fdkj9zo,t1_fdjub23,1578504888.0,"I'm not at all against killing animals for food; some of my work is attached to the industry as well, though the operation I work with is definitely on the ""boutique"" end of the scale, relatively small herd, grass fed, organic, etc etc etc.  I don't know what kind of farming you do, and don't intend any judgment against whatever work you're involved in, but I imagine most farmers/ranchers would PREFER to be raising animals in a more natural environment and replace the industrial-scale animal operations with something else if possible.  Factory-scale operations employ less people for a given amount of product and tend to only be profitable for the huge industry operators who own them, which seems to have only been damaging to individual farmers."
Futurology,fdkik1u,t1_fdjom1q,1578504530.0,"I know it's probably a little bit idealistic but what I'd love to see is less need to kill for low quality ""bulk"" meat like ground meats, stew meat, sausage, ""nuggets"" etc, which could eliminate the need for massive-scale ""factory"" farms where unhealthy conditions are sustained simply to maximize growth rate, and make it more viable and profitable to raise animals in a more natural setting.  If cultured tissue operations scale well that would mean we could have healthy and clean meat products available on a massive scale without subjecting animals to inhumane conditions, and still have sustainable farming operations to produce high quality meats that would likely sell at some premium.  The absolute best products WOULD probably be out of the price range of less fortunate individuals but that has always been the case and likely always will be, but I'm imagining that having this option as an alternative to industrial-scale farming COULD potentially be better for people and the planet as a whole."
Futurology,fdjd3pc,t1_fdiwidy,1578465893.0,"My hope is that fishing and ranching will be HEAVILY limited and “natural” meats will eventually be an indulgence for special occasions, and priced accordingly, so small operations can produce a more ethical, less damaging product and still be profitable.
