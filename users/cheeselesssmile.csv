PoliticalHumor,fehsptl,t1_fehibke,1579123116.0,"I think the religious right is really to blame here. They are overly concerned with the idea that babies are being ""murdered"" by abortion, throw the images in front of their churches and in their Sunday school classes, these people see ripped apart fetuses in these pictures and it's disturbing. 

 It's an in-your-face technique which is blackmailing them by their faith and the fear of hell. They don't read the science and don't see the human side of the mother for some reason. If they do, it's to spread this manipulative technique. 

 They are guilted into voting for the right by it. 

A lot of them are women that see it that way and more than one of them have defended their voting for Trump because of their ""Christian beliefs"". . . They really mean, ""conservatives are anti-abortion"" therefore, they just be on the side of God. They are single issue republicans. 

The thing that confuses me is what this cartoon pinpointed-is the thought that life only matters before birth, then, ""you're on your own, kids!""

Former conservative here.

I once attended a mock-state government assembly (for high school/ middle school) and a student wrote a bill to ban abortion after five months due to the science behind an infant's develop at that stage. (Beside the point) The 90% conservative assembly wouldn't pass the bill because the bill didn't outlaw all abortion, but just 'some' of it. Instead of furthering their own cause, their all or nothing stance killed the bill. . . 

Their own inability to compromise is astonishing. It was a microcosm of the national government and that episode said it all."

He likes going to therapy right now, but that's because he's feeling successful.

I'm not sure about loading him down with an ABA. I've thought some ABA suggestions would be helpful for me, but I don't know what's best for him. 

I always ask him what he wants/needs and he's good at communicating that to me.
