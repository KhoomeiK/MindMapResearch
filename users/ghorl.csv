Maps,fdf3l4h,t3_ekx2z5,1578352520.0,It's good because it shows the relative sizes of countries more accurately but bad because some things are tilted so that there can be no cardinal points which makes it a bit disorienting
wikipedia,fdeoee7,t1_fdelo3k,1578343270.0,The world is changing to become more inclusive and this woman is trying to update wikipedia to reflect these changes.
wikipedia,fdejwv3,t1_fdeh65g,1578340598.0,">Just because there are a bunch of articles about orange things doesn’t mean that I should pursue my agenda of promoting purple things by writing a bunch of articles about purple things

Sure except we're not talking about things we're talking about people. People who have been systematically ignored and underwritten about and mistreated. When you put it like that it's implying that colour is insignificant, which it would be if we were just talking about objects. When we talk about poc for example colour does matter since it's why they get fewer articles in the first place. 

If no one decided that there ""aren't enough articles about x"" then there wouldn't be any articles about x.

Edit: I also just wanted to add that I wasn't making assumptions because I was clearly asking a question instead of assuming anything."

So are you against the spread of knowledge regarding female, poc, lgbtq+ scientists? It seems like you are being very critical and I really don't understand why."

AskReddit,fcl9fwo,t3_ehsj4d,1577742692.0,Women are built better in that we dont have our most sensitive parts dangling outside of our bodies. There just isn't a move equivalent to a kick to the balls. To be fair though a punch to the tit really can hurt but less so because they're not as sensitive as balls.

On the other hand, sending a nude picture directly into a  person's private messages without consent is targeted harassment."
