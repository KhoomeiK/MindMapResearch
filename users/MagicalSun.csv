when an egg gets fertilized, the embryo doesn't just become sentient and lives, that's not how it works. if you think that an embryo is alive, i suggest you stay far away from trees and grass because they're sentient too, according to your logic.

if a woman wants an abortion, thats her choice. fucking deal with that, and focus on other problems that actually affects you."

when i get my period, i normally dont get any cramps or physical pain, but i get REALLY bad PMS (basically alot of mood swings and feeling sad and horrible) and my periods normally last for around 6-7 days

for others, its different. for example, when my sister got her first period, she was in so much pain she was vomiting and had to lay in bed all day

and for some others, they just bleed and get minor side effects, but not many people are like that

in general, periods suck lol"
