The storyline with Punk was also pretty personal due to Paul's death, so it felt like a good way to end it.

I dunno, I just never wanted the streak to end, it was unique and kind added to his character and with him having lost twice, I felt it has hurt the streak, especially with how bad his match against Reigns was."

WTF,fe2hmkc,t1_fe1yvyg,1578838423.0,"The Dutch don't know how good their railway network is. Trains with leg room, doubledecker trains, different types from intercity, fast and sprinter that have different purposes, trains that arrive generally 5-10 minutes before departure giving people time to get on, etc.

In the UK? All trains are the same. They're all old and generally noisy. They arrive 30 seconds before departure, so you have to rush to get on, no leg room and all trains are small and claustrophobic, seats are small and you sit shoulder to shoulder.

Sure, there's Virgin with a neat train taking you from North to South, but that's also expensive as fuck.

Oh, trains in the UK are generally expensive as fuck.

Honestly, trains in the Netherlands are bliss."
WTF,fe2gf58,t1_fe1xne7,1578838048.0,"It's not a very good train in all fairness. There was a big outcry as the original ones did not have toilets and as they're usually slower trains that stop at each stop, it meant passengers had to hold their toilet needs until they got off the train.

I think newer versions have, but only on the longer routes."

Problem is, you can see this kind of behaviour elsewhere on social media where they think it's okay to call somebody fascist, transphobe or whatever other buzz word because they don't say the exact right words, like how they constantly call Pewdiepie a fascist or neo Nazi and how Oney got called all sorts of names because he critiqued a comic."
