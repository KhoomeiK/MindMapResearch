> Also, are my energy levels really going to plummet and make it impossible to enjoy playing sports and going out? Or is that just a side-effect for people with busy family lives, stressful jobs, bad health, etc. that typically come with age

For me, exercise increases my energy levels, although it's a more mellow, even keel sort of thing. I'd actually argue that the bad health and stress are side effects of not enough activity or bad diets. The busy family life can be difficult, but manageable.

I'll tell you this: I was overweight entering my 30's. At 40+, I have been a healthy weight for years, and it all came down to diet. Exercise just gave me that extra push and keeps me feeling fantastic, although I'm not as fast as I used to be, and I have to keep a close eye on not getting injured.

AskReddit,fenvfq7,t1_feml9xo,1579291500.0,"By going to the gym regularly, you are putting in a **huge** investment to being able to live a longer, healthier life.

Everything doesn't work the same, but barring injuries, you can mitigate even the worst of it. So that's rule \#1: don't get injured. It takes more time to heal as one gets older, although exercise helps one heal faster, but keep in mind that ""recovery"" training is hella different from 1RM, and it might be a bit frustrating.

Rule \#2: Always warmup. Always stretch. You might even need to focus on fixing muscle imbalances or working on balance and flexibility as you get older.

Rule \#3: Cardio. Even light cardio (such as walking) is beneficial. Just realize it's much as the reps/sets tradeoff of strength training: lower intensity = more volume.

Rule \#4: You have to keep doing it consistently. This is especially why it's important not to get injured. Not only is it harder to get back to where you were from injury, but as you get older, it gets *even* harder, and at some point it gets impossible. So don't stop. Don't go balls to the wall every session (too much = injury), but don't skip, ever.

Rule \#5: Learn to play with tradeoffs of intensity and volume. RSI is often a concern, especially for younger lifters who might have bad form and are just after those gains. As one gets older, more experienced and better form, one tends to lower the weight on the bar, but up the reps to compensate with volume, as the higher weights carry a higher incidence of injury in older lifters.

Keep in mind that skill based sports (such as rock climbing) can benefit a lot from experience and ""non-exercise"" training.

Diet is another thing to pay attention to. You can outeat gym gains, and metabolism only slows down 1-2% *per decade*[1]; all weight gain is from eating too much. Over a long enough timeline, being overweight will wreak havoc with your body and even stop you exercising eventually.

ETA: For me, strength training *reduces* aches and pains, especially done regularly. Exercise keeps you young!

I'll paint you two pictures though. My wife (now ex-) bought her house straight out of college before we married, early twenties. We refinanced to a shorter term it while married and IIRC, she'll have it paid off here soon. Starting early and timing the market help immensely.

After we separated, I managed to save up and get a house of my own while nearing 40. It took a few years, but being established and having climbed the career ladder helped.

So, you can be cunning, frugal and lucky and start young, or you can wait till you're better established, but buying a house ""right now"" (while you are young) is not a hard requirement, especially if you intend to job hop (a reliable way to climb the career ladder). Another excellent tactic is live very frugally, renting as close as possible to work, all while job hopping in a HCOL area with really good pay, save a shit-ton of money, then retire early somewhere LCOL with your savings and buy a house.

All that being said, rent is a black hole; you'll never see that money again. I try not to treat my house as an investment vehicle, but it is a great bargaining chip if/when I decide to move."
