UpliftingNews,ffbi7ur,t1_ffb5wv2,1579766481.0,"As a pro-gun leftist I do hate how the far-right has been trying to handle gun rights. I feel like because of them support for gun rights has gone down because all the wackos are the one taking up all the air space.

Hell even with the recent pro-2A protest in Virginia a leftist lawmaker had to go in a safehouse because far-right pro-gun activists were sending numerous death threats over a bill they misunderstood. The irony is that this lawmaker himself is pro-gun I believe. I'm glad the protest went peaceful, would have looked really bad if it didn't, but far-right gun nuts have been giving pretty bad image for gun rights over the years."

PoliticalDiscussion,ffb568y,t1_ffallos,1579752082.0,"I thought the whole idea of people getting more conservative as they get older was actually shown to [not be entirely true](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/) and that the biggest influence on people's politics tends to happen in their youth and then generally sticks with them to some extent. Some datas seems to show that in the U.S at least certain age brackets that came of age during certain presidencies had a leaning towards a certain way that may have made them lean more Democratic or Republican compared to the nation at average.

I can sort of see how maybe on a fiscal level how some people may become more conservative, particularly with those who get wealthier (in contrast to those who don't). But on social issues people are most certainly not regressing on social politics overtime based on the general trend of social liberalism that has happened. Could just be more so that as more socially progressive policies get accepted it sort of shifts the spectrum on social progressivism vs social conservatism."

SandersForPresident,ff9d1x2,t1_ff976nl,1579710307.0,Warren reaching 15% isn't really too bad since her delegates could still realign at a convention if needed and if Bernie still performs significantly better than her then I can still see a bunch of the Warren-Sanders people moving to Bernie. Though it would put Bernie in a stronger position if she did get below 15%.

SandersForPresident,ff8mr8h,t1_ff7fk5s,1579686291.0,Keep in mind this is a Republican internal which likely means the poll is more biased towards the GOP.

PoliticalDiscussion,ff8hva7,t1_ff88i1o,1579679193.0,"I mean the current general election polling (I know its early but it's a form of data we have right now at least) does show how Bernie tends to be the 2nd most electable Dem to put against Trump based on polling. Warren is behing Bernie on that. The most electable shown in polling is Biden.

So there can be some arguments to suggest Bernie is more electable than Warren. Idk about straight up claiming unelectable tho."
PoliticalDiscussion,ff8hm27,t1_ff8g501,1579678867.0,"Yeah Abrams would be a good pick for Bernie if that is possible.

PoliticalDiscussion,ff6ykg9,t1_ff6rcc9,1579637540.0,I mean it can both be true that progressive policies could become more popular while the Supreme Court fights against it.

Ginsburg tho not looking too well right now.
PoliticalDiscussion,ff28mru,t1_ff0hz7q,1579497010.0,"It all hinges on Iowa. If Sanders gets Iowa by a decent margin then he'll likely being able to build the momentum to get the next 2 states and keep his margins close in SC and other Southern states. This is pretty much the path for Warren as well, and for Pete sort of but it'll be harder for him since he's still polling low nationally.

Iowa is basically a make or break sort of thing for most of the candidates. Pretty much Joe Biden is the only candidate could still have a decent chance at winning the nomination without Iowa. For the rest their chances are either greatly diminished or just non-existent if they don't win Iowa."

Though I agree Trump won't be easy for them to beat. At the moment I'm thinking the most likely result based on what we now up to today is Trump narrowly winning but with a lower EC margin. Of course Trump is an anomaly so any wild changes could happen by the time election day comes around."

PoliticalDiscussion,fep7fba,t1_fen670l,1579313821.0,Yeah I'd be a little concerned about the rise of the Klob if I was a moderate candidate like Biden. Klobuchar could possibly end up sapping some of their support but then end up failing to meet the 15% threshold in most places.
PoliticalDiscussion,fep6s7u,t1_fep5afa,1579313411.0,"I'm not sure how SurveyUSA polling in CA is compared to other CA polling but assuming this is representative of CA I think a big aspect of this is the fact that the progressive vote has a pretty big split between Sanders and Warren and then there's a whole bunch of other candidates taking a small amount of the vote. There are some moderate spoilers but none as big as the top 3 polling here.

However, I feel like by the time we get past the early stages there will probably be 1 candidate that progressives will coalesce by the time super tuesday comes around depending on what happens in the early states. And that Biden will likely end up being the candidate moderates coalesce around.

I do think it could be possible for Biden to win in CA. Biden could possibly do quite well in the early states and then carry that momentum into it. But at the moment I personally want to see how Iowa turns out before jumping to some conclusions."
PoliticalDiscussion,feilfuw,t3_ep3s1d,1579141278.0,"This and the recent clip released from the post debate further confirms my theory that Tom Steyer only joined the race because he was he was a big fan of Bernie and wanted to get his autograph. (/s of course)

But in all seriousness what you said could be a side effect regardless if that's what he'd want or not. Steyer seems keen on Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday rather than Iowa and New Hampshire. I don't think he'll end up winning barring some really strong results. While he would eat into Biden's base in those places it likely won't be enough for him to win. Especially since I feel like the race will coalesce on a few candidates after Iowa.

Iowa will probably narrow this down to 3 main candidates (I think its likely one of the top 4 will underperform enough to get them out of the equation) with people like Bloomberg, Steyer, and anyone else staying being spoilers."

PoliticalDiscussion,fefp49m,t1_fefogcg,1579061304.0,"Yeah Biden has a huge lock on older and moderate types of black voters, of which there is a lot of. And pretty much most of the younger progressive kind of black voters are gonna be supporting Bernie or Warren instead of Pete. 

Pete doesn't really have a lot of room to grow into that, and that isn't even considering the controversy back in South Bend. People are also talking about how him being gay makes him less likely to win over black voters due to religion, while that probably has an effect I doubt that would be the only thing.

It feels like Warren is already trying to move on from the whole thing and I wouldn't be surprised if both Warren and Sanders try to avoid going hard on this whole issue. 

I doubt it will suddenly cause a major shift in second choice voters. I imagine most of Bernie voter's 2nd choice will still be Warren, and most of Warren voter's 2nd choice will be Bernie."

SandersForPresident,fdzd8rp,t1_fdz9rv0,1578789099.0,Yeah I'm kind of hoping either that happens (from Warren potentially performing badly in the early states) or the race becomes a Bernie vs Warren scenario.

SandersForPresident,fdu3sq6,t1_fdtcx5e,1578727037.0,"Yeah. 2nd choice voter totals aren't gonna matter too much for Iowa. Because a lot of it is overlap between the top 4. It matters more when you get to the point of candidates dropping out.

For example Warren is leading when second choice voters are added but a lot of those second choice voters are probably Bernie first supporters. I think it's a given that Bernie, Pete, and Biden will probably break 15% in most Iowa caucus precincts so the second choice voting from them won't matter as much. It'll matter a lot more for those whose first choices are people who likely won't get 15% in most precincts such as Klobuchar, Yang, Booker, Gabbard, etc."

Maybe its an unpopular take here but tbh I think that could cautiously be a good thing. I feel like with how the past seasons have gone we saw what 10 seasons of writing a show has been for 1 guy. Maybe with things going back to the spy agency roots and the change in writers it might help breathe some fresh air into the series."
SandersForPresident,fdp12s1,t1_fdovqos,1578617481.0,Yeah the best case scenario is that Steyer gets like 14% which mostly takes away votes from Biden. And it's under the qualifying amount for getting any delegates so he won't have any that would switch over to Biden eventually.
worldnews,fdkxa9q,t1_fdktoue,1578513061.0,Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if it was like this. Which would be ironic since Republicans kept on trying to claim that Iran wasn't keeping up their part of the Nuclear deal lol.
PoliticalDiscussion,fdkvvya,t1_fdjpv97,1578512240.0,"I agree with your 2nd and last paragraph. Buttigieg is basically placing all his bets on Iowa and yeah if Biden gets the first 4 states then he's basically guaranteed to win.

Your 3rd paragraph isn't necessarily wrong but Buttigieg has been trying to paint himself as a more moderate candidate in this race. At some point after one of the first states progressives will either coalesce under Sanders or Warren depending on how each of them perform."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdibw4a,t1_fdhy7n3,1578439438.0,"Yeah despite the modern trend of the Iowa Caucus winner for the Dems becoming the one who wins the nomination I wouldn't be surprised if this primary could end up bucking that trend. Whoever comes out ahead in Iowa will certainly get a boost but it doesn't guarantee anything.

Biden can most certainly still have a path to the nomination without Iowa or NH. Pete winning Iowa could give him a boost but it doesn't mean all of the older black voters and moderates will immediately flock to them. Even if Biden doesn't win Iowa he's likely to get a decent amount of delegates anyway."
