Poc don't need help because they're *incompetent*. They need help because they're *disadvantaged*.

The reality is that black and brown people are disproportionately affected by poverty and systemic racism. They don't have the same number of opportunities that a white person has, and our society has done and continues to do a lot to prevent those communities from being successful. 

That's why people like me think affirmative action is a pretty good idea. It's a drop in the bucket compared to everything we do and have done to prevent their success."
