But I remember the first makeup product I was introduced to was concealer. Also to cover my acne when I was like 16. I thought it was like magic, but didnt care that much to wear it on a daily basis. I started worrying about my appearance in college when I first dated a guy (lol what a loser)"

Kos√© speedy cleansing oil: it takes my makeup off instantly but this particular Disney Princess edition has fragance

Hada labo hyaluronic acid foaming cleanser: very gentle and it has no fragance

Dickinson's original witch hazel: i use this after cleansing to take off any makeup residue. Sometimes I replace it with miscellar water

Hada labo premium hydrating lotion: I use this kind of product before the cerave cream because Dr. Dray told me so. (Or so I think)

Cerave moisturising cream: the classic cream in a tube. I use it for face and body.

depression,fcdutef,t3_egxcz7,1577614016.0,"I identify a lot with your story. I fell in love with a guy with a girlfriend and became his side chick. I liked him so I thought that just thar was enough to make me happy. Then I was crying because I was constantly telling him that I loved him and he refused to say it back every time. He even asked me sarcastically if I wanted him to break up with her actual gf. As if was impossible to actually be with someone like me. He left the country and now he is probably married to his gf, idk. As revenge I started sleeping with several men that  didn‚Äôt care for or that bought me stuff. Some of them were married and all of them were ashamed to be with me. Because of this I got a really bad reputation and lost my best friend. Now I have deleted half of the people from my social media because of the shame. Last year I went overseas and got a bf. He found my meds and still was ok with dating me even though I was depressed. He held my had in public every time, took me to a very childish amusement park that I wanted ro go and told me that he loved me. Right now Im in a long-distance relationship with him that most likely is going to end since we have no money to travel to see each other and he doesn‚Äôt make an effort anymore to talk to me (its been 3 months and we have talked by phone once).
Sorry for the long story. The thing is I relate to you and I think our situation can change if we surround ourselves with people who actually care, even though its hard to not isolate ourselves."
