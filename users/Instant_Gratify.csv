I've found these estimates are not great.

Also, parallel compress is nice for speed, but you sacrifice compression efficiency for that. I'm not knowledgable enough to tell you exactly why, but it has something to do with the fact that you're basically splitting up the dataset so that the chunks can be compressed individually, this isn't optimal when generating the dictionary.

Why is the author conveniently brushing over the fact there was a teacher strike under Wynne administration (2?). There were at least two strikes under McGuinty. 

If this isn't blatant and obvious bias, I don't know what is.


> Teachers are considered liberal, and condemned for having long vacations and leaving work at 4 p.m..

That's why they've gone to strike under every single Liberal government since Harris, right?



> Because they receive payment for the summer, teachers are paid less for the rest of the year;

What a misleading, dishonest sentence.


The following numbers are ***examples*** chosen because it made the head math easier.

Teachers are salaried, let's say they make $12,000/yr. That means they get $1,000/mo for 12 months. If they got paid for 9 months (no summer) that would be $1,333/mo.

They still make $12,000 a year, but the way the author worded it makes it sound like they are making less money.

Then you don't understand the realities at play here.

Iran doesn't have the military capabilities to consistently project power **within their own local sphere of influence**, let alone projecting power globally. 

It's just no contest, at all, and Iranian brass know that. Iran isn't a nuclear capable nation, nor do they even have a single aircraft carrier. America has 10.

I'm not saying Iran won't retailiate, though I am saying Iran won't retailiate conventionally with their own military action. What they'll most likely do is just throw more money towards funding terrorism and terrorist attacks.

canada,fd9ns95,t1_fd82dqq,1578235809.0,"Lazy fat people tend to think that wherever they live is a food desert.

It makes it easier for them to justify why they continue to buy shitty food at the grocery store, because they don't have a choice! How could they possibly be expected to eat healthy when even the grocery store is working against them!

The reality of it is the definition of a food desert is bullshit:

> ""food desert"" describes geographic areas with limited access to healthy food because the distance to the nearest supermarket is in excess of one km.

1 km is nothing, and expecting a person travel more than 1km for errands isn't unreasonable at all. Most people I know ***walk to school from further distances***. If we applied the same logic to other goods and services, I also live in: an educational desert, a gasoline desert, an entertainment desert, a social services desert, a healthcare desert, a government services desert, and a <anything else you can think of> desert because the 1km distance rule is silly."
