exjw,ff35l2c,t3_eraxxt,1579534214.0,"That is what happens when you encourage people not to go to school.   
I don't know how many JW family's I knew that ""Homeschooled"" their kids to avoid ""worldly influences"".  
I personally only had about 3.5 years of public school. I took a GED course at ages 16-17 to catch me up on anything I was behind on before acquiring my GED at 18. The community college the next town over held classes at the public library closest to me (5 miles from our house).  


My mother claimed to homeschool us, but only did so a couple weeks out of the year (AT MOST. I'm being generous). The rest of the time, she expected us to teach ourselves. ""All the books on are the shelves, DON'T BE LAZY!"" I liked to read at least, tho she expected me to be HER personal servant, sometimes taking my Non-JW books away when I was behind on chores.   


So honestly, I am not surprised the watchtowers are beginning to sound like 3rd graders wrote them. That is likely all the non-JW education their writers have these days."
exjw,ff1ehon,t3_er065l,1579478177.0,"I'm an exJW. My mother abused me and my brothers badly. When I left at the age of 22, (left the religion and her control) she tried to have me committed against my will, claiming I was going to hurt myself.   
I haven't spoken to her in 6 years. She stole my email from my step father, or pretended to be him to get it. I reported her for abuse, she found out and still claims she ""did her best"" and ""how dare"" I report her. So no, she doesn't think she has done wrong, its all my ""fault"" for leaving Jehovah and more importantly, her."

She has started emailing me, trying to tell me my grandmother is days/weeks away from dying and she ""asked me a favor"" to at least call/visit. Thankfully I have a Non-JW uncle and cousins. I am in contact with them and they are like ""Your mom is lying/blowing things out of proportion, and you being here isn't going to fix you mom or grandmother's Alzheimers. Oh, also your mother sold off (uncle's) inheritance and changed your grandmother's power of attorney so uncle can no longer make any changes/help with anything. And she did so behind everyone's backs.""  


I am about 120% sure my mom was trying to get me to ""Visit"" so she could make me not leave. When I originally left the JW's at 22, she attempted to have me committed against my will. 0% reason to trust her not to try again.  


Reading this exJW post makes me wonder if she is just trying to get me back to ""make me see the truth before the end"". I have blocked her tho (finally, go me). My uncle keeps me up to date on my grandmother and my mother has made it clear she won't let me contact my youngest brother. So I have/had no reason to even allow her to email me anymore.

I also was kept home and not allowed to go to school. It was mostly just to be mom's servant. But also because she wanted to have 100% control over her kids. I only had 3.5 years of public school. I believe out of the 5 kids, my youngest brother got the least public school. I worry about him as I no longer speak to me mother and he still lives at home with her and step-father(youngest bro's father).My mom was/is extremely abusive in multiple aspects."

And the next thing is get your GED or diploma equivalent. I went through my local community college to get my GED. They had a GED study program to help with anything I was behind on. In most USA states you can get your GED at age 16 and a lot of places offer free GED programs.

Edit add: And also even at 22, I ended up homeless for about 3 months after moving across the country. I did not have a job lined up first, but was so desperate not to go back, I lived in a car with a guy I had started dated, he had been an online friend before I left and had actually helped me feel confidante enough to leave. We started dating once I had moved to the same state as him. I had no one else literally, other than an internet friend whom I dated for ten months after leaving. Looking back, I should have stayed single during that time. But he and I are still friends. He was the first person to (mostly) listen to me.

I don't believe I did everything or anything perfectly to get away, but I was happier homeless than ""at home"" with my mother. 

So 3 things mainly: 
1: study
2: GED
3: Try to have some kind of income lined up before moving. 
4: try to have friends outside the religion to help you get away."

I am the middle child.   


The next youngest brother left about 6 months after I did and now lives with our Bio-father. My brother lived with me for a bit, but was not doing well at the time and wasn't paying his part of the rent, so I had to make him move back with our Bio-father till he got his sh\*t together.

The youngest brother is now 18 and still with lives with mom and step-dad. I hope he is more like step-dad now, but I honestly only have what my cousin and uncle say about him.
