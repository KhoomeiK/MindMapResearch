aww,fdndwlr,t3_em4016,1578583724.0,"WOW okay so I get my wording wasn’t so great in the title but GEEZ I didn’t know it would make people mad at me for owning a home at 23 or really liking the girl I’m dating even though we haven’t been together for 372016 years. I’m getting tired of replying to everyone directly so let me clarify a few things since apparently I need to.

1. This post was to show off my new pup because I think he’s adorable. I said what I said about my house & girlfriend because it shows that I’m at a point in my life to actually be a responsible dog owner. YES I know a dog is a commitment and not a “test” YES i am aware that’s what I said in the title. I’ve already said it, but it was just a joke.

2. I own a home at 23 because I didn’t have another living option. I refuse to pay rent and throw money down the drain for something that will never be mine. I live in Alabama l, so I got a 3 bedroom 2 bath house for less than $130k. I got a USDA loan and was able to roll all of my closing costs & down payment into into my monthly payment so I didn’t pay a single dollar until my first mortgage payment.

3. I’m actually a girl. So mine & my girlfriends decision on if & when we have kids is so unbelievably in our control. It has absolutely nothing to do with this dog. AGAIN my title was just a joke. I’ve wanted a dog my whole life, but because of my living situation up until now I haven’t been able to responsibly own one. 

4. No, I didn’t have help from anybody purchasing this house. (Please refer to point 2 on reasons why I didn’t need a lump sum saved for a down payment) since apparently I need to broadcast my life on reddit to not get eternally roasted, my mother passed when I was 11 & my dad kicked me out at 15 because well see point 3. 

You people are savages. I just wanted people to admire Bruno with me. Anyways, thanks to everyone who gave him compliments and also to those who had kind words :)"
aww,fdms477,t1_fdms2us,1578563041.0,What table?
aww,fdms1kp,t1_fdmdgp2,1578562942.0,"Yeah, I see that now.... I was just trying to show that I’m finally in a position to be a good dog owner... I should’ve reworded it because it’s taken attention away from my sweet boy. This is why I don’t post much on reddit lol sorry for the confusion"
aww,fdmrws2,t1_fdmawyy,1578562754.0,All I’m missing is a horse
aww,fdmrvb3,t1_fdmqd9w,1578562699.0,I’ll gladly share all my sammiches :)
aww,fdmru0k,t1_fdmde1t,1578562650.0,"Oh he’s absolutely my dog. I had a kind of a rough upbringing and have some attachment issues due to that, and I have already bonded with him so much that I can’t imagine a day without him!"
aww,fdmrrf7,t1_fdmdumk,1578562549.0,"Thanks for that, I didn’t know that. He does have a small white blotch on his chest and one that is visible in the picture on his chin! His face seems to have a little pit in it to me, and his paws don’t seem big enough for me to believe he’s going to be as large as a pure bred lab. I’ll love the shit out of my little mutt regardless though"
aww,fdmrnqi,t1_fdme62c,1578562405.0,Thank you! Love the username ;)
aww,fdmrn6a,t1_fdmfab3,1578562383.0,"Hey, thanks! I appreciate that :)"
aww,fdmrmh7,t1_fdmgooy,1578562355.0,Don’t tell me that!!! My sweet baby angel puppers would never chew anything would he?!
aww,fdmrlor,t1_fdmgpte,1578562324.0,Damn.... you mean to tell me I can’t just give a baby a rawhide and it’ll quit crying??? Geez.. life is confusing
aww,fdmrjws,t1_fdmk7nc,1578562255.0,"Thanks :) I’m blown away by his intelligence already! Apart from his first 3ish days, he’s only had a handful of accidents and those have been right beside the back door so I know he’s learning!"
aww,fdmrigh,t1_fdmlae6,1578562197.0,"So far, he’s surprisingly been really great about not chewing furniture. Almost too great... I have a feeling I’m going to come home to a demolished couch here soon though...."
aww,fdmrh1s,t1_fdmpof2,1578562144.0,"I mean if you must know we’ve only been dating for 7 months, yes. But, I’ve known her & her family since I was in elementary school. The post was about how cute I think my puppy is, mentioning the house and the girlfriend was just to show that I’m finally in a position to be a responsible dog owner. I work a lot of hours a week & she’s a server so she has much more free time to tend to & care for a puppy. I just didn’t think I would need to explain all of that in the title. 

Thank you for your concern :)"
aww,fdmap3e,t1_fdma1mn,1578544086.0,"Lol, not even a little bit. Mom passed away & don’t speak to my father. Not trying to boast but I’ve done it all on my own."
aww,fdmaixo,t1_fdm80jd,1578543953.0,Shoutout to Walmart!
aww,fdmai8q,t1_fdm848x,1578543938.0,Thanks! I will :)
aww,fdmahg1,t1_fdm8rw9,1578543920.0,we know :) we’ve talked about it for a while!
aww,fdmacz4,t1_fdm9xtt,1578543824.0,"Lol, that was more so a joke. We’ve both wanted a puppy for a while. Thank you!"
aww,fdm6q36,t1_fdm6ljf,1578541149.0,"I’m sure he’s mixed. The people I got him from claimed he was pure, but I highly doubt it. Thank you so much :)"
HumansBeingBros,fdfwal6,t1_fdfrsm9,1578371938.0,Chillin lol
holdmyjuicebox,fbu3559,t3_ee77hi,1577106590.0,I love that he’s smiling at the kid like “oh he’s having so much fun”
