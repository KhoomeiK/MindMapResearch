EarthPorn,ffdx736,t1_ffdupf9,1579831157.0,Thank you! I will definitely remember and tell my girlfriend that. I love Alberta and British Columbia. Thank you again
EarthPorn,ffdugq7,t3_et1d57,1579829218.0,Where abouts in Alberta is this? My girlfriend and I are thinking of going out west again next year. Ontario is a little boring if you're in the south western part
EarthPorn,fe6h3cy,t1_fe63u6s,1578890701.0,I wish I lived there and not southern Ontario where the only lights you see are from Toronto
offmychest,fe5scv0,t1_fe5rlro,1578873890.0,Yes it is! Lol. Women are just like men and they sleep with just as much men as men sleep with women. Don't be a fool and think women are different than men in today's society. Your comment is not relevant to the post. He's not talking about how many men he's slept with. He's talking about how men no matter their physical appearances are beautiful.
offmychest,fe5qbkw,t1_fe5q4zf,1578873072.0,You're the one being stupid and dishonest. So if a woman and said the exact same thing would it be that she wanted to have sex with every man she sees?
offmychest,fe5popf,t1_fe5ofq0,1578872706.0,That has nothing to do with the post. He's saying how every man is beautiful. He's not saying he wants to have sex with all of them
offmychest,fe5msqw,t1_fe4z9db,1578871495.0,How is this relevant to the post? I'm just curious that's all
offmychest,fe4em7o,t1_fe49lv9,1578858438.0,I'm a male and I have been followed quite a few times. It's a scary experience and I hate hearing females go through this. I wish people weren't so creepy
pagan,fe43dkp,t1_fe3khea,1578855402.0,Oh really? I'm seriously going to look into him! Thank you!
offmychest,fe352v1,t1_fe1qqo0,1578846016.0,I am sorry if I came across as an asshole. It wasn't my intention. I just thought that you need to phone the police before you go into the station is odd that's all. I am sorry again
pagan,fe34vkw,t1_fe3061k,1578845931.0,I will look into the group! I really appreciate it everything you guys have done for me! I think that's why Europe needs to go back to the old ways. Religion causes a lot of stuff but I feel paganism brings everyone together
offmychest,fe2d0lk,t1_fe1qqo0,1578837027.0,In my city in Canada you can just walk right through the doors of the police. A fire station or even a hospital is a good place to go too
pagan,fe06r6l,t1_fe06hpc,1578804500.0,I can completely understand that. I will look into that forum. I'm a Serb and I know a lot of Serbs don't like pagans. It's sad to say that we have lost our old ways.  I have just recently discovered we were pagans last year. It seems like we have same God's and goddesses as the Norse and Greeks
pagan,fe063gi,t1_fe061hv,1578803989.0,Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!!
offmychest,fdgim6c,t3_ekwobo,1578398340.0,My girlfriend went through something similar before meeting me. She was on hot or not and went on a date with this guy. She had her first kiss with the guy and then her friends found out he was dating someone. This guy wanted to use my girlfriend as a side chick. If only I could find out who he was and tell him that he missed out on a fantastic woman!
offmychest,fczq33f,t1_fczp0ik,1578106621.0,Awe I'm sorry! Trust me he's not eating chicken with bones and he's eating all of his favourite foods too
offmychest,fcyrtds,t1_fcxuf4j,1578085727.0,I have a feeling Nicky is definitely and he's probably eating all the chicken he can get his paws on!! Stay strong I know it's easier said than done but you can always pm if you need to talk to someone!!
offmychest,fcxsuck,t3_ej7uhm,1578070010.0,I am so sorry for your loss! I have a dog but I won't fully understand what you're going through until I go through it. Just remember he's attacking snowpeople with your father
offmychest,fcx83dr,t1_fcx1325,1578054992.0,"I was bullied all through elementary and high school. I had bruises on both arms and my brother had to walk home with me because one of my bullies was my ""friend"" and knew where I lived. I would be like OP if one of my bullies died and even to do to this I wouldn't bat an eye if they got sick"
offmychest,fcx5yb6,t1_fcwx9cn,1578052608.0,OP said that he didn't deserve it but he definitely needed to acknowledge what he did. I've been bullied and if my bullies had cancer I would do the exact same thing as what OP did
offmychest,fcotiz6,t1_fcot00p,1577841144.0,I'm going to try that! Thank you so much!!!
