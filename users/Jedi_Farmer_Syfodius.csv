Second, a lot of the military is “small people” at heart and would likely side with the people if it came to this. This may actually give the people access to some of the weapons and tools as well. I find it hard to believe the military would openly fight its own citizens. That’s not what a lot of those people signed up for, myself included when I served.

At that level I expect to make and see mistakes. Yet, I run into sub 1000 players that make no mistakes and often move within seconds of me moving. 

Just last night. I had a game where the guy played perfectly at first, had a sizable lead (1 piece, 2 pawns and better development), then just started making horrible decisions. I was able to overcome the deficit, and all of a sudden he started playing some of the best endgame I’ve seen, but he didn’t have the material to beat my advantage and he resigned after I captured his last piece and still had a rook. I think he used an engine to get a lead and then tried to win on his own, only to turn it on again when I took the lead. I can’t verify any of this, so take it for what it’s worth. 

I get why people do it, and yet, I don’t get it. They have to feel so bad for losing a lot, they just want to know what winning feels like, but, at the same time, they’re not winning, so it has to feel hollow, right?"

All the big manufacturers have monopolies on their own equipment’s repair. It’s bs. Right now, it feels like we pay $150k just to rent the machine, but we also have to cover maintenance.

Edit: Many are commenting this isn’t just plaguing farmers, and they’re correct. It’s in everything. A couple years ago, Nebraska was going to vote on passing a Right to Repair bill here to combat the farm equipment issue. Nobody realized it was as big a deal as it is until Apple showed up in Lincoln to lobby against it and basically threatened to not sell any Apple products in Nebraska if it passed. I think they put the bill on hold because of that. I know we want to do it, but we probably need more national support as well. That’s why I’m asking anyone and everyone to spread the word."

My wife hired a lady right out of college trying to get her business going to do our engagement photos. She took us to a botanical garden in LA and didn’t tell us you need permits or such for this, as she was also trying to save us money. It was great. We got some good photos, but finally had to close up shop when an attendant came over and told us to stop since we couldn’t produce the permit papers. She tried to play it off like we were related and the pics were just for fun. My wife is half Korean, the photographer was of Asian descent as well. The attendant definitely debated for about 5 seconds if they had made a huge mistake before we said we’d stop anyway and left. It was pretty obvious what we were doing. The photographer had her bf assistant carrying around a lot of professional equipment, and my wife and I were pretty dressed up. We would have paid for the permit if we had known.
