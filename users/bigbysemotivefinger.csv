This is a point that really cannot be re-stated enough. Dr. Robert Epstein, in his book ""The Case Against Adolescence,"" writes about a study he conducted wherein he showed that people under the age of 18 face more interference in their everyday lives *just for being young* than do active-duty Marines or death-row convicts.

Doppel-noble went to a meeting with the high nobility. Sat next to the head of state. Took copious notes about everything from upcoming rank appointments to military disposition to the status of diplomacy with other kingdoms. Left. Immediately turned over her notes to the demon king.

She was out there for five hours and never got caught.

And the best part? It's not like she was just playing her character. She purposely got little details wrong. Afterward we found out lots of people had noticed *some* of what she did, but nobody communicated about it and nobody put enough of the off details together to realize what was actually going on.

The paranoia it caused when people realized what had happened lasted for *months*. Heightened security. Blood proof for nobles' meetings. You name it."

litrpg,fdb01fh,t1_fdawx6b,1578252244.0,"Maybe, but at the same time, a lot of these settings where that is the official explanation also have magic as a limited resource. Either difficult to learn, or quick to run out of, or *both at once*.

Take literally any world that is running on D&D rules (that doesn't go full Tippyverse). A *good* Wizard gets, what, maybe 6 *fireball* spells in a day, assuming that's all he does with his third-level slots? Or pays 11,250gp for a 50-shot Wand of it (225gp a shot)? That's... some pretty serious limits, or some pretty serious expense. Again, assuming it's a world that runs how most of them are written, where nobody is exploiting the obvious quirks.

Compare that to what gunpowder can do, even in the form of muskets. In *anyone's* hands. You don't have to study for years to make it work, and even if you're a terrible marksman, you have cheap bullets by the barrel-full that any schmuck with two hands and a campfire can make. And you sure as heck can carry more than half-a-dozen grenades *per guy*.

And that's just in terms of warfare. Think about transportation. Sure *teleport* might be cool; it's also a 5th-level spell that costs a relative fortune to get someone to cast for you. You could buy a fleet of wagons and pay their drivers for *years* for the same price. And then (or perhaps ""and thus"") railroads become a thing...

I'm not saying these things would be true in every setting. Obviously every system has its quirks, and a world running on *He Who Fights With Monsters* logic is going to have different needs than one running on D&D logic, because *of course* they are. But I am saying that I think that particular explanation either requires the world to work a certain way - a way that most settings that rely on that explanation simply *don't* - or just plain doesn't hold up under close scrutiny, because it doesn't solve problems that people would still have a need for that magic can't keep up with."

Part of it is how I am as a gamer, too. My favorite tabletop rpg is Mage: the Ascension, specifically because magic can do just about anything you can imagine, and it rewards being creative with it. It really makes me feel like I know Magic, capital M, rather than a handful of prepackaged tricks.
