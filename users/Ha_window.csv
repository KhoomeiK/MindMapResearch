1: a1, b1, c1, (d0), (e0)

2: (a1), b2, c2, d1, (e0)

3: (a1), (b2), c3, d2, e1

4: a2, (b2), (c3), d3, e2

5: a3, b3, (c3), (d3), e3

So 3 wins (w) is 5 games (g) is one rotation (r).

Now you understand that for every 5 games, you can make every player gain 3 wins. The last number with a factor of divisible by 3 before 50 is 48. We need 16 rotations to get there, or 80 games. 

Now:

80: a48, b48, c48, d48, e48

politics,fdzuc2q,t1_fdzsl4a,1578795984.0,"From the article I linked in reference to the 2 billion dollars Japan provides the US for troops stationed there. “The payments, which began in 1978 and are considered a pillar of the post-war U.S.-Japanese alliance, cover about a third or more of the cost of keeping 49,000 U.S. troops in Japan.“

My position was that the US won’t be profiting from US troops in Saudi’s Arabia. However I will concede that there are only 3000 troops there currently, and the US would likely make returns on that number. However from my interpretation of his words, I’d say he was planning on increasing that number (and I also highly doubt SA has already paid the US 1 billion dollars). He also cited SK paying the US 500 million for troops, which is likely true because there’s around 23 thousand stationed there. 

I’d also like to add that the US was actively increasing the number of troops in November in SA, and troops in SA will likely face more danger and be more costly to support than in the SK. I will admit, that if the number of troops stay below 10,000 and the US is given 1 billion per year, using my completely uninformed guestimation, the US could likely make a profit from troops in SA.

politics,fdzrvlg,t1_fdyyj81,1578794342.0,"Sorry, but I’m hijacking your comment for visibility because something seemed wrong with the article. Basically, I was under the impression this was actually a pretty common place practice, and was surprised with no one adding in that context in the comment section. I found a really pertinent article from 2016.

www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-allies-20160930-snap-story.html%3F_amp%3Dtrue

Essentially, one of Trumps gripes from back then was that the US wasn’t being paid for military support. This isn’t a new strategy, and unfortunately the rolling stone article doesn’t go into how he plans to use these troops. 

Interestingly the 2016 article notes that Trump believed foreign countries didn’t reimburse the US for its military support, which was false. If you look at his words from a political perspective, Trump is trying to take credit for an existing policy to frame him as a deal maker. It’s still bullshit, far less infuriating bull shit.

The real analysis is for how he plans to use these troops and this policy. The 2016 article pointed out that 2 billion dollars paid for about 1/3 to half of US troops. I don’t know how many troops are in the Saudi Arabia or Japan, but it doesn’t sound the US typically makes a return on sending soldiers overseas. So again, not mercenaries, just a bumbling idiot trying to take credit for essentially doing nothing. Now, will Trump use this irresponsibly? I feel like I’m not the one to answer this question, but I’m leaning that the US won’t be making a profit of US soldiers any time soon.

The cloud on the top right of the left hand painting looks odd, but it might be the angle. You could clean it up or add a new cloud to cover it.

I always say happy holidays at work because I know someone could take offense to it. I’ve texted one friend Merry Christmas, and they texted back happy holidays. She felt a little annoyed, but I wasn’t sure because it was through text. Generally speaking, the more liberal, PC a person is, the more likely they take offense to Merry Christmas. Definitely would not take offense to someone saying Happy Hanukkah to me, so I really don’t get it."

My roomate showed me a super easy dish, and I usually make when I get home from work. I bring a pot of water to boil, throw about half a box of spaghetti in and 4 eggs in, and boil for 10 minutes. Throw some spaghetti sauce on that, or just butter, or olive oil or soy sauce and you have a really easy meal with some protein to keep you going. I usually only eat once or twice a day so this is perfect for me. 

Cleaning up is easier when you do it with others, but that doesn’t always apply to every aspie : )."

chess,fc19h6j,t1_fc0a3v0,1577312103.0,I feel like OP is doing the same thing as me when I over emphasize rating. I see an opponent who has a lower rating as weak and “tilt”. I don’t pay attention or respect them. However I tend to play my best chess against players who are 100-200 points higher than me because I have nothing to loose. Basically just play the game and don’t worry about your opponent’s skill.
