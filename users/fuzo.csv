I am still trying to figure out what VH I want to focus on, and I am thinking of Zane but I have seen posts saying that he runs out of ammo often


Of course this happens at lot in the early game, but is this still an issue at endgame?


Are there many situations where you will have to fight for a long time without the chance to refill ammo?

If this is still an issue at endgame I am more likely to focus on Moze, as I hate feeling restricted on what guns I can use by their ammo consumption"

MMORPG,fedav53,t1_fe9oz9m,1579006053.0,"I enjoy OSRS but here are some of my cons- 

1. Really slow paced game. This is fine most of the time, but sometimes I want some fast paced, exciting combat or activity and nothing in OSRS can really deliver this, so you would have to play something else to do this

2. Reliance on third party software on PC. There is a client called Runelite which just adds an insane amount of features and functionality. You don't HAVE to use it, but if you don't you are at a huge disadvantage. I really dislike being so reliant on a third party client. 

3. Game has very limited potential. The game is built upon a tick system, with tile based movement. Boss fights are kind of limited to ""hit this mob, activate this prayer ability, wear this gear, stand on this tile"". Yes some bosses are difficult, but only because they are very punishing if you get any of these things wrong. And due to how the game is built, encounters can't really go any further than this. 

4. Awful community in my opinion. Yes every community has some nice and some horrible players. OSRS certainly seems to have a higher % of horrible people. Luckily most of the game is done solo so interacting with others isn't too important. 


5. Graphics are a pro and a con....yeah the art style is iconic. But it certainly limits immersion in the game imo. I walked around some locations in Runescape 3 with their updated graphics and couldn't help thinking ""wow, so thats what this place is actually supposed to look like"".


6. Kind of a combination of many of the above points; its just not that engaging most of the time. I would say the majority of time is spent doing activities that don't require much attention. That means most players play while watching videos or doing something else on the side. That can be a pro I guess, but sometimes I want a game that commands my full attention and OSRS rarely provides that."

UKPersonalFinance,fed6kml,t3_eojy4e,1579001324.0,"You don't need to declare it all in this tax year. 

In essence what you need to know is the difference between cash and accrual accounting. 

Cash accounting is just counting stuff in the period that money was received or spent. Many self employed people do this because it is much simpler.

But you can use accrual accounting. This is accounting for stuff when the income was actually earned, or when costs were incurred, rather than when money changes hands. 

So you are fine to use accrual accounting- i.e. declare your income in the years where you actually carried out the work. If you treat your income this way you should also be consistent and treat your costs that way too (although I assume you will have minimal costs so this won't matter too much)"
