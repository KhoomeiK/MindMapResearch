Poop. Sleep. Get a fishing pole toy and have hubby play with kitty for 20 min, then feed him. Kitty needs to relearn his associations with hubby.  Give it a week or so of play..food..poop..sleep and he will come around."

entitledparents,ffduccm,t1_ffdtaqx,1579829133.0,Diana  was  born into the very minor mobility to the Viscount Spencer. It was only after he inherited the title of Earl that she became Lady Dianna. Sarah's father was a Major in the British military. Her family can be traced back to one of Charles II illegitimate children. No title.  Kate's family is middle time upper class -  no aristocracy. Her Dad was a flight dispatcher and her Mum made the family money through her highly successful party planning company. Like you said it's easy to look up

entitledparents,ffdrn5o,t1_ffdhjtf,1579827238.0,"Before walking away, Harry was so far down the list he would never be king. It made things that much easier in releasing them from their titles."
entitledparents,ffdren6,t1_ffdh3s5,1579827079.0,"Dianna was a commoner and was hand picked by the Queen for Charles when she was 8 yrs old at a garden party. Fergie was common. Kate was common. Several more  people who have married into the extended family have been commoners. It has zero to do with her lack of a title and everything to do with her race. The poor girl couldn't sneeze in England without some snide racial comment! She and Harry were followed EVERYWHERE! This move has been in their minds for over a year but I think what cemented it for them was their holiday here in Canada over Christmas. They were able to walk down the street, shop in stores, hike in the mountains and NOBODY bothered them! They were actually hiking in BC and came upon a couple trying to take a selfie. Meghan offered to help and take a pic for them.. it wasnt until she was done that the couple even realized who they were!  Even then they didn't fawn over them, or demand a photo. They responded in true Canadian fashion with a warm smile, a wish for a happy holiday and everyone went on their way!  NO paparazzi. NO pics leaked to papers. NO screaming articles. They got to be normal!"
entitledparents,ffdqeci,t3_et0ky6,1579826441.0,"His other daughter is just as bad. When Meghan married Harry she went off her nut with jealousy. Calling Meghan a spoiled princess to reporters, making up crap stories.  There is a reason she only invited her Mum to the wedding and a very real reason they chose Canada as their new home instead of the US."

My favourite part was the art development and writing codes for banners that allowed members to interact with aspects of the various locales they were in. One Christmas, I had spent the better part of a week creating an interactive art installation with a complex banner code that animated the scene.  My boss, bless her, she was a total sweetheart and beyond brilliant  ..saw a way to tweak my code to improve it. No worries. Except she added a space where it wasn't needed, this caused the in progress build area to kick everyone offline in 3 seconds as soon as they entered. She messaged me  more than a bit frazzled, my immediate supervisor was screaming laughing and Boss was all..its broken ..3 seconds..  CANT FIX IT! After I figured out what she meant I joined supervisor in howling . Poor Boss had to repeatedly log back on..3 seconds grab code. Study it..log back on 3 seconds.. implement fix..failed..repeat ...for ....hours. until she found that one tiny space at the beginning of one line! Lmao. She was all I need coffee NOW!"

ProRevenge,ffd0hmw,t3_esxzrp,1579811004.0,"Ally is a Gran to be proud of ! A while back I posted a story about my Nan. She too lived on a farm with her family. When she was 16, she was really tiny and delicate and being farm raised , as innocent as the dawn (so the saying goes). That summer they got a new farmhand who quickly zeroed in on Nan. Constantly watching her as she went around doing her chores. One day her family went to town leaving her at home alone - with the farmhand. As soon as they  were out of sight, he made his move and chased her al over the farm yard. Eventually he had her pinned up up against the split rail fence her Dad was building . Nan managed to pick up one of the 10 ft posts and swung it around and hit him in the head dropping him like a rock! Till the day she died Nan said God gave her the strength to lift the pole"

A is most urgent - head injuries, heart or breathing, extreme pain.
