One of the main goals of IM Fasting is weight loss so if you're underweight or average weight make sure to eat enough.  You will eventually adjust and be used to eating in the time frame or for the one meal.  Breasts aren't only fat deposits, however fat does help.  After a few months (6-12) of fasting and your HRT, stop the IM fasting and increase your caloric intake.  Since your body will be used to the fasting, you'll put on weight.  Just make sure to stay fit and healthy when you do!"

coins,fdvb2h4,t1_fdv0c3j,1578745481.0,"It can be done on purpose and has been shown by NurdRage over on YouTube.  In natural cases it's with layers of the metal oxidizing or in the case with silver sometimes, reacting with sulfur compounds in the air.  The synthetic process replicates this by putting the coin into a solution and then passing electricity through the solution.  This allows parts of the metal to form new compounds with (in this case) silver that gives it the toned look.  It's an extremely interesting process but it's heavily frowned on by the coin community.  

I'm another interesting side note, toning like this can be occured through heat in metals.  Steel is a good example as it can become a very beautiful blue color.  In clock making, steel parts are heated in brass shavings to give a consistent heat across the metal pieces, and raised to a specific temperature that gives the whole piece of steel the blue color.  More common forms of coloring metals is using titanium and running it through a charged solution to achieve a desired color.  Extremely interesting stuff!"
CRH,fdpfiyx,t3_eml5a7,1578627299.0,"Holy cow what luck!  Just came from your other post.  Look up ""Nickel Mintages"" on Google, I believe there is a Wikipedia and another website that gives the Mintages of the nickels by year and mint.  I usually keep stuff if it's below 10 million, and if it's a buffalo/war/v nickel.
