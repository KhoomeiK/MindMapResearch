Maybe I'm just cynical and a pessimist, but I'm not as all-in on this hire as many of our fans. It's a splashy hire for certain, but I'm not sure it was right for us. It's the first time we've ever (that I know of) hired a sitting D1 head coach away from another school, so that was big, but I'm not sure it was the right sitting coach. I think our AD was feeling the heat, and knew he had to do something big. 

As far as the off-field issues, they were real. Players talking back and cussing coaches with no consequences. Players not bothering to go to practice, with no punishment. And then there was the fight that got our QB knocked out of the bowl game. Our S&C program was also a joke.

Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin."
