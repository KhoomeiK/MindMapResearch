NEET,fcj85wp,t3_eh7bsp,1577679700.0,"Personlly for me, its a mix between the 2.. in very unstable mentally and emotionally. Some days i feel like i can go out and do everything i need to do but when i wake up the next day the overwhelming social anxiety and 0 energy is back there again tapping your back. I fear inmensly the future and time burns painfully harder as it goes by. Im afraid i will become a victim of a self fulfilling prophecy..

If i would have no mental issues and all the energy normal people had i would have no issues with working"
