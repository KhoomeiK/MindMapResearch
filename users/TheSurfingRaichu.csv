nottheonion,feccv1p,t1_feccmte,1578970948.0,"Why rape some scrub you're just trying to make a quick buck off of? Again, all y'alls accusations are based off little more than the fact that you have a collective hate boner for Cardi. Lol get a life..."

nottheonion,fecbinx,t1_fecb3vq,1578970170.0,"I'm referring to all of these freaks online who INSIST she raped men despite there being nothing to prove or even suggest that. She admitted to what she did, she drugged and robbed men to make money."

You do you, but seriously. Ew."

Glad to see other animal-conscious people out there speaking up on their behalf."
aww,fdqlrxx,t1_fdqlhnw,1578669708.0,"You talk like vegans have direct control over the actions of others. We don't. We also all have different values. For me, the killing of animals is less important than the pain they suffer throughout their entire lives under our current system. If animals are going to die, I personally wish for them not to have to suffer their entire lives before slaughter. Others are against killing altogether. But your calling my beliefs a ""cop out"" is simply wrong. We just have a difference of opinion."
aww,fdqk05e,t1_fdqjh4t,1578668529.0,People are going to eat meat whether we like it or not. Reducing their intake is a positive step. Seeking to create a system where animals suffer less (and there is less negative impact to our environment as well) is not just something to shrug off as you are doing.

aww,fdpa58t,t1_fdnw9wj,1578623569.0,"I agree that we need to end factory farming and cruel practices but it is a myth that we have to eat meat. Been vegan for a few years now and I'm healthier than ever. Takes dedication, though. I'm just happy to see more and more people reducing their meat intake these days. That alone helps a lot."
worldnews,fdp1o55,t1_fdp15bb,1578617880.0,"Hardly. There isn't a country in the world that doesn't recognize our massive military strength, a power which is used quite often to kill innocent civilians (yes, even during the Obama years). This merely fosters hatred toward us from millions and millions of people. Those people then go on to commit acts of violence/terror to more innocent people. And so the cycle continues. Enough is enough. Your arrogant ways are not working. We only reach peace through diplomacy. The more we try to take over, the worse things will become. History has taught us that time and time again. The American empire, too, will fall, unless we begin to change our ways. That begins by changing our outlook. Thankfully your war-hungry ideology is, as you said, unpopular, and the people will bring about this much needed change. Trump and the old guard are on their way out. To that, millions around the world rejoice, ""good riddance""! ...But it won't stop with the end of Trump. We must continue to fight against the corruption you support, and never give up that fight. To those peace-seekers reading this, we are many in number. Have no fear. Change is upon us."
worldnews,fdp0gvn,t1_fdp08te,1578617076.0,"Imperialism is an evil which we shouldn't just shrug off. And no, other countries shouldn't just ""fall in line"" with our evil. America must act as leaders in peace, not aggression. Such arrogance and the deaths that ensue as a result are a direct cause of terrorism worldwide. What you propose actually encourages more terrorism, I hope you realize this..."
worldnews,fdozasl,t1_fdoyy8z,1578616301.0,"That's an immature and unrealistic way of looking at it, especially when our eyes are on their oil and they have strong allies in major nations (Russia and China). If we continue to act brash and with imperialistic intentions, we will only escalate tensions, set the stage for more violence, and cause the deaths of more innocent people (directly and indirectly)."
worldnews,fdoy7et,t1_fdoxugw,1578615588.0,"I'm not going to play along, but I will say this: while the attack was abominable, America is hardly guilt-free when it comes to relations with Iran, and we should not try to escalate this further. What happened was not okay but neither was the assassination, nor were previous attacks of violence from either side. Again, let us seek peace."
worldnews,fdoxgyl,t1_fdowze0,1578615110.0,That and more. Peace should always be sought. So should the approval of Congress. America's current president is reckless and hardly diplomatic. This kind of behavior will only escalate to further violence and the deaths of innocents.
