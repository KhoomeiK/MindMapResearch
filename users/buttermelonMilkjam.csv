my dr warned me against all forms of activity that would increase the heartrate bc it can potentially lead to too much bleeding, post surgery trauma. so if you go slow (& maybe utilize doggy style) you should be okay, but like, dont go crazy. its less about the movement and more about the blood pressure getting too high.
