So I found a way. I used that metal part from an empty shell. It works and gets the job done until I get a real magazine follower!"
TheMindIlluminated,ff1xsd9,t1_fezmjs3,1579488617.0,"I dont agree. For some of us no matter what we do there are negative thoughts. We are never good enough. 
And its actually possible to be one of the best in something and still think its not enough. Take  Schwarzenegger, he had a perfect body yet many times he admitted that he hated his body. Mind doesnt work the way you described, it doesnt think positively just because you are giving your best. Or if you are good at what you do.
You can change the way you think with positive thoughts. I find my life to be much more peaceful and enjoyable if there are positive thoughts rather than negative ones ( and honestly I find myself identifying with either one of those no matter what)"

dpdr,feef2us,t3_eogbr1,1579032444.0,"Yes I experience this. I think it's some form of anxiety where your body is always in a state of scanning for danger. I never really experience being safe to a point where I'm simply spontaneous and just doing things, I always over-analyze everything. For every thought there is another one which contradicts it. And I feel so aware. Like, I hear, see, smell, and I'm not immersed in such experience, I dont hear/see/smell but I'm simply aware of such doing. So instead there's an experience but it feels soo far away, like I have no connection with it and I'm simply being aware of it. Being nothing. It feels weird."

When it happens I also kind of forget what things are like I'm hearing some sound which I hear everyday and my mind is familiar with, but in that moment my mind just doesn't recognize it as something familiar. Same for vision. It's really scary and only happens when dissociation for me is really intense. When in such state I also usually find myself staring at some dot on the wall."

When I got used to that I decided to go a bit further, went maybe 100 metres away from my house, I could feel the anxiety and my mind trying to convince me that Im in danger but did that a few more times and I was used to it.

No need to end your life. I mean you'll die anyways. See where this leads you, okay? 

For example I also lost my job 2 months ago, I thought that they would offer me a new contract but they didn't. Felt so bad. Had it all figured out. But then I went through some kind of drug induced psychosis where I needed to move back to my parents because I couldn't handle living alone anymore.  
If they gave me a new contract I would need to quit the job. This way they are offering me a new contract where I will begin to work on the 1st of March, which by then I should be okay with living alone and moving to city again.  
So, you see, it worked out great. Im lucky that they didn't offer me a new contract 2 months ago!

SuicideWatch,fdz9zjy,t3_enczik,1578788114.0,"I'm of a belief that no matter what we do, even if we spend our whole life doing absolutely nothing, our lives are still worth it. We are enough simply because we exist. You are not a tool which gets thrown away if it doesn't meet certain criteria, you are a human being. No matter if you have 1$ or 1M$, you are still a human being. And you are beautiful, just the way you are. Unique. 

Judging people by the amount of money they make is an illusion. It doesnt mean anything. It's just what we as a society do but it's absurd. Think about it. What if I judged people by how tall they were? Where if I would see taller people as people of greater value, and shorter people as people of lesser value. That's absurd, right? Well how different it is judging people by how much money they make? There's no difference. It's an illusionary scale that we humans use, and the only reason it feels normal and right is because we've been taught to act such way from young age. 

You can't change they way your family thinks. But if you see trough it, if you realize the stupidity behind such way of thinking, you'll simply see your parents as victims of brainwashing..and you'll stop feeling less of a men just because someone thinks you are such way.

CPTSD,fdyxol3,t3_en6cwn,1578784624.0,"Its as if I myself have written this. I also have no big traumatic events in my life at all, but I have always felt this great deal of sadness which never left me, 24 now, which I never really shared with my parents, or anyone in real life. I couldn't share it with my parents, they wouldn't understand. I don't blame them, it feels like they did their best...but sometimes *giving your best* is just not enough. And it was not my fault that I needed more. That I needed someone who would understand. Who would be there for me.

I've accumulated many bad habits since I've tried to escape from how I felt. I managed to rid most of those, and now I feel like I'm right back where I was. I'm still that scared kid who is just so confused. So lonely. So sad. I feel like it's me against the world."

Psychonaut,fdnr26i,t1_fdmvv5q,1578591178.0,"Well abusing LSD doesn't guarantee that you will have a psychotic trip. Just as non-abuse (using safe) doesn't guarantee that you won't have one.  
When you are psychotic you dont really see it as ""bad"", rather you experience yourself being very special. Life gets a whole new level of meaning. When it wears off you start seeing just how screwed you are due to it. And the first time it happens, its just impossible to see it because who expects his mind to go psycho? Nowdays when Im delusional Im aware of it to some degree due to having experience with it, but first time - you just end up believing every single delusion you experience. 

And as I said I got into spirituality and was looking at it all trough such lens, I hoped to heal myself with further use - yes it might sound stupid but the thing is that again, acid is really powerful, and you can actually kind of decieve yourself that you are healing when you are actually destroying your psyche."

Listen to my story. For 2 years I thought that DPDR was actually spiritual awakening and I spent that time doing LSD trying to amplify DPDR feeling. How dumb is that lol? I actually thought this was a good thing!  
Now, my DPDR is so severe that I have psychotic symptoms along it. I moved back with my family because its impossible to live on my own. I cant sleep at night at all by myself due to irrational fears. And overall my life is simply a mess.  
But you know what? I dont care man. Im done with self pity. Im okay. Im grateful. I will recover. I find joy in little things like excercise. Healthy food. Stuff like cold showers, no fap. Taking care of my body. It might sound stupid but thats my passion, Im kind of trying to be the best version of myself. I cant always control what life throws at me but I can control my reaction, and as such I simply want to give my best. My life is soo shitty, you wouldnt believe it, but I honestly dont care anymore. Im going to do my best, thats all I can at the end.  
Why am I sharing this? Because I hope that I can motivate you, because if you decide to accept your state and simply do your best no matter what, a lot of pain will simply go away. At least it was like that for me. I really believe in you. Imagine how mentally strong will you be if you overcome this. Try to see it as a gift. I know you are angry that its happening to you, and that you cant be normal..but fuck, its how it is. Embrace it.

I dont know how to handle this. I find great relief knowing that no matter what someday I'm going to die and all of the pain I feel will be gone."
SuicideWatch,fc8qsi0,t3_egq96h,1577540312.0,"I cant imagine what its like. But a couple more years and you can get the hell out of there. I advise keeping it low and not doing anything to upset your parents, they sound crazy. 

Can you bear it all for a couple more years? I promise it will get better. Then when you are old enough to be independent, get out of there and never look back.

Best of luck, if you need someone to talk to you can DM me."
dpdr,fc62voy,t1_fc5humq,1577471033.0,"I also experienced DPDR before but this time it's quite serious and some days I struggle to just stay alive. Its intense and I cant do it on my own, Im staying with my family since that trip since I simply can't live by just myself. 

Do you think you would have recover if not for the  ADs? Do you think that just time can heal this? Because I want to try going the sober way, treating my body well with excercise, healthy food and let time heal this."
BecomingTheIceman,fc2jhqy,t3_efo9g6,1577363461.0,"I've done some breathing techniques while on LSD. Results are more or less the same but you experience them on a more intense level.

I've also experienced many intense emotions that made me cry, it felt as if I entered my emotional state due to heavy breathing. I also experienced panick attacks, fear. Terror.

I don't find it safe and would not recommend."
