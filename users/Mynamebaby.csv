Utah only allows use of the firing squad for people sentenced before 2006. Only 2 states allow new cases to sentence death by firing squad. 

Anyway, you still haven't gotten the point, which is that no method of execution is cheaper than incarceration. In fact it's rather astonishing how you continue to miss the point and continue to make yourself look like an ever bigger fool.

You even quoted the point yet STILL missed it ""I am talking of the cost not the method"".

Then when faced with facts you dismiss them, which is not just ignorance, it's stupidity.  As is your disliking my use of the term murder, which is ridiculous.

UnresolvedMysteries,fe3djot,t1_fe26llu,1578848339.0,"Because girls and women with unwanted pregnancies are often terrified and under tremendous physical and psychological pressure. It's likely that most gave birth on their own, which is very painful and dangerous. The pregnancies may be the result of psychological and physical abuse and/or rape, including incest. 

Since you can't figure any of this out on your own it's clear you haven't been in an abusive relationship and you lack empathy."

Several podcasts are tacky as well. The host of Sword and Scale is a fucking psycho. I loathe My Favorite Murder. Even the title of the podcast is gross and the hosts sound like a couple of disrespectful tactless airheads who don't do their research. 

I like the podcast Casefile because it's well researched and respectful, and that's the only crime show I listen to, although I skip quite a few of those episodes because I can't stomach them and they're too depressing."
