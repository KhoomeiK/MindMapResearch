I will gladly buy those good games, but Bethesda gotta make a good game now first. Then I will buy the second good game. 

People acting here like they are not pirating, to preserve their internet points.. You know who you are!"

Two of those were shit so that's 120 wasted.

But, they have been detained and now face charges. And if sentenced they could get the maximum punishment of 37 years! I feel like rehabilitation and close mental care would be much more beneficial then for them to get locked up for that long..
After a sentence like that there is very likely no coming back into society.
