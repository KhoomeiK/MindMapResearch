Between the milk and the spray the spray has a thinner texture that spreads faster all over the face in one go so it feels less of a hassle to use every morning. The milk is somewhat thicker and takes more time to apply the required amount. It's kind of a personal sensory preference too, I don't like products that feel thick on application. I did not notice any pilling with the milk though, and definitely none with the spray (I don't actually spray it onto my face but in my hand and then apply it as any sunscreen lotion).

About the rosehip and squalane oils, she only said to be ""careful"" and that they ""can"" break you out, which is true. I've tried a bunch and I've come to the conclusion those are the two that I can rely on not to break me out but I've seen a number of posts where other people said either one or the other broke them out horribly.

Concerning what she said about too many products, some people post really long routines and are fine with it but we regularly get posts also titled ""I simplified my routine and it saved my skin"". I've seen some very dramatically improved Before/After posts where the routine was literally 3 products and many 3-5 tops. I have a long routine too and I'm thinking of dialing down or at least waiting for some products to finish and not replacing them to stop layering so many things.

The rest is her personal opinions and those products work great for some people and break out others too, it depends on your skin type and needs. We don't all react the same. Feel free to disregard if you feel like CeraVe and Vaseline work for you."

It's not, I agree with you. I'm French, took Spanish and Italian, studied German, dabbled in learning some Asian languages as a pastime (also my parents are Cambodian and I've only ever learnt literally three words of their language despite lifetime exposure), and English IS one of the easiest languages to learn, if not the easiest.

Few tenses, limited conjugations, unlike in French and Spanish where you'd have to learn A LOT of those. No female or male nouns to learn either (plus their singular and plural forms and corresponding adjectives), no declension nightmares unlike in Latin, German, Russian or Finnish, no thousands of ideograms or kanji to memorize, which all take a lot of time to learn. The grammar really is simple but that's not to say English is a basic dumb language, I find it's one of its charms and personally it's my favourite.

English really is super duper easy to pick up and easily become conversant in compared to others (and yeah possibly more so for fellow Europeans). I really would have hated to pick up French as a second language, too many rules to learn when English has so few. That's why I sucked at Spanish, it's similar and I never wanted to put in the time to memorize the conjugations in school and would be pretty much unable to speak one correct sentence of it just for that alone. 

The rest, to become fluent in English, is just practice and vocabulary building which you can do by just getting on the internet to talk to other people, reading books, listening to English language music and watching movies (more or less easy to access depending on where you are)."

I got it for my irritated neck but tried it on the eyes since it's for the face and eyes and ended up liking it. My left undereye had been puffy for about a year and after a few weeks use the puffiness was hardly noticeable. Now after over a month, I notice it's not puffy at all anymore. Also the fine lines that had started deepening are a lot less marked and visible and my undereyes are again pretty smooth. Before that, I went through two tubs of eye patches from Heimish and Jayjun and didn't feel like it did much, and certainly had no lasting effects. Plus it's a hassle, I like to do my entire routine in one go, without having to take 10-20mn breaks.

I don't feel the need to shop around for new eye creams now I've found this one and will stick to it for the time being, plus it's a 50ml bottle and it's handy to have when you irritate your skin with actives.

I also layer an oil blend on my undereyes under the cream too. I've been doing it for a year and don't know how much that helps but I see it as a preventative measure since wrinkles occur when the skin dries up and that area doesn't produce oil. It's an extra layer to keep the skin soft and moist longer; I mix 2 or 3 oils with anti-aging properties (prickly pear seed, sea buckthorn, marula, or rosehip oil) in a [glass roll-on bottle](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B-wV-dLYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg).

In the morning, I layer the roll-on oil blend under suncream (Purito Centella Unscented, keeps the skin moist for hours) and at night I layer the oil blend under the Toleriane Ultra cream and so far that's been the best combo, I've seen a lot of improvement. I just have some light dark circles now so that's doing nothing for them.

Oh, and before I got the Toleriane Ultra I started using the Niod Fractionated eye contour concentrate I got in the discounted Deciem Birthday set. I don't normally buy something this pricy but it seemed like a bargain. Don't know if that's done anything at all, I really noticed improvements only after I started using the Toleriane Ultra."

6 years was about how long she'd been in Switzerland with her sister when I went to live there in 2002 and roomed with her for several years. Actually more than that, I remember she was a teenager still in highschool when she came to Switzerland, between 15 and 17 during the events that led to her fleeing Turkey, and she was about 25 when I met her. By the way, your link says ""A foreigner can apply for naturalization if he has lived in Switzerland for at least 12 years (adolescence between 10 and 20 years is counted twice)"" so she would have qualified even sooner.

I lived in Switzerland for 6 years. At the time I know she had a Swiss passport to travel, and maybe she didn't have citizenship right at the moment I arrived in Switzerland myself, and when she herself had been there for 6-8 years, but in the time span I lived there she'd have had it. I vaguely remember her talking about this stuff back then but it's been a long time now and I didn't exactly keep tabs on it. I'm in no doubt she has it by now.

But again, my main point is they are not so choosy with citizenship and that not only the rich can get in.

I knew her for years and I remember being struck by how easily she got help with everything always, financially, with paperwork, everything. I grew up in France and frankly from all I've seen the Swiss are even more helpful and generous; aid is much stingier in France. She was much better off than I was. They gave enough money for her elderly parents to be able to live in a nice new apartment. She had a yearly stipend of 24 000 CHF from the government to live on during her studies, university tuition being free (they give that to Swiss orphans too up to the age of 25, and you're an orphan if you have just one deceased parent). I'm French, at the time French students got 900 Francs a month, and nowadays around 150‚Ç¨ a month as financial aid. The 900 francs would hardly cover rent back then and the 150‚Ç¨ definitely wouldn't nowadays.

If you have to be rich to get in, how are they giving good chunks of money to pisspoor obscure people to help them live there ? I met a lot of her other Kurdish friends, there was a whole community there that I'm sure were in similar circumstances as she was.

My own parents came to France as political refugees fleeing a genocide and by the time I was born 6 years later I'm pretty sure we were all sorted citizenship-wise, I never had to hear any talk about that, we were French already, I assumed it was a simple quick process."
