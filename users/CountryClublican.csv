I had a similar problem with a large bureaucracy, but you are ultimately responsible. I can't say what exactly to do, but you need to fix it yourself instead of trying to blame others."

DIY,fdlo9ke,t1_fdh4fha,1578528559.0,"It appears the water drains onto your neighbor's property, which isn't really a solution. I always put landscape drains in my backyards leading out to the street to avoid flooding. At least you have some room under the grass to hold the water, until it gets saturated, then you will have a problem. After living in Houston and Seattle, I have always planned for drainage. Now living in Southern California, I find that even some professional contractors here really don't consider drainage when building."

There is a similar urban myth going around about the demise of the Los Angeles street car. The fact is, people prefer cars."
DIY,fdgwvvy,t3_el6z1f,1578410321.0,I don't see any drainage. You will have flooding. You should have put landscape drains leading out to the front street gutters to allow rain water to run off.
