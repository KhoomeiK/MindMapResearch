It's a bad faith argument to try to distract from actually discussing the substance of the issue, which is that WE ALREADY PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS OTHER COUNTRIES FOR HEALTHCARE AND GET WORSE RESULTS.  I mean, maybe if we paid less but also got worse results it would even be debatable but the fact that it's neither pragmatic nor fiscally convenient means that the reasoning for rejecting universal healthcare is not based on the merits but fear of change and the government which are entirely unfounded.

On the one hand we have the current system which everybody agrees sucks and takes way too much time, energy, and money and on the other hand we have a system which 32/33 developed countries have made work for them.
