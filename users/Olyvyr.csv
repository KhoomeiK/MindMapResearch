But to each his own. I just don't mind a simple introduction or ""Hi"" to get a conversation going."

trashy,fe4oym4,t1_fe4haws,1578861522.0,"No, you just haven't proven equal value.

A hotelier could just as easily have no idea who Taylor Swift is. That doesn't mean she asked for a free room, she just didn't offer (perceived) valuable consideration to the hotelier.

He's justified in rejecting Swift's offer despite her exposure almost certainly being more valuable than the room.

I agree with your point about who has the burden of proving the value of their offer. I just disagree that failing to meet that burden means the thing offered was worthless."

That's where the hotel loses me. I'm sure if Taylor Swift offered to blast her stay all over social media for a ""free"" room they would have trouble responding through their orgasms.

Of course, it is 100% up to this person to demonstrate the value of her exposure, and that clearly wasn't done."

It's completely fine for the hotel to say no (I would likely do the same), but they are wrong in valuing social media influencer exposure itself at $0.

I don't doubt it can provide value when done correctly by the right person."
