AskWomen,ffdn9ve,t1_ffd9ggz,1579824505.0,I moved after 21 years of marriage and promises things would be better.  Worst mistake I ever made.  They weren't.  Divorced now and further from friends and family.  Difficult to move back because of finances.

christmas,ffb1aos,t1_ffb07st,1579749317.0,Do you write down things from the Christmas that just passed or what you want to do for the next Christmas? Pictures or notes? I've never heard of this before.
AskWomen,ffasxy0,t3_es99h3,1579743754.0,"I got divorced after 23 years of marriage and a cancer diagnosis.  The combination ruined me financially.  I get by now but I'm still alone and have very little in retirement savings.  No idea how I will retire.  A couple of my friends have retired early and are traveling, etc. One of my  best friends who was divorced met a great guy and got married. I'm so happy for her but it's hard. I just want to be financially safe and have someone love me."

ask,ff505ze,t3_ero0oa,1579576706.0,"23 thousand dollars for the operating room/3 day hospital stay for my first reconstruction surgery after my mastectomy.  Additional 7 thousand for the Dr who did the surgery.  Additional 2 thousand for the anesthesiologist.  After all the extra small stuff I owed about 6 thousand dollars.  
I did a clinical trial for my cancer treatment so those expenses were mostly covered by the study.  
Except for the $1800 Nuelasta shot I needed every 3 weeks."

personalfinance,ff1u2lx,t3_er4l05,1579486198.0,"I would suggest getting a credit card,  Discover as some have mentioned.  If not a secured one. Transfer your Amazon,  spotify etc to it and pay them off in full EVERY MONTH.  
Pull a credit report (free) and check to be sure everything on it is accurate.  
Put some money into savings for emergencies and for security deposits for an apartment (if you will need one), possible car repair, that sort of thing.  Then start paying your student loans.  That debt increases so quickly it will make your head spin. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,ff1swfj,t1_ff0qcc0,1579485449.0,"Exactly!! If she has a headache she's on her own.  A whole 4 days a month and he can't handle it!

ask,ff0x1k5,t3_er0q2h,1579473109.0,Being on the prom committee and not going to prom. Guy who was my almost bf asked a girl from a different school. Broke my heart.  This was also years ago and going with your girlfriends as a group wasn't a thing.
CleaningTips,fexwnfe,t3_eqtjej,1579437687.0,Not a cleaning tip but is it returnable? I'd try and ask for a replacement.

CleaningTips,fexw1h0,t3_eqtuj4,1579437396.0,"Get an old toothbrush,  hold the sneaker so cold water runs over the side only and scrub the mud with the toothbrush. Keep turning the shoe to get all sides. Stick newspaper inside and let it air dry. If the laces are dirty take them out and hand wash with a little detergent. Good luck!"
Parenting,feu1sy0,t3_eqh3on,1579382259.0,"My kids are 25 M and 31F, I don't miss the stress of toddler years or teenage years. Different ages present different challenges. But I sure do miss the hugs and kisses and the flowers (weeds lol) picked from the yard, the school drawings, the time spent together.  It's great to do adult things with them, but I would love one of those ""mommy I love you"" hugs from when they were little. I am divorced, and the empty nest is too quiet at times."

AmItheAsshole,felfeui,t3_epnbxq,1579220891.0,I think OP should go to the wedding and be with his best friend. Her grief is raw and she has other people to lean on. When my mom passed unexpectedly the days following were a blur.  I don't know if I could tell you what end was up for days. The relationship is only 2 years old and after this could be over.  If she breaks up with him he is going to regret not going to the wedding the rest of his life.

AmItheAsshole,fe2f2ej,t3_enmjga,1578837697.0,"YTA - she made sure you were taken care of and by your own statement you always had what you needed.  She sacrificed ALOT. You got the carpet,  not her. I'm a single mom and would be so very hurt if one of my kids said that to me.  Wanting to give your child more I understand,  but what you said is terrible. You need to apologize and appreciate all she did for you and your siblings."

productivity,fdm1stq,t3_em00jq,1578537776.0,"I decided last year to lose weight and get in better shape.  Weighed and measured myself and then started.  Little by little, small steps.  Just did it because I was determined,  did I enjoy not having that cookie or candy, no of course not! But I sure did get excited about fitting in a smaller size jeans and people noticing.  I had times I couldn't be bothered,  but looked at them as one time lapses and just got back on track the next day.  I feel better now than I have in years. I also stopped comparing myself to other people, there will always be someone stronger, skinnier,  more in shape. Also someone weaker, more overweight,  etc.  Don't beat yourself up and take it one day at a time.  Good luck!"

I consider myself lucky.  I hope you never receive that diagnosis.  Your parents are probably happy she's alive.  And she obviously needs the attention, maybe she's still struggling with the diagnosis and could benefit from counseling. Hope your Dad is ok, concentrate on him, he needs your help and support."
