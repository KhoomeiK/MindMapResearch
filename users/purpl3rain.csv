stepparents,ffa8kj7,t3_esdd9r,1579729983.0,"This sounds a lot like my SO. I spent a lot of time worrying about how FSKs were being raised. Examples:

* FSD8 still can't go to bed without someone laying with her until she's asleep.
* Kids get to pick the menu for every meal, even if it's different for each.
* Wayyy too many sweets.
* FSS12 won't go anywhere by himself in public, even to the bathroom.
* FSS12 and FSD8 are both overweight, and don't do any physical activities like sports or bike riding.

So yeah, lack of independence, lack of motivation, spoiled, etc.

But SO said something to me that made me stop. He told me he didn't care if his kids were the smartest, if they were the most talented, if they got the best grades or if they were the most popular. What he cared about was if they were good people. If they were kind.

And you know what? They are. FSD8 may still refuse to eat anything other than chicken nuggets and spaghetti noodles, but her teacher told us she always partners with the 'slow' kid in gym class. FSS12 may be a pain to drag out of bed in the mornings, but he's the only one who befriended the boy in his class with selective mutism. FSS15 may insist on watching the Star Wars movies every night of the week, but he's a marvelously sweet and patient older brother.

They're good kids. Even if they're being raised in a way I don't always agree with. So I've learned to shut up now and then and keep the bigger picture in mind."

TechLeader,feh4qvd,t3_ep2b20,1579109115.0,"Sounds like your boss is spinning a bit, and trying to cover his ass when he doesn't know the answer. YMMV, but I've supported new bosses in the past by offering to brief them on historical context of certain requests and processes ahead of time. This is good for discussions where there are higher-ups or other teams involved.

You need to approach it delicately though, as ""knowing about this thing that happened before you got here could be helpful for you to make informed decisions"" instead of ""you obviously don't know what you're doing so I'll explain it to you"".

You can also practice phrases to use in the moment, in situations that are lower-stakes:

* In the past, we've done X because Y was considered a priority. If that's changed, can you walk me through the new strategy?
* If we make X change, Y will be affected. Can you clarify how that should be communicated/handled?"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feh2oau,t3_ep36pr,1579107884.0,"I've been on both sides of performance reviews, I've had great ones and ones that made me want to quit. Here are some things to remember:

* Conduct your self-review ahead of time. Go over your review from last year and make some notes about how you've met those goals. Come prepared with examples of amazing shit you've done, as well as one or two things you'd like to focus on next year.
* If anything in your review is a surprise, your manager has failed. They should be communicating with you in a timely manner, not hoarding examples for a 'gotcha' moment. So if you're surprised by negative feedback, ask them why this is the first you're hearing about it.
* If you don't understand your feedback, ask questions. Make them clarify. If you get shit sandwiches and mixed comments, flat-out ask if they're happy with your overall performance. If not, make sure they're giving you actionable criticism, and ongoing support as you work to hit the marks defined for improvement.
* This isn't your only chance to have this conversation. If you walk out the door and immediately wish you had said/asked/challenged something, ask for a follow-up! It's okay if you need time to gather your thoughts and form a response.
* Channel Peggy Carter. Know your worth."
