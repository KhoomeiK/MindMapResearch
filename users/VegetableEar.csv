University student, I've picked a direction; it's just the pressure to take my undergrad and go into the workforce. I'm 27 now. I want to push on and struggle my way through postgrad, chase my dream. So many of those around me are pushing my to take life more seriously, to go into a career; do xyz and work fulltime. It really doesn't run in a straight line, I'm hopeful for the next day ... I just really need a fucking release at the moment. I need to break out of this, I feel like I'm just keeping my manic nature in check. But I hate it, I just want to do something stupid, take a risk and feel like I'm not this lump of stone.

I struggle to feel worth or like I deserve the friendship. I see myself as me, I see my current struggles, my difficulties with work, friendships, relationships. My role in society as a 'student' at an age whre I feel I should be pushing into other areas. And here, a person who is starting a family, succesful in their career takes the currency of their time, and spends it on me.   


I always feel as if that will run out, like I will be left behind. I feel I get outpaced by my friends often and left behind. I feel that too, but my experience with people who have been absued is extremely limited. Each of the people I've known who have been abused have been partners, and have been summarily abusive towards me. But I still crave them, and that connection they offered. The solace of understanding. I try and trust, and to always give people a chance, to be honest and true to me and myself. I've always worn my heart on my sleeve so to speak, in friendships, and all relationships. It's getting exhausting being that way.

I managed to break away from it at the age of sixteen and distance myself from them for two years. I ended up back 'with' them, they got me to give up everything in my life, move to another part of my country and after I had done all this they spent years fucking with me deeply. I was an adult then and It was certainly 'differen't, as I was no longer a child but it was equally painful and damaging due to the role and figure they were/(are sometimes still) in my life.   


It took me another five years to cut them out of my life, it took me building myself something new, cutting out all the things and people in my life who didn't empower me but instead kept me where I was. It's been another three years and I can't say it's easy or that life is normal; but I don't question every action by their yardstick, and I live through my own lens now. I'm learning on my own and my decisions are mine, or at least informed by people who genuinely wish well in me and my life. It's hard to give advice, all I can say is it is so difficult, and to borrow from something I saw recently; we are seeds.

After the abuse I was a catatonic zombie, I lost all my friends and I started being bullied and made fun of at school. I was like a curiosity instead of a person. 

I still struggle with friendships, it's been a long time since it all happened. I had to relearn to make eye contact and my ability to socialise was way way behind my peers and people I would be friends with. It's been a very lonely life since then, and I've found some measure of peace in myself and being around me. But I've had to slog through being able to be at some quasi normal level of social ability, it's left me a reserved person socially. Happy news is, I have a few close friends these days. I'm still a bit of a doormat in life, even in friendships and I don't feel like I have someone I can talk to and share anything whenever I need to. But a lot of that feeling is in my head, if I reach out they are there. It's just the trust, fear and anxiety is hard to get past.

It seems that it's used as an excuse not to make individual changes I feel. That being said, the power government has is huge. The issue in Australia at least is that we have Murdoch shaping in a large way who we give that power to. I suppose you could argue because of this the government is not the one with true power. 

But you are correct in saying corporations driven by consumerism is the culrpit. They've been allowed to run virtually unchecked, and people generally don't care how their clothing is made or how much damage the food on their plate contributes to emissions. But I struggle to blame individuals for being constantly lied to and marketed to when we all should be informed and protected. 

It is painful how little people seem to care though. Or how few people want to take on the responsibility to make better choices in how they consume.
