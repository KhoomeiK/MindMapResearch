PoliticalDiscussion,ffg4dmq,t3_etbq3p,1579898204.0,What about increases on tickets to violent movies due to gun violence or being on a wait list for violent video games. Get out of here with that bullshit. I like when Obamacare completely restructured the health care system for 20 million people. The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few. Obamacare disrupted more people‚Äôs healthcare than it gave to people without healthcare. But then again liberals think free stuff works in capitalism üòµ

facepalm,ff40pja,t3_eqx8bv,1579553005.0,I never once said I don‚Äôt support trans people at all. I do support any person who wants to be who they are. Gay trans bi. But it is a massive grey area in sports. I actually really don‚Äôt care too much about sports. But people dedicating their entire lives to something and losing to someone who is way bigger or superior due to biology and yes there are massive biological differences in genders. I‚Äôm not sure how you pulled me into not supporting their identity to someone getting the shit kicked out of them idk. I know reading text online can be interpreted wrong. Or you have a certain mindset reading it possibly. Also if someone says they were born in the wrong body which I‚Äôm not that type of person so I won‚Äôt speak on it; plenty of people are actually claiming they are black or Chinese or Filipino. So I get confused about identities. You almost can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs genuine or out total thought behind what they say. I heard a psychology professor ask someone if you believe your a man when your a woman can‚Äôt you say your 85 years old when your only 19. It‚Äôs the same thing in terms of biology. Also thousands of trans people regret transitioning and some have also committed suicide. It‚Äôs a huge issue so yes trans people deserve to be happy and be who they want to be but..... it‚Äôs a massive unknown in a lot of aspects.

wholesomebpt,ff3tdck,t1_ff3qmra,1579548430.0,Yea most definitely. It‚Äôs funny how people can‚Äôt be positive. A guy at work lost a few pounds by fasting then he started eating shit food again gaining weight back and I was helpful saying get back on your diet bro. You were losing weight like you wanted to eat junk food. And he knew I was right and I joked that I‚Äôd be the villain if I had to be to help him in the long run and he laughed.

Only sociopaths and sick bastards don‚Äôt mind doing it to get a one night stand. Nothing of true value comes from behavior like this. I suppose it‚Äôs so called alpha energy like they don‚Äôt care about the outcome which is what a lot of women unconsciously are attracted to but it‚Äôs the farthest thing from an alpha male.

nottheonion,ff3gtkl,t1_ff33dxr,1579540736.0,Oh man I feel your pain. I work in a luxury skyscraper for the super wealthy in NYC. Won‚Äôt elaborate on my job but ....me and coworkers have learned once you start taking extra tasks upon yourself that really isn‚Äôt your job it is now expected of you by everyone or at least mainly your supervisors. Once you say no to these things or jobs that you literally don‚Äôt know or are uncomfortable doing it‚Äôs somehow an issue. Me and many many workers have come to learn this. The universe is upside down. I was asked by an engineer to go about 25 feet up on a mechanical rise. This is literally the engineers  job and I told him why did our boss send you to tell me to do this. This makes no sense I said nothing against you but I‚Äôm not doing this I‚Äôve never used this machine b4. Lol workplaces are a joke
nottheonion,ff3f6wh,t1_ff2wako,1579539825.0,I love it! That‚Äôs how it is everywhere. Workplaces are completely backwards. Me and all my coworkers talk about it. Managers and supervisors will constantly bother the best workers(not by opinion). The workers taking more hours to help the team or your boss get work done. The workers picking up others workloads or finding mistakes and problems and correcting them. The workers causing the problems commuting insurance fraud. Always being late violating serious rules and guidelines in the workplace just get ignored. It‚Äôs a massive paradox me and dozens of workers and come to realize and have had trouble explaining or putting into words. But we realize it is the status quo now.
nottheonion,ff3eswk,t3_erbflf,1579539608.0,It‚Äôs 100% true. The overwhelming amount of Promotions now and days are through knowing someone or due to politics in the work place not years of service or word-load performance. I‚Äôm used to it at several jobs but I highly suggest everyone begin working hard on projects that can free them from the typical 40 hour work week slavery unless you got into a profession you truly love. I mean look at people who were literally retired and had to come out of retirement because their 401k or retirement funds were wiped out from the mortgage scam crisis.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fehfjrg,t3_eoxbfu,1579115498.0,"Yea I blame the hiring process of police departments it‚Äôs a fucking joke. I really think they have no idea what there doing to screen candidates in anyway. You see this officer a few years back planning to kill and eat his wife and other targets. So many police officers get hired due to knowing someone. I‚Äôve been through several hiring processes with various police departments. Making accusations based on ethnicity or heritages. I especially liked when a New York State trooper detective asked me about 50 times if I‚Äôm an alcoholic because I‚Äôm Irish. Told repeated stories about how I barely drank and how many times I‚Äôd been intoxicated in my life. Investigators name was Jahn from troop F in Middletown New York. Even my family some of which are retired law enforcement said he was highly unprofessional and a scumbag got bad vibes off of. My fianc√©e a family said the same thing. Saying he was caught up on the feeling I drink lol. I guess once a shitty cop has his mind made up that‚Äôs that, no need to look at relative evidence.  I remember one test in New York State for a small towns department. A with a room with roughly 150-200 young men sitting around waiting for the test to be handed out. A guy next to me and a few others points to a younger looking guy than most in the room. He says ‚Äú you see that kid‚Äù.... we say yea.... ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the police chiefs son, I just found out.‚Äù Myself and about ten other guys got up and walked out. That individual got the job. I liked one interview with an investigator from port authority at penn station. I think it was my second visit back when a detective told me he saw me drinking in a bar with a blonde woman in the train station after an interview. I told him this was only my second time ever being in pen station and hadn‚Äôt been in any establishments. We went back and forth for about 15 mins as to wether he was right or not.  At which point I said ‚Äúunfortunately your mistaken and I‚Äôd love to take a polygraph that it wasn‚Äôt me. Are we still going to waste time as to you seeing someone you think was me drinking with a girl who wasn‚Äôt my girlfriend?‚Äù He replies ok, but I‚Äôm almost never wrong about seeing someone. Just a few of my experiences with how absolutely fucking retarded SOME police departments hiring processes and choices are. Also, not sure why veterans who were deployed are so readily sought after for police jobs. Veterans are trained to kill. Police officers first instinct should not be to shoot or kill. Not to mention the widespread ptsd epidemic among veterans."

MapPorn,fdqyf61,t1_fdpue21,1578676740.0,"Let‚Äôs ignore the fact the mongol empire at its peak was 1100 years after Rome‚Äôs peak. Your comparing apples and oranges than again you and me are no comparison. Have you ever heard of population growth?
Let‚Äôs see the Romans created 

-modern day water and sewer management.
-Revolutionized construction with concrete. 
-the aqueducts, most advanced water transportation system in the ancient world. 
-air conditioning 
To name just a few I can continue. The mongols were larger but were nomadic people riding horses across massive fields. So to quote you you‚Äôre correct. The Romans are no comparison to guys on horses with bows living in tents 1100 years later with no technological advances centuries later. Oh sorry! they stuffed gun powder into metal balls to make hand grenades which they simply copied from the Chinese. 
And I‚Äôm not praising either civilization they both raped, pillaged and enslaved people. But Rome was far superior.
