ChronicPain,fep1i2a,t1_feoz6r6,1579310037.0,I think I have forgotten what it felt like to be better and walk without a cane. I always tell people I wish the drugs did anything euphoric again.
holdmycosmo,fekb3fm,t1_fek65zx,1579196344.0,I don't listen to the videos and that was my thought too
FoodAddiction,fekaoki,t1_fek5v3i,1579196100.0,I know it sounds odd and may not work for you but I found for myself that a bit of light meditation listing to music and just exploring your mind and trying to get to the root of the issue. I guess it's pretty similar to what the other person said but hope this helps and I understand being the biggest invisible person.
AskReddit,fek1vtt,t1_fejy0f6,1579190836.0,"Fuck Caillou, that little shit needs to be beat down. I swear atleast try not to suck. 

That being said Peppa pig needs to meet a luau. I would gladly burn money to make sure she never aired again."
fightporn,fe7y5bz,t3_eo3bhn,1578920469.0,Damn people don't know what they are getting into when they hit a ref. That's how to get everyone to wreck you. I'm glad the ref showed him he doesn't take shit.
diabetes,fe3g8ra,t1_fe36fkb,1578849014.0,Many type 2 don't need insulin instead can control with diet and pills.
insanepeoplefacebook,fe2x7v2,t3_eniz0k,1578843868.0,I still don't understand the problem with making the earth better. Worse case scenario we are wrong and the world is a better place for the next generation.
Showerthoughts,fe2vus4,t1_fe1mz8x,1578843377.0,Well we do have massive bombs and giant boats with enough power to destroy it all. Besides we are killing everything in the ocean without any remorse.

ChronicPain,fdzweg3,t3_eng5cl,1578797413.0,"I always feel like people choose to ignore me instead of acknowledging that I am disabled. It's depressing and kinda hurtful if I'm being honest. I get why people do that, they can't accept the thought of mortality or don't know how to deal with it. Then there's always the a holes who just look down on you for being broken and not what you used to be. I walk with a cane yes, but it also is made with a solid steel shank. Brings me joy to think about knee capping the last set of the people who look down on disability."
ChronicPain,fdtf45s,t3_en182a,1578715860.0,"I've heard that your brain tries to keep you just on the edge of sane. I don't know the validity of the statement but it makes sense to me.
Honestly I don't think I could have dealt with it all at once but the past ten years of buildup and I'm still not at the limit I thought I was reaching.

You shouldn't have to make yourself deal with it. I do it but mostly because I don't take pain meds anymore (not by choice). It's a personal thing though some days I just grit my teeth and do stuff since I will be in pain anyway."

ChronicPain,fcvguvd,t1_fcv8b83,1578001815.0,"I've had those long migraines before without meds that my insurance doesn't think I need. Migraines are no joke. Always love when people say why can't you come to work... It like of course I would if I could stand up without puking. I get that they never had one, but doesn't make me not want to hit them in the throat."
ChronicPain,fcvgitm,t3_ej2txs,1578001617.0,"I had a reaction to the meds, made me psychotically mad.

lingling40hrs,fcre9hp,t1_fcr9j3l,1577900654.0,We used to tape the hell out of the bully's worked for a few before it somehow disappeared..... We took it out back and office spaced the hell out of it.

ChronicPain,fc793r6,t1_fc6wdc4,1577500789.0,"Holy hell for everyone who's ever said everyone has pain can be hit by a car for all I care.

My mother in law said oh I get headaches too when I said I had a migraine.... It's like, no, not the same thing..... But she has no reference so I get that atleast she's trying to sympathize.... Still hate it but you know."

AskMen,fc738vw,t1_fc6yqxj,1577496355.0,Nah more of being protective of my friends. I should add I don't do it without their asking. They trust me to cut though people's lies
AskMen,fc7071k,t1_fc6ve38,1577494039.0,"I ask the same of everyone who is dating a loved one even friends. But I just want them to know that we don't put up with them intentionally hurting the other. 

But mostly the people that ask are not in the right when asking. They just want control. I just want everyone to be happy."
todayilearned,fc6wowi,t1_fc6jyvg,1577491435.0,"I like to think it's a form of leftovers from our ancestors like the jump reflex when startled awake and grabbing something or anxiety of things in the dark. 

Either way yes this kid did what everyone wants to think they would do. It's a tragedy that he died, he's the type of person who makes the world better to be in.

I hope that guy is hurting in prison if they let him live..."

FoodAddiction,fbaerz4,t3_eccavb,1576676090.0,"Ok well here's the thing I learned about myself, its an addiction.

Delete the apps and cancel your logins if you can. I was going into debt for food. Not something that I can easily help you get over. 

If you have insurance then call and find some Dr that helps with eating disorder or addiction.

I'm told there are over eater Anon out there, I haven't heard of them, but they are said to exist.

App that helped me was my fitness pal. Counting calories helps and try to stop when you reach the limit you set.

You can message me if you want to talk. I'm not licensed or anything like that but I can listen and give you advice I've learned. You have to take it day by day. If you have one bad day or even 20 just don't give up. I gave up and gained 200 pounds, please don't let it get that bad. I have a long way to go but I'm willing to help you if I can.

I hope something here helps you. Have a good day."
