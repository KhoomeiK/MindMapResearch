absolutelynotme_irl,feazq6h,t3_eo3cid,1578953947.0,I usually don’t talk to myself
SuicideWatch,fe5cfe2,t3_entv97,1578867687.0,"That was an interesting journey through your thoughts. I literally can’t say much. I enjoy analyzing my thoughts as well and I enjoy analyzing in general, that’s one reason why I’m so interested in computer science and programming. I think you are writing some valid and true points. Currently I‘m like fuck it, I can suck or I do something and I’m productive...I mean I can be depressed in front of my computer, but at least I’m doing something useful. I would like to move to another city or country but I don’t have the money"

2meirl42meirl4meirl,fcoticf,t1_fcoth0f,1577841131.0,Nice job bro
2meirl42meirl4meirl,fcos21f,t1_fco2ehi,1577840015.0,I already did
2meirl4meirl,fcos0fd,t1_fcorufy,1577839981.0,"Trust me, it's nice to be liked. But when everyone around you only likes you and you are never the first choice, never this one person to someone else...You will start asking yourself why they can only like me, like what's wrong with me?"
2meirl4meirl,fcortfd,t3_ei9mmm,1577839834.0,"Ufff...this one hit me. I'm this kind of person everyone wants to chill with, but no one wants to love me, they just like me."

AskReddit,fcns0nh,t1_fcmsgjg,1577817321.0,"Currently working on a portfolio, hopefully this will get me a job as a junior. I could try to get an degree but it would take a lot of time, possibly 6 years till I can go work."
fightporn,fcms4ec,t1_fcmgkxt,1577789545.0,"I don’t understand people. I don’t mind if your gay or not, in the first place it doesn’t matter to me so honestly why should I be different to somebody because he/she is gay? If people could just relax and start thinking about important things."
AskReddit,fcmrdnn,t1_fcmr737,1577788467.0,"Not yet, I definitely checked out some stuff. Usually it’s not nearby me so I can’t really afford it and I don’t like to go anywhere alone, socializing is not easy I know, I try my best. I would just love to discuss technology, approaching problems together and finding solutions and of course learning from other people. Thank you for the hint."
AskReddit,fcmr64j,t1_fcmqz2a,1577788166.0,"Yep I speak German, but English is like my second mother language. I‘m self taught developer and I still do it as a hobby. Most companies here are either small or medium sized, so most of them have German engineers. There is a huge amount of companies who are using Java and PHP so not much going on for people who love new tech or just want to work with it. Most small e-commerce companies are using stuff like Shopify, no sorry don’t want to bother with it. But yes English is definitely a plus and if you are fluent in German even better."
AskReddit,fcmqx3x,t1_fcmqjn1,1577787803.0,"Yeah I already had a great internship as a frontend dev and I knew more than my co worker who studied computer science but only on the practical part. Anyways it’s hard to get an internship nearby because I live in an area where are almost no tech companies. Would take an internship somewhere else, but can’t afford living there for 3 months on my own. So yeah it’s complicated, I’m currently lost. But 2020 is waiting for me!"
depression,fcmqgbv,t1_fclt83a,1577787140.0,"You hit me with this. I feel you bro. I don’t understand why this world and society is working? I mean literally, why? This world is so fucked up and most people are okay with it, it doesn’t bother them."

AskReddit,fcmq1u8,t1_fcmpq05,1577786573.0,"Definitely, I love it when people ask me stuff and I can be like listen here you little *** haha no seriously I love to answer questions about programming and technical stuff about how the internet works. Loving web/app development, dude I even enjoy watching someone programming on twitch."
AskReddit,fcmpxpz,t1_fcmp81x,1577786409.0,"I‘m living in a country where companies always relay on degrees. If you don’t have the right degree you are probably not the right person for the job mentality. But would love to life somewhere else, doesn’t matter to me, I would left if I could. Nothing here that holds me. I guess I‘m in a place where I don’t know where I‘ll end up. Literally nobody here to lead me, so I’m trying to learn to be my own leader."
depression,fcmosbj,t1_fclolvu,1577784766.0,"Oh yeah a dropout. Hating this stuff, being not able to pursue any career because of depression feels bad. I can feel you!"
AskReddit,fcmoeus,t1_fcmo0he,1577784240.0,If it wouldn’t be so hard...would love to talk about computer science stuff and programming. Would love to have a party with a few friends were we all programming on the same app haha would be a dream
AskReddit,fcmn5et,t1_fcmcr0w,1577782483.0,"Love programming. Can't really tell anyone around me, only people who are close to me know it. I don't know, it’s hard for me to talk about it 'cause for most people it's boring"

2meirl42meirl4meirl,fcmlydn,t1_fcmh6li,1577780878.0,"Thinking about how much I have in front of me...all those years and all these things. Next minute I see no sense in all, all the connections we make and all we do, everything is meaningless. Usually it only means something to one person nothing big and when you go nobody will remember you. We live life for the small things."
2meirl4meirl,fc8glmo,t1_fc6ovb0,1577534462.0,"Honestly some of us are not made for a relationship. I‘m not good and I know that I could never afford a stable life for my own family, so I should never have a family...it’s enough when I life on the street one day"

depression_memes,fc1fa3b,t1_fc1buig,1577317023.0,So when do we start?
2meirl42meirl4meirl,fc0kuiy,t1_fc0jqjt,1577293253.0,"Keep going! I pretty sure your on an good way and always try to accept yourself and your feelings, ‘cause only you can be the worst enemy to yourself.  

You will get to this point and believe me it will be the best feeling. Yes it will not cure you and you will not suddenly be without depression, but you will suddenly love yourself and accept your feelings ‘cause your feelings are a true thing. 

Take care of yourself, and if anything goes bad I’m here to talk!"
2meirl42meirl4meirl,fc0jkfh,t1_fc07dsq,1577292266.0,"Great to hear that you could open up yourself and that you are getting the help you deserve. But don’t stop after medication. Medication will help to get other thoughts and it will help to increase your mood, but it will not cure your problems. So make sure to work on yourself and make sure to think about your thoughts. I didn’t knew why I had such thoughts for many years and it was hard to let my true feelings speak, but it’s one of the best feelings. It’s like you suddenly know what’s wrong. So sometimes deep in your thoughts you know what’s wrong, but you don’t want to think about it consciously."
depression,fbyozxv,t1_fbylpcz,1577222542.0,"Yeah. I’m honestly disappointed with the society we have. People expect so much and I can’t even get myself out of bed to make something to eat. It’s embarrassing, but nobody is listening til it’s to late."
