WWU,ff4zh2f,t3_er8ikf,1579576197.0,"It's a weird one, but to be completely silent at will. Like nobody would be able to hear me breathing, or writing, or turning pages silent. I could turn it off to ask questions and talk to people. My anxiety manifests as being super self conscious about making noise so this would help me be a lot more present in class and use quiet spaces like the library more."

MadeMeSmile,ff1vigv,t3_er4iw7,1579487112.0,I've been managing an anxiety attack for the last hour and a half and this gave me just a few seconds of goddamn relief.
Cooking,fevafyf,t1_feva3d1,1579395095.0,"To me it tastes vegetable-y and kinda cheesy. It's a good thickener that adds nutrients and veggie taste to a dish. For a bowl of oatmeal I add a few heaping spoonfuls. I add a little salt (it's salty on its own), pepper, garlic powder as mentioned to it."
Cooking,feva12v,t3_eqiohp,1579394949.0,"My breakfast staple is oatmeal with garlic powder, any neutrally flavored cooked veggies I have, and nutritional yeast."

college,fen3hmu,t1_fen3f4z,1579276148.0,Also high school teachers and counselors lie about this shit don't listen to them.
college,fen3f4z,t3_epuys0,1579276103.0,"I applied with a 3.2, some ecs, no volunteer work, and average to below average test scores (exc my ACT). Got into a great school where I confident I'll make something out of myself. 

You'll do just fine I promise ðŸ’–"
WWU,fen2pfr,t3_eq1q9y,1579275648.0,I'm also super isolated (if not for the company of my biostats textbook)... Ugh.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fec6on6,t1_fc699h8,1578967560.0,"I used this template and followed your advice. I talked with my cousins for a while and I'm confident that they are acting autonomously and are genuinely interested in reconnecting with and protecting me. 

Thank you for helping me get some of my family back. I've been so sad without them."
bryology,feasohm,t3_eoavc9,1578951886.0,"Sorry for the crap picture, it was like my fourth cross section this morning. I was going through the sample of Sphagnum that was almost completely green except for a little red tinge in the capitulum. 

No cortical pores, which is normally indicator/rule-out of russowii, but everything else matched up, I couldn't find any other match in the acutifolia section and I'm quite sure that's the group to which it belongs. Found in NW Washington State, fairly close to BC. I used the Efloras guide, happy to describe other structures as I remember them."
streeteats,fctd11i,t1_fctbhva,1577939419.0,I really liked it! I had to eat in a hurry but I thought the burn of the spicy and the cream cheese mixed well.

ftm,fcjigrm,t3_ehhiix,1577688847.0,"I started growing my hair out when the gender crisis began and then when I started T a year later, I got too scared of going to the barber and getting clocked to get it cut. My hair is really difficult and I don't trust most folx to cut it.... So now I have really long hair. Honestly? I love it and it reminds me that I define my masculinity first."

I've never been to a waterpark, or on a rollercoaster, or camping, or to any Disney thing... This post and these comments give me a little motivation to give them a try.
