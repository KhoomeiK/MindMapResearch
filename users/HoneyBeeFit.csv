retail,fehqeus,t1_fehclpu,1579121805.0,"Yeah it's my first retail job, guess it was obvious from my being surprised by those things, haha. I know the dollar general (not a true dollar store, but cheap) near me has had a lot of theft problems, even with a few employees. I know some people are desperate but some stuff isn't a necessity. I have more empathy for the person stealing formula than the person casually strolling though our fire door with a TV in his cart."
retail,fegxrp6,t3_em4rpq,1579104895.0,"I don't know if it's that weird, but it was weird to me, I work in the produce dept of a wholesale store, and we sell these two packs of small, ready to eat Caeser salads. One day I saw the stack was noticeably slanted, so naturally I go to figure out why, only to find the bottom box was missing one of the salads. Someone stole a small salad bowl, and tried to hide the remainder under the others. Can't imagine feeling too proud walking out of a store with a salad in your purse (presumably, as it's not pocket size). 

I've also had a bag of organic potatoes turn up half empty (organic, so it's a small bag, but that's 2-3 potatoes ffs).

Again, it's probably not super weird, I'm sure people in similar jobs get this a lot, but the thought of someone walking out of the store with these items on them somewhere is slightly amusing."

ArtistLounge,fd3cm6m,t3_ejq5t5,1578156897.0,"Me reading anything about a new sketchbook with one I'm a few pages into, and another brand new because it came in a two pack: ""Hmmm, I think I need a new sketchbook.""

On another note, I really gotta get back in the mindset of just having fun with my sketchbooks, and not worrying about making them ""pretty."" It puts me in a rut every time."
notliketheothergirls,fd373uf,t3_ejvzwz,1578155317.0,"One time I went into GameStop and an employee asked if I needed help finding anything. Clearly because I'm female, and happen to be gorgeous, they assumed I didn't know where the game I wanted was. GameStop employees are so shocked that women play games. Sure it was a female employee asking, but if it was a man I'm sure I would have gotten a job offer, because I walked in there and am a woman. Did I mention I'm pretty?!"

I'd agree to it just to start teaching them shit like Santa's not real, your mom just gives you money for your teeth then throws them out, baby Jesus is a myth, like Zeus, or  well, Santa, and so on. (Ok, I wouldn't because I'm an anxious shit who'd fortunately be on enough klonazepam to just say no, but I wish I could be that person.)"
