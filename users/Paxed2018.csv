crafts,fdselvg,t1_fdprt9n,1578700932.0,I do metalsmithing so I fabricate the entire process. You can YouTube metalsmithing sterling silver and watch a couple videos :)

crafts,fcwlkjo,t1_fcwlhjs,1578029027.0,"I took metalsmithing classes for three years. Now I have ventured out on my own. Sometimes colleges offer classes, but I happened to have a local artist who taught out of her studio. She is light years beyond me in the craft."
dogpictures,fcwge67,t3_ej7fjk,1578024943.0,I’m so sorry. I lost my girl two weeks ago today. I know how deep the pain is. Sending you strength.
crafts,fcwew8v,t1_fcwer04,1578023860.0,It’s just honesty. If you look into purchasing stones a majority come from China and India. A lot of them are dyed. It’s just facts. I’m sorry that upsets you.
crafts,fcwejqz,t1_fcwegmk,1578023617.0,It’s actually an antique silver spoon that I made into a pendant. :) rutilated quartz went perfectly with it.

crafts,fcwdvwp,t1_fcwbbmh,1578023156.0,A majority of stones that are dyed are from China and India. It’s pretty easy to figure that out. Carry on...
crafts,fcwa503,t1_fcw9g4s,1578020663.0,"Thank you. It was really fun to make. I stopped metalsmithing for about 6 months, while I was dealing with some personal issues. It was nice to be creating again."
crafts,fcwa0nb,t1_fcw9yd9,1578020582.0,Wow that’s too bad. I hope that people look to supporting local artist and not fake dyed pieces from China.
dogpictures,fbqbim5,t1_fbmgy0y,1577030120.0,I’m trying to explain to that my husband currently. Rogue was the only surviving puppy of her litter.  She was his everything. I’m sure my husband is mourning like I am and will come around eventually.
