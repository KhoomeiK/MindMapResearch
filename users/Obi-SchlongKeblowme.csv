Tentative YTA - After 15 years you know each other well enough to where this shouldn't matter. The whole ""same wavelength"" argument is ridiculous and stupid. You either want to be around this friend or you don't (which means he's no longer friend material for you). One of the things that makes long friendships great is that you allow each other space to be yourselves and have stretches of time where you aren't at your best and your buds stick by you."

It would mean they have no need for a replay room and (in theory) negate the need for a video/replay room in their games. That would be a great punishment as long as it applied on the road, too."
baseball,feoxl75,t3_eq73rc,1579307580.0,"This is interesting. They have no real oversight authority until laws are being broken. Cheating at a sport like this, technically, isn't illegal by any real state or federal law. Guys illegally buying and taking steroids and everything that came along with that is illegal. This is what the ""let 'em all juice"" people never understood.

However, with more states legalizing gambling on sports this could fall into concerns of fraud. Imagine the rats nest if they start going back and looking at money trails of team staff, players, coaches yadayadaya."

You can't make her do these things or do them for her. Being embarrassed and scared is part of life and we all have to deal with it. Life is about choices and many of them center on fear. 

She needs to consider what comes after all those rotten teeth are gone because the pain won't be over then either. Relationships are a two-way street. She should give a shit about you and respect the fact that you've tolerated it for a long time and want a better future. Seems like you've been patient are understandably reaching your limit.

Just his prospect rankings? Because those are not sure things by any stretch. He is still very young and talented for sure with room to improve. I just don't get the hype when I look at his minor league numbers. 

Prospects who perform well in the majors after being hyped like this often tear up the minors at some point. He hasn't really excelled since A ball. To be fair, he only has 27 games at AAA and it was decent at best. I think he needs a pretty stout performance at AAA this year before we can even consider a late call up. Even in this thread people seem to think he may be an elite MLB outfielder one day but I wonder if they remember guys like BJ Upton. He is worth trading for a top-tier starter at this point."
