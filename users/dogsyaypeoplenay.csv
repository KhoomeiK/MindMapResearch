My600lbLife,ffav0ew,t1_ffatswy,1579745126.0,I can't believe there is no one in his life that could get another pair of pants or find someone to make some. It's so demeaning and sad.

dogpictures,fdiucfh,t1_fdgtlji,1578451225.0,"They see them as tools rather than living, feeling beings. I used to volunteer with a rescue that cared  for a lot if puppy mill victims. It was horrific.  The millers were plain evil. After trying to run us down with her SUV, one woman actually said to me that they were equipment and tools of her trade. The dogs that were rescued from her mill were near death, missing limbs, missing eyes. Some didn't survive the trip to the emergency vet. I would never wish cancer in anyone, but might have felt like celebrating when she was diagnosed and suffering."
