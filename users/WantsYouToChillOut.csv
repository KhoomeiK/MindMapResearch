Oh, you know, because every research institution prior to the trump administration have conducted research stating time and time again that this would have no affect on their ability to serve. The best part is, that’s not even what’s being debated here.

I said the right constantly makes fun of and belittles transgender people. This is objectively true. 

The basis for that decision was based on a study that states that there is a disproportionate suicide rate for transgender people. When this study was conducted the sample size was a large group of college students, less than an 8th of which were transgender. IIRC It found that most college students in that sample had considered suicide, and then the right wingers (esp. ben shapiro and trump) incorrectly extrapolated that data to be only about transgender people.

This is propaganda. Obviously. If you didn’t know that then you’re the one being targeted here.

UpliftingNews,ff7w854,t1_ff7v82k,1579659834.0,"> From that quote it's quite clear that to Obama, Trump represented the American dream

[According to snopes, that’s not necessarily true my dude. ](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-trump-american-dream/) It is, however adorable propaganda and goal post moving all in one. 

And what a surprise that you left out the rest of the quote to detach it from its context. 

> As an example of this line of thought, Obama and Fischer described what they called the “unfounded optimism of the average American” and used Donald Trump as an extreme caricature of what some people’s conception of upward mobility looked like, as summarized (with direct excerpts) by Garrow:

>The depth of this commitment [to personal liberty and opportunity] may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American — “I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don’t make it, my children will.” But “those of us on the political left” often forget “the degree to which coalition and consensus-building among the American electorate has necessarily preceded any major federal program to reform or restructure America’s economic and political landscape.”

>Therefore African Americans needed to understand how “the indiscriminate use of rights rhetoric in conventional political battles only adds fuel to the suspicion of the average white that all claims of right are nothing more than hypocritical attempts on the part of blacks to disguise their pluralist self-interest in the language of prophecy.” Thus “rights rhetoric will be effective to the extent that it conforms to the aspirations of a color-blind society,” and African Americans should grasp the pragmatic need for “a shift away from rights rhetoric and towards the language of opportunity.”
