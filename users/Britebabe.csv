depression,ff9u0ye,t3_erwrla,1579721282.0,"Religion has always existed and it endures because people need to believe in something, they want to believe in something existential in order to achieve some type of escape from their daily lives - from suffering, mundane existence, fear. Religion fits in with all of our instinctive coping mechanisms. That function is not Christianity specific. There were religions before Christianity and there will be ones after. There are people who believe in aliens, outside entities with powers, worlds beyond our own, etc. There are people who follow leaders or ideologies because it gives them hope or whatever they need to fill the void. And if you think about it, political parties much different than religion. They preach a set of beliefs, garner lots of followers, take money from those followers....

Theres no use in putting anyone down for their beliefs. The arc of history is pretty clear about religion. I for one would rather spend my time as the great philosophers did: searching for truth through understanding. In the case of depression that means understanding myself. I'm sure we can all agree on how hard a road this is. You do what you have to do to make it and for most of us that also means taking help wherever you can get it."

 All this racial shit has just gotten so out of hand that I'm on edge all the time, especially since I'm my NY, you can't get away from hearing about it. I worry about my goddaughter who is mixed and what she has will have to face in school and stuff. Shes 10 and just starting to really get to know the world, make an identity for herself..

My dad and godfather were involved in the civil rights movement in the 60s and they taught me principals that are just so drastically different from what I see being fed to younger people today. I guess thats why history is really important to me. It keeps you from believing the misguided opinions of random activists and politicians who are just trying to make a name for themselves at the expense of the uneducated.

unpopularopinion,ff4w831,t1_ff4mqnw,1579573934.0,"I'm sorry if I came across like a crazy person. I just guess something in your post got to me triggered. I've gotten grief all my life about race. Its hard when you're mixed. Especially within the past few years, its like you have to choose. Its especially frustrating when you work hard, I mean ax to the grindstone, sacrifice, etc, to then have your efforts and triumphs diminished because your skin is the wrong color.

Its nice to see I'm communicating with someone educated. Unfortunately you edited away the post containing the majority of what I was responding to.

1. Moors were black according to every painting I've ever seen of one. Honestly, I welcome if you could shed some light on why they would be depicted as black in artwork but not be black.
2. Puerto Rico isn't a nation. It never has been. It's a U.S. territory. All Puerto Ricans are American in nationality.
3. Never said my mom was brown. But you insinuated that indigenous blood was required to claim Puerto Rican decent, which is a popular misconception and one that I don't like.
4. I engaged because I feel kind of a way about the assumption that if you're European you are somehow part of a majority. Like there are no minorities in Europe or who can claim European descent and still be minorities. I say ""brown"" because there really isn't a place for people who are in between white and black. But one shouldn't be discounted just because they don't fit into one of those 2 brackets. I just get upset I guess when I see people speak about nationality, race, ethnicity interchangeably..."
unpopularopinion,ff4f013,t1_ff3tczd,1579562033.0,"If you aren't sure what you're debating why comment??? Its ethnicity vs race, culture vs skin color.

FYI, I'm Puerto Rican. I'm 2% black and 25% Arawak and I'm very schooled on my ancestry and history and pretty well on genetics, especially whare it concerns my bastardized race. Not fitting in anywhere kind of made it important for me to study these things and unlike some people I don't like to open my mouth without knowing what I'm talking about.

**Deep breath...**

Not all Puerto Ricans or any Hispanic/Latino have native ancestry. My moms dna is 100% European even though her family is all from PR for 200 hundred years. Also if you know about genetics then you know that the more tan you are as well as your ability to tan, the more melanin you have. It means you have black ancestry somewhere down the line even if its through Middle Eastern ancestors because their ancestors before them came from Africa and Asia. As you may or may not know, Spain was under Moorish rule for a long time. Moors were North African Muslims. They were black. So the fact that Antonio Banderas is swarthy is significant here. Thats genetics. Thats dna representation. I can't tan because of the ginger ancestors on my moms side, more genetics, specifically a defect in the MC1R gene - and please - if you need me to go into details I will gladly oblige. Or wait... maybe none of this matters because since I wasn't actually born in Puerto Rico I shouldn't be able to identify as one of them!!! 🤣 If Joaquin Phoenix who was born there can't do it why should I?? And I guess Lupita Nyong'o can't say she's Mexican either. 


TLDR:
Race politics is nonsense because the world is mixed. History will tell you that. It has no place when it comes to giving people awards based on their talents. The whole point of my post was to gauge if it really is a skin color thing or if cultural diversity factor into the criticisms I'm seeing???"

Because I will lay this out for those of you who didn't know; my boy Joaquin Phoenix is Puerto Rican just like Jennifer Lopez. So is it not ok for him - an actor who has always been an actor by profession - to be awarded for a spectacular performance vs JLo to win an award when acting isn't even her preffered artform??? Maybe the conversation would be different if JLo stopped spray tanning or if Joaquin would get some sun... Oh, (since apparently this is something I have to do now) btw, I'm of hispanic ethnicity and female.

depression,fezq9n0,t1_fewwn88,1579460293.0,"That's not true. You can't define depression by that one thing any more than you can define what a peak is. Sweeping generalizations like that don't hold water. They're logical fallacies.

Peaks are different for everyone. Somebody say theirs is having a kid or traveling the world and someone else's peak might be solving a rubiks cube (me)... Overwhelmingly, when you're depressed you're seeing things through your own extremely focused lens and there is a tendency to project that across the whole spectrum of life, but that's not reality. People are more complex than that. Sometimes a very simple thing can mean the world to a person.

I once had big goals and dreams for myself that were left unrealized but it dawned upon me that if I keep chasing after something I know I will never attain its just going to trap me at the bottom forever; the mere thought will continue to torment me until I die - something has to die: me or the dream. And why should I die??? Who's in control here??? I gave myself those aspirations so I have the power to change them. 

This realization has helped me start to move on, slowly, but after 10 years of living what you adequately call bullshit I finally feel something changing. Sometimes you have to bury the old and give yourself something new. I mean this literally too. I literally gave my old life a eulogy about a month ago. I had spiraled really bad. I felt something die in me. I felt like I would die, I should just die, but I don't want to die. This was my literal thought progression.  So I decided to mourn my past, things I lost, things I never would be able to have, parts of me that I knew were gone. I packed a box of stuff and gave it away, gave some things to family for their own memories and I'm going to burn the rest when I'm ready for the final goodbye. And this made me wonder, what if I could be reborn, what kind of person would I choose to be? If I had no past who could I be?  The answer is infinitely greater than the nothing I was desperately holding on to all those years.

Do I know what I want or who I want to be yet? Nope. A few things come to mind here and there and I write them down but the newness makes me feel something I've never felt before.  All I know for certain is that its better than what I had. In this life I think thats the most we can truly hope for: better. Not good, not bad, maybe different, but moving always toward something that can be better than what it was before.

  
I'll leave you with this:

TLDR: Just because you don't want to live, doesn't mean that you want to die - it just means you don't want your present life anymore. Its your mind, maybe even your soul, telling you that you need change. Yes, it's the end, but it could also be a beginning if you want it to be. Don't lose your power in this darkness my friend.

depression,felebx5,t1_fel405o,1579220173.0,"There are some pretty good threads aroumd here about bad parents. Worth a look at least for kicks. My dad is a selfish jerk too. Distancing myself from him is the only way I've been able to cope with some of the shit he put my siblings and my mom through and the only way I was able to heal my relationship with him years later. Sometimes space is healthy. 

See a guidance counselor if you can. If they feel your father is causing you emotional harm or hindering your health in another way they may be able to intervene. Schools have state laws that they have to abide by no matter what anyone says. Additionally you may be able to petition the court to not have to see your dad. I'm in NY and here if you are over 10 or 12 (can't remember precisely) you can tell the court you don't want to visit a parent anymore if you feel its hurting you or unsafe. Check your state laws to see if they have something like this.

You have rights and you deserve to be heard and be able to live feeling safe physically and emotionally. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 👑"

In my culture depression is laughable. Its and excuse to be weak and lazy. But i knew something was wrong and my mom did too and so she convinced me to go to therapy one day. Its been a journey and ive had to cut people out of my life who were not supportive emotionally or empathetic to my situation, but the negativity only makes it worse. Take your meds, go to therapy, find a support group if you can or even a church of some sort. I went to confession once just to vent and I'm not even catholic but the priest was really nice and talked me off the ledge. Keep looking for a way through this and eventurally you will find it."
depression,fel1igs,t3_eppt67,1579212033.0,"First off, this is how you know who your real friends (and family) are. I lost everything a few years ago after developing panic disorder and some other health problems that were brewing and since I neglected my health they got really bad... You're blessed to have gotten disability for mental health. Its pretty rare. I've been living on $180 a month, in limbo with disability for 4 years because they say I can work but my doctors say I can't... Living at my mom's secretly because I'm not on the lease. ✌

Also back to your shit fair weather friends, when I was about to get evicted way back when this started, my friend and her boyfriend who I didn't even know that well lent me 6k to pay off my back rent without batting an eyelash. They told me to pay it back when I could. No bitter feelings, no side eye, no shade. Thats friendship because sure, i dont have money, but when my friend is sick in the hospital I'm there with her, im there if she needs me to pick up her daughter from school, I'm there on the phone when she needs to vent.

Money comes and goes. I had money once, corporate money, and I shared because it came out of my heart to do so. What is it worth to have all the money in the world and see the people you care about be miserable??? It wasn't me and I think somehow God saw that or the universe or whatever, and the karma came back to me because I found a true ride or die friend and we share the belief that love is what really matters in life. Shes the only one who's been by my side all this time. 

Long story short, dont feel bad about losing people who aren't all the way there for you. Reciprocity and love are the foundation of any lasting relationship.

Also, hate saying this, but you've got to be more prudent with your money even if it means having to downgrade your living situation. Harsh truth and believe me when I say this isn't coming as a criticism. Obviously I don't know you like that to be able to judge, nor am I in any position to. I'm  merely speaking from experience. Budgeting is super important. It hurts now but helps a lot in the long run. Do some research, you can get a lot of great tips online.

Best of luck."
depression,fekyxu7,t3_epmseq,1579210503.0,"Come to NYC. By law we are obligated to shelter anyone in the city, the shelters aren't all together terrible, but it'll help you get into public housing faster. If you're on disability they give you priority too, I think like 1 year max waiting time last I checked. Theres also a lot or room-share here too which is what all the illegals do because its the cheapest way to live. You also get free medical, food stamps. So many benefits... I grew up in a poor neighborhood and my family helped a few homeless people get off their feet which is why I know this stuff. Ironically, I also almost ended up homeless myself after a health crisis. I lost almost everything but having access to some of the resources this city provides has been helping me slowly get my life back together. 

You've still got some fight left in you, I can see that. I know what its like to feel like you're done and spent. Cry today, give yourself the day to feel like sh*t, then regroup. Sell whatever you can replace on Craigslist, get enough for a bus or plane ticket. You've got to give yourself the chance that others haven't given you. You deserve it just as much as anyone else.

I think the sentimental component potentilly implied in this theory fits right in line with the wierd ways Rick displays affection. It could be a great way to add more depth to his character and his relationship with Morty or maybe use it to segway into what happened to Dianne...

depression,fc86awh,t3_egnm6h,1577527826.0,"Jesus..17? I've lost 3 but not all at once...I know that very few people will be able to relate, but here's all I got:

This is probably going to seem like the worst advice ever but it'll get you at least through the beginning of this, if it's fresh.

Lock the pain away. My mom used to work in the police department with abused children cases and one of the techniques they taught her to help deal with the horrible things she saw on the job was disassociation. She would always put her files away and clear her desk before leaving, and thus symbolically leaving her feeling about what she saw at work. She didn't take it home with her. Sometimes that's what we need to do to start moving on. 

You have survivors guilt. Everything you feel is normal. But right now your emotions and mind are in a frenzy. There isn't any logical thing you can do except distract yourself from thinking about what's happened. That will at least buy you a some time to re-center and figure out how you are going to get through this. Literally write down a plan for the next day or week or whatever, with steps and to just do things robotically.

That's how I've been able to overcome the absolute worst things I've had to deal with - planning my baby nephews funeral. This is the first time I've mentioned it in over 10 years. I didn't grieve for close to 6 months after it happened. Then I cried for 3 days. Its important when these things hit you to find a place where you can cry alone and just grieve. Miss them, remember the joy they brought you and you brought them, know that they aren't suffering anymore, that they may have been spared an even worse fate...

It might ultimately help to write letters to your friends when you are ready to say goodbye. It's weird but a lot of the cliche stuff is true - they would want you to live and live happily. You would honor them by doing that. It would be the best gift you could give them because they loved you.

You are doing the right thing by asking for help. If your school has a guidance counselor go to them. Hell, I would even talk to the school nurse if I had to. Sometimes there is even a church or something with youth counselors, not preaching religion here, but its a place to talk with people who may actually listen and have something positive to say to you. There are also help hotlines, many free ones where you can call and talk to counselors.

If you really want your parents attention, send them a few of these tragic reddit stories so they can see you aren't alone - this is a crisis amoung teens all over the world. If they love you, they'll listen. If not then you need outside help until you can get out on your own.

I don't know where you are but in the US if you need help and you go to a hospital and you are a minor they can not turn you away. They have to help you. Worst case scenario I would start calling doctors.

You matter. You are important to this world or else you wouldn't be here. You have a purpose even if you don't know what it is yet. If someone doesn't value you then you need to find and be with people who do.

Side note: Art is reflective of the artist; so saying that art can't be good or evil is like saying a person can't be good or evil. Clearly based on what you've witnessed thats simply not the case. Art is used to provoke thought and feeling so it can be used for good or evil. History proves that.

A close relative of mine was like that but with drug use and my family finally convinced her to see a doctor after a suicide attempt. They diagnosed her as bipolar with OCD and PTSD from childhood trauma. She's been on medication and seeing a psychiatrist for a few years and shes so different now. She's been off drugs and barely drinks for 5 years now. Only wish it would have happened earlier in her life so we could enjoy things the way we do now.

Your mom needs medical intervention. If you have to call the cops and they have to take her to a psych ward for a few days then that's what you have to do. It might be the only way to save her. 

Don't try doing it alone if you can help it. If there are people who care for her they will help you get her the proper medical attention and with things at home. You will burn out doing it alone.
