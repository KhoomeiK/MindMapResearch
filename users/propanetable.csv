solar,ff2zpsm,t1_ff2yceq,1579529728.0,"Yes. Strong winds will flip it over or blow it a significant distance. We don’t design for tornados we design for really strong winds. It’s a giant sail. There are some installs that have no concrete but those a driven very deep into the ground  with a pile driver. We use iron ridge racking. This is what their engineering designs for, to get an engineering stamp. 

60 mph winds can result in 15 pounds per square foot. You claim to have a 2200 lb structure. Each panel will have a 245 lbs of wind force on it (real rough math). 10 panels being effected may move your structure. 

When we do single pole mounts the holes are 3x6 at a minimum. 

I’ve seen people do wood or setting steel structures  but is isn’t good engineering g or safe.  That’s a big moving object. Not to mention the fact that a trailing wire could have 600 volts and the wire left could be back fed.

ILTrees,fdskoiq,t1_fdsc05o,1578704401.0,"If I recall from my read of the legislation. “Sealed, odor proof, reasonably secured container” 

I believe the “sealed” intends to be retail sealed. But it doesn’t say that. We will need a judge to rule on it at some point. Shouldn’t take long. 

It’s not really odor proof from the weed store so there’s that. 

Reasonably secure is fairly clear to me. 

I have friends who have gone to other states that the weed store told them that once they open the stapled bag they can’t transport it.  Then the law reads differently.  It’s in the stores best interest to keep tourists from acting out. 

This will all level out when there are cases that lead to precedent. 

I’ve read cops that wanna nail pot heads for dui so if they smell it it’s game on. (Don’t get me started on the dubious nature of the dui in the law). 

I’ve also read about cops opinion that if it’s under 28 they aren’t going to bother.

Maybe I am not understanding the situation. VA won’t prescribe. So they go to an outside doc with their records to get prescribed. Is that right. 

It would open up more docs to consider incorporating it to their practice and therefore a lower cost."
ILTrees,fdkfbqj,t1_fdkcv24,1578502664.0,"It’s still federally illegal. So those challenges exist either way. This would mean that vets who take advantage could still just go to a doc outside the VA. The standard of “bonafide patient physician relationship” is low. If a doctor advises someone between Tylenol and ibuprofen in Walmart They have legally established that relationship. 

Lots of facilities have  policy forbidding cannabis and will continue to. I imagine many facilities will retain that policy regardless of fda status. No different than no abortion policy. 

Pot practices are going to pop up regardless. It just makes it easier. But it’s not bad. The provider still has the responsibility to prescribe appropriately.  It is essentially what many providers are currently doing. It’s no different from any other specialty clinics. Weight loss clinics. Aesthetic practices. Suboxone providers. Those providers are responsible for their patients. 

Removing the list opens access and doesn’t hamstring a professionals decision on how to manage their patients condition.  

Read the transcripts of the board. They come off a uninformed. Using phrases as “some evidence” “wouldn’t the patient get the munchies” etc. it’s a flawed way of doing it. It makes it didficult to get a condition listed. I have bipolar disorder. It is a contraindication for pot. It helps me. The science isn’t right 100%. 

Wanting them to document symptoms they are trying to control or initial follow up etc seems like a reasonable approach to learn and follow.

Maybe some of the providers helping a few patients are comforted by the list as guidance. 

I managed a cash based out patient clinic. Some doc will want that business. Hire a mid-level to staff per volume. A nurse and a clerical worker should be all that is needed. That list severely limits the customer pool. I’m certain that if the condition list is removed someone in southern Illinois will open a near full time pot practice.
