food,fe5yq1g,t3_enw9lz,1578877915.0,"Some quick notes:
1) dried the scallops with paper towels
2) cooked in olive oil and a little butter
3) heated the stainless steel pan until the oil was hot and the butter was smoking a little
4) spaced out the scallops and tried not to move them much

Not shown:
- deglazed the pan with sake
- added more butter to make a sauce"

Here’s what one of his high school classmates remembers about him:


“In my senior year the school district held a multi-day community meeting and, for some reason, Stephen Miller was there. People were describing their experiences, how hard it is to be an immigrant. And Stephen stood up and said, “Well, my grandparents were immigrants and they got no help and they became wealthy, so there is no reason for any immigrant to complain.” He added nothing constructive. It seemed like he wanted people to hate him.”
