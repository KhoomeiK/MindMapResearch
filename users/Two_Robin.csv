Allegedly the more episodes you have the more you're likely to have in the future?  So there's that.  We have a tiger by the tail, or a dynamite fuse in our hands, or some elegant metaphor I can't think of now, but the point is manage it and keep it managed, because once it goes wild it just doesn't stop."

You can go along in remission for months or years without an episode until suddenly you don't, and everything you built gets trashed.  Take the meds.  Figure out the ones that are going to work for you for life and get comfortable with them.  I wish someone could have convinced me of this when I was in my early 20's."

bipolar,fexjin9,t3_equffp,1579432004.0,There's no way for us internet people to know.  Can you get up with a guidance counselor or nurse at your school and talk to them about stuff?  (For the nurse the reason would be the weird weight loss.)  They can explain to you if and how to get referred to whatever mental health is available to you and how it's funded.  Good luck!

I find it prevents me from doing the 24/7 depression napping and I tend to wake up (boing) at 8 hours, although I did sleep for 12 last night...going to bed with the sun.  I feel a sense of competence and occasionally optimism, and am working on various life-problems that have had me completely freaked out (unemployment since Labor Day, for example, trying to keep my apartment plus sudden death of my younger brother).  Overall as a med I give lamotrigine positive review and would recommend.  I'm also taking Invega Sustenna injections plus propranolol for tremor and clonazepam for sleep/anxiety."

As far as people who believe you can cure illness with prayer I have no idea, but it's possible she has her own group(s) or pastor to discuss such things with who may actually put an additional nudge on -- that's out of your control.
