I actually have a mild form of OCD, which is being absolutely obsessed with everything being a perfect square aka everything has to equal 4 or I get anxiety.  I also have high functioning GAD (general anxiety) which often causes me to be irritable and constantly over plan things down to the tiniest detail, which also causes more anxiety and more obsessive behaviors.

Not liking something because it isn’t in order is not OCD and it’s aggravating to see people still acting like OCD is some kind of personality quirk in 2020. 

I only have obsessive related OCD behaviors and it hinders my life I absolutely could not imagine moderate to severe OCD. I also couldn’t imagine using OCD in context like that."

You have to spend an additional $1000+ on buying additional meal credits depending on if you eat two or three meals a day.

Then try to figure out your undertone. Do you look pink or red? Do you look yellow or golden? Do you look like neither, or are you olive looking? Stare in the mirror.

You can use calculators etc but your own eyes are going to be more accurate. If you don’t know any of this information I highly doubt whatever you’re using now for foundation or concealer is a good match, no offense.

Look at your veins, are they blue, green, or blue green, or even purple?

What color jewelry do you look best in? Silver, gold, or both?

You could also go into a Sephora or ulta and test a few different concealers and foundations.

Test concealer on the inside of your arm, and foundation on your chest since some women’s neck are darker or lighter than the rest of their body naturally.  If your chest is abnormally light or dark, obviously don’t do that and match to your face and neck only.

I wouldn’t ask an employee for help, the lighting is usually pretty crap in the stores, and you’ll want to see it all in sunlight with a camera once it dries down. Just  remember the color names and brand."

ApplyingToCollege,feyabpw,t3_eqtmzq,1579442925.0,"Yes. I remember the first time we were asked what do you want to be when you grow up. It was 1st grade and I wrote that I wanted to be a fashion designer, a business owner, a teacher, AND a mom.

In a way I’m still going to accomplish all of those things. My partner and I are interested in fostering/adopting once were done with school and financially stable.  I’m learning to sew currently (I used to know how as a child but forgot)  and I like making little pieces to wear here and there.  I’m also going into science education (specifically environmental science if I teach high school) fall 2020.

My partner is going to trade school. He already has the skill, just wants the qualifications. We’d be joint owners with renovations. He does all the heavy work and I deal with everything else. Things might change for him later and we might do our ideal business plan if things pan out correctly, but the renovation/carpentry business is our safety business.  If the other plan isn’t an option we have that to rely on and he’ll do well.  His older bro is looking to retire soon and will give him the company if he does his qualifications. 

These things never really changed for me. At times I focused on only one thing, but it was always one of those things. I found my love for teaching in middle school thanks to my amazing orchestra teacher and science teacher.  They went above and beyond  and I’m really grateful for being one of their students."

Regardless of if the next blood palette is green, purple, orange, etc, I’m not buying right away. Now let me explain- in theory it sounds amazing and I want it, but I already have 6 palettes I need to use, and has a makeup newbie I’m not really into those kind of colors yet. If there was a more neutral palette or all singles in the near future, that’s what I’m going for.

When it comes to mystery boxes... I’m 100% buying every single one he releases. Is there issues with most of them? Absolutely, but you have to realize no matter what is in the box, you are getting an amazing deal. That’s why I always shoot to go for every size of box when he does mystery boxes. You’re getting a huge discount with the boxes regardless of any issues, and that’s why I purchase them. I’m also more inclined to purchase limited edition items even if there’s issues.  I actually use all limited edition items, and if it’s not a fit for my skin tone, you can always just trade with someone for something that is, or sell it. You really can’t lose with these boxes. I’ve kept almost every item from MB except a few highlighters that just would never look good on me.  Metal straws? I love them and use them daily. Pop sockets? Not so much but I have replacement for when mine breaks! Stickers? Not at all but I’ll put it in a picture frame.

Give him a plant milk if you feel he absolutely needs milk.  Cows milk doesn’t even actually provide us with nutrients we need, they have to blend it into the milk. 

Expand his diet with good for him foods, more vegetables, less junk, and less sugar. Add fruits and seeds that help with digestion, such as flax seeds, chia seeds, prunes,  **real** apple juice (the dark kind not the light piss color or yellow kind) raisins etc.


karo syrup also helps, start out with 1-2 teaspoons and adjust how much based on its effectiveness. Mix it into a drink.

I hate tipping the shitty server who said hi in annoying tone and never once checked up, but I feel like an ass if I don’t.

Or at the very least pay servers minimum wage and then have tips be optional again. Then I’d happily tip the good servers and not tip the awful ones. Maybe they’d be inclined to actually be a better server.

It’s HARD as fuck, it’s STILL hard but we’re committed to making the marriage last and we’re currently going through a rebirth stage and going slow. We’re falling back in love with each other and at times it feels like the first time all over again, except we have bills."
ZeroWaste,fdzr295,t1_fdzqhr0,1578793844.0,"If you’re moving out of your parents place for the first time, you don’t have anything. Or say you’re homeless or whatever the circumstances are. If you don’t have anything, then it’s much better to buy quality reusable cutlery off the bat. If you already have things and then decide to go zero waste and throw out all the things that aren’t zero waste, or buy zero waste items of the things you already have, you’re doing the opposite of zero waste. I mean how hard is that to get? 

There’s nothing wrong with getting a sturdy metal cutlery set or even bamboo that’s going to last you a while IF you don’t already have cutlery. And buying them doesn’t mean they have to be brand new either. 

That’s the entire point. 

When it comes to ANYTHING zero waste, if you do **not** already have the item, it’s much better to buy the zero waste item. If you already have the item, you need to reuse what you have all that you can, then recycle if you cannot reuse anymore, and then buy the zero waste options, instead of just throwing away what you have and “starting new” with zero waste."
jeffreestarcosmetics,fdzdvre,t1_fdzdi4d,1578789328.0,"That’s my point, they’ve been together for the entirety of JSC. If he disliked it that much I feel like he would have left much sooner, or maybe he honestly tried hard to compromise and deal with it and just couldn’t anymore. Regardless of any of that, it’s still hard to believe. Not that they’re lying or I think it’s fake, that their relationship seemed SO strong, I always felt like it would have to be a huge cheating scandal or abuse for them to split."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdzd9wm,t1_fdxvbp3,1578789111.0,It seems like a mutual agreement. They happen sometimes.

it wasn’t easy for us and we’re still healing but we’ve been able to break the toxic cycle and we’re still on the road of recovery. We had to learn to love ourselves first and then fall back in love with each other. We were unhappy together because we were unhappy with ourselves.

So believe in yourselves because the hard work will pay off in the end if you want it to."
jeffreestarcosmetics,fdyzc4n,t1_fdyyyhr,1578785111.0,They got some of them together. Davinci is the latest one.
ApplyingToCollege,fdyfcc3,t1_fdybn9h,1578779140.0,I haven’t tried emailing them since it takes longer to get a response but I might do that.
ApplyingToCollege,fdyb1fw,t1_fdyazqg,1578777902.0,I have and they aren’t helpful. The lady on the phone basically said nothing the entire time.
ZeroWaste,fdxnyib,t1_fdxnb42,1578771065.0,Where in my short comment did I say that? Yeah I didn’t.  Thrift stores literally aren’t a thing here. Better to get the right thing off the bat if you start off with nothing. Whoever said I was buying a $13 set? Like your comment is just dumb.

We would hope on moving someplace new to fix things and think that the new energy and scenery would help. It never did, and we had to go to counseling to finally get things back on track."

jeffreestarcosmetics,fdwz11o,t3_ena5rb,1578763710.0,"I’m not even in the relationship and it just doesn’t feel real. My heart is hurting for the both of them. I’m crying for the both of them because it hurts so much.

Jeffree didn’t really go into detail and it’s hard to believe such a strong relationship ended just because he didn’t want to be in the spotlight but I respect that and I know we’re not entitled to everything, but I truly hope the rumors of cheating are not true.

In the last video they did together I could see that Nathan was more off than usual in the video and I was worried about their relationship then because he just seemed so unhappy to be there and more quiet than usual. 

I just hope that 2020 can be a better year for the both of them, they went through so much in 2019 and they just deserve a break for once."

jeffreestarcosmetics,fdt0nqn,t1_fdqigic,1578710394.0,The clip people were spreading on twitch nate’s brother said that he doesn’t know what’s going on and the and Nate is fine. People were drawing to conclusions it must be the mom then but I don’t recall seeing or hearing him say his mom died.
