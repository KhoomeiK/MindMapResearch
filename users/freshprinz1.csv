And abolishing private property has so many negative effects, how do you want to motivate people to form start ups? How do you foster a healthy competition that enables technological development?

Just imagine that this conversation we are having wouldn't be possible under any communist regime. 

I think a solution would be something like we have in Germany called ""social market economy"", which means that there is a free market and capitalism but with strong regulations, protection of employees/workers, a strong social security net to fall back on, and many more. 

The problem is that in a globalised world (which I think is good, I'm not some kind of isolationist), these strong protection methods seem to be a disadvantage in global market competition. And ironically we are competing not so much with other European states or first world countries, but with developing countries.

So any solution needs to be a global one where all states are on board, so that if certain states enact reforms for more equality they don't get disadvantaged."
