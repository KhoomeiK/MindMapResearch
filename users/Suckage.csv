Compared to lvl 9, your 13 Kensai will have:    
+4 to save vs death and +5 vs breath    
2 attacks per round, instead of 3/2    
another weapon spec (offsets the one you lose from not reaching mage 30)    
+5 THAC0 (4 from fighter, 1 Kensai)    
+1 to damage    
-1 speed factor

> 20th level: Perfect Self. The monk has tuned his body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that he becomes a magical creature. He/she is forevermore treated as an outsider (extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect the monk. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 20/+1. This means that the monk ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with +1 enhancement bonus (or greater), by a spell or by a form of energy (cold, fire, etc.). As an outsider, a 20th level monk is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from law.

A level 20 Monk is nearly immune to non magical weapons because he now exists (at least partially) on a different plane of existence. 

But he’s not actually immune. He still gets cut by your sword, only for you to watch in horror as, faster than you can deliver them, his wounds knit themselves back together.

The same is true of Demons and Devils, who come from the Abyss and Hells respectively. Also, when you “kill” one of these on the Prime Material Plane, they are usually just banished back to their own Plane. You’re really just destroying a manifestation of them on your plane of existence."
baldursgate,fc02f7x,t3_efdwow,1577275138.0,"The first time you come across enemies immune to magical weapons, there is a book by Elminster that tells you about them and other creatures in the area. With the exception of mages casting protections.

You are warned about Aec’Letec and his death gaze more than once. They don’t spell out what you can use to defend against it, but “gaze” is a pretty big hint.

If your ~~melee~~ characters don’t have +3 or better weapons by the end of SoA, then you skipped a lot of side quests and loot. I’m not saying you have to get Carsomyr during Chapter 2, but there’s no reason to not have Flail of Ages +3, Lilarcor +3, and Daystar +4 before starting Ch. 4

The only valid complaint regarding this would be if you invested weapon proficiencies poorly or kept sub-par weapons for RP reasons."
