When he stops trying to get it of you can swap it wit a collar that breaks and gradually let him have it longer. And don't forget to add bell to it.

technology,fcmxy7x,t1_fcmx9kp,1577797083.0,"I agree, I use ad blocker to. My initial comment was just ment to compare it to pirate copying as a replay to some that did not like pirate copying. I think ad blocker is worse than pirate copying, atleast for movies and TV shows."
technology,fcmww2f,t1_fcmv0e7,1577795900.0,"Advertiser pay for the chance that you see it and to hopefully make you remember them when you want to buy something related. They get what they pay for as long as the ad is visible. Site owners on the other hand has nothing to gain from visitors that use ad blocker, in fact they directly loose money from those visitors. I totalt understand why some pages block me when I use ad blocker. As long as ther ads are not toxic then I keep them whitelisted."
technology,fcmkoxn,t1_fcmeh03,1577779272.0,Using adblocker is worse. Using it you still use bandwidth and server time that the site owner had to pay for without getting anny income from you. You are directly stealing resources. Pirating is not as bad. If pirating was not an option and I could not get it on the services I choose to use then I would just not see the movie. So by pirating they lose nothing.
