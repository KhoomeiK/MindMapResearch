AppleWatch,fd9fplp,t1_fd8xri8,1578232697.0,"En EE.UU hay pocos contactless comparado con España y por eso buscan el simbolito de Apple Pay, pero aquí en España prácticamente todos son contactless desde hace años, no recuerdo la última vez que tuve que insertar la tarjetita 😂 Disfruta, es súper cómodo. Las primeras veces te da cosa, pero luego te da igual jeje. Yo he pagado en bares, pueblos... en cualquier sitio con datáfono."
AppleWatch,fd8rdvc,t1_fd5a2t3,1578222295.0,"In Spain you can pay anywhere with Apple Pay because every “datáfono” is contactless. I payed in small towns, no problem at all. Message me if you have any doubts, I’m Spanish. I usually use Apple Pay on my phone, though, to not get weird looks using my watch. I just say “I want to pay with a card” and when they offer me their paying machine I put my iPhone."
