Some people hate anything that's popular. Even though often what's popular is that way because it's the best. They exist in every hobby."
trashy,ff1yzq3,t1_ff01oln,1579489450.0,This but unironically.  If you let the government take little things they'll take more and more until you realize you're out of freedoms
MensLib,ff00d3j,t1_feusiqj,1579463795.0,Well I'm glad you got to make that decision for yourself. At 33.
MensLib,ff0077q,t3_eqm88i,1579463720.0,"Wow mods, great way to allow productive conversation. No discussion of how archaic ideas lead to fucked up practices. Criticism of the practices of a religion isn't the same as bigotry toward members of it. If Islam leads to practices like stoning women accused of adultery are we allowed to criticize it then? Or are Muslims more oppressed than muslim women, and therefore you somehow think criticizing their religion is worse than allowing women to be stoned?

No discussion of fgm. Why? Because it might actually force some people to have empathy for the baby boys whose penises we mutilate? 

Won't even allow responses to your comments anymore. 

Fuck you, ban me. I don't give a shit. Have fun in your echo chamber."
TumblrInAction,fezl7r6,t1_feyf8ox,1579458524.0,DING DING DING! It's not because they're offended someone offered advice. It's because they see white men as the other. Because all cults needs an outsider

trashy,fezetpp,t1_fey538q,1579456579.0,Are you being sarcastic? Or do you hate freedom?
wholesomememes,fepvnsa,t1_fe6jlpu,1579332956.0,"Yeah I guess you're right. It's just unfortunate that wholesome is somehow synonymous with ""don't tell me anything that challenges me, even if I need to hear it"""
gifs,fem7ry4,t1_felcqqo,1579242827.0,"This is somewhat debatable. If you're sure you wanna stick with the hobby, yeah upgrade. But those goggles and controller are apparently decent, so you could buy the rtf kit and then upgrade a little further down the line if you stick with it"

wholesomememes,fe46mx0,t3_enow87,1578856250.0,"Sometimes being ashamed of yourself is necessary. Like when you do something wrong. Like treating your body like shit and letting it decompose, for example. That's actually a behavior one should be ashamed of. Not all negative emotion is something to be distrusted and expunged from oneself. Often it's actually your subconscious trying to tell you something. You should listen to it."
wholesomememes,fe45ta9,t1_fe30dbx,1578856097.0,"Not every once in a while. Minimum 3 times a week. And this also includes taking an honest stock of where you're at. Plenty of people are overweight or obese but go ""Well I eat healthy and work out, so I'm good"" when in reality they eat like shit but have an apple every couple days, and go for a walk once a week. 

If you're overweight, you're doing something wrong (save for a very select few cases of medical anomalies). It's not okay to treat your body like shit."
sex,fe3x4ds,t1_fe3nq2q,1578853641.0,"Or expecting people to act like adults? Relationships require communication. Everybody has behaviors that their so isn't going to like, if you want any relationship to work you have to talk about your issues, not just leave the relationship at the first sign of dissatisfaction. Jesus fucking Christ."

AskReddit,fdiz7hc,t3_elgpmo,1578454445.0,"Same way I feel about most any mandatory thing. I'm a fucking adult. It shouldn't be up to the government to manage my mental health.

PublicFreakout,fdbdlqg,t1_fdb2orc,1578256345.0,You don't understand. It's not facism if people I agree with are in charge. /s
PublicFreakout,fdbddw3,t1_fdb2q9k,1578256263.0,"Honestly you joke, but this seems not to far off from reality. I won't be surprised if this becomes a thing. Or like ""Anti-Sexual-Assault"" but it's really roving bands of bright haired feminists who troll the streets castrating men."
PublicFreakout,fdbcv4j,t1_fdb1sfk,1578256128.0,"This. I bet everyone who thinks antifa just means anti fascism would really have loved that logic back when people were debating the merits of the Patriot act. ""What, so are you saying you're not a patriot?!"""

dankmemes,fd6x7d0,t3_ek2vj5,1578196844.0,Also people have nice cars are honestly more likely than the average person to want other nice cars. Because they're into cars.
HumansAreMetal,fd6uczp,t1_fctlp2l,1578195825.0,I agree. It's basically fetishization to act like they're all perfect babies

Whatcouldgowrong,fc1do0g,t1_fc0e1zq,1577315645.0,"Yeah except that's still hyperbole. The truth is nobody can claim to know what the cutoff is. Climate is really complicated, and anybody who claims to predict it enough to make definitive claims like ""2030 is the year"" is lying to you.

We know what we're doing is bad, we know we need to do better. We definitely don't know that as of 2030 we're going to start going extinct"
