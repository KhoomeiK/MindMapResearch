MakeNewFriendsHere,fcxcaxj,t1_fcnvi8o,1578059000.0,"Thanks for all your replies. I appreciate them. 
Hope you‚Äôre fine, take care x"
depression,fcmyy9u,t1_fcmy3bu,1577798152.0,"It does suck. 
Nothing what makes you feel better is weird. Do anything what brings peace. Maybe working on yourself will finally give some results. 
I‚Äôm after a conversation with psychotherapist and I feel a little better but thoughts about this next year scare me. But hopefully it‚Äôll be a better one for all of us here x"
depression,fcmxjke,t1_fcmtrss,1577796636.0,Well we never know what future brings.. try to believe 2020 won‚Äôt be as bad as 2019.
depression,fcmtpez,t3_ei1phe,1577791784.0,Take it all day by day. Maybe 2020 will be different even tho it doesn‚Äôt feel like it now.
depression,fcmtmqm,t3_ei1osv,1577791683.0,"Maybe try to talk to them and tell about your true feelings and intentions. Everyone should have another chance. 
And you definitely shouldn‚Äôt end things. Take care x"
depression,fcmtgmf,t3_ei1nb3,1577791448.0,"I can totally relate. 
But still I don‚Äôt know what to say. Maybe try to relax, to spend some time focusing on breathing, silencing your mind.. 
And take it day by day, step by step. 
What happens in your mind doesn‚Äôt always define your true self. And you‚Äôre much more than your wrong, uncontrolled thoughts. 
Maybe more positivity will come soon. 
Wish you all the best in 2020. Take care of yourself x"
depression,fcmt7hv,t3_ei1ivs,1577791094.0,"I feel the same. I used to be a different person, better person. I turned into someone who I don‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt love, can‚Äôt understand...
And I feel like giving up. Because I see no way out of the situation, no future. 
But maybe 2020 is right time to ask for a professional help?
Take care xx"
therapy,fcmszgb,t1_fck1330,1577790778.0,"Thanks x
Maybe it‚Äôs possible to deal with such things on our own but if so I think it never goes away, we only make it less painful but it comes back eventually. Maybe therapy helps to stop it from coming back.."
therapy,fcmstnf,t1_fck1y3d,1577790552.0,Thank you x

therapy,fcjreid,t1_fcjpd49,1577700840.0,"Still didn‚Äôt cancel it so hopefully I‚Äôll do it. Asking for help is terrible. 
Thank you so much, take care x"
depression,fcjrcot,t1_fcjpks1,1577700766.0,"Okay, thank you. I thought it‚Äôs just me but it‚Äôs kinda good to know other people feel it as well. But I wish all the best for you x"
depression,fcjr9ru,t1_fcjnhw8,1577700646.0,"Thank you so much. This helped me a lot. 
Take care xx"
depression,fc69cdt,t1_fc626up,1577475265.0,"Thank you for stopping by. 
I totally get what you mean and it‚Äôs the worst feeling when thing that used to make you the happiest suddenly stops and means almost nothing. Or still means a lot but it‚Äôs you who can enjoy it anymore so it‚Äôs even more difficult. 
But I hope you‚Äôll be able to enjoy the other thing. Take care buddy."
depression,fc691d4,t1_fc5z196,1577475064.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your honest words. I appreciate it. 
From what you wrote I‚Äôd say that the best way is to find little things and just be happy about them. Someone once said that if little things don‚Äôt make a person happy then big ones never will. I guess that‚Äôs true. 
And about this hiding thing.. sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs the worst thing. I do this a lot too. That‚Äôs probably why I feel like I am playing a role. But I think sometimes it‚Äôs the best way. 
 I truly hope you‚Äôll be fine. Take care of yourself and try to talk to someone about your feelings. Thank you x"
depression,fc68a6v,t1_fc5yvp6,1577474566.0,"It does make sense. It truly does. 
It‚Äôs just difficult to start living after feeling dead for so long. But everything takes time so hopefully one day it‚Äôll all change for good.
Thanks for stopping by and saying all these words. I really appreciate it."
depression,fc5y2i3,t1_fc5vt72,1577468276.0,"100% me. 
It‚Äôs exhausting and it feels like there‚Äôs no way out."
depression,fc5xwbr,t1_fc5qrtf,1577468185.0,doing anything is better than nothing. it‚Äôs just impossible to find motivation or to enjoy things. ughh
depression,fc5jicw,t3_egc4v4,1577459307.0,Can relate. Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the answer either.
depression,fc5ja3y,t3_egc0kq,1577459131.0,"Omg I‚Äôve just read it and I feel like crying cause I‚Äôd be able to say that I feel exactly the same. 
Sometimes I have these thoughts.. like what the fuck am I doin.. I just have to take care of myself and start living because I want to and I want to be a happy, successful person. And then I‚Äôm totally broken because I feel like I only want to hide somewhere, disappear or do  completely nothing. 
It‚Äôs fuckin difficult to describe. It‚Äôs even worse to feel... I wish I could understand."
mentalhealth,fc3h335,t1_fc35p96,1577389651.0,I think so. I used to say a lot when we were in touch. He said he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me in any way and that it‚Äôs better not to stay in touch while he still lives abroad.
mentalhealth,fbx9nnb,t1_fbx8pa1,1577175801.0,"it‚Äôs Christmas so I‚Äôm gonna do my best. hopefully it‚Äôll be enough. thanks for asking, it‚Äôs so nice ü§ç have a great day!!"
mentalhealth,fbx9kno,t1_fbwg4fq,1577175681.0,Truth!!
mentalhealth,fbvg1f4,t1_fbv9t7e,1577130275.0,"Well it‚Äôs difficult I guess. Because that‚Äôs probably the first thing we do out of habit. 
And it‚Äôs not wrong but I started thinking that there‚Äôre other options which may be better. So I think we should just decide what to do according to a situation. 
Thanks for your comment x"
