bipolar,fdna4pi,t3_em7qwf,1578581284.0,"My child makes me a stronger, better person, and I am a good mother to her.

Do you think that, if you could test for bipolar in the womb, all positive results should be aborted?  If not, why shouldn’t someone with bipolar have kids?  

A bipolar life is still worth living."
tarot,fcm2yzc,t3_ehwmwx,1577762881.0,"Make up stories.  Imagine you’re reading for someone who’s choosing between two mates, or wants to change careers, or has a big event coming up. The more detailed the better!"

therapy,fcbr5zz,t3_eh07x0,1577590061.0,"If you’re honest with yourself and them it will be helpful, because you’ll be better equipped to explain your symptoms to them.  I didn’t realize some of my manic symptoms like pressured writing were even relevant until I read about them.

Sure, you could make things up but who would that be hurting but you?"
astrology,fc72866,t3_egi7qf,1577495586.0,What about all the official Essex and Middlesex county websites? They must have problems too...

bipolar,fbyihkp,t3_ef6509,1577217728.0,"Honestly I think there is no thing as both BD and BPD—it happens when either a) they’re not sure about the bipolar, or b) bipolar and PTSD, particularly developmental/complex PTSD copresent.

I kinda think BPD is a bullshit diagnosis though.  It’s a collection of symptoms which can have very different causes in different people."
