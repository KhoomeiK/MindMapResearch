careerguidance,ff0hkzi,t1_fezx00z,1579468916.0,"Thank you.  Going out of your way to clean the bathrooms is a level of initiative that most people wouldn’t even consider.  From what I’ve learned in job-searching is that experience combined with database query/CRM skills is more desirable than most degrees.  SQL, Salesforce, and any of the other required hard skills that you see on many job listings and can be self-taught seem like they can only help."

GriefSupport,fepi0ph,t1_fepfd8v,1579321012.0,My younger brother passed away nine years ago next month.  You absolutely summed it up about adjusting to the pain and loss.  Best wishes to you and your family in commemorating another milestone.
GriefSupport,feph7b4,t3_eptayi,1579320410.0,"I'm sorry for your loss.  I lost my younger brother suddenly 9 years ago when he was 19 years old.  I didn't have it in me to say any words at his funeral or burial service, so unfortunately I can't give you any advice from experience.  If it gets too hard to put the words together, it might be a nice idea just to find something heartfelt to read like a passage from an author or poet he appreciated or lyrics from one of his favorite musicians.  You don't have to put too much pressure on yourself; without a doubt everyone there will be extremely understanding and supportive."
GriefSupport,fepgfy1,t3_eq2eyu,1579319867.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss.  My younger brother passed away in his sleep unexpectedly at the age of 19 almost 9 years ago.  I came to this sub for the first time because I was suddenly really missing him.  Your post brought back some memories and tears.  

Unfortunately there's no way of ever making it fair.  There's no way that the world feels as whole as it once was.  But the pain does become manageable and life becomes more livable eventually.  It could be a year, it could be more; as they say, there is no timeline for grief.  And at some point you will be able to live your life functionally and pursue things that make you happy as your brother would want you to do.  Be easy on yourself in the meantime and know that you are enduring a sudden loss that most people cannot begin to imagine.  

My sincere condolences (I know those last three words probably don't mean anything as you've heard them countless times over the past few weeks and have realized that no words can do justice to such a life-changing tragedy, but if nothing else it's a simple reminder that other people care for your existence in this world)."
recruitinghell,fepdcux,t3_eplx47,1579317731.0,"It sucks, but I wouldn't take this rejection personally.  They liked what they saw in your resume enough to schedule an interview.  The fact that they didn't follow through with it means there's no way that they could be critical of any new information you would've provided beyond the application stage.  Seems to me like it's just poor planning on their part on top of the lack of decency employers have towards applicants whom they conveniently forget are real people."
careerguidance,fep4qm1,t1_fep1zsq,1579312096.0,"I just submitted my resume to a temp agency for the first time today.  I've been extensively unemployed after finishing graduate school, and this seemed like a good option especially considering that a large cross country move in 3-4 months is very possible.

If you don't mind me asking, how did you initiate your work with whatever temp agency placed you?  Did you make contact with just one or many?"
technology,feo46ji,t1_feo0a0f,1579294917.0,"The political establishment not caring about people who don’t vote is either a monumental misstep or a method for serving their own agenda, I’m not sure which.  When you consider that 66 million people voted for Hillary, 63 million voted for Trump, and 100 million didn’t vote at all, it becomes very obvious that mobilizing only a fraction of non-voters could totally shake up an election (sure, the electoral college will determine it at the end of the day, but assume that some of the 100 million non-voters are at least somewhat distributed across state lines).

The whole mainstream perspective that you see in cable news of “voters” favoring certain establishment candidates or being apprehensive about progressive proposals totally ignores who potential voters are.  It’s almost like they and the party leaders are content with non-voters staying home on Election Day."
