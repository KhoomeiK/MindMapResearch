He did have a companion who had died just two months before so maybe he was lonely. Also they are Persians and are pretty laid back so that could have been part of it, not sure really, anyone else have experience introducing Persians?"

I have also taken it a few times and found it helped me too, it makes you feel calm. Here's an article that talks about it .

Anxiety,fexwrbf,t3_eqo9mv,1579437729.0,"Don't let the fear of failure hold you back, accept that you may fail and tell yourself that you are alright with that, after all creative writing may not be your thing. Failing at something is not a bad thing at all but you won't find your thing unless you do try new things. On the other hand you are eighteen and you have plenty of time to find what you love. Maybe you could start with something that you could do at home in a comfortable setting, for example I am learning how to paint from YouTube videos, maybe look up some creative writing videos and try a small project at home, it may give you confidence to go further."
Anxiety,fexvtzz,t3_eqtwpc,1579437290.0,"I'm not sure I understand exactly what you are trying to say but if your compulsions are increasing and scaring you it is time to get medical help from a professional if at all possible. Wish I could help you but as I said I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Am I right in thinking that you disobeyed a compulsion and it made things worse, as in the compulsions got stronger? Do you have a spiritual leader? If so please visit them and ask for help from them as well."

Persians are people cats and love nothing more than being near their people. I agree with the eye wiping, but be gentle and use a seperate pad for both eyes and make sure you dry them as they can get infections in the folds. Also try to see if she will let you brush her teeth as they can have decay problems. Wishing you a happy journey with your beautiful baby!"
