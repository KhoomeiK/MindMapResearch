Meditation,fe62102,t3_enwnld,1578880012.0,"The spot between the eyebrows/third eye point is common. The general area of the heart is common in yoga, though I find that uncomfortable/anxiety provoking. The lower dantien (roughly 2 inches below the navel, center-mass of the abdomen) is common in Chinese meditation and is my preferred focal point.

The breath is common, of course, and is typically tied to the other points when they are used, because it will tend to distract you otherwise.

Some people light incense sticks and focus on the ember, but that has a short timeline, obviously. Visual points of focus are sort of problematic as the deeper you focus, the less reliable your sense of sight becomes.

Japanese yogis/practitioners of shin shin toitsu do are known to focus on a gong or singing bowl as it fades into nothingness, and then sort of continue following that point of focus into silence as long as they can. This is similar to mantra meditation, where you essentially do the same with a phrase you repeat.

My preference is for sensations, but I think the key is mainly in letting go of any thoughts or sensations that arise as you practice... It's typical to go, ""Oh, that was cool! Can I keep that going?"" Or the opposite, ""That felt bad, or was scary, I should avoid that..."" But it's all just some fragment of yourself trying to distract you from being increasingly single-minded, which is the goal.

What you focus on and how, matters a lot less than the cycle of acknowledgement, and letting go, over and over, that arises as you focus."
Meditation,fe5lx83,t3_ensi2o,1578871127.0,"Becoming more aware almost invariably makes things worse at first, unless your life is truly blessed. That's why mindfulness is a bit of a two edged sword and kinda the training wheels version of meditation. The next step is letting go of all phenomena as they occur to you.

At first this feels like you're simply fleeing reality, and your are in a way, but the rabbit hole goes way deeper than that. For one, you're training your mind not to ""grasp"" automatically anymore--to stop latching onto ideas and feelkngs automatically at a deep level... 

Over time, this gives you a kind of freedom, as well as the understanding to use it. Almost immediately you begin to feel better though, as your mind let's go of the thoughts and feelings that occur during meditation. Beware of feeling good, when that happens though. Feelings and thoughts that occur to you by accident in meditation must be let go of, because they're meant to be distractions from the unifying work you're doing to yourself."

Meditation,fdczx6s,t3_ekmqih,1578289419.0,"...i didn't read you properly when I commented the first time. It either sounds like a hypnogogic effect from part of your brain literally going to sleep, or a blood circulation problem, which is sort of troubling... I leave it to you to decide which, but if you think it's a circulation problem, I'd see a doctor.

If you think it's more hypnogogic, I wouldn't worry too much. These things can happen as we explore meditation and try things. Sometimes holding your hands in a mudra representing your intention to avoid this problem and maintain balance can be enough to stop it."

Meditation,fcnu5v9,t1_fcn3v2u,1577818476.0,"What most people say in here is probably good advice, sitting (or laying if you have to) and following the breath GENTLY... The hard part is understanding that you’re not trying to make something change in the moment, you’re trying to acknowledge but set aside every change that occurs. People get into meditation looking for something, and that’s fine, but if you’re sitting and something changes (a feeling, a vision, good or bad) and you’re paying attention to that and trying to keep it going, you’re doing it wrong.

Let it go, keep doing what you’re doing. That’s the right way. If it doesn’t feel right, change it a little until it’s comfortable. Your intuition will prod you in the right direction."
Meditation,fcmhzqy,t3_ehu393,1577776027.0,"In general, meditating with too much 'force' will make things worse. It certainly did for me.

The key is to be gentle and receptive, and as others have said here, observe passively all the phenomena that arise, acknowledge, and let it go. I like to gently take a point of focus, like the breath, and instead of holding it, let it hold me, shift as it may, dictate the flow. The taoists say, do without doing. 

Ultimately though, be gentle, let it be, or the violence you work on your mind will be answered with more violence. Listen to yourself above any technique."
Meditation,fcmgxum,t1_fcmgmz3,1577774852.0,"Oh, also. If your view of the world seems weird, too real or not real enough, that's probably anxiety too. Your mind will bend over backwards to make sense of fear, even if it has to tie your perception in knots."
Meditation,fcmgmz3,t3_ehuf6w,1577774523.0,"I'm not going to read this whole thread... because it's long. So forgive me if I've missed something but here's my take and advice.

First, meditation chisels away at anxiety over time, especially if you're very gentle with yourself and receptive in how you do it. It might get better immediately, but in general, it's a long slogging shitshow that takes years to put right side up. Focus on your breath , or whatever point of focus you like, but don't focus hard. Find a way to let your point of focus hold you, if possible. Make effort without making an effort... If that doesn't make sense to you, just be gentle af. If you see or feel things, acknowledge and move past them, let them go. It's a part of yourself that's broken off from the main trying to distract you with pleasure, fear, interesting feelings, whatever works.

Second, yoga stretches and breathing are designed to make meditation more effective. Consider learning a few and doing them before you sit for meditation each day. Literally 3-5 poses and some deep breaths can make a difference over time, and your loosened muscles will love you for it too.

Third, when it's too damn much, try a mild NSAID like aspirin. A little known side effect of NSAIDs is that they reduce anxiety. You can't take aspirin all the time, but having a way to lessen it when it's really bad can save some situations and make you feel a measure of power, which is priceless."
Meditation,fcmeyoh,t3_ehy503,1577772792.0,"""There are as many ways to meditate as there are meditators.""

My personal opinion is that guided meditation absolutely is bs. I dont mean it isn't helpful, it just means it's fantasizing with fancy certificate from junior college.

Mindfulness is a beginning, particularly regarding the breath. But there's an inner urging that tells you to try different things, sometimes its something new every time you sit, I think I've benefitted by listening. Do it your way, even if it isn't what you did yesterday."
Meditation,fcmdp42,t1_fcmbd3p,1577771575.0,"This is an important point actually. A shadow person is one thing, but there is a stage where your mind actually tries to scare the bejesus out of you (or distract you with pleasant things, whichever is easier). Just ignore it and recognize that it's trying to scare you into keeping the fragments of yourself separate. It's that old adage, ""acknowledge and ignore all phenomena as they arise."""
Meditation,fcmd16b,t3_ehy48q,1577770954.0,"Probably a waking dream/vision. They can be dreamlike or photo real and they can come up when meditating (or on the edge of sleep)

Seeing a shadow person is often associated with spiritual growth. It's usually believed to be your literal dark side, the parts of yourself you repress or deny, or simply have a hard time controlling. The jungian shadow-self made manifest. I've seen them move things when I was really young and talk frighteningly in my own voice in dreams, but they're effectively harmless. They tend to be pretty transient/short lived phenomena, though, especially if you are trying to meditate without judgement of what you think or see... They just sorta fade away as long as you don't feed into them by freaking out about them or trying to shove them away.

A word of advice: they're virtually ALWAYS harmless, even if they're a little bit spooky, but they're shaped a lot by what you expect them to be... So don't decide it's a demon or a dead relative or lover back to visit you... The dreams and weird experiences can get real ugly, trust me.

Think of it as a broken off part of yourself you're reabsorbing slowly, and seeing it from time to time is the transitional phase."
Meditation,fc7og0v,t3_egbhz0,1577514304.0,"If these things feel wrong or negative, I’d be concerned, meditation can cause negative effects as well as positive ones. 

If they simply have nothing on any other experiences, and are expensive in comparison, then I get it.

There is nothing particularly unenlightened about eating out, except perhaps drinking(which is arguable). It’s actually a vibrant experience of life and people and even nature... 

BUT, sometimes you touch your deeper self by way of asceticism, and your instinct is to eat plain food, partake of silence, and take less where you might’ve taken more. You learn a lot about yourself from this, but it usually isn’t forever, nor is it proof of some spiritual or moral truth... it’s just a stop on the journey some of us are on.

I guess what I’m saying is, be careful cutting things out of your life. Do what pleases you, but don’t assume it’s forever, and don’t ever be too absolute/gung ho about it, or you might find you’ve lost something certain where you tried to gain something undefined. A taste of the things you’ve given up can be helpful from time to time, if only for a sense of context."
Meditation,fc7mlen,t3_egi6s0,1577512413.0,"I don’t typically cry during meditation, but it seems to loosen up something inside: if I’ve been meditating in the last day or two, I find I cry easily, especially when alone and usually in response to music or the score of commercials, tv, and movies. It comes and goes, and seems to have something to do with my baseline stress level. 

If you have a hard, real, core of pain in you, this process and time definitely chisels away at it. So does growing as a person and self discipline. But the process is always slower than you think it will be."
