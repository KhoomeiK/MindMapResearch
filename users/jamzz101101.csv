However, most of the money that those companies give to Cambridge is for research into emissions reduction and efficiency improvements. Their protest not only causes everyone to hate them, but it's also counterproductive."

IAmA,ff493ju,t1_ff39bq6,1579558222.0,"I have a family friend who had a severe peanut allergy. He took part in an early trial to try and immunise people to their allergies by slowly introducing peanuts from very tiny quantities. If you are interested you should definitely look into something like that. Every increase in dose was always done in the hospital so he was relatively safe. It started with tiny tiny amounts of peanut powder mixed into his normal food. 

I lost touch with him a couple years ago but last I heard he could eat a full peanut with no reaction at all. I definitely suggest taking a look."

That's so counterintuitive, I thought the US was really into policing. It's much cheaper than making an officer sit at the side of the road waiting for speeders because they just take a photo and the licence plate is linked to an address so a fine gets sent out in the post"

Personally I would emphasise the chuggy guitar sections a bit more and the vocals sound like they need a little more depth (although I understand how hard they can be, that just comes with time and practice). 
Is this just a demo sort of track because it doesn't sound fully finished sound production wise, although that could be compression related?
I look forward to the EP either way"

Their first EP struggled but they made huge changes improving both their sound and mixing up their line up going into mono. As a debut album I think mono was underrated and demonstrated how far they've come. More recently after the removal of Aiden, they've pushed new boundaries with better written and heavier songs. After Aiden left the band nearly collapsed but their perseverance had led to bring one of the leading numetalcore bands at the end of the decade"

If you want work experience to build your CV then I would suggest taking a gap year and finding a work placement. If you are interested in any STEM subjects look up the Year In Industry Scheme. They offer gap year placements in companies that are paid and you get a big support system around you. I'm doing it now and its been one of the best opportunities in my life. 

I struggled at a levels despite doing really well at GCSE because I underestimated them after cruising through GCSEs. If you get yourself in the right mindset and take care of yourself in and out of school you'll do much better. Good luck and merry Christmas!"
