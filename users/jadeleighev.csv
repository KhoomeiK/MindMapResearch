Well, I replaced it with an e-cigarette.
4 years later, I have cut down the nicotine levels gradually to 0 over a period of maybe 4 months and since new year I have quit that to.

And quitting the e-cigarette has been just as hard! Unfortunately I'm replacing nicotine with food"

Because my parents didn't find out our sex before birth, all pictures of us for the first few months was generally in white, yellow etc and because of that they can't tell who is who in baby pictures, we rely on the furniture or the ages of relatives holding us to figure it out"

Hmm 1 thing I found worked stopping the devil kitten scratching the carpet was lemon. Freshly squeezed onto carpet. Doesn't cause any issues on a carpet but maybe around your plant?

cats,fcfyvcs,t3_eh7dbs,1577634984.0,"I think being taken away from her mother so young affects their growth.
Mine I later found out at the vets was not 12 weeks as the guy I got her from told me (I had 0 experience with cats at the time)
She was in fact around 3 weeks. I bottle fed her myself, weaned her and taught her to be a cat best I could (using a scratch post and litter tray) but she is absolutely tiny! And also has no teeth as she didn't get the goodness from her mothers milk to grow big and healthy.
But I assure you, as adults, they are healthy, curious and as loving as any other cat regardless of their size!
Although mine is an indoor cat, I'm afraid the big world outside is a little too big for my little one.
If you are worried though, always speak to their vet"
