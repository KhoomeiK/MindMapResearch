AskTrumpSupporters,fdiks1o,t1_fdijyav,1578445104.0,"There’s general trumpisms - strange tweets, weird nicknames, etc. that are a lot of fun to debate here. 

This is getting into territory that no one knows how to respond to. 

Maybe this general would have struck the US in the future. Maybe he wouldn’t. If this option was presented to Trump, then other people that had power signed onto it, so it wasn’t entirely his decision.  Trump probably had no idea who he was until an hour before the strike. 

So maybe this was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, it happened and no one knows what would have happened if the strike hadn’t occurred. But now we’re in the shit and I doubt Trump isn’t going to react to the retaliation.

Just feels like something we’re not going to sort out on Reddit. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

Edit: for those not in the know: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Lady?wprov=sfti1

>	Dragon Lady is usually a stereotype of East Asian and occasionally South Asian and Southeast Asian women as strong, deceitful, domineering, or mysterious.[1] The term's origin and usage arose in America during the late 1800’s with the passing of the Page Act of 1875 which radically lowered immigration of Chinese women.[2] Inspired by the characters played by actress Anna May Wong,[3] the term comes from the female villain in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates.[1][3] It has since been applied to powerful Asian women and to a number of racially Asian film actresses. The stereotype has generated a large quantity of sociological literature. ""Dragon Lady"" is sometimes applied to persons who lived before the term became part of American slang in the 1930s. It is also used to refer to any powerful but prickly woman, usually in a derogatory fashion."
