politics,ffa1lfl,t3_esesns,1579726050.0,"I've been following this for months and I just now figured something out. I feel so dumb.  

Trump sent Giuliani, Sondland, et al to Zelinsky to tell him the details of what was required: I.e., Zelinsky needed to make a public announcement on CNN about investigating Biden.  

Therefore, in the July 25th phone call, Trump didn't have to say that directly, he didn't have to use any incriminating words. He just made some rambling comments about a ""favor"" and a bad situation. Thanks to Giuliani and others, Zelinsky already knew the details. 

*That's* why Trump keeps saying it was a ""perfect phone call."" That's why he keeps saying ""read the transcript."" In Trump's view, he did it right. His goal in that phone call was to officially apply pressure without incriminating himself. He did that ""perfectly.""  

Trump's repetition of ""read the transcript"" is basically throwing everybody else under the bus. He was the guy organizing and profiting from the ""drug deal,"" but he had others arrange the price and deliver the drugs. His job, which he did ""perfectly"" was to make the deal official without using incriminating language.  

So, yeah, ""read the transcript."" If you read *only* the transcript, he comes out fine.  

Like I said, I'm dumb. It wasn't until today that I added 2+2. Then again, maybe that's why putting this stuff on tv is important. Even though the Democrats are limited to just re-hashing everything we already know, some people (me) need that repetition to put the pieces together."

Gandalf seems to be a very good judge of character. He's usually pretty neutral and doesn't give out his opinions about people, but there are some times where he shows a real affection for a few. And they are usually people that others overlook. He treats Bilbo like a true friend, not just an acquaintance.

When you hear it out loud, what stands out clearest is the amount of ass-kissing Zelensky is doing. The transcript is filled with Zelensky fawning over Trump and saying that his strong leadership is an example for all world leaders to emulate.  

Aside from one obvious exception, people who run national governments are no dummies. You don't succeed in politics without being able to size up an opponent and devise a strategy to get what you want. Every foreign leader and businessman knows that if you want to get on Trump's good side, you have to massage his ego. And there is no such thing as too much ass-kissing with him. And when you kiss his ass, he becomes extremely oblivious to the fact that he's being manipulated.  

So read the transcript--or better still, listen to it--and imagine Zelensky is talking to you. It's exactly like a sleazy friend saying, ""Hey, you're looking good today! Have you been working out?"" before asking you for a favor. Any reasonable person would be suspicious, and Trump misses it all. He just laps up the false adulation.

To save you a click, here are the first few exchanges:  

 **The President:**  Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United  States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind,  somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning  easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.

**President Zelenskyy**:  You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked  hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I  had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your  skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our  elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were  in a  unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success.  I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to  congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time  you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I  think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can  talk over the phone more often. 

**The President**: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.  

   
**President Zelenskyy:**  Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we  wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many  new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians,  because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You  are a great teacher for us and in that.  

  
**The President:**  Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot  for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than  the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more  than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk  and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I  was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she ·doesn't do  anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think  it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very  very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily  because things are happening that are not good but the United States has  been very very good to Ukraine.  

  
**President Zelenskyy**: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000%...

AskReddit,fev4xr3,t1_fes6ejr,1579393141.0,"I think Led Zeppelin inadvertently invented ""Arena Rock."" They were the first band to create big, powerful songs that sounded good blasting through a basketball arena.  

However, no one yet had figured out how to produce a ""show"" that was big and powerful to go along with the music. You can see this with other bands like Deep Purple, too. Concerts from that era were big and loud, but the band mostly just wandered onstage and started jamming.  

It was Kiss who seized on the opportunity to produce a scripted show that was as big as the music was, something powerful enough to reach the back rows of a stadium. Kiss never wrote music as good as Led Zeppelin, (which may be the understatement of the year) but they succeeded on the strength of the show.  

Not knocking Zeppelin, it was just an idea that nobody had thought of yet."
AskReddit,feuui1h,t1_feugbmu,1579390056.0,">When LZ reunited around 07 or so I didn't even finish the concert. Page's playing is still as clumsy as it was then.

I've been able to make a modest living playing and teaching music for a few decades, and an experienced guitarist can tell you that Pagey makes no effort to keep his guitar skills honed. I would bet that he doesn't pick up his guitar until showtime, spending no time keeping in shape or warming up before a show.  

(Technical note: This shows up most obviously when he plays fast single-note runs. His picking hand and his fretting hand are slightly out of sync, so the pick hits the string a split-second before the finger applies pressure on the fretboard. Instead of a run of clear notes, you hear *thump-thump-thump-thump...*)  

Pagey has great ears and is a great composer. When he can spend time in the studio layering parts and perfecting every detail, he produces magic. Live? Not so much."

*In Through The Out Door* is a great album, but you can hear how keyboard-heavy it is. Jimmy wasn't firing on all cylinders at that point and John Paul Jones stepped up."
AskReddit,fety0sm,t1_ferh6xi,1579381174.0,"I agree totally. If you ever get a chance to hear some isolated tracks of Led Zep songs, you can hear how he layered the different guitars and it's just brilliant. He shone in the studio.

Then when he tried to reproduce it live on one guitar, he had to pick and choose between the different guitar tracks, and it could sound thin. It's weird, but sometimes I like that thin live version better, or just as much.

Like his live version of ""Over the Hills and Far Away."" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Az-TuYb4h0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Az-TuYb4h0) It's not as awesome as the studio version, but there's something cool and minimalist about it."

It's frustrating to me to consider how many brilliant people like your son and mine there are in the world who end up struggling to survive only because they don't fit well in the system. We don't know how many potential Issac Newtons there are who never get their chance to contribute.  

It's one of the reason I push for more ""socialist"" ideas of a basic living arrangement for everybody. It's the more logical option when you look at the big picture. There could be some kid living in a shack somewhere who has all the tools to cure cancer or invent fusion energy, but will never get the chance because he has asperger's, or because there's no school nearby, or because he dies from something that could have been cured if he had had access to health care. And the whole world misses out on an opportunity to make everybody's lives better because we didn't take care of that one kid.

One thing I notice in that video is that the audience is a lot more into it. (Detroit audiences are usually rowdy.) And the band seems to be jamming pretty good.

You can still see/hear that Pagey's playing is a little ragged. Playing live was never his strong point. I've heard many live Page recordings, sometimes he's transcendent, and sometimes he's just awful. I saw him on an awful night."

He jammed the needle in so far that he was able to reach the back of his eyeball where the retina is located. By studying the way the blob of light he saw moved around when he did this, he was able to create a ""map"" of his own retina.

Newton was quite possibly the smartest person who ever lived, and was also quite possibly batshit crazy. Maybe the two things are related somehow."

AskReddit,fepbsdj,t3_eq9k9o,1579316673.0,"Anybody remember The Firm? After Led Zeppelin broke up, Jimmy Page put together The Firm with Paul Rodgers from Bad Company and they did a few albums and had some hits.  

I had been too young to see Led Zep when they were active, but I was a huge Jimmy Page fan and a concert by The Firm was my only chance to see the great guitar god in action.   

It was a huge letdown. Pagey was obviously hammered and didn't give a shit. His guitar sound was tinny and waaay too loud in the mix. He would stop playing in the middle of a song in order to have a drink or light a cigarette, and when he did play, it was sloppy.  

And the show itself seemed disorganized and filled with apathy from everyone in the band and crew. The stage lights were unimpressive and aimed wrong, the band had no stage patter or presence, and the sound was bad.   

A few of the songs featured Paul Rogers playing piano. Rather than have a piano already set up on stage, they had the piano appear from off stage left and magically roll itself slowly over to center stage. A cute trick, but it took about 30 long seconds for the piano to make its way across the stage. During that time, nothing happened. Just dead silence while the four band members stood there and watched this piano roll itself across the stage. Then Paul sat down and they played a song. After the song was over, more dead silence while everybody just stood there and watched the piano roll away. That whole process happened three times during the show.  

I ended up leaving early, and that's something I never do. It was just so disappointing.  

I still think Jimmy Page is God. If you see him now, he has matured into a cool and dapper country gentleman. In retrospect, I think he was going through a pretty hard time back then, maybe a bit of a rock-and-roll midlife crisis."
