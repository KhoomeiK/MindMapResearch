Coke/crack, meth, and speed^* are all stimulants. They're like caffeine, but stronger, with some euphoria involved. The only way you're going to have your reality warped is if you stay up for days on end and end up delirious due to lack of sleep, which is a real concern on meth/speed, but too expensive to be a real problem on coke or crack.

For the most part these drugs just make you more alert. Reality becomes clearer, rather than distorted. 

\* - speed is very closely related to meth, but distinctly different. The closest thing to what used to be sold on the streets as ""speed"" is adderall."

hardware,ff13yq0,t1_ff12nnc,1579474986.0,"> It's more about just a steadily weakened cooling capability that eventually reduces performance below stock. 

That's been exactly my experience with TIM on Ivy Bridge. Even though I was using liquid cooling, I was running it at an all-core overclock of 4.5ghz for like 6-7 years, and since that computer got demoted into a home theatre PC, I never turned it off. So, I was cooking it for several years, and tbh I really should have disabled the overclock, but still. The thermal compound dried out and it started overheating. Delidding and replacing the compound I was able to lower temps by 20c. I don't see how solder could degrade like that, yet I see it all the time with paste."
hardware,ff11svw,t1_fezxkch,1579474394.0,"> polymer-based TIM has a much higher lifespan compared to solder-based TIM. 

This is interesting since it goes contrary to logic, and to my personal experiences. I've been trying to look this up to see what the reasoning is, but the best I could find is this:

https://medium.com/@OpenSeason/soldered-cpu-vs-cheap-paste-59fb96a4fca7

He seems to argue that the rigidity of the solder imposes shear stress on the solder balls and can cause delamination, which would completely destroy the chip.

That's an interesting take, but it would imply that soldered chips have a shorter lifespan and fail catastrophically. I've never seen that. In fact I've only ever seen two dead CPUs ever, out of many thousands of computers I've fixed over the past 25 years. One was DOA, and the other was liquid damage. 

On the other hand, I own a 3570k that over the years started getting hotter and hotter, until it was idling at 65C and hitting TJMax under load and throttling, while using a corsair h110i AIO watercooler. Delidding and replacing the crusty dried out thermal paste brought it back to life, now it idles at around 40C and only gets up to 75C under sustained load. 

Do you have any other info about this? I know for a fact that solder is a bazillion times more thermally conductive than TIM and has absolutely zero risk of drying out. In my experience TIM needs to be changed periodically, and can't be expected to last more than 5 years before drying out, becoming crumbly, porous, and ineffective."

spacex,ff071s8,t1_ff04ckb,1579465849.0,"I think you have that backwards. Black powder is called gunpowder, to distinguish it from smokeless. 

>Gunpowder, also known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder,

Black powder is a low explosive.

>Gunpowder is a low explosive, that is, it does not detonate but rather deflagrates (burns quickly). This is an advantage in a propellant device, where one does not desire a shock that would shatter the gun and potentially harm the operator

Smokeless powders are some 3x more powerful than black powder, and while in certain configurations can detonate, this isn't the case in guns.

>Gunpowder produces lower pressures and is about three times less powerful when compared to smokeless powder.

[...]

>Smokeless powders are classified as, typically, division 1.3 explosives under the UN Recommendations on the transportation of Dangerous goods – Model Regulations, regional regulations (such as ADR) and national regulations (such as the United States' ATF). However, they are used as solid propellants; in normal use, they undergo deflagration rather than detonation.

spacex,fezoflx,t1_fezamjy,1579459667.0,"> deflagrations, not explosions.

Deflagration can be called an explosion. Explosions can also happen without fire being involved at all. Specifically in the case of pressurized gasses it's a [BLEVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_liquid_expanding_vapor_explosion), or a boiling-liquid-expanding-vapor-explosion. It dosen't need to ignite to be called an explosion. So long as a pressurized vessel becomes rapidly depressurized it's considered an explosion. 

>Most ""fires"" found in daily life, from flames to explosions such as that of black powder, are deflagrations. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflagration


Whereas detonation requires supersonic speeds, but not necessarily oxidizers.

>Detonation (from Latin detonare, meaning 'to thunder down/forth'[1]) is a type of combustion involving a supersonic exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a shock front  

[...] 

>Other materials, such as acetylene, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide are detonable in the absence of dioxygen.[3][4]

Simpletax on the other hand, holds your hand through everything, hides all the actual CRA forms, and basically just asks you a series of questions.
