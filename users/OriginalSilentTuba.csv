zelda,fevsytf,t1_feuy5ta,1579401074.0,"Fair enough, and don’t get me wrong, I love OoT and WW very much, and I avoided MM for years, because after trying it when it came out (1998?) I didn’t like the time mechanic, and didn’t get very far before putting it down. I picked it up again in 2018, after not touching it at all in 20 years, and it quickly became one of my favorites."
zelda,fetqj3v,t1_fet8rh1,1579378421.0,"You skipped Majora’s Mask, which, in my opinion, is better than both WW and OoT."
zelda,fes79wk,t3_eqdxfm,1579362143.0,"FWIW, I’ve played every console Zelda, but hasn’t played any hand-held Zelda game (I had an original monochrome Gameboy back in the early 90s, but never had Link’s Awakening, and never had another handheld)., and I’m really enjoying playing Link’s Awakening. It’s definitely not as heavy as BoTW, but it is a lot of fun (and the toy-diorama art style they went with for the remake is absolutely beautiful). If you liked what you played of Link to the Past, you’ll like this; gameplay is similar."
zelda,fes5dud,t3_eqhnqm,1579361571.0,"It’s a very good game. I’d probably place it fourth of my list of favorite Zelda games, but most people seem to have it #1 or #2. Definitely a good place to start, as all the 3D Zelda games that come after it follow that formula (until Breath of the Wild)."

When we moved from an apartment to our house, our cat Sammy hid behind the washing machine for three full days, before she finally came out and decided to explore. Roxy, our other cat (completely blind, mind you), mapped out the whole house and found her cat tree in about ten minutes. After that Sammy never went behind the washer again (she passed away last March)."

zelda,fejooql,t3_epfoik,1579181817.0,"Do you like puzzle solving?

If the answer is yes, you’ll enjoy BoTW, and other Zelda games, too. 

If the answer is no, I would say you definitely should not buy a Switch just to play Breath of the Wild. 

Zelda games are primarily about puzzle solving. They certainly have RPG elements (BoTW more than most), and have action/combat elements, too. But the core mechanic has always been solving puzzles, in my opinion. If you don’t like puzzles, you won’t like Zelda. 

That being said, there are tons of great games on the Switch, and if you do decide to take the plunge, you’ll find plenty to do. As mentioned in another comment, there’s plenty of RPGs, plus great exclusives like Mario Odyssey (which is a spectacular game, don’t fool yourself into thinking it’s a kid’s game!). It’s a great system, and I don’t know anyone who regrets getting one."
cats,fejinr8,t3_epa17d,1579175925.0,"Super adorable! 

I had a cat who used to get very interested in only certain human foods. If my wife was eating olives, she would get very interested, and start sniffing at my wife’s plate/bowl. Any time I had any kind of chicken, she was all over it. But my favorite was the time I walked into the dining room to find her on the table (which she NEVER did), chomping away on a hamburger. She managed to knock the top bun off, and was just chewing on the patty. She ate a chunk out of the MIDDLE of the burger!"
cats,fei7ayv,t1_feht1c9,1579131881.0,"Without a doubt, he did. They usually do. Congratulations!"
zelda,fei3ekt,t3_ep9ffo,1579129404.0,"I would say go for the Switch. It gets you access to Breath of the Wild, Link’s Awakening, Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: Adventure of Link, and A Link to the Past. 

A Wii U would give you Twilight Princess (in HD, no less), Wind Waker (also in HD) Breath of the Wild, and Skyward Sword, which is a pretty nice line up, too. But the inclusion of A Link to the Past seals it for the Switch for me. I think it’s still my favorite of all of them. 

I would also suggest picking up a used 3DS, if you can, so you can play Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, both of which are really, really excellent."
zelda,fegwsi8,t1_fegq9gs,1579104279.0,"I don’t know about that; I played it with the motion plus attachment on a original Wii remote, and had no issues whatsoever."

zelda,fegss90,t1_fegjuyb,1579101702.0,"Same here. I actually have yet to play through the game on Switch; I initially played it on Wii U, which I have since given to my younger brother (who, funny enough, gave me a copy of BoTW for Switch in return). So I don’t even have access to my save file anymore!"
Tuba,fegjwdg,t3_enz2rd,1579095003.0,"Use double tonguing when notes move too fast to single tongue. 

If you can play everything cleanly while single tonguing, then there is no need to change it. If you’re double tonguing correctly, no one should be able to tell, anyway. 

Good luck!"
zelda,fegj5o5,t3_ep22nb,1579094382.0,"While I wouldn’t mind a TP HD or WW HD port (I gave my Wii U and all the games to my brother, who wanted one for his collection), I don’t think it’s very likely to happen. It’s possible we’ll see a mobile game re-done the way Link’s Awakening was, but there’s so much to do on a project like that, I imagine it’s not much less work/development time than a new game. So I doubt we’ll see something like that. 

I’m fine with waiting a while for BoTW2. For me, at least, there’s still plenty of meat on the bone with the first. In fact, after I finish Link’s Awakening, I think I’ll do another play through of BoTW...."
cats,fegingj,t3_eoxwb0,1579093948.0,"I am so, so sorry for your loss, but also very glad for both of you that you were able to be there for her, and that she was surrounded by your love at the end."

zelda,fef99lg,t3_eosdeo,1579051196.0,"Ocarina of Time was pretty groundbreaking, for a lot of reasons. It has a very compelling story, that is so well integrated it is an essential part of the gameplay. I love ALttP (it’s probably my favorite Zelda game), and it made huge leaps in storytelling, but the story still feels a little tacked on. In OoT the storytelling really drives the game forward in way that I personally had never experienced before (I was 15 or 16 when it first came out), at least not in a Zelda game. 

That being said, you’re not entirely wrong. Combat can feel a little bit like a chore, and it’s definitely a very slow going game at the very beginning. I do think it’s worth playing through if you haven’t before, and I DEFINITELY recommend playing Majora’s Mask afterwards; It takes everything that works about OoT, improves on it, and adds a truly unique game mechanic."
cats,fef12e3,t3_eormll,1579045677.0,"I’m so sorry. We lost a kitty last year, and it was devastating. Here are two things people told me that helped a little:

“They aren’t meant to be our lifelong companions. We are meant to be theirs.”

“When this happens, you take some time to be sad and process your emotions, and then you go to the shelter and save another life.”

You were a wonderful friend and companion for Dudley, I’m sure, in time, you will be able to open your heart and your home to a new friend who needs saving. Until then, take what comfort you can in knowing you gave that sweet boy a wonderful home, and a great life."
cats,feeopol,t3_eol78n,1579038035.0,"Just got back from the vet. They’re doing cytology to determine if it’s malignant or not. If it is, it’s most likely breast cancer. I’ll know for sure in a few days. The good news is that when they were taking a sample of the growth, they actually got a lot of fluid, so they said that might be a good sign, and it could end up just being a cyst."
zelda,fednhd8,t1_feclgnm,1579015791.0,"I think that’s mostly because of the motion controls that didn’t always work exactly as intended. I thought (and still think) it was a very cool idea, and I actually think it was executed pretty well, but lots of people had issues with the hardware not working quite right. I agree, though, it was an awesome game, with a gorgeous art style, and a well-told story. 

Making an HD version of this game would be great, though it’s difficult to conceive what that would look like. You would need to alter (or scrap completely)’the motion controls, which would alter the game quite a bit."
