He wants to create a better future for HIS kids, and HIS family, HIS country, and HIS world.

I bet if it didn't affect his sense of morals and responsibility, he wouldn't care about anyone else. Ugh. /S"

YangForPresidentHQ,fewxe1t,t1_fewp8c9,1579420950.0,"Here's a link to another post of the same question: https://reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/cxfun9/_/eyksfcn/?context=1

It's 3:00 am here, so forgive me if my answer isn't as eloquent.

If everyone in the US obtains a job that pays at least minimum wage, that does not mean that minimum wage becomes worthless. The entire US population gaining $1,000 a month will not inflate costs by $1,000. 

Inflation is driven by printing more money. UBI is a method to recycle the money and keep an economy flowing, rather than the money just being syphoned to the top and staying stagnant.

Prices go up when people buy less. That's why even when the economy tanks, prices continue to go up, despite low employment rates. 

As per a quick wiki search, hyperinflation occurs when you print more money. Low and moderate inflation occurs in times of scarcity.

Andrew Yang propses paying for UBI via a value added tax (VAT). VATs are utilized by every other developed country in the world, could be passed on to the consumers entirely and inflate prices, but we can tailor it. Make things like luxury cars or yatchts be taxed more, while things like diapers or food could be completely exempt. Additionally, Yang's propsed a 10% VAT if I recall correctly. A quick wiki search and quick dirty maths show most countries have ~20%. France and UK are 20%, Germany is 19%, Italy is 22%, and Spain and Netherlands are 21%.

UBI+VAT working together just keeps the money flowing, and stimulates the economy.

[Greg Mankiw](https://youtu.be/xZFRIO_v9TE) the guy who writes pretty much everyone's economy text book, endorses UBI+VAT.

[9 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winners and 2 Nobel Peace Prize winners also endorse UBI.](https://vocal.media/theSwamp/eleven-nobel-laureates-who-have-endorsed-universal-basic-income)

Also Yang majored in economics at Brown University, if that gives you some confidence that he at least understands basic economics."
YangForPresidentHQ,fevgisp,t1_fetvenf,1579397110.0,"Senator Sanders's main appeal for me was his authenticity, compassion, and, long history of progressivism. It's similar to why I was drawn to Andrew Yang in the first place. I'm always willing to listen to someone who genuinely cares about what they're saying.

The extreme Berner Bros definitely tarnished the image I have for him, despite me understanding that 1. Bernie doesn't have any control over the internet trolls and 2. Bernie wouldn't approve of their actions or words in the first place.

I try to be above that, but I guess that frustration subconciously paints Bernie in my mind as a stubborn old socialist, uncooperative extremist like how the right tries to paint him as.

So, rather than being happy with either Yang or Sanders as the Dem nominee, die hard Bernie Bros have pushed me closer to Yang."

UnearthedArcana,fdrcy0v,t1_fdqno0k,1578682692.0,"For the sake of the argument if this class gives too much benefit for a level 1 dip, I just want to take a look at maintaining a 5th level storm. I also think the point is moot past level 14, as most subclasses that grant fly as a feature attain it by then.

Fly is a 3rd level spel which lasts for 10 minutes (or 100 rounds). In my 9 years of playing, I only seen probably two encounters lasting 10+ rounds. A 5th level Wizard can cast fly twice, and maintain fly through multiple encounters.

A 5th level Warlock has two 3rd level spell slots. Therefore, the earliest a pure Tempest Warlock could access the fly ability is 5th level, in which they would have to burn both of their spells in succession for two round of flying after they burn their second spell, as it decays at the end of the turn you don't burn a spell slot.

A pure 5th level wizard is definitely better at flying than a pure 5th level warlock.

For a Wizard 4/ Warlock 1, they would get 4x 1st level spell slots, 3x 2nd level spell slots, and 1x 1st level Warlock spellslot that regens on a short rest.

They would have to burn two 2nd level spells, and then a 1st level spell, granting flight on their third turn. Burning 4 more 1st level spells grants them 6 total turns of flight at the cost of their entire arsenal, which they only regain one 1st level spell slot via a short rest.

A Wizard 5/Warlock 1 can cast fly twice.
A Warlock 6 has to burn both spells slots to attain a 5th level storm, but can then psuedo concentrate it indefinitely.
A Wizard 6 can cast fly thrice. 

A Wizard 9/Warlock 1 can instantly build a 5th level storm, but would have to constantly spend their 4x 1st level spell slots to maintain flight cost effectively, granting 6 rounds of flight. The Building Storm feature caps at 5, so overspending spell slots wastes potential turns, so after that, they would wait another turn for the storm to decay to spend a 2nd level spell to maintain flight. 

Burning all your spell slots in succession is probably due to a massive fight (as Wizards regain them on Long Rest). At that point, it's much more cost efficient just to cast fly for 10 minutes.

This subclass doesn't grant too much benefit on a level 1 dip.

Storm sorcerer 1 is definitely for evading, spending a bonus action to fly 10 feet away without opportunity attacks and then slending your movement to retreat or reposition. It's much more consistent, reliable, and doesn't take time to set up.

Additionally, it's at a much lower cost than having to spend all over your spell slots to build up the ability and maintain it."

I personally found a lot of use of my two years of going to my university's free counseling and talking to various church's pastors (I'm not religious, but the ones I've talked to were very patient and understanding).

I'm sorry if it seems that I'm making light of your issues or suggesting you haven't, or that you are able to access mental health services, but I was just suggesting something that was available for me."
