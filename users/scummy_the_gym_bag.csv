AutoDetailing,ff2u91u,t1_ff2pwy6,1579524388.0,I live 20 minutes from Carzilla’s actual shop. Can confirm they’ve got it all. Good people too. Support small business.
carporn,fefh0x7,t3_eot9an,1579056147.0,Two of the most beautiful cars ever built in one photo. It's like someone has read my bucket list. Thanks for sharing!

carporn,fe658cm,t1_fe5zwib,1578882061.0,I know. Just couldn't go any fewer. :)
carporn,fe5n318,t1_fe49eqq,1578871559.0,"For me I always upvote the DeTomaso Pantera, the C1 Corvette, the Izetta (my dad owned one), and the Ford Galaxie (my mom owned one)."
Porsche,fdsndhw,t3_emydj2,1578705474.0,"Beautiful car!  I own an '07. As other posters say, these things cling to the road like magic so just be aware of your limits and the limits of the car. It will make you feel (as it does 52 year-old me) like a much better driver than you actually are.

I really appreciate the attitude you are taking with the advice on here. Rather than getting your back up you are being respectful and appreciative. Our advice is coming from a good place. I want the young guy with a Porsche to one day be an old guy with a Porsche.  Enjoy the ride!"
Calgary,fdrdd75,t3_emqo8q,1578682934.0,"Short term advice (like for this cold snap/winter)? If you are driving, do everything gently and slowly. Brake gently, accelerate gently. As has been said on here before, drive as if your wife is carrying a big pot of soup in her lap. It gets slippery and you need to resist the urge to press hard on the gas if your tires begin to spin and resist the desire to hammer the brakes if you start to slide. Gently, gently.

It it damn cold right now, but this is temporary. Google ""chinooks"" in Calgary. It very well could be 15 degrees above zero by this time next week.

Enjoy your visit!"

cars,fd3grhx,t3_ejwnzt,1578158215.0,"I have my obtainable dream car, a Porsche Boxster. I absolutely love it. It looks like I paid a lot more for it than I did and it handles like a go cart. I would like another 50 hp (who wouldn't), but there's not a lot to complain about when the top is down and the stereo is up.  My just-out-of-reach dream car is a 1961 Corvette Convertible. I can picture it, red with white clamshell fenders. Maybe some day..."
happy,fcughii,t3_eixu5i,1577980391.0,"I'm proud of you! Keep up the effort and don't give up on yourself if you struggle and fall. Life is about the cumulative, not about the sequential. Forgiveness is the most important part of your journey."
cars,fcixqba,t3_ehed5p,1577672337.0,I drive a Porsche. It seems like every BMW driver (and a Ford F-150 for some reason). feels the need to test me out. I just keep driving.
happy,fbz4m64,t3_ef8fqh,1577234920.0,"Downloaded it from Apple Music. I agree, real cool bass. Gives me a “slow jam” feel that is pretty cool. Best of luck with the career, I’ll be listening!"
Porsche,fbyxv2a,t3_ef75z3,1577229308.0,"I knew it had to be a convertible so that narrowed things down and then I looked at my budget so it became a Boxster right away. Not complaining though, I absolutely adore my mid-engine!"
happy,fbyxhvk,t3_ef7u94,1577229017.0,"Fingers crossed for you! I wish you all the best being open and proud of who you are (cause you should be). Sweet story, by the way. I’m a sap for old romantic movie lines."
Porsche,fbm068r,t3_edw9y8,1576974841.0,Wonderful! Welcome to the family!
