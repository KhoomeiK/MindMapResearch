Which republicans are still campaigning on this?  I know they did for a long time, but you don't really see it anymore, at least I haven't.  I mean look at Paul Ryan, his whole goal was to get in there and cut spending, and he just hit roadblocks every step of the way, because nobody wants to lose their house seat for pushing spending cuts that aren't popular, because the American public is shortsighted, or they don't care.

No problem.  When the vast majority of the population diets and loses weight, they're only doing the first part of 2 important steps if you want to ensure that you lose weight and keep that weight off permanently, which explains why the vast majority of permanent weight loss fails.  Most people that lose a significant amount of weight end up gaining all of it back, and often times end up heavier than when they started.  So the problem with weight loss is that it requires that you are in a calorie deficit, and if you stay in a sustained calorie deficit, your metabolism will actually slow down in an attempt to reach equilibrium with your calorie intake (look up Adaptive Thermogenesis).  So fast forward to the end of some significant weight loss.  A person has been in a sustained calorie deficit for months, and their metabolism has most likely slowed down by anywhere between 300 - 1000 calories per day.  If you attempt to keep the weight off by just eating less your whole life, you're going to be fighting a losing battle with your will power.  Enter reverse dieting.  It's a strategy that uses Adaptive Thermogenesis to your advantage.   You can look up the protocols online, but it basically involves slowly increasing your daily calorie intake over a long period of time so that your metabolic capacity increases without any appreciable amount of weight gain.  Now understand it is a slow process.  It involves increasing your daily calorie intake by around 30 to 70 calories a week.  You can find tons of examples online of people who used this strategy to increase their metabolic capacity by 500 to 1000 calories a day (over the course of months) while gaining between 0 and 5 lbs.  Sounds too good to be true, but it works, and it's the answer to ""why can't I keep the weight off after I've lost it"".  The only caveat is that because your calorie intake needs to be adjusted precisely, it does not work with any of the more fad type diets that do not require you to track calorie intake, but instead just restrict food choices (ketogenic diet, paleo, low carb, carnivore diet, etc.)  To be successful with this strategy you need to be precise, so that means weighing and measuring your food intake and logging it every day."

> The cost transparency you want is difficult. First, the insurance companies keep the fee schedule on lock down. They won't give it to me. I have the figures because I track them all year.

Here's where I'm talking about insurance not even being part of the equation.  I'm thinking of a system where HDHP + HSA becomes pretty much standard meaning almost everyone is paying cash for their healthcare costs, so doctor's and hospitals can set their own prices for non-emergency healthcare.  If you need a non-emergency X-ray, a knee replacement etc, you can compare prices at different hospitals and outpatient centers, and posted prices would cause competition in the area.  I know this is a huge leap from the system that we have now, but it leaves more choice up to the patient and doctor without having to deal with a middle man.  Insurance would work more like...insurance and less like a cost insulator which is what it is now.  Plus if people could start putting money tax free from their paychecks into an HSA when they are young, by the time they really need money for healthcare expenses, they would have a pretty good amount built up.  I've had an HSA for only about 3 years and I have enough money in there right now to hit my out of pocket maximum ($4000) every year for the next 3 years if I wanted to.  Plus any money over my deductible ($2500) moves directly into an investment account that grows in a mutual fund.  I am a strong advocate of this system and think it would change the whole industry if it was widely adopted.  Thanks again for all the info!"

Denver,fcofohd,t1_fcoewrf,1577831105.0,"What honestly needs to happen is insurance needs to be removed from most medical transactions between patients and doctors/hospitals.  Insurance objectively drives up prices.  A hospital sends a bill to an insurance company, the insurance company comes back and says ""we'll pay 80% of that bill"" and the hospital reluctantly agrees.  Next time the hospital will artificially inflate the costs knowing that insurance will undercut them.  This is why you have bills with $50 for aspirin, etc.  If insurance was used only for emergency medical care which is less than 5% of all medical costs in the U.S., then we could actually get some price transparency from doctors and hospitals, leading to some actual competition for non-emergency healthcare which would drive down prices.  I mean the surgery center of Oklahoma already does this and their surgeries are a fraction of the cost of hospitals and out-patient surgery centers, and they don't even have any real competition.  Also look at an industry like Lasik.  It is surgery on a vital organ, they don't accept insurance, they are effectively unregulated, and prices have dropped drastically in the past 20 years.  It used to cost $20k an eye, now you can have it done for less than $1000 an eye.  Recovery times have shortened, the technology has improved and progressed extremely fast.  Imagine that but spread to all non-emergency healthcare.  I understand the appeal of universal healthcare, but imagine if we had the best healthcare in the world and it was actually affordable for practically everyone?  That's what I want, not relatively crappy coverage for everyone which is what you tend to get with universal healthcare.  In economic terms, healthcare is a commodity, it is not a public good and as such let it function as a commodity in the free market and the free market will do what it does best: drive prices down and quality up."

There is a huge difference between the government telling someone they can't do something (call to violence), and the government telling a private business that they must create something for someone (baking a custom cake).  The baker in the example told the gay couple that they could purchase any pre-made cake in his bakery, but he would not specifically bake a gay wedding cake.  It's the same as having limits on free speech vs having compelled speech laws.  One says ""you can't say this"", the other says ""you must say this"".  Very big difference...

I absolutely believe that an employer should have the option and ability to fire someone for doing the black power salute as well.  It should be completely up to the employer, but their rules and expectations should be stated explicitly in documentation like an employee handbook.  You're also ignoring a key factor here: perception.  If the public perceives that the police are openly racist, it damages the already fragile relationship.  You're also still completely ignoring the aspect of the voluntary employment.  It is not compulsory and the employment should be at will.  I believe the employer should be able to fire any employee at any time without having to explain why as it currently is in many states.  You are not getting paid by that company to express your opinions at work.  You are getting paid to do your job and represent the company.  Sure I think it should be against the law to discriminate against someone for something that is innate about them: skin color, ethnicity, etc., but it should be more than fine for any employer (including the state) to choose not to hire someone because they have an open bias against another group of people for their skin color, religion, ethnicity etc.  One is a choice, the other is not.

There you go again with the Strawman.  I never even came close to saying that doing a Nazi salute is worse than murder.  Who would say that?  That's insane.  The fact you think it's perfectly fine to try and argue your case with hyperbole and Strawman galore is kinda funny.  If your case has merit, argue the merit.
