worldnews,fekfhj4,t1_fej2zkr,1579198950.0,"It matters. Competition is not the cause of every innovation in the world, but it certainly *does* drive innovation in many cases, surely looking back at the history of industry you'd agree. Standardization and competition are not at odds, you can have both. Standardization and innovation are not at odds, either. But innovation and *making it illegal to deviate* from a standard are absolutely at odds. It's in the definition of both words - to deviate is to change, to innovate is to change. You'd be making it illegal to release a product with an improved charging port."

askscience,fdeouyn,t1_fdelmtw,1578343535.0,"I appreciate the detailed response, and I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around some aspects of it. 


You asked in the beginning of your response what my definition of a number is. Let's say for argument's sake that my definition of a number was a symbol representing either an amount of things (a positive number) or a deficit of things (a negative number). Pi is a number by this definition, because you can have pi things, or be pi things in debt. 


Is sqrt(-1) a number by this definition? And out of curiosity, what is *your* definition of a number?"
askscience,fdeami2,t1_fde5ua1,1578334848.0,Because no number multiplied by itself gives you -1.

books,fcy3sjv,t1_fcxygvt,1578074410.0,"Says who? How could one possibly hope to defend whether they wrote a depiction of abuse for a sexual purpose or not? Something that looks like horror to most people, child rape, could easily be pornography for a disturbed person. Or if I took a less dramatic route, what if I wrote a depiction of my first time having sex? Like many people, it was before the age of 18. If I were to recount that story in writing, for whatever purpose - a memoir, an anecdote to serve a greater point, or just because it happened to me, is part of my life, and I find it interesting - it could easily be construed as ""for a sexual purpose"". Anything could be construed as ""for a sexual purpose"" because when you get right down to it, there is absolutely no way to conclusively prove motivation. Maybe my kink is the feeling of grass on my skin and I walk around barefoot ""for a sexual purpose"", you'd never bloody well know. And ""sexual purpose"" is very, very broad - they did not write ""for sexual gratification."" Advancing sexual education is a ""sexual purpose,"" for example - what if an author writes of sexual acts between minors, in the hypothetical, in an effort to examine sexual pyschology of adolescents? Is that not a sexual purpose?   


This law is exactly vague enough to be abused."

Man, I really disagree, I think that's a false dichotomy. I think the solution (for someone like OP) is mad obvious: decorate with books, read with kindle. You can do both. There's nothing false about it. And if you buy the physical book you don't need to feel bad about pirating the ebook."
