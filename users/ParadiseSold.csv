One thing they always stressed when I was a teenager was that ""bored"" and ""tired"" are both states of being, but they're not emotions. Being understimulated or not well rested are things that happen at the same time as emotions.

* **Use warm water.** After a day or two, when the wax is softened, use a rubber-bulb syringe to gently squirt warm water into your ear canal. Tilt your head and pull your outer ear up and back to straighten your ear canal. When finished irrigating, tip your head to the side to let the water drain out.

You didn't do anything wrong, you're not being a bad friend. Next time he does something like this, remind him to respect your boundaries. He'll likely say things like ""i want to help."" ""why are you being like this."" ""why don't you like me."" etc. Things that might make you think ""Wow, I guess it is my job to be miserable here. the kind thing to do would be to be miserable ""

Secondly, a lot of drugs are stolen. Your classmates are likely stealing opioids out of family medicine cabinets rather than buying them from sketchy dudes at train stations. Same with weed, i'm sure at least one kid in your school district has parents who grow weed. 

Also many drugs are procured without buying or stealing. This is the sad part I don't like to talk about, but my senior year of highschool i was sleeping with a guy in his 30's. I wasn't interested in asking, but if I had wanted it, it would have been easy to convince him to buy me weed or alcohol. A friend of mine had an older brother who moved out and started to do a lot of heroin.

I GUESS we'll just be STANDING UP and going ALL THE WAY OVER HERE THEN. I guess we're just not as IMPORTANT as that BALD GUY and his FAMILY."" 

So we end up kind of close to them, and have to hear the rest of this evening go down.

She really, really wants a sip of his drink, because she doesn't know if she likes rum and she hates guys that don't share food. But she also thinks his drink is really nasty and she doesn't know how he could drink that. 

She has a lot of opinions on how gay people in the gayest part of Seattle should be less flamboyant, and she's okay with gay people but not ""characters."" Because if you're too gay you're playing a character and not really like that?? I think she meant that young gays are dramatic? I did not like listening to this part of their conversation.

And I don't know if she was planning on talking to me or if it was bad timing, but just as I'm lifting my arm up she goes ""EXCUUUUUSE ME,"" so I'm looking at her, my dad and his wife are looking at her, her date is looking at her, and this was enough pairs of eyes I think that she just like... mutters something. 

Now is the time to point out that she didn't order any food the whole time. He ate a whole plate of noodles, i ate some pork and stuff, this is a vietnamese restaurant. It's got a really nice bar so it wouldn't be unusual to get just cocktails, but it is weird that he ate a whole meal and she had already eaten. 

Then, after we leave, we see he's putting her into an Uber and she's not happy about it. My dad said something to the guy that I didn't hear, and the guy looked like he would have laughed politely if he wasn't so tired.

And every month, despite nausea, constipation, muscle fatigue, cramps, and all the other side symptoms girls get, we' re walking around like it's a secret. ""may I be excused for the restroom?""  and ""nothing is wrong, haha, go away"" and ""ummmmm no I can't go swimming because hmmmm uhhhh just cant.""

A lot of women feel more pressured to wear makeup and do their hair when they're sick because of the dreaded ""you look tired.""

I think men are heavily socialized to hide emotional pain, but are allowed to like punch as many lockers as they want when they get hit in the balls at squash. The physical pain of a cold doesn't get categorized as secret pain, I guess. And since it's unusual for them to be bedridden like this, it's a major deal?

But I could be miles off"

EatCheapAndHealthy,feyyrgh,t3_eqvc87,1579452145.0,"Honey is an awesome humectant.

If you have some dry skin and lotion isn't helping, honey might. Lotion works by sealing moisture in with an oily or waxy protective layer. If there's no moisture to seal in in the first place, it won't help you. BUT honey pulls moisture out of the air, it's going to add moisture back to your skin.

So put about a teaspoon of honey on a yogurt lid or plate or whatever. With warm, wet fingers, put a thin layer of honey on your face skin. You'll be like ""ew this is so sticky and a bad idea."" but actually pretty quickly the honey with start to spread and not stick at all.

After it's been on for 5-10 minutes wipe it away with hot water on a rag. Your skin will feel like it has some kind of lotion on it, this is partially bee-stuff but mostly water. Seal it in with a good face oil or your favorite lotion."
