I know that what’s happening is frightening right now, but you have to find a way to cope. Our hospital had excellent councillors for the family to see.  

Whenever I felt at the end of my rope I would go there to talk to them, and there were times I said I felt like running away, I felt resentful for being in that position and I felt like everyone else seemed to cope better than me. It was a safe place to vent, and I felt better for it. I never did run away, and I didn’t really blame him, and I actually coped just as well as everyone else. 

Don’t judge yourself by how everyone around you seems to be coping. Fear and grief are usually done in private, they are suffering just as you are. 

Be kind to yourself and look after yourself. 

Seek out a councillor so that you have someone to talk with. 

I can’t say that everything will be ok, but I can tell you that you will be able to cope, maybe with some support, but that’s they way should be, you don’t have to do this alone. 

Take care. X"

My friend told me I wasn’t allowed to visit on a Sunday anymore. Thank God!"

We have always had a bearded collie as a pet in our family. They have a lovely nature, their hearders, and ours herds us around the kitchen to put us in front of the treat cupboard. We don’t even realise it’s happening sometimes. 😂😂"

They said no because if my father died young she and a future husband might want more children.  At one time she sobbed and said to the Dr, I already have 2 kids I can’t even work a full time job because of this! 
Fucking arseholes, no one would help her and female Gyno’s didn’t exist then!"

TwoXChromosomes,f9jho4c,t3_e58q12,1575374771.0,As young girls we are indoctrinated to “be nice and to see the best in people”.  It’s a terrible idea. Kids need to be reminded to stay in tune with their gut feeling. If it doesn’t feel right then get out of there! Don’t make excuses for anyone.
