toronto,ff8g9vc,t1_ff8edxc,1579677154.0,"the graph is not saying house prices are more expensive than Greater London. It's saying that it's more unaffordable in Toronto when you compare median income to househould price.

As the article states: 

>The annual affordability ranking is determined using the Median Multiple ratio.  
>  
>Widely considered to be the international standard for comparing housing affordability across multiple markets, the number is simply a country's median house price divided by its [median household income](https://www.blogto.com/real-estate-toronto/2019/05/you-now-need-160k-salary-buy-house-toronto/)."

ontario,ff59mac,t3_ernhk6,1579584403.0,"Since your workplace is not located centrally in mississauga, you will unfortunately need a car to get around. I would look into renting an apartment in south etobicoke (western part of toronto but not downtown) or south missisauga near go transit near **Mimico Go station or Port Credit Go station**. That way you can drive to work but also travel downtown somewhat easily using transit. I assume rent places are cheaper than downtown but you will have to decide if the difference in price is worth it. Commuting from liberty village to your job in mississauga will   probably be a headache, as there is a lot of traffic around liberty village area."

This regulation will also make green energy and other carbon friendly industries more economically appealing and will lead to more investment"
toronto,fef7uil,t1_feewq0k,1579050244.0,I agree with the sentiment but that's what people wanted and municipalities encouraged. We are what we are at this point. We can densify certain areas but sprawling suburbs are here to stay in our large cities which makes for more inefficient public transportation.

I have family who bought a preconstruction condo in Toronto in 2014 and just received the condo and development charges were about 20k so it has more than doubled in that time.

Tory attempted to add tolls to the dvp so it would be paid via user fees but provincial govt denied that. 40% of people commuting on the DVP don't live in Toronto but property taxes will be used to maintain it. The same goes for operation of the TTC. Fares pay about 75% of the cost of service (which is quite high for public transport) but the rest of maintenance is paid by toronto tax payers but not only torontonians take the TTC (i.e. the subway extension to vaughan allows commuters from there to get on the line)
