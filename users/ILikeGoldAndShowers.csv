college,fewj0uf,t1_fewi2cs,1579411532.0,"In that case, she should probably check with the administrator to ensure she is giving her the right test. Of course, I've used ALEKS for math courses but never just for a placement test. Maybe ALEKS does their tests differently, but mine came with a printout of how I did on questions as well as where I placed. The tests should be computer adaptive in order to fully gauge where a student is. If it's only giving her pre-cal questions then she should be scoring really well or it's the wrong test."
college,fewhn9l,t3_eqntz1,1579410742.0,"If this is a placement test the school has given her, then there isn't any way to change what she's being tested on as that would defeat the purpose of the test. If this is an overall placement test to begin college, then it's likely they are simply asking more difficult questions on the chance she knows them and can place higher. 

When I took mine a while back it had all kinds of stuff beyond what I'd studied for, but that is because the study materials given are simply what is needed to test out of remedial math or lower-level courses. Those tests will usually have questions beyond what you studied for on the off chance a student knows the material anyway, then they can place higher.

From the topics listed, if she passed everything she'd probably be starting in a Cal 1 class. Many colleges these days expect students to come in at Cal 1, but, as many of us know, not many students are actually coming in fully prepared for calculus. That's why she was probably given less to study, they are simply checking to see which class to place her in: College Algebra or Trig. If she happened to pass the test with flying colors, she most likely would have been in a Calculus class."
college,fej0rj2,t1_feizfwt,1579152806.0,"You can also check out Professor Leonard on youtube. But, many of his videos are lengthy because he posts his actual college lectures.

If you don't mind paying for resources then I'd look at [calcworkshop.com](https://calcworkshop.com). She is probably the reason I've made it as far as I have without failing any classes, yet."
college,fej01i8,t1_feixsgs,1579152135.0,"Don't be so hard on yourself about Math and age. I started college at 34, and I intentionally took remedial classes during my first semester. Everyone said it'd be a waste of time, but I didn't even attend high school, so I wanted a solid foundation.   
I've taken math classes every semester. I'm in Cal 2 now, and I can already tell it will be a grind, but I have a ways to go since I'm doing Computer Science. I'll echo what has already been said that algebra and trig are what kill people in calculus. I struggled through Trig during a condensed summer semester and hated it, but Cal 1 wasn't too bad. Of course, it could also have something to do with my amazing Professor.  
Regardless, I've lived on youtube. Professor Leonard is fantastic, and he started working on pre-cal videos. I wished he'd had them up when I needed them. I also pay for [calcworkshop.com](https://calcworkshop.com/). She was a godsend for pre-cal algebra and trig, and I still use her. Overall, it's going to take repetition, repetition, repetition. It's a grind, but that's what it took for me.  
I know you feel time is creeping up on you, but don't fret. I'm turning 36 this year, and I'm glad I took the time to start from the bottom. I'm also a first-generation college student. I spend more time on just my math class than all my other courses combined each semester. I know I have a long way to go, but it's such a good feeling to look at where I started and where I'm at, and it feels great when all that hard work pays off, and you begin to grasp some of what is being said. Math is like learning a new language; it takes time.  
Also, you should check out the book ""[A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=a+mind+for+numbers&qid=1579151760&sr=8-3)."" I think you'll like her story, and it has some good points.  
Lastly, if a STEM degree isn't what you want, don't force yourself to pursue something your heart isn't in, and this is coming from someone that harps on about how STEM is everything. On the other hand, if this is really something you want, don't let math stop you from accomplishing something you want. You can do this, be patient with yourself."
college,fehgvge,t3_ep5f5j,1579116274.0,"Honestly, I think most Professors state all of that because it's necessary and important for public speaking. But, with the exception of my speech class, none of the Professors have been anal about critiquing a speech or presentation to those standards...except for my public speaking class.

I don't know any shortcuts, as I hate it as well. However, I can attest to the fact that the majority of people HATE public speaking and dread it immensely. I get super nervous, sweaty, and constantly feel the need to go to the bathroom, and I'm in my 30's. So, it isn't like you magically wake up and love it as you age.

I've seen people get super red in the face, almost cry, and even had a lady in my public speaking class that totally forgot her speech right in the middle of her presentation. She was shuffling her note cards and couldn't find her spot, so the Professor was like ""Ok, next. Thank you."" Lol.

Honestly, think of talking in front of a group of friends, does that make you anxious? For most, it doesn't. Realize that by the end of the semester, you'll probably be more comfortable around these students and know them better. In your head, just think of it as all your friends in a class and you're telling them about something you all usually talk about.

Also, I've found it easier to speak when I'm not relying on notes. When a teacher calls on you, and you answer, do you really stop and think about how nervous you are about it, at that moment? Or are you too busy trying to come up with an answer that you don't realize how nervous you are? If I rely on notes, I get so nervous about forgetting them that it affects me, but if I practically have the whole thing memorized then I can just blurt it out like any other conversation. 

I took my public speaking class as a mini-term. We had 8 days to do a semesters worth of work. Of course, everyone wants that class because they can get it over and done with rather than suffering an entire semester. So, we were in class from 8 to 5, then homework all night working on our presentations for the following day. Most of us averaged 3 hours of sleep a night, so, it was intense. Several students claimed I always seemed to do so well and never used notes, but I felt I sounded like an idiot with a wavering voice. Everyone else seemed to struggle to remember their speeches. I had mine memorized by repeating it at least 10 times before bed, without using the notes. If I had to take a peek to remember something, then I'd start over. After 10 good ones, I'd go to bed. In the morning, I'd repeat it to myself the entire time I showered. Then, as I was driving to school, I repeated it again instead of listening to music. I did this because I figured if I could remember my speech while doing something else, then I'd have no problem remembering it when standing in front of everyone. It worked, every time.

While this doesn't give you a way to eliminate your anxiety altogether, I think it's important to realize that a lot of the time our anxiety isn't just about what we think it is. For example, we may think it is speaking in front of people we dread. But, is it really that or are we subconsciously afraid of forgetting something and looking dumb that we dread? I've had friends who did debates, sermons, party promotions, etc., and they all still got nervous. So, don't worry about that. I'd encourage you to work on memorizing and repeating your speeches to the point they become second nature. Then, when the time comes, you'll really feel like you're just having a conversation in front of a group of people, and you won't have to worry about forgetting things or focusing on notes. This definitely turned into a rant, but hopefully, it helps you out some."
college,fehe81j,t3_ep2kt3,1579114726.0,"The only thing I'd add to these responses is that the only class I've been to where we started coursework right then and there was math. Every other class was rambling and going over the syllabus, etc. But, math classes tend to dive right into it. You probably won't need anything major as it's just review, but if you want to take notes then you'll definitely need a notebook and pen. But, I see people show up with absolutely nothing all the time"
college,fehdlmb,t3_ep69dz,1579114366.0,"As far as I know, if you're talking about FASFA, then it isn't about how many classes it covers, it's about how much those classes cost. My financial aid is a set amount. Now, if I were to do less than full-time, then my financial aid is pro-rated based on how many hours I'm taking. So, if I were only doing half-time, then the amount awarded would reflect the change in course load.   
Long story short, as far as I know, if you are full time, then it isn't like they will give you more money for more classes. You get full time at 12 credits, which will get you the same award as 13 credit, 15 credits, 18 credits, etc. The question here is whether or not your aid will cover the additional credits, and that is based on the cost per credit hour. If your award is $3000 per semester, but 18 credits will cost you $3500, then no, you won't get any additional award simply because you want to take more credits. As long as those 18 credits cost less than your award amount, then technically, your financial aid will cover it. Unless you're talking about some other form of financial assistance, in which case I wouldn't know."
college,feek3an,t3_eoras6,1579035354.0,"We had something similar, but it was a ""mini-term,"" meaning it was only a 7-day course. We had class from 8am-5pm and homework all night, but that was better than an entire semester of anxiety. Lol"
college,feejrm8,t1_feeit5t,1579035166.0,"Yea, I'm CS too. Next time they go on about it, give them some ridiculous integration problems or ask them to write an algorithm in Java or Python to perform a certain task. I'm guessing they aren't programmers or mathematicians, so it should shut them up. 

I think most people assume college is just reading books. They don't realize the time it takes to work some of the problems you'll be given. When people joke about me not working, I tell them school is my job, my academic career is my priority right now."
college,feehz77,t3_eomhst,1579034131.0,"Unless you're naturally good with math, that's where I'd focus. Professor Leonard on YouTube has been amazing. CalcWorkshop is also great, but it requires a subscription. For EE, you'll probably take Chem and Physics, so I'd check out some tutorials for that, too. I've used MathTutorDVD, but that also requires a subscription."
college,feeha8k,t3_eoqndl,1579033731.0,"Don't let their opinions dictate what you do with your life. I'd agree with what's already been posted: if you need money, then you'll probably need to get one. But if you're doing fine financially, then what is the rush?  
I'm also a first-generation college student, and I'm in my 30's. I don't need to work because I'm in a good situation. However, I feel I obsess about my grades probably more than most. If I get a B in anything, then I feel like I've failed my class. Perhaps, I'm just a perfectionist, but I also feel like I need to do well since I'm the first person in my family to attend school.  
I've always been a big proponent of making it on your own. But, if you have an easier path, why grind it out to please other people? Now that I'm in college, I can understand why some people prefer not to work while in school, especially if they're in a STEM degree. I could have worked and managed most of my classes just fine, but Math and Science classes are a significant grind, and that's the bulk of my degree. I also never attended high school, so I didn't have a bunch of Algebra and Trig knowledge to fall back on when I started school. I've had to work my way up from remedial classes, and while I make good grades, I honestly don't see how some students manage to work full-time jobs and major in Physics, Engineering, Chemistry, etc.   
Anyways, don't feel guilty about wanting to focus on your education. Unless you have ample free time and your degree isn't challenging, then I wouldn't worry about it."
college,fectpmb,t1_fecnwt2,1578984232.0,"Tyler Dewitt was a lifesaver. However, most of his material only applies to Chem 1 from what I remember. I don't know how well you retain info, but I only managed to pass due to repetition, repetition, repetition...and I still forgot a bunch. Lol"
college,fbqi415,t3_ee63sn,1577031916.0,"Your GPA, at this point, shouldn't really affect you getting into CC. Think of how many people enter college without a high school diploma at all. They'll most likely just have you get them a transcript and then have you take a placement test to decide whether or not you need remedial classes, etc. 

I'm not sure what you mean by ""online degree course thing."" You'll probably just want to take general transfer courses or even do an Associates in an area that you've already decided on, and then transfer to a University."
