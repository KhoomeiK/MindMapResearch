I suspect we could easily provide minimal shelter, food and function to nearly anyone who doesn't want to contribute. I mean, it would require a coordinated national effort, and that housing would not be in a popular urban center. It would also not end homelessness, because that isn't what causes homelessness."
todayilearned,ff57row,t1_ff52vt0,1579582719.0,"Yeah, hard to imagine how a progressive tax structure that exempts basic operating costs and charitable donations would work. Surely no one has ever come up with something so fantastic. 

Or, you know, render unto Caesar, etc etc"
todayilearned,ff56m8d,t1_ff52bss,1579581721.0,"Yes. 

I mean, it's not going to be particularly luxurious,  it will not be in an especially exciting or interesting place. The food will keep you alive and healthy )like middle school cafeteria quality). But yes, as a society it probably makes more sense to part with some tiny % of gdp to have less people clocking through drudgery and more people working because they feel like it. And that is doubly true for folks with some sort of medical or psychological reason for struggling."

worldnews,fe9ad82,t1_fe8eeyt,1578935823.0,"Effectively all political violence is in support of political aims. You could probably define terrorism around the targeting of civilians, infrastructure and military targets outside the context of war, but the term is so badly abused as to be nearly meaningless."

worldnews,fdc4is3,t1_fdbsnxn,1578266958.0,"So, in terms of who struck first, that's at this point a matter of historical debate, but both sides continuously strike each other through proxies. In terms of the embassy, the protests (including property damage) were in response to us bombing Shiia irregular Iraqi troops 25 dead) who we blame for a mortar attack on a US base that killed a contractor. It's entirely likely that Iran played a role, and Soleimani is unquestionably responsible for the death of US troops. The question is: does killing him make sense if it's done in a way that undercuts US strategic aims, and gets us expelled from Iraq (leaving Iran to consolidate their influence there), and improves Iran's strategic position.  In essence,  Soleiman is likely to get everything in death that he fought for in life."
worldnews,fdbqwes,t1_fd8ve6t,1578260456.0,"Yes, according to Iraq's PM, Trump called to ask Iraq to act as mediator between Saudi and Iran.  Soleimani was on his way to meet with Iraq's PM with a response to Saudi. We set him up then assassinated him at the civilian airport of our ally, killing  a senior Iraqi officer and his security detail as part of the bargain.

Mix with a little cumin and paprika for chicken or pork, for instance, but works for all kinds of things."
politics,fcwvkei,t1_fcwutq9,1578039423.0,"A) Soleimani is a sitting official of a government we are not at war with.
B) Most of the people killed were Iraqis,  who we are nominally allies with.
C) Killing Bin Laden was not likely to result in a major destabilization of the Middle East.

Those are some of the more obvious points."
worldnews,fcwpkx3,t1_fcwo232,1578032727.0,"And we bombed Iraq.

If they used a missile fired from an Iranian plane/UAV we would say bombed. We would definitely say it was terrorism.  And if they were bragging about it to the news after we would call it an act of war. 

Soleimani was anything but innocent.  Iran certainly provoked this (well, provoked something), likely in an effort to divert attention from the protests by Iraqis about Iranian influence,  among other things. None of that makes this a reasonable act."

worldnews,fcwmn6q,t1_fcwlepj,1578029947.0,"Which part is a stretch, that this occurred at Baghdad International Airport,  that they are (at least a nominal) ally, that we used a bomb, or that we are not at war in either Iraq or Iran? That we bombed them effectively is irrelevant. This wasn't an attack in the lawless outer reaches of Pakistan or Yemen, it's the capital. 

There is every reason to believe this just shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,  and it dramatically destabilizes the region. It would also be called terrorism if it happened in Europe or North America, and justifiably so."
worldnews,fcwks6p,t1_fcwf0ie,1578028361.0,We just bombed the civilian airport of an ally. I have wanted Soleimani dead for the better part of two decades but this is insane.
Economics,fcaqmr6,t1_fcan8dp,1577574656.0,"No, not remotely.  However, we decided to approach this unilaterally instead of in concert with allies, significantly reducing the impact of the tariffs.  China is more of a command economy and has more unified political structure (especially after the last Party Congress) which means they have more options for how to mitigate the pain and how long they can take it without a change of leadership.  And long term China has reason to believe that they will lose more from conceding than they do from the current economic problems."
Economics,fcallsc,t1_fca4zbu,1577571660.0,"If the question was ""can the US damage China, and/or the world's, economy?"" The answer would be a resounding yes.  If the question involves whether this is an effective lever to accomplish US economic policy goals, it's an equally resounding no."
