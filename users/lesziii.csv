gamecollecting,ffeqnuc,t3_et8f0b,1579860703.0,"Story behind this is kinda messy.  
But my mothers sister started selling off everyone's property as soon as my grandmother had moved out for elder care. She claims to have sold everything, though this was found by me when digging through the basement.  


After finding this and freaking out that I'd have something left to return to my mother, one of the only things she wanted back. It didn't take long to confirm it was her original Atari 2600 along with 80% of the games that she owned, the others were sold by my aunt.  


Glad to have these in the family still, a household relic now too, it's been getting several hours of use since it was returned to my household."

PS4Pro,ffeocmf,t3_et6cu2,1579857192.0,"Got one recently too, to me it feels different and less of what Sony's main goal probably was.  
I think Sony was trying to use this as a way to tap into the same market that Scuf has, though I think the PlayStation Back Button is a tad bit different.  


The back button works more like a quick-access or macro button than anything else. Something that can make it easier to take one hand off the controller to reach for something and not missing a certain button *(a button that's consistently used in whatever game)*.  


My hopes.  
I hope that in the future Sony can find a way to push updates to these, something that'll allow us to make use of it more, maybe assign button combinations as I'm sure the UI can be programmed in this way.  


As to your issue, I'm having the same. It's a tight fit for sure and I've felt a bit worried about removing it without breaking it, that's the only thing that concerns me."

If it's keeping your attention, you should go for it.   
As to something cheaper like the Sharp TV you show, I'd pass on... This is simply because Sharp isn't the same old brand everyone remembers from the past and you pretty much need a direct 4k signal from the source you're using to get full enjoyment out of it."

Roku,ffa5j0d,t3_esg54h,1579728294.0,"I was having this issue as well with a Roku Ultra not but a week ago. For my television I found the same thing, the fix was a case of going in and changing the audio output to PCM which fixed my issues.  
I'm thinking the could be the same problem, though I'm unsure, but I'd test and see if this helps."
Televisions,ffa56gk,t3_eshxvf,1579728099.0,"I think what he meant was that it's not going to be anything serious until you get up into the higher end market, which I can understand but don't totally agree with.  


Some of the more budget offerings offer HDR, but on lower end models it can sometimes be a gimmick depending on what you're buying. After you get past the $400 tag HDR becomes a more noticeable difference and is almost a separate experience to anything below that asking price.  


I think it really depends on your price range before you determine if HDR is worth it or not, but as always that little extra spent could provide a better HDR viewing experience, given you do your research."
PS4Pro,ffa3zmy,t1_ff3hr1f,1579727429.0,"Exactly what I was thinking.  
This is usually common of fans that have been under a lot of pressure due to heat, eventually they start making this noise because of the motors wearing out.  


Depending on the model of PS4 Pro, this is going to be an even more common issue.  
As u/wayupthere67 said, replacing it is going to be the only way you're going to prevent the issue, even more so... fan failure."
PS4Pro,ffa38g3,t1_ff9o9zx,1579726996.0,"While I understand it's for curiosity purposes, and that some of the older model 1080p TVs still produce a gorgeous image sometimes for their age. Panels were being made so much more differently back in this time that picture settings aren't going to matter.  


Heck, same goes for a 4k TV.  
If you're wanting to find a color setup you like and that fits your taste, you're going to want to mess around with the image, mess around with temperature, & RGB settings to see what you like.  
You gotta remember, everyone has their own idea of what good color looks like. For instance, I strongly prefer a deeper red to green ratio where reds look darker but have depth, & greens are bright but still contain a bit of dark shading to them, so I'm gonna prefer a strong red and green palette.  


Play around with your settings and I think you'll find yourself happier off that way, hope this kinda helps break you into setting up the image you want."

I've read through other answers in this thread and while some make sense like the YUV420 HDR setting that you need to apply. This also looks like a case of some missing bits of data which would lead me to believe the cable you're using isn't delivering the full 2.0 data transfer which should be 18Gbps to 21.0Gbps depending on 2.0a, 2.0b, etc...  


I'd just first go about doing some research, if you need any cable recommendations I'd be glad to help.  
This should be the fixer though."

PS3,ff7vobb,t1_ff77hm8,1579659457.0,"I wound up buying an mCable to actually make up for the image that the PlayStation 3 puts out via native HDMI.
Though I'm thoroughly a PlayStation,  & PC fanboy through and through, I did wanna somewhat improve and modernize the image gains that can be gotten on newer TVs with the mCable.

So if you still intend on playing older HDMI consoles on your TV/Monitor, I'd put a heavy recommendation on that cable."

I think once you find your taste, what you're into, and decide if you want a single option for audio devices to listen to, or various options for certain things, you'll find your groove in the hobby.  
You either buy in and spend a lot, or you do research and find your right price you're willing to spend, this will generally determine how it all goes.  


DT770 is an awesome headphone, especially for its price. I started on something different originally, but the DT770 are actually the cans that made me really determine what I liked in audio."

Essentially, be careful, return it.   


It'll tell you it's transferring as much data as possible, but it will create sort of invisible blocks of space that aren't actually existent. There's no way around any of this since it's likely an 8GB drive marked to be 1TB.  


There are some cases in which you can report this to Amazon, call them and let them know what's going on, and they may consider offering to send you out one of their storage devices.  
I've had this issue once in the past, they offered to send out one of their drives, or refund me the money.

4kTV,fey0fga,t3_eqm4l1,1579439088.0,"Can understand the move from a business perspective, but from a consumers perspective it looks like a case of them just not wanting to get tangled up in the competition for OLED TVs.  


I can understand the strong push for OLED as it makes damn clear sense, OLED is beautiful after all, but OLED has some of the issues Plasma did and seems like it's kinda going the same way Plasma did before it completely died out.  


Strong move from Hisense, but they're going to have to do something in their market to prove themselves capable of being a leader in the department they're going after, otherwise they're going to end up taking the sidelines seat.  


I'm excited but skeptical to see what comes of it for sure, maybe Hisense can do something that actually blows our mind for once. Though I've got a reason to suspect that it's going to be trial and error for a while before we're getting any good panels that are rival the likes of what OLED is doing.  
Soon enough, I'm hoping, maybe we'll find ways to avoid screen burn-in and some other issues OLEDs have, and if that is the case... I can't say I've got the highest hopes for them."

When people are close friends like that there's sometimes going to be that feeling as if they get along well enough to be a couple/thing that'll eat you up and make you feel uncomfortable.  


I sometimes wonder if the reason some people get along this well is similar/or due to the fact that they tried to have something in the past but friendship was the main spawn that came out of it.  


You're totally okay with feeling this way, I don't blame you one bit for feeling anxious about the situation, matter of fact I get dissociation in these sort of situations.  
I'd say to try and understand the friendship they have. Generally when friends have been friends for a longer amount of time there's generally a strong unbreakable bond that's very noticeable and makes us all jealous.

PS4Pro,fdv79e6,t3_en2h0z,1578744119.0,"Planning on doing the same soon.  
Spent most of this generation mainly on PC, now I figured I'd make up for it, get a Pro, and start recollecting.  
Nice job though, I'd love to know what you paid."
PS3,fdotvwl,t1_fdo677z,1578612764.0,"B01 is different in terms of the read/write speeds.  
That's literally about it."
PS3,fdnim1q,t3_em9fv3,1578586579.0,"I wouldn't say there's any major differences, though the CECHE01 model is just known for some smaller differences in read/write speeds.  
I'd recommend doing some searching around on that stuff if it matters to you.  


Another thing you would also wanna consider is that HDD change.  
Older fat backwards compatible models have an issue. If you changed out the HDD , you might wanna take into consideration that there's a chance that the backwards compatibility could be removed, I don't know how that stands though with adding CFW. Technically since you'd have a form of the PS2 Emotion Chip inside the console, in theory you should have full backwards compatibility just going based off of knowledge about the system.  


Since you asked though, yes. There are a few lists out there that show what games are compatible and what their downsides and upsides are.  
[PlayStation Dev Wiki's List](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PS2_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List)  
[An IPFS.IO list](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_and_PlayStation_2_games_compatible_with_PlayStation_3.html)  
These are the only existing lists I know that show what games give issues, what don't.  
Though like I said, having a model that has the PS2s chipset built in may show differing results.  
Hopefully this is helpful to you."
RBI,fdjdhtm,t3_elg96v,1578466311.0,"You've posted this same thing before, if it's bothering you then you might consider taking it to higher authorities, RBI can only go so far.  
Stuff like this can only go so far if not reported. Likee is among the same as TikTok.

PS3,fdjc16y,t1_fdj71lq,1578464793.0,"I've gotta agree with you, love my fat model.  
Though the PlayStation 3 does a lot of cleanup via its chips, I still have to stand by the old CRT for older games."
PS3,fdjbxii,t3_elk02v,1578464690.0,"Yes, these rumors have been going on for a while now.  
There's validity to it and it's actually a small part of the reason Sony has been slowed up about announcing anything so far.  


With a couple of skews, & concepts that were released a while back, there was info giving head to the fact that Sony was testing ways to get PS2, & PS3 capability working at a CPU based level something similar to SOAC. Though I think this was scrapped since that project was hinted at.  
Come to now, Sony's actually been testing new CPU schematics about the system being a hard read infrastructure so there wouldn't be as many hiccups if they were to do this.  


I'd pre-order now if Sony came out and just confirmed it, unfortunately that's why I've held my cash to my pockets though."
PS3,fdhh7xu,t3_ekny5y,1578422585.0,"Try a different setup, keep the HDMI cable connected, hold the power down for 20 seconds, after it power cycles, check and see if at that point you're getting a signal.  
If it's not that, you might wanna start testing cables and seeing what works. I'm sure as long as it's turning on, there's no YLOD, and you're at least getting a sign that it's staying on you should be fine.  


I'd suggest trying a different monitor, maybe even using the AV cables so you're forcing a signal out of it. This will help determine if the system is seeing anything at all.  
If this doesn't work, try testing to see if you're getting any voltage output at all from the display ports to determine what you can do next."
RBI,fdfq0x1,t3_el19uq,1578367453.0,"You NEVER want to attempt this by yourself, there's PTSD, & then there's other stuff like depressive PTSD which will last a lot longer.  
Depressive PTSD is caused a lot by surrounding yourself in your husbands sisters problems, trying to understand, and being near what happened, it'll cause even more long term effects. I'd recommend hiring someone to do it for you. Heck, even considering moving away from the situation might help eliminate some possible effects that could hit you.  


Like everyone else has said, Gofundme, & then use the money to pay for it.  
It'll take all the weight off of you, I'm sorry for this situation and hope you can come to heal over it."
PS3,fdebnpi,t3_ekv9hc,1578335495.0,"Love the fat models, though they take a lot of time and love to keep in great condition.  
Surprisingly enough, fat models have a better laser than most people assume and I've found that the partial-backwards compatible models last a very long time.  


The price you paid is a steal though.   
Love the Gen 1 Slim as well! I've got a soft spot for the Gen 2 models, but the Slim has to be one of the better models released.  
Good, solid, awesome finds!"
PS3,fdd96dt,t3_eko76d,1578300623.0,"YES! I love this deal, unfortunately since PlayStation 3 stuff hasn't done all too well in terms of sales, they've been doing this very frequently to try and push sales out the doors.  
Last time they did this I ended up going to several different GameStops for this deal."
PS3,fdd93hl,t3_ekjko7,1578300506.0,"Have always seen this around and never grabbed it up, I know Pandemic was very well loved. So knowing this, I'll have to pull the trigger on it next time I come across it, especially since there's always a copy floating around in my area."

The one on the Vita is very hit or miss, but I recommend that one too.  


I think the only issue I've had with PS3 collecting is trying to decide what games I want to own physically or not. This time around I'm mostly going for what I'm looking for, but also grabbing anything else that comes my way."

I can highly agree that the Stuff Packs back then added a lot more pretty clothing to the game than The Sims 4, & maybe some of The Sims 3 packs did, but some of The Sims 2s clothing choices were nice, had a nice aesthetic, but were also a colorful mess."

PS3,fd2nqq0,t1_fcympcs,1578149834.0,"There was a statement made at one point about disdain towards the original model.  
I'd have to search for the article, but Sony only really acknowledges the original when it comes to repairs or anything like that, otherwise they turn their nose up towards it.  


I'm not sure why the other systems either, my feelings towards it follow more along the lines of this being a showpiece/display of the most successful models."
PS3,fd2mw2t,t1_fd2l41c,1578149491.0,"RROD Several times, Microsoft kept issuing false reassurance to people.  
They went back and tried to work out fixes for the newer 360's to come out, this didn't entirely clear the issue. In fact, at one point in time during the Xbox 360's Slim phase the RROD issue was an even bigger issue than on the original model.  
This caused a influx of trade ins, returns, and ultimately halted the Xbox 360 and its sales pace for a good while. People were losing trust and pretty much assuming that Microsoft was doing nothing at all to terminate the issue.  
Inevitably, this is what it took to hurt Microsoft and slow their 7th Generation pace, as this is what it took to finally slow them up.

Such a beautiful console, period."

PlayStation 3 was a blessing in disguise after the Xbox 360 kept shooting itself in the foot.  
It kinda prevailed in the end and proved people who thought it would fail wrong.  


PlayStation 4 came out, did its own thing, and ended up taking over after all.  
I couldn't have asked for anything more from it. I've never felt so comfortable with a console throughout it's whole lifespan.  


PlayStation 2 is king.  
Period, there's nothing that could better define that generation better with the way it preformed. It brought some of the best experiences to my life."

An hour long though! Definitely a tastefully sized demo, probably to get old fans used to some of the newer changes they've made and to see if they'll grow onto people.  
Let's at least be thankful Square is offering so much more in terms of demos as compared to other devs/pubs."

Glad you sold it.

LetGo,fcvhuqw,t3_ej0eld,1578002407.0,"So I've been on LetGo for approximately since it dropped in 2015.  
I've had my fair share of experiences, more so good over bad.  


In my general experience I'm a pickup person, I won't travel out unless the person seems fishy. Then it's meet at the police department.  
In the case of games you generally need to be careful and only go after people who actually have ratings. Games are a good portion of what most robbers on LetGo seek out.  


When you're selling a system I generally always go for the pickup option, I make it bold in the description so that it is heavily advised. I not only do this so I can protect myself, but simply due to the fact that if someone is serious, they'll come to you.  
If you're offered an offer that's a tad higher than your asking price, make sure they're serious.  


Another thing is, to make sure communication is very clear, response time is accurate and on time, usually big dips in between time let me know that someone isn't as serious as they claim.  
I always ask for a phone call. It lets me feel the person out and tell if they seem anxious or sketchy, usually the duration that someone is willing to talk is very telling of how genuine they are. Most people who are villains, and are out to rob you are going to make conversation very brief, they won't say much, and they pretty much hide almost every small detail about themselves.

Sorry for the uncalled for downvotes on your post, I don't know why people are doing that at all, but I do feel like you are in need of advice, & you deserve to get the most info possible to be able to protect yourself."
PS3,fcuo2nn,t1_fcsk4iq,1577985093.0,"If you're on a Slim, some of the easiest fixes are going to be replacing some of the caps to the HDMI.  


If it's a direct HDMI issue in general, you're going to want to check each video channel and make sure there's not a signal coming from any other video output on the system before you dig in.   
Generally, if you're getting a signal from the other ports, but the HDMI is refusing to work, you're going to want to check capacitors dependent on the model and from there diagnose what's causing it.  
Sometimes you might need to replace the HDMI port all together which isn't terribly hard, but if you're getting no signal out of the console period. Yeah, as long as you don't plan on trashing the system, check around and see what's causing the issue.   


One of the more common issue on Gen 2 PlayStation 3 Slims is going to be the video channels just shutting off. Unfortunately those require a donor board and you're going to have to look at replacing it, or if you're experienced with soldering. You can always use a voltage meter and detect where the issues is coming from, try soldering copper wire, and see if anything happens."
thesims,fcmdcge,t3_ehqdxm,1577771246.0,"Try not doing cache cleans and then suffering this issue, it's the worst. As u/AdJaGu mentioned, it's a very similar case. They'll get stuck outside and stick out there until you leave the lot."

In the case of unverified accounts, I'd recommend asking them to verify if they're a buyer. After that, I'd suggest watching their text behavior to determine if they're fishy or not.  
I've dealt with several buyers that do this sort of thing and then start asking some very inconspicuous questions."
