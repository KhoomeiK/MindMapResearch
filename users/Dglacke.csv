nutrition,fek6ahn,t3_eplahg,1579193501.0,"This is a bit controversial. Some suggest that our circadian rhythm is primed to eat soon after waking and that our insulin sensitivity decreases as the day goes on.

However, many people do intermittent fasting (which we all should) and claim that when you eat doesn't matter so long as your fasting 12-16 hours.

I'm in the camp that believes eating soon after waking and stopping eating early in the evening or late afternoon is optimal."

AmazonFlexDrivers,feixue1,t3_ep9pzz,1579150223.0,"I might consider taking base pay for a 3.5 or 4 hour block, but never a 3 hour. You have to factor in the fixed cost of driving to and from the station. With fixed cost being standard for all route lengths, it only makes sense to try and work for longer periods.

Second, I avoid any block that has me driving during rush hour traffic UNLESS it's for an increased rate of atleast $22 per hour. Even then I might decline 3 hour routes during rush hour simply because the fixed cost of getting to the station is higher during rush hour."

I'm not saying all his studies he cites are wrong. However, he does cherry pick studies that fit his agenda. Anyone can paint any picture they like in nutrition if they only cite stories that fit their narrative. 

Look no further than the carnivore community if you want another example of cherry picking evidence."

Even if oxalates are bad, the benefits of these healthy foods well outweigh whatever negatives oxalates have."

nutrition,fe4uo50,t3_ensv45,1578862958.0,"I consider it healthy. There's a large amount of magnesium and iron, plus the antioxidants and polyphenols seem to increase blood flow.

However, there's quite a bit of saturated fat which might negate the blood flow benefits on cardiovascular health. It all depends on what you choose to believe in regards to saturated fat and atherosclerosis.

EDIT: also be careful with the assumption that high calorie = bad. I'm a tall 200LB male who has high calorie requirements to maintain muscle mass. So in my case, consuming high calorie foods are important. If too much of my diet is low calorie plants, I become rather gassy and lose muscle mass (unhealthy.)"
