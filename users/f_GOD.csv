we have the same amount of contempt for trump that they do for hillary and if you  believe that they'd be treating her with the respect they expect us to have for trump, then you're stupid or lying. the only difference would be that with both a republican house and senate, hillary would've been impeached by 2018 because she didn't want to disclose her finances, or divest from her businesses, and she gave her kids prestigious cabinet positions, and she had a scandal with a pornstar, and her lawyer went to jail because of the pornstar scandal, and then a bunch of more people in her campaign went to jail, and she lied about big things, and she lied about little things, and she fired career officials from important government posts and ran a skeleton administration with acting directors, and i could keep going on but it won't make a difference because millions of grown ass people went in with a straight face and voted for a man who admitted to grabbing pussy without consent and went bankrupt 6 times to run this great country.

i thought having to give up liking dinosaurs was wild but i'm gonna have to check this adventist stuff out cause apparently it's better than sex."

that said, i'm not quite sure how nearly complete fossilized remains and geologic records that consistently lend credence to a theory of biological evolution (tangible physical evidence) won't pass muster, but a bronze age book about talking snakes and virgin birth that also promises you will live forever doesn't set off any smoke alarms."
