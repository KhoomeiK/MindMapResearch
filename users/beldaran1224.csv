I gave clear reasons, reasons which you agreed with originally, why I felt your characterization inappropriate. Doubling down on it now seems more than a little strange. I specifically suggested alternatives that were both more appropriate and less harmful in terms of furthering negative and often inaccurate stereotypes.

I am also disappointed that you ignored so much of my comment in favor of a single point which I had already acknowledged. Oh well."
Pathfinder_RPG,ffdw17h,t1_ffdrb5r,1579830330.0,"I mean, I think there's some real problems with your argument here.

First is an issue of how, despite your desire otherwise, you come across as disparaging towards those with autism. You can simply say things like ""non-verbal"" or point to any number of historical figures who specifically refused to (or were unable to) communicate with others, like Helen Keller or Jean. The context specifically being intelligence would inherently bring a certain bad connotation otherwise. (The use of ""maladapted"" is particularly egregious).

Two. You are drawing what appears to be an arbitrary distinction between curiosity and what you call independent questions. Suggesting that because these animals do not possess the *language* to communicate higher concepts means they do not have the capability of doing so is more than a little circular.

Clearly, this concept goes beyond D&D, and suggesting that we must continue to pretend as if language is the clear standard of intelligence is kind of pointless. There's no doubt that the rules of Pathfinder, D&D and other systems define it so. That's not really what we're discussing here.

Certainly animals have communicated things more abstract than needs. Look at the gorilla that Robin Williams befriended when they were told of his passing. They expressed sadness. Of course we can't completely isolate this from trained responses in natural environments, which is controlled experiments are so important. But it certainly indicates capabilities that we would not have known existed a couple decades ago.

With all that we are learning every single year about human learning, AI and animals, it is more than a little strange to so definitively state that you can clearly delineate these differences.

I simply think you're making a lot of unfounded leaps here, when these are questions that have stumped the best minds in history for centuries."

Their high schools had programs that you simply don't find in today's high schools - my father took a class on radios which including building radios and running the school's radio. These sorts of skills are still very valuable - sure, radio isn't exactly hip, but at the same time my dad was taking that class in high school, my mother's father was starting a business in electronics (especially TVs and radios) that would end with him selling it after he became injured for enough money for him to live on for the rest of his life.

There are plenty of ways that schools could be supporting the entirety of a student's life: teaching them finances (not stock markets, but budgeting & saving & home buying), health (actual health, mandatory comprehensive sex ed, vigorous gym classes, fact-based nutrition), as well as things like home ec (basic sewing, cooking, home repairs, maybe even extend the traditional teachings to traditionally male things like changing a tire that most Americans will need to know). Provide robust programs for these very practical fields and leverage them into just as robust programs for math, science and language. Offer classes on computers, and programming or web design, as well as classes on social media.  Classes that emphasize thinking skills and not mere memorization five seconds before the test."

A couple shelves are organized based on color schemes - they look good together on the shelf.

My collection is still reasonably small, so this works well."

Istanbul is a pretty good baseline in terms of the size of the box, and the more pieces, the more filament you're using. I'd estimate the total to be at least half a roll of filament, perhaps significantly more. Which means you're looking at probably $10-12 for the insert.

It is really hard to estimate without a file and settings, though."
3dprinter,ff0kdqu,t3_eqvpws,1579469694.0,"Materials are extremely cheap, honestly. A kg spool of PLA (the most likely material used in something like this) costs closer to between $20-25. You can get spools for less, but consistency is what you're paying for.

The issue you're looking at, as someone who literally just got a printer to print inserts, is that you need to invest a lot of money into the printer (and potentially other items), and then a ton of time into getting quality prints in any sort of consistent manner.

I'm having a blast with it, but it is a lot of time to print stuff like this, and the cost of the printer is a huge upfront cost."
