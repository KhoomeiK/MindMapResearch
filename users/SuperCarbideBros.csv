Chempros,ff8qanh,t1_ff8nmio,1579691572.0,"According to my PI, freshly distilled THF from Na/benzophenone is the best we can get, if the solution is indeed purple/blue. I remember distilling a small amount of THF (~ 200 mL) myself using what we got from the solvent system a few months ago and it seemed fine. I will probably have to try that again some time.

The solvent system we use has bulbs where you receive solvents from the sieves column. You can transfer solvents from these bulbs to your reaction using a syringe. I've seen better equipped labs using solvent systems w/o the bulbs and require people to use Schlenk bombs instead, which I guess minimizes the risk of air/moisture diffusing into the solvent.

I suppose a well-maintained solvent system could yield reasonably dry solvents, but my group probably wasn't the most impeccable bunch on that, and the local climate definitely doesn't help.

I don't think my group has a Karl Fisher titrator but there might be one hanging around in my Dept. It's a shame though I don't know how to do that."
Chempros,ff8lpa7,t1_ff7azew,1579684657.0,"> more effective

Will have to mildly disagree here. My group has a solvent system that recently (about 6 months ago) had the sieves replaced, and the THF is still wet as fuck, which hurts some of my chemistry and some of my co-worker's too. We set up a still and even though it was still suboptimal (the liquid inside is orange, yeah) my coworker had his reaction yield doubled, according to my PI. At this point I'd rather trust the Sureseal bottled THF from Sigma than our solvent system.

The process is much safer and easier, that I agree."

Before getting Python I used ikelos a lot. It sure sounds nice on paper to have trench barrel, but more often than not going toe to toe against a (medium/large) blocker or the Primeval is not fun.

I don't know if Imperial Decree can roll 1-2P, but if it does it can be a kinetic alternative to Python, I guess.
