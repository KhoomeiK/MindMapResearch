One in particular was a debt that was like 10 years old. I kept asking about it while also repeating ""Can't possibly be me"" after every question.

But we are talking about men who have NEVER had sex. Most of them are going to be obsessed with it and obsessed with trying to obtain it."
AskReddit,fedphgc,t1_fedoarh,1579017064.0,"Are you being serious? We are talking about people with an issue so bad they can't have sex for fear of rejection and laughter. 

You really think these people have the confidence to just move on with their life and sexual mature. 

I mean for crying out loud there are men out there willing to break their leg bones in half and stretch them to gain a couple inches because they are short. 

Now we are talking about men with half an inch penis. Of course they are going to have 'immature priorities', jackass!"
