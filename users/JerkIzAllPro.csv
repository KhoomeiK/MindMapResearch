memes,fdmsy9v,t1_fdmsbko,1578564240.0,"It depends on the bomb for a larger number of reasons. First, we have to deal with size and weight and availability. Expert bomb makers can make them small or compact but most bombs in war efforts and terrorist acts are made by amateurs so these bombs are big and clunky. (please note, not all people that made bombs in war torn regions were terrorists, but sometimes it is better to make the bomb and go home to your family than be executed for not helping the group. See iron man 1 when they capture him and want him to make missiles).Dirty bombs are made using depleted uranium or scrapped nukes, and they can be incredibly harmful to everyone even if detonated safely which means it *MAY* be safer to defuse. Shrapnel bombs are bombs filled with literally anything they can pack in (in war torn regions like Afghanistan, putting in coins, washers, screws, nails, etc. was a method used) so there is potential that the shrapnel could be dangerous if this rocket didn‚Äôt get far. Some bombs are tied to a cell phone so a call could cause it to go off during the approach, and some bombs have multiple tripwires tied together so if one goes, they all go. Finally, launching a bomb into the air and causing a panic *MAY* be the exact thing a group would want, not because it does damage, but it incites chaos and reminds people how dangerous the world is.

Before I respond to anyone else I am going to say several things: 1, I am not an expert on this, I‚Äôm just using reasoning, speculation, and things I have heard or read before which means my information *MAY* be incorrect but I think I‚Äôm right so far. 2, I‚Äôm not going to explain any process of the manufacture of explosives because despite my first amendment, I also care for the safety of everyone in the world, and nobody should get hurt. 3, if you must absolutely protect yourself, [JERKIZALLPRO HAS BEEN TERMINATED, DO NOT REPEAT HIS MISTAKES]"

Quick micro-edit: this is also why making bombs is something that people in war torn regions do on their own. Their is no one way to make a bomb and so they make their own to fight off invading forces using [THIS DATA WAS EXPUNGED BY THE FBI] and one thing that often happens with these amateurs is they set off their own bombs accidentally and blow their fingers, hands, arms, and legs off (think when people tie fire crackers together except on a light military scale)

The equivalent of having a stock compared to just a pistol grip is like being able to use your entire body weight to close the door versus using a yardstick with one hand to close the door. 

For a more in depth explanation, guns with stocks allow the kinetic energy to move back into your shoulder and spread over a large area whereas guns with pistol grips are something you just kind of hold onto, with all the energy going into your hands. They are useful for something like home Defence, where you may only need to fire once or twice, and you need to do it in closed quarters that doesn‚Äôt allow for a long shotgun. Edited out bad info

Also, accuracy. The smaller a gun, the less accurate, although in this case it‚Äôs not as much firing a long barrel shotgun vs a short barrel shotgun (which is illegal by the way. SBSs are referred to as cop killers because the spread is so high, one shot can take down several people.

EscapefromTarkov,fcu6cel,t1_fcu5sjm,1577973622.0,"One of the iconic moments from gaming for me was when a dude I was playing siege with fires his pistol point blank (literally he was touching the other guy) and his bullet went 90 degrees straight up and hit the guy in the head, despite the barrel pressed to his stomach. Ever since tarkov, I struggle to fire guns ADS close range because I shouldn‚Äôt need to. This is why I also enjoy Hunt, because the shoulder aim (not ads) puts bullets roughly where you‚Äôd expect"

I sat there, wondering if I was actually hearing anything or if blood was pooling in my head in an attempt to protect my brain from scrambling itself. I have only left one movie before it was done, because it was a horror movie that was too intense for me, and let me tell you, this movie wasn‚Äôt just bad, it was so awful it was terrifying. 

I sat there so genuinely blasted out of my mind, I considered punching the patron next to me so that I could get in a fist fight and be removed from the theater which would let me leave without hurting the feelings of those that invited me. When it comes to theaters, I wished in that moment that I was Abraham Lincoln. Being shot in the head, would have been an improvement to my movie going experience that night.

Now trust in me, I am a bad movie fanatic. If it received less than 40% reviews, chances are I have seen it, because I like to think critics review more with their wallet than with their mind. I have found gems, movies I could watch every single night and not be upset. Cats is the single worst movie I have ever seen. I have watched actions, comedies, musicals, romances, horror, supernatural, and you know what? Being as cultured in movies as I have been, I know that I hate the shitty romance ones that‚Äôs main sell is power dynamics, and I would watch every single twilight and twilight knockoff, along side every single fifty shades and their knockoffs without a break before watching cats again. I never ever even ever want to watch that movie again"

Literally if I could set up order of role queue, it would go mid, jungle, adc, support, disconnect, solo) but I tell you this. Satisfying is when the Achilles attempts to execute you and you hit him with a 3 just in time, preventing the kill and then dashing away just in time. Although honestly, I have only played herc solo twice, I play Baron solo instead because herc just doesn‚Äôt feel as useful"
