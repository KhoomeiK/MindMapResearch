gtaonline,fe6h782,t1_fe5xigq,1578890795.0,"  Depends how often you are selling special cargo.  If you do not have friends consistently helping you source and sell special cargo, dont buy a larger warehouse.

Get a vehicle warehouse and source cars.  Abort the anoying source missions by changing lobby.  Buy bunker (and supplies) and sell that product in between vehicle cargo.  Buy MC when you have enough to buy coke/meth.  

Then get nightclub and techs and just afk while watching tv in ur apartment and sell every 20 hours or so.

If you have an mk2 you can ignore all this nonsense, buy an arcade in the city, and grind the casino hiests.  After a few times the setup missions are very easy and you can avoid the longer ones by changing lobbies.

If you need some startup money and on ps4 PM me and ill host the hiest for ya."
