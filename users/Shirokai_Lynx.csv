AskMenOver30,ff9bw46,t1_ff8vxq3,1579709439.0,Its true. Were only here for a short time. Focus on the important things in life. Not money. Sorry for your loss btw.
AskMenOver30,ff9bptt,t3_es9pzu,1579709322.0,"To me work was always just a means to an end. I was never career driven, never wanted to be rich or famous. I wanted just enough to do what i enjoyed and have the things i wanted. Live the way i want to live. Im actually on disability now due to some unfortunate things happening. But im pretty happy with everything. I dont need a lot of money to be happy. We own our house and car and land. You know a lot of having money too doesnt mean youre in abundance. I have seen countless people spend beyond their means and be really super deep in debt. And for what? Just so they can have the newest shiniest thing? It probably aint any better than the other 20 thousand other shiny new things that came out that same month.

Point is everything we do in life is to work toward being happy. If thats not your goal then youre probably doing it wrong. Just saying lol.  True happiness i believe is learning to be satisfied with what you have, not constantly wanting something else. It took me about 3 or 4 decades to learn that but i finally have it now. Do what makes you happy not what makes you rich. If being rich makes you happy then do that. Main thing is dont compare yourself to others. Just do what you do dont worry about them. Theyll take care of themselves.

Best of luck to you man."

Just remember you do matter, anybody reading this please remember you do too. This life aint easy by a long shot but were gonna get through it.

If youre having a rough day please remember to be kind to yourself and be kind to others. It makes all the difference. Even a small thing that im sure that person didnt realize would make a big impact did. Remember that and pass it on. Even something as simple as a smile could save a life. :)"

Amithepushover,ferou7o,t3_eqenlm,1579356628.0,"I dont think youre a pushover if you say yes. It sounds like youre a good worker and you just genuinely want to help. But at the same time, remember the more you say yes the easier its going to be to say yes the next time and the next. Eventually you are going to have to say no and stick to it no matter who gets upset doesnt like it etc. Sometimes people will use you up if you let them. I used to be that person too but i finally realized its not selfish to look out for myself sometime too. I think you should probably say No but i dont know all the minute details either. 

I just feel like from what youve wrote if you say yes this time youll continue to do it.  You deserve to be treated with respect and theres other people there that can help. Let them carry part of the load too. Youre actually doing them a favor because if everybody pitches in the whole office will run better, get more done, less stress all around etc. 

Whatever you decide though i hope youll always continue to be a giving person. The world needs more like that. Take care and hope this helps. Have a good day and dont work too hard."

infp,fegc2fw,t3_eom9tr,1579087069.0,"Shojiiro and Kanii his feline companion surveyed the open plains enjoying what may be the last peaceful sunset before the village was attacked yet again.  The attacks had come more frequently lately since the bandits now knew the location of the scrolls. He was but one man and his cat was tired of his shit because it kept him from feeding him fish on a constant basis. Heroes pft. Who believed in heroes anymore? Silly humans...  If Kanii could speak hed probably tell shoji what a fools errand the whole thing was. Nobody even appreciated what was done. For every building burned, every child kidnapped the peasants would just be up everyday attending to the days needs like nothing had even happen. Not even looking at the trail of carnage left in their wake. Sometimes they reminded him of insects for all their singlemindedness. Perhaps there was something to be admired in that but he couldnt see it.  For every head of the beast  they cut off another one grew in its place. If not another head then another arm. They just kept coming and he wouldnt stop fighting, no matter the cost.   This was not his home, but it was as close as hed ever came to one. He wouldnt let them take that away from him.

When kanii would protest, Shoji would just look at him and say in his quiet way.Without saying a word. 

 This is what must be done. It is the only way i know. The way of things, the way of the blade the fist, the flow of blood that writ our history so far.  It is not the pages that matter, not the ink we write with but what is set out, what is left behind is not as important as what is set forward on the compass of our souls path.Or something like that,  Kanii always thought Shojiis eyes talked too much and needed to tone it back some... but he was a cat not a writer or a psychiatrist for the love of tuna.

Just another sunset, just another day.  Just another reason to keep his sword sharp and his mind sharper. Kanii cleaned his paws and stared off into the sunset trying to look busy but he was terribly bored with all this."

I have anxiety and it causes the usual constant automatic negative thoughts etc. In my particular case its not a matter of anything physically wrong with my memory. Its that my focus is all on these anxious thoughts. So it makes it hard to remember important things you actually ""want"" to remember sometimes. So if you are anxious or your mind wanders it may be possible to improve memory if you learn to improve your focus by weeding out those types of thoughts. Just an idea.

I mostly see their shape not the skin so much on a basic level. But i dont look for that anyway to be honest. To me personality goes a lot further than looks because over time that stuff fades anyway. You could have the most physically attractive woman in the world and if they have a bad attitude or personality that ruins it.  Try to stop thinking so much about physical appearance if you can, because when you get old thats going to make your life miserable. Im sure you look fine. As far as being superficial.

depression,fcf1sjh,t3_eh1hgi,1577625861.0,"Im 44 now. I was in a bad accident when i turned 27. Ill save you all the details but it involved a gallon of tequilla and me saving the rest of my body from injury with my face lol. I now have seven metal plates in my face. I was never a handsome guy to begin with or at least my anxiety depression etc told me i wasnt. So due to all that ive ended up spending 20 + years sitting in a room away from the world. I live through video games, movies, books etc. Its okay and luckily i love that stuff so my personality type allows for me to not be totally miserable most of the time but  it does get really lonely sometimes.. Nothing in my life is perfect but i kept going and things happened and I feel like as long as we keep trying there will be some good to come in life too. Even if its all bad. What i mean by that is ive had so much bad happen to me in my life that ive learned to look for the good in even that. How do you do that? You learn from it. It can make you stronger too.  You for example will learn what ive learned about people how judgemental and superficial etc they can be.Because we dont look like models etc. But you will also find a lot of diamonds in the rough as far as people  as you go.

Those people who only have their looks going for them are usually pretty boring and have a lot of empty space in their heads and wooden hearts. Im betting you have strong feelings about things and have a lot of heart. See those people who have it easy in life never get that. They never know what its like to come out on the otherside  of a huge sea of darkness. You have to work fro that. You're working toward something good thats going to happen to you right now even though you probably dont realize it.

Be kind to people, be kind to yourself. Only good can come of that. Dont listen to those automatic voices in your head that tell you youre not good enough. Dont listen to anybody else that would tell you that too because we all have wonderful things about us. Me included. I feel like a monster most times i feel so ugly. But do you know i managed to get married, have two kids and my son just got married a few months back?

This whole life is all about perception.  Its all in how you look at a sittuation. Whether its a blessing or a curse. I look at everything now as a gift. Because im there to get through it.  Im still alive. Thats a gift from God if i ever seen one. Sometimes when were in a sittuation we cant see the whole of it because were stuck in it. But if you keep going you come out on the otherside and you realize it wasnt all that bad.

Just like me, ive been on reddit for years, just hoping to find people to talk to, to deal with my own loneliness etc hopefully find a new friend. Does that ever happen?  Not really. Out of my entire 4 or 5 year reddit experience ive met maybe 2 or 3 decent people on this cesspool of a website lol. But theyre great people. One of them is one of the best people ive ever met. But the majority of people i meet on here make me want to stab my eyes out. Because theyre so cruel, thoughtless, uncaring and just plain mean. But you know what? Fuck those people. Thats what youve gotta say too. The hell with the people who make you feel bad. OUT! With the voices in your head that tell you that too.

What im getting at , is even in all this darkness on this website, at least for me. I can hopefully spread a little light and kindess. If nothing else it gives me the oppurtunity to do that. I hope what ive said helps even a small bit and youll do something nice for yourself today, do something kind for somebody else too if you get the chance. Seriously its the best gift ever!

Have a good day and smile. Nobodys ugly when they smile. Not even me. Im smiling now."

Needafriend,fcelfb5,t3_eh4x2p,1577621557.0,"Listen man its not even you, its this sub and reddit in general. Its filled with flaky people like that. Im sure not everybodys like that but the ones who are not get so burnt out because of the idiots, like the ones uve ran across im sure,  that they stop trying. Im actually leaving the sub now. Ive been on here for years on and off on different accounts and its always the same thing. Ghosting, people acting weird,high maintenance etc etc.  All these find a friend type subs are that way. Get off here, go out into the world and find friends there or at least a different website than reddit. Its a TERRIBLE place to meet people in my experience.Of course im over 40 and not from the midwest, california, or canada so thats probably got a lot to do with it.  If you want somebody to talk to online, find a penpal  site that doesnt look like a social media site with tons of pictures etc.  Ive met some really cool friends that way. But reddit. Kind of a dead end. Just being honest. Im sure people will disagree and thats fine. Only sharing my experience.

Also you can try some hobby type subs to talk about things you enjoy etc. That may be a better way to find some friends if you are determined to use reddit. But the only thing people really have in common on these kinds of sub is that theyre lonely and have no friends. Thats not much to build a friendship off of to be honest.

All my friends i have, i met through doing things ,hobbies etc. Never once met one that stuck around from talking about how lonely we were.  I wish you and everybody all the best and hope u find the friends you want and deserve.  But seriously fuck all you silly people that ghost, claim to want friends etc and then just be so damn annoying. Aint nobody got time for that kinda crap.

FriendsOver40,fcebeft,t3_eh426g,1577618901.0,"It depends on if you do anything. What i mean by that is the number one best numero uno way to make friends is through a hobby or interest. If you want friends, answer this queston. What would you do with them if you had them? Picture that, really invision it.  If you cant answer that then yes youll never have friends. But if you go out into the world.Even online and do something youre truly interested in. Over time you will find people. Dont concentrate on finding people though. Just do what youre interested in and have fun. It needs to be some sort of public thing though. Even if its just an online hobby involving other people. I use video games, because thats something i personally enjoy. But you could join any sort of hobby, meetup group, society etc. I think the key is to find an excuse to be around people long term.Its hard to make friends at the drop of a hat from one meeting unless you have social super powers. All my friends ive ever made i was around long term then over time we grew closer. 

Aspergers, no legs, no eyes, missing a head. As long as u got a brain and a way to push it in a general direction you can have friends. But youve gotta stop thinking like you are and you have to make an effort. Most people ive ever met on reddit over the years dont make an effort. This is the flake capital of the internet. So i wouldnt look for friends here no. Because youll be sorely dissapointed. But as far as finding a friend. Get out in the real world. Do what you love. Over time they will appear in your life. Just be friendly, patient and kind. No matter what kind of flaws you have, we all have them. Especially me trust me. But i have a few friends online, and i even managed to get married have kids etc. Im a complete recluse. You can meet and keep friends. But dont think youre doomed and believe in yourself. Also yeah the world does judge way too much on looks. I dont look that great either but fact is. You dont want friends who only like you for how you look etc. Because most of the time those people are pretty boring and not that interesting to start with. Especially if all they have going on is judging people based on looks it sounds like they need to get a life."

clans,fc8z17q,t3_ego8hp,1577544385.0,Just wanted to post and give these guys props. Really nice group of people. Stop by say hello and get to know them. Great group.
nofriends,fc8yf40,t3_egmph6,1577544099.0,"I was listening to old eighties country music earlier. I feel like that doesnt have a place in the world anymore but i still like it. I like seventies music too alot too. I remember when i was a kid things felt normal  it reminded me of thatand i dont mean in a things were easier kind of way. I mean like this reality now is not all that real. I miss real. I miss mistakes and seeing people that aint perfect.  Ive been sitting in a room for 20 years staring at a screen. So if you ever want to talk to a wierdo im probably that guy. I think at this point im a time traveler. Because everytime i go to town theres things there that werent there before.

I feel like what we are now is not what were supposed to be and who we were then is not even who we were supposed to be. What i mean by that is i think theres a path were supposed to walk on so we dont fall into the void. I think right now most of us are already in that void desperately realizing too late or at least we think so. But what ive started doing is just going back to a different place in my mind and trying to live there. I feel like i will never have a place in this world anymore. I also know i dont want one. Because this world and all its darkness sucks away any direction you might be heading. Thats the real thing with darkness. it kills the compass. You never get where ure going because i tries to tell you nothing really exists. So you sit spinning in circles.

I read a post earlier about how maybe all our thoughts are not our own. Maybe theyre from somewhere else. Maybe thats true. I wonder how much of us are really us? Do we even exist? I think about atoms sometimes bouncing around inside us and were just a bunch of atoms that got together got uppity and said hey ill be a human being today! I feel like the whole universe is just energy. Things bouncing off each other and when we touch another physical object we dont really touch it but we think we do. But who are we to even think because do we even exist? It feelsl like this life is like a giant pool game and everybodys trying to call corner pocket shots but i dont think it works like that. Because were not really the ones shooting the ball.

I learned a while back that its about asking better questions not looking for answers in life. But even then. Even if we do figure it out were not ""winning"" because theres no winning or losing in this. We just keep going. I think maybe when we die we just forget our place in the book and have to start reading somewhere else.

Id love to havea  friend like you. But yould change and then yould go away. Not even realizing it probably.  Besides that  you said it was stupid and i dont want to  make you feel stupid. I feel stupid enough for everybody lol. I think whenever somebody says something real/wise/true they always say its stupid or throw it away because theyre afraid of being right.  Nobody wants to be wrong but nobody wants to be right either. Because that takes time none of us want to devote to teaching others because they dont listen anyway right? 

I used to write poetry a long time ago and i always felt like the realest stuff of all was the stuff you burned or threw away at midnight nobody read. I say midnight like thats late but to me that seems like amateur hour. Its always 4 am here.

Anyway have a good day."

depression,fc8n7z6,t3_egdm43,1577538366.0,"The only thing that makes you a loser is ""thinking youre a loser"" . The only real losers in the world are cruel people. Be kind, be caring, love others and spread joy where you can. Then youre not a loser. Simples as that. Material things are worthless and there only true meaning is to bring the things i listed above into yours and others lives. Seek fulfillment, not happiness as its fleeting. Seek truth and not ""your truth"" and youll find what youre looking for. If you dont understand this post or disagree with it. Come back in thirty years and read it and youll understand."
GamerPals,fc86wzg,t3_egjs2r,1577528218.0," I just bought my friend a copy of Dont starve and i have that, we could check that out, im new also. I havent played in many years, never with a group. Were looking for a fourth for GTFO if youre interested in that at all. Havent played it yet so no idea how ti is. I have state of decay 2 but havent played it in a long time. Also looking for people to play some random coop games using steam remote if nothing else which is where you stream games to up to 4 players and they dont even need to own the game to play.

lonely,fc53hln,t3_eg8aw5,1577441216.0,Just want to repeat. That is NOT a friend.  I also wanted to add my own spin on it. That person did you a favor because theyre saving you from dealing with them anymore. Besides that people that ghost are lazy and cowardly idiots who lack any communication skills. You dont wanna be friends with an idiot do you?
