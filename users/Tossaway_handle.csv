I since went on to get electrical engineering and MBA degrees and Canada’s finest universities, and I regard “attention to detail” as one of my better skills. 

I was the only one with access to the till and I could never get that thing to balance at the end of the night. Half the nights I was over and the other half I was under. It was good to walk in another person’s boots for two months so now I never judge servers."
ottawa,fcw9g53,t1_fcpe1gi,1578020202.0,"SF resident here - ground zero for all these fucking gig economy apps.

The reason StD (or Uber Eats, or GrubHub, or whatever food app you use) has higher prices through the delivery apps is because the delivery apps get paid from both ends of transaction. The app providers pocket the delivery fee, and also shake down the restaurants 10-15% (probably less for big chains, more for mom and pop shops). In SF, It’s common to see three prices - the restaurant price, the Uber Eats price, and the GrubHub price. 

It’s interesting that the restaurant in question has its own delivery service and uses the delivery apps. Every restaurant I know of in SF that had delivery service canned it when they started with the app."

But after he failed to get re-elected, the calls stopped. He became a nobody overnight.  Didn’t work long enough for a pension. He had sold his practice to his partner and would have had to start from scratch.  There’s not too many successful people that want to take that risk.

I didn’t get the sense he was a dick, but then again I was a potential buyer of his business to release him from the misery that is retail in Ottawa.

I called Roger’s to complain and was told to kind sand. Contacted Apple and they refunded my money, no questions asked. Didn’t even care to confirm the web page.  

The good thing was that I never logged out of the app on my Apple TV so I guess my authentication did not lapse and I got to view the hobbled service for the entire year. Teaches those fuckers at Roger’s a lesson."
