It is rooted in the need to distinguish between European colonizers and the people they exploit, preserving citizenship and inheritance of wealth for the ruling class.

Once you understand that, you see why the Irish and Jews weren't originally considered white, especially by the British who colonized Ireland and are still dealing with the fallout. You see why Ben Franklin talked about Germans and Italians as nonwhites that shouldn't be allowed US citizenship.

The podcast even brings up court cases where a technically Caucasian man from India was not allowed to be classed as ""white in America"". The judge ""knew whiteness he sees it"", and really showed that the spirit of whiteness trumps any words on paper.

skeptic,fdykp0d,t3_en25ec,1578780800.0,"I've said it before: the antivax cult is hitting a major crisis point for their movement. 

They think vaccines are killing babies, and that the government is funding it. But no matter how much antivaxxers protest, the vaccines keep getting given to millions of kids.

This is the same problem every doomsday cult and fringe movement eventually faces as their predictions fail to come true. They can either give up on their beliefs, keep doing their ineffective protests, or double down and become more extreme.

This lady took the extreme option. And she will only become more convinced that she is a martyr as she is charged with crimes. And her friends will use her as proof of their righteous cause.

Yes, it's stupid.  But it's the same process many a cult has gone through, so we know it will happen."

Military,fdw9txy,t1_fduy0nd,1578756551.0,"When I read your comment, I cant help but think of how hard the US fought for the exact opposite. 

Our society really didn't want blacks, minorities, and women serving in the military for centuries bc it would legitimize their bids for full citizen rights. 

And I wonder how much that systemic discrimination poisoned the well, making potential recruits turn to better paying, safer alternative on the advice of older relatives who went through stuff like Vietnam."

You should watch this and then also see They Shall Not Geow Old, the documentary about British infantry during WWI. It's back in select theaters, and Peter Jackson did a great job bringing WWI to life for us in 2020."
BigCatGifs,fdw7wzs,t1_fdvytdk,1578755983.0,"You thought very wrong, and probably have a lot of false ideas about that part of Asia.

 Iran is on the edge of the Middle East that you have stuck in your head, and is much more than the deserts you picture.
It's a mix of mountains and plateaus, with lots of climate differences depending on latitude and elevation.

Just accept you had crappy geography teachers and do some actual research. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Iran

Edit: took the comment too seriously. Sorry.

Tl;dr Iran is a mountainous country that spans multiple climate zones, so it gets snow in certain areas."

The conservative base are purposely holding the Republican party to the ideals the president expresses, and won't tolerate attacks on their man. 

We gotta give up on this idea that they secretly want Pence. Trump is what they want."

European Empires always love the resource extraction, but hate when the brown people come to the homeland. At best, they claim to want ""separate but equal"", but in their hearts they want the symbols of power pure and white.

 We turned the CIA loose on them, and have been screwing with their energy needs ever since in retaliation for their defiance.

 Trump ending the nuclear deal despite the protests of our European allies is just par for the course for our imperialism-lite policy makers."
