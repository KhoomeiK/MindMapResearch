1) People get insurance through their job, it is what it is, and most jobs don't have a super cheap option like you pretend there to be.

2) most people getting it through the marketplace place will have trouble finding or affording plans like yours.
 
3) get the fuck outta here with your research bullshit."

I have a former* classmate that does this.  She makes over 6 figures at her real job, side hustle is selling shitty toothpaste.  Her facebook posts about ordering the toothpaste usually have 5 - 7 comments asking how to purchase, usually the first 4 - 5 are huns with 1 or 2 towards the bottom asking how to buy.  Of course, it's the toothpaste that pays off her student loans, not her 6 figure job."

iamverybadass,fec2aln,t1_feahd0t,1578965614.0,"Why can't it be real? Picture it, our hero minding his business, his mind (very) slightly distracted (he is a mensa man, so he can never be 100% distracted) by how most people in Iran don't speak English, when out of nowhere a hijab wearing Captain in armor tried to shove him out of the way.  Since he was only slightly distracted by non-English speaking Iranians in Iran, he quickly moved out of the way, deftly pushing The Captain onto the ground.  

The blow was so fierce it made him clutch his Medieval kevlar vest.  Right as The Captain was about to take out his transponder to call for help (the other soldiers left to get some Frostie's from Wendy's) our hero lifted his foot up off the ground, then let it hover inches away from The Captains face (our hero only deals in freedom units, not commie units).  With his foot motionless and inches away, our hero asked threateningly, ""Do you feel in charge?"" 

At hearing those 5 words, The Captain started bumbling and bawling like a baby.  Our hero knew he had defeated his foe, so he helped The Captain off the ground.  But, before our hero lets go of The Captains hand he leans in toward The Captain.  In a hushed, threatening tone our hero hisses, ""If I see you again, I'm turning your hijab into mittens.""  The Captain counts his lucky stars, in awe of what just transpired.  He knows he's lucky to be alive. 

As Farzad rounds the corner with The Captains Frostie, our hero leaves, back to pondering why so many fucking Iranians in Iran don't speak English."

legaladvice,fe8gd5p,t1_fe6pnuc,1578925845.0,"I'm not sure if this has been stated before, but the results are meaningless if the collection site didn't take the hair directly from your head.  We do drug scenes at my work, including hair tests. Every person has to sign like 10 spots attesting to various things.  As you didn't consent, there is absolutely no way there is a valid chain of custody form out there.  

Essentially the lab tested Someone's hair, yours, presumably, but it could be your mom's, your dad's, a siblings, a neighbor, the homeless guy down the street, the dog's, etc.  Without a valid chain of custody form I imagine a lawyer could have your name removed from the results pretty easily."

For a severe asthmatic it can last as little as 2 weeks but can go as long as 3 - 4 months or longer for those with well controlled asthma, though typically not more then 6 before they ""expire"".  

Maintenance medication like Flovent (inhaled steroid) is around $250 - $300 without insurance, and again $35 - $45 a month with it.  This typically lasts a month.  Other inhaled steroids are around that expense, or more expensive and last around the same amount of time."
