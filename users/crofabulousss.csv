dogs,fc6cdso,t1_fc6arkm,1577477282.0,"It's a dog, not a person. There is a difference. This is the excessive fear of death I was talking about, and people projecting it onto animals. Death is not the worst thing to happen to your pet, but prolonged suffering is. Dogs don't have the same concept of death that we do. The dog doesn't know what's happening and feels no pain. Unless you have some religious beliefs like your will go to hell or something, having a pet euthanized is a neutral action. It's neither good nor bad."
