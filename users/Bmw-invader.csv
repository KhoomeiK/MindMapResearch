futurama,ff3fqza,t1_ff3d18n,1579540136.0,It wasn’t about push native Americans out. It was about farming the land and growing the Mexican populous. That’s how it goes against what you said. Look like you said we are arguing in circles. I didn’t say anything degrading to you but I’m the asshole. Have a nice day bro.
futurama,ff3c6e7,t1_ff31lud,1579538261.0,"No, the entire thing started when Mexico invited American settlers to farm the land on the condition they become Mexican citizens. The Americans refused to become Mexican citizens kept the land and organized revolt against Mexico. Mexico was well within their right to stop the rebellion caused by the American settlers. 
It’s was Polks wet dream from the beginning to make the US span from the Atlantic to the pacific and Mexico was the only thing in the way. When he heard Mexico was letting Americans farm Mexican land he knew he would be able to convince the Americans to revolt instead of accepting the Mexican offer.  The winner always makes the narrative and it’s easier to say “Mexicans were doing illegal things so we went to war” instead of “we wanted more land so we forced a war against a weaker country”."
futurama,ff2hlle,t1_ff2c8dd,1579506479.0,"Yeah, but few others called the Native ppl they forced out “illegals,aliens,or migrants”. Ppl forget Mexicans are Native Americans. Most Ppl in the US couldn’t date their ancestry back more than 150 years here in the US. Basically a bunch of ppl with european ancestry telling Native Americans they can’t live in America. Most Mexicans can date their bloodline back 20,000 years to this land. Just cause land theft had happened before historically doesn’t make it right, especially considering how relatively recently it’d happened."
futurama,ff22vqm,t3_er164b,1579492318.0,"The US did to Mexico what Russia did to Ukraine except worse. 
Ulysses S. Grant said “I do not think there was ever a more wicked war than that waged by the United States on Mexico,” bc he knew the war was only about the US wanting to steal Mexican land. Nothing else. 
Grant later became a 4 star general and also elected president of the US"

Her pronunciation is what I’m talking about. She sounds like she learned a couple of bad words and a few quick phrases and blurts them out whenever she’s upset with a Hispanic looking person. Like I said, in my opinion I would bet she actually doesn’t speak the language. 
I might be wrong, but from how she sounds I’m betting she isn’t fluent.

todayilearned,fd7fh46,t1_fd47mgk,1578203648.0,"In Texas, at least, most ppl (88%) live in metropolitan areas. Texas has 5 of the top 20 largest cities in the US. These 5 cities have good public transport within city limits compared to other US cities. Even medium sized cities have ok public transport here in Texas. Most kids have designated yellow buses for school regardless if they live in the city or in a rural area. In my opinion the US is doing pretty good when I comes to public transport considering all the factors. But one major thing Europeans forget when talking about the public transport system in the US is how big the US truly is. Texas alone is about three times the size of the entire UK.

Im assuming the “shepherds” were the Lebanese migrants in Mexico?

This is bc the high elevation of Mexico City. 
Even though Mexico City does get cold during winter it rarely snows that far south. Whereas in Northern Mexico it snows quite regularly during winter despite the hot summers. The Gulf Stream makes N.A. winters colder than european winters."

pics,fc3kkop,t1_fc3i9ve,1577391871.0,I have to admit I’m wrong. My argument was based on misread information. I read an article that mentioned how much the upper middle class in Mexico made. I misread year as month. I was going off the info I read incorrectly. My bad.
pics,fc3hkrt,t1_fc3epzh,1577389959.0,that’s a like the lowest amount to be considered upper middle in Mexico. TIL. But I wonder what the average income of a middle class Mexican is. 50k seemed really low to me which is why I was going back and forth w/ you.
pics,fc3bze6,t1_fc39p5d,1577386434.0,Yeah im from the US so my view point might be off as well bc when I think of upper middle class ppl I think of ppl living really good lives financially. Not a doctor at a border town. I mean even if he’s in Mexico. Upper middle class ppl in Mexico live well and not the way this doctor is living. That is what I was trying to explain to the other guy.
pics,fc3bj1o,t1_fc3a5s0,1577386135.0,Are ppl living in Cumbres in gated communities rich? Cause I’ve seen plenty of regular and luxury cars pull into these type of gated communities. Wouldn’t consider the ppl living there rich. Better description for them would be upper middle.
pics,fc396fa,t1_fc373on,1577384490.0,"Yeah I’ve seen plenty of lobos when I’m down in Mexico. Wouldn’t consider the ppl driving them “rich” maybe middle to upper middle class. Rich ppl in Mexico at least in San Pedro Garza Garcia drive different types of cars. From, like you said, lobos to Ferrari’s. 
The difference is the person driving the lobo wouldn’t consider themselves rich next to the person in the Lamborghini. Nor would the person trying to get to the US, working as a doctor at the border consider themselves “Upper middle class” next to a person driving a nice f150 to their gated community. 
 I was generalizing by saying luxury european cars but that’s the first thing that came to mind. I guess what it comes down to is that “wealthy” is relative depending on the person."
pics,fc3644x,t1_fc347rk,1577382371.0,Exactly. I said the upper middle class and rich ppl in Mexico were few. I never said everyone was driving luxury cars.
