vegancirclejerk,fe8l6zi,t3_eo13tj,1578927425.0,Lol @ colonise space. No way is that happening.
vegancirclejerk,fe5v78f,t1_fe4sm2c,1578875688.0,"Yes. Now what if the child was fed a vegan diet? We don’t know what would have happened. So that is why I am saying you cannot say this is better than that possibility, except that gives veganism consistency and not something that people water down. 

And anyway, judging from your previous comments you said that merely having people talk about it normalises it in some way, regardless of in what light. So the same could apply here if it was more critical but to a parent who was consistent. Some people think it can’t be healthy for kids to be fed vegan diets.

Lastly, I am not sure staunch anti vegans will necessarily be swayed by “softer” forms or something. Perhaps they will never be swayed. Or they are swayed by stronger forms. The most important thing is to sway those who are more indifferent to the topic. One a sizable number are convinced it will become default eventually."
vegancirclejerk,fe4blih,t1_fe3ards,1578857627.0,"Because it is not relevant. You are finding a hypothetical example that is designed to be worse to compare this to, when I already said what this should really be compared to, which is the kid being fed a vegan diet, or honestly no comment about the kid eating bacon at all, instead of an outright anti vegan one.

I said at the beginning that there is no reason to think this comment normalises veganism (more than what people here would want which is consistency, I should have added)."
vegancirclejerk,fe1b9f7,t1_fe020is,1578824640.0,"I mean feeding the kid a vegan diet would be better than feeding it bacon. Those are the two thing I am comparing, not the upvotes and someone simply making fun of vegans."
vegancirclejerk,fdzildo,t1_fdx19x5,1578790556.0,"I am comparing it to the situation where the kid is fed a vegan diet, not something unrelated. But of course I cannot know but I don’t think there is any reason to believe that this would be worse than the actual situation."
vegancirclejerk,fdv3nf0,t1_fdt1sr9,1578742767.0,I guess yes. In this story though if the child was fed a vegan diet and was healthy that imo normalises veganism more than feeding it bacon.
fatlogic,fdv347n,t1_fdueksc,1578742672.0,You clearly like to jump to conclusions.
vegancirclejerk,fdsgwbf,t1_fdsbdph,1578702501.0,"I’m not arguing that normalisation is not a thing, but that in this particular example veganism is not being normalised, or at least there’s no reason to think it is. Obviously I could be wrong but the fact remains that the parents made the wrong decision if this story is true regardless of the reaction of people."
fatlogic,fds7tu3,t1_fdaabpv,1578696317.0,Depends on the source. Your vegan 4000 cals could be lower than an omiverous 2000.
fatlogic,fds7qy2,t1_fd9snzx,1578696265.0,Eat no meat. Production dominates emissions. Transport account for 10%. Imported vegan diets are better than local omnivorous ones.
fatlogic,fds7j3o,t1_fd95yla,1578696122.0,"First study: the biggest reason by far is social, nothing to do with health.

Second study said vegetarians (not vegans) who had creatine supplementation for 5 days performed better in memory tests while omnivores did not. This is nowhere near your conclusion that “vegans have worse memory.” Did you hurt your arm with that reach? Find some science that says the conclusion you are actually stating."
fatlogic,fds79wu,t1_fd9js2l,1578695954.0,"Cheese and eggs are not healthy. This is diary industry propaganda. These are foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol which raise your serum LDL levels, the main risk factor for the number 1 killer."
vegancirclejerk,fdrx8e7,t1_fdrcwz9,1578691102.0,"Yeah but why would anyone be against the situation described here? It is next practically next to carnism.

Re your comments about anti-vax: the equivalent would be people criticising it, not trying to cast doubt on the soundness of vaccinations. Imagine a parent who is anti vax but who vaccinated their children being applauded. That does not normalise the anti vax position."
vegancirclejerk,fdq60w5,t1_fdq08q0,1578656410.0,Zero evidence for this. They are upvoting letting kids eat bacon not veganism.
hempflowers,fdjyx43,t1_fdj4awx,1578491766.0,"Perhaps... if there are no other options, and not in a volunteer basis that is done now. You are just trying to find an excuse to hunt. It certainly shouldn’t be for a source of food. But reintroducing predators is one thing that can be done first."
PublicFreakout,fdhl3ia,t1_fdfpn5b,1578424938.0,"We don’t need to eat animals, therefore we eat meat for pleasure, therefore we kill for pleasure."
