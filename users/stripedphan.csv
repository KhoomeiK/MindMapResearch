phish,fdwbbgp,t1_fdwb1gh,1578756976.0,"Lol who are you the internet police? I haven't tried to change your opinion. All I've said is Other drummers were just as good as Peart. Music, just like your opinion, is subjective."
phish,fdw781f,t1_fdw68t6,1578755811.0,I think he's incredible. I think music is subjective. I don't think there is a best ever.

I have nothing but good things to say about Peart. I have good things to say about other drummers, too. When did I say anything negative about Peart?"
