worldnews,ff1gobh,t3_eqymf7,1579478941.0,To be honest thats all that matters. This impeachment is a publicity stunt anyway and everyone knows it. Trump is capitalizing on the hive-mind Democrats who have no case.

todayilearned,fdt1a9y,t1_fdsrfga,1578710621.0,If you use adblock its free music with no ads. Spotify plays ads.

AskReddit,fdpxtb1,t1_fdpxoc5,1578645103.0,I point out vilification of Dems too? I never said Republicans dont vilify Democrats. They do. You seem to have this illusion that I support Trump. I absolutely do not. I just called it out the vilification where i saw it.
AskReddit,fdpxipy,t1_fdpxhw1,1578644715.0,Yeah maybe tell your buddies to stop being shitters and we can all be civil. You dont call me names but the people you stick up for and defend DO. Im not  a Trump supporter or a Democrat so its YOUR funeral dont come at me.

AskReddit,fdpvvgf,t1_fdpvk2p,1578642648.0,The democrats are more face value? Yeah you lost me there my guy. All the Dems do is lie about Trump all day every day. Sure there are spite-based voters on both sides but they are a small minority in each. You treat Trump supporters like children who need guidance and you showed that in your first comment that I replied to. People like you have already handed Trump the victory.
AskReddit,fdpv6hx,t1_fdpv1eq,1578641811.0,"It would be Person B's fault. But your analogy still doesnt work. People dont vote for Trump to spite Democrats. I know its crazy to believe that people actually agree with him but its true and the more you act like Trump supporters are braindead morons the less likely it is that the Dems win. If you want to win, try persuasion not vilification."
AskReddit,fdpuksj,t1_fdpudtk,1578641094.0,Youre equating voting for Trump to jumping off a bridge. Thats the flaw in your analogy.
AskReddit,fdpu9sl,t1_fdpu74n,1578640734.0,That implies Person A isnt the idiot. Which if you ask me...
AskReddit,fdpu1ox,t1_fdp9pw4,1578640478.0,No no youve got it wrong. People like YOU are the reason Trump is president. Keep calling Trump supporters idiots and watch the Dems lose another election.

AskReddit,fdptaw7,t1_fdoxk4e,1578639633.0,This is why people vote for Trump. Stupid ass shit repeated over and over that is spoonfed to you by the corrupt media and you eat it up.
AskReddit,fdpt56u,t3_emhkiu,1578639459.0,"I will vote for Yang or Gabbard if they win the nom but if not Im going with Trump. Biden is a creep and I just dont align with Bernie on a lot. The others are like Warren and Bloomberg are jokes if you ask me who lack an actual plan for anything since its constantly ""ORANGE MAD BAD"" with them. I cant take them seriously."

dankmemes,fdit5nq,t1_fdisg0p,1578450469.0,This is probably the case but you never know for sure with terrorists. They dont seem to have much regard for their lives. See: 9/11.

dankmemes,fdinbwv,t1_fdimsyg,1578446744.0,Yeah now CNN and Fox News and CBS are all saying it was a ballistic missile attack.
dankmemes,fdimr9v,t1_fdimb5s,1578446376.0,That must be knew CNN was saying that they looked like rockets. That definitely changes things.
dankmemes,fdim9t1,t1_fdim4ua,1578446062.0,"I agree. It is extremely likely. Its also extremely likely its just some Shiite terrorists who want to support Iran especially since it seems like they were rockets, not missiles."
dankmemes,fdilwyo,t1_fdilsh6,1578445832.0,Ok but you dont know so stop acting like it. Bases in Iraq get attacked all the time.
dankmemes,fdildwk,t1_fdilb43,1578445493.0,They took credit for an attack. We dont know anything yet. Lots are skeptical.
dankmemes,fdil28y,t1_fdikyyr,1578445284.0,I meant on American soil.
dankmemes,fdil147,t1_fdi93qw,1578445264.0,I think they didnt do enough. Bomb any place that actively hunts American/NATO soldiers and houses terrorists.
dankmemes,fdikvju,t1_fdi9nci,1578445167.0,True but the likelihood that it will lead to that is small. We have airstriked plenty of terrorist before and Iran always chants death to America yet nothing comes of it.

AskReddit,fdi8g13,t1_fdhlwr7,1578437605.0,"This, in my opinion, is the cause of almost all human conflict. If people were just willing to admit they were wrong there would be way less fighting in general."
AskReddit,fdi80r8,t1_fdhss47,1578437384.0,"This is why that feature is one of the major causes for why there are so many echo chambers on Reddit.

todayilearned,fdgdhrj,t1_fdgd6m1,1578391568.0,Sure but its not just an extinction. The Earth will be destroyed by humans to a point where life can no longer exist on it. No animal is as capable and willing to destroy the only planet we have under the guise of 'well its survival of the fittest so fuck it.' Its not just 'natures way' when we are cutting down habitats and not treating Earth with the respect it deserves.
