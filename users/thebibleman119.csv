AskReddit,fefxcnf,t1_fefx046,1579068321.0,well the lagrange points are very real things we already take advantage of to monitor the solar winds and things like that. the gravity from the other planets are so insignificant (because of size compared to the sun and distance they dont effect much. the smart people who study gravitational dynamics usually know what theyre doing
AskReddit,fefs8i6,t1_fefs0dr,1579063654.0,and alternative to option 3 could be filtering all light with a wavelength below green so ot has the same effect while not being directly deadly and a little simpler (though as someone else said life on earth might not enjoy it too much either)
