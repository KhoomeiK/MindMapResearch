xxfitness,feh2v1c,t3_ep0nu9,1579107999.0,"Honestly? Not until somewhere in my 20's. Like 23 I think was the first time where I changed eating habits to lose weight, and all I did was cut out soda. 

I was a really active kid and was only 125lbs throughout my teenage years (I'm 5'4""). I went to a community college first so I didn't leave home and had a part time job that kept me on my feet, but when I moved cross country to get my bachelor's I got that freshman 15 that everyone talks about (I went up to 138lbs, so not quite 15, but you get the point). I cut out soda, went back to 125lb a bit, and then ended up settling at 130lbs for most of my school time. 

It was after school things started creeping up, I work contract jobs and said jobs had long work hours with not so healthy overtime food. Some jobs had free snacks and soda. I hit ~170lbs at my heaviest which was about 2 1/2 years ago (I was 29, almost 30), and that's when I decided to get serious about being active and eating better. I was pretty upset that I let my weight slip that much. 

Fast forward to now and I've pretty much been consistently 136-138lbs for the last month. My knee pain in my right leg is pretty much gone (I landed on it wrong while running so I don't think it'll ever go completely away, but it bothers me A LOT less now). I'm pretty much happy with my body now, I still have some fat I'd like to get rid of, but I'm not super worried about it."

fatlogic,fdlf4dt,t1_fdlcqbq,1578522672.0,"> You expressed that paying for parking was ""so dumb""

That wasn't me, that was a different user. I personally can't afford the parking prices for daily parking in Seattle, which is why if I needed to commute there for work an Orca card or paid parking would have to be part of the deal. 

> Can you tell me where that feeling comes from?

Just the fact that you were visiting a client and could probably schedule that meeting at some point in time that doesn't involve rush hour. And also a 25 minute commute to the airport from cap hill just sounds insanely fast. I doubt that short a drive would happen in bumper to bumper traffic."
fatlogic,fdlc1ip,t1_fdl1xn9,1578520811.0,"For you a car would've made sense for your trip, but I have a feeling you probably weren't in the bumper to bumper rush hour traffic in the morning/evening. It sounds like for /u/double-dog-doctor they're talking about someone that lives in downtown or at least somewhere in Seattle, commuting to somewhere else downtown. Where the bumper to bumper traffic in the morning /evening would easily make it take longer or at least the same amount of time as a bus.  I know for me on the east side the fact that the bus could use the HOV/Express lane is what saved that commute for me. 

Going to Seattle for me doesn't take that long without the rush hour traffic, usually 20-30 minutes. But as soon as you throw in that bumper to bumper rush hour it can take 45 or more, and at that point I'd rather be on the bus because it'll probably be at least moving in an express lane and I can entertain myself instead of  being trapped on the I-90 or 520 bridge."
fatlogic,fdkxwpq,t1_fdk53mi,1578513427.0,"A lot of companies in Seattle will provide a free Orca card, which works on the light rail and buses in the area. And getting a monthly Orca pass is about $100, which makes is immensely cheaper than paying $50 a week to park, and that's not even factoring in the cost of a tank of gas yet. (for me, filling my tank is around $45)

Personally, if I ever got a job commuting to Seattle (which for me, would be and hour commute via bus and maybe 45 min by car depending) a bus pass has to be part of the perks, or at least paid parking. I got a job on the east side and the bus commute and the car commute would've been about the same amount of time. But since that job gave me a bus pass I 100% used it, because I didn't want to pay the $235 a month for a parking pass in the building I worked at."
relationships,fdim3tl,t3_el5fpe,1578445955.0,"Wow, I just went and read the original post and that kinda reminded me of my Dad. He was never violent with us, but did occasionally joke about giving us ""the strap"" (a belt). He has bi-polar depression and would constantly give my mom the silent treatment, or blow up over really stupid shit. He never did anything to me really since I was only 16 when he and my mom split, but my brother (who is 7 years older) got some shit from him a few times. 

Like your husband my mom tried to get him to get help, but instead of saying he didn't have time, he insisted he didn't need help or he ""knew more than the psychologists did"". He went to therapy and stopped. He was on a depression medication that seemed to be working but stopped since he couldn't drink while on it. 

I'm really hoping your husband is admitting himself because he realized how much he fucked up and that he really does indeed need help and is going to go get it and wants to improve. I hope things go well for you and things turn around."
