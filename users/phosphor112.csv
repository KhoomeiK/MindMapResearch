Android,ff4kk73,t1_ff4i2bb,1579565855.0,"I have Davinci Resolve. I only use it when helping my wife edit videos she does for her business. Those are top tier video editing applications.

iOS 13 offers the ability to trim, rotate, crop, and adjust colors/filters of the max resolution of the device you are using. That’s all most people need. When I edit my personal videos, I’m not trying to add transitions, special effects, I don’t want to select a canvas size, what output FPS, resolution, video format, color depth etc. Give us the basics. Google can provide it. Sadly, they can’t seem to make the most basic of features these days. I’m sure their next Google IO, they’ll talk even more about AI features that we’ll never see implemented."

Roadcam,fdeqcuj,t1_fdd0gfo,1578344411.0,"I work in Radiology imaging systems these days, but before that, I worked with radiologists themselves. One day a guy got pulled into the MRI from the ER. Had an open front helmet, guy was riding with his girlfriend on back, when they got into a crash, she landed on him and her weight basically made his face rip off (jaw was ripped off too) from being grated against the road.

At times, I think about getting a motorcycle, at other times I think about how cool I’d feel just wearing jeans, a tshirt and boots on a bike, but then I just remember that image.

It’s like going to a fast food place, getting food poisoning then never wanting to get near the idea of that place ever again.

Yes, it's our fault they died. Someone else killed them, but we left their side and didn't turn to look back when blood spilled.

It's on us.

You're talking out of your ass."
worldnews,fd6l9nn,t1_fd6icop,1578192672.0,I should have put the Syrian qualifier on there. Pulling US troops out to get shit on by Turkey and let ISIS escape from prison. Many Kurds had to flee to Iraq to not get killed.
worldnews,fd699cw,t1_fd5yze3,1578187476.0,"Yup. They killed an ISIS killer.

Funny, weeks ago they get many Kurds killed. This week they killed Shia.

Make winnie into a hipfire gun. Keep ADS the same, but allow faster shooting and less recoil when hip firing. Anyone ever fire one of them in real life? Hell, I fired a 45lc version of one (much bigger than anything used back then) and it felt like I was shooting marshmallows because of how heavy the barrel is compared to the caliber its shooting."

I'm not sure how you don't understand that free will allows anyone to be defined the way they want. Just as someone who wants to be surrounded by hateful rhetoric (you know, their free will) defines that they too will be hateful.

Nice attempt at trying to put words in my mouth though. I like how you go from ""if you had the power too..."" rhetorical question to trying to poison the well with something I didn't actually say.

Good day."

Propaganda, misinformation, changes the definition of the word knowledge. We know this because facts themselves are being denied as being true. People who believe in hateful rhetoric have their own level of ""knowledge"" their own ""truths"" and ""facts"" they believe to be real.

Yes, those words don't ""rob"" their free will, it defines it."

InfowarriorRides,fc2xwv4,t1_fc2ttit,1577376956.0,"I never said it should be banned, though I'll answer your question:

I think most calls to violence should be banned. Including those in religious text. Religion is often cited by fundamentalists to persecute others. Look at the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, spread of Ottoman Empire, current day Jihadis, etc. My opinion is that religion is supposed to be used an instruction manual for how to live life, and is context sensitive. Any advocacy for violence, especially against civilians is a no-go. It's not compatible with a modern society.

This kind of leads to the whole Paradox of Intolerance. I think it's important to be intolerant of those who are intolerant of others. My family had fled Saddam's tyranny, not after losing family members to persecution. Allowing hateful rhetoric to fester and grow only enables those who want to justify their own hateful rhetoric.

Of course, for any of this to happen, we must change the constitution, which isn't easy to do."
