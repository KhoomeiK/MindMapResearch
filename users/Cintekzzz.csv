They push and push and pusb that same beat growing and growing until the build up is so much that your ready to explode and u just want to die. But then before your head goes pop the drop happens and you get hit with the relief. The pimple pop, the power wash a great piss you've been holding for a long car ride. 

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh......  Sweet relief. Maybe pimples arent the exact same for everyone and i think ppl like diff things for diff reason. Give me a nice pop on a mirror with some discharge. Omg this is so gross writing out. Im almost dont want this on my permanent reddit comments record.

There was more than 1 tume where ive heard the quiver in their voice as if they are worried that the DM might be listening to the Podcast and that they might come looking for the again.
