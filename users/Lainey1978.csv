If you watch breafkast on YouTube (and I believe she's a member here, too), she hasn't encountered them and she's constantly taking clothes out of the dumpster.

Personally I'd be more worried about cockroaches, mostly because I've dealt with those before (and they're a hell of a lot easier to get rid of than is commonly known).

ETA: I just have to kind of laugh at these people that are so horrified by how dirty dumpsters are. Do they know where vegetables come from? HORRORS! They're grown IN THE DIRT! With WORMS!!! And bugs and animals and their poop. 

Do they eat tilapia? Do they know what tilapia eat? Hell, *I* haven't been able to bring myself to eat tilapia since I went to see the hippos at the zoo."

He was also a bit of an actor. Like I caught him sitting on the dish towel once when he knew he wasn't supposed to be up on the counter. I gasped, and basically so did he (the cat version), looked confused and protested his innocence (through meows), like he had no idea how he'd gotten up there, but it wasn't him! He jumped down right away too, to reaffirm his innocence and status as a good boy.

He also used to meow at me when he saw spiders. And I was like, ""Those don't exist until Daddy's home to deal with them."" lol"
