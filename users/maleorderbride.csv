TikTok Admits It Suppressed Videos by Disabled, Queer, and Fat Creators. https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/tiktok-disabled-users-videos-suppressed.html

TikTok has been accused of secretly gathering ""vast quantities"" of user data and sending it to servers in China. https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-50640110

TikTok is paying the FTC a fine of $5.7 million for collecting the data of kids under 13. https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/28/18244996/tiktok-children-privacy-data-ftc-settlement

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6694671/amp/Predators-grooming-children-young-eight-popular-live-streaming-apps.html

TikTok's privacy page admits to collecting as much data as possible, from meta data, GPS location, and pulls all contact information on someone's Facebook and instagram (if connected) and phone, while allowing themselves to use this data for whatever they want.

https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en

TikTok has been labeled a ""threat to national security"" by the USA government.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rU0zzHKHxC8

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6jOJe9U9Wj8

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html

TikTok is banned from US Navy mobile devices, as it's been declared a cybersecurity threat.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/21/us-navy-bans-tiktok-from-mobile-devices-saying-its-a-cybersecurity-threat

TikTok had vulnerabilities as recent as last month, which allowed attackers to gain control of users accounts to upload videos or view private videos, while a separate flaw allowed attackers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the company’s website.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/technology/tiktok-security-flaws.html

Its almost as if TikTok is China’s attempt at pushing their propaganda out to the world while also having massive privacy issues. China has realized that to control the global population you have to control social media and what people see. So for the last year they have been pouring a ton of money into getting their social media app to be accepted and widely used- through a campaign of paid content creation/submission, and vote manipulation. Once they have largescale buy in, their backdoor monitoring and data collection will have free reign.

I find it a worrying trend how easily Reddit is blindly up-voting these video gifs and supporting a company with such privacy concerns, an obvious agenda, and that is censoring and controlling the information you see. It's not too late to do something.""

> 11) Omar Vizquel — As with Jones, he is an alltime great at his position. The 10-man ballot is the main reason he’s excluded, but the other is that his offense just wasn’t as good as Jones (82 OPS plus), even relative to his peers at his position. 

> 12) Jeff Kent — One of the best hitting second basemen ever, he just misses due to the limited ballot and average defense. 

> 13) Larry Walker — An amazing talent, he certainly has the backing of the analytics/stats guys. Very close, and just short of the top 10 here, mostly because he only played 145 games once.

> 14) Todd Helton — Another ex-Rockie who’s very close. Some might get the idea I’m anti-Coors, and I think it’s fair to admit it gets factored in.

Had set the clock to wake her up at five.

The thin charade does naught but make her shake

My body til it's clear that I'm awake.

She leaves with one from me upon the cheek.

When flurries flew, but now, to my dismay

There barely seems to be a flake at all,""

So once the car is settled in its spot,

I come to work to see what God hath wrought.

Prepared I am to stare into a screen

For eight full hours, a single break between.

For this I get the green to pay my debt

Like student, auto, credit card, and rent.

But once I have my break, I'll have the time
