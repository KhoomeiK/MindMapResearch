It sounds like your mind is *almost* quiet, and you just need to let go of that last pull of uncertainty telling you there's something you need to do, there's somewhere you need to be, there's something you're supposed to be doing.

Basically, you don't quite believe life is meaningless yet. You're still looking for something to move towards, some progress to make. Let go of that and just let existence itself be enough. Dissatisfaction is a choice you make--a judgement call you can choose to stop making."

nihilism,ff1zxwm,t3_eqmryr,1579490140.0,"Anxiety is just the belief that there's a problem you have to solve urgently (I think depression is related). You can get the same effects more simply by just removing the urgency behind your thinking. It's not the frontal cortex by itself that's the problem, it's the cortex triggering the amygdala that's the problem. Essentially, we behave as if our imagination is real life and try to react to it in real time as if it was a tiger. You can choose to stop doing that by accepting your thoughts as they want to come, and then changing them from URGENT, MUST FIX, to *here's one possibility, I'm just thinking away, look at my brain go.*

That said, exercise 100% helps create positive feelings. IMO stretching works better than weights or cardio though. I think that's why yoga is so popular. It really does make you feel good, mentally."
nihilism,ff1zgq1,t1_fevo2gq,1579489794.0,"> I think that the heat of the blast will provide you with at least a few seconds of excruciating pain before you lose consciousness and die.

Most likely the opposite actually. Have you ever put your hand in hot water and not felt the actual pain until a second or two later. Like, you know it's coming and you wait for the pain to hit with a bit of a cringe.

If you're in a nuclear firestorm, you're gone before you even register that you're going to feel pain."
nihilism,ff1yitv,t3_eqwli7,1579489121.0,"The Is/ought problem might interest you. Just because I understand and feel pain doesn't mean I ought to consider it important to treat others the same way I treat myself. I can cause pain in others while seeking to avoid it myself. In fact, a lot of people do this strategically, seeking to inflict the worst pains they feel onto other people in order to coerce or manipulate them.

Secondly, morality has nothing to do with a singular person and how they treat themselves. It's about how one person is supposed to treat another person or group of people.

Thirdly, I can understand something logically and still feel emotional conflict about it. For example, one of the main reasons I'm a nihilist is because I have OCD and persistent phobias. I always understand logically that my fear is irrational and I don't need to take it seriously, but that doesn't stop the fear from manifesting any less intensely than it does. Are you suggesting my fear of spiders and car mechanics is a good basis for moral thinking? I can understand my own insignificance while still seeking to avoid pain because it hurts. I understand why pain hurts and it makes sense that I would have evolved self preservation. That does not provide any evidence of significance or meaning."

nihilism,ff1xbrd,t3_eqve5l,1579488314.0,"I always like to think about the day after I've gotten what I wanted. Like, what is it you think being a big musician will do for you? What are you actually looking for, and will you have it the day after you realize, ""wow, I'm finally as big a musician as Jimi Hendrix!""

The honest answer is no.

At the same time, while you're here in existence it's nice to have something to do. If you turn it into a game to see if you can be as big as Jimi Hendrix, it'll be fun to pursue. If you NEED to do it, your whole life will be a panicked striving.

I think the key to living well is to do things because you want to do them, not because you HAVE TO do them. You might be doing the same things in either scenario, but ""have to"" means it's urgent, and you're stressed out, and you're striving. ""Want to"" means you can stop whenever and take a break, or lose your save file and all your progress and not be too upset.

Look for the glory of a high score, not the glory of validation and meaning. You may find moments when everything comes together and you believe, truly, that you have exactly what you want in this moment in time. But that is a temporary state, and a fleeting one at that. The struggle it takes to get there is not romantic. It's ugly and boring and that's why most people don't do it.

End of the day, you are suffering from the quintessential delusion that there is a goal to reach. Goals imply a mass of unpleasant work in order to pass a finish line and rest. But there is never a finish line. You will never rest. The goal always runs away. Learn to look for processes you enjoy, and let them produce whatever they will."

They are though. I don't have any reason or obligation to treat anyone's suffering as important. I would say you're projecting your own emotions onto the situation.

> You don't need god for that, you only have to realize that another person's broken leg has the same negative value as your own broken leg.

This is also a good reason to break people's legs on purpose. You understand that the pain inflicted gives you power over them."
