stopdrinking,feog5m2,t1_femo307,1579299632.0,"You are welcome. No matter how long I have been sober, I am constantly still learning about getting & being sober. I don’t see that ever fucking ending. But its OK."
stopdrinking,femiov9,t1_felv4er,1579257581.0,"Morning u/MiracleWeed! I used to think like you, defeated by myself & our disease. But I got some serious alcoholic education! I wanted to know everything about it. Information is power to me. Eventually I was able to restack MY Cards & take back control of my life. And this has been much better for me. Good luck to you."
stopdrinking,femi6yh,t1_fem0xxm,1579256854.0,"Hey there u/___twofifteen! My first Sponsor back home in Coronado in 2013 said this to me when I recited everything you said above: “Just go to the meeting, sit there & listen. You don’t have to introduce yourself or talk. Take from what is said in the meeting, only those things that you think will help you. Leave the rest in the room. Just go & listen. Then go back the next day.” I wish you good sober luck. This isn’t easy, what we are all trying to do, but I can guaranfuckingtee you, that it is *not* impossible. I have to think that if *I* can get & stay sober, so can you. That was on Day 10 of my very 1st attempt at putting alcohol behind me."

I got ocean blue eyes & I’m quite the fluff if I do say so myself. I likes to lounge around on cool hardwood floors & I hate me some house plants. I’m mostly white, on the short side, but I am very, very L-O-N-G, if yous catches my drift. Sometimes my front legs want to do things but my back legs need a minute or two to get the signal. That’s how long I am up in here! As you can see from my picture, I am Freakin Gorgeous! I am looking for ladies of equal beauty & Floof. I like long ladies that can drape across me like a feather boa. I no care bout fur color, eye color or toe bean color. Really, I NO care! It’s length that matters to me girls. All interested Long Ladies can apply through my Agent at u/w4llfl0wer. Later ladies..."
cats,fekorpr,t3_epi5jh,1579204481.0,"Aurelia’s Singles Ad: Hi there. I’m Aurelia. You can see from my picture that I am a golden, blond beauty. Some say I remind them of Pikachu. Some a Chicken Nugget. I like my Ranch Sauce on the side for future reference. Still others say I am like a Teddy Bear. I’m pleased to say I’m neither! I descend from Britain in the United Kingdom! Don’t most Queens? I mean really! My Antecedents have won many awards for their great beauty. I am gentle, calm & I always feel like smiling. I am looking for a Ginger Lover Boy to call my own. A protective man who wants me and only me in the bedroom at night. I like nose boops & cool, rainy days perfect for snuggling. Having black toe beans is a plus, but not a game stopper for me. Interested Lover Boys are welcome to apply through my agent u/Spartarner."

AskReddit,f0n9cmv,t3_d5k6zd,1568764032.0,"I happen to be a master at this exact thing. If I don’t leave a room with people laughing I am disappointed I’m myself. It is my secret gift. I think the reason my husband married me all those years ago is because he was playing a show with a very famous person at the Trump Casino theater in Atlantic City NJ. I went back up to our room for a minute and left The Husband in the bar after the show. Out of the elevator I went straight to the bar & got another drink. The bartender chatting me up said, “Are you impressed with Mr. Trumps Hotel?” “No”, I said, “I think the reason the boy has so much money is because he’s fixing the fucking elevator with duct tape!” And indeed the window/mirror in the elevator I was just in was patched up with duct tape. The bartender lost his shit laughing so hard! Upon returning to my future Husband he said what the hell did you say to the bartender to make him laugh so hard. BOOM! Marriage proposal a month later!"
