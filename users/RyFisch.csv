xboxone,fecczqi,t1_fec9ecl,1578971026.0,Completely agree. It's slowly becoming irrelevant. Brings tears to my eyes honestly. Buddies coming over and smoking weed and eating junk food all while hyping over the E3 conferences.

AppleWatch,fds9g4n,t3_d6yq4o,1578697412.0,This is absolutely ridiculous. I stumbled upon this thread after upgrading from a Series 4 to a 5 today. I'm heavily considering sending the Series 5 back because the auto-brightness dimming is so terrible. The watch is barely readable in low-light conditions. Super disappointed with this oversight.
