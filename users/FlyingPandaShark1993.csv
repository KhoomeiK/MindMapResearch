cringe,fep6w42,t1_fep2a5k,1579313481.0,"... okay, you are getting really heated about this. I DID support her, but then she started stepping back on Medicaid for all, the Green new deal, and then this happened. I did what any person would do. I looked at her record, I saw a pattern, I became uncomfortable. So I did research, I changed my opinion and I switched my vote. And this interaction with you has kinda solidified my decision. 

The only TRUE thing we know is that we don’t actually know what was said or interpreted. I’m sorry to poke holes in your arguments, but grasping at straws and insulting people isn’t going to make people want to listen to you. 

Look, He never told Warren to stay out of the race. He encouraged her to run in 2016. He’s encouraged lots of young American Women to run for office and the presidency since 1986. He even points out that Hillary got the popular vote. If you really think Bernie is a sexist and Warren is telling the truth, then you have nothing to fear by comparing their track records.

One thing I hope we can agree on, whatever the outcome, we still come together to get Trump at of office."
cringe,feogo7r,t1_feoalor,1579299930.0,"It’s funny cos I was actually going to vote for Warren, then this “he said she said” happened. Then I started looking at her other lies in politics she’s guilty of. You’re misquoting what’s been alleged. CNN and Warren said and I quote 

“Sen. Bernie Sanders told Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency, sources say.”

That’s way different than “I think it would be difficult for a woman to win the presidency”. One is based on factual evidence and a neutral admission of reality; the other is plain outright sexist. 

So which is it? Which did he say now? Yeah I would expect this actually. CNN wants to confirm the story they ran with little evidence and are trying to save face. 
As is Warren."
cringe,fenl2jf,t1_fenhza4,1579286979.0,"These other four “sources” weren’t in the room.  And they are all people who work for Warren and probably want her to be president. She could have said he was vehemently racist too and you’d believe her.

Objectively this is bad reporting by CNN; they ran a source with a credibility issue (Warren has lied in the past), with four anonymous sources that received the information from the original source (Warren). So you’re not taking the word of five people, you’re choosing to believe Warren. 

I think you immediately think Sanders is a liar BECAUSE he’s a man. You shouldn’t believe ANYBODY, because it’s all gossip “he said-she said”."

My conversion is 1,000 credits = 1 BP
So a starship build requiring 135 BP would be 135,000 credits. It’s actually kinda fun to watch my players budget their loot for “The Ship Fund”

I have them on Akiton and they think it’s a dump and are saving up to leave. Good thing there are plenty of job postings that pay well ;)"

politics,fehyy3f,t1_fehtg9w,1579126692.0,"Smh, This is why journalism is dead.

It’s suggestive questioning practices; it’s a disputed presupposition touted as fact. It’s giving credibility to a source that has none. An unbiased question would have been “to those who think a woman could never be president; Senator Warren, what would you say to them?” 

I’m not gonna try and change your mind, I’m only trying to get you to understand how to recognize bias questioning. It’s subtlety is what influences an audiences perception of a story. 

CNN asking Warren to confirm  HER statement in a story THEY wrote is a bias circle jerk."
politics,fehrnzv,t1_fehdw3s,1579122524.0,"Really?! Lol let’s flip the scenario and see how you feel; 

Sanders comes forward and says “Senator Warren told me America isn’t ready for a Jewish President” CNN runs the story, citing 4 of Sander’s political managers coming forward as anonymous figures that heard it only from Sanders after the meeting. 

At the debate the moderator asks “Senator Warren, why did you say America isn’t ready for a Jewish President” obviously her response is “I never said that” the moderator continues. “Senator Sanders, how did it feel when Senator Warren told you America wasn’t ready for a Jewish President?”

Now, how would you react as a person voting for Warren?"
politics,feg0wmh,t3_eot94e,1579072198.0,"I’m not buying that spin. Warrens team Okay’d that supposed “private talk” leak. She saw a chance to whip up support with a false narrative and CNN abided with that blatantly obvious hit. Bernie won’t stoop to that level, but don’t go pretending Warren wasn’t firing shots across the bow. 

He went in to reconcile and shake her hand and she flat out refused. This is all so F-king stupid"

Well hot shit, we got a human lie detector. Pack it in everyone we don’t have to verify things anymore. This person’s a HUMAN LIE DETECTOR. 

Bernie’s running again because he already has the voter base and support from running last time, he put the work in to build a movement. It would make no sense for him NOT to run."

Pathfinder,fe51j6h,t3_emebsd,1578864825.0,"No, the point of the game is to have fun. I’m not gonna pause an encounter for 20-30 minutes so the player can be a Rules Goblin. If the GM makes a ruling, the players should respect it. 

Reason being: if I let the Rules Goblin do it once, you can bet they’ll do it throughout the session. It hinders the game to argue over rules anytime a RG wants to and it holds the other players hostage.

I was GMing once and these two players (both RGs) got into it about what one of their characters were allowed to do. I made a ruling, but they both ignored it. It was a small enough ruling where it didn’t really make a difference if they were right or not. After 5 minutes of their arguing, I was like “fuck this I’m gonna grab some beer from across the street”. I came back 20 minutes later and sure enough they were still hunting and arguing about the rules. 

My other two players on their phones, waiting to get on with the game. SO FUN"

My parents separated when I was 4 so if I could give any advice it would be this.
(Note: until you know FOR SURE they are getting a divorce, I’d hold off on worrying. “When you worry, you suffer twice as much...”-Ghandi )

But, don’t hold your emotions in. You are not responsible, your feelings are still valid. They still love you, but there’s nothing you can do if they decide to live apart from each other. They both will still be in your life."
