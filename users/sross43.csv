The theme of The Last Jedi wasn’t subverting expectations, it was that we have to learn from our past and our mistakes or else they will haunt us forever. Only people unfamiliar with Rian Johnson’s filmography think subverting expectations was a theme, because every single one of his movies is a twist on the genre he’s operating in.

You said that hoarding large amounts of personal wealth is inherently unethical, and I agreed with you and then said that’s a problem we’re always going to have. But, to your point, governments and their corruption absolutely do affect income distribution—they decide what business is undertaken in their countries, how their businesses/workers are taxed, and which people receive coveted positions of power. Countries that most identify with workers movements and citizen equality are also almost always run by a ruling class of oligarchs.

The “male vs female” gaze aspect is important; for a good example, take a look at the Amazon costumes made for Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman vs Justice League.

But no, I don’t tweet, I save my shitposting for reddit. That is a funny logical ringworm you’ve got going there. Like if I said I wanted people to donate to a homeless shelter in lieu of birthday gifts, would you be like, “LMAO, are you a homeless person?”"
StarWars,fdt0oui,t1_fdsyp8i,1578710405.0,"Again, with the weird internet justice when you’re trying argue away his culpability like a defense attorney. He knows exactly what he’s doing—he’s petty, not stupid. He’s the popular girl who had a band kid say something mean to him in the bathroom and then went and told the whole school how terrible the band kid is. 

For the record I don’t even approve of hating tweeting celebrities but I can appreciate the power imbalance John is exploiting"
StarWars,fdsxgca,t1_fdswmou,1578709204.0,What’s with the internet mob justice fetish? Is it that hard to comprehend a person with 35 followers criticizing a celebrity and said celebrity turning his twitter mob of millions on that person is maybe not an equitable trade?

Absolute legend. And not, you know, a really disturbing thing to do by someone who’s reach is much greater than the fans who tweeted about him."
StarWarsCantina,fdstucw,t1_fdslqd0,1578707864.0,"People keep saying that the people he’s doxxing were being racist, which doesn’t seem to be true despite the mountains of racist hate he’s received before. 

Instagram: “Hey John, it makes me a little uncomfortable when you’re talking about the character your platonic friend plays in really sexual terms considering it’s a movie for children” 

Twitter, apparently: “That’s actually really fucking racist”"

I might be confused but it looked like there might have been some minor digital editing. If there was, though, it didn’t take me out of it so I’m on board. Also, great movie. I thought it would be Bruce Willis as the wiser, older version of himself mentoring the younger and instead got a twist on the “Would you kill baby Hitler?” question"
AskReddit,fdpdfrf,t1_fdp9lx2,1578625822.0,"This post reminds me of my childhood friends who voted for Trump who think CNN and MSNBC are all propaganda, but think Fox isn’t. It’s all a machine partner. Once you realize that those people screaming on the television aren’t actually outraged about your socioeconomic concerns and are just trying to fill a 24 hour news channel in a way that gets the most eyeballs on their adverts, you’ll gain a lot of chill. 

The Fox News panelists living in Manhattan don’t care how many South American migrants are waiting at the border. The MSNBC panelists don’t care that Trump is a creepy pervert who cheats on his wives—their bosses do the same and worse. Outrage culture is money, and anything to illicit it is valuable currency. 

I voted for Clinton, but I told a man on a train in Germany in 2017 that Trump would win the next election when the media takeaways failed to acknowledge that the last two decades of globalization have energized the cities and destroyed rural America.  Trump voters said their factories and stores were shutting down and their communities were being overtaken by drugs and poverty, and Clinton voters said the global economy has brought the country into a new generation of growth and progress. Neither group was lying, the truth depends on where you live."

There’s something seriously wrong with this sub where anytime anyone suggests that greater representation of all types of people in movies benefits everyone, and then people are like, “Akshually, representation isn’t an issue and Hollywood is completely fair, and the best person always wins the role, and get outta here with your bullshit.”"
