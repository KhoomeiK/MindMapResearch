Hey, way to completely miss the point of what I said! I'm seeing a trend here!

>I'm just confused as to why there isn't public outrage at the molestation of students in school. Oh right, probably because it's way less common given the numbers of students enrolled in school.

Every study I've seen indicates it's *more* common in schools, percentage-wise. The different studies range from saying that [10 percent](https://www.nheri.org/child-abuse-of-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-students-evidence-philosophy-and-reason/) to [15 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/us/silently-shifting-teachers-in-sex-abuse-cases.html?auth=login-google) of students will experience sexual misconduct by school employees, and it mostly gets brushed under the rug.

>But sure, continue to claim that because there are pedophiles outside of the catholic church that there is nothing wrong with it.

Wow, yet again blatantly pretending I said something that I didn't say! What an unexpected thing for you to do!

>Any answer, besides ""Yes, the systematic sexual abuse of young boys in the catholic church is disturbing"" is wrong.

Do you honestly think I don't think sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, and its cover-up, is disturbing? Are you so thick-headed that you completely ignored all the actual things I said and went on thinking that *this* was my argument? Of course it's disturbing! 

But to use it as an argument to say that churches suck, period, completely ignores that it's not exclusive to churches. 

Predators seek out kids. Organizations that cater to kids have done a terrible job of preventing predators from entering their ranks, and often do everything they can to cover up their own negligence. This has nothing to do with whether it's a church, or a public institution, or a privately-funded organization."

That’s never the actual reason those movies fail though. Fury Road was a success, as have been many other movies with female leads. Heck, it’s worth noting that the only recent Star Wars film that *didn’t* make bajillions upon bajillions is the one that *didn’t* have a female lead.
