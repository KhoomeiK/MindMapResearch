Also what I’m saying you probably already know so I’ll just tell you the easiest ways to do it.

Before going to Kellogg, you need to find Nick Valentine and then get the key for his apartment in diamond city which you get from the mayor (Once your in his house, press the red button under the desk to open the secret room).



Kellogg uses stealth boy so you can’t use vats. Obviously close range weapons or melee weapons are the best for killing him. Also while getting to him, there’s many synths and turrets which are annoying.

When you want to go to the glowing sea, make sure you wear power armour and what I did, I used the brotherhood of steel one rather than the one at sanctuary as it’s stronger.

Although I encountered 2 deathclaws, 4 rad scorpions and about a pack of 10 feral ghouls, I wasn’t too worried.

Make sure you take slot of stimpaks and RadAway. If you don’t already have a good melee weapon, in diamond city buy the ‘super sledge’ for 600 caps which is slow but it does 94 damage, use it to kill deathclaws and scorpions.

Also, don’t be worried of super mutants. They’ve got a decent amount of health but you should be able to deal with them.
