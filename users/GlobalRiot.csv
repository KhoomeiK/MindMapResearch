AskReddit,ff4z7bg,t3_ergjyj,1579576000.0,"Not sure I can remember the details exactly.  But, I worked in a mall clothing retailer.  Lady comes up with a stroller and wants to return something.

Thing is, returns are done downstairs and the opposite side of the building. Not at any kiosk. I informed her how to get there.

She got upset and we went back and forth a few times.  She's pushing a child and can't walk down there, I showed her the elevator right behind me.  Etc, etc.  Just a bunch of bullshit to where I just walked away from her and the register.


Shit you not, 40 minutes later, she's getting walked though my area by a supervisor and, when he's not looking, sticks her tongue out at me with this grinning face. 


I know she got some store credit to appease her.  But, I still think it was a win because she still had to walk to returns, spend 40 minutes, and I didn't get in any trouble.  My direct supervisor laughed when she mentioned it and my coworkers all gave me praise.


People are such self absorbed assholes sometimes..."
