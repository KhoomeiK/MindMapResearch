The anecdote I'm familiar with was that some guy was caught on CCTV speeding through an alley and hit someone in his car. If they were injured but survived he would have been responsible for a huge amount of medical bills, so he ended up backing up and running the person over like 4 more times to kill them.

ChicoCA,ffah1d8,t1_ffagh96,1579735554.0,"Well, we never reported the officers actions. My girlfriend had been through a lot leading up to that, which was bad enough.  On top of it, her losing her job meant we had a week to move (in early 2019; think of what finding a place to live was like), and I work two jobs so I had zero time to deal with it. She hit a solid wave of depression for a few weeks after and it's taken her the better part of a year to recover.

So, basically, the idea of filing complaints against the officer was brought up to us, but she/we didn't have the emotional energy to deal with it at the time. And by the time we did I have no doubt that any body-cam footage would have been retained.

Besides, we had tried filing a complaint with Chico PD in the past when we lived on the other side of town and after meeting with an officer for about 30 minutes we were given a run-around story and the blame was pushed off onto dispatch. So it honestly would have fallen on deaf ears."

It wasn't even a large amount of money, the guy took all $8 of cash she had. She wishes she had never called the cops, which is not the view the public should have.

To make the situation worse, the officer came to our apartment (NO CLUE how she found our apartment) a few days later and there was some dispute about whether or not she had permission to enter, but she sure as shit didn't have a warrant and came alone and went through our apartment - again looking for alcohol - while my girlfriend kept telling her to leave. And then a few months later my girlfriend called in an attempted break-in at her new job (they saw a guy cutting the fence during business hours) and the same officer showed up for that and had the gall to tell my girlfriend something along the lines of ""oh, wow, you managed to get another job"" which I think is well beyond the scope of being professional.

I had generally had positive situations with Chico PD in the past - like, if we were partying too loud one officer would come by and be like, ""hey, don't do that"" and that would be it. But lately their presence seems diminished and - when they do show up - extremely hostile to anyone present."

BCFAC is like every other post I see when I actually bother to get on Facebook, and the whole needle bullshit is getting stale.

On the other hand, Chico PD is doing a pretty shit job lately. Girlfriend got robbed at gunpoint while at work in April, took Chico PD 2 1/2 hours to arrive. Then they threatened to arrest her because the officer thought she was drunk (which she wasn't but when she's in a stressful situation she occasionally disassociates and can appear to be under the influence; but even if she was, are drunk people now not allowed to report being robbed?), forced her to take a breathalyzer but wouldn't let her use her inhaler mid-panic attack so she was unable to complete the test, searched her office for alcohol, and kept her hand-cuffed to her office chair for 3 hours until management showed up to relieve her of her keys which got her fired. Also, according to [The Chico Crime Map](https://crimemap.chicoca.gov/Crime/Map) (unless they botched the date/time it's listed on there), her robbery wasn't reported, [though the news stations reported it](https://www.actionnewsnow.com/content/news/Chico-Police-Searching-for-armed-robber-suspect-508934241.html)

Now, maybe it was different than I remember when I was a student, but I feel like I regularly saw Chico PD vehicles all over town, and lately I see virtually none. According to some stats I saw, Chico PD has about 2/3rds the officers per-capita (pre-Camp Fire...) compared to the national average, and every time I see Chico PD respond to something, 5 cars with 7-8 officers show up. So maybe they could use resources more effectively if they didn't arrive in a posse and hang out for a couple hours at every thing they do eventually decide to arrive at.

Now, I'm just a citizen, no experience working in law enforcement myself, but I think they can do better, too."

These new systems involve multiple inputs all requiring having matching values, and stored data within a system is stored in multiple locations in memory so that events like bit-flips don't trigger unintended consequences. And if a value is found to not line up, the system is reset to a determined safe output (in this case, cutting power).

I design/build/manage systems (ERP/Bus-int/RADIUS, legacy systems, etc) along with our public facing websites (www, customer portal, etc).

However, I'm also the only dedicated web developer in the office. So, while a couple other folks around here could probably hack together some HTML in a pinch and they can figure out some basic Javascript, dropping any of these folks into, like, MERN, would be impossible.

We're also in a rural area that I chose to move to specifically because of the nature around us, nearby national parks (girlfriend and I go camping almost every other week during the summer), short commute (12 minutes on a bad day), and small-town vibe. There's some tech folks here, but not many because it's not close to SF, SD, or LA. But that also means that there's not a huge developer community where you have hundreds of folks experienced with advanced stacks, so if I built with MERN and dropped dead tomorrow they'd be weeks, possibly *months* without a developer.

So, I've intentionally kept our tech stacks limited to something the guys I work with can understand. We've got jQuery and a couple very-well-documented libraries I've built. We run PHP with a lightweight framework that makes sense to someone with a year or two of development experience. This worked out well in my favor the other day where our public-facing website needed an urgent update and I was out-of-town and had zero access to a laptop; one of the guys was able to remote into the box, and after a couple minutes of staring at the code was able to update the website (in live...). It was a bit of a bitch rolling those updates back into the dev branch and then pushing it back into live, but w/e, it worked in the moment that it needed to.

That doesn't mean I haven't played around with React, Vue, Laravel, ASP, .NET, and it doesn't mean I'm gonna stop. But here's the thing about cutting-edge tech: it's always changing. So if in 5 years you've got an itch, I guarantee that there's gonna be some new hotness that you can pick up and have just as much experience on as the next guy because it's only been out for a year.

So no, I don't worry and I don't think you should. There's always gonna be some rabid evangelists for new tech, posting on Medium about how they've got 600 commits in 600 days, or how <some tech you've never heard of> is the greatest thing for development."

Ya know, I completely overlooked this fact too. I know all about how there's gonna be a huge protest, but I have no clue what the gun bills that are being proposed are.

So, the best information I could find was that there were several bills that cover different things. Most are expected to pass. I don't have time to dig through their whole collection of bills to find the actual language, but most summaries state something like this:

>...universal background checks; bans on assault-style weapons and bump stocks, as well as sound suppressors like the one used in the Virginia Beach shooting; requirements to report lost or stolen firearms; and expanded authority for local municipalities to regulate firearms, including in government buildings 

There's also talk elsewhere of grandfathering in existing guns (so long as they get registered), limiting magazines to 10 rounds (though, again, existing magazines can be grandfathered in), restricting age to purchase firearms to 21 years, etc.

Now, granted, most of the sites with this information are trying to scare you and rile you up to donate to them so they can fight the cause for you - so there's an obvious financial interest on their part. And I believe today is the first day of the legislative term, so these are bills being proposed - they haven't actually been voted in as far as I know - and any crackpot can propose anything.

But, as an example, for every person buying a Model 3 Performance, you've got another...I think 14 who would rather save the money and get a lower trim.

The point where an EV motor starts becoming inefficient is at speeds above what most of us should be travelling at to begin with.

What we'll likely see in the future is the halo cars continuing to hold at 450-650hp and getting lighter. A Tesla Model 3 Performance is already faster than almost any street car it'll find itself next to at a light, so imagine that same performance with 800lbs shaved off because of a battery chemistry breakthrough as that technology improves.

And if renting became a more viable option, pressure on homes would come down, opening up that market.

Instead, we have local builders sitting on 5300 permits for homes to build (in a city with ~35,000 living units) and aren't in any hurry to build anything because the longer they sit the home prices keep going up. Meanwhile, every apartment complex is packed to capacity."

earthship,fek66nv,t3_epkl5c,1579193438.0,"The energy efficiency tips for an existing house:

You can close most of the distance towards an earthship by lowering your thermostat in the winter and raising it in the summer. We keep our place at about 68 in the winter and 78 in the summer. Our energy bill goes up and down by about $40/mo when we go from deep winter or deep summer into a spring or late-summer weather where we can have our windows open and the thermostat off.

Next up is your water heater. They consume a *ton* of energy to heat water that goes right back down the drain. Take shorter showers and you'll conserve both water and energy. Additionally, turn down the heat on your water heater, and if it doesn't have an insulated blanket around it get one - they're about $30-40 and you'll typically get your money back within about 8 months (I've literally done the math on this for a building systems class). Budget and a bunch of other factors in mind, a tankless/inline water heater is even more efficient, they typically pay for themselves in 4-7 years (depending on your climate and usage), but not everyone can retrofit one and they have a pretty high starting cost.

Overall, temperature regulation and water heating account for about 2/3rds of the average home energy usage throughout a year, so there's huge gains to be made here.

Now, small stuff:

Weather permitting, drying your clothes on a line instead of with a dryer, or drying them partly in a dryer and then drying the rest of the way on a drying rack.

Obviously, turn out lights you don't need on. I've known people who go off the deep-end and turn off everything with power strips when they're not in use, but vampire drain at the end-user scale is so small it's almost not worth it.

So I have to design and build a responsive interface, code it together, hack together a Canvas interface to allow signing and send that data (along with the contract) back to our servers, allow reading and updating of ticket information, a photo interface for job documentation, etc. so I'm constantly jumping around between different hats."

I currently do dev-ops so I'm all over the place with tons of freedom and more of a broad directive as to what I should be working on than any specific management (my record is 3 months without a manager of any kind asking what I'm working on). So the idea of such a narrow role seemed claustrophobic at the time. Still does, actually. Pay was about $10k more than what I was making at the time, cost of living in that area ate up most of the difference immediately."
earthship,feizqdb,t3_eoac37,1579151862.0,"> why tires? 

Others have said tires keeps them out of a landfill. Otherwise, you need something that will be relatively stable for your berm. I also have a theory that they work well in the desert where the soil is highly permeable to rain, and the non-water-permeable tire tends to trap water and prevent the back of the earthen walls from getting wet in the desert environments. The general theory behind them is that it's using/recycling materials, versus a new material used for a similar purpose.

> what are the construction laws like? 

Depends where you live. I've floated the idea to an architect I know and we've immediately run into several issues for where we live in California. Keep in mind I haven't gone all in to the permitting stages yet; I'm probably two years out from that. But these were the issues my friend rattled off to me off the top of his head:

Water rights. California is super strict on water rights. It wouldn't be worth the hassle to try and permit storage here, and we're on a giant aquifer. So we wouldn't be catching and storing our rainwater like they do in AZ.

Emergency exits. We'd have to have an emergency exit in every sleeping room for fire codes. Putting a hole in the berm would defeat the purpose, so we're trying to find a way around this.

Tire walls. Not worth it and building codes very likely wouldn't allow it. Cobb walls and earthen floors are likely right out as well. California has lots of earthquakes. There's also the inconsistency of hand-mixed things making up large parts of building construction. We'll likely end up with poured concrete.

There were a couple other smaller issues, and some other things we'll be looking into. But I think at this point what we're going to do is effectively build what we'll try to get permitted as a semi-basement with an attached soil-floored greenhouse. I'm working on a floorplan testing  Jack and Jill bathrooms. Waterproof concrete for the foundation and back wall, SIPS for the roof. We can likely even get it built to code and insured."

lookatmydog,feid4hp,t3_ep3l4o,1579135713.0,"So, my girlfriend had a minipig (just, stay with me) who started having seizures. They eventually discovered that she had a genetic default called a liver shunt that was triggering the seizures. In the case of the pig, they got worse and worse to the point where the pig was having several seizures a day, which is the point at which the vet made the diagnosis. 

Unfortunately, for minipigs the success rate for the corrective surgery was something like 1 in 10, so she elected to have the pig put down a few days short of her 2nd birthday (the vet said a year tops trying to treat it based on how aggressive it was).

The better news is that dogs have the exact opposite, something like a 9 in 10 success rate (something to do with how the defect happens in them).

>Years ago we didn't have 15,000 DUI deaths per year like today until people stopped having personal responsibility and accountability for their own actions

What in the actual fuck are you talking about?

The reason why MADD exists is precisely *because* there were so many deaths related to DUIs, there was almost zero accountability for peoples actions, and driving drunk was considered common-place. The only difference was that the penalties weren't as severe for impaired driving.

What, do you think that like 5 years ago a bunch of people woke up one day and went ""well, I don't need to be accountable for my actions anymore"" and started driving drunk? Because if anything the numbers of DUI-related deaths has been slowly decreasing over time. MADD was created in the *1980s*, did people have accountability for their actions back then?

> Then MADD lobbied the states and fed to bankrupt someone for their first offense 

That sounds like MADD making people accountable for their actions to me. The penalties for DUI used to be a slap on the wrist. If getting hit with a DUI bankrupts you, then you probably shouldn't drive impaired (it should go without saying that if it doesn't bankrupt you, you shouldn't be driving impaired either).

> they are stealing the vehicles of citizens with seizure laws for driving on a suspended license 

Then don't drive with a suspended license? You did something bad enough to justify your license getting suspended, so the solution isn't for you to just keep breaking laws.

> you have to decide if you're going to break the driving code to get to work 

Bus, bike, walk, taxi, train, Uber, friends. Not as convenient, not as fast, but all completely legal. If you live super rural and none of the above apply, you can get a hardship for driving to and from work. No excuse."
