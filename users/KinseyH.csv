insaneparents,feit2gd,t1_feilyeg,1579146480.0,"Please heed this.

I'm a Christian-I think there's something after this life. But in this life  you don't have to be shackled to a parent who drags you down. It is not your responsibility to save or enable her. SHE owed YOU care and nurture and safety. She failed you. 

I'm the grandchild of a alcoholic. 

My mom made a stable, unconditionally loving home with no blueprint about how to do it - I'll always be in awe of that. But she's always lived with an existentialist guilt that the children of alcoholics seem to carry -  if only I'd been nicer to her, she wouldn't drink so much. If I didn't fight with my siblings so much, maybe she wouldn't drink. If I did X instead of Y maybe she wouldn't drink.

The drinking has nothing to do with you. You can't fix it. You can't make her get help - she has to want it.

You say your family is sick of it, so I hope you have family support. I hope your mom seeks help.

But you don't owe her anything. You don't have to cut her off, but you're not obligated to help her hurt herself

I'm so, so sorry your mom can't be the support you need."
