The hardest part is being confident and being able to do small talk, which for introverts (for example) is incredibly difficult, exhausting, and for some people, an absolute fucking nightmare. 

Bars are absolutely ideal for extroverts, it’s just the way it is. Alcohol helps, but you’ll need to make an effort. Most groups of people are going to be super suspect about some random guy who wants to hang with them, but if there’s a meetup specifically for this sort of thing, then you’ll have much more luck. Especially if you’re in their age group. Trying to do this in your 40s is tough mate."

newzealand,fc7b4xk,t3_eg28xt,1577502360.0,"Not a brand tip, but here’s a quality of life tip:

Look at non waterproof shoes or boots. 

When walking through a stream or river where the water is more than ankle deep, you’ll quickly realise that there is no such thing as a shoe or boot that won’t allow water in.

What happens is that the shoe/boot fills up with water, and the water won’t drain anywhere. It’ll be heavy and squelchy and uncomfortable, meaning every time you cross water more than ankle deep, you have to stop, take your pack off, remove and drain your shoe, put it back on. 

Every. Single. Time. 

Get shoes/boots that can drain the water out while wearing them.

If getting shoes instead of boots, wear gaiters to provide some protection against bushes/prickles etc. better than none at all. 

Also, before you go tramping, wear the shit out of those shoes. Wear them everyday to properly break them in and get used to them. Especially for boots that cover your ankles, they can rub at the bony protrusion of your ankle and cause absolute misery. There’s wearing them, and there’s wearing them while walking rough terrain for many hours while wearing a pack. Huge difference. 

Take ibuprofen tablets (nurofen etc) with you in case you get inflamed/rubbed foot joints. Was a lifesaver for me. Went from absolute agony on my ankle each and every step, with 9 hours to go, to taking ibuprofen and not feeling even the slightest twinge."
