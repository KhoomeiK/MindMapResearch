Were the Senate not filled with garbage excuses for human beings, the president would definitely be kicked out. I doubt this ends well for 45, regardless how the Senate votes.

Edit: To clarify, I believe it was a yes or no question; convict and remove, or not. But the yes or no answers aren't equally weighted. Yes means definitely remove this guy and make sure he can never run for office again. No contains people who don't want to convict but will do everything they can to make sure Trump loses the 2020 election, along with his most fervent supporters. That 51% yes carries a lot of weight. That's 51% of people who dislike him so much that they want him gone right now. That 51% will not be voting for him in November."

Horizon Zero Dawn is a much better example, because it was created by a Sony-owned company, and Sony is porting to PC. Sony owns the Bloodborne i.p. outright, and for whatever reason they've chosen not make it available on PC.

What neither of them had were tomatoes, which didn't exist in Europe at the time. And neither had much in the way of cheese. I imagine you'd be hard-pressed to find a modern pizza parlor owner make much fuss about whether or not a pizza should or should not include tomatoes or cheese.
