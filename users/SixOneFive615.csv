Additionally, you clearly just lost a highly skilled worker. I‚Äôm not saying he may not have needed to go eventually, but rather than ignoring his comments, you should have addressed them at that time. In a one on one, constructive (pun intended) manner, discuss your expectations and his role in the organization. If he can‚Äôt abide by that, see ya, but it sounds more like you wanted to make a point.

You don‚Äôt want your coworkers fearing you may fire them. You want them respecting you because you will hold them and others accountable when they don‚Äôt meet expectation."
