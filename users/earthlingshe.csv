blackladies,fec4egd,t1_febyj95,1578966489.0,"Honestly it didn't, not at all. You interpret things how you view the world. It was to point out that even married to a white guy and with the wealth that they both share (189 million dollar bet worth), she isn't protected. It was a ""obviously you know Serena but did you know she's also"" statement. An addition to her status, not a depreciation, but like I said, you interpret things how you view the world. Of course on Reddit, you have to be super detailed or condescendingly sarcastic to be heard. Black women, no matter who we are or who we're with will be unprotected. That was and still is the entire point. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. And mind you, the vast majority of people know her and don't know him by name due the industry he's in I suppose. Even people who use reddit frequently don't. So no, no correction needed. Black women need more help than worrying about if Serena's being devalued because not even with a family and status are we safe in the eyes of healthcare."
blackladies,febqkf4,t1_febq0m2,1578961619.0,"I believe it does matter though because it's incredibly messed up to see that black women are so unprotected no matter who we're with - black men, white men, asian men - or with who we are. Other races of women do not have that issue at all. That's why it's important. One would think the doctors seeing that she wasn't alone and that she was with her white husband, that they wouldn't treat her like scum. But no, they in fact did not care and still saw her as just another black woman not to take seriously. My point was, no matter who we are or who we're with, we aren't valuable to most of them."
blackladies,febp3t0,t1_febkol6,1578961203.0,"Well kudos to you, it's a shame that everyone can't focus on the actual issue. But you know, her being married matters very much.

I brought it up to show just how much wealth and status she actually has and still isn't safe from being black in America. They just think she dipped and married some random white boy who isn't making a name for himself. They both have status. Their combined net worth is 189 million dollars! Her reputation is greater than his. It's not sexist at all, but that's all anyone was able to focus on rather than the ACTUAL issue - black women not being taken seriously when it comes to our health (it really anything). Addressing her husband like I did isn't an issue unless you want it to be. Black women's health being ignored is the issue. Call it sexist, whatever, that's your opinion, but to downvote and hide factual information because you didn't like the wording is ridiculous."

Even Serena Williams, the wife of one Reddit's co-founders and executive chairmen, Alexis Ohania, almost died in childbirth due to this issue. Of course black women aren't the only victims, but we are disproportionately at a disadvantage. It needs to be talked about more and something has got to be done.

Edit: I know who Serena Williams is and many people already know who she is by her own amazing accomplishments. I pointed out Alexis simply because many people do not know that she is in fact married to a person responsible for the site we're all on right now. I pointed out her husband because even between both of their statuses, she was still affected by the r/morbidreality of how her race and sex is treated.

childfree,fe5qrjw,t3_enp79t,1578873164.0,"Feeling bad about to wanting hit the baby is so true. I watched my nephew for a weekend when he was 6 months old and it was absolute hell on earth. I had no idea how to take care of a baby, but I wanted to help my sister (she was at drill). My dad was there, but he didn't help at all (I later found out that he told my sister afterward that he didn't help because it would be good training for me when I become a mom. My sister told dad that I didn't want to be a mom). I remember the last night the most. My dad was gone at work, so it was just my little nephew and I. After I fed and bathed him, I was trying to put him to sleep, but he would not stop crying. I tried everything I could think of - singing, walking around, driving, binky, more milk and food, swaddling - nothing I did worked. I called my mom freaking out and she told me to just leave him alone and that he'll exhaust himself. He continued to cry for 30 minutes and it made me so incredibly anxious. I couldn't leave him like that anymore. I was lying with him and I wanted to hit him, and at that moment I started crying with him because gosh what a terrible, vile thought. I felt like a monster. I felt ashamed. He's just a baby and can't help it. I cuddled him some more while we cried and he eventually fell asleep on my chest. 0/10 would not do ever again in my life nor do I recommend. He's 5 now and super easy to babysit, but it's only because he can talk and is becoming more and more self-sufficient. I told my sister and she understood how hard it can be, but she said she misses when he was that small. I do not. She's a fantastic mother. I like my cat lol."

blackfishing,fdyyo5r,t1_fdyjtb0,1578784872.0,"I consider biracial and mixed people exactly that - biracial and mixed, not just black. I believe it's one thing to naturally tan, but to go far beyond your natural tanned skin is problematic either way.

Also, a lot of the time, you'll see mixed and biracial women playing as full black women, but not the other way around. Take [Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone ](https://www.madeinhollywood.tv/nina-simone-movie-director-cynthia-mort-defends-zoe-saldana-blackface-controversy/)for example. Zoe is obviously mixed with black and is a lighter complexion with more keen features. They had to paint her skin darker, put a wig on her, and give her a prosthetic nose in order for her to resemble Nina. My question is why? When there are a plethora of black American women who they could have picked who naturally resemble Nina. [Others](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-arie-why-zoe-saldana-872960) weren't happy about it either.

My bf is a quarter Japanese. The main indicating factors are his hair texture and slight epicanthic fold. But he's got blue eyes and his dad's nose, so you don't know he's a quarter until he tells you. Would it be fucked of him to wear brown contacts and pander to the Japanese community because he's got a quarter of Japanese ancestry? I think so, yes. There are other ways to respect and love yourself and other cultures/races/ethnicities without dressing up to look like them."
blackfishing,fdyij97,t3_end7hx,1578780107.0,"Black women's looks are becoming very popular right now... our complexion, features, bodies, hairstyles, and personal styles, especially the ""ghetto"" ones that we were ridiculed for for years and years; everyone wants the look and will do anything to obtain it. They'll even act like what they believe a black woman is and get praised for it. 

People love black features on non-black women and black women with non-black features. I know that sounds like a paradox, but hear me out. White and Asian girls with big butts, thick thighs, and full lips are now praised, when just a few years ago most of them were dying for a thigh gap and did anything to keep the weight off. I seriously thought I was fat in middle and high school school because of my curves. :( Black women are told that our butts are too big, that we're fat and ugly; we're told to watch out because ""white girls gettin thick"". [Ari Lennox](https://youtu.be/DzElLWQRczs) recently responded to people calling her nose and other black features ugly and dog-like while on a black man those are seen as sexy. Black women basically have to look like non-black women features wise, (especially with a small nose and light eyes, but keep the lips, ass, tits, and thighs) but several shades darker. That's why mixed and biracial women are praised in the black community. 

I'll stop here because I could really go on and on about this... It's fucked up and truly a terrible thing going on."
