It is a slightly different beast. You can cheaply access it in large amounts and like weed, “it’s just a plant.” People who aren’t opiate addicts don’t go into it knowing just how addictive it is. The only people I ever see cautioning others about kratom are those who have been addicted to it. I’ve been there, so I’m gonna caution others!"

Nah it’s not a case of “all drugs can be” whatever, kratom is full on opioid addictive. It can give you physical withdrawals and makes you feel sick as hell when you’re not on it. Your aunt is addicted to an opioid. I’ve been there, and it’s really hard to quit. If she ever wants to try, suggest a very gradual taper, and she gotta stick to it.
