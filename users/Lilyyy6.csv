Tourettes,fel93mz,t3_epr6bc,1579216741.0,Only 10% of tourettes sufferers get coprolalia which is the condition with swear tics. The condition is having tics that are socially unacceptable. If someone with coprolalia didn't know swear words their tics would be other inappropriate things or what they believe is inappropriate.

CPTSD,fe8zacp,t1_fe8kq13,1578932500.0,"It's basically socially required, especially back when your parents probabaly had you. Some people even think that not wanting children (especially as a women) is selfish and will harass childfree people about how they are such monsters. Having children should not be the default because not everyone is good at raising kids."

ADHD,fdel5jg,t3_ekv1t7,1578341349.0,"There is this app I've been using to help me build habits and keep track of my behaviors. The app is called Habit. You add habits or behaviors and check them off each day if you did it. It gives you statistics on the habit like a calender marking what days you did the habit, a graph of habit strength (streaks), and how often the habit is done statistically each day of the week. You can even set reminders through the app to notify your phone at cirtain times and make it so you can't swipe away the notification. 

I think this app can help with not only building good habits but keeping track how often things happen or how things affect you. I use it to track my depression and tourettes  and how other things affect it like cold weather, lots of homework, staying up late etc."
