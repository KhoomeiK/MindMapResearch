buildmeapc,ff9tg6p,t1_ff9qgyp,1579720890.0,"True! If I bought the 2060s and it didn’t make much difference, the worst case is I pick up a ryzen 5 3600x and a nice new AM4 MoBo to seriously get the best I can out of it. I could most likely recycle all my parts too from the case to GPU to Power supply, so it wouldn’t be a brand new system as much as a renovation, I assume?"

buildmeapc,ff9f1ye,t1_ff9em1q,1579711628.0,"Cool! A few follow up questions:
- what is the main difference between Ryzen and Intel CPUs?
- would I need a new power supply if my current one is like 650V and PCPartpicker claims my setup is roughly 350 right now?"

boneworks,fe8ye0g,t3_emzls8,1578932343.0,"I’m guessing CPU issues, my 1060 6gb never has issues with more graphically intense VR games, but once CPU is important my desktop greatly underperforms. Blade and Sorcery looks fantastic until 5 people appear in the environment. Granted I don’t know much about computers so take this with a grain of salt"
