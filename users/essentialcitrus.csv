confessions,fdmce77,t3_em3bqm,1578545458.0,"I hope something fucking bad happens to you. As someone who spent three years in an abusive relationship that was ‚Äúonly sometimes‚Äù physically abusive, it‚Äôs fucking terrible. And that‚Äôs in a RELATIONSHIP. One that I was ABLE TO LEAVE. Because I‚Äôm a fucking adult. 

But the time I spent in it, was filled with fear. Fear of the next time I‚Äôd be hit. The next time I‚Äôd be told how worthless or disgusting I was. The next time I‚Äôd feel pain whether it be physical or emotional. Because BOTH are damaging. To a full grown adult. LASTING DAMAGE. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúfree‚Äù for almost a year now and it‚Äôs still not real freedom. Memories are still there and they still fuck with my head and I don‚Äôt know when or if they will stop. 

Now imagine what you are CHOOSING to do to a CHILD. A child who is incapable of escaping her torment. Whose mind is still developing. Her mind is going to PERMANENTLY be wired wrong because of what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre going to seriously mess up all of her future relationships. She should be able to trust her family. And you‚Äôre treating her like this, hurting her on purpose. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about the physical aspect: you don‚Äôt do it very often, right? Guess what. Neither does any abuser right at first. Before you know it, hurting her will get easier and definitely happen more often. With more painful results for her. Now it‚Äôs just squeezing. In a few months it‚Äôll be a broken something. Children have smaller bones than us. Smaller bodies in general and we should be PROTECTING them not endangering them. 

I had so much goddamn rage reading this and I‚Äôm not joking when I said I hope something bad happens to you. You are scum, and you need a real fucking wake up call. Grow the fuck up and be a decent human being."
