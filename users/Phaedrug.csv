The kids who are kill their classmates are isolated and alone and they don‚Äôt see a future for themselves. In response to this they become more angry, anger leads to hate, etc. 

The kids who are wholesome like these kids, and many more like them are simply responding in the opposite way. They see inaction over climate change and adults being terrible to each other and decide that they can do better, that life doesn‚Äôt have to be like that.
