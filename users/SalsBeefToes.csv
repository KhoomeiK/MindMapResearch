depression,fd2reat,t3_ejvcf6,1578150879.0,"Just turned 16 and to be honest, it's been rough. Depression is one tough son of a bitch to live with. 
I want to see my friends and go crazy and stupid like kids are meant to, but I just never have the energy. I did once a long time ago, but around my 4th grade year things started to go downhill.
I understand man, life hasnt been easy for us."

Its okay to be at different spots, you're doing everything you can. Life is stressful. No amount of preparation can truly prepare you for what it's like. Theres no shame in 'pathetic jobs'. A jobs a job man, they're gonna suck ass but its gonna get so much better later on. 
I'm really young, freshly 16, so I'm not too smart on finances and all that but- maybe try to save off to the side? I get what it's like to live with family that you cant get along with or bring you down, and it's really hard. Look for small places off to the side. My mom took buses from New York to Ohio just to escape her life. Sometimes, you just need to get away from it. Start a new in a town, state, somewhere with a job and just book it. 
I dont have the best advice, but I do get the feeling of loneliness and worthlessness at your young age. You feel like you cant amount to what you've been told should be the base line- but we can. Sometimes it might just take a little while, but you're not alone. Theres people in this boat with you, you can do it man. Keep going."
