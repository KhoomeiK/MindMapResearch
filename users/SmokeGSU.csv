news,ffewuje,t1_ffdylwg,1579868778.0,"Well I take it back. After reading, it seems that there is no law that says a private business has to accept cash for payment. This does seem like it would be more harmful to their bottom line, though - having to pay cc fees if only accepting cards payments. It does seem odd though that no laws exist for this. I guess it goes back to the days of using livestock and other goods to pay debts?"

tifu,ffdpg0x,t1_ffb2lwu,1579825841.0,So.... you down voted my opinion on marriage because you don't agree with it? And called me an asshole for having an opinion that is shared by millions of people? That's mature.
tifu,ffavckk,t1_ff9dlrh,1579745351.0,"I'm in the camp that people should marry with the intention that it's for life. It shouldn't be treated as just something that's going to get you through the next 5 years because of convenience or whatever. I think there are too many unhappy people trying to satisfy their unhappiness with people to marry not because they're hoping for a lifelong commitment, but to satisfy a desire to not be single. Or people have kids together, decide ""yeah let's get married"" only for the sake of the kids, then ends up getting divorced later on and the kids end up with the opinion that there's nothing lasting or sacred about marriage. 

That's just my opinion though. At the end of the day, people are gonna whatever they want to do."
tifu,ff9511i,t1_ff7tbca,1579705000.0,"I'm in the camp of ""there has to be pretty severe circumstances for me to advocate that someone gets a divorce"". This is absolutely one of those cases for me personally. People can change during a marriage, sure, but this is not a change - it's a complete conversion, and this is not what OP ""agreed"" to with marriage.

OP, get out now while you're still young enough to live the happy life that you want to. You only get one shot at life, no reason to spend it in misery when you're willing to adapt but your spouse is not.

Also, did she turn to pentecostal? In my limited life experiences, the people I personally know who used to live kind of wild and then decide to ""find Jesus"" somehow always ends up becoming involved with pentecostal churches. It's like they literally go from one extreme to the complete opposite extreme (barking and convulsing during ""church service"")."

The manager quit one day abruptly and I was asked to take over as the store manager. First day, the same day that the prior manager didn't show up and we were sorting out what was fount on, my first hour as the new SM I have to take a phone call from an irrate customer who was refused a warranty return on a Nintendo DS... That the customer had backed their vehicle over and completely destroyed.

There also the time that the prior store manager, in only a couple of weeks before quitting, accepted a roach-infested Xbox 360 system and didn't tell anyone. The next morning, I opened the store, had my breakfast at the counter before opening as usual. Took a swig of my energy drink, sat the drink down, turned away for no more than 8 seconds, turned back to my drink, took another swig, and immediately realized that a roach was squirming around in my mouth because its super speed had somehow allowed it to scale my drink can and drop inside in mere seconds. That was when I found out about the buggy system.

I have other horror stories from that place. Fuck Gamestop and its corporate culture."

But the rational and logical side of my brain would always tell me ""no, there's a logical explanation for it."" The couple of years after that I did some Googling here and there about it, but it wasn't until I was going back to college and had to take a public speaking class that I really dug into it. We got to pick some of our topics and I decided to do a ten minute speech on sleep paralysis. 

The more I researched the more fascinating it all became. It's a literal mind-trick that's been plaguing people with some reports as far back as ancient times. There's even belief now that one of the conspirators in the Salem Witch Trials was likely experiencing it when he said that one of the girls visited him at night, sat on his chest, and choked him so he couldn't breathe - sound familiar?

Since getting a sleep study done and getting on a bi-pap machine I don't really have episodes anymore, but they would become so frequent and common that if wake up, see a dark spirit standing beside my bed, realize ""oh, it must be Tuesday"" and after coming out of it I'd just roll back over and go to sleep."

gaming,fekdoqj,t3_epj5ui,1579197877.0,"When I was in middle school, during break we used to play what I always assumed was a house-rules version of Uno called ""Train"". It was always 7 or 8 of us playing with about 5 or 6 decks of cards. The way it worked is that as long as you had cards in your hand that were numerically in order, say that the discard card was a red 2 and you had a green 3, yellow 4, two blue 5s, and a green 6, you could lay all of those cards down at the same time and multiples of the same numbered card as long as it was in order. You could also ""pass"" draw twos or fours onto the next person in line so that if the prior person put down three Draw 2 cards (6 total draw cards), as long as you had at least one Draw 2 card OR a Draw 4, you could place it down, and then the next person would have to draw the total amount of Draws that were placed down. But, once a person put a Draw 4 card down, the next people couldn't go back to putting down a Draw 2; they could only put down a Draw 4 if they had one. If they didn't have one, then they'd have to draw all of those cards, so if the number of Draw Twos/Fours added up together came up to 10, the person would have to draw ten cards from the deck to add to their hand. Skips and reverses would work similarly by placing multiple down at the same time. 

It would get crazy as kids are throwing down Draw cards to pass it along to keep from having to draw cards themselves. You'd sometimes have a person drawing ten or twenty cards because they'd get stuck not having any Draw 2/4 cards in their hand. We had so much fun playing that."

The party system is the problem, not people's opinions on issues. Politicians pick the side they think will guarantee their success the most. Sure, they may agree with some of the issues, but I seriously doubt most Democrat congressmen care about illegal immigrants and their rights, but by God they'll defend them to the grave if it gets them some votes! Same with Republicans and Bible thumpers. It's all about who's going to give you the most votes, and congress sorting those voters into two groups politically.
