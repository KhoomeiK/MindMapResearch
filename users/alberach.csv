One of the biggest draws of Classic WoW was the elimination of LFG queue, in part because just getting teleported to the instance made it feel like you weren't traveling on an adventure, you were just being ushered into a fake zone to complete a pre-designed challenge.

In Oblivion, you could originally travel to any major city right off the bat, but many players, myself included, downloaded a mod that made that possible only after you had actually reached that city on foot.

The best fast travel system I've ever seen was in Morrowind, where you didn't just click somewhere on the map and appear there. If you wanted to get across the map, you often had to take a strider from one town, go through a mage's portal to another town, run to the harbor and grab a boat to your destination. It didn't break the continuity of the world, but actually enhanced it by making you learn the most efficient routes, while still letting you cut some travel time."

It was aided and abetted by the leftist stranglehold on the legal system and legislatures that went soft on crime in the belief that addressing ""root causes"" rather than enforcing the law would end crime. There are cases of people literally being convicted of murdering a police officer with damning evidence, and then being out of prison within a year and attending law school. It was Alice in fucking Wonderland. I wish I could find you the write up that I learned all this from.

The trend was slightly reversed as the crime wave started to reach epidemic proportions. You were more likely to be murdered than killed in a car accident, etc. So people decided to give tougher legislation and punishments a try, and the trend did indeed reverse and now crime is historically low (and all top 10 cities for crime are run by democrats, which we're supposed to believe is somehow a coincidence).

The further back you go the more wordy they are. As time went on marketers favored more pictures and less words. Likewise with corporate logos. You can see a trend with them shedding fine details in favor of simplicity for a more ""crisp"" appearance.

I don't know that the previous examples are a result of the same trend as the decline in animation. This may be due to the fact that watching an animated show is a passive activity and one that lacks a high degree of intentionality, meaning the consumer is likely to exhibit a lack of discernment (such as a desire for better animation) and a short attention span (it is for children, after all).

To describe what I mean by ""intentionality"" consider the dichotomy between this and for example modern CGI films, which have been becoming increasingly sophisticated. Going to the movies or renting a movie are intentional acts, not to mention that they have a definite cost, and the consumer will likely exhibit more discretion in choosing a higher quality product.

-Women and men have different proportions. This means you have to change how the bones are rigged up in the female models (bones attach to groups of polygons and determine how they move together). If you don't rerig the models you'll get really weird stuff happening.
-You can't maintain the same proportions because it'll look super ugly and unprofessional. Women aren't just men with tits, they have different bodies.
-You have to have new textures. Facial texture is like 90% of what makes a face look unique. I don't know how much you would have to change the body textures but you'd have to change at least a bit.
-Rerigging bones means you probably have to redo animations or they won't line up correctly.
-How far do you want to go with having female models? How distinct do you want them to be? Because if you can see the characters' hair, you probably want different hairstyles for women. Hair has to also be rigged so that it moves properly, with long hair being especially troublesome because of how frequently it clips with body, clothes and equipment. There are whole physics engines designed around getting long hair to function even slightly realistically.

Now any competent design team is more than capable of doing these things. And I should be clear that I like having both males and females in games, all things being equal. I consider it a value add.

TumblrInAction,fcjolo1,t1_fch3155,1577696809.0,"Just wanted to step in to say you should have a read about the function of prices in conveying information. This is probably the single greatest reason communism is unworkable. Even the argument that communism ignores human nature falls short of disproving it as thoroughly as the understanding of prices.

What is profit? Quite simply, profit is what is left over. Once you've bought all the materials, paid the employees, paid the rent and utilities, and sold your product, profit is what is left over.

But what does profit mean?
Profit means that a particular type of economic activity, and the method in which it was done, produced a net increase in value. A loss means resources were wasted. Profits, losses, and prices direct the flow of resources to where they are most needed in a way that is nearly effortless, and most certainly more quickly and efficiently than having a government bureau constantly poring over volumes of information to decide what should be produced.

Consider: an earthquake knocks out some oil drilling platforms, limiting the supply of oil. The shortage provokes an increase in prices. As it becomes more expensive to drive, some percentage of people opt to walk more or use public transport, reducing the consumption of fuel. At the same time, as prices rise, it becomes economical for oil companies to begin exploiting oil sands, whereas the process of refining oil from oil sands is normally too expensive to be profitable. The combination of voluntary rationing to avoid the higher prices, as well as new supply from the now-profitable exploitation of additional deposits, works to stabilize oil prices. The price will likely remain higher for a while until the damaged infrastructure is repaired.

Now let's look at the same event without prices, or with artificial prices. After the disaster, oil companies start raising prices to make more optimal use of a now more limited resource. Congress accuses them of greed and passes a law resetting oil prices back to their previous level. People do not change their consumption habits because they do not pay any additional cost, despite the resource becoming increasingly scarce as supply cannot at present keep up with demand. With the price being artificially suppressed, it remains unprofitable to exploit oil sands, so supply does not increase. The situation eventually reaches its conclusion: gas stations simply cannot keep supplied. Common plastic-based products either jump hugely in price or are taken off shelves altogether. The complete inability to drive one's vehicle finally obliges people to opt for alternatives. With any luck, the artificial price ceiling is revoked, allowing supply to stabilize.

Entry-level conservative thought says that communism fails because it fails to consider human self interest. But learn a bit more and you realize that, ironically, self-interest was the only thing keeping most communist countries afloat for as long as they lasted (well, after a fashion. People still starved. Like, a lot)."

kotakuinaction2,fcibnyr,t3_eh42u9,1577660191.0,"With regards to questions 2, 3 and 4, because leftism seeks to subvert and destroy western civilization. They even chant ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Civ has got to go!""

But why, given the comparative affluence and safety of Western countries? Well, first of all, basically all leftists are unworldly ingrates. They have no concept of how hard life can be outside their own societies and how hard it was in the past, and how western culture and social organization are the main ingredients that allowed the West to surpass the vast majority of the world.

Western civilization developed by establishing ""best practices"" based on centuries of experience and experimentation. But these ""best practices"" (such as sexual responsibility, obligation to work, respect for parents and elders, etc.) constrain behavior that a lot of people want to do (fuck around, be lazy, and rebel against one's parents, etc.). Thomas Sowell explains how this gives rise to Leftism:

&#x200B;

>If the truth is boring, civilization is irksome. The constraints inherent to civilized living are frustrating in innumerable ways. Throughout history those with the vision of the anointed have regarded these constraints as arbitrary impositions from which they--and we all--can be liberated. The calamity that has typically followed in the wake of such 'liberation' has seldom provoked any reconsideration of the set of assumptions--the 'vision'--which led to it in the first place. That vision is too well insulated from feedback.

&#x200B;

In the absence of a direct, material reason to adopt a more accurate worldview, people will tend to espouse whatever worldview is most psychologically appealing and/or personally flattering to them. This is the basis of the saying ""A conservative is a liberal who was mugged."""

Black students also have vastly higher rates of unexcused absence, which of course is a personal choice, not a result of school policy. Given how that shows that black students in general value their education less and misbehave more without any influence from the school, a reasonable person would expect to see the same behavior within school. But Leftists do not like reason and believe as an axiom of faith that all misbehavior among minorities is a product of bigotry (misbehavior among whites, meanwhile, is just due to them being evil)."

Unfortunately, there's a lot of inconsistency in how these situations are dealt with. In another jurisdiction he very well could have been convicted of manslaughter or second degree murder.

The applicable concept is called provocation. An individual claiming provocation is arguing to the court that in the extreme circumstances in which the crime occurred (such as his child being sexually assaulted) he could not be expected to act rationally and thus his moral culpability was limited. If the court agrees, this can reduce a charge of, for example, second degree murder to manslaughter. The Texas case was somewhat unusual for fully exonerating the father, which doesn't typically happen."

kotakuinaction2,fc632os,t3_eg9hvh,1577471160.0,"I think there are blacks that originate from a place called Zerrikania. But neither the books nor the games ever made any suggestion that the populations of Zerrikania and the northern kingdoms mixed very much at all.

In the meantime I'd like to address a common rebuttal to the ""unrealistic"" argument. Often when we point out things like how there wouldn't be blacks just randomly appearing in the population or that women wouldn't likely be suiting up in armor and riding into battle, the response from the defender of forced diversity is ""There are sorcerers throwing fireballs around and you're saying women fighting in battles is unrealistic?""

First of all, part of immersion is maintaining as much realism as can be maintained. One of the reasons the Witcher universe appeals to me is that it's a world where Grimm Brothers style fairytales of girls locked in towers and knights afflicted with a curse that can only be lifted by the kiss of their beloved exist alongside gritty, very human conflicts of war and politics. The realness of the world highlights the strangeness of the supernatural.

And second, things like magic don't ""replace"" reality, they add to it. A sorceress can certainly contend with a grown male, owning to possessing magic (and Yennefer actually beats Geralt in combat in The Last Wish). But without magic a sorceress is as weak as a normal woman and would be very out of place in a conventional battle. Triss didn't fight at Sodden because she could contend physically with men. She fought at Sodden because she can call down fireballs from the sky."
