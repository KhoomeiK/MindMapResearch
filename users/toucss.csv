starbucks,feewwse,t1_feer564,1579042985.0,I've always wondered how the shots dying arguement goes up against the people who actually just buy espresso shots. Are we supposed to tell them their coffee is likely already dead by the time they get to drink it?

YouShouldKnow,fdqq5mq,t1_fdqn40o,1578672490.0,"Not exactly how you want to be treated after that, I know. 
But at least I'm in the UK and it was via NHS so I didn't have a huge bill to pay.
That was almost a year ago now and I am in a better place.


So if anyone's reading this with the intention of suicide.
I can't promise it gets better, but it *does* get easier.
If you think an attempt on your life, as a cry for help will get you the help you need, remember, it doesn't always get you the help you need and you could end up in a worse place than you were, physically, mentally and emotionally.

YouShouldKnow,fdqiqhh,t3_emqvvk,1578667665.0,"My experience was very different. The first time I just slept and woke up in a trance like state. Which lasted for a good 12 hours. 
The second time I took more, I ended up puking my guts up. I ended up shitting so much that by the end if it I was shitting out black liquid (possibly blood at this point) my heart rapid. My breathing was jagged. And for about 5 days after that I was in that trance like state again, but with the added bonus of the shakes. 
I couldn't stand up straight, I couldn't lift knives or forks to my mouth to try and eat because I was shaking all over the place. 
(To clarify, I went to the hospital the first time but my bloods came back fine, I was in no danger, but was left in the a+e dept for the longest time and my hospital admitted to me they lost my paperwork and forgot I was waiting to be seen. The second time I was determined to die, but I also didn't want to have to sit in a waiting room shitting and puking. So I stayed at home.)"

These are all available on UK Netflix. There are probably relationship woes in some of them given the setting. But as far as I ran remember it's not solely based around relationships."

CasualConversation,fdd7kz7,t1_fdcs47y,1578298370.0,It is a cropped puffer jacket! It's got a velvety feel to it. It feels so nice on and I assume it looks just as nice on me as it does the model!

starbucks,fcx5it3,t3_ej7bk1,1578052103.0,"Also been with Starbucks about a month. My mistakes include. 
Making a frappe without ice. Wasn't until the blender made a different noise, I realised my mistake. 
Pike place coffee all over the place! I forgot to turn the tap off after I drained it and changed the filter. 
A number of people have been given syrup based coffees, without said syrup. 
Made entire drinks before I realised I hadn't actually put the coffee shots in. 
I'm sure there are more."
loneliness,fcwyz5z,t1_fcu2hy3,1578043718.0,"For one. I had just been out that day and came home upset and crying, alone. 
For two. I have plenty of human interactions. I have a full time job, I live with my family. I have a few friends I can contact when I'm feeling sad or low. 
But that doesn't help the feeling of loneliness. 
Lonliness isn't always *being* alone. It's feeling alone. I could be in a room of 20 people who love me and I love back and I can still feel incredibly lonely."

loneliness,fbyownd,t3_ef70c0,1577222476.0,"I don't have much social media. But I currently use Snapchat. But Instagram has a stories feature which is just like snapchat. 
Maybe ask this girl if she has Instagram too? It's likely she does. 
That way you still have the appeal of Snapchat. But once you start to get more comfortable you can share things that you want people to see for longer than a day."
