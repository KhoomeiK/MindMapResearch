AmItheAsshole,fcwcgdy,t1_fcvyxv8,1578022194.0,Thanks! It is a nice thing to share with them as we do like them. These people...I truly believe what comes around goes around.
AmItheAsshole,fcvygoi,t3_ej5jdk,1578012972.0,"NTA at all. Little story for you: my husband’s family friend, a girl he’s known all his life, REALLY wanted him to officiate. The problem? It was on our anniversary. They said they totally understood if we couldn’t and didn’t want to “steal our day.” My husband wanted to do it and I was fine with it so we did! They had a special toast and song for us and thanked us many times very graciously. And now every year we all four wish each other happy anniversary. Ha! The difference is they asked way ahead of time and were okay with hearing no. Your people didn’t ask and would NOT hear no. 

Happy stupid Monday wedding losers! No ones gonna go!"

AmItheAsshole,fcs9shs,t3_eike5x,1577913488.0,"His correct answer should have been: “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry your mom put pressure on you to have unnecessary and painful surgeries, when you were just a child, repeatedly. It’s abusive and sick. I love how you look in these old pictures and I love how you look now, because I love who you are as a person.”

Throw the whole fake ass boyfriend OUT.

Edit: a word"
Makeup,fcs8nax,t3_eimxzk,1577912998.0,"I’d recommend Benetint by Benefit, it’s a liquid and it looks super natural, no powdery look to deal with. Just gives you a nice flush. Takes a few tries to get used to it, I like to do two or three swipes on each side and rub in quickly. Good luck!"
happy,fcny3ee,t3_ei6k82,1577820685.0,It looks bad ass!!
cats,fcbccib,t1_fcaxnrp,1577585134.0,"Cats are the best. I’ve just had surgery and Pickles, my 13 year old girl, won’t leave my side. They know. I wish you guys years of happiness and playtimes!"
cats,fcaxi8m,t3_egwzvs,1577578567.0,You. Look. SO. HAPPY!!! Happy gotcha days little dudes!
wallstreetbets,fc30dca,t1_fc2lmuf,1577378579.0,I legitimately loled.
Eyebleach,fbhl5qj,t1_fbh2830,1576876277.0,It’s like a holiday commercial for luxury goods that just happens to have cats in it.
