sure, but ask yourself how assuming the worst about other people helps.

>I think there are things in any RPG that are wrong. One is to tell player what kind of characters they need to play or how they have to build their characters.

and i've been trying to tell you that i don't think that's what was happening. it's just how you perceived what the OP said. i interpreted it differently because i don't assume laziness or malice.

>(Others include DM vs players, being creepy/insensitive/offensive, and unwanted PvP.) But in this case it's a DM thing and the easiest thing to avoid the whole ""I strongly suggested a one level dip into class X"" thing is to ask yourself if you yourself would like to be on the receiving end of this. (Call me judgemental, but I don't think OP did at any time.) How would you feel if the DM contacted you to tell you how to run your character? I would hate it. And I said that I would (iirc). 

actually, it seems the easiest way to avoid hard feelings is to never assume someone is trying to be a dick.

>This has nothing to do with knowledge, ignorance or malice, this is about empathy and a general willingness to think about it. (Is this judgemental again?) Might be experience, I cannot tell.

the suggestion doesn't seem negative to me. if the DM suggested a rogue dip, i might ask why. when they said to deal with magical traps, i would then understand that their concern is for our ability to deal with magical traps and not how i build my character. it's almost always better to ask someone for more information than to assume the worst interpretation of their actions or utterances."
Pathfinder_RPG,fcrzjv5,t1_fcrwder,1577908981.0,"i'm only pointing out that you mischaracterized the argument (though it doesn't seem that was intentional). whether or not you find that argument convincing isn't my concern.

edit: though in both the scenarios you presented, i wouldn't call either action ""good."" the enemy ship is attacking you, so fighting back is reasonable (but still not ""good"" to my reckoning). i imagine you'd be hardpressed to find someone to fault self-defense. however, was sinking the enemy ship necessary? they could have had innocent prisoners on board and, even if they didn't, ending their lives also ends the possibility of their redemption. same goes for the wizard and his fireball. neither action seems ""evil"" but nor do they seem particularly ""good."""
Pathfinder_RPG,fcruxe5,t1_fcr9czp,1577906950.0,"actually, the argument revolves around the indiscriminate killing of everything in the maze without knowing there weren't any innocents. it's the same reason it's illegal to booby trap your house."
Pathfinder_RPG,fcro400,t1_fcrlczj,1577904356.0,">So any DM still going for unavoidable traps that need a certain class feature (like trapfinding, spell books, familiar, animal companions, religion requirements) is doing this either because of laziness or malice.

or ignorance or inexperience. you're still being a judgemental dick towards a person who was asking for help. i hope you're not like this in person."
Pathfinder_RPG,fcr55lo,t1_fcpccz7,1577896921.0,looks like the problem is that you are assuming anyone else is harassing their players with things for which they are unprepared and attributing malicious intent to others. all anyone said is that not being prepared for things one encounters adventuring will bite you in the ass eventually. you took that as a threat rather than a warning simply because a GM (who is asking for advice because they know they're not an encyclopedia on the game) suggested rogue levels for trapfinding because it was the only way they could think of to deal with magical traps.
Pathfinder_RPG,fcoyj73,t1_fcof9v1,1577845131.0,">While I think every encounter need not be a struggle, I agree that as a whole every scenario/dungeon/campaign chapter should include many instances of taxing the PCs to their limits for the game to feel intense and the choices significant. 

but if every challenge is ultimately one you can and are intended to overcome albeit with varying degrees of difficulty, it can feel scripted rather than intense. the occasional challenge you're not meant to overcome can be refreshing."
Pathfinder_RPG,fcowqby,t1_fcdzgsc,1577843671.0,">By the nature of HP still protecting from from otherwise undodgable or unmitigated dage sources (""swimming"" in lava as a popular example, falling 200+feet, etc.) It is meat points.

not necessarily. falling 200 feet and not dying is probably possible. it's highly unlikely but seems possible given the right circumstances. swimming in lava, though, not so much. however, that still doesn't mean they *must* be meat points in all circumstances. also, given that in optional systems like wounds and vigor hit points are described as an abstraction, i'd say they're not always intended to be literal meat points."
Pathfinder_RPG,fcoustw,t1_fckoj2l,1577842147.0,">""You don't have to invest into trapfinding, but it'll bite you in the arse if you don't."" 

yes, that is how the game works. you don't have to invest in ways to see invisible creatures, but it will bite you in the ass if you don't.  you don't have to invest in CON, but it will bite you in the ass if you don't. ""but the GM doesn't have to include traps!"" he doesn't have to include damage either. at some point you're just asking to be coddled."

edit: also, what i was getting at was that we don't all pay the same in taxes so you can't look at per capita spending as a direct translation of what an individual pays into the system."

i thought it was pretty obvious i was saying i didn't care about the specific things i quoted you talking about above that statement. but since it's pretty clear you're more interested in trying to look like the clever one in this conversation than trying to understand what i'm saying, i guess we're done here."
