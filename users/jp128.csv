solotravel,fcyfr8u,t1_fcwehpq,1578079469.0,"That is how I look at it as well. We're pretty similar actually: I am days away from being 29, software engineer, nature/hiking/photography. I am not a big fan of history though -- more on the robotics and electronics side for interests, and from the midwest.

Anyway, I have similar anxieties. They aren't crippling but they aren't minuscule. For me, traveling has done a lot. I have solo traveled to Germany (Hamburg and Berlin) and Russia (Moscow, St. Petersburg) and I have had amazing times and not so amazing (not bad, just ""eh""). Traveling helps me get out of whatever ""shell"" I feel like I am in. I don't think I'd call it depression, but maybe its in the same vein. 

I just sometimes need to get out and go somewhere. When I go solo, it seems easier because everyone is unknown and I don't have to take into consideration what friends or family would think or want to do."
