I wasn't attacking you tho :) I just noticed these 2 ""studies"" being cited a lot on the dating subs, and it kind of dawned on me that's all that's ever cited. Like, shouldn't there be more sources to back this up? One of them is a [medium.com](https://medium.com) post, the other is a blog from a private company. Neither of those give me a high level of trust.

Also classifying someone as less attractive does not necessarily mean they wouldn't still go out on a date with them. Perhaps half of the girls I dated fell on the ""not my type / not quite what I want"" side of things but I still gave them a chance and didn't regret it."

""I just bike an hour long by the shore for the first time, it was super nice. Where do you usually go biking / are you more of an urban or nature biker?""

Only after establishing a clean banter do I follow with a dick pic. You never send a dic pic straight up, it's a rookie mistake. Dick pics are like a stew, you need to let it brew, toss in the right ingredients, let it simmer for a while. You need to set the stage right, it's a performance where you get one shot and one shot only. It also helps to have proper photo, with good lighting and composition. We often get trapped in our head, so it's good to ask a friend to help and out snap a few photos of your dick. Try different angles and lamps, just have fun with it! It's not unreasonable to send it to professional photo editors for some light touch-ups as well - perhaps ease out some of the flab, erase a few uncharacteristic moles. Treat your dick pic like a fine instagram influencer."

My point is: you state that selling your body makes you a ""whore"" but virtually any physically-intensive job involves selling your body to varying degrees. If anything, sex is less destructive and damaging to your body than carrying slabs of concrete or running around a field and tackling people.

I just don't think selling sex for money is any less dignified than the other types of manual labor jobs.

Personally, I never paid a prostitute and wouldn't prostitute myself, but I feel it has more to do with social stigma than any sort of innate discomfort."

It's one of those complex philosophical problems, tho. People CHOOSE to consume their media, so should we try to limit that? Should we let people ""hurt"" themselves if they want to, because freedom, or regulate it, because of greater social costs (like cigarettes or booze)? What about the creator's right to free speech and equal opportunity? If someone wants to consume their content, can we really tell them they're not allowed to make it? They're not hurting anyone \_in the process\_ of creating it (like the actual clickbait videos of licking ice cream or animal abuse).
