People can vote, but the media that informs the elections is uniquely concentrated and bound to 1 political vision, the money that motivates politics comes through uniquely lax and opaque framework. Australia is highly dependent and tied to and influenced by China. There is a lot that stands between australian ""demos"" and the ""cratos"" of the nation. I appologize for the fuckton of links, but to me they paint a picture of a strangled democracy, like Turkey or Russia, the nation is made to resemple democracy, but the inner functions of it undermines the freedom and division of power. 
It looks like separation of power is still functioning in Australia, which is a strong ""This is democracy""-argument, but just yesterday there was an article about chinese companies being granted waterrights and depleting water supplies during draught and the general inability of australian government to act on the multitude of warnings about fire hazard and the relationship between coal and global warning seems to suggest a government that isn't tied to the welfare of the nation or the people, but money and oligarchal / plutonic interests."
