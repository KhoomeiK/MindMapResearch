My boyfriend and I are living in the same house with his grandfather (two apartments). When we moved here, we had to lift the dryer in the first floor and it went pretty well. His grandfather saw it through the window and started calling our male neighbours because ""women arent made for lifting weights"" and literally tried to force me cleaning the house. Like wtf, i made a really good job. I didnt stop. Since then he does not even talk to me..."
