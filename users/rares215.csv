No lol, I'm 100% zoomer; I'm just sort of ignorant on the subject since I was raised in a more lenient environment and assumed that's what it was like for everyone.

Oh, that wasn't the message I was trying to convey haha. I guess I miscommunicated there; what I meant to say what that some people use religion as a means to justify being hateful as opposed to religion being the cause of that hatred.  
Clearly I forgot how much of a cultural thing religion is and how many branches Christianity has. I wasn't raised to suppress my sexual urges or be hateful, so I assumed that was the default for everyone. I guess I must've gotten lucky to have a relatively sheltered childhood where my understanding of religion boiled down to it being a basic karmic causal chain: do good, God rewards and protects you; do bad, get bad in return.

In the end, I get what you mean now. Christianity as a whole seems to be in dire need of a modernization if it wants to stop traumatizing children into converting away."
AskReddit,ff5y41j,t1_ff5xdo1,1579614021.0,"I feel like that's more of a social thing than a religious thing. As an ex-Christian in a predominantly Orthodox country, I think religion is just a crutch for bad people to justify continuing to be the way they are, and anecdotally, I think that a lot of the people around me, despite holding some outdated views, are good people. Therefore I believe that religion isn't inherently evil, it's what people make of it; I don't think that it's fair to blame the flaws of people on christianity. (Sorry for the run-on sentences haha, I had a lot to say)

Of course, your point of view is just as valid as mine. I'm sorry you had to deal with all of that as a kid, and I hope that life's been treating you better these days."

>We interpret the difference in sleep tendency after 14.5–18.5 h awake as ‘permissive’ or ‘enabling’ for later bedtimes in more mature versus less mature adolescents. This physiological ‘permission’ may then allow youngsters to respond to psychosocial pressures that also drive later sleep onset. Our findings based on SLT are also in line with other data pointing to a slower rate of sleep pressure accumulation in older compared with younger adolescents as indicated from simulations of SWA according to the two‐process model of sleep regulation.

From what I've, it still seems like you can combat these changes with proper lifestyle changes, they just entice you into sleeping later. Hell, I'd argue that i'm living proof of that. I went to bed at 5 AM last night and that's my usual holiday schedule, but I can and do revert to a normal schedule if I have to."
