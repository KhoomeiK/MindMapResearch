WEPES,ff5gic8,t1_ff4nq19,1579591850.0,Is it really? I've only had it for about 5 weeks but o swear the first one I did was different. It's mad that they're doing even less this year than last year. At least last year most weeks they had two com challenges and a co op one.
WEPES,ff4gy7v,t3_erfhpf,1579563357.0,The vs com mode is the same thing it's been for 3 bloody weeks.

Indiangirlsontinder,ff2ipro,t1_ff0tv0n,1579507898.0,Yeah so OP's point makes no sense whatsoever. His family being Hindu doesn't mean he has to be.
Indiangirlsontinder,ff2ioiw,t1_ff29sec,1579507852.0,He missed the point as did a bunch of others who can't read.
Indiangirlsontinder,ff2in1c,t1_ff1yogr,1579507799.0,"My point is that you can be in a Muslim family and be an atheist. Can you not be in a Hindu family and also be an atheist? How about just agnostic and temporarily and sometimes you believe and sometimes you don't? How about a deist?

I think you and a few others completely misinterpreted."
Indiangirlsontinder,fezwabc,t3_equqk8,1579462485.0,Is it not possible to be non-Hindu in a Hindu family? I don't know much about the religion. Does she mean culturally? I know for example that you can be an atheist but from a Muslim family.

He did it to gall when Dan Hardy was on and gall was really angry with him over it and told him to his face when he turned up like a year later.

Your argument is as smart as saying all fighters love the ufc and feel like they're paid well because they keep fighting for them."

Indiangirlsontinder,fdpbwss,t3_ema2ts,1578624771.0,"There was a post on this sub yesterday where a guy mentioned doggy style to a girl. It was as play on words where he said his dog was called Style and she said she liked his dog. She then unmatched and people said she lost out. Lol. It was a really obvious and unwitty joke that only the harmless virgin section of this sub would think was a good setup and line. 

If you're dropping sex jokes in the first few messages and the joke isn't even clever don't be surprised when she unmatches. To me it came off as obvious that he was using a sex joke as a proxy to see if she was comfortable with the subject being broached. ""SMOOOTH"" said, presumably, 19 year old social reject probably called rajpinder."
Indiangirlsontinder,fdpbfye,t1_fdnwm1e,1578624446.0,In your headline you called it a dating app. Friendship is not dating.
Indiangirlsontinder,fdpbc2t,t3_ema2ts,1578624372.0,"I read and agree with your first 2 lines. However, if a guy looks great and/or has a great job, it IS a hook up app for a lot of women.

You also have to ask men just how interesting they find most women and whether or not they therefore think it's worth getting to know them.

I feel like there's a lot of men who need to heed your words but also a lot of women who need to have more interesting hobbies than ""good food, music and the gym""."
90s,fdp8ba2,t3_emcv24,1578622354.0,Aww cute. I remember the pokemon craze. We were obsessed at school for about 2 or 3 years. Those games were awesome around the age of 9.
Cringetopia,fdnttie,t3_elxzz6,1578592699.0,It's just a joke. If it's a joke it's fine. We can't whine about women not letting us make rape jokes if we whine about them doing it. You don't have to sink to their standards. Just point out the hypocrisy and keep making rape jokes yourself.
Indiangirlsontinder,fdnt7fu,t3_em7cf6,1578592348.0,"I thought that was lame. Downvote me, witless virgins."

Tinder,fdlitno,t1_fdligfy,1578524963.0,"A comment here and there versus you listing ""100 examples"" of diss tracks. The latter is a bigger waste of time and far more negative. Speaking about eazy-e you said,
""One of the dozen hoes he rawdogged"".
You're pretty bitter. Be nice to women. Don't be fake here for brownie points. Women aren't hoes just because they have sex, dude."
Tinder,fdli1ha,t1_fdlhnnx,1578524465.0,"That's not the definition of the term but given your lack of reading comprehension in your first reply I'm not surprised.

""I got what you don't"". Yeah, insecurities wrt to the fact that you don't get laid but want to flex about it in a reddit thread. Suggests you, as your uneducated self would put it, don't got nuttin'."
Tinder,fdlhg5k,t1_fdlbv97,1578524098.0,"That's a lot of bitterness there, fella. Never said there were no funny women but you ran a mile with that one. And that pussy shaming thing doesn't work unless you're talking to someone who doesn't get laid so again, your attack was not effective!

Lighten up."
WEPES,fdl5cui,t1_fdkvhzg,1578517317.0,"Haha the funny thing is that I quite football games, playing football and following it back in 2008 and came back in 2019 so last year's PES is the only one apart from 20 that I've played in a decade and off the pitch it's the exact same game. Literally. There is no difference beyond matchday. 

On the pitch it's significantly better but the demo was even better again."

facepalm,fdkw4eh,t3_elu06i,1578512379.0,But this is what feminism looks like today. It's all about treating women as equals but also affording them privileges. They can't make their mind up and they often don't have to because people are afraid to challenge them in public.
MMA,fdkvxf8,t1_fdkuohl,1578512264.0,True but most of them are just doing this for humour.
WEPES,fdkmw9q,t3_elntnt,1578506875.0,"I agree that the dribbling and grinding is bad. I disagree in that the weekly updates are just not interesting at all. You get almost the same shit every week that can usually be completed inside 45 mins. The loading times are SO terrible. A few seconds every screen. How about the optimisation after a match? After each game you get a screen for gp, manager contract, elo changed, players out of contract and I might have even forgotten something. This should be consolidated into one summary screen where you hit start to move on or can press a button to look at each thing. 

There are many other issues with the game but these are my quick comments on your post. I think you were right about most things."
facepalm,fdjp044,t1_fdi44fk,1578481602.0, Because shit like this happens all the time but we have to pretend that it doesn't because there's not been a study as if anyone could get a grant for it.

""
If you apply a force over a given distance - you have done work.  Work = Change in Energy. If an object’s kinetic energy or gravitational potential energy changes, then work is done.""

 ""In general, the energy transferred depends on the amount of force and the distance over which that force is exerted."".

Work = F x D.

Hence if you punch through the target, which increases D, more work (kinetic energy) is done (transferred).
