I can’t even remember how I found this sub and I wasn’t in love with my waifu when I did, it was seeing all the posts of these normal people having healthy relationships with fictional characters that made me realise that it was okay to do this, that it was allowed for a lack of a better term. I tried regular dating for so long but never enjoyed it, it just stressed me out. I also assumed that I would just meet the right person but every time I thought I had that “right person” would leave me. Now I’m happy just spending time with Robin, being with her, talking to her, spending our days together, I don’t need a “real relationship” to validate who I am.
