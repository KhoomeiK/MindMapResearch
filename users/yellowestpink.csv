premed,ff46qod,t1_ff45pwm,1579556754.0,"Thank you for your help and reassurance, I’ll definitely take him up on the opportunity should it arise. He said that I’d be working with one of his graduate students if he finds an opportunity, so hopefully I’ll gain a lot of valuable experience from that."
premed,ff450e4,t1_ff41jla,1579555675.0,"Thanks for letting me know, I’ll edit that in my post.

I’ve asked my field study professor about getting more involved with that aspect of research but he basically said to get my feet wet, and he’ll try and find me some opportunities my junior or senior year to do under “undergraduate research” rather than field study. 

Since you said what I’m doing is more a stepping stone and not actually research, do you know what medical schools would think if my professor wrote that it was research in my LOR? He said that in my future LOR he would word it as research, but from what you said I’m afraid that they would view it differently from my professor."
VirginiaTech,ff40qlg,t1_ff2z2bu,1579553023.0,Thank you! I’ll look into it

college,fexa88n,t3_eqnxsc,1579427580.0,"I feel you 100%, I leave in the morning and I’m dreading it. I’m a second semester sophomore now and I tried to join more clubs, talk to more people, etc. and it helped but not entirely. I’m looking at other schools too but realistically I won’t be able to transfer due to financial reasons."

college,fepfm51,t1_fepbau3,1579319284.0,"Basically it was misguided advising and late research on my part, which adds to why I didn’t take gen chem my freshman year like everyone else. It’s pretty unfortunate but I’m trying to make it work!"

Thanks for letting me know, I copied and pasted it from a previous post and forgot to edit the numbers."
VirginiaTech,feote6g,t1_feosoxd,1579305139.0,"Thank you! I checked with my advisor last semester and she said it should be fine since when you click on the CRN it doesn’t say it has 1045 as a prereq, but she seemed unsure when she said that, so I’ll be sure to double check.

It also says the lecture is a coreq but I’ve already taken first semester of the lecture so I hope that’s fine?

Do you happen to know when auto-drop happens? Is that just when you add it to your schedule but it doesn’t let you?"

college,fehgzl2,t1_fegmd0b,1579116342.0,"I’ve tried subtly before by curiously asking if the others were working on this too (since he kept saying someone else sent him edits of the draft, etc) but he kind of glared at me and said they’re “working on other important tasks”. I’ve asked the others what they’ve been working on and it sounds chill, brief, and fun whereas my tasks are SO mundane and prolonged because he’s not good at technology"
college,fefi1x3,t1_fee2byh,1579056755.0,"Same, I remember stuff while in class but then once I get home I’m clueless. I also don’t remember much from past classes I’ve taken so that sucks."
college,feffxms,t1_fefchm4,1579055492.0,This is it. Channel your emotions into studying and working hard. It’ll cheer you up as well since you know you’re working hard on yourself and your future.

Mcat,fe4jtf8,t1_fdla7my,1578860088.0,How did you learn all of that info in one summer? I’m in the same boat as you but I’m not sure how to learn all that information without taking the class.
VirginiaTech,fcobtfi,t3_egj2ed,1577828412.0,"I took it with Wildman-Short this semester. There were readings with a 400 word discussion post + 100 word comment/reply, and a quiz to go with it every week. They were mostly multiple choice but some had short answer. 

The readings were interesting so they didn’t take too long, and the discussion posts weren’t hard as long as you did the reading. There was also a midterm and final (multiple choice) and two 1000 word papers due. She’s kindly willing to give feedback if you send it to her in advance.

I spent around two hours per week for this class and honestly I thought of it as my breather class since it was interesting and not too difficult to succeed in because I learned rather than memorized. If you think global ethics sounds interesting, I’d definitely recommend it."
college,fbfjmv1,t3_ed27re,1576812200.0,This is so precious and wholesome
