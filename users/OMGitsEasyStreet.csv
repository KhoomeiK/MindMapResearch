The cult around praising pit bulls only exists because there’s a cult around demonizing them as if they’re all monsters because of their history, even though there are many gentle and very loyal pit bulls out there.

Most of the time when people demonize pits I notice they aren’t from America and don’t understand that a lot of pits are no longer inherently aggressive. Every pit I’ve ever owned or known has been very sweet, and the few of them I’ve seen get attacked by other dogs didn’t even retaliate.

politics,fepd4y8,t1_fepaxp3,1579317584.0,"I remember going from papa johns pizza delivered to the school to what tasted like the pizza you get in Lunchables. 

We lost our snack shack that sold cookies, slushees, ice cream sandwiches, chips, soft pretzels and nachos with cheese and drinks. 

The only upside was the veggies and fruit cups, which most kids opted out of and literally just ate a slice of crappy pizza, however I love fruits and veggies so I always got extra. 

It’s a shame to see Trump do this honestly, but there were a few downsides to the switch, which should’ve been improved upon and not gutted

It’s the fucking worst. Barely any of the upvoted comments are constructive, they’re all just insulting Trump, but of course once I sort by controversial I get the comments that actually bring up good points that I was looking for.

science,fejoy3q,t1_fejgxjz,1579182036.0,"I know this probably isn’t my place but keto is very very bad for your heart and cholesterol. My mom did keto for months and was scolded by her doctor because of the damage she did to her body by consuming all of those fats and red meats. Cutting sugars and carbs is great but eliminating them completely can be unhealthy.

Keto may help you lose weight but the best way to lose weight without negative side effects is to keep a balanced diet and exercise. There are rarely any fad diets that are balanced well, hence the weight loss.

Edit: as someone pointed out, keto isn’t inherently bad if done properly, but many people aren’t interested in studying it enough to know whether it’s right for them, or how to do it properly. My advice would be to consult your doctor before making any drastic changes to your diet, even if the internet says it’s healthy."

I agree with this, but I think Bernie is a step in the right direction. He’s got the drive to at least put things in motion, so future presidents can tweak and improve on the things he puts in place.  

If there’s anyone who has it in them to spark a political revolution it’s Bernie. How long it will take for that spark to light a fire is the concerning part, but even if Bernie’s influence takes decades to make a meaningful impact, it’ll still be a positive impact."

I mean the ancient one literally says in Endgame that Strange does not make mistakes. He’s on such a high horse because he’s got the power and wisdom to know exactly how important his knowledge and influence is.

He’s always been full of himself, because he’s always been the best at what he does. That’s just who he is."

Basically it’s really hard to have a good K/D when you’re going up against people who are your skill level or better.

My K/D was climbing gradually the majority of my play time until recently I was put into a higher skill bracket, making it way harder to go positive because everyone I was playing was a lot better than who I was playing against while I was less experienced. 

Ever since the change in difficulty my K/D has gone from 1.35 to 1.08. So it’s better to just accept that your K/D will be lower than your K/D in the older call of duties because otherwise you’re gonna get really frustrated trying to keep it up."

Because Take Two wants to please shareholders and they know micro-transactions make hella money so they tell their game studios to integrate micro-transactions in a way that makes people want to buy them. 

Just look at 2k basketball. That game IS pay to win. I know fools who have spent 100’s of dollars on the new installment every year just to stomp on people who actually want to level up their palyer without paying to skip the grind.
