That may not be enough adventure though, so research the rock hounding opportunities to the west in the desert for the more adventurous digging. No fees unless you want to spend thirty bucks to have a preleveled campsite for 2 weeks with no other amenities. 

Some areas to research there are Hauser geode beds, Coon Hollow, Wiley's Well district, and the entire south east of california in general.

You could probably pick just about any spot in that desert, dig a five foot wide hole straight down and eventually you will find something worth keep. The area is just littered with *stuff*.

While there are some issues with certain areas being claimed, they are few and far between compared to other more famous areas like Mt Antero.

>Do you understand the meaning of the word ""surplus"" or are you just being intentionally obtuse? Having a finite number of resources does not automatically make it a zero-sum game.

What surplus? The country is running a deficit. 

Because resources are finite, like I was saying.

>Did you just pull that ratio straight out of your ass? Maybe. In any case, I've already answered this above.

It costs around 20k to take care of a homeless person in a group home and 705k for the prisoner. 

>I am talking about solutions that don't involve life in prison. Interesting how the first place you went is forced labor. As a matter of fact, I would also like to see people helped before they go to jail. Do you see the irony in you saying that or does it elude you?

What? Someone that is so dangerous that they killed half a dozen people and injured over a hundred is too dangerous to allow in public. They had a chance to be a part of society but rejected it by doing meth until they decided to try to kill a train full of people in the process of serving their own selfish interests.

There is no world where it is fair, just, or acceptable to subject innocent people to the risk of ever being around someone that self centered and dangerous. Letting them ever go is absolutely crazy talk on your part. 

As for repaying their debt, it can absolutely never be done, so they can never repay their debt. 

That means too dangerous to be free, and too in debt to society to ever be free. Under what circumstances could you possibly imagine letting this person go?

It has already been established that forcing prisoners to earn their keep is not legal, so I am not sure what point you are making.

I would much rather see a dangerous piece of shit in jail than killing more people. I would rather see people helped before they even get to jail.

>Again, you are assuming this is a zero-sum game. Also, you are putting words in my mouth by assuming I am saying this person is ""more worthy"" of help than others. At no point have I made that assertion.
