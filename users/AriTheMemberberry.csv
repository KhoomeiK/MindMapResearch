Like, fondant sucks, but it's easy to work with for beginners and time restrictions, and I would'a thought she did this professionally if she never mentioned that she just watches baking shows. If she wants to move up to buttercream eventually, that would be rad as hell, but for now, fondant works for looks. She's definitely got talent. 

Edit: Also happy Birthday to her"

But I do agree that a lot of these memes are disrespectful to the victims. Like, yeah they're funny, but these memes often make Greg seem like a half-crazed former internet sensation trying to regain former glory (which he is, let's be honest.) BUT Greg is a dangerous and unpredictable predator, some of these are like telling someone it's okay to approach a cornered and threatened animal.
