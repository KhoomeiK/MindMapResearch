The conventions aren't orgy parties either, like in that one CSI episode (That's notorious for getting everything wrong) if that's what you're implying. Many children go to these conventions as well. To sum up my point, I fail to see how it shows ""how you get off"". The definition if being a furry is just being interested in the idea of anthropomorphic animals, like Disney's robin hood, or zootopia. I'm not going to deny that the sexual portion of the fandom is rather large, but the furry fandom in itself is by no means sexual exclusively."

One of the things i've learned over time is that there's essentially two types of ABA: There's True ABA therapy (i'll refer to it as ABA from here on) and there's False ABA (i'll refer to this as NotABA)  
Basically there's two types: ABA focuses on... what essentially is torture for the autistic child or person. The person who developed this ""therapy"" didn't even see autistic people as human. It was designed so that the parents would end up with a ""normal"" child, without even thinking about the mental state of the autistic person. Because like i said: they weren't thought of as human. This resulted in many autistic people who went through it to end up having severe depression, PTSD, and many even attempting suicide. Autistic people are already at an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicide- so, ABA REALLY doesn't help. it gets the parents their ""normal"" child that autism ""stole"" from them, but isn't an actual therapy. it's abuse, wearing the mask of therapy.  
NotABA on the other hand is simply labeled as ABA so that insurance covers it's costs, but it's actually helpful. It's actually a variety of different methods, not one, so there's a vast difference in each of the methods used, but the majority of them are helpful towards the autistic person, and not harmful. I don't believe this is the case for all of them though.  
I'm not familiar with FatheringAutism, so i can't exactly say whether what they good, but i don't believe autistic people should be trained like dogs as you describe. It doesn't sit right with me. If the person can't or doesn't speak, let them sit in silence. it isn't harming anyone to do so.  


anyway that's about as much as i can think of off the top of my head, so i hope this helps! Have a good rest of your day, my guy!"
