AskReddit,femidas,t3_epkaux,1579257111.0,"My dad worked as a sort of ""right-hand man"" in the military of the place we lived in as kids. It was a dictatorship and he worked closely with the leaders/rulers of the capital city and country. My older brother at the time was in the beginning of 2nd grade but he was/is incredibly smart and my parents thought it would be better for him to be in the grade above. The school agreed but couldn't find a place for him for some random reasons, it was seeming like they were made up though. My mum didn't buy it. So my dad was talking with his bosses (The rulers of the country) at work explaining the situation and his boss just says ""Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it for you."" and my dad insisted he shouldn't get involved and sort of left it at that. The next day my brother was moved up to grade 3.

Also when you say something and the person you're talking to heard it but didn't understand what you said but they don't respond assuming it wasn't a question or a talking point and then you're in that awkward phase of, if I say it again it will be awkward because they'll realise that's what I said in the first place but if I change the subject the awkwardness just lingers there for much longer and eventually you'll have to circle back round to the original thing you said anyway."

I've dreamt about peeing in my dreams 3 times and only once did I actually do it and I woke up during it. Also, how can you wake yourself up in a dream unless it's a lucid dream? Then you wouldn't be peeing anyway."
Showerthoughts,fek22r5,t1_fejzybv,1579190955.0,I'd assume we didn't have a solution or even a problem with it until we realised disease and illness were a thing. Since before then people probably didn't know the difference between urine and water considering that's the only thing we drank back then. It kinda reminds me of how my cat will never drink out of my drink unless it's plain water because otherwise it just smells like nasty chemicals. Humans are very weird as the only species who willingly drink things that are not water and bad for us.

MorbidReality,fdpdcoa,t1_fdnsge8,1578625762.0,I mean the title is pretty inaccurate and the article seems to be lacking a lot of factual statements.
