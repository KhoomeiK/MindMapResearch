Overwatch,ff4poyl,t3_erfg7p,1579569447.0,I hope to one day have such a long and epic match in comp.
corgi,ff4nqy0,t3_eri0nw,1579568081.0,I wish I had lived closer to my breeder so I could have played with my Lulu at those younger ages. So cute.
Overwatch,ff4jntc,t1_ff4ietn,1579565231.0,Are you referring to reticle bloom? Is it bad to use bloom? Should I just stick to a fixed cross hair?
corgi,fevzq5w,t3_eqj7ng,1579403530.0,Sable and fluffy. Best corgi combo.
corgi,fekwnjc,t3_epa7ta,1579209138.0,Cookies and cream corg.
corgi,fcausks,t1_fcato7g,1577577028.0,Good to know. And I’m so glad I see yours is sable with the white in the middle going to the forehead. Mine’s like that too and I feel like all the sables I see are nothing but completely dark foreheads.
corgi,fcath8w,t3_egsfx2,1577576291.0,At what age we’re you able to tell she was sable? My 10 week appears to have that crown starting and dark lined ears.
PrequelMemes,fbyg7j9,t3_ef47bw,1577216100.0,Of course he wouldn’t. It’s Mitchell from Modern Family.
