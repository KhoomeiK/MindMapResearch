In fact I couldn't even bother to finish it, once you figured out a working strategy, every battle was just a steamroll. In any case I recommend it to any fans of the franchise"
gaming,feq09a9,t1_fepsum4,1579335472.0,"They did it with Witcher 3 too, afaik. I think they desperately want to put it out before the new consoles are published. Then they can re-release it for PS5 and the new Xbox in a couple of years."
Suomi,fdqsk27,t1_fdq69f9,1578673964.0,"Metsistä kerätyn puutavaran jalostus ja käyttö on sellaista, että puuhun sitoutunut hiili siirtyy keruun jälkeen keskimäärin n. 5-10 vuoden kuluttua ilmakehään. Järeällä puurungolla taasen kestää useita vuosikymmeniä lahota. Eli hiilijuttuja silmällä pitäen tällä perusteella hiili pysyy sitoutuneena pidempään ja kokonaishiilivarasto suurimmillaan, jos kuolleet puut jätetään metsään, mikä tukee myös luonnon monimuotoisuutta. Toki paljon riippuu siitä, miten sitä puuta käytetään."

todayilearned,fddxr1m,t1_fdduece,1578326541.0,"Well, many species have become endangered or gone entirely extinct within Finland because of forestry. The natural ecosystems of the forests and the populations of many organisms that live in them are continuing to diminish. It should be clear, that based on that, the forestry practices aren't ecologically sustainable. We should amend those trajectories before we can call our forestry practices sustainable. The definition of sustainability that is agreed upon states that for something to be sustainable, it should be sustainable economically, socially, and ecologically. And from this point of view, the forestry practices in Finland are pretty much garbage."
todayilearned,fddvnp3,t1_fddrgfc,1578325105.0,"Definitely not. Loggings destroy the ecosystems of the forests. They would regenerate over time but typically the logged natural forests are replaced by managed forests (""tree plantations"") which support much lower biodiversity than natural forests. That is, if the forests aren't replaced by agriculture or infrastructure which is even worse, obviously.
   
Considering carbon stuff, natural forests store a lot more carbon than managed forests do. A cut down tree might continue to be a carbon store if for example a house is built out of it, which remains for a long time and might also replace carbon-heavy materials like cement. However most of trees are turned into things like toilet paper or newspapers and the carbon store gets lost almost immediately."
todayilearned,fddunvm,t1_fddjxyn,1578324407.0,"Around 70% of annual growth is harvested, which hardly is ""only a fraction."" And of the remaining portion a notable share of growth is in protected areas which are off-limits anyways."
todayilearned,fdduazs,t1_fddqglr,1578324155.0,"The Finnish forestry practices are great compared to a lot of other countries around the world, but the bar isn't set very high. In terms of ecological sustainability, Finland too has a lot of room for improvement."

explainlikeimfive,fabela9,t1_faapawk,1575922036.0,"What you describe is a bottleneck event, which is one way how genetic drift may occur. More generally, genetic drift refers to disappearance of genes/traits by random factors, i.e. not because of natural selection. For example, if by pure happenstance short haired dogs manage to reproduce more and in some generations all individuals would be short haired, that would be genetic drift. Importantly in genetic drift the better reproduction success is not because the trait improves fitness - that would be natural selection. Genetic drift can even act against natural selection and reduce the fitness of a population. It is probably quite intuitive to understand why genetic drift is more likely to occur in small populations, as traits are less likely to randomly disappear in large populations. That's why small population size is  a risk for the long term viability of the population."
