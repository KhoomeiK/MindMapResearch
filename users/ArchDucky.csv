Doom,ff9x5yl,t3_esfc7o,1579723439.0,"Im super worried about the hub world.  I think an out of place giant base full of unlockable content is a red flag.  I really hope the game doesn't have microtransactions but this ""Fortress of Doom"" kinda scares me. They delayed the game for no specific reason.  The footage between Quake Con and now looks practically identical, so whats with the delay?  Was it too add MTX?  They never said one word about this base until it was just shown yesterday."
