fatlogic,ff6jn70,t3_ervuu1,1579628616.0,"I have this odd issue, when I was 177lbs, I could get a bar of chocolate and make it last several days. Now, I'm currently 119lbs, I can't make a bar of chocolate last half a day. I seriously don't know what happened or why, if I try, I spend the rest of the day thinking about it and end up eating it anyway. 

I bought a packet of Mayland cookies the other day because they were half price and I fancied them, haven't had cookies in a while. I ate 12 between 2pm and 6pm, I felt like I couldn't stop and just spent all day thinking about them. I used to only have 3 a day with a cup of hot chocolate.

I end up ruining it for myself by having too many in a short period of time and ruining my weight loss. I'm 7lbs away from my goal and all those cookies set my back another lb."

I'm working on his sleep, the doctor didn't have anything to say about it and the health visitor's been helping me out with it the last few months. His issue is that he's too reliant on me and doesn't know how to get himself of too sleep, I don't bother getting my partner up because by the time he's gotten up and gone to him, I'm up, awake, and have dealt with the situation much sooner. It's a fault on my part."

fatlogic,feelzpv,t3_eomg76,1579036458.0,"I've been watching Secret Eaters in YouTube lately and I cannot believe how almost everyone on the show just aren't aware of how much they're eating. One person literally ate 12,000 calories over one weekend!

""I just have a slow metabolism.""

""I've been to the doctors and nothing's wrong.""

How. Can. You. Not. Realise??? That's enough good for six days. Six whole days. 

Also, is slow metabolism a thing? I see people blame their weight on it, but then the show reveals that they're eating 3000-4000 calories and they manage to lost at least half a stone in 10 weeks."

i used to work as a midday meals supervisor, you should see what was in a child's lunchbox. A ham sandwich, a banana, a packet of crisps and a bottle of fruit shoot. Sounds okay, right? Wrong. The lunch also came with a packet of cookies, a yoghurt, dairylea dunkers, a teddy bear brownie and a cheese string. This was every day. I know he wasn't eating all of it but that's just too much food and most of it was junk food."

fatlogic,fco7nhh,t3_ei3zsk,1577825652.0,"What do you say in a conversation about weight?

I normally avoid it, but I'm part of a group chat and people were sharing pictures of themselves as they weren't happy about their weight. One person said they were 5'6"" and 279lbs, another one said they were 5'5"" and 176lbs. A third person then said not to worry because everyone in the chat group is overweight except Carly (I haven't shared my weight loss with them).

And Calry just jumped into the chat and went on about how everyone is beautiful, nobody needs to lose weight. But someone said they're almost 300lbs, that's not healthy. Yes, they look pretty, but they definitely need to lose weight. I don't understand why they say those things."
