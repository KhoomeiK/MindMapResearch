And if they are then demanding he apologize and her behavior at the airport when he was leaving makes more sense... kind of."

90DayFiance,ff6j86n,t1_ff6ikwg,1579628365.0,"I mean, if my fiance suddenly told me they didn't love me, I probably wouldn't want to hear what they had to say especially if I was leaving for home in a few hours. Walking away so that he didn't say something he regretted later is smart. You can't force someone to love you once they say they don't and I'm pretty sure he realized that and wanted to just get his stuff and go. 

Natalie was patronizing him. It's emotional abuse. 

And all of this doesn't matter anyway because they've already been spotted together. Made for great TV, though, didn't it?"
90dayfianceuncensored,ff6ihah,t1_ff6hqby,1579627908.0,Not saying he's anywhere near a good person but calling him a pedo for marrying another adult is silly. Julianna isn't a teenager or a child.
90DayFiance,ff6ht16,t3_erwv6f,1579627497.0,"I don't see how not wanting to engage in a fight with someone who has said they don't love you is childish, but ok. I think he was very tired and the whole trip was just weighing on him. Childish is petting another adult and assuring them that *their parents* love them after you've thrown your engagement ring into their suitcase. IDK, I think he had a pretty mature response to it when he could have been super nasty to her."

90DayFiance,ff5xj1p,t3_erswyy,1579613522.0,"We only get a small look into what their life is like but I can only imagine how annoying Blake and his friends are drunk since they're borderline unbearable sober. There is literally nothing worse than being the sober one in a group of loud, obnoxious drunks. I don't think it's off-base for Jasmin to wish Blake wouldn't drink when they are together."
90dayfianceuncensored,ff3wvii,t3_erg1s7,1579550609.0,"Believing in something no one has ever seen doesn't make you immature. If that was the case, you'd have to put Natalie, all of Christianity and Judaism, and any religion that believes in God, gods, Creator, etc., in the same category. I think Mike showed a lot of restraint in the face of someone demanding he apologize after they told him they didn't love him, not to mention the fact that he didn't lash out when she was rubbing him like a dog and patronizing his feelings. 

Natalie should break up with Mike because she's not stable enough to be in a relationship."

He was right."
90dayfianceuncensored,ff3ft3v,t3_er5mtj,1579540168.0,"Nah. Blake probably spends a huge portion of his day with his friends making ""music"". She's not out of bounds for wanting alone time with the person she's supposed to be marrying really soon. And I've never heard a responsible adult talk about ""pre-gaming"" before a birthday party so... there's that."
90dayfianceuncensored,ff3f9oy,t3_er64ut,1579539868.0,"She reminds me of every vapid, shallow high school girl that never grew out of being vapid and shallow because high school was the best years of their life.

90DayFiance,ff2tlzx,t3_er94wj,1579523639.0,"That whole ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" comment really threw me off. Robert didn't deny that he told Anny to NOT bring clothes because he wanted to treat her to new ones... but he does have the audacity to act like she's wild for expecting them all at once. Clothing is a pretty basic need, you know? If you're telling someone to leave their things behind (my guess is because he felt it was cheaper than paying extra at the airport or shipping fees), then you better be ready to at least get them a week's worth of outfits the minute they get off the plane."

90DayFiance,femvy9d,t3_epzl05,1579271035.0,"I really didn't care either way about them in the beginning of the season because they seemed like a typical 'younger ""model"" and her sugar daddy' pairing. The inclusion of the kids and the ex was a little iffy (I think it's great that Michael and Sarah seem dedicated to remaining friends because it does make the co-parenting easier) but Julianna's forced childishness and Michael's over the top sweating made the whole thing really gross really fast. I think it tipped over for me when instead of handling the pre-nup thing like two adults, Michael just threw up his hands and said forget it while Julianna gave her gross Daddy Husband cheek kisses. The IG stuff feels less ""Here's my trophy wife"" and more ""We'll start the bidding at..."" 

They just don't seem that nice to me."

Journaling,fcxdyzv,t3_ejccc3,1578060387.0,"So, what really helped me get the most out of journaling was to stop thinking that anyone but me was ever going to read it. I think we sometimes get performative with our journaling so that we can a) share pages of it and b) have it in the back of our heads that someone is one day going to read these and I personally didn't want to come off as a short-fused Scorpio (which is exactly what I am). 

Once I got it in my mind that, hey, these are just for me, it really changed how/why I journal. And not every day is a new transformative essay BUT I have been able to work through a lot of stuff by writing it down because the act of getting out my feelings without lashing out is pretty awesome."
Journaling,fcuywh3,t3_eikoqt,1577991277.0,I got my current journal from Hobby Lobby for $1.50 on clearance and it's actually the nicest journal I've ever owned with no bleed-through on any medium I've used. I also buy pens/markers when they're on sale or I check Etsy for when people are destashing. I just 10 zebra mildliners and 2 Micron pens for maybe $12? It doesn't have to be expensive!
Journaling,fcuyhs3,t3_eilk8o,1577991056.0,"I have journals from waaaay back in the day (maybe late 90s/early 00s) that haven't faded a bit... and I'm pretty sure my parents were buying me cheap ballpoint pens at that point in my childhood. I have noticed that the ones that I used a mechanical pencil on have smeared a good bit but that could be the quality of paper, also."
Journaling,fcuy6vc,t3_eilk90,1577990883.0,"I use one book for my journal, planner, and art/doodle journal because keeping separate books just felt overwhelming to me. I generally do year long trackers (books, creative projects, mandolin hours, etc.,) at the front and then do 3 months worth of weekly spreads then journal/create behind that. I find it easy to clip all of those pages together at the end of that three months and then do another 3 months of weekly spreads."
Journaling,fcu9myv,t1_fcti9pl,1577975823.0,"I've bought the majority of them from GoatGirlMH on Etsy. I get a lot of samples from MyLove4Washi because she has some really cute Halloween/witchy designs that I love but wouldn't necessarily ever need a whole roll of. And both of them usually send an extra washi as a gift! 

I've also ordered from KawaiiPenShop (their tapes are great but I have yet to receive a pen from them that wasn't damaged) and I occasionally buy from Hobby Lobby/Michaels but only when they're on clearance. I've never found that those craft stores carry really excellent tape but I do use them for blocking when I'm painting a page."
90DayFiance,fcnsex5,t3_ehvy9p,1577817526.0,"Everyone seems to hate Jasmine but... I kind of feel like Blake is to blame for a lot of this? I think she's probably really shy and reserved and I think Blake probably fed her a bunch of lies before she got over here. Like, his friends reacting so weirdly about her being a stay-at-home Mom when Blake didn't even flinch when she said it because they've obviously talked about it and he's made her feel that sort of life is possible and what he wants, too. Blake seems like the champagne and caviar on a malt liquor budget type, too."
90DayFiance,fcnrh35,t3_ehw85x,1577817037.0,"The fact that Joey tries to talk about his feelings and express himself verbally instead of acting out and throwing punches says a whole lot about his maturity. I don't know what I would have done at his age if either of my parents had brought a stranger home that a) doesn't speak our language b) insults us his first night there by refusing to play video games (a way of bonding) and making a show of mocking our food and c) keeps us from his family like we're a dirty secret. Pile on top of that, all of these boys know their Mom has helped Mursel keep them a secret and she has clearly picked him over them... I think they're the most mature people in that house."

90DayFiance,fcmxcc5,t1_fcl2bde,1577796417.0,"It's pretty telling that Anna's ""favorite"" didn't choose her for comfort when he was feeling upset. Also thinking about how he said something along the lines of how Mursel was supposed to do/show him stuff and it makes me think that Anna played like the boys were going to have a father in Mursel. I imagine Anna is a very absent parent, maybe in the room physically but definitely checked out from her children emotionally, so I can get where Leo's tears came from- not only did they NOT get a father figure, but they got another adult who ignored their basic emotional needs and now they'll have to deal with the fall-out from Bee Boy leaving. Those poor boys. I hope someone in their life puts them in therapy."

I was dealing with an undiagnosed mental illness, gay panic, and lots of friendship issues because I was painfully, painfully shy and my friend group were a bunch of extroverts. While I haven't trashed those journals, I have put them away so that I can't look at them. Maybe one day I'll be able to read those without feeling incredibly sorry for 14 year old me. She went through the roughs, for real."
