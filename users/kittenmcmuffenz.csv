I’ve suffered from both ailments for my whole life and I don’t feel much pain anymore from infections.  Even if it’s just wax an urgent care can help clear it.  Then you can go to the ent for a follow up regardless.

AskReddit,fdm92ji,t3_eluch8,1578542848.0,"I’ve had a few that are up there. 

For months if not longer when I dealt with the beginning onset of ulcerative colitis. Literally having a sheet touch me hurt, underwear hurt, of course sitting on the toilet hurt and that was before having to do my business.  I lost a lot of blood and was severely anemic and constantly freezing.  My husband couldn’t touch me without it hurting and I couldn’t eat or drink without severe cramping.  

Another is the myriad of foot issues I’ve had, and of course clumsy me, walked on a sprained ankle until the next morning when I could no longer walk and almost vomited from the pain.  Same thing when I broke my foot a few months ago and tried to walk on it before realizing it was broken.  

Last was a reaction I had to anesthesia.  It felt like the vein blew and was just pumping into my arm.  I was screaming obscenities and biting and drooling on the pillow while my arm felt like fire ants were eating me alive."

watercolor101,fddgil2,t1_fdd1xbe,1578311272.0,Sure it’s not complicated.  You basically paint on a gel pad then add a small amount of acrylic to help wet the paint and pad and press a piece of watercolor paper to it.  You end up with a mirror image with a lot of texture.  This is only my first try so I’m hoping to get better at transfers as I keep trying.

TwoXChromosomes,fctct2v,t3_eiidl0,1577939229.0,"Thank you for being you! I used to be that woman (obviously figuratively). I was abused by a boyfriend in public on holiday in Canada, and people just walked past us as he screamed at me and I was on my knees crying.   There was another time when he got super violent and trapped me in his house.  I had screamed out the windows for help and for someone to call 911.  While he was choking me I remember thinking “it’s ok help is coming”.   He’s never came and it ended with a standoff between the two of us and he had a loaded shot gun.  Not fun times, but after getting away from that psycho, I heard a neighbor berating his girlfriend across the street and i marched over there and gave him a piece of my mind and invited the girl over.  I guess maybe I had to go through that so I would be able to help others in that situation.

Parenting,fcmdskj,t3_ehwpc6,1577771662.0,"So I’m in your boat too. Super jelly of my friends with the awesome family that lives nearby and watches the kids so they can work or have a date night or whatever.   But then again you could have family like us that wants us to travel all around the state and country to visit them (no one is local) and then have the gall to make remarks like “he’s too old for this” or “he shouldn’t ask like that at his age” or the other multitude of stupid questions and not asked for advice that gets flung our way.  
So the plus side is the piece of mind you can have.  All of the work to be consistent with the kids will and has paid off. You don’t have to get your kid back from grandma’s who’s hyped up on sugar, spoiled rotten, lacking sleep (don’t even get me started how my mother in-law cosleeps with my sleep-trained child... too late I’m started...) because the only way he can sleep now is with someone next to him.  Ugh.   So I will continue to be jealous of my friends with functional families and know that it’s ok to not have everyone in our family trying to help out."
