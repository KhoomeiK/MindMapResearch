vipassana,fespx8y,t1_feso5rh,1579367784.0,"In the Thai forest tradition they might focus on the rising and falling of the abdoben rather than the breath at the nostrils. Or they might practice noting, in which you sort of mentally describe every sensation that arises with one word.

Pretty much any technique is going to boil down to either watching how sensations change or noting exactly what they are or it isn't vipassana."

vipassana,fesngt0,t3_eqi1y4,1579367102.0,"In general, samatha is when you're looking at an overall concept like ""the breath"" or ""a flame"" and vipassana is when you're looking at the actual sensations or mental formations which make up that concept.

Samatha requires some some of stability of the object to maintain concentration. The objects of vipassana are ever changing.

Neither samatha nor vipassana are specific techniques, they are broad categories of techniques. General vipassana is like, ""look at the actual sensations which make up your moment to moment experience"". Goenka has specific directions on exactly how to do that.

Hope this helps!"
