CassiustheComedianCat,fdngtrz,t3_em9d4f,1578585505.0,This feed is like water torture. It isn’t one. It’s the steady stream. I’m done. I’m just so done.

cats,fcyajsb,t3_ejgbrc,1578077174.0,How does Emmett get his paws into the goodie pocket at the base of his tail?  Shouldn’t the pocket be on the belly side?  Sorry; this is the sort of stupid stuff I notice.
neuroscience,fcyadr3,t1_fcxnnew,1578077085.0,"I’m not a physician, but if you’re noticing a pattern, which it sounds like you are, it may be worth following up. Speech is produced in Broca’s area, which is very sensitive to stress in general. It could be that your partner is stressed or has something organic going on.  If this pattern has persisted, which it sounds like it has, it could mean that it has at least pre-dated your time in your partner’s life. If this is an “idiosyncrasy” that has virtually always been there, well, then, it’s probably just a feature. If it seems to be more pronounced recently, consider stress load or the possibility that something is going on and have it checked out.  I don’t know if this helps much, but I hope it does."
blunderyears,fcy5can,t1_fcxpa3l,1578075044.0,"That was a ghastly thing to do. I’m so sorry. Kids can do hateful things out of a need to feel superior, not understanding that there is, actually, no such thing as “superior.”  I’m so sorry.   I hope that your have-to-wear-stockings days are over.  I’ve always regarded them as instruments of frustration and humiliation."
blunderyears,fcy4l1g,t3_ejec73,1578074676.0,I’m just speechless. Just. Wow. LOL.
