AskReddit,ff5zev1,t3_ero8mj,1579615094.0,"13 year old me got into a load of shit. I was severely depressed, fucking around with concepts I shouldn't have...it was bad. Now, I'm doing far better academically, happy as hell, and have a fair collection of good friends. I look different, feel different, and my confidence has jumped. My personality and boundaries have improved."

secret,ff41ds0,t3_emjadm,1579553425.0,"I'm sorry, keeping such a secret is really difficult. I was lucky to have an accepting family. I truly do suggest keeping the secret as long as you can for your own safety. Be careful what you text too if your parents pry. That's how mine found out. Good luck, only a few years until you aren't forced to keep it to yourself. and I'm sure you'll find friends who won't treat you oddly. If you ever need to talk about this, my dm are open. <3"

Advice,fbw07hy,t1_fbvzx9f,1577138638.0,I don't think I ever made it obvious I took it seriously. I didn't really say anything when she told me that's something she wanted to do (joke or not.) I really don't know. Doesn't matter much anyways I suppose. She's just wasting her time because I won't fall for her.
