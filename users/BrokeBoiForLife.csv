facepalm,ff4at69,t1_ff4a2ix,1579559297.0,"I think you got confused by the fact that they are spelled differently. I’ll try to simplify your argument, so maybe you can understand why it makes no sense. It would be like someone saying that a cat is on the kingdom Animalia, and then someone saying, no it’s not, it’s an animal. I think you just got a bit confused because they sound alike. The biological definition of a panther is a member of the sub family of Felidae called Pantherinae. Pantherinae is made up of Panthera and Neofelis. Neofelis is a very small Genus, made up of 2 species, so Panthera makes up the majority of Pantherinae. To reiterate, panthers are members of Pantherinae. Pantherinae is made up of predominantly Panthera, with 2 additional species added to the Panther family under the Genus Neofelis. All members of the Panthera Genus are just as much a panther as any other members of Panthera. The point I would agree with you on is that no one who knows anything about biology would ever use the term panther unprompted. The only reason I used it is because the post used it. All the members of the panther subfamily are extremely identifiable, so one should always just identify them by their species."
