Not a stupid question! You just go into a SportsClips or whatever and say hey I'd like my head shaved, or at least buzzed, but I'd recommend a nice, clean shave for you due to the pattern. Also, good clothes sense, and facial hair is well-kept/on point.

My bf's bff recently shaved his head and put on a sweater he got for Christmas and he looked better than I think I've ever seen him look just from that, and he has/had/has a similar hair pattern to yours.

Snow is pretty when it's fresh, until you have to go exist in it. Or drive up a slight incline in it. Let's not forget freezing rain and black ice, which looks like nothing but is actually secret super slippery kill you dead ice. You can 'do a donut' in which your car spins in circles uncontrollably. This is not a good thing. You're taught to 'turn into the spin' so that you stop spinning sooner. If this happens, you pretty much just pray while your life flashes before your eyes. Piles of snow higher than a Mack truck in Walmart parking lots across the North. Dirty, grey snow lining every road. Gray skies. Seasonal depression. Really, just go for like, a weekend.

Scared of what they'll do to you, what they'll say to your family, your friends, your workplace, to compromise your relationships and/or cost you your job, all bc of their vindictive nature & lack of respect- They also disorient you & make you feel unstable/believe you're unstable even if you're perfectly sane, & nearly if not completely convince you that you're incapable of surviving without them, just because-

Have you been finding either roll-up bugs/isopods/armadillo bugs around the house and/or spiders with a grey looking butt and a reddish body? Bc if so, they may be biting her at night, especially if you live in a ground level or half-underground apartment/room.

For the record, those are called woodlice, and they are usually accompanied by the woodlouse spider, which has one heck of a set of fangs & bites when trapped between, say, the sheet and her back-

Other than that, check your laundry detergent and dryer sheets. They're probably both chemical, and if any product she's using has sulfates that could be it.

Plenty of sulfate free shampoos, conditioners, body washes, and facial cleansers on the market now.

I recommend Grove Collaborative for detergent & honestly just skipping the dryer sheets or getting wool dryer balls & scenting them with essential oil.

Regardless of the cause, get her to a dermatologist."
