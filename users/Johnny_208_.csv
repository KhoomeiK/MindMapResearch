Standard cab, long bed, dual 32 gal fuel tanks. 
I have a 76 c25 as well. 
It has 454, auto, and 410 rear gear. 

I have been wrong before and I’m sure someone will be able to give us an exact answer."

I can’t address each individual point but all I can say is that our speeds/feeds/ tip height are all preset. 
Plug in thickness, amperage (we have 4 heads), and it does the rest. 

That being said I will absolutely relay this info up the chain and thank you so much for the input. I genuinely appreciate your time and help.

Edit: Thank you to whomever gave this man gold. He def deserves it!!!"
ManufacturingPorn,felq59d,t1_felmsvc,1579228229.0,"Dude I appreciate your input. 
I haven’t been formally trained on the machine so I just know how to make it cut parts somewhat efficiently. 

We have been going through consumables at a high rate but we figured it was just how the machine ran. 
The Hornet rep trained my manager and the operator on how it “should be ran” and I’m just going off that. 
Any more input you have would be awesome. 
We’ve never done any edge piercing even though that’s an option."

ManufacturingPorn,felk0xo,t1_felhp7o,1579224034.0,"To be completely honest, 
I’m lead machinist, not burn table operator. 
Our operator passed away unexpectedly about 6 months ago and I just run the machine to keep production up. 
I don’t know the ins and outs of burning but was trained on the machine through our production manager. 
If there’s something I could be doing differently,  I’m all ears."
