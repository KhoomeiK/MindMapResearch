socialism,fbyyth9,t1_fbyxofh,1577230070.0,"it seems like your argument is basically reducing all human motivation to economic incentive. if that's your view that it might make sense to see racism as just a product of resource competition between different human populations. 

but I think you'll find that viewpoint is incredibly reductive and ignores a lot of the psychological and social factors that allow people to view entire subgroups of people as subhuman. it just isn't a good framework from which to understand what propagates racism. class relations are just one element of how humans have divided and organized themselves... racism runs deeper than just competitive advantage."
