 Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. 

Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… 

Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both.

 This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."""

depression,feuz84u,t3_eqkzx8,1579391427.0,Could it be that we start to see ourselves more in them as we grow older? I can see my characteristics in both my parents to some degree.
depression,fehi6t0,t3_ep636n,1579117045.0,Just bring it up with her not much else you can do. My ex started acting cold a month before breakup (it was going towards becoming long distance after 5 years). I didn't want to bother either because I thought it was because of her work stress but surprise surprise. You shouldnt be losing sleep just because she is acting like an a-hole. Might even want to call her although I know that can be hard to do. Main point is that just be honest with her. Thats how a relationship should be. Hope it turns out well.

depression,fdkv2r0,t3_el7fo7,1578511759.0,"I left a house party shitfaced when I was 14 or 15. Decided to jump off the nearby bridge. Why? I wish I knew, I've always just been this way. I dont float too good I guess. 2 of my friends went after me. One of them drove to me with a moped as I was climbing the railing. It was a shit plan to be honest I hate heights.... even drunk.

Met the love of my life only a year after. Had the best 5 years of my life with her after years of shit. Still I had bad thoughts but I did get better. Did a lot of growing I suppose. 

Thats just how it is, you dont get cured all of a sudden. But you learn to take strength from surviving each day. You learn to manage your shit, this I can promise you. There will be times of despair and times of happiness but it will never be as bad as what you have just went through. Now, my parents dont know about my attempt or my depression but I wish I could have had the strength to tell them early on. You have nothing to be ashamed of. This is a battle that can be fought alone sure, but you dont have to. Take the opportunity for help. There will come a point when you will be sick and tired of wanting to die for so long. And your only regret will be to not have taken action as early as possible. You are worthy of life. Kick the the shit out of the 2020's."
depression,fdg7yqf,t1_fdcpnfd,1578383826.0,Yeah I know what you mean. It really puts it into words.
depression,fdfz2yj,t3_el3i2s,1578374309.0,Sure but so is everyone else. And your ex can go eat shit.

collapse,fd228ns,t1_fcygrhd,1578140541.0,"Thats sounds really interesting! Would be nice to learn more about that whole shabanga. I wish there was some remote community near me, modern basic life isnt really that fulfilling."
depression,fb8b5ov,t1_fb5v9py,1576610100.0,And your comment proceeded to make me curious so I decided to check my personality type as well. I got mediator as well as an result. I don't remember ever even hearing about such but the results were terrifyingly accurate. It actually made me feel happy a bit or atleast understood.
