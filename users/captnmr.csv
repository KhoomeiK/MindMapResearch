homeautomation,ffeafz6,t1_ffe8ppx,1579841223.0,"I don't know if you're joking so I'll give a serious answer. There are several components that Sonos uses for whole-house streaming.  
\- Peer-to-Peer mesh wireless network. Only one speaker needs to be connected to the network. They establish their own WiFi network, do authentication, and exchange meta-data

\- Timing synchronization so they play the exact same data at the same time without any jitter so it doesn't sound like echo

\- Stream encoding. By using ""zero and ones"" I'm assuming you're referring to PCM encoding. They don't use PCM and as they're moving to higher bitstreams (and lossy/lossless compression), the CPU/ASIC must be able to decode fast enough for playback. 

\- Interface with external services. Sonos doesn't need a PC or server in the home. This means the speakers must connect to external services and obtain streams. Sonos streams content from Spotify using plaintext instead of an encrypted stream. As you can imagine, music platforms and rights holders are keen on enforcing encryption for content.

So yeah, despite the binary system being around for over 50 years, the encoding of the ""zeros and one"" has changed depending on the service over the years. Because it's a digital that must be processed, transforming the binary to sound requires processing. Unless it's PCM; which it's not.

So old sonos <-> old sonos will continue to work but old <-> new will most likely break as they don't want to limit the features they can add on a 2020 Sonos to what a 2006 sonos can do. And to be fair, if I purchase a 2020 Sonos and it can't do 24 bit streaming because it must be backward compatible with a 14-year device, I'd be pissed and return it."
homeautomation,ffe7jsq,t1_ffe676j,1579838820.0,"Timing is bad and you have a point that they liquidated their old inventory before announcing the end-of-life. I purchased my devices a while back but if they sold “legacy” devices as current 3 months ago, it’s shady."
homeautomation,ffe7clx,t1_ffe4qi6,1579838658.0,I think their solution is to freeze the feature set for the older models. So they’ll continue to work but won’t get new features.
homeautomation,ffdwtbi,t3_et0oho,1579830884.0,"Nothing has changed it seems. They are saying that the older products won't get the new features and this will make them incompatible with the newer speakers that have stronger processing power. 

As a software engineer, I kinda have to agree with Sonos here. I'd hate to have to build features in 2020 for devices with an embedded computer from 2006. The inter-speaker protocol will change and old devices simply won't have the processing power to keep up. Ideally future speakers would come with a ""system card"" that can be swapped out but that's not an option now.

I don't think I have many internet-connected devices from 2006 that still work today. TVs can't do HDCP, old phones don't do SSL/Javascript, etc... It's a shame that the cheapest part of the Sonos ended up being the most crucial part though. Kinda like a solid gold Apple watch 1st edition :)"
science,ffdv10d,t3_eswz5j,1579829621.0,"I can mostly speak with regards to California regulations on firearms. Most of the new regulations passed in the last 10 years in this State have targeted responsible firearm owners while not being detrimental to unlawful use of weapons. Here are a few examples:

\- Require a tool to eject the magazine of a semi-automatic rifle. At first, it seems like a good idea since there's longer downtime between reloads. However, to make a rifle compliant, firearm owners have to purchase the part online, remove the standard part, and install the new compliant part. As you can imagine, criminals do not purchase the compliant part. That would be the equivalent of requiring all cars in California to not go over 65mph and enforce it by asking motorists to install a plastic block under the gas pedal. That law has been slightly amended to force a mechanical separation of the upper and lower part of the rifle. Like before, it involves buying a kit to add the restriction...

\- 10rd magazine limit. Similar to the example above, magazines have a plastic block added at the bottom of the magazine to make sure it can only fit 10 rounds instead of usually 16 for handguns and 30 for rifles. You can remove the block or purchase standard capacity magazines online...

\- 10 day waiting period. I think most firearm owners can agree with that law. The problem is that it applies to not only your first rifle/handgun but EVERY firearm you purchase. So if you already have a rifle and a handgun, you still need to wait 10 days to get your 3rd firearm. Someone who already owns firearms doesn't need a cool down period to purchase more; they are already in possession of a deadly weapon. Most gun owners perceive that law as a subtle way to prevent sales of firearms at events and stores far from your house, thus decreasing the competition and increasing prices

\- Classifying rifles with an adjustable stock and pistol grips as ""Assault weapons"". Making sure the rifle fits the shooter is a safety and comfort issue. That's like saying adjustable seats in a car make them race cars.

\- The handgun roster. Only handguns with micro stamping at 2 different places when fired can be added to the California handgun roster. Only handguns on the roster can be purchased. The problem is that the technology to micro stamp in 2 places doesn't exist (Micro stamping in one place exists if the firing pin has a S/N). The Attorney General considers the technology available because there are no patents preventing adoption. Again, the technology has not been invented. Imagine California requiring all new cars starting in 2021 need to run on water to combat pollution. A laudable law with one simple problem: It doesn't exist...

\- The penalty for not reporting the theft of a firearm within 5 days is $100 and can escalate to a misdemeanor. Meanwhile, prop 47 made the actual theft of a firearm a mere ""petty theft"". A bill to classify firearm theft as a felony was vetoed by the governor and it took the passing of Prop 63 to reclassify the theft of a firearm as a felony. So while penalties and rules for owners kept increasing, penalties for criminals stealing and using weapons kept decreasing.

\- The new proposed extra excise tax on firearms and ammo. California states that gun violence results in added cost to its emergency personnel and thus people purchasing a firearm should ""pre-pay"" for the damage their firearm is susceptible of doing. In fact, most illegal guns are either stolen or came from neighboring States (Jill Snyder, ATF). This is effectively making law abiding firearm owners pay for the crimes perpetrated by other people.

\- Impossibility to carry a concealed firearm in public. Local sheriffs have great latitude in issuing firearm permits in their jurisdiction. Once issued, they are valid State-wide. Sheriffs in populated areas deny all applications with the justification that the applicant doesn't have ""Just cause"" to possess one. The reasoning is that they live in an area that is served by the police therefor there's no need for self-defense. The Supreme court has ruled that the police only have a duty to protect people in custody (i.e in jail, in handcuffs, etc). It's also important to note that the law doesn't physically prevent anyone from carrying a firearm. It's as easy as walking through the front door..."

“Someone called from inside the house saying there someone with a gun threatening to shoot children”

“Someone claims to be in the house and says someone is in there threatening to shoot children “

CallerID is as secure as the return address on an envelope. Perhaps less secure since an envelope has markings from the originating office. 
If the police receives a letter with a handwritten return address saying they are hostage at address X, I expect the cops to at least consider the return address might not be 100% legit. They’ll investigate but won’t go in with 100% certitude that the letter was written from inside the house based on the return address. 
 
Hope that clarifies how bad relying on caller ID is."
bayarea,ffdomvx,t1_ffd93ms,1579825331.0,"Thanks for that unique perspective,I learned from it. 
I’d like to share mine as well to complement what you said. I’m a tech transplant who grew up in rural Canada but also lived in Tokyo and NYC. 

I work with plenty of people who were born and raised in the Bay Area and they take the tech shuttles or they drive. They might be desensitized to drugs, poop, stabbing and crime but if there’s an option to avoid it, they’ll take it. That’s also the feeling I got from old time New Yorkers. 

When I have a 1 hour commute, I’m looking for two things:
-	Make my time productive so I don’t have to be in the office physically for 8 hours or more if possible. Maybe I work or if I don’t work, I watch videos or just consume entertainment. 
-	Be at work on time. I aim to get to work around 9:00 and meetings usually start at 9:30. 

I used the tech shuttles when I lived in SF because of a few crimes I noticed on public transport. I didn’t dare have my laptop out and work. Public transport also added 50 mins to my 1:15 commute and included two transfers. It was also late about twice per week and I had to attend meetings from my mobile phone. 

I recently moved to the East Bay and I’m back on public transport. The ACE train is clean and they run a tight ship. I see people get in trouble for putting their bag on a seat lol. It’s safe, on-time and quicker than the tech shuttle. I work on it and I only have one transfer that is coordinated with the train. 

I don’t think the majority of tech workers avoid public transport because they “aren’t the pleb”. They need to get to work quickly, on time and try to make the most of a 1:15 commute. There are no tech shuttles in NY or Tokyo because public transport is adequate. I think most people would try to maximize comfort and minimize commute time/transfers."

That is, he's willing to not try her in a court of law for economic gains. All while 2 Canadians are on Chinese death row as a direct result of Meng's detention. So Canada gets 2 citizens killed, its economy hurt and Trump will trade her for a good commercial deal..."
bayarea,ffda6yu,t3_esxtys,1579816469.0,">The calls appeared to be coming from inside the homes.

Caller ID is meta-data and can be set by anyone. There are much better ways to trace a phone call. Many 911 stations are equipped with the following:

* Telco can send the full ""REPAIR"" address when a landline call targets 911. It's included as metadata as part of the call routing and cannot be spoofed easily like CallerID.
* Likewise, E911 laws forces telcos to use at least tower triangulation to send an approximate location to the 911 center.

What is happening here is a ""fail-safe"" where if only the caller ID is sent, the assumption that ""some info"" is better than ""no info"". So the 911 system queries a database like 411 that has a mapping of phone numbers to addresses. If you use VoIP, it's likely that when you call 911, only your caller ID is sent and that database is used for lookups.

I know that most modern 911 systems let the operator know how the location was acquired. Before sending a SWAT team, it would be smart to add the caveat on their briefing that the location is solely based on called ID (or solid because it's the repair metadata from local incumbent carrier).

SWATting has been a problem for a while with confirmed deaths. It's been demonstrated for over a decade that anyone with a $1 on a prepaid credit card can spoof calls. You'd think that the police, whose job it is to be incredulous, would be a bit less trusting of this."

Dev domains are available to anyone and have enforced https at the TLD level (via HSTS preload). 

I’m not sure how this is different from the other 100s of TLDs that we’re registered by private companies and equity firms. I pay $11/year for my .dev domain and since it’s a new TLD, it has a short memorable name.

technology,ffccd3k,t3_esrdnx,1579796400.0,"Comcast and ISPs are also lobbying hard. They killed Net Neutrality, maintain a monopoly built with government grant but without the government setting max prices like all other utilities, and use that monopoly to hurt competition (AT&T, streaming service doesn’t count against your data but Netflix does...)

So if your whole company is based on serving content over the internet, and that can only be done over a monopoly that is deregulated, you’re going to be nervous. Facebook doesn’t want ISPs to mess with their connection to the user. Facebook doesn’t want to be held directly responsible for every comment their user write. Google was upset when AT&T denied Google fiber access to their utility poles under the bullshit excuse that “Google fiber isn’t a utility. Oh but our AT&T internet/tv totally is”. 

Not all their lobbying is great but I’m glad someone if fighting the bullshit lobbying done by ISPs. Sure Google wants me to have a faster Internet so I can watch more video on their platform and make them money. But if that gets me fiber at home, I’m all for it. In 2015, ISPs fought to keep the definition of Broadband at 4 mbit/s. Tech company fought back and it’s now 25mbps. 

TLDR: Tech giants’ lobbying counter-balances the lobbying made by ISPs. Tech giants look after themselves first, but their goals on internet access usually benefit the customer at the same time."
CAguns,ffcb8q1,t1_ffbl8pt,1579795697.0,"Thanks for your reply. It is somewhat different in two regards:
-	That’s a tax on all hunting gears, including archery. It goes into a dedicated fund to help wildlife and has had direct impact on it. Check the Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. The California proposed tax would indemnify the State because they are saying guns cost money in terms of policing and health care. 
-	Federal laws prohibit holding a firearm dealer responsible for acts committed with a firearm they sold. Common sense also doesn’t hold car dealers, knife dealers and baseball bat dealers responsible. That bill tries to go against this and holds dealers responsible for the gun violence we have on our streets. The tax would be imposed on dealers and then passed on to the buyer. Because that law violates Federal laws, there’s a good chance it could reach SCOTUS and be reverted. I’d expect an injunction before it goes into effect at the very least. 

It wouldn’t be the first time a State says “fuck that” and pass a law that is illegal. See Alabama’s ban on abortion. They are saying “we know it’s illegal but what are you going to do? Take us to SCOTUS which is now conservative and will take years”."

It seems like OP was able to get it working again by emailing customer support. I’m sure we can agree that resetting the device “a couple times a day” is unusual. 

Many software will provide a limited number of activations and require you to contact support to activate more. Same assumption that customers don’t format/upgrade their machines several times per year.

Where is gets difficult is imposing an excise tax on firearms and ammo. The 2nd amendment would prevent an outright excise tax like we have on gasoline and tobacco. DROS is considered an administrative fee that covers the program so it’s borderline but legal. It’s borderline since gun owners also pay taxes and many programs are tax funded so it’s questionable why the DROS program is not funded. 
Sales tax have also been OK’d with regards to the 2nd amendment due to their blanket application. 

I doubt this will get signed, even when Newsom is the governor. If and when gets reversed in court, the damages are easy to calculate... Whatever fees were paid + interest.

legaladvice,fds5dda,t3_ems1ne,1578694725.0,"Here's some practical advice. As others have pointed out, Japan has finally reluctantly signed the Hague convention but getting it applied is difficult. I cannot speak on how Australia can protect you and your family but here's how things might play from the Japanese side:

* Your son has Japanese nationality and the local Japanese embassy can and will issue your son a Japanese passport. No matter what arrangements are in place in Australia, the embassy will issue a passport. 
* I'm assuming you've been in Japan several times. You've probably noticed that politics and customs move very slowly over there. Getting an audience that invokes the Hague convention will take around six weeks. If it's contested, then you're looking a months.
* Even if you get an audience, it's very common from fleeing spouses to claim domestic violence despite the lack of evidence. The Japanese court will be very reluctant to return a Japanese national (your son) to Australia after these allegations.
* As soon as you have an injunction, register you son and his various names (Including your wife's maiden name, katakana spelling \[Austin can become o-suthin\]) on the Family Law Watchlist. [https://www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/crime-types/family-law-kit#25](https://www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/crime-types/family-law-kit#25) This will alert authorities if a passenger manifest for an outbound voyage contains his name
* I want to stress out that if your son ends up in Japan, they'll stay there.
   * Read on Chris Savoie
   * Read this article about how Japan presents its Hague convention proceedings in English vs what is publishes in Japanese: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/10/08/issues/biased-pamphlet-bodes-ill-left-behind-foreign-parents-outside-japan/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/10/08/issues/biased-pamphlet-bodes-ill-left-behind-foreign-parents-outside-japan/)
* Everything will be done in Japanese, all documents will have to be translated, attorneys must be Japanese, and the process will follow Japanese law. Understand that the culture in Japan is very different from Australia. Namely, for family court:
   * Shared custody doesn't exist. 
   * The mother gets the child by default. Only when the mother is proven to be unfit, will the court give custody to the father. That court case was decided less than 2 months ago so it's very current.
      * [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/22/national/crime-legal/japanese-parents-file-liability-lawsuit-state-joint-custody-rights/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/22/national/crime-legal/japanese-parents-file-liability-lawsuit-state-joint-custody-rights/)
   * The court will not order visitation. The custodial parent decides of the visitation schedule. Despite the court recommending visitations, it cannot enforce them
   * In family and criminal law, the court/attorney relationship is different from what you're accustomed to in the West. If your wife is lying in court, don't expect your attorney to find a strategy and trick your wife into perjuring herself. The mother will be viewed as the victim and your attorney won't try to upset the court by strongly rejecting the claim. 
   * The foreign man == violent mindset is very present in Japan. You can read up on the ""island mentality"" if you're interested in understanding how they justify this behavior. 

Find an attorney with direct experience in the matter and best of luck to you. Australia will assume the best intentions from the mother because everyone is guaranteed due process. Japan will work differently...
