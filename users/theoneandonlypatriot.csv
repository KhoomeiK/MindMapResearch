There were great moments: hooded justice background being fleshed out, for instance.

Biggest offenders:

-Adrian Veidt: was portrayed as an eccentric weird guy who literally rips ass in one scene. So unbelievably out of character for who Adrian veidt is supposed to be. Jarring really.

-Manhattan: my god, do I even need to say anything about what was wrong with his character? I don‚Äôt, but I‚Äôll give you the easiest example to point at. Spends 30 years (time means nothing to him / it) on a different planet; doesn‚Äôt care about humanity. All of a sudden: oh I‚Äôm gonna go to Vietnam because I want to date a girl that I‚Äôm already in love with; proceeds to play up the ‚Äútime is a loop and I‚Äôm everywhere but nowhere card‚Äù.

MLQuestions,fe12824,t3_enkuam,1578821700.0,"Hi friend; it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to set up some simple reinforcement learning.

Otherwise, if they‚Äôre all starting at different heights and you‚Äôre only outputting one flap signal, it will never work at all.

It‚Äôs a fucking dumpster fire that is incapable of installing basic software because of Microsoft‚Äôs stupid, stupid decision to push an ARM64 SOC solution, which they then outfitted with a 32-bit x86 emulator and called it a day. 

That software you use for your job? Probably can‚Äôt install it. 

The software you wanted to use to draw on your tablet (photoshop)? Can‚Äôt install it.

Anything 64 bit (most major applications)? Can‚Äôt install it. 

Most games (even simple hearthstone or age of empires)? Can‚Äôt install it.

microsoft,fcjps56,t3_dexhl7,1577698493.0,"The surface pro X is a disaster for anyone who wants to install apps besides Netflix and web browsers. I fully expect this dumpster fire to explode in the news as more people report being utterly hamstrung by the ARM processor. Microsoft severely overestimated compatibility (saying most apps offer 32-bit variants is ludicrous), or worse, pushed out a product for the holidays knowing damned well that they would make a lot of money on people that would be disappointed. I mean, who is the target audience for the pro x? Someone that uses a web browser and does excel spreadsheets while watching Hulu? I wanted a drawing tablet. Literally none of the well known drawing options work on this tablet (which I got the slim pen for). Photoshop, open toonz, autodesk sketchbook, toon boom harmony, etc. The best we have is a ‚Äúpromise‚Äù from adobe to push releases for the pro X, and vague ramblings of Microsoft trying to release an emulator for 64-bit x86 on ARM64. We have no timelines for either of these developments, practically leaving the tablet as a gorgeous, useless paperweight. 

Now I‚Äôm forced to ask the person that gifted it to me for a receipt because the 1k+ flagship tablet I was given is completely incapable of installing common use case software. The whole situation is absurd. 

Here‚Äôs my question: if I‚Äôm unable to return this to the store it was gotten at, what am I even supposed to do? Just be out of luck and let it waste a way?"
