JRPG,fffjz5o,t1_fferp0x,1579885597.0,The music and characters in XV have always been spectacular and the story and pacing were fixed through the DLCs.
JRPG,fffil0j,t1_ffew26q,1579884740.0,"I’d agree. If you are playing as a character, by definition that’s an RPG. Although, if that RPG qualifier is significantly overshadowed by a different qualifier, I’ll drop calling it an RPG. I’m not going to run around telling everyone that Mario is an RPG despite the fact that, in much larger parts, it’s just a platformer."

JustBootThings,fff5etq,t1_ffenqyl,1579876151.0,They didn’t even have the courtesy to point out something irrelevant in the other guy’s history. They merely stated the fact that they looked through the history.

subredditcancer,ff91077,t1_ff8zz5p,1579702117.0,My point is different. I’m saying that it would be difficult for them to kill themselves before the Nazis got to them and thus their death would be more if wouldn’t be marked as suicide. I’m saying that the real number should be much higher.

subredditcancer,ff80ysi,t1_ff7tloi,1579663142.0,"But I doubt those deaths would be marked, statistically, as suicide. If you work too hard on an empty stomach, that would be marked as death by exhaustion. If they saw you being exhausted and threw you in the gas chambers, that wouldn’t be marked as suicide either. I’m not doubting that many didn’t try to kill themselves, I’m just saying that it should be fairly difficult for that to show up as a statistic. That would mean the real number should be significantly jacked up."
subredditcancer,ff7tfkd,t1_ff7p5ol,1579657932.0,But then wouldn’t they still get worked and if they didn’t they would just get gassed? So then starving would just lead to a different Nazi-based death and not suicide?

OnePunchMan,ff4s2tv,t3_ergo3l,1579571090.0,"While I like to see this all laid out, Genos seems like a poor choice for this sort of thing. Isn’t his whole schtick that he is constantly revamping his body and thus he would get this sort of treatment anyways?"
crushcrush,ff4qve7,t1_ff3mtr3,1579570262.0,Ayano is my favourite based purely on how she shittalks the other characters.
RWBY,feuly48,t1_fetdnnv,1579387796.0,"No. I meant why would he take out the bots. They have their blue visors, meaning they weren't hacked. It looks like Neo took out all the androids."
RWBY,fetco7v,t1_fetbta1,1579373976.0,But why would he?
RWBY,fetcj1u,t1_fesfizd,1579373923.0,"I think it's definitely good, but it doesn't edge out last week's episode."
RWBY,fetbxwo,t1_fetaxon,1579373714.0,"To the point of Salem, Watts wouldn't have taken offline(or destroyed) all of their coastal sensors unless something larger was coming. It's a lot of work for a small bluff."
RWBY,fetaioe,t3_eqi2w0,1579373345.0,"The first fight was too slow and the second fight was too fast. I really hope they can pull out all the stops for any fight Neo is in.The only noteworthy thing in the fights was, how has Qrow not figured Tyrian out yet? Again we see that he can really only focus on the weapons, when Qrow shot his scythe out of his hand and then Tyrian followed its movement before getting punched. Qrow should be smarter than this.


Winter not being at the Maiden's side already was surprising. I would've thought that there was no chance Ironwood would just leave her out in the open like that. Between Winter and Cinder I still want Neo to be the one who gets the Maiden's power, but that looks like it won't happen because Neo had to have gotten Oscar and there is no way she could beat Winter and Cinder to Fria.


Ironwood is right in trying to save as many as he can, but arresting RWBY (and maybe JNR?) is just asinine. Instead, he should throw them to Mantle. It would serve not only as a fitting punishment, keeping them out of his hair, it would also allow him some sort of public image, by leaving some reserve Hunters, after this all goes south. I feel like he is just doing this so that we can get an AceOps versus RWBY fight. Speaking of, Tyrian could do a lot right now, by riling up Qrow and Robyn against Clover and then fleeing, so I look forward to what happens with him."

YourJokeButWorse,fen6i46,t3_epzyc8,1579278045.0,It’s not like the first three comments were any good anyways. “Not my proudest fap” is the most derivative shit on this website. You see it in every thread and the people who say that are just as guilty for fishing for karma as the others.

movies,fen4t80,t1_felz8a1,1579276978.0,"Yeah, and I feel like this is why Santabarbaratown are two of my favourite episodes. They have Shawn being smart, surrounded by episodes where he’s just goofing off. It just looks better in comparison."
TheMonkeysPaw,fen2xf3,t1_femgim5,1579275790.0,"Yeah, but what does it matter? You could’ve been cloned and replaced yesterday and you wouldn’t know. You don’t doubt that you’re you. Even further, the whole world could’ve been created last Thursday and you wouldn’t have any meaningful way to disprove that. Everything, down to our memories is information stored inside of us and we can’t prove we even lived through all of it. Yet, we don’t go around doubting it, that would just be asinine and a waste of energy. The teleporting clones wouldn’t even blink about the chance they are a clone, because for all intents and purposes, they are the exact same person."
danganronpa,felaazd,t1_fel9h3n,1579217511.0,">!Eh. I like him and I think his move was completely justified. He saw the killing game as just that, a game. He was just sizing up the competition and seeing if the other players could keep up.!<"

smashbros,fekb3uc,t1_fek87a0,1579196350.0,Precisely. Aguilar puts way too much emotion into his Byleth. Niosi was an infinitely better fit.
fireemblem,fekb0tf,t3_epjqvg,1579196301.0,I’m just sad he wasn’t made Pokémon Trainer style with the House leaders. This doesn’t have the same amount of work put in as other DLC fighters.
fireemblem,fekapi6,t1_fejss0a,1579196115.0,They could’ve made Byleth a Pokémon Trainer style character. He would’ve been able to switch out with the three lords so people could play as the one they like. This was the most disappointing option.
fireemblem,fekagi7,t1_fejt2yx,1579195970.0,Why the /s? That was how I expected him to be added. It would’ve given us one of each type of weapon and more variance in characters rather than just the main character.
fireemblem,feka4q7,t1_fejt2et,1579195777.0,"With the amount of work put into previous fighter’s on the pass I had expected, bare minimum, a Pokémon Trainer style Byleth had he ever made into Smash. This is disappointing."

JRPG,fecjatp,t3_eocqfl,1578975283.0,"One character gets a few seconds worth of cameo and a few times events from the first game get a passing mention. That’s the extent of the two’s connection.

Dogfree,fea9657,t1_fea7dx4,1578945843.0,"I fully understand. I have been around this sub awhile and I wouldn’t have brought up my dog, except for the fact this post necessitated it. I needed to specify that the opinion I was giving was coming from someone who has a dog voluntarily, because some people were commenting about how they are dog owners, but they still hate their dog. 

I also completely get the point of the subreddit. I’m not saying anything against the point of this sub being for hating dogs. Yet, that isn’t mutually exclusive to the fact that more posts here are about the culture than are about the animal. And I’ll be participating in those posts.

Lastly, that mod post and comment were made after my own comment. Trying to bring it up after the fact is asinine."
JRPG,fea1aov,t3_eo5tx9,1578943290.0,They’re both.

Dogfree,fe7ini3,t1_fe6jx6q,1578915058.0,"Sure, but there wouldn’t be any real conversation because it’d just be me and maybe one or two other people per post. There are more posts I agree with in this sub posted within the last day than there are posts in that subreddit."
Dogfree,fe7b7p1,t1_fe6jzpa,1578912390.0,"I fully realise that it’s not just the culture. As I said, I also like to see the posts I disagree with to see opinions that oppose my own. Even then, despite what you say likely being true and most people here vehemently despising dogs themselves, I still have always agreed with more posts here then I’ve disagreed with. Because most posts focus on the culture even if everyone else hates dogs for breathing our air. 

Everyone else hating dogs and most posts being about the culture aren’t mutually exclusive things."
Dogfree,fe77xdl,t1_fe6fc12,1578911125.0,"I realise that this is dogfree and when I see a post I disagree with, I look at it anyways because I want to see the other side. I want to see opinions that differ from my own. Only when the posts I agree with become the minority, will I leave. 

It’s not like I’m posting anyways. I don’t really like to leave ranting posts, but I love to read and react to them. I’m not going to a sub where I can’t do that because I’d be the only one truly there."

Dogfree,fe660rw,t1_fe5vw37,1578882577.0,"I’m not saying it’s not the dog’s fault. When a dog attacks, I fully understand that the majority blame lies on the dog.
