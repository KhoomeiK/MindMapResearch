worldnews,ff4uokh,t1_ff4tyfs,1579572872.0,"I agree with every thing you say except

>wasted on military R&D every year

the US military has produced the velcro, gps, internet, and millions of other smaller inventions that make our life better. There are better ways to pay than to cut military spending (should it be used more efficiently and in better places? hell yes). Also, there is a high chance you live in a country that can afford your healthcare system BECAUSE the united states takes care of your military needs. Can america afford both? of course, we are a mecca of business and wealth, which needs to be used for social programs rather than bezos's empire."
