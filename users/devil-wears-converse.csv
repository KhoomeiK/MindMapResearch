bulletjournal,fcuiufa,t1_fcude9k,1577981985.0,"Do you mean adding an index on whatever page is blank next? You could do that, and add a marker/flag at the top so you can get to it quickly. Or do you mean adding the actual page eg. mood tracker or some list? In that case, most people add it to the next blank page and note the page number in the index, or add a marker that indicates what it is. Either way you're comfortable with. Imo adding it to the back would be confusing. Like would you have to set aside a bunch of pages for collections you might want to use later? Or work backwards? The first option of just adding it to the next page seems easier to me, but maybe trial and error?"

She gave me advice that [Blackletter](https://loopsandtails.com/blackletter/) is actually very easy if you got the right pen. I got a flat pen [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00135JVII/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is actually a lil more than I spent, you  can probably find a cheaper one at michaels for less with a coupon. However, it might bleed or ghost depending on your paper. You can also fake it, and sketch it out then fill it in. I did that a few times when I wasnt so certain on using the pen. They both look pretty swell."
bulletjournal,fcuhx90,t1_fcty0bz,1577981367.0,"To be honest, I would start with a cheap notebook, that way you can experiment on what you like and how you want it set up. That way, if you're not happy and want to start over, you wont feel like you wasted money. I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MX7LP8B/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) but I started a different notebook so I can't comment too much. I did notice a lil bit of ghosting but no bleeding. It's cheap though if you want to try it out. You can also check clearance at stores like target and walmart. 
However, if you don't mind the extra buck, I heard Archer & Olive is really good. Scribbles that matter is supposed to be good; I commented a few times but apparently the new paper is thicker, but also rubs off easier now? So if you choose that, just be aware to let your ink dry a lil but."

personalfinance,fc4pl36,t3_efzkfy,1577423883.0,"You have a crazy good start. Honestly, try to be as cheap as possible so you dont have to spend your savings. Like, get second hand/good will instead of buying new stuff. Adding more to that savings is going to make your life easier in the long run.

I'm not sure if it's been suggested, but I would take a few hundred and get a secured credit card so you can build your credit. It till take a bit, but its a good way to get that score up when you're starting out. Just be careful to not spend a lot; only use a portion and it needs to be paid off fully every month.

Edit: After reading the comments, are you having issues with your parents? Is your savings in a complete separate account for them where they cannot get anything? I really don't know the situation with them so this is a complete assumption, but if theyre the kind of people that would take it to get back at you, move it to a new account asap."
