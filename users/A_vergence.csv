destinylegacy,fefd48y,t3_eou584,1579053737.0,"I would say definitely yes. I started on the PS3, then migrated to PS4, then moved on to Destiny 2.

Now I‚Äôve actually gone back to playing Destiny 1 on the PS3. The Taken King expansion was probably my favorite period of the game‚Äôs life, and the PS3 version never went past that.

The crucible, strikes, and Prison if Elders are still great fun. Matchmaking is also still working and it rarely has any trouble finding other players.

One thing to mention is that you do have to pay the full $30 for the digital version. The ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù edition that was sold in stores with the first three expansions only comes with the base game disc and codes for those expansions. Unfortunately, those codes all expired three years ago (which sucks).

Edit:
Also you *don‚Äôt* need a PlayStation Plus subscription for the PS3 version. Just a regular PlayStation account and an internet connection.

I sent you a PM with something to get you started."

originalxbox,feba7k1,t3_eobafy,1578956831.0,Hello there
c64,fdkmgnh,t1_fdklxtz,1578506606.0,Yep! I ran a diagnostic cartridge and 64 Doctor. Everything looks and sounds great. üòÑ
c64,fdkczib,t1_fdk1461,1578501262.0,LOL. Likely if I had been there *15 minutes* later it would have been gone. üòã
c64,fdk018l,t1_fdjxqu5,1578492638.0,"I get it. It‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. To be fair though, I go thrifting A LOT, and one of my primary focuses is vintage computers. Finding and repairing them is my main hobby.

If it makes you feel any better, once I restore/refurbish it I‚Äôll probably be giving it to one of my friends who *doesn‚Äôt* have a C64. At the very least, it won‚Äôt end up on eBay."
c64,fdj5fb0,t3_elntdo,1578458945.0,"While checking the electronics section of my local thrift store, I spotted a C64 with a $10 price tag. It had an ‚ÄúUntested‚Äù sticker, but I figured it was still a great deal even if it needed repairs.

Much to my amazement, after plugging in my custom power supply, it powered on and loaded BASIC. I ran diagnostics and some games and everything looks good.

Now it just needs to be cleaned, retr0brighted, and re-capped. This isn‚Äôt my first C64 but is definitely the cheapest one I‚Äôve gotten my hands on."
crtgaming,fdj3mrd,t1_fdj2sp6,1578457562.0,Wow... Who in their right mind would pay that much?
consolerepair,fd9xgna,t1_fd8kdxf,1578239147.0,"Thanks again for all your help!

The Z80 also looks good.

I‚Äôve got the full schematics handy now, so I‚Äôm going to do more thorough continuity testing of the cartridge slot. I‚Äôm thinking that I could take a cartridge PCB out of it‚Äôs shell, insert it, then perform continuity test from the cart board to the components on the Genesis board.

Don‚Äôt do too much digging for that tech manual. I‚Äôve still got a perfectly functional model 1, so I may set this console aside to focus on other projects."
consolerepair,fd7aeef,t1_fd6p0hd,1578201543.0,"Thanks!

CPU voltage and clock frequency look good. Oscillator measures correct too.

This is driving me crazy..."
consolerepair,fd5kn4y,t1_fd42ihf,1578178566.0,"I just installed a new 7805. Now it‚Äôs reading 5.02V, which is much better. However, I‚Äôm still not getting past the license screen. Ugh..."
consolerepair,fd39a7b,t1_fd32846,1578155956.0,"Yeah, checked that too... this *is* a bit crazy.

The only other thing I‚Äôve noticed that‚Äôs worth investigating is that the ICs are only getting about 4.92V. That should be fine, they can usually handle about 4.8 - 5.2V without issues. However, it won‚Äôt hurt to replace the voltage regulator and see if I get something closer to 5V."
consolerepair,fd2yps2,t1_fd2vz34,1578153042.0,"Thanks. I reflowed the pins for the port with no change in results. I even went to the trouble of soldering an RCA cable directly to the composite pin + ground, just to make 100% sure  that it wasn‚Äôt anything related to the port or my AV cable."
consolerepair,fd2xycl,t1_fd2lr20,1578152812.0,"Already checked. Voltages look good. I reflowed the solder joints just-in-case. Didn‚Äôt make a difference. :(

Out of curiosity, does anyone know how to remove the metal clip holding the regulator against the heatsink? I don‚Äôt want to risk damaging it if I decide to replace the 7805 anyways."
consolerepair,fd2xa4m,t1_fd2w3mz,1578152580.0,"Yeah, I tried several. They all work fine in my model 1 Genesis, too."

originalxbox,fbvqz6b,t1_fbviwbo,1577134804.0,"The cheaper ones work too, but only if you‚Äôre willing to reflow the crappy solder joints and clean off the ridiculous amount of flux on them."
