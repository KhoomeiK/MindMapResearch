todayilearned,fd2ab58,t1_fd275kz,1578144192.0,"I don’t mind at all! Personally, I have a hearing older sister who I was very close with so she probably taught me a lot. 

BUT there are many codas who don’t have that and still learn to speak just fine - people really underestimate the impact of incidental language input. That is, input from the world around us - people talking at the park, radio and people at the store, etc etc. Although child-directed speech is important for language acquisition (and parent-child bonding, iirc, but don’t quote me on that), it’s not the end-all-be-all for language acquisition like people often think it is."
todayilearned,fczwg1i,t1_fczph5e,1578109784.0,"They mean that babbling is intentional and meaningful (to the child), rather than just random sounds that do nothing. It’s to indicate that children are trying to communicate, not just making sounds because they can (I.e. age of acquisition onset is much earlier than people think, just because the sounds aren’t intelligible)."
todayilearned,fczvx9y,t1_fczb95r,1578109524.0,"Depends on what kind of context you’re meaning, but if you’re including public spaces, then you greatly underestimate the amount of language input we get from ambient noise in our environments. People talking at the park, radio at the store, etc all contribute to our language development. Children often babble just to test out their body (though as a means of communication too, to be sure)."

BSL and ASL are A) independent languages in their own right, definitively NOT based on English (in fact, ASL has its strongest roots in French Sign Language), and B) not even related to one another. Perhaps try not speaking so authoritatively on something you clearly don't actually have any background knowledge of."
space,fbyglkd,t1_fby5sg0,1577216376.0,"My parents are Deaf, I work as an ASL-English interpreter (in post-grad level environments including microbiology, for that matter), and do sign language linguistics research - for the last ten years. My entire life has revolved around the Deaf community and sign language research. 

There is TONS of research on  deaf reading outcomes (Marschark and Harris, 1996; Mayberry, 1989; Kyle and Cain, 2015 etc etc). 

“Not completely fluent” does not mean have no knowledge of it at all whatsoever, but I can tell you from firsthand account that for many, many Deaf people, there are significant gaps in their English language skills. To that end, “often” does not mean always. Research has also shown that Deaf children of Deaf parents have higher reading outcomes than deaf children of hearing parents because they have full language input from a young age. The statistic varies, but it’s most often reported that 90-95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents - many of whom never learn ASL to communicate with their kids - which means they’re not exposed to language during early acquisition stages.

And no, I’m by no means going to arbitrate what words can be added to a sign language based on my language, but ASL was factually my first language, I work and communicate with it every day, and I’m telling you from what I’ve seen firsthand where the gaps in ASL convention are. Atomic Hands is an example of where Deaf people are working on filling those gaps themselves and getting that information out, but that initiative was also only started in the last year or so.

I didn’t even mention hardly any of the things you attacked me on in my reply to you, so much as pointing out the flaws in your perception of Deaf people’s general reading knowledge. So please, tell me more about how “rich” it is that I’m basing all of this in my experience."
space,fbxqcwe,t1_fbxooxb,1577197542.0,">It's especially silly since ASL and BSL users all speak English, as in they understand and read it perfectly fine. So they'll read the word all the time, but have to do what?

Deaf people often aren’t completely fluent in the majority written language (English, in this case) - it’s not as easily accessible for them as it is for you and me by way of hearing it around us all the time. A sign language is the natural language for Deaf people, and written language may or may not be effective for communication."
space,fbxp739,t1_fbxlwst,1577196527.0,"Scientific vocabulary is a huge gap, and while it’s less of a problem at Gallaudet, only a bit so. There’s actually a collaboration right now of Deaf scientific researchers called Atomic Hands aimed at spreading knowledge of scientific signs that have come up."

A sign language is the natural language for Deaf people, and written notes may not do all that much good. Also, lecturers don’t often have extensive notes ahead of time - there’s a reason some classes specifically have note takers.

Two signers is due to concentration fatigue. It has been said that “interpreting is the most cognitively complex task human beings are capable of,” and studies have shown degradation of quality after 20-ish minutes of straight interpreting."
space,fbxlzig,t1_fbxlc67,1577193378.0,"It’s likely the student requested CART (real-time captions), I assume because it was more accessible for them that way. As for lost time, sure, a bit, but really not that much. Often when working in classes where there aren’t really conventionalized signs for particular concepts, the client and interpreter(s) will create them for things that come up often.
