Thetruthishere,fdspku1,t3_emyat6,1578706293.0,"Hhhhmm... I've seen demons several times and every time they look like an inky black angry Batman without ears. Their eyes are, at least for me, so dark you cannot see them. The thing I notice first is the hate. You can feel the pure black hate comingn off them in torrents. It makes you scared. The kind of scared that makes you tense up and can't move for like 10 seconds. This one was not all inky black (blond hair, and besides all the demons I've seen were bald) and did not give you temporary paralysis or even make you that scared. I don't think this was a demon but yeah. Death it probably is."

Thetruthishere,fczc2j4,t3_ejisvk,1578097906.0,"Ok. Either it's a demon a spirit of some kind of something else entirely. I don't think it's a demon, you have not had that sence of dread where all your muscles tense and you can't move. It may be a gost. If it is, tell it to go away. I've heard stories of the fact that goasts must obey humans.



Or it is most likely that GODDAMN CAT is like possest or something. Good luck."

Thetruthishere,fcoxxou,t3_eibjnd,1577844644.0,"Ok. As a general rule angels don't show themselves to humans because if they did demons could copy and trick you.
Exceptions are made tho. I have a friend who definitely saw an angel. The only sure way to tell is if it praises God. This did not happen in your encounter but it is completely possible that this was an angel. Congrats btw."

The bruises are what gets me. I have a ghost in my room but the only advise people give me is the three scratches given by demons. I've never got three cuts on my body in the same night (aside from what I did myself) but that might be this.
Demons might be mocking the Trinity on your body.

AskReddit,fc5mqle,t3_ega9qc,1577461658.0,For y'all high schoolers (and college goers?) don't go to a subscription place or any fitness center. If your school offers weightlifting take it. In my experience all the fitness center people are always trying to sell you a gimmick or are just not interested. A weightlifting teacher on the other hand can be fired for neglegece. Weightlifting teachers are teachers for a reason they live students. They are also have required college and higher education and will know more than anyone at a fitness center. When a student makes the decision to be active a teacher will respect it and (if he is a good teacher) make you workout routines for maximum strength gain. Also if you take a class at your school it fits perfectly into your schedule.
