depression,fdl7n07,t3_elywxn,1578518429.0,"I sometimes go to a local store to get the usually “hello” from the cashier. Not gonna lie, it always makes my day even better.

Also I was a rebel as a child but when I realized that all my relatives hated me I dove into a deep dark self conscious hole. I spend almost 6 years of my left over childhood trying to impress this judgmental fucks. 

I just hope that no one goes through the journey I been trying to impress people and waste for child hood away. Enjoy your youth while you can because you only live once and time moves only forwards."

Until I tried playing the keyboard and instantly enjoyed it. If you don’t seem to enjoy it on the first try I suggest you keep looking for that perfect hobby that can make you happy."

My advise if find a way to block it off. Find a happy place or a hobby to take your mind off this shitty situation you where born it. It’s not your fault so don’t blame your self.

For me, I play the piano and game whenever I feel down."

depression,fc6gi12,t3_eggjys,1577480025.0,"Not tryna sound rude but the reality of this subreddit is people wanting attention when they are feeling down.

Don’t get me wrong some of the people benefit from this sub but people here often don’t even attempt to get better and just keep writing post after post.

Unless you really want to get better then you gotta put the work and don’t ask me where you should start because no one really knows how to cure it expect yourself. You need to find that answer your self fellow brother.

Good luck"

Good luck kiddo"

socialanxiety,fc28goa,t1_fc27xi3,1577345419.0,"That’s actually some good insight of what I’m really doing. Never realized it looked this way.

Your right man, I’m too focused  on finding things wrong with people so I can relate with them. Now that I think about it, it does make me feel better knowing that someone is on my level but in reality I’m in the low on my own.

For now on I will stop focusing on people’s mistakes and focus on my own problems.

PS: in my opinion, people who offer direct advice without worrying about offending me, are the ones I listen to most. Thanks 🙏🏽"
