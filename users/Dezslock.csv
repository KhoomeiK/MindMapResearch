Also R has 2 mins cool down. She gets out scaled in the late game. She could easily be played around her W as it is the last ability to be maxed, meaning it will be every 20 secs.

Example, recently had 2 games against a pretty fed Akali, who was able to kill everyone in a 1v1. Both games she lost. If she gets fed mid game and you know you could beat her late, then stale."

Imagine it happening to someone close to you, knowing the criminal will get out, not get 'punished' and be all free again, won't you feel like he was simply forgiven?

I am willing to forgive Theon as a viewer, yes. However, what about the mother of the kid he killed, burned and hanged, representing him as Bran? She would never ever forgive or accept his freedom. 

Human nature vs rational thinking. I actually don't know what the best solution would be.

Rehabilitation gives better chances of change but the lack of punishment will leave a feeling of injustice for the victims, therefore, potentially leading to riots or self-violence."

AskReddit,fegn63a,t1_feebwxd,1579097769.0,"Really? In Bulgaria we are taught to be proud of our history and the fact that we are Bulgarians. During the times we've been a part of the Ottoman empire (1396-1878) many people had forgotten their roots so a man named Paisii Hilendarski had written a book with the purpose of reminding them that our country had had a great past and golden times and showing them why. He starts with the words 'Oh, unwise people, why are you ashamed to call yourselves Bulgarians?'. He than continues with examples, 'reminding' (teaching) them that Bulgaria is an old country (681-), had become an empire, has made the Byzantines kneel before it, that Bulgarians have stopped the Ottomans from going in Central Europe and continuing their invasion decades before they'd conquered the Byzantine empire, that we'd given the world the alphabet many Slavic countries use today, etc.

The point is, we are said to be proud of who we are and wave our flags, not get criticised for it."
