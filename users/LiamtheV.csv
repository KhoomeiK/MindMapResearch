No one wants to spend x hours grinding through a dungeon, only for you to be caught with a ghost you can't kill because you're a level 4 character without an enchanted, silver, or daedric weapon, and then have to reload a save from 4 or 5 hours earlier.

In-world justification, the Oblivion Crisis and subsequent Umbra Crisis likely brought enough creatia from Oblivion to Nirn that anything forged after say 4e50 had small amounts of daedric impurities in the metal, this imbuing everything with ability to strike ghosts and such. Similar to how all steel forged after 1945 contains radioactive traces from nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons test, due to the amount of fallout the US and Soviet Union pumped into the atmosphere. 

Fun fact, the same goes for pigments and dyes, that's one way to detect forged artwork. The real pieces painted pre-40s lack the radioactive trace elements artwork made post-45 would have."

In the early stages/years there are no visible symptoms whatsoever from HIV whatsoever, in fact, technically, HIV doesn't cause any visible symptoms in and of itself, but over time the virus hijacks enough T-cells to cripple the immune system, leaving the victim defenseless against the literally thousands of random pathogens everyone is exposed to daily. Without the ability to trigger an immune response, the body is vulnerable to everything, including things that *nobody* gets sick from, it's these 'Opportunistic' pathogens that eventually kill you. You get pneomonia from some microbe that's never been seen before, some virus that hasn't been issue for humanity for 5000+years gets its chance at a comeback, no specific treatment or vaccine can hit ALL those things. 

However protease inhibitors can prevent HIV from successfully replicating even if a person is infected, eventually lowering viral load and allowing the immune system to function properly once again. The person is still infected, but the virus is effectively stymied as long as they receive treatment."

Our research budget is such that a one off cost for a few windows licenses is negligible, and most of us already have Windows, either on University or personal machines, so the cost for Windows is a moot point.

We even considered windows at the beginning when outlining the project, and we won't stop my fellow research assistants from trying to get their work done on it.

That being said, package management on Linux distributions (in our case a Centos/RHEL host with a mix of Debian and arch-based clients, I use Manjaro, a few others use Ubuntu) makes life a thooooousand times easier. One of my classmates has a massive hard-on for Windows and has been evangelizing Ubuntu's Windows/Linux subsystem, but since absolutely nothing in what we're doing makes use of anything from Windows itself, why even have that extra layer? He gets things done on it, but it's a bastardized workflow cobbled together using beta software, and some proprietarized windows version of software utilities that are baked into our Linux distribution's repos. It takes me three commands and 5 minutes of downloading plus a restart to get a new machine ready to go. When he has to reinstall Windows because something broke, he's fucked for the rest of the day thanks to Windows' archaic package management/update methods, not even taking into account the considerably longer install time for Windows vs. say Ubuntu or Manjaro.

The software we're working with has been compiled for Windows, but again, Windows' instrinsic flaws make it unattractive. We need total control over every package, every repository, or equivalent thereof, of the OS. It's not a *cost* issue, it's a ""what offers the best performance for the fewest headaches?"" issue."

Captain: Picard

Ops: Riker/Shelby/Seven

Tactical: Worf/Tuvok, jagain, for the friction and potential friendship. Not enough Vulcan/Klingon interactions in my opinion.

Security: Jadzia/Kira

Science: Data/Maddox as a duo, With an alternate universe (NOT MIRROR) Ezri (just as an excuse to have both Ezri and a Jadzia at the same time)

Engineering: Geordie as Chief Engineer, sticking in engineering, with O'Brien running opposite shift and stuff outside main engineering (Jeffries tubes and what-have-you) add in Rom as a sort of go-between, lending a second set of hands to both LaForge and O'Brien as needed. It would be fun to see O'Brien and LaForge work together and butt heads occasionally. I would argue that O'Brien's improvisational skills derived from field experience and LaForge's academy training would cause some friction, with both being right and/or wrong in tough situations.

Medical: Bashir, with the EMH as lead Nurse, in a Nurse Chapel/Ogawa type position, hijinks ensue.

DaystromInstitute,fdkryrs,t1_fdk6cf5,1578509915.0,"Ronald D. Moore said as much in an interview, he was able to implement a ton of ideas he had for Voyager into BSG. Specifically, visible wear and tear building up on the ship, cultural clashes between crew-members, which in turn lead to an evolution of the culture on the ship. In BSG this takes place as conflicts between those from different colonies (Secular Capricans vs. fundamentalist Geminon, for instance). For Voyager, he wanted this to take the form of Maquis and Starfleet officers influencing each other, and even changes to the uniform as Voyager crew has to make do without repair facilities, dry docks, etc, and the ship becomes a permanent home to the crew, and not just a long-term deployment. By season 7, the crew wouldn't really be ""Starfleet"" any more, in terms of attitude or work culture, nor would they be recognizably Maquis, they would have become distinctly Voyager crew, and if/when they got back to Federation space, there would be friction between Voyager's crew and Starfleet.

The Galactica and her civilian fleet gain scars over the events of the show, the interior is adapted to those now living there, disused storage rooms are converted into dwellings, meeting places, even a bar and distillery. RDM wanted the same for voyager, the closest he got was Neelix's kitchen, and astrometrics. He proposed that voyager implement alien technology for repairs, changing the actual model of the ship exterior and interior, (similar to the borg tech on the hull during *Scorpion*.) Unfortunately, the network demanded that Voyager be as light as possible in regards to continuity baggage. In Syndication, episodes would be run out of order, and the lack of an end-of-episode reset button might be discouraging to new viewers. DS9 was the continuity heavy, season-long arc experiment, Voyager was supposed to be the TNG-lite episodic alternative to that kind of narrative."
