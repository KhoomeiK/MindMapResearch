CrossStitch,fecaxjp,t1_fecascy,1578969840.0,It's with the rest of my thread and the only one that did it so it must have been a bad batch. Ugh. It's such a pretty color too.
CrossStitch,fdsxyw0,t1_fdswdmg,1578709400.0,They're pretty cheap on etsy. This one was like $5

CrossStitch,fdcaahk,t1_fdbr579,1578270224.0,It's actually hanging outside of my craft room. I just found this subreddit last night and had this picture already on my phone from when I had finished it.
CrossStitch,fdc968d,t1_fdc7rd3,1578269563.0,I agree. I was shocked when I went to link it. I'm pretty sure it comes with multiple options though.

CrossStitch,fdav8n6,t1_fdapifr,1578250641.0,I don't think so. It kind of goes more classic to not but not in any chronological order.
CrossStitch,fdajebl,t1_fdahgno,1578246731.0,Kind of sad I didnt think of this.

CrossStitch,fda4851,t1_fda36jc,1578241415.0,I used a pattern except for Moana. That was tinkerbell originally. I think the hardest one to do was Elsa because it has a gradient effect to it.

techtheatre,fd7dwr3,t3_ek72zg,1578202966.0,"I would definitely work some. I took 3 years off before getting my MFA. Also, there are plenty of programs out there that will cover your tuition AND pay for you to work for the school. I'm halfway through mine right now and theres no way I could do side gigs and do school."
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fcxk6ox,t3_ejgm71,1578064936.0,I got it through the christmas event.
