NoStupidQuestions,fekolw0,t1_fejyiud,1579204387.0,"Yeah I just had emergency surgery a few days ago, and that hospital bill is going to be at LEAST in the 6-figure range. This is following a major surgery I had just 4 weeks ago, which was an even more complicated, ie expensive surgery. Altogether, my total cost for medical expenses is probably going to be well over $500,000. That’s half a million dollars because my organs weren’t working properly, something out of my control. The average person can’t just shell out half a million dollars because they got sick. Not to mention I’ve missed weeks of work, and we don’t have enough sick days, but that’s a whole different story. 

I know if the US adopts universal healthcare, that I will still be paying monthly/annually, but individual costs will be significantly lower. I understand that part of it. I wouldn’t be forced to file for bankruptcy just because I needed emergency surgery. But my question was specifically, would this debt be forgiven under new healthcare? Thanks for clarifying that, I understand now that it’s a separate “agency” or what have you from the government, so I would still be in debt to this private company. Thanks for the Tesla explanation.

NoStupidQuestions,fejv9o4,t1_feju5al,1579186651.0,"Yeah that makes sense, we’re still at the very early stages. Thanks for pointing that out. 

Reading these responses, I feel like even down the line, it’s not going to happen this way. But I also strongly feel like people shouldn’t be punished for getting sick as if it were a crime- too many people have medical debt from instances out of their control, and have it ruin their lives as if they had a choice or committed a crime. So if some states who have legalized weed can forgive people who have been convinced of minor marijuana-related crimes, then why can’t we forgive people who have debt due to unforgiving medical bills? Too many people have their lives ruined by one unforeseen medical emergency, the system is so unforgiving."
NoStupidQuestions,fejuqzz,t1_fejtua9,1579186308.0,"Wow I hope she was able to get help. 

I’m aware how the universal healthcare process will work and that the healthcare isn’t free, taxes will raise, etc. I worded my post poorly by saying “free”, sorry for the confusion (I’m currently ill, three days post-major surgery, in recovery and very sleep deprived/on meds/hurting/not quite feeling 100%). 

I was more just curious about what would happen specifically to the already existing medical debt. In some states where marijuana has been legalized, people with outstanding minor crimes related to marijuana had their charges dropped and their crimes forgiven (obviously depending on the circumstances, but still). And I feel like I’ve heard people talking about forgiving student loans? So why not forgive medical debt, ya know? That’s more minor to me than weed crimes, people often have no control over medical emergencies and shouldn’t be punished for them as if it were a crime to be sick."

AskReddit,fcyc9g8,t3_ejjrd8,1578077919.0,"Fleetwood Mac at their reunion tour a few years ago when the full band finally got back together after 19 years. My Dad had introduced me to them when I was very young, and we had a special bond over them. We always said we would see them live together, but then they lost members and it wasn’t the same. The day they announced they were reuniting, my dad called to tell me, and he bought the two of us tickets. 

The night before the concert, I was unexpectedly dumped- by text message- while driving to the city where my dad lives. What adult does that, right? I had never been broken up with before, so I was on an emotional roller coaster before the show began. 

The concert was absolute magic. It raised my spirits, and it also broke my heart all over again. We laughed, we danced, we hugged, and we both cried to “silver springs”. Stevie Knicks is a goddess in my eyes, and it was so damn magical to be in her presence. I’ll never forget the experience"
