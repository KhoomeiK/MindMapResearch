Well, you’ve missed your reservation at that point. Try again another day. I’m sorry it’s your husband’s birthday, but that doesn’t change the fact that you should have planned better or called to let me know you were running behind.

nevertellmetheodds,fejx9ez,t1_fejo7nu,1579187947.0,"Nice, thank you. 

> A Cessna 182L (182), the lead airplane, and a Cessna 185F (185), the trail airplane, collided during a formation skydiving flight. Both pilots flew the airplanes in a rectangular pattern until they reached the jump altitude of 12,700 ft mean sea level. The 182 pilot established a jump heading and visually confirmed that the 185 was to the left side and aft of the 182. The 182 pilot then called out ""door open"" and jumpers ""climbing out."" Subsequently, the four skydivers on board the 182 climbed out onto the airplane's right wing strut and right wheel step. Almost immediately, the 182 was struck by the 185. The 182's windshield was shattered, and the airplane entered an uncontrollable descent. During the descent, the right wing separated from the airplane, and the right wing fuel tank exploded. The 182 pilot exited the airplane and parachuted safely to the ground. The 185 pilot reported that ""when it was time for the skydivers to climb out, the two planes began to drift together and in seemingly no time at all, the two were colliding."" After the collision, the skydivers on board the 185 jumped from the airplane as it inverted; the pilot was able to recover the airplane and land. 

TLDR: the pilot veered toward the other plane accidentally. No explanation was given. It was not a mechanical issue."
