I just worry that even if he understands where I'm coming from, that he'll just crave what he can't have. I do value my comfort, but I don't want to make him resent me either. We share a studio, so it's not like he can go into another room and look at porn. I don't want to suffocate him, you know? Idk. I don't understand how it works for men. Personally I'm happy, and I could go my whole life without laying eyes on another man. I just don't know if its realistic to expect a man to feel the same about me."

That way if you accept hearing his opinion, it's on you at that point. I had to do the same with my bf and it helped us tremendously."
