AmItheAsshole,fewhgob,t3_eqlbl1,1579410647.0,"YTA big time!

You ruined the experience of your husband witnessing the birth of his first child. You know your MIL doesn’t have to stare at the baby come out, she can be behind the curtain and keep you comfortable. You ruined it for everyone and frankly I don’t blame your husband acting cold towards you. What’s even more sad is that everytime he is going to look at his child, he is going to remember that he wasn’t present during his child’s birth."

Bravo with your response, I find that very admirable."

television,fdun6w9,t1_fdd8tyy,1578735653.0,I feel like there was no point to the show tbh. Nearly everything that happened had no explanation or backstory to it.

medicalschool,fdjylii,t1_fdjvse3,1578491510.0,I might be the clown but you’re the whole damn circus
medicalschool,fdjvr7i,t1_fdjv4n4,1578489097.0,I don’t need your shitty luck I’m going to get in very soon you dog
medicalschool,fdjv32v,t1_fdjq6qk,1578488474.0,That’s not a reason. You’re just offended by my name which is a justification for your shitty attitude you cocksucker dog.
medicalschool,fdjq0r1,t1_fdjnr5u,1578482952.0,That’s still a shitty personality to have. Hating on someone for no reason plus you disrespect people you don’t like instead of being amicable. You’re really a low life and you’re going to stay low for the rest of your life.
medicalschool,fdjmgt7,t1_fdjd007,1578477990.0,And that goes back to my original point. You disrespect anyone who you think is less than you. Good luck surviving in the real world.
medicalschool,fdielfr,t1_fdhuujd,1578441146.0,"That’s great you need others peoples input to confirm what you think. I do know what those two letters mean because I know exactly the blood, sweat and tears it takes just to earn those two letters. Don’t you dare think I’m oblivious to how Med school works because I know the system very well."

medicalschool,fdhip9p,t1_fdgthzt,1578423479.0,"But you do look bad. I can call myself whatever I want because I’m proud of who I want to be, if you have a problem with that then that’s on you but don’t you dare project your ill feelings onto me because that is unwarranted and oppressive. Being judgmental and disregarding me as a person just because of two letters, take a good look at yourself because if anything your personality is nauseating."
medicalschool,fdgt5tm,t1_fdgs76a,1578407673.0,Which is even worse. So does that mean you look down at everyone who isn’t considered your peer? Do I need to be your peer just for you to show a little respect? Are you going to deflect from these questions as well?
medicalschool,fdgs5hg,t1_fdgrdgd,1578406930.0,"Oh yes I have. But first off this isn’t an OR. Secondly you should be smarter and wiser to treat your peers better, not to mimic those with bad personalities. Plus there are other specialities outside of the OR with awesome dr’s, so learn from them."
medicalschool,fdgrbut,t1_fdgqqxw,1578406309.0,Great way to deflect from my questions by making another snide comment. What’s cringe is that you’ve survived this long in this world with your shitty personality. Have some respect for yourself boy.
medicalschool,fdgqk7s,t1_fdgnt3u,1578405710.0,Why isn't it? Can't I compliment someone for their achievement? Looks like this sub isn't for you as well cause you're a rude person.
modernwarfare,fdgq7d0,t1_fdg4rtv,1578405432.0,Same! I hate this map and I actually like Picadilly.
modernwarfare,fdgq18v,t1_fdf8q4v,1578405301.0,You're a funny cunt

AmItheAsshole,fch5isv,t1_fch45t2,1577647458.0,I’ve got what I want. The fact that you’re still active on reddit yet I’m still the last comment standing. Meaning I won the argument because you know how wrong you are. Thanks for confirming that for me. Just do me a favour and go see a therapist because your attitude is absolutely disgusting.
AmItheAsshole,fch20vi,t1_fcgdw8y,1577646520.0,Don’t believe a word she says. Serenading siren has no idea what’s going on in life.
AmItheAsshole,fcdu5sn,t1_fcago1w,1577613878.0,I'm still waiting for an answer you filthy person.
AmItheAsshole,fcb0a4v,t1_fcavhg0,1577580123.0,"Great to know you know my aim of the question better than I do right. You’re so smart that you can guess my tone and be so stubborn to believe your own thoughts. It’s funny that you’re telling me I’m assuming, but YOU’RE the one making an assumption in regards to the genuine nature of my questions. What a hypocrite! All you had to say was “there was no deeper reason for dating an older guy” and we wouldn’t be having this conversation right now. But as I said before, it’s very much evident you’ve experienced some sort of trauma because me asking you about your past is definitely triggering some form of abused you’ve received. Go get some help because you’re personality is abhorrent. 

> Imagine if you said you like to take things slow on a date and somebody jumped in ""oh, why? Did you get raped?"" It would be very rude.

Those are two very different things, what a stupid example. It’s universal and human nature to take things slow, that’s not just a principal for relationships but it’s a principal for life. Dating a man that is over 10 years your senior definitely rings some bells that’s for sure."
AmItheAsshole,fcaotfk,t1_fcago1w,1577573573.0,"It’s not an assumption at all if I’m simply inquiring about it through a question. If what I said was a statement THEN it would be an assumption. So read properly next time. 
Your hostility is strong and you need to honestly check yourself. You’ve just confirmed that you do have some issues and you’re way over in your head. You’re not obligated to tell me about you’re issues, but your approach is absolutely disgusting! Mind you you’re still a very naive person."
AmItheAsshole,fcafz37,t1_fc9o2yi,1577568567.0,"Why do you date men much older than you?

Is there a daddy issue associated?"
AmItheAsshole,fcacipa,t1_fc7nu1u,1577566761.0,"Hahahahahahaha I know right.

I can’t believe how beyond stupid that sounds."
