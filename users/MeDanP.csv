In my opinion, the same is true here.  There is no normal context for pissing on people, but there is a very widespread sexual context for it.  Whether the guy meant it that way is, IMO, irrelevant, and so we do not need to bother proving that.

I think there are many reasons people oppose assisted suicide, ranging from bad to good-ish.  On the bad end (forcing your religion on others is awful), ""suicide is a sin"".  On the good-ish end, I think some people are afraid it may be abused.  In the same vein, I think people are terrified of providing a means to give up hope.  Personally, I think people should be able to choose when and how to leave this world.  Whether you die today, next year, or next decade, the end result is exactly the same.  The only difference are the experiences between now and then, and if those experiences will be nothing but pain, I think skipping that bit is an attractive and very valid option.  I think it should be heavily regulated to avoid both abuse and stupid decisions--a healthy person shouldn't be able to get up, have a really bad day, and go get killed by a doctor on a whim--but I do think the option should be there.

A ""fanboy"" is more aggressive, hostile, and/or in denial.  You can like a current underdog without being a fanboy, as long as you are honest with yourself and not disrespecting people with different preferences.  That's my opinion, anyway.

Of course, I wouldn't consider simply recommending AMD as fanboyism, either.  They have some legitimately awesome chips, right now.  It becomes fanboyism when you're jumping into every thread with it and maybe getting aggressive or pushy.  But like I said before, it is more practical to enforce a blanket ban.  Then there's no argument over how mean/rude/aggressive someone was or wasn't.  It is a simple rule that's easy to follow and easy to enforce, cutting out all the drama.  The best kind.  No gray area or subjective interpretation.

Lastly, even if the Intel guy *is* a fanboy... guess what?  He's in his own castle.  Home turf.  r/Intel.  Where else would you expect to find them, if not there?

Honestly, nobody is missing out by being unable to evangelize for AMD in a dedicated Intel sub or vice versa.  I dare say that fans of a brand deserve to have a ""safe space"" where they can discuss it without people trying to convert them to some other brand.  After all, if they want to talk about CPUs in general, they can go to a sub that's not wholly dedicated to and named after Intel, yeah?

A permanent ban seems too harsh, but the idea of keeping AMD talk out of r/Intel is legit if that's the direction the community wants to take it.  I say let the Intel guys talk Intel in peace, if that's what they want.  Nobody is trapped in there, and they don't need rescuing.

No/limited US casualties but showing they won't just be bullied.

But all the subsequent threats and whatnot make it sound like they are unhinged and/or panicking, and IMO these threats just make a US response more likely."

LucidDreaming,fdiyvum,t1_fdio067,1578454221.0,"Well, I was not prepared for it at all when it happened.  I had not done anything with lucid dreaming in at least five years.  I had no idea what was going on.  I was just confused, unable to move, unable to breathe, and then some kind of dark entity was climbing all over me, strangling me, tormenting me, etc.  Even after I dispelled it, I was terrified of going to bed for the next few days.  Getting back into lucid dreaming was what dispelled the fear entirely.

So it may not be terrifying for you if you know what to expect and are actively practicing lucid dreaming techniques.  Even if it is, the fear should go away once you get used to it, though it is of course an individual journey."
LucidDreaming,fdiecab,t1_fdi0vlq,1578440983.0,"Just to expand on this and maybe simplify it a bit, your thoughts become reality in a lucid dream.  If you want to make a person appear in front of you, you need to *expect* them to be there.  You are not using magic, tapping into some external force.  You are just changing your own thoughts.

It's another reason to keep yourself calm, unworried, and confident.  If your mind is prone to ""what if I fail?"" type thinking, the dream will answer those thoughts by making you fail.  So, know what you want and trust in the outcome."
LucidDreaming,fdidnj3,t3_elh8bn,1578440531.0,"Yes it does.  That said, lucid dreaming also arms you with the tools you need to take a sleep paralysis nightmare and cast it into the void.  When you are in sleep paralysis, you have dream control.  That's why people see demons and shit.  They are afraid because they can't move or breathe properly, so their mind starts inventing evil to explain it.  With lucid dreaming techniques, that does not have to happen to you.

I had my first experience with sleep paralysis years after the last time I had practiced lucid dreaming.  I was absolutely *terrified*.  But at some point, something tipped me off that it was a dream, and I used dream control to obliterate the entire scene.  The demon, my bedroom, my body... all gone into a void of chaos/static.  It actually prompted me to get back into lucid dreaming.  I experienced sleep paralysis several more times after that.  It was no longer scary, and I was almost always able to use it to transition into a pleasant lucid dream."
LucidDreaming,fdid1gb,t3_elich7,1578440134.0,"I have never been very good with lucid dreaming, but I have experienced both WILD and FILD.  FILD was much easier to slip into, and somehow the ""pull"" of it was much stronger.  Like, it kinda sucked me in and was intense and vivid from the gate.  I feel like both of my FILD experiences left me with greater lucidity than WILD ever did.  But honestly, I would practice both.  FILD is really just a derivation of WILD, so what you learn practicing one will be helpful with the other.

As to how vivid your lucid dreams will be, that will vary.  The more lucid you are, the more vivid everything will be.  The real trick is holding on to your memory of those dreams after you wake up, which is not easy.  Even the most vivid dream can become foggy in less than an hour.  For that, I strongly recommend a dream journal.  The instant you wake up from your lucid dream, write down every detail you can remember--as detailed as you can be.  Come back and read it a few times later.  Doing that helped me immensely to maintain the clarity of my experiences.  It really works like nothing else can."

That's not to say that anything *can* travel faster than the speed of light.  Just that our inability to imagine a way doesn't necessarily preclude one from existing.

It is not that the code can't see Square's extra properties.  It doesn't *care* about them.  It asked for a Polygon, so it only uses Polygon properties and methods.  If it wanted to access the Square stuff, it could easily do so by taking off the Polygon mask and asking for a Square.
