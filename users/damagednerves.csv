SuicideBereavement,ff76rws,t1_ff6dfm9,1579642235.0,"I’m sorry for yours as well. I hope you find peace. It helps me to think of my son leaving me his pain to carry for him. I told him I would do anything for him, and this is what he needed me to do. That usually works. Sometimes it makes me angry and I have to find a new coping strategy.  But I’m learning to roll with the tides of grief instead of against them. People keep telling me how strong I am but it’s not strength. It’s something else. It’s music turned up loud to drown out my thoughts. It’s love, it’s hate, it’s everything in between. A lot of the time it’s spite. But I grab onto whatever it is and let it guide me through another day. I hope you find something to grab onto too."

SuicideWatch,ff74fb6,t1_ff6p2zx,1579640910.0,That’s great! I hope it works for you. If it doesn’t try something else. Keep communicating. You are not a burden. I’m rooting for you too. Get well internet friend.
insanepeoplefacebook,ff6d4cv,t1_ff69vac,1579624589.0,"Gen X here with a china cabinet I inherited. Which is good because my fine china was bought for me as a wedding gift when I was born. I hate it. It takes up so much space. I was gifted a setting for twenty four! Who has a sit down dinner party for twenty four? I donated half of it. It’s just me and my husband, and the China sits in the cabinet. Every once in a while I get it out to use and you better believe I’m putting those hand wash only fancy dishes in the dishwasher!"
SuicideWatch,ff6br4h,t3_ervbf6,1579623723.0,"I want to address you feeling like a burden. You are not a burden. That’s your disease talking. My burden is dealing with my son’s suicide. He completed it so he wouldn’t be a burden to us. He was never a burden. We wanted to help him.  Your people want you to get well. They want you well because they are rooting for you, not because your a burden. Trust me, the burden is suicide. I have to carry that for the rest of my life. It’s cost me my job, friends, family, and health. Please don’t let thinking you are a burden be your reason. Go to the hospital. If it works, great. If it doesn’t try something else. I use some real out of the box therapy to stay level. I just want to be with my son, but I’m here. I’m still trying. Keep trying."
SuicideBereavement,ff6axcs,t1_ff5rrwi,1579623195.0,"Hey,  I’m right there with you. I’m also in ketamine infusion therapy. I think I have an edge though because I was already getting it for pain before my son completed suicide. So I knew how to prepare myself mentally to get the best use of my infusion. It really is a helpful tool, but that’s all it is, a tool. You still have to do a lot of work to get the benefit of it. Kind of like if I handed you a hammer. Just because it’s in your hand doesn’t mean the nail is driven home. I’m in a Facebook ketamine support group. It’s really helpful. There are a few suicide survivors there too. I hope you get the benefit of the ketamine. I hope it allows you to process your grief and rewire your thinking. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t get my infusions. They’ve saved my life more than once. I hope they save yours too."
SuicideWatch,ff60drd,t1_ff5cuxo,1579615877.0,"What do you want them to do? Do you tell them what you want them to do?  Are you specific? When my son reached out to me, it may have seemed like I went about my daily life. I went to work. I ran some errands. But I was also researching what I could do to help him. I kept this quiet from him so I wouldn’t stress him out. So I could take some of the burden off of him.  But all he saw was I did nothing. At the time doing nothing was the biggest something I was doing. Every thing in me screamed to get on a plane and go to him, call the authorities, do something! I did nothing so he could see he could trust me, and all he saw was I did nothing. Nothing is something. If you need more, say something."
SuicideBereavement,ff53jjh,t1_ff4xwcm,1579579249.0,"You are hurting and desperate for justification. I will not give it to you. Suicide is not the answer. Mental illness is a nuisance, but only to yourself.  It’s your disease that’s lying to you. It’s your disease that lacks sympathy and empathy. It’s your disease that is unloving and unforgiving. The people who love you, love you. It’s that fucking simple. You want to be pro choice? Choose healthy. You want to change the stigma? Then change the fucking stigma."
SuicideBereavement,ff4b174,t1_ff3hud5,1579559439.0,"You don’t know that for sure until you are in my position. When I was first informed, I was in disbelief, but I could only linger there for an hour before having to inform the other members of my family. Everyone has told how calm I was telling them, and assuring them he was at peace, his fight was over. He wasn’t suffering anymore. I could tell other people theses words to help them process his death. To ease the blow, to ease their pain. I want to be able to believe these things. If I did maybe I would be able to function again. I try to believe these things. I say them to myself all day but it doesn’t matter, because grief is stronger than words. 

I’ve been suicidal. I know that peace. I know how tempting it is. What I would give to have that. But I’m here breathing. I’m here cleaning up his mess that he left behind. I’m here fighting for him after his death to make sure his memory isn’t tarnished. I’m here dealing with the mounds of time sensitive paperwork (which is ironic since he will be just as dead tomorrow). I’m here as the keeper of his belongings- holding onto everything he touched that no one can part with but also can’t look at. I’m here making sure his family is ok, making sure his friends are ok. I’m here when they call me crying, or cussing his name, I’m here. I’m not supposed to outlive him but I’m here. I’m here and he’s not and it’s infuriating. 

You say you are pro choice about suicide. Imagine not having that choice. On top of that choice being removed from your exit plan, imagine the worst possible pain, multiply it by infinity. Once you get there, imagine losing your job because you barely function, losing friends because you’re too sad to be around and you remind them of the worst thing that can happen, losing good health because grief is stress and stress is hard on the body, losing family because blame is inevitable. Imagine all of that and it will only give you a glimpse into our side of suicide. There is no way to aptly describe it. But I can promise you, you would feel angry. If anything you would feel angry just to feel anything besides sorrow."
SuicideBereavement,ff36194,t1_ff1pgba,1579534526.0,"I didn’t get angry when my son told me he was suicidal. I tried to help him, support him. I would’ve done ANYTHING for him. So when he did complete suicide, it did make me angry. He gave up to find his peace and handed us a lifetime of grief. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him, miss him, feel betrayed, feel love, feel depressed, feel happy that his pain ended, feel guilty for feeling happy for him...I could go on and on about the hundreds of emotions that hit me every day all at once. It’s the most brutal, unrelenting pain I’ve ever felt. I’ve also been suicidal in the past. That loneliness, and sadness is nothing compared to suicide grief."
SuicideWatch,fevy050,t3_eqows5,1579402960.0,"That’s a scary feeling.  It’s hard to imagine feeling good when you feel so bad. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible though. It took me 20 years to find the right meds because I was diagnosed wrong. All I needed to do was find a doctor that listened to me. I wish I knew that sooner. I wish my son knew that too. He was about your age when he completed his suicide.  Don’t give up like he did. Be your own advocate. Talk to your doctor, your family, your friends, anyone. Tell anyone, and accept help. If it doesn’t work try something else but keep trying."

SuicideWatch,fel25qh,t3_epmh3y,1579212428.0,"My son thought about it. He put certain things in place to try to help us cope with his death. He even sent me to this sub. None of it helps. He’s gone and nothing can change that. It’s the most brutal, unrelenting pain I’ve ever felt."
walstad,fel0ljk,t1_fekm8jq,1579211493.0,Thank you for your condolences and advice. It’s been a hard journey for sure. I just want to bring life into something of his to honor him. I know about an aquarium specialty store he liked but it’s still too hard for me to go there.  We would go together and I still have trouble visiting places that hold memories. But maybe I can drum up some courage. Thank you again for your advice.
walstad,fel054r,t1_fekqel7,1579211222.0,"I originally added the potting soil and topped it with river rock and waited a few days for it to settle. It never did and was just mud after getting all of the small sticks and debris scooped out. So I went with some comments on the you tube video and removed the soil and just used river rocks. I was pretty disappointed because I really want to use the Walstad method, but I think with more research I may just create a pond in my backyard. I’m more familiar with how to bring life to my backyard. I have an invisible fountain I built from free stuff on Craigslist and it’s done pretty well without chemicals, and nature does a good job planting things in and around it. But first I want to get this aquarium set up one way or another to honor my son."
walstad,fekzhbz,t1_fekn2ef,1579210828.0,Ok thank you for your advice. I will look into that. I definitely don’t want to hurt any critters in the process.

SuicideWatch,fejwp5d,t1_fej0nk3,1579187583.0,"It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I lost my job, our family has been broken because blame is inevitable. I can’t leave my house. I’m sedated most days to ease the pain but it does nothing for the pain, it just makes me tired. His friend ended up in the hospital for wanting to join him. He got a two month stay. We have new health problems because grief is stress and stress is hard on the body. On good days when we can smile or laugh the guilt eats us up for smiling or laughing. It’s awful. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. You can’t live while grieving, you just survive and waste away."
SuicideWatch,feio96v,t3_epcpjr,1579143161.0,"Hey friend, don’t be afraid. It sounds like you are already working on it because YOU LISTENED today. You thought about it, and you brought it here.

SuicideWatch,feinpnz,t3_epcqjw,1579142806.0,"Hi there. Sorry you’re feeling this way. As a woman I can tell you I’ve crossed the street for any type male when walking alone. It had nothing to do with looks, race, or anything else you might be feeling. It was just what I was taught to keep myself safe. Did I think that guy was creepy? Not usually, it just became my habit to cross the street. So let’s cross that one off your list. 

I don’t know how to make you feel better about how you look. You can’t change genetics but you can change perception and that comes from with in. Embrace what you dislike. Why does being short mean ugly? Bruno Mars is 5’4” Prince was 5’2” (I think... fact check that one) Tom Cruise is 5’5”. That’s three famous short guys known for dating hot women. I know a short guy (he’s brown, as you described yourself) he’s dating a beautiful blonde over 6’ tall. He’s the most charming, confident, compassionate guy I’ve ever met. There physical appearances don’t match but their love does. It is undeniable and their secret was they chose the person who made them laugh, feel secure, feel loved. That’s what makes a person beautiful. I know you are beautiful because you reached out here. This is a dark place to find yourself scrolling. But you took the time to reach out here. That’s a beautiful thing because that is self discovery. Keep searching for yourself, and love yourself. You can’t love someone else until you love yourself. I say that because my son was your age when he took his own life.  He wanted to give all of his love away and didn’t save any for himself. 
Best of luck internet friend. I hope you get a wonderful life."
SuicideWatch,fe6e0yk,t3_enxjik,1578888142.0,"I know how hard it is to go through every day thinking nothing will work to help you. It sounds like you’ve tried different meds, have you tried a different doctor? I went through my whole life misdiagnosed and put on the wrong meds. Meds that might have eased my depression if it was typical depression. Since it wasn’t typical depression the meds actually made me worse. I’m in a new treatment plan now (have been for 4 years) and it saved my life. 

My son shared my diagnosis. He too was burnt out on not feeling better. I tried to get him into my treatment program but he refused. He chose death instead. So I do understand the desperation you feel. I heard it in his voice. Don’t let that desperation drown out my voice. It is a battle, but it can be won. You can have a quality of life, happiness even.  I had that until my son took his life. He left me in his darkness. I inherited his pain to carry with mine. 

I have every reason to give up. I even have the sympathy of my friends and family if I did decide to join my son. They would understand why I couldn’t live without him. But I’m still here. I’m still breathing. I’m still fighting.  Fight with me. 

Imagine the life you can have with your dogs. Imagine saving more dogs because you saved yourself.  You can do that. Keep fighting."

The breakdowns your family is having is them loving you and not knowing how to help you. All they want is to help you. Let them, give them the instructions to save you.

I have a living son as well.  We do our best to disguise our pain for him. Unsuccessfully, I’m sure, but we all continue to pretend for each other’s sake. 

I wish you strength moving forward. I won’t ask you to consider your family. We both know that’s not how this works.  But we also know about the quiet strength that lies under grief. The strength that kept kept our hearts beating when our minds begged them to stop. I hope that quiet strength is never out of your reach. I wish you ease of suffering, even knowing that the suffering is forever. May your pain be tolerable, teachable, and pliable enough to live your life around it. 

Keep fighting. Fight for yourself any way that you can. Even if it’s ranting on the internet. We give kindness when we can. We take it when we need it."

SuicideWatch,fdeqx8l,t3_ekzqls,1578344748.0,"Those are some good guidelines. 

Can we try the same approach with you? Can we cut the bullshit? Chronic illness sucks, no doubt. I have a pretty nasty one. I get it. But.....medicine is always evolving. Be your own advocate with your health. Find new doctors, new treatments. I get it, chronic means forever. It sucks but you would be surprised how much has changed since my diagnosis 20 years ago. Are somethings worse? Sure, but my quality of life was better. 

My son recently completed suicide so my current quality of life is in the shitter. But I put myself in this prison. When I’m ready, I will get out. 

Getting a handle on the depression that comes with chronic illness is huge. You already did that. Now just like you focused on getting your room clean, sit down and focus on getting quality of life back. 

You can do this.

I did not make the call. With my son. I will live with that mistake the rest of my life. It cost him his life.  

It’s an impossible choice you faced. Sometimes there is no right answer. What you did was pure of heart. I hope in time your partner heals from what’s hurting him. I also hope he forgives you. Even if he doesn’t, I would give anything for my son to be alive and hate me, than what his suicide feels like."

SuicideWatch,fddtdld,t3_ekomzn,1578323485.0,"I’m sorry your doctor used that protocol. It’s not what’s supposed to happen. 

I’m going to play devil’s advocate for a second. Maybe since you gave him the truth, he felt like he owed you the truth?  My sons suicide tore our family apart. Suicide does that. It’s part of it.  The aftermath is more complex than just wrecking your family. So let’s move on to how to help you. 

I think what others suggested about finding a therapist for additional support is a good idea. Keep in mind therapists are like shoes. You have to try a few on to get the right fit. 

I talk about my suicide plan openly with my therapist. It’s helpful. There is no judgment for me. But I’m also expected to be suicidal. All mothers have ideation after a child completes suicide. Some try, some succeed, but we all want it. If I didn’t want it, they would be more concerned. 

Let’s talk about your dogs now. My dog was my reason too. Until my son stole my death. It was supposed to be me. My son inherited my mental illness and he moved out. He didn’t have a dog. He wasn’t allowed to have one where he was. I think animals are a helpful tool to stay alive. 

I even go to animal therapy. A human therapist is present asking me questions but my replies go to the animal. It makes it easier. My human therapist also gives me homework. I volunteer at the animal shelter. I just do laundry. I like it because there is zero human interaction but hundreds of dogs and cats benefit with warm, clean blankets. Maybe that’s an option for you too. 

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Not guilt tripping just factual. I hope you find what you need to live. I’m pulling for you."
SuicideWatch,fdcua8h,t3_ekhymt,1578284500.0,"I’m sorry, bipolar and trauma don’t mix well.  You must feel awful right now. 

It sounds like you might be rapid cycling? If you are, you shouldn’t be getting infusions. The good new is ketamine infusion therapy works well because it’s not addictive.  No taper or withdrawal. Please call your doctor and tell them what’s going on so they can get you leveled out. They may also be able to provide you with resources to get out of domestic abuse. 

Good luck to you."
SuicideWatch,fdccp83,t3_ekkyem,1578271714.0,"I wasn’t lying to my son when I told him he mattered. His brain was lying to him that he didn’t matter.

You fucking matter."
SuicideWatch,fdcaahw,t1_fdc38rk,1578270224.0,"I didn’t call it in. I didn’t notify the authorities when my son called. I wasn’t doing nothing by doing nothing. I was afraid if I called it in I was assuring he would complete his suicide. I thought he was safe. So I did nothing. It was the hardest decision of my life and it cost him his. 

Sometimes doing nothing is the biggest something a family is doing for you because we don’t know what to do. If you need more than that, tell them. Give them the instructions to save your life. 

My son told me he was suicidal and he asked me to do nothing. He wasn’t asking for help, he was saying goodbye. I knew the risk and I loved him enough to do nothing because he asked that of me. I wasn’t saying goodbye, I was trying to help. 

I would have done anything to save him, even nothing. Even when everything inside of me screamed do something. He was supposed to have seen that as the faith I had in him. He was supposed to see that he could trust me no matter what. But all he saw was I did nothing. I haven’t told anybody that part before. I think you need to hear that part more than anyone I know in real life. 

Give your family a chance to help. Let my son’s story help. Let my story help. And accept this as help. These words, they’re nothing. I’m doing nothing for you. Please see how enormous that is. 

Get well kiddo, and good luck."

I don’t have magic answers. If I did my son wouldn’t have completed his suicide. I have some advice though. 

Mental illness is awful. I have it, my son inherited it. I tried to get him to try my treatment plan but he refused. I think it could’ve saved him. It’s was experimental when I started it but is now FDA approved. The side effects are minimal and only last a few days, then you get months of bliss, rinse and repeat. It’s called ketamine infusion therapy. It gave me my life back. 

As far as your note is concerned, it will go to your next of kin. That person and only that person has the discretion to share it. Same goes for your belongings. It doesn’t matter if you designate things in your note. If you don’t have a will your next of kin will have to hire a lawyer to go to probate court to get your belongings. It takes months. It’s salt in the wound of grief. 

It sounds like you love your family. I bet they love you too. Give up, but give yourself up to them. Let them try to help you. Let them have the opportunity to exhaust all of their options. Give them that gift rather than a note and death.

SuicideWatch,fdakdor,t1_fd9m7js,1578246996.0,"You sound like my son did. He felt so bad for burdening us with the knowledge that he was suicidal. He felt bad making me cry and tell him how sorry I was that he felt that way. That was all he heard of the conversation. So much more was said. I told him he was not a burden. I told him we wanted to help him. I begged him to live, I told him I loved him. I sent him a text the next evening reminding him that I loved him. He read the text the following morning (read receipt) and killed him self. 

My son wasn’t a burden. My tears were of love. What the burden is, is carrying his pain now that he’s gone. Having to carry the guilt of what if’s is a burden. What could I have said or done differently is a burden. His death is a burden. 

His life was never a burden. Never. Don’t deny your family the chance to help you. Give them that chance. Give them the instructions to save you.

SuicideWatch,fcvdwh3,t1_fcv14iw,1578000061.0,Yes it’s written out and we revise it together. My son completed his suicide recently. I think if I said I was fine I would’ve gotten a one way ticket to the psych ward. I’m expected to be as suicidal as I am. As long as I don’t cancel my appointments and do the work to try to live we can talk openly about my plan. It’s been surprisingly helpful to be able to be open about it.

For my case it’s common for mothers to follow their children who completed suicide. So it wasn’t a big secret that I want to join my son. But laying it all out, going through the same motions as my son did before he died is helpful. It might be worth mentioning this type of therapy to your therapist.

No ones losing weight, quitting smoking, or making better decisions by the weekend. It’s just a reason to get drunk and make a list. You are not required to participate in New Years bullshit. Take it off your plate. What can you do to make your morning better? Eat your favorite cereal, pet a dog, play video games, go for a walk, whatever. Take a few minutes to do something for you tomorrow.  That’s it, just do something kind for yourself. Or for someone else if you feel really bold. But fuck New Years. My son killed himself in 2019. It’s the last year he existed in. I did not want to see 2020 without him. But here I am. I made it. In the morning I’m Making pancakes for my dog. You know why?

So what needs to be said is, it’s okay to be afraid. It’s actually healthy that you are afraid of these thoughts. Be afraid of the thoughts but do not fear reaching out. Do not be afraid to ask for help. If you think it will hurt them or overwhelm them ask someone else. Ask a teacher or counselor for help. Tell your parents your sick with a sore throat, go to the doctor tell the doctor about these thoughts, tell them about your fears, ask for help. It’s okay to not know what to think anymore, you don’t need all of the answers, you only need to keep trying. Keep asking, insist on help. I wish you the best of luck and a long, happy future."

There are a lot of different styles of psychiatry/psychology/therapy. It’s sounds overwhelming but once you find what works for you a beautiful thing happens. You can start to heal. Personally I prefer animal therapy. I don’t make eye contact easily. Eye contact is expected in humans and avoided with animals. I prefer equine therapy (horses) so I go to a place and talk to a horse. My human therapist is there too. She asks questions and I answer to a horse. It works for me. Find what works for you. 

I understand being afraid. My son was afraid. He poured his feelings out in his note. He didn’t give me a chance. Would I have over reacted? Probably. I wish I could say I would’ve been calm but you’re talking about your child’s life. I wouldn’t have gambled his life. Would I have calmed down after knowing he was safe? Absolutely. I can say without a doubt that the only thing I would’ve wanted was for him to live. Your dad might over react. He probably will. But it will be short lived (no pun intended) . He’s over reacting to save your life.  You could wait until you find a therapist that works for you.

The phone is just trying to remove the world your in, because it’s hurting you. We want to remove what’s hurting you. The phone is a physical thing we can remove. Your dad doesn’t know what to do. Try asking your dad to get you into counseling. Start there. Make a list of things he can do to help you. Maybe it’s something simple like something you enjoyed together before you became suicidal.

I hate the bereavement groups. They are full of stupid prayers and angel memes. They love to say keep going for my living son. They don’t understand that living feels like a betrayal. That I am caught between two worlds. It’s almost fitting since I’m bipolar. I passed that on to my son, but I didn’t pass on a will to live. 

I write him letters too. Sometimes I shred them, and sometimes I put them next to his urn. I tucked his urn into his bunk bed. I couldn’t stand the thought of putting him on display somewhere. People hate me for that. 

I come here to save others, because I couldn’t save him. I understand your grief, and the guilt. But what the bereavement groups don’t talk about is that feeling in your gut. It’s hard to explain. I can’t put it into words. The closest I can get is; that feeling of just knowing I can join him. We don’t talk about that feeling in bereavement. It’s selfish there.

1. How’s your health scare? I had the same thing when I was young. It’s so frustrating not getting the info for so long. Keep in mind they do that for legal reasons. It’s not usually because it’s terrible news. 

2. Call the local shelters about your lab. They have programs to donate surplus food to people struggling. They want you to keep your dog, they will help you feed him/her.  Especially this time of year when their donations are high. 

3. Put school on hold. Since you already dropped out, take some time to get back on track. Get your mind well. This means take the Wellbutrin as prescribed. Who knows, it might help you. If it doesn’t, we will cross that bridge when we get there. See you in 4 months. 

4. Poverty sucks, I’ve been there. Call the local churches. Even if your not religious, ask about their charities. Some have food banks, others have clothes closets, ask about job resources, ask about car donations. Take charity when you need it, give charity when you don’t. 

5. Don’t give up. My son gave up. Before he died, he sent me a text to come to this sub. Don’t give up."

Also to address why you’re on this sub, I know what it’s like to want to die, rather than face strict parents. It’s been a while, but I’ve been there. Now I’m an adult who lost a child to suicide. There is nothing we couldn’t have faced together if he only gave me the chance. 
I understand if you still say, you can’t face them if you are pregnant. If that’s the case,  please reach out in other subs to try to find an alternative. Do some research to find a solution other than suicide (outreach programs in your state etc)
If you aren’t pregnant, can you get on the pill? Use condoms with the pill to secure safe sex (I did get pregnant on the pill. I didn’t know antibiotics make the pill ineffective)

You keep mentioning knowing people who have dealt with suicide. Have you personally dealt with someone close completing suicide? 

My honesty regarding suicide and the fallout of suicide on family members isn’t bullshit. I come here and comment on what it’s like out of experience.  I’m nothing but brutally honest because I have nothing left to lose.   

The cop out is thinking there is some way to reduce the fallout. That death is some how making other people’s lives better. How nice it must have been for my son to die thinking we are better off without him. He doesn’t have to see the wreckage he left behind. He felt better about his choice, not us. 

To enlighten you a little further for everything he gave us to make it easier, the investigation nullified. I read my sons autopsy report. I was required to. I had to read how my son was dissected like a fucking frog. It doesn’t matter who you write notes to; they all go to the next of kin. They have full discretion to share or not share them. Deleting your history doesn’t mean shit. The labs retrieve and provide that information too. Apple is pretty tight but not impossible to get into. 

I don’t use guilt tripping here. I use my experience. I’ve also been suicidal in the past and am treated for it again now. I’m a high risk because of my own mental illness, as well as a physical illness that’s so painful it’s called the suicide disease. Add a dead child and I’m a ticking time bomb. So, yeah I get it.

My son did everything he could to make his death painless on us. He distanced himself for the last year. He wrote suicide notes, made his own funeral playlist, made phone calls, he even took out life insurance to pay for his funeral. He did everything to get us through it and none of it helps.

We will carry their pain for them now, because we can. We will help others, because we couldn’t help them. We will survive them, but never really live again. We will and it will hurt, but we will.

I found a job I love, my children grew up, despite a painful disease I found meds that help, despite being bipolar I found a way to be productive. Life was good, then my youngest son killed himself. I can’t help but think it’s beyond unfair that I survived so much trauma in my life only to lose my son. Not only lose him but have him choose death. He wrote notes. He doesn’t want me to blame myself. He called before he did it. I loved him too much and he didn’t want to hurt me. I killed him with love. How fucked up is that?

I hope you find what you need to go on. My son thought he wasn’t enough. He thought he wasn’t worthy of love despite us telling him he was. He got lost in his own mind. He only focused on the negative. He was bipolar too. He didn’t understand how I got rid of  the voices, he said they’re too loud. He didn’t give me a chance to help him.

What I want you to know is everyone, and I mean everyone has something that weighs them down.  Sometimes those things sound trivial but they are enormous to that person.  When people (my family or friends) complain to me about xyz, I can’t help but think they have no idea what I’m going through. And here’s the trick- they don’t. Because they are not me. It wasn’t their son. They don’t have my brain. My husband lost our son too, but even he can’t relate to me. He’s not me. That doesn’t mean that their problems are less than mine. Similarly, I can’t walk around and expect the world to understand my pain. I can ask them to try to understand, and they have the right to say no. I say no a lot now. I don’t have the mental capacity to be the friend I was before. It doesn’t mean I don’t care. I can’t tell you I know what it’s like to be a transgender 16 year old. I can tell you I had my own struggles at that age. Maybe they would be trivial to you or maybe you would be surprised I survived. Either way, I survived. Even when I didn’t want to, I survived.  You can survive this. You can. 
I lost count of how many therapists/counselors/psychologists/psychiatrists I’ve seen. You reach a point where the number becomes irrelevant and treatment takes priority. If it’s not working after a period of time (I give myself 8 weeks) you move on to something or someone new. But during those 8 weeks I give it 100%. Personally, I like any type of animal therapy. Equine therapy is amazing. The same rule applies to meds. If it’s not working or making me worse I try something else. I’m currently alive because of an experimental drug. I tried to get my son in this treatment but he refused. I think it could’ve saved him too. We shared the same disease. 
Don’t follow anyone if the options suck. Just be the best version of you. 
And a bit of motherly advice: stop doing the teen stuff. Stealing, drinking, getting high isn’t doing you any favors. You have a good head on your shoulders, use it. You are articulate, kind, and reaching out. Those aren’t the traits of someone who lacks guidance. You might be guiding yourself but you’re doing a helluva job. Be proud of yourself and love yourself. Things will get better but you have to be patient and you have to do the work. Good luck and I hope you find a doc that works with and for you."
