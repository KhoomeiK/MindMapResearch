popheads,fdna4jt,t1_fdkvl0y,1578581281.0,"FM is real, but most doctors don't understand it. that's different than Lyme which took on a life of its own, not unlike the anti-vaxx woo snake oil"

lexapro,fdk96ee,t1_fdk90s2,1578498914.0,"I happen to like ASMR also! It's probably not for everyone. I find a soothing youtube ASMR content provider and just use my light mask and earbuds and listen to someone whisper or something until I get tired. Passing time helps with anxiety. Also you've got to avoid acting out, freaking out, or lashing out at anyone. Actions matter and make anxiety worse."
lexapro,fdk90s2,t3_eltesr,1578498816.0,"I have taken 10mg of Lexapro for many years. 

The way I manage bouts of anxiety is the same as I probably should have before Lexapro. A like to clear my mind, sit quietly in a place where I am not disturbed, eat well, sleep enough but not too much, Go for walks and make sure I get a bit of exercise. Avoid social media completely, not too many video games or apps on phone on computer. Get my work done and then leave it alone and forget it until I have to work again. Go to bed early without much music, light or TV. I use a light blocking mask thing when I am especially tired or it's early or my wife isn't tired and lights may be on around room or house. I spend time with my dog or son to encourage my mood. I like to get a little cleaning done to make my OCD trait feel better, but NOT overdo it. Little vacations don't hurt. 

&#x200B;

These are things I still do almost every day, depending. One thing I am privileged enough to feel as I've gotten older is that I am important and needed. I don't let my work own me and I don't treat others that way. I take my mental health seriously and am not anyone else robot. THis is something the younger generations gets, I think. You can not take that too far however. It's a tough world and work is important. 

I hope that a bit helpful and not too much info."
lexapro,fdk7ntd,t1_fdjv68p,1578497947.0,"Bergen is right. The problem is that ultimately: an ECG does not tell you that it is ""not your heart"". To put it simply that is only one test, and depending on the patient or the situation it may not even be the right test or at least might require a further workup. No one should be able with the information that you've provided, be able to tell you to increase your dose, nor should they on the internet. Just be safe and get checked by your prescriber/provider."
aww,fdcoprd,t3_ekhn73,1578280194.0,this thread has some real weird fuckers in it

photoshopbattles,fcmofqy,t3_ehpzpr,1577784274.0,dude is fucking that cop up! good on him
farmingsimulator,fccscqw,t1_fccr7uh,1577602061.0,yes. rain may give good reason to lie fallow occasionally
childfree,fcb889e,t1_fcaxbgl,1577583639.0,yeah I don't care about the downvotes. Complicit? amateurish statement with no basis.  She's clearly unwell. Electric chair? yeah ok. that's insane. no skin off my back to get downvotes.
farmingsimulator,fc5vpvn,t3_egb5cm,1577466917.0,which grain trailers?
farmingsimulator,fc2ykyd,t1_fbi93to,1577377419.0,yeah I am using advanced settings. I have it down pretty well. every field and tools require a different strategy to cover it well and make it happen. cheers
childfree,fc2y6z6,t1_fbx6t8c,1577377162.0,"right. I agree. but that can also be called ""being in denial""... it's a state of mind. I know she is aware of what is real here and I don't believe her. but the human mind can be one hell of a weird thing. obvs"
childfree,fbt76r6,t1_fbhwxsn,1577070148.0,that's a bit strange for you to say. she is in denial but your comment is a little cruel and misdirected
