I don't care enough to discuss this because it's outside of our topic. What's clear is that there was no intention to kill.

> how the investigation will have ""the reason to believe"" other than what A said? How can A escape the jail in that scenario, assuming A is truly innocent?

Truly innocent yet having the means to end someone's life? Contrary to what movies tell us, killing someone is NOT easy. Much more so accidentally. 

It takes time and deliberation to choke someone to death. Death due to wounds would mean a critical organ must be injured, which usually means a weapon is involved. Unless high-speed vehicles are involved, head injuries rarely result in (instant) death. 

Because we don't care about assumptions, and we only care about what happened, we can ask A about what happened. What did B do? What did A do? How did it result in B's death? Did A call 911? Etc.

It's easy to prove or disprove what happened. Or at least, MUCH easier than justifying assumptions. We can dust for prints. We can do ballistic analysis. We can check for injuries. We can check the foot prints. We can compare the chronological order and the timeliness."

Having a ""super big advantage"" isn't. You think it is.    

An assumption isn't. You think it is. 

A verbal threat definitely isn't. 

Those might be good reason enough to *do something* but not go straight to killing, no. 

> you better believe they intent to use it, not waiting until they making the first shot

Hell yeah. I agree with you. But you don't go straight to killing. Call the police. Tackle the guy to the ground. Taser him. But you don't go straight to stabbyland! 

> Isn't this is an assumption that you hate so much to be used as justification? 

The ""reason to believe"" is based on facts, not A's assumption. Remember we're talking about the investigation, I.e. when it already happened, not when it hasn't happened. 

""Reason to believe"" is from the investigator's point of view. Not A's. 

If B hadn't even begun attacking and A already delivered a killing blow then the investigators have no reason to believe A's life was ever in danger. 

So the key difference is this: did something happen? Was fear involved in the conclusion, or was it based on facts?"

> Do you prefer A jailed in every scenario for murder or even premeditated murder?

It depends on the context. If A's life was really in danger, then no, I think it was self defense. And I would look for facts instead of assumptions.

Examples of facts:

- The assailant brought a knife or other lethal weapon and has shown intent to use it (just carrying or showing a knife isn't enough)
- They had a fight with the assailant which gets to the point where A felt their life was endangered  
- There is reason to believe A could not have intimidated or stopped the assailant using any other way"

Buddhism,fezaxw3,t1_feyril2,1579455507.0,"> all concentration practices involve NOT accepting things as they are, right? If I was truly accepting my experience then I wouldn't need to redirect my attention back to the object of meditation. I see no way around that.

One can accept one's level of income while still trying to change it.

Accepting comes in two forms: emotionally and rationally.

Emotional rejection means the thing stirs up emotions in us. Rational rejection means we recognize that something needs to be done.

We can redirect our attention back to the object of meditation without being disturbed (emotionally) by the thoughts, or by the fact that we have those thoughts.

For example, during meditation we can have a porn scene flash through our mind. We can enjoy it (but we shouldn't), or we can reject it while feeling disappointment or anger (which produces tension), or we can just recognize ""oh hey, I'm thinking about porn. Let me just get back to my breath...""

Re: tension and distraction, that's an interesting question!

We often use more muscle than necessary. For example, if we're asked to hold a glass of water with the arm outstretched, we might use more muscles than necessary! We might grip the glass too tightly, for example, or tense our neck muscles, or the arm muscles that don't actually help.

The balance between effort and relaxation in meditation I found to be thus: relax what's not needed, and tense what is needed, at just the right amount (because any excess is not needed). Both physically and mentally.

Practice awareness, let go of distractions. Over time the intention to 'practice awareness, let go of distractions' will be a distraction itself!"

> ""Monks, even if bandits were to savagely sever you, limb by limb, with a double-handled saw, even then, **whoever of you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my Teaching.** Monks, even in such a situation you should train yourselves thus: 'Neither shall our minds be affected by this, nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words, but we shall remain full of concern and pity, with a mind of love, and we shall not give in to hatred. On the contrary, we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to those very persons, making them as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love — thoughts that have grown great, exalted and measureless. We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will.' It is in this way, monks, that you should train yourselves."
Buddhism,feg3xdu,t1_fefq2b2,1579075806.0,"It's not even **an** interpretation.

What's being used are detectors. Devices. Not humans/minds/consciousness."
Buddhism,feg3ts1,t1_fefl7dx,1579075686.0,"1. The ""observer"" in the experiment is a physical detector which the particle physically hits. It doesn't mean a human observer, so it has nothing to do with the mind. Humans wouldn't be able to observe subatomic particles being hurled at the speed of light anyway. 

2. The wave pattern is a result of firing multiple electrons repeatedly, not from one electron/one shot.

Really, all this new age brouhaha over an oversimplified misunderstand of the word 'observer.' It's ridiculous. I'm not even sure the word 'observer' is used in scientific circles. The word detector is (more commonly?) used instead.

Edit: more modern versions of the experiment uses detectors which don't physically collide with the particles. Still not a human observer."

The fact that extroverts would be scared off too, means that comment was spot on 100% correct."
Buddhism,fefbe1m,t3_eorw2c,1579052601.0,"To put it (overly?) simply:

When we're in samsara, we're afraid of some thing in the corner which we perceive as a snake.

Nibbana happens after we realize it's a piece of rope, not a snake.

You're asking whether or not we can go back to perceiving it as a snake. My answer is:

1. You wouldn't have any reason to want to do that
2. Once you know something you can't un-know it"

If actual nepotism is involved you won't have to worry about funding because they'll get elected solely because of who their dad is. *That's* nepotism."
AskReddit,fedfn1y,t3_eo83cx,1579010222.0,"Basically, whenever you know someone is expecting something, and you're unable to fulfill it, even if that expectation is unsaid, or the assumption that you're going to fulfill that expectation is unsaid. Especially if you gain something from that interaction.

For example: you are morally obligated to let someone know that you're only looking for a casual fling, if you reasonably can guess that they're looking for a serious relationship, before you have sex with them. Failure to do so would mean you're taking advantage of them and their ignorant assumptions.

(Ignorant here is in the literal sense, meaning ""lacking knowledge"" or ""not knowing,"" and not the pejorative meaning, I.e. Stoopid.)"

""Most successful in the world""? You sound like Trump."
Buddhism,fe6tc0m,t1_fe66i1u,1578904484.0,"I'm perfectly fine with TM being unique. In fact, I take pleasure in knowing that other meditation schools aren't as deceptive. None of the other techniques promise the students that they can fly, for example. 

None of your links works. They take me to some Russian search engine or something."
Buddhism,fe63330,t1_fe43wz8,1578880686.0,"> TM enhances and balances the activity of hte part  of the brain (default mode network) that is responsible for sense-of-self, **leading in exactly the opposite direction on a physical level, as mindfulness and concentration practices do.**

Thank you. I was going to point that out, but I didn't want to be too confrontational. Thanks for doing that for us :) 


> In your desire to show TM works just like every other practice

No, I never said **every** other practice. Just some of what you can find in /r/nondirective's sidebar."
indonesia,fe3l4ai,t1_fe1fsjn,1578850258.0,"I don't necessarily disagree with you there. They might be gimmick, but they're innovations nonetheless. Notchless display, pop up cameras, under display fingerprint scanner, hard to call them 'generic.'"
Buddhism,fe3kijm,t1_fe1g5gf,1578850133.0,"You mentioned earlier that TM is taught through ""carefully scripted teaching play.""

If you read people's accounts, people who have actually spent lots of money to learn TM, you'll see that the ""carefully scripted"" part is true, to the point that the teachers don't actually know much outside of that script. Questions are met with vague answers such as 'don't think too much about it.' Or 'don't try too hard.'

So yes, at the core, learning TM is just like learning meditation through text or video.

Besides, there's lots of meditation instructions out there, including smartphone apps, and people have found great success through them. Are you doubling back on your claims about the accessibility of TM and how it breaks the culture of meditation having to be taught by an enlightened master? Which is it, is it exclusive or accessible? 

Also ultimately, /r/nondirective provides several paid sources, much much cheaper than TM. They teach basically the same thing, with less deception."

Told you it was a brand."
indonesia,fe1dxmb,t1_fdy5gpl,1578825493.0,"They're not ""generic.""

They're very innovative. From pop up cameras to phones without any ports or buttons to cameras that are hidden behind the screen, they do a lot of R&D. Samsung is boring in comparison. And don't get me started with Apple.

Their ads used to be tacky, yes, and while it's gotten better lately they still have that dancing SPG thing... Their products are not bad. Definitely not ""generic."""

Realme is one step ahead. (Why? Because they use state of the art hardware with Oppo's good ColorOS. While Oppo uses outdated hardware on good software and Vivo uses outdated software on good hardware.)

Xiaomi is trying hard to play catch up but I'd say they're just as good as Oppo now. Or at least the Indonesian Xiaomi is. They didn't market the Mi 9T here which would bring them a half step forward."
