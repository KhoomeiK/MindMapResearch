It’s just hard to want to go out now since the only thing on my mind is money and early retirement. I have a few friends I barely see anymore since I’m always grinding, they’re always out partying splashing their cash but always complain about how they have no money at the end of the day. I don’t wanna be like that so I pretty much just say no to clubs or going out unless it’s like a really good movie for $10. I don’t hangout with women at all anymore because of the amount of time that gets wasted.

It’s important to maintain your knockout power

Force = mass x acceleration

But you need to be able to use your mass.

It’s vital that you work on stamina since the more mass you have the more energy you’ll use up.

You’ll also need to work on your technique to utilize your mass effectively

Speed/accuracy is something people tend to overlook but it can save you a lot of energy if you’re not swinging and missing.

Defense: this is where your stamina comes into play, you’ll need to create distance/angles via head movement or stepping around. The best way to practice this is by sparring. But if you don’t always have a sparring partner, get a heavy bag and never EVER EVER EVER punch without moving your feet. otherwise you create the habit of being a walking punching bag in sparring. Plus it’s not realistic"

I would go with reputable companies such as these as opposed to a contractor/small business as there are a few bad apples that like screw people over with their “trial-periods” or other bs.

This week I started learning HTML/CSS/Javascript as I’ll definitely need good coding skills to make the next Facebook or something, plus the internet is a great opportunity for expansion in my opinion.

I assume what you meant about BIE is that it’s only useful if it’s combined with a skill and a sense of direction?

Also seeing that you’re lacking the time and skills to get your idea running, there must be a reason why you don’t hire someone with technical skills or have them as a founder.

martialarts,fceheau,t3_eh46ej,1577620507.0,"When asking this sort of question it’s best to ask yourself what kind of situation am I more likely to encounter

I feel that the majority of street fights are fistfights so because of that I started with boxing. 

It’s also common for people to play dirty so after boxing I would definitely consider a martial art that involves kicking. (Kickboxing/muay Thai). Plus it’ll make you lighter on feet and you’ll be less worried about someone kicking you in the balls.

I’ve also seen a lot of worldstar videos where one ends up getting slammed on the ground. Because of that I would consider something like judo. I’ve done 1 class but still learnt a lot from it will definitely go back to it later.

Lots of fights also end on the ground with someone pummeling the shit out of the other so Brazilian jiu-jitsu is something I would also consider.

Another great option whether you want to do it now or later would be mma. I’ll be doing that after I’ve done a significant amount of all 4 so I can put all of the skills together. 

The judo and bjj clubs are generally nice and will make sure they practice safely, because of your condition just let them know of anything you would be uncomfortable doing.

With the striking martial arts (boxing/kickboxing/Muay Thai) you definitely want to get to a point where you can spar. Just keep in mind it’s easy for people to get carried away so if they’re hitting too hard you have to let them know otherwise they won’t. you don’t want to end up with the occasional mild headaches like me.

fiaustralia,fc7aate,t3_egkpyt,1577501706.0,"I’m 20, studying a bachelor degree in business.
Still living with my parents making as much as a part time worker with a catch.

Here’s my story

When I was 15 I started smoking weed, my grades starting going downhill I was skipping school and eventually dropped out at year 12 to do a Tafe course which I failed in.

Between 18-19 years old I starting doing random jobs not knowing what I wanted to do but always ended up blowing all my money on weed.

At the start of age 19 I went cold turkey on weed and haven’t smoked it since, I wanted to (still do) retire early. I got this full time job at a factory earning about 700 a week, I saved most of it and ended up with 8k after about 4 months.

But during that time I began to hate it more, I was getting so depressed that I was spending all this time for this amount of money in other words I wanted more.

So I quit and started a bridging course for uni which would get me into a bachelor degree for business

After about 4 months I got into my business course, I felt like this is it, this is my ticket to becoming rich!.

I took my first 4 subjects in accounting/business law/statistics/innovation. Which were extremely useful but not worth the amount of debt in my opinion. During that time I needed to keep my savings from decreasing so I tried flipping phones, and I was surprised at how much I made for so little time. Because of this, I no longer look on indeed for what job I could get but instead explore other opportunities to make money my own way. I’m considering flipping cars right now. But the bottom line is I’m always working on my own terms.

The only jobs I would consider is a part time job where I find they have a much better working culture compared to full time. at this point since I’m living with my parents so I have an advantage but I’m only getting started so as long as I progress I’m confident I’ll be fine on my own.

My end goal will always be to retire early. Assuming I still live with my parents, I’d rather spend 5-7.5 hours a week earning 200-300 as opposed to working 38h for 1000pw. Don’t even argue with me on that. I find it more valuable to use the time improving myself financially/emotionally rather than spend all this time for someone else.

When you have more time to grow you’ll notice how much you’ve progressed. You won’t grow quicker spending most of your time at a full time job. 

If I was in your position making that amount of money, I would build a sustainable side hustle which I could eventually grow into my own business and replace my full time job. Yes exhausting to work all day every day, but it only gets easier and easier and your results increase along the way as well. 

It might be unrealistic to retire at 35 on a 85k salary doing what your doing (which is entirely debatable). But would you rather limit the amount you can make to setup your financial future by relying on your employer or would you rather make a sacrifice to see what you can really achieve.

The sum things up though I would keep your job and continue to go for the big 150k job. but use your spare time to grow yourself and see where it takes you, you may end up being so successful that you won’t even need it by the time ur 28"

The truth is, they’re a lot less concerned about you than you think they are. So why worry about what you should say.

I found the best approach to these types of situations is not by focusing on what to say, it’s to focus on listening what they have to say.

The more you listen, the more they’ll engage. There is no perfect thing to say, it’s either you listened to what they said or you didn’t.

Your lack of confidence will fly right out the window when you’re too busy just listening to what they have to say. 

I don’t believe in a natural born speaker, they all started somewhere. The one outstanding trait natural born speakers have is that they never overthink things. Overthinking is a wasted energy that needs to be replaced with action. 

I’m 100% certain if you just learn to listen more in time you’ll think to yourself “why did I even worry about this in the first place” after your first successful stand up comedy session.

Also, don’t be afraid to fail, it’s the key to success.
