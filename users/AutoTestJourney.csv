My dad was always different. 6ft tall, Marine, quiet, but has a deep voice when you speak to him. He comes off as intimidating I guess. But he was always very respectful of his daughters' decisions in men, just letting us know if we need him, he'll be there for us.

However, Dad always liked playing the over protective father and asking this question, just to see who would get rattled. Every one of the boys my older sister brought home delivered the ""Yes sir, No sir"", downcast eyes treatment. Respectful, easily shaken up and then did whatever the hell they wanted anyway once they got away from the house anyway. He never liked them and none of them really turned out well.

I brought home my husband, not even as a boyfriend, but just as a friend at the time. I hadn't even brought home a boy yet, but my dad decided to give him this same treatment when I left the room, because he could see what was going on, even if I didn't. ""What are your intentions with my daughter?"" My future husband declared ""Whatever she intends to do with me, sir."" I could hear Dad laughing from the next room, and I come back to the living room to see my father give my friend that I was about to play videogames a few big slaps on the back. 

They've always gotten along well and bullshit with each other whenever they get together.. My husband might be a small guy, but he's also brave, clever and has a great sense of humor. I guess my dad saw something in him that I just needed to catch up to."

Band directors were cool with it at the time, but the next year, they implemented a rule about no alternative santa hats."

While touring the old high school with his old coach, NFL player ends up meeting his old friend from high school. His friend is a bright, kind, handsome teacher who runs the quiz bowl team at the local high school. He starts out hanging out with teacher, helping him with the kids.

NFL player helps the kids (each with their own weird personalities, of course) and has little hand touches and moments with teacher all the while. He even helps with the fundraising, so the quiz bowl kids can go to the state championship, paying way too much for something made especially by teacher for the fundraising sale. Teacher makes it clear that he appreciates NFL Player's donation but that it doesn't mean anything to him personally. They talk, admit their feelings to each other, everything seems wonderful.

But wait. NFL Player gets an opportunity to get back into the NFL. Now he must decide between staying with his true love, and new found kids, or going back. NFL player doesn't think he can admit his love for teacher to the public, or he'll lose his chance to rejoin the NFL. They have a fight. He goes back. Teacher moves on, soul crushingly sad but strong. The night before he set to play his first game back, he's at a press conference, and NFL player feels rough. It's the same night of the quiz bowl championship. The kids are all backstage, watching the NFL press conference on their phones. Teacher is trying to keep them from getting distracted.

Journalists are asking NFL player pressing questions. At that moment, NFL player shouts his love for Teacher to the world, declaring that he doesn't care if they throw him out, he has everything he's ever wanted at home. NFL player leaves shocked and questioning journalists. Makes it to the Championship location just in time to see the kids win. NFL tearfully reconciles with Teacher. Teacher and NFL player kiss passionately. Movie ends in best gay wedding ending scene ever, with teachers and kids on one side of the aisle and NFL members on the other."

DMAcademy,ff3m4gd,t3_eplt2d,1579543978.0,"How do you deal with players that constantly talk loudly and are just way too loud at the table? 

This past weekend, I ran a one-shot game with 6 people. Overall it wasn't bad, had one guy that just wanted to murder everything, but he saw that the other players were not into it and backed off. 

Another player (LoudPlayer) talked so much during the session, it was difficult for me to narrate what was going on without yelling. I tried to tell LoudPlayer politely at first, using hand signals and asking nicely, to be quieter. After about an hour and a half it devolved to just yelling over LoudPlayer to shut up. He'd be quiet and keep his voice low for about 5 minutes then get loud again. The only time he stayed quiet for longer than 5 minutes is when I threatened to serve punishment in game, and the other players endeavored to keep him quiet. 

During the climax of the game, I'm trying to give my antagonist's final big crazed speech and in the middle of it, LoudPlayer was talking so much, I literally had to turn to him and say ""Shut the hell up, LoudPlayer! We're right at the end!"" Didn't help that it was nearly 1 in the morning and everyone had been drinking but me, so that I could keep a clear head during the game. I had to yell so loudly so many times, my voice was sore the next day (I'm generally a pretty quiet person). 

Everyone still had fun and LoudPlayer didn't seem bothered at all afterward during post game discussion. He's generally a good player, he takes lot of interest in the game, tried to build interesting characters, he just gets so loud during sessions, it gets difficult for me to hear what the other players are saying or to even think while trying to perform DM duties.

What should I try to do to get him to just quieten down a bit? I don't even mind people talking during the game, as long as they keep it quiet, but it was just too much."

This frightened the farmer, so he went inside to get some water and other objects started talking as well. So he ran to the village chief and along the way, other objects kept talking. When he finally told the village chief, sitting on his stool in his home, the chief asked the farmer for proof. The farmer showed him the hoe, which refused to talk. 

The village chief chided the farmer for wasting his time and told him to go back to work. After the farmer left, the chief muttered to himself about how ridiculous the whole story was, and his stool declared ""Well, I've never heard such a crazy story in my life! Imagine, a talking garden hoe!""

Do you like art? Take the time to checkout art books from the library or go to a museum, both great ways to relax while getting mental stimulation, or create your own work of art if you've never gotten a chance to try. 

Nature? Checkout a greenhouse or nature trail, that's both educational and good for the health. 

Sports? Might be a good time to look up the history of games you enjoy, or learn a bit about anatomy, nutritional, and physical health so that you can have better form and fuel.

Video Games? Perfect time to check out how they're are made, what the history of video games is, maybe even take an online coding course for fun.

Learning for the mind is like exercise for the body. It's important to do it often in order to stay healthy.

Bad signs that she won't be responsible enough to care for a small child, let alone a less than a year old baby."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdf24nu,t1_fdf15tx,1578351575.0,"She was a slow warm up for me. I didn't really like her at first in the game either, but I love her in the show and knowing more of what her past was like has made me enjoy her character even more. Unfortunately, I haven't read the books yet, but I'm excited to know more."

They plan a big ball for him and force him to go. That's it. Always much prefered the Ever After prince. It's just as much of a fairy tale as the animated Cinderella, but I love that movie."
AskReddit,fdeuuuv,t1_fder30z,1578347080.0,"Well, she was part of the Order of the Phoenix, I'm sure she brushed up on knowledge in her time there. And she was probably taught some defense magic just in case something happened, like the headquarters getting invaded or someone attacking on of the children."

I was always expecting something. In 1990 IT, sometimes I'd relax a bit and then here's fucking Tim Curry, with that loud laugh and constant mockery."

JUSTNOMIL,fde05cm,t1_fddyago,1578328165.0,"That's what my maternal grandmother was called, Mimi. It's a pretty common term for grandmothers in the American South, along with it's cousin, Mimaw."
AskReddit,fcz5c9v,t1_fcyk0ri,1578093983.0,"Mom was the hometown native, Dad was an outsider. Still got made fun of for not being from there. Always felt like Mom deserved some credit for at least trying to introduce some variety to the local genetic pool."
family,fcz1pw9,t3_ejmx9z,1578091900.0,"Think about going into therapy if you have not yet considered it. It sounds like you have some very complicated emotions surrounding this issue that need discussion in  a professional environment. It's ok to not be totally fine with what's happening. It's complicated and would still be painful, even with the most perfectly supportive family.

Also, now might be the time to do something that reminds you of your mom. Cook a favorite recipe or visit a favorite place that she used to visit. Maybe paint a simple picture in colors you know she'd love or listen to music she used to adore. When I'm missing someone that's passed, sometimes the best thing I can do is read their favorite book or watch their favorite movie, and remember them."
family,fcy0fyn,t3_ejidkg,1578072981.0,"Why do you suspect you are adopted, other than what your classmates are saying? Do you have any pictures of your mother when she was pregnant with you? Just after you were born? Have you ever seen your birth certificate? You can also ask your grandparents about it, they might have some photos they can show you. Looks matter very little when it comes to family. My sister and I look nothing alike but we are biological sisters. I would investigate a bit and see what you find, and draw your conclusions from there."

AskReddit,fcnhjl7,t3_ei0sog,1577811844.0,"Best gift given: Bought my niece a 2DS XL with a Pikachu cover. She's has the old style 2DS for a while now and has really wanted an upgrade, plus she's obsessed with Pokemon. Wish I could have gotten her a Switch, but when I asked her back in November, she said she wanted the 2DS XL, because it'd be easier to carry around, she could play her old games on it and she could get more games for cheaper than the Switch. She's a pretty sharp kid when it comes to money and she's only 12! 

Best gift received: My husband gave me a loungefly Eevee wallet to replace my old one. It's so cute and I absolutely love it."

AskReddit,fcnbu3r,t3_ehxmpw,1577808304.0,"It only comes up around Christmas, but or the last 5 or so years, I've kept a very detailed spreadsheet of all the people on my Christmas list and update it throughout the year. I make notes about their interests, wishes and hobbies throughout the year, and sometimes will make a note or two if someone has really pissed me off or been really sweet. I'll list out all the prices of gifts, total & average out the prices to help with my budget, websites I found the gifts at, various ideas if I'm unsure what to get and I'll color code the list in December: Red for gift not purchased yet, yellow for purchased but not delivered and/or not wrapped yet, and green for wrapped and under the tree. Honestly, it just makes Christmas a lot easier for me.

I've never told my family or friends about it, but I always share it with my husband on a shared document. However, this year for various reasons, I had to push the majority of gift buying duties off on him and I realized, he had never really looked over my list before.

Apparently keeping a detailed spreadsheet about the people in your life is slightly creepy and weird."

I've burned myself too many times thinking ""Oh, he's eating the pizza, it must be cooled off!"" and no, it's not cooled off enough for normal human consumption.

AskReddit,fclhjjh,t1_fckqz2v,1577747943.0,"Shoulders are very attractive. When my husband used to do construction, he developed some very nice arms & shoulders. Super attractive on women too. It think it's because they're a little harder to get for ladies, so when I see a woman with strong shoulders and defined arms I not only know that this is woman that knows what she wants and how to get it, I also know that this woman could crush me and I'd love it."
AskReddit,fclh0fa,t1_fckji59,1577747586.0,I really like strong forearms. Button-up shirts with sleeves rolled up to the elbows and some strong forearms is the equivalent of thigh high stockings for me. Is the person also woodworking or doing some home repair? Very hot look for men. Twice as hot for ladies.
