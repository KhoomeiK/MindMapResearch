They can be cheap, but not always, and even the cheap ones can out-perform spinning platters. SD cards are also arguably far more robust than hard drives.

The size of HDDs and SSDs really comes down to long standing industry standards; they can be made much smaller, but aren't simply because there's no need to when the existing standards tick all the boxes. It should also be noted that solid state drives are rapidly decreasing in price, where spinning platter hard disks have stayed relatively stable in price.

Again, did you actually read my comment? I already acknowledged that it isn't literally economic scarcity by the academic definition of the term. However, what they are doing with third party exclusives is analogous in many ways, and is done for many of the same reasons. It's not literally the same, but it's close enough by most people's understanding (As I said, functionally the same).

>You know Sony / Xbox exclusives are made with their money right? Therefore they want to sell it on their systems, this doesn’t change stock and is only how they sell the product, is a VR only game “artificial scarcity”?

I explicitly said third party. What you are referring to here is first and second party titles. I have no problem with these whatsoever. Also no, a VR only game isn't artificial scarcity at all, although it would be similar if it was exclusive to a specific VR platform, as there is no technical reason to do so.

Third party/platform exclusives are sale restricted when there is no technical reason to do so. It is purely a business decision not unlike literal artificial scarcity of physical products; That is all I'm saying.

I'm not trying to argue what artificial scarcity is, because I'm well aware of that and it really isn't up for debate. There's nothing wrong with drawing comparisons, and I honestly have no idea why you've got your panties in a knot over it..."
