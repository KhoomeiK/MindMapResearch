NintendoSwitch,ffe8kcb,t1_ffdji11,1579839643.0,"I can’t say I agree with that, I love stardew valley but BokuMono (harvest moon/story of seasons) has a very different vibe. They’re similar but it’s hard to compare them, they stand on their own. When Stardew first game out though I loved it so much that I dethroned HM64 (my one true love) for it."
asoiaf,ffe7aus,t1_ffd1jg2,1579838620.0,"Well, Jon is his name. But the fact that his mother wanted him to be Aemon is important, doesn’t make it his true name but it’s still significant. I feel like Jon will be torn between wanting to embrace being Aemon Targaryen, Jon Stark, and Lord Snow."
ac_newhorizons,ffe375r,t1_ffbzymn,1579835512.0,"That’s.. wow. Hahaha. I love how Nintendo blocks curse words in an attempt to keep the game clean, yet the workarounds we all find are so much worse and every villager is wearing a penis shirt. This game is so funny"
ac_newhorizons,ffe2yei,t1_ffdye7c,1579835330.0,"Oh my. Hahaha. The one I showed was certainly one of the more tame ones. The worst are the letters. The damned letters. They show me as a constant reminder, they show my friends who visit, it’s great. And embarrassing."

ac_newhorizons,ff9jiyk,t3_erpaxl,1579714348.0,It’s been the most highly requested feature for many many years! Indeed it is exciting. I just hope that you can change the spot multiple times (maybe with a fee though?) because as my island develops I know I’ll want to change where everything goes.
ac_newhorizons,ff9j2wp,t1_ff5olfe,1579714081.0,What! That’s scary. What’s wrong with people?
ac_newhorizons,ff9ivgs,t3_esa36m,1579713957.0,Fire Emblem! Just kidding! Haha I would love a Mario crossover where we get Koopa villagers. Oh my that would just be so awesome in my opinion.
ac_newhorizons,ff9iqi5,t1_ff84bnu,1579713875.0,I’d fall off my seat if later on Tortimer shows up and becomes Mayor. I just love him so much.
ac_newhorizons,ff9ihk9,t1_ff8c6d9,1579713725.0,"I disliked them as well, and I had a huge rivalry with Walt when he moved into my New Leaf village, (I sent him mean letters and gave him bad catchphrases and clothes and dug holes around his house) but we soon became bff’s and I must have him on my island. It’s funny how it works out that way."

ac_newhorizons,ff9i3j9,t3_es7ctj,1579713493.0,"Okay so I always feel bad saying I hate certain villagers but it’s just true. I do. I like most of the “normal” looking villagers. I really dislike villagers like Stitches or Astrid Big Top, CoCo, Kabuki, Lucky, Peaches, Ribbot, Stinky, Tangy, or Victoria.
(I’m sorry!!!) 

The rest I’m okay with. But for some reason I *always* get multiple of these villagers that I really dislike in my towns! Out of the huge list of villagers I always end up with these fellas. Lol. We all have those that we dread having with us though. Right?? Or am I a jerk. Lol"
ac_newhorizons,ff9hacq,t3_es2sxp,1579712997.0,I honestly just want ALL of the villagers back plus a few new ones. I’d like to think it’s certainly possible. My boy Walt just has to return
ac_newhorizons,ff8b4tz,t3_es64ul,1579671526.0,I’m so exited to see what else has been updated or change with villagers. I also have a feeling we’ll have to get some sort of new villager species for this game. It’s time we got some more variety!! Personally I love Tortimer so I want a bunch of tortoise villagers. They’d be so cute
harvestmoon,ff6zovv,t3_erupzj,1579638200.0,"I hope for a 3D world, definitely with graphics in a mixture between AWL and animal parade. Aging the town growing around you. It would be interesting to have a small village at first and at the end of the game have a large thriving community that’s grown and changed around you over the years. Characters die and new characters move in, rival marriages and children grow up, all of that. It’s my ideal BokuMono game. 

I highly doubt it’ll happen though, it’s so ambitious. But the series needs a shakeup."

ac_newhorizons,ff6ls0d,t3_eru8x3,1579629918.0,What I find the most frustrating is how heavily New Leaf was marketed and New Horizons isn’t getting that treatment.
ac_newhorizons,ff6lnam,t1_ff6lh42,1579629836.0,"From an interview after e3

> “Right from the start, you’ll be able to choose the way you want to look,” Kyogoku said, in an interview with Polygon during E3. “All the facial parts or hairstyles are all gender-free. So you can select from a pool of hairstyles and facial features and then they’re also changeable at any point in the game. So if you feel like a certain way one day, then you can make that change pretty easily.”

ac_newhorizons,ff6l728,t3_ervxgj,1579629561.0,"Indeed. It could give you an added boost for the day and you could work harder or produce better/more resources for the day. Or something! If not just having the little event was such a cute little feature, I’d love it to return."
ac_newhorizons,ff6l31w,t3_erw5j4,1579629494.0,"Shops being on a separate island is already mentioned so I’ll say events and holidays. I really want them to be better and more interesting. More varied, maybe some new holidays as well. I want the game to push you to keep playing for years on one island without wanting to restart after a few months or a year."
ac_newhorizons,ff6knql,t3_erxx1u,1579629239.0,"I love being able to change my appearance at will, but I agree having her back is a must.

And maybe an added shine to your hair that lasts for a couple of days, similar to the tan from the other games. Heck, maybe she has a tanning booth! Lol. I think they could bring in some new features for our favorite poodle for sure"
youtubers,ff6hez4,t1_ff6bog7,1579627260.0,"It all depends on how the comment sells it. I’d be more inclined to click on a “here’s *a* video” rather than “here’s *my* video” just depending on the context though. When it feels like they’re fishing for clicks rather it makes it feel scummy. As a CC though I understand the struggle I just like it to be a bit more organic. Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know."
ac_newhorizons,ff5h8ix,t1_ff5gv7c,1579592763.0,"I feel ya. New Leaf is the best game so far in the series in my opinion but I still prefer playing on a console. I was so bummed out when we didn’t get a Wii U Animal Crossing! But the switch is the best of both worlds, something for everyone :-)"

ac_newhorizons,ff4phdp,t1_ff4ozk5,1579569306.0,"Well you can have it on the big screen and then take it everywhere which is cool. And the regular switch size is honestly perfect. The lite is a bit too small for my tastes, at least for the types of games I play. Worth the extra money in my opinion! But the Animal Crossing exclusive lite systems will look so cute! Who knows if they’ll give us AC themed joycons for the regular switch."
ac_newhorizons,ff4p3ka,t1_ff4isod,1579569036.0,"It really does feel like just yesterday. December was a very busy month. January literally flew by. I can’t believe it’s already the 20th! So, especially if we get an Animal Crossing direct in February time will zip past us."
ac_newhorizons,ff4mh6t,t1_ff4kq0c,1579567184.0,"Definitely don’t get the switch lite! The normal switch is so much better and much more worth it long term. Also Animal Crossing is just meant to be played on a big screen, in my opinion."

ac_newhorizons,ff3txpx,t1_ff3tva1,1579548778.0,Agreed! I think it’ll be one of the prettiest games on the switch

greenday,ff3neb3,t3_erdzs3,1579544772.0,"I like them. Everyone says “they’re not good” as if that’s a straight up fact and not their opinion. Are they the best songs ever recorded? No. But they’re songs I want to dance to and life’s all about having a good time, I don’t need every song I hear to move me to tears and make me feel emo."
NewTubers,ff3mlp6,t3_erehbx,1579544278.0,"I think it’s good to be realistic, but if you get into the mindset that you’re not going to grow and you become content with that then that’s you’re downfall. If you throw everything at it and continue to try hard and push out quality content with a consistency and keep a strong and professional(this one’s important) social media o presence then you will grow. 

Some people just get winded easily and let their failures overcome them. It’s not easy on YouTube but if you make great videos then they’ll get a following. Standing out in a sea of lackluster isn’t impossible. Try new things, strive for the highest quality, make sacrifices and you’ll get there. But knowing it could take time is key.

You mention channels that are around 10 years with 100 subs, look at the content on those channels. 9 times out of 10 they aren’t high 
quality videos and the person making the content has gotten way too comfortable and the videos reflect that. I think part of it is people get embarrassed by low view counts/subs that they just give up and that fire in them dies. But the ones who don’t let it get to them get a following and grow their channel over time. It’s just natural. 

Putting all of your energy into something that seems to get no traction is hard, I know. But sometimes that grind is worth it, and if you aren’t growing at all you need to evaluate what’s wrong with your marketing, presentation and content and do something a bit different. 

Anyway, just my ten cents."

ac_newhorizons,ff1tn4p,t3_er040i,1579485917.0,I want an AC Pro controller/Joy cons. It’s great the switch lite will get an AC theme but I don’t have Switch lite. I prefer to play on a big screen. Also! Plushies are cool. Honestly though anything better than those “badges”.

NintendoSwitch,ff0l8pz,t3_eqldpz,1579469898.0,"Honestly it’s not worth getting on the switch. While it would in theory be the perfect way to play this game, the port is not good and I don’t feel like it will be. I loved the game on PC but it gave me a very bad first impression on initial release, the game felt unfinished and filled with bugs, and they marketed it as a finished product when it should have been early access. Or stayed in early access. I haven’t touched the game for a while now, so I’m not sure how much better it is though from what I’ve read, not a whole lot. 

Anyway, if you have a decent PC I’d just get it there. It’s still worth playing. Just not on the switch."

The outer worlds really failed to impress me, but it’s still a great game and I love it. I hope they make another and make it way better and less like fallout, it was so on the nose that it was so hard to not constantly compare them."

greenday,fewdkjs,t1_fewahop,1579408808.0,"I was 11 when it came out and I went to the video store to buy the album on release day. The guy at the counter (had to have been no older than 19) told me I was too young and he wouldn’t sell it to me. I went home, called my grandma and asked her to grab it for me. She went to the video store, called me and let me know she wouldn’t be buying it. I asked why, she said because of the album artwork. I think the video store guy knew what was up and told her not to get it for me. I still haven’t forgiven that video store guy.

SAME thing happened when I tried to buy GTA Vice City on release. Really pissed young Lemmie off. I turned out pretty okay :) happy ending to this story, I ended up getting the album and GTA Vice City. Can’t remember how, but I listened to American Idiot for the first time with my first crush and we danced. Best. memory. Ever. Remember folks, when you have kids don’t be such dicks. Buy them that explicit record. Buy them that violent video game. They’ll be fine. It’s fine.

greenday,fei23l5,t1_feh6t55,1579128597.0,"Billie has said a lot of things, and he has changed his views on many things over the years like many people do. Just because you say something doesn’t make it set in stone and you have to stick by that for life."
StarWars,fei207m,t1_fehyfwr,1579128539.0,That’s Lucas yeah but just because some of his ideas were implemented doesn’t mean his trilogy would have looked anything like what we got. He strongly disagreed with how they handled this trilogy. And TLJ was actually my favorite of the three films.
StarWars,feh5k2w,t1_feh5fgy,1579109593.0,"I don’t think it’s bad either, I just don’t feel like it should be lumped in with the previous six. Should be it’s own thing, but they marketed it as much as they could as the end of the skywalker saga. The skywalker saga didn’t need another ending IMO"
ac_newhorizons,feh3hm1,t1_feh36q0,1579108373.0,Indeed. And they delayed the game and seem to have made a lot of progress since e3. I don’t doubt this game will have tons of tiny features that are labors of love from the dev team. I can hardly contain my excitement for this game! And I love the community around animal crossing.

And honestly I kinda hope they do, especially post Malone. I’d love that!"
StarWars,feh33ee,t1_feh2q8a,1579108138.0,"Yeah I know but that doesn’t mean it would be anything like what we saw in this new trilogy. Had he wrote and directed it it would have been night and day different for better or for worse. The thing with Lucas that I respect (even though he gets trashed for it) is that he doesn’t play it safe. He has crazy ideas and actually implements them, and sometimes they fail and sometimes they’re genius. Disney played the new trilogy way too safe, there weren’t really any stakes and it all felt very samey and heavily inspire by the OT. I wish they had gone all out and done something completely new and untouched, but it is what it is. Here’s to the old republic."
greenday,feh2sio,t1_fee4a1r,1579107955.0,"They’re pretty pop ish. That’s not a bad thing though, and if Billie felt that way then he wouldn’t have written songs like 21 Guns or Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Or fire ready aim. That’s very pop."

In hindsight it’s kinda gross but, it’s Billie Joe. You don’t get done up all pretty to go to a concert (or you shouldn’t) so expect to get wet and sweaty anyway. I mean, yeah I prefer not getting spat on but it’s not really that gross compared to getting the giant dude next to me’s sweat all over my face. I do the water dance with that too.

I don’t drink hard liquor so I’m not sure on that. But maybe it’s all placebo. I’m not sure. But I definitely feel a difference so whether it’s in my head or not I feel it’s real."
ac_newhorizons,feh193b,t3_eoyt66,1579107029.0,"Indeed! Something to that effect for sure. They really need to up the villagers in this new game. Sure they’re great, but they need much more growth. I wish the villagers got more of a Pokémon treatment and each individual villager had unique traits and things they did, rather than general personality types. I understand that would be an insane amount of work for the dev’s though. But I can wish."
StarWars,feh0pzg,t1_feh0cie,1579106709.0,"I mean yeah don’t get me wrong the OT is OP. It’s the best forever. But I think the prequels get too much hate for what they are. Though I have rose colored glasses on because I grew up watching those in the theatre. Jar Jar also wasn’t that bad, but honestly I don’t take Star Wars too seriously. To me they’re all kinda goofy films, I love them but to me I don’t feel they’re meant to be taken as some serious piece like Shakespeare"
StarWars,fegzirv,t1_fegzec2,1579105981.0,"That’s fair. To me they are great though, I really like what George Lucas did and *he* did it. He wouldn’t have done anything like the sequel trilogy, it would have looked very differently. I like how quirky and silly the prequels are because the OT was pretty quirky too. The sequel trilogy is too serious."
StarWars,fegy1nl,t1_fegvqb1,1579105069.0,"I don’t hate the new trilogy by any means but they certainly are not in the same category as the first six. Chiefly because Lucas made the first six and they’re great watching back to back. Watching the new trilogy after watching the older ones gives me a little whiplash, I don’t know why"
greenday,fegxr8z,t3_ep26bj,1579104887.0,I was listening to the two released singles last night and Oh Yeah came on after fire ready aim and my heart stopped and then it never played. :(
greenday,fegu1ys,t1_fegcjoq,1579102534.0,"I’ve never smoked so I can’t speak to that but I usually buy beer at the venue. If you aren’t of age though I wouldn’t recommend drinking beforehand. Just be you, don’t be nervous. It might be best to be sober to really soak up the experience. The music is the best drug and seeing Green Day live is something else."
asoiaf,fegtw7h,t1_fegcjoe,1579102429.0,"No, it’s like how ASOS/ADWD or whatever gets split into two volumes in some countries because they are too large."
NewTubers,feg64pg,t3_eowa4e,1579078734.0,"Sometimes family or people you know just don’t get it. Don’t let them discourage you, keep making videos and trying your best at making them better each time!"
asoiaf,feg5mw1,t1_feew2xw,1579078046.0,"Actually, the lord of the rings is one novel. It was split into three parts only due to the limited printing capabilities available to Tolkien’s publishers at the time. It was written and completed as one novel and it was not his choice to split it. The Hobbit is a separate novel and not necessarily apart of a “series”, the hobbit is just a story that can stand alone and be considered a prequel."
