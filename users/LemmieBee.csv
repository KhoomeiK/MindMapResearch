NintendoSwitch,ffe8kcb,t1_ffdji11,1579839643.0,"I can‚Äôt say I agree with that, I love stardew valley but BokuMono (harvest moon/story of seasons) has a very different vibe. They‚Äôre similar but it‚Äôs hard to compare them, they stand on their own. When Stardew first game out though I loved it so much that I dethroned HM64 (my one true love) for it."
asoiaf,ffe7aus,t1_ffd1jg2,1579838620.0,"Well, Jon is his name. But the fact that his mother wanted him to be Aemon is important, doesn‚Äôt make it his true name but it‚Äôs still significant. I feel like Jon will be torn between wanting to embrace being Aemon Targaryen, Jon Stark, and Lord Snow."
ac_newhorizons,ffe375r,t1_ffbzymn,1579835512.0,"That‚Äôs.. wow. Hahaha. I love how Nintendo blocks curse words in an attempt to keep the game clean, yet the workarounds we all find are so much worse and every villager is wearing a penis shirt. This game is so funny"
ac_newhorizons,ffe2yei,t1_ffdye7c,1579835330.0,"Oh my. Hahaha. The one I showed was certainly one of the more tame ones. The worst are the letters. The damned letters. They show me as a constant reminder, they show my friends who visit, it‚Äôs great. And embarrassing."

ac_newhorizons,ff9jiyk,t3_erpaxl,1579714348.0,It‚Äôs been the most highly requested feature for many many years! Indeed it is exciting. I just hope that you can change the spot multiple times (maybe with a fee though?) because as my island develops I know I‚Äôll want to change where everything goes.
ac_newhorizons,ff9j2wp,t1_ff5olfe,1579714081.0,What! That‚Äôs scary. What‚Äôs wrong with people?
ac_newhorizons,ff9ivgs,t3_esa36m,1579713957.0,Fire Emblem! Just kidding! Haha I would love a Mario crossover where we get Koopa villagers. Oh my that would just be so awesome in my opinion.
ac_newhorizons,ff9iqi5,t1_ff84bnu,1579713875.0,I‚Äôd fall off my seat if later on Tortimer shows up and becomes Mayor. I just love him so much.
ac_newhorizons,ff9ihk9,t1_ff8c6d9,1579713725.0,"I disliked them as well, and I had a huge rivalry with Walt when he moved into my New Leaf village, (I sent him mean letters and gave him bad catchphrases and clothes and dug holes around his house) but we soon became bff‚Äôs and I must have him on my island. It‚Äôs funny how it works out that way."
ac_newhorizons,ff9iazu,t1_ff8dfi5,1579713617.0,"Indeed, I really want two villagers I‚Äôve never had before. It seems as if I always get the same few though, oddly."
ac_newhorizons,ff9i7w0,t1_ff8rjaw,1579713567.0,I‚Äôve never actually had a single gorilla in my town! I would be glad to have some for a change. I‚Äôm tired of the cows! Lol
ac_newhorizons,ff9i3j9,t3_es7ctj,1579713493.0,"Okay so I always feel bad saying I hate certain villagers but it‚Äôs just true. I do. I like most of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looking villagers. I really dislike villagers like Stitches or Astrid Big Top, CoCo, Kabuki, Lucky, Peaches, Ribbot, Stinky, Tangy, or Victoria.
(I‚Äôm sorry!!!) 

The rest I‚Äôm okay with. But for some reason I *always* get multiple of these villagers that I really dislike in my towns! Out of the huge list of villagers I always end up with these fellas. Lol. We all have those that we dread having with us though. Right?? Or am I a jerk. Lol"
ac_newhorizons,ff9hacq,t3_es2sxp,1579712997.0,I honestly just want ALL of the villagers back plus a few new ones. I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs certainly possible. My boy Walt just has to return
ac_newhorizons,ff8b4tz,t3_es64ul,1579671526.0,I‚Äôm so exited to see what else has been updated or change with villagers. I also have a feeling we‚Äôll have to get some sort of new villager species for this game. It‚Äôs time we got some more variety!! Personally I love Tortimer so I want a bunch of tortoise villagers. They‚Äôd be so cute
harvestmoon,ff6zovv,t3_erupzj,1579638200.0,"I hope for a 3D world, definitely with graphics in a mixture between AWL and animal parade. Aging the town growing around you. It would be interesting to have a small village at first and at the end of the game have a large thriving community that‚Äôs grown and changed around you over the years. Characters die and new characters move in, rival marriages and children grow up, all of that. It‚Äôs my ideal BokuMono game. 

I highly doubt it‚Äôll happen though, it‚Äôs so ambitious. But the series needs a shakeup."

ac_newhorizons,ff6lnam,t1_ff6lh42,1579629836.0,"From an interview after e3

> ‚ÄúRight from the start, you‚Äôll be able to choose the way you want to look,‚Äù Kyogoku said, in an interview with Polygon during E3. ‚ÄúAll the facial parts or hairstyles are all gender-free. So you can select from a pool of hairstyles and facial features and then they‚Äôre also changeable at any point in the game. So if you feel like a certain way one day, then you can make that change pretty easily.‚Äù

ac_newhorizons,ff6l728,t3_ervxgj,1579629561.0,"Indeed. It could give you an added boost for the day and you could work harder or produce better/more resources for the day. Or something! If not just having the little event was such a cute little feature, I‚Äôd love it to return."
ac_newhorizons,ff6l31w,t3_erw5j4,1579629494.0,"Shops being on a separate island is already mentioned so I‚Äôll say events and holidays. I really want them to be better and more interesting. More varied, maybe some new holidays as well. I want the game to push you to keep playing for years on one island without wanting to restart after a few months or a year."
ac_newhorizons,ff6knql,t3_erxx1u,1579629239.0,"I love being able to change my appearance at will, but I agree having her back is a must.

And maybe an added shine to your hair that lasts for a couple of days, similar to the tan from the other games. Heck, maybe she has a tanning booth! Lol. I think they could bring in some new features for our favorite poodle for sure"
youtubers,ff6hez4,t1_ff6bog7,1579627260.0,"It all depends on how the comment sells it. I‚Äôd be more inclined to click on a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs *a* video‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhere‚Äôs *my* video‚Äù just depending on the context though. When it feels like they‚Äôre fishing for clicks rather it makes it feel scummy. As a CC though I understand the struggle I just like it to be a bit more organic. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, I don‚Äôt know."
ac_newhorizons,ff5h8ix,t1_ff5gv7c,1579592763.0,"I feel ya. New Leaf is the best game so far in the series in my opinion but I still prefer playing on a console. I was so bummed out when we didn‚Äôt get a Wii U Animal Crossing! But the switch is the best of both worlds, something for everyone :-)"
ac_newhorizons,ff4yw61,t1_ff4x91w,1579575782.0,"I made this so it‚Äôs hypocritical of me to say but same, the wait is so hard. Though if you think about it this way, it first got announced in August 2018 right? Or somewhere close to there? So the majority of the wait is over!"
youtubers,ff4tynf,t1_ff4ilhc,1579572387.0," Nah, when I see plugs like that I never click the link. If the video was actually worth watching they wouldn‚Äôt be so desperate. It would already have views"
ac_newhorizons,ff4phdp,t1_ff4ozk5,1579569306.0,"Well you can have it on the big screen and then take it everywhere which is cool. And the regular switch size is honestly perfect. The lite is a bit too small for my tastes, at least for the types of games I play. Worth the extra money in my opinion! But the Animal Crossing exclusive lite systems will look so cute! Who knows if they‚Äôll give us AC themed joycons for the regular switch."
ac_newhorizons,ff4p3ka,t1_ff4isod,1579569036.0,"It really does feel like just yesterday. December was a very busy month. January literally flew by. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already the 20th! So, especially if we get an Animal Crossing direct in February time will zip past us."
ac_newhorizons,ff4mh6t,t1_ff4kq0c,1579567184.0,"Definitely don‚Äôt get the switch lite! The normal switch is so much better and much more worth it long term. Also Animal Crossing is just meant to be played on a big screen, in my opinion."

greenday,ff3neb3,t3_erdzs3,1579544772.0,"I like them. Everyone says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not good‚Äù as if that‚Äôs a straight up fact and not their opinion. Are they the best songs ever recorded? No. But they‚Äôre songs I want to dance to and life‚Äôs all about having a good time, I don‚Äôt need every song I hear to move me to tears and make me feel emo."
NewTubers,ff3mlp6,t3_erehbx,1579544278.0,"I think it‚Äôs good to be realistic, but if you get into the mindset that you‚Äôre not going to grow and you become content with that then that‚Äôs you‚Äôre downfall. If you throw everything at it and continue to try hard and push out quality content with a consistency and keep a strong and professional(this one‚Äôs important) social media o presence then you will grow. 

Some people just get winded easily and let their failures overcome them. It‚Äôs not easy on YouTube but if you make great videos then they‚Äôll get a following. Standing out in a sea of lackluster isn‚Äôt impossible. Try new things, strive for the highest quality, make sacrifices and you‚Äôll get there. But knowing it could take time is key.

You mention channels that are around 10 years with 100 subs, look at the content on those channels. 9 times out of 10 they aren‚Äôt high 
quality videos and the person making the content has gotten way too comfortable and the videos reflect that. I think part of it is people get embarrassed by low view counts/subs that they just give up and that fire in them dies. But the ones who don‚Äôt let it get to them get a following and grow their channel over time. It‚Äôs just natural. 

Putting all of your energy into something that seems to get no traction is hard, I know. But sometimes that grind is worth it, and if you aren‚Äôt growing at all you need to evaluate what‚Äôs wrong with your marketing, presentation and content and do something a bit different. 

Anyway, just my ten cents."

ac_newhorizons,ff1tn4p,t3_er040i,1579485917.0,I want an AC Pro controller/Joy cons. It‚Äôs great the switch lite will get an AC theme but I don‚Äôt have Switch lite. I prefer to play on a big screen. Also! Plushies are cool. Honestly though anything better than those ‚Äúbadges‚Äù.

NintendoSwitch,ff0l8pz,t3_eqldpz,1579469898.0,"Honestly it‚Äôs not worth getting on the switch. While it would in theory be the perfect way to play this game, the port is not good and I don‚Äôt feel like it will be. I loved the game on PC but it gave me a very bad first impression on initial release, the game felt unfinished and filled with bugs, and they marketed it as a finished product when it should have been early access. Or stayed in early access. I haven‚Äôt touched the game for a while now, so I‚Äôm not sure how much better it is though from what I‚Äôve read, not a whole lot. 

Anyway, if you have a decent PC I‚Äôd just get it there. It‚Äôs still worth playing. Just not on the switch."

greenday,fewdkjs,t1_fewahop,1579408808.0,"I was 11 when it came out and I went to the video store to buy the album on release day. The guy at the counter (had to have been no older than 19) told me I was too young and he wouldn‚Äôt sell it to me. I went home, called my grandma and asked her to grab it for me. She went to the video store, called me and let me know she wouldn‚Äôt be buying it. I asked why, she said because of the album artwork. I think the video store guy knew what was up and told her not to get it for me. I still haven‚Äôt forgiven that video store guy.

SAME thing happened when I tried to buy GTA Vice City on release. Really pissed young Lemmie off. I turned out pretty okay :) happy ending to this story, I ended up getting the album and GTA Vice City. Can‚Äôt remember how, but I listened to American Idiot for the first time with my first crush and we danced. Best. memory. Ever. Remember folks, when you have kids don‚Äôt be such dicks. Buy them that explicit record. Buy them that violent video game. They‚Äôll be fine. It‚Äôs fine.

greenday,fei23l5,t1_feh6t55,1579128597.0,"Billie has said a lot of things, and he has changed his views on many things over the years like many people do. Just because you say something doesn‚Äôt make it set in stone and you have to stick by that for life."
StarWars,fei207m,t1_fehyfwr,1579128539.0,That‚Äôs Lucas yeah but just because some of his ideas were implemented doesn‚Äôt mean his trilogy would have looked anything like what we got. He strongly disagreed with how they handled this trilogy. And TLJ was actually my favorite of the three films.
StarWars,feh5k2w,t1_feh5fgy,1579109593.0,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad either, I just don‚Äôt feel like it should be lumped in with the previous six. Should be it‚Äôs own thing, but they marketed it as much as they could as the end of the skywalker saga. The skywalker saga didn‚Äôt need another ending IMO"
ac_newhorizons,feh3hm1,t1_feh36q0,1579108373.0,Indeed. And they delayed the game and seem to have made a lot of progress since e3.

This game series is seriously such a light in my life!
greenday,feh38t8,t1_feh339n,1579108230.0,"I think signs are pointing to this Tyla guy to feature on this song though.

StarWars,feh33ee,t1_feh2q8a,1579108138.0,"Yeah I know but that doesn‚Äôt mean it would be anything like what we saw in this new trilogy. Had he wrote and directed it it would have been night and day different for better or for worse. The thing with Lucas that I respect (even though he gets trashed for it) is that he doesn‚Äôt play it safe. He has crazy ideas and actually implements them, and sometimes they fail and sometimes they‚Äôre genius. Disney played the new trilogy way too safe, there weren‚Äôt really any stakes and it all felt very samey and heavily inspire by the OT. I wish they had gone all out and done something completely new and untouched, but it is what it is. Here‚Äôs to the old republic."

greenday,feh2hpw,t3_ep0xrf,1579107772.0,"He took a huge swing of Fuji water at the longshot show in 2018 and spit it all over me and the people around me. I was doing the water dance. In hindsight it‚Äôs kinda gross but, it‚Äôs Billie Joe. You don‚Äôt get done up all pretty to go to a concert (or you shouldn‚Äôt) so expect to get wet and sweaty anyway. I mean, yeah I prefer not getting spat on but it‚Äôs not really that gross compared to getting the giant dude next to me‚Äôs sweat all over my face. I do the water dance with that too. It‚Äôs part of being at a concert. Especially a small venue."
greenday,feh271d,t1_fegxu6i,1579107596.0,I‚Äôm excited/nervous to hear it.
IsItBullshit,feh1h8v,t3_eoxtxt,1579107168.0,"I‚Äôve found different beers give me a different buzz, and wine certainly makes me feel different than beer. I don‚Äôt drink hard liquor so I‚Äôm not sure on that. But maybe it‚Äôs all placebo. I‚Äôm not sure. But I definitely feel a difference so whether it‚Äôs in my head or not I feel it‚Äôs real."
ac_newhorizons,feh193b,t3_eoyt66,1579107029.0,"Indeed! Something to that effect for sure. They really need to up the villagers in this new game. Sure they‚Äôre great, but they need much more growth. I wish the villagers got more of a Pok√©mon treatment and each individual villager had unique traits and things they did, rather than general personality types. I understand that would be an insane amount of work for the dev‚Äôs though. But I can wish."
StarWars,feh0pzg,t1_feh0cie,1579106709.0,"I mean yeah don‚Äôt get me wrong the OT is OP. It‚Äôs the best forever. But I think the prequels get too much hate for what they are. Though I have rose colored glasses on because I grew up watching those in the theatre. Jar Jar also wasn‚Äôt that bad, but honestly I don‚Äôt take Star Wars too seriously. To me they‚Äôre all kinda goofy films, I love them but to me I don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre meant to be taken as some serious piece like Shakespeare"
StarWars,fegzirv,t1_fegzec2,1579105981.0,"That‚Äôs fair. To me they are great though, I really like what George Lucas did and *he* did it. He wouldn‚Äôt have done anything like the sequel trilogy, it would have looked very differently. I like how quirky and silly the prequels are because the OT was pretty quirky too. The sequel trilogy is too serious."
StarWars,fegy1nl,t1_fegvqb1,1579105069.0,"I don‚Äôt hate the new trilogy by any means but they certainly are not in the same category as the first six. Chiefly because Lucas made the first six and they‚Äôre great watching back to back. Watching the new trilogy after watching the older ones gives me a little whiplash, I don‚Äôt know why"
greenday,fegxr8z,t3_ep26bj,1579104887.0,I was listening to the two released singles last night and Oh Yeah came on after fire ready aim and my heart stopped and then it never played. :(
greenday,fegu1ys,t1_fegcjoq,1579102534.0,"I‚Äôve never smoked so I can‚Äôt speak to that but I usually buy beer at the venue. If you aren‚Äôt of age though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend drinking beforehand. Just be you, don‚Äôt be nervous. It might be best to be sober to really soak up the experience. The music is the best drug and seeing Green Day live is something else."
asoiaf,fegtw7h,t1_fegcjoe,1579102429.0,"No, it‚Äôs like how ASOS/ADWD or whatever gets split into two volumes in some countries because they are too large."
NewTubers,feg64pg,t3_eowa4e,1579078734.0,"Sometimes family or people you know just don‚Äôt get it. Don‚Äôt let them discourage you, keep making videos and trying your best at making them better each time!"
asoiaf,feg5mw1,t1_feew2xw,1579078046.0,"Actually, the lord of the rings is one novel. It was split into three parts only due to the limited printing capabilities available to Tolkien‚Äôs publishers at the time. It was written and completed as one novel and it was not his choice to split it. The Hobbit is a separate novel and not necessarily apart of a ‚Äúseries‚Äù, the hobbit is just a story that can stand alone and be considered a prequel."
