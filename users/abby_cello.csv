booksuggestions,fef1268,t1_feegbwb,1579045673.0,"I guess because there's so many different points of view going on, it's taking a long time for the story to move forward. Also, the fact that each pov is in a different part of the timeline makes things confusing. And the timeline isn't clear enough. I didn't even realize that they were taking place at different times until maybe 150 pages in."

AskReddit,fdlrig5,t3_eluaxn,1578530772.0,"When I was around 8 or 9, for some reason I had decided to sleep in a sleeping bag on my bedroom floor. I liked to cuddle with my cat before bed, so I called his name. My cat came in from outside, ran up to me, and promptly vomited onto my sleeping bag with me in it.

RIP Oreo, still the best cat ever"

dogs,fdgniew,t3_el4u0u,1578403187.0,"When I was about 16, I was walking my dog (pug/beagle mix) through the neighborhood, and another dog literally jumped the fence, ran up to us on the sidewalk, and started attacking my dog. Mine just took it and cried while I screamed and kicked the other dog until the owner came out and was able to drag it away. Luckily the owner was really nice and invited me inside, and she helped me check over my dog. Luckily he only had a torn ear and the vet was able to glue it back together. The owner paid for the vet fees and she said she would get rid of the dog. I know how scary it is."

Hair,fc98esb,t3_ego95i,1577548675.0,"Judging by how many times you've posted this, you seem really worried about your hairline in the last few days. I would say try to ignore it for a while and check how it's doing 6 months or a year from now. When you're worried enough you'll overanalyze and create some sort of health problem in your mind."
