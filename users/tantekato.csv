They can't see what you have or what you went through don't they? Is there a meeting cafe or something like a community in your neighborhood where you can talk with people who went to the same or similar events. 

Or group therapy? 
You can learn a lot from the others how to handle the illness and what happened in the past and know there are lots of other people struggling with a mental illness. 

What others think of you is not contributing to your recovery and building a new life. 
I hope your family will support you and remember that it is a little difficult for everyone. 
If you are open and transparent about it and talk about it when they ask, than they can try to understand you. 

One of my family members had a psychosis and I did not understand it at all. The more he talked about it the better I could understand him. I can't look in his head, so if he doesn't tell me what's on his mind, I can't help him.
