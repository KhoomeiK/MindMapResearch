dogs,fej1xea,t3_ep5jpm,1579153919.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry about this. I recently went through a very similar thing with my dog of 9 years (I‚Äôm only 12) I think I may be late with this comment but from my experience, I think that it is definitely time. I know it‚Äôs tough but try not to blame anybody, especially yourself. It is not your fault and it‚Äôs the right choice. My dog could barely walk, she peed all over the house and herself. My mom took her to the vet and they said 6 days tops. We wanted to stay with her as long as we could. But after the first night she was refusing to eat or drink, she howled, screeched, and cried the entire night and even my neighbors said they heard it. We knew it was time, so we took her in the next day and put her down. It was so, so hard, but it had to be done. I‚Äôm so sorry, I know this probably made you sad, but you need to know that your going to get through this. It‚Äôs going to hurt for a little, maybe even a long time, my story was just over a month ago and I still cry when I think about it, it‚Äôs going to be very very hard for a while but eventually, it will be easier to keep your tears under wraps. Believe me, this does not mean that you will miss them any less AT ALL! But you will get through this. I don‚Äôt know you, but I think you can be strong. Try to connect with family and friends, if you are religious then try to get more in touch with that, if you really need to talk, then you can message me, or some other supportive people in the comment section, just know it will be hard but even if you don‚Äôt think it you WILL get through this, alone or with others. Try to have the best day you can ASAP maybe take just a few days off and focus on yourself, but don‚Äôt be alone or in silence to long, that will just make it worse. I‚Äôm not a professional by Far, but if you really need help, I can be there for you. Message me when your feeling better."
