I bought it last year so not sure on the maintenance before me but I changed the CVT fluid as soon as I got it and the old fluid was still a pretty vibrant red so I'm guessing the previous owner kept up with the fluid changes.

I just change trans fluid every 60k miles in all my cars."

Mine specifically has 207k, and there are several cases of Insights getting into the half millions. Granted they didn't sell much, but it seems like Honda figured out CVTs pretty early on. Perhaps Nissan could learn a thing of two lol."

I'm not at all trying to protect male abusers or obscure the truth about statistics. Just offering my insight."
facepalm,ff4aej5,t1_ff49te9,1579559041.0,"The double standard isn't about under-reporting sexual abuse by female teachers, it's that it's a startlingly common mindset that abuse by female teachers isn't abuse at all, and that male victims should feel fortunate for the opportunity.

I will admit I grew up thinking that same way, and I only realized how wrong it was when I met a victim in highschool. He's a close friend of mine now and even at the time he 'enjoyed' the experience and bragging rights. Nowadays though it's clear that he was horribly affected by the incidents and has long-lasting mental health issues from them. He hasn't been able to keep a relationship going for more than a year and has had periods of suicidal tendencies because of it. Truly a tragic thing.

Anyhow, regardless of percentages of male and female abusers is, I think it's important that people understand abuse is abuse, no matter who the perpetrator is.

Hope I made that clear. Bit of a word salad, it is."

Then again, I don't have the car in front of me and can't say for sure. I'm just basing it off of my experiences with 10+year old Nissans. If you want to be absolutely sure whether something is wrong or not, take it to a mechanic you trust."

Officers responded to a home near Warm Springs Road and the 215 Beltway just before 1 a.m. on Jan. 1 where a resident captured an in-progress kidnapping on their homeÂ surveillance system, according to a media release.

When police viewed the video, they saw a woman running from a white sedan. The video showed the woman running to a house and screaming for help.Â  As the woman was banging on the house's front door, a man runs and begins beating on the woman before dragging her into the vehicle.

LVMPD confirmed they took Darnell Rodgers, 23, into custody around 3 a.m. Jan. 2 near the 4400 block of Sirus Avnue, near Arville Street north of Desert Inn Road.

Rodgers faces charges of kidnapping and domestic battery, according to police. According to jail records, Rodgers' first court appearance was set for Jan. 3.

Police said the woman was found safe."
