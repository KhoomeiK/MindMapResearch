Edit: More details of my commute. I live in San Diego, so I don't have cold winters to worry about. But it does get chilly enough to need the heater. I put the thermostat at 68. I typically drive 65-70 mph, plus my commute hours are off rush, so I don't usually have traffic. About 60 miles round trip total.

To work is more uphill. Since I'm starting the car with a cold engine and interior I tend to get worse mpg in this direction. Lowest of 43 last week. Today was 46, but I have gotten over 50. Normal range is 45-50.

Homewards has downhill, plus the car hasn't been sitting all night. I've ranged between 48-57."

ARR is a special case, since they hadn't gotten the formula right yet. They're going to streamline it sometime this year, but that's still months ahead.
