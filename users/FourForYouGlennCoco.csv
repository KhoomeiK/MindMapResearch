>the country is cleaner than it's ever been

Curious what you're basing this on, when the Trump admin just [removed limits on use of polluting chemicals near waterways](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/climate/trump-administration-rolls-back-clean-water-protections.html), adding to the long list of [anti-pollution rules he's rolled back](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html).

&#x200B;

>the detainment centers at the border were instituted before Trump was even thinking about running

I didn't accuse Trump of building the detention centers, I said that his administration separated children from their parents and kept them in concentration camps. Previous administrations only separated children from their parents in edge cases, e.g. when there was some doubt about the relationship between parent and child. Under Trump it was a stated policy to separate families, and the children were kept in appalling conditions, in some cases not being able to bathe.

&#x200B;

>Trump doesn't accept a paycheck

Why would he need to? Unlike every other president, he hasn't divested from his businesses, and he's also spent 333 days of his presidency so far at his own properties. Every time he does, the American people has to spend money on his travel and lodging for his massive security detail. Yes, we've had to do that for past presidents too, but the difference is that Trump owns the hotel he's staying at so he's funneling the American taxpayer's money into his own pocket. Not to mention all the foreign dignitaries he pressures to spend money at his hotels, or the fact that he sells access to voters via Mar-a-Lago memberships.

If Trump did what every other president in history has done and divested from his businesses, this wouldn't be an issue. But this is a dude who literally admitted to defrauding a charity, so I'm not holding my breath for him to do the right thing.

He also made a campaign promise to release his tax returns, which would shed some light on all this. Why don't you think he's willing to do it? What's he hiding?

&#x200B;

>every other president in history has gone on golf trips and vacations

This is a problem of degree, not kind. I'm not opposed to a president playing golf. I am opposed to a president spending 1 out of 5 days last year at a golf club, that's just lazy. He's been caught lying to the American people too, putting out fake schedules where he claims to be doing other things but is actually golfing. He knows his laziness is a problem, and that's why he doesn't want you and me to know about it.

&#x200B;

>this is the first presidency you ever paid attention to

Nope. I paid close attention to Obama. I supported many of his policies and opposed many others, particularly his use of drone strikes on civilians.

&#x200B;

>let me guess you flipped out over the net neutrality thing too right?

Not really. It might turn out fine, there might be some serious downside risk, but time will tell. Nowhere close to my #1 issue.

No. Government shutdowns have become sadly routine at this point in American politics. It’s a problem but not a Trump-specific problem."

> Pretty sure public schooling is a Democrat thing 

Cool, so not only are you making a joke about children being kept in concentration camps, not even being allowed to bathe in some cases, now you’re against funding public schools? Very cool!

I’m scared to ask, but if you’re really against public schools, how are we supposed to maintain our workforce and train the next generation? What are kids who are born poor supposed to do — just not learn how to read?

> The POTUS literally tweets dozens of times a day about everything he's doing or thinking.

He sure does. What he doesn’t do is respond to legally issued congressional subpoenas or release his tax returns, which he promised to do during the campaign. Tweets are not a substitute for cooperation with the legislative branch. His administration has also completely stopped doing press briefings.

You didn’t respond to the golf point, so I’m just going to assume you’re fine with the fact that Trump spent 1 in 5 days last year at a golf club, and 333 days of his presidency at his own properties. Because Trump hasn’t divested the way every previous president has, he’s taking millions of dollars in taxpayer money — our money — and giving it to himself through those properties. I want a president who works for the people, not a lazy president who golfs all day and makes the American people pick up the tab."

bloodborne,febjjcj,t1_feasdlm,1578959468.0,">overthinking is just a part of my life

I have an anxiety disorder so I definitely feel you! One thing I appreciated about Bloodborne was that it gave me a means to practice being in the moment and not overthinking. The only way I could beat the bosses was by sort of letting go of the idea of winning in the moment; I would traverse the fog telling myself ""I'm just going to have fun and try to learn something new"" and not thinking about winning or losing. And if I could keep myself from getting frustrated, I usually would be able to win after a few tries; if I let myself start beating myself up then I'd lose every time.

So for me the game became a fun, low-stakes way for me to practice dealing with performance anxiety. But I could also see it giving someone a serious case of performance anxiety too, and just not being fun. The first time I tried to play the game I actually quit it for 1.5 years after getting stuck on Vicar Amelia; I only picked it back up because I brought my PS4 home for Thanksgiving and forgot to pack any other games.

But yeah, all this to say that I agree with you that the design decisions in this game are intentional, but that doesn't mean that they work for everyone."

I think you're right. I also found this incredibly frustrating in the early to mid game (in the later game, you tend to have a big blood vial surplus, and also there are some areas where you can grind enough echoes to buy dozens in a few minutes). But resources like fire and bolt paper always remain pretty expensive. I assumed that the idea was to give boss fights real stakes; they want the player to really feel like they have something to lose, and to feel genuine fear. YYMV on whether that's a fun game mechanic or a huge frustration. And on that note:

>I tend to be a lot better at Bloodborne when mildly buzzed, for some reason.

I also agree with this completely. I think it's the same reason that many people find it easier to speak a second language when they're buzzed; because it stops you from overthinking. 

Once I settled into a groove with the game I found I could get into that zen state without being buzzed, FWIW. But it was an adjustment."
