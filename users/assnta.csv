No shit, your books don't mention the sexual slavery.

Also, stay ignorant. We don't want you to learn history so you won't anticipate the horrors that could occur on your people when a bigger opponent decides to invade you one day and hires your women for sexual services (wink wink). We don't want you to know the signs of sexual slavery, so when it happens to your people, you'll just stand there like a dumb idiot. Please, I beg you, stay ignorant."

Also, the founders are vets. They know their shit. I don't know if PETA has a kennel even, so it is hard to trust, plus with the news that has come out, we can only hope they are doing something and not abusing the crisis.

Edit: If you are reading this far, another organization on the ground and within disaster-hit areas is Guardians of the Fur. Just heard from a friend."

Also, my response is not an assumption. I'm stating their track record. It's not an assumption; I am repeating an observation made from the past by many people. I'm not telling you what I think; I'm telling you what many people have reported and observed about PETA. Your comprehension is so low.

You sound like a butthurt PETA member who is pissed because your plans for fund raising have been foiled -- that's an assumption."
Philippines,feb83o4,t1_fe94el4,1578956254.0,"Sadly, PETA has a track record of using calamities for PR. We don't know if their intentions are real this time or if they intend to do the same thing they've always done in times of crisis. Chances are they don't have the resources to go there or they know the government will not permit them to go closer to where most of the ashfall is or where the horses are, but here they are using the horses in their landing page for donations.

That's what's hard about PETA. They'll feature the horses in peril on their social media, pero hanggang evacuation centers, far from the horses lang pala sila and we don't know the level of assistance pa. Other veterinarians are already on the ground in evacuation centers like PPBCC, but they're not so loud about asking for money"

Using 'soon enough' is a bit of a stretch; I should probably give it a few more decades of exposure to Mandarin. In Asia, many schools are teaching students Mandarin and more shows from the Mainland are being shown on local channels. So that's fair, China just needs more time and strategizing."
todayilearned,fdq6lmr,t1_fdq66tw,1578657107.0,"Yeah, that's fair, and maybe not soon enough, but give it several years, even decades, of exposure. China has to invest in more cultural programs, in Hollywood, and in other media to extend their soft power."

But soon enough, when people realize they'll benefit more, financially, from Mandarin, they'll switch to that too.

Edit: ""Soon enough"" is not the proper timeline. Read responses below. I'd probably give them a few more decades. Changes are happening in Asia, slowly but surely."

He clearly knows they haven't paid anything: "" We had only paid for her joining and hadn't paid a single penny since. ""

Which means, if the sister is asking them for money to pay for her tuition, it's because HER FAMILY HASN'T PAID A SINGLE PENNY SINCE.
