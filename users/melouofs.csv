AskReddit,ff52tco,t3_erovse,1579578687.0,"I honestly cannot relate to wanting to kill myself because I’m 50, and no matter what, there’s an end to everything and I can put up with a lot just knowing it’s only temporary. I’ve suffered a couple of bouts of depression, was raised in crappy circumstances, etc, and nothing has lasted like that, so it is comforting to know that whatever shit you’re in, it’s not permanent. See a professional and get your head right, and then go make your life your own."
AskReddit,ff52ay7,t3_erow8r,1579578297.0,"Time and togetherness. I’m not sure whether you made the bad impression or if another person made a bad impression on you...maybe the person was having a bad day-we all feel off now and again. If you get the chance to spend more time with that person, you can find out whether your first impression was correct or whether they deserve another chance."

cats,ff31az5,t3_erdfv4,1579531030.0,"We’ve been varying what we feed the cats because of age and puking issues. Our cats cannot handle food just being left out-our one girl will eat until she pukes, then look for more. We currently feed them each a quarter cup scoop  of dry food twice a day. We’ve always also fed them each a half can of Fancy Feast but two of the three puked a lot, so I’m trying dry only to see what happens. I’ve had many conversations with our vet about this-lots of the advice is trial and error for your particular cats. Consult the bag of food and go from there."

facepalm,fees0eh,t3_eohaxc,1579039964.0,"That’s horrible. I’ve seen articles stating MM is being treated unfairly in the press, and if this is any indication, it’s no wonder they’re pulling away from royal life."
interestingasfuck,fdojsmi,t3_em9out,1578606574.0,It deserves a gold tooth!
facepalm,fdle00n,t3_elun93,1578521996.0,"I thought these guys  claimed god made it all, so wouldn’t he have made Adam, Eve AND Steve?-according to their own myth"
facepalm,fdld1lu,t3_elwlyh,1578521419.0,"The other part of that business transaction posing as a marriage is this: does that guy think she’d give him the time of day if he was a janitor or teacher or something? He’s using his status to get a woman who is very attractive and she’s using her good looks to get a guy with money—shallow all around, so don’t go acting like it’s all on the woman."
interestingasfuck,fdfp9yw,t3_el1cam,1578366953.0,So very sad. This is climate change in action.

AskReddit,fc5arel,t3_eg4oq3,1577451379.0,"We sell all the typical stuff, but it has to be ordered 10 days in advance, and we’re located at the dead end of a one-way street with no turn around, so you have to back up out of the street."
oddlysatisfying,fbp67cx,t3_ee25gq,1577017919.0,That’s incredible! I love it
