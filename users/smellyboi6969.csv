Those companies and their jobs would not benefit our society at all in the US. God bless America and no place else!"
LifeProTips,fej2scn,t1_feicasp,1579154764.0,"When you watch Youtube videos for example, unless you have the premium version you're going to see ads. Same go for any free streaming service. I don't get pop up ads because I block those but there are plenty of advertisements you can't block. If you know how to block ads on youtube or Pandora without paying please let me know.

Yes I know I am the product. I get that they are an advertising agency making money off of me. But again... If it helps marketers tailor content specifically to me why is that a bad thing? I'd rather see ads for relevant content than non relevant content. I'm going to get ads regardless so why not get ads that are useful ?

We covered the news and political side of this so explain why I should care why Google tracks my searches outside of that spectrum? I actually love the fact that when I'm talking with a friend about going somewhere or looking up a destination on the internet and when I click on Google maps and start to type in the location name, it already knows where I'm trying to go and pre fills it. Saves me some time and effort. Little things like that make my life a little easier so if there is a cost to me that I'm not getting I'd love to understand it."
LifeProTips,fei2tr5,t1_fehzpnz,1579129045.0,"Certainly useful when you're using Google for news or political searches. Would not want to have my results be biased and therefore in a bubble. But I also don't see the harm when it comes to product, services, videos, etc that Google would tailor pick for me. I'd prefer that content to be tailored to me. If I'm getting married, it'd be nice to see ads and content relevant to this rather than random ads for tampons or whatever. I use separate apps for news and political stuff that I choose because they are relatively unbiased but have no problem with Google tracking the other stuff. Maybe I'm missing something, since it seems the majority of Reddit is adamantly opposed to any tracking."
worldnews,feeed8p,t1_fdzqi80,1579032021.0,"A tax on fossil fuel companies is passed on to consumers. Their monthly energy bill goes up. 
I don't disagree that we should be funding alternative energy research and investing heavily in it. But if you suddenly ratchet up energy prices, it will cause outrage and disproportionally affect lower income people who are living paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an immediate shock to the system it has to be slight and gradual."
worldnews,fdzegk3,t1_fdz2w6w,1578789433.0,Politically it's suicide to go back to your constitutants and say that their energy bills are going to go up hundreds of dollars a month and there will be energy shortages while we look for funding to construct renewable energy plants (whatever they may be). The idea that we can just flip a switch and turn off fossil fuel energy is completely ignorant to reality. Easy for a child to propose. Stupid for an adult to support. It will take many decades if not centuries to wane society off fossil fuels. That's just the nature of the world.
GetMotivated,fdyqk6h,t1_fc62i80,1578782536.0,Sounds like you are in the wrong job then. If the prospect of moving up is not enticing and your current job only motivates you to do the bare minimum then you need a change of career. Never too late to try something new!
GetMotivated,fdfrze1,t1_fcyo45m,1578368752.0,Does it matter?
GetMotivated,fcxtx7s,t3_eje9e0,1578070407.0,"ITT: kids projecting their own insecurities and excuses for not being where they want to be in life.

This post is not saying that anyone can become a high paid actor. It is simply showing an example of someone who went through adversity and made their situation better. This could be true for anyone with the right attitude. 

For a Get Motivated Reddit group I'm disappointed in the amount of cynicism in the comments of every post. This is forum to motivate you to improve yourselves. It is not a forum for you to complain about have and have nots. Adjust your attitude, take action and you can improve your life in subtle and eventually meaningful ways. Just like RDJ did after this arrest ."
GetMotivated,fc5sp0e,t1_fc5k4j1,1577465002.0,Great way to not get promoted.
freefolk,f9j3lq4,t1_f9icyxv,1575354755.0,But it makes sense if the Force within someone can be passed heretically. I never understood why Rey with virtually no training and seemingly being a nobody has the Force and is stronger than the villain who has been training their whole life?
