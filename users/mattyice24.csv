TeamfightTactics,ffa5mz9,t1_ffa5exp,1579728356.0,I do love Ez as a carry.  Seraphs + ludens + jeweled gauntlet is stronk AF on him.
TeamfightTactics,ffa59ty,t1_ffa4qem,1579728151.0,"Word.  I was just trying to understand the synergy between glacial and electric specifically.  I always try to make electric work in one capacity or another by making Voli my carry, but I just can't ever seem to get top 4 with it.  Maybe I itemize him incorrectly, idk.  An Ashe + Taric for ranger, crystal, and an additional warden would round out that comp you listed nicely."

fantasyfootball,fegksyk,t1_fefxlza,1579095853.0,"Or you're a poor listener, and obviously inclined to express your viewpoints in a contentious manner whenever possible.

Henry played 2nd fiddle to Murray during his first two years in the league so, understandably, he didn’t receive volume.  110 and 176 rushing attempts, respectively.

In 2018, he averaged 10 carries a game up through week 13.  In weeks 14-17, his volume jumped to an average of 21 carries per game. This is when the organization realized that he’s capable of carrying that type of load. He had 215 total carries that year to Dion’s 155.  

In 2019, Henry had 303 carries to Dion’s 53.  All the while, he's had at or above 4.2 YPC over the course of his short career.  And won the Heisman.  Again, talent and size have been there.  MGIII returned from his hold-out earlier this year and his production was awful… until they fired their OC and started giving him consistent volume.  Gurley couldn’t produce with his limited volume until later in the 2019 season when it picked up.  My entire point with my first comment in this thread was that volume contributed in large part to Derrick’s improved success as a player.  

If you’re going to refute that, then at the very least explain yourself."

fantasyfootball,fe98u15,t3_eo095h,1578935450.0,My buddy claims he misclicked after he selected Royce Freeman last year in the 2nd ROUND.  Felt bad for him whether it was intentional or not.  There was a lot of hype around Royce but not enough to pull him then.
TeamfightTactics,fe98apq,t1_fe988lk,1578935277.0,Makes sense.
TeamfightTactics,fe94e8w,t1_fe4o6yq,1578934129.0,"Ah, I see.  That seems much more balanced than my original interpretation.  So having 6 would trigger all three of the effects at their respective takedown requirements?  Like over the course of five takedowns in a battle, Arcade champions would receive all three effects, or would 6 just receive the GA effect?"
fantasyfootball,fe8n96e,t1_fe6a96c,1578928206.0,I told you to go to sleep.

TeamfightTactics,fe4l52y,t3_enkex2,1578860485.0,"Lol, creative work OP.  The Luchador effect is great.

Master Thief seems busted, though.  Edit: Arcade seems on the cusp of being busted too lol.  RNG for those effects would have to be tempered."
fantasyfootball,fe41306,t1_fdt2oyk,1578854746.0,That sounds like good luck.
fantasyfootball,fe40wtv,t1_fdzs1q6,1578854689.0,When did they say that?  That was very much their gameplan in 2018.
fantasyfootball,fe40pao,t3_emyu2k,1578854642.0,50/50 between CMC and Saquon with the 1st overall pick.  That one haunts me a little bit.  Evans and Freeman getting off to super slow starts.  Just not a great season for me in my ESPN league.
fantasyfootball,fe400nz,t3_enqjjl,1578854502.0,"He finally received much deserved volume.  The Titans FINALLY realized that he's fully capable of being a workhorse back.  In the 2018 season, they couldn't get away from splitting carries between him and Dion.  It's simply a matter of volume.. the talent and size has been there since day 1."

fantasyfootball,fdrt8jx,t1_fdr7o8v,1578689422.0,"Fair, that does seem more accurate.  He'd be worth that range of draft capital (to me) if, again, he's declared as the RB1 in that backfield."
fantasyfootball,fdqhzs8,t3_em1i37,1578667147.0,"I like *Drake* a lot pending how they work out the backfield in the offseason.  If it's clear that he'll be the alpha, with someone like Edmunds as a change-of-pace back, then I'd be inclined to grab *Drake* as my RB2 at value in the early mid rounds (4-6).

There was hype around *Kirk* this year.  I consider him an appealing late round flier given Kyler's potential based on the moments he did shine this season."

fantasyfootball,fdk6ehm,t3_ellgnj,1578497123.0,"*Ertz* has a high potential to flop (relative to expectations) unless Goedert were to leave the team.  That TE split killed some of his value throughout the 2019 season.

I am concerned about *Zeke* next season given McCarthy's recent track record of grossly underutilizing talented RBs.  It'd surprise me if Jerry let that happen or go on too long, but we'll see."

fantasyfootball,fcyd4zw,t3_ej70h9,1578078347.0,"Evolving the TE position into a WR/TE mini-flex.  I've received mixed reviews on this in previous threads, but it has been huge for our league.  Allows for much needed flexibility to circumvent the limitations of an extremely scarce talent pool.  Yes the upper-tier TEs are still coveted, and sure, this eliminates some minor degree of competitiveness and strategy, but you aren't restricted to starting someone outside of the top 4-5 TEs.  Kittle was the number 2 TE this year and he scored fewer points than the number 21 WR."

Kupp had no less than 6 targets in every game heading into the BYE week, with double-digit targets in five of those eight games.  Week 10 was an absolute fluke, but thereafter he's had only one game with double-digit targets.  Everett has been a non-factor and/or injured since week 11, and Higbee has had 6, 8, 11, 14, and 11 targets since week 12.

TLDR: Higbee's emergence and consistency has been eating into Kupp's target-share.  Whatever limited targets Cooks used to have, he's taken a huge hit too."
