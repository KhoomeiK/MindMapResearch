interestingasfuck,fdt4lam,t1_fdsowxl,1578711843.0,I believe this was done during the Black Plague. A bounty was put on every rat caught and turned in. People wiser up pretty quick and began raising rats for the bounty.
howto,fdo41dc,t1_fdnwr1f,1578598503.0,Thanks for the explanation. Aspiring woodworker with only hand tools because powered stuff is expensive and intimidating
howto,fdlce5s,t1_fdlb5w5,1578521023.0,Is there any reason to not use a fence with these pieces?
howto,fdjva2a,t1_fdjv048,1578488656.0,What should he have done differently to be a safer process?
WTF,fdghu7b,t1_fdfwtlv,1578397428.0,I know the ones I like. But I will probably by a local made casket from a monastery if I am not cremated.
WTF,fdghrq7,t1_fdfsvmo,1578397345.0,One of the many casket companies in Indiana!
WTF,fdfl9g8,t1_fdfamvq,1578364320.0,"They are for the most part steel. A handful can be copper or bronze but metal caskets are mostly steel.

HomeImprovement,fdeq5ju,t1_fddm912,1578344292.0,I put loctite on it because I got tired of tightening them. May have been overkill but it fixed the issue
homeowners,fdeq0bh,t1_fde6te8,1578344205.0,Thankfully the rocks are larger than pea gravel. It sounds like I'm due for a rough week of sifting.
homeowners,fddfh7q,t1_fdczjt4,1578309908.0,This is the option I am well aware of and really don't want to do. I can throw time at it. But we are saving up for new kitchen cabinets and I don't want a bobcat to delay that.
homeowners,fdcp9bs,t1_fdco2o6,1578280593.0,It's an idea I hadn't considered. I will look into it. Thanks!
homeowners,fdcmp1g,t1_fdclq8q,1578278726.0,That sounds like the worst thing ever. Why don't you remove the material if it causes so many issues?
homeowners,fdcl11h,t1_fdcjvx7,1578277536.0,Sounds like the exact thing I am experiencing. Time to buy some gardening spears!!
homeowners,fdch9v2,t3_ekjaus,1578274861.0,I will look into it! Making one shouldn't be too hard but I don't think chicken wire would hold up as well as I would like.
homeowners,fdch4r3,t1_fdbwrni,1578274762.0,"I wish I had a gravel drive way it would be easier to just spread it out. I will look into the community areas thanks for the tip. 

The gravel can be pretty deep. Up to 6-8 inches and thick. It's also thick enough that I can't stab into the bed with a shovel. Digging will not be a fun or easy endeavor but probably necessary."
homeowners,fdcgur2,t1_fdc4cox,1578274569.0,"Unfortunately, it is a lot of big rocks and not small pea gravel and there is too much to to just till in."
homeowners,fdcg8wc,t1_fdc8ff1,1578274146.0,I will absolutely be looking into this thanks!
homeowners,fdcg6ln,t1_fdc4wvk,1578274100.0,That was my plan but would be a lot of digging. Any idea on where to get a sieve?
MechanicalEngineering,fda29id,t3_ekec2e,1578240828.0,Project or manufacturing engineering. A lot of companies will hire you as a maintenance engineer as well.
