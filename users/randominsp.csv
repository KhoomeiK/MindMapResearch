And finally, do you have any idea if people who don’t have a car would be able to manage this with public transportation/walking? 

Thanks again, super helpful comment."

It felt so good but I had COMPLETELY forgotten what it feels like to be touched in that way. I was shook to say the least. I went home and I cried for a good long time, remembering how important cuddles used to be to me and how eventually you forget to need them in order to survive. I vow to never forget that I need them again."

Re: gender norms. I am gender non-conforming/genderqueer/non-binary (whatever you want to call me) and I never really struggle with this part of myself. As an adult i learned the depths of inner turmoil most non-binary people experience I began to reflect on why I did not share these conflicts and I realized, gender was a *non-issue* in my home growing up. There were 2 girls and one boy. I don’t recall ever hearing gender brought up as a reason or explanation for anything. I never heard “because girls shouldn’t xyz” or “boys don’t xyz”, not once that I recall. 

Because of the way my parents raised me I had a DEEP sense/knowing that I was loved unconditionally, no matter how I showed up in the world. It was such a protective blanket, an armor of sorts that kept me safe from the bullies and the trolls of the world.

Edit- fixed a run-on"

offmychest,felkebe,t3_epndfj,1579224287.0,I feel like all of you debating the “has their shit together vs doesn’t” are over simplifying it. Just right off the bat whether or not you are neurotypical vs neurodivergent is going to have a huge influence on the ease with which you can accomplish the things that society deems necessary to have said “shit” together. I could go on but it’s not always a moral failing or a character defect that makes it hard to have it together.

Assistance,fe1j1fu,t3_enjz1g,1578827076.0,"Hey there, you could also post on r/askdocs I’m sure they will have help as well. If you do though it would be really helpful to have every test you have already had done and the results. I’m getting a fuller picture of the work up you have already had from reading your responses in the comments and all of that information is relevant. 

I’m just wondering, why is it that you think it’s cancer? That is pretty much at the bottom of the differential based on the tests you have already had. I won’t go into the many many reasons cancer is so very unlikely but it is so very unlikely. 

One thing that popped into my mind when reading this was mono- for your age and presentation it’s a possibility. How has your energy level been? Other than the pain and burping are you having any other symptoms? Why do they keep treating you for reflux, do you actually have it? 

It’s good that you are advocating for yourself. My advice to you is to keep all the tests and everything in a file and bring it with you to every appointment. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. One huge mistake I see people making when they aren’t getting the answers they seek is they start doctor and ER hopping, starting from scratch at each place, this usually delays diagnosis. 

I hope you figure it out and let us know if you do. Try to take some breaths and you’ll get through this!"
