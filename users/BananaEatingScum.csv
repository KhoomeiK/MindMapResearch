Then you realize that the request is not

>""I define what constitutes racism, and will use this power to push my political agenda to silence opposing arguments""

The statistic is not the only thing that will get you called racist either, black man with a gun gets killed by police? 

> ""He should not have shot at police, then he would not have been killed""

That's a racist ""opinion"" to many BLM-type people, and the cop haters will pretend they think it's racist just to try to screw over police.

Twitter has become so much more than just a way to follow celebrities and post pictures of your starbucks latte, it's currently one of the best ways (if not the best) for political figures to communicate with the rest of the world without pushing through the bias of news outlets.

> IT’S NOT LIKE COPS JUST FUCKING SHOOT PEOPLE AND SUFFER NO CONSEQUENCES ALL THE GODDAMN TIME

Cops shoot people and suffer no consequences because in the vast majority of cases the shot individual got them self shot. in the rare cases where they weren't justified the cops were punished.

Why can't you for once get mad at the people who pull guns on cops, instead of spending your days defending criminals. At least defense lawyers get paid. If I'm a bootlicker then you're a suspect sucker ;)
