The ark was about 1.5 million cubic feet, or 42k+ cubic meters. 1 cubic meter of water has a weight of 1000 kg, so it would take a weight of 412 MILLION Newtons to submerse it. So now calculate for me how heavy you expect the rain to be. Remember it could've rained over the entire surface of the earth, not just right on the boat. 

As for how water got out of the ground, I'm not an Einstein, but something like this seems plausible: lots of heat (possibly from acceleration of radioactive decay in the ground) separated water out of the minerals. Then extreme tectonics lifted that layer of rock towards the seabed, bringing the vaporized water with it. Eventually it reached the surface, and the water cooled and combined with that in the ocean."
