ExNoContact,ff4ah31,t3_erkpdm,1579559088.0,Nothing it‚Äôs him.  Love yourself to wait for more.  Don‚Äôt settle
relationship_advice,ff3dvta,t3_erfr29,1579539118.0,"You either accept this or move on.  I speak from experience, he isn‚Äôt going anywhere."
relationships,ff2drj0,t1_ff2b0x2,1579502009.0,"5 years is quite a long time.  I would ask him why he feels these friendships are a threat?  Also, is there anyway you can come to a compromise given that you really want to be with this guy.  

Well usually in my experience you want to invite your bf into your circle... just so he doesn‚Äôt feel like you have this secret pact.  

I do think it‚Äôs a little too early for him to get that upset, and if I were you I would walk away. Save yourselves the grief. 

My ex bf had many female besties and a lot of boundaries were crossed (no cheating) and I never felt part of that circle of friends he kept them pretty to himself.  It was weird"
relationships,fezk9d1,t3_eqzxnv,1579458232.0,I am speaking on behalf of your bf perspective... and I have a couple questions.  Are these platonic friends males? What mistakes is he was referring to? And where you up front with these friendships and the extent of your friendships?
ExNoContact,fez8fl2,t3_eqyyp6,1579454785.0,I‚Äôm so sorry.  It‚Äôs ok to grieve.... but there is a reason and take to time to reconcile the relationship
relationships,fem3p8s,t3_epvxjk,1579238717.0,Have you maybe asked why she so unhappy?
offmychest,fehyevy,t1_fehyb5y,1579126374.0,How so? I got my perspective off my chest
offmychest,fehy8up,t1_fehwz70,1579126271.0,Absolutely. Just thought I would point out a different perspective.
offmychest,fehvsqz,t1_fehv9y0,1579124860.0,I think a person that can fully understand that we are all human and heavily flawed can take a step back and evaluate themselves... but to each‚Äôs own.  Sometimes showing compassion and understanding can go along way.  Again just a thought.   Why be so defensive if you aren‚Äôt doing anything?
offmychest,fehut3s,t1_fehuk7g,1579124295.0,"I get it, but have you asked yourself what are you doing to give her that perception"
offmychest,fehtxon,t3_ep8o5u,1579123801.0,"Why don‚Äôt you try calming down and maybe try to see that person‚Äôs perspective.  We all have insecurities, be that person that empowers not tear down... just sayin ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

offmychest,feeclk4,t3_eopxsw,1579030984.0,"I would just tell her, and have a heart to heart convo... because sure you can settle in just being that close friend in your life or you can try and live that life with her..."

relationship_advice,fdmjul0,t3_em5z0v,1578552568.0,"You are experiencing trauma bond with this man, and I recommend you seek therapy for you."
TrueOffMyChest,fdd4nwi,t1_fdd4gzh,1578294635.0,"I also get your point as well, it‚Äôs about finding people who are on the same page as you.  Like I said guys and gals can be friends, as long as there are healthy boundaries... but I think as time passes like everything it will change and evolve."
TrueOffMyChest,fdd4dfv,t1_fdd40m1,1578294280.0,"Agreed, but I see it this way... at the end of the day are you crawling into bed with your friend or you significant other? Also, if you are talking marriage then I would hope you would put your spouse before friends.   Emergencies happen and I would hope everyone involved used common sense."
TrueOffMyChest,fdd3umh,t1_fdd3c5a,1578293666.0,"Well I think if at any point you prioritize your friendship over your relationship that‚Äôs not okay.  Like for example (and this really happened to me) 1st valentines together my ex boyfriend was busy texting his female bestie almost all night, including over dinner.."
TrueOffMyChest,fdd32xn,t1_fdd2eqf,1578292795.0,Curious on your regrets??
TrueOffMyChest,fdd323e,t1_fdd1gul,1578292769.0,"Not necessarily, I do think it has to also do with how a person handles the friendship"
TrueOffMyChest,fdd2yie,t1_fdd27pf,1578292657.0,"I have see both sides of this scenario, dated a guy with a female bestie and even though I knew it was platonic 
It was so weird.  He would definitely prioritize her and her family over me/us, he would take her and her children lunch every week, run errands for her, paid for her hair to get done, took days off to help her with her children‚Äôs birthday parties, she was always the 1st phone call when things happened with my ex, told her all my personal things I confided in him... etc... 

I also had a male bestie, but it was never like what I just described.  We would meet up for lunch maybe once a month, talked over the phone as much as possible... definitely my wingman when going out to get hammered.  We have gotten drunk plenty of times and we have never crossed the line, literally like my bro. 

It‚Äôs all about the boundaries"

dating_advice,fd3jtc5,t1_fd3isdz,1578159004.0,Yes I could understand that but is codependency.  It‚Äôs important to rely on yourself for healing
dating_advice,fd3hsyx,t1_fd3e49l,1578158407.0,"I don‚Äôt want to trash talk the guy I was with, because I believe relationships takes two to tango.  My ex had a female friend that he had a very close relationship with, strictly platonic!  I just could not deal with the dynamic... he prioritized that friendship over our relationship."
dating_advice,fd3gqqj,t1_fd3e49l,1578158208.0,"Sure, I was married for 11 years and we have two children and like you we didn‚Äôt make each other happy anymore.  Stayed single for two years, and in the 3rd year met someone online... everything seemed too click and we got serious so fast, he met my children 8 months after dating and then things started to down hill. I started facing a lot of insecurity issues due to his actions (this is what I mean about getting to know yourself) , I now see that his actions had nothing to do with me.  I think because I was so hung up on not being lonely I held on a bit too long.  I still want a long term relationship, more like a marriage but I am also taking the time for it to come to me in the right time.  I working on myself, everyday.  Figuring out my boundaries.  It‚Äôs been a tough road and its been apparent that I wasn‚Äôt done healing."
dating_advice,fd3dhuo,t1_fd3chg4,1578157212.0,"That‚Äôs exactly how I felt and got into a serious relationship, then things went south... it definitely brought more growth but for some reason it was harder to get over them my marriage"
dating_advice,fd3a8q2,t3_ejyfmk,1578156287.0,"Make sure you work on yourself before entering another relationship, figure out who you are, what you want out of life and accomplish things you couldn‚Äôt in the relationship"
relationship_advice,fd391tp,t3_ejyowp,1578155872.0,"Ummm, he cannot respect your boundaries. He knows what he is doing, you need to break it off with this guy!!!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fct7mvh,t3_eisfnj,1577935019.0,Yes!!! All of this! I also did the same and it finally feels like I‚Äôm being true to myself
ExNoContact,fb6u23b,t1_fb6t5y8,1576560452.0,It isn‚Äôt unfortunately.
