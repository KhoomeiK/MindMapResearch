SuicideWatch,fdpd0lz,t3_emjsqj,1578625530.0,"Pedophiles are now speaking out about their urges publicly. Nobody chooses what they are attracted to, it isn‚Äôt your fault. Pedophiles don‚Äôt deserve the hate they receive, especially if they are seeking help and have never actually harmed a child. 

There are likely adults in the world who are into kinks that might curb your urges.. idk it‚Äôs tough man, but you are strong for admitting this. 

If it helps.. I‚Äôll say that sexual urges in general are like ticks, and they don‚Äôt need to be indulged in to live a happy life. While we all chase our fantasies in one way or another they are ultimately unfulfilling. Maybe you can focus on discovering a true source of happiness that does not rely on temporary pleasures? 

You, being one of the people attracted to children without acting on it could also be a voice for good. We as a society need to better understand pedophilia and work to understand those who fall under that category. It is very important imo, and the best way for people to understand is having other humans who deal with it to explain themselves. Maybe you can consider yourself morally unlucky, but you seem to have a good heart, and so if you choose you may bring awareness to this very taboo subject, even if you do it anonymously. 

Best of luck you friend, you aren‚Äôt a monster, you never chose to be born or to be the way you are. The world needs to learn that. We are all in this together, and NOBODY gets to choose the cards they are dealt."

nihilism,fdmdh2b,t1_fdl9wl2,1578546370.0,"Do you pump your own blood as well? Are ‚Äúyou‚Äù the one breathing for your body? Tasks can be accomplished without the sense of personal agency, and when they are accomplished in such a way there is no sense of mental fatigue, because you aren‚Äôt imposing an unnecessary narrative of a ‚Äúdoer‚Äù and ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù of actions that don‚Äôt have any utilitarian purpose in completing them.

You, just like majority of humanity, assume you are making decisions in each moment, but there is no evidence for this in reality. Where is the locus of your consciousness? Can you find it? From where do you operate as an independent agent with the free will to choose? Our sciences and psychology have certainly found no answer, but you may as well look for yourself if you are under a different impression.

The only evidence we go by, is our thinking. We have thoughts that our thoughts are the impetus to initiating an action or decision. That‚Äôs it. But can we determine what entity these thoughts are arising from? Can we actually locate a self that is at the center of all the stimuli of experience that we can credit our essential identity to?

The mind weaves a great illusion and humanity is under its spell in some absurd way. Every problem our mind conjures is fundamentally false and exists only like a dream which is perpetuated every time it is believed. It takes faith to hold the conviction that one carries the burden of living their own life - even to hold the basic notion that one has a life of their own. 

Reality, as we say here, is meaningless - but it is a continuum, unbroken, seamless. There is only this illusion we labor under that we each have our own separate existence that we must pilot to the most desirable end possible. It is all nonsense, dogma. Living with identification to the minds Dream is hell, there is no escape. But beneath that madness there is a peace which is already there, it is the clarity of the way things actually are. And so we are not stuck, we do not have to buy into the smoke and mirror show, we at any time can look and see that there is nobody home. What we refer to as ‚ÄúI‚Äù is not our individual self-concept. Behind the ‚ÄúI‚Äù there is nothing."

The author has already established gray morality and humanized who we initially thought to be the enemies. 

The entire world excluding Paradis is not objectively evil. And so Eren may well destroy it all save his own people, but what the hell was really the point of the story if that‚Äôs how it ends? I mean I‚Äôm expecting and hoping for a dark ending but that just feels cheap. I do not think Eren will be the clear cut hero when it is all said and done, if he isn‚Äôt pinned as a villain or something between the two, but if there is an indicated hero I‚Äôd bet it is someone from Marley‚Äôs side, at least in conjunction with somebody else besides Eren. 

I‚Äôm definitely glad Zeke‚Äôs plan didn‚Äôt work, because that would have been boring as far as reading the manga goes, but he really is an interesting character who‚Äôs image has been constantly shifting in the readers minds since he was introduced, and will likely continue to do so. He certainly isn‚Äôt evil, we have since learned since first meeting him. We can argue the validity of each plans chance of success but Zeke‚Äôs does not seem to come from a directly hateful place whereas Eren‚Äôs (understandably) does. But whether I understand Eren or not, Zeke‚Äôs plan just seem less motivated by a desire for revenge/destruction as Eren‚Äôs currently does."
