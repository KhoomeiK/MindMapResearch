 I have to ask, is there a reason the ropes weren't removed beforehand and put back afterwards?"

LifeProTips,fckumc8,t3_ehnjae,1577733540.0,"So true. My son had tubes put in his ears, we were in and out of the hospital in just about 2 hours. We got a bill for almost $11,000 (our portion). I asked for an itemized bill and they had something called Patient Transportation listed, ie: rolling his bed from surgery to the recovery room across the hall, $900. The surgeon also worked at another hospital and they tried to charge us $2000 just for the surgeon being at their hospital the day of my kids surgery."

plants,fcg274w,t3_eh6ch2,1577635846.0,"I went to a work convention in March and every centerpiece was a a succulent painted blue, at the end of the event the staff started dumping them all into a trash bin and I managed to liberate 3 of them.  I wasn't able to get any of the paint off but its been 9 months and all have grown out a great deal, including entirely new growth. I'd say make sure your watering is on point and provide PLENTY of light. Good luck! 

May there be a day where plants aren't painted and covered in hot glued plastic flowers."

This is something i still struggle with myself. I used to abuse drugs prior to getting psychiatric help (BP1), alcohol is still a menace, a dark shadow on my shoulder, waiting for those moments where i feel like i'm safe, to come back. I was stone cold sober for 6 months (i don't know how tf i did it, but i did), and like stepping onto a path of thick mud, I take a step only to sink back into it again. I'm sorry you're struggling, I wish I had some miraculous simple sentiment I could share with you that could turn the switch. I wish I could turn my own switch. Acknowledging your dependence is something though, its not a fix, it won't make things easier, but it IS something positive. take one day at a time, maybe you'll decide to use one of your days to do something different, its just a day right? Maybe that day can turn into 2...  


you reached out to this community, that in itself is stepping outside of the bubble you're in, reaching out for something better for you. keep going. you are absolutely worthy of a good life."
