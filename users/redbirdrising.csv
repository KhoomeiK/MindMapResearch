movies,ff3azit,t1_ff2eh15,1579537660.0,This is like me with Tom Cruze. I really want to hate the guy but he keeps making great films.

entertainment,ff1skj3,t1_ff0k3f1,1579485240.0,"Voice acting made the movie. Editing was terrible and there were no transitions. Like they jump from a conversation to a perilous situation instantly. “We’re on a ship” “now we’re on the side of a mountain.

But the voice acting kept the humor going and overall it was fun."

Edit: I love reddit!  These responses are cracking me up!"
nfl,fdn806v,t1_fdmgngv,1578579767.0,It’s indisputable. Denying this is like denying the sun rising.
nfl,fdloxt9,t1_fdlicqi,1578529018.0,"He didn't ""Take 3 steps"" by the rules. He was falling to the ground with his legs moving.  Taking steps while not being able to control your fall is not a football move. He never established himself as a runner.  So by rule the ball must survive contact with the ground."
nfl,fdlospb,t1_fdllj1m,1578528920.0,I agree that Fail Mary was the correct call.
nfl,fdlocfs,t1_fdlbkma,1578528614.0,"Falling as a deliberate act maybe. But In this instance, Dez was falling to the ground while trying to complete a catch and never established himself as a runner.  Incomplete pass."

nfl,fdd32i3,t1_fdca2ka,1578292782.0,For this argument I’d institute World Cup Soccer rules. Overtime with no sudden death. If still tied then go to college rules.
nfl,fdd2z9r,t1_fdbx2ny,1578292681.0,"I’m ok with this. Guaranteed possession for each team. If they are tied, then sudden death."
nfl,fdd1qy2,t1_fdbxcjg,1578291340.0,What price? My soul is for sale.
AdamRagusea,fdbmrc4,t1_fdb4xtn,1578258928.0,Very nice. I don’t think Adam’s recipes are better than other YouTube cooks. I just think he’s an amazing teacher. Every recipe is so easy to follow. He gives great tips on different things you can try. Every Thursday is a “what are we making Friday”? day.
dashcamgifs,fda5z8k,t1_fda1m7l,1578242164.0,It was more than meets the eye.
nfl,fd83xo8,t1_fd6dm5n,1578213603.0,But how many of those does a player toss the ball at the ref before they blow the whistle?
nfl,fd83u44,t1_fd6ajwx,1578213562.0,In those instances the refs blow the whistle and rule it a touchback. Difference here is that he tossed the ball to a ref before they blew a whistle.
nfl,fd80sq5,t1_fd75130,1578212595.0,He bet on his defense and won. Ballsy.
nfl,fd80bd4,t1_fd72dbn,1578212400.0,"Logically I agree but in the heat of the moment, it would have been very hard for 99.9% of NFL players to have gone down on the 1. Even when offenses do this near the end of games, teams discuss it in the huddle before hand."
nfl,fd7xawz,t1_fd73vl0,1578211394.0,My favorite part of this was the Pats fans cheering the penalties not knowing how much they were hurting the Pats chances to get back into the game.
nfl,fd7w4ht,t1_fd6yuag,1578211046.0,"I was yelling at the TV when belichick was bitching to the refs. “Go fuck your self dude, you did the exact same thing to the jets this year!” 

This is why his former coaches do so well against him, they know his bag of tricks."
nfl,fd6qcx8,t1_fd6ofsu,1578194440.0,Seriously. He’s a freak.

nfl,fd6go2n,t1_fd6bmzp,1578190721.0,Perfectly balanced. He Thanos Snapped the Bills season.
nfl,fd6gio0,t1_fd6dlwu,1578190652.0,"I think the hit by two defenders from two different directions helped stabilize him. If any one of those hits happen on their own, Watson goes down. Still an incredible play to get out of and hit the pass."
todayilearned,fd4mu10,t1_fd2kq36,1578169019.0,That recent Alexa commercial where the mom leaves detailed instructions on how to care for their child while she has a girls night out really pisses me off for reinforcing this outdated stereotype.
mildlyinteresting,fd05u6e,t1_fczq0vk,1578114069.0,Not just good at it but also sprayed with ethylene to ripen them after storage. So it’s a double dose.

AZCardinals,fcdzlny,t1_fccpg03,1577615407.0,There were other high res photos I saw that confirmed the same thing. It was a catch.
castiron,fcdxmns,t1_fcasqd5,1577614826.0,Second this. Blanching and an ice bath work great
AdamRagusea,fccmh85,t3_eh2jt3,1577600112.0,"Only a couple slight tweaks. I used double the onion because, wifey and I love onions. And to make it easier I just used baby carrots instead of prepping regular carrots. Solves the issue of making everything uniform size. 

Everything else was as is. Though I skipped the baked mashed potatoes for the mash he did with his roast chicken."

HillClimbRacing,fc3mzqy,t3_efzl63,1577393584.0,I have all 7 (Including VIP).  But I have over 2.2 million career points and was active when Tank became available a couple years ago. I do recall the Russian camo took the longest to get.
AskReddit,fc35chc,t1_fc2k1j7,1577381824.0,That sub makes me ashamed of being a man.  But I'm also grateful for idiots like that because it made my dating life much easier. Step 1. Don't be a dick.
AZCardinals,fbvlk3x,t1_fbup12g,1577132554.0,"Yeah, there was a season where fits had three fumbles in just a few games. Yet we don’t consider fitz a fumbler."
