Don’t buy your book unless your professor says it’s required, even then Ive always waited to see if I’ve actually needed it. Most cases I haven’t, but a safer option is to buy the book and return it if you don’t use it within the first 2 weeks.

Before you buy a parking pass, get advice from students on how often they ticket (assuming you commute). I spent $250 the first 2 years for a pass when living on campus but didn’t buy one this year and just kept my old pass hanging on my car. They only really ticket at night and maybe one day during the semester in the daylight. At that point you’ve probably saved a bunch of money. Take this tip lightly as all schools are different.

Do NOT fuck around in class on your computer and go “I’ll just look over the material later” because you won’t and you’ll end up being behind. If you’re classes are like any of mine you’re gonna wanna really listen to the professor.

Anything they sell at the bookstore, they probably sell on amazon for cheaper.

If buying physical textbooks, go 1-2 editions older than the latest unless they tell you otherwise. However be weary because this won’t allow you to sell at a high price, or for anything at all. But this could save a bunch.

Any more questions DM me but if you don’t like this advice just ignore it."
