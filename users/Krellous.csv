relationship_advice,fffn48x,t1_fffms3o,1579887528.0,"I read the biography of Rin Tin Tin a few years back and it discussed how quickly the GS breed was ruined by inbreeding in the US after becoming popular there. It's sad the way people ruin things.

I agree that unexpected aggression is more dangerous, that's why they can't just get rid of the dog. I think it's important to have a vet examine the dog to determine a possible illness."

However, I do know that a lot of tissue, while thin, can be almost impossible to tear with your bare hands. Then again, zombies."
relationship_advice,fffjtuc,t1_fffja79,1579885505.0,"It only happened yesterday. They can't just get rid of a dog that turned vicious out of nowhere. Keeping him separate and taking him to the vet is the right move, they can decide what to do with him once they have more information."

todayilearned,fcoj9n7,t1_fcoeqn8,1577833609.0,"I was thinking the same thing, but it's possible he has family he sent the money to, or he shared it among his friends on the street, or he got robbed or swindled. Maybe he used that money for food over a long period of time.

Or maybe he drank it away, who knows. But I think it's still great that Colin chose to buy him clothes and supplies to keep him warm and gave him something to let him stay under a roof for at least a little while. Maybe this will be more helpful in the long run.

I feel like people on the street need supplies and clothing more than actual money. They need access to showers, toilets, and mental health support. Things that can actually help them get on their feet."

relationships,fck41cn,t3_ehh65d,1577715953.0,"Your friends are not wrong to be bothered by her. It sucks that they don't care for her, but it is what it is.

Don't cut them off over it, try talking to all of them. Give them a break from her and see if there's any way they'd be willing to try again later. If they really can't or won't learn how to accept her, maybe try expanding your social circle. I mean, do that anyway, find yourselves some friends that do like you both.

You don't need to tell your girlfriend that they don't like her, just get her to hang out with her own friends for a while.

Unfortunately, you can't use the spectrum as an excuse for awkward behavior all the time, because unfortunately, there just comes a point where it doesn't matter *why* someone bothers you, it only matters that they do."

Yes, it is okay to kill another human, because there's so many of us that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter. It's sad when it happens, but ultimately, who fucking cares."
