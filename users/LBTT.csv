Or, social media is connecting us to those opinions we used to hide from others but we see now that they have a wider audience and so we feel free to move in those directions.

This tagline acts as though the opinions we collectively express online hasn’t always been with us.  Spoilers, though.  The human race isn’t really all that inventive.  Some singular humans are and, given the right abilities, they can change the course of the world.  But!  As a whole—the human race just spins its wheels in place.  Old ideas die and are replaced by new ones which are the old ones but with a new coat of paint.  Ideas that cross oceans, boarders, and ethnicities.  We’ve had them for a long time.  We are not growing.

We can see this even with the various reboots in cinema.  We can see it in popular book series that are completely derivative of older, better (arguably), works.  One of the most popular shows is about a person perpetually regenerating and carrying on.  Hardly anything is new these days.

One day, I hope this changes.  I really do."

The easiest answer to keep the people from revolting is magic and a god did it.

Why is there lighting?  Fire?  Cold?  Hot?  God does it.

We don’t have enough food, not because I’m an incompetent leader but because god wills it and possibly because some people didn’t believe hard enough.

If lab grown meat will help us all not die, that means the animals must?  So now the populous is beholden to laboratories that grow their meat.  We can’t go get chickens, pigs, or cows because they no longer exist.  And what about milk?  Is there a process to grow milk in a lab?  So cows have to stay to give us milk and cheese, right?

deepfatfried,fdfejjl,t3_el3i7u,1578359837.0,"Okay.  It’s a bit involved but I’ll relay the story as best as I can.  So.  TJ was getting sucked off by a john in a back alley one day when a mormon came up and started trying to tell him about jesus.  Now the mormon couldn’t see the action because of a fence but TJ seemed really into the conversation although he didn’t really ever say much.  So this moron was prattling on and on about his church when a wild Galen appeared.  He had been listening to the drivel being spouted off by this mormon boy until he couldn’t take the stupid anymore.  So he came out of hiding, dong out, and started bashing this moron boy over the head with reason and logic.  The moron boy became both aroused and confused by the site of Galen dong and the the barrage of verbal logic.  At the end of an epic pawnage of Joey Smith and this moron boy, Galen then yelled, “Now!  If you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go back to whacking off to this dude getting blown by that dude down there in peace thank you!”  Upon hearing about the scene the mormon boy had unknowingly walked up upon and peeping over the fence, he became both aroused and disgusted by the brazen act taking place in front of him and decided he should ride his bike away very fast.

Galen’s take down of this mormon using logic intrigued TJ and while the John finished the job, TJ and Galen began talking.  They had a lot in common.  A beautiful friendship was blossoming.  They went out for snacks after that encounter as both were famished.

No one knows what happened to the moron boy in question.  Some say he left the church and now has his own youtube channel wherein he uses the logic that Galen verbally beat into him to challenge others.

Of the John: he and TJ would have a somewhat awkward moment when they met again sometime later.  The John, some say, became a regular guest on TJ’s previous podcast, the now defunct Drunken Peasants using the name Paul.  Although Paul is quick to distance himself from this origin story, he does match the description given by both TJ and Galen.  Although, Galen points out that it could have been a completely difference homeless guy instead.

For example: I’d grab a fresh copy of Link’s Awakening from AUS or EUR if it returned the Pink Bra to the game.  The actions of the mermaid are so very odd when what she’s lost is a necklace.

Plus, this has the added uh... *benefit* of being semi-public wherein the couple in question might be “caught in the act.”  This adds a level of mischief to the already taboo act.  Although, because this is a known use-case of this relaxation pool, there is actually a very slight chance of the patrons being “caught” as the place is avoided until the uhm... “relaxation” has ended.
