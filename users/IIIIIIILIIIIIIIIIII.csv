brisbane,ff8rv5n,t1_ff8pj22,1579693622.0,"I stand by calling the post thinly veiled begging based on the information I had. The fact is that all you said was you lost nondescript clothing, so naturally my first thought was, why isn't this person going down to salvos? It never crossed my mind and doubt it crossed anyone else's mind that you need clothes that aren't offered by salvos to make an income while displaced abroad. Sex work is the only profession I can think of that would fit your scenario. The only assumption I made was that you weren't a sex worker (or other professional if you can think of any) needing a very specific set of clothing not offered by salvos. I also wondered how you managed to leave behind the only bag with all your clothes in it. What other baggage are you hauling around? As a minimalist no less. 

I'll concede that questioning the need to know you're a sex worker was not necessary. All else still stands."

I can be afforded the right to get angry and frustrated like anyone else. Last time I had the unfortunate pleasure of interacting with the OP, she offered me the same condescending garbage à la above. Her holier than thou attitude seriously rubs me the wrong way. I won't cop it."
brisbane,ff8m4om,t1_ff7a83a,1579685315.0,"christ look at you go... chomping at the bit and conjuring up reasons to be mad at me. Nothing you're frothing at the mouth about is correct. Not about the exchange happening here, not about my personal life, not about me. I could waste my time listing them back to front but I'd prefer if you cast your eyes back over the exchange (and the rest of my profile apparently lmao), dust off those reading comprehension skills you neglect to use, and give it another shot.

In other news, me and my now girlfriend are going to cairns for the weekend. Should be sweet."

Oh you didn't like my sus sob story? Well I volunteered in a homeless shelter a few times so maybe you should too if you don't sympathize. You must be projecting!!!!!!!!!

Yeah fuck off. 

What opinions of mine are outdated exactly? What opinions did I even give? 
Why exactly do you think I have feelings for this stripper I've never met? Nice of you to step in and shield m'lady from the mean words though."

brisbane,ff5gr62,t1_ff5c9dm,1579592158.0,"oh.. deja vu... I'm being condescended upon via righteous exposé by a sex/miracle worker. What the fuck is it with you? 

I will believe everything you're saying here to be true, but the nature of it is bizarre and sends bullshit signals flying everywhere. Your initial story is clearly sus which can be observed by how you've had to spend time filling in gaps and explaining yourself to the multiple people calling you out.

And again with the out of the blue declaration of my ignorance to whatever you've decided to run your mouth about, even though it has nothing to do with what I said. Good grief what am I projecting? That I secretly want to take advantage of the kindness of strangers? yea ok lady. 

Maybe I am jaded though. I sit on the board and am the treasurer of a grassroots charity set up to assist those struggling in whatever capacity - mentally, physically, fiscally. I'm on the front lines. My research surrounds tackling social economic issues. It is not uncommon for me to see people take advantage of the kindness of strangers. I'll tell you what I told you last time - You don't fucking know me so fuck off. 

You need to learn to cut the crap no one asked for. It would have sufficed for you to tell me you had sentimental belongings and QR was unhelpful. No one needs to know you're a sex worker. No one needs your psychoanalysis. No one needs to know what a stand up person you are. Good for you for volunteering in homeless shelters. Pop by your local shelter and get some clothes."

videos,ff4m07h,t1_ff4kfr2,1579566853.0,"My argument came after telling you to fuck up, fuckwit.

Ok, so you've pointed out the obvious that those resources are sold to consumers. Is this the extent of your critical thinking? If you want to talk B2C scenarios, how many are producing in an effective, environmentally efficient manner, or the cheapest, most fiscally efficient manner without regard for affects on the environment and resources? And flying around in private jets is quite literally lighting resources on fire at an abnormal and alarming rate. Expound this idea for yourself to all the other lavishes that plebeians don't have access too. 

I can only assume you think I'm someone as half-witted as yourself, and thought I couldn't think as far ahead as your argument. 

But by all means, please do go on feeling disproportionately guilty. Continue making your sacrifices so that they don't have to."
