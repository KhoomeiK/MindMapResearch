hockey,feym1ve,t1_fevwmkw,1579447423.0,"Wow, is that true? Is Bowman really calling the shots on lines? I don’t follow the behind the scenes Hawks stuff too closely, but I had always heard that lines and ice time for young players was always a big issue between Bowman and Q. Is Bowman coaching this team from the front office?"

AskMen,fc2f30w,t3_efr0m7,1577356532.0,"In 20 years in corporate America I’ve never personally witnessed anything that would qualify as harassment. However I can think of a couple instances where executives had to resign over behavior that another employee complained to HR about. Mostly very innocuous stuff from what I heard, off color jokes, drunk at social events. In my experience there is a zero tolerance policy on harassment in public companies these days, so even an accusation is enough to end a career. Everyone is easily replaceable, and every employee knows it."
mealtimevideos,fby4215,t1_fbxq2wv,1577207581.0,"Yes, very well said. Complaining about the unfairness of America and capitalism is so common it's almost a meme. My point above is that Americans in the 21st century are among the luckiest people who have ever lived, regardless of any criticisms about the meritocracy of society. We always have a choice in life: be grateful for our own good fortune, or resent the relative greater fortune of others. You stated it perfectly - citizenship in an affluent and free country is a gift from the sacrifices of previous generations."
