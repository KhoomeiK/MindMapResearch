Your comfort and self esteem shouldn’t be dictated by him yah know. Also tell him it’s pretty low to base attractiveness on if you are wearing something that is sensual in nature. Honestly I’m shocked he would say that you should wear lace to be attractive. That’s 24 motherfucking 7. If he doesn’t see that, find someone who does."
unpopularopinion,ff683uo,t3_eroexl,1579621368.0,"This happens in a lot of things. I’m Polish and my grandmother went through hell on earth for 4 years. She moved from a German camp to a Russian gulag. She survived Siberia and is still kickin today. One crazy thing is that I don’t hate Russians or Germans. It happened in the past, it can’t be forgotten nor forgiven but understood. I don’t condone what was done but I can’t change it and we move on. This can be said about all Jews whom went through unimaginable suffering throughout the history of the planet. Yet they are able to move on and don’t hate the people that have caused them so much harm. I’m my time I’ve noticed that even though these groups went through unimaginable hell they moved on but then I look at black people and the slavery they went through. Jews were basically the black people of the world before black people because they were the most oppressed group. Hundreds of millions have been killed yet they have moved on. Thousands of years of oppression and yet they have still moved on. I’m just confused as to why as a collective, black people hold onto so much hate for white people even if the white people of today haven’t done anything to them. I could walk into a neighborhood and be threatened because I’m white. I’ve literally done nothing to these people, hell my bloodline didn’t enter America until the 70s yet I’m hated because I’m white. It makes me so angry that they can hate on every other race. They can make racially insensitive comments on Asians, Hispanics and whites with no repercussions. If anyone else does type same thing they are labeled as racists and get blasted by the media and everyone when they could’ve said something that isn’t nearly as bad as what they can say. I’m not saying the problems they’ve experienced are nothing compared to everyone else’s, I’m just saying that it seems kinda fucked that they have this racial immunity compared to everyone else. What’s also fucked is that I can get yelled at, threatened and on occasions nearly attacked just because I was a white guy minding my own business, and I live in Massachusetts which is a pretty damn accepting and chill state racially. You can disagree, but that’s why this is an unpopular opinion."

We are a urban ghetto school with mostly black and Asian wrestlers. I’m one of the only white people. We regularly get nasty looks from people when we go wrestle at suburban schools. We’re used to it since we show up in terms of our skill and competitiveness. With that established we are really closely knit so when we saw this happen, we all fucking jumped up. Like everyone of us was about to throw down and even our coach. We scared the shit out of them but that’s besides the point. The point is that this was pretty reasonable reaction considering we almost jumped a whole team over our captain getting smacked.

It wasn’t illegal. That’s all I’m saying. It violated no ones rights and remained in the realm of law. If they had violated people’s rights then there would be news everywhere about it.

I understand it doesn’t look good. I understand that people were afraid and that’s why they didn’t say no. You must understand the mood of the city at the time. A terrorist was on the run and a cop was killed. As someone who lives in that city and who knew one of the kids that died, I was enraged and so was a large portion of the populace. The intent of these searches wasn’t to exert power over the people and put us in our place but to find a murderer. If you lived in the city and lost someone you’d get that a majority of the citizens wanted him dead. They had to take the court case out of state because the jury was too biased."

But oh if a black guy has a and ounce of weed with him it can be 15 years in jail. The justice system needs to be severely revised and court should be based on nothing but the act itself. No information on their job, age, gender, race, or income. Justice is apparently blind so I think it is time that as a country and species, those who commit crimes are judged by the actions and not person. Just imagine cases like Brock turner. Everyone would call for maximum sentencing. Any weed related case would be solved with a ticket. False accusations could be handled better since gender is unknown.

As I’ve told a lot of people, don’t hate the ideas, hate the one who acts on them. Just like a gun. A weapon is no inherently evil, it is a tool of man and man can be the most evil thing the world. The evil man makes use of the tool, it doesn’t mean the tool is evil. I’m not saying this to justify anything, more to prove a point.

He wants to wipe out debt and health care for all, that’s amazing but also insane at the same time. In the climate of our country it’d be best to start small and go big. A candidate like Burnie who has such ideas gets a lot of republicans on edge and cause them to shy away from him as a candidate. He presents this ideas in a way that can feel overbearing and the ideas themselves are really to the left which makes even some moderates question their stances. With Yang, I want to say that he feels more approachable for people whom are moderate and republican. He isn’t yelling his ideas in your face but wants a nice sit down talk. His policies are more lax which allows people to understand what the purpose is without seeming too menacing. He is moderate enough that the republicans who voted for trump because they didn’t like Hillary are more inclined to vote for him. He doesn’t have ideas that are gonna cause an uproar with republicans. We see this by the conversations he has with republican figures. Yang was able to have a civil conversation with Ben Shapiro to the point where Shapiro considers Yang friend. Tucker Carlson also like Andrew Yang and these people are heavily republican. I can’t imagine a candidate cooperating this well with republicans other then Yang.

The communication between Brady and his receivers has been at an all time low and Brady’s relationship with Belicheck has been iffy. Now I’m not saying Flores and Fitz didn’t do well, as a neutral observer of both teams, the Dolphins played an exceptionally good game where both coach and team clicked, the Patriots in the other hand didn’t show up when they needed to. The patriots have a chronic problem or inconsistency and this was evident today. I do say that if both teams were playing at peak performances then I believe the Patriots would have clinched a victory, but that’s not football and they don’t play the best everyday. The Patriots are arguably better at a base level, the dolphins tried harder because this was their Super Bowl. Dolphins have no big games so going against a known team which is good and has animosity gets them pumped. A team that has nothing to loose is a most frightening opponent indeed."
