hookah,fdt3okj,t1_fdt0q0w,1578711503.0,Thank you!! The plan will be 2 posts a month. It might be a little slow as I get into the swing of things but that's the plan.
hookah,fdrypjv,t1_fdrq2a2,1578691752.0,Will do!
hookah,fdrku7d,t1_fdrjnol,1578685909.0,Mad love for you my brotha!!
dogpictures,fddydjb,t1_fddx8tq,1578326972.0,Done
dogpictures,fddwx7o,t1_fddwsb5,1578325979.0,Yes. Kaya has quite a stomache for a medium sized dog and then tapers to super skinny at her hind quarters. If you look at the comment above I had her DNA tested and posted the results.
dogpictures,fddv17q,t1_fddu2b6,1578324668.0,"If you look at the image I posted below my pupper also looks very similar. I had her DNA tested and this is how it came back.

dogpictures,fddu4vo,t3_eknk9h,1578324035.0,WOW that pupper has almost identical markings to my Kaya!

hookah,fda2fyk,t1_fd53ebu,1578240907.0,thanks!!
hookah,fda2f9e,t1_fd5dulj,1578240900.0,The best!
hookah,fda2el2,t1_fd62zew,1578240893.0,Hahaha get some rest!
hookah,fcrn4cu,t1_fcri57z,1577903982.0,Both are the same very open. The b2v3 comes with diffuser whereas the f22 it's an extra add on
hookah,fcri1jv,t1_fcrgcbh,1577902086.0,If I only had one I would do the b2v3. There is no difference in smoke quality but with the b2v3 you can have the hookah in multiple sizes. For that versatility I would choose that one but you can't go wrong with either.
dogpictures,fc6wqh1,t1_fc5x9ay,1577491468.0,I can see it too hahahaha
dogpictures,fc6wjlj,t3_egb9se,1577491327.0,I am so sorry for your loss. My 10 year old lab named Buddy was a puppy until a brain tumor did the same to him in just about the same amount of time. I hope you find peace in your decision and know it was the right one. I am sure Buddy will be greeting him on the other side!
hookah,fc107hr,t1_fc0y0b5,1577304522.0,Lol I'm not 100% sure. A customer of mine sent me the video
dogpictures,fbxon1x,t1_fbx1q0n,1577196024.0,Only 3 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
dogpictures,fbxnzpm,t3_eeukby,1577195410.0,Ginger definitely has some red tick coonhound in her. Beautiful!!
hookah,fbhxey6,t1_fbhwfaw,1576884881.0,The regal is just ever so slightly less open than the b2. The reason I like the b2 more is cause it screws apart and has a screw in diffuser.
