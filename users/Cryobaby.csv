fatlogic,ff6q49d,t1_ff5b46m,1579632539.0,"They didn't say it was dangerous to fast. They said it was dangerous to drop 20 lbs in a month. 

Limiting yourself to 250 calories per day for 30 days will make you lose 15 lbs (of fat, 3500 calories in a lb of fat), provided that your daily caloric requirement is 2000. It's very difficult to get sufficient nutrients for 30 days with just 250 calories a day. A couple days of fasting is fine.

If you want to lose 20 lbs, you have to exercise an additional 10,000 calories over your basal metabolic rate over the course of the day. 333 calories a day."

They're wonderful about it--of course they wouldn't want to take a baby away from a mother who wants to parent! But once you've given the final payment to the adoption agency (10s of thousands), their work is done, and if the birth mother changes her mind, you don't get your money back. They tell you that you go to the top of the list for next time.... but they also are incentivized to extract full payments from other families. Also, maybe the next baby isn't a good fit for you/ the birth mother doesn't choose you. Adoption agencies are not transparent, and people ignore red flags because how can they trust the red flags? It's a highly emotional, highly individualized experience, and things go wrong. They have to trust the agencies, or they can't have a baby."
