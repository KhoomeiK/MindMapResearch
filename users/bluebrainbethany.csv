fatlogic,ffaddtm,t1_ff3kyvq,1579732907.0,Oh my best friend is a very petite person and she buys all of her shorts and sports bras from the children’s at Nike. I can’t tell the difference but she says it makes her feel like less of a woman. Her waist is about 24 inches and her bust is less than 30. Sometimes I feel jealous but I know she faces a lot of criticism for her size. Especially when she was pregnant. She was constantly accused of being an “anorexic preggo” because she ate salad and still stayed active. Fucking body shaming is more damaging when you can’t control it..
fatlogic,ffad482,t1_ff36jez,1579732723.0,I’ve lost 60lbs and I’ve wondered this as well. I actually wonder what I’ll wear when I reach my goal. I’m already a size six in some brands of jeans and in lululemon leggings. It’s so dumb.

I was kept in the dark for my entire childhood from any news, politics, or any happenings at all besides what was directly in my neighborhood or what I heard in school (like when Osama Bin Ladin was killed I was in 9th grade). My school system sucked and we didn’t learn shit in social economics or history or US history. I’m 24 now and trying to inform myself of current events so I can make an informed decision on who to vote for for the first time. That’s why I’m on this sub.

EOOD,ff4lgp7,t1_ff489sa,1579566480.0,Wouldn’t QUITE call it an antidote 🙈 I still have very anxious days! For example my state had a snowstorm and I couldn’t get to the gym for 3 days and by day 3 I was shaking and jumping at the smallest sound and my nightmares got bad again. But on days I can run I feel so... normal. I’d say that after 3 months of consistently running for at least 30mins 3 days a week and being down 40lbs was when I really started to enjoy it. The first 60 days I cried everyday and hated it. Now I’m down 60lbs and running 5/6 days out of the week for over an hour. I LOVE IT. You just have to stay consistent to see results.

EOOD,ff4i3e5,t1_ff48g61,1579564147.0,Couch to 5k and podcasts!! I personally don’t run with music because I’m really picky about what I like and I get bored of the songs I DO like. So I like to listen to true crime podcasts or Netflix shows. Right now I’m running through Don’t F*ck with Cats and it’s really good.

I was really hurt and taken aback because SERIOUSLY YOURE LIKE 5’2?! But eventually I got over it.

Once a week I do a 30min stair-master session and work my legs and core on the free weights and then 4 other days a week I run for 60 minutes.

There is a REASON your body’s natural form of energy is glucose and it’s dangerous to fuck with your body’s chemistry like that. Ketosis is meant to be of use during times of famine and not for prolonged periods. 

Also, on the other side, people who say fat is the devil and only eat carbs are basically crippling their Nervous system. Your myelin sheathes are made of FAT and when you complete cut dietary fat from your diet, they are damaged and expose the nerve which can cause permanent nerve damage. 

And too much protein fucks up your kidneys.
