fatlogic,ff6s2qv,t3_ervuu1,1579633707.0,"My expander (the temporary fake boob that stretches out my muscles for my implant) has sprung a leak so it’s no longer doing it’s job of stretching my muscle to get ready for the implant. My in-laws arrive tomorrow for a three week visit which is usually restaurant after restaurant and everyone at work is flipping out over an inventory coming up next week. I have eaten my feelings for two days straight and all that’s gotten me is a stomach ache. I also have no clue if my surgeon is planning to move up my surgery and if he does will screw with the work inventory or, more importantly, the 5 day ski vacation we have planned for our kids? Not enough sweets or Valium in the world to help with my anxiety right now."

Our geriatric dog goes in Monday for chest X-rays to rule out lung cancer. My mom died very quickly and unexpectedly from it 6 years ago, and her mom is currently going through treatment for it. I’m having a hard time accepting it might take my dog too.

My heart goes out to you guys."

fatlogic,fcxpk3z,t3_ejgni9,1578068455.0,"I was already to get right back on track January 1. Doc has cleared me for exercise, got some helpful tips here, paid version of my fitness pal renewed, plans to go to the gym on the 1st to lift a barbell for the first time since August, and I woke up with a terrible cold. My throat feels like it’s coated with broken glass. I only want cheap ramen, tea, and cough drops.

Also, a question for anyone who reads this far. So I saw they make sugar free cough drops and I’m going through a fair amount of cough drops right now. If I eat too many of the sugar free ones will that have the same affect as too many sugar free gummy bears? I really don’t want the extra sugar right now but I also don’t want to shit myself."

fatlogic,fc2ibxc,t1_fbtm9z7,1577361779.0,"Thank you! After I posted this I got up and did two wall push ups and one on my knees. It didn’t feel too bad. Rolling out cookies and cooking all the food for Christmas kinda got me but I’ve resolved to start hitting the gym at least twice a week while my oldest is at basketball practice. 
Thank you so much for encouraging reply!!"
fatlogic,fbr5dzt,t3_edqwls,1577039362.0,"So this may sound like a rant but it’s not really, I’m just looking for advice. I’ve been cleared by the doc to workout again after my mastectomy and I’m terrified. I’m scared of how bad it can, and probably will, hurt. Not like DOMS hurt, like post surgery hurt. But I miss lifting so much! I feel all flabby and gross and not at all strong like I did in August. 
I’ve talked with a couple of coaches who have suggested wall push-ups to start with arm/chest strength and I’m just so afraid to try. My chest generally hurts from a normal day of work and house chores, I’m so afraid of what working out will add to it. 
Any suggestions, advice, words of encouragement?"
