Retconned,ffb8b9g,t1_ff4g5ps,1579754787.0,"I've been an RN for 13 years. The heart never moved. The left side is on the left side right past the center of your chest. That's the confusion. Your left ventricle is your heart. That's where we need to listen because it is on the left and it's never changed. That's just lack of medical knowledge. 

We all need to share true, legit things going on. This isn't one of them. I promise you and this entire sub. Any movement of our heart would compromise our entire existence. Any other placement of our heart kills us or shortens our lives. And people are born that way. My friend is one. His heart is flipped to the right and it's damaging. He's going to die young. Google it. 

I subscribe here because I believe this stuff but this isn't one of them."

If you're young, please wait to confirm it doesn't get better.

I'm 39. I have kids 21 and 19 so if you're that young, don't do it...wait. You will have joy but the feeling you have will unlikely go away. I don't know what it is. It's just misery. You can't ever function normally because you can't cope correctly so you'll end up homeless, an addict, or lucky if your folks tolerate it. My kids hate me because of my parents. I developed debilitating depression in 2013 and couldn't parent. 

I was kicked out. I took a nap on the couch last week and my son told me to get off my lazy ass and get the fuck out of their house. I can't wait to be dead. I work . I am an RN. He said why would some lazy old woman whose almost 40 be sleeping at their parent's house? I have my own house. I came to visit and fell asleep. 

That's how they view me. And my mom has had a joyride with it. I've paid for their college, everything...and they don't know that..so I'm NOTHING but what my parents tell them. So I can't wait to be dead. They will celebrate on my grave. Especially my 19 yr old son."

Maybe they can't afford a 2k surgery but that dog would have been put down if the person never found them and owned them. That thinking hurts my heart.
unpopularopinion,ff1c6ox,t3_er1syq,1579477400.0,"I agree. OP is probably referring to news stories of fires where 10 kids and the dog escape. The people only worry about how the dog is. 

The fire in CA was a good example. People were not warned and had to leave without their animals and comments on articles were how evil the people were. These people lived in a rural town and many of their animals weren't in the house. So do you die or run?

So I agree with OP. I do love my dogs and they are indoor so I could easily grab them if some emergency occurred. 

But yeah, it's way overboard these days. People bitching on posts about how dare a homeless person own a dog...etc. Most likely that dog wouldn't have a person and be put down in a shelter. It's sick."

I decided to be a shopper and I was constantly running into the items being out of stock or not the exact brand. (Or not enough). 

My last order, the store was out of everything, EVERYTHING my customer wanted. They had no reason to be. It was 9 am. I assumed the store didn't stock until they open. (Nope, they are 24 hours). I was so upset and had to cancel the order. They had NOTHING. I had asked the staff 3 times for specific produce in the back and they were so annoyed with me. 

This is a prime location Kroger too. I decided I'm not cut out for this. Anyway, I had the issue every order that they didn't have the item or the correct size, etc.
