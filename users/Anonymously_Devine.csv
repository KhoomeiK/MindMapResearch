I suppose that's why rich foreigners come here when they need state of the art treatments not offered in their countries. The fact is that the US offers one of, if not *the* best health care systems in the world if it were based solely on quality. There is a difference between a health care system and health care coverage.

The problem I see with most idealistic leftists pushing for free healthcare is that they don't have any idea how to get there; ""vote for Bernie, he'll give us free healthcare!"" How exactly? The US already spends more on healthcare per citizen than any other country, if it was just a matter of spending the money we'd already be there. Obama ""tried"" to fix it and just made it worse.

What's the difference? The Democrats targeted the blacks with their progressive eugenics campaign in the 30's, and would have been happy to do the same to the Latinos but they are extremely socially conservative and rejected abortion as abhorrent. Now Latinos have children at much higher than replacement levels while more black babies are aborted than born, so we're seeing the Democrats change tactics and pander to the Latinos more and more (open borders, free healthcare for illegals, amnesty).

It's funny though because once these socially conservative Latinos make up a large enough bloc of voters the left is going to lose some of its sacred cows such as gay marriage and abortion, and I expect that after 2 or 3 generations of being seen and self identified as Americans rather than immigrants the Latino population will have either changed the Democratic party into something unrecognizable or maybe jumped ship to the Republicans who are more in line with their values."
