CommVault,feonp5k,t3_eq4m6f,1579302613.0,"3 things come to mind, all related to concurrent workload in the environment;

vCenter is too busy due to a lot of backup or other activity, making a lot of calls to the api's. Have had this before and was hard to troubleshoot. This might be simply too many VM backup subclients with overlapping schedules, or too many machines being backed up per subclient concurrently (see below).

Too many VMs per VSA proxy server. Comvault recommends (or, used to recommend?) a maximum of 50 per proxy but I've personally found the real limit to be much lower, like 5 or 6 VMs max for each proxy if you have to backup a lot of machines in a tight timeframe. 

Too many concurrent streams per subclient (set in the subclient advanced tab). Default is 2 which is too low as it refers to concurrent disks and most VMs have several disks, but you don't want it to get too high especially if you have several subclients with overlapping schedules. 

Not sure how many of these you'll have control of in a managed service environment."

It's not newsletters, it's just standard email notifications for whatever event. Best example is the Plex Update Available event notification: there's four parameters that give information about the update (added, fixed, requirements, extra_info) and usually only the added and fixed parameters have anything in them.

I use html to format a nice email with that content, let's say ""Extra Info:"" as a bolded header and the {update_extra_info} content under it. In this scenario, I want the ""Extra Info:"" header to not be included if the extra_info parameter is empty. The prefix notation is intended for that, but the html tags for formatting the bold header and new-line between the ""Extra Info:"" and the update_extra_info breaks the prefix notation.

Essentially, the issue is that the prefix and suffix notations use the < & > characters to start and stop the prefix/suffix, yet prefixes and suffixes can be included in html-styled notifications (such as HTML-enabled emails) that rely heavily on the same characters but for different reasons. Normally that would mean there's an escape character sequence so that the delimiter character/s can be used inside the content, but there's no mention of such a thing in the documentation."

synology,fcj8bsf,t1_fcj7c4z,1577679819.0,"I totally hear you. I've used docker containers both on Synology natively, and on standard Ubuntu machines.  The Synology system had a number of issues and when it came to building a new system a few months ago, I decided to use the Synology to run a Linux VM, install docker-ce in the VM, and ignore what Synology has to offer from a docker engine point of view.

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell, there's kind of a correlation between the traditional docker engines (eg the \*docker\* CLI command set), portainer as a generic web-based docker GUI, and Synology's docker GUI.  Each one has the concept of

* Get an image
* run an instance of an image
* create a network
* assign that network to a container

&#x200B;

IIRC the Synology was a bit peculiar in that you needed to assign a container to a network, rather than choose a network when creating a container.  I never did much with docker networks as I wanted everything bridged on the default network, as I was running docker containers across different platforms and wanted consistent networking, DNS settings, and access between them all.

&#x200B;

As mentioned I have actually made docker containers work on Synology so if you have specific questions about getting one to work, I might be able to answer helpfully."
synology,fcj4qq0,t3_ehgf5s,1577677242.0,"This is not likely to be the best answer, but I found it easiest to SSH into my Synology, su to root, and then run the relevant docker commands. If you ignore the GUI, the docker commands appear to work perfectly. Once you have running containers you'll see them in the GUI but I don't recommend interacting with them via it; I recommend either completely using the GUI, or completely using the CLI (per image/container, that is).

For added bonus, I installed the portainer (docker web UI container) and then used that instead of Synology's GUI. Worked perfectly."

> 1. What is Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR)?

> SHR is an automated RAID management system that makes storage volume deployment easier than traditional RAID systems. SHR will allow users to handle RAID management, expand storage, and maximize storage capability even if they do not have a fine grasp of various RAID levels. SHR allows for 1-disk or 2-disk worth of redundancy - meaning the SHR volume can suffer up to two disks lost, and the data volume will still be available for use. Note that a RAID volume (either Classic RAID or SHR) is not a backup system.

Regardless, I stand by my initial comment; I can't see any significant differences and my understanding of Linux software raid is that there would be no noticeable performance difference between raid-1 and SHR-1.

There may be a *measurable* difference for some test bench workloads like 64k sequential writes but unless you know exactly what your real-world workload is going to look like at that level I think the flexibility of SHR makes it a winner over straight raid 1."
synology,fciew1h,t3_ehc8mu,1577661500.0,"Like yourself, as far as I can tell there's no difference between a raid 1/mirror and an SHR-1 set using two drives; both have the same data, and one gives future flexibility easily. I originally thought that there might be a write penalty difference given that a mirror would write everything to both drives ""without thinking"" but my understanding of the underlying software raid that Synology and other NAS brands and Linux distros use (mraid I think?) is that it still individually writes the data to both drives, rather than blindly writes in the way that I believe a hardware raid card does, in raid-1 figuration.

I look at it this way; if there is difference in write speeds using SSD drives, and that is enough of a difference to cause me problems with my intended use scenarios, then a consumer grade NAS is probably not the right choice for me anyway."
