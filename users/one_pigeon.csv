The point is that signal is not always reality.

It's a symptom of their body being fucked up. In no way does their body --- usually already ingesting a caloric excess daily, and no doubt having elevated blood sugar almost 24/7 ... need that food. Quite the opposite. That ""snacking"" is further fucking and harming their body.

This goes into extreme depth. TL;DR: Meal frequency is irrelevant. It does not ""stoke the metabolic fires.""

EDIT: Metabolic fires means burning calories, not feeling hungry. Some people think eating 6 meals helps them lose weight. Yes, if you want to eat MORE, then it definitely helps to split them.

I guess personally I don't care about meal frequency, more like ""planned"" vs. ""unplanned"" meals (""snacks"")-- and if you have many unplanned meals, you're likely overweight, or soon will be.

>Several epidemiological studies have observed an inverse relationship between people’s habitual frequency of eating and body weight, leading to the suggestion that a ‘nibbling’ meal pattern may help in the avoidance of obesity. A review of all pertinent studies shows that, although many fail to find any significant relationship, the relationship is consistently inverse in those that do observe a relationship.  
>  
>However, this finding is highly vulnerable to the probable confounding effects of post hoc changes in dietary patterns as a consequence of weight gain and to dietary under-reporting which undoubtedly invalidates some of the studies  
>  
>We conclude that the epidemiological evidence is at best very weak, and almost certainly represents an artefact. A detailed review of the possible mechanistic explanations for a metabolic advantage of nibbling meal patterns failed to reveal significant benefits in respect of energy expenditure.  
>  
>Although some short-term studies suggest that the thermic effect of feeding is higher when an isoenergetic test load is divided into multiple small meals, other studies refute this, and most are neutral. More importantly, studies using whole-body calorimetry and doubly-labelled water to assess total 24 h energy expenditure find no difference between nibbling and gorging. Finally, with the exception of a single study, there is no evidence that weight loss on hypoenergetic regimens is altered by meal frequency. We conclude that any effects of meal pattern on the regulation of body weight are likely to be mediated through effects on the food intake side of the energy balance equation.

And also this from the guy's personal comments:

>Human metabolism simply doesn’t operate that quickly and various research into both fasting and intermittent fasting show, if anything, a slight (\~5% or so) increase in metabolic rate during the initial period of fasting. The idea that skipping breakfast or a single meal slows metabolic rate or induces a starvation response is simply nonsensical.

Fasting (usually 12-24 hours) is only safe for overweight or comfortably average weight people in my opinion.

>For example, some early studies actually found that eating more frequently caused weight gain, mainly because the foods being added were snacks and were in addition to normal food intake. In that situation, a higher meal frequency led to greater food intake and weight gain. But it wasn’t the meal frequency per se that caused the weight gain, it was the fact that folks were eating more."

fatlogic,fcv7m71,t1_fcv5zxe,1577996320.0,">While you’re correct to say that people often confuse the expectation of food at a certain time with a real hunger cue,

There is literally no mental difference, so it's almost impossible to tell the difference except intellectually. It costs about $50 (possibly less) a year to get a full comprehensive blood panel done (no doctor) at a commercial place --- big KPIs are risk/ level of diabetes, short-term and long-term blood sugar levels.

You can also get a finger-prick device to literally monitor your own blood sugar, if you REALLY think you are hypoglycemic.

It's almost impossible to even find the incidence rate of hypoglycemia online; that seems to be because the vast, vast majority of cases are in Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetic patients.

It's laughable to plan your eating patterns around hypoglycemia, unless you have Diabetes or in a severe risk group for it (renal failure, extremely elderly). More likely you are giving justification to graze on popcorn whilst watching the TV set because ""blood sugar"" when really, their ""hunger signals"" like I said are 95% mental. Clearly if someone is over 300 pounds, their hunger signals are not to be trusted as in their best interests.

Yes you can have 6-8 planned meals throughout the day, sure, many healthy people do that.

However the idea of calling something a ""snack"" just implies sponteanously ripping open a bag of Cheetos.

Frankly unless you are doing intense exercise or exertion at some point, I would wager that people who eat 5-6 times a day would be heavier than those who eat 1-3 times a day. It encourages ""life is a 24 hour buffet"" culture, instead of ""refuel, get in, get out"" mindset.

I can think of almost no benefit to eating 6 meals a day, other than the erroneous belief that it ""stokes the metabolic flames"" (proven false). Or if you're intentionally trying to gain weight (lean muscle) and it's physically easier to eat 6 whopping huge meals a day of protein. Or if you're timing intake around workouts, and are extremely dialed in.

In most cases it's an excuse to eat out of boredom.

I'd argue the opposite. Eat one meal a day, and see how easy it is to maintain your obesity. Probably more challenging to do so.

I also think for the non-diabetic population, the blood sugar differences would be very similar. Eat one 2,000 calorie meal once a day, vs. five 600 calorie meals every 3 hours. Do you think there would be a difference in average blood sugar levels throughout the day? I don't think so, personally. Digestion takes longer than that."

Most hunger pangs are mental. Or mentally initiated. Your body ""expects"" a 3pm snack so it starts preparing based on circadian rhythms and dumping hormones and sending hunger signals, but not due to any physical need, but routine.

If you dropped the 3pm snack for say --- one week -- you wouldn't get hungry there anymore.

""Snacks"" are dangerous when eating mindfully because it encourages eating out of boredom and eating constantly, not planning to eat a nutritious meal, carefully planned, slowly enjoyed and appreciated. Nay it's ""let's throw the potater chips down the gullet!"" every 2 hours.
