AskReddit,ffcit4f,t3_esr647,1579800372.0,"Manipulation & Lying. I learned how at an early age. I got better at being able to mix truth with just the right amount. I had a really strong memory which helped me hold the information I lied about. It's not nearly as strong now. I learned how to read facial expressions, and how to read people's body language. I am good at it. I am really good at it. You know how people claim to know when someone is lying? I learned how to find out what their lies look and sound like. I am not perfect at it, but I can guess correctly a lot. I guess it was a coping mechanism. I was lied to a lot. I have trust issues.

(**Edited to add this:**One day somehow I realized what I was. I and who I was. I understood what I was doing in a new light.  It may have been self help books, or books and reading about how we are all connected, but something clicked. So I stopped. I would have to catch myself in the beginning. But eventually the truth became easier than lying.)

So Truth is I despise Lying. I despise my former self for who I was. How I acted. I've kept the skills of reading faces and body language. I can still tell if someone is lying. But I do my absolute damnedest to tell the truth. I don't lie if I can help it, but I'll use tact. I don't hit someone full force with blunt, hard truths unless that is what is needed. I will ease someone into the truth. 

So my answer is I hate Lying and Manipulating people. I don't like seeing it done by others, and I hate doing it."

CasualConversation,ff9pufo,t1_ff8yco3,1579718278.0,"I know you’re just being hyperbolic. But it’s rather shitty to insinuate that I may believe the earth is flat. This may be how you win arguments with your 10-year-old cousins but it’s wholly unnecessary here. 
As I said earlier I did not realize that Gen Y was rebranded into millennials. Which is also a recent development. 

Also I’m talking about where the generational lines are being drawn.  Which through quick searches I cannot determine who draws those lines. Also there seems to be dissent as to where those lines begin and end. Some use factors like wars/ big events to start a generational divide others are yearly. Some start in the middle of decades others start on tens. A generation is also loosely defined as 15-20 years. I am coming at this from the aspect of this generational division seemingly being arbitrary and defined loosely by whomever one is talking to, so do you have anything more to bring to the table on the discussion or is your tactic to attempt to insult others while not contributing to the topic at hand. 

I’m genuinely curious as to who defines and what are their criteria. Because from quick searches it seems to all depend on who is talking."

It just looked like you were lamenting that with only fiveHP they may not be a match for your party group. All I was saying was that with all the things kobalds get they can get unexpectedly deadly.   And while it might go a little away from your main storyline having a rescue party thing or even a judgment or some of that nature that’s not too bad and they don’t have to kill them.

personalfinance,fenvlm5,t3_eq4dw6,1579291588.0,"I got a ring made for my wife when I was going to propose. I sought out a diamond and a jeweler. He fashioned the ring and it was about 40% cheaper than what I could have gotten going the traditional route. 
First step i did was knowing my stones and know what their real value is. (First of all it is only valuable because people think it’s valuable. ) 

Look up the Gia or IGI STANDARDS and learn what you’re buying. Any place you go to should allow you to inspect their stone under a microscope. If not then bounce. I drove a state away to get a good deal. 

After I sourced a local ring smith. Dude was great to work with and happy to help. You may be able to find someone in your area that loves to create. Each person will have a different price. So look around. 

Keep in mind you’re now paying for custom work but it will be cheaper and one of a kind if you do it correctly.  

You can also look into doing a different jewel from diamond. Birthstones. Or other shiny things. 
Good luck and congratulations."
