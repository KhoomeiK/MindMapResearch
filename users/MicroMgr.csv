WestHighlandTerriers,feiirnm,t3_eoxo5y,1579139484.0,"My Westie only had skin issues because she is allergic to flea bites. She will scratch off her fur if she gets a bite, but your vet can give you some great flea meds. She loves to swim, and as other posters have said, a rinse with clear water keeps her clean. She also goes to the groomer every six weeks. Westie coats aren‚Äôt too hard to care for, a good brushing helps.
Edit - she gets an omega 3-6-9 chew every day but that‚Äôs more for her joints because she is 10 years old ;)"
