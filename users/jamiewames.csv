confessions,fe8piaq,t3_eo43m0,1578928892.0,"Thank you for sharing your story. We often see posts about people who are depressed and want to end their lives. It's usually the same story but we never get to hear how hard it is for those that try and stop them. I can see now how that takes a toll on people as well. I'm sure you've helped a lot of people, you did a job that not a lot can do and changed lives in the process. Take care, OP!"
