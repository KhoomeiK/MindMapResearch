AmItheAsshole,fcgs0l5,t1_fcgqmrl,1577643502.0,"Let’s do a simple example of 1/3. You have one black grandparent, two white grandparents, and one mixed grandparent. 

Let’s say that your mixed grandparent has the exact same kinds of grandparents, one black, two white, and one mixed. 

Then that mixed grandparent also has 1 black, two white, and one mixed grandparent with the exact same proportions.

And so on and so forth

Proportionally, the one black grandparent makes you 1/4 black + mixed grandparent/4. However , this mixed grandparent must be the same race percentage as you, since they also have the same grandparent types. 

X = 1/4 + X/4

X = 1/3.

Being 1/3 of something is perfectly possible, because

1/3 = (1/4) + (1/4)^2 + (1/4)^3 + ..."
AmItheAsshole,fcglp1p,t1_fceysa4,1577641448.0,"Technically it is possible for you to be 1/12.

Let’s call the races A and B. Suppose 3 of your grandparents are all race A, and one grandparent is mixed (call it X). Then suppose your mixed grandparent has 2 of their grandparents as A, 1 is B, and 1 is X (meaning that they too have the same combination of race grandparents)

Then, you are: 3A/4 + X/4.

However, we know that the mixed grandparent also has race proportions: 
X = A/2 + B/4 + X/4.

Therefore, X = 2A/3 + B/3.

This makes you: 3A/4+ A/6 + B/12
= 11A/12 + B/12, which means you’re 1/12 B.


So yea in a practical sense maybe not, but it could technically happen."

dankmemes,fc28myd,t1_fc27mvt,1577345680.0,"Let’s do iPhone 11 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S10

> Greater storage

iPhone offers 64, 128, 256 while Samsung offers 128, 256. Essentially the same. Android phones used to have the benefit of removable storage but now they don’t have that either 

>battery life 

Although iPhone has a 3050 mAh battery and Samsung has 3400, when doing real life tests, Apple and Samsung have literally the same usage times on their batteries. 

> Screen

Samsung has a whole 0.3 inch size difference, and the resolution is better I will concede. 

> more ram

Apples efficient ram management has the same performance as Samsung with less ram. 

>variation

I went with Samsung because they’re the flagship iPhone competitor. The other versions all sacrifice some feature. iPhone not having multiple versions of their phone allows their hardware and software to be intricately linked to be a more seamless experience. 

> Camera

While the camera megapixels might be better, iPhone has better picture processing with its A13 chip (better night vision, better OIS, and uses machine learning to optimize shots) 

> more open OS

With less regulation in google play store, androids are way more susceptible to viruses. 

>lower price

 the S10 is slightly cheaper, but phones that are even cheaper always sacrifice performance or other features in comparison to the iPhone.
