I get you feel empowered by this, but now someone who is possibly interested will see the ring and go ""damb boi she a-taken' feller"". 

And anyways, the money from that ring could've gone towards something much more productive for you... the feeling of pleasure wears off. The consumer high dwindled, and pretty soon you'll be shopping again. Sure, it's different for everyone, but not typically by much. 

Go make an effort to meet someone. Get online. Go out on the town. Go to local events... I'm hoping for the best for you."
