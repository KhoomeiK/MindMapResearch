Boise,fetskg0,t1_fetgoeb,1579379562.0,"They overcharge in the sense that they charge you what you actually did.   Like they'll charge burglary for a simple store theft to get the quick plea, that's true.   But the crime fits the burglary statute.   (Most counties just charge with petty theft in those situations).  Of course they plead everything else down to get pleas, and I know people complain about that - but people complain more when they don't offer a plea deal.  That's considered unethical too.   There has to be a balance.  IMO, most people should get a plea offer, and most people should be charged with what they actually did, but discretion should be used to for crimes like shoplifting, those should almost never be charged as felonies.  Which means nobody gets plea deals, which they just have to live with. 

And no, there's MANY people in Ada County on felony drug probation who end up serving years because the piss hot or skip a probation appointment.  You're just wrong that that doesn't exist as a thing.   I think it's the #1 cause of over-incarceration.   I saw the stat the other day, I don't remember the number exactly, but a shocking % of inmates are in custody as a result of a probation violation rather than for a initially-imposed sentence.   Felony drug probation also lead to more drug charges because you waive your 4th Amendment rights to be on probation.  So officers can search your house or your car, find more drugs, and you get revoked on probation you're already on - our prisons have way, way too many people who got there from that scenario.  I don't think they should be on probation on the first place unless they have a history of theft, vandalism, or other crimes.  If anything - credit for time served for the arrest, small fine, close it out.  

I used to see people in Nampa end up serving a full year for misdemeanor marijuana possession after they fucked up probation.   Nobody gets that as a sentence off the bat, but judges would lazily impose and suspend the max (1 year) and then leave it up to the defendant.  But that person doesn't need to be on probation at all.  If law enforcement agencies feel they must enforce that crime, because the legislature criminalizes it, the judges can make it a fine-only offense - they choose not to.   I think the max should never been suspended unless it's a crime and situation that actually warrants it, which is rare (and never the case with drug possession)."

Judges are in the habit of imposing a longish sentence and suspending it.  They kind of morally pass of the responsibility for incarceration at that point.  ""Well, it's up to you now what happens.""    I'd rather see shorter suspended sentences and let people top out faster.  There ARE treatment resources and for some people, the criminal just system is the only place they'll ever get them.   Drug court works well, for those interested in participating.

I'd agree that most of them shouldn't be locked up regardless, but I'd narrow nonviolent to victimless.   Some addicts victimize people in non-violent criminal ways, like theft (including identity theft) and vandalism.  I have no problem suspending (shorter) sentences on them and then actually imposing the sentences when they blow off probation and treatment.   Even when they're charged for just drug crimes later, if they have that history of victimizing innocent people.

Other  users keep to themselves.   I won't even bother using resources to treat them, but I wouldn't want them locked up, which means they have no incentive to comply with probation.  Then you're just giving people free treatment based on whether they got caught or not.

Chriswatts,feo5eiq,t1_feo505v,1579295395.0,"Investigating is obtaining facts, that's it.   You obtain facts by talking to people, searching things, and composing theories based on those facts and testing them.

Talking to her is investigating.   Searching her web history is investigating.  Asking co-workers about her and their relationship is investigating.   Figuring out where she lives is investigating.   Learning as much as you can about their relationship is investigating.

The Fourth Amendment limits investigations - both searches and seizing people for interviews.  The Fifth Amendment limits them further, nobody has to talk to the police about anything, ever.   So police rely mostly on consent to investigate.  There was a lot of consent in this case.   They can get warrants upon probable cause.   They had that for him and his house for sure.   They didn't have any probable cause to say - extract her blood or whatever you think they should have done.

I THINK what people really mean here when they say that she wasn't investigated is that they didn't charge her with a crime or at least consider her a suspect (and maybe seek out more intrusive searches through warrants).   But there was no evidence she was involved to get to either point, even after talking to her for hours and going through her shit.   Every time I see people bring her up and implicating her in the murder, they bring up that she's a liar, or that she's selfish, or that she's weird.  No shit.   That's not evidence of murder."
Chriswatts,feo5845,t1_feo4top,1579295307.0,"interviewing people and searching their texts and web search history IS investigating.   As it talking to other people about that person.    And composing a timeline.

Are you disputing that they talked to her or searched her web history or asked other people about her?    What else do you think investigating is?"
Chriswatts,feo3ygd,t1_feo1vg1,1579294796.0,Show you what?   I'm not doing a book report and pulling out the interviews and results of phone and internet searches and conversations with their co-workers and everything else.   That's all out there.
Chriswatts,feo3nc6,t1_fenzoyb,1579294631.0,"I don't think you know what investigate means.  

Which is problematic to your claim that you're figured all this out and are smarter and better informed than the people who worked on the case.

Talking to her, talking to her co-workers, talking to Watts, going through her phone, going through her search history - that's investigating.   If those things don't reveal any evidence of murder or taking part in a murder, you don't have a murder case.  Anything more intrusive she rightfully wouldn't consent to and they'd a warrant - which would be tricky with no evidence."
Chriswatts,fenxkt4,t1_fens0o6,1579292305.0,"They talked to her multiple times and went through her cell phone and internet searches, and talked to her co-workers about her and about their relationship.  And of course a lot of the investigation of him involved her.  Being a liar isn't enough to arrest someone for murder.   Everyone lies about their affairs.   

So many posters here think they're smarter than the investigators and that they've cracked the case from document dumps online.   It's so delusional."
JusticeServed,fenqumu,t1_felwbep,1579289501.0,"He also had a right to plead guilty.

It's rare, but sometimes defendants will choose to take responsibility for their crimes and minimize further trauma to the victims even without a personal benefit of a plea deal.   Obviously they have the right to fight everything, but that doesn't mean it's the right personal choice for everyone.

As with any guilty plea, the judge would have questioned him at some length about whether this is what if he wants to do, if he understands the rights he's waving, if anyone threatened him to do this, etc."
