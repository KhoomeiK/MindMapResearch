unpopularopinion,ffasau2,t3_esec7i,1579743326.0,"I saw an ""artist"" on a local facebook page who posted his art with a sob story about depression and leaving home and suicide. The douche got nothing but likes. I looked at the art. There are a couple good pieces but the majority of it looks like it was created by a 5 year old schizophrenic who has no concept of history, technique, size, shape or color."

buildapc,fectgqf,t1_fecsm6i,1578983958.0,"I tried multiple combinations of various sticks. I made sure to test both configurations with the stick that is not showing XMP to give the greatest chance of failure. I tried A1+A2  and I tried A1+B1 using different combinations of new and old. Currently, I'm replying from A1 old+ B1 new. Boots every time. You mention A2+B2 is that a configuration that will run 2x4?"

Thank you very much!"
LandscapeArchitecture,fec76fd,t1_fea84fb,1578967818.0,That sounds really interesting. I'm from lincoln nebraska. It seems average landscape architect pay here is about 50k... while architects seem to avg 70k... Quite a disappointment after seeing your numbers haha.
architecture,fec6qdf,t1_feamz3b,1578967586.0,Im under the impression that architects deal frequently with math. I think 85k is on the high side for lincoln Ne. sadly landscape architects average around 50k.
LandscapeArchitecture,fe917ol,t1_fe8ec9s,1578933093.0,"Wow, I'm surprised at how quickly people get such large raises. That's encouraging. My stepfather and mother make 80k together and they are in their late 50s, so to make 60k by my self sounds like a dream.

college,fdyld7u,t1_fdyk1k5,1578781047.0,Thank you. Graphic Design with a minor in product design was the front runner. I'm just worried that the pay is low and the job market is flooding on a biblical level.
college,fdyl5po,t1_fdyjd1r,1578780974.0,I took the liberty of eliminating any majors that require math classes above calculus. Hopefully any math learned outside of math classes will be minimal or at least intuitive.
college,fdyijbk,t1_fdyfsbl,1578780107.0,"I'm a jack of all trades. I have some interest in almost everything but a passion for nothing. I'm good at problem solving, not necessarily math (calculus is my highest level). I'm able to think creatively and abstractly. I'm a kind and honest person but always look out for number one. I am torn between INTP and ISTP. I have one associate degree in art and one in science. In my free time I like to watch youtube, cook, play video games, workout. I'm quite rounded so its difficult to pick one."
