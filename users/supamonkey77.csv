Every feeling of persecution, whether based on reality or not gives them a stiffy. Why wouldn't they keep rubbing it for pleasure it gives.

Edit: I should add that there are people who truly do try to walk in his path. But that requires humility, slow to judgement and simply loving everyone. Persecution boners want the ""easy path"" to feeling like walking in his path, thus the outrage about attacks."

tuesday,fexw2ar,t1_fevxpdi,1579437409.0,"> Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t this something that Customs and Border Protection actually wants? 

I was under the impression there were mixed feelings about it. I would love to see an efficacy study(from a non partisan group) of the proposed wall that the Admin wants to build. IM(non expert)O a wall, as proposed by the admin, would actually might have a net negative effect. It would actually lead to less security and over reliance on the wall as a deterrence. We already know, from different places around the border that the walls can be gotten over/under and even through. Again, imho, a better solution would be a simpler fencing+ more partols+ technology such as IR drones, motion detectors etc+ renting space from private land owners to establish micro bases for surveillance. 

But if people were really serious about illegal immigration, there is a lot easier way to reduce it. Go after the employers and go after them hard. Whether its a meat plant in Georgia or a farm in rural Kansas or a Taco truck renter in California. But that hurts local businesses and that hurts the politicians. That's why the distraction about walls and sanctuary cities from the right and left leaning politicians. I heven't seen either side offer solutions that can be worked on together. One side just likes to use illegals as a fear motivator and the other as a sympathy motivator."

Imho, there is not just an corporate campaign of creating mistrust of green jobs and solutions but also a grassroots religious one. 

My own personal experience about a specific incident. My SO and I used to attend a SBC affiliated church because her aunt was a high up member. In 2010-11, during a Sunday service, the pastor talked about the ""environment"" and how it was not changing or was going to affect us. And he used the bible, specifically genesis 8:21-22 to argue for lack of climate change. And the people agreed."

They are a pretty strong force in India. Even Walmart which paid millions(USD) in bribes to local political parties couldn't launch properly in India. 

But I have to mention that the middle men and retailers are no saints themselves. A lot of price hikes, labour abuse and lack/availability of products is done by them. However unlike, say China, the national/local polirians  have to win elections to stay in power. And no matter how much a multinational company can throw money at them, the locals will likely follow the local retailers line since they have a strong grassroots network that can elect/unseat a person better than just the influence money can buy."

aznidentity,fegfwt9,t3_eoue5z,1579091412.0,"The push and pull of your cultural heritage is a common phenomena. Most Asians( men and women), rather most immigrants of color generally feel a push away from their ancestors culture because they feel its isolating, laughed at, misunderstood etc. And while we are young, especially as a teen, we crave nothing more than to belong. But as most of the people in your situation, well I should say our situation( Asians living in the west), grow up and start forming their unique identities, usually in college or after, there is a pull back towards that culture. 

Another factor in your awakening to Asian culture and issues is likely the stress being an Asian adult in majority white America. 

>[Specifically, individuals in low race-related stress conditions who had low Asian values, high Conformity and low Dissonance attitudes started high on well being but decreased as race-related stress increased.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854415/)

doi: 10.1037/a0017393

As a child you didn't notice it, but as you mentioned, you've started noticing the microaggressions and other openly racist things about Asians that are present in American culture. 

>These findings underscore the importance of how racial identity statuses, Asian values and ethnic identity jointly and uniquely explain and moderate the effects of race-related stress on positive well-being.

From my understanding of the study, if you actually grow up with more ""Asian-ness"" in your family and surroundings, find a balance between being an Asian and a person growing up in American culture, instead of rejecting everything Asian, you will likely fair better as an adult with less stress. No matter how you try to conform or become mainstream American, when you become an adult and have to face the racism that affects all people of color, your best defense is not your rejection of your heritage but the acceptance of it and finding a balance with your American side."
