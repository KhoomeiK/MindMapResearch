AmItheAsshole,ff7nulz,t1_ff78zfq,1579654028.0,"Agree with your concerns. This post is disturbing in that it accuses a 9 year old of ""doing everything he can to make our lives miserable"" Hulloo? Clearly the kid was in a broken family siuation. It doesn't take much general knoweldge to know that children are vulnerable when marriages break up.

Why did OP and her husband not address these behaviours at the time (which was arguably acting out).

How can ""a child's  lies"" damage adults professional and financial lives? INFO would help.

Why does an adult take to heart that ridiculous statement about a toxic womb? Its probably coming straight from the birth mum . OP letting this  (yes cruel, but also ridiculous) taunt get to her indicates she feels powerless which means she is unable to stand up at the time of an insult. Not good.

Agree OP is NTA and should expect her rules of the house to be respected but this ""family"" seriously needs a bunch of therapy.

You don't grow out of mental health despair (which arguably this kid had/has) when you hit 18. The kid has deep seated problems which need addressing and resolving by a trained professional."

Tell them that in June 1918 an article from the trade publication *Earnshaw's Infants' Department* said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.

So many colliding factors;

1. Severe drought which has dried out even damp rainforest environments - there was literally piles of kindling everywhere ... so climate change

Then

2. Intense weather conditions with extreme heat and wind which prevented normal hazard reduction burning earlier in the year and created perfect fire conditions this summer

Then

3. Fires started either naturally or intentionally or accidentally which cannot be contained because of the previous two things

Then

4. Poor government policy and funding means that there was not a national management strategy in place and enough helicopters/resources amassed to manage the crisis"
