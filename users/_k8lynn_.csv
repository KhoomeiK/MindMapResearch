bipolar,ff9c8f1,t1_ff93d45,1579709684.0,"Sure :) 

So the colorful little bubbles represent mania, because they‚Äôre bright and show up in all different shapes and sizes. And then the dark and spiked ones are the depressive thoughts. They‚Äôre spikey because depression seems to hurt more than mania (at least in my case) and seems to infiltrate any positive or happy thoughts. And the figure was supposed to represent a more extreme version of myself, since Bipolar seems so extreme and such a big deal in my life. And she‚Äôs got the blue dark circles because the disorder is so exhausting."

BipolarReddit,fenekw3,t3_eq1u3v,1579283010.0,I recommend going to the hospital because they will most likely fix your meds as soon they can and find you a therapist
BipolarReddit,fem44fm,t3_epvjtu,1579239109.0,I do the same. I've heard irritability is common with bipolar people. Not sure if it's the disorder or the meds but it breaks my heart when I act so mean to my loved ones.
BipolarReddit,febpycg,t3_eo9wlt,1578961422.0,I literally just applied to a laundromat and it seems chill. They just fold stuff and clean the place

bipolar,fe3h55k,t1_fe0l9zx,1578849214.0,"As far as medical expenses, things just always seem to sneak up on ya lol. Maybe you should make a list with statistics about how animals help with mental illness. It's hard to argue with hard facts!"
houseplants,fe0kjwt,t1_fe0khmi,1578815028.0,That's awesome!!
houseplants,fe0k8qt,t3_enfgok,1578814847.0,I have one of these and he's GIGANTIC. Didn't expect these to get so huge
bipolar,fe0jw89,t3_enk496,1578814648.0,"I got my sweet kitty during a depressive episode and she basically saved my life. She always know when I'm upset and comes to cuddle. I recommend all animal lovers suffering from mental illness to get a pet to love on. 

However!!! Animals cost so much money. You have to consider getting the pet spayed or neutered, shots, and vet treatment/check ups (for me it's usually around ~60 for the appointment PLUS whatever medicine or shots they give, often totaling $100+). You also have to have food, litter, and flea and tick treatments that are given monthly. It all stacks up pretty pricey, I'd recommend getting a part time job, even if it's only working a shift or two a week.

It's better to give a pet a loving and stable home rather than falling in love with an animal and having to give it up because you can't afford to give it the proper care it deserves  üíó"

BipolarReddit,fds8wwa,t1_fds5qpo,1578697035.0,I'm sorry you had to deal with it too. It's really triggering for depression

bipolar,fcwsbw5,t3_ej86do,1578035625.0,I kinda agree. I love the art and want to support everyone but it seems to be all I see anymore. Maybe multiple days for art posting to encourage it but to filter it just a little
BipolarReddit,fcwmrx9,t3_ej9s60,1578030062.0,"I very much understand where you're coming from. I've been in a similar situation for months and I've finally decided to talk to my therapist about hospitalization tomorrow morning. I hope that you feel better soon, do you have medication and/or someone to talk to?"
