I eat meat. I'm from an area where people hunt. If I moved to the suburbs and had a neighbor spend 5 hours butchering a 500 pound animal he killed in full view from my property, and possibly in view of kids, I would hate it. If you want to hunt and live near the city, bring it to a butcher. If you want to hunt and butcher your catch, live in the country. 

Like jfc. I have no desire to see an animal dissected. I understand that's where meat comes from but it doesn't mean I want to see it. I understand how surgery works too but that doesn't mean that I want to watch a doctor do it, so that's part of why I didn't go into the medical field, just like that's part of why your neighbors didn't move out into the country where that's a normal occurrence.

The point was never to discount your pain or make you feel bad for feeling it. It was to convince you of what he knows is true: his family is your family now too, and they love you.

That being said, that law for service animals seems a bit wild.

My mom was/is in your exact position. She didn't ask my dad to sit out parties at first and it hurt her feelings so badly when he would go (clueless.) They went to therapy and guess who goes to fewer family functions because he loves and supports his wife and hates how his family treats her. 

You don't need therapy to get to that point. The issue isn't with the kid. Of course you want to support the kid as you don't have anything against him. But you're well within your rights to not want your SO to be hanging around someone who actively shit on you.

I don't need a diganosis or anything, was just hoping someone whose dog did a similar thing might know the best way to deal with it so that it will heal decently"
pitbulls,fcwpvt2,t1_fcwmfzg,1578033027.0,Thank you! If the rescue ends up finding me to be a good fit you can be sure that I'll have a bunch of pictures of my baby girl on this sub!
pitbulls,fcwlbrf,t1_fcwkftk,1578028820.0,"She'd be coming to me from a rescue and is around 2 years old, but I definitely want to make her comfortable with touch. The encouraging thing is that they have some photos and videos of her being really lovely with kids and being pet by them. But my parents' dog started out very skittish and reactive when we adopted him, so I know how important it is to get them used to that. 

Also your doggo is named Eevee?! I'm crying, that's so adorable."
pitbulls,fcwhw1t,t1_fcwhq6z,1578026051.0,"Oh yup DEFINITELY. And she's currently a bit nervous around dogs, so socialization will definitely have to be intentional and planned out. Luckily my mom used to dogsit so I'm pretty familiar with dog body language and interactions, which I hope will help with socialization."

AmItheAsshole,fcve26q,t3_ej0j5b,1578000156.0,"NAH I wasn't baptized until I decided to be and while I'm not currently religious, baptism had no part in that. Letting your children make their own decisions and being open to teaching them about religion with an open mind is an awesome thing to do. That being said, your GF truly believes that her children will go to hell if they aren't baptized, so it's unlikely you will find a compromise on this that isn't you agreeing to baptize."

Life is confusing and messy, and you're valid and beautiful. It isn't easy to look past the mean things your brain says about you, but just remember that, as smart as they are, brains are dumb as hell."
AmItheAsshole,fcp70r7,t1_fcp6x27,1577852580.0,Oof that's a jerk move. Either everyone should be allowed to be on the clock or nobody should.
