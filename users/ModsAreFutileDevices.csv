Huh, weird thing is that those are all groups that republicans try to discourage from voting

Or, in some cases, groups where Republicans shut down all nearby polling stations in their areas on short notice

Or, groups where republican states suddenly remove these people from the voter rolls

What a strange coincidence"
thebachelor,ff8k4qg,t1_ff89ukt,1579682287.0,"> It was CNN that released the info

Let‚Äôs make this very straightforward and keep to literally ONLY the facts

1) There were ONLY TWO PEOPLE in the meeting according to all accounts: Bernie and Warren themselves, no aides

2) The story got out to CNN

3) The story that Bernie allegedly said a woman couldn‚Äôt win the Presidency came from A) Bernie B) Someone Bernie told C) Warren or D) Someone Warren told

4) The story only comes out a year and a half later A DAY BEFORE A DEBATE

5) The story comes out as Warren is sliding in the polls and has abysmal fundraising numbers

*now on to opinions*

So back to point 3, the story did not come from Bernie, because why would Bernie leak a story to CNN that he doesn‚Äôt think a woman could be president? I don‚Äôt think the story would come from someone Bernie told, because that makes no sense and would only hurt him

SO WHO TOLD CNN? Either Warren leaked the story to CNN, or Warren told the story to someone else who leaked it to CNN. Conveniently for Warren, again, literally a day before a debate and just as she‚Äôs doing very poorly in the race

So no, what‚Äôs toxic is leaking a story to the media that your friend, who urged you (a woman) to run for president, and is ON CAMERA saying a woman could be President (back when Warren was literally a REGISTERED REPUBLICAN) does not think that a woman could be President just for your own short term political gain"
