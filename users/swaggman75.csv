You need something to bring fresh air into the area.

It was the last paragraph, comon.

If you worked in safety then you should know the hierarchy of controls. Telling people to do SG checks is administrative, at the bottom. You should be making engineering changes to the process, use bottles that won't fail before the cap does, cold crash or secondary racking before bottling as part of the recipe/process to circumvent any stalls.

You have to teach them to think safely before they work safely, a professional would understand that. Telling them ""*you have to do this safety step*"" is a good way to get them to NOT do it. But if safety is part of the process then they don't need to think before doing it"

>Wine is made from grapes; which are the same fruit from which raisins are also made. If raisins and  grapes had enough nutrients for healthy yeast fermentation, wine makers would never have to add nutrients to their grape must. However that is certainly not the case: nutrient additions are considered standard and commonplace in the wine industry.

Since the YAN of grape musts ranged from 50-400 ppm per the paper, which is a huge range, then only some of the musts would need additions and not much for most of them. On top of that wine makes take the skins out of the must which would force them to add YAN back in which skews the whole thing again.

You need to stabilize before back-sweetening because if your yeast haven't hit their ABV limit they will process that suger also.

You also want to hold off on clarifying untill after back-sweetening because anything you add will add particulates to the system expecialy with fruits and you'll probably want to clarify them out."
