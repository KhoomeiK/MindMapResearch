suboxone,ffac840,t1_ffabtnr,1579732113.0,You went from taking 3- 4 pills a day (24 -32 mg) to just 2.5 mg?  If that’s the case you will feel withdrawals.
suboxone,ff4jky5,t3_erl5yq,1579565182.0,"Relax.  You were not experiencing withdrawals. I went from 12 mg - 4 mg and didn’t feel any withdrawal symptoms until 3 weeks later.   You are fine but don’t take so much, you are just wasting it.    Truly less is more."
socialanxiety,ff411we,t3_eriznu,1579553222.0,Don’t say anything to anyone.  Just say you need to leave right at 5 for another obligation
SkincareAddicts,feta0i3,t3_eqh1dc,1579373165.0,You should see a dermatologist. Anything that has been on your face that long should get looked at. I had a spot that I hoped would go away for years and it turned out to be cancer.  It was easily taken off.
suboxone,fep4wad,t1_fep4izg,1579312195.0,Been on it 16 years.  Never read that.
suboxone,fep4dnh,t1_fep3i3c,1579311870.0,No it is not a side effect
suboxone,fefpfar,t3_eoun9a,1579061514.0,You will feel nothing.
OpiatesRecovery,fed7y9f,t3_eoidux,1579003015.0,Thanks for the post.   Are you suggesting to take this with gabapentin or in place of it?
thebachelor,fe7ukbd,t1_fe7txiu,1578919432.0,Absolutely!
alcoholism,fe655i5,t3_enx4sm,1578882009.0,"There will always be a night planned that you will put off stopping for.  Just stop now.  Live in the moment.  One day at a time.  Think about TODAY.  Don’t think about what could happen in the future, if you did you’d always have an excuse not to stop.  Tell her you will make your decision then.  Hopefully by then you will want it even more.  Good luck."
socialanxiety,fe5twsg,t3_envs22,1578874845.0,Look at it this way. Maybe the woman has social anxiety as well and was trying to make small talk and that came out.   Maybe she is so embarrassed about her remark.  I mean you never know right?   We can’t always be victims.
suboxone,fe5tm8z,t3_envros,1578874664.0,"Unfortunately low sex drive is a very normal side effect
However, anxiety and depression not as much if you are on an appropriate dose.  16 mg is pretty high so that could be causing it.  I would try lowering it and see if you feel better.   Seriously, less is MORE with this drug.   I recently 1/2 my dose and can’t believe I feel as good as I do ( 12mg -6)"
suboxone,fdw2ccj,t3_emthhu,1578754285.0,"Yes, me!!!   I definitely lost weight on subs!!!   I have no appetite except for sweets.  Luckily I am active enough that those empty calories don’t add up.   Many times I have to force myself to eat something  
so I can get a workout in."
suboxone,fdtd9sq,t3_en1l0u,1578715115.0,I really don’t think so.  Something else must be going on with you.
thebachelor,fdsja35,t3_emzzwi,1578703827.0,Absolutely no possibility according to Reality Steve
socialanxiety,fdseyiy,t3_emzhqh,1578701183.0,"I realized most people are thinking the same thing and worrying about themselves more than listening to me, or they are not truly listening.  I tell myself If it’s “small talk” most people move on and forget the conversation quickly.   It’s really only important to me.  They’ve forgotten it so ease up in yourself.  Most people are judging themselves not others"
socialanxiety,fdmwbvg,t3_em89av,1578568814.0,Stop thinking about it because THAT was the perfect answer!
suboxone,fdbn4jq,t1_fdbk2g0,1578259056.0,"You know I can’t answer how I stopped, it just happened and was the right time for me.  Actually, it was this group!!!!   After reading posts on here I stated to take note of how I was really feeling during the day while on it.   I felt a lot more anxious, and irritable when I was taking it more frequently.   When I stated taking less and found I could still “feel it”  I knew taking more would actually ruin that feeling so I resisted.   Hope that makes sense.  I didn’t think I could do it but I realized I didn’t need it.  Now many days I forget to take the 2nd dose (I love when that happens)  I have been on it 15 years though, so it’s definitely time for me to take less!   It can’t be good to have this in your system as your body ages.   Not sure when, or if, I’ll get off.  I just really wanted to quit the addict behavior of reaching for something to change my mood."
alcoholism,fdbgyry,t3_ekhird,1578257283.0,Can you move out?  This has to be hard on your young marriage.  It is time for you 2 to start your own lives together.  Let them live in their mess.
suboxone,fdbfuqg,t3_ekejbj,1578256983.0,"When I first came here back in August the first post I read was one about less being more.  Back then I would take some in the am and then throughout the day I would just pop 4mg in whenever I thought I needed  a “pick me up”.  I am sure many days I took up to 16, maybe even more (I am prescribed 8-16 a day) Now I take it 2x a day at the exact same time and never really feel the need to take more.  (Well that’s not totally true I do feel an urge but not as often and it’s easier to ignore now). I was so surprised to find that less is really more!!   Try it!"
suboxone,fda60e6,t3_ekejbj,1578242177.0,"How much Suboxone are you taking a day?   I mean I have all those symptoms, but it’s because of menopause not the Suboxone.    Maybe lowering the dose will help.  I recently lowered my dose from 8-12 msg a day to 4-6. and I still feel great results from it.  I actually feel much better."

socialanxiety,fcp0w5a,t3_eicf5y,1577847074.0,"Me.   5 years in a row now.  Just me, the dog and sex and the city marathon."
socialanxiety,fch2abr,t3_eh9tn7,1577646610.0,"This is exactly how I feel.   At first it sounds great but the closer it gets to meeting up the more I don’t want to go.  I get really anxious/annoyed when I get texts with dates/times of a get together.   I do much better when things happen organically with out a plan.  I do find when I go I warm up and end up happy I went.  I don’t always feel anxiety when I am with dear friends ( others are a different story)   For years I drank to overcome this feeling and now I just acknowledge it and work with it.   I try not to think about it, push all anxious thoughts out of my head and just meet them like i am going to the gym, knowing once I am there it will be fine.   I don’t know if this is actually “social anxiety” but I think almost everyone feels this to some degree.   If you succumb to the feeling you will start to isolate yourself which is definitely not good"
suboxone,fc93gkn,t1_fc90d0n,1577546409.0,Just make sure you get on a dosing schedule.  Like once in am and then pm.  Same time every day.   Don’t deviate from that schedule and as badly as you might want to don’t take extra on any one day just cause you need it.   When you do this it becomes just another substance that takes a hold of you.  You should not feel high when you take it.  Instead you should just  feel “good”.   Truly LESS IS MORE.  I recently learned that from this page.  Good Luck.

suboxone,fc8vxop,t3_ego745,1577542890.0,"It works for me!  Been on it 15 years.   When I was addicted to Percocet I  use to wish they made an opiate based antidepressant, and then I went on Suboxone.   however, I had been taking way to much over the years as I was prescribed 8-16 mg a day.  Fluctuating between doses was not good because there’s were too many ups and downs.  Because if information I read on here (less is more) I lowered my dose to what you are on and I feel great!    I find most people on this sub want to get off Suboxone but there are plenty of us who love it and unfortunately you won’t read about it because they are too busy living life 
Just keep trying to take the least amount you can.  Once you are stable on it you could even see results  taking it every other day.   As far as getting off it down the line, remember all antidepressants will cause WD’s when you taper.  Everything messes with your brain chemistry.    I had 3 months of anxiety when I simply cut my dose of Wellbutrin in 1/2.   Good luck."

suboxone,fby1zqw,t3_eexvo8,1577206158.0,"Yes. I’m prescribed clonazepam, but he gives me very little only for panic attacks."
opiates,fblk6x9,t1_fbl7y4u,1576964186.0,"Yes the high will go away, but I still feel a bit of an energy boost that lasts a few hours.   But now that you know a high can be achieved it’s a possibility you might always take more to seek it.   You should be concerned about heading toward another addiction if you are not careful.  If you feel a high you are taking too much.  Someone should really hold it for you.   Read the posts on the Suboxone page.   This medication is really hard to get off of."
