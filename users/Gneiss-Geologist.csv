toastme,fegxmq5,t1_fegvbz2,1579104810.0,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression.  Anxiety is always there but I tend to go through what my Therapist calls Major depressive episodes. They started me on medications which essentially sucked all of life’s emotions away. Which I did not like. I know this sounds simple and obviously is not a cure all but after more than a decade of this I’m finding that meditation and practicing mindfulness of my emotions has allowed me to process these feelings better than any other treatment. 

Spending time each day to analyze my own feelings and tracing them back to their origin has been helpful. For instance. I’ll be driving, angrily. Just seething at everything that I see.  Then I’ll start thinking “Whoa man. You’re infuriated. You are. You know you are. How did we end up here.?”  

And I’ll start searching back through my days emotions to identify when I went from my general state to angry. 

“Was it when I started my car?  No I was angry then. Was it when I was brushing my teeth?  No I was angry then. I woke up this way?  No I woke up alright. When did this start?  Well I began thinking about ‘workplace boss that makes me anxious’. Then I started getting ready for work. I guess I was dreading every step towards my job. And I defensively turned this into anger to avoid my actual fear and anxietyl

When I say I practice this I mean I have to spend time each day to reflect on how I feel. Whether it’s good or bad. I start tracking it back to the influences that brought me to the state I’m in.  Sometimes there’s no reason. Sometimes I have to just say ‘my physiological state is lacking dopamine. Lacking reward. I feel sad today because my brains not pumping satisfaction. Now how do I usually gain some satisfaction (in a healthy way)?

I’m not saying you NEED to start doing this. But maybe start thinking about considering this practice. I’m still me, I’m just learning a little bit more about how my brain computer works with different stimuli.  And learning what actually gives me feelings instead of what I should feel is the battle. 

Listen bud if you’re ever feeling really down please DM me.  That’s not hollow. I take pride in not aligning with ideologies to pretend I’m helping the world, I try and support those I can actually interact with. So realize you have a friend out here that will listen and truthfully respond. 

God speed my friend. Every day is a brand new chance to work towards your desired goal. The scoreboard resets every single day.

toastme,fegv420,t3_eoznk6,1579103213.0,Let me put it this way. I want to be friends with you. Do you live in NY?
AmItheAsshole,fedcmut,t1_fectvk0,1579007689.0,"This is my exact life.  My parents have always showed clear financial favoritism towards my brother. They loaned him and I $50k each for graduate school. He paid back ~$5k and that stopped. I’ve paid back $23k and continue to give a thousand a month. I’m doing objectively better in my career. Clearing great money, continue to publish in my field, life is progressing wonderfully. But there were times it was tough to pay rent so I kind of lost it one day and confronted my father about this obvious favoritism. Keep in mind my father is my best friend and he carries no malice or ill will towards either of us. His response.

“Much like my parents told me, in our family it’s always those that need help that get it. You have the ability to get through anything and come out stronger. I’m not stealing that from you”

And he’s absolutely right. OP is probably viewed as the more independent self-reliant sibling. And although it may seem unfair. Hopefully he’ll hear the words I heard one day. Because everything changed after that. My resentment was replaced with pride and understanding.  And I’ll be damned he was right all along. Love that man."

trashy,fcn3quo,t1_fcm97zg,1577802443.0,"It’s a term that should be used appropriately, which it rarely is.  Started from a play in the 1930s that was later adapted to film. The antagonist uses denial, contradiction, and manipulation to convince the victim that they’re not seeing changes in the gaslight.  She ends up being convinced that she’s lost touch with reality despite seeing it clearly. She was gaslighted. 

We should be using it in psychological terms for someone that’s actively manipulated you into believing that your truth is flawed. That something that looks, acts, and quacks like a duck is not a duck. If you’re accusing your boyfriend of seeing other people because he has a bunch of DMs filled with selfies from other women.  And he convinces you that they’re just friends and that you have insecurity issues, while he knows he’s cheating. Then he’s gaslighting you."
