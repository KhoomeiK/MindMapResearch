WatchRedditDie,ff1vs70,t1_ff1uflf,1579487290.0,"Actually it was kind of implied by one of Jesus's sayings,""give unto Caesar what is Caesars and the church the church."" Catholicism is pretty flexible, they have reformed the church many times and reinterpreted the Bible to adapt to changing times. In fact they widely supported natural philosophy. Monks were able to read and write generally and had time on their hands. I'm not religious but there has been a huge benefit from Christianity on the western world. The bad rap it gets is not wholly deserved. It has fallen behind with modern society but I think there is still a place and need for a moral belief structure based on it. The ""death of God""as Nietzsche put could be responsible for the rise of the sjw religious dogma.

I'm not hugely educated on Islam but if you're interested in learning about it more and it's incompatibilities with western philosophy and thinking look at Sam Harris, really educated bloke."

todayilearned,fdifuei,t1_fdhjd3l,1578441954.0,"There is an additional problem in all of this in that there is a huge influx of immigrants into Europe. These people need places to live, places to work. The land use in Europe will only increase. We already have incredibly dense populations as it is and then you have to factor in the rise of renewables which require large amounts of land to build on to provide energy in a very inefficient manner.

This is also not mentioning the need for recreational Land."
todayilearned,fdf9xd6,t1_fdefu3p,1578356733.0,"The problem is the land in Europe is more valuable, fertile (ruling out exceptions like parts of Scandinavia and Spanish deserts). The Amazon rainforest is being deforested because the soil is poor and so they have to create essentially throwaway fields which are only good for a few growing seasons before they have nutrient deficiencies."
todayilearned,fdf8e28,t1_fde9n9b,1578355693.0,"Certainly. 

If we reforested the fertile land of Europe, we would require a source of food. We import a lot of our food from the third world anyway but this would have to increase. This would lead to rapid deforestation in these countries for crops. Unfortunately, rainforest soil is really infertile. This is part of the reason the Amazon is being burnt at such a rate. The fields are only useful for a short time before the nutrients are gone. But this is where our food would have to come from if we reforested the whole of Europe. The starvation would be caused when there's an inevitable drought in the Amazon river basin due to the changed microclimate. I.e. no big ass trees transpiring. 

If you want a solution to carbon sequester then look no further then bio char and terrapreta. Solves soil leeching and improves soil quality and yield. Win/win.

In conclusion while reforesting large areas in Europe sounds like a nice idea even partially, it foists our problems onto the 3rd world. This view may be a bit negative but it is my view on the consequences."

todayilearned,fddwc6r,t1_fddtwtp,1578325575.0,This is the same for every European country not in Scandinavia. These comparisons really frustrate me because if ever European country were to reforest at this rate we'd have global famine and no rainforest.
todayilearned,fddw5is,t3_ektb9t,1578325448.0,Lmao. If Europe planted that many trees there would be nowhere to live and people would be starving.
