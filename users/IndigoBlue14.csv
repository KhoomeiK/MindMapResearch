facepalm,fdgqqrc,t1_fdgnlev,1578405856.0,"This is an article from a pro-farming source interviewing an expert which clearly states that the way we have bred sheep over time has caused them to grow wool much quicker and cease naturally shedding. He also says this coat overgrowth is unhealthy and detrimental to the animal, and additionally that sheep are distressed by the process of shearing. Sheep naturally shed their coats when living wild, we have bred them not to do that.

Again, this is a pro-farming article, interviewing a farming expert.

https://modernfarmer.com/2013/07/will-sheep-wool-grow-forever/

Here is an article from Business Insider talking about merino sheep being bred to never shed and continually grow wool.

Unlike wild sheep, who shed most of their wool every year, merino sheep don't periodically lose their hair. They just keep growing more wool, which is exactly what sheep farmers want.

""In the 13th and 14th centuries, Spanish sheep herders let their local sheep breed with English sheep. The result was the merino — a sheep that doesn't even qualify as a freak of nature because Mother Nature would never make such an animal. They are an evolutionary nightmare that humans made.

That's because these sheep cannot shed wool on their own, a vital survival trait for sheep in the wild. Merino sheep need humans to shear their wool for them. These sheep can produce between 10 to 40 pounds of wool each year.""

facepalm,fdgno0b,t1_fdgjs1w,1578403324.0,Absolutely. There are a large number of breeds of sheep which we haven't horrendously messed with as a species and still roam wild in Scotland.
facepalm,fdgn5yr,t1_fdgjh4q,1578402882.0,"Yeah they did, but the actions of prehistoric humans should hardly justify our morality today. Regardless of what you think about wearing wool, we should not be inbreeding animals to the point of them becoming dangerously unhealthy out of a desire to get more money out of them as with 'farm' animals, or out of a desire to make them cute like with dogs.

We have bred spaniels to have squished up faces which mean they have epilepsy as their brains are too big for their skulls, all because we think it's cute. We have bred chickens to the point where they grow so quickly their legs can't support the weight of their bodies. It grows quickly, but it's cruel and the meat tastes awful.

We should be breeding healthier varieties of this animal, if we're breeding them at all."
facepalm,fdgmzej,t1_fdgjaz7,1578402719.0,"Or maybe if we're breeding sheep for wool we should not use the inbred, unhealthy breeds that we are currently using? It's out of pure corporate greed that we've bred them to produce wool so quickly, and bred cows and chickens to produce meat so quickly.

If we want to wear animal products and eat animal products we should accept that these things are slow growing and valuable and only breed healthier animals and better breeds. There are still small farmers, here in the UK at least, breeding 'heritage' variety cattle, pigs and sheep which are far healthier animals with greater well-being.

AmItheAsshole,fdghqnx,t1_fdgfvl2,1578397309.0,"That's a very suspicious and paranoid attitude to have. The reason you pay a professional - or seek help through medical care if you can avoid paying - is literally because they are a trained and educated professional. They're skilled in listening and getting people to open up about themselves and consider things they had never considered before. Its extremely beneficial to have someone to talk your difficulties through with, who had no stake or investment other than your wellbeing and happiness.

Psychologists are very different to counsellors.  Counsellors and therapists don't tend to medicalise their work.
