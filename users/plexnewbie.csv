reddeadredemption2,ff38xiq,t3_erd6mf,1579536476.0,"I play on PC but the mechanic should be the same. I never fought for more than maybe 2-3 mins on the largest legendary fish. You set the hook, reel in max speed, and anytime the fish is fighting (splashes) do not pull your rod up/back and immediately stop reeling. Only pull the rod to the left or right (try to combat their motion) and once they stop trashing, reel at max speed and drop the tip of the rod down towards the water and rapidly back/up towards the air and keep doing it until you reel in the fish. Always stop reeling and pulling up/back when the fish is thrashing. Rinse and repeat. If it doesn't make sense maybe I can take a clip of what I do to show you. I also read another comment to remap the reel to a button instead, I think that's a great idea. On PC you hold space to reel and on controller IIRC you have to spin the stick around like a mad man."

I got one in July and I can't tell you how much better sleeping and waking up has been. No more interruptions in my sleep. I damn near piss my bed because I sleep through the entire night whereas I used to go to the bathroom several times a night during restlessness. No more waking up with a pounding chest and a headache. Waking up gracefully has made my morning tenfold better. Since July I think there have been 3 nights where I haven't used it and it was due to unforeseen circumstances. CPAPs get a bad rep for being large, loud, uncomfortable etc., but these days they're the size of a desktop alarm clock and make far less noise than someone snoring, and the masks are not very invasive at all."
