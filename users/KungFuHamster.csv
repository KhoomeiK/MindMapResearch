I'm thinking about a corner stand unit for some of my devices; anything I need to put a disc in is a good candidate.

I've purchased some shorter HDMI cables and run the shorter ones where they'll fit, but I really need to re-work everything, and maybe get some intermediate sized cables where the shorts are too short and the longs are too long.

I've got an 8-port gigabit switch in the console and it's pretty full. I'm also thinking of ditching wires for the devices that have wifi and/or don't really need it, like the bluray player.

I've bought a lot of cable management gear over the years, including a roll of velcro and some raceways, but I never seem to have the time to redo everything.
