TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff74so6,t3_eru9eo,1579641124.0,I get ya! Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and can‚Äôt get out of bed and then feel guilty for staying in bed. My advice is to allow yourself to feel low in those low moments. Allow your body to rest. Just try to kick it back into gear within the next few days. If you can‚Äôt then you may have clinical depression (which I have).

science,ff02qr9,t1_fezr6av,1579464538.0,I had 5 surgeries in  3 years and doctors told me to deal with the pain which led me buying opioids from people to get relief. I wanted to kill myself because of my chronic pain and would cry to the doctors telling them I was drinking to cope with the pain. I‚Äôm clean now but this horror story has given me PTSD and a much lower tolerance for pain/anxiety/depression.

dogs,fekdcx3,t1_fejoagy,1579197680.0,"Absolutely. Not all dogs get along and shit like this happens if there‚Äôs not adequate supervision. I would not label this dog as a ‚Äúdangerous dog‚Äù legally speaking - I do not know Aus terms but typically that designation is for dogs that bite people. My dog is dog selective and has gotten grumpy and gone after other dogs, luckily no major damage was done because I supervise my dog and never leave him with dogs that are not a similar size. A large dog can kill a smaller dog just in play so this seems like an overreaction and irresponsible puppy ownership."

Instagramreality,feadaa1,t3_eo455k,1578947216.0,So I always thought I was WEIRD because my neck had a crease when I turned my head. I even had a photographer tell me to angle my head so my neck didn‚Äôt crease (not possible).  Turns out most photos are photoshopped to remove said crease.
