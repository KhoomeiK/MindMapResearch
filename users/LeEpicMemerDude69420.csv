fatlogic,fdohh8j,t1_fdobs3u,1578605237.0,"> As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism—a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight. Keeping weight off means fighting your body’s energy-regulation system and battling hunger all day, every day, for the rest of your life.

I've lost 19% of my body weight and haven't experienced this ""slowdown in your metabolism"". I don't feel cold, I'm not hungry all day, and I've never regained a significant amount of weight. My BMR has dropped, but only because my body has less mass to keep alive. I'd love to see the study they're referencing."

>	Writing another human being off completely because they have a child from a previous relationship is the exact type of thing that prevents all you dumbfucks from getting laid and finding meaningful relationships and human connections in the first place. 

>	And the sad part? If a woman with a child showed you the slightest bit of attention you’d fall all over yourself to ask what time the kid needed to be picked up from school and if she needs any help. 

>	You’re all just talk. It’s so goddamn lame.

>	And all y’all replying, clearly your feelings are hurt. A hit dog’ll holler and what not.

You don’t want to raise someone else’s kid for a crumb of pussy? Yikes, ok incel."
