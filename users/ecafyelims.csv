I think you mean the colors do not predicate good or bad side. The colors do, mostly, indicate good or bad because the Sith use red lightsabers. They aren't able to properly wield the other colors due to the force's interaction with the kyber crystals within the swords.

Sith use red lightsabers because:

> Sith lightsabers, also known as Sith sabers and sometimes referred to as laser swords, were the lightsabers wielded by members of the Sith. They were constructed through methods similar to those used by other Force-sensitives, but the underlying philosophy was different. **Unlike users of the light side of the Force, Sith couldn't establish a mutual bond with kyber crystals.** This was due to the hate, fear and other emotions associated with the dark side that clouded their concentration.

> In the construction of a Sith lightsaber, individuals partook in a process known as bleeding. **By ways of the Force, they would pour negative emotions such as rage, hate, fear and pain into kyber crystals. The process would result in the crystals gaining a distinctive crimson or red hue.** Any kyber crystal could be bled for use in a Sith lightsaber, though some Sith believed that the proper method to gain a crystal involved capturing one from a Jedi lightsaber.

> https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_lightsaber

So, definitely yes, the color of the lightsaber will (mostly) indicate good or bad side."

Depends on the plants. A diet high in processed sugars certainly won't help reduce your risk of diabetes, and as far as I know, plant based diets won't actually reverse diabetes. I have read studies though that fasting for extended periods of time will reverse diabetes though ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/intermittent-fasting-and-type-2-diabetes)).

She walked over to the guy (edit: flopped out her boobs) and smiled. The guy looked up at her, and then he looked back down to his phone. That's it. -- He never said a word or even changed his blank expression.

It was priceless. I wish I could find that video to share.
