AdviceAnimals,ff91qsk,t1_ff8veou,1579702677.0,"Always take your medications you are on with you. My blood pressure meds where like $60 each, yet I had a 3 month supply at home that was $10. So after the first day I sent someone home to grab my meds. Probably saved me $100s over the course of   a few days when I was admitted and had some kidney stones blasted."

AskReddit,ff3cohq,t1_ff2uzis,1579538515.0,"I was crouched down and stapling something on the floor. It was kinda under me as I stapled the thing between my legs. I slipped and fell and the stapler just went ""whoosh"" right into my bottom. Did I mention I had just got out of the shower and was not dressed yet? Freak accident."

RelationshipAdviceNow,fdqvdmy,t1_fdpmvn0,1578675428.0,This should be further up. Somethings are best left as a fantasy or at a rollplay level because that's what they are..a fantasy; not real life. The 3rd person can take a part of the relationship you cherished with them when they leave.

RelationshipAdviceNow,fdqubam,t1_fdpaj4c,1578675012.0,"Yes, I can speak from experience. When the 3rd person leaves the room they take some of the relationship with them. This ruined a wonderful thing with a great women that I really cared about. It wont be the same for everyone and that's cool; everyones different. If you are not both totally on the same page it can be disastrous over time. Somethings are best kept at the fantasy and roleplay level because that's what they are.. a fantasy; not real life."

I think she gained 13 or so pounds by the time she went into labor. Way less than expected and everyone was saying she was unhealthy. Son was perfectly healthy and is 5 now. The unsolicited ""advice"" from friends, family and co-workers almost drove us crazy. Looked like she was smuggling a beachball."

My total debt to be paid back was around 8k not to shabby for the us. However they could have help me find a job. I busted my ass in HS and applied for pretty much every little scholarship. I even got like $2500 for being left handed. It can be done but takes planning many years in advance.

worldnews,fd6dsoy,t1_fd65ner,1578189442.0,Insurance agent here. We now call it a terrorist risk endorsement and 99% of people decline it. It covers compensation at 80%. However it must be declared a terrorist attack by the state department. That is one of the reasons that the US is so reluctant to declare our home grown terrorism attacks as such because it means the government will be responsible for 20% of damages capped at a few billion. Declaring something a terrorist attack effects who pays for what. Pretty interesting no?

atheism,fcu9zz4,t3_eiuexq,1577976080.0,It is like they completely ignor the separation of church and state. They just do not care. Embarrassing for a law maker to try such a stunt. Clearly they do not understand and follow the constitution. They should be removed for lacking the basic understanding of our constitution.
science,fcu9ixm,t1_fcsws7g,1577975742.0,"Yes, being in the US I have found Tinder to be very effective in finding random sexual partners. You most likely won't find a soul mate on Tinder, you may, but you can find someone or something to do on a Friday/Saturday night. For me it is usually a week delayed; match on Friday and meet up the next weekend. I hate the social thing of not responding immediately and girls waiting a few days (we both know your phone notified you); guys do it to I suppose. This all varies person to person I believe. It helps if you don't resemble Quasimodo in your photos."
