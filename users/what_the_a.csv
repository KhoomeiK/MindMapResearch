AskReddit,ff3yqbt,t3_ergjyj,1579551772.0,"I was 17 and on this particular night, I was the only person covering a huge section of the floor at the clothing store I worked at. I had completely refolded and stacked a HUGE table of shirts. Like, 10-15 shirts per stack, probably 15 shirts on the whole table, and they had to be absolutely perfectly folded. The table was a disaster, literally in complete disarray, because people are horrible. Anyway, it took me a long time but i finally go it all sorted out. It's ten minute to closing, so I'm thinking, okay, this is great, it probably won't get horribly messed up again. 

In comes Frantic Lady. Several times a week this lady showed up ten minutes to closing, frantically needing shirts and pants, always talking into her bluetooth ear piece that you couldn't see through her crazy hair. (Numerous times I thought she was talking to me so I responded and she snapped at me that she was on the phone.) 

Anyway, I saw her come in but I stepped into the fitting room for like 3 minutes to get a rack of go-backs, and I come out to find she has DEMOLISHED the table I just folded. Like, went to every shirt, grabbed the one on the bottom and yanked it up and out, sending all the shirts above it toppling into piles. I just stood there, jaw on the floor, eyes wide watching her. She sees my face and scurries away. She only bought like 1 thing in the end. 

I oscillated between wanting to cry and seething rage. She was so rude. I still feel enraged when i think about it."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fendazo,t1_fekxxtu,1579282234.0,"I want this to be more visible! Lots of neurological conditions and trauma to the brain can dramatically change your personality and it can be devastating to the people around you. 

I had a friend whose family member had an inoperable brain tumor. He went from being a super loving, generous, pot smoking hippie musician to a super right-wing conspiracy theorist. He stopped having an interest in music, which was his entire life before, and sat around and watched Fox News all day. He had never had an inkling of that in his character ever. It just completely changed his entire personality. He also made some unwise/out of character financial decisions which resulted in some legal situations after he died but.. the point is that anything that impacts your brain can 100% change things you think are absolutely inherent to your personality."

I don’t hAve the muscle memory, the hand eye coordination, the controllers confuse me. There’s also like a context that if you don’t have someone explain to you, you won’t get. And movement patterns that if you don’t know, you’re kinda always confused about why you’re not able to do things you think you should be able to do. Also there’s the fact that gamers can be... gatekeepy? Anyway, I tried a few times with an ex but he’d get so frustrated that I was slow and didn’t react quickly enough or he’d have to keep reminding me things that he’d just snatch the controller away and I’d sit there watching him play (he was a butthead generally).

It wasn’t until I started dating my current SO that I could actually learn. He was just super patient and explained everything to me multiple times, reminded me of what buttons I needed to press, directed me around and basically told me where to go and what to do until I got the hang of it. He also realized how much he took for granted that he’d learned really young that it’s just ingrained in his understanding now it’s second nature.

AskReddit,fdhzjk6,t1_fdhy0r5,1578433032.0,"Then ""it is what it is"" doesn't apply. It's not defeatist the way I think about it, its about cultivating peace and acceptance for things that aren't within your realm of control. 

For example, if I take the statement ""I'm broke"" or ""i hate my job"" and applied ""it what it is,"" without looking into the reasons why, I might never learn how to not be broke or try to get a new job, which is obviously not good. But I tend to apply it more to things that aren't in my control and knowing how to pick your battles and cultivating acceptance for certain situations and facts of life is important. For example, I also have a chronic illness and have spent many, many years trying to figure out the ""cause"" or how I can make it go away. But I can't. I just got it, I have it, at this point nothing will cure it and nothing will change the effect it has on my life. Continually asking ""why"" just makes me more miserable because it keeps my in a constant state of searching for something that isn't there. It is what it is. 

I didn't say you should never ask why, I just said sometimes it doesn't matter. You can understand all the factors at play, and that will always help you be a better, more well-rounded person, but it still doesn't mean you're going to be able to make it the way you want it. Therefore, it is what it is."

We could bring things out but then we had to put it back. Anything like coats or shoes or backpacks had an assigned spot in the laundry room. 

She also did this nightly decluttering/tidy thing where she’d go through each room with a laundry basket and collect stuff that didn’t belong there and drop it off in whichever/whoever’s room it belonged in. We generally had to clean out rooms and keep them tidy but she wasn’t overly concerned with how we went about that, it was more getting it back to a state of visual tidiness. For example, my oldest sister was and is super organized by nature (no joke, she had a binder of pictures of all her clothing and accessories and would plan out her outfits for the week). I on the other hand shoved things in my closet and under my bed and my mom was kinda like meh, it’s who you are lol. 

In terms of cleaning, she cleaned a little everyday and we did our chores on the weekends.

minimalism,fcxxf41,t3_ejdbnh,1578071803.0,"It really doesn't sound that extreme to me. You sound a lot like my SO, who I now live with. He can fit all of his belongings in a 4 door car, not counting his mattress. At first I was always trying to buy him more clothes or whatever because it seemed like he was deprived. I now see that he's perfectly fine and it was just my own sort of consumer-driven mindset that made that lifestyle seem wrong or uncomfortable to me. After living with him and seeing that he's not deprived or sad, it's made me reflect on my own relationship to things and I'm slowly but surely paring back and letting go."
explainlikeimfive,fcxl5bz,t3_ejfl0v,1578065586.0,"So I’m no expert but I have Fibromyalgia/chronic pain so I kinda understand the experience closely. My pain is mostly muscular, so assuming what you’re describing is also muscular, here’s how I think about it:

When I sleep in a non-neutral position, it either over stretches or contracts a muscle for extended periods of time. My body “thinks” there is damage being done, and tenses the area to protect the body. The creates long lasting tension or even a spasm that has to be released. 

Probably the pain lasts for a few days then goes away because it eventually works itself out and the tension releases. In my case that rarely happens on its own so I have to do a lot of stretching and self massage to get things unclenched. Obviously you can do that too. Sometimes taking magnesium can help too, in addition to anti-inflammatoires like ibuprofen. 

Also everything in your body is connected so sometimes you have to release and stretch other area to feel relief in the area that actually hurts. This is where a physical therapist or someone who understands body mechanics is helpful if you have nagging pain you can’t figure out on your own.


EDIT: genuinely curious why I’m getting downvoted. Because I’m not an expert or I presented something incorrectly?"
CleaningTips,fcw94wl,t1_fcw0as8,1578019997.0,Very good advice!!!
CleaningTips,fcvx4hs,t3_ej6l9r,1578012091.0,"Been there, friend. 

1. Weather permitting, open your curtains/blinds and a window. 

2. Put on music or a movie/show you’ve seen a bunch and don’t need to pay attention to. 

3. Set a timer for 15 minutes. You can do something for fifteen minutes. If you’re wiped after fifteen, stop there for today and pick it up tomorrow. Start in this order: 

— Garbage (just grab and toss into garbage bag) 

— Clothing. At the very least, put it into one pile so you have visible floor space. This will feel good immediately. If you’re feeling more ambitious, divide into categories for laundry and get it into a laundry basket or hamper. Put away clothes that are clean. 

— Take à basket or box and collect all the stuff that doesn’t belong in that room. Dishes, food, random other stuff that shouldn’t be there. Get it out of the room, you can put it elsewhere later. 

— organize/group things into categories. So gather your books together, papers, toiletries, etc etc. If things have a home, start putting gun em away. 

— once the room is tidy, you can actually clean. Strip the bed, lift things up and wipe down surfaces. Use water and a cloth if that’s all you have right now. Vacuum. 

— Put on clean sheets. 

— do your laundry. 

Don’t worry if you can’t do it all in a day or a week. Just do 15 minutes at a time. You’d be amazed how quickly you can make noticeable progress. Best of luck to you!"

books,fcuufwt,t1_fcuryny,1577988735.0,"I know what English classes are for -- I have a degree in English Lit. My point wasn't that it should be purely for enjoyment, but that including some more updated options would be beneficial to exposing students to different types of writing. What's the point of learning analysis, gaining a greater understanding language, etc if you never pick anything up to read again?  (This is a larger discussion on education, though.)

Also, you're probably right that YA Sci Fi isn't the right genre to educational purposes, but there are plenty of other more contemporary works out there that would fit the bill, and different genres worth exploring. I did my senior thesis in college on graphic novels -- it has just as much literary value as anything else."
books,fcuo6yq,t3_eixln2,1577985161.0,"I think this is super important to encouraging reading in young people. I think schools turn a lot of people off of reading because of the book choices. I have an English degree and people are always shocked when I haven't read a lot of classics. I'm not opposed to them, I just kinda know what a lot of them are about at this point and I know some of them aren't my jam. I truly believe high school reading lists should include contemporary works and other genres besides literary fiction. Get some graphic novels, humor writers, and essayists in there. My love of reading really came alive again as a teenager when my older sister lent me David Sedaris and I stumbled across Christopher Moore -- I was like, OH books can be funny *and* meaningful.  


The older I get, the more I find I like specific authors more than genres or subjects. Once I find a writer I like, I just go through their catalog. I recently discovered a funny murder mystery series and I plowed through all 6 of the books in a month or so. It's not gonna win any literary prizes, but I genuinely enjoy sitting down to read them and that's kinda the point, no matter what genre."

I didn’t even know I did that until a boyfriend pointed it out, and mentioned it around my mom who told me I’ve done that since I was a baby. I never fought sleep—they’d put me in my crib and I’d do my wiggle and sigh and be happy as a clam."

But one that I remember fondly is this time I showed up at a house party in college and saw a girl from my French class. I knew everyone else there and said hi to everyone on the porch before going inside, including the girl from my class. We had been conversation partners in class earlier that day so I felt confident giving her a solid greeting. I was like “oh hey, nice to see you again!” She said hi in this really weird way and I kinda figured she didn’t recognize me but I just kinda rolled with it and went inside. I stopped right on the other side of the door to get something out of my bag. She couldn’t see me but I could hear her saying she had no idea who I was and that she’d never met me before, in this really bitchy “what a loser” kind of tone. I was feeling bold, so I immediately poked my head out the door and said “we were partners in French class like 6 hours ago. We literally sat face to face and talked to each other for like an hour.” The other people on the porch kinda laughed and teased her for being an asshole and I went back inside."
