This year my work presented us with options for either regular ppo or high deductible plans, and when you did the math, there was almost no possible situation in which your total spending would be less with the regular plan. 

That said, we had a baby via c section who needed a week in the NICU a couple years back when we were on the low-deductible plan and immediately hit our $8000 family oopm, then last year my wife had cancer so we hit the $4000 individual oopm. This is in addition to the $6000/yr I pay in premiums on top of the premiums my company pays that I think are even more than that. What a joke."

However when we moved in we did a bunch of work to make the house more efficient: replaced and reconfigured all the ducting (old stuff was leaking like crazy), fixed some leaks around the furnace, replaced a bunch of the windows, and had the attic insulation majorly upgraded. Definitely check your insulation and ducts at least, fixing those if they're lacking will pay for itself fairly quickly, and see if your local energy company offers any energy upgrade rebates. Our company paid for almost half the work we had done."
