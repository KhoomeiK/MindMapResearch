For me personally it took a few failed relationships before I met my wife, who took mercy upon me ;)

To keep my mind focused I exercise several times a week, something every day. For me I had to get a membership at a gym to exercise and to learn to build a strong mind and body. 

Now, if I have nothing to do one evening and my friends are busy and my wife is busy, I just hang out at the gym and do bicycle/rowing and using some weight lifting machines.

It‚Äôs never to late to do something! You are not even old! 

Join a gym tomorrow to grow your muscles and exercise your brain + join a charity organization or a church and help the less fortunate! 

For me, I always buy a hot coco for the young guy sleeping outside, before I go home to my warm apartment. 

And give your children ALL the LOVE they deserve. You are a very fortunate man to have children. Everyone is not that blessed.

Do something a little different and better everyday.

Ultralight,feg0xay,t1_fef32c7,1579072220.0,"1. Hiking boots do keep your feet dry => so they keep your feet warm. I don‚Äôt know what boots you refer to. To achieve this you just buy a larger shoe, like one size larger than normal, and wear merino liner + wool/synthetic socks. Change liners at lunch if you‚Äôre super-sweaty. 

2. Also hiking boots have much larger soles, which adds insulation towards the ground. In cold weather this also makes a significant difference. And, the air around your feet (from having a larger boot) gets warm and insulates the feet. The fact that you can successfully hike in trail runners does not mean the laws of physics stop applying. 

3. On ankle support: the question for me is not so much if your ankles can support you, but rather that a wrong step when you are really tired can
lead to spraining your ankle. In my boots I physically cannot bend my foot long enough to twist my ankle. This is due to the height of the boot. In this sense boots add to ankle stability. However, I do agree the best thing is to build up your own physical strength. Also, trail runners are a lot lighter, which of course helps."
HistoryMemes,feex4r8,t1_feeumva,1579043127.0,"That‚Äôs not entirely correct. 

Socialism in the sense of communism = yes., while Social democracy = no. 

However, all instances of socialism in the sense of communism resulted in EXTREME MASSMURDER of the population, 

So yes Nazism and Communism have a lot in common. They are both extreme ideologies on the far right and left, who don‚Äôt allow people to think differently and not agree with them. 

I‚Äôm afraid your picture of communism as only ‚Äúworkers owning the means of production‚Äù is dramatically incorrect.
