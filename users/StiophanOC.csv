It's not 'equal' for the sexes. It's bad/good in different ways depending on your gender and attractiveness.

If a woman is physically unattractive, her dating prospects will be greatly diminished.

If a man is physically unattractive, it will not hurt him as severe as for a woman.

If a woman is unintelligent, does the man care as long as he wants to see her naked?

If a man is unintelligent, he's judged more severely. It hurts him more.

OkCupid did a study on their own website _years_ ago and found that the average male on their website barely paid any attention to the words on a woman's...*any woman's* profile and almost entirely only cared about the pictures.

A stereotypical dumb model with fantastic images and a dull as dishwater written component? Men rated that profile as overall amazing.

A profile with no images/meh images but with the text part written by an amazing award-winning writer living an amazing life? Zero/One out of five stars.


For an article, another website made a profile on OkCupid which comprised - The photos of a model-friend of the author of the article and the text written to make the woman seem like a murderous psychopath. The result? A neverending avalanche of messages.

She could be using water _at times_ or some other coloured liquid. From [TV Tropes] (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeverageTropes) -

'Actors generally don't drink real alcohol on set, as the scenes have to be shot many times (making it disastrous if they used the real deal). Thus, water is used to simulate clear alcohols like gin, and steeped tea is used to simulate darker alcohols like bourbon.

Froth and fizz in these cases is mimicked by adding carbonated sodas. Or in some cases, if the actor isn't actually going to drink the concoction, they'll use soap.
Sometimes, they use things like apple juice or non-alcoholic cider, or substitute wine for sparkling fruit juice.'"
