JC does not want chain stores but they sure as shit don't want indpently owned stuff when some developer can come in , slap some trendy name a on bar like ashford and pretend to be all indie and casual while being owned by a group that is 60% owned by a mega realestate company and 40% owned by a bunch of dudes that love hoboken style frat bars

JC has finally jumped the shark - downtown developed because it was decently priced - had bars with style and felt homie and individual and part of the community.

PhoenixPoint,ffcrot6,t1_ffck5fc,1579805870.0,"The health and spawns are fine , except in lairs .  Its the armor where unless your cheesing or using grenade spam  , your doing zero damage. 

The fact that if you have the wrong balance of guys that most your team does nothing because they don't have OP skill yet is a huge problem.

At one point in the game if you send in guys with PP ARES and PP Shotguns - enemys can have enough armor where you wont do any damage at all with multiple guys.   This would not be too bad if it was like Xcom pods where it 3-4 guys your fighting at once as your probably have 1-2 guys that can do something like a sniper or heavy or 1 zerk. 

But in a game where 6-8 enemies can all converge at you at once , can kill your guys in 2 hits and you still only have 1-2 guys that can do anything to them before the other 5-6 guys on your team can do any damage to them is where the balance is off. 

If your not cheesing a bit your shaving off 40 HP of a 200hp guy that can kill you from twice the range your trying to damage him from in 2 hits. This  100% a balance issue.  

When your basic guys with normal to mid teir gear can do absolutely no damage to guys at range without a sniper taking a limb off , a zerk using their special or a heavy hitting with one of their weapons  there is something wrong. 

Even the with more advanced weapons their armor is so hard it can take 10 shots with a bulldog to kill one guy or 4-6 with the Armor piercing NJ gun if you have not dont some trick to shred their armor . 

The game needs a mix of other units - sure have the heavily armored units but put in 4x tritons with no armor at all .  Not every enemy should have nearly bulletproof armor on every part of their body , drop in some enemies that have none so now that AR rifle that does 20 damage with 20 pierce is not the god gun but vastly inferior to an ARES vs them .   This way your shredding guys to their jobs and your other lower teir soldiers and assaults with AR and shotguns have SOME USE if they ar ebelow level 4"

PhoenixPoint,ffccwgw,t1_ffc3uaf,1579796735.0,"IMO you should be able to research your allies stuff and ADD improvements to your own gear based on it .

ARES is 30x6  = 180   Bulldog is 4x40= 120.    But its damage really helps a lot with armor because when an enemy has 30 armor as they almost all do.   30x6 = 0.

&#x200B;

So instead of your junk vs their stuff you should get research to upgrade the ARES based on that new tech.   NJ Bulldog research - +5 Damage to ARES. For a while the NJ stuff would be better then your stuff but then you figure it out and make your stuff better so you can start building better stuff.

SYN Rifle Research = +5 range to ARES Rifles for example later +10 in a more advanced research 

Eventually make your AR jack of all trades - 35-38 Damage (still less then NJ Damage) , 25 Range - better but still less then SYN range and 10 piercing.

&#x200B;

PP should have all their weapons take small tech upgrades from their allies.   The Devs even kept saying about secret techs and stuff with combining the techs from various factions would great unique powerful tech  and in one run i had 75+ rep with all factions and only saw a few combo techs there were unimpressive Acid is next to useless since if a fight last more then 2 turns your gonna start dying .

They also are a bit better at working with the community on changes and communication - but snapshot is getting better with their new feedback system at least

Right now its a poorly paced , poorly balanced mess that is still missing a ton of features that the game was supposed to have at release and even if it had all the content it was SUPPOSED to have at release which it still doesn't it would still feel hallow and lacking in diversity compared to Xcom right now.  Its not even a poor mans Xcom yet  because of how bad the balance it 

&#x200B;

On the other hand This game has the potential to be one of the all time greats because of how well they set up the systems and the complexity in the game  but its going to take at least 6 more months to even be at release worthy level - even though this is a full release game its barely got the content or set up of an early access game right now.

Its a rare unique situation that really only matters to min maxer because most people are not going to care if their CPU is limiting their 3k ram to 2666  as its a very tiny performance bump 

Its a very complicated balance between the GPU , CPU and Ram , but these days most games have a low CPU load since the GPU does all the heavy lifting and the Ram just needs to be able to transfer the date to the GPU in large enough volume while also talking to the CPU.

like i said it gets super complicated but again its really not a big deal unless your super uptight about plaing MAX FPS on highest graphics setting or yoru playing competitively.

In your case you might actually be better off with i7 as music / video production can be CPU heavy so you want a CPU that can take a heavier CPU load ."

On pro side is a systemic failure only kills off one section and maybe a couple domes.   So it doesnt start a cascade that takes everything out.     Things can be repaired and humans replaced eventually just a big set back.

&#x200B;

Now your need to dash 3-4 guys to or hope it does one of its more useless attacks when your guys are next to it .   One easy way to do it , is take off its head , reduce its will , and Mind control it then beat on it with the melee stun guns. after you get guys in position.

Lairs have double the AP and you can't super dash to them and kill them in 1 turn because of the AP cost .   So garunteed to take 3-5 turns MIN if not more while you get beat up on by endless spawns"
PhoenixPoint,ff3zcnw,t1_ff3nu0h,1579552160.0,"I think their priorities are out of whack and even they know it , their new feed back system is really wise and seems like a way for them to try to tackle the issues that will make the most people happy first.  The world , the engine , the design , the system are all A+ and this game has MASSIVE potential .

&#x200B;

This seems like poor management decisions - you should never Take away things from your player base with out good explanation , most smart games take a give and take approach .  This one had massive player nerfs without addressing the balance issue to in effect it makes the game harder just for making it harders sake.   So now you have many not fun missions (liars) that are even LESS fun.

&#x200B;

The burden of that making the game worse i think pushes it past the breaking point for most ,  the fact the balance was so bad but can be overcome with OP player skills almost makes the game fun .  But now they went too far in the other direction in the enemies favor .

&#x200B;

Liar are a nightmare now if you don't stealth cheese it .  Hurt guys , resource drain , extremely time consuming , straight boring  since it just the same map with tiny path variations .

&#x200B;

The game is still incomplete so im taking break and giving them time to fix it ill come back after a few more patches and DLC and mods but i don't think a lot of people are going to come back .  They either took the money and ran or figure in 6 more months to a year they will have a functional game that will spread by word of mouth base on how good it became .  It doesn't happen often but it has happened with several games (looking at your paradox) that have started off bad and after big overhauls got good word of mouth and become good games"

PhoenixPoint,ff3w56c,t3_erhlo1,1579550153.0,"\- Lairs. Oh god. This is what made me quit. The first couple of lairs are ok

&#x200B;

Yep - the reason people cheesed them was they were just not fun.  Most people that play these games like to set their own difficulty or pace where the difficulty in this game doesn't seem to matter . But you have unlimited enemies that spawn in every turn that force you to rush.  If you don't cheese it between rushing and fighting hordes your gonna get guys hurt.   And the end you end up several clips down and if you used rockets/ grenades - hundreds in materials cost for no reward .

&#x200B;

They are knock down drag out fights with no rewards - take forever if you don't cheese them and can easily turn bad because of random spawns or bad spawn points.   Most the liars i have done post patch that were easy was because sometimes the spawn points still end up on ledges where they can't get to you.

&#x200B;

You can still cheese them with 100% stealth but by the time you get infils and a guy with thief your probably already done 4-6 of them.

&#x200B;

The start of the game  is prefect they nailed that at least - its when your armor no longer competes with their and your weapons don't do anything but ping off them that the game starts to turn if you don't have exactly the right guys with the right skills yet .

&#x200B;

**I can only hope the devs are reading the forms here and see how many people have been saying they are putting the game away because of the liar missions now and make some reasonable adjustments .   Limited enemies , No Chirons in a cave - cause if the roof is that high no reason you can't just airstrike or drop in on the liar directly - put the liar in the middle where it only takes 1-2 turns - then after its dead you still have to clean up the map but no new spawns and you get rewards literally anything**"

PhoenixPoint,ff3m4lx,t3_erf9pt,1579543981.0,The player base dropped like a rock after this patch - not a shock that they nerf a bunch of things for the players in mass - nerf one or two tiny things for the AI with ZERO other balance or fixes .

PhoenixPoint,ff3jae6,t3_eqg83m,1579542243.0,"Yep the logic and decision making of doing these fixes FIRST before addressing other balances issues has actually made the game LESS fun.  Its made the game harder for sake of making it harder , not by fixing AI , scaling , enemy Armor .

&#x200B;

The liar missions alone made me uninstall for now - they are fun the first 3-5 times but become tedious borning slogs .  So cheesing them was the only way to deal with that.   I like the suggestion of being able to auto it after doing it X amount of times - even if its 10 time at least you know every one is a step toward that.   5x seems more reasonable .

&#x200B;

Or even a dispatch system - Send 6 soldiers away for 3 day sand BOOM lair blows up and team returns with like 50% of the normal XP - maybe some injuries that need to heal  maybe like 30% chance someone will get injured reduced by 5% per level . OR have bonus to injury rate based on ODI etc"
