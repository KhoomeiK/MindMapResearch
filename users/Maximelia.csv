AskDrugNerds,fdl37p8,t1_fdl2cwj,1578516288.0,"Yea it mostly is. I just wanted to cut down on pot as it started to make me feel bad and experience ketamine as it “might” help my condition instead worsen it like weed or alcohol. It’s not harsh at all, I just want to have fun(without harming myself) and maybe by a placebo effect or maybe a real effect fix sth in me, or just spend my free time having fun. I don’t think I have major depression, but I might have bipolar which is totally irrelevant, yet if you want to defend it might trigger manic episodes; however, I’m not diagnosed with anything. I would love to seek medical ketamine treatment but there is barely a useful doctor in Cyprus. Thanks for the advice and the consideration 🙏"

AskDrugNerds,fdkvfwy,t1_fdkuq6n,1578511976.0,Wow hahahha I don’t know if I would feel comfortable a drug staying that long in my system. I’ve had a bad trip/downer after injecting .60. I started crying and I’m scared if that state would last more than 4 hours it would effect my mental health (maybe).
AskDrugNerds,fdku5qs,t1_fdksvy1,1578511219.0,"Man it’s extremely cheap in here a bottle of ketamine is 3 dollars and a pack of 300mg lyrica is 20 dollars. 

I have never heard of that. Does ketamine stays for a long time in your body?"
AskDrugNerds,fdktpcs,t1_fdkt2je,1578510949.0,"Tbh, that’s how I learned about Ket’s existence and the only reason I signed up to ever SI is cuz it helps with depression and creates an euphoric state. It’s extremely cheap in here approximately 3 dollars (a bottle of 500mg/10ml) without the syringes and alcohol."

AskDrugNerds,fdkor09,t1_fdkiyg9,1578507997.0,"Thank you so much for the advice. I’ll observe this week if I’m craving for it or not. Also this  week was exceptional as I just got it and my finals just started. If I realize that I run after a high, I’ll throw it or finish and not buy ever. I think I have enough will power to stop myself. Also, my mom will visit me in 2 weeks so I don’t want to be that addict who shots herself in a bathroom and try to hide it from her family. I can’t afford that while trying to keep up with my classes."
AskDrugNerds,fdko9f5,t1_fdkiss9,1578507705.0,What do u mean by half-lifes? I get my ket from my pharmacy with no legal problems. I’m currently on Cyprus so here you can get almost everything without prescription including lyrica and it’s types
AskDrugNerds,fdko0c6,t1_fdkn794,1578507553.0,"I had sniffed ecstasy before but it really damages olfaction. I think I’ll give it 1-2 semesters depending on its effect on my body and my mind, and decide whether the benefit is higher than its cost(as it’s effect on my body). I’m really worried tho that’s why I wanted to ask you guys."
AskDrugNerds,fdkh02w,t1_fdkg62p,1578503684.0,I’ve seen that they inject in the depression treatment mixed with serum plus I didn’t know I could sniff or just swallow it. Is it better?
AskDrugNerds,fdkeqtc,t1_fdkcaja,1578502312.0,"Yes I don’t do heavy chemicals. I have only tried ecstasy. I’m buying the k from my pharmacy sealed. I use every syringe just once and sterilize the spot before and throw it afterwards. 
The bottle is 500mg but I do t exceed 240mg per week. It makes me feel better, I have problems making gf in the campus so it’s eases the pain. 

Doing 60mg was hard core experience for me I had dissociative experiences, hallucinations and a fucked up downer after it. I don’t think I will do it often. 

However, yesterday I wanted to shot myself another 40mg but even before pushing the liquid I had experienced irritation on my muscle, hot flashes, noise in my ear, and my vision blurred and blacked out (didn’t pass out) for about 5 min. I got fricking scared afterwards. So wanted to consult you guys, I only tried lyrica, ecstasy, and marijuana as drugs. 

Last year, when the gang I used to hangout became dependent on lyrica, I realized it and just backed off. We don’t hang out anymore but they still use it regularly. So I’m not much worried that I would become addicted."

AskDrugNerds,fdjwe67,t1_fdjufjw,1578489663.0,I certainly will. now I will just use it twice a week. I have watched some ketamine treatment in hospitalized environments. I guess I’ll try not to over do it

It is childish to want to take revenge, I should keep doing what I’m doing. I’m sure when they broke up.
