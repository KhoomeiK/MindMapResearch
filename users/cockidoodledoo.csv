thisismylifenow,ff0b1yb,t1_ff05fcf,1579467059.0,I tend to just stick to a microfiber and lens cleaner. The micro fiber towels can be hand washed with dish soap which prevents it from making greasy streaks on lenses. Just air dry them after washing and you should be good. Fabric softener will add a residue to the microfiber that promotes dust to stick to the lenses which causes micro scratches when cleaning your lenses.

thisismylifenow,fep3xu2,t1_feo9m6r,1579311588.0,Bad idea. The coatings will get damaged if someone has transitions or anti-glare. If anything the microfiber towels you get from optical places can be washed with dishwashing liquid and air dried. If you wash them with clothes detergent or fabric softener then it will cause streaks when trying to clean them and coat them in I think animal fat I wanna say. Making them more oily and cloudy. Oily glasses attracts more dust to stick to them and the next time you clean the glasses the small amount of dirt and dust will cause micro scratches on the glasses over time
ChevyCobalt,fawbkke,t3_e2c0lh,1576368670.0,It doesn’t have to be a $250 fix. If you buy a turn signal switch and have an hour or so of free time you can fix it yourself. It’s easy. Rock auto has them for like $25 bucks. It’s a common problem with the cobalts and a lot of forums and YouTube videos discuss this. Hope I helped.
