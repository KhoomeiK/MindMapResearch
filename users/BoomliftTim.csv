firealarms,ff7rzsi,t1_ff7p03a,1579656934.0,"Also i messed around in the settings and you can revert the dpu to mxl specifications, i can post a video tomorrow showing you how if you need."
firealarms,ff7ps15,t1_ff7p03a,1579655388.0,"The intelle-arc is a fault tester for hig voltage breakers, the dpu can test low voltage lines and address devices, its a neat tool, however a multimeter and toner are till preferred for general troubleshooting techniques."
firealarms,ff7i07q,t1_ff7huxh,1579650006.0,The intelle-arc we only use on service jobs for older models My guys in the field use a multi meter or toner for new systems.
firealarms,ff7huxh,t3_es0joo,1579649908.0,Yes we use a DPU to program and test devices and the intelle-arc for testing circuits and such.
firealarms,ff68aj5,t3_ere6pr,1579621490.0,"Get stopper covers with blue dye. I assumed it was pull stations, what type of alarm is it? System?"
firealarms,few37i4,t1_fevzgum,1579404764.0,"Haha thats great! In his defense, no one can compete with us fire techs üçÜ"
firealarms,fevisfj,t1_fevgyda,1579397902.0,"For once in my life it felt great to be the ""well actually"" guy lol"
GetMotivated,feszzbg,t1_fepco95,1579370531.0,Learn to trust yourself and your process will improve.
firealarms,fenkp39,t3_epvy93,1579286751.0,Daisy chain each pull station from a junction box so the voltage stays constant. In theory that should work
firealarms,fenhvnj,t3_eq06oh,1579285032.0,The gc at mt site tried to misquote code reference regarding ahu shutdown requirements in the weekly meeting. Basically the electricians neglected or didnt know we needed dd on certain units and he was trying to get around it. I pulled up the code on my phone and read it aloud. The pipe is being ran today üí™

Chaos, while unknown, can be an opportunity for our own betterment. Embrace it and take action towards a positive outcome, instead of bracing for the ""inevitable"" transgressions we assume will define our future self."
firealarms,fe8s7x0,t3_emhy9i,1578930111.0,Your meter is reading the devices on the loop
firealarms,fe8s2ap,t3_emkmpn,1578930064.0,Turn them candelas down üòÇ
firealarms,fe8rmt1,t1_fdzvcte,1578929811.0,"Did somecdigging, apparently the dedicated line refers to thevold pots line setup. With the new cellular and other types the line is required to be a loop start but not necessarily dedicated."
firealarms,fdkr15n,t1_fdkqv0h,1578509358.0,V=1.25√ó2.3
firealarms,fdkqv0h,t3_ejso7m,1578509256.0,14 copper 500 ft resistance is about 1.25 so the voltage with 2.3 amps would be around 3 volts
firealarms,fdkontr,t3_ejgkd7,1578507945.0,Can anyone say soft fault from condensation? Lol
firealarms,fcw60pr,t1_fcvwzvb,1578017959.0,Whats a pull station?
firealarms,fcw5okd,t1_fcw5ncp,1578017743.0,At least where i work lol
firealarms,fcw5ncp,t1_fcw5if6,1578017721.0,Well it should but alot of counties dont hold to it and just say get it fixed
firealarms,fcw5evj,t1_fcw4jlj,1578017562.0,Well i guess firewatch is pretty bad too
firealarms,fcw5044,t1_fcw4jlj,1578017287.0,Not as far as the tags go
firealarms,fcw4h80,t1_fcw4cu3,1578016939.0,Thats a red tag
GetMotivated,fcw2gsf,t3_ehdy2u,1578015606.0,"I woke up and decided to kick ass today, have a great attitude and be nice to everyone around me. I got alot done, helped some people out and came home to my family happy."
firealarms,fcw161o,t3_ej77j8,1578014755.0,Definitely get that replaced and yellow tag the panel. Operable but not within compliance.
firealarms,fcvj27h,t1_fcviwey,1578003148.0,"Good lord 200! Thats impressive sir, i can see how the issues would multiply exponentially lol."
firealarms,fcvhv9l,t3_eelr2z,1578002415.0,If its a farenhyt panel try 5820 or the number code that matches the panel
firealarms,fcvhceg,t3_ef7ibs,1578002105.0,Since it is a comm fault it will continue to go off everytime the panel sends a system check to the field. Check wiring on the sbus and confirm the color codes match on each module.
firealarms,fcvgs64,t3_effzlu,1578001772.0,I replaced my light switches in my room with pull stations haha
firealarms,fcvfv3i,t3_ehdyc5,1578001224.0,"You can still activate the pull station while making sure that only qualified personnel can (properly) remove the cage in order to service the device. Also alot of government sites require explosion proof boxes, it may be that as well."
firealarms,fcvff8l,t3_ehom7m,1578000961.0,"I think its 1 1/2 ft to the bottom, plus the panel door is obstructed so itll need to be moved regardless"
firealarms,fcvdho5,t1_fck3cbl,1577999815.0,Was this a simplex panel? The simplex program will do that to ya
firealarms,fcv75lr,t1_fcoa5tj,1577996042.0,Is this system specific? will this work universally regardless of the panel?
firealarms,fcuzjaj,t1_fcjysom,1577991628.0,"Great tips! I will save and share this with my helpers. Also dont overthink it, if you feel frustrated take a breath and call youre sensei to get another opinion. Paralysis by analysis is real."
firealarms,fcuyapg,t3_ehkn55,1577990944.0,"Dont skip steps! Even if you feel like you know the issue ( loose wire, device not sitting flush etc.)
Make sure you do all the proper troubleshooting steps you would normally do, if you are wrong you can actually create a separate issue that can confuse the process."
firealarms,fcux6ne,t3_eil6zb,1577990325.0,If you're liscenced you yellow tag the panel and wire nut the wires. Also if its a speaker strobe check that the spkr is not wired on the nac or check if there is voltage bleed on the nac. Otherwise replace the device.
firealarms,fcuw3vg,t3_eioufm,1577989726.0,The primary phone line MUST be dedicated for the monitoring station. The back up line can be shared but its a yellow tag if line #1 goes down.
sports,f7lgzp8,t3_dwlq3l,1573840251.0,Mason rudolph needs to be suspended also. He instigated by hitting garrett in the nuts. Garrett definately went to far though.
