It lists organizations that could use the materials or objects, or if there is none, where you should bring it for adequate disposal. For example, old clothes, even if they are in bad shape, could be used to fill cushions or plush toys. :)"

UXDesign,fcyc5hh,t3_ejc5we,1578077857.0,"I don’t have the time or the energy to go through all of your points to share my experience, but it would be very similar to yours. 

I’ve been working as a UX designer for two years after getting my master degree and I burnt out after the first year. I developed an anxiety disorder and I’m mostly depressed, all thanks to horrible work experiences in the UX field. Yet I was so passionate about being a UX designer. It breaks my heart.

Thanks for being honest and sharing your thoughts about the field, it made me feel better knowing I was not alone.

Now I’ll bookmark this and come back to read everyone’s replies, maybe it can be useful to help change my mindset and learn to love this field again !"
wholesomememes,fcwd1om,t1_fctixfx,1578022590.0,"Thank you so much for this. I couldn’t agree more. It’s just that, being the end of the year and the decade brings a lot of introspection and looking back, it feels like in this decade, my life went down a thousand different paths and none of them were the right one. Even though I know it doesn’t matter, it’s hard not to see it like failures, and that’s why I’m so worried about the future. I’m working hard on finding peace and accepting that this may be part of who I am."
wholesomememes,fcwbvvb,t1_fctktva,1578021818.0,"Thank you so much. I’m feeling much better today, but I’ll make sure to come back to this comment whenever I start to worry too much about the future. Again, thanks for taking the time to write something to help."

Great job on getting up and taking a shower. I’m proud of you and wish you can heal and feel better this year."
