You can buy experiences that make you happy, get people something they might’ve always wanted, donate to charity, and buy antidepressants. So yes, you can buy things that are equivalent to happiness.

Physically, obviously you can’t since it’s not a physical thing, but don’t tell me that just because I have money I won’t be able to buy things or experiences that make me happy"

AskReddit,fcho8fc,t3_ehb7x1,1577652340.0,"Not bad actually. 

Technically I’ve ghosted some people online but they kept sending me really creepy and uncomfortable messages. They occasionally reach out to me, but I never respond. I never do this with anyone I know irl, but creeps online are people I ghost quite often."

Cool, I don’t care if it’s a holiday or your birthday or some other significant day for you, that doesn’t mean you get to be an asshole to other people nor does it entitle you to free things."
