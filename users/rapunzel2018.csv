My theory is that he blackmailed Trump to pardon him, with data and videos he had of Trump with underaged girls in his plane and houses, and Trump had him killed by his mob friends. With no evidence since Trump doesn't like electronics, so no trail. We will likely never find out, but that is my theory. Oh, and that he also had evidence of Bill Clinton doing it the same. I mean, who believes that two proven predators like Trump and Clinton DIDN'T hang out with Epstein even after he was already convicted so that they can continue victimizing young girls!?"

His behavior is not normal as he steps over natural boundaries, in this case jerking off in your parents house. Come on, that is not healthy that he thinks he needs it so bad that he can't even wait until he is home. Plus, for myself at least, the more I did it the more I wanted it. It becomes an obsession, and an addiction, to release. The next step could be that he looks for sex elsewhere if he makes himself believe that the two of you are not in the same boat. You need to speak with him about his behavior not being normal. There us a high sex drive and then there is obsession.
