science,fej0qmz,t1_fej0o9a,1579152783.0,"Definitely. But for the average person, they don’t plan ahead that far. It would be nice if the grocery stores weren’t so wasteful"

science,feixcav,t1_feiw4x6,1579149807.0,"This makes sense to me. Also, a restaurant buying in bulk probably uses less packing materials. Nowadays if you want to buy a zucchini it’s wrapped in more styrofoam and plastic than the squash itself..."

In the meantime, I did find a solution to my problem. 
I initialized all the instances of the structure into an array: myArray
Inside my buttonPressed function I used for loop to access each entry of the array and compare the .button parameter with the sender, and then saving all the parameters of the matching structure into a new instance that will serve as a placeholder to write data to the other structure later"
Swift_Programming,fdrokmu,t3_emwgbx,1578687398.0,I see now that the code portion of my post didn’t come out very well. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/Me4BQi3)  a screen shot:

educationalgifs,fc3cnow,t1_fc34b9l,1577386859.0,"A clutch is a stack of plates. Every other plate is connected to the inner or outer hub. Strong springs keep all the plates squeezed together, making the outer and inner hub act as one piece. When you depress the clutch, you’re countering the pressure of the springs, allowing the plates to slip, and the outer and inner hubs are now turning at different speeds. As you gradually let the clutch back out, there is more friction between the plates as the springs begin to squeeze them together again."
