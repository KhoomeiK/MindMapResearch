 That's not entirely true! They just move at a much slower pace than animals and communicate very differently. If you listen to your plant, you'll see when it's hungry (color changes), dehydrated (shriveled), over hydrated, root bound, and more. I can tell when my plant is happy or sad.

doordash,fbx7zxk,t3_ee5k72,1577173469.0,"Don't forget this is from getting rid of the OPM. Honestly, I made more with the OPM, roughly 10-20% more. Mostly through DD subsidizing for the lack of customer tips to meet guarantee. If those super dashers weren't so hell bent on sending those misinformative cards, the media wouldn't have pushed the tip stealing narrative to the customers. Those customers think they won because DD caved under pressure and moved to the NPM. Now we have this awful system with less integrity than before.

Sometimes I even wonder if the narrative was pushed by DD themselves so they could move to the NPM to increase profits on their end because subsidizing lack of tips seems like a losing business model. I ordered DD delivery today and noticed a $4 delivery fee plus 11% service fee ($2.60\~) plus tax ($2.50\~) plus subtotal ($21) plus tip ($5 in app + $4 cash). That's about $11.60 in service and delivery fees in the app. Do you think DD offered that much to my Dasher? I doubt it. The NPM is designed to benefit corporate, not the ones in the field making it happen."
