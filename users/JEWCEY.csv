The context of my explanation was not just friendship in the workplace but a very close 1 on 1 symbiosis that is like an asexual marriage. Romance in the workplace is completely different and not at all what I was referring to."

askgaybros,ffc2nyw,t1_ffc0qz4,1579790024.0,"I live in the states and this is a super common dynamic in all the offices I've been in for the last 20 years. Whether it's someone of the same or opposite sex, once you become ""real"" with someone at work and it's a mutual give and take friendship, they become a bastion in every day life. It's not about romance, it's about emotional fulfillment in general. That is a work-spouse. Its something to look forward to when work sucks otherwise. Someone to joke with, who gets you fundamentally, even if there are aspects of personal life you don't share. I've had several work husbands and work wives over the years. They make work bearable."

Not always well, but trying my best. I'm honestly not sure if I can be helped or if it's worth the time to find out. Coping does suck. So does paying a doctor to tell me what I already know.

It's masculine but it's also clearly bigger than your head, which makes it seem borrowed, a la ""boyfriend's hat"". Like boyfriend jeans or a boyfriend shirt. I dig it."
