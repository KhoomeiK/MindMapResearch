I've been telling people my days off are like this. It used to be I would love having the occasional day at home to myself on a day she was working cause I enjoy regular alone time. I'd spend the day on my own relaxing and doing what I wanted, then she'd come home and we'd spend the evening together. But now being alone feels unbearable because I know she's not gonna be there at the end of the day.

There was a bit of a parallel between the Doctor's speech to the queen and earlier dialogue with Edison (re: stealing other people's ideas and tech). I'd like to think maybe Edison softened toward Tesla at the end because he realized at that moment that the person in the room he had the most in common with was the evil genocidal alien."
