 I feel the best writing is immersive. GRRM uses words to create vivid mental images that make people and surroundings come alive.  A good writer makes their love of language tangible and GRRM loves words.  GoT  is worth wading through the densely written paragraphs.  The writing is thick and intricate but often you find passages are ethereal and lovely, dark and horrifying or simply very funny.  You will have no idea of why  GoT and GRRM are such a big deal if you just read a synopsis.  The best stuff in GoT are the details, the characterizations,  the tone, the mood.   The TV show may revel in its gratuitous sex and violence but the GoT books are not about that. The sexual violence in the books is in context of a society whose code of honor is breaking apart allowing evil to flourish.  There is a lot of pain of GoTs world and the characters reactions feel true to life.    There are so many other aspects of this fully created fictional world its impossible to summarize. My favorite chapter in all the GoT books is Tyrion's river journey where he encounters the enormous ancient river turtle among other great adventures.  But none of this was in the TV show and you won't find it in the synopsis. 

Stephen King is great at plots and ideas but he is not good with words.  You can read a synopsis of any Stephen King book and know all there is to know about the book.   Stephen King isn't lyrical, he doesn't create living breathing word images.  His writing beats you over the head with whatever raw emotion or plot he's selling until you succumb."

UnresolvedMysteries,fecucrf,t3_eo5vk6,1578984957.0,"A long long long long time ago (late 70's) I was a little 14 year old hippie surfer chick.  I had grown up my whole life in a little SoCal town and was nice, cute, naive and trusted that the world was kind and full of love.  That year my parents moved us to a new town 30 miles north up the coast and I missed my friends. No car, no problem, they were just a thumb or two away.  One day, on an off ramp in Camarillo, I got picked up by an older long haired  hippie dude in a white panel van.  Didn't think twice just climbed on up into the passenger seat.  Guy seemed OK but kinda creepy like any guy over 30. 

Back in those days there was a hippie protocol where if you were offered a pipe you took a hit to be polite.  So when this dude offered a pre-packed bowl and a conveniently lit lighter  I didn't think too much about it.  Just took a little hit to be polite.  But somehow my naive little idiot brain  noticed that when the dude took the pipe back he just pretended to inhale.  A little alarm went off.

Then it hit me, like a hot wet blanket of cruddy molasses.  Massive disorientation. My senses became like running water.  Upside down and sideways and fuckely duckely.  Something really powerful and totally fucked up in that little tiny hit I took.  

The only thing I held on to was my exit.  I must have repeated it a thousand times coming up to the exit.  ""This is my stop. You can get off here.  This is my stop. You can get off here. This is my stop, etc etc"". 

Dude must have realized he would have had a very freaked out, potentially frantic PCP case on his hands if he didn't pull off at my exit.  He did pull over and let me out.  As he let me out, he leaned out at me like a million miles with eyes like black holes and said ""You never know what someone is going to do until they do it"".  And in my head he kept saying it. Like a million times. 

I wobbly crawled to the closest light pole and spent the rest of the afternoon with my arms wrapped around it.  I kept melting, then evaporating.  I couldn't find the horizon. The sun kept setting and rising and setting and rising.  Come dark, I was enough back in my body  to walk the five miles to home.  Parents never knew.  I never told anyone this story until today.

I've never experienced anything again that was as powerful and overwhelming as what was pre-packed in that little pipe.  That creepy guy for sure had some creepy plans for a  little hitchhiker in his white panel van. But he wanted easy prey, one zonked enough out of reality for whatever fun times were to be had in the back of the van. Brrrrrrrrrrrr. 

 The angel of idiot teenage hitchhikers was looking out for me that day. Sad to say, that angel got too busy to help all of us.   Some little hitchhikers never made it home in the 70's.  They found them in ditches.   I was lucky."

collapse,fdyaxdx,t1_fdtjh88,1578777862.0," Bottom line - use of backburning needs to be considered carefully to protect people and the environment. People raising objections may have very good reasons to do so.  Especially in a prolonged drought where there are limited windows for safe burning.  Backburns have escaped fire lines in the past and caused serious damage.    From an ecological standpoint, Australia has many biomes adapted to fire.  However some biomes are adapted to wetter conditions and do not easily recover from fire. There are also areas with rare plants or animals where fire may seriously impact vulnerable species that may not recover.  I'm in California and we are having the same struggle with backburning.  Forest management policies suppressed fires for years to protect property.  Backburning is being looked at now but it will be more dangerous due to fuel loads."

However, the Greens have no political power in Oz, so even if they were opposed they would not be able to stop backburning. What limits backburning is that it can only be done safely during wetter weather.  Due to the drought, there were few  times the past few years where backburning could be done safely.  It didn't help that the actual government in power cut fire funding by 75% last year.  This also resulted in less backburning due to lack of funds."

Permaculture,fdejrcz,t1_fddb2p1,1578340506.0,"Sorry for the novel but I hope you find this interesting: The Cali fires have generated quite a bit of recent information about what burns and what doesnt.  What recent studies and observations have concluded is that the problem is not so much a 'fuel' issue but a 'weather' issue. I also think it's a invasive non-native plant issue.   Drought resistant native plants (provided some water in the summer), native oak groves, healthy green riparian and irrigated agriculture (citrus, avocado) appear to provide the most protection as buffers.  California has a real problem with non-native annual invasive grasses and plants.  These sprout up immediately after fires and create an annual fire hazard that will burn year after year.  Recent weather driven fires defeat fire mitigation such as fire breaks and logging due to the heavy growth of annual grasses.  In wind driven fires, the non-native grasses in fire breaks  function as a wick for flames.  
Eucalypts, palm trees and acacias are non native trees and people love them in Cali.  But they are a significant source of wind blown embers.  The native oaks and well watered riparian and orchards appear to be  the most resistant to ember showers.   In California, the native oak woodlands have adapted to fire and if healthy are very fire resistant. There are a growing number of homeowners who found native oak groves were protective from wind driven ember showers.  Planting screens and canopies of fire resistant trees such as native oaks is just starting to be discussed. 
In Cali much of our increasing fire frequency and how fast these fires travel is due to the replacement of native forests and low scrub (chapparral) with  annual nonnative plants and grasses.  Yellow mustard is a serious scourge and seems to expand its range after every fire.  This stuff sprouts in February, dries out by May and is ready to burn by June.  
Land management needs to change to address these more extreme conditions.   Rethinking traditional fire mitigation is just starting.  Goats are making a come back in steep terrain to deal with the non native grasses.  Our native stuff is yucky.  If you find an approach that works please share it!"
