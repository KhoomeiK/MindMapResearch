depression,feggjr5,t3_ep1n7o,1579092033.0,I could sit here and type that it's going to be okay in the end but I ain't because you will say I am doing it for pity. I am in a similar situation as yours but we all need to hold our grounds and stay a live it might not get better soon but we need to hold and live by the wind. Living for yourself is one of my goals right now. Living cause I was born for a reason cause I am worthy of it cause I am waiting for the world change and imma try to help it get better. Sorry if I wasn't such a great helper.. idk.

lgbt,fe5ix0k,t3_enuvqi,1578870055.0,"I could say I am in the same situation as yours with one tiny difference, a guy in my class hates LGBT+, in terms of the rest of the class, if I ever come out to them, I feel as if they would accept me but still have the same feeling that you described as attention seeking on my part which I would hate, specially when I am shy and don't have that many strong connections with my classmates. I also feel as if my coming out isn't necessary in this of my life and, since I only came out to my two best friends and brother, I don't feel as if it would be important for people that I will forget about when I leave high school to know."
teenagers,fe5hkq4,t3_enuw26,1578869477.0,"In my opinion, you could play two player games or watch movies or series, maybe try and find a hobby you two have in common that you haven't found experience new things in order to find new things to do with each other. Sorry if I didn't help much."
lgbt,fe5gmm0,t3_enuh0n,1578869182.0,"Personally I am bisexual, and as much as I have interest in this community I think that I would never be able to fully know every single meaning to each letter of LGBTQQICAPF2K or LGBTQIAPN. Care to explain what GSRM stand for?"
