depression,fcmd6qz,t3_ehyatw,1577771098.0,"I feel that, i'm a musician and sometimes i get burnt out too. And music is the only thing i'm ""talented"" at, so i always feel like i lose my purpose when that happens.

But you know, that has happened to almost every artist throughout the history. Maybe in your case it's more complicated than that: maybe it will last longer, and maybe it's coming with a heavier emotional impact. But that doesn't mean that art nor life end there.

What usually works for me is letting it sink in. Like ""Okay, i don't like what i'm doing, i don't feel talented, I don't feel useful doing this particular thing, but that's okay"" and then I try to spend some time exploring other stuff, like more visual arts, or just playing games or whatever. And I also try to avoid overly negative terms like saying my music ""is trash"" or stuff like that, because I did that in the past and it has never helped.

I don't know what's gonna work for you, you're gonna have to figure that out by yourself. But just reflect on the fact that neither art or life have to necessarily end here.  
Good luck, and if you need someone to talk, i'm here :)"

SuicideWatch,fcmajqv,t3_ehlm8x,1577768763.0,"i think the fact that you care about all those people means that deep down you care about yourself, and the hope you have for those people means you're hopeful about yourself.

And if you don't think that way right now, at least i hope you and all the people here end up realising that being ""tired and unhappy"" is fixable.

Until then, i'm here if anyone needs to talk"
