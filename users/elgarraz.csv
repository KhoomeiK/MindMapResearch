He didn't actually torture the Longbottoms, but he set them up or something. He was the equivalent of a lookout.

Crouch Sr was using the trials to boost his profile, trying to look good and eventually become Minister of Magic. When his son turned out to be complicit, Sr threw the book at him to save face. When Jr got older, he was really bitter, and sticking it to his dad was his main motivating factor for infiltrating the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
