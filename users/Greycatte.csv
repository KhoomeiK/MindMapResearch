creepyPMs,fd2vmrj,t1_fd2jpuc,1578152077.0,"You display no sense of actual reflection on what has been discussed and regularly pushed away arguments asking how are they relating to one another thing, then circling it back. I frankly don't want to discuss this any further, you just want absolution from a creepy thing you do. That's it. That's all there is to it, and it is nothing like private thing you do when you shit yourself, because it relates to human relationships. I'm really done, you just seem like a person I wouldn't like at all. Have a good life."
bigboobproblems,fcqtm7g,t3_ei7fyw,1577892010.0,"For UK, I found a bralette for my size roughly, 30I, from Laura Intimates. Less support of course than a wired bra, but it does hold them up! I reckon looking for ""custom made"" lingeries hmmm."
creepyPMs,fc8vchg,t1_fc8q9rc,1577542606.0,"Exactly! You've literally answered my point in a supportive way. Listen, I know you won't change your mind about it, a person who does such things will continue to justify them until it suits the agenda. But however you wrap it up for yourself, you admitted it needs covering up, at the very least. It is not some charitable thing you're doing by complimenting, unfortunate as it is, unnecessarily self-conscious women.

Shame about your girlfriend. Poor girl."
creepyPMs,fc8ki6a,t1_fc8kda0,1577536821.0,"Didn't deny that. It is still creepy. Also imagine finding such a chill partner they immediately say oh no go for it, when you explain that you just spread joy and acceptance on gonewild. (Just an example, you don't really need to aim to even have a partner)."
creepyPMs,fc8i4qf,t1_fc837w8,1577535407.0,"I don't believe a random man's appreciation of a naked body is a charitable, good-willed move, especially since I truly believe any human should love their own body regardless of social desirability. It's the shortsightedness and sexualisation of your own interests.
So yeah, it is not my world but I look at it as an immature and creepy past time."
creepyPMs,fc6dnom,t1_fc5dxgt,1577478107.0,"Might be a personal preference, but a man interested in commenting on porn has some sort of hyperfocus on a particular aspect of it, I'd drop him like a hot potato. It's the fact he's bother to find out subreddits/pages for it, formulate a thought and post about it, the entire effort behind it. I'd rather avoid a person like this, as I deem this to be rather creepy."
worldnews,fc6clbx,t3_egb302,1577477412.0,"Fuck storming Area 51, we need to Naruto run toward Kylie Jenner's mansion."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fc5nqxv,t1_fc5f95w,1577462240.0,"More like the weakness of that particular dick. Just say no if you can't be arsed. If she's a bitch about it, she's not worth it.
My boyfriend likes to shop with me because we're quick and we're both treating ourselves to stuff. Everyone's happy!"
worldnews,fc58rim,t1_fc55jo4,1577448932.0,"I am not, this is literally what Russia has done to my motherland and people in my closest family. Conscirpted willing poles to follow the absolute power of the militia and excuse their vile actions. This is history now, but it has already happened, and the trends seem to follow suit, even if not as crudely as back then."
creepyPMs,fc5899w,t1_fc4tq92,1577448251.0,Going out of your way to comment on porn seems rather creepy my friend.
worldnews,fc55hqz,t1_fc537hs,1577444210.0,"That's literally what Russia has done before, and Slavic countries huddled under common communism only 40-odd years ago, where they find a legal excuse to lock people up for unrelated crimes. It's back with the militia beating people up on the street and then finding a protocol for it."
worldnews,fc5563i,t1_fc51g2b,1577443719.0,"It's like in the past, ""we will find the article for your crime""."
worldnews,fc5549k,t3_eg2qk3,1577443642.0,"Man, if a person of minority is still within the country, for their own safety, potentially should take the chance to leave now. I doubt forces can be bolstered to stand against them within the country."
science,fc2okhx,t1_fc2mp85,1577369232.0,Yikes.
cringepics,fc04pbe,t1_fbz72zu,1577278443.0,"Oh no you've really told me this time 

Also I feel kind of flattered being called a lad"
cringepics,fbz2y2p,t1_fbyz21c,1577233491.0,"Because beauty is catered toward women marketing wise primarily, it however doesn't make a difference which gender uses the product as we all happen to have skin stretched over a similar skeleton"
Eyebleach,fbymiqi,t3_ef1fon,1577220701.0,"Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?"
ChoosingBeggars,fbxlg2p,t3_eex5py,1577192792.0,"Controversial opinion, perhaps, who gives a toss about a little icon on a post?"
SelfAwarewolves,fbw0e5m,t1_fbv619b,1577138715.0,"The issue is that is is not just a simple question, you were ""speculating"", and it's not some sjw agenda we're running here my man, it's just like... Kind of just logical progression of understanding how humans work, bound with information coming from interacting with other (female) humans, and at the very least, googling. Like, I'm not trying to even consider your attempts malicious, but you seem to be backpedalling when, well, you got what you've bargained for with the style of post you've construed. To answer plainly, your theory is incorrect, but I do encourage you to research more if you still have some doubts."
SelfAwarewolves,fbut823,t1_fburmdu,1577119989.0,"I mean... Fair enough, but you do have access to the internet where you can verify whether your speculation is correct, so I'd say it's better to read up before, well, speculating like this, even if it's anonymous.

But you also might be a wee troll in which case that got me stretched hey hey"
