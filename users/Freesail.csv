There is only 8 images in a pack of film now because the film is not as advanced as the original Polaroid film, but they are working on it. I-Type film is cheaper because it doesn't contain an internal battery as the camera uses a rechargeable battery. They've also had 8x10 for years now."
gadgets,ff9vrb7,t1_ff4b9qe,1579722570.0,"You clearly are not a Polaroid user, not someone who is knowledgeable in anything relating to the Impossible Project (now Polaroid Originals), who is the only company that produces film. There are many reasons to buy a brand new camera for $100+, many who gladly pay several hundred for Polaroids. And this ""random company"" is producing film out of an original Polaroid factory along with people who have worked with Polaroid before it first shut down. They are legit."
