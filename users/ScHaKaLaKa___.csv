socialanxiety,fcne6uu,t3_ehs0vv,1577809851.0,"Well I can tell you a relationship is not always the best for you. I went through the hardest time of my life this year, after realizing my SA is getting worse and worse in January I finally decided to tell my ex gf about it (she was really into festivals, parties, etc & I just couldn’t force myself to go to these events any longer).
And guess what after our relationship lasted 4,5 years she decided she just want to have a good time and can’t deal with my kind of problem. I was devastated because I would have never expected that kind of answer from her. 
So yeah a relationship can be nice sometimes, but if something like that happens to you it literally can destroy you"
