The problem is that govt run programs are ran by a govt that thinks govt run programs don't work by hamstringing any opportunity, or at least severely deriding them, to actually work.    


VA is shitty, but not because it's govt run, but because the lack of funding.  Congress has long decided that you vets don't deserve health care.
