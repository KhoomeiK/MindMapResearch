The *mean global* te.perature increases. This causes the ice caps to shed a huge iceberg which then goes floating off into the ocean. As the iceberg melts it cools the water around it. As it floats away you can end up with cold water where you normally have warm water which of course altera the temperature of wind currents passing it. So globally the temperature is rising, but locally we have a snowstorm in April because there's a bunch of cold water in a part of the ocean that doesn't usually have cold water this time of year."

Think about that. You're coming off as salty that a people won their independence from imperialism. We had no business there, neither did the French."

Iran is mountains and rugged terrain that doesn't favor our armor and gives their infantry plenty of places to dig in and hide from air strikes. The problem won't be the opening, conventional portion of the war. It will be the occupation where an Iranian military, specialized in asymmetric, guerilla warfare will be fighting and resisting from prepared hideouts.


Picture the Vietnam war but against an enemy with decades to build up and prepare. Guerilla fighters with professional discipline and training. Oh, and access to far better man portable force multipliers than the Vietcong possessed.


Iran will be pure hell."

Engaging with electoralism is about playing for time, and keeping ethnonationalists out of power is more important to me than ideology or ego. But then, I have friends I really care about who happen to be minorities, so maybe I'm just more invested in the opposition to ethnonationalism than you are?


Or maybe I'm just better at getting over myself for the sake of ""the bigger picture"" than you are? I guess we'll never know. I don't know your situation or material conditions."
