I get what you are saying but i wouldn't be able to stay sane without that to look forward to, it is the only thing i find purpose in. If it weren't for weed i would've dropped out since i couldn't stand school before i started smoking but now i have some motivation to power trough."

SuicideWatch,fd98epz,t3_ekbhf5,1578229869.0,"Why do it when you will certainly die in the future and when you die at that point it's like you never even existed, so if killing yourself changes nothing wether you do it now or later why not just postpone it? At least don't make others who care about you suffer as well."
SuicideWatch,fd5obcs,t1_fd40yy5,1578179630.0,"Pretty much, i have let go of the idea that god exists since i was 10 even tho i was brought up in a very christian home, the idea that god exists makes so little sense. We are here on this planet with no one to save us, and we sure as fuck aren't saving ourselves, i have no idea why but that actually brings me joy. There might be no justice currently in this world but eventually time will take care of us all, every single person that you see, everyone that will be born in the future, they will all die eventually along with the rest of the universe, it will all end, and when it ends it's like it never even began at all. That nihilistic fact is what actually pushes me not to kill my self, it feels warm to know that it will all be over and that none of our suffering actually matters when you look at the whole picture, it's all pointless."
SuicideWatch,fd1usy0,t1_fd1tvf7,1578137150.0,"Wars are proof that humans are still stuck in their way of thinking and will die soon. Most people do not want wars yet they are proud of bullshit such as the country they were born in (which they didn't even choose) which breeds more tribalism between humans and thus creates more wars, typical human behavior, we were not meant to last."
shortcels,fcq1xk8,t1_fcpesan,1577876969.0,"Average fag here, i actually sympathize with shortcels and i fully get how much this shit world is going to completely fuck you over if you are a short man, i am also pissed off that nobody seems to care as well and won't admit that being short as a man is being sentenced to a life of pain. I completely get how fucked up this world is, that is why i try to treat my fellow short men with full respect and defend them when someone makes fun of their height because i know their life is tougher than mine and i do not want to make it any worse."
