atheism,fetl7ck,t3_eqjvoh,1579376486.0,"1) I think most of Christians are cool, except the ones that actually have power on the religion because theyre most likely using it for their own advantage, abusing the good will and faith of other people, but there are christians that genuinely believe and dont aggressively try to convert other people, which I think are the best, you believe what you believe as long as its not damaging anyone, and if that gives you hope its okay, but there are people who are in constant fear for being judged (hell & heaven) and they just suffer in their belief, because his god is just being apprehensive and there are lots of dilemas on their lives which put an insane amount of stress over the individual. their god is like a bad parent that doesnt teach, leaves a lot of ambiguous rules and just punishes, they cant know if their actions are good or not, and they tend to be really anxious about it.

2) I just found a lot of things that didnt make sense, I was told that god could know what I was thinking, but then I was obligated to say prayers, and I thought, why do I have to say that I'm greatful, I can just think about my gratitude and god should know. I also thought why dont I get the things I ask him for? If he's almighty powerful then he should be able to do everything at the same time!

Where did god take the matter to create everything? Where did everything come from? Did he have a bucket of matter to create things? If god was so powerful why would he let his son die? why did he let adam & eve sin? he should have been able to prevent it, or at least he would have created us with a sin prevention system, in fact, why do sins even exist? and did they exist before humans? It was just too much confusion for something that I didnt have any proof that existed, then I started learning in school, chemistry: nothing is created or destroyed, it just transforms, according to biology and chemistry a human corpse wouldn't be functional after 3 days of being dead, according to physics: a human cant walk on water since the human body is more dense than water, we can float because the air inside us is lighter and we do it horizontally because we can expand our area in contact with the water, nothing made sense, and since there wasnt any proof of god existing whatsoever, I just thought ""This is BS"", and now I dont believe in god.

3) I dont think after life is a thing, since we are our bodies, and if our bodies stop working, so does our conscience, memories, thinking and perception of the things around us, plus we wouldnt have anything to eat with, and how are we supposed to get energy to do anything at all without food?"

atheism,fet43id,t1_fesukdz,1579371646.0,"Instead of being a condescending piece of shit like this guy, I'm going to help you, yaaay!

Atheist: Doesnt BELIEVE (not KNOW) that there are any gods whatsoever.

Theist: Believes (again, not KNOWS) that there is one or more gods.

Agnostic: Says that he doesn't KNOW (meaning he may not KNOW, but he can BELIEVE) whether there is a god or not, and there is no way of KNOWING.

So you can be an atheist and agnostic, which I think you are.

atheism,fet24tt,t1_fesv0zi,1579371117.0,"If you cant prove that there isnt a giant invisible genetically modified elephant floating around in space it doesn't mean its real, if your friend tells you that he walked on water and fucked a dinosaur and you cant prove it didnt happen it doesnt mean its real, all of that can be told to be impossible by basic laws of science, but if youre gonna say ""oh its magic so it doesnt rule by normal laws"" to dismiss all cientific proof, then im calling BS.

Basic law of chemistry:
'Nothing is created, nor can be destroyed, it just moves and changes.'

 How do you expect me to believe that some magical being did a thanos snap and created matter? It doesnt make sense and its impossible.

Atheists say: Everything was already there, and it has always been. Maybe at a different place and a different time, but it existed somewhere.

Biology: A human fetus needs to be created by sperm and ovaries.

Jesus wasnt born by god making a baby on Mary, she cheated or had sex with his partner whose name i cant remember in english but in spanish is Jos√© without telling anyone else, probably to avoid judgement and reprehension from the society she lived in.

Chemistry again: Flesh starts to rotten in hours/minutes after the body loses its life.

Jesus wasnt resurrected magically by some divine entity AFTER 3 DAYS, and if he did, he would have been a zombie, because I highly doubt there were any cooling system to stop the chemical process in that stone coffin, not an almighty human being.

Yes, I centered on Christianity, because it's the religion that I know the most but you can do that with all religions."
