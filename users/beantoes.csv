Anxiety,ffdx3g0,t3_et3cou,1579831085.0,Does it hurt at all? Could it be a [tension headache](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000797.htm) ?
Anxiety,ffdw9vz,t1_ffdvp71,1579830501.0,Exactly. Literally any yelling or people being loudly and visibly upset...I freeze. But it’s nice to know I’m not alone. Hopefully some day it will get easier for us both 💜
Anxiety,ffdqoj7,t3_esxvkr,1579826620.0,"I used to be, but it has gotten a lot better. Everyone at my dentist’s office is really nice so that helps a lot. Even during my last filling, my anxiety was pretty manageable because I told my dentist and he was understanding and gentle about it. Very different from the practice I was going to before. THAT was stressful 😩"
Anxiety,ffdpsbf,t3_et1xah,1579826056.0,I also feel this way and believe it is largely related to my anxiety.
Anxiety,ffb62ps,t3_esfxfh,1579752771.0,I often crash and then get depressed for a bit after extended periods of high anxiety. Honestly wish I would crash because my anxiety has been on overdrive for too long this time ugh

TooAfraidToAsk,ferq2b9,t3_eqgq5c,1579357053.0,"Any time anyone asks if they should maybe see a therapist, my answer is always yes. Therapy is great when you find the right fit for you. Not sure that you need to worry yourself about it, but since you’re experiencing an increase in negative thoughts, it might be helpful and a good idea to do it now rather than later."
