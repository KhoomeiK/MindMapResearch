AskReddit,fdpf3uz,t3_emk33k,1578626998.0,"I just feel like no one would really believe me, like I have good grades, friends and a family that is still altogether. The reason I do have depression is from PTSD from my old school. Me and my friend both went to the same school, she was more abused, (physically, emotionally and slightly sexually). Me on the other hand just was emotionally and mentally abused, we were both blackmailed and abused by the same 2 f*cks. They did this for over 2 years before we both moved to an all girls school. So yeah, we never did tell our parents about what happened about the abuse we just told them we were being bullied. One day I was so depressed, anxious and scared that I broke down infront of my mom. I tried hide it as best as possible that everything is fine, I don’t want my younger siblings to see me depressed like this and I don’t want them to worry (I’m the oldest for anyone wondering). Me and my friend talk about our problems a lot, the thing that really gets me mad is that they just called me a couple days ago but my friend picked up. Apparently the threats and stuff were so bad she doesn’t even want to tell me. Srry this was so long but this is why I do hide it."

At that time I was actually bisexual but had more of a thing for girls. I politely declined but for the next month was living hell, people threw things at me and called me horrible names. I gave up and ended up dating him. I refused to even touch him, didn’t hug or kiss him. One of the main reasons I didn’t want to date him was a. He preferred T-series over pewdiepie, b. Hated memes in general, c. Was the most annoying kid in the class. So after 3 months of me just doing whatever he finally broke up with me. I was so happy I screamed ‘F*ck Yes!’, he thought I was gonna cry and not come back to school tomorrow. NOPE! I walked into class with so much confidence that he was so confused. He actually thought I would be crying over us breaking up xd."

And if I did die and left everyone behind I think one of my closet friends would probably spiral back into depression, they tried to end their life multiple times and are mentally getting better but still suffer with some traumatic stuff. I don’t think they would be able to mentally take it. My parents and siblings would probably be devastated. I wouldn’t do it."

AskReddit,fcowabr,t3_ei4ac7,1577843321.0,"It was during year 5 in school, I was a big smart ass. My teacher would do these times table challenges. Basically we would each choose a column that had 15 times tables, but it would be based on a number (5x7 9x7 you get the idea). Now the teacher would time you and the faster person would win a lollipop. I decided it was getting the end of the year when the big tournament was happening and we would get a 10 buck gift cards to my favourite book store. Now I realised that some column were longer to say then other (bigger number, more syllables etc). The next day I told my teacher and she was shocked. She went and told all the teachers and even the principal (she had been doing this timetable challenge for over 10 years!). At assembly they called me to the stage and gave me a certificate and a 50 dollar gift card to the book shop! I also won the times table challenge and won the other 10 bucks. It was definitely the most nerdiest moment of my life."

AskReddit,fcjl6fa,t3_ehg5ac,1577692144.0,"This happened about 2 weeks ago, 
Just some background context we have two houses on 1 property. I live in the smaller house down the hill with my slightly younger sister. The rest of my family live in the big house higher up the hill. Now to the story, it was around 9pm and I was finding it difficult to sleep (as normal) but I had a terrible gut feeling something was going to happen. I decided to hide all the valuables in my lockable room and sleep up at the main house. It was about 3am and I heard someone walking around it was my little brother. Now my brother is only 3 years old and is slightly behind in his speaking development and isn’t the brightest. Someone didn’t lock the baby gate to his room so he could freely walk around the house. My brother was recently diagnosed with a bad milk allergy and if he ate or drink to much milk he would have to be rushed to hospital. I went into the lounge room and found him sat on my mums phone (she must have left it open on Netflix for him) and he was sat with 2 full boxes of Maltesers and a huge block of chocolate. If I hadn’t gone up there he would have had to be rushed to hospital (and if he would have eaten them at night nobody would have known he ate them). So yeah probably saved him from being rushed to hospital."
