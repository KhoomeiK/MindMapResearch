NotAnotherDnDPodcast,ffdaia4,t1_ffbk3v9,1579816665.0,That makes no sense or a bunch of evil goblins would be worshipping Melora. Divine hearts just give you god-power.
nextfuckinglevel,ffbjw9q,t1_ffb70u2,1579768790.0,"Hehehehe gay people, am I right?"
nottheonion,ffbjrmw,t1_ffbj1nx,1579768607.0,Not really. We have senators just straight up walking out of the room in the middle of the trial.
ChoosingBeggars,ffbjnbj,t1_ffaqvda,1579768440.0,"It's like those r/nosleep posts that get more popular than the author intended so they keep adding parts and ""remembering"" things. Except the readers on r/nosleep go along with it because they know it's fake."
relationship_advice,ff8l6kb,t1_ff73nvf,1579683859.0,"If you're not saying it, I will. Definitely did not happen."

confession,ff52pkn,t1_ff4wfa7,1579578607.0,"Okay, yeah. They should send a handwritten letter expressing their remorse and then fuck off. Jesus. This makes me hesitant to have any kind of relationship with my siblings' kids."
confession,ff4s5j3,t1_ff362rg,1579571140.0,"Idk if this is against the rules but OP *should* feel like a piece of shit. 

OP, leave the poor guy alone! Don't try to apologise. You were a shitty person, learn from that, but you've destroyed any kind of trust between the two of you."
Documentaries,ff3q5zj,t1_ff313hu,1579546465.0,"The difference is that one is slowly killing you and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system, and the other is something you can participate in without too many adverse effects."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feozwtz,t1_feozbwe,1579309034.0,"Sorry dude, I'm not going to ignore homophobia because it's ""not bad enough."" I don't know anything about you, but I'm assuming you don't know what people feel like when they're targets of ""harmless"" jokes about how they're less than for no other reason than ""haha gay"". It's shitty. It makes people feel shitty and it deserves to be called out.

For you it's just a throwaway line for upvotes, but other people it's another way they're being shit on."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feoz7s5,t1_fej454w,1579308593.0,"If people are getting triggered that they can't make lame jokes because people call them out, and therefore are against real social issues because they feel like they can't make lame jokes, they're the problem not me. How incredibly childish do you have to be to react in that way?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,feoyu5p,t1_fej3s4a,1579308358.0,"Regardless of intent, spreading shitty jokes that punch down on victims of social hatred *spreads that hate*. It's childish to think that putting ideas out into the world will have no effect."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feoykye,t1_fej3oj0,1579308198.0,"Exactly this. I don't think this person is a gay-bashing nazi, but this is just lame and it *is* spreading hate regardless of intent."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feoyk0y,t1_fej5oxt,1579308181.0,"Oh, I like humor that doesn't punch down on minorities. I like my friends and family and they make me happy. They're hilarious without making lame jokes at the expense of others.

What makes you happy? Is it only shitting on others or do you have other interests?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fej2nhd,t1_feivo3i,1579154624.0,"Humor doesn't negate hatred. You're a child if you think you can hide behind ""it's a joke"". It's homophobia and it's not cool."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feity2j,t1_feirnuf,1579147133.0,Wow blatant homophobia being upvoted.

ExpectationVsReality,fdnlcrj,t1_fdnhdnc,1578588209.0,"They're attention starved, any kind will do, and negative attention is easy. Also, it makes them feel smart because they think they're tricking people by baiting the downvotes."

gatesopencomeonin,fdg1z32,t1_fdg1oh3,1578377056.0,Huh? I think you missed the point. The first comment was saying they look beautiful *with* their hijabs. And beauty isn't mutually incompatible with modesty.
