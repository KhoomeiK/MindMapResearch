Unfortunately, the tequila is not very good.  It is really super over sweetened to the point of being closer to pancake syrup than a tequila. 

Neat bottle.  Different than the ones Headed to the North American market.  Note that it is 38% ABV.  That is very common for Mexican market tequilas."

tequila,ffd0t47,t3_esxtre,1579811178.0,"El Jimador isn't going to give a representative example of anything beyond how crappy a tequila can be.  It is an awful, diffuser made, tequila.   Straight up swill.

If you want an exceptionally neutral-- bland, almost-- example of the ages, try Patron (yes, really).    If you want a very tasty lineup?   Fortaleza, El Tesoro, Siete Leguas, or the like.

For tier, no need to poison anyone with Cuervo Gold.   Grab a bottle of Altos Olmeca or Espolon.  Both are solid products and very cheap.  I'd lean more to the Espolon because Altos has a particularly flavor point that some (me) find off-putting.

I'd also skip the 1942.  While I have a fondness of it, it is a very candy tequila to the point of additives or significant manipulation.   Go with something like a G4 XA or El Tesoro XA (or, better, Paradiso).   Similar price points and much better tequilas.

Diffuser:  Cazadores, Corzo, El timador, and Tres Generaciones.

Likely diffuser for some/all of the distillate:  1800, Casamigos and Avion (all made at facilities with diffusers on site which may or may not be used some of the time for the production therein).  Maybe Don Julio now, as well.

There are a number of makers that are fully traditional -- using the Tahona and the Horno (stone ovens) -- and a number that are mixed, using low / high pressure autoclave, roller mills, etc... There are excellent tequilas made via all of said mechanisms, just not the diffuser.

G4, for example, uses the horno.  For squishing, it uses ""Frankenstein"" which is Felipe's rather cool tahona like crusher made of concrete and steel.   You should hunt down some Pasote and Terralta;  both delicious.

Fortaleza is fully traditional right down to fermenting in giant wooden vats.

Arette uses an autoclave and roller mill, but is in the process of installing a horno (actually, I think it is up and running now)."
tequila,ffabc71,t1_ff9cf9o,1579731562.0,"You aren't going to hear the term from the distributor / marketing folk because no brand (except Sauza and Casa Dragones) wants to admit to using a diffuser because it produces such a non-tequila product (there is a reason we call diffuser juice ""agavodka"" -- it really is much closer to a straight vodka-esque ethanol than an agave distillate).  


You also won't hear much about additives or other manipulation mechanisms, which are commonly used across products like Clase Azul, Casamigos, Cava de Oro, Don Elias, and others.  


I'm curious what brands you carry?"

tequila,ff8efy0,t3_es78ms,1579675011.0,"Greetings!

/r/tequila has a pretty good clue about diffuser because the admins, myself, and several other members have been quite vocal about said process decision.    As well, we have generally focused on, by consensus of how awesome they are, the core brands that are not willing to sacrifice quality in the name of selling out to market scale.  


I'm not at all surprised that industry professionals have no clue what a diffuser is.   The ""industry""-- especially the hospitality side of it-- is oft all about ""what sells the most"" and that rarely coincides with ""what is actually well made"".

Many of the more vocal crowd in here has spent time at Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in SF (if you haven't been, GO AS SOON AS YOU CAN) or has spent time on tour in Jalisco visiting some of the leading families of tequila."

\- Not the sap, really.  At least, the sap isn’t separated out.  Agave is roasted to turn the starches into sugars (ignoring diffuser because it sucks) and then the sugar water is squished out.  It isn’t sap like a maple, but more like the juice of the entire plant.

\- Appearance is entirely artificial in Cuervo Especial.  It is a product of industrial caramel as an additive.   In general, appearance can be anything from clear to dark amber to reddish to other hues, depending on barrels used for aging (or additives).

\- The flavor profile of Cuervo and other diffuser made products is entirely artificial, a product of manipulation and/or additives.   For well made tequilas, that description is not horrible, but there can also be significant ""candy"" notes imparted when using certain kinds of barrels (like, say, French oak which imparts a very distinct sweetness).

\- The areas of production are five STATES in Mexico.   Most tequila is made in Jalisco, but there are producers in 4 other states including one state that is on the east coast of Mexico nowhere near Tequila.  Jalisco is a big state.  There is no requirement that agave be grown nor tequila produced near the town of Tequila.

\- There are some excellent mixtos available, though very rare.   And, certainly, there are 100% pure agave products that are worse than even a bad mixto.

\- They missed extra anejo as a ""style"" (expression).  This indicates that the material is more than a decade out of date.

\- Mezcal can be made from blue agave.  Mezcal does not have to be pit smoked/roasted.   Mezcal can be double or triple distilled.    Mezcal is sometimes aged in a barrel similar to tequila."
tequila,ff28gjt,t1_ff26nba,1579496860.0,"Herradura used to be an incredible tequila.  Then they sold out to Brown-Forman, lost their master distiller, installed a diffuser, and went to utter crap.  They’ve since (post 2010) been recovering in quality, but not back to what they were.

Can't go wrong with either.  


Also, keep an eye out for El Tesoro as it is fairly widely available.  Also an incredible tequila.  


Don Julio is about the best made of the mass market tequilas.  The quality has been declining over the past decade or so.  Not horribly so, by any means, but it isn't what it was.   Not bad, not great, but ubiquitously available, which is nice."
tequila,ff1uptp,t1_ff1tsmw,1579486611.0,"Casamigos was sold to Bacardi (IIRC-- one of the big distributors) circa 2013 or so.  When that happened, the flavor profile was modified to be significantly sweeter to try and appeal to a larger market of people, including those that don't know anything about tequila.  


Technically, a blanco cannot have additives (but there isn't much control over that) whereas a reposado/anejo/XA can have up to 1% by volume of a set of approved additives, including various flavors, sweeteners, and viscosity modifiers (like glycerin).  


But even in the case of blancos the maker can manipulate the process to effectively add sweetness or other flavors without outright using an additive.

The Altos is a good one, too, if you like the flavor profile.  I don't;  find it too swampy.  But it is, at the least, well made.  


Tres Generaciones and Corralejo are both diffuser made swill.   Awful, sweetened, tequilas these days.  


I haven't tried Los Tres Tonos.  Seems competently made and gets solid reviews on TMM."
tequila,fdo0u26,t1_fdny2sg,1578596793.0,JCRDF is the only Cuervo product made well any more.

Got to taste it off the sampling line that came off the bottling tank.  

Absolutely delicious. 

But the circumstances were unique. My memory is tainted."
tequila,fdminsq,t3_em4awt,1578551285.0,Mmm... candy.
tequila,fdmcxvi,t1_fdm6wde,1578545918.0,Arette is good tequila and good folk.

tequila,fdma5hr,t1_fdkajuu,1578543663.0,"I have a new bottle of Paradiso and a new el Tesoro XA.  

I love the Paradiso. 

The XA is excellent quality but has aspects of the flavor profile that I’m not a fan of."
tequila,fdma1mg,t1_fdkn131,1578543582.0,That sounds awful.

That would be offensive. :)"

None of which are terribly impressive. But they ain’t poison, either."
tequila,fdm2slu,t3_em2mc6,1578538447.0,Solid.  Not great. Not awful.  Good for mixing.
tequila,fdlyrem,t1_fdlj8rj,1578535707.0,"San Matias is legit. They make great tequilas for surprisingly cheap prices.  Sort of like Tapatio. 

They also make San Matias Grand Reserve which is an XA for $50 that is quite tasty.  Sweet as it is finished in new French oak. 

Also, they make Rey Sol.  Which is exquisite.  One of my favorites.  But not cheap. 

San Matias is also one of the very few distilleries owned and run by a woman.

Everyone has to start somewhere and this tequila, like Clase Azul, is both sweet and ""smooth"".   Neither of which are terribly desirable in a well made tequila, but both of which make for a liquor, tequila or otherwise, that is imminently drinkable."
