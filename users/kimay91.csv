sex,fep8cd0,t3_eq97pm,1579314411.0,"Dont worry about that. My husband of 8years has an 24cm (9.5inch) penis and it huuurts. We can‚Äôt do all the positions, we can‚Äôt have sex without for play. Is it nice to look at? Absolutely. Does it feel good when I‚Äôm warmed up? Yes. But it would be so much better with a little smaller penis. It‚Äôs what you do with it that counts not how big it is."

AskReddit,fe8soay,t1_fe6lflb,1578930226.0,"You pay 30% if you make under 5500$ a month, the money that goes over 5500$ is a bit more tax. But that‚Äôs it. And every year you get back a lot of money from the government. 

And for our taxes we get free school(we actually get paid each mont when we go to school), free healthcare(everything is free, ambulances, hospital, surgeries etc), we only pay a maximum of 130$ a year in medicine, if it comes to 130$ ur medicines is for free. 
So yeah :)"
