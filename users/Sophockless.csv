There's a couple different words but you get those between e.g. brits and americans, too."
leagueoflegends,ff1l5na,t1_ff1k6l0,1579480955.0,Yep. It doesn't really shine through in his esports work but when you listen to his worldview Thorin's basically an unironic apologist for the far right.

insaneparents,feyym3s,t1_feyjozg,1579452076.0,What's the scripture/rationale behind board games? Is this like the D&D scare from back in the 80s?
insaneparents,feyxwkq,t1_feyjtbt,1579451795.0,I don't understand the reasoning behind coffe being bad but caffeinated drinks being ok.
TwoXChromosomes,fehj8b7,t1_feh6ck9,1579117654.0,Ask your doctor (preferably ahead of time...) if they can have a local anesthetic cream on hand - that's commonly used for children. A benzodiazepine is also an option to give you some minor sedation. You should definitely discuss what's possible with your doctor.
leagueoflegends,fe599o8,t1_fe4nc95,1578866760.0,How well were expeditions received? I think those offer a lot of variety and good content possibilities.

PublicFreakout,fdy6v5c,t1_fdwulvc,1578776704.0,"The one thing I think he said that isn't true is that people in the military have the right to refuse to take part in the war, no? I'm legitimately curious, I don't know, but I imagine refusing to be deployed once you've enlisted comes with negative consequences."
witcher,fdqlyp4,t1_fdqkucj,1578669832.0,Do you reckon he's into it or just too polite to protest?

educationalgifs,fddn7dj,t1_fddd1mm,1578318435.0,"Honeybees aren't native to australia, so eh. Obviously it sucks for the beekeepers and their colonies, but awareness should go to the native australian pollinators, not so much honey bees."
educationalgifs,fddn0mq,t1_fdde1k1,1578318265.0,"If you ask 5 beekeepers for a solution to a problem, they'll probably give you 6 different answers.

There's a lot of disagreement on a lot of things in beekeeping, and it's hard to definitively say whether a practice is good or bad because how much difference there can be between your region and how you run your operation."
educationalgifs,fddmsi0,t1_fddkx0n,1578318059.0,"Sterile means any seed it produces won't germinate - like a sterile animal, it can't reproduce. Lots of gardeners can be apprehensive to plant certain native species because they spread a lot of seed and take over your garden, requiring a lot of maintenance through weeding. Sterile varieties can address that concern."
leagueoflegends,fcqwm9f,t1_fcqsfo8,1577893333.0,No.
leagueoflegends,fcqwk50,t1_fcqryjn,1577893305.0,"It's not quite that easy. A business relation requires a certain degree of trust. I don't think Riot cares about the fans he leverages if they can't trust him not to blow up again because he doesn't like the direction they're going - that'd be giving him a big platform to shit on League again eventually.

Given the amount of control Riot has over LoL esports, he'd have to work his way up again to show he can be a pragmatic partner for at least a good while."

unpopularopinion,fbbewl5,t1_fbbcdrp,1576699009.0,"That's certainly not how modern doctors are trained these days, take a look at the royal college of canade's CanMEDs for an example. http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/canmeds/canmeds-framework-e

Permanent infertility (with a possible child wish at a later point in life) is a pretty major side effect, I'd say. There are various options available for contraceptives that can be explored together as patient and doctor. Vasectomy in young people should absolutely not be a first or even second choice.
Edit: To specify, it's absolutely wrong of you to imply there's a gender-specific bias going on here. The possible negative side effect of a vasectomy heavily outweighs that of modern oral contraceptives or IUDs. Distinguishing between two interventions because one removes and another interrupts an anatomical structure is arbitrary, in both cases there's a loss of function."
