relationships,ffe09qm,t3_esu3le,1579833369.0,"Okay! I’m a teacher and I usually deal with 13-15 years old. I’m also young (25f) so at times having the responsibility of teens can be stressful. It’s a tough age. Hormones, trying to figure out who you are, feeling helpless. All that fun stuff. I would say, talk to her. Ask her what’s going on, tell her you are there, be supportive, kind, but most importantly work on being and creating a stable environment. That is the most important thing for kids this age. Establish a routine. Get into it and keep going. She may fight it a bit but follow through. Do not waiver. I don’t mean be rude/mean/strict but just work on being stable for her. She will try to test you in this regard. Try to be there for her, find her a good school. (Look into ratings, don’t just go straight to the closest if you need help dm me.) email her teachers/administration and explain the situation, tell them to keep you in the loop, ask them to help her the best they can and to inform you of anything troubling. Watch her behavior. This age is full of impulsiveness especially in the face of struggle. Ensure she is safe and smart especially with all that time home alone on weekdays. Top things I would say are be firm, fair and stable for her. Talk to her, ask her opinion but set up rules/boundaries now. Also, if she is mean to you just know it’s the age she is and nothing personal at all. Good luck!"

teaching,ffay24l,t1_ffarlwk,1579747145.0,Kinda silly. But we gotta do what we gotta do. I would make it a routine always assigned on Monday and turned in on Thursday. Friday -10. Maybe give time to “check it” but actually make that time for answering anything or “collaborating” with peers. Maybe say “go share your answers with 3 friends before we grade. This is a time to change answers and revise your work.That way you give students more of a chance to be successful. You’ll be okay. We’re half way through the year.

Ask the trainer to cover them at the start of a training. Not a whole page either, break down the core concepts of what you want the learners to do/know at the end of the training. Maybe have the trainer read them to the trainees before AND after the training to encompass all that they should know and do."

worldnews,ff3xgva,t3_erfcm7,1579550984.0,"In teaching if you work hard and show how amazing you are it’s almost guaranteed you’ll gain only more responsibility for the same pay. For example, yearly we have to rate papers for students who are English learners (there are a ton in Texas schools) usually all English teachers bare this burden but a lot of teachers on my team aren’t certified because they failed/won’t get certified or they did poorly on our “calibration” the year before. I scored a 100% and now I’m on a small team who will be grading all of them. I went from 20 papers to supposedly 50 (I’m sure it will be more). Whoop."
instructionaldesign,fepj9cr,t3_eqbnvz,1579321925.0,I am not in ID yet but I’m a teacher working on my masters for education and instructional system design. Teach yourself. The least valuable thing about my courses has been the tech I have learned. I have hardly learned anything of importance other than the basics of evaluating objectives which... I already pretty much knew. The more useful stuff has all been self taught. If you want to switch to corporate lean more of Adobe/Articulate/Captivate which there is a lot of resources on YouTube or with those programs websites. If you’re thinking Higher Ed look into your schools tools mainly Canvas/Black Board which I’m sure is also taught on YouTube. I bet your school has trainings on these as well. Create things for students or staff and put them on a free website building site like Wix. Then you’ve got the start of a portfolio if you want to make the switch.

Try to allow her to do a lot but not too much the first day, ease her in. Allow her to sit in on meetings/planning. Ask her opinion. Treat her like a colleague. Ask her to help with plans and make her own. Ask her to help grade. Maybe split the load. Give her tips but also lots of complements! Inform the kids she is a teacher, she deserves respect! You seem caring and like you love your job though so I’m sure you’ll be great! Have fun."

Stay away from him. He’ll probably try to reach out to you in different ways. Just ignore him. Do not go back to his house. He seems crazy and scary. He may be violent. I dated a guy similar to that and he texted my mom about what a whore I am and that I had my tits pierced and slept around with everyone. It was all lies. My mom basically told me, stay away from him. Wild cards like that are dangerous. Stay safe, move on, who cares about what he says. If your friends do then they aren’t good friends."

relationships,fdi7i4p,t3_elf2lt,1578437113.0,"I feel like these are signs of being depressed. She isn’t happy, no matter what. She feels like maybe if I do this... I’ll be happy. Maybe if we move, maybe if we get dogs, maybe if I’m famous... etc. But she isn’t. 

I would say again push therapy. Maybe you do it too and talk about how celebrities swear by it like Howard Stern, Demi Lavato, Brad Pitt and more...blah blah blah. Don’t imply something is wrong with her. Say it’s just good to get your mind right. I have a feeling she’s quite insecure. (Going on a limb here though) 

Next, say she can do the channel as long as she works a job that makes the amount you want. If she really loves the channel, she should be able to do it in spare time of her job, then if she makes enough money... sure she can quite her other job.  Just say, it’s what your family income needs to make ends meet.  Be firm and explain it is what you need. This is something she has done to you so I think it is fine for you to do. Just make it clear. 

Sit down, talk about it for real. Maybe these need to be two separate conversations though. I would say “plant the seed” about therapy in a low stakes situation when you both are in a good mood. Say you want to try it to and make it seem positive. The money convo should be serious and a sit down convo. Hear her out too though. Let her speak and listen after you’ve made your point. 

Good luck!"
relationships,fde7u3l,t3_eks83d,1578333081.0,"Try being very clear that you need this from her. She needs to overcome her fears, if she can’t alone then she needs to talk to someone. She doesn’t have to code with a computer science degree, there is a lot of other things she could do like create websites for company or tell her to look into instructional design. 

Explain what you need from her and then let it breath for about a month. If no actions are made explain again that you need this. If she still isn’t putting in the effort than you need to ask her what she expects from you, and what you expect from her."

Disclaimer, they have too much fun with it because it is a meme and they think its funny, only really works because I'm a big meanie I think.

I see this two ways, you’re being a bit stubborn, or you don’t really see this relationship going anywhere in the future. Another personal talked about sharing bank passwords with their wife, which to me is quite normal for long term life partners; people doing life together. Do you see her as that? Or do you think she won’t be around for long? 

I’m also a 25f so maybe I just think similarly to you, but my warning signals would be going off by your refusal too. Mainly I would think we aren’t very serious.

teaching,fcynfbi,t3_eje45b,1578083315.0,"1) conference quickly. Ask to stop behavior or there will be consequences then walk away (I call this ninja teaching) 2) letter home. Have them prepared. Explain to the class before if they get this letter they need it signed by the next day by their parents or you will be calling home. Make it easy, something you can check off the poor behavior (talking while teachers talking, disrespecting peers, teacher, or school property, not following instructions) I would set three main rules that everything can kind of fall under. 3) Call home, after that probably a referral. My school insists we follow these steps before referrals any ways. 

Keep it simple. Always follow through. Don’t threaten and not do it. If there are certain situations where you can’t don’t let the whole class know you’re making exceptions. 

I have my letter home if you want it as well in English and in Spanish!"

Next time it happens leave. If she does it on your turf maybe say, that hurt my feelings. Maybe if MIL is so against confrontation it will shock her into denial. If things don’t improve consider if this is something you’re okay with putting up with, then explain to your husband that it’s getting so unbearable you’re not sure if this relationship will work out. Be blunt. If you’re considering leaving you don’t have much to lose but you do have something to gain. I think you need to also realize though, they probably will not change.
