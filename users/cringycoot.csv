no i'm looking for rare opinions of things (usually negative opinions) on things that mostly have a positive feedback.

like you said, you judge everything individually, and not just jump on the ""popularity bandwagon"", which is why there will always be people who has an opposing opinion on a movie/game/book/etc. , that usually opposes the popular opinions"

AskReddit,ff0urt2,t3_er385l,1579472449.0,"in my case,  i just can't play minecraft without getting bored after 20 minutes - the game hold no goal,  purpose or sense of change from playing. 
it takes forever to learn what to do / where to find / how to get different things in the game, so the time consumed playing the game feels empty,  and personally,  feels unsatisfying and boring. 
creative mode is even weirder,  as you can literlly do anything when uou have nothing to do around you (  tho people can build some sick statues). 

tl,dr; the game has no purpose or phazes to it ,  and puts you in an empty,  confusing world that takes long to learn,  and the time used building and growing in it often feels wasted and 
unsatisfying

2. look at some posts of other people in the smogon forums or the pokemon database to see how the actual community works.
3. read all the rules of any tier you are interested in, look at the pokemons popular in the tier, and try to think for yourself what can they do well, then check on the internet how accurate you were.
4. mess around with the team building, copy others' / sample teams from the internet just so you see others play or  learn how battles actually work. 
5. learn the needed vocabulary from the vocab database in the stunfisk subreddit, or from the pokemon database.
6. something that at least help me personally, instead of sitting and rushing on one tier, try to play in different tiers, metagames and gens as possible, both to see which ones you like, and to see common elements/changing-similar elements between the different MG
