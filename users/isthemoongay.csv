MurderedByWords,fdjooqi,t1_fdjmk81,1578481168.0,"It's gossip!
You want to know about some gossip, rumor or deal with something ""spill the tea! "" ""what's the tea?"". 
So ""that's the tea"" = ""that's the deal/situation/gossip"" 
And piping hot tea is extra juicy/good gossip."
AskReddit,fdjkvyv,t3_ell2h8,1578475702.0,"It was a process. It was very rough as a teen but it got less severe the older I got, I had to set hard boundaries when I became an adult. She very slowly started to learn to relax and sit back with me. It helped immensely once I moved out though. She called and texted A LOT at first but once she felt reassured I guess, it became less and less. She just chilled out finally. 
It's been several years since then and while she still worries, I think it's what could be considered a normal amount. 
She hovered over my younger brother and that was kind of a shitty situation because he had an unhealthy dependence on my parents, she was a huge enabler of that for a while. I gently reminded her that he's an adult and she needed to let him make his own decisions and etc. It's helped them both a lot. That's a whole other situation but I promise he's doing better now. 

She's very kind and loving, I can tell she really values my opinions and respects me now. Now that I'm older I realize she has a lot of anxiety, plus her parents were shitty and didn't really care, so I think she just went overboard in the opposite direction of making sure we were ""raised right.""
 I know that's not the case for everyone, but it was for her, I suppose. She's slowly but surely unlearning the behavior, she's not always perfect but I'm just glad she's willing to try. In the end I love her and I forgive her for how she acted all those years. We have a much better relationship now.
