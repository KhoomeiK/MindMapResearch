Example B: Someone tweeted about a problem. I try to help. Asking them in a DM if they want to talk for privacy. Whenever I feel sad I don't tweet about it because it's just sadness. They're people with depression out there that's not easily fixed with music. I'll be fine in a bit"

I read fanfiction and in one fanfic some people were talking about how the headphones looked different. In fact that person wouldnâ€™t take off his hoodie even though he was hot because he was worried that people would see his headphones and put 2 & 2 together. So that made me curious and I had to look it up. I saw an assortment of different colors. I had no luck with finding red over ear wireless headphones that I like until that moment. Then I realized that the autistic community might get mad that a NT is wearing one of their headphones."
