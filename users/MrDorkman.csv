europe,ffet7e8,t3_et6yjy,1579864390.0,This is basically EU politicians telling Apple to fork over big donations like they do in America or be fucked with. That's all it is.
PublicFreakout,ffeskm2,t1_ffenfba,1579863510.0,Tell people to wear eye protection. The masks they do use do nothing. But eye protection would do a great deal to prevent infection through the eye. Glasses would already lessen the chance of getting infected in public a great deal if you dont pick your nose.
PublicFreakout,ffesfip,t1_ffeo0oc,1579863309.0,Masks don't do anything. You need protective eye wear. Ironically Caucasians whom an seemingly ever greater percentage of wears glasses are better protected than the Asians wearing masks but no glasses.
PublicFreakout,ffesdh1,t1_ffenunu,1579863229.0,"How long do you want to stay in Laos ? You would have to stay for months maybe more than half a year for this to blow over. I would go right away, the longer you wait the greater the spread at risky nodes.  

The risk of getting infected right now is really low you would probably be fine passing through Wuhan if you kept your hands to yourself.   

in the Philippines there are like 2 cases, lets say its 200 you are still not very likely to run into the infected and a lot of the infected populace in China can't even travel because they are on lockdown.  

Here is what I would do. Get small swimming goggles for your 2 kids and some kind of glasses for you and the wife you can see out of well enough even if its not sunny hand sanitation wipes and just take a flight home."
AskReddit,ffery9r,t3_erdldp,1579862618.0,Not a whole lot. However I will have to travel by air for business and airports are an elevated risk.
China_Flu,ffer74k,t1_ffea7o8,1579861489.0,He found his niche to have a career in and it happened to become relevant. Basically the university funded this mans research in a virus that is of little interest to the pharma industry.
China_Flu,ffeqd2q,t1_ffeq6u6,1579860254.0,Virus seems to be weeks of fever and crippled lungs not something you want to have
China_Flu,ffeq2xg,t3_et2cjp,1579859825.0,They are taking these extreme measures because the virus is worse than they let on.

This is compounded by the fact that in China there are no small medical facilities only hospitals, therefore everyone who is sick for any reason or just to get checked out would go to a hospital."
China_Flu,ffeottn,t1_ffe812c,1579857921.0,They also told us that only a few hundred got infected and 3 dozen died. Yet I have seen video of corpses in hospital hallways because the doctors couldn't deal with them.
China_Flu,ffdjpaf,t3_et0rrd,1579822317.0,If it could and Wuhan was really ground zero for this thing we would have like hundreds of thousands of cases in Wuhan with tens of thousands dead. Apparently this thing has been going on for a couple of weeks already.
China_Flu,ffdi64h,t3_et170g,1579821378.0,Its probably the fever. 38 closer to 39 is no joke and when you try to ignore it there is a chance you faint.

Cars are tested at 60 miles I think. 100 km/h in Europe, so maybe 62 in the US.

I remember reading crash test reports in German mags and they repeated the fact that the crash test was done at max 100 km/H over and over in the headline and throughout the text. At 100 km/h happens this to the front, at 100km/h happens this to the passengers in the back etc."
