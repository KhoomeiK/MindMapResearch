Make a loud sound of disapproval to snap their attention to you. You gotta be on them the second they do it too. When they are focused on you, tell them to go. Isolate them. You're in charge, not them. Dogs crave approval from those they respect. So isolate them and just watch them, don't let them move from where you put them. Not being allowed to play is a punishment on its own. What's just as important is when they're playing and running around really well and they come over to say hi, reward them with love. Tell them how well they're doing 

After a few minutes of patience, let them go. If you can't physically do any of that then you probably picked a breed you shouldnt have"
