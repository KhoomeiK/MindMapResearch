Also those breathing masks (bane masks) look ridiculous and prohibit your body from receiving proper oxygen.  They hurt your workout and make you look stupid.

Best pro tip is to bring something to listen to music, a gym lock and a water bottle.  If you sweat a lot bring a towel.  Never forget to wipe off any workout equipment you've used or haven't used.  I seen a coworker in the Navy get flesh eating bacteria on his skin from gym equipment.
