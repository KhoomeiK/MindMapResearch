Just imagine that you stopped time, and decided to go for a walk. 

Now imagine a fighter jet breaking the sound barrier at ground level.

Now, you are the fighter jet, and you brake the sound barrier probably as soon as you moved an inch after you froze time.

As you move through the air your body is heating up from friction.

So when you un-freeze time you will promptly explode and probably destroy the entire universe because you'd be moving faster then light."

Hygiene issues, theft issues, they'll probably have they're friends over which will also contribute to the aforementioned issues, particularly theft.

I mean most of the homeless are homeless for a reason. The city I grew up in had really great homeless services and the only reason someone would be left out in the cold was that they were violent and no one knew how to help them until they eventually end up in prison where there are facilities to help them in a safe manner."
