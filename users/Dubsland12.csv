Homeowners are emotional about their homes.   Very few people ever really negotiate anything in life. 
Also, appraising the value on listing, talking the owner through what to do to make it look attractive , working around everyone weirdness is a skill.    Buyers are very picky. People can’t see around that Purple wall, or the backsplash made from bottle caps from your vacations.  

Trust me you don’t want to use an algorithm to sell your house.  It might average out overall but you don’t sell 1000 houses. .  Go look at Zillow for a year or 2 and watch the fluctuations.  A foreclosure or ugly house sales in your area screws it up.  It misses so many factors mIt can work for a mortgage company because it averages out but not for you if you sell every 7 years. 

Where the fat is is in the broker commissions.  

They often take almost half the agents money. That’s ridiculous.  Their biggest expenses are fancy offices, glossy magazines, and advertising

Avg experienced agent makes 40/50k per year and works 35 or so hours per week.  They aren’t getting rich on 1/2 of 3% that takes 90 days to complete. 

There are brokers now listing at 1-2% and buyers agents accepting 2-2 1/2 % .    At the upper end flat fees are common on multi million$ homes. 

Agents get No benefits, have to answer the phone 20 hours a day for the clients, and pay your own expenses, personal advertising, etc.  

Having a good agent vs a bad agent or DIY. probably means 5% and 90 days to the avg. seller. 

There will still be Real Estate agents when they are using flying cars.  The Brokers will take less.

Insurance companies take 15% (if they aren’t scamming) but the cost of implementing this purposely complex nightmare is outrageous.   
Complexity allows profits.  

From a quoted Harvard study. 

“About one-quarter of healthcare cost is associated with administration, which is far higher than in any other country.""

One example Cutler brought up was the case of the 1,300 billing clerks at Duke University Hospital, which has only 900 beds. Those billing specialists are needed to determine how to bill to meet the varying requirements of multiple insurers. Canada and other countries with a single-payer system don't require this level of staffing to administer healthcare.” 

Also,

“There is no such thing as a legitimate price for anything in healthcare,"" says George Halvorson, the former chairman of health maintenance Permanente. ""Prices are made up depending on who the payer is.”

We pay about double what other countries pay, and we don’t get better results.

It can’t.  You can’t have enough information to make a good choice and you don’t have time when a crisis occurs.

Canada
Qatar
France
Norway
New Zealand
Germany
 Hong Kong
The Netherlands
Switzerland
 Singapore

atheism,fcfehf5,t1_fcbyico,1577629139.0,"People can be horrible.  Many religious people use their religion to justify their horrible behavior and beliefs. 

One of the things Atheists find curious is that Religious people that are absolutely sure of their faith always seem to choose the one they were Born into.   They don’t research dozens, Much  less hundreds.   But they know for sure. 

It’s like knowing the town you were born in is the greatest place on the planet even though you’ve never been anywhere else."
realestateinvesting,fcfbr2e,t1_fcc9xgb,1577628421.0,"If you hold awhile the gains are from leveraged money and rising real estate prices.   Real estate only goes up 1% a year over inflation across the entire US.  (A little under 3% w/ inflation). 

But let’s say it’s $100,000 house that’s $1000 a year real gains.  Pretty crappy right?  But it’s $1000 on only $10,000 you put as a down payment.   Now that’s 10% Cash on Cash.  

In 10 years you’ve doubled (more than that with reduced principal).  

It’s not a get rich quick scheme, but it beats renting most of the time.   Also, you can keep capital gains tax free every 2 years on principle residence.   

This is also the general plan for Landlords.  They usually have to put down about 30% though.  After appreciation they go back and refi if rates stay low."

I’d say the awards matter if they mean something.   

I’ve been given dozens and I kept one.  It’s a Nice Glass Presidents Club kind of thing that was accompanied with nice Caribbean trip for 6 or so of us out of roughly 150.  

When awards are routinely given there starts to be an expansion of awards and they start being devalued.  

Do understand that “Rep of the Year “ this year, out the door next is a real thing.   

Sometimes they get swelled heads, sometimes poached, and sometimes they were sort of lucky the previous year and then they were way down the next and the perception is he got lazy.  Management gets angry and offs them as a lesson.   

You seem smarter than that."
