college,fdho5r9,t1_fdhej54,1578426780.0,"My guess is that its easier to schedule 4 different work shifts around the day than schedule 1 long shift. I used to work at Mcdonald's while studying and shorters shifts through out the week were easier than the 8 houra shifts overnight they used to give me.

Right now I'm working at my university and I have short shifts through out the week that work well with my class schedule. I also have 6 hour shuft during the night at a bar and it sucks up my sleeping time."
college,fdhnjla,t1_fdhbjr8,1578426414.0,"I agree with you, right now I'm not following this and its been tough. When I did follow this rules it helped a lot though. My main problem right now is lack of sleep. This last semester I worked during the nights (until 2 or 3am) and I studied all day with only 3 or 4 hours between classes and my jobs. This meant that sometimes I had to get out of work at 2am to finish some assignments (art major, so art projects) and then go directly back to class without slept at all. I slept during class a lot, and managed to pass because others knew my situation and helped me with my art history material."

college,fdhmr7h,t3_elcmhp,1578425941.0,"Not easily, not gonna lie. Its pretty rough, I sometimes wish I would just die so I don't have to do all this work. I'm stressed out more often than not, and sometimes I barely get any sleep during the week. I have one job at my university during the day, and another in a local bar suring the night. Granted, I could be more organazied with my time and a but more responsible with my assignments (doing them ahead of time), but its still tough with all the amount of things I get. I'm an art student so I get big projects that take a lot of extra hours to finish. Its doable, but its hard too."

Yes, the customer also fought about the pickle box xD"

He said the switches (as he called them) were so everyone had the same speed without it dropping or something?"
