That’s not how it works.

Presumed innocence is not innocence in the eyes of the law.

Otherwise they couldn’t try you in the first place.

Not guilty is not innocence in eyes of the law either. Otherwise they couldn’t try a person when new evidence came to light.

politics,ffb4g0h,t1_ffb2yop,1579751530.0,"Yes but a court doesn’t determine innocence. They just presume it. That’s why they use the phrase “not guilty”.

A court can’t announce your innocence. Only your lack of guilt.

Another court with a lower burden of proof can still find you guilty of the same crime for example.

If the court announced your innocence then their judgement would have to be overturned in order to be tried by a civil court for the offense in question.

Your conflating presumed innocence with verified innocence.

Finding you “not guilty” means your still presumed innocent. In other words you might be still be guilty but it can’t be proven.
