relationship_advice,fcirzsc,t1_fcir8z5,1577668425.0,i used to think that too man and still do kinda think that to be honest. But I’ve heard success stories before. Time apart can put things into perspective. When I say break its not like get back together after it; more like re-convene and decide mutually how to move forward from there. But I think you’re probably right. Thanks!

Naruto,fc5vjui,t3_egd8tb,1577466817.0,im crying
Naruto,fc5v8he,t1_fc5u81v,1577466628.0,i think detective pikachu works because pokemon are made up creatures. i doubt naruto or any alike anime would work as live action simply because the casting will never be completely right and people will always have a problem with it (including me). the magic of anime is that humans can express themselves in ways that real life people cant. plus if i see those 3 naruto whiskers on a real person i’d roll my eyes because it will probably look dumb
