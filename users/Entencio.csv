Tried this again doing six at a time. 4 succeeded, with only one missing finger, while two failed, yet their supports printed?

> In 1924, Chanel made an agreement with the Wertheimer brothers, Pierre and Paul, directors of the perfume house Bourjois, creating a new corporate entity, Parfums Chanel. The Wertheimers agreed to manage production, marketing, and distribution of Chanel No. 5. The Wertheimers would receive a 70 percent share of the company, and Théophile Bader, founder of the Paris department store Galeries Lafayette, would receive 20 percent. Bader had been instrumental in brokering the business connection by introducing Chanel to Pierre Wertheimer at the Longchamps races in 1922.[5] For 10 percent of the stock, Chanel licensed her name to Parfums Chanel and removed herself from involvement in all business operations.[1]:95 Later, unhappy with the arrangement, Chanel worked for more than twenty years to gain full control of Parfums Chanel. She said that Pierre Wertheimer was ""the bandit who screwed me"".[1]:153

>World War II brought with it the Nazi seizure of all Jewish-owned property and businesses, providing Chanel with the opportunity to gain control of Parfums Chanel and its most profitable product, Chanel No. 5. The directors of Parfums Chanel, the Wertheimers, were Jewish, and Chanel used her position as an ""Aryan"" to petition German officials to legalize her right to sole ownership.

>On 5 May 1941, Chanel wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets. Her grounds for proprietary ownership were based on the claim that Parfums Chanel ""is still the property of Jews"" and had been legally ""abandoned"" by the owners.[1]:150

>I have an indisputable right of priority ... the profits that I have received from my creations since the foundation of this business ... are disproportionate ... [and] you can help to repair in part the prejudices I have suffered in the course of these seventeen years.[1]:152–153

>Chanel was not aware that the Wertheimers, anticipating the forthcoming Nazi confiscations, had, in May 1940, legally turned control of Parfums Chanel over to a Christian, French businessman and industrialist Felix Amiot. At the end of World War II, Amiot returned Parfums Chanel to the Wertheimers.[5][1]:150

Glad it worked out for the Wertheimers. In my opinion if you choose to use Chanel No. 5 you must be aware of the history and are instead wearing it to support the plight of holocaust victims. Or something to that effect. 

My boss is French and Coco Chanel is a huge influence on her and my internal conflict arises whenever Chanel is mentioned."
