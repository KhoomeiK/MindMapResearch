HazbinHotel,ff2u7f7,t1_ff27t1c,1579524337.0,I tagged my post as NSFW so his backstory has been added!
HazbinHotel,ff2u4tu,t3_er6p5z,1579524257.0,"`In his former life, prior to becoming quite a lusty Jackalope in Hell, he was an everyday Joe, 21 years old with nothing but the horizon and a broken down van. That was, until he spotted little Emily on the playground. It was the early 90s, so parents would innocently drop their children at the park and go about their daily lives, promising to come back and pick them up later. After much praise and adoration, Emily was coaxed into his van and taken away. 

She was the first, but certainly not the last, of the infamous “Candy Land” cult in rural Idaho. From the age of 21, till he was just about to turn 40, James Thurton ran the cult of over 250+ girls, ranging from the oldest being 20, and the youngest being a two month old born from one of the kidnapped girls. It was speculated that Thurton had been the root cause of most of the missing girls in the rural Idaho area. It was also speculated that he fathered over 100 girls in “Candy Land,"" even sexually assaulting his own daughters, dubbing him the “Jackrabbit of Idaho.” 

There is no evidence of any boys being in the warehouse, speculating that any boys that were born were most likely murdered.

Every heart on Chip's body is a direct representation of a girl he sexually assaulted, this includes his pupils and the shape of his horns.`"
HazbinHotel,ff2t3rk,t1_ff2cq48,1579523022.0,Nah that's too easy. It's a little more...graphic than that.
HazbinHotel,ff2t2xn,t1_ff2gchx,1579522993.0,Thank you! <3
HazbinHotel,ff24a98,t1_ff244by,1579493407.0,"It's a bit NSFW, I'm not sure what the rules are of this subreddit. I'd love to post it so long as disturbing content is allowed."
HazbinHotel,ff240av,t1_ff23vvr,1579493191.0,"It's ACTUALLY called ""Chippendales,"" apologies! It's a really popular dance troupe best known for male stripteases."
HazbinHotel,ff23srz,t1_ff23p8g,1579493029.0,"Actually it's a reference to a really popular male strip bar called ""Chip & Dale's"""
HazbinHotel,ff1ziaa,t1_ff1zf7w,1579489825.0,I've already screencapped this and saved it on my discord xD You are immortalized!
HazbinHotel,ff1ze5t,t1_ff1zc06,1579489741.0,"Given his past and how he even ended up in Hell in the first place, your theory lines up perfectly. I think I'm gonna steal that."
HazbinHotel,ff1zb7c,t1_ff1z71h,1579489683.0,"Not going to lie, that's hilarious and I legit didn't even think of that. Thank you! xD"
wholesomememes,ff1o11f,t3_er27i7,1579482383.0,"Oh man this makes me uncomfortable. I was an only child growing up and neither of my parents really KNEW how to be a parent so I was always dropped off with my grandparents. Anytime I FINALLY got to see my mom or dad I'd go bonkers trying to catch them up on all my ""child"" shit (I hadn't seen them for days) and after like a minute it would be the screaming of ""SHUT UP"" and ""Wow do you even hear yourself talking?"" Parents sometimes don't realize small things like this become something kids remember for the rest of their lives."
dogpictures,fdt6p6d,t1_fdt6gym,1578712629.0,I'm the same way with my boy and my girl. I picked up my boy the other day and his shoulder crunched (he's old not because I hurt him or anything) and I just QUICKLY put him down and fed him treats. It hurts knowing how old he's getting...
dogpictures,fdt5vb8,t1_fdt3bhr,1578712317.0,"Thank you so much! They're both still super healthy - the only problem they have is my boy has slight asthma from their prior home (when he was 9, he came from a smokers house) and my girl had a thyroid issue. They're healthy otherwise, though. 😊"
dogpictures,fdqsy57,t3_emqrl1,1578674204.0,Oh I'm so not prepared for this. I have two 19 year old cats and my dog is super attached to one of them. The day she passes is the day my doggo will probably never be the same. :(
funny,fdqskyq,t3_emq12p,1578673980.0,"I've found the best way to keep your keyboard clean is with a mechanical membrane keyboard. Just pluck the keys, shake out the membrane, and put it back. I honestly haven't had any keys stick or stop working, and I have 4 cats and a dog AND I smoke weed/eat/drink at my computer at all times. Mine's a K68 Corsair keyboard, highly recommend."
interestingasfuck,fdix2vo,t3_elj9r4,1578453007.0,Me when it's getting dark in Minecraft and there are far too many monsters outside.
TownofSalemgame,fckjeds,t1_fckinrn,1577726629.0,"If they want to keep that logic then they should gray out the name in the KEY. So instead of it being a bright red ""DISGUISER"" it should be grayed out like STONED is. Then at least we know we HAD a disguiser, not that we HAVE one."
cats,fc45sod,t3_eg00ir,1577407385.0,"Holy crap are our cats siblings?!  They look nearly identical!  [https://imgur.com/a/yfLPhAV](https://imgur.com/a/yfLPhAV) Is yours a Ragdoll, too?"
