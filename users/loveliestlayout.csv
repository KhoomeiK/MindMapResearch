Parenting,fcgccb1,t1_fcg7rco,1577638561.0,"Thank you! I don‚Äôt even have kids. My opinion is from being an older sibling who had to watch younger ones and the resentment from these people who have been in my same situation is mind boggling to me. 

Lmao like they really hated their siblings or their families. We would watch movies and play games and have fun. I hung out with my siblings when my parents were there anyway. We would just keep hanging out if they ever had to run out. I had friends and a healthy social life, but family was always family. 

Maybe these people just had shitty families. I think if I didn‚Äôt think I could count on my family members when I need them, then I may resent them for the times that they need me. Call it ‚Äúpalming off‚Äù when I‚Äôm asked to watch my younger siblings."
Parenting,fcg17jg,t1_fcfspva,1577635536.0,"It‚Äôs almost like the parenting has a lot to do with how the kids bond.

The reason I went out of my way to give my example is because I know that reddit especially is filled with siblings who only resent each other or never really bonded. People don‚Äôt highlight how it can be a good thing and that this woman doesn‚Äôt have to feel like her time to have more kids has passed. 

But I‚Äôm glad you went out of your way to reinforce the hopelessness of her situation. You and the rest of these people crying about how their older siblings didn‚Äôt pay attention to them may just drown out the fact that my family had healthy and happy and super strong bonds across a very wide age range. 


Parenting is so important. If the bond is highlighted and reinforced by the family structure then the kids bond. 

If it‚Äôs not then they don‚Äôt."
Parenting,fcg09bd,t1_fcftld2,1577635329.0,"You have an interesting understanding of a family if you see having an older sibling watch a younger sibling for a grocery run or date night here and there as ‚Äúpalming off‚Äù a child. 
Maybe your family was hostile and no one liked each other, but my family was close knit and we looked out for each other.

I love my younger siblings to death. I never resented them because I had to watch them every now and then. They‚Äôre family. I would die for them. 

There are situations where there is neglect and abandonment. Where a kid has to grow up before their time to take care of their younger siblings.

But there is a helluva lot of family dynamics and helping each other out in a healthy and happy way before then. To be honest you sound crazy jumping Immediately to ‚Äúpalming off‚Äù and begging internet strangers not to treat their family like a family. Your family sounds like a bunch of strangers that begrudgingly count every ‚Äúfavor‚Äù they do amongst themselves."
Parenting,fcfnrid,t1_fcfl12x,1577632012.0,That‚Äôs a really good age difference tho. You have some help with the kiddo: you can definitely leave a 4-5 year old with a 14-15 year old for date nights and grocery shopping so you don‚Äôt have to drag em with you. My oldest brother is about 11 years younger than my youngest brother and they are super duper close. Little bro is like 18 now and our oldest brother is his hero.
