electronics,fep4dj8,t1_fenfz7b,1579311868.0,"I don't personally do too much with 3D design at work, but I do occasionally design enclosures for hobby work (I'll typically used FreeCAD to design sheet-metal enclosures, and OpenSCAD for any other type). While designing the layout, yes we'll typically generate a 3D model of the board and see how it fits with a 3D model of the enclosure. Depending on the company, they may have a mechanical guy check this though. In my experience, simulation software (like LTSPICE, PSPICE, etc) are rarely used for digital designs, and more commonly used for analog designs. I'm sure there's specialized software for radio-frequency designs, but I'm less familiar with that area. As far as thermal stuff goes, I've only ever seen mechanical guys run those simulations. Typically, I'll calculate the worst-case thermal energy the components will generate, and the mechanical guys will run the simulations. I'm sure it's not outside the realm of possibility for an embedded engineer to be asked to do it though. Personally, I love every aspect of embedded engineering. I do prefer bare-metal coding (i.e. working with microcontrollers instead of operating systems), but if you're doing something high-performance, like computer vision, then you're software is probably going to be complex enough that an OS is necessary (though there are exceptions). If you're working for a company, the least enjoyable thing is probably going to be red-tape/bureaucracy. My previous company mandated that our designs followed a specific  format, which was a bit annoying because we had to do very tedious things that our EDA tool didn't facilitate. It can also feel a bit disheartening when you pour hours into a schematic, and it gets handed off to somebody else to do layout. But when I do embedded engineering as a hobby, and I have control over everything, it's great fun. If I had to pick a part I dislike the most, it would be managing my inventory of components. I have component reels on shelves and boxes, and it's a little annoying to track qty, make sure I put them back in the right place, and enter new components into my database when I buy them. There are component reel machines out there that track that stuff automatically, but they are super expensive."

gifs,fe4kxvm,t1_fe3qvup,1578860420.0,"I mean, eventually, we'll probably make non-volatile RAM that's faster than our current PC RAM, then there won't be much point in making the distinction between RAM and hard-disk; it'd just be the same physical thing (unless we also continually improve volatile RAM speeds accordingly, in which case, NVRAM becomes the hard disk and volatile RAM is used just as it is today). Regardless, I don't think it's unreasonable that we'll want several TB of 'RAM' in the near future. Just has to be cheap, fast, and non-volatile for that to make sense."
ECE,fe4jobm,t1_fe3y558,1578860028.0,"Just my 2 cents, as an EE/CE now designing embedded systems hardware; in the real world, 99% of the math I do is Ohm's law and P=V*I, and the remaining 1% is described in the datasheet of whatever part I'm using. I wouldn't expect people to constantly solve difficult equations unless their job specifically requires that they deal with magnetics or EM. I wouldn't expect anybody to need to know the derivations of any formulae unless they were in a theoretical or academic role either. Just my experience though; I may be mistaken."

electronics,fdsyohj,t1_fdr4ohx,1578709661.0,"In addition to the acid trap issue the article mentions (not an issue these days) right angles also make it more likely for traces to crack in high vibration applications. 45 traces also have this weakness to some extent of course. Curved traces would probably be ideal.  Furthermore, right angles may cause hot spots in high-current applications, as a disproportionate amount of current will be flowing on the inside of the corner than the outside. Again, 45s still exhibit this to some extent. Lastly, for high voltage applications, the sharp outside corner may exhibit corona discharge (introducing inefficiency in the circuit), or encourage arcing at that point, which can be hazardous (albeit, it's unlikely a hobbyist is going to be dealing with the voltage levels that these phenomena occur at, and again, 45s would have the same problem, but to a lesser extent). So I'd say a hobbyist's biggest concern is likely to be vibration, but even that is a rare problem to have. There are just enough weird edge cases that I'd personally always go 45 or curved."

Not as powerful as the likes of solidworks or fusion360, but they'll get 99% of any hobby projects I'm  doing done. And being an adult now, I honestly find it less of a hassle to just buy software legitimately than deal with pirating stuff."

electronics,fdsaou3,t1_fdq27o9,1578698250.0,"Embedded engineer here. There are 2 sides to it, software and hardware (for some reason, job search websites don't seem to understand that embedded hardware engineering is a thing; only software. Anyway...). As a hardware embedded systems engineer, your tasks may include gathering requirements and architecting the system at a high level (although this is sometimes done by a dedicated ""systems engineer""), doing the actual dirty work of component selection, schematic capture/circuit design (this is what I would consider to be most normal/proverbial embedded systems work), BoM minimizing, supply chain management (typically handled by a production team though), and PCB layout (though some places have dedicated layout engineers). On the software side, you're probably dealing with linux a lot, writing drivers, perhaps working with various real-time OS's, possibly writing C code for various microcontrollers, and there are opportunities to write some specialized algorithms depending on your application, but in my experience, the company usually gets outside help, unless it's a core strength. Typically, for good algorithms, you need somebody who is a math wiz, subject matter expert, and ideally a decent coder. And the actual systems we work on is basically anything on a PCB. Computer monitors, the electronics inside cars, medical equipment, kids toys, military stuff, power tools, kitchen appliances, industrial robots, the list goes on."
electronics,fds900l,t1_fdrrwsf,1578697093.0,"This is true! It's more of a problem with thinner boards in high-vibration environments. I'd wager fab houses have also updated their manufacturing materials/techniques to mitigate this over the years. Another reason greybeards detest 90 degree angles is because it used to be that during the manufacturing process, copper etchant would pool near acute angles, and dissolve the copper more than intended in that area, so if your traces were thin, and took sharp turns, they could be eaten away. Again, due to updated manufacturing techniques, this hasn't been an issue for many years."
