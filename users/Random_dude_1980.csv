When the stuff in the kit ran out, I decided to improvise; one (or two) electric shocks and multiple times of almost creating an incontrolable fire later and I decided it was time to quit, before my curiosity got the better of me."

memes,fenzvsy,t3_eq0c3n,1579293180.0,"“Everybody”? Perhaps everybody in the US; but that isn’t EVERYBODY. As a British citizen, I care an awful lot. Mainly because this entitled POS shouldn’t get to live a “normal” life after the privileged upbringing he’s had. That’s what you get when you’re born into royalty, you don’t get to quit just like that. You have to do your fucking job and that is to do all sorts of shit for your country that you may not want to do, but you have to stfu and do it! For your country, who has paid every single penny of your education, holidays, the clothes on your back and everything else you have not had to work for. Now you marry a starlet and want to go off on your merry way. Well. Sure. Go. But make sure you pay EVERYTHING back to the hardworking people of the UK. AND renounce your titles, properties and everything else the country has given you. And please don’t go to Canada and have them foot the bill for your security entourage."

I take responsibility FOR MY OWN FUCKING ACTIONS, but not for those of a degenerated pervert! Never! These subhumans do not represent me, And I’ve already said, if I was there, I would have confronted the guy. It’s cunts like you that put all men, regardless of how upstanding they may be, in the same basket, along with the soulless perverts. So, fuck you and your male-hating bullshit!"
offmychest,fe31n6q,t1_fe2kib9,1578845084.0,"You tolerate being lobbed in with all the perverts if you want, but I won’t. It’s got nothing to do with “manliness”, so don’t be so disingenuous. It’s got all to do with being unfairly judged!"

AnimalsBeingBros,fdxanx9,t1_fdwniay,1578766913.0,"Some sort of rather severe illness, as a result of an untreated spider bite. The cause was apparently the spider bite all along, which, if not immediately fatal, if left untreated, starts to wreak havoc on the internal organs, until the root cause is addressed. Thing is, there are no spiders like that anywhere near here, hence the somewhat bizarre explanation of flying spiders! Much easier to have said “it came in a ship”. But, apparently, spiders flying (over oceans!) are an actual thing. When he told me, I was like “wtf is he on?!” Then I googled it and it happens it’s true. Freaky shit that, but ho hum."

AnimalsBeingBros,fdvtycs,t3_en5fe6,1578751465.0,"I hope you make a full recovery soon and you get to the bottom of it. A guy who works with me was in a really bad way some years back. Doctors couldn’t find the cause of the illness and it turns out, a spider “may” have flown from another  country, carried by the wind, over a body of water 20 miles wide and somehow, after all that, managed to bite him, despite there being no bite marks. Anyway, they got to the bottom of it and he made a full recovery. Point is, they found out what it was, and I’m sure they will with you, too, as you have the best specialists looking after you. All the best."

daddit,fcyd4ko,t3_ejg65p,1578078343.0,"Fully agree! This afternoon I met my wife and daughter for coffee after work, before coming home for the day. We where at one of the major leisure areas in our town; basically an open “al fresco” square with loads of cafes, restaurants etc. Anyway, my daughter (who is almost 2) asked me to put on a plastic silver tiara with fake diamonds and pink feathers (very discrete). I put it on and ran around the place with her. If my daughter asked me to dress up as her favourite princess I would do so in a heartbeat. It wouldn’t be a pretty sight and my wife would never let me live it down, but the look of happiness on her face would be worth it. When they ask, we must obey!"

Thus, you will be forced in having to share your space with other people much more than here on earth, meaning that yes, it would be miserable."
