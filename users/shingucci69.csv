Even if you're not smoking tobacco with it (which most people do where I live) you're still inhaling smoke into your lungs. Just because it isn't *as bad* as alcohol or heroin or whatever doesn't mean it's completely harmless, and if you're smoking every single day for years then yeah that's gonna do shit to your lungs. I have friends who literally, wholeheartedly think that smoking weed is actually good for them, worst part is that the friend who is most adamant about this actually has a mild form of schizophrenia, lol. And on the point of people saying you can't get addicted to it... It's bullshit. Yes, you can't get *physically* addicted to it, I'm not arguing that, but you can absolutely be mentally dependent on it, which is almost just as bad. Most addictions, especially common ones like alcohol and cigarettes, are a lot more mental than physical anyway. Just because you aren't convulsing over not hitting a bowl doesn't mean it's good for you. If you take *any* mind altering substance near daily and/or need it to function properly, you've got a problem and that shit is bad for you, period."

danganronpa,fcto1sh,t3_eilebh,1577950934.0,"THH- Byakuya. One of my favourite characters ever since I first got into the franchise, I'm a sucker for the rich jerk archetype, and just jerk characters in general, so long as they're entertaining, which Byakuya most certainly is. I would hate the guy in real life, but as a character? He's hilarious. Every interaction with him is incredibly entertaining, and every word tinged with disgust that drips out of his mouth is pure gold. His colourful vocabulary means no two of his insults are ever the same, making him a consistent joy to watch. His philosophy of 'life is a game' is cool too, and his backstory explains why he's such a jerk. I really appreciate his subtle, understated development, and he's a surprisingly understandable and even moderately relatable guy when you look closer. Watching him get bitch slapped in chapter 4 is very satisfying. And oh yes, my favourite Ace Attorney character is Miles Edgeworth. 

SDR2- The man, the myth, the legend, the lucky garbage trash can himself, Nagito Komaeda. I'm not exactly a prolific poster here, nor do I generally talk about my favourites in extensive detail, but let me take a minute here, or several, to just gush over my favourite character in the entire series. Komaeda is really everything I could want in a character, and I was instantly charmed by this guy whose hair looks like a science experiment gone wrong. Despite his first appearances being fairly generic, I still liked him enough, but him showing his true colours in the first trial was enough to make me fall head over heels in love, to the point where he immediately surpassed all of my previous favourites by the end of it. Every facet of his character pulls together to make this incredibly charismatic, interesting, entertaining and downright *tragic* character. The way his luck cycle hurts those who get too close to him; how that in turn causes him to desperately cling to the abstract concept of hope overcoming any despair because that's his only reason for living; how his disease perfectly lines up with his compulsions, obsessions and actions in the game; how his self loathing and smug-yet-inferior attitude reflects on his interactions with other characters, namely Hajime; and how this is all groundwork for him snapping in chapter 5 and creating *hands down* the best trial in the series. I just have a whole lot of love for his character, and despite SDR2 being my least favourite game in the series, Komaeda is the shining light that cuts through the darkness for me, my beacon of hope, if you will. Shitty puns aside, he was simply the character that kept me on my toes the entire game, being the only consistent source of intrigue, tension and mystery for me in such an otherwise jovial cast. And potentially my favourite thing about Komaeda, is the fact that he doesn't even *know* why what he's doing is so morally bankrupt. Unlike the other rivals who just embrace their status as lone wolves and amp the dick metre up to eleven, he's genuinely trying to do what he thinks is right, albeit in an incredibly twisted fashion. He also takes the black-and-white concept of 'hope good, despair bad,' shits on it, rips it up and throws it headfirst into the incinerator, which is something I appreciate as someone who enjoys commentary on the various shades of grey contained within human morality. He's held the throne for over 2 years now, and he'll forever be my favourite character in the series. I think I should stop now, you can tell from the length of this section alone how much I love him haha. And his JP voice is absolutely god tier, hats off to Megumi Ogata for such a stellar performance, I really don't think Komaeda would be quite the same without her.

UDG- Yep, I'm doing the spin-off game too, because why the hell not. My favourite UDG character is, without a doubt, Toko. I was initially going to talk about her in the THH section instead of Byakuya, because I technically like her a bit more, but speaking *just* in terms of the first game, I like Byakuya more. She was always one of my favourites anyway, but like most, it was UDG that elevated her to being in my personal top 3 characters, and she's hands down the best female character in the series to me. She's funny, flawed, relatable, interesting, has great development, a great relationship with Komaru... She's just so great, and everything about her is so great! Some people dislike the way her DID is portrayed with Genocider Syo, but it was never something I took particular issue with. Her two contrasting personalities work so well together, and no matter who she is, she's always entertaining. Her superiority-inferiority complex, her often blunt and abrasive attitude, her trust issues, her cynical outlook... they're all things I can relate to, to varying degrees. She's such a bitch, but when you really get to understand her background, it's so obvious why, and I just want to give her a hug (even though she would probably spit on me or slap me or call me a pervert or something lol, maybe even do all three).

V3- You've probably picked up on a certain trend by now, if you've read through everything (if anyone actually does, I salute you), and that's the fact that I have a preference for the rivals of the series, so I'm sure it comes as a surprise to absolutely no one that my favourite character from V3 is Kokichi. I'm running out of steam now so this section will probably end up being comparatively shorter, but rest assured I love this small purple gremlin, for many of the same reasons that I love Komaeda and Byakuya. He's super hilarious, *by far* the funniest character in the game with the best cast interactions, don't @ me. This is very superficial, but his sprites are pretty damn amazing too. I love that there's enough mystery and loose ends with him to allow breathing room for speculation and theories, but that there's also enough canon implication toward his true nature and character. He also has a sort of 'reverse arc,' which in this series especially is something I definitely appreciate, considering most character arcs boil down to 'weak boi become strong.' It's heavily implied, even nearly outright confirmed that Kokichi truly did hate killing, but the killing game broke him until he was forced to do the one thing he despised the most, to become the monster that he'd been trying to stop since the very beginning. It begs the question, how long can you wear the mask before you become the mask? I just think he's a super fascinating and fun character. And reading back on this now, this section is definitely not the shortest, lol. 

Well, that is my super basic taste in DR characters, props to anyone who actually managed to drag themselves through that essay! I'm going to do a few honourable mentions, *because I can,* although those will be a lot shorter. So, here we go, honourable mentions to:

Mikan, for being an interesting take on the fanservice trope and an excellent killer; Komaru, for being a female protagonist who's fun and endearing and actually getting to live through her game; Monaca, for being an excellent villain who's emotional manipulation makes me sick in a good way; Kotoko, for being a painfully relatable character with an interesting psyche; Nagisa, for being voiced by Mariya Ise (yes this is a legitimate reason to like a character), and for being an actual voice of reason who genuinely struggles with the ramifications and morality of his and the other Warriors' actions; Angie, for being a funny, manipulative little bitch; Kaede, for being a great protagonist while she was alive (rip), and producing what is probably my favourite twist in the series; Himiko, for being incredibly relatable and having a really interesting arc about the consequences of emotional suppression; Tsumugi, because she's a cute weeb with an excellent performance in the best final chapter in the series; Kaito, for being one of the most solid characters in the series and a great foil to Kokichi; and lastly, Korekiyo for looking cool as fuck, having amazing FTEs, and having the best breakdown in the best third chapter."

Same way being a guy can be better than being a girl in some ways, and vice versa. It's stupid and unfortunate but I think the scales generally balance out.

2. Not true. Society is roughly 50% men, and realistically speaking, the world is mostly controlled by men, and most people in power are men. Saying society 'hates men' just doesn't really make sense, lol

3. I think this is just a teenager/general person thing. Everyone has hormones. But out of all the things on this list, I'd guess this is the one that's most likely to be a gender thing

ShitPostCrusaders,fcqoem3,t3_eigjx3,1577889536.0,"This is me, it's ridiculously easy to get me to like villainous characters. Within the first few episodes of him being introduced he was already one of my favourites (and is now literally my favourite character in the series)"
unpopularopinion,fcpwdtj,t1_fcmwuee,1577873580.0,"Yeah, you're right. Sorry, I just see a lot of things on the front page and specifically this sub that boil down to 'poor men women are so privileged' so my kneejerk reaction to posts like this is thinking that's the message they're trying to spread. That's not your fault though, so that's my bad. From my anecdotal experience, women do get shit over stuff like this as well, just maybe not as much? I honestly don't really know cause I don't get out much lol. But I agree that we should all stop concerning ourselves with who other people do or don't sleep with, regardless of whether they're male or female."
unpopularopinion,fcmrgye,t3_ehu9rf,1577788600.0,"Lol I was with you until this turned into yet another post about how hard men have it and how easy women have it. Being a woman doesn't suddenly mean you're exempt from criticisms about being single or a virgin, as I and many others know first hand. You could've just left the post as it is instead of turning into 'poor men uwu :'('"

Edit- not that I care but why did this get downvoted lol"
teenagers,fcj1la7,t3_ehd0nz,1577674997.0,"This reminds me of a time I stood up too fast and started feeling dizzy, and for some reason, instead of just sitting back down like a normal person would, I decided to keep standing and see if the feeling would go away. After about 1 minute, black splotches began to consume my vision and my ears began ringing, along with my hearing going all fuzzy; it sounded like I was underwater. Then when my vision had almost disappeared I finally sat down, it took about 10 minutes for my hearing to go back to normal and the ringing sound to stop, and for my vision to be normal again. I was worried I had permanently damaged my hearing or sight or something lmao"
teenagers,fciu0ru,t1_fchrxe2,1577669789.0,"It's true. I worked in a cafe, so not technically a restaurant, but similar. It was hell lmao I ended up quitting after one particularly bad day that literally made me cry"
danganronpa,fcauc39,t3_eguj2k,1577576772.0,I don't mind them if I could see them working outside of the killing game. Not a fan if they're only shipped for the sake of it though
AskMen,fc4p5q6,t1_fc4nlj8,1577423485.0,"Your argument is still stupid as fuck. I could turn around and say that because meat eaters are too selfish to give up eating animals, they'll be selfish in a relationship. I obviously don't believe that, but it's the equivalent of what you're saying, and it's just as stupid. But you seem like one of those fuckwits who will come up with any reason to discredit vegans and veganism, so I'm not going to waste my breath here any longer. Have fun thinking that diet and ability to stay committed in a relationship are in any way connected to each other lmao"
DRRankdown2,fc4m4t8,t3_e41cyc,1577420755.0,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Althought, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
AskMen,fc4le5d,t1_fc4iko1,1577420104.0,"Lmfao that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. If vegans eat beyond burgers they can't commit to a relationship? Yeah that's a stretch if I've ever seen one. If meat eaters can't even give up eating animals, how can they commit to a relationship?! That's how stupid your point sounds. The two have literally no relation to each other."
danganronpa,fc4hepf,t3_efnkmm,1577416728.0,Akane being higher than Toko gave me an aneurysm
AskMen,fc4gug8,t1_fc45k40,1577416265.0,"Someone else has already told you this, but it's not the taste that vegans are against. It's the killing of animals required to get the taste. So if you can skip the middle step (killing animals) and still get the same end result (taste), how is that not being committed to not killing animals? There's no animal cruelty happening. Your entire argument is extremely stupid and just seems like another nonsensical way to bash vegans for nothing."
AskMen,fc41w8c,t1_fc40uun,1577404452.0,"That's stupid... What if people just like the taste of meat but would prefer to not eat a dead animal? If you can get the same taste without the dead animal part, what's wrong with that?"
DRRankdown2,fc40xlk,t1_fc34vgk,1577403737.0,Sure! I'll PM you
DRRankdown2,fc29lzu,t1_fc1yfg1,1577347207.0,"I'd assume it's either bears or whoever is doing mikan, I did a thing and based on my calculations Kyoko and mikan are most likely to be the bottom 2. I'm almost certain bears is gonna get assigned kyoko, and she tends to take a while, so I'd say it's either her or whoever is doing mikan, if it's the latter maybe they're taking ages because they're trying to think of new stuff to say about her since she's already had a pretty comprehensive cut? Idk though but I agree with you that this is getting a bit silly, it seems like its probably going to stretch out to an entire month at this point."
