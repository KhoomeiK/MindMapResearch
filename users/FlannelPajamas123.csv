Letting your employees know that they are valued and you appreciate them, goes further than a monetary raise with negative morals.  It's human nature to want to be productive, fit in, be liked and appreciated.   I don't know if you've ever actually liked your job and enjoyed being appreciated, but I'd take that over a bit more money any day.  By improving morale USPS will also improve the productivity from each employee.  Disgruntled employees are dangerous to any business.

I hope to be a foster home for rescues/abandoned dogs when my husband finally retires and we settle into a forever home.  Anything that I can learn to make those dogs lives easier and happier, I am down!  Thank you for being a dog professional, in whatever field you are in.  We created these wonderful animals to be our family and they need as much help as possible, and care just like every other family member."

But I completely agree with you, this is not an appropriate greeting and stuff bodies is NEVER a good thing with dogs.  Thank you for the link, I will read into it.  I'm always wanting to learn more, even if sometimes I may have a deferent opinion.  That's all it is, my opinion and I appreciate yours as well.

Edit:. Ok I read the link and am on the same page, I also do not think dominance training is a good idea or accurate.  But that's totally different from a dog ""acting"" dominant, which is what I was referring too.  Very interesting and good read though, thank you."
