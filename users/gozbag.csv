dogpictures,fcyek86,t1_fcyearg,1578078962.0,Just down the coast actually!
dogpictures,fcydykg,t1_fcydbdo,1578078627.0,Hopefully she gets easier for you. Our girl took a lot of persistence but it's easier when they look so cute.
dogpictures,fcycqjf,t1_fcycaah,1578078141.0,I'm not sure how reliable the results are but we were curious. We dont know much about where our girl was found but she was in a kill shelter before moving to her foster home. So glad we had a rescue and she's turned out to be not much trouble!
dogpictures,fcybbkg,t3_ejgol6,1578077594.0,"I think she might be my Dog's Hungarian sister! I've got a photo of her in my post history. 
Ours is a rescue from Romania. She's part Daschaund and part Jack Russel with some toy breeds mixed in according to her DNA test. 
Shes the sweetest little thing. Nervous of new people especially men but when she likes you all she wants is cuddles!"
Gunners,fbggmti,t3_ed8ddo,1576848853.0,Mine was delivered Monday but I sign for it. It's been sat in the Post Office since then! Can't wait to get it tomorrow!
