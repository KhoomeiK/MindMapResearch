Coincidentally, since I work with children, I cannot work while sick for fear of spreading the illness to those with weaker immune systems. So I’ve had to take a lot of “vacation” days. I’ve also started carrying Lysol wipes with me and periodically wipe down everything I touch after I get out of work (keys, steering wheel, car door handle, front door knob, phone, stair railing, bathroom door handle, etc.) until I can get into the shower. Still get sick. Still don’t get paid. Technically they say I need a doctor’s note, but they don’t really enforce that."

You can say “kids don’t have anything to be stressed about” all you want (not you specifically), but the truth is that children are dealing with a lot. They are learning who they are and what they like and how to communicate and they worry about things and have hardships just like the rest of us. Videogames are a way for them to forget that stress. Yes, it can get unhealthy. They can start to depend on them, just like with any form of escapism. Also videogames are just plain fun. 

But instead of talking with and helping the child, this parent decided to try to scare the crap out of them by smashing their games and posting it all over the internet. It’s disgusting. Maybe the reason this kid was so obsessed with videogames was to try to escape your crazy ass for a while. It’s emotional abuse. It’s a shame so many people still see stuff like this as normal."
insaneparents,fejxdwo,t1_fejuo4j,1579188029.0,"Or maybe they could actually parent the child? Therapy can help, but you aren’t just “dropping your kid” in counseling.

It’s up to the parent to know what that child needs and to work with the child to find better options. 

Just trying to scare the crap out of a child by smashing their games sounds a lot like emotional abuse. And it just leads to them hiding things, not admitting they have a problem and learning from it."
