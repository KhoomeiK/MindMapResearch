liberalgunowners,ff79kmm,t1_ff13nri,1579643921.0,"Consider that very few american liberals really know any muslims to begin with. If they do, they are probably converts. The point is that we don't really know anything about muslims other that what we read, whereas we generally are familiar with what conservative christians are all about because those are our families and neighbors we grew up with and it's a culture we understand. In the US at least, immigrants from muslim countries are skewed toward the better-educated and more americanized to begin with. I had a friend who told me about a Saudi guy he knew somehow who was visiting the US. This guy acted how a conservative male might typically act in a country like KSA and my friend said it was mortifying and he had to really reign the guy in to avoid making a scene."

edmproduction,fdns1sy,t3_elzb3k,1578591680.0,"It's a mixed bag of aspects that defines any one style or subgenre, but I think people tend to put too much emphasis on the kick patterns when it comes to classifying electronic music. This seems especially true when there are so many young people coming into the scene all the time. I have noticed that lots of younger folks tend to call all 140bpm non-4/4 music ""drum n bass"". Drum n bass isn't just ""all that is not trance or dubstep"", the definition is *in the freaking name.* Listen to the music, what is leading the composition? Is it detailed basslines and percussion taking center stage and the highs are basically fills? That's dnb. Is it a big singing chorus with a catchy lead melody and the bass and perc is doing standard rhythm section stuff? That's not dnb, thats breakbeat or big breaks. You have to look for what the key elements are that grab your focus in a way that wouldn't work unless it was intended to be that specific style of music. I think keeping mind of this will be useful as EDM continues to draw from an increasingly common set of go-to sounds and production trends."

Not sure if you meant 2-way coaxials or 2-way component sets... many coaxials sound alright on HU internal amps (even some stock HUs) but if its components you want an amp. If you want clarity you want an amp. SQ requires headroom, which requires power among other things."
CarAV,fdi8hmh,t3_ekyzvz,1578437629.0,"Factory speakers are usually really cheap speakers made to be as efficient as possible on the tiny amount of power factory HUs are able to give them. They don't get loud or clear, they just take that itty bitty power and make enough noise for your average casual listener. I imagine on external amp power they would sound shrill. You can upgrade the 3.5s to aftermarkets to match the other ones, try to smooth it out in whatever eq you have, or if you don't have many tweaking options sometimes you can tame the high end by reversing phase on the treble speakers only. Generally you don't need to worry about sensitivity ratings between comparable aftermarket speakers."

If you wanted to be nice to them you could even offer one day of babysitting and keep your plans for the other two. But by allowing them to open a negotiation of payment, it levels the playing field for them because now looks like your plans weren't significant and you would just as soon stay home and make money off of them.

Ok try it this way:

(some extreme salafist imam) insisted that his writings [were merel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/us/matt-shea-washington-extremism.html)y “a summary of church sermons on (7th century holy wars) that could help place current events in historical context.” And so, the (theocratic government of respective muslim country) did not call for (the extremist imam) to resign or expel him from its (madrasa that educates their society's children).

So, my prediction is that when some young christian male incel infatuated with this kind of religious ""morality"" murders his sibling for being gay-married, dudes like shea will denounce those actions (but not the teachings), send thoughts and prayers, and pretend they don't see the connection."

loseit,fbhbh2b,t3_edcwk7,1576869731.0,"Sounds all normal to me. You had stuff in your life, it went away, now you are filling the void with fitness-related stuff. Pretty much anyone with good advice will say this is the ideal way to go. I think you are probably just stoked on your progress and your hyper-focus on this is giving you a stingy mentality where every missed opportunity feels like the whole thing will fall apart. It also sounds like that's your only social network right now, so double jeopardy there.

I'd say focus more on enjoying it than analyzing it. Kickboxing fitness workouts are some of the BEST for total body fitness. Be careful you don't over-train and get hurt in the early stages. I see your talking about moving up to BJJ or muay thai- I would go for it man. I've been boxing for a few years and it's the best. These are scientific sports and learning them with other fighters opened a whole new aspect of my life and a mind-body connection that I never knew I could have. Plus you will meet some of the best people because learning real martial arts (i.e. full contact) requires humility, dedication, open-mindedness, character, valuing others, and a sense of joy in both learning and teaching."
