A partying 20 year old gets laid, a partying 40 year old just looks like a irresponsible unable to grow up moron. So to get the gyna when you get old you have to actually have a job, car, house, maturity then it's easy again."

I've had 3 1/2 minute song seems like 45 minutes long then when it was over felt like 2 seconds had passed. It makes time so fucky.

It may not be the hot chick every time especially when you drunk but a nut is a nut when you need one . I was in my teens and early 20s and getting laid was easy at parties as chicks just literally jump on you at times, not kidding. Getting old and can't party anymore so ya it's harder."

The only thing that kept the people who wanted total control at bay were those who wanted the freedom to choose their leaders. Freedom comes at the point of a gun not from asking. You think we havent had a world war because we grew as humans? Nope, it's because we have weapons that can wipe out an entire country in one shot and can destroy an economy in minutes."

gaming,ff88nkw,t1_ff80jwb,1579669214.0,Bf breakthrough you have no option but to camp you have a sector to defend and they attack . Your very limited in range and only certain spots are effective. BFV is about defending well fortified positions vs run and gun. So attackers got to break the defensive line with recons and tanks and planes to make a hole for the infantry to push in. It really plays out like real battles in breakthrough.
gaming,ff7x4vj,t1_ff7vrjn,1579660450.0,Yep..you should try BFV on the Pacific maps..it makes domination seem like kindergarten. I was big on call of duty Dom but breakthrough on battlefield v is a step above. It's basically one side caps 1 to 3 objectives each sector to advance across say 4 or 5 sectors and the other defends. So it's really fun to defend and get those choke point and flank kills and flank kills on attacking. 32v32 as well and you can get 100 plus minimum death games in tanks and planes.

So that 600$ a week went a long way as you didn't have the normal associated costs of living so you could get out and have fun on your money."
todayilearned,ff7wfz9,t1_ff7vrbj,1579659983.0,I'd say the actual hospital bill was insane. Ambulance rides in the states are outrageous. Better hope you never have to be airlifted. It's really a matter of the better your insurance is thru more they charge. It's how they bear the burden of those who don't pay and low pay insurance. It's why people against universal healthcare kill me as you are already incurring the cost of those who don't pay or have insurance every time you pay a bill so essentially you are already paying other people's way.

todayilearned,ff7ud5l,t1_ff7tddy,1579658578.0,"I was in the army in Virginia in 2005. I had a stomach virus that about killed me. I was so dehydrated I turned grey and I was incoherent. I had to go to an off post hospital as on post was more or less medical triage sick call stuff. I of course didn't have to pay the bill being in the army but I still got the charges etc in the mail. A 4 mile ambulance ride to the hospital in 2005 was over 4,000$. Thats not counting the 24 hour emergency room stay, which I didn't see and I'd say it was insane. 

That's enough to screw many people who live paycheck to paycheck financially. I had flat feet when I got out and it got me a disability rating and I got free healthcare for life thru the VA for it. It's not near as bad as most make out although appointment waits can be long. You can go walk in and see a doctor same day though if you want most days. Done it many times.  Also nowdays the VA if you have full medical thru getting disability or retirement will pay for civilian incurred costs or for a civilian doctor if you can't get into a VA appointment quickly. 

I don't know this man's situation. The VA will see any veteran disability or retired or not if you don't have insurance or low income etc most times it's free. However if you do have good income or insurance they will bill you and or them. It's only totally free with retirement, service incurred disability ratings, and low income etc. The VA gets a bad rap but it's not. I can't speak for every facility but ours does very good work here and takes very good care of many of our veterans."

Then he realized all the people that proclaimed to know everything and be wise really were stupid because they didn't accept that there's so much they don't know. Which led him to realize he really was the wisest man just because he realized how dumb he was. More or less they killed him for ""corrupting the youth"" as they say but really it's because he challenged the status quo of the powerful and the gods and religion."

It's more or less just prostitution except legal . Feed me and keep me up and I'll bang you and run around and spend all your money. 

Not all women are like that. Some are though and getting in their pants may be easy but getting them out of your house and life can prove to be a challenge. Specially when you get hooked on that pootang. They whip you into submission with that shit and turn you retarded.

I would spray liquid shit out cramping then the smell would make me have to puke and id not have time to flush and vomit on my own shit. I was so dehydrated I turned grey and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. 

At hospital they wouldn't give me anything to drink,.just ice chips and an IV. Well I can tell you an IV even though it hydrates you doesn't cure the craving for thirst if you were severly near death dehydrated . I have felt pain and misery before but never have I felt suffering like that thirst felt. I was like no wonder the stories of hell always include tormenting thirst. It's the worst craving you will ever have.

Guess what caused all that? Some guy who had the stomach flu and didnt wash his hands and I touched whatever he touched and ate his contaminated fecal matter . If he'd washed his hands I'd not almost died and suffered for days . So ya that's the day I became anti germ.

Seems high but realize 1 gram is 50 doses ffs. The 20mg dose is very small and you don't wanna eyeball it. I used to do 1/2 distilled water 1/2 vodka then dump say 500 mg into 100ml of that mix.

Especially given the guy you just killed and revived saw a kill cam highlighting your exact position. On breakthrough certain positions are key to holding so you gun down 4 guys and some medic comes and tosses smoke on them and revives them all then they all come to you immediately then you lose ground. 

I have no issue with revives. It's how long a death can be held off and how many times you can be revived rapidly as well as how a medic can revive people endless and fast with zero cool down. It can make tasks like capturing close quarters areas on breakthrough near impossible. Reviving two guys in smoke on an objective who held off death for a full minute can put 8 guys on the objective thru squad spawn in seconds."

Music is so good you can literally just like there for 5 hours the duration of the trip and just listen to music. It makes music unreal good .

Best thing is you do a normal sized dose and you can come in and out of it almost as you please. I could be tripping hard on it standing in front of my mom and shed never know. It's not intoxicating at all and you have all your sense about you. It's just tripping and joy and fun."

Has zero to do with obsession over karma. Karma is just necessary to make what you say seen so it can continue on. 

Also making memes etc makes people laugh. If that is toxic and cancerous to you then happiness evades you. There's nothing more enjoyable than making people laugh and upvotes and karma are the only way funny stuff can get beyond new to do so. So knowing when and how can make more stuff get to the top that deserves it vs endless reposts.

memes,fesevag,t1_fes8zro,1579364479.0,"Hitler never wanted to conquer or take over the Brits. He wanted them to submit to his whims. He wanted to bash them into an inability to do anything in resistance to him and hoped they would eventually come to their senses from his point of view and see the real enemy was the Soviets.  The british were Germanic in origin being descended from the Germanic Celts and Vikings.  He considered them equals.

He offered peace to them a number of times which thankfully was rejected by a defiant British people. He wanted them to accept his gains in return for peace and they denied it. Rudolph Hess parachuting into England with a peace agreement was claimed to have been on a solo mission but it's came out now he was directly doing so on Hitler's orders. 

Why do you think Hitler didn't wipe out the western army at Dunkirk? It wasn't some miracle. He gave a halt order. He thought they would leave with their tail between their legs and submit. They didn't. 

Me personally i think Hitler knew he needed the Soviet resources to keep his territorial gains and wasn't trying to prolong the war with the west and wanted it to end so he wasn't fighting on the two fronts that ended his Reich. 

Also trying to justify starving millions of people so your people don't starve is a bit sick..hey homeless guy my life is more important than yours because I say so so I'm gonna take your food so you and your family starve to death. Hitler was doomed the moment he invaded Russia. It was American support provided to the Soviets that enabled them to break the German army. It was American goods that helped the British resist the German terror campaign."

Why I'm so private about my personal life as I don't like people in my business. Being quite and listening you start to realize pretty soon many people who are extroverted are pretty horrid about talking about people. I don't say all mind you but a lot.

I will not ever talk about anyone who isn't present and won't talk to people who do at all anymore.
memes,fes93kj,t1_fermkcb,1579362742.0,"Also I've smoked heroin personally. I've used practically every single drug there is since I was 14. I quit everything around 7 years ago thankfully. I'm ridden with anxiety and an introvert and drugs was just self medicating myself so I could function daily like a normal person.  

I was never a heroin addict but did smoke it a number of times. I can tell you personally that you smoke heroin just one time and you will want it really really really bad. The addiction for people like me with anxiety, low energy, and introversion is immediate. It makes people like me feel how a normal person feels. That's because introversion and anxiety related to it is often because low dopamine levels in the brain naturally. Opiates flood the brain with dopamine and it makes people like me feel normal.

 Plus contrary to most believe heroin in low to moderate doses is a powerful stimulant. I could smoke it and just get everything done around the house and very happily too as you just feel top of the world while doing it. Ya opium isn't as potent as heroin but I assure you it's just as addictive and they knew it was addictive very early on as did the Chinese who had to resort to the death penalty during the communist period to get people off of it for good."

memes,fervm88,t1_fermkcb,1579358810.0,"Um that is complete fucking bullshit. Everyone knew it was a drug and a serious fucking problem.  China banned the drug from being sold because the addiction problem was so bad and that ban is what led the british to war with them over it. 

You seriously think that Britain pumping hundreds of tons of opium annually into a country and almost it's entire population smoking that the country that was the victim weren't fucking aware that it was addictive or a problem? Bullshit"
memes,ferv3vm,t1_ferkhr4,1579358610.0,"Um WTF are you talking a out. The british literally declared war twice on China over the opium trade. Weird, there are two wars called the opium wars. Also it is very well documented that British policy led to multiple famines in India that killed up to 1/3 of the population."
BattlefieldV,feqf0dw,t3_eq9s0f,1579341124.0,"Moutain is easy to take if you do it right. If their pilots suck park a tank on the right side of the mountain and kill people off the sand bag wall watching the front. If they can't watch that front they fall pretty fast. Use the call in tank if necessary. Always get more kills with it than a bomb call in. You can sit way back with that tank and keep them from defending the front. 

Also set up a bomber with a high altitude prop and fire bombs and flares. Fly over the objective at Max altitude and pop flares. Turn in and dive and drop the firebombs on the mass of guys up top. I often get 10 guys in a pass. Reason fire bombs as it keeps them from reviving those who die and getting back in that area to defend for quite a bit. High altitude prop let's you avoid their planes and AA."
BattlefieldV,feqefqf,t3_eq41t4,1579340866.0,Get on the Pacific maps. Run an LVT for a while. Level it up and set it up as an AA tank with increased rate of fire. Infantry kills galore.
BattlefieldV,feqe611,t3_eq8x38,1579340758.0,You really need a guy in chat with you to be your wing man. It can be hard to shake a good pilot. I've learned over the last month flying in the Pacific maps. The stall is most common but will get you killed if they are good as you just a stationary target then.  I like to get medium high and turn my nose down hard and to the left and make extremely sharp turns in a corkscrew manner alternating my speed. Also if you keep your wingtip nearly touching the ground in tight circles going slow they can't hardly ever get a bead on you to hit you as their wing will hit the ground if they do.

BattlefieldV,feqd5lr,t1_feq6s4i,1579340335.0,I agree. I just been playing Pacific maps and running tanks and planes and when not that a Madsen LmG or a SLR or Anti Tank sniper. No time to kill issues with any of those. Need up close work switch to a tench carbine on recon and it works wonders.
BattlefieldV,feqcxkx,t1_feo67oc,1579340241.0,Firestorm is what fucked this game. They expected it to be big given the popularity of that game type at the time but those type games were already dying by the time it came out.
BattlefieldV,feqcj8k,t1_fenkf8a,1579340157.0,If your team actually held the tunnels off the front one could be useful. I've been killed by a guy trying to flank behind B on breakthrough before A is took many times. It's basically just for shooting any infantry running up the road. Unfortunately your team don't hold the tunnel very long and they just get behind you and kill you off.
BattlefieldV,feqbxll,t1_feooa86,1579339977.0,Zh29 is a two hit kill at any range more or less and has a 6 round box mag. Barely anyone uses it and it murders. The SLR snipers are so under utilized in this game it's a shame. Mixed with the beacon and a revolver you can get some nasty kill streaks.

Has been for me any way. I'm not into younger chicks as I almost got my kids raised and am not gonna do it again as it's tough and costly. However that's more or less what they are drawn to older men for I believe. Just more secure in their life with stuff and a home and car and not as immature.
