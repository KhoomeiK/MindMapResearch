antiwork,fej4nnp,t3_ep0duw,1579156757.0,"I also have been experiencing worse than normal mental health. My main boss was receptive and supportive, however most of my direct supervisors basically said ""tough shit get used to it"". 



I took entire weeks off work, constantly having panic attacks both at work and home. My boss tried his best to accommodate my problems, he really did, but the attitudes of my other supervisors and the customers (call center for a bank) just kept wearing me down and I finally left for good yesterday. It's a shame,  I never got to say goodbye to my boss, the best boss I've had to date. I enjoyed the job but my customers calling me ret***ed and giving me death threats broke me."
YouShouldKnow,fecum2e,t1_fecto7w,1578985249.0,"Right, we've been discussing it some. We only made the decision that I'd take care of my brother a few weeks ago, but its always been established that my older brother would be taking my sister. 



From what we've gathered so far, in the event both me and my older brother can't, my sister is going with our neighbor, who we've known since I was in kindergarten, that she already spends a lot of time with (they have a daughter her age). As it stands, my brother would go with his paternal grandma (he's adopted, in reality he's my second cousin but he's been with us since the day he was born and we're still fighting his biological dad, that's in prison right now, for custody), however if she can't then he'd go to live with my uncle (his biological grandpa, who already has custody of his brother) since both of his biological parents are in prison for quite awhile (they sell meth). Nothing quite finalized yet in that regard, but as it stands that's the current plan. 



Failing that, they both go to my mom's best friend. *That's* definitely set in stone, has been since my sister was born. If no one else can care for them, she agreed to take both in."
