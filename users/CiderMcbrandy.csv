A planet full of delegates and senate? Doesn't that sound fun for a children's show! Going to Gallifrey is always a bad idea, let it be remembered as 9 and 10 did.

I loved how Time Lords were used in War Games and Genesis of Daleks, they tell the Doc what is going to happen, they are in control. The Doctor is a rogue, and should be treated like one. Once Doc starts becoming Lord President and Gallifrey celebrates all 12 coming to the rescue... its a bit much. 

I am a helf scratching my head why the Rani, or Gaiman's Corsair haven't appeared. New or returning Rogue Timelords are the answer. Give the poor overworked Master a break."
