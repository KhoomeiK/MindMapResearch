depression,ffcvu4e,t3_esqc7z,1579808324.0,"I am not exactly like that no. What I find is that when I am particularly depressed I avoid conversations at all costs and if I unavoidably get into one I am rude in making my excuses and get out of it. Having depression ruins one's life, but I guess you experience that. It's no consolation but you are not on your own."
depression,fezzgwa,t3_eqs4h8,1579463543.0,"I can relate entirely to what you have written. I have had various degrees of depression for in excess of 40 years. All I can say for myself is this. I have tried so much medication (still taking loads) all so many psychiatrists it is unreal, but nothing has worked. I am always depressed but do have better days than others. First I have accepted who I am and that it is not my fault. People who don't accept who I am can sod off. Then on my better days I try to do something when I am having a better day and that gives me some satisfaction. We are born with depression, people generally don't understand but the people writing on this forum do. We have to just do our best and support and congratulate each other in forums such as this. So sod their silly comments we understand mate. Bless you."
depression,fen72rt,t3_epydpj,1579278402.0,I don't know what country you are from but here is the UK we have gone through the protracted battle of Brexit and believing so deeply in the remain argument the frustration and disappointment has done me no good. I can totally understand where you are coming from. People like us have no control anyway what ever system you live in and we are only kidding ourselves to think that we do. So good on you. Give it up. And when you feel well enough to give it attention again you will find that for you little has changed! There might be a different government but for you little will have changed.
depression,fekkrmi,t1_fekk5u3,1579202099.0,You are right. The problem is I often volunteer for things stupidly just to try and 'keep in' with people. Then I find I can't do the task either quick enough or well enough. I know I have to have a word with myself!
depression,fekj7vs,t3_epe2m7,1579201176.0,Yes I can relate totally. Everything is an enormous effort and I am always falling below people's expectations because of the things I have not managed to do. I have been building a workshop for three years now and that has become a running joke amongst the people I know. They don't appreciate that having stuck at it for three years has taken an enormous amount of effort. And like you I am surrounded by people but have no support. I have been depressed so long I have no real friends as nobody wants to be friends with an old depressive. I do try my best to be positive but it is a huge effort.
depression,fe5qz2d,t3_eno7v3,1578873289.0,"Jesus himself said 'in this life you will have troubles'. St Paul admitted to having a 'thorn in his side' that he had prayed would go away but it had not done so. There are Christians such as myself who have prayed and prayed for their depression to leave them but I can tell you it has not done so. I have realised that my illness is something I am going to have to live with as a Christian.  And so I want to say explore Christianity by all means, I wish you would. Don't let well meaning but ignorant people put you off."
depression,fdlnao3,t1_fdjqyzi,1578527903.0,I completely understand what you are saying everything I see with myself including your last comments. No choice really but to carry on.
depression,fdf4135,t3_ekxc8k,1578352805.0,"I know I have been in that place. I am suffering from depression but not at that very low point at the moment. I just want to reach out and say I understand. My experience is that time does change how we feel but, when we are in those deep troughs we don't or can't believe it and we panic like hell which makes it all worse. Try to hold on to whatever hope you can muster."
depression,fdeql95,t3_ekwbox,1578344549.0,"Yes I have been depressed to varying degrees for over 40 years. I have visited a number of psychiatrists and taken all the medications for depression. Nothing works. There can be something actually positive and liberating in concluding that you are unlikely to ever be fully well. I am resolved to use the time that I am not feeling so bad more positively. That is not to say my life is not pretty shitty,

 it is. And I am a pain to myself and those close to me, but I do get some things done just to keep my head above water. I have concluded that this is the best I am likely to achieve."
depression,fd0ruck,t3_ejamne,1578122906.0,Yes I can relate to that. Years ago I could cry but now I cannot. I have to say however that when I did cry the release was short lived. Even so it is strange that the ability to cry does go over time and a kind of numbness sets in.
depression,fc9x0vf,t1_fc9e26q,1577559454.0,"You miss the point. A depressed person would dearly love to be working those long hours and gaining worldly success but they can't because they are depressed. There is an implication in what you write that the depressed person has a choice but they do not. Like you can't climb a hill with a half tom lead weight on your back though you would dearly love to do so, so you struggle to achieve in life with the weight of depression."
depression,fc2nqya,t1_fc1jkvd,1577368422.0,"Yes you will improve over time stick at it. I speak as someone who has been there and still returns there from time to time. Push yourself but don't expect too much. A shower and a walk are a great start. Try passing the time of day with people and even reading the paper, anything that get's you interacting with the outside world. God bless your efforts."
depression,fbb3n82,t1_fbamyhy,1576692617.0,"You say your ""parents deserve a better child"". I read what you have written totally understanding what you are saying given that I have suffered depression for many years. However when I got to ""parents deserve a better child"", I had to reply to you. As a parent of young adults one still at university, I will bet that your parents love you dearly and unconditionally. The question of what they deserve will never arise in their minds, they have you and will love you whatever your view of yourself. Just do what you can at University, you can have no idea of what opportunities my open up to you although I do understand that you do feel as you do. Depression distorts reality. I understand that your country is not always as you would wish it to be, neither is mine (UK) but it will climb out of it's current phase and good men and women will win in the end. For now just do sufficient to hang on in with your studies. Don't expect too much of yourself."
