edmproduction,fef6adu,t3_eoubci,1579049191.0,"Not sure how you captured it, but most people commonly feed the main out, directly from the sound console used for the show, to a daw to record. This process has been much easier after digitalisation of these consoles.

Now if you recorded the whole show with mics, it is kinda difficult to remove those. You could make it more cleaner than what you have now, but it might not be what you were expecting."

FL_Studio,fddz9gu,t3_ekvmwq,1578327569.0,"Ensure the samples are on the same track grid and no other samples are in it. Then use ""Consolidate and replace"", by click right clicking (in pc, not sure about Mac) on the respective Track indicator on the left hand border of the playlist. Looping the according to the desired time period is good idea. 

The samples or midi, will be rendered, placed on a new track under original track and original track is grouped to this new track, with the original clips muted.

It is only in FL studio 20 and above, if I'm right.

Edit: I feel like I made it unnecessarily complex,.so here's a simple tutorial on YouTube.
