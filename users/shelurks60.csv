JUSTNOMIL,fc3u0y7,t3_efvm8n,1577398610.0,"I'm so sorry.  I do find myself wondering, if you never wanted to be a mother, and are not happy you are pregnant, what caused you to proceed with the pregnancy?  It just amazes me how many people find themselves reluctant parents and basically suffer through the early years and are unhappy thereafter about parenthood.  I just don't understand."
