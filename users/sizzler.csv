YouShouldKnow,fddvo3b,t1_fdcrpba,1578325112.0," I'm gonna pick and choose elements from different sites.  Remember I'm proving mental and physical health not necessarily longevity. **Animals in a Zoo live longer lives, doesn't mean they are happy.** 

So pulling from [https://catvills.com/indoor-cats-vs-outdoor-cats/](https://catvills.com/indoor-cats-vs-outdoor-cats/)

 **Separation Anxiety**– Many times, indoor cats form a bond  and become dependent on their owners. This means that when you are away  from the home, your cat can develop separation anxiety.

**Exercise Needs**– Keeping your indoor cat mentally and  physically stimulated is important. Since indoor cats don’t get the same exercise that outdoor cats do, they can sometimes get a bit lazy. 

Two straight forward examples of mental and physical detriments that indoor cats have. 

Now in researching I found this

[https://www.petful.com/pet-health/veterinarian-outdoor-cats/](https://www.petful.com/pet-health/veterinarian-outdoor-cats/)

> I live in the United Kingdom, where [90% of our cats go outside](https://icatcare.org/advice/outdoor-cats/) unsupervised, meaning only 10% are exclusively indoor pets. 

This is where I'm based so you can see my bias. It's wierd to keep cats inside in our country. 

 

>The answer lies in the U.K. attitude of simply allowing cats to be cats.  
>  
>By  giving cats free access to the outdoors, they are able to express  natural behaviors. They can climb, claw, pounce, swipe, pad or gallop as  the mood takes them.  
>  
>In short, [they exercise](https://www.petful.com/pet-health/ways-to-exercise-a-cat/) both their mind and body as nature intended.

Mental Health issues of indoor cats

> Most important, indoor cats are more likely to express their frustration in behavioral problems, such as clawing, fighting or [inappropriate urination](https://www.petful.com/behaviors/cat-spraying/), which could lead to them being rehomed or euthanized. 

And finally

 

>Do Indoor Cats Really Live Longer Than Outdoor Cats?  
>  
>One of the facts often quoted in favor of indoor cats is they live longer than outdoor cats.  
>  
>But  this argument is flawed because once young cats who die in traffic  accidents are taken out of the equation, the statistics level out.  
>  
>Indeed, outdoor cats who live beyond 1 year have a life expectancy into the high teens — just like indoor cats.
