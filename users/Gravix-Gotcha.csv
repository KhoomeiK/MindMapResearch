The one time I was going to try it in my young 20's, the guy giving it to me went on and on about not being negative before taking it or you could have a bad trip. He went on and on giving pointers about how to prepare. The amount of sentences that ended in ""... or you'll have a bad trip."" convinced me to give it back to him and say ""no thanks."" I'm a pretty pessimistic, melancholic person, telling me to not feel negative is like saying don't breathe.

I also heard that just one hit of acid can have lasting effects like seeing tracers. I've seen tracers while high on weed and that's pretty cool, but I couldn't imagine that just being life from now on.

woweconomy,fdvdyzr,t3_emxd6j,1578746391.0,"Imo, at this point in the game, there's just so many items that it gets overwhelming when trying to figure out how to organize everything and post auctions. 

I run a ton of old content just for fun, not farming anything just goofing off. From quests to dungeons and raids to gathering. I don't really go out of my way to farm, but if there's an herb or ore nearby, I'll take it.

Later when I hit the AH with my eclectic bag of goods, I just want to be able to hit a button and post everything I've picked up. But the base operation that is built into TSM is quite bad at this. The old TSM would post most of my stuff ok and then I could shift click the left over items and manually check how and if I wanted to post it or vendor it. 

Most of the time the base operation won't post anything these days. I want to tell it, as long as it's above vendor, let it go. Greens, blues, herbs, ore, everything. And just post all the herbs/ore I have in one stack. It's probably only 5 or 10 of something and I don't want anything left in my bag. If it doesn't sell the first time, I'll vendor it. 

So then I find myself trying to make a group and operation for every little thing I have. I'll import lists from various players from the TSM website and then add my own simple operations to them. I don't go nuts. If it's a resource like herbs and ore, I use a % of market price (eg. 50% dbmarket) and if it's gear, I just use region... because I may not be a top tier goblin but I know random greens don't sell for gold cap. 

And then there's all the miscellaneous stuff that I put in a group called ""Junk Drawer"" that I try to figure out if it's worth selling. What's it used for? Is it relevant? 

Then there's the whole posting fee sticker shock that sprang up out of nowhere. If you don't watch your auctions carefully, you'll be paying more in fees than you can hope to make back. It's nuts. 

The AH overhaul is definitely going to be a welcome change for me."

The only other person I know that's left handed is a person in my guild and he said he's left handed and uses his left. I've never *seen* him so I have to take his word that he's even left handed. Maybe I should have said I've never *heard* of a left hander who uses his right. 

The only other person I've known that was left handed, personally, in my life was my uncle and he didn't even own a computer so who's to say what he would have done.

hardware,fd8quj6,t1_fd86kdw,1578222048.0,"Wow, seems like I hit a nerve with this post. 

I guess you missed the operative words in my post and those being ""odds are."" Meaning most likely, more often than not, probably etc., the hand you are dominant with, is the hand you will use a mouse with. The only thing I stated with certainty is that if you are proficient with both, you are ambidextrous. If you don't agree, don't take it up with me, take it up with Webster. 

In my 46 years, I have *never* seen a person use the mouse with their non-dominant hand, even lefties. And that is a huge sample size. No, it isn't big compared to a national or global scale or an historic scale, but given that fact I've seen thousands of people using a mouse in my life, and I'm talking about just the ones that I knew for a fact which was their dominant hand, it would be hard to make a case that I'm wrong in saying *odds are* people use the mouse with their dominant hand. Their are always outliers and ofc, those are the ones that sound off the most when a statement like that is made.

Not everyone becomes proficient just because they use their non-dominant hand. In 3rd grade when we started learning cursive writing, the teacher repeatedly tried to get me to use my right hand to write with. She said it was impossible for me to get the letters to lean the way they were supposed to using my left hand. I couldn't even make legible letters with my right hand. Back then you were graded on hand writing just like arithmetic and English. She gave me D's and F's the whole year because I used my left hand and my hand writing was fantastic, it just leaned the wrong way. 

For the last 10 years at work, I've had to enter information into a computer on a production floor that has the mouse hard mounted on the right hand side so no one can move/take it. I haven't gotten *any* more proficient with my right hand and people often comment on how slow I am and that I should embrace technology blah, blah, blah, as if I've never seen a computer. They don't believe me when I tell them I'm a gamer and that building computers is as easy as playing with Legos and that I would zip through my tickets if I could move the damn mouse. 

I am left handed. I eat left, write left, brush my teeth left, use a left handed fishing reel, I absolutely can't reel with my right hand and the people I fish with don't know how I do it with my left. Everything I do where you can ""choose"" the hand to complete the task with, I do it left handed.

When I was 16 and buying my first computer, a 386 SX, they had one setup in the store running the golf game, Links for demo purposes. I sat down and the mouse was on the right. I proceeded to swing the mouse around because having it on the right didn't make sense at all to me. It was no different than sitting down at a desk in school and the armrest being on the right. It didn't make sense. 

I can't even stand playing first person shooters because it literally feels weird and immersion breaking to see the gun on my right side and pulling it up to the right side of my screen. 

You think people aren't hard coded to be one or the other, but if that was the case, there wouldn't be such a thing as dominant and non-dominant hands. Everyone would just be ambidextrous. And if you can arbitrarily use whichever hand you want, why does most of the world choose right? Like I said, in 46 years I've never seen anyone use their non-dominant hand for dominant hand tasks such as writing and eating. And in 46 years I know for a fact that I know my body better than you or anyone else. Hell even at 7 I knew my body better than anyone else. I'm looking at you, Mrs. Hyder.

At the end of the day, I'm left handed. I use a mouse with the hand that feels right to me and that's my left hand. It's as simple as that. This whole post has devolved into me defending the fact that I use the mouse with my left hand because I'm left dominant. I never had any idea that the whole world was full of people like my 3rd grade teacher who try to force you to do something that doesn't feel natural. It's nuts."

My first computer was a 386 SX with 2MB RAM and a 106MB HDD. It ran DOS 5.0. Games back then were turned based and you could use the number pad to move all 4 cardinal directions and diagonal. My brother who was right handed used to complain how he had to take his hand off the mouse constantly to move his characters in Pools of Radiance and tried in vain to just use the mouse with his left hand.

NoStupidQuestions,fcq9zcz,t1_fcpw2ba,1577881857.0,"I guess I'd be a little hurt if someone close to me didn't remember to wish me happy birthday, but I do know people have a lot going on in their lives. I definitely believe being a new mom is more than enough reason to forget a birthday. Sometimes I have no clue what day it is so I totally understand when someone wishes me a belated birthday. I was just thinking more about OP that I never had the desire to celebrate my birthday, even when I was a teen. These days, my wife and I will go out to eat when it's one of our birthdays, but we never tell them it's our birthday. That would be a nightmare scenario for me. All those people clapping and singing. 

On the subject of flat nipples (since that's important lol) when my first daughter was born, I remember her mom having a really hard time getting her to latch after they brought her in. Finally a nurse came in to ""help"" her and I just remember her grabbing my daughter's mother's nipple area and pinching and pulling like she wanted to tear it off. My ex was crying out in pain and I got angry and told the lady to take it easy, there's no reason to be so mean about it, and she just told us both, if you think your nipples hurt now, just wait. Very crude woman, but she was right. I never had any idea how bad a woman's nipples start hurting after breastfeeding for a while. It makes sense, but I never put two and two together when thinking about it. I'm not sure if it's because of flat nipples or what, but I just know she was in pain every time she fed our daughter. As a man, you never feel more useless than watching the person you love in agony and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. It all started in the delivery room and lasted months into breastfeeding. I made sure to change every diaper and bathe her, take care of the laundry, basically anything that I could do, but I still felt useless."
NoStupidQuestions,fcpcwkh,t3_eicnch,1577858700.0,"One of the good things about being introverted. I hated people making a big deal about my birthday. I hate being the center of attention. These days, I just want people to say ""Happy Birthday"" as nonchalantly as you'd say ""good morning"" and move on. It's not that important."

AskReddit,fcjtkct,t1_fcjbh0i,1577704013.0,Well birth control won't get rid of the fetus. That's abortion. Birth control stops the egg from dropping so it doesn't get fertilized to create the fetus in the first place. But I'm sure the 15k people (as of this post) knew that.

I have all my steam games on another drive and I just go to ninite to quickly reinstall most of my go to software that I keep on my boot drive.

funny,fbwnnf7,t1_fbv486r,1577154663.0,"It's more about the tradition than the religion at this point. Things change over time. 

Look at Halloween. It *was* started by Christians to remember the dead but now many Christians see it as the Devil's holiday and forbid their kids to have fun. Kids dress as monsters and get candy. Not how it went when it started.

I know you probably thought it was only Christians that celebrate Christmas, but *a lot* of non-Christians celebrate the tradition of Christmas."
