I tried Transcendental Meditation but idk I just feel like I'm wasting my time tbh"
socialanxiety,ffb5f3u,t3_eslihz,1579752268.0,"Key word is ""self-conscious"", I hope my other post helped you.

Also check this one, it's a more detailed version. [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/eqznjv/it\_was\_the\_conscious\_monkey\_mind\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/eqznjv/it_was_the_conscious_monkey_mind_all/)  

I tried CBD, beta-blockers, psychiatrist meds, therapy, magnesium supplements, you name it I tried it...this unconscious mind-state is the first thing that worked for me in 8 years of S.A, it just frees you from all the anxious thoughts :DDD"

socialanxiety,ff01mdl,t1_fezvlob,1579464212.0,"Not completely tell it to ""SHUT UP"" or ""TURN OFF"" but for exemple, while playing a game or doing something you regularly do, you don't hear those ""little voices"" telling you what to do, you just go with the flow, that's the point of the whole thread tbh.

But I gotta agree that meditation has a huge impact on the activity in both the pre-frontal cortex and the amygdala."
