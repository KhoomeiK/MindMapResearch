The husband here is presented as completely oblivious and there is no acknowledgement from him after, so no suggestion that things will get better.

It's a common theme from women comedians from this era, that kind of joke about how terrible women have it but with a resignation to their fate. 

Current women comedians are more likely to be expecting better or even, shockingly, *demanding* better."
