The local kiowa tribe built a nice house for this homeless couple really nice house had to have had a 6 digit budget. Well a year passes and they burned it down for the insurance money which they promptly spent on alcohol and drugs. Some people just straight dont want to work for things and expect to get by on the generosity of others. So it begs the question how does one spot the difference between someone that truly tries and are just down on their luck from the ones that just merely dont want to support themselves.

I wish the other nations of asia would start a coalition on the bases mutual self interest alone they can do nothing but together they stand a chance of pushing china back to their un designated area hell they wouldnt even need to have the better navy to do it because if they got pissed enough to all start retaliating against china the international community is going to have to do something about china because continuing to ignore their military aggression would only help facilitate a new world war down the road which is all the more obvious when they're repeated attacks against their neighbors start embroiling the continen into a state of war to defend themselves from chinese aggression.

politics,fdnu3af,t1_fdnrw41,1578592854.0,"Exodus 22 gives some clues about God’s attitude toward self-defense: “If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed” (Exodus 22:2–3). Two basic principles taught in this text are the right to own private property and the right to defend that property. The full exercise of the right to self-defense, however, depended on the situation. No one should be too quick to use deadly force against another, even someone who means to do him harm. If someone was set upon by a thief in the middle of the night and, in the confusion of the moment the would-be thief was killed, the Law did not charge the homeowner with murder. But, if the thief was caught in the house during the day, when the homeowner was unlikely to be awoken from sleep, then the Law forbade the killing of the thief. Essentially, the Law said that homeowners shouldn’t be quick to kill or attack thieves in their home. Both situations could be considered self-defense, but deadly force was expected to be a last resort, used only in the event of a panicked “surprise attack” scenario where the homeowner is likely to be confused and disoriented. In the case of a nighttime attack, the Law granted the homeowner the benefit of the doubt that, apart from the darkness and confusion of the attack, he would not intentionally use lethal force against a thief. Even in the case of self-defense against a thief, a godly person was expected to try to restrain the assailant rather than immediately resort to killing him."
