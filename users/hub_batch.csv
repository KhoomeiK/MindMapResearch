asktransgender,fewpgom,t1_fev2uy1,1579417533.0,"Tbh, I think it stems a lot from the self deprication trend that is big right now. ""If I have to suffer, I want to make sure everyone else suffers with me but I also want their approval so I'll tell a self depricating joke"". So they make jokes that are negative in general, both about themselves and anyone who has a shared experience with them. its fucked up and sad."

AskReddit,fek7w1f,t3_epj100,1579194452.0,This cool indie-horror trilogy called FAITH. One of the coolest games I played this last year.
quityourbullshit,feh9mpg,t3_ep2yme,1579112020.0,Oh my god. As a queer person I am so fucking enraged by this tweet. I can't even begin to tell you how upset this made me. What the fuck.

pokemongo,fdcy8bj,t1_fdckcg1,1578287857.0,"both pages are tbh, this one is either a nice sweet story about pogo or very toxic bitching about the game"
bulletjournal,fcwtvsf,t1_fcw1h73,1578037416.0,"Not OP, but it's literally one of the worst pieces of literature I've ever read. Do not waste your time with it. It's a terrible manuscript and its clear that Harper Lee was being taken advantage of before she passed away by her publisher."
bulletjournal,fcwts87,t3_ej451c,1578037301.0,"I'm sorry you had to suffer through the travesty that is Go Set a Watchman. 

Congrats on all the books! :)"
CPTSD,fcwcxd9,t1_fcw8rgx,1578022507.0,i really want to believe it does. i feel like i cant stay in therapy/out of the bad shit long enough to feel any benefits. im back and forth between the enviroment that made me this way and being out of it. its hectic
CPTSD,fcvqcmg,t1_fcpgcae,1578007718.0,i dont think i find it confronting- the app makes it easy to mark moods and not make me go into the nitty gritty about it ans therefore spiral out of control. but im thinking i maybe do need a change. not sure yet.
CPTSD,fcvq81t,t1_fcp8lto,1578007637.0,"It wasn't really a full year, i lost track of it as soon as i went back to school (i tend to feel more well and go ""oh i dont need to do this im fine"" and i am def not fine), but thank you i rlly appreciate that"
bujo,fcvq3ch,t1_fctah9x,1578007552.0,"This is such a thoughtful, well thought out answer. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this out. 

I've tried a lot of what you refer to- using it for accountability, goals...But since I'm struggling with PTSD, I find that I do need to track ""everyday routine"" things sometimes. I forget when I last showered, brushed my teeth, etc. I think I've found a middle ground- I track it on my phone and add it to my bujo later. I'll try to take what you've said here to heart, though- maybe I need to reincorporate the reflection/goal setting aspect. Thank you!"
bujo,fct2osb,t3_eimmv9,1577931310.0,"I do the same tracker but I just, never feel inclined to fill it in. I've had some months where I do but I just forget. What motivates you to come back to it?"

-a credit score
-money for a deposit
-the emotional ability to leave

seriously just because its legal doesnt mean its possible."

insaneparents,fc6xkja,t1_fc6wb6m,1577492082.0,"No, the bible isnt inherently ""anti-gay"". There are plenty of interpretations, translations, and theories about what the Bible has tried to teach us, and some people like to think that's against being gay."
college,fc5p14k,t1_fc5okfo,1577462945.0,Plenty at BGSU as well.
dataisbeautiful,fc4kop4,t3_efxwxd,1577419490.0,"Would you reccomend this tracker? I use Dailyo and I like it, but I'm interested in others to help keep track of this sort of thing. Dailyo is very no-nonsense, just track your mood + activites. This seems a lot more in depth?"

I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but as a Comp Sci major, it fucking *sucks* to get locked out of classes that I would do well in because I'm stuck in a remedial math class- or said remedial math class didn't prepare me for precalculus. Ugh."

AnimalCrossing,fc1g2tm,t1_fc1d60n,1577317702.0,"Hmm...That's hard to say. If not Isabelle (I think she's very fleshed out), K.K Slider has a lot of cool trivia that I like (like his JPN name being a play on words for Totaka's name, the composer of the series), so possibly him. Admittedly though, I havent seen enough of him. I know he was way more prevalent in the N64/GC titles!"
AnimalCrossing,fc1803r,t1_fc15vwr,1577310867.0,Isabelle is just more relatable. Shes got way more of a character than Nook and K.K do.
Wellthatsucks,fc0482z,t3_efc7mp,1577277792.0,"Hey, I work at a Walmart. I know how it is. You're a real fuckin good man for doing this. I don't have any money right now, but I saved that charity. I just had a friend of mine get diagnosed with bipolar 2 after a suicide attempt. Helping in this way is a good idea.

Merry Christmas, my friend."
CPTSD,fbyymzw,t3_ef10oq,1577229925.0,"i bullet journal, its not some like cure all for everything im dealing with but its definitely become my calm in the storm sometimes. its nice to have something thats concretely yours to come back to, to say ""i made this, this is a catalog of my life"" its very nice."
