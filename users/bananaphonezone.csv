progresspics,fd4yqtc,t1_fd4xkjn,1578172481.0,I hear you. But celebrating yourself and being proud of yourself is different than arrogant. I sense that you’re a long way away from arrogant asshole! :)
progresspics,fd4x25s,t1_fd465fv,1578171894.0,"The security blanket of negativity is such a good way to put it. I totally get that way too. But in the end it serves no one. You deserve to be proud of yourself, every small step along your journey (and this step your showing is was a BIG one!) In 2020, let’s set an intention to not dim our light anymore and to SHINE 💖"

Hmm, maybe in 2020 I will try to pay better attention to the good I'm doing even when life sucks.."

CPTSD,fcp7blu,t3_eibv1l,1577852873.0,"I'm so sorry :( Sending love to you on this night. I know it feels really bad rn, but this feeling and moment will pass. Are there any small doable nice things you can do for yourself?"

CPTSD,fcp6rs3,t3_ei2u7r,1577852341.0,"Are you me??? I do this constantly!!! I've never heard anyone else articulate what I do. Something I'm constantly doing is placing a mug on the couch next to me full of coffee or eating messy food in bed and it crosses my mind it will end badly... and then of course it does! The coffee spills, the food crumbles into my sheets, and so on and so forth... getting water all over my papers and books is a constant thing that is most of the time preceded by a thought that whatever precarious thing I'm about to do may end badly..."
CPTSD,fcp6igf,t3_eiabt0,1577852091.0,"I really do. I find it very hard to differentiate in the moment between self care and unhealthy avoidance, I think I straight up lie to myself and I want the out so I don't have to get up and do life...

Edit-  but I'm also genuinely very tired and think I need lots of rest.. so yeah idk"
CPTSD,fcp6g9d,t1_fcp5mof,1577852030.0,Oh I love the idea of your bear Rock <3
CPTSD,fcp6crd,t3_ei5lpp,1577851934.0,"Yup! It's funny I suppose because I actually made an effort to be social and have a low key NYE with someone and she got sick so I had to come home. It's not yet 12 here (US EST) so eating takeout, chilling with the cats, redditing, going to watch tv... A part of me feels like it's a sad end to a very sad year... but also actively trying to reframe it and that it's okay even nice to hang out with myself and chill??"
CPTSD,fcp64px,t1_fcov8yw,1577851721.0,Yo! I somehow instantly became nocturnal as soon as my break from work started! It's like it knew that night is the time to avoid family... Also hoping the insomnia ends soon

CPTSD,fc74u4s,t3_egaara,1577497564.0,"I don’t want to hear these “empowering” messages until someone first acknowledges that what I experienced was NOT fair, that the ramifications of how my parents failed me still affect me today and that’s NOT my fault, and it’s triple unjust that then me being better is a shit ton more work and that I now have to do the job my parents were supposed to do, heal from the harm they actively caused, AND deal with normal adult stuff other adults deal with! AND you better acknowledge that the trauma also causes chronic exhaustion and illness that makes just getting out of bed hard let alone all that other stuff!!! Like I don’t want to hear all the crap I’m ‘supposed’ to do if they don’t GET it through and through. And often when people put out these not nuanced messages it shows me they really don’t get it at all..."
CPTSD,fc74afu,t1_fc5li4c,1577497149.0,If a therapist told me everything happens for a reason.. just hell no. I don’t know how you can work with people who have experienced truly horrific injustice for NO reason if you think that. Idk that made me so angry :(
CPTSD,fc73xm8,t1_fc5bbqe,1577496883.0,Oh my god.. thank you for saying this!! I have had the same fantasies my whole life!! And feel so ashamed of it. But I as a kid and even now would fantasize a car would hit me and I wouldn’t be paralyzed but I’d have to be in the hospital and cared for by others and doing physical therapy a long time with a kindly PT and that there would be this outpouring of sympathy for me.. it’s embarrassing to write but thank you for helping me feel a little less crazy..

CPTSD,fc4wkyv,t3_ef8td5,1577431437.0,"Definitely relating to quite a bit of your cptsd posts..including the feeling of being deprived of hobbies in comparison to other kids and wanting exes to teach you. I feel that hard..

I hope that we can figure something out on our journeys forward in life! Perhaps this coming year is the year to have a hobby? It sounds like you have some amazing ideas already!"
CPTSD,fc4ulsk,t3_eg3pws,1577429041.0,"Your title hit me hard.. I didn’t have the normal socialization either or any adults who cared.. also didn’t have tv, so just a completely unhuman human.. I also say my past is just a black hole, a void of nothingness

Edit - just reread the parts about your ex and I’m tearing up thinking of my exes.. the few fleeting moments of joy and connection and wanting so bad to be taught to be cared for and saved..and then having a whole life and world for them when it was over and me alone, just like you said.. :( I wish there was a way we lost souls could help each other.."

CPTSD,fc26tpa,t3_efo13w,1577343066.0,"Wow he handled this so so terribly... I know this doesn’t always help in the moment to hear- I know from being on the receiving end- but it does seem like in the long run you dodged a bullet with this guy. The way he handled himself during this breakup illuminates some less than stellar qualities...

I’m sorry this is so hard. It’s a lot to have to deal with all the emotional experiences you’re having now and also the logistics of it all. It might be really hard for a while.. but you’ll survive it. I hope you can be gentle with yourself and kind to yourself through this process of transition and grieving the relationship. <3"

CPTSD,fc1vwfi,t1_fc1v3wq,1577331354.0,"Honestly given how much you have had to endure both as a child and as an adult, you’re retirement is well deserved. And I’m all here for utilizing the resources of well funded institutions to make the lives of people who have been hurt a little bit better. I definitely get the part about looking fine on the outside and people not getting it. But those internal scars are all too real."
CPTSD,fc1uuru,t1_fc1rhtx,1577330432.0,I'm really awe struck you used the resources you had access to (through no small sacrifice I'm sure) to forge your own path and make such an amazing sounding life for yourself. Very inspiring <3

I definitely agree with you about those generational pieces. 

I've never done actual group therapy, maybe I'll try it. Groups are hard because I don't really have any hobbies"
CPTSD,fbzo2oz,t1_fber0sm,1577253523.0,"Yeah I think I let myself drown in self pity too much.. I think it's similar to seeking reassurance for me, I used to never let myself stop and had to be this uber fake positive person.. then at some point the crash hit and I've been lost in wallowing for years...

So taking space for yourself and then asking yourself what you're needing works for you, I'm going to try that.. I hope I remember when I am in that visceral moment!"
