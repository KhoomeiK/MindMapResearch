Okay, so now we have factions functioning as terrorist organizations who are willing to kill civilians in order to fill a power vacuum, most of which are funded by actual governments.

I'm sorry, but yes we have all heard the phrase, ""Kill a terrorist create ten more."" But academia has literally stuck their head up their has with this idea that they have missed the forest for the trees.  This has come to the point where killing a high ranking government official doubling as a head of terrorist coalitions is somehow a bad kill.

It's not like we aim to kill civilians, most of the time these deaths are due to collateral damage, not acts of butchery that are done by terrorists.

Peer-reviewed articles are not free to produce. Hundreds of non-profit and commercial publishers across America make significant investments, at no cost to taxpayers, to finance the peer-review, publication, distribution, and long-term stewardship of these articles. Relying on a highly important and successful marketplace and the bedrock copyright laws that make it possible, publishers disseminate these articles to users in hundreds of foreign markets, supporting billions of dollars in U.S. exports and an extensive network of American businesses and jobs. This network includes American professional societies that invest in educating and nurturing our nation’s scientists, engineers, doctors, and other researchers.

“The American publishing industry invests billions of dollars financing, organizing, and executing the world’s leading peer-review process in order to ensure the quality, reliability, and integrity of the scientific record,” said Maria A. Pallante, President & CEO of the Association of American Publishers. “The result is a public-private partnership that advances America’s position as the global leader in research, innovation, and scientific discovery. If the proposed policy goes into effect, not only would it wipe out a significant sector of our economy, it would also cost the federal government billions of dollars, undermine our nation’s scientific research and innovation, and significantly weaken America’s trade position. Nationalizing this essential function—that our private, non-profit scientific societies and commercial publishers do exceedingly well—is a costly, ill-advised path.”"

During his speech, Morrison said his government was looking at “serious mechanisms that can successfully outlaw these indulgent and selfish practices that threaten the livelihoods of fellow Australians.” He argued that the “right to protest does not mean there is an unlimited license to disrupt people’s lives and disrespect your fellow Australians.”

Businesses linked to climate change were being refused banking, insurance and consulting services, Morrison said, due to the demands of activists. “I think some of our largest corporations should listen to and engage to their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones,” he said.""

Libertarian,fczoq97,t1_fcywp8c,1578105849.0,"Yeah.  In 1972 there were 586,720 legal abortions and 130,000 illegal abortions. In 1973, there were 1.6 million legal abortions.

1.6 million - (586,720 + 130,000) = 883,280

Also keep in mind that legal abortions stayed at 1.6 million through the 80's while illegal abortions decreased dramatically, going to 17,000 by 1974.  So for most years the real difference is around 1 million lives.

Fun fact, in 1972 there were 39 deaths due to legal abortion, by 1975 there were three."
Libertarian,fcxmx23,t1_fcwtsl4,1578066762.0,"On point 2, the usual phraseology is that ""If left to its natural devices, they human will grow to full capacity"" a sperm or an egg, separated, have a ZERO percent chance of becoming a human.

The larger concept is that a fetus is a step in the human life cycle.  We don't call a child not a human because they haven't grown to adulthood.  This is why abortion activists invented the idea of ""personhood,"" it is an attempt to draw a line in the sand for what constitutes a human deserving of rights that is not the accepted conception standard.

On point 4, a ban on abortions will cause a decrease in abortions generally, but, yes, an increase in unsafe abortions.  But let's take a look at this from a utilitarian perspective.  If abortion causes the death of a human life, then an abortion policy that allows for a million to happen annually would be a million dead.  If abortion were not legalized, then say the most desperate 50,000 get it done and let's make the wild assumption that ALL of them die, mother and child too, that would still be a lower death toll than legalized abortion.

Apply this same argument to slavery.  Yes people will still be enslaving people, they do today, but not nearly at the same rate as during legalization."

Now what you're simply arguing is that profit = exploitation, and I can't accept that.  The point of hiring these employees is that they will hopefully give you more value than they are to pay, that isn't exploitation, that's an investment.  In fact, that's the whole reason the business was started and these products were created, to make money.

Now the employee didn't create that $1 million in value all by himself.  The company had to pay the upfront costs and capital and incur all the liability to be able to increase the productivity of the workers.  The capitalist needs the workers as much as the worker needs the capitalist.  

If the worker was ""unexploited"" in your definition, the employer wouldn't have a business to start and the employee would have no job to speak of."
