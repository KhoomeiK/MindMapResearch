pregnant,ffdve6h,t1_ffdm9y8,1579829880.0,i haven’t peed yet but at 30 weeks i think it’s gonna happen soon. he literally just kicked me so hard and i’m sitting and i thought i was going to pee a little. 😩
pregnant,ffd7uay,t3_esuzpx,1579815110.0,the first time you get belly stretch marks!
pregnant,ffc734c,t3_estuqg,1579793051.0,gaviscon was helping me for a while if you can find it. i had to ask my doctor if i can just take pepcid everyday though and she approved me too. the heartburn and reflux was so severe. i haven’t had either in days thanks to the pepcid. you should ask about it!
pregnant,ffbu0t8,t3_esnwhe,1579782706.0,"yup. i got lasik last october, got pregnant in july, and needed glasses for driving by like september. i won’t go get any because i guess it’s normal for vision changes to happen while pregnant. my doctor said it typically reverts back."
pregnant,ffbslyr,t3_esm7n2,1579781201.0,"this is the one i have, i love it. super padded makes it comfy to wear, comes with a changing pad, has a pocket for wipes on the side, large zipper opening, and also has the thing on the back to slide it onto your luggage handle easily. we got something we’d want to use as a regular backpack as well not just a baby bag.

babies,ffbsdf6,t3_esptd1,1579780928.0,"what says wait 3 weeks? the aap recommends pacifiers from the get go as it reduces the risk of sids. 

do you swaddle? get something like a halo swaddle and put baby in their bassinet/crib/pack n okay as it’s safest for sleep. 

they will get used to the world eventually, it’s new and scary right now. you’re not doing anything wrong! it’s hard going from this nice warm dark environment to the new world. they need some time to adjust.

you can warm the bassinet with a heating pad as well just remove the blanket before actually putting the baby in there."
PlantBasedDiet,ffbrx55,t3_escauf,1579780397.0,"i just made a huge batch of overnight oats! i like chocolatey and peanut buttery so i use protein powder, milk, pb, and usually a touch of cinnamon. i need to try some fruity varieties like this!"
BabyBumps,ffbkic3,t3_esna0g,1579769666.0,"my coming home outfit will be some comfy maternity shorts and a big ass t shirt 😂 no one will be at home waiting for us. and even if they were, i want to be comfy. 

my sons coming home outfit is more so his reveal photo outfit. i don’t care what he wears home but i did buy a cut outfit to post his photo for my family to see since they live so far. 

it’s gender neutral, idk why you’d need like specific boy or girl clothes either."
pregnant,ffbhm62,t3_esp410,1579765680.0,adjusting how i sit helps. i lean my chair back in the car and it helps alleviate some pressure.
BabyBumps,ffau324,t1_ffakalp,1579744511.0,i’m sorry for your loss :( pregnancy can be so terrifying especially when you’ve already had a loss. i hope you have a good support system at the very least to surround yourself with ❤️

BabyBumps,ffajoh4,t1_ffajklm,1579737408.0,oof yeah that’s way too expensive for me since it just is a regular purse with a changing pad thrown in it looks like. i don’t spend that much on purses 😂 i like actual diaper bag backpacks because they have 8284596927 pockets haha

BabyBumps,ff8evju,t3_es4mki,1579675505.0,"it’s pricey ($40 when we got it) but we got [this one! ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZS4Z3Z/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_j8-jEbCMF2DBN) 

It’s so comfortable to wear. Baby isn’t here yet but I love all the features. It even has the spot to slide it onto your luggage when traveling which is a huge bonus since it’ll just become a regular backpack to use after we’re done with babies. 

I like ones that come with a travel changing pad, large opening to find things easily, and comfy padding which this one all has. And a wipes pocket! I love those on the side for easy access too."
todayilearned,ff8eihp,t1_ff8eepv,1579675091.0,"Oh wow, yeah that’s a long time for narcotics. Gotta do what you gotta do though. I really hope your recent procedure worked then and you finally get some relief! 

I’ll look into all that! My husband stayed active but that’s coming to an end this year and we have to learn the civilian life again. Quite a bit nervous tbh about all this kind of stuff and how it all works. I’ll definitely look into the percentages and VA and whatnot because I’ll definitely need help for my back again eventually."
todayilearned,ff8e3bl,t1_ff8dydy,1579674618.0,"Thanks! They didn’t explain to me very well except the no rating vs 0% rating part haha 

Oh man, hope you’re healing well! Chronic pain is a bitch and a half. 

They did a procedure to cauterize my nerves right before I got out and it’s held up well enough the past few years. I just have chronic spine pain due to arthritis and I’m too scared to go back in for more treatment so I just motrin/tylenol it most of the time 😬 Once I’m done having kids I’ll probably finally head back in and see what can be done."
BabyBumps,ff8di0u,t3_es6bxj,1579673964.0,I realized the other day I’m super thankful to be living overseas while we have our first baby (military). My family is the type where everyone waits the entire time in the waiting room. I never realized how this could make a new mom feel as it’s expected in my family. My family would probably stop talking to me for a while if I said I wanted it to be just us 3 for a bit. I’m sorry you’re experiencing the push back but I’m so so glad your husband is on board and also speaking up about it! Sounds like you guys are a good team 💕
todayilearned,ff8ckpj,t1_ff8chnn,1579672979.0,well obviously. i was just asking what they were referring to from the recruiter bit of their statement.
todayilearned,ff8ca0o,t1_ff87ex6,1579672670.0,"what are you referring to? i never had my recruiter tell me anything other than i’ll get free college money and can go to school for free while active too.

eta: i wasn’t asking in a snarky manner by the way. just wondering if i got lucky on my recruiter or something."
todayilearned,ff8c5cl,t1_ff8b64j,1579672540.0,"the percentage equates to a monetary value you receive. i’m not sure how else to describe it, that’s probably the easiest way to understand it. 

as far as the actual medical care based off the percentages, you can be either at no percentage or 0%-100% on a range of issues. 0% means that if the problem worsens over time, you can always go to the VA for treatment for it but no rating means you can’t. 

i hope someone else explains it better. i have a 60% rating due to mental health and back issues both caused by the military and i’m really fumbling on how to adequately explain the percentages lol sorry, i tried my best. i hope that makes a little sense anyways."
BabyBumps,ff7qoao,t3_es0n2j,1579656015.0,"due date twins and feeling the same support! it’s nice but i feel guilty. i quit my job around 23 weeks because that place sucked booty and i feel so guilty now when i take a nap every other day. one day i forced myself to not nap and was miserable and my husband came home and was like wtf dude?? just take a nap?? and he eased a lot of my guilt with that haha also. if you can, buy a roomba 😂 it’s the only way my

fitpregnancy,ff7q5we,t3_es1vtw,1579655660.0,"I don’t track mine regularly, whenever I go to the obgyn though they weigh me and I go roughly every 4 weeks. The first weight was right after I got a positive home test and got my confirmation blood results and stuff.

namenerds,ff7lebo,t3_eryih7,1579652328.0,"Not really the same at all, I guess the reverse. I am white and my husband is hispanic. His last name isn’t like in your face hispanic, but to white people - it definitely is a little different. We’re coming up on our 3rd anniversary and I still don’t feel like I fit my new name. I feel like I’ve stolen a culture or something by taking his last name? That probably makes no sense... But now that we’re having a baby, I am growing into it more I think. It will tie us 3 together in my eyes and that makes me feel better about it. It makes me excited to teach my son where his dad and family have come from (my husband is first gen as well, his parents moved to america when they were kids). 

Anyways, just sharing I guess the opposite of what you went through. Thank you for sharing your story! I really enjoy this side of name nerds and the different cultures it brings to the table for everyone to learn about."
pregnant,ff64xhv,t1_ff61nu0,1579619222.0,"I second this! Realistically you might have to answer some questions about why your little one is spending so much time with this seemingly random other family, but anyone who gives you shit for it, doesn’t need to be involved. Surround yourself with the people who love you and are supportive. It may not be many, but quality over quantity and all that. It sounds like your daughters bio dad’s family is excited and on board, you might be able to find a lot of support with them as well. Good luck to you guys 💕"

pregnant,feysyqv,t1_feysa2q,1579450231.0,That’s good to hear! I’m getting mixed reviews so it seems really person dependent I guess. I just don’t see my previa fixing itself in 6 short weeks so I’m trying to wrap my head around it all. I’m nervous to go for a vaginal if it does and end up in a c section anyways! That seems like double the recovery too.

newborns,fewnlq5,t3_eqsfhn,1579415903.0,"I guess if you’re concerned about ingredients, just use water and a cloth and wash them properly. “the dose makes the poison” BKC in wipes isn’t really a concern. It’s used as a microbial agent because otherwise the wipes are more at risk to molding considering they’re just water and cloth essentially. Which is why normal baby wipes have so many preservatives and ingredients. They’re a cloth object sitting in water and need to not mold to remain safe for use."

NewParents,fe79bhd,t3_eo05hn,1578911658.0,"it’s better to be too cold vs too hot. hot babies get quiet whereas cold babies tend to cry. check the back or chest for indication if baby is too hot or cold. try something and if it works or doesn’t work go from there. each baby can be a little different.

[ this chart ](https://imgur.com/a/Jv2Giai)  is what the safe sleep group i’m in shares to kind of find of starting point. 

here’s also the pinned post on temperature-plus the accurate sources (aap is a great one if you ever want to look up something on safe sleep guidelines) 

“Body Temperature

Parents and caregivers should touch baby’s chest, tummy or back to feel if baby is too hot or too cold. Baby’s tummy and chest should feel warm and dry, not sweaty or cold. Trunk temperature is an accurate representation of core temp. Hands and feet are normally cold in infants and NOT an indicator of core temperature.

AAP: “Bluish and cool hands and feet are normal on healthy infants, and the cool sensation of extremities likely do not bother baby at all.” (Last updated 2016) 

https://www.healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/How-long-is-it-appropriate-to-keep-hand-mittens-on-newborn-baby.aspx



Room Temperature 

It is generally advised to keep the room temperature in the 68-72°F (20-22°C) degree range. 

Per the AAP, ""space heaters are involved in 79% of fatal home heating fires. If space heaters are in use, there should be a 3 foot open zone - make sure they are not close to curtains, blankets, or other potentially flammable materials. Always turn off and unplug when unattended, when leaving the room, or sleeping.""



Clothing

As a general guide, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends dressing baby in no greater than one layer more than an adult would wear to be comfortable at the same temperature. 

There are no recommendations for or against mittens, but they are not necessary. Scratching is not a concern when nails are kept short. 

Babies should not sleep with hats/hoods on due to the risk of overheating/suffocation with the exception of newborns in the hospital that cannot yet regulate their body temp. Babies should be changed out of hooded clothing prior to sleep. 

The clothing infograph in this Unit is a basic guide for how to dress baby for sleep. Some babies run warmer or colder than others. Do NOT overdress the baby. It is better for baby to be on the cooler side because overheating is a risk factor for SIDS. 

Blankets should never be used for babies under one year of age. The AAP does not mention introducing blankets until 18-24 months. We must note that bedding related deaths have occurred up to 24 months. Wearable blankets are advised to keep babies warm in lieu of blankets. 



Wearable Blankets/Sleep Sacks

“Infant sleep clothing, such as sleeping sacks, are designed to keep the infant warm and can be used in place of blankets to prevent the possibility of head covering or entrapment.” Always ensure baby is wearing the correct size per the manufacturer's guidelines. For more information on swaddling and sleep sacks, please review that unit.   



What is Tog?

The tog is a measure of thermal insulance/resistance, or how well insulated a fabric is. Lower numbers indicate a lighter tog (cotton) and higher numbers indicate a heavier tog (fleece). For more information: https://www.halosleep.com/tog-values-chart/

It works best with his middle name which is an honor name so it’s permanent. Idk, I guess I’ll see how I feel when he gets earthside. Hopefully I like it and it sticks lol"
pregnant,fdtneel,t3_en1mnw,1578719289.0,I’ve been craving margaritas too!  😭 i didn’t even drink a lot before i got pregnant. lol
BabyBumps,fdqec9h,t3_emqjpe,1578664450.0,was wearing a belly band that i can totally turn around myself. brought my husband scissors to cut the tag out of the back... that i could have just turned to the front...oh well lol
BabyBumps,fdq3vg9,t3_emifu7,1578653588.0,"ha you sound like me. i have pcos too. i had started my first month of meds (metformin) and was 4 days out from my period being due when my hcg and ovulation tests came in the mail. was gonna hop in the shower and decided to practice peeing in a cup and test them. ovulation was blazing positive which made no sense until i check the hcg one and it was the faintest positive ever. i had actually hopped out of the shower to check it and ran down with a towel half wrapped around me soaking wet crying to my husband “is this REEEEAL?!” 😂 

congratulations!! it’s a nerve wracking exciting time. i’m 28+2 and it’s been a pretty wonderful journey so far (with a lot of peeing and heartburn lmao)"
AmItheAsshole,fdq26tq,t1_fdpy4o1,1578651207.0,playing alongside others is an important step in socialization skills though. not sure what your point was lol
aww,fdpp9lo,t1_fdpiqqc,1578635422.0,my vet examines my 80 pound girl on the floor. seems easier than stressing a dog out to put them up and down off a table.
PlanetZoo,fdovurj,t1_fdnvqn4,1578614048.0,i’ve just restarted my sandbox 384859797 times (i’m about to again too 😂) i like that i can just click random stuff and it not cost me money.
pregnant,fdmxcr4,t1_fdmsfyu,1578570055.0,yikes really? i’d probably find a new midwife. pregnancy is scary and a lot of weird stuff happens. i’d be pissed if my doctor told me i wasn’t allowed to call if i was concerned about something :(
pregnant,fdmxbfa,t3_em5dsx,1578570012.0,I would. Especially if you’re having a hard time keeping fluids down too. Becoming dehydrated wouldn’t benefit you or baby.
pregnant,fdmx8fi,t3_em86nd,1578569913.0,Could be prodromal labor :( I had a friend who basically experienced contractions for weeks before real labor started. I hope your body gets it together soon and starts the real thing for you!
pregnant,fdmx69p,t3_em89ep,1578569843.0,😂 I feel you. I went to sleep early and it was still torture. I did the 3 hour off the bat though since I have pcos and was higher risk. Didn’t want to do the test multiple times if I failed the one hour. Definitely ate a huge burger and fries aaaand a milkshake afterwards 💃🏼
PlanetZoo,fdmsi7p,t3_em6iix,1578563599.0,this is so creative! i love seeing people post builds here. i’m new to the game and it gives me something to emulate so i stop having square grid builds 😂
pregnant,fdmqos3,t3_em6mqx,1578561049.0,you can get them during pregnancy or after. there’s no way to tell when or if they’ll happen.
pregnant,fdmqnek,t3_em767v,1578560995.0,"you don’t need to convince him. you don’t want more children, full stop. he can’t force you. family therapy could be good for him to learn to cope with the fact you won’t be having anymore kids."
PlanetZoo,fdmpxkt,t1_fdmpxat,1578559995.0,thank you!!
PlanetZoo,fdmps7t,t3_elvaqt,1578559795.0,how do you get the lily pads to actually float and be on top of the water? mine disappear under so i just delete them :(
pregnant,fdmp4pu,t3_elu28y,1578558918.0,just entered my third tri and the exhaustion is back. hell i even quit my job. the second tri really is a blissful period. well most of it. i had like a good 8-10 weeks of energy lol
PlanetZoo,fdmnfmx,t1_fdmnenp,1578556741.0,"oh gotcha! thanks:) i only tried franchise briefly but it was so hard to learn, so i’m trying sandbox to educate myself haha"
PlanetZoo,fdmm6lj,t3_em4zkb,1578555251.0,"wait the trading center animals come from other players? (sorry, new to the game. didn’t realize that!)"
PlanetZoo,fdmgkr2,t1_fdmdi0x,1578549182.0,thank you!
