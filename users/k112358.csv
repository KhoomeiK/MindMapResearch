IAmA,fecuwid,t1_febfjou,1578985579.0,"I feel like this is one of those wonderful luxuries that actually isn’t that financially out of reach for normal people on normal incomes. Yes you might balk at $250 for a bottle of fragrance, but if you like it it’s likely to last a long time, and stores often let you step into the higher end world by sampling for free or cheap to help make a decision. I highly recommend it! I’m a fan of http://www.luckyscent.com - the Scent Bar - in LA! (Not affiliated with them directly)"
IAmA,fecurii,t1_feay1kz,1578985421.0,"Take a silver sir - that is excellent advice. So long as you are respectful there’s no shame in working your connections or taking advantage of an opportunity to rub shoulders with people who could give you a shot. At the very least, you’ll get a bit of advice regardless. You can be in the right place and the right time but make sure to take action!"

vancouver,feapz7c,t3_eo7b1o,1578951217.0,Pretty hilarious that a high end “sport utility vehicle” with awd can’t even handle an inch of snow. Why exactly do these things exist again?

AskReddit,fcxyi6v,t1_fcxmolv,1578072247.0,when I turned into an old man at 32 Metamucil changed my life. Now I know why all those old people get so excited about it!

StarWars,fctrsli,t1_fbzhe91,1577956153.0,This was for me one of the stupidest plot holes in the movie that I couldn’t stop thinking about. Those ships need a lot of crew.
StarWars,fctrqhv,t1_fcotdhu,1577956067.0,The whole scene would have been way more powerful if they stuck to the “you’re just a nobody from Jaku” that TLJ really pushed. The Palpatine bloodline messed it up.

ProductManagement,fclzlir,t1_fcly99n,1577760386.0,"Thanks! I’m leaning toward the architect role as well, but how can we ensure that the new VP and the new architect don’t just butt heads over technical decisions? I think our current VP is quite protective of those decisions and that code (too protective even)."
ProductManagement,fclkfn0,t1_fclk6un,1577749864.0,"Head of company does not want to lose him, but frustrated because can’t find out a way to manage him/reign him in/get better communication.

We’ve had multiple meetings where we talk through the challenges, and the most recent ones were asking more “what role would you like to take here? Do you not want to manage people anymore? We can help with that. Do you need support?” He's always agreeable, but it’s not solving the communication, management, and accountability issues. Nothing seems to be changing. My thought was that maybe he needed a direct manager, but I fear that since he is the only one who fully knows the code that this could lead to conflict."
ProductManagement,fclix44,t1_fcli7sr,1577748857.0,"I am the head of Product, he is the head of Engineering. We both report to the head of the company separately. There is no C level at this time."

Jira is a tool built specifically for software development. Asana is a much more broad project management tool. Jira is more narrow, Asana is more wide."

Being a similar height weight and build to you, Id recommend keeping the momentum going on your cut. Having been 160 before (my goal again), you’ll have a lot more definition at that weight and you’ll also feel better (lighter on your feet, clothes fit well, leaner physique, etc). IMPP of course."

I have always known of my own tendencies to have ocd like thoughts and behaviors, but always dismissed them as normal or not severe.

relationships,fc7uafa,t1_fc6tpwf,1577518811.0,"Do not feel completely responsible, it is an emotional and mental frame that they are in, not you. It runs deep, and threads it’s way all the way down to their own primal feelings of fear, abandonment, safety, etc. When you start to touch those nerves, the emotional response can be... extreme. I’m not trying to scare you, just give some perspective. It’s not that your parents don’t love their children. But it’s a very deep emotional and mental depth that hoarding goes, and conversations on the surface (even if sometimes they feel deep) aren’t enough. Therapy can help. Support them as much as you can - you still love them - but when they put you in dangerous situations and can’t see it, you need to stand up for yourself. Good luck and I wish you success with this!"
