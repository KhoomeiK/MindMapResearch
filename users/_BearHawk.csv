He published it to highlight the plight of immigrant workers in the US, but what really grabbed people's attention was the documentation of the horrible food prep. Like, absolutely disgusting tales. Here's a sample:

> It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.

And Upton said ""I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach."", which is so true because this led to the passage of numerous food safety regulations, which led to the FDA being created soon after. Crazy!!"
