blursedimages,felymth,t1_felq2j7,1579234298.0,"I laughed my ass off reading your response. It was devastating, the thing just fell right off. I couldn’t explain it if I tried, but life changed for me. I have to withstand the humiliation of walking into stores where pants are not allowed. I try to wear shirts long enough to cover my bottom half, but it’s wasted effort when I have to reach soy sauce on the top shelf in a supermarket aisle. I have started ordering food delivery service to my home. Thank god I can wear pants in my own home, but shirts and shoes are not allowed. This makes family holidays tense at my house, but rules are rules."
Tinder,fe5yx59,t3_enscwb,1578878039.0,Update: friend knows him and advised me the boy pictured hit and killed a woman on a bicycle.
Tinder,fe4icyk,t1_fe4hdwz,1578859595.0,Or maybe he only owns one outfit. The mystery may never be solved.
Tinder,fe4g32n,t1_fe4fzyk,1578858937.0,In the first two photos judging by his clothes it looks like he got pulled over in the same day
iamveryedgy,fe4dmuf,t1_fe4cuno,1578858162.0,Oh okay
dontflinch,fe3c55d,t1_fe2zvje,1578847987.0,Bro what the fuck
offmychest,fdxo7iv,t1_fdxl0vq,1578771170.0,The one good thing I got going for me is that I only drink water
offmychest,fdxgvqx,t1_fdxfcmv,1578768576.0,This sounds like a good idea. I chew gum when I want to try quitting smoking and it helps distract me from that. Maybe it can distract me from food too.
offmychest,fdxdnsf,t1_fdxcyom,1578767692.0,We have a candy bucket at work and I’ll take some candy into my car on my break and just eat it on my lunch break. It’ll be humiliating asking my coworkers to watch my eating habits. I know I need some help with this I just feel too embarrassed.
offmychest,fdxd683,t1_fdxcuuf,1578767620.0,I haven’t. I plan on asking my dad for therapy/psychiatrist again for my birthday in a few months. It could be linked to my depression/anxiety and weed habit. It’s been like this since I was 13 when my mom left. My dad lacked in the good meals department because he was too busy resenting us so I got to eat whatever I wanted.
IsItBullshit,fdslps9,t1_fdsl5vc,1578704820.0,"Your language shows you’re worked up, not me disagreeing with you. I travel often to different states, 20/50 states visited so far and I have seen the same patterns as in my home town. I’m certain I know what I am talking about, but I appreciate the efforts given."
IsItBullshit,fdsjngi,t1_fdshak3,1578703988.0,Refer to my last line where I said it will not work unless there is a sensor pad. I understand you have several lights near you that are timed and all intersections are not sensor driven. I did not say those lights change when you go up to them. I specifically referenced sensor pads. There is no need to become worked up over your misunderstanding of traffic lights. It’s just traffic lights.
IsItBullshit,fdsg0lu,t1_fdsd8cl,1578701946.0,"It is not that far from 100% true, maybe some areas don’t do that (which I wouldn’t understand why they wouldn’t aside from big cities) but when there is a low amount of traffic such as 3 cars a minute (like at 12am) the lights automatically begin to shift when you land on the sensor pad. Of course it doesn’t work without the sensor pad though at lights."
IsItBullshit,fds3znd,t1_fdqrduk,1578693909.0,I’d also like to add at night like around-12am the light automatically starts to turn green because there are barely cars on the road and it knows you’re there
ATBGE,fdr98ed,t1_fdpwmhp,1578681190.0,Got the Tom cruise tooth
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkwv9s,t1_fdkwl7n,1578512817.0,Yeah it makes me wonder why I even try after the first and then I remember I’m depressed and have nothing better to do
TooAfraidToAsk,fdktrtb,t1_fdjtwpq,1578510991.0,"I can make myself finish six or more times in a row, but usually after the first the climax it gets worse and worse."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdkpxh2,t1_fdkphis,1578508703.0,You inspired me very much god bless you
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkptt8,t1_fdkp3ms,1578508643.0,I would absolutely love to buy it. Maybe someone who cares will buy it. I just can not afford to purchase something not in my current budget.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkpq9i,t1_fdkp2jy,1578508584.0,"It’s town property, not a homeowner property but I’ll take that into consideration"
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkplhw,t1_fdkp21r,1578508505.0,"The amount of vacant homes on my island can almost house every family who already live in homes. The amount of vacant homes on my island can house every homeless person on my island. I’d like to clarify my island has 7 million people.  We do not need the construction. We do not need the tearing down of woodland. This is not a fear of growth, this is a fear of ruining our planet more than it is already ruined. I want us as humans to save and preserve as much woods and forests and lakes as we can. I want millennials grandchildren to see the world too. This is a fear of mass destruction."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkp1n1,t1_fdkox0v,1578508176.0,"I know this question is something you might not be able to answer, but would you happen to know if it’s possible in anyway to talk to someone about cancelling the selling of the property?"
AmItheAsshole,fdjoool,t1_fdjodew,1578481166.0,Everyone sucks here
happy,fd33s8d,t3_ejww03,1578154461.0,A beautiful woman radiating such positive light.
AskReddit,fcscxv0,t1_fcpjfcn,1577914791.0,"Same. Was on my friends bunk bed. My sister was there too and decided to climb the wall/doorway in my friends bedroom and hit the switch for the ceiling fan. I stood up on the bunk bed a minute later not realizing it was turned on and got hit on the bridge of my nose, almost cutting into my eye. Blood everywhere and stitches placed. I’m okay"
badmakeup,fcqvm0g,t3_eihrzp,1577892881.0,"I have to be honest this doesn’t appear to be the worst make up, it almost sounds like you have negative feelings towards her and just wanted to stomp on her anonymously."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcodqth,t1_fcodksl,1577829750.0,Oh. Okay
TikTokCringe,fcnll38,t1_fcnhl2v,1577813845.0,Kinda like how talk shows do the exact same thing just with different people
TikTokCringe,fcm3h6n,t1_fcm2jqj,1577763258.0,You would be correct.
animalsdoingstuff,fchtvft,t3_eh58gn,1577654074.0,This dog has such patience that I thought the video kept freezing when it was pulled the blocks out
ShaqHoldingThings,fchobuy,t1_fcg4qwh,1577652377.0,My face dropped because these were the exact words in my head
AskReddit,fcc5skd,t1_fcc3r9f,1577594736.0,I’m not proud of this upvote but it needed to be done
Tinder,fc4684r,t1_fc45g6b,1577407716.0,A for effort
insaneparents,fc0bo5l,t1_fc09fqw,1577286107.0,It was a lesson learned.
insaneparents,fc06fa3,t1_fc00dcw,1577280605.0,Room was very much useable. I have one long sheet but it’s width is only 2 feet so it’s just enough to use when working on a single wall and doesn’t take up a lot of space. Lots of walking space and no materials were in the way. Furniture was only moved two feet away from the walls.
