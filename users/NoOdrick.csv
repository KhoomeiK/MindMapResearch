menstrualcups,fdt0o8w,t3_emzt50,1578710399.0,"It definitely does get easier but for some people, you have to get a different cup. The first two cups I bought (Flex Cup, Lily Cup Compact) were completely wrong for my body & I could not for the life of me get them in place properly. They constantly leaked and I almost gave up, thinking cups weren't for me. 

Then I bought a third cup (Saalt Regular) and it is the day to my night. I love my cup so much. I know when it's in correctly and I never leak at all. I have even tried using my Lily Cup since I've found success with the Saalt and I still do not like it"

dogs,fdhc3m4,t1_fdhaoem,1578419726.0,I agree that bear repellent is too much. There is dog repellent spray for people with your exact situation. I would go for that
menstrualcups,fdfm7ye,t3_ek7tab,1578364945.0,"It does have a steep learning curve! 

I'm on my 5th (yes, you heard that right...FIFTH) cycle with my cup & I still don't get it in right every time. Although the first 3 cycles, I didn't have the proper cup. I found my goldilocks cup last month.

 I just started my cycle today and it took me 2 tries to get the cup in properly. When you do finally get it in correctly, you just KNOW, right? It's such a good feeling"
menstrualcups,fdfkm64,t1_fdfik0s,1578363893.0,"I also bought Knix thong panties (5 pair) to use with my cup as a backup & I wanted to love them but after washing them 2 or 3 times (and air drying) they fray soooooo bad. Did that happen to yours? They are great panties but the elastic t
frays all over the top & it makes them look awful"

Definitely no hair will stick to that if you shake it when you make the bed in the morning. Not everyone likes that kind of fabric though and it is pricey BUT it IS a solution to the hair problem"
dogs,fcm1dce,t3_e693nq,1577761688.0,"No insurance will cover the surgery because the conditions are preexisting. Even if you wait a year, when you submit your medical history, they will see that the dog had all of these issues prior to purchasing a policy. I'm sure you know this already, just clearing it up for other readers"
dogs,fcm0x63,t1_fc40yee,1577761352.0,This is such excellent advise.
menstrualcups,fcm0flb,t3_eh0wez,1577760994.0,"3rd time was the charm for me

- I got the Flex cup first but it was too soft & gimmicky. I leaked almost every time I wore it, probably wasn't opening properly 

- 2nd cup was the Lily Compact, which is a joke. It is the softest thing I ever touched & it would compact when I inserted it & I was never able to get it in to wear it

- Then I got my Saalt Soft Regular & I'm in love. The end"
dogs,fcggq3i,t3_dotvw8,1577639768.0,"Embrace's policy would consider the pulled muscle a temporary preexisting condition. If your pet goes a full 12 months symptom free, then it is no longer preexisting.

When I got my cat insured with them, he had a bout of undiagnosed diarrhea a few weeks before I purchased the policy. I requested a Medical History Review and they said he had a temporary preexisting condition of ""enteritis"" (diarrhea) and that it would drop if he went a full 12 months without having symptoms.

If my cat were to develop any condition within that 12 months where diarrhea could be a symptom (cancer, IBD, Pancreatitis, any GI disease) then it would not be covered, due to the preexisting ""enteritis"". However, my cat went several years without having diarrhea again so the preexisting condition was dropped. 

In 2018, my cat was diagnosed with Large Cell Lymphoma (cancer) and Embrace covered every exam, diagnostic test, Xray, medication & even his euthanasia with no problem."
BostonTerrier,fcgcw1y,t3_e9c90j,1577638734.0,"I'm sorry to hear about your puppy :(

I know for a fact that your breeder will not cover the cost of the surgeries. Most of the time, the health guarantee is only if your puppy has a TERMINAL illness during the guarantee time frame, which this is not. At best, they will replace your puppy in return for your current one. Do you have a copy of your contract? 

My dad's boston terrier also had the same surgery, although I don't remember if it was just one knee or both at the same time. The surgery was a success & the dog has no issues. She didn't have hip dysplasia, though.

My 8yo cat also just had a surgery for luxating patella in her left leg 2 days ago & we're currently in recovery. My cat also has severe hip dysplasia & arthritis. Once she is recovered from surgery, we plan on doing adequan injections (glucosamine & chondroitin for joint health), laser therapy (at the vet for inflammation & pain relief) and Antinol (high omega 3 supplement) to control her hip dysplasia going forward."

menstrualcups,fb33d34,t3_eb7z9i,1576463328.0,"My cervix is also a Democrat (leans far left ðŸ˜œ)

I had the same problem as you my first few months. Always leaked & couldn't get it to create a seal, even when I tilted the cup to the left. I was using the Flex cup, size small, which was a horrible cup for beginners anyway due to (IMO) it being way too soft.

I switched cups and my cup NEVER leaks. I got a SAALT SOFT, Regular size, & I think it helped in 2 ways:

1.) Even though it is the ""Soft"" version, it is much more firm than the Flex cup & opens with no problem for me

2.) I got the larger size cup (Regular), even though I have never given birth. I was under the impression that unless you have given birth, you could only have the small size but I guess I needed the larger rim to seal better around my cervix

I insert my cup with my right hand to face the opening towards the left to cover my cervix. My cervix is also pretty low so the bottom of my SAALT sits right above my pelvic bone & it is very obviously almost completely sideways. BUT it catches all the flow & I haven't leaked since I got this cup"
