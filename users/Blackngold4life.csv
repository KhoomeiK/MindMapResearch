I had a guy that lived in my dorm that once forgot to add water to ramen noodles and burnt them, the smell remained in the room after he moved out and on top of that he left sweaty clothes laying around in there all the time so....you get the idea. They eventually tore down that dorm....I'm confident that had something to do with it ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"
college,fdymtdi,t3_en9a8e,1578781459.0,"Teddy Grahams with a can of icing was something I loved, they were better than Dunkaroos. Tostitos and Queso. Doritos with a dip I made called ""crack dip"" because you can't stop eating it (sour cream, hot sauce, pepper, and shredded cheese). Can't forget about Oreos. Cereal/milk always hit the spot. Oatmeal and dried fruit for a healthy breakfast. Protein bars."

I applaud you for being able to do what you have done with the entrepreneurship though, I wish I had that kind of drive. Businesses can be up and down with the economy and changing consumer tastes. If you work as a chemical engineer, you can still have a side gig."
college,fda3hme,t3_ekc7j5,1578241231.0,"First thing, is there a college near your home you can commute to that has your major? If so, that may be a better option. Just make sure your credits ALL transfer. For some, being away from home is hard. For me, that was different. I enjoyed a change of scenery, but it was tough at the same time because I put too much pressure on myself to make friends when I was there for an education, not social hour."
college,fbt02bg,t3_ee694p,1577064735.0,"I know it might be tough to see right now, but it definitely does change and get better. First off all, people that are willing to end a friendship at a moments notice over dumb stuff aren't really your true friends. You are at a pivotal point in your life where it might be time to part ways with some people. Don't get me wrong, that's hard to do when its what you've known for awhile, and it may be uncomfortable at first, but you will be glad you did. If you are going to college, you may meet a completely new set of friends when you're there. What you might also try is to stop being the one to make all the plans over text/etc. You can wear yourself out trying to be that person. Be who you are, and the friendships that are worth having will stay, the ones that are not true friends will move on. Unfortunately, there are some people that never grow up or out of the immaturity of using other people, but most people seem to."
