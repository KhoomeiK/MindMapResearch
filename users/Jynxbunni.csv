1. Rarely to seldom. It’s a computer based job, and everyone has a cubicle. Small talk happens between calls,  but that’s it. It’s also a 24/7 operation, and the shift I’m working now is not the one I will work. 

2. There’s maybe 20 people in the department. On any given day Interact/see maybe 5 or 6. 

3. Everyone seems very chill. It’s a very mentally intense job, and everyone is very well educated (at least a bachelors). 

4. Yes, I’d say maybe at most once every few days.

Rural carriers, on the other hand, get paid for x hours, no matter how long it takes them. If their route is calculated for 6 hours, and it takes 4 hours to deliver, they get paid for 6 hours. However if it takes 8 hours to deliver, they also get paid for 6 hours."
