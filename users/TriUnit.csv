If they did that while at rest, they couldn‚Äôt be contained in the jars they are stored in. And provided how strict instructions are for things, I can‚Äôt imagine tampering by adding heat again or something is advisable."
Showerthoughts,ff941w3,t1_ff4yp26,1579704334.0,"Ah. Eventually got around to checking. He had a cauldron brewing. 

‚ÄúSir, you haven‚Äôt told us what‚Äôs in this one,‚Äù said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn‚Äôs desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled. ‚ÄúOho,‚Äù said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. ‚ÄúYes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis.‚Äù

Come to think of it, he also had the poly juice...and veritas. Both of which take absolutely it a month I think.

JK fail."

bipolar,fe01rxj,t1_fdxua8z,1578800931.0,I wish that simply because it doesn‚Äôt imply one or the other. ‚ÄúBipolar‚Äù implies that both at the same time is just not a thing.
bipolar,fe008f6,t3_enfw5b,1578799952.0,"Mind if I ask why they added that to your cocktail?
I was prescribed it years ago and it changed my life. Had MORE energy on 2 mg daily than before because it lifted the pervasive, suffocating anxiety I thought was standard life.
Only time a benzo sedated me was when the pharmacy gave me Xanax instead of Ativan...and I needed one ASAP."

bipolar,fdygoql,t3_enaqdg,1578779584.0,"I describe it as like being in a plexiglass bubble. Absolute alienation from almost everyone. Socialize, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it. Not real connection.
I‚Äôve like two friends I‚Äôve actually socialized with in the past year, and one moved to Spain. :(

Everyone else exists in some different world and that part inside you that activates whole socializing just remains lifeless."
