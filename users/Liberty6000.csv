Plus, the fact that he might have it is not much to be worried about, 2 years ago, i was told that i definitely had deadly urinary or prostate cancer. They said it was certain that i had one or the other but most likely it was prostate cancer. They even said that my symptoms were so severe that although we had not done an X-Ray yet, it was deadly and I had a 0% chance of survival. X-ray showed symptoms of cancer but no cancer itself. Turns out that it was only a urinary valve that was misfiring along with other treatable abdominal and urinary issues! I am back to being healthy!
