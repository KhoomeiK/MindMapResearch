offmychest,fdu8npa,t1_fdu8b8a,1578729490.0,"I wasn’t allowed to comment on anything, whenever I tried to reddit would always delete my comment and just simply wouldn’t let me. As for their username it went something along the lines of like “Ra_kitty” I think ?????? 
I know I could attempt to find them on this account and attempt to message them here but I wanted it to stay with that account ya know"

And it’s fucked up to not take that into consideration but I’m done calling her if she’s gonna continue to pull that."
