I understand I’m not being helpful in validating this girl’s account of being at the dentist."
happy,fehkfa8,t1_fehhpw7,1579118349.0,"I mean, what makes more sense? 
That your teeth were rotting and needed attention, but the dentist wasn’t nice? 
Or, that the dentist did all that work for no reason at all? 
So many people blame dentists for their own oral hygiene. Dentists get a bad rap. 

But really, sorry you’ve had so many bad experiences. I hate having work done, too.

Also, I’m sure he showed your mom X-rays. Xrays show dental decay."

happy,fehh0tp,t1_fehgpqa,1579116361.0,"Im sorry. I know it sounded rude, but it’s the truth. I raised all my kids by myself, and worked for a dentist for 14 years. Kids shouldn’t need root canals, crowns, or even fillings. This is truly a case a neglect. Blaming the dentist is the most ridiculous thing."
happy,fehe106,t1_fegbdag,1579114613.0,"I’m sorry, but this is your moms fault, not the dentist. Just because you don’t have money, doesn’t mean you have bad oral health. Brushing your teeth, flossing, and rinsing is all you needed."

ThriftStoreHauls,fe010r6,t1_fe00iip,1578800444.0,"Give me a break. This is pointless. 

And yes, you are making a ridiculous statement. Sorry if I’ve offended you, but you should take a step back and realize this is not something to be offended by. Way too much energy wasted on being angry."
ThriftStoreHauls,fe00b13,t1_fdzzx8d,1578800000.0,"You obviously have deep rooted problems because you aren’t making sense. This isn’t insulting. I’m not insulted. So, if I dress like a man, I am mocking the gender? This is so beyond ridiculous. 

You don’t need to respond, but you’re trying to argue something that has zero merit."
ThriftStoreHauls,fdzz84c,t1_fdzyvxa,1578799329.0,"How did I attack you? In my opinion, it’s even worse that you are old enough to know this is not mockery, nor stereotypical. Why are you so mad?"
ThriftStoreHauls,fdzyjqe,t1_fdzy352,1578798927.0,You sound like just another young(ish?) girl who wants so badly to be a feminist but doesn’t actually understand what feminism actual means.
AnimalsBeingBros,fdzy15m,t1_fdyz017,1578798586.0,Is this photoshopped? I thought they were the size of foxes.
ThriftStoreHauls,fdzxpia,t1_fdzuux8,1578798347.0,Wtf are you blabbing about? I’m a woman and do not feel mocked at all.
