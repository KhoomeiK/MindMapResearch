bipolar,fde0v3z,t3_ekvjlq,1578328644.0,"That is truly wonderful; this kind of thing gives me hope for humanity.  No judgment, just love.  My hubby literally just did this for me too while I was in the middle of a serious panic attack.  I love him so goddamn much."
BipolarReddit,fclzzv1,t3_ehs0pf,1577760675.0,"No personal experience here, but from what I have been told by docs is that bipolar frequently *causes* risky behavior like drug use, lots of sex or (in my case) spending tons of money.  I’m surprised your doc didn’t mention that.  It’s all about putting together the symptoms and if you find treatments that ease them, then great."
bipolar,fckla0z,t3_ehedje,1577727794.0,"Wow, really really good!  So detailed!!  I hope you keep them coming."
