If I can offer anything more of substance, it would be this: remember that the business-as-usual types win when we're convinced we are alone in this. There are a lot more people aware of the problem than we think; there's still plenty of work to be done, yes, but it has come a long way even in the last year. Harp on that point. Show people that they are not alone when they choose to act. That kind of social proof goes a long way."

facepalm,fegyjwc,t1_fegt9f0,1579105383.0,"We can live in hellscapes with energy available to make clean water and grow enough food. If those systems break down - if there is no groundwater/it's toxic; if there is low oxygen levels; if there is no wood or coal or gas to burn; if there is no medical care to protect against illness; if there is nuclear fallout from a resource war; if large-scale nutrition is inadequate for entire populations - then simply living becomes exponentially more difficult than it has ever been in human history.

We may have the technology in theory, but how much would it cost to build a Mars base? How long would it take to be self-sufficient, with zero assistance from home? How many mistakes can we make along the way and still get back up?

Our timeline to fix the climate problem is short, and our margin for error is pretty thin. It will cost more money than any single endeavour ever has, and require more or less unilateral cooperation around the world. Given what we're seeing in international relations, that, to me, seems as unlikely as a Mars base, and just as hostile to prolonged existence in the next century."
facepalm,fegw13x,t1_fegrnzg,1579103797.0,"With the total collapse of ocean current and weather systems, food chains, growing seasons and pollination, and between the constant wildfires, droughts/floods/storms, ozone depletion (especially in the far north), and even air becoming more toxic to breathe (hydrogen sulfide and methane from clathrates, carbon dioxide concentrations leading to inhibited brain functioning, etc), it seems like a stretch though.

Yeah, some tens of thousands could straggle on, eking out a very difficult living. But it's entirely possible that extinction occurs. [Most species that have ever existed have gone extinct,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction#Causes) by a margin so large that it eclipses everything currently living. It is the norm, not the exception. There's little reason to think that, for all our technology right now, we can functionally restore the delicate balance of a planet-wide ecosystem that took millions of years to create, especially when we only have a decade or two (at most) to do it.

The Permian extinction, where 96% of species died, was [likely caused by volcanism](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction#gs.smbtqb) unleashing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and heating up/acidifying the oceans. At the rate we're going, it's completely possible for the oceans to go anoxic/acidic enough that phytoplankton, diatom, and marine plant growth either stops or is totally unpredictable from one season to the next - and then we literally have no oxygen to breathe, alongside everything else. It sounds impossible, but the cycle has happened many times before in geologic history.

The whole trouble with climate change being so hard to grasp is that it will make a world literally unlike any we've ever known. It wouldn't just be like the Middle Ages, it wouldn't just be a reversion to agrarian societies, it wouldn't just be a lack of large-scale civilization. It will fundamentally change the oceans, the air, the ground, the forests. If unchecked [it can literally make us less intelligent](https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/co2-on-the-brain-and-the-brain-on-co2/) and less able to solve the problem. It will break down the things we count on to survive.

Extinction may not be around the corner, but to say it's impossible is to deny billions of years of evidence that tells us otherwise. Now with that said, you mentioned technology that would allow survivability in those circumstances - what do you mean? Carbon scrubbers, desalinators, etc? To be viable, it needs to run without generating more carbon, be deployable on a large scale, and account for the conditions of 2100 and beyond, not the conditions of today.

Like I said, I would love if your assertion was correct. But from a removed viewpoint, I struggle with seeing how it could be."

Not that I'm disagreeing with you outright - I would actually prefer if you were correct - but can you tell me how you arrived at this conclusion?"
