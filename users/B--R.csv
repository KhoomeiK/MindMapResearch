AskReddit,fd3r2xt,t3_ejubhh,1578160989.0,"The story is kinda long, but put simply I had parents who did not really do a good job of encouraging me to appreciate US culture/society. If I had to guess, rather than admit their own faults they were more comfortable painting this incredibly negative picture of the US in my mind.

Later on I got introduced to Japanese culture and the contrast with the US appealed to me that it got me really interested in seeing what living in that kind of society is like. So I started to self-study the language with the intent to go there as an adult.

I was also taking Spanish & French in high school, so from those experiences I knew more about what does and does not work when it comes to me learning a language.

For Spanish we had the opportunity to do a 2-week home stay. Long story short, went to Costa Rica, loved my home-stay family, but really lost all interest in learning Spanish. The familial bond the home-stay family had amongst themselves left me questioning the bad image my parents had painted and decided I need to go study abroad for longer, and since I had already grown an appreciation for Japan and was self-studying the language, I decided to study abroad as a high school exchange student for a year.

After an ass-ton of paperwork, working part-time to save up money to go on the exchange, and various other matters, I went on the exchange.

Japan pretty much met my expectations in many ways, while also giving me the reality check I sought. The US wasn't a bad place, and more likely we were/are a family of assholes who refused to apologize for anything.

After the exchange I went back to try and maybe instill the same lessons I learned in Japan. Not because Japan is better, but because knowing when to accept fault or knowing when to apologize, while less often in the US than it is in Japan, is still a very important social skill that our family was completely missing.

Unfortunately, after 7 years of effort, my parents never did face that reality. They never did learn to stop making excuses and just fess up to mistakes and apologize. This kind of environment was incredibly toxic, and has fundamentally corrupted my perspective of the US in many ways that are not easy to fix, but in due time as I continue to meet more pleasant Americans does seem to be resolving itself extremely slowly and gradually.

The unfortunate thing is that if I maintain a relationship with my biological parents, their toxic mentality holds me back, undoes personal development I work really hard to achieve. The unfortunate thing is that in order for me to grow as a person, to pursue future success I had to cut ties with my biological parents.

Likewise, Japan... is just the country that took me in and nurtured me in a time of need when I was much younger. I feel indebted to that society as a result, and that's why I want to work there. That's why I put up with Japan's bullshit, that's why I spend an enormous effort to develop my Japanese linguistic abilities. That's why I want to live here (in Japan) indefinitely and plausibly change to Japanese citizenship (which requires getting rid of US citizenship).

I am still a rather substantial non-conformist in many aspects of my life despite living in an extremely conformist society, but being surrounded by that environment has an extremely positive impact on my growth as a person, it is frustrating, but it is a necessary frustration.

My opinion, has gotten more nuanced, but it really hasn't changed. It largely has been a rather positive opinion, just over time there are more negatives that I recognize that also are outweighed by more important positives.

For context: I don't (and might never) live in an urban area in Japan."

Gee, and people wonder why college graduates would rather consider strategic default or even suicide over paying back their student loans.

This guy faced a substantially smaller amount of debt and felt absolutely suffocated.

(Benji, this isn't directed at you, it's more directed at a non-specific unsympathetic audience to the student loan problem)"

japanlife,fcsvzqj,t3_einxdb,1577926518.0,"So... On one of the last few days of my International Business trip, I dropped my phone on a roller coaster, and was not able to recover it before coming back to Japan.

I feel bad for the people who wished me a happy new year on LINE but have not received a response from me yet.

I knew the moment I dropped it, this would prove to be a pain in the ass, but never-the-less want to bitch about it here.

Meanwhile, in typical fashion, whenever I have a day off so do all the bureaucrats I need to process paperwork (like for getting a new phone, converting my license, or getting paperwork relevant to that), and this pisses me off because a day off isn't supposed to be for pencil pushing elsewhere it's supposed to be for wasting my money on frivolous fun."

-Extremely high powered sound systems that literally make you FEEL the music, not just hear it.  

-A professional staff of sound quality engineers making it the best it can possibly be for that location.

-Additional entertaining skits

-More money goes to the actual artists, so you're supporting the actual people who make the music that goes on Spotify rather than supporting mega corporations.

The social benefits can vary wildly depending on what you make of it, but at the very least you are at least more likely to make friends or meet a special someone, so on so forth.

If not, just passively existing there and enjoying yourself will at least expose you to some pheromones which have their own benefits."

Well, the first time they do it, they'd probably get away with it purely from the ""I've watched over 1,000 soccer matches and that's the first time I've seen that"" look any ref is gonna give you.

From a rules perspective, the closest applicable rule would probably be dangerous play from the guy swinging the bottom of his (cleated) shoes around in a manner that the pointy bits are facing other players... or simply just being a danger to themselves if they don't have the requisite skill to pull it off.

If the guy screws up, and the ball rolls in a fashion that it makes contact with an arm. It'd definitely get called as a handball.

I could imagine someone who is overzealous might try to label this as unsporting behavior and give it a caution (yellow card).

In short, if you have enough skill and control and can keep your cleats away from other players by picking the right moment to do it, technically legal.

Pragmatically, I don't think there are many game situations where you could pull it off without it resulting in a foul or it just being completely useless and a waste of energy to do."
