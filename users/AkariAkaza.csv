???? It's so different in England

Before we even take the actual driving bit of the test you have to answer 50 questions about road laws / stopping distances etc and get at least 43 right AND watch hazard perception videos and identify a correct amount of hazards. This is known as your theory test, if you pass that you can then book your actual driving test

You then have to do 50 minutes of driving with the examiner, he'll ask you to follow directions as well as drive independently and reverse park in a bay and do a parallel park as well as how the car works by showing you know how to do things like use the wipers and the headlights.

 Anything like cutting someone off, not indicating or pulling out in front of someone are instant fails. As well as getting too many minors which are things like not checking your mirrors enough, hesitating too long at junctions, stalling the car, driving to close to someone etc, you can make 15 of these mistakes, 16 and you fail."
