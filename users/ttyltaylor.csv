GriefSupport,feivvri,t3_epaser,1579148634.0,"I know this feeling. I visited my dad in the icu for almost a month while he was on life support. Although at the time he was alive, it didn’t seem like it was him anymore. The feeling of helplessness is indescribable. Surround yourself with those who share your sorrow, don’t go through it alone. Don’t hold back your emotions. Feel what you need to feel to process this. As cliche as it sounds, you will be okay. Be there for the person  in need and breathe. Just breathe. You’ll be okay."

depression,fegtjhe,t3_eoxun3,1579102202.0,"I get it, being at this low point is like “well it can’t get any worse” and in a way it becomes your comfort zone. I myself really hate getting my hopes up. Being at a high point and then having that happiness taken away ends up hurting more than before it was introduced. Getting out of the comfort of this sunken feeling takes strength like no other."

GriefSupport,fe5u9wh,t3_env56w,1578875085.0,"Sorry for your loss 🖤 Maybe look at pictures, things they made, or item(s) that were special to them? It’ll remind you of the good times you shared with them. Also try talking to someone about how you’re feeling. Letting it out can help you process and will allow you to let go of anything you’ve had bottled up inside. If you need someone to talk to just shoot me a message!"

medical,fdn614d,t1_fdmo45r,1578578264.0,"They did a head scan 2 days ago and found a small bleed in the back of his brain which they’re monitoring now to see if they can control it with medication. They had plans to put in an LVAD heart pump but it’s now pretty much not an option because his ventricles are very weak. They just introduced the idea of an artificial heart. The cardiology team is supposed to meet today to see and discuss what they can do moving forward. 
It’s just hard to wrap my head around how quickly his condition deteriorated. Just a week before he was sent to the hospital, he was fine. He was active, doing construction on our house and going to work. Then it all just went downhill. 
Thanks for taking the time to respond tho! Much appreciated."
medical,fdmdx3r,t3_em4rw8,1578546759.0,Talk to your doctor first. Explain all your symptoms and they may refer you to a specialist. This may or may not be a more serious issue and it’s better to deal with it now rather than later.

depression,fctft1t,t3_eiqesj,1577941878.0,"Have you spoken with a psychiatrist before? I definitely recommend seeing one, they’re a great resource. I also think it’d be a good idea to keep a personal journal dedicated to your thoughts/feelings. This way you’re able to take your unfiltered feelings and dump them onto those pages. It’ll help ease the pain of built up emotions."
depression,fcteoyl,t3_eiqs8w,1577940871.0,"Life gets ugly, I know. You can’t fix everything in one day and that’s okay. Just take a step back and breathe. You’ll figure things out and find peace again, i promise.

depression,fctczej,t3_eikx42,1577939380.0,"You need to surround yourself with a different group of people. More importantly, learn to enjoy your own company. Putting yourself worth in the hands of those who don’t have your best interest is torture. People, especially friends/family shouldn’t make you feel this way. Maybe join clubs or something along those lines that would allow you to connect with people that share the same interests as you?"
depression,fctc7cd,t3_eiqv1p,1577938723.0,"You WILL be okay. Not right away, but let yourself heal and reset. What has happened to you, doesn’t define you.
