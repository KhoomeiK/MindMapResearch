dogs,ffckfcy,t1_ffc5uqn,1579801345.0,I’ve heard that kibble can help a little with plaque but I think of your dog gets dental chews and you brush his teeth regularly you don’t have to worry. My dog eats one home cooked meal and one kibble meal a day and his teeth are not horrible for a 10 year old dog.
dogs,ffc5opp,t3_esuaeu,1579792122.0,"My yorkiepoo does this sometimes too, he’s never choked on his food but if you’re concerned you could always soak his kibble in a little hot water so it’s soft and it can’t get stuck in his throat."

Advice,ff9p61b,t1_ff9cazd,1579717786.0,"Thank you for this answer, I think is very helpful. To my knowledge they aren’t directly funding any bad activities besides maybe drugs, which to me isn’t grounds to not go to a concert because most artists do drugs at some point"

She also got Erin and Andy a new computer and Daryl vacation days."
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff7bxak,t1_ff5hz3j,1579645928.0,"True, I feel for those girls and i’m very very grateful that I don’t have super heavy bleeding or killer cramps. But the way the commenter worded it threw me off because I interpreted as walking funny/ walking is painful when you’re on your period"
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff4v9p2,t3_eo0m63,1579573273.0,watch how you walk? tf i’ve never been concerned about how I walk on my period unless I know i’m bleeding through. Periods suck but it’s annoying when girls act like a martyr for having nearly the same experience of almost every female ever.

Best case scenario, you saved her life and worst case you can’t get another job in the medical field, so I think it’s worth it to be honest. Why protect some seedy guy and risk your friends health?"

HumansBeingBros,fe4jl5h,t1_fe31dkw,1578859993.0,"I was wondering the same thing, I keep seeing all these videos of people holding and watering koalas and kangaroos, but I thought kangaroos were dangerous? They have crazy long claws and could probably kick the shit out of you but I guess australians are braver than average since they live with the craziest animals in the world."

It’s good to confide in those you trust, but like you’ve noticed people can only take so much, they have their own problems too. Writing makes it easier to be more positive, especially if you wrote about good things and little victories as well as your hardships."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fc6pngz,t3_egi023,1577486315.0,"Hi, same boat here. Vegetarian and I suck at cooking. Mediterranean food has lots of vegetarian options and the hardest part about making it is chopping a bunch of veggies. Tell him to get the app mealime, it has so many recipes, you can enter dietary constrictions, it gives you a shopping list, and the recipes are easy to follow and lots of them can be made in 30 mins or less. It’s a lifesaver for helpless cooks like me."
