Maybe you should try reading your own link:

>On August 25, 2017, Federal Judge William Zloch, [dismissed the lawsuit](http://jampac.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/62-D.E.-62-Ord-of-Dismissal-8-25-17.pdf) after several months of litigation during which [DNC](http://observer.com/2017/04/shattered-bernie-sanders-supporters-convention-protests/) attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to select their own candidate. “In evaluating Plaintiffs’ claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are true—that the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent,” the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated. ***This assumption of a plaintiff’s allegation is the general legal standard in the motion to dismiss stage of any lawsuit. The allegations contained in the complaint must be taken as true unless they are merely conclusory allegations or are invalid on their face.***

That is a legalese way of the court saying: ""Let's assume for the sake of argument that the plaintiff's claims are true, that the DNC did rig the primaries.  Do the plaintiff's claims have merit even given that?""

And the answer was no.  That was not by any stretch of the imagination the court saying ""Yes,  the DNC actually did rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders.""

So don't go around making claims that a court said something it didn't actually say.

[**Florida Man reportedly admitted impeachment played a big role in his Soleimani decision**](https://theweek.com/speedreads/888686/trump-reportedly-admitted-impeachment-played-big-role-soleimani-decision) 

*Florida Man's decision to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani reportedly had some self-serving underpinnings.*

The assassination and subsequent conflict with Iran has pushed Florida Man's looming impeachment trial out of the headlines and gathered him [strong support](https://theweek.com/speedreads/887629/republican-democratic-senators-offer-clashing-views-iran-tensions) from some [GOP senators](https://theweek.com/speedreads/887312/why-only-few-lawmakers-are-calling-soleimanis-killing-assassination) who've criticized him in the past.

Lawmakers on [both sides](https://theweek.com/speedreads/887452/adam-schiff-says-still-hasnt-gotten-adequate-answer-about-why-trump-authorized-soleimani-strike-now) of [the aisle](https://theweek.com/speedreads/888426/gop-sen-mike-lee-ridicules-trump-administrations-insulting-soleimani-briefing-backs-democrats-war-powers-resolution) have questioned just what intelligence went into the decision to kill Soleimani, and especially why it had to happen when it did. The administration has so far only mentioned some sort of ""imminent threat"" as justification. But ""after the strike,"" Florida Man gave associates another explanation: ""He was under pressure to deal with Gen. Soleimani from GOP senators he views as important supporters in his coming impeachment trial in the Senate,"" the *Journal* writes.

Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, gave an explicit answer that also tosses out any suggestion of an imminent threat: ""When one American life was lost at the hands of Iranian-backed militias just a few short weeks ago, Florida Man launched the first air strikes against Iranian-backed militias in 10 years.""

**We compared 56 years of corruption in Republican and Democratic presidencies: both sides are not equally corrupt.**

We compared 28 years each of Democratic and Republican administrations, 1961-2016, five Presidents from each party. During that period Republicans scored eighteen times more individuals and entities indicted, thirty-eight times more convictions, and thirty-nine times more individuals who had prison time. \[snip\]

**Confirming The Numbers – Who Was Counted And Why**

Sources for total indictments, convictions, and prison sentences often do not agree. This analysis has referred to investigators’ final reports, contemporary reporting, some obituaries, and later articles. The final reports of investigations were essential. Even the final reports, however as noted below, left questions.

One approach to comparing malfeasance by administration might be to include only positions designated in 28 USC § 591. [This section of the US Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title28/pdf/USCODE-2015-title28-partII-chap40-sec591.pdf) lists government officers who are the direct concern of an independent counsel – starting with the President and Vice President. We use broader criteria. Other lists likewise don’t appear to use this act as their basis for comparison. Further, 28 USC 591 is applicable to the Independent Counsel Law, but not to other special prosecutor or special counsel investigations.

Some sources report 76 Watergate indictments, 55 convictions, and 15 served time. One source had 69 Watergate indictments of government figures. There is no path to that many “government” figures indicted. We report 26 government and former government figures. We find (Figure 1) a total of 85 Nixon administration indictments, 78 convictions, and 24 with prison time. Figure 4 lists them. Some sources list two indictments for Clinton administration officers. However, we “assign” to the Clinton administration 5 indictments, counting his impeachment as an indictment, and involving the Departments of Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Other lists show no Obama administration indictees. We include one, General David Petraeus. (*who was, by the way, a Republican*) \[snip\]"

>We compared 56 years of corruption in Republican and Democratic presidencies: both sides are not equally corrupt.  
>  
>We compared 28 years each of Democratic and Republican administrations, 1961-2016, five Presidents from each party. During that period Republicans scored eighteen times more individuals and entities indicted, thirty-eight times more convictions, and thirty-nine times more individuals who had prison time.  \[snip\]

>**Confirming The Numbers – Who Was Counted And Why**

>Sources for total indictments, convictions, and prison sentences often do not agree. This analysis has referred to investigators’ final reports, contemporary reporting, some obituaries, and later articles. The final reports of investigations were essential. Even the final reports, however as noted below, left questions.  
>  
>One approach to comparing malfeasance by administration might be to include only positions designated in 28 USC § 591. [This section of the US Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title28/pdf/USCODE-2015-title28-partII-chap40-sec591.pdf) lists government officers who are the direct concern of an independent counsel – starting with the President and Vice President. We use broader criteria. Other lists likewise don’t appear to use this act as their basis for comparison. Further, 28 USC 591 is applicable to the Independent Counsel Law, but not to other special prosecutor or special counsel investigations.

>Some sources report 76 Watergate indictments, 55 convictions, and 15 served time. One source had 69 Watergate indictments of government figures. There is no path to that many “government” figures indicted. We report 26 government and former government figures. We find (Figure 1) total 85 Nixon administration indictments, 78 convictions, and 24 with prison time. Figure 4 lists them. Some sources list two indictments for Clinton administration officers. However, we “assign” to the Clinton administration 5 indictments, counting his impeachment as an indictment, and involving the Departments of Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Other lists show no Obama administration indictees. We include one, General David Petraeus. (who was, by the way,  a Republican) \[snip\]

>\[I\]n April 1969, mere months into the first Nixon Administration, Nixon’s internationalist savvy was still unproven. That’s when North Korea shot down an EC-121 spy plane over the Sea of Japan. Nixon was furious.  
>  
>A [July 2010 story on NPR](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128337461) featured remarks from Bruce Charles, an Air Force pilot based in Kunsan, South Korea at the time. He recalled being put on alert to carry out his part of the SIOP, the Single Integrated Operational Plan – the U.S. nuclear strike plan for war with the Communists.  
>  
>Charles was put on alert to drop a 330-kiloton nuke on a North Korean airstrip. \[snip\]

>  
>George Carver, a CIA Vietnam specialist at the time of the EC-121 shootdown, is reported to have said that Nixon became “incensed” when he found out about the EC-121. The President got on the phone with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ordered plans for a tactical nuclear strike and recommendations for targets.  
>  
>Henry Kissinger, National Security Advisor for Nixon at the time, also got on the phone to the Joint Chiefs and got them to agree to stand down on that order until Nixon woke up sober the next morning.  
>  
>According to [Summers and Swan’s book “The Arrogance Of Power: The Secret World Of Richard Nixon,”](https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,362958,00.html) Kissinger is reported to have told aides on multiple occasions that if the President had his way, there would have been a new nuclear war every week.
