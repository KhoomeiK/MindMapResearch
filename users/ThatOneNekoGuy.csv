It's better to bring up how to do it properly for the ones that are going to do it anyway, than to just pretend it doesn't exist. It's the same concept as teaching kids about condoms in health class."

TalesFromRetail,ff0eq8y,t1_ff04blf,1579468205.0,"I agree for the most part, but I'd say that failure to *attempt to return it is theft; success is irrelevant. If you find a twenty on the ground, and there's no way to tell who it belonged to, you've just got a twenty now. If it was in a wallet, or you saw the person drop it, that's a different story. But if you do legitimately try and fail to find the owner, it's not theft."
