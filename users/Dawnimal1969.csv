orangetheory,ff7ju6t,t3_eryb7i,1579651244.0,I hated them when I went to a studio that had them (my studio hadn‚Äôt gotten them yet). But I honestly got used to them quickly and now I don‚Äôt notice them. Plus I like not having to look at the big screens for my info.
orangetheory,ff6kkt6,t3_erut2k,1579629190.0,"I love power walking. Freaking love it. And I‚Äôm proud. My two cents; go online and watch speed walking videos. There is a specific way your body moves to gain speed. It‚Äôs very hard to walk in a normal gait and get really fast. You end up leaning forward at the hips and swinging the arms more. Speed walkers are very tight in their form. The hips roll, arms tight at sides at a right angle. Will you look funny? Yeah. Will you potentially smoke a jogger next to you while you‚Äôre walking at an 8 incline? Yup.  As an aside, things change with a higher incline; like at 12+. By then you are more trudging, leaning forward, swinging arms. No one speed walks up a mountain. Use that type of incline to slow down in speed but gain strength in the legs."
orangetheory,ff6jspx,t3_ervw4a,1579628710.0,"Hip flexibility is also REALLY important. If your hips are too tight you won‚Äôt be able to properly engage the glutes for optimum contraction. This was a game changer for me as my hips have always been incredibly tight. 

And if you can walk on inclines your lower body will really change. I walk almost exclusively now. No change in calories or splat points but my legs and butt are finally showing signs of change. As a 50 year old who has never worn shorts in her life, this is really exciting."

Menopause,ferygut,t1_fervgto,1579359616.0,"How do your clothes feel? Bc if you‚Äôre putting on muscle your scale is going to show a ‚Äúgain‚Äù (since muscle is more dense than fat) but it‚Äôs the type of gain you want. I weigh ten pounds more since I started lifting weights but my clothes are the same size or smaller. 

I do low-carb and intermittent fasting and lift heavy weights. That has changed my body and my state of mind. I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life and I feel healthy. I don‚Äôt believe we have to suffer and shit has to fall apart. I have the hot flashes, night sweats, insta-rage, bursting into tears in the car, waking up at 1:30am, but it‚Äôs not overwhelming. I think there is a body of evidence that can help guide us towards better lives n this stage but you (the general ‚Äúyou‚Äù) have to make changes.

SkincareAddiction,fejp6da,t1_fej7ri7,1579182225.0,"That‚Äôs so frustrating. I remember. I wouldn‚Äôt leave the house it effected me so much. I was prescribed it probably 20 years ago now. No idea what strength; I just used what they gave me. It was the only thing that worked for me. I was allergic to everything else and would get painful hives and welts with benzoyl peroxide and stridex.... and that‚Äôs literally all there was. That and Ivory soap. It was not at all like the choices and treatments today. 

It was originally prescribed for my cystic acne. That‚Äôs no longer an issue but I just started using it for my cc and it‚Äôs working. I guess it‚Äôs just a thing my skin responds to. I really hope everyone finds what works for them. 

Finally, an unpopular opinion on this sub....  Diet. I stopped eating sugar (and many carbs) and anything with sugar in it and my skin has been transformed. Again, my experience, but we cannot neglect this. Our skin is our largest organ and humans were not designed to eat processed sugar. Sadly it tastes sooooo freaking good. But healthy skin feels nice, too."

What I have read is that the body will deplete fat stores before muscle;; bc our bodies are super smart and back in the day if we easily lost muscle we‚Äôd be eaten by some predator. So, essentially, you would have to lose a ton of fat before the body would start depleting muscle stores. My guess is that maybe you worked out too much. Weight lifting requires rest as much as stress. Read a very interesting article about longer rest periods between lifting sessions resulting in bigger muscle mass gains."
