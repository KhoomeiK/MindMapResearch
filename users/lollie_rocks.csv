dogpictures,fdad6mf,t3_ekdfkw,1578244728.0,"God Bless your sweet baby, and please know, you were LOVED so much by your baby. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. My girl was taken in to be laid to rest June 6, 2019 and my heart is super raw, especially around this time of year. Hagen came home to me on December 23rd 2009 as an 8 week old love muffin. This is my first Christmas without her. I still feel guilty for taking her in, even though it was time, it seemed like she had this crazy spurt of puppy energy and I was second guessing myself. She had cancer surgery April 2018, it came back and she had trouble walking and urinating. My heart is so bruised, My face is leaking as I write to you. I think  ‚Äúwe‚Äù folks, who‚Äôve had the privilege to love, care for and share a life with our fur babies, can truly heal one another by sharing our memories and stories and photos of our family members, especially our animal ones. Those still here with us and those that have crossed over to Eternal rest..."
DobermanPinscher,fcxmqv9,t1_fcvn85p,1578066650.0,"It is...These majestic beautiful babies, changed my life. Dobermans are a very special breed. Mama came to me as a 8 week old stinky little pup, as I was a veterinary receptionist in Houston, Texas. She came home with me December 23, 2009! I love her, still and always, so very much. My heart is certainly broken and I don‚Äôt know that it will ever heal. Her pup Hazmat was born in November of 2015. A SMART cute little guy, who quickly became much bigger than Mama. The loss is overwhelming to say the least. Hazmat passed unexpectedly and Hagen and I mourned for months and I still do. Hagen passed after a second bout with Cancer in June. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve slept or have been able to move forward since. They were my WORLD."

secretsanta,fc0g0kq,t1_fbzl6jg,1577289973.0,"Good morning and Merry Christmas üéÑ Thank you from the bottom of my ‚ù§Ô∏è. My Uncle Ron, my mother‚Äôs brother, also my godfather gave/instilled in me the love of dogs, when I was a little girl, say around 8 years of age. He had a lab mix named, Polly. I adored Polly. She was such a lovie girl. My Uncle used to take Polly on outings often to the aqueduct to walk/run the paths, parks, schoolyard to play ball, and camping. My Uncle is a Live Combat Vietnam Veteran and they even adopted a dog after Persian Gulf Wars w/ Iraq. A lot of service women and men befriend local dogs overseas as a source of comfort while they are dealing w/ the daily efforts of war, important stuff, like staying alive, missing their families, etc. After, the war is over there were a few soldiers who wanted to bring those companions home. A lady became an advocate and somehow started facilitating this endeavor. She also knew that a lot of these dogs would just die after the soldiers left, because it literally was the soldiers that cared for and fed the dogs. So, it opened up the adoption process even further. So my Uncle Ron and Aunt Sue decided to adopt as well. I was living in Texas at the time with my sweet boy, Hugo, a St. Bernard mix, I adopted from a no kill shelter in St. Louis and my wee little Hagen, who was like 4 months old then. (I don't think I was in Texas, likely Missouri, pre-Hagen, that timeline didn't add up after I re-read it, WELL, anywho...) My Uncle called from California to explain what they were doing and share the good news of the adoption with me. It wasn‚Äôt but a week or two after that she, Sandy, our newest family member was being flown into Oakland International Airport, in the East San Francisco Bay to be greeted by my Uncle and his family. Just a really wonderful story I wanted to share with you. So, since I was a little girl I have loved loved loved doggies. That has split over into my adulthood. I‚Äôve taken my dogs running on the beaches of Texas and Florida, to the lakes in Missouri, camping, shopping, running in schoolyards on the weekends, to the woods, everywhere with me, by my side. My adult children, who both live out-of-state, now carry the love of dogs with their families and have had some of the same journeys with their pets as I have had with mine. So, the pain is REAL with the loss of both Hazmat and Hagen. The were so intertwined in every aspect of my daily life, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. I am so very sorry for the loss of your sweet baby, I get it, I understand, really I do. Maybe I don‚Äôt feel exactly what your heart feels, but I understand that special bond between a fur baby and the loss is stifling. May you find some peace this beautiful Christmas morning in knowing I am here and you are loved and supported in your grief and mourning. God Bless You, May God Bless you and Keep you, may his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you. Your friend ALWAYS, Lollie XoxoXo"

Just like with me, there is nothing, absolutely nothing that can stop my heart from hurting. This was something that I did look forward to, it gave me a reason to get out of the house and do a little shopping  - a scavenger hunt, if you will. I also had this something to look forward to in between the tears over my fur babies. It is unconscionable that folks would purposely do these things to one another, no less at Christmas.

I also got the most marvelous post from my recipient, so I know I did my part. I am now aware that this time of year, for many may not always be uplifting but a time of great stress and challenges for various reasons. Mostly, loss and health. I will take this as a lesson in life, a reminder, that GIVING and LOVE will always WIN, even in the midst of trials. I look forward to those calm and bright days you spoke of. Merry Christmas!"
