WomensHealth,fem3ne8,t3_epplak,1579238669.0,"Pros: They‚Äôre so comfortable, I forget I have it in. Cheap, going strong on 3 years now. Environmentally sustainable. Super easy to throw in my hand bag or pocket in its little carry case. Less changing is required than pass or tampons, I change mine in the morning when I wake up, and at night before bed, so I can do so in the comfort of my own home. On the rare occasion I‚Äôve changed it out/at work it‚Äôs been very easy. The best bit though is no dry-tampon removal feeling on the last day, removing a dry cup is no issue at all, it doesn‚Äôt soak up anything. 

Cons: they can take a few goes to get used to placement. My first time I thought I‚Äôd got it stuck and had a serious moment where I considered if my housemate and I were close enough to ask for help. My advice for newbies is: Don‚Äôt panic, it‚Äôs not stuck, you just need to relax. Lying down can help. Also, if you‚Äôre squeamish, getting used to being that acquainted with your own bodily fluids can be confronting, but I‚Äôm now all for it. It‚Äôs good to know what your body is doing.

I‚Äôm only 3 weeks in at this point, and I‚Äôve certainly not been perfect, but I‚Äôm making progress. And you can too! 

My top tips for starting again are to reflect on what worked for you last time, what were the things that made you successful? Focus on recreating those. For me that was meal prepping, and listening to a motivational podcast while I get ready in the morning. I dug out all my old saved links, and recipes I loved while doing keto and started with those. Then just start, don‚Äôt wait for Monday, or until you have a perfect plan, just get into it from your next meal!
