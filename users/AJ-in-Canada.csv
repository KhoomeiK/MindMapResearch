Then I'll continue with what I'm doing. If he gets really bad (hitting me or the dog, throwing toys) I tell him that's not ok and give him a time out on his bedroom. (This is the point where it's really hard for me to not tell at him so I do something to calm myself down while he's in a time out). 

Recently I've been offering to help him dance it out and it seems to work really well. (except he says he's still mad at the end so we don't stop...) We jump around in circles singing some silly lyrics about being mad or sad and why."

I don't have first hand experience with that specific type of cancer, our dog had a different type that we didn't catch until he was bleeding internally so we didn't have to make that decision. From his experience, his quality of life seemed good & normal right up until the last 2 days."

The only thing that calmed him was being in our bed. 

Our doctor had already ok'd blankets and the crib mattress had a softer side for over 12 months so I didn't realize that cosleeping after a year was considered a problem. 

He survived it with no scares or anything but is still sleeping in our bed at 2.5 and we can't get him in his own bed or asleep in ours without us...."

askwomenadvice,feoqnr4,t3_eq5wun,1579304088.0,"From the way you write this it sounds like your gf is using you. Maybe I'm missing something but does she give anything in the relationship? When you say ""we decided/we know"" does that apply to both of you or are you going along with what she decided? 

Don't get me wrong, it is definitely the right thing to do to respect her boundaries and not push something physical or emotional that she's not ready for. But talking about your needs and wants (physical, emotional, etc) is absolutely fine and part of a healthy relationship too. Talking in a healthy and non-demanding way is not the same as pressuring your partner. 
 
This part is just my opinion, but aside from a few specific circumstances responsible adults don't quit their job and walk out on the spot. It happens, people have tempers but a grown woman with a child to provide for shouldn't be throwing her job away without a backup plan. And at this stage in your relationship I really don't think it's fair for you to be the backup plan."

Now she's a year and can regulate her own sleep fairly well. If she still has energy when our bedtime is coming up she runs up and down the stairs & hallway chasing her toy until for like 5 min or so and then goes to sleep.

I'm wondering about the things you mentioned. Do your friends block his driveway? Are your late night parties loud, do your friends make a lot of noise when leaving? How long are your garbage cans out? Are they close to where he drives? Is your grass super long and an eyesore?

It's possible he's just a busybody. But it's also possible that your parties wake him up and he looks out the window to see what's happening. I've had a neighbour use a smoker all day and at the time I could tell you about how long it'd been on for because the smoke stunk and I couldn't open the windows. 

I can tell you which neighbours leave their cans out all week because I drive down the street and see them. It's not on purpose, but when you see the same things every day or week you do notice similarities. 

When the same neighbour is doing all those things then you do tend to notice when they do something else that bugs you. 

I think that he probably shouldn't have mentioned so many things to you, part of being a good neighbour is letting some things go. But part of being a good neighbour is being courteous of how your actions affect everyone else, and I'm not sure that you're doing that."

My husband had been with a few women before we got together, that didn't bother me but I also wouldn't have minded if I was his first. After 10 years of marriage I can tell you we're both a lot better at sex than we were when we first started dating so I don't think having experience with lots of people matters as much as learning your partner's body and communicating what you like. 

I think that being a virgin (or not) is nothing to be ashamed about. If I was still dating I'd be curious and want to know the reason behind the virginity. Is it because he was focused on his career and didn't have time for dating? Religious background? Shyness? Does he think he's too good for anyone who isn't a perfect 10? Insecurity? Etc etc. Some of those issues would be a potential problem in a relationship, some might be things that he's gotten past, some might be non issues. Same as they would be for a virgin woman.

 If the guy happens to be a virgin because he just hadn't met the right woman yet then no big deal. If he's the type to get jealous because his girlfriend had more partners than him, or decide he missed out on having a slutty phase and ask for a hall pass that's a real issue. However I think that's a personality issue, not a virginity issue.

I'd offer to pick up coffee for anyone I was hanging out with if I was going to be showing up with a cup of coffee. (obvious exceptions of going to a party with a ton of people or something)

I think maybe it's time for a serious talk about what you need in the relationship and see if he's open to making some changes. You're not asking him to change who he is, just to be thoughtful of his girlfriend.

Edit because I saw your edit. I think giving him ideas of how he could make you feel loved is reasonable. It's a learning process in a relationship and expecting your partner to read your mind is likely to lead to failure. I've been married for like 10 years and my husband just learned this year that when I buy him a chocolate bar when I'm grocery shopping it's one of my ways of saying I love him/care about him. Turns out to him it's just yummy food that doesn't mean anything else. 

So if your boyfriend was actually taking your suggestions then I'd say that's a good thing. But it seems like he takes your suggestions and finds reasons why they don't work for him so that's a whole different story."

""We're screwing over our support system to appease selfish family members we'll see maybe two weeks a year. We planned the entire wedding so they could make it and they're using their presence as a power move to change the wedding so they can get so drunk and sloppy that they'd be ashamed for children to see them""

How could that go wrong? 

You definitely owe your sister an apology for being such a jerk. She's very gracious for just backing out of your wedding without making a fuss."
toddlers,fcv5nng,t3_ej0sne,1577995154.0,"It's up to you obviously but my son was on formula through bottles and it was a total nightmare trying to get him to drop them. I finally did cold turkey at around 20 months because he was using his bottles as a substitute for meals. We gave cow's milk in a cup during the day and a toddler water bottle at night. 

They're not really supposed to be using a bottle for milk/formula after about a year anyway because of mouth development and the milk against their teeth at night causes tooth decay. 

No judgment from me, I definitely kept the bottles longer than I should have because I was worried my preemie wasn't getting enough nutrition otherwise but I just wanted to share some of the struggles I had getting rid of bottles so you can decide what works best for you."

To clarify, did your sister ask you to only speak English? 

Also does her child have speech issues? Babbling a three word sentence seems a bit delayed for 4 years unless they're speaking a lot more in English and just starting to pick up your native language now. 

I think it can only be a benefit for an average child to speak more than one language. But I also think that you have to respect someone else's parenting (even if you think it's dumb) unless they're being abusive or something that will cause actual harm to their child. (Especially when the child is so young - a teenager asking to learn a language has the right to decide for themself)

 So you could potentially be TA if you went behind your sister's back."

Alternatively you can pack a ziplock bag with an emergency diaper & wipes to keep either in your purse or your car. It won't have a changing pad like the clutch but it's cheaper and smaller. 

Your baby has already forgotten about it and soon it'll just be a funny story to you. :-)"

I don't understand why the first shower interfered with your birthday. Were you upset that your sister was driving on your birthday because she wasn't with you during it? Would she have driven over the day before your birthday for your party if her shower wasn't the next day?   
**Edit- I re-read and realized you were driving to your sister, not her to you. I think in that situation it's ok to be disappointed, I wonder why she planned it that weekend instead of the one before or after.**

~~I'm leaning towards Y T A because a shower the day after your birthday doesn't seem like a big deal but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.~~

 A baby born 3 months early is a big deal as far as complications go. Your sister is (was?) probably thinking about cerebral palsy and lung development and wondering if it'll be weeks or months or ever before her baby comes home. You're 15, you likely aren't being told about the charts you get that tell you the percentage chance that the baby will be blind, deaf, or with various other disabilities. I'm really sorry that your siblings didn't think to get you presents or acknowledge your birthday, they should have. But I really don't think that your sister is the asshole for this one. I'm not Catholic but is it possible they had religious reasons for wanting to move the shower up and do it in the church? (Maybe praying for the baby or some kind of ceremony like that?) I don't think they needed clothes to wear in the NICU so I doubt the shower was purposely moved to your birthday so they could get presents sooner.

I think the closest I can come to is NAH. I understand why you're disappointed but I also can see why your sisters might not be thinking of your birthday since it isn't as big of a deal when you're older. They might have thought you'd be having a party with your friends?"

 I think it's weird (if the brother is an actual certified mechanic) that the brother thinks guys should all be able to work on their own vehicle. My husband is a mechanic and the 'handy' people often are the ones who make a huge mess and tow the car for the shop to fix.
