loseit,ffd8gxh,t3_eszbba,1579815468.0,Where are you taking the measurements? It's likely that you've just lost weight in areas you aren't measuring or you haven't lost enough in the areas you are measuring to see yet.
loseit,ffcksq0,t3_esum5a,1579801573.0,"MFP isn't a fortune teller. It's just predicting you'll lose to 125 over and over because you're small and you TDEE is low. It's basically predicting slow weight loss for you. As you lose more and progress it will eventually get to predicting 124lbs in 5 weeks. The MFP prediction is fun, but it isn't really that accurate. MFP always calculated that my TDEE was lower than it really is, so it would predict slower weight loss for me than I actually saw in real life. If you're eating under your TDEE then you will continue to lose weight. But sometimes as you get smaller that weight loss will be like half a pound or a quarter of a pound a week. It's still progress that will get you to your goal eventually."
loseit,ffbcbz4,t1_ffb7uhx,1579759435.0,"Rotisserie chicken have a pretty strong flavor to me, like the skin is delicious and every grocery store I've eaten from clearly seasons it. It isn't plain. It's not the same as if you bought raw chicken breasts and roasted them in your oven with no oil, salt, or seasoning. Restaurants also usually season their baked chicken and put a bit of oil on it. For rice, I always boil it in salted water, and I also often eat it with a seasoned meat, sauted vegetables, or something with sauce so I can mingle the flavors together. Like salted rice with curry or with pot roast. Microwave rice is often seasoned, or even the plain kinds will have oil in them.

Almost any roasted thing you get at a restaurant will have some oil in it, just like when you're roasting at home you'll usually use a little oil to help it brown. A lot of restaurants will have steamed vegetables (usually broccoli) that are usually pretty plain and unoiled though.

I think your post comes off like you think low calorie foods have to be plain and you can't eat oil, but most of us do eat seasoned foods cooked with some cooking oil. Like, I think Moe's has a really great menu for weight loss meals because you can get low calorie vegetables in a bowl, salsa's super low calorie, but I do always include stuff that is cooked in oil like onions and peppers. Those things don't make the bowl less nutritious or much higher in calories. Or a fast food grilled chicken sandwich can be a tasty, fast meal that might be 400-500 calories."
fatlogic,ffanf9r,t3_eskcqk,1579740047.0,"Honestly, the last woman probably doesn't care how much space the author takes up. She just called her a ""fat bitch"" because it's a cheap, obvious insult to fling at a stranger. Some people are rude and inconsiderate of others. It's not all a size-related issue."
loseit,fett9jl,t3_eql37i,1579379809.0,"Do you use a food scale to count your calories? Are you counting everything including oil/butter, drinks, cream in coffee, sauces, and condiments? Are there days where you stop counting calories or you don't count certain things? You should be able to lose weight on 1200 calories a day, so it's possible that you could make some tweaks to help you feel more satisfied and enjoy the food you're eating. 

Being mean to yourself and punishing yourself for eating isn't helpful. It just makes weight loss a miserable process that you'll want to avoid by binging and going off your diet. If you're binging still, then you could be cancelling out your deficit. Eating a very small amount then binging is a binge-restrict cycle that won't really get you making progress. Maybe you could try eating at maintenance or at least a higher amount like 1500 calories and really get good at counting the calories accurately. Even when you binge or overeat, count the calories as best you can.

I enjoyed the foods I ate as I lost weight. I looked forward to eating certain meals. I could have fun with food and also fit it into my calorie goals. Feeling negative and miserable doesn't burn calories. Try making some tasty low calorie recipes like stir fries, soup, burrito bowls, fajitas, roasted meat with vegetables, and stuff. Learn to season things in a way you enjoy."
loseit,fetr3w6,t3_eqla51,1579378662.0,"I don't really mind posts about specific restaurants. It can be helpful for people who go to that restaurant, and those types of post are relatively rare anyway. It seems like it would be hard for mods to distinguish between a normal person who's just enthusiastic about a product/brand versus a company-sponsored fake post, so I do prefer that they leave up posts that give helpful, truthful information. There was a post a while ago on 1200isplenty from a Starbucks barista recommending things to order, and it was helpful in giving people ideas on how to cut calories. There's always been bad advice and pseudoscience shared on this sub, so discernment has always been nessessary."
loseit,fetmihs,t1_fetiuxm,1579376865.0,"Yeah, I was hoping you'd get some replies from people with experience, but you're right that there's more stories of people getting it after weight loss. For what it's worth, my breasts changed a lot as I lost weight, so I would be hesitant to get the implants before just because you might not know how they'll look proportionately after the weight loss. I can understand the insurance incentive though since they're expensive. It sounds like a hard decision since there are pros and cons to each side, so I hope whatever you decide turns out good for you. Sorry I can't be more helpful."
loseit,feqeke4,t3_eqa1hm,1579340923.0,"Be careful with the smoothies because it's very easy to make a high calorie smoothie since you can put a lot of food in it and it won't nessessarily be as filling as just eating those foods. Stuff like peanut butter, nuts, and seeds are pretty high calorie so also be moderate with those. I think calorie counting can help you see where you might be consuming too much of something. For example, I use to cook with a lot of olive oil without realizing that it is 120 calories per tablespoon.

Cutting out sugary or caloric drinks like juices, soda, alcohol, milk, and flavored/sweetened/milky coffee can be a really good first step because it's easy to get a lot of calories from those without really feeling satisfied. Low calorie alternatives like sparkling water, zero calorie energy drinks, and diet soda have been helpful for me in getting rid of most of my liquid calories, though do still put half and half in my coffee.

For fast food like Subway I usually just look at the calories online and make decisions based on that. Like, at subway specifically I might get a sandwich with lower calorie toppings/condiments, diet soda or water, and no chips. I think you can also get salad there."
loseit,feq401k,t3_eqcopz,1579337381.0,"People might have personal stories about this to share, but I think you should also ask your doctor. He might have knowledge or even experience with how weight loss would affect them."

aww,femcdhb,t1_felt24l,1579248393.0,"I agree that this sounds aggressive like Zelda is defending the litter box. Sometimes cats will go to the bathroom outside the litter box if using it causes stress and confrontation. Being in the litterbox is a vulnerable position, and your litter box only has one exit so your older cat is forced to step out and be ambushed by Zelda, who is above her. Not all chasing is playful.

I've read people suggest having 1 litter box per cat plus one extra. Personally I just have one per cat (3 cats, 3 litter boxes). We started out with just one litter box, but one of our cats would hover around and chase the other cat when he used it. Getting another litter box really helped with this behavior."

For me, it wasn't really hard to fit those things into my deficit. I could eat them and still feel full and satisfied throughout the day as long as I was also eating a couple reasonable meals. I didn't want to cut anything from my diet because I know that I'm not going to live the rest of my life without eating junk food and sweets.

loseit,fe6eee9,t3_ensog8,1578888440.0,"Personally, I eat a dessert almost every day and I have through my whole weight loss. I don't see anything wrong with either store bought or homemade sweets. I live with people who keep sweets in the house, so it wasn't an option for me to eliminate them from my diet. But I think practicing eating them in moderation has been helpful. Instead of eating 4-5 cookies, I can eat 1-2 cookies and savor them. I like to think of sweets as being a tasty flavor, but not something I should eat when I'm feeling hungry because there are more satisfying, substantial snacks that would be better. I usually eat store bought sweets because I find it easier than baking them myself and I usually enjoy making savory things more than sweets. But homemade certainly can be better if you want that kind of control or you want to eat healthier versions of recipes."
loseit,fe6d6od,t3_enutt6,1578887472.0,"I think Cronometer is a better calorie counting app than MFP, especially for cooking. It usually has listings for things in cups/ounces, but it also has almost everything listed in grams so if you have a food scale it's easy to just use one measurement for everything. Like, you just type in the number of grams to log things, it's wonderful. I spend a year using MFP, and when I swapped to Cronometer it was a time saver. It is also a more controlled database because employees approve all the entries, as oppose to MFP where anyone can make an entry. A lot of the foods listings for basic things like meat, oil, vegetables, fruits, beans, and grains are from verified food databases.

As far as your brand of carrots, if it's something like a vegetable, fruit, or plain rice I wouldn't use the package information. I would just use a generic entry. Even in MFP, there are USDA entries that give the calories for 100g of the food. If I'm trying to verify the entry, then I use the USDA database ([link](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).

As far as actually logging the recipes, I don't log dry spices or herbs at all. They're so few calories that I don't see a point. For things that are under 15 calories like garlic, ginger, sriracha, mustard, and smaller amounts of soy sauce I just estimate what I use. Without the spices and low calorie stuff, it's a lot easier to log everything else. Then everything else I weigh out as I'm setting up to cook. It's easier to log things with a food scale because you can just have a bowl that you're putting stuff into. You can also weigh condiments by putting the bottle on the food scale, zeroing the scale, pour some out into the pan/bowl, then putting the container back on the scale to find the difference. I do this for stuff like oil, sauces, peanut butter, and jelly.

I also think it's easier to write out the measurements in a notebook sometimes instead of trying to log it in your phone as you're cooking. I had a little kitchen notebook, and I would just list my ingredients and the weights as I set up. There was usually a slow point in the cooking where things were baking/simmering/resting where I could deal with finding things in the app.

It gets easier as you build up recipes, because then you can just reuse them. If I have a similar recipe in the system that I made before, then I'll just use that as a template for my new recipe. Like I don't have a set fried rice recipe, but I use a lot of the same ingredients each time so I'll just find an old time that I made fried rice and I'll edit the amounts for the new fried rice I'm making. That's faster than creating a whole new recipe."
loseit,fdq5oaz,t3_emc9qn,1578655971.0,"If you like to eat sweets, then make it part of your calories and tracking. I ate a dessert everyday as I was losing weight, and I would set aside calories for that. Also, try pretracking foods before you cook them (enter the calories into your apps recipe maker or just enter each ingredient for something like the mug cake). Most baked goods freeze well, so you can freeze things like muffins or cake in single serving portions."

I would feel excited to be eating something like chicken fajitas or stuffed bell peppers for supper. Also, I agree with people saying to delete the apps."
loseit,fdq2waj,t3_emkhhd,1578652208.0,"I calorie counted and entered my recipes / foods into the app to see what the calories where. I like the calorie counting app Cronometer. I could make small changes that decreased the calories in my meals while keeping the flavor the same or similar. One thing was using less cooking oil in my food. I use to just pour quite a bit into the pan without thinking, and now I only use a tablespoon or two for most things. Also, I decreased things like cheese and butter, and increased the vegetables and beans that I use in my cooking. Those kinds of changes helped make existing meals less calories while still satisfying my cravings for them. I like the microwave steamable vegetable sides to add low calorie bulk to meals. By eating more vegetables, it balances my meals and I need less of the higher calorie foods. Eating smaller portions helps too, like sometimes you're just eating more than you need to be satisfied.  Skinnytaste.com has tasty low calorie recipes.

I still eat deserts everyday, and often eat snack foods like chips and cheese crackers. I just learned to eat smaller portions. 

I didn't exercise when I was losing weight much at all, but now that I've lost weight I like to go for walks. You can change your weight by changing your diet."
loseit,fdq1m3k,t3_emnvdh,1578650376.0,"Are you weighing yourself first thing in the morning before you eat and drink things? Have you weighed yourself between today and the 29th? If you're weighing after you've eaten and drank, that can really affect your weight because you hold on to that food and water weight throughout the day. If I drink my 17oz bottle of water for example, then I gain a little over a pound from that until it passes through my system. I'm usually several pounds higher at the end of the day than the beginning. Weighing under the same conditions in the morning before eating and drinking helps give you the cleanest slate possible, though your weight will still fluctuate based on your hydration, hormones, bloating, inflammation (especially if you've changed or added exercise), and waste in you digestive system.

I would recommend getting a food scale, because it's very hard to eyeball or estimate the size of food. It helps you really get a good idea of what you're eating, and might help eliminate the feeling that you need to add buffer calories to make up for all the uncertainty. Sometimes food descriptions can be inaccurate, like even the smallest bananas I find are higher calorie than the ""small"" bananas in the calorie tracking apps. Check your foods to make sure you have the serving sizes right (like that the soup isn't 200 calories per serving, 2.5 servings in a can, 500 calories total for example). Also, check the labels against what's in MFP, because MFP does have a lot of inaccurate calorie information since their database is mostly user created and sometimes outdated/improperly entered. 

It does sound like you're eating a pretty small amount, so increasing your calories some might be a good idea after you've check that things are accurate. Your calorie goal should be what you're aiming toward. You don't want to be too much lower or higher than it."
loseit,fdjf8my,t1_fdhf7z3,1578468293.0,"When you initially start exercising or change your exercise, you do usually see an increase in your weight because of water retention. Your body becomes a bit more inflamed due to muscle recovery. Your body also stores more glycogen. The increase in weight can last for a month. Since you're so carefully measuring your food, you are still eating at a calorie deficit and losing fat. You might not see it on the scale each week, but you'll see it over time. Weighing yourself is a great way to track progress over time, but some days or weeks your weight will fluctuate even when you're losing fat (due to all the other things your body is composed of). Sometimes you just have to trust the process and wait a couple weeks before worrying too much about it.

Because the powdered milk has calories, so drinking less of it would result in weight loss if she isn't replacing it with something else. She might also just be snacking a bit less without the sweet tea.

Artificial sweeteners don't stop weight loss or add weight. But they can increase cravings in some people, so if she isn't tracking her food it's possible that she just eats a bit more when she has the sweeteners. She should do whatever works for her."

You could be under logging, but eating a higher calorie amount than you think. If you're logging pretty accurately counting everything (cooking oil, liquids, etc) and using a food scale, then I would just make some small changes like eating fattier cuts of meat (like chicken thighs, salmon, beef) and nuts to get your calories up to 1300."
loseit,fd5dr07,t3_ek2uxd,1578176649.0,"You can weigh pasta and rice either before or after. I've seen people here say that weighing before is more accurate because your food can absorb a varying amount of water, but I haven't found that it matters that much in practice. When I swapped from weigh before to weighing after, I saw no difference in my weight loss but it was a lot easier. You just have to use a cooked entry for weighing after, and an uncooked entry for weighing before. Most calorie information on packages is for the product as it is sold (e.g. dry rice has dry rice calorie information it the package). Personally, I weigh things based on when it's most convenient for me. Like, if I'm making a pasta dish with multiple ingredients then I'll weigh it dry, and put in those calories as part of the recipe calculator. If I'm making plain salted rice, then I weigh after when I'm dishing it up on my plate.

I cook for a whole family, so weighing everything before I cook it is harder sometimes than weighing after since everyone's taking from the same pot. For things like plain roasted meat, steamed vegetables, rice, boiled beans, baked potatoes, and such where I'm not adding caloric additional ingredients, I think weighing after is fine. Watch out for cooking oil though, like if you put oil on something you want to account for the amount you used as well because it is very caloric.

When I eat at a place with no calorie information, I just use a similar entry from a restaurant. It's not perfectly accurate, but I don't want to avoid those places completely.

For recipes/combination meals, I usually just entered all the ingredients into my app's recipe builder, weigh the finished dish, then put the weight of the whole dish as the number of servings. Then I will weigh the amount I ate to get the calorie information. Like if I make chili, I will weigh my pot of chili at the end, subtract the pot weight (I have a note on my phone with the weight of my pots/pans), and enter the food weight as the number of servings. If I serve myself a bowl of chili that is 230g, then I will enter it as 230 servings. I don't think those little differences like one bowl having more beef and one having more tomato is really a huge difference.

Your calorie counting is never going to be perfect. It's good to hammer out any big issues like forgetting to log something or underestimating portions. But when it comes to the minutia, a 5-50 calorie difference in either direction isn't going to make or break your weight loss efforts."

I could loose weight eating 1500 calories a day now as a 120lb, 28 year old, sedentary woman. If you got comfortable at that calorie range, then you could just stick with it instead of adjusting it.

loseit,fcvw037,t3_ej6os2,1578011355.0,"If I'm out of the house, then I just estimate using a restaurant food that sounds similar. Keeping up with the habit of tracking and the awareness of what you're eating is more important than always being 100% perfect. Often I can have sort of an idea of the calories based on my experience with similar food from other restaurants and home cooking. Just keep in mind that there is some uncertainty in your logging, so you might not lose as much as you expect for the week. Things like going out to eat with family and friends or having a social thing at someone's house are just part of your life, so tracking imperfectly is better than becoming a hermit.

Also, think about what type of restaurant experience you want. Like sometimes, you want to be indulgent and eat over your calorie goals because there's a food you've been cravings or the restaurant serves a special food. Sometimes you want to splurge on the desert or appetizers. Other times, it's more about eating with people or meeting your food needs so you might choose something less indulgent and easier to calorie count like grilled chicken, small steak, salad, chicken sandwich, steamed vegetables, chili, or things like that. Not every restaurant visit needs to be indulgent.

If it's something I'm eating at home, like take out I've brought home or something another family member cooked, then I might use the food scale to estimate the calories for the components in the meal. Like, if my dad cooked pork chops, rice, and steamed green beans than I might weight the foods out, estimate things like cooking oil and just try to break down the calories as best I can.

I would aim to hit your goal and not be under budget. Estimating what you plan eat at restaurants ahead of time can be a good strategy though. Personally, I'm the type of person who likes having leftovers from restaurants. I really like splitting a meal or desert in half so I can eat the other part for lunch or supper the next day. Maybe you can practice and develop your habit to eat in moderation over time. It helps me to serve the amount of a junk food that I want to eat on a small plate, put the rest away, and walk to another room. That way I have to go back to the kitchen and pull more out to eat more. The host of the Half Size Me podcast recommends getting prepackaged, single-serve containers of things so you don't overeat them. Like, the small bags you would put in a child's lunch. Or going to a bakery and buying just one very tasty treat instead of a bunch of them. If you really struggle, then you could eat half the cake them throw the rest away. It's not like it's so nutritious and rare that you need to save it.

Are far as naturally thin people, we aren't naturally thin and it might not ever come as easy to us. I've been maintaining my weight loss for over a year and a half, and I would say my appetite is generally inline with my new weight. I haven't counted calories regularly in the last year, but I do still look at packages and menus so I'm aware of the calories for things. Calorie counting helped me learn to eat smaller portions and find foods/cooking methods that support my lower weight. You might eventually transition away from counting calories. But it's a useful tool for evaluating your eating habits and seeing where you can cut down.

Edit: To track homemade food, use the recipe function. Almost every calorie counting app will have a recipe builder. It adds up all the ingredients in a recipe and divides by the number of servings to give you a calories per serving. I like to use my food scale to create servings by weight, but you could also just do servings as fractions like 1/8th of a casserole is a serving or half of an omelette."
loseit,fct6dxq,t3_einw44,1577934062.0,"My theory is that for most people, their attempts to lose weight have been pretty negative experiences. They do a diet that is hard and miserable, or they hate the taste of their special diet recipes, or they feel so, so hungry trying to do a shake diet. So for them, when they cheated on their diet or gave up all together, it was a relief. And they want to encourage other people to have that same relief, and eat in a ""fun"" way again. So it seems like people are trying to give me permission to have an ""out"" and let loose, but they don't realize that I like the things I'm eating and I don't feel like I'm missing out. It helps to not say something like, ""I can't have that"" when offered food (like an outside force is stopping you), and instead say ""I don't want to eat that"" or ""no thank you"" (like you're making a choice based on your preferences).

I also think that there's a skewed idea of what a healthy weight looks like in some countries like the USA. We get so use to seeing overweight people that a normal weight person seems very skinny. If they're use to most men they know being 200lbs or more, then it might seem like a very low weight to hear that their 6'2 male friend wants to get down to 175. People also get use to how you look and accept it as the normal you, so when you lose more weight than they've seen from you then I think it can seem sort of exaggerated in their mind because it's so different from what they're used to.

I don't think people are being purposely sabotaging or negative. I think that, at least with most friends and family, they're trying to do something helpful most of the time and they just don't understand your goal. I usually just ignored comments and changed the subject if people were being sort of negative. I might say that I'm a healthy weight (or overweight if it was before I got below BMI 25), but I didn't go into the details of what I was doing to lose weight or what my ultimate goal would be. I think if I told people I wanted to be 120lbs then they would have thought it was way too low of a number, but looking at me they might not guess I weigh that little now."
loseit,fct4cl8,t3_eirt6c,1577932553.0,"I weighed almost everyday when I was losing weight, and it worked well for me. I used the Libra app to keep my weights, and it displays a graph. It was helpful to see how my weight fluctuated, like everyday it might be a little less or more than the day before, but over time it trended down. Weighing often also helped me see how certain things affected my weight. Daily weighing was also easier for me to get into a habit of, because I could just make it part of my normal morning routine (weigh, wash my face, brush my teeth, etc). When I've tried to weigh weekly or less regularly, I would forget and wind up drinking/eating which would throw off my weigh-in.

I think daily weighing can be negative for some people, like they might get too hung up on those small daily fluctuations that don't really mean anything. But for me, it worked the opposite. I learned what it looked like for my weight to fluctuate so I didn't get as discouraged to have a week where my weight didn't change or even went up."

It probably took me several minutes to read the rest of the comments, so you could have already edited your comment but I still saw the original.

When people talk about fasting in those subs, they're talking about periods where they don't eat at all or where they only eat certain specific things (like I saw one person was consuming protein shakes, many people consume broth and zero calorie electrolyte drinks). It isn't like Islamic fasting, in the sense that when they say they're doing a 7 day ""water fast"" they mean that continuously for those 7 days they will not eat food and will only drink zero calorie liquids/supplements like salt and magnesium."
loseit,fcs1n2q,t3_eikj5r,1577910051.0,"One of the first changes I made was to make my own coffee and ween myself down in the sugar and cream in it. I make myself a mug of coffee to drink in the mornings, and I put some in an insulated travel mug to take to work for lunch. I learned to develop a taste for black coffee, though now I do often still drink my coffee with half and half. The packaged coffees often have a lot of sugar and calories. Canned white Monster energy drinks and packaged plain cold brew are also zero calorie if you want something canned.

Poptarts are pretty high calorie for the level of satiety they give you. There are other convienient breakfast options. If you boiled some eggs over the weekend, having a few of those in the mornings would give you more protien. There are also plenty of protien and fiber bars that would be as convienient as poptarts but less calories.

For lunch, you could probably just make your own sandwich the night before, maybe with a side of s ol methinks like baby carrots or crackers. I personally really like sardines packed in olive oil with crackers for lunch. There are some prepackaged microwave soups that are nice for lunch too, and they wouldn't require any prep. The tuna packets you can get in the grocery store are really handy. Fruits like oranges, berries, and bananas are easy to pack as well.

For supper, I find skinnytaste.com and budgetbytes.com to have some really good recipes. You can also get takeout sometimes, but just be mindful of what you're ordering. You can change your takeout orders to be lower calorie. Like, you can get salad or steamed vegetables on the side. You can choose a smaller burger. You can get a grilled meat instead of a creamy pasta dish. Whatever type of food you're ordering, trying googling for lower calorie options. For chains, you can look at their nutrition information online.

As far as having 2 cheat days a week, I would be careful with that. Instead of cheat days, have days where you eat up to your calorie maintenance or you have an indulgent meal but keep some of your new habits the same."
loseit,fcpv68e,t3_eidsei,1577872817.0,"Sticking to around 1500--2000 might be better. I think your grilled chicken entry might be wrong though. Skinless, boneless chicken breast would be the lowest calorie cut of chicken that I can think of, and 5oz of it would be around 211 calories. Also, if you aren't weighing things with a food scale I would recommend weighing them for accuracy instead of estimating, but it's really not a big deal since this diet probably has you at a pretty big deficit.

Sometimes a very low calorie diet can be attainable for a short time, but you see the effects eventually. You'll get more hunger and cravings because you're eating much lower than your TDEE. It is hard to sustain long-term, and you don't necessarily learn how to eat to maintain your lower weight. If you're being very restrictive that can lead to a pattern where you're either totally on the diet, or totally off it eating in a way that causes your high weight because you don't teach yourself to eat moderately. You can be low on some nutrients you need. If you want a more detailed break down of your nutrition intake, the calorie tracking app Cronometer probably does the best job tracking that. Fast weight loss can also put you at an increased risk for gallstones."
1200isjerky,fcoga0r,t1_fcoeugs,1577831515.0,"You would still be eating everyday or most days after sundown and before dawn though, right? The fasting sub has lots of people eating no food, at all, for weeks. Dry fasting is not drinking or eating anything for days. It's really different than the type of fasting you would do at Ramadan.

Edit: You added the last two paragraphs after I posted this."
loseit,fcja66q,t3_eh9b2l,1577681121.0,"If you're eating 2000 calories a day, then you should be able to lose pretty quickly for the next 6 months. Starvation mode isn't really a thing in the sense that your body will stop burning fat and destroy muscle instead. Your body stores fat so it can use it in times of lower energy consumption. You will likely lose some lean tissue as you lose fat, but you aren't going to be losing lean tissue instead of fat.

With counting calories, accuracy in counting can help you have a more predictable and steady weight loss. If you're just estimating your calories by eyeballing your portions or guessing the size of things, then that isn't very accurate and you won't be eating the amount that you're logging. It's common for people to underestimate their portions. Using a food scale can help make your calorie counting more accurate, along with a calorie counting app like Cronometer. I also recommend you get a scale to weigh your body at home. People usually recommend that you weigh yourself after you first wake up to help reduce the effect that the food and water you consume have on the scale. Like, when you drink a 16oz bottle of water you gain a pound of body weight. Weighing at the plasma center means you'll probably do it later in the day and your weight will be more affected by the things you do beforehand. It's also helpful to be able to weigh more often so you can better see your weight trends.

Your weight loss will slow down as your weight goes down, because you body will need less energy to maintain itself at a lower weight so your calorie deficit won't be as high. As you lose weight you will feel better and be more capable, so losing more slowly shouldn't be as big of a deal. You at 320lbs are going to be better off than you are now, and even still you'll be better off at 280lbs. You weight will probably fluctuate, so you might weigh more some weeks even if you're doing things right. Hydration level, body waste, hormones, swelling, and inflammation can affect your weight. If you're losing weight, then you'll see that in trends over time but you might not see the number go down each weigh it.

One of the hardest parts of weight loss is being patient and consistent. Being able to plug away at it day after day, even when things aren't exciting or when you're having a bad day, is going to be the biggest determiner of whether you succeed. If you mess up, then forgive yourself and get back into your routine.

Personally, I found it easier to incorporate junk food and diet soda into my foods as I was calorie counting and losing weight. I would just eat things like chips and sweets in smaller portions. I know some people like to cut it out, but I've never found that to work for me. I'd rather eat an ounce of chips than eat no chips."

Like people will get so offended if you try to figure out if they're calorie counting accurately or ask to see some details of what they're doing. Clearly they don't have everything figured out if they've been the same obese weight for six months.

Given the ""bad boi"" ""rawr"" bit though, maybe this person is trolling."
loseit,fc2xcp1,t3_efwvz4,1577376538.0,"I weighed myself every day while losing weight. It isn't bad, but you do have to be aware that your weight won't go down everyday even if you're in a consistant calorie deficit. Your weight isn't just a reflection of your body fat, but also is affected by your hydration levels, body waste, inflammation, and bloating. It's normal to see it fluctuate, so try to keep your eyes on long term trends instead of the day to day. You might have a week or two even where you are doing things right, losing body fat, but you don't see it on the scale.

Fasting is fine if it works for you. It isn't nessessary. Eating at a calorie deficit will result in weight loss. You don't need to cut out any food to lose weight, like I still ate desserts and junk food as I was losing. Just be aware of what foods leave you feeling satisfied and comfortable, like it's worth eating more lower calorie, nutritious foods that satisfy your hunger. Sometimes apps overestimate calories burned in exercise, so be aware of that if your progress doesn't match your estimated deficit."
loseit,fc26qxy,t3_efrzct,1577342959.0,"If you're already counting calories and have a general trend, then you can just decide based on your rate of weight loss and how you feel throughout the day. How much weight do you lose on average a week? I would say 1 pound a week is a pretty good deficit, more than 1 pound is a bit more of an aggressive deficit for most people. If you feel tired, run down, or very hungry then it could be worth upping your calories.

To me, you do sound lightly or moderately active. If you don't have much of a weight loss trend to look at, then you can always just go to a higher calorie goal and see how your weight loss is for a few weeks. I think part of why people recommend defaulting to sedentary is because a lot of people don't calorie count super accurately, so they unintentionally eat a few hundrrd calories over their goal and a lower deficit gives a nice buffer to still be eating under TDEE."
loseit,fbvokca,t3_eens0b,1577133803.0,"I don't count calories anymore. I haven't regularly counted calories at all this year, and it's been going pretty well. I started the year at around 122lbs and I'm currently at around 118lbs. Almost each month I lost just a teeny bit of weight, which isn't ideal. I would say 122 is closer to where I'd like to maintain, so I have been thinking that I need to gain a little weight. But that thought combined with my having more free time this month has led me to slip on some of my eating habits. I'm grazing more and eating more when I'm already satiated. I'm not necessarily worried about it because my weight has just gone up a couple pounds for the month, but I don't want to get in a rut of doing my old habits and gaining too much of the weight back.

For Christmas, I'm going to visit family and I'll just aim to not eat too many sweets. I try to keep myself busy with non-food related things like playing with my cousin's kids. Last year I walked there dog several times, which is really fun. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that this year."
