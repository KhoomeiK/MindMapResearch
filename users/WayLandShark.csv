beyondthebump,fet22ss,t3_eqfgb0,1579371097.0,"Honestly, the solution to this issue is to stop doing everything. Delegate responsibilities related to childcare to your husband. Start taking time for yourself, and leave the house so your husband has to step up and take charge. Think about what specifically you want, and then talk to your husband about how you are feeling and what he can do to make the relationship an equal partnership. 

When you do these things, it’s vitally important that you avoid criticizing the way your husband takes care of your baby. When you criticize him you are undermining him as a parent and telling him that he is not capable, which will feed into the narrative that you should do it because he “isn’t good at it” or “you’re better at it.” It’s too convenient for him to use any criticism against you so that he can continue the status quo.

It sounds like he asked you to do certain things for his birthday, so you did them. But you were not specific with him about what you wanted to do for your birthday.

OP’s boyfriend probably has a legitimate perspective (maybe he is focused on improving his life and thinks a hand tattoo won’t help Op be successful in her career or would be ashamed to bring her home to his family), but he probably isn’t very good at expressing it. Likely by dating someone who had tattoos in the past he realized that it’s not something that he is interested in. 

It could be that he is controlling too, but it’s not really clear based on the information we have. If he was controlling in the past, then this might be likely. But since OP didn’t mention anything about that, I would assume its value based."

Stop drinking calories (beer, alcohol, soda, juice, etc)

Eat lean meat and vegetables 

Limit desserts to small portions 

Snack on healthy low calorie things (carrots/cucumbers and hummus, apples, avocados, bananas). 

If you eat fast food, pay attention to calories. Eliminate extra calories (e.g., skip mayo and cheese, no fries). 

Don’t eat anything fried.

BTW, I’m horrified that your ex would treat you that way. You deserve better and you will find better (even if you stay the way you are now). You are not any less of a person or deserving of love because of how much you weigh. Think about what you would tell someone else in your shoes."
