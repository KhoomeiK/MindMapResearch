ThatsInsane,ff7asqe,t1_ff7ai6u,1579644910.0,"I have had snakes, as well as other reptiles. My California King Snake was a full 6’ and she wouldn’t eat a dead mouse. Animals are designed to be what they are for a reason. If you have no first hand experience with an animal or reptile then you’re just taking up and argument that you know nothing about, besides what you have read. With in home care you can properly care for the reptile if something happens to it.  She has had injuries from the mice but nothing more than a bite. 

To answer my question No rats are not knocked out before the snake eats them in the wild."
