depression,fekd96w,t1_fekc549,1579197621.0,"I’m sorry to hear that. And that’s how school operates here. Counselors are required to call your parents especially since your underage. I don’t seem to see a reason why they’d be so stubborn though especially with all the stress you’re going through at such a young age. If counselors don’t work, try talking directly with your teachers. Explain them your situation at home, and ask for any ways you can make up extra credit to pass your classes. Seems like that’s the only good thing you can do for now. Talking back to your parents about the mistakes they’re currently making will just make things worse. I’ve tried doing that to my parents, and they kicked me out during senior year. You’ll get out of this situation soon. Once you graduate, get any job, save up money, and find a group house to live in. Work hard, stay strong, and never give up on things too easily. Don’t settle your life with your parents if they can’t even be there or have sympathy for you. If you need someone to talk with at anytime, I’m here."
depression,fekbxo9,t3_epmgc1,1579196840.0,"Perhaps you should talk to your school counselors and explain them your situation of why you’re having a hard time with your grades at school. They have plenty of resources. I’ve been there too during my junior year and half way through senior year of Highschool. My English teacher during senior year even decided to take responsibility of me until I graduated just to avoid my abusive parents since I didn’t have any other relatives. And trust me, you’re not alone in this. Do you live in the US by any chance as well? cause I’m not sure how other countries’ school system works. But I’m quite sure everyone has similar resources for students in need."
depression,fekbasp,t3_eplu9y,1579196463.0,"I’ve been in a similar situation, but it was with my coworkers. There was 4 of them, ages 16-19. They were often depressed from the reality of life, and some were going through substance abuse. I tried to cheer them up and guide them through very often, but they always ended just ignoring my advice. Instead of trying to send them to counselors/therapy, I insisted them to attend support group meetings at my local church. Reason being is because there’s actual real people with real feelings and experience there. Unlike going to a counselor/psychologist which feels like talking to a robot taking notes. In support group, you build friendship and strong bonds with other people going through tough times and depression. Not only that, they’ll build strong coping skills there too. But every person is different, it may or may not work. But it doesn’t hurt to try."
depression,feka6uf,t3_epm11d,1579195811.0,"Been there a lot. I ended up losing a job I loved doing due to mental illnesses.I’ve had 6 employers last year. Been hopping here and there, hoping that I’ll find something better. But turns out, it doesn’t matter if I lost that one dream job I had. There’s so much more careers out there to explore. Just pick any job you can get for now and earn money. Save up while branching for other careers you’ll be interested in. As of now, I work at Chipotle while working as a freelance photographer/videographer during my freetime. I used to be in the Army as an infantryman, served for 3 years and it was the only thing I’ve always wanted to do. But plans will never work the way you want them to. If one career doesn’t work, then branch out to others. It’s not the end of the world yet, you have all the time in the world to find something. Trust me, just save up and look into other careers that you’ll enjoy doing and that will pay well."

depression,fednqmz,t3_eomg47,1579015956.0,"Same, but different scenario for me. I’m a great hard working person. But employers constantly lay me off to the point where I don’t even feel like getting a job anymore. I’m only 20, but feel like I’ve hit rock bottom for my life. No plans for the future, for hardly any money since it all goes to bills, etc. I got a job offer, but it’s been almost a week when they told me they’re gonna call me about when I’ll be starting. For once I felt great again thinking I’ll be getting a sense of purpose again, but then it came back. Thinking that they’ll probably bail on me since I called like 3 times over the past few days to follow up. I spent the past week just smoking and laying down in bed :("

I planned out on becoming a freelance photographer last year September, and now I’m doing it for a living during my free time. Life can get interesting as long as you set goals and actually put in the time and effort to achieve them. And it doesn’t have to be career wise.

depression,fe9acsn,t3_eo6xuc,1578935820.0,"It depends on the work environment. Getting a job led me to meeting awesome people. There are many reasons why a job might just make things worse such as: bad management, stupid rude customers, tasks, etc. so it really depends. Having a job does give you a sense of purpose though, plus you can do a lot with the money you earn. Find a job you’ll enjoy doing. Or either go to a job you intend on applying for and see how the workers interact with each other, or how many workers are there that is about your age group, etc."

depression,fe93rin,t1_fe92por,1578933844.0,"Also more people get medically discharged for not making the cut MENTALLY (At least 8-15 trainees). And the process of getting sent back home can take months. So make sure if you can make it through mentally. If you easily give up on yourself, then it’s a no. Also you have to get through that physical+mental barrier cause you’ll need it. You’ll spend 80-90% of the day getting smoked, literally you’ll fatigue a lot. And if you get caught making a mistake, guess what? Your drill sergeants will make your whole platoon or even company hate you. And that mentality builds up til they see you break."
depression,fe92por,t3_eo6b1x,1578933544.0,"I knew a fellow soldier who couldn’t make the cut in the Army during boot camp. He only lasted til the 3rd week of red phase. The military is mainly for those who are both physically and mentally tough. Also depression and having self harm scars is an automatic disqualification for enlistment. If you have multiple visible scars, then don’t even bother enlisting cause they’ll decline you. Try branching out to different careers. You don’t necessarily have to go to college to find a good job you’ll enjoy and find purpose with. You can pickup something like being a freelance photographer or join the trades school and become a welder/carpenter. I myself enlisted and had major depression which wasn’t on any of my medical records thanks to me not opening up about it to my doctor at the time, and I can guarantee you you’ll have a hard time during boot camp. I only made it through cause of my battle buddies at the time. I excelled on the physical training, but it wasn’t easy getting through things such as getting smoked and degraded by drill sergeants. Not only that, I received 0 letters from family or friends throughout boot camp and I got so depressed seeing everyone receive photos and letters from loved ones."

That way, you end up with someone who deeply understand you and likes you for who you are. Every girl is different, you could be great friends for a year and she’d end up going out with some guy she just met a month ago. And you can’t fully blame girls as well. You have to stand out as the most interesting guy in the group if you want others to fall for you. If anything, taking them out or just hanging out with them works a lot too. I’ve only had one girl friend so far, but my first one lasted 6 years. Reason why it lasted that long is because I put my full effort on her and myself as well. You’ll meet someone eventually, just don’t rush or be desperate for it. Work on yourself first."

Reason we ditched prom was because 40% of our graduating class was banned from attending it for literally just using the school WiFi on our phones/devices. Best time I ever had and still is. We were just enjoying our last days, surfing, eating the fishes we caught during sunset, etc. And school bonds in Hawaii are the strongest in my opinion since everyone lives close by each other."

You can be a professional freelance photographer/videographer, or be motivational speaker, etc. That’s what I often remind myself whenever I feel like giving up. Right now I’m working on getting recognized by fashion brands to become a street wear photographer for them. And I’ve already started working for certain local brands here in Vegas. Literally, just pick something interesting and it will lead you places."
