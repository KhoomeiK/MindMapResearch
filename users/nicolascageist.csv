Suomi,fej25xw,t1_fej1n5x,1579154137.0,"T√§m√§h√§n se. Kunnilla ei oikeasti ole vain rahaa lojumassa ymp√§riins√§, p√§invastoin. Nykyinen tilanne on saatu aikaan v√§hent√§m√§ll√§ ty√∂voimaa, jotta palkkamenoja saataisiin pienennetty√§, mink√§ seurauksena hoitajien ty√∂olot ja ty√∂m√§√§r√§t suurentuivat, mink√§ seurauksena hoitajat vaativat muutoksia (yleens√§ palkankorotuksia), jotka vain pahentaisivat ongelmaa. Toisaalta hoitajilla on ihan erilainen tilanne kuin paperimiehill√§, joihin he haluavat verrata palkkojaan enk√§ ole ihan varma miten mielek√§st√§ ko. vertaus on. Kuntien on k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ teht√§v√§ tulonsiirtoja muilta palkansaajilta hoitajille voidakseen korottaa hoitajien palkkoja ja suurin osa ansaitsee v√§hemm√§n kuin hoitajat nyt. Jokainen sitten itse muodostaa mielipiteens√§ siit√§ mik√§ on oikeudenmukaista."

I made a marinade for the ground beef using gochujang (soy sauce, gochujang, sugar/honey, toasted sesame oil, garlic, ginger) and a separate sriracha sauce to pour on top (3 parts sriracha, 1 parts of each of the following: rice wine vinegar, toasted sesame oil, sugar + heaps of red chili powder). The veggies were fried in a pan with toasted sesame oil and TONS of garlic and some sesame seeds. Drizzled some soy sauce on top of the mushrooms in the end (they were especially delicious!). The veggies I used were spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, bok choy, and mushrooms.  Also added kimchi and a fried egg on top in addition to spring onions.

It was actually really delicious even with the random sauces:D"
