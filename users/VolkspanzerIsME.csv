If you are talking about hyenas or killer whales that are matriarchal in social constructs then I would say rape doesn't happen at all. If you are talking about sharks or other fish that spawn and the eggs are fertilized later, it doesn't matter as there is no sex.  If you are talking about geese or albatross who mate for life often times, I would think it's non-existent. Cats and squirrels attract as many males as possible during estrus.  Ducks: ducks rape.  All the time.  Some dude got a nobel prize for describing the first documented case of homosexual necrophilia where a male mallard flew into his window and another male showed up immediately and raped the corpse for 44 min.
