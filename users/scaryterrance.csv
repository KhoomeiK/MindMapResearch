cohunting,fervhsd,t1_fd4604d,1579358758.0,I'm worried about eating a suburban rabbit. Mostly because they are known to eat garden plants which usually have pesticides on them.

cohunting,fedg4yt,t1_fdon7wh,1579010613.0,"Yeah bears are starting to become a problem like they are in Montana. They've decreased the cost of a bear tag to get hunters to help with the overpopulation. 

&#x200B;

The thing that worries me is if no one hunts bears, they hear enough gunshots, and associate the gunshots with stumbling across an elk carcass... They might start to associate gunshots with a quick meal. (This is what is happening in Montana right now)"

Make sure you read the instructions before you download all the files. You'll have to pick left hand, right hand, or symetric reel. The only thing you need is a zip tye and some polyacrylate glue (superglue)"

COfishing,fctxpvp,t3_eiwm48,1577964807.0,"st vrain ponds are not iced over yet.

Red Feather Lakes should be iced over, but if you are looking for Lakers you wont find what you are looking for.

Chambers is a best bet, but you have to walk through some snow. (There are some massive lakers you just have to find them)

There's actually a tiny pond by the recycling center in loveland that people have been ice fishing this year if you wanted to stay in town (Let me know if you go to this one, I wanna see if anyone has any luck). 

I would not try to do much stuff at lower elevation right now, just because the highs have been in the 40s and sunny recently."
MaliciousCompliance,fcrfb7r,t1_fcpemtt,1577901067.0,It is quite steep if you barely go over each month. I bet you can get a program that will track your internet usage though so it will be easier to ration if you need to. Plus I think it's 10$ per 100 gigs over? So the extra 10 or 20 if you go over may be the way to go.
MaliciousCompliance,fcrekre,t1_fcp5jlg,1577900779.0,If you have gigabit internet no cap has always been an option. They give you 3 months grace period as well. So you have 3 months where you can go over a TB before you have to Shell out the extra 50 a month.
