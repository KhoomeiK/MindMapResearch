Music,ff5bbej,t1_ff584m7,1579586035.0,"True, it's about the end goal. So someone like Jeff who could have given billions verse me who could equivalently give 40 dollars is exactly the same... Totally equal. It's the thought that counts."
Damnthatsinteresting,ferwp9n,t3_eqeqx9,1579359090.0,"""When will then be now?"""
aww,fepsvgg,t1_fepdap2,1579330123.0,"When I was a baby our cat hated me, she even scratched me up bad at one point. Luckily, she was able to live long enough for me to be able to pet and cuddle with her as an older child. I missed that cat so much when it died I went a little crazy for a little while."
AnimalsBeingDerps,feizb2u,t1_feios0n,1579151487.0,Pop? No he would be pulling his pants down on stage.
AnimalsBeingDerps,feiytu3,t1_feimtbb,1579151069.0,"No I agree, but we can't change that now so I love it all it all the same. As long as it is happy (which it seems to be) I'm cool with it."
AnimalsBeingDerps,feiyljp,t3_ep4sm6,1579150867.0,What is this adorably mutilated creature called?
kratom,fefb0ph,t1_fecywpo,1579052358.0,It seems like we still teeter on mostly unknown risks for now. We know a lot about extreme incidents of severe side effects but we have no explanation of what the mechanism is for them and why most people do or don't experience them.
kratom,fecuz2p,t1_fe9jmu4,1578985664.0,It was only related to the roots contaminating certain products. It is not a legitimate concern if you are getting stuff from reputable sources.
kratom,fecupc3,t1_fe8xz5r,1578985353.0,"Jeez, was he injecting pure mitragynine? It must have been some extreme concentrate or some reaction he had, because that seems impossible with regular leaf."
kratom,fecu4yh,t1_feb1ilj,1578984715.0,I would love to see those sources because I have yet to see evidence of liver damage.

politics,fec1197,t1_febzk3q,1578965068.0,"Or it will be ""Never met him, don't know who he is"" or something"
wholesomememes,febzy0t,t1_febs0xg,1578964748.0,They despise you?! or they are just not interesting in having a relationship? Those are too very different things. Not every interaction you have with females is related to having sex.
wholesomememes,febzhr7,t1_febqeg8,1578964575.0,"It needs to be a really commitment and it will help, but it won't fix everything instantly. Keep at it and you will eventually feel better but it is not a guaranteed solution to depression. One thing about exercise: it is really hard to force yourself to workout when you are depressed, so I am very impressed you are able to put in the effort to do so. It is nearly impossible for me nowadays."
wholesomememes,febxkyg,t1_febkvfp,1578963934.0,"So do people who lift weighs not put on deodorant because that is going to over power any natural ""testosterone smell"" (I hope that it would at least)."
wholesomememes,febwh7m,t1_feb0mxz,1578963492.0,So they smoke around you even though you don't like it? I smoke but if I do I go as far away from nonsmokers as I can and always throw away my butts because I hate littering.
HumansBeingBros,febvegd,t1_febiex8,1578963126.0,"I work at target too, and it gets cleared out pretty quickly, but there are still a few things there. I was doing plano the day after Christmas and stuff was already 50% at my store. They also start moving the Christmas stuff to a smaller area like a week and a half before Christmas, which is kind of annoying if I am doing Fulfillment. Finding ornaments is a bitch as it is."
reactiongifs,fdrpc73,t1_fdqk28f,1578687691.0,"What's a major sign of ""(semi)closeted dudes"" and do you have a big aversion to them if they are bisexual?"
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd0t5tf,t1_fd02s5b,1578123416.0,Knowing the context of this makes it just depressing.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd0stwc,t1_fd055ts,1578123282.0,"I honestly feel like this when ever I go to a zoo nowadays, especially exhibits like the chimpanzees. The chimps are there just watching us... as much as we are watching them. At the Los Angeles zoo they even had tiny bleachers for people to sit right in front of the enclosure. Of course you can't give them food but I have been getting a scummy feeling from the zoo recently, I used to love it."
WTF,fd0jnma,t1_fd0firu,1578119780.0,"I think most people just feel like they can't do much about it individually. I could barely do much myself except give up eating meat, stop using electricity and quit my job which I am only a low level employee for. But then how would I be able to eat meat... or anything at all for that matter?"
funny,fcm2n95,t1_fclyp3a,1577762637.0,So it IS a spectrum.

aww,fcm1mkw,t3_ehuh1m,1577761877.0,I saw a poster the other day that was of the same type of dog with pictures and it said 'have you seen her?'. That kind of shit breaks my heart. I have seen similar posters that stay up for months. Fuck this world.
Unexpected,fc13xq4,t3_efiazk,1577307557.0,My parents took a video of one of these types of things and were seriously pissed off at me afterward because I was picking my nose half the time. I remember none of that. Good times.
