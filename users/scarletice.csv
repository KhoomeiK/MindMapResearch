By excluding her from your gifts, you singled her out, shaming her for choosing to be with her family instead of volunteering to work overtime.

The proper response would have been to text her, warning her that you were calling a tow truck, then call a tow truck. This gets her car out of your driveway while also getting the point across without making it impossible for her to recover her car. Basically, you jumped straight to the nuclear option without trying more reasonable methods first. And though I think it's hilarious and she totally deserved it, it was still kind of an asshole move.

Firing someone should never be a public affair unless the employee is refusing your summons to a private discussion. With that said, I don't think you were wrong to fire him. Maybe you could have tried having a conversation first, but you didn't owe him that. He was clearly overstepping his bounds and showing a blatant disregard for your authority."

Hiroshima killed about 80,000 people. Nagasaki killed about 45,000. And in total, including the aftermath, roughly 200,00+ Japanese died I believe.
