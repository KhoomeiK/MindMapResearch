 Nor did I say those were the only reasons for any of the actions. The comment I replied to asked if we were the bad guys. The simple answer is yes, in both cases. There is plenty of oil here in the US, and we could have focused on that to hedge for the Cold War, but we chose to “secure” cheap access to the oil of other sovereign nations via a series of coups and assassinations."

There are comments below saying no it’s not legal, but my class went down to Clearwater FL (this would have been in Feb of 2007 because I’m old), and we went out on the water with a Swim With Manatees Tour and they were the ones who told us about the moss and tummy scritches. I made very good friends with a baby manatee who *loved* the scritches and playing so it followed me around for the whole two hours I was in the water. It’s still to this day one of my favorite memories!"

Edit: have seen below that touching them is still a no no. Which also means that the swim with manatees trip my AP Bio class went on in high school broke some rules 😳"
worldnews,fe96c0f,t1_fe8xxsf,1578934759.0,"Yes we are, especially in this situation. None of this would be happening if we hadn’t assassinated their democratically elected leader in 1953 (he wanted to nationalize Iran’s oil and we can’t have that! That would mean we’d have to pay more for it!), and then installed an insane religious dictator. It also wouldn’t be happening if 45 had just stayed in the damn nuclear deal. But 45 is so thin skinned and racist that he just can’t abide by Obama having done something good."

Healthyhooha,fe60bi4,t1_fe4syoq,1578878932.0,"I use Argan oil *everywhere* except my face. Makes my hair look amazing and silky (I just shampoo, no conditioner, the argan oil does all the moisturizing I need). It’s really light feeling, I love the way it smells, and it’s the only thing I’ve found that doesn’t irritate or over-hydrate my insanely sensitive skin."
