Im saying that the store doesnt matter as much as the product. The shit store is making a deal with the producer, are you only boycotting the store or the producer too? Mind you, they are both willing actors in the exclusivity deal.

> I don't care if they sell Sprite cola Pepsi or 7 up because it's the same thing. The difference is minor.

The difference is irrlevant, its still an exclusivity deal. Both companies are guilty of doing that, are you boycotting them both? Are you boycotting the restaurants who take those deals? They are all guilty of these ""horrible"" practices.

>It's not that I ethicly can't buy it. It's that I don't want a noticebly worse storefront that objectively charges more and does less.

It objectively doesnt charge more. Assassin's Creed games available on both Steam and Epic go for the same price (normally, they happen to be on sale on Steam at the moment). Borderlands 3 on Epic goes for the same price as it would for PS4 and Xbox. Same with The Outer Worlds.

>And to steam getting hacked: steam got hacked in 2011 and even if there are newer cases I have never meet a single person in my life who has gotten their account hacked on steam. Everyone who I know that lost his account got phished and every single person was able to get it back in not time.

Gamingcirclejerk,fextq5s,t1_fexpf0j,1579435965.0,">It absolutely isn't the opposite of capitalism.

I didnt even say that, at all.

>I as the consumer have the choice to pick the best storefront now you take away my choice and I stop buying stuff at your store. Capitalism.

And just as you have a right to choose where to buy things, companies have a right to choose where they sell stuff. Capitalism.

And you only have that right to choose to a degree, you cant walk into ""the best storefront in the world"" and demand they sell you stuff they dont carry. 

Theoretically, the best storefront could only sell shit products. Likewise, the worst storefront could sell the best products. Does that mean you will only buy the shit stuff? No, because you want the good stuff. The store hardly matters if the product is good or something you want.

>In a shop it's impossible to offer all kinds of soft drinks and having cola or Pepsi doesn't make that much of a difference.

Very much possible to do that at a shop. I can go to the store right now and get a bottle of both. Restaurants however make deals with cola or pepsi to get all of their drinks. Want pepsi cola (pepsi brand) and sprite (coca cola brand) in your restaurant? Not possible, you have to take pepsi cola and 7up or coca cola and sprite. Its an exclusivity deal no matter how similar the products are. Its something you claim to hate."
Gamingcirclejerk,fexn8no,t1_fewuryh,1579433596.0,"Epic doesnt force either. Thats why its ridiculous to perceive some devs of a game mentioning that they wont go Epic exclusive as big and good news. It doesnt mean they overcame a gun pressed to their heads, it means they just said no to Epic's offer. Thats how basic business works, companies can make offers and they can refuse them if they dont agree with them. 

People who have a problem with Epic's business practices have a problem with capitalism. But its usually not the communists and socialists who are very anti-Epic.

If you cant support exclusives then you probaply wont drink Coca-cola or Pepsi either. Both companies sign exclusivity deals with restaurants so they wont sell the other."
