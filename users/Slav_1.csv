PrequelMemes,fefxljs,t3_eoun5w,1579068574.0,Adam Driver was a perfect Ben Solo. But even Marlon Brando wouldn't have been able to make Kylo Ren a good character. The writing was just too bad.

PrequelMemes,fdpobng,t3_emjm3g,1578634504.0,"I just can't believe Disney was THAT greedy with Star Wars. It was gonna make a crap tone of money anyway but instead they tried to cram even more marketability into it instead of making it good. At least when George was AFK during the prequel era Lucasfilm hired Genndy fucking Tartakovsky. A man who actually knows his shit and didn't overstep his authority on the canon. George saw the movies as his children, Rian, JJ and Kathleen all so blatantly treat Star Wars like a huge career opportunity. 


P.S. Didn't anyone else find it weird when Disney hired J.J to direct after he had just done Star Trek. That was a huge red flag for me. Star Wars and Star Trek always had a (petty and minor) rivalry and they hire the same guy to direct both."

And if you think that that's a problem you're the one being insane because the purpose is to wow kids not to HBO and get adults to circle jerk how realistic it is. Also, at least you can relate to the characters in the prequels who are aware that Jar Jar is being annoying.

No thank you I'd rather have my characters running around and having 1 clash a minute with close-ups every 5 seconds. Also the bad stuff in the sequels doesnt amount to the bad in the prequels?
