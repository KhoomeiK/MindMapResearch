lupus,ffculw5,t1_ffct8dw,1579807582.0,"Oh that is scary. Well with my husband it was antibiotics, albuterol, a prescription decongestant, and steroids. Same for my mom. I happen to have a nebulizer and he felt like the inhaler wasn't getting in very deep because it triggered a coughing gagging attack,  so he used the nebulizer treatments a few times to. 

I don't know how I managed to not get it. I think,  just guessing, that it was either something similar to an infection I've had before,  or more likely the IVIG treatments I get once a month covered that particular virus as someone who donated was exposed. 

I have started fighting a sinus infection recently and the brown suggests that the bacteria that causes bronchitis is involved. But my oncologist is so far refusing me antibiotics because he's scared I'm going to get c-diff. Hopefully it stays out of my lungs."
lupus,ffcrq1k,t3_es0s50,1579805890.0,"Another post on world news said no fever. My husband, two adult kids and my mom all had a serious infection with those same symptoms a few weeks ago. Husband and mother both were treated for pneumonia just in case because the congestion was so severe.  A lot of people are saying it can't be the same thing, but viruses can arise before the cdc knows about them so while they are probably right, it's just strange that the symptoms are so similar. Lord help us if they get hit with a new second round like that first. It got scary with my husband's infection."

NO fever for any of them, and two of them went into what was diagnosed (without xray) as bronchitis, but I was there and felt sure it was pneumonia. I've had pneumonia 4 times myself and my husband freaked me out because he kept saying ""I feel like I can't breathe "". Never seen him that sick before in 27 years.

Moves into feeling like there's weight and upper lung discomfort, which turned into heavy hard to move congestion. My husband and mother both had to be treated for pneumonia symptoms to be safe after initially being sent away because it was believed to just be a virus.

But when the final days, be it a week or a month,  are upon us,  I want to be in a hospital bed. There IS a lot of physical labor involved, and someone has to be there strong and available 24/7 to help a non-cathed person to a toilet, or be ready to change bedding sometimes multiple times a day. Plus, always be paying attention to medical situations so the person is comfortable, meds given on time,  meals small and frequent that are easy to digest and hydrating. Plus the emotional drain,  needing company and comfort themselves during the passing time... it's a LOT to ask of your loved ones,  even when they truly want to be the one to do it. 

I want my family to be able to sit and socialize with me if possible, and with each other.  But also be able to go have dinner and talk as the family they will be even after I'm gone. Then come back after they have had time to relax and breathe again if they can.  They have responsibilities and families to. I don't want the end of my life to become a trauma."

I like to put ice in a bowl and then run cold water into it to cool them down faster,  so I can peel and prep them quicker.  But I'm not even sure it's necessary for them to peel easy.

lupus,fejwot9,t3_ep31t2,1579187577.0,It's lupus it's not going to kill you is wrong. If it decides to attack an organ (or several) it most certainly can kill you. It went after my kidneys and I swelled up with fluid so badly that I went into congestive heart failure   then threw a massive clot that almost did kill me. It was the lupus that caused all of it. Your mom needs to understand that you're doing your best and talking cruelly to you shows that she has a lot to learn.

todayilearned,fejmuhm,t3_ephzxl,1579180202.0,"So the whole story is probably made up then. The story about christ being dead for 3 days and then resurrected is the story of the winter solstice. In the depths of the winter the sun rises in the same place for 3 days in its trek south on the horizon. Then on the fourth day it rises in a slightly more northern position back the other way,  which promises that warm weather will return and humanity will survive. Many cultures have a christ story which is probably why most people first exposed to it feel there is truth to it somehow almost instinctively. We evolved on this planet the same as every other animal, and our ancestors experience of trying to chart the seasons to survive harsh winters is ingrained into our DNA."
WTF,fejjlof,t3_epe66n,1579176986.0,"This looks like a retained egg I once found in a chicken we butchered. Basically the egg got stuck and kept adding layers of yolk, shell and white making it look like a giant jawbreaker that someone broke in half. The one in the video is pretty small by comparison, so I guess it's not impossible that another forming egg stopped in the same area and formed around a defective egg just hanging out there. 

With my bird the egg was so large nothing could get passed it."
