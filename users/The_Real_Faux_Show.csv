I hope you get the help you need to come out of this stronger than ever!"

It isn't a long term solution, but if you haven't, I recommend texting the Crisis Text Line. They can connect you with resources and help you work through hard moments so you feel less alone. Text HOME to 741741 to give it a try"
offmychest,fen4p7p,t1_femwo5r,1579276907.0,Many online applications (often the only way to apply) will reject an application that doesn't check all the boxes. It makes it harder to make your case like this.
askwomenadvice,fekj636,t3_epnicz,1579201146.0,"Your therapist should be working on this with you. If they aren't, it might be time to find another therapist.

Make sure you're communicating with your partner about this so they don't assume reasons for your actions. See what intimate things you can do together without triggering this reaction. This could be massages, sitting together on the couch holding hands, whatever is comfortable/manageable for you."
askwomenadvice,feile08,t3_epc8a1,1579141243.0,He says things deliberately to hurt you when he's mad. That isn't how healthy couples argue. It sounds like his poen habit is a symptom of larger issues that he is unwilling to address.
depression_partners,fehuhzz,t3_ep4ubl,1579124120.0,"Something along the lines of ""I know you are deeply hurting and it makes sense that you want to pain to stop. I hope you will tell me if you are close to acting of your wish. I would miss you if you weren't here."" might be a good starting place.

offmychest,fdnh6bv,t1_fdlbzja,1578585717.0,"1.) Check out in person games like board gaming and table top roll playing! My whole family (parents, brother, and myself) is involved with that subculture and let me tell you: the whole culture was designed for and by people on the spectrum. I'm allistic but my brother and dad are autistic. They definitely have to work less hard to fit in at gaming or sci-fi conventions then I do. These events are all over the country and they are FULL of people just like you who struggle to fit into allistic society.

2.) If your ""friends"" care about how you look, they aren't friends. I understand that looks help with first impressions but I know some honestly ugly Aspies with thriving geeky social lives. 

3.) Do it! Sometimes the best way to get good out of life is the give it to someone else first. The above mentioned conventions (especially the smaller ones) are always looking for people to help set up and run conventions. It's a fantastic way to meet people who automatically share some interests with you.

4.) Not their fault exactly. I guess I meant that you feel like the hand you were delt (genetics and childhood) is holding you back, but now is a great time to push past what you've seen as your limits.

Being open to change is the first step to making it happen and you're already there. Keep going!"
offmychest,fdl98ns,t3_elw18f,1578519201.0,"What helped you connect with your online friends? Like what do you do together? There may be a way to take that type of interaction and bring it offline so you can make friends who live closer to you.

Physical attraction only matters in romantic/sexual relationships. Starting with one of those with no friends is not a great move anyway you talk about wanting to feel needed/wanted/noticed. That doesn't require anything sexual.

Volunteer for an animal shelter. The people will be grateful and the animals will love you unconditionally.

It sounds like your parents haven't set you up for success here but you have the power to work towards the future you want despite that."
offmychest,fdkvg9l,t3_elkbeu,1578511983.0,You saw him regularly and shared physical touch. It makes sense that you're feeling the loss of that connection.

dating_advice,fc6pzt9,t3_egghn2,1577486560.0,"If you meet one person and they (metaphorically) smell like shit, they might be a shitty person, but if MOST people (in this case women) smell like shit when you meet them, check the bottom of your own shoe. You are bringing the shit with you."
dating_advice,fc6pkyt,t3_eggjwh,1577486266.0,"You are allowed to want more than he is willing to give.

 Wanting emotional connection (and to be in a relationship officially) is not the same as being emotionally dependant. Seeing my husband once or twice a week without any official status wouldn't be enough for me. We both decided we wanted to spend more time together, then that dating was a good idea (after I waffled for a few days), then marriage, and now we share a home, a dog, and most parts of our lives. We can go out and do things independently, but we mostly choose to do things together.

This guy sounds like he doesn't want to share any more of his life with you then a few evenings a week. For someone, that might be perfect/enough. Or maybe once he meets someone he's more into, he'll want more. Either way, you've been open about what you want and he's not interested. Only you know what to do with that information, but your desires aren't inherently unhealthy in my mind."
dating_advice,fc6oriv,t1_fc6k68n,1577485686.0,"Since you are specifically looking for marriage and kids down the line, I want to point out that you are currently in the age range when many people who used to be thin no longer are because their metabolism slows down and they have less time to dedicate to exercise. No judgement, just keep in mind that this trend will continue as people age and especially for many once kids enter the picture so basing your search on an attribute that is likely to change over time may not get you what you want.

If looks are truly that important to you, keep on keeping on. I only hope you aren't someone who would leave a partner because they gain weight as they age."
