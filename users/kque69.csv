mildlyinfuriating,feirmp7,t3_epdfv0,1579145462.0,Why donâ€™t they go digital? .10 per page may not seem like much but to families that canâ€™t afford lunch for their kids that isnâ€™t going to be cost they can afford either- that will add up depending on the teacher.
LesbianActually,fef35eq,t3_el6j9k,1579047073.0,Thought you two were just so cute and I wanted to learn more so Iâ€™m bingeing your podcast. Love listening to you two and Iâ€™m learning a lot!

photopea,fe5pphw,t1_fe5nto5,1578872719.0,Iâ€™ve tried that the mandala still remains on the outside- I havenâ€™t found any option for removal except the erase tool
photopea,fe5i7tk,t3_enq81h,1578869783.0,It doesnâ€™t allow me to select it only erase. Thanks but I guess Iâ€™m going to have to hit up someone on 5ver
photopea,fe4ccho,t1_fe3k3wu,1578857791.0,"They are in layers. The problem is removing the mandala from outside the bear layer. I only want it to appear within the bear.  I can use the erase tool, but isn't there an easier way to delete all the background?"

bigseo,fdl3143,t3_elxjz6,1578516197.0,"If you can possibly stay at Siteground, I would highly recommend it. Do NOT move off to Blue Host or Host Gator - they are owned by the same company. They are AWFUL!! Plus you are almost guaranteed to be hacked.  I would agree with your speed assessment, but I haven't had any better luck on any other server.  Be aware that the same company owns Blue Host and many other low quality, cheap hosts. You can see the list here:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance\_International\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_International_Group)"
