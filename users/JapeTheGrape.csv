depression,feag32a,t1_fe2ylo4,1578948238.0,"Thanks for this reassurance. I start work again tomorrow but I feel exhausted since I went through some stuff during Nov/Dec of last year and emotionally I'm tired. I only started enjoying my vacation with friends around 3-4 Jan. 

As for work, I had to book my session from 2pm as her doors close at 5, when I usually finish work. I'm planning on doing 2 sessions a month for the first 3 months, then moving towards 1 per month as my medical plan allows for 15 sessions a year free of cost."

depression,fch99zs,t3_eh41bc,1577648470.0,"This is how I usually feel with almost everything. Because of my anxiety and ability to over-think, i feel like I need to keep contact otherwise they will think I hate them and will stop talking to me."
depression,fch909j,t1_fcfykky,1577648388.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read and reply. I really appreciate all the effort. 

I wasn't dependent at all. I only got to see her on weekends and we were always talking and making jokes. If things got tough or emotional we were both there to help eachother. When I had family issues and with my uncles suicide, she was there. When she was suicidal and saying how she doesn't deserve me, I was there. When she needed space, I gave her space. 

I had plenty of time already to work on myself. I had a really bad break up in 2018 and I spent an entire year single and doing what I love. I moved to the dream city i've always wanted to live in. I changed my job and moved. 
I know she can take care of herself, but she still needs a lot of help and her family isn't exactly doing that. She doesn't need me and she doesn't need a relationship, but she needs friends. She doesn't have many because she acts out due to her chemical inbalance and pushes people away then gets hurt when people stay away. 

I'm struggling right now to understand, If I should stay away or I should try and let her know that I want to be part of her life, even if we just stay friends, because I've grown to love her unconditionally and I like her for who she is (with all her problems and life traumas)."
science,fcfvmz9,t3_eh3rt5,1577634174.0,"I don't have depression, but I do have anxiety and it's helped better than alcohol which I've been trying to cut back on since I found it makes my anxiety worse and I can get more emotional if I've had a recent trauma (Beer and Wine are fine though)."
depression,faoo7q4,t3_ea539h,1576268770.0,"I've been feeling like this recently. My GF left me recently due to her battling depression and bipolar disorder. She thought it was best I give her some space. I have little interest in anything. Finish work for the year is hard. I'm not even excited for my own birthday (28 December) nor am I excited to see my parents for Christmas. 

The only way I seem to have a little fun is when my flatmates and friends have some beers & wine, but I quickly found out I become even worse when I'm drunk. 

I'm not diagnosed with depression (unlike my ex), but I've been extremely depressed. I do believe I have anxiety as a medical disorder, I just haven't gone for tests. 

I found that I feel slightly better when I go for long walks and listen to music. Preferably in cool weather."
