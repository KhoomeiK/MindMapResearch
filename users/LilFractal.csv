Not only does the flag not have Jesus's name on it, it doesn't even have a cross. The persecution of Christians never ends in this nation. Ironically it was founded by deists who lived their lives cowering in fear of an almighty god who is technically one-third Jesus by weight (not volume; contents may settle during shipping.)"

Citation needed. I'm aware there was likely *someone* at *some point* named Yeshua who was called a prophet.

It is also my understanding that none of the New Testament was set down in writing while anyone with a personal knowledge of that individual still lived.

Mind sharing that ""documented proof""?

[Here is what I take to be the current consensus outside of Christian bookstores.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#Historical_existence) Based on that, it would be more accurate to say there is no factual basis for *rejecting* the historicity of Jesus."

You don't seem to understand that kindness ceases to be kindness and becomes an obligation when it is made mandatory.

I am kind to others freely and without obligation. You apparently would rather force others to be ""kind"" rather than do it yourself and leave others to act as they please. Strange kind of kindness, that.

Fortunately, no one asked whether you had any suggestions to improve ""first come, first serve"". I expect that will continue to be a thing and your proposed ""moms and dads to the front"" will never be adopted.
