I look 10x shittier as a person if I bail on her wedding stuff, or leave her right before her wedding and make her emotional.  I know that she will definitely feel very sad when I end things.  I don’t want to make her sad before the wedding, you know?  I feel like I can’t have that in my conscience.  I know that doesn’t really add up when you consider the things she’s done to me, and how sad she makes me feel on a daily basis, but... yeah."

relationship_advice,ff5cdsv,t1_ff5c54j,1579587131.0,"You’re certainly right.  I’m currently in therapy, working through a lot of childhood trauma that resulted in me accepting relationships in which I’m the “doormat”.  I am definitely working on getting better so that I don’t fall into these kinds of relationships anymore."

I’ve been in denial over the fact that I’m probably *absurdly* lactose intolerant for years.  But now that I’ve started to gradually cut out dairy/lactose, I’m now realizing that if I have even just a little bit of dairy my stomach hurts like a bitch.  This is so exciting!"

selfhelp,fdcdfsk,t3_ekj0ip,1578272203.0,"One of the most difficult things I’ve had to learn to accept is that most of the time, there is no “why.”
We can drive ourselves mad with thinking of a thousand reasons why.   We could think of hundreds of reasons that put us at peace, but we could also think of a hundred reasons that make us hurt even more.  It’s not fair to torture yourself with the “why”.
Healing hurts, it does, but the first step is to let go of the “why” and accept that things are over.  It’s hard and it sounds way less boring/more difficult than whatever else we’d usually like to do after a breakup, but I promise you that the acceptance of it really is the defining step towards helping yourself improve.

Look back fondly, with appreciation.  Or, look back with an anger that fuels you into loving yourself more fiercely than ever.   Or a mix of both.  Whatever pushes you forward.

Do you have a hobby you haven’t paid as much attention to?  Give it your attention.  Do you have a book or a movie or a show you’ve been telling yourself to watch/read, but haven’t gotten around to it?  Get around to it, now.   Plunge yourself into doing things instead of just saying you’ll do them.  It helps.  A lot."

selfhelp,fct6p3u,t3_eiox63,1577934296.0,"Yes.  Everyone could benefit from mental health support.  Just like physically, it’s good to see a doctor for wellness visits.  Doctors aren’t reserved for “sick” people only, and mental health support kind of goes the same way.  It especially sounds as though your difficult living situation is directly impacting your mental health, so you should definitely seek out help if it’s available."

SuicideWatch,fcpd3w3,t3_eieayu,1577858928.0,"I don’t know.  I’m dancing on a weird tightrope right now between wanting so desperately to be dead, and wanting so desperately to live.  I don’t know which side I’m going to fall on.  I don’t know which side I *want* to fall on.

I’ve been battling suicidal thoughts since I was roughly 7 or 8 years old, so I had never been on this tightrope before.  I had always been on the side of wanting to be dead.  I could be happy as hell, and still have those wretched thoughts of ending my life creep into my head.  I don’t know why.  I thought everyone had the occasional suicidal thought until a couple of newer friends who also have depression/anxiety told me it wasn’t normal.  Something that I had previously laughed at had become something very scary within seconds.  I cried.

I’m getting help now, which is great, I guess.  I feel like I’m crazy because of the thoughts, though.  I sometimes wish I had continued going through life believing everyone felt the same way about wanting to die...about feeling guilty about your own existence...all of the things we talk about on this sub, etc.

I used to be relatively open about a suicide attempt I was hospitalized for, but now I find myself being deeply ashamed and afraid to talk about it—even to my therapist.  It’s weird."
exmormon,fcpcenc,t3_eict4e,1577858142.0,"It’s wild to me how much this sub has grown.  I deactivated my old reddit account a week or so ago, but had been subbed on it since late 2016-early 2017 I believe.  This had always been a “safe space” for me, being the only exmo in my family.  Even with the community being far bigger now, I still feel that way, and it was one of the first subreddits I joined again when I made this account.

You guys are fucking great."
bi_irl,fcpbtx1,t3_egvdap,1577857532.0,"Only mildly related, literally like last weekend, one of my girl friends that I’ve been crushing on for a long time was joking with me about how she couldn’t date me as much as she wanted to because I was “out of her league”.  She usually uses pretty self-deprecating humor when we’re together, but she had never ever implied dating before.  
Assuming she was at least somewhat serious,  I asked her if she wanted to actually go on a date because I felt the same about her (being out of my league), and she told me she was joking and that she was straight.

I‘m still embarrassed as fuuuck.  rip.  She and I had kissed a couple years ago and I assumed that she was also bi.  I told her it was fine and that I hoped I hadn’t made her uncomfortable, but she hasn’t spoken to or texted me or anything since."

YouOnLifetime,fcake7o,t1_fcak588,1577570919.0,"I agree wholeheartedly.

I’ve had a hard time enjoying this show after delving into the fan base after I watched the first season.  I love thrillers, mostly because it brings to light how disgusting certain people can be.

If I recall, even Penn Badgley has had to outwardly tell the fan base that we should not like Joe, and that he is quite simply a bad human.  There is no grayness."
YouOnLifetime,fc9xvuk,t1_fc9ja8h,1577559838.0,"Gaslighting is a painfully common abuse tactic that causes a victim to question their sanity or simply believe something that didn’t happen.

ie. an abuser(*cough*Love*cough*) might say, “I can’t believe you don’t remember killing her!” or “You don’t remember killing her?” or “You definitely killed her, trust me.”"

Also, your interpretation of childhood trauma is frankly incredibly disturbing.  Childhood trauma like that does not create serial killers.

Also? Stop comparing these *serial killers* to animals/lions.  What’s up with that?  They’re humans with the unique ability to reason, not wild animals.  They’re not “protecting their own”.  They’re killing, mostly for their own personal benefit.  There’s not a free pass for that."
YouOnLifetime,fc7pcit,t1_fc7ilmj,1577515071.0,"“On the outside, this show seems like a show about some psycho stalker or whatever. But it's not even close. This is a very complex show.”

...My friend, that’s because this show *is* about a stalker.  To say it’s not even close to being about that is simply deflecting the *literal genre* of the show.  It’s a thriller.  It’s about Joe Goldberg, who is a sociopathic stalker.

“My 2 cents advice, would be to stop being ignorant and seeing Joe's character through a black and white lens. Right and Wrong, etc etc. That's not it.”

You seem incredibly frustrated over this, almost like you’re trying to seem like you’re more woke than the other viewers.  It’s not being ignorant for a viewer to decide whether Joe is good/right or bad/wrong.  The character himself was written intending for viewers to question him—most people are already seeing him in gray areas, but there are still those who have chosen to view him in a more polarizing light.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  To decide your interpretation of a character is not “being ignorant”.  It’s called consuming a piece of media subjectively.  I’m one of those people who sees Joe in black/white.  I think Joe is a heinously bad human, and I hate him.  My moral compass will only allow me to view him that way.  Some people may feel differently—and that’s okay.  It’s all about interpretation.  Different interpretation from your own =/= ignorance.

To me, there is no “gray area” when it comes to being a SERIAL KILLER.  Childhood trauma is not a free pass to fucking kill people, for fuck’s sake.  I’ve been through severe childhood trauma as well.  Do I intend on killing people? No.  Because it’s wrong.  Being “extremely damaged” and thus killing people is not “Reality”.  If that were the case, there’d be a whole lot more serial killers out there.  Serial killing is not a “gray area”."
