AskReddit,ff1wjld,t1_feyjmpf,1579487797.0,"Years and years and years ago when the Web was a brand new thing, me and a couple of my friends started one of the very fist commercial websites. The domain name cost us $175, our buddy ran the server off of his desktop in his dorm room, and we were convinced that our idea was a good one: A repository for video game cheats, help, and advice.

We were young enough to still play those older games but old enough to have a few bucks, so our idea was we maintain it until we figure out a way to make money from it, but we wanted it to be free for everyone.

We even set up a system where people could submit their own cheats or hints and other users could vote them up or down, much like we do here today.

Sadly real life showed up and killed our idea with two strokes. In one, we simply found that running a website — even one with no more than a few hundred users a month — was expensive, especially when the university found out about it and started charging for bandwidth, and secondly when a (now-defunct) magazine that had the same name as our domain slapped us with a copyright suit. We would have won, I think, but we had no money for a lawyer. We consulted with a friend's dad and ended up settling for like $2500 each and surrendered the rights.

The end."
nfl,ff1vwmy,t1_ff1tbia,1579487372.0,"I imagine it's something like what Seahawks fans felt a few years ago.

I know, Chiefs have been waiting for longer than most people I know have been alive, however the Chiefs have also (almost) always had a good enough team, (almost) never had terrible seasons (I won't talk about 2008 if you don't) and were a team that often won out over the teams that otherwise seemed unstoppable. There have been many times that the Seahawks would lose to the Chiefs in an otherwise successful season. I mean, the Chiefs were always in the mix.

Then there's the Seahawks, who were the butt of jokes even in their hometown. For awhile tickets could be traded for a six-pack of delicious IPA. They were the only team (and still are) to make the playoffs with a losing record. Add to that the loss of the Sonics and the continuing depression that is the Mariners and you've got a town that's just kind of over it, save the real sports fans.

But then the Beast Quake did something, and they found a momentum that just kept going, and it brought them, eventually, to win the Super Bowl.

So while the Chiefs were out longer, the relief felt by the fans must be about the same as that felt by we in the Emerald City. They come from different places, and the paths that the teams took isn't really comparable, but damn that feeling is a good one, and as a fan of the team that the [Chiefs find a way to beat](https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/seattle-seahawks/teamvsteam?opp=16) even when they're at their best, and as a fan of hating the wretched 49ers, we're happy to share that feeling with you.

I'm running a little late, so they're all already at the place. I pull up, get out of my car, and two of my friends inside saw me and waved. I waved back.

I walked around to the front and into the place and they seemed surprised to see me. Then one of them said, ""Where the fuck have you been? It's almost half time!""

I said that I was stuck in traffic but there's no way it's half time.

""No, did you go to the ATM or something?""

After some more back and forth we pieced it together: They saw me park, get out of my car, and walk to the front of the building, but the time between when they lost visual contact with me and the moment I walked in was about 45-50 minutes, even though I was walking and didn't stop.

No flashing lights, no aliens, nothing like that, I was just missing a bit less than an hour in a walk that should take under a minute. I'm still freaked out by this, and a couple of those guys never really treated me the same after that.

Yeah? No. I've been there. It's drugs and mental health 95% of the time. 

Some people are so addicted and have no resources so they turn to petty crime. That, combined with high rent prices, leads to homelessness.

Others simply can't function in a tolerable way without certain medications and/or therapies. Many mentally ill people refuse these, and that makes them unemployable and makes it almost impossible to create the stability needed to maintain a home. This leads to homelessness.

Worse, many mentally ill people self medicate with drugs, making them both addicted and victims of illness, which further compounds the problem.

The Horatio Hornblower pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps notions that people who are homeless or in poverty is because of a lack of education or lack of contraception (!?) is a Nixonian fallacy. 

While I do think that the idea of giving the homeless homes will cut down on the many of the problems it won't cut down on all of them. We need comprehensive mental health and addiction services available, and we need to get over the idea that it's inhumane to treat those who don't wish to be treated.

In addition, it needs to be on a national level, as doing it locally only would either lead to an influx of homeless ex-pats, or an exodus of homeless to other areas which isn't solving the problem but merely pushing it out of our sight."

ChinaTime,femd0yh,t1_fembuz6,1579249258.0,"> one way moves the date wheel the other moves the gmt hand by itself.

That's exactly what I was hoping. Not all sub-$100 GMTs do that, but the good ones do. It's one of the things I love about mine."

I'd put it up pound-for-pound against any other watch, auto or quartz. And damn do they look good. The cost of quality reps is coming down, which makes it a lot of fun, because you can fuck up and not go broke. Take a look around, crack a beer, and help us make fun of those reptime snobs."

frugalmalefashion,fem22fi,t1_felukkv,1579237211.0,Nope. This watch is not worth remotely that price.

Also, check that tie, it’s a bit long, try to get the point to hit the middle of your belt buckle."
