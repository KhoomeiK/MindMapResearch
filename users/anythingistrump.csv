Documentaries,ferovx0,t1_ferir8r,1579356647.0,"Absolutely no one? That's just not true. I live in a southern town that tourists love and many people have summer or vacation homes, mostly Floridians. Moonshine is very popular with locals and visitors. They bring it out when they have a get together, usually after everyone's a few beers in. It has a kind of mystique surrounding it, and theres the factor of you can't even get this special stuff their friend makes. It's very trendy. Most poeple don't try to get drunk off it primarily. You pass it around, take a couple hits and it burns a lot. Tastes amazing, imo. It's mostly just for the taste and experience."

Down the hill in front of my house there's a few trees they really like. Two or three will just stay at the top dropping the seeds for hours while a few others gather them on the ground and hide them. It's like a factory assembly line designed for maximum production."

IdiotsInCars,fdc2vg9,t1_fdc0b3s,1578266010.0,"We're talking about something different bro. This is the parent comment:

""They don't crash going in a straight line. Go watch some mustang crash videos. What you'll quickly notice is that almost everytime someone crash like this, it's because they accelerated too hard before they were completely straightened out. You can't just gun it when your turning like you can in a honda civic, too much power to. The reason you see this with mustangs more than anything is simply because of how affordable they are. $5k can get you a decent 08 gt making 300 hp which makes it a great value for inexperienced drivers. And most of these people are coming from something like a Honda civic or Ford focus with 150 hp so you can see how it makes a recipe for disaster. Sorry for rant, just see it happen so often I can literally tell if someone is going to crash by the time they start accelerating"""

IdiotsInCars,fdam1ho,t1_fdafgrz,1578247539.0,"At lower speeds with open throttle, the car just doesn't perform as well as practically any other newer car with decent power, due to the solid rear axle. It's a huge contributing factor in mustang crashes. They changed to a modern lsd rear a couple years ago, but historically, the car was designed to only go fast in a straight line."
