progresspics,ff93xid,t3_eqn03e,1579704249.0,"There is no such thing as ""metabolism slowing down"" or speeding up for that matter. That's a myth.

What happened is that you ate more, or moved less, or a combination of the two.

I'm happy for you, but know that ultimately you have the power to decide what you want to look like. It's not up to some mysterious ""metabolism.""

progresspics,ff93jt7,t1_fezqrg2,1579703980.0,"So much fatlogic in this post. No thyroid condition or lack of access to fresh produce can create fat from thin air. Excess fat is from eating more food than your body needs, and that's it."
fatlogic,ff92hf0,t3_es20yb,1579703222.0,"LMAO! Says ""I'm mostly in good health"" then immediately admits she has chronic joint and muscle pain.

Mystified that she didn't have these pains when she weighed 100 pounds less.

Sadly delusional."

You were fat, but could still do some lower level physical activities that didn't challenge your body.

You wanted to increase your activity. You realized that you were too fat to do that. You lost weight so your fat would stop hindering you.

Exactly."

fatlogic,fesitzh,t1_fes4wqs,1579365684.0,"No, overweight people fool themselves about their ability to be *optimally* active.

Only a delusional person would pretend that 40 pounds of flab wasn't a serious drag on becoming a good mountaineer, raft guide or ski instructor.

Sure, you believed you could perform adequately in those roles while near obese, but who wants to be merely adequate? Who wants to be sub-optimal?"

I find the comments here overwhelmingly positive and life affirming when it comes to taking control of yourself and encouraging others to do so. On the other hand, fatlogic is rightfully trashed and ridiculed as the death-promoting cult that it is."

An alternative solution: if you really can't bear to eat less, then up your exercise. Spin class, boxing, ice skating? A fresh workout might just be what you need."

Unfortunately, hurpling along then stopping to catch your breath every few hundred yards is not ""going faster than a walk."""

fatlogic,fcxcp81,t1_fcuj58l,1578059338.0,Not totally false - I should have qualified that the studies found thay people usually lose body heat through their head *because* they are normally fully clothed otherwise. Like in the example of the girl going out in normal winter clothes but with wet hair and no head covering. Of course if you went out in the snow in shorts you'd lose heat proportionally through your legs.
fatlogic,fcthufm,t1_fct5fli,1577943781.0,"Yes. Same thing if it's too hot. Any temperature extreme stresses and weakens the body, making infection more likely."
fatlogic,fcthn6d,t1_fcsna80,1577943586.0,Your mom is just skipping a few steps in the logic chain. Colder temps stress the body by forcing it to work harder to maintain body heat. Wet hair is especially damaging as most of your body heat is actually lost through your head. When the body is stressed your resistance to infection weakens. Hence colds.
