soccer,ff6ncir,t1_ff6lkrl,1579630871.0,"Missed the Liverpool-Real Madrid CL Final in 2018. The bar I was at was worried that people would start fighting so they were not showing it on the TVs there. By the time I found out, kickoff was in 5 minutes and I was hammered. I left the bar and walked down the street looking for somewhere that was showing the game. Finally found a Wendy‚Äôs that had the game on after an hour or so. Missed the first half and had to watch the second half at a table at Wendy‚Äôs surrounded by screaming kids. Ended up in tears after Liverpool lost and walked all the way back to the hotel.

Oh and I was at the bar for a friends birthday while we were all at the beach for vacation. So I missed his birthday celebration as well."

I tried to flush and the entire bowl filled with water. Stupidly I tried to flush again and water and shit started pouring all over the floor. I told my friend about it and he told his mom and she came into the bathroom to clean everything up. Awkwardly I stood behind her and watched as she cleaned up my shit off the floor. 

She immediately drove me home afterwards and dropped me off at my front door. Didn‚Äôt say a word the entire car ride."
