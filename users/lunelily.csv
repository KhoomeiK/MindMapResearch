Asexual people don’t experience sexual attraction to anyone, period. It’s not that we have “low libido”, it’s that we never feel sexually attracted to anyone else. We never get turned on by the thought of having sex with a particular person, never get turned on by the sight of a naked body or any parts thereof, never ache/yearn/desire to have sex with anyone... That’s not part of what we desire in a long-term relationship.

There are some people who genuinely *cannot* get it right, no matter how hard they try, and it’s not my job (or kind, or helpful, or necessary) to remind them that their English is sub-par. 

When I read your rant, I got a clear sense that you feel it’s not fair to you that others had the ability to learn English well without all the effort and sacrifice it took you. You’re right. It’s not fair. And on top of that, it’s most certainly not others’ right or responsibility to tell you you ought to go to speech therapy when you mess up. 

But similarly, it’s not your right or responsibility to tell the random 11-year-old, dyslexic adult, stoned teen, retiree, etc. who you saw comment on a YouTube video that they used the wrong “their/they’re/there” or spelled “definitely” wrong. You might feel like you’re making the world a better place. But honestly? Doing that only annoys people at best, and hurts them at worst. Especially if they’re like you, and they just can’t get it quite right, even though they’ve desperately tried.

I can understand why your past can make you feel bitter and frustrated when you see other people make egregious mistakes in their writing and *not* get told off or mocked for it (like you do when you make mistakes in speech). It sounds like you feel like you worked so hard and missed out on so much, that you feel you earned a right to correct them. 

But why embody what you hate? 

You clearly bristle at being condescendingly corrected with the underlying “you should know better, like I do” attitude. Yet you’re wearing the very attitude you hate like armor. And over time, being surrounded by something you immensely dislike will only fuel bitterness.

Let perfection go. Your English isn’t perfect. Never has been, never will be. Own that—and fuck everyone who tried to make you feel bad for it. If you want to learn ASL and ditch English for good, more power to you. If you want to try to learn ASL and retain some English too, that’s great. But whatever you do, my best advice is for you to stop letting annoying, condescending strangers get under your skin...and to stop being that annoying, condescending stranger yourself :P"

deaf,fegwe3i,t3_ep13zq,1579104023.0,"(I am a hearing ally, so please prioritize d/Deaf voices above my own.)

Thank you very, very much for asking about this rather than just doing it! That shows you guys are really thoughtful and have the best intentions.

I agree with other people here. Instead of making the focus a lack of ability (cloth covering the mouth), you should make the focus a lack of effort/understanding on the part of *hearing people.* The Deaf community have no problem expressing their thoughts—it’s hearing people who don’t know (and refuse to learn) their language. If you want to shed light on the communication barrier, make it clear that Deaf people are perfectly capable of being understood—they just need hearing people to make the effort to understand.

Plus, the cloth analogy isn’t quite right because Deaf people do use their mouths to communicate:

1. Some are voice on (do speak). 
2. Even for folks who exclusively sign, facial expression (including mouth movements) is a HUGE part of ASL, much like tone in English. For example, the sentence “I’m so sad” can have two VERY different meanings in two different tones in English (genuine or sarcastic)—and with two different facial expressions in ASL :P

So yeah, maybe you can make your dance more about the struggle of a Deaf person to find a hearing person willing to listen/try to understand...and the relief/peace/comfort of finding someone who does speak your language.

But again: I’m just a hearing ally, so it’s quite possible my idea is also offensive to d/Deaf people—please consider their opinions most of all."

And don’t forgot to add to the list all the babies, toddlers, and little kids who were born to Christian families, but died too young to understand what Christianity is...all damned to writhe in agonizing hellfire for years upon decades upon millennia...because they were separated from God.

(At this point, I’m sure even most Christians who claim to hold OP’s beliefs would backpedal, saying God *must* have an exception for those poor, innocent babies and children...even if no such exception exists in the Bible :P)

But the separation=damnation faith doesn’t bother me just because it’s holier (haha) than Swiss cheese. What bothers me most is that it has real-world consequences: it makes people believe and act as though **nothing good you do in life matters** *unless* you believe in God. In their eyes, it’s ultimately worthless if you are an incredibly wonderful person who even just so happens to follow all the Christian commandments because you intrinsically ethically believe that that’s the right way to behave—nope, to hell with you! Such a pity your life was wasted! Because good behavior only counts if you do it for “God,” not simply for the sake of your fellow human beings, or for an intrinsic sense of ethical responsibility that you should make the world a better place.

I arrived at the conclusion that I should do good and treat other living things with love and respect out of my own brain. Not because I expect an eternal reward for it, but simply because it is the right thing to do. I don’t need to be coerced with the promise of heaven or the threat of hell. I do as much good as I can, knowing full well that when I die, everything that makes me think and feel, i.e. that makes me who “I” am—my brain, my hormones, my glands, my muscles, everything—will cease to experience, and therefore “I” will cease to experience. The afterlife is no more or less than the pre-life: nothing at all. So to my knowledge, the only thing that matters in life is how we live it with care for other living, experiencing things: how much we love each other, how much good we do, how much we improve the lives of others, and how much we take advantage of the life we have.

TL;DR live for each other, not for the promise of a future reward or the threat of a future punishment."

But I just want to make it clear that this is a common fear that needs research to dispel, because people have been repeating it for the past century and using it as an excuse to deny Deaf people the right to learn and use sign languages. Even in schools for the deaf today, use of ASL is oppressed (prohibited and can get you in trouble) due to the false belief that signing inhibits the use of spoken and written English.

Also, a language does not have to be spoken to qualify as a language. **American Sign Language is a recognized language that has its own vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.**

https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/grammar.htm

For this reason, being fluent in ASL is entirely different from just signing every word you would speak aloud in a sentence in English. (The latter is called Pidgin Signed English, PSE).

ASL also has other linguistic features like regional dialects—aka “accents”—and unique puns (e.g. jokes about how the signs for “coffee” and “make out” are very similar). 

Plus, unlike American English (which is most closely related to, and almost the same as, British English), ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language, while BSL (British Sign Language) is entirely different from ASL. ASL and BSL users find it impossible to understand one another because their languages are so different."

Plus, these benefits are correlated with higher IQ years later in life (second grade).

https://www.signingtime.com/resources/research/#infantsA

There has been a *huge*, very aggressive amount of fear-mongering over the past century that the use of ASL or other sign languages will hinder the development of speech or writing skills. But that fear is unfounded. ASL is a language just like any other. Does a child who learns Spanish as a two-year-old have a harder time learning English as a three-year-old? Not really—they might still prefer Spanish at first, but very soon they become bilingual :) And even *infants* can learn and use sign language! When you’re that young, all language gets soaked up like a sponge and helps your brain form new types of connections that your monolingual peers don’t have. 

TL;DR teaching your baby two languages (one of which is a sign language) is better than only teaching them one spoken language—it gives your baby a head start, making them smarter and better at using language in general, even later in life."

IMO, every meat-eater should be like you—they should take responsibility for where their meat comes from, recognizing that each individual animal they choose to eat has its own personality and deserves to be treated as such.

We do have ethical differences; I do think that farming and killing another being that has enough awareness to fear/protest death—assuming we don’t really *need* to kill them because we could get an equivalently nutritional meal from less sentient sources with only slightly more effort—is intrinsically inhumane at some level.

However, I also recognize that some methods of animal farming and killing are relatively more humane than others. So if the practice of killing animals for food is to continue—and for the foreseeable future, it will—then it should be done as humanely as possible. People should buy less from factory farms who treat the animals as unfeeling commodities, and more from small farmers like you, who raise their animals as individuals with respect and compassion.

lgbt,fcubx2j,t1_fctsnu2,1577977379.0,"Um. Wearing a sticker in an LGBTQ+ safe space—a sticker that you can choose what to write on to advertise your sexuality so that more of the right kinds of people for you hit on you...is, in your mind, the same as being forced to wear clothing that identifies you as gay by a group of people who consider you a criminal and are determined to wipe your kind from the planet? 

I don’t understand that comparison at all. Especially since everyone (including any cisallohets) would be wearing a sticker, so you wouldn’t be able to tell from a distance who’s part of the community and who isn’t; you’d have to get up close enough to read each person’s sticker.

Also, the cool thing about stickers (rather than clothing, pins, etc) is that at any moment, they can be ripped off and discarded."

I just think it would be really neat to be able to find someone else who I know is like me just by looking. (There is supposedly pretty recognizable gay and lesbian fashion, so maybe it’s not too hard for you to tell...but no such style for aces :c)"

science,fcr5b7y,t1_fcr1fmo,1577896991.0,"Consenting to have sex is not consenting to become pregnant (even though that’s a risk), much like consenting to walk in the dark late at night is not consenting to getting mugged (even though that’s a risk)."
science,fcr4cje,t1_fcr0wgd,1577896602.0,"I think human life begins at conception, and should be considered and treated accordingly. But I also don’t think your human right to life entitles you the right to use someone else’s body in order to live."
science,fcr43h0,t1_fcr0746,1577896489.0,"Oooooo, I like this argument as well. It’s an attempt to substitute a person (who is conscious and able to consent) for a fetus (who is arguably neither). 

However, there is an important distinction between this case and the case of a pregnant person: and that is that the “host” body that these two people depend on to survive belongs to *both of them equally.* This is not a case in which Anne’s body is supporting Beth’s body; rather, Anne and Beth both share a single body, which they came into possession of at the same time and have equal rights over. Therefore Beth has just as much right to the host body as Anne does, and both of their consent is needed for any surgical procedure.

But in the case of a fetus, the fetus does not share equal rights to the mother’s body as she does; the host body is wholly *her* body, not the fetus’s. The fetus has its own body, distinct and separate, and has no ownership or decision rights whatsoever over the mother’s. Therefore, if the mother decides to remove the fetus from her because she does not consent to the fetus being inside her (and as such, the fetus’s presence violates her bodily autonomy), the procedure to remove the fetus from her requires only her consent, not the fetus’s."
science,fcr1725,t1_fcqyzjg,1577895258.0,"I really like your counterpoint here. I’ve heard punitive arguments before (“it’s your fault you got pregnant, you deserve to have to go through it”), to which I reply that sex is not a crime, and certainly not one that justifies stripping you of a fundamental human right. 

But your argument is not exactly punitive—it’s more of an appeal to the responsibility to be a Good Samaritan.

Thanks very much for the pondering material. I’ll have to think over it and get back to you."
science,fcqwylb,t1_fcqrkca,1577893477.0,"Nobody has any right to use anyone else’s body against their will—even if their life depends on it.

If you were my biological parent and I needed your blood in order to be able to continue to grow and survive, I would have no right to it, much less a right to forcibly take it from you over a nine-month period, putting you at risk for all kinds of complications, agony, and death by the end of it. 

Now, you might freely choose to go through all that so that I can live. You might even argue/believe that that’s the only right thing for a person to do in those circumstances. But that bodily sacrifice is your choice alone to make. Not the government’s—yours. That is your liberty and your responsibility. The government has no right to dictate that you must allow your body to be used by someone else."
