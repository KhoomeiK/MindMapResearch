“My husband and daughter have the right to bond so I tend to stay out of their way”   Well aren’t you a GENEROUS god huh? 

“I don’t like children and don’t want any in the future” then why did you marry someone with a child if you hate kids? Sounds like a recipe for disaster 

Telling her you also hate her? Takes a REAL POS to say that to a child that’s not even yours let alone while MARRIED TO HER FATHER.
