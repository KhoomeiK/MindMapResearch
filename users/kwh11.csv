dogs,ff2h9pf,t3_er09c4,1579506069.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you had this jarring and upsetting experience.  And I‚Äôm sorry that all these commenters had so little to offer you & so much acrimony for each other.  But it‚Äôs wonderful you & the dog found each other again!  I think the upshot is no one can give you a guarantee, but it seems very likely this dog can be happy in your home, and you with it, with some patience & love.  An older dog can still be trained, but since your experience is with puppies/younger dogs, find a calm dog trainer to help you all start speaking the same language.  (Meaning, none of these assert dominance people.)  It could take a good while for the dog to relax & feel safe, or it could bounce in the door & go to sleep like it‚Äôs been there all along.  We wish you the best, we thank you for rescuing, and we‚Äôd be grateful if you let us know what happens."

We‚Äôd be watching tv while the dogs slept, relaxing.  Then someone on tv rang a doorbell, and they erupted from their blanket and barked insanely for 10 minutes.  Scared us silly every time, but we laughed because there was no way to explain to them it was just on tv!  Just a small example of how they‚Äôve brought so much fun & happiness into our lives.
