How can you avoid this? Money. As much as people like to say “money can’t buy happiness,” it can buy time. And what you do with that time will bring you happiness. Im not saying you can’t be happy if you’re poor, but it gets way easier when you don’t have to worry about whether you’ll be eating beans and rice for the next 5 meals .A good 90% of the world lives within the boundaries of a 9-5, until they retire at 50-65 and live the rest of their lives modestly but lacking the physical or mental energy to really *enjoy* it. (That’s why they call it the top 10%) 

I’m trying to avoid sounding like a life coach/pyramid scheme marketer here, but the earlier you achieve financial independence, the better your life will be. Uni isn’t necessary but will segue yourself into a decent paying job that’ll enable you to save money quicker. Alternatively, go to trade school and learn welding or electrical engineering. When you have enough money for a down payment on a house, do your due diligence and get a good investment. Live within your means. Rent out some of your house to cover mortgage. Rinse and repeat. The more money you have the more money you earn. This is why the rich get richer and everyone else struggles to reach the top. Say you spent $100,000 on a house and it returns you $10,000 a year from rent. But someone with $1,000,000 could’ve bought 10 of those and made $100,000 a year. It’s all scaling. It’s pretty much the only way you can avoid the “work til 65” life, save for becoming a tech millionaire or winning the lottery. 

Then, with all the time and money, you can basically do anything and everything you could ever want."

todayilearned,fdtbb7h,t1_fdsgeer,1578714351.0,"So someone saying aliens don't exist is 100% right? We have no way of knowing whether he is right or wrong. To say he is right means you are assuming something about the universe that you cannot prove. Burden of proof isn't always on a positive, as reddit keyboard physicists and philosophers like to claim. Burden of proof is on someone making a claim. Just like how he claims ""reincarnation doesn't exist,"" well, can you prove that statement? No, you can't. Did gravity exist before someone proved it? If, before the discovery of the higgs boson, someone said ""the higgs boson doesn't exist."" Would they be right or wrong? By your logic they'd be right because the burden of proof is not on a negative. 

>The burden of proof (Latin: onus probandi, shortened from Onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat) is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide sufficient warrant for their position.

Notice how it doesn't specify an affirmative or a negative. Sure, people claiming god exists should prove it. But you, also, firmly stating that reincarnation doesn't exist, should prove it. But you can't, ergo, you're a hypocrite."

web_design,fdeywkt,t1_fdexdj4,1578349553.0,"> Part of programming is finding existing solutions but where programmers or engineers get paid is coming up with solutions for problems that don't already exist.

Unless you're talking about senior engineering or project management I can't see where that will be applicable. Yes, if FAANG is paying you a 500k salary, you'll be making programs that don't exist yet. But for most jobs that require <5 years experience, you're not really working with any new tech. Frontend, backend, most tasks are like ""this backend helper isn't working, fix it"" or ""add new endpoint to client."" Very rare will any new grad positions involve making breakthroughs in CS.

web_design,fde1rjv,t1_fddygau,1578329234.0,"Coding boot camps aren't really a scam. They operate on the similar grounds of trade schools in that they offer a less conventional education than college. If a trade school can supposedly make a welder in 900 hours, you could make a coder just as quickly, if not faster, because coding is leagues easier than welding. People fail at bootcamps/finding a job after because they aren't coders. Same way med school failures aren't doctors."

If your country is overrun with corrupt politicians, rich criminals and the like, it would tempt a lot of people to join in to survive.

You could for example shoplift from a grocery store if your family was starving. It’s wrong, but it’s a lesser evil and I think it makes you much less worse of a person than those who would use violence as a means to live. I agree with you, they weren’t born evil at all.
