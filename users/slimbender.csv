insaneparents,fdtz329,t1_fdtss3u,1578724613.0,"First, I should say that this comment I’m about to make is not sarcastic. You make a very fair argument. I often lack self-awareness, both here and IRL, when it comes to sarcasm, jokes, teasing, etc.

For whatever reason, when I see /s at the end of a comment, the joke ends up falling flat for me. That’s my problem, I suppose.

And now that my kids are starting to mimic some of my “humor,” I’m now uniquely able to see how fucking annoying I can be. I’ve been making an effort to filter myself differently around them, and your comment gives me more to consider. So, thank you. Know that your input here tonight is appreciated."

Not supporting Trump doesn’t make someone an HRC lover, or even a Democrat. I wish people understood that.
