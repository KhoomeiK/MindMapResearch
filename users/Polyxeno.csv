It is a fun and interesting tactical game about fighting with ancient/medieval weapons that makes your moves on the hex map important to how combat plays out and who wins. Everything follows logical representations about how and why things work.

When I later looked at 0D&D, it looked like nonsense, and an incomplete game. For the next five years, every other RPG I looked at didn't have much of what TFT offered, so we stuck with TFT until our interest in details started to outgrow it. Then GURPS came out, in 1986, designed by the same designer but with more details and possibilities. Since then, I've continued to look at other game systems, but none of them offer the tactical combat game that is one of the main things I enjoy about RPGs, and few offer mechanics that are really trying to literally represent the game situation.

So it's been easy for me to choose to stick to the games I like, because there's so little competition."

The 3e Basic Set (or 1e/2e) can be easier to learn the system with than the 4e Basic Set, as they don't have the huge amount of fantastic and non-ancient/medieval content, so they're easier to learn - an older version of the system, though.

But the exhaust port was theoretically possible to hit effectively. The Rebel Alliance didn't think they had any powerful Force users either, but were still hoping against hope for a lucky hit (because they didn't have time to fully evacuate). Both the Alliance's computers (with some hours' work) and the Death Star computers (with the benefit of seeing what the Alliance's attack pattern was) were able to analyze and determine that there was some small possibility of destroying the station with a direct hit by a proton torpedo.

I think the exhaust port probably wasn't the only one on the station, just the only one where this kind of shot could get all the way to the reactor core (on a moon-sized base that was only recently completed, it would be hard not to make any mistakes). And apparently it was not constantly blasting outward enough force to stop those torpedoes, as that was the plan without the Force being a part of the plan.

But the exhaust port was guarded by turbolaser towers, and the port was ""rayshielded"" such that an attacker needed to come at it from the side up the trench without getting shot, and score a direct hit. Neither side was sure exactly how hard that would be, but neither side thought it was very likely. At least one pilot complained it was impossible. Red Leader, presumably one of the Alliance's better pilots, tried (with targeting computer assistance) and missed. Moreover, with Darth Vader shooting down the fighters, he was the only one who got a chance and was shot down moments later.

Luke was about to be shot down, but took a few seconds longer to actually shoot down than any of the others, to which Vader comments, ""the Force is strong with this one!"" but then he locks on and is about to kill Luke when Han's ship attacks.

The OT mostly did that really well. Empire mostly did that really well. The points where it doesn't stand out and are a bit disappointing, but I can (and usually do, easily) overlook them because the rest was done with so much care.

The DT, on the other hand, is a constant insult to what I appreciate about the OT. It constantly doesn't make sense (largely because it's constantly riffing on or just aping the OT for no reason), doesn't take itself seriously, doesn't make sense, rarely feels convincing at all, and in many places is SUCH NONSENSE that it's downright offensive.

To me, it's so obvious that the DT is 99% trash that should never have been branded Star Wars, that engaging people for whom that's not obvious is mainly a sort of morbid curiosity about how it's even possible for people to not feel the same way. The most common answers seem to be that they haven't seen the OT, or didn't pay much attention to it, don't have the attention span for a less-than-frenetic film, or at least didn't like it much or didn't think it was anything special, so they either have no basis for comparison, or they're not expecting much and are comparing it to something like Guardians Of The Galaxy or worse, and so they just see the special effects and visual style and don't care that it's stupid, doesn't take itself seriously, doesn't make sense, breaks continuity with Star Wars, or makes losers of the OT stars and then kills them off for fear people won't like the new Mouseketeers.

Is Rotten Tomatoes interesting? Well, I was surprised so many reviewers wrote positive reviews of TLJ, since it's so stupid, but I expect it's because they don't want to piss off Disney. I used to edit a review publication, and boy do some publishers want to unfairly influence reviewers, even in much smaller markets. Meanwhile, let's do a little sanity check on user reviews that were actually written with text about TLJ:

\#1: 0.5/5

\#2: 0.5/5

\#3: 0.5/5

\#4: 1/5

\#5: 1/5

\#6: 0.5/5

\#7: 5/5

\#8: 0.5/5

\#9: 5/5

\#10: 1.5/5

So, 80% of the reviews with actual writing by people are severely upset by how bad TLJ is, and look about like comments here. One of the two 5-star reviews claims TLJ is ""The best studio blockbuster of the 2010s"" (full text, not even a period), which is hopefully clearly ridiculous. The other looks like a middle school essay and claims that TLJ ""shows the philosophical potential of Hollywood and the Star Wars franchise"" and ""the space battles and lightsaber duels \[...\] never felt so magical and powerful before."" I don't know what to make of that except wow... hmm. 

As for changing my mind, no, it looks like the opinion of actual people posting written reviews to RT is 80% super-negative, and 20% 5-star WTFs."

* Hosnian system's planets blowing up were visible immediately in the daytime sky on ""Maz' Cantina Planet"" which is in another part of the galaxy - that's so wrong in so many ways, it makes the whole thing terminally stupid and wrong all by itself.
* Not caring about physics or scale, left and right, obviously, blatantly, ridiculously.
* Action scenes that are ridiculously dumb and wrong in countless ways.
* Rey and Poe doing super-fake super shots killing multiple baddies at once, sometimes not even being able to see their target or requiring their victims to line up for them where they can't see them and then pressing a button at just the right time to squash distant monsters with a door, or shoot multiple TIE fighters at once, or whatever other stupid nonsense.
* ""We've blown up death stars before... who needs a plan?""
* Why did anyone ever build capital ships if they can be vaporized by hyperspace torpedoes?
* Leia in space would have been ditched by her still-accelerating ship before she woke up, so her Mary Poppins powers would not have saved her anyway.

The reason I don't play most RPGs is because I do like combat, and I don't like most RPGs' combat systems.

Some games have combat systems where the combat is a fun, interesting, unpredictable boardgame even if you only played that, and the battles become one of the main fun aspects of play. (e.g. The Fantasy Trip, GURPS)"
rpg,fdcw8nu,t3_ekm93z,1578286125.0,"Hitpoint-based combat systems, where a skilled fighter has several times more hitpoints than a serious weapon can do, are unlike the situation most games are about, in terms of realism. Some people notice this, and it breaks their immersion, their ability to relate to the games as being about what they're supposedly about, and/or their interest in the game.

Hitpoint games tend to let players know that when they have a bunch of hitpoints, they're not going to be defeated until they wear down, which will at least take several turns. And they also know that (even though the hitpoints are usually said to represent the ability to avoid actually being wounded, not actual injury) if their hitpoints get low, suddenly they're pretty sure to get taken down if something attacks them.

That certainty is nothing like the situation of facing people with weapons that could hurt you if they hit you.

So if I want to play a game that is about an armed combat situation and lets me engage that situation, hitpoint-based combat systems aren't going to do it for me.

In fact, since the games I like (e.g. The Fantasy Trip, and GURPS) offer tactical boardgames where your moves and the situation and luck are what drive success, but defeat is always a possibility, I also want many other things before I'll be satisfied with a combat system."

saltierthancrait,fd692j0,t1_fd4dn3b,1578187393.0,"All true and fine points.

For me, what I most liked about OT Star Wars was how the situations seemed pretty believable, and how well they did the action scenes, and how they seemed to take the danger seriously and do a good job of presenting deadly situations in serious ways that I could be interested in. Anakin's pod race and the final battle being ended by him accidentally destroying the enemy mothership totally undermined that for me. The Jedi being blase about danger was sort of interesting at first but also undermined that effect for me.

So to me, the post above is a bit ironic to me showing Anakin as standing on hard work. He was the Jedi who was born with so much power he didn't need to work as hard as others...

But of course, yes, the Rey situation is parsecs beyond that. She does impossible things starting with shooting a TIE fighter by aiming the entire Falcon she's never flown before to get Finn's broken gun to shoot the TIE fighter she can't see from the cockpit. Then she saves everyone from CGI monsters by pushing a button at exactly the right time to save people with a door in a situation she also can't see. Etc."
