On the issue of access from Europe, either they are losing money and don't care, or it would cost more to fix than they would make in additional advertising revenue. I've no idea how much GDPR compliancy costs a business, but it's a one off cost that will eventually turn a profit even if they only enjoy a limited number of clicks from Europeans. Plenty of other non-EU websites have decided that it makes sense to open up their service to an extra 500m consumers and allow easy access for international users whilst in Europe."

AskUK,fe7k6ah,t1_fe6pfsa,1578915722.0,"Thank you for the correction. Apparently, people often think the two are synonymous, but as you say high tea is a hot, more substantial meal; it is also served later in the day.

The reason I wrongly believed that afternoon tea and high tea were synonymous was due to personal experience. When I was a child, my mum's friend invited our family to 'high tea'. I'd never heard of high tea, but I knew what afternoon tea was. I remember my mum being a bit unsure too, but she decided that 'high tea' was probably a proper meal. In fact, when we arrived all we were offered was tea and cake. Not only did I leave hungry, but with the conclusion that high tea and afternoon tea must be the same thing after all."

AskUK,fe6d7ig,t1_fe60olw,1578887491.0,"Very few people use tea leaves. Loose tea probably represents not more than 0.1% of tea sold on the UK; it's almost all tea bags. My grandparents used to use loose tea leaves, but that was 20 years ago. It's possible that loose tea is used for afternoon tea served at nice hotels/restaurants, but that's a guess. NB. 'Afternoon tea' is actually a light meal. Google images 'afternoon tea' to see what I mean.

Edit: Corrected high tea/afternoon tea conflation, thanks to 172116, and clarified"
AskUK,fe6cst1,t1_fe5v91d,1578887177.0,Black tea (English breakfast tea) is synonymous with 'tea' in the UK. If you want black tea - anywhere other than a hotel or restaurant - just ask for 'tea'.
AskUK,fe6cmxh,t1_fe68gxp,1578887053.0,"Where do you live? In the UK we have 230V household ('mains') electricity supply. This means that electric kettles work well. I understand that the lower voltage in the US means that electric kettles don't work as well, so microwaves are more commonly used to make (hot) tea. As another Redditor said, we tend to only use microwaves to reheat hot drinks. The exception would be cocoa/hot chocolate made with milk."
