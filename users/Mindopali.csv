Should you side with him, you'll end up killing more gods than with anyone else. 

Beware the nice ones."
depression,fekybzv,t3_epiyby,1579210136.0,"One of the things we're discussing in therapy is actually the same as mentionned in the other comments, maladaptive daydreaming. I can concentrate more than 15 minutes before immersing myself in another world. I do that most of the day. I can handle the day, but I'm not watching what happens around me, I play my own film. It's a delusion to escape reality for me."
2meirl4meirl,fejy8po,t3_ephbv5,1579188572.0,"Holy hell, I have the first job, I'm actually happy I bagged one of these."
SuicideWatch,fejkje1,t3_epgivd,1579177973.0,"Agreed.

Now, I can understand people being careful and asking for a period of time to see if any therapy can work, but for the many folks that spend years if not decades in a bad state, let them decide for themselves."
depression,fejcsmc,t1_fejbzvj,1579167601.0,"I feel more like my ancestors tried to survive and that's it, their actions didn't make me as a miracle, they just spread their genes somewhere and it went on.

I don't know if I ever was a fighter, but I sure as hell am not anymore, I gave up. 

Combat sports and hiking mostly, I'm fit, even if I don't care about it anymore."
SuicideWatch,fejb263,t1_fehp490,1579164993.0,"Keeping fit, keeping hygiene, doing a job that helps others, working on my dream, going to therapy and trying meds. For 10 years.

Add regular travels, outdoors, sport clubs to meet people."
SuicideWatch,fejb0px,t1_fei1pq8,1579164934.0,"I do mind, I tried for more than a decade, and it bores me, it's my life so I can decide when to call it quits."
depression,fejazhj,t1_feht7mk,1579164884.0,"Thank you for having told your story, I wish I had words too but your pain is one I can't even fathom. 

I just hope you find some sense of hapiness, somewhere, not much else I can do."
depression,fejaxol,t1_fehnmyz,1579164813.0,Good luck mate.
depression,fejax11,t1_fehej5g,1579164787.0,Absolutely.
depression,fejawqp,t1_fei8l9k,1579164775.0," **Do not post or respond with:**  
  â€¢ General uplifting or ""it gets better"" messages.  **Encouragement is** ***not*** **helpful unless it integrates real, personal understanding of the OP's feelings and situation**. 

That's from the sidebar. Follow that line, because it's really pissing off how people think their experience works for everyone and make promises on behalf of the universe. You're not god, don't do that."
depression,fejaup8,t1_feis9t6,1579164693.0,"I did find it for a while, but it didn't make me exaclty happy nor did it make me want to live."
depression,fejaty0,t1_fei2trc,1579164662.0,"I did that, in other countries and at home, it isn't enough to make me want to live."
SuicideWatch,fehk541,t1_fegcrmt,1579118188.0,"I did want to fix my life, I only stopped recently when I decided I would rather die considering the attempts failed."
SuicideWatch,fehk38w,t1_fegcngm,1579118158.0,Try doing it for ten years and still sucking at it. By then you underqtand that some things you don't get better at.
SuicideWatch,fehk0kp,t1_fegapri,1579118116.0,"Already done, I'm way past it.

But thanks for trying."
depression,fehjyzr,t1_fegnvmt,1579118090.0,Apparently not.
depression,fehjxsr,t1_feh572c,1579118072.0,"I already attempted suicide, still planning to.

Best of luck to you"
depression,fehjvl2,t1_feghzaa,1579118035.0,"More or less, it was really more about finding a purpose. 

That is, until I realized that even that might not make me happy."
SuicideWatch,fegal4k,t1_fegad80,1579085066.0,"Had pets when I was younger, never got much interest in them. Don't know for the hapiness part, but I know what won't make me unhappy."
depression,fefy6fb,t3_eophbs,1579069179.0,"The amount of feel good bullshit in this thread is way too damn high.

I will only hope for you that if you go trough with it, you'll find a last moment of joy beforehand."
