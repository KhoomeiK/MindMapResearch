I just don’t think he realizes just how much work it’s going to be. I keep trying to tell him that it’s like having a baby, he’ll be up all night taking the puppy out to pee. Puppies have boundless energy and chew on everything etc. 

It’s in one ear and out the other. He lives with my parents, and I don’t doubt that when he gets bored or overwhelmed that they’ll step in.

But it’s so hard anticipating the train wreck. He’s an adult, and I’ve said all I can say. But I’m putting it down here and now, that dog will end up either being my or my parent’s dog in less than a year."

BravoRealHousewives,ffc5ubo,t1_ffb5bhy,1579792227.0,"Yea I wish Jackie would have said this. The impression I got was that she didn’t want to spoil her kids with lavish parties. I think this is the part that Jennifer is missing. 

I think probably what’s going on here is that Jennifer spoils her kids because her parents weren’t able to do that for her, and as a kid she always wanted more. Whereas, because Jackie’s parents were wealthy, she knows that the “stuff” doesn’t matter and she’s trying to set her kids up not to be entitled and lazy, like her parents did with her. It’s old money vs new money. 

It’s all wild speculation, and Jennifer’s counting other people’s money isn’t cute. But I think it goes deeper than what they’re showing."

In the summer after high school, I made out with some guy at a party. I didn’t know him, we were drunk and I just grabbed his face. This girl who was a friend of a friend started talking major shit about me. I guess he had just broken up with her best friend (who I didn’t know). And I remember being so turned off by the whole thing. I didn’t know him at all, we made out one time. But every time I saw him at a party afterward I avoided him like the plague because I didn’t want to be involved. 

Funnily enough, different party, I had a flirtation with a guy that amounted to us fooling around. Little did I know, he had made out with the girl who hated me on the same night! So I never spoke to him again. (I sound super slutty here. I had a make out bandit phase in my late teens post high school that lasted all of 4 months)

This whole thing with Scheana gave me major flashbacks and I’m so grateful I just bolted instead of fighting over guys I had zero interest in."

dogs,ff7mhnz,t3_erz4wm,1579653085.0,"I’m in Canada, so our walks largely depend on how cold it is. If it’s below -10, we don’t go out unless it’s very short potty walks. Even with a coat and boots, my dog just gets too cold and is generally miserable. 


Anything above -10, I usually take her out when she decides to wake up (usually around 9-10am). We go for 20-30 minutes. We head out again around 1 for 30, then again at 4 for 30. The sun starts to set after that and it gets too cold to walk. 

Spring/summer/fall we do the same schedule, but it’s more diligent (every day without fail). And I usually add a last after supper walk. We also go on longer walks, especially on the weekends.

truechildfree,ff3ajse,t3_er82qq,1579537440.0,"I think, especially for women, it's difficult to figure out exactly what we want because society makes it seem like it's a given that you'll get married and have kids. 

I want to share a bit of my thought process, maybe it'll help: 

I've been wrestling with the idea of having kids for about 5 years now. Do I really want kids? Or do I just think I want them because I've been told that my entire life? I think it's an incredibly personal decision, and one that you don't have to make right away. 

I personally, have been single for 10 years, and am about to turn 30. I doubt I'll find someone anytime soon, so my internal discussion was ""do I want kids enough to do it by myself?"" That was a resounding no. I don't have the emotional energy to be the center of someone's world. It also just doesn't sound like something I want to tackle all by myself. 

I also thought about what I knew about my parents before they had kids. My parents tried for *10 years.* Both of my parents always knew they wanted to be parents. My mom had a miscarriage before me and was devastated. So I started thinking about my wishy washy feelings about having kids, and decided that I only wanted kids if it was something I couldn't *not* do. If I felt like it was something I absolutely needed and was 100% positive it was something  I wanted. I didn't want any potential kid I might have to ever feel like they were maybe not wanted. 

I haven't had that ""oh my God I *have* to have kids"" moment. I figure if I don't get it over the next 10 years, then I wasn't meant to be a mother. If I do, then I'll take the next steps. But for now, I'm happy loving my dog and my independence.

I once got into an argument with someone I otherwise very much respect, because she told me I was wrong for not wanting to get married. She kept insisting it made the most sense financially, and was implying that couples who don't get married aren't as ""serious"" as people who are. Despite my knowing couples who have been together for decades, had kids, and were more than happy unmarried. I couldn't fathom why she gave 2 shits about what I did with my life.

dogs,fehsnay,t1_fehpv8r,1579123077.0,"The first time mine did this I was SO confused. She was “burying” her bully stick “in” her dog bed. She rarely does it anymore, but it was so cute"
BigBrother,feh7vav,t1_feh7dh0,1579110967.0,"Yep, exactly. Whenever people bitch about a salty jury, I always point to Dan. Dan backstabbed, lied, did it all. That’s why everyone says he’s the GOAT. Yet, he won because he fully explained his game and thought process to the jury."
BigBrother,feh67yf,t1_feh5z53,1579109994.0,I think it was karma for his huge ego.
BeautyGuruChatter,feh1xrn,t3_eolppa,1579107444.0,"At the very least, she’s a hoarder. I hadn’t heard of her, so looked her up. Holy shit. She buys animals on impulse and says she’s “rescuing” them despite getting them on Craig’s list (any animal you buy on CL supporting backyard breeding.) 

I don’t know anything about reptiles, but know that getting any animal on impulse is an incredibly irresponsible thing to do. 

Just to add to OP’s list. She feeds her dog a boutique grain free dog food.  If she knew anything about animals like she claims to, she would know that boutique, expensive dog brands sell you on crap like “grain free” and other lies. They don’t employ veterinary nutritionists to ensure their food are healthy and balanced."
BigBrother,fegu3q6,t3_ep1hb1,1579102566.0,"Devon’s eviction. He thought he was king if the castle, super cocky. 

Had he just stayed quiet, he would have lasted a hell of a lot longer. But he had to get cocky. So he was promptly voted out the week after his awful HOH reign."
BigBrother,fegtyx4,t1_fegs91h,1579102479.0,"Yes!!!! And voted out by an ally all because she was being mean. Had she just been nice to Sidney, she would have been fine. But being rude opened the door for Ika to convince Sidney to stab her in the back. 

It wasn’t even a good game move for Sidney."
BigBrother,fegt9v9,t1_feghz37,1579102028.0,"His big problem has always been his answering jury questions. If he had just owned his game, he would have maybe had a shot. “Yep, I lied to all of you to get here. Here was my game”. 

Instead he kept lying and insisting that he was loyal to everyone, didn’t lie, etc. If you can’t show the jury your game, you just look like you lied because it’s fun."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fegs413,t3_ep041d,1579101249.0,"Yea, I didn’t buy the break up. I was hopeful, but didn’t buy it. She would never prioritize the health and safety of her kids over her relationship"
dogs,fefg8sr,t3_eovinx,1579055680.0,Ryland Adams and Shane Dawson have a husky and a lab. They seem to be pretty decent owners too. Both dogs and their cat seem happy.
truechildfree,feeo46g,t3_enelgt,1579037687.0,"We are individuals and not a hive. 

I like kids, but I find them to be overwhelming. My cousins have like, 20 kids all together and I stopped going to big family get togethers because it’s too much. They let the kids run around and barely pay attention to what they’re doing. It’s too stressful for me. 

But I like one on one time with kids. They’re funny, cute, etc. I also love that I can give them back to their parents.

I do hate teens though. But I feel like we all do."
truechildfree,feene73,t3_eon4o7,1579037268.0,"You shouldn’t feel guilty. The way you spend your money is your business. 

I never feel guilty about my spending choices. I don’t know if this is a no kids vs having kids situation, though. It’s more of a jealousy thing. 

For instance, my uncle was a divorced dad with 3 kids. He did ok, but my mom (his sister) made more money. She and my dad are still together, so having 2 incomes helped. He had the gall to tell my grandmother that my brother and I were spoiled. I’ve literally seen him 5 times my entire life. So I have no idea how he came to that conclusion. 

I guess I’m just saying, don’t let people make you feel bad for your success."
dogs,feee2y1,t1_feedyrd,1579031852.0,Totally agreed :)
dogs,feedl1q,t1_fee8kue,1579031560.0,"I totally agree that people have to do their homework and if their dog is being negatively affected by daycare, they need to be removed. However, I think the discussion is teetering on suggesting that people who work full time hours shouldn’t be dog owners, which I disagree with. 

Perhaps I misinterpreted the conversation, my apologies."
dogs,fee7w7d,t1_fee1ggz,1579028224.0,"Eh parents do that with their kids, and nobody bats an eye. I think it’s a little gate keeper to nitpick this. If people can afford daycare, more power to then."
dogs,fee73oi,t1_fee47q0,1579027760.0,"Sure. But there are ways to mitigate the risk of an adult dog. You could foster first, you could go through a foster to adopt rescue so you know what you’re getting into. 

Getting a puppy doesn’t guarantee having a well behaved adult dog with any unwanted behaviour."
dogs,fee056v,t1_fedusp2,1579023563.0,"Amen. I’ve had dogs my entire life, but I’ve never had a puppy. NOT a puppy person. Maybe when I retire in 30 years. But for now? Never."

BGCCircleJerk,febgbcc,t3_eo95dj,1578958540.0,Thank you for sharing OP. I hope more people see this and understand why those types of comments are harmful.
dogs,feafkik,t1_feac8vn,1578948111.0,"Yea in -40, even with coats and boots, it's not worth it. 

We get weather like that here too. My dog has a coat and boots, but at about -10, our walks become very short. Anything colder, we don't go. 

Even in boots, she starts to pick up her feet, because it's so cold. I basically have to drag her the entire time. 

I walk because she loves it. When she's miserable, there's no point."
BeautyGuruChatter,fea8ogo,t3_eo8jo8,1578945675.0,"So proud of her! I really hope that she is met with lots of praise, love, and support. I'm sure she's helped countless people today."
dogs,fea7gfj,t3_eo8xv4,1578945249.0,"We play indoor games. We play lots of tug, I throw her toy up and down the stairs so she has to do the stairs. We do nose work. We proof tricks and learn new ones. etc."
dogs,fea4ju8,t1_fea41b1,1578944302.0,Well you’ve already said in another post that you called animal control and they did nothing. Your only option is to make a noise complaint.
dogs,fea1e4b,t1_fea00g2,1578943326.0,"That's fair. I just don't think what you're describing constitutes neglect. Being a shitty dog owner? Sure. But like 70% of pet owners are shitty. 

It just sounds like your intentions are more about ""getting"" your neighbor, then concern for the dogs well being. But I could wrong."
dogs,fe9xwz8,t3_eo7wc2,1578942427.0,"I don't mean to be an asshole, but it sounds like you're making an awful lot of judgments and assumptions. You're assuming that he's unintelligent, has a bad job, and is broke.

I live in the same province, 99% of people do not walk their dogs. My neighbors on either side of me never walk their dogs. In the year I've lived in my house, none of the 3 dogs has ever gone fora walk. I've also never heard the dogs outside, but they obviously go.

I guess my point is that unless you *know* the dogs are let out only twice a day and are alone for 12 hours on a regular basis, this sounds like you just don't like your neighbor.

You could report the dogs barking for hours on end. But none of what you're describing constitutes neglect."
dogs,fe98sfv,t3_eo6qfm,1578935437.0,"Some dogs are just picky. You could try leaving the food out for 30 minutes, and pick it up. That way she'll learn that she has to eat when the food is put down. Dogs don't starve themselves, so she'll learn quickly. 

You could also try making her food more interesting. Puzzle toys, snuffle mats, etc."
dogs,fe97we9,t1_fe96m7s,1578935146.0,"Anybody can write anything online, though. Which is why the  WASVA guidelines and consulting your vet are always your best options."
dogs,fe930pl,t1_fe8mbgd,1578933680.0,"Good for Bo! 

I have a reactive dog, and I totally get it. It drives me nuts too. Mine has come a long way and if there is enough distance, is really good about ignoring other dogs. But there's this one house we cross where the people leave their tiny, hugely reactive dog on a tie out. It's awful for every person and dog walking by, and I'm sure it's awful for the dog to be out there stressed. I don't get it"
