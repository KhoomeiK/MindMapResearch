todayilearned,fe6uflu,t1_fe68jvd,1578905480.0,"I lived a couple blocks away myself.  I didn't get woken up by the crash, but by the 8-10 helicopters hovering above.

It should be noted the workers of the Costco next door were among the first responders and we're credited with helping to clear out the survivors until emergency crews could arrive.   That Costco still has a plaque on the wall from the Governor (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) thanking them for their efforts."

CSRRacing2,fdiobga,t1_fdi8f0a,1578447370.0,"I first asked for them to delete and they just gave my the stock ""we're working on it"" answer.  I followed up noting that I had seen in forums that some people had been gifted 50k component parts so that they could at least restore and get it out of their legends garage.  They gave me 50k within 20 minutes.  If you suggest the solution, I think they are much likelier to oblige."

Is this the type of confirmation you're looking for?"
AskReddit,fd4fd2l,t1_fcyz1qp,1578167049.0,"I just had the most vivid dream of this last night, thanks to this thread, no doubt.  

My girlfriend and I were driving along with the sun hanging high up in the sky in front of us, when it suddenly burst, sending out spirals of particles in all directions.  The sky faded to dusk.  I checked the CNN website and all it said was ""Sun Explodes.  We're already dead.""  I remember thinking it was odd that cell phones and internet appeared to be working, but I couldn't seem to figure out how to navigate my phone to call my parents.

At this point I remember turning to my girlfriend and saying that this must surely be a dream and that we should just open our eyes and wake up.  Usually that is a certain way to snap me out of an intense dream, but it didn't work, and only convinced me further that it was real.

We then realized that there was a massive tsunami approaching and we got out of our car so we could climb up a large hill to get to high ground.  I could hear the roar of the water approaching when suddenly a massive hand burst out of the ground and giant 100ft chucky-doll-like monster came climbing out.  At this point my brain was like ""ok, this is getting ridiculous"" and I woke up."
AskReddit,fcz972h,t1_fcyvc8g,1578096208.0,"Isaac Asimov wrote an interesting short story about this, *The Last Question.*  It's basically a series of short scenes, each set exponentially further out in the future.  In each scene the characters wonder what will happen when all the stars go out, and consult their *multivac* (computer) for an answer.

I won't give away the ending, but if you have 30 minutes to spare you can listen to it here:

moderatepolitics,fclid8m,t1_fclf50b,1577748489.0,"Not just incorrectly.  He has only ever cared about ""corruption"" when he could tie it to one of his opponents.  Hell, less than a month into his presidency he was rolling back regulations aimed at preventing overseas bribery and other corrupt practices.  Saying this was legitmetely about corruption is a troll argument plain and simple

It's absolutely to clear to everyone why he wanted *this* investigation."
todayilearned,fcjf2zy,t1_fcj7vrt,1577685303.0,"You're saying it's possible, but suggesting it's not likely that they would offer a non-standard lease.  The rest of us are saying it's more than likely that they would in this situation.  If the value of that lease is in fact in the millions, then that means the value of the completed project would be many times this amount.  If this is only a four unit building, then you're right, they wouldn't just give away one of the units like this.  But if this complex is 10-50 units, they would offer that lease in a heartbeat if the alternative was losing your financing and getting nothing."
todayilearned,fcj5e2s,t1_fciykwj,1577677691.0,"What you don't seem to understand is that this IS a weird non-standard situation.  Did you not see the part where they offered the guy $800k?  Doesn't that scream non-standard situation?  If they're willing to offer that much, wouldn't they also be willing to offer a non-standard lease, especially if this is the only sticking point with the renter and they are on the verge of bankruptcy."
CSRRacing2,fbyu5so,t1_fbyibo1,1577226415.0,"They told me the same.  A day later I followed up saying that I'd seen in forums that some people were given 50,000 so they could restore it and at least get it out of their legends garage.  That did the trick.  I think you just need to hand them a suggested solution and they are more likely to provide it."
