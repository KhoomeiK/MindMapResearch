news,ff0f1xc,t1_fezn09t,1579468262.0,"I didn't mean it as a mocking comment. A lot of kids, especially in middle school, are so uncomfortable and/or incapable of reading, researching, and writing that you might be shocked, although it depends largely in the school. It's definitely a worthwhile thing to have them practice and develop, but it's also not the kind of thing many of them can handle or would want to do on a regular basis, let alone every day. You also have to consider that a lot of kids can't just hop on Wikipedia and get something useful out of it. They need sources that have been modified to suit their reading levels.

Structure is a very important thing, especially for younger kids who may lack experience. You can't just  tell them that we're going to be writing a paper for the next few days and they can pick any topic they want as long as they use at least two sources. They will look at you like you're an alien and say they don't get it. Even if you have them write papers every day, many will tell you that they don't know what to write about. Or they may show you a few sentences and ask if it's enough. Or they may write a giant wall of text that will make you squint as you read it. A rubric and peer review can alleviate some of these things, but kids also need to be given options. It makes a world of difference if you give them a list and let them choose something from it. I'd go so far as to say that structure is a psychological need for children.

As for your discussion on learning about pyramids vs. learning about Fortnite, I can't really agree. Imagine a 30-year-old man going to Cairo on a business trip. Maybe he's Egyptian. He flies there and he notices these giant triangular structures sticking out of the ground. He gasps and wonders if they are missile silos or something. And then a guy next to him tells him a bit about them. The guy is probably going to be shocked he never heard about them, and maybe even a bit angry he didn't learn about part of his heritage. Or he might not care at all. But they are an significant part of ancient history and human culture. It doesn't have to mean something to everyone, but it will mean at least a bit to most people, and it might even become your life's work if you become an archaeologist. But Fortnite will not mean anything in 10-20 years. Some might have nostalgia for it. We might even see it make a comeback. But I'd argue that your time spent studying it could have been used in countless better ways. You might argue kids should have the choice, but I feel it'd be a great shame if a kid who consistently made poor choices with no tangible benefits had to live life alongside someone who learned music, chemistry, math, history, etc. 

School should be your chance to get an idea as to whether you like certain things. Chemists are still important to our society. The fact that you it wasn't your thing was important to learn too. Historians and archaeologists still matter too, despite what many may think. So maybe you won't enjoy prehistory, Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, etc. But maybe Rome will mean something to you. Or the Medieval era, or the Age of Exploration, or the Holocaust, or civics and politics might be your thing instead. But you won't know that if no one ever introduced you to them. And that should be a big part of school too. Not everyone will necessarily even need to write papers, but having the skills and the familiarity with a wide variety of topics can help to decide what you should try to do in life. Ideally, the vast majority of kids would have a good understanding of this long before they have to think about college.

And yes, a lot of material can be incorrect or taught poorly. But most of it isn't. I highly doubt that you were taught the three branches of government or the concept of romance languages or the concept of evaporation incorrectly. And even if things have been taught incorrectly in the past (e.g. Columbus), our prior understanding can become a topic of discussion and research too. A lot of it comes down to what the teacher chooses to focus on and their familiarity with the content. If you want to improve that, you'd have to think about teacher preparation programs, professional development, oversight, and compensation."
news,few30qf,t1_fevz6cc,1579404736.0,"I wouldn't call the subject matter arbitrary, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be selected in a more meaningful way. Generally, you have standards approved at the state level, adapted at the district level, and implemented with a considerable amount of discretion by schools and teachers, so there are certainly many people involved in these decisions from year to year.

Letting kids study what they're interested in is worthwhile, but then the question becomes how you provide structure for that. Some kids are extremely motivated and can make good use of those kinds of opportunities, and others will get absolutely nothing out of it while they daydream about Fortnite.

With history, or social studies, it can be difficult to decide what's important and what's not. Do kids need to learn pre-history, ancient history, and everything up to the modern era? Should they be taught geography, economics, sociology, politics, and more? Should they learn only about the country or region in which they live, and if not, which other places do you teach them about? If your answer is all of the above, then either the kids need to do 6+ hours of homework every day or you have to make some decisions. And when you have a subject like history that plays only a tiny role in standardized testing, your time and options become much more limited.

As far as making things fun goes though, research and writing papers, as important as they may be, are pretty far removed from most kids' ideas of fun."

If Soleimani was carrying a letter from Iran in response to Saudi Arabia, you would need to establish two things. The first is that Saudi Arabia knew who would carry the letter and shared the information with Trump. The second is that Soleimani was guaranteed some sort of protection from the US in delivering this letter. 

A cut-and-dry example of perfidy would be having the Secret Service execute diplomats at the UN. The killing of Soleimani is fairly far removed from the conventional meaning of the term without making a lot of assumptions."

Quoted from the Wikipedia article on Soleimani, and if that's the case I'm not sure how applicable perfidy might be. My first question would be if war crimes in general and perfidy in particular are applicable when countries aren't formally engaged in warfare. My second would be if that was Soleimani's sole purpose in traveling to Iraq, which I find questionable considering he met with Muhandis. My third would be if Saudi Arabia arranged this, then would its leaders be guilty of perfidy, or the US, or both? And my fourth would be whether the letter ever existed, and why the leader of the Quds Force would be asked to deliver a letter. I don't know that the case for perfidy can be proven at this point, but maybe someone has more information than I do."

worldnews,fedfo2g,t1_fedbgj3,1579010243.0,"The short version is the Soviets and the British fucked around in Iran for a long time, but especially during World War II. Meanwhile, Iran had seen a series of Shahs removed from power and exiled. I think there were about 4-5 in a row. At the time Mossadegh was appointed by the Shah after being voted in by the parliament, Iran was a constitutional monarchy. Mossadegh and the Shah grappled for power, so it's really not as simple as ""Mossadegh was democratically elected, and the Shah was a puppet installed from out of nowhere."" The major reason Mossadegh was elected was to reduce foreign influence and retake control over Iran's oil industry. It's hard to blame the Iranian people for wanting that and the financial benefits that would go along with it. But at the same time, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was mostly owned by the British government, and it was seen as a major financial asset for it. There obviously needed to be some kind of change, as the decades-old deal wasn't working out for Iran, which was a relatively poor nation. Mossadegh ended up nationalizing the company's assets in 1951, and that was the beginning of the Abadan Crisis. Nationalization was a threat not just to Britain, but to every country that had companies with substantial assets overseas. Britain responded as you might be able to guess. It filed a lawsuit, placed economic sanctions, blockaded Abadan, which held a  major oil refinery. Iran's oil industry shut down and the country was plunged into chaos for months and years. This led to the coup against Mossadegh. It's easy to say ""wow, what a huge mistake; Eisenhower was so stupid not to predict what would happen decades later,"" but that does nothing to explain what the ""right"" response to the Abadan Crisis was, if there even was one.

The Shah is an interesting historical figure. He wasn't even supposed to become the strongman at first. US and British leaders viewed him as weak, and in a lot of ways he was. But he was also politically savvy enough to play competing interests against each other and bolster his own position. He drove much of the ""progress"" (i.e. westernization) that Redditors like to pretend was inevitable if only the US hadn't intervened. If you really want to be able to see Iranian women in bikinis, then the Shah was your guy, repression and all. He gave women the right to vote (mostly as a political scheme) and implemented quite a few other measures to try to modernize the country. But he was also an infamous womanizer, and it's really impossible to overstate this. The guy's name might as well have been Don Juan. His misadventures could put r/TIFU to shame. I think that most of the repression and violence he caused happened in the later years of his reign, and it seems like the Ayatollah mostly kept the same intelligence apparatus in place, but someone else could probably explain that better than me."

The Shah, as repressive as he was, also instituted many progressive policies, so the likelihood of those goes way down without the coup. The same people who instituted the current theocracy were still influential back then, so to declare the society secular today without the Shah is next to impossible. His father had been the one to ban headscarves. As to whether or not it would be democratic, that's very difficult to say. Without removing Mossadegh via the coup, he might have become a dictator (which he was sort of doing toward the end), or there might have been a war, or the country might have descended into complete chaos. One way or another, the Abadan Crisis was going to be resolved, but I leave that up to your imagination.

It's a huge myth that non-intervention would have resulted in a progressive, secular Iran. The Shah was just about the most grandiose example of Western excess that you can picture. So if you really support a progressive, secular Iran, then supporting the Shah in his efforts to crush everyone else was the only way that was realistically going to happen.

And in case anyone is drawing conclusions about my own beliefs, none of what I said was meant to suggest what was ethical or good foreign policy. I only meant to speak of realistic expectations."

worldnews,fddytu2,t1_fddmakz,1578327277.0," I remember sitting in my elementary school cafeteria and realizing I was different: While I typically finished taking all my friends' lunch money—and I was always thinking about my next score—my friends never took any money from me. Now that I think about it, they probably didn't see me as a friend.

Corruption had long been a huge issue for both me and my family: My parents weren’t just scumbags—they often bragged about their crimes, which made me feel self-conscious about mine from a young age. Slightly corrupt, I joined Corruption Cleansers many times over the years. Whenever I’d reach my goal, though, I’d kid myself into thinking that I could maintain my corruption reduction on my own. And then I ended up regaining it.

In the summer of 2011, a few months after I served my second prison sentence, I considered joining Corruption Cleansers again for the fifth or sixth time. My sister had joined around the same time, and so we decided to start going to CC Workshops together.

Excited to join, I slowly started experimenting with ethical habits, like not sticking my hands into other people's pockets and blackmailing poor schmucks. Except that I wasn’t consistent. I’d follow the program for a few months and then a vacation would derail me. Or I’d stick to my ethical habits during the week, but go off track during the weekend. While I felt like I had one foot in the program, and one foot out, I couldn’t let myself quit again and continued going to workshops on and off with my sister over the next four years. 

By late summer 2015, I’d lost 20 crookedness but continued to hover around that number for months. Corruption loss had become harder, I realized, due to my alcohol intake. If I were at a party or a wedding, I’d use a glass of wine or a cocktail to cope with social situations and end up evading my taxes. Or, if I were at home watching TV with my husband, I’d have a glass of wine or two to unwind, which would lead to late-night extortion. 

While I knew the behaviors I’d developed were only holding me back, I didn’t make a change until I discovered Dirtbags, CC’s members-only social network. It couldn’t have come at a better time: The stories, tips, and photos I saw in my feed inspired me. When I scrolled through, I said to myself, “That’s what I want to act like! That’s how I want to be!” So that fall, I decided to cut out alcohol completely for two months.

During that period, I retrained my brain to unwind in new ways: Instead of drinking, I’d lay in bed and read a book or take a bubble bath. In social settings, I learned to listen to my body and set boundaries. If I felt uncomfortable, I’d politely end my conversation.

Resetting my relationship with alcohol during those two months of sobriety gave me the confidence I needed to believe in myself. I envisioned myself losing that last 15 crookedness.

Above all, I started to focus on my embezzlement and beating up disadvantaged folks. I listened to the voice in my head and gauged whether I was full of shit, like I used to be in grade school. By August 2017, I reached my goal!​ 

Over the past two years, I’ve maintained my 35-crookedness corruption loss. While it’s a challenge to stay motivated without a greater goal in sight, I’ve made up little milestones for myself. For instance, while I used to hire my booty calls for every position in my department, I’ve cut back to just 25%. I’ll even use my scumbag tracker, do moral challenges, and practice 30- to 60-second apologies a few times a week.

While I appreciate a solid routine, I realize that change can be great, too. So after eight years on the program, when myCC came around, I switched things up by choosing Pure. Its ZeroCrookedness™ deeds list, which includes kissing babies and hugging strangers, encourages me to be more humane. I’ve also started tracking more often and paying more attention to portions of corruption. The change of pace has been fun!

Now that I’m the president of a wonderful nation, I’m doing my best to share the ethical habits I’ve learned on CC. I never want my people to feel the way I did as a child, when my crime was top of mind. From time to time, when I’ve brought them to my CC Workshops, I reinforce that the number on the scale is only one way to gauge your moral character.

I know I need to set a good example if I want each of my kids to grow up without spending too much time in prison. Rather than focus on themselves, I stress to them how important it is to live a balanced life; to be a good person; and to do well in school. I’m raising an ethical family, and that is my greatest victory."
