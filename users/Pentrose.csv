bujo,ff89xkn,t3_es6sum,1579670381.0,"Anything that works for you is good, and you won't know what works for you until you try. The main reason many people prefer a smaller size is portability. Grids are handy is you want both vertical and horizontal lines, but a steady hand and a ruler will often suffice should you want a vertical line for some reason.

Perhaps something fancy/expensive wouldn't be the best idea as it can exasperate any perfectionist tendencies. I just used something I had laying around for my first, mostly because that way it was easier for me to treat it as a learning experience/experiment. Odds are it will take a while, and a bunch of iterations, to figure out what you need and like."

bulletjournal,feivqp6,t3_epccjg,1579148528.0,"First: the index is there for a reason. Anything you might want to can easily have it's page number noted down.

Also: I like to have different colours for different types of spreads. I haven't been at this long, but I have decided that Yellow is for dailies and pink is for creativity stuff. (Like doodles and story ides) Green is for longer planning, which I rarely do. I like having a margin on the left side of my pages of written stuff, so I do them (and the tops of the pages and assorted headers) with an appropriately coloured highlighter."

bulletjournal,feem8os,t3_eopqmw,1579036604.0,"Mostly I write down tasks and thoughts.

 I find using the bullet journal as a journal has improved my mood (it's not working so well at helping me get stuff done, bu being happier is enough to make me want to keep up the habit.) The rapid logging of thoughts and feelings lets me get them out of my head without dwelling on them.

Also making the daily headers (I just highlight a couple of lines in yellow, then write which day it is. Today has 14 Tuesday for example) to be mildly meditative and enjoyable.

I'm toying with the idea of writing down things I'm grateful for as well."
bulletjournal,feelho9,t3_eopn90,1579036168.0,"I like having bright colours on my page, but not too much. Mainly I use yellow highlighter to create margin and header backgrounds.

Circles don't work as event bullets for me, they're too hard to distinguish from the dots at the size I draw them. So I switched to triangles.

I don't want decorative dailies, but I do have other pages with doodles.

I kept forgetting to use any monthly or weekly spreads when I make them, so now I just don't bother.

I love graph paper, oh wait, I already knew this - I'd just never really used it for note taking type stuff before. Still need to try a dot grid, curious to see if I'd like it or not."

bulletjournal,feed2qv,t3_eohq9d,1579031261.0,"Honestly? I just don't worry about it. I trust my partner. Nobody else really has the opportunity to get at it.

If I were worried about privacy I'd do a handful of things.

The first is avoid doing anything to draw attention to the book, thus reducing the odds of someone deciding it's worth looking at. If you're a student you probably have a bunch of notebooks for schoolwork, if it looks like just another book of boring notes most people won't bother. Unless they want your class notes for some reason.

Second I'd take reasonable steps to restrict access, such as keeping it in my bag and on my person as much as practical. Especially if I can do so without drawing attention.

Third I'd learn actual shorthand, few people use it these days and it would allow for faster writing once I got the hang of it. I've actually debated if this would be worth the bother for me."
bulletjournal,fe665mg,t3_enwh5u,1578882661.0,"I'm a fan of the 'stretchy dailies' format, nothing fancy just a header followed by however big a list of stuff the day requires. Like you I can get discouraged easily if I see blank space between now and when I last bothered to pick up the book. This way I can either make notes for the missing day(s), such as ""Got new game, spent entire day playing it"", or just move on to a new entry. So far I've not missed more than a day here and there (which kinda surprises me) so I could recall why the day was skipped.

I also don't like the feeling I get when each day has a pre-assigned amount of space, and this way I can use as much, or as little, as I want/need."
bulletjournal,fe4ihpu,t3_enpvi2,1578859656.0,"Simplify, reduce the possible number of mistakes.

It recently occurred to me that a good plan might be to have a simple set of spreads that can be made quickly and easily, but also have room for adding decorations and embellishments.

I also treat new spreads as experiments, in which I'm seeing what works (for me) and what doesn't.

I also put the phrase ""Perfectly Imperfect"" in the front. Remind yourself that mistakes give it character.

Additionally: White out is my friend :D"
bulletjournal,fe4hnvc,t3_enlwte,1578859432.0,"I actually made a spread for ""Things I want to Share With my Mom"" and may make ones for other people if/when there's something I don't want to forget to mention to them, or something where a visual aid would be helpful. I'm very forgetful, so this way I can just open my notebook and say ""I thought you might find this interesting.""

I've got some spreads with notes for video games I like (I enjoy complex RPGs). Though I'm debating a separate notebook for those. 

During NaNoWriMo I had novel planning, as well as a few passages I wrote when away from my computer.

Right now I'm pondering how I might make an effective 'Cooking Experiments' spread, but I'm not yet sure how to balance between 'enough information to be useful' and 'having to write so much it reeks of effort so I don't bother'"
bulletjournal,fe4f7w7,t3_enqu3z,1578858664.0,"If it's what works for you there's no need to worry if other people consider it a 'bullet journal' or something else.

For myself predated pages very much do not work, I need to be able to allow myself a variable amount of space. I also don't do anything fancy, just the day of month and day of week on a yellow highlighted line.

Personally I feel that the bulletted rapid logging is the heart of the system, but I'd never tell anyone they're doing it wrong. Because it working for you matters more than what anyone else thinks."

bujo,fcy2qxm,t3_ejinjv,1578074022.0,"Obviously, to me at least, it helps to have a simple daily so that it doesn't take much time to set up. In my case it's just a highlighted header and margin with the day of the week an number from the month. The margin is done for two facing pages and the header with date/day in the morning.

The next thing is to build it as a habit, which I've heard is best done by connecting it to something else you already do. For example you can do your morning set up while waiting for your coffee to brew, and your evening after cleaning up from dinner or when you do your homework. I was going to say ""After all what's one more notebook"" before remembering that most homework these days is done on a computer."
bulletjournal,fcnwtqt,t3_ei6msb,1577820026.0,"Start simple, no point getting yourself overwhelmed trying to do too much. If you think you will want to add artistic flourishes use basic layouts with some extra space for decorations. That way if your time or energy is low you can do it up with minimal effort, and when you're bored or just feel like it you can add in the pretty.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking you need all the trackers and stuff that other people do, they may help you or they may not. Before adding a collection ask yourself why you want it, if it's just because you think you 'should' then don't bother. If it's because it brings you Joy or you feel it will add value for you then go for it.

Mainly because otherwise the gaps would bother me if I ever went back through it. That said I'd keep it simple, like noting which days are holidays or whatever.

I'd put 'off sick', or 'on holiday' without details because odds are if I felt the need for a work bujo I'd want it to be something I could share with co-workers and the details are none of their business."
bulletjournal,fc0xs5n,t3_efh6d2,1577302555.0,"Seriously consider what you need/want from it, and think before adding stuff how it fits with that. I've seen a lot of cool, useful and generally awesome spreads that simply don't fit my needs, but are really helpful for other people. Many are effectively DIY planners, while mine is more of a brain dump/journal, and others are primarily collections of task lists. Any of these, and many other permutations/combinations of style, are good if that's what helps you.

And start simple, it's very easy to get overwhelmed trying to live up with some of the artistic and fancy spreads people share. It's also easy to fancy up a basic spread should you have the desire (and time) to do so - just add doodles, stickers, washi tape or a bit of colour."
