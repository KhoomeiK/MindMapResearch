gifs,feli2gl,t1_felc5jj,1579222681.0,"Lol I remember years ago getting an annual bonus check and then on a Saturday getting absolutely hammered and going to a hobby shop and bought a $500 kit that was supposed to be pretty beginner friendly. Without reading a single instruction I tried to fly it in my living room and ended up taking a blade to the chin and bleeding everywhere. Undeterred, I held it outside my balcony on the third floor and it took off, hit the roof of the balcony and slammed three stories to the ground. Went downstairs to try in the open this time, it went straight up into some power lines and went crashing down. Ok ok so I‚Äôm an idiot. I walk over to a field and try again. It goes so fucking high, so quickly, I lost it into a marsh. I trekked through this marsh for like 2 hours before giving up. I was muddy as hell and my buzz was wearing off. The next day I had an idea. I got in my car and drove past the marsh, it was right there near some industrial park. It was out in the rain all night so I had to get a new battery. Then finally I take it to a huge open park and try it out there. Turns out there was a defect where I had like 2 left blades or some shit so it wouldn‚Äôt fly right. Take it back to the store and get it corrected. Go back to the park, still couldn‚Äôt figure it out. And that was the end of it. Still sits in my basement today."

weightroom,fdkt1bz,t3_elo3wr,1578510551.0,"Do your arms fall asleep while sleeping? I‚Äôve noticed both times in my life when I‚Äôve been at my strongest my arms fall asleep lying on either side while sleeping. It was happening frequently a couple years ago when I was lifting regularly and my arms were pretty big. Since that time I stopped lifting altogether due to a number of unrelated reasons and I lost a lot of muscle mass but just recently started lifting again last August. 

My size came back pretty quickly but now I have the same issues of waking up every night with my arms haven fallen asleep and it‚Äôs driving me nuts. I can‚Äôt get a solid nights sleep either due to that or the fact I have to piss all the time because I drank way too much water at the gym and it takes hours to pee it all out. 

I‚Äôm guessing the size of my arms and outer chest are restricting the nerve under my armpit but I‚Äôm not a medical professional. I asked my doctor about it years ago but I didn‚Äôt present it as a major issue and she suggested I sleep on my back. Which idk about you guys but I can start on my back but who knows how I‚Äôll end up throughout the night. 

Does anyone else have the same issues?"

Your post is so in depth I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend it all. I can‚Äôt believe you have this level/ depth of knowledge. I‚Äôve been playing for just a few days now and finished my second regional city where everything is a grid and I ran out of room. So I went to my third regional city and figured out I can build zones then upgrade them then destroy them and repeat that process. My grid city with no space left is like an 80 and now my newest city is over 100 and I did it in under 20 minutes. 

After figuring that out I came to this sub to see what other tips I might be missing. But my god- I wasn‚Äôt expecting this. Nice job."
