Weddings can certainly be challenging. Not sure if it helps, but one of my biggest life regrets is drinking at my own wedding. I don't remember most of the reception and I really wish I had those memories. Being sober on your wedding day is a wonderful gift you can give yourself for years to come."

stopdrinking,ff7v1f4,t3_es14kc,1579659029.0,"Speaking just from my own we experience, stopping drinking helps immensely (I'm don't feel borderline suicidal when I'm sober, yay!) but I also take medication. I personally need the meds because my brain chemistry has been a mess my whole life, since way before I ever touched alcohol. Alcohol made things way worse, but stopping drinking is only a helpful step for me, not a whole solution. However, I know that's not the case for everyone. For some, it's just the alcohol and once they quit their depression goes away.

I think seeing a psychiatrist is a smart idea. They will help you figure out if/which medication is right for you. May I ask what your reason for not wanting to take medication is? I was initially afraid of antidepressants because I didn't want to take something that changed the way my brain worked but when I think about it, that's exactly what alcohol does and not for the better."

stopdrinking,ff7t9vq,t3_es4t72,1579657821.0,I prefer to not feel like garbage tomorrow. A few hours of being drunk tonight is not worth robbing myself of tomorrow's joy!
stopdrinking,fenzg5s,t3_epzdl9,1579293023.0,"Our pets are much better off with us sober! My dog definitely prefers sober parents, and she hates the smell of booze. She always growls at my neighbor when he's drunk haha - poor guy. 

I think my cat actually preferred when I would drink because I'd give her more and less healthy snacks, but she's a bit of a chunk and better off without them."
UpliftingNews,femyyaz,t1_fembwcy,1579273172.0,That is true. I think it‚Äôs just less so in the US thank countries like Finland where there‚Äôs higher taxes and more government involvement overall.
UpliftingNews,fem0mok,t1_fely60k,1579235948.0,Shelters are often pretty unsafe places. Providing apartments is a little different.
UpliftingNews,fem093c,t1_felz57w,1579235634.0,"I've heard it's pretty typical for charities in Europe to receive government aid. It's not like the US where they rely on individual donors. This is anecdotal, but informed by working with US-based nonprofits."
stopdrinking,fdp5u00,t3_emftsc,1578620691.0,"You don't have to do shit. If you don't want to drink, that's your call not theirs. They're assholes for pressuring you. Do you have to go to the party? Or do you want to? If so, my best advice is to have a non-alcoholic drink in your hand at all times so nobody tries to by you boozy ones (and also to fool them!). Leave early if it gets to be too much. You'll thank yourself the next morning. If you don't have to or don't want to go, don't! You don't owe them anything. Good luck!"
dogs,fdp4fsy,t1_fdmigh2,1578619757.0,What do you suggest? We take her on walks at least three times a day and go to the park if time and the weather permits. The cause is mostly that my husband can't bring her to all his work meetings.
dogs,fdp4aek,t1_fdn5wdd,1578619658.0,We walk her at least three times a day and play with her. Can't really expect 24/7 attention.

They also sell them at the pet store a block from my house), Easy walk (in hindsight that strappy thing didn't stand a chance), the ones from Petco that are soft and go around their whole head.. 

I was considering a Ruffwear one since I've heard good things, but they're so expensive I don't want to buy it if she's just going to eat it."

stopdrinking,fdkjvdj,t3_elvmda,1578505180.0,"If you think it would help you, I say why not! I told my family I'd stopped drinking right before the holidays just so they knew not to push wine on me. I didn't tell them why, because it's not really their business, but I did tell them that I no longer wanted to drink alcohol.

They're not big drinkers but they let loose more than usual at Christmas. I'm glad I told them. It made it easier not to be tempted."
stopdrinking,fdewhcv,t3_ekz01q,1578348045.0,"Boredom in sobriety is tough. One thing I asked myself was what did I enjoy before I started drinking? Is there anything you stopped doing as much of when alcohol took over?

For me it was reading, drawing, cooking, exploring, playing with my pets and spending time with family and friends. And wasting hours watching crime shows on Netflix (nobody's perfect). Drunk me also took up writing but sober me is a lot better at it. :)"

stopdrinking,fdawy9d,t1_fd9pote,1578251351.0,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - my life was never more unmanageable than when I was trying to work the program of AA. I wasn't sleeping enough, my work was suffering, I hit my neighbor's car because I was so fucking tired and worried about being late to a meeting that I wasn't paying enough attention, my marriage suffered. I tried two different sponsors, and both ""suggested"" (aka were adamant about/guilted me into) going to at least 5 meetings a week and tried to make me take on two commitments while I still worked full time, commuted an hour each way, volunteered weekly, ran a club and tried to take care of myself. I finally walked out on my last meeting when the speaker started talking about how she had to put AA first in her life (not her sobriety, but AA itself) even though she had two children. I realized that maybe going to all these meetings might be keeping me sober, but it was also making me miserable. I wanted a life that was more than going to AA meetings and events for the rest of my existence. 

AA is great for some people, don't get me wrong. If it works for you, awesome! For me, I am much better off without it."

science,fd5gh0v,t1_fd2qphw,1578177353.0,"The book ""Unbroken Brain"" is a good read for anyone interested. Treating people who are addicted to drugs as (gasp!) human beings actually improves their chances of getting clean."
AskReddit,fd40vej,t1_fd25tzk,1578163361.0,"Boston is easily one of my favorite cities in the US. I lived there for 5 years and also moved away to be closer to family. For a small city there is so much to do and it's so easy to get around! I also found people to be, if not friendlier, at least nicer and more genuine than other places I've lived. They have a surprisingly good music scene as well."
AskReddit,fd3xt9k,t1_fd1kl6e,1578162568.0,"Same. I kept hearing from my grandma how wonderful San Francisco was when she would come here as a teenager from Sacremento. Now it's full of tech bros and homeless people who have largely been forced into the streets by NIMBYs and capitalist greed. It's filthy and depressing. Tbf there are beautiful parts as well, but it's definitely not what I was expecting."

Sobriety really does make us better pet parents. I still feel guilty about the time I accidentally locked my cat out on the porch all night because I was drunk (she was fine thank goodness). That never would have happened had I been sober."
stopdrinking,fcsgapc,t3_eimg4n,1577916104.0,"Sorry to hear about your night. Sounds like you‚Äôre in a rough place. What has worked for me so far (and I‚Äôm only 35 days in so by no means an expert!) is reading This Naked Mind and doing The Alcohol Experiment at my therapist‚Äôs suggestion. It helped me really see alcohol in another light. Ongoing therapy with someone who understands addiction has also been helpful.

If AA works for you, you may also try athiest/agnostic meetings. And rehab could be an option too if you think you need the structure."
stopdrinking,fcsflab,t3_eimk1n,1577915820.0,"This realization is huge! Good job recognizing that wine is not a cure. Boredom can be useful in some ways, too. I‚Äôve found it helps me find my creativity, and also being bored means I am safe which is obviously a good thing.

Stay strong. IWNDWYT."
stopdrinking,fcsf4dv,t1_fcrw0zj,1577915645.0,Second this! Loose leaf tea in the evenings is a ritual I‚Äôve recently started and it‚Äôs sooo much more relaxing than wine!
stopdrinking,fcset3m,t3_eimlpc,1577915520.0,"You could try the Alcohol Experiment by Annie Grace. It‚Äôs a free 30 day program online that I just finished up.

The dog meat trade is truly horrific. I used to work with an organization that is working to end the trade and rescue the dogs. The pictures they had were heartbreaking. There are some things you just can't unsee. :(  Mad props to the people on the ground rescuing dogs and working to pass legislation in these places.  They are heroes.

If you can afford to donate to an organization like FOUR PAWS or Soi Dog they are doing amazing work in this area. They do more really cool things, but the dog and cat meat trade is a big part of their work."
