I’ll eventually have to have back surgery and they said it was all the chiropractors I had been to throughout my life...  LIES! 

But...  if I had gone with the right company, I would make 16-18 an hour plus health care, eye and dental...  I rarely had to talk to anyone besides dock workers, and if they gave you any problems you just talked to their manager and the manager would force them to do the work.  I did have one co worker who thought he was a manager and would scream at people all the time, I reported him to HR and they did nothing... he was 5’4” and I’m 6’6”, eventually it pissed me off so bad I threatened to kick his teeth in.  He never spoke to me again which solved that problem.  

If I could do life over again, I would have gotten a CDL or CNC certificate before college... saved up, and gone to the actual college I wanted to go to.  But I had a mental illness that was not under control that caused me not to think things through.  I also have two parents who have severe OCD that kept saying “you need to go college immediately!  You’ll make a ton of money and have a good life! Listen to us or else!”  I had my first psychotic episode at 20...  They didn’t give a shit, they just kept forcing me through school via threats and verbal abuse...  My grades were poor and I was almost asked to leave the school because of how bad my grades got. 


This is all some food for thought.
