catsinpants,ffbac41,t1_ffa0pf4,1579757238.0,It's a popular name. Both of my sisters had a cat named Max.
thalassophobia,ffb8max,t3_esl3zf,1579755144.0,"Was in a storm north of Australia once in a large ship with a flight deck 60' above the water. Waves were breaking over the deck and the ship was rolling like no one's business.  Loved it, felt like I was being rocked to sleep. 

Now this...is terrifying. You must have been pretty pumped up on adrenaline, and I'm sure your first beer tasted great!"

MurderedByWords,ff8hhgq,t1_ff8gfsx,1579678701.0,"I knew a lot of independents weren't actually ""independent,"" but didn't realize the real ones only exist in single digits. No wonder this country is so f\*cked: Partisan through and through."
science,ff8guhm,t1_ff8grh0,1579677882.0,"Had a big impact, for sure. But Stalin's pogroms arguably resulted in more deaths. Anyway, it's sort of a moot point. I think the situation can be resolved w/o resorting to global war. At least, I hope so."

thalassophobia,ff8g3ir,t3_es5rjh,1579676940.0,"Love it. My favorite part of being in the military--weeks and more spent at sea in the middle of nowhere, watching the waves pass. Idyllic, really.

Lucky I wasn't Navy, though, those guys had to work their butts off!"
catbellies,ff8fqej,t1_ff7vc11,1579676500.0,"So, so sorry! Condolences to you and your family, and I hope you can find a way to remember her, like planting a tree or something else that she liked. :("
spiderbro,ff8fky7,t3_es5i1v,1579676321.0,"What a cute little guy! I understand the theory why babies and young mammals are cute, but I confess I'm not sure why some other types of life are. For example, so many of the spiders in this subreddit defintely are, and have you ever seen water bear? Check out videos on Youtube. Definitely cute."
OldSchoolCoolNSFW,ff8f92h,t3_es4imw,1579675938.0,"Oh man, I remember her! Her photoshoot was in a barn or something. Very hot!"
science,ff8evu8,t1_ff89x5s,1579675514.0,"So, you think relying on unknown technology to feed the world's teeming population is the way to go? Big hive cities, with algae farms covering the ocean, and all the open land converted into giant livestock pens? That your vision of paradise? Of course, that'll take some technologies that don't exist right now, but no problem, right? May want to take a look in a mirror, Oh Tiny-minded One."
science,ff8eqqh,t1_ff8a2xc,1579675349.0,"Well, not really. As horrible as it is, war doesn't reduce populations significantly, unless it's in combination with genocide. I think Stalin, Pol Pot and some others were pretty effective in that area, but they did that without war."
aww,ff8emnw,t1_ff8bfdx,1579675222.0,So...you could actually start the subreddit on your own. Would definitely enjoy watching your videos. :)
science,ff83dhh,t1_ff82d6q,1579664912.0,"Understood. I lived in Kenya in the late 80s, when its rural areas had a growth rate of 8%, higher than urban areas in many countries. I completely agree with your point regarding priorities and also the impact of a low growth rate, which indicates the optimal solution is not simply to reduce birth rates in all countries. I suspect making it easier for people to relocate for jobs might be part of the solution; immigration barriers may need to be revised. In the end, though, feeding 10 billion people or (as in another subreddit) extending lifespans seem counterproductive."
aww,ff826jr,t1_ff7puvz,1579664032.0,"This calls for a subreddit. No idea how many videos there are, though, it seems unusual."
aww,ff81mae,t3_erzp4c,1579663616.0,"Wow, that's a lot of blue!"
science,ff81h18,t3_es1s95,1579663509.0,"Well, here's a much easier solution,  well within the means existing technology: How about reducing the planet's population? Education,  family planning,  etc. Don't see how the current situation is in any way  sustainable."
Catswithjobs,ff81695,t3_es0juj,1579663291.0,"Awww, so sorry for you and Sylvester! Looks like he brought his A game to work. Hope you can find another good boi to help out, though we know he won't be Sylvester!"

He eventually settled down to 12-14 pounds. He was my favorite,  though, really a sweet boy. So... is it true your cat snacks on canines,  too? :)"

If you looks at the raw data, there really are only two other countries (on paper) that come close to it, Russia and China. However, it's increasingly to the US's benefit to work with Europe and other allies because the playing field isn't what it was, and we've pretty much exhausted our liquid assets."
