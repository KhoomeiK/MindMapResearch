Well, I don't know what I can say, because to me and the people I know irl, OP comes off as rude and hurtful when she could have easily not been to the coworker. Like I said, maybe it's a cultural difference - here, it's perhaps more common to be rude with a veneer of politeness."

But I recently moved near the coast, so I suppose there's more moisture in the air, and I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with serious frizz. Like I regularly start the day with great hair, and then suddenly next time I look in the mirror there's frizz everywhere, which didn't happen where I lived before. 

If I put in a product that helps with the frizz, even with a light hand, my hair will get greasy when it's *not* so humid, and the product builds up over time (I have very low porosity hair) and my CG shampoo isn't enough to make it undo the grease, and it takes a few days of using no products whatsoever to go back to normal - but I'm worried if I use a non CG shampoo, it'll go back to being crazy dry all the time."

Same. I've heard that our metabolisms are at the highest in the lead up to your period, before dropping again for the actual period (sidenote: if you wear a watch that can measure heart rate, you'll likely be able to see it fluctuate with your cycle and be higher around this time too), so I suppose it makes sense that we'd be more worn out around that time even aside from the PMS."

I liked trench coats and double pea coats best and didn't like parkas and puffy coats when I was 12, and have the same preferences now. I've literally bought and worn down almost 10 pairs of basically the same ankle boots in the past decade. I've *always* been drawn to muted and cool or neutral colours too. Also, while tastes definitely *developed* and matured, but I feel like the overall aesthetic I like hasn't, so if I go for classic items that aren't *as* subject to trends, odds are I'll still be happy to use the item in a decade.

I think a possible indicator of when it's worth ""investing"" is when you find yourself hunting for the same item after you've worn something down, it makes sense to ""invest"". 

Totally agree that many on FFA go to far and start ""investing"" in things they'll stop wearing pretty quickly."
ffacj,fd3wz26,t1_fd2sr0b,1578162321.0,"I tend to think ""neutrals"" are any mixture of black, white and brown tones (so including shades like beige, taupe and grey) while shades like olive green, navy and burgundy are ""muted"" tones, which have many of the qualities of neutrals when compared to brighter colours, but are like a step up in how ""easy"" to are to coordinate. 

I suppose I'm saying it's more of a spectrum from neutral to brights, and it depends where you draw the line for different categories what you call things. Depends on skintone too for sure, especially for shades like blush pink, brown and olive which match certain skin tones."
Instagramreality,fd2qsa7,t1_fcz68ta,1578150787.0,"If you're overweight, then you already have a problem and *need* to ""relearn"" how to eat. I see calorie counting like training wheels for finding out a way to eat that will keep you healthy in terms of both weight and nutrients, and satiated in terms of both physical hunger and tastes you enjoy.

Personally I love calorie counting because it allows for a lot of flexibility in diet while losing weight and in very concrete terms where you *know* it's not possible to gain weight when you're eating a certain amount (or you're miscounting), which gives you a sense of control. And you may think ""well it's not healthy if you eat all your calories in junk food"", but i don't think that's an issue because you'll very quickly notice you'll feel like complete *shit* and very hungry if you do this. But at the same time, you can still work in junk food in your calorie budget once in a while as a treat.

Personally, I ended up gravitating towards much healthier food, enjoying subtler tastes than just sugar and fat, and ended up losing my cravings for sugar and refined carbs, and feeling full much more quickly too. So in the long term, you can stop counting, as it's more about creating the new habits, but imo you definitely need that degree discipline at the start.

You definitely have to *want* to be healthy more than anything and not self destruct/punish yourself with restriction though."

I like ebay a lot for buying second hand, but a lot of sellers don't do returns so you have to *know* something will fit/is what you want or have it be cheap enough that it doesn't matter."
femalefashionadvice,fd2hdgl,t1_fd2ed8h,1578147250.0,"I'm also a student and pretty much everything I've bought in the past few years has been on sale for a significant discount or second hand - even cheap stuff I've bought for <£5 and not full price. I agree that you want to splurge on staples to make sure you get durable ones, but I think that for things like I said, you don't think you'll get much use out of but want to experiment with, I don't see how buying better quality helps, because it's not like you'll wear it (in all probability) enough to make a difference. Stuff that's worn down too much and stuff I don't like much, I'll wear around the house or use for layering under jumpers in the winter when no one will see them, so it comes down to the same thing anyway, except one way I'll save money.

Of course, charity stores (thrift stores if you're American) are a good option for ethical concerns, and while there's a good one near my parent's home, my locals ones during term time are all overpriced *and* cheap/worn down crap and I find very little in my size in the first place."

There's also the Charge 3 Special Edition, which is pricier but *could* be within your budget and has much better reviews from what I've seen - if you shop around for deals you could maybe find it within budget though.

I like how it looks with a [leather strap](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07W9D1H3Y/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A2XPEJLUOKU03G&th=1) (especially as you can add holes you so it actually fits my wrist...) - there are lots of straps you can buy as it's such a popular product."

And having a wardrobe stocked with neutrals makes it really easy to buy more colourful, bold items and still find plenty to match it with.

Weather definitely influences taste, I'm really bad at shopping for future seasons because I'm just drawn to all the wrong colours for the atmosphere, I literally have to make mental notes of colours to go for.

Happy to give recs for some brands, but could you give a little more info about your aesthetic interests. You mentioned fitted and earthy color palette - but is your style like Celine or The Row? What are some brands you already favor?

I'm not really sure. Except for colour (which I've always had strong opinions on and I think I have a good eye for), I've generally played it safe with a very ""classic"" and safe items that flatter me, but I've been wanting to experiment more now I feel comfortable with the basics. In terms of high street stores, I feel drawn to stores like Zara, & Other Stories and AllSaints, but I like elements of ""preppy"" styles too. I really like the Valentino albums I've been browsing, though idk how it could translate to a more casual style. 

And I said ""earthy"", but ""muted"" (especially with interesting colour combinations) would probably be a better word for what I'm drawn to."
femalefashionadvice,fcv9roj,t1_fcv6uuk,1577997605.0,"> I wouldn't say runway styles cater to the androgynous look any more or less than other styles. 

I suppose it's that models tend to have those willowy, androgynous figures with long legs, so I feel that runway fashion is skewed towards things that look good on those bodies? I'm enjoying browsing some collections on that Vogue site though - would be great to have more discussion on reddit around that kind of thing. Anything in particular you'd recommend for fitted sillhouettes and earthy colour palettes?

Yeah, I'm def still figuring out drape and fit - I've found some oversized styles work where others don't and it's still witchcraft to me where the differences lie exactly. Your body sounds maybe similar, so any tips would be welcome - I'm 5'2"" with an hourglass figure in terms of bust/waist/hips but narrowish shoulders and thicker thighs which make me look more pear shaped from the front. Also tiny legs (26"" inseam) which easily makes certain baggier fits look like a sack on stumps lol.

Thanks for the encouragement and info btw!"

Edit: to clarify somewhat, the things you linked are all fitted at the waist, and I feel a lot of high fashion has shapes more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=378&v=zyqhjnkXGjM&feature=emb_logo) from the OP post, which is a silhouette I think only works willowy body shapes - looking more closely it's less than I think and I probably just notice it more because of some form of confirmation bias. I think it's also that I feel insecure because I've always been drawn to styles that look good on androgynous figures and then been disappointed when I can't create the same effect on my \~~petite hourglass~~ (pls don't jerk me) figure and it just emphases the stumpiness of my legs.

femalefashionadvice,fcuhqcs,t1_fcuf4oa,1577981238.0,"Yeah, I've noticed that tension. 

Fwiw, though I feel completely out of my depth, I'm definitely interested in *learning* more about high fashion (why I clicked on this thread in the first place) and would be very supportive of seeing it here more often or lurking on a sub devoted to it. Tbh, a similar tension exists on most hobby subreddits between the people with more casual tastes and people who want to dive deeper - like I love literature but stay far, far away from /r/books for the sake of my sanity.

I suppose part of my problem with it is also that I think a lot of it (not the collections OP linked) imo is very focused on tall, narrow framed and androgynous bodies to an extent where I can't see how it can be translated to work on a shorter and/or curvier body. So it may even appeal to me as a form of art, but it doesn't really relate to how I dress in my mind."
