There was even a bit in an SU episode where Stevonnie was arguing with herself about eating a cute critter when they crash-landed on that planet."

aww,fdqnfpe,t1_fdp8n7q,1578670783.0,"Cat tongues are all like that! Unlike dogs or people, cat tongues have little barbules that point backward. These are made out of the same stuff as hair and fingernails, and they act as a comb for grooming. Cats will groom themselves, their kittens, and each other - it’s a social bonding thing as well as basic feline hygiene!

Edit: I didn’t realize while I was typing that you were talking about how the blanket looks like a cat tongue 🙃 I was just too excited to be a factoid spreading nerd :’D"

aww,fcyk3pg,t1_fcy6yt3,1578081437.0,"Yep! The reason for this is that where humans usually have 1-5 hairs growing out of one follicle, chinchillas can have more than 50!! 

This makes their fur extremely dense, and so it holds a lot more water. This makes dry time very long, and they can get sick or die from mold/etc growing if you don’t take extra care with them if there’s an accidental spill."
