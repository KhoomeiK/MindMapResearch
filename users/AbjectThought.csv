I am a very shy and introverted person. Most of my life I was bullied for being overweight so I live most of my life avoiding embarrassment by staying away from attention. I don't go out really unless I am with friends and it's usually just to a friend's place to hang out. I was never someone that was invited to parties because I never really had a lot of friends. I only made them during college and never had friends in highschool. Now I moved to a small town for work and due to some terrible situations (you can read through my post history if you want the specifics of the situation. Here is the gist of it. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/e14p9s/men_who_have_lost_your_best_bro_to_his_so_and/f8ml9dc/) in 2019 I have lost my best friend and don't really talk or get to see my other 3 friends which wasn't many in the first place.

> The sex will come with the girlfriend, so what do you need to do to get one? What is stopping you now? Meeting the right person takes time, so are you meeting enough people that she's potentially part of that group?

What is stopping me is my attractiveness, weight, and personality. I need to lose 40 more pounds and get jacked. That will help my personality so that I am confident enough to go out and meet people. Or at least good looking enough that I don't get ghosted after the first reply on tinder or other dating apps.
