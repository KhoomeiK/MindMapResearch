I completely agree on the hyperbolic approach though."

Imagine how common these deaths were in the past. How amazing scientific advancements impact in human life. Just think, this is the progressive defeat of natural selection and Humans who gets to live instead of Nature. How cool is that?"

MadeMeSmile,fe5eiy8,t1_fe3ftr2,1578868422.0,"I think you misunderstand my point. It has nothing to do with taking vacations, it has to do with reading about other countries, talking with people about their own culture and considering that maybe Americans are not always the center of the world. Some of them do this exercise a lot, others, never."
serialkillers,fe44wlf,t1_fe42kft,1578855804.0,You're seeing way too much in a terrible almost pixelated picture.

MadeMeSmile,fdzwec5,t3_ena3op,1578797411.0,"I've never understood what exactly is the ""American"" part of that. 

Not from USA. We also have trucks. We also have kids pumping their arms."
serialkillers,fdtbl6l,t1_fdsxgs0,1578714453.0,"I think it depends on the concept of Justice. What you describe is plain old revenge. Justice is not revenge.  

What's the whole point of the justice system if we're institutionalising revenge? If the victim had no family left, you let the criminal go? If the criminal is killed, how you deny the same right to the family of  the murderer without  going into a spiral of revenge? There has to be more than just ""satisfying victim's family desires"", whatever that means.

As far as I understand it, the system exists for two things: impart the prescribed punishments to the crime, and to try to rehabilitate the criminal. That's it, nothing more. 

Would be great to hear from a person with law studies about this."

I'd suggest doing some research on the subject for you to form your answer. I can add to that perspective with another fact: Mapuche people have fight off the Inca Empire, the Spanish Crown (they had to sign a treaty because the Mapuche would not let them go further south and continue destroying their cities) and to a certain extent the Chilean State. 

I don't know of any other native culture to battle such strong enemies and left still standing."

What I mean is, the type of company you are is completely irrelevant if you rent something: they can't take that away from you because it's not yours in the first place. Maybe I'm not explaining this well, I apologize if that's the case."
