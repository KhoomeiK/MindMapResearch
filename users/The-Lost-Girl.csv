AmItheAsshole,ff1xesa,t1_ff1wf5r,1579488366.0,"PPD isn't an excuse for cheating. Its isn't a cause of cheating. PPD causes an chemical imbalance in the brain which causes problems with mood and and ability to bond with the baby but it doesn't control your actions. His wife kissed someone because she wanted to and its shitty to say her PPD is why she did it. The PPD might have made her feel like she wanted to and affected her feelings toward her husband, but she made the decision to act on it. Leaving his wife because she has PPD would be awful, but leaving his wife because she kissed someone else is not.

Also, why wouldn't the child have a normal life if his parents aren't together? Many kids live happy, normal lives with one parent or separated parents or seperated parents and step parents and in this case, it might be better to separate now than to try force the relationship and let it deteriorate more. They still have to parent a child together and the more civil the break up of a relationship is, the easier it is to co-parent."
cats,feprmc9,t3_eqcolm,1579328930.0,"Your vet will be able to tell you if its safe to vaccinate  him. Since you can't be 100% on when he last had them and what he had, its best to check.

1. Deafness is a spectrum. Some people can hear certain pitches and volumes, even if they sign.

2. Its rude to talk to people about an event and then not invite them. Your friend was being polite and inviting others to attend an event she was going to since you all had been discussing it as a group. 

3. Deaf people attend concerts and music events all the time. Being deaf doesn't mean they can't go and have just as much fun. 

As you said, you don't sign so you have no idea what they were saying to each other. From what you described they sounded sceptical of going because to sounds like an odd spirtual, mediation thing and they're not into that. Even if your deaf friend thought being invited to a concerty type thing as they are deaf was weird or funny, I'm sure they appreciated being invited instead of being excluded."
AmItheAsshole,femdxwn,t3_epxcgw,1579250528.0,"YTA purely for calling your son useless. He is going to remember that forever, even if you apologize the damage might already be done. Being called names by a parent (in a non-joking manner) sticks with you. As someone almost 30 who was called useless, among other things, by her dad, I can tell you it hurts. A lot. It makes you rethink your entire relationship with that parent because no matter what you do, you think  that they think you're useless. Why bother with anything when a person who is meant to be your biggest supporter thinks your useless?

YTA also because you asked him to do 2 other things then got pissed he didn't read your mind that you needed more help. You said in the comment that you didn't ask him to help because you assumed he would just do it."
cats,fem2h6s,t3_epv8v2,1579237579.0,"I would highly recommend going to the vet. The fleas might have started the scratching but there could be other reasons why it has continued. Your cat could have an allergy which might need steroids or a skin infection which might need antibiotics or even mites.

If your cat has scabs that aren't healing, why wouldn't you take it to the vet? If you had scabs that weren't healing I'm sure you would go to the doctor."
cats,felsece,t3_eptmfx,1579229767.0,"My cat is super vocal too. I've had her for a year now and can kinda differentiate what her different meowd mean. Often shes just talking to me, like if I'm hanging washing on the line outside she'll trot up and meow at me while I'm hanging stuff up or if I'm cooking and she wants me to put her on top of a half wall thing in my kitchen so she can watch and smell the ingredients. 

Scientists have found that cats can vocalize at multiple pitches, most of which humans can't hear. Newborn kittens can't hear well so their mothers meow at them. Scientists have also found cats see us as huge, naked, dumb kittens which is why they meow at us, cos they think we're stupid. So maybe extra vocal cats think their humans are extra dumb."
cats,felqrpc,t1_felph0p,1579228656.0,"He really needs to go to the vet, have it drained and go on antibiotics. My cat has had the same thing (I took her to an emergency vet on Sunday), its a fight wound abscess. It cost me $270NZ as they sedated her, cleaned the wound, gave her injections  of pain meds and antibiotics and sent her home with a course of antibiotics and pain meds and that was with her insurance.

As a note, if you can't afford unexpected vet bills and don't have/can't afford pet insurance, you probably shouldn't have a pet. In this case, your cat will need antibiotics at the bare minimum but the vet will most likely want to clean it out. Abscesses very rarely heal on their own, the infection usually spreads causing the abscess to grow and cause tissue to die. Cats have a tendency to hide when they are unwell, so things like puncture wounds go unnoticed until the infection is evident so having the ability to pay for the care they need is important. Maybe your vet will let you make payments on the cost and since I don't know where you live I can't be sure of costs or what your vet will say"

There is a CBD gel you can buy online, Amazon sells it i think, that works super well for anxiety and pain in animals. A small bit on their ears can help. Taking him to the vet and talking to them is also a good idea. They will be able to help with his licking and they may even know of charities that rehome pets in cases like yours, where your home just isn't a good fit anymore (no ones fault, it just happens sometimes). However, do be aware that if you take him back to a shelter, his chances of finding a new home may be slim so if you can rehome him yourself, try that first."
cats,fefoo8o,t3_eowgss,1579060997.0,"I've got a couple weird things I've found with cats that might help.

1. Try putting his food and water near the area he keeps peeing. Cats are super picky about not eating where they poop so it might curb that behaviour.

2. Is there anything near where he pees that could be startling or scary or that he could mistake as another animal? Being deaf he may be getting spooked by something and peeing in fear or he might be seeing something as coming into his territory so he's trying to mark it.

I would also recommend taking him to the vet to make sure his kidneys/bladder etc are all good. Sometimes peeing in weird places is a sign the kitty isn't feeling great, even though you said he's been doing it for a while, it might be worth checking.

Note: Is he by any chance white with blue eyes? I've worked with a few deaf white kitties with blue eyes who were very odd and I swear its gotta be connected to the white/blue/deaf gene lol"
AmItheAsshole,fefnse3,t3_eowj0f,1579060388.0,"NTA. I have lots of food allergies and restrictions (including some raw veggies) so I always check with the host before hand about what food will be served and if I can bring my own food if I can't eat what's being served. 

The raw veggies thing is Oral allergy Syndrome. The proteins in some raw vegetables is similar to pollens  and can cause an allergic reaction. Cooking the veggies sometimes changes the protein structure enough that the immune system no longer sees them as a pollen allergen. I can't eat raw tomatoes but I can eat them if they're cooked. Another weird part of it is im allergic to latex which has caused me to be allergic to kiwifruit because of the same reaction."

Showing other people nudes of your ex is wrong on so many levels and the fact those girls are high school age in the pics makes you a predator. I hope you one of your friends reports you to police for distributing child porn and revenge porn. Private photos are meant for the receivers enjoyment not for the receiver to boost their below average ego to their friends.

cats,fdm96w5,t3_em47cw,1578542939.0,"My biggest tip would be to look at how much you work vs how much time you spend at home. Kittens and young cats generally need a lot of attention so if you're gone for long periods of time and can't get home at breaks, you may be suited to an older, calmer cat. Bored and lonely cats tend to get destructive. If you're set on kittens, look at adopting 2 as they can keep each other company and entertain each other while you're at work.

Adult cats are just as loving and playful and can be just as much fun as kittens. I always suggest people look at the adults first as its easy to get lured in by the cuteness of kittens."

They are identical in that they come from the same egg that multipled twice but one twin has a random genetic mutuation that caused her to have primordial dwarfism. Random genetic mutations occur as the cells are forming and are not hereditary so her dwarfism isn't a trait that she inherited for her parents or occured anywhere is her genetic past. Because of this, they are still identical twins rather than fraternal twins (fraternal twins are when 2 separate eggs are fertilized and implant successfully, and each twin has their own embryonic sac). It is incredibly rare, I don't think there is another case. The girls are very close and supportive of each other."

AmItheAsshole,fdm499c,t3_em3ata,1578539429.0,"NTA. It sounds like you have a plan for after school that has worked everyday until this sub came. Her actions caused problems for everyone. What if a kid picked up after yours thought the bus wasn't coming cos it was late, decided to walk and got hurt? It takes a couple minutes to ask the office to contact the parent to find out what the plan is and holding up the bus for 2 minutes is better than them sitting wondering if your kids are ok and making others wait.

Talking to you about your kid, during pick up for something not urgent is also inappropriate. I don't know if they heard what the sub said but that could be or if any other kids or parents did, but thats not right. If there is an issue with a kid talking in class there are better ways to talk to the parents than ambushing them at pick up while half climbing into their car (asking if they can come in now or before class the next day to chat). 

I personally had a teacher tell me as a kid (maybe 6 or 7) that I talked too much but who never clarified when it wasn't a good time for me to talk and I ended up barely talking in her class. I didn't understand that sometimes we need to be quiet and focus on our work and it wasn't that me talking in general wasn't bad, even after I was no longer in her class, I was scared of talking in class in case another teacher told me the same thing. I worked for years in childcare and if I had this problem I'd say things like ""right now we're reading not talking"" or ""its quiet time""."

cats,fdl1n1x,t3_ely5ui,1578515485.0,"Try getting a variety of kitty safe things to play with, like pipe cleaners  curled into spirals, large pompoms (as long as they're big enough that  the cat can't eat them. Also toys that move to simulate prey (like balls in tubes) and things to climb and hide in. Generally bad behaviour in cats is boredom related and when you mix that with kittens still learning they have mini knives on their paws, it gets a bit messy and painful. Tunnels and tubes and things to play in are super important, toys that give treats are great too. My cats favourite toys are pipe cleaners and leaves so I constantly have pipe cleaners all over my floor from her smacking them round. Playing with your cat to wear them out is also a good way to curb destructive behaviour, playing with them until they starting panting helps make sure they're really getting all their extra energy out in a positive way instead of by biting you or ripping furniture."

Usually I just pet her while she hisses and purrs and she eventually stops hissing and just purrs. She also MUST stick her foot in my coffee in the morning. If you stop her she will keep trying and get more adamant about it, which usually means the cup gets knocked over. After she puts her foot in, she gets offended that its wet and runs away like I forced her to do it. Nim also likes to sit on a little wall thing in my kitchen while I'm cooking, I hold out ingredients so she can sniff them.

My parents cat Gus is as dumb as a bag of rocks. He's a huge 6yo white Manx/Maine Coon mix that weighs 6kg but thinks he's a tiny kitten. This is an abridged list of some of the shit his dumb ass has done:

     My parents bought Gus as a farm cat to help stop mice from eating the veggies in their garden. Gus catches mice, brings them inside alive and lets them go only do lose them. He has done the same with rabbits and a rat.

     Every summer he forgets that bees and wasps sting so he gets stung at least once but usually 2 or 3 times. 
 
     He has a super high voice when he meows so you hear a cute kitty sound only to be met with his huge furry ass running at you. Hes super vocal as well and likes to announce his presence by screaming as he walks around the house.

     Got stuck so many times in a possum trap that my dad had to stop using it. My dad had a humane possum trap that he was using to catch a couple stoats on their property. Gus would go in to eat the bait, trigger it, get stuck then sit there quietly for hours until someone came to let his dumb ass out. Its one of the only times the fucker was quiet for a long amount of time and was often in there overnight.

     He gets picked on by a group of fantails that live by my parents house. They dive bomb him and taunt him every morning, he has never caught one and it happens every day. (Fantails are a type of small bird. They're really agile when flying). I've seen him crash into a solid wood fence trying to catch them.

     He is also terrified of my cat Nim when we come visit. He is literally twice her size but is scared of her cos she gets sick of his shit and bitch slaps him. He will try play with her but gets too rough (he plays like young kittens do when they're still learning social skills and how to retract their claws) and can't figure out why she doesn't want to play anymore.

Gus is.... special."

He kinda forgets he has claws so he'll be super into having snuggles and just launch in with his claws, the same thing happens when you play with him. He goes from playful to death mode quickly and not understand why you suddenly don't want to play cos hes ripped into your hand. Hes also a huge manx/maine coon and not particularly bright so it can be quite painful."
cats,fcwp8ac,t3_ejajlh,1578032378.0,"Did he have a cast on the leg? I might be hair loss from the cast rubbing, especially if the spot is where the cast ended. 

Also if hes grooming the spot more than normal, it could be a stress thing. It sounds like he went through a fair bit and might be over grooming. 

I hope everything turns out well xx"
aww,fcwotw3,t3_ejam1m,1578031976.0,Look at his fancy feets. I love him!!!
cats,fcwoj47,t3_ejap5f,1578031682.0,"I leave my cat biscuits all the time (she has a gravity feeder) and twice a day I give her wet food, morning and evening. She usually lets me know shes ready for her wet food by being a complete asshole and getting in the way and I usually pick the wet food up once she walks away from it so it isn't sitting out for ages, growing bacteria. Left over food goes in the fridge and if it isn't eaten in the next meal, I chuck it out. 

I ended up with this routine cos my cat kept getting really bad acne on her chin. The vet said it was bacteria is plastic dishes that I had her wet food in. I switched to metal bowls for the wet food and her skin cleared up completely and she seems happy with the routine."
quityourbullshit,fcwnv6e,t3_ejar8e,1578031051.0,"Maybe they thought if they said they were a vet rather than just a vet tech, people would take the advice more seriously. What they are saying is very true, dogs can have lots of problems with cooked bones as they splinter easier and increase the risk of them ingesting sharp bone shards.

Not a vet or vet tech (yet), I am studying to be a vet nurse tho :)"
AmItheAsshole,fcp7d8h,t3_eidtvi,1577852917.0,"Wait, I'm confused, do you not have a washing basket or something for dirty laundry? What does he do with his dirty laundry cos surely it would be easier to gather all the dirty laundry in the house and do one load rather than 2? Cos it kinda sounds like you just do yours and leave his up to him, like when I'm at my parents, I get everyone's dirty laundry and put a load on. I'm tired from working too but its not any harder to gather all the laundry and its more economic to do one load."

ChoosingBeggars,fcmc6m4,t1_fcmbirq,1577770187.0,"But she was asking for info, not demanding anything, it was you who demanded an answer after less than a day of her inquiring about it and you messaged late at night (after 8pm can be considered rude when its a business transaction). Wouldn't you rather the puppy went to people who were making sure that they were making the right decision in getting a puppy? Maybe they wanted to talk through whether the puppy was what they were looking for. Your reaction would make me rethink getting a puppy from you, it seems like you just want them gone."

cats,fcji4g9,t3_ehhvfe,1577688470.0,"Maybe take the 5yo cat to the vet to check his neuter procedure was complete, its rare but sometimes a testicle can be left behind if it never descended or is malformed, or sometimes just missed. Hormones could cause the scruffing behaviour as its part of mating. The vet can also give you tips on curbing the behaviour and make sure there is nothing else causing it.

You could also try putting something nontoxic but yucky tasting on the spot when it heals so the kitty won't like biting there."

AmItheAsshole,fcje19q,t3_ehhpt2,1577684319.0,"YTA, maybe they couldn't afford the flight costs to Oz but still had time off so they went to somewhere they could afford, especially if your uncle had been sick and everyone needed a chance to relax. Maybe they figured it would cost too much for your family to go, maybe they asked your parents who said no. I live in NZ, other than my parents, the rest of my family in in the UK. Its super expensive for them to come here or us to go there ($2000-$3000 for flights per person) so I only met them twice and im in my late 20's. 

Lifes too short to be pissed of at your family over something small, and it sounds like you're the only one who is bothered by the whole situation and you're the one who felt awkward when you later met up. You let a past moment ruin your holiday. I'm guessing you're still in your teens and that your parents paid for your trip, a trip where you still got to be with your family. Be grateful you were able to catch up with your family later and that everyone was healthy."
AmItheAsshole,fcizonu,t3_ehepbp,1577673678.0,"NTA. I get what you mean, one of my grandmothers passed away when i was 18. I never met her as she lived on the other side of the world. She left me a necklace and my aunt was gonna post it to me but I asked she save it to give to my little cousin who was 6 at the time. I never knew this grandma,  I only spoke to her once or twice a year and I'm allergic to silver and nickel. The cousin was given it this year for her 16th birthday and appreciated it far more than I ever could have and knowing it meant a lot to her made me super happy.

I think you're very kind for wanting your Nana's jewellery to go to a family member who would love it and appreciate it. Your dad might just be struggling with the whole situation and could have seen it as you not wanting anything of your grandmothers, maybe talk to him and explain once things have settled a bit."

AmItheAsshole,fc21yv0,t3_efqz7r,1577337225.0,"NTA for leaving but if you start telling the kids awful things about their mum you will be. You obviously think your wife has a problem with alcohol, so talk to her about getting help, talk to her about how its affecting you all as a family but DO NOT tell your kid her mum loves alcohol more than her!! That is fucked up on all levels and is just gonna hurt your kids rather than help your wife. Kids don't deserve to be around an alcoholic parent but they also don't deserve to used as a weapon by parents either. Its one thing to tell your wife you're taking the kids out of the situation when shes drunk but its another to tell a toddler their mum doesn't love them. Don't be that parent."
AmItheAsshole,fc1xdfn,t3_efqdr7,1577332649.0,NTA. My bestie does my eyebrows but I always pay her and I work around her schedule cos she's doing me a favor by saving me a trip to a salon to get them done. Your friends are being kinda selfish by expecting you to do them for free whenever they want
aww,fc0uyvo,t1_fc0tjpq,1577300316.0,"Thats not actually true. Cats pant when they've been doing lots of physical activity, just like people. A cat panting for no reason is definitely worrying but a cat panting after running around and playing is fine. Its sometimes recommended for cats with high energy to be played with until they pant because it releases all the energy into playing rather than destruction and being a nuisance. I do this in the evening with my cat so she doesn't keep me awake overnight because shes awake and bored. She loves it and it was recommended by a vet"
AmItheAsshole,fbx28om,t3_eewz6x,1577166494.0,"I wouldn't say YTA but you did give her one more thing to hold against you. Its awful that she excluded you but by taking shitty pictures (chances are she's gonna say you did it on purpose) you'll be proving her right, in her mind. You're better off being kind and polite cos it makes her shitty behaviour even more evident to the people around you. If you act rudely, you'll be affirming all the bad things she thinks about you but if you're nice to her despite it, shes gonna have a harder time with it.

My ex's mum was horrible to me, I started being super nice to her and eventually the rest of the family stopped letting her be awful. Her bad attitude toward me stood out so much, because I was nice to her."
