This way you never need to waste energy making ice for your water, you don't need to waste good water waiting for the tap to make it cold, and if it's too cold for you or your guests they just have to wait a bit until it warms up to their liking. 

For the second it would be the creamiest chocolate milk to have ever been tasted. I'm telling ya it would be so smooth you'd think Marvin Gaye's voice had been liquified and is now pouring into your mouth and down your throat. So smooth that your girl gets flushed everytime she takes a drink. That smooth.

The third I would say would be an English breakfast tea, perfect temperature, with a little bit of cream. The real classy type tea that makes you feel smarter just thinking about it. The kind you'd imagine the British worked so hard to perfect, over years of trying the highest quality tea's from all over the Orient. Shipped over on a sale boat, stored in little silk pouches.
