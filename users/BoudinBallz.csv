GetMotivated,fefirst,t1_fefhfce,1579057189.0,"Breaux was the best available free agent transfer so to speak. We had a team stacked full of talent without a quarterback. That is attractive. Could they have foreseen the season he had and the Heisman trophy? Of course not. But I have the options borough head this was clearly the best one, as it was borne out"
GetMotivated,fefim0o,t1_fefhp8e,1579057091.0,Ed Orgeron was literally the recruiting coordinator at LSU. And it was his second year coaching he took over for miles after he got fired. Joe Burrow himself talked about his recruitment by O. We had a team stacked full of NFL talent without a quarterback. That is an attractive situation
GetMotivated,feff02n,t1_feewe8h,1579054924.0,That is complete nonsense
GetMotivated,fefejjm,t1_feeqvwp,1579054638.0,"You have no idea what you’re talking about. Orgeron has been a fantastic recruiter everywhere he has been in his career. He didn’t get lucky getting bro, he created a program that was the most attractive option for Burrow. The recruiting focus was not on defense only, that’s wrong too. And  Les miles won over 70% of his games, won two or three SEC titles, one national championship and played for another."
