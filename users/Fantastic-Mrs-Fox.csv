I think overconsumption is a serious issue as is the capitalism which fuels it. I think that should be taken care of way before it comes to constricting human rights to make life.

I understand your sentiment. I have never had a wedding or planned on it, but I have been to a couple and I know how stressful and divisive they can get, even those who's participants have the kindest of hearts. But, I have been in a toxic relationship. Just to put this decision in a little bit of perspective --

Your friend is probably having a hard enough time with this man as it is. Not allowing him to come pits them against each other even if that is not your intention. If he is abusive, he will absolutely make it a ""you or him"" thing, and it is opening her up for all types of mental/verbal abuse. Here are your options:

1. If she chooses you, she will probably be distracted at the wedding, and he will probably call her all sorts of things, before and after, for making the correct decision. 

2. He might then be able to get in her head about how you are causing these problems indirectly because you are her go to confidant. But now that she has mistrust in her head, she will not go to you with that information, and communication will decrease or cease altogether.

3. If she chooses him, no matter how torn she is, she will feel guilty about not attending your wedding. Then see option ""2"" and you've sent her out to sea on a kayak with no paddle.

4. While highly unlikely, this could be the straw that broke the camel's back for her and her relationship. But again, highly unlikely because the mind games abusers play usually leave you feeling like you shouldn't give up and that you can work it out.

While you are not responsible for the choices she or he makes, and her feelings are not yours to care for, if you are close and you truly care about her, I would strongly advise against barring him from the wedding. 

Whatever your choice may be, congratulations on getting married! I hope the wedding goes smoothly and is as beautiful as you imagine. I also hope that your friend sees the light sooner rather than later and finds happiness and love within herself and with someone else!

Edit: sorry about the list format. ""2"" was supposed to be ""1A"", but it changed automatically, but ""2"" is more of a subset of ""1"""

Being on the fence about an abortion and then having one can be a very tough thing to go through. And that's without getting manipulated and bullied into having one as this poor girl was. She obviously thought about the possibility of raising a child after she got pregnant, and those dreams were chipped away at by YOU and everyone else that YOU decided to get involved. It might have ultimately been her decision, but you decided to make it everyone's business BUT her own.  

Add on the fact that instead of trying to console her after this potentially traumatizing decision that you basically made for her, you told her it was her fault and that you had nothing to do with it.

Also, relationships require communication. Especially when you live with the person. She should be able to tell you where she is and who she's with and what she's doing without getting defensive. In fact she should offer up that information as a courtesy for peace of mind at the very least. You're not being controlling by wanting to know those things. You are being a normal human being with feelings and intuition.
