AttachmentParenting,fdy44uq,t1_fdwiypp,1578775913.0,"Hi I am set to have #2 Monday morning (😮) and this is our plan also. Grandpa will be at home with big brother while baby brother is born and he will bring him to hospital later to meet and all that. Then Daddy will go home with them and stay the nights with big brother as to try not to upset routine. Being that this is baby #2 we figured honestly I don’t require dad there all night and if I need someone, I will have Grandma stay with me in the hospital. Baby brother had a gift ready to give big brother and we have been preparing this whole pregnant by talking openly and have a little doll we have been practicing with how to love on."

GestationalDiabetes,fdtm5ic,t3_en21er,1578718762.0,"Overthinking I’m going to guess. Those numbers should be 1 hr after you eat and then you don’t eat anything while waiting for hour to pass. Then eat again at next scheduled meal and repeat. I have only been doing testing 4x a day (fasting and after main 3 meals) and no tests after snacks.  My cutoff was the same-140 1hr after meals.

And what do you mean the numbers don’t fall to fasting numbers? 1hr after a meal wouldn’t be a fasting number..."

GestationalDiabetes,fdpm3kt,t3_emjcly,1578632480.0,"Mine started doing this about 36-37 weeks, I have only been on night time long acting insulin for fastings but my numbers all around started to dive. My MFM just kept lowering and I notice it dipping again. I’m 38w5 now and am scheduled for Monday eviction 😬"

AttachmentParenting,fco7vm5,t1_fcn3845,1577825766.0,Same here- dad had to take over and it actually worked!  We talked about mama’s milk (he said it flew away so I went with that) and eventually he stopped talking about it really. He does still touch them sometimes at night but really doesn’t ask or try anymore. I’m due with little brother in 2 weeks so I’m actually nervous about how he is going to react to brother nursing. I am prepared to just tell him he can either only have mama milk OR all of the delicious food he is accustomed to eating and see what happens haha 🤷🏻‍♀️
