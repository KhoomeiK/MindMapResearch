suicidology,ffc4rin,t3_esta7h,1579791504.0,"I relate to this a lot. I don’t know what to say since I’m actually in the same place, I don’t think I’ll get older. I’m having more and more trouble to leave my house, and doing anything besides thinking about suicide. And I’ve recently came to the conclusion that I will indeed kill myself, I don’t know when though but that’s how my life will end. I’m fine with that. It brings me peace to think about death, it seems so peaceful."

suicidology,ffbzyvb,t1_ffbz8mo,1579787974.0,"Each time I wake up I pray that something or someone will kill me, and I really hope there’s nothing after death. Like you said, just going into the void is fine."

Makeup,ffbmd0l,t3_eso8bb,1579772498.0,"You should definitely try Zoeva eyeshadow palette, doesn’t matter which one you pick, they’re all really good and not very expensive. My favorite is the Caramel Melange. 
I don’t know much about eyeliner but my friends told that the Nyx epic liner is wonderful.
Hope that helps."
Makeup,ffblqnv,t1_fetfhnc,1579771547.0,"Beauty Blender is probably one of the most overpriced item, and I still don’t get why... I mean I’m sure it works well but there are other cheaper sponges who work well too. I got one from Kiko, it cost me around 5$ (4,50€) and I absolutly love it ! Plus it’s very good quality."

suicidology,ff6m66i,t1_ff6lnt7,1579630156.0,"I’m from France and it’s illegal there as well, even though I don’t know how harsh is the punishment  you risk. Might give it a try if I find a dealer."
suicidology,ff6l528,t1_ff6kpdp,1579629528.0,"I know but right I really don’t have the time and the energy, but yeah maybe I’ll give it a try at some point.
God, that sounds awful I hope you’re feeling better. You know when I was taking meds I was actually hoping that I would kill mysef just by accident, well the worst thing I got was a blackout and an horrible taste in my mouth...definitely not worth it.
I’ve actually never heard of that ! Is it expensive ?"
suicidology,ff6jtp7,t1_ff6hivl,1579628727.0,"I’ve tried therapy ; first therapist told me « ooow what a pity » when I told her that I wanted to kill myself, the second barely talked to me. She would just write sometimes on her notebook, the last time I saw her I basically told her to fuck off. I’ve never attend therapy since, and actually I’m really afraid to try again.
And I used to take a lot of antidepressants/antipsychotics but it was self medication... I would just take random pills, I wasn’t even checking the dose. It fucked me up seriously even though I’m like 1 year sober."
suicidology,ff65ltf,t1_ff64y8y,1579619690.0,"Me too, I don’t think I’ll live past 30... and that’s why I feel so confused when people ask me « how do you see yourself in xx years ? », like idk I’ll be dead before."
SuicideWatch,ff62tvn,t1_ff430sz,1579617721.0,"I feel ya. It’s been 6 years that everyone keep telling me that Im gonna get « better », it makes me cringe so hard each time. Like no it won’t get better, and event if it does, it would probably be such a small change that you won’t even notice and it’ll make no difference... (idk if that makes sense)."
suicidology,ff62bmq,t1_ff5z3a7,1579617349.0,Why 64 tho ?

Carebears,fetl0x0,t3_eqk808,1579376422.0,would definitely buy the Grumpy bear !
AdviceForTeens,fessab8,t3_epipsr,1579368501.0,"Okay well that’s not cool in that case. I would suggest that you could try to do the same to her but violence is not always the best. Maybe you can try to really get hungry at her, and tell her how much it bothers you. But if it doesn’t work, idk... Is she doing that only to you ?"
AdviceForTeens,fesr5m5,t3_epipsr,1579368139.0,When you say slap do you mean a slap on a shoulder or a slap on the face ? Im sorry if I sound dumb but since english is not my first language I’m kinda confused.

SuicideWatch,fdyx91b,t1_fdxzcel,1578784486.0,"Same, I’ve finally accepted the idea that I will probably kill myself one day. Maybe not in one year, but at some point i will do it.
It brang me some peace even thought I’m kinda worried about my mom (her dad also killed himself)."
fatlogic,fdvm21u,t3_en0ezr,1578748865.0,wtf did I just read ???
SuicideWatch,fdr7f04,t1_fdr5z71,1578680559.0,"I understand, mental health has always been a big taboo in our society unfortunately… Well maybe you can try to contact a suicide hotline (if you have that in your country), this could be a start. And about parental consent, I think they only ask for it if you’re a minor."
SuicideWatch,fdr52s8,t3_emunue,1578679656.0,"Oh dear, I understand what it feels like.
Maybe you can try to see a therapist ?"

SuicideWatch,fdh4q0g,t3_ekzj50,1578415335.0,"Update : I fail, I’m giving myself one year starting from now on. Then I will probably commit suicide."
