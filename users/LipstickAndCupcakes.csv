I tried playing it on the iPad and I was running into problems, but for the life of my I can’t remember what they were. It had to do with the controls though, I think I wasn’t able to complete certain actions or something."
bulletjournal,ffb18vz,t1_ffauyo4,1579749284.0,"Me too. I go through phases where I won’t touch the game for months, then I’ll pick it back up and I can’t put it down. It’s so easy to get carried away too because “oh I’ll just do one more day, then I’ll stop” and then “well I have a bunch of crops that will be ready to harvest so I’ll just do that and then I will stop” and it’s an endless cycle lol.

You’re referring to the gelly roll pens I assume? I love those! I had a blackout book last year and used those a bunch, they look so amazing on dark paper. I’m using a normal white paged bujo now but I want to incorporate more bits of black here and there so I have an excuse to use those pens more."
bulletjournal,ffasd3a,t3_esfywo,1579743368.0,That looks so nice! I have mine just sloppily swatched and in no particular order. This makes me want to redo my swatches page because this looks so much better
bulletjournal,ffaru4l,t3_esitdu,1579743013.0,"I see a fellow Stardew Valley fan! Isn’t that game the best?! 

Also lovely spread! I like the bold black background for each day’s of the week, I’m going to have to try that in a future spread. It’s simple but has such a nice effect."
ipad,ff66vna,t3_eru7vw,1579620554.0,"I haven’t read through all the comments so perhaps this was said already, but it could be clothing. If I’m wearing a long sleeve shirt and the sleeve is on my wrist, it’s inevitably touching the iPad when I write and it sometimes causes the pencil to stutter just like yours."
bulletjournal,fevzll9,t3_eql2dv,1579403481.0,Oh wow that’s gorgeous! I want to do a Studio Ghibli theme in my bujo at some point this year. I’m saving your post as inspo.
bulletjournal,fdirrvc,t1_fdik8ah,1578449588.0,"Just an FYI, I had a black bujo last year and I think it was that white pen you are using (I tried out a few white pens so it could have been a different one) and it transferred over onto the other page. I would just hate to see all your hard work get ruined, so if your worried about it I suggest throwing a piece of tissue or something on the page so the two pages don’t touch when the book is closed"
StardewValley,fbf1yrp,t1_fbetrl1,1576799484.0,"I do now! I didn’t have it when I went to the caves for the first time. I completely overlooked that fact too, yeah that will make loads easier."
