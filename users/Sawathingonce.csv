Let's ask him but because we can't maybe just presume it's him wanting to make sure she's ok but there you go.

That's always something to keep in mind, the balance of what is reasonable for the employee as well. The wording in the legislation is kept vague and interpretative in order to provide latitude for the business because don't forget, government can only tell a business how to run its business to a certain degree. It's still a private enterprise and you still have the option to not accept their terms (or policies) and find someone who will give you that flexibility to take 4 weeks. I don't mind giving 4 weeks to employees who are always giving back etc but I also have a blackout period 4th quarter. I think that's reasonable

Edit word dammit"

It also isn't illegal to look for other employment should it come to that when you deem 4 weeks to be your absolute minimum offer

Edit what I mean is you don't have to take the 3 week offer either. Choice is yours of you wish to remain with this company or not I suppose."
