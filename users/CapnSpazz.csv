I don't expect the senate to do anything. Quite the opposite. So rather than talking about something me and others have talked about so much over the last 3 years, I think we're all trying to focus on other things when we hang out."

If someone is hard working, but doesnt have the attitude of a ""go getter"", they probably wont get as far. Not from lack of work. Lots of low wage jobs will work you to the bone. Lots of blue collar, physical labor jobs dont pay much. Shit, I worked for a moving company for a year and a half till they closed down. I did 60-70 hours a week. I got nothing in the long run.

Obama gets credit for fighting for it.

Trump also gives speeches to anti-LGBT conventions. His own VP supports conversion therapy. He's also tried to fight agaisnt the LGBT community. Tried to give religious groups the right to discriminate agaisnt us. He has taken sexuality out of discrimination guidelines for the government. Tried to get trans people kicked out of the military. 

No. The Bible thumper still vote republican. And no, the two groups are not comparable like you're trying. One is basing things around facts and fighting bigotry. The other is still using religiob to justify it. The only difference between now and then, is that more and more people are not tolerating the shit the right keeps pushing. It's still the right who are protesting against us, and wish for our equal rights to be taken away.

funny,fep6shf,t1_feoyesn,1579313416.0,"I took it more as making fun of transphobic people. Like they just don't care what you are or how you identify. Just supposed to be a more light hearted, funny way of saying it. A bit over used at this point, but I don't see it as an insult to trans people."
funny,fep5ztw,t1_feouhek,1579312897.0,"This is how I took it. I don't take it as an insult to trans/non-binary people. If it's taking a jab at them, it's meant to he a fun way of showing they're being inclusive and don't care which bathroom you use, and that they will support people's rights."
funny,fep5ue8,t1_fep5lkc,1579312799.0,They probably should deal with it. Probably should go to a profesional. Good thing the professionals universally agree transitioning is the best way to handle the situation. So either way.

Edit: to be fair, knowing how bigots work, they might not personally use the term anymore. Sort of like when white supremacists decided to go by the alt-right. They constantly change names, but it's always the same shit."

funny,feoqa96,t1_fenij4a,1579303863.0,"Not even always just local. Even some big businesses. Just got a Switch, was looking at getting a micro SD card. I want a 512gb because it's the best bang for your buck at this point. It's the exact same thing. Places like Best Buy don't have them, but they can order it... And it's almost twice the pride. Some things I'm willing to spend extra on, but if it's the same exact product, paying more doesn't help me in the long run. I'm just paying more to say I didn't use Amazon. That's it."

I'm about to turn 31, and the longest I've had a job is 2 1/2 years. Shortest is 3 days. It would be nice to say I keep getting a new one because it's better, but it's the exact opposite. I figure I'll give it till I'm 40 at the latest, and then just give up if it doesn't change"
