It's a super tiny unincorporated community that has maybe a hundred people, if that, living on several square miles so it could only be picked up by him and his neighbors basically. Part of the deal for getting a super crazy deal on it (they paid the same price the owner paid about 30 years prior for it, so no adjustment for inflation or increase in property value), was to keep it going. They kept it running for a few years before my mom ""accidentally"" unplugged stuff when vacuuming and couldn't get it working again after but still kinda cool they had all that equipment.
