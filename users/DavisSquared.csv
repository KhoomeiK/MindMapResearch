Thetruthishere,ff0rklx,t1_feyg2qx,1579471653.0,"Did the police officer give you a reason for that? Because typically cops are asking for people to come forward, report on anything unusual etc. And in cold cases, they often hope for a guilty party to come forward to confess, etc.  Also, parents typically use any media they can to get the word out in hopes of finding their child.    I am so intrigued by your story, it's stories like this that get me to read the ""glitch"" pages because I am so fascinated by them....but I just don't understand the secrecy in detail; when the officer told you it would be best to not use the info, did he tell you why not?"
AskReddit,feyahjo,t1_fex11xn,1579442997.0,"So true.  I remember when they first came out, it got so frustrating for so many people that next there was a ""non-child-proof"" request option."
Thetruthishere,fey5m61,t3_eqrnu8,1579441107.0,""" I will not being using real names or locations for this as it is still an open ""cold-case"" ongoing investigation. however I will say this happen in the North East of the United States! ""       I don't understand this part.  On missing person pages, names, and  info on the disappearance is listed. I would think that you and his father would want to get as much info out there as you could.  This case is years old.  It's not like police have to hold evidence etc, why wouldn't you just detail it?"

AskReddit,fereh69,t3_eq9k9o,1579352961.0,"Paid good money for an Aerosmith ticket only to find out the ""concert"" was them filming a video.  They played the same few songs over and over and OVER, all the while asking the audience to cheer like it was the first time it was played.      They are a popular band and not lacking for funds....if they needed an audience for a video, they could have filled a venue in thirty seconds flat.  No need to cheat ticket payers out of an experience."

Have you thought of planning a night and inviting a few people? Also, look into groups like Meet Up, where you just gather with people who have like minded interests.  Everyone who attends meet up the first night is a stranger...it's a great way to meet friends who have similar interests.  Additionally , I spend many a Friday night serving meals to the homeless in my community---I've since bonded with the volunteer group and have friends from that.   Don't sit in your room alone and brood over a lack of invites....get up and get out there.  I wish you the best."
