aww,feukthv,t1_feukdur,1579387483.0,"OMG! Forgive my excitement, but I worked there for seven years. Yes, a bona fide member of TNT, from before they were acquired by MTV Networks and folded into the Nickelodeon brand portfolio, through to the beginning of 2010. Sorry I’m a little sentimental about that time at the moment, but we recently lost a former colleague, the first member of TNT that we are aware of to pass away."

weightwatchers,fe4hbvx,t3_enmsbc,1578859296.0,"Weighed in this morning; down 1.8 lbs! I may hit my 40-lb milestone next week, if I work the program extra carefully (I need to lose another 2.4 lbs to get there). 😬

I never realized how spoiled I am, because I live alone and don't need to take anyone else's dietary needs or wants into consideration. But for the past three weeks, I've had an elderly relative staying with me for the holidays, and I now have to consider him when grocery shopping or going out to eat. He absolutely supports my WW journey and says he'll eat what I eat, but I can't ask him to stick to 23 SP per day like I do. So I now have a lot more sympathy for people who must accommodate spouses, partners, kids, etc. when meal planning."

weightwatchers,fdc5e7p,t3_ekdt66,1578267437.0,"You’ve totally got this! I am about to turn 54 in less than two weeks; I’m post-menopausal, and I’ve had spinal fusion surgery at L4-L5-S1. I have started and stopped WW three times since 1995. BUT, I have also lost 35.8 lbs on WW Blue since August 25, 2019 (5’8” and started at 223.4 lbs.)! I was sure I was going to fail, but it’s gone so much better than I ever imagined, and I’m still moving forward with it.  Looking forward to reading YOUR success story soon! 👍🏻🥰"

weightwatchers,fcktfqm,t3_ehp5si,1577732809.0,"The people in your meetings should be supportive, no matter what. Some of the smaller members are likely lifetime, who attend because they know that meetings help them to maintain their weight loss. They have already traveled the road you’re now on, so they remember what those insecurities feel like, even if they initially had to lose more than you do. If there are any, maybe try talking to them about your concerns to see how they have handled it. Also, don’t assume people are judging you for your feelings, just because you’re smaller than they are. There’s a saying that what people think of you is none of your business, and this is one of those situations where that is very true. Now, if they are outwardly hostile or denigrate you somehow, that’s a different story. Then you may need to find another meeting, even if it’s at the same center. But projecting your fears onto them is as unfair as it would be if they were actually judging you. I’ve been the member with only 15 lbs to lose (in the past), and I felt no less valid than anyone else there. Go to the meetings with your head held high for doing what you need to do to take of your heath and self esteem, and good luck with your weight loss journey!"
weightwatchers,fb8b3zd,t3_ebrudp,1576610071.0,"That’s an awesome way to approach the situation! I found that the flexibility of the MyWW system really allows me to keep a positive mindset in situations like these. Which plan are you doing? If you’re doing either blue or purple, you can also eat lean proteins (skinless chicken or turkey breast, eggs, seafood, Greek yogurt) with your sautéed veggies without adding SP. They really help keep it more filling!"
