news,ffac2gt,t1_ffabnaf,1579732006.0,"Tulsi has explicitly stated her reasons as to why she voted present, and her logic is sound, whether you agree with her or not. But to brush over everything and just say that she had ‚ÄúNO reason‚Äù is not the truth. She had her reasons and she does tend to stick to her guns.

Edit: here is her response, in case anyone can‚Äôt be bothered to look it up:

Her track record since has reflected such ( https://www.ontheissues.org/Tulsi_Gabbard.htm ). As for Assad and the whole Syria scenario, she met with BOTH sides and specifically went there first hand to gain an understanding of the issue, rather than talk about something she didn‚Äôt know. Tulsi again and again goes out of her way to go to the source and talk with people on the ground (a big reason why I started following her was that she actually went to Standing Rock to talk to the people back when that was going on, and I personally don‚Äôt remember any other candidates or government officials doing the same)."

sustainability,ff6aknr,t3_errgrb,1579622971.0,"Hi! My background (undergraduate degree) is in materials science engineering and when i graduated i realized that my heart wasn‚Äôt in it and I wanted to apply my engineering learning sustainability. I applied to a few programs and got in to them as well, all in the US. I chose the civil engineering MS program at ASU and am now getting my MS in civil, environmental and sustainable engineering (my specialization is in sustainable engineering). I did not have any civil engineering background prior, and I do not think it took away from my application. My professor who is overseeing my MS project is also the one who teaches IE, adaptive management approaches and other emerging sustainable concepts.

First and foremost, IE is still a very new field, hence the vague descriptions. Second, sustainability in the real world is marked by the need for more extensive communication across domains and the need for more multidisciplinary approaches. We want and need more people of different backgrounds working on these issues in the industry. From that alone you already have a big advantage. When you apply to programs, talk about your background in industry/business and how it would give you extra insight into complex problems and how well rounded it makes you. My program itself is very multidisciplinary and I had IE classes with MBA students and poli sci students.   

I don‚Äôt think your background will detract from your application, I think it will only help. From a career perspective with your background and where you would like to go, I could see you fitting in a consultant role for a large company. 

Remember, business managers and engineers both face a similar challenge: they must create solutions that work in the real world, for very complex problems."

Futurology,feywjmn,t1_feyv273,1579451398.0,What you are saying makes no sense. Agriculture uses much more water than industrial even if it is just crops for humans. I‚Äôm including both because Germans partake in both.
Futurology,feyvyx1,t1_feyk64c,1579451112.0,"You say ‚Äúonly pollute with manure‚Äù yet CAFOs are a huge contributor to water quality issues like eutrophication.

I don‚Äôt think I have ever left my dog outside of a store or cafe either as he would whine and whine and would generally make a scene.

Honestly if you feel this passionately, I strongly encourage you to follow a career path in environmental sciences, more specifically in hydrology or engineering to gain a better understanding of the issue at hand. Unfortunately a google degree will not provide you with the knowledge you need to understand these issues. By studying and conducting research at a university you will gain a much broader and more concrete view of our world.

While phx has over 1400 artificial lakes (insane I know lol) those lakes and greenery actually act as a sink for excess nitrogen. Furthermore they help control sediment, and the greenery helps alleviate the urban heat island effect (and god knows phx needs solutions for that). As a resident of phx and a graduate student in civil engineering whose personal research has focused on infrastructure solutions in the valley, i think I know what I am talking about. And trust me, as a Tucson native, no one wants to shit on phx more than I lmao.
