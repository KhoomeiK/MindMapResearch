dating,ff72vtv,t3_es0ipr,1579640030.0,Dating is like the neural net of romatic relationships ?? You gotta try everything till the weights (read qualities of a person) are optimized according to your needs.
Tinder,ff43swq,t3_erjnwl,1579554920.0,You guys are getting dates? (•O•)
dating,ff419nw,t1_ff413ic,1579553355.0,"If they are interested in me, they should atleast try to make conversation. It should not always be the guy's job"
dating,ff417zs,t1_ff412cu,1579553326.0,Too many guys behind such a girl. Like atleast 3-4 people desperately trying to be with her
dating,ff40xbn,t3_erjblu,1579553142.0,"Having too high standards ?? Lol ? Def want someone intelligent/ambitious and cute. Tough to find such girls and even if I find them, the comptition is too strong and i give it up if after 2-3 talks if they dont start a chat first."
relationship_advice,ff3m96t,t3_ergz28,1579544061.0,Yes. Tell him the truth. He wont mind. Also be sure you only do stuff you feel you are ready for
Tinder,ff3lykx,t3_ergzkm,1579543876.0,Will bowing down on the knee work? Because i so wanna be bonnie
raspberry_pi,ff25s7w,t3_er61p9,1579494596.0,Why do you need an esp8266 with raspi? Raspi already has a wifi module (unless you are using the older version)
Bumble,ff25hwz,t3_er5oem,1579494367.0,"If it was me, the response would have been ""Netaji zinda hai"""
dating,fezc77g,t1_fez8ptu,1579455860.0,"Whats your confusion then? What if all 3 ask you out? From what you say, they all seem interested. What will be your deciding parameters ?"
dating,feywfr0,t3_eqrafc,1579451339.0,"Idk but i would find it weird to date anyone working with me or for me. Flirting and all is fun but when it comes to dating - you would obviously be dating one, right? For me to date anyone, i feel that I should have respect for her. Respect for her work, her intelligence and thoughts. Would you be having respect for your students or your gym instructor or would you be commanding them? A thought to ponder upon"
cscareerquestions,feyrmrr,t3_eqk7lp,1579449762.0,I worked as an intern in a big finance company as a soft dev intern about an year and a half back. Most of the people in tech there were from TCS. Seen all sorts of people everywhere. It just shows that you worked on yourself and that is a good thing. I believe that one should never lie on resumes - it can only create difficulties
hacking,fexok1j,t3_equo2o,1579434087.0,"Get one with a long antenna or you would regret it like me lol. Alfa is what i have heard of. Search it , you would find the model no. Null byte website might help"
dating_advice,feupcem,t3_eqk4j2,1579388725.0,"Honestly, one in which the girl is open enough to communicate and share things. Like having a true communication. Activities don't matter much as long as we are enjoying. Saying that, personally i would like walking around a silent toad and talking, checking out a new place selling crazy food ( many in my city), laser tag and other stuff as suggested by others can be fun. Anything from discussing US's foreign policies to talking about events can be fun depending upon things. There is nothing called a ""perfect date"". All we need is the perfect person."
offmychest,fesr1ps,t3_eqhkim,1579368104.0,Time won't stop and no one can make it stop. It would be best to do all sorts of things you would like to do with your grandmom right now. Though I won't recommend taking much gap in your career. Maybe you can take up a job you can do from home ? Like a remote software engineering job . Those pay off well and you can be with your grandma in the house at the same time. Also the money would help do all the things. Maybe take your grandma on a vacation ? To a peaceful place she likes being in?
offmychest,feso4xc,t3_eq45hr,1579367315.0,This is beautiful !! Gonna do this
offmychest,fes8q9i,t3_eqfx3y,1579362606.0,"As a person having an ECE degree, my advice will be to focus on particular companies. Embedded system soft dev companies are few and mostly startups. You should target companies, build projects that solve real life problems and you are good to go. Focus on companies that give importance to skills than degrees. You are lucky start ups do that a lot than MNC's that want degrees. Best of luck! Ping me if you want help on project ideas or something"
