Eat turmeric+ginger+black pepper in combo, first two are great about anti-inflammation and have good noortopic properties, and third improves their bioavailability.

Drink more water, 3-4 liters per day if you have a healthy kidneys and eat sea salt.

HIIT is great type of exercise cuz it boosts your metabolism so your per day calorie consumption will be up to 500ccal higer.

Sleep is not only about lying down for several hours which you can make up in several parts, it is whole and very complicated process with a lot of different phases and a lot of stuff is going on in your brain. Changing of cerebral fluid which lowers your adenosin level in brain which is actually toxic, growing new dopamine receptors and growing actually everything else cuz somathotropine rises when you sleep good + you are kinda processing learned info. So it is better to spend 3 hours studying and 8 hours sleeping then 4 hours studying and 7 hours sleeping.

Cold exposure(Wim Hof method) is well studiet now, it can improve your memory cuz it rises your agmatine which affects your glutamate which is needed to form new synaptic connections and myeliene around it.
