Honestly, you keep up this amazing attitude towards bad situations, and I can guarantee you that you will have many more amazing days in the future, and they don't even need to be your birthday.

AskReddit,fcwp3bh,t3_ejavqj,1578032239.0,"This is an interesting question.

I wasn't bullied much. But the school I went to was pretty authoritarian and bully friendly.

An acquaintance was apparently being bullied emotionally for having a birthmark on his face. As you can imagine, it messed him up pretty bad and there wasn't much we could do since the teachers would joke about it too.

So, one day, he just went up to the teacher who pulled this kind of shit, and slammed his face against a metal goal post.

The teacher severely damaged his left eye and left our school after his recovery.

Without a doubt the student got immediately expelled and there were multiple posts on Facebook about student brutality and how harder rules needed to be implemented.

I distinctly remember him making no fuss when the authorities came to pull him away, he didn't feel the need to explain why he did it. He just looked at the ground.

Last I heard, he ended up in juvenile prison a few years later and was able to get out. Haven't heard from him or the teacher since.


I guess what I'm saying is, revenge isn't always perfect and clean. It's a very messy way to go. I'm just glad I never had to deal with stuff like this too much."
