DoesAnybodyElse,ff33rjw,t3_er7jbc,1579532930.0,"I do now, yes. I have daily struggles in my life because of psychological issues. It was way worse before because it took up much of my life, and made me ""wish I had it better"". The thing is, I had an amazing person in my life at that time, and overall an amazing relationship with this woman. Now I don't anymore, basically because of these psychological issues consuming my life, as it began consuming her's as well. I spent so much of my life worrying and wishing I could get over certain things to the point that I lost sight of what I already had that was very special to me.

Now I do not struggle as much daily. I still have germaphobia for example, but I no longer go through the OCD struggles I used to that would consume much of my time of each day due to how long I'd be in the bathroom. I forced myself to basically get over this when I realized what this kind of behavior caused me to lose.

The thing is I miss her very much, and sure it's great I've started to get past my psychological issues, but I want her back. We talked daily during lunch, we spent each night together. Rarely did we do things outside of work without each other. We were best friends on top of dating. It felt perfect, and I lost sight of it. Don't end up like me."

But no one would do that because alcohol has been considered ok by society as a whole. Good point though, guess you got me."

It's absolutely possible every X minutes it's incrementing, we just might not be seeing enough footage to determine how often it actually increments. It also wouldn't be difficult at all to have some kind of randomized behavior implemented as well in terms of the delay."
videos,fd799v1,t1_fd6oben,1578201109.0,What you are proposing and assuming is a LOT more expensive than simply programming this to increment every X seconds or minutes.

There's no reason to ""update"" something that simply programaticslly does math every X seconds/minutes.

It also helps to not let them have much slack while training this. Force them to stay by your side, not allowing them to lead which happens when you let them stay in front."
