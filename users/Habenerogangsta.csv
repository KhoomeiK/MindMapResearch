relationship_advice,fdthxhi,t3_emzipy,1578717008.0,"I would say before taking any decision, sit with her and discuss what you are thinking about the whole situation and how it's making you feel. Because I was in the same situation couple of years ago. She was my first ever relationship. She was so possessive of me, she couldn't even stand any girl standing within 10 feet radius around me, always checks my phone when I'm texting someone or anyone to see if it's a girl. We both fought for 2 weeks over a girl who lives in another continent, just because she commented 'good picture' on one of the scenic pictures that I took and I replied 'thank you'. She cried for 2 weeks on that simple issue. I realized the situation is getting really bad and I broke up with her. 
After couple of years, I still regret the decision I made. I still love her and still feel sad every time I think of her. 
I try to phrase it simply for you 
1) yes, break up can effect grades. But think about it this way, apart from the strict rules that she set, if you think you can live happily with her, and you two make a good pair, then give it some time 
2) She is really young and some girls of her age do behave and think in a weird way. Sit down with her and explain to her that we all live in a society, where we do need to make friends and live a social life. Try to make her understand how her rules are making you feel, if this continues then it will definitely effect the relationship. Tell her that you are trying and willing to put some effort from your side in this relationship to understand her and make her happy, at the same she needs put some effort too! 
If possible, both of you try to meet a therapist or relationship counselor. That will definitely help to look at things from both individual perspectives and clear lot of things."

I told him 0.7. Then he asked me again what lead size do I want? I said 0.5 mm, coz I was dumb and I didn't know, and he gave it to me. I realized how dumb I was when I went home and tried to put 0.5 mm lead in 0.7 mm pencil, they just slipped through. I went back and asked him why did he gave mismatched sizes? He said because I asked for it!!! Well, he could've corrected/helped me, but he didn't! I hate him"
