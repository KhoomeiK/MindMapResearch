I understand that it might not be the best representation of the data, but it's really not that hard to understand."
Pathfinder_RPG,fer5uee,t3_epv4lm,1579350209.0,"How would you self-disable when mind-controlled?

My blockbuster wizard averages ~350dmg/round, and she has 2 scrolls of time stop and the delay spell metamagic feat. If I get mind controlled my whole party gets wiped out (don't worry too much about me being OP, the whole party is very experimented in pathfinder and I expect the other members to be just as strong in different areas. The party is comprised of 2 wizards and a shaman).

What are the best spells or relatively cheap items to protect me from killing my whole party on a failed save? If I delay just one turn any member of the party can probably take me out before I do damage.

I was thinking of contingency+another spell."
space,feqw79v,t1_fepf4gk,1579346819.0,"this whole debris thing is a bit overblown. If you are not in LEO or geostationnary it isn't an issue.

There is little to no reason to put something in a higher than geostationnary orbit, so there's pretty much nothing there."
Pathfinder_RPG,feanvct,t1_f1mu5mk,1578950692.0,I guess you could have a familiar or animal companion with a wand of this and maxxed out use magic item.

Destroy their identity, relocate their member, settle han chinese there, and when that doesn't work there's always concentration camps."
Pathfinder_RPG,fdqhc59,t1_fdoxxcl,1578666680.0,Not really... it is explicitly encouraged to houserule away broken shit. The gm is very clearly supposed to forbid items and feats that are broken.
chess,fdavwsy,t1_fdav9n0,1578250936.0,Not that much. Social pressure is insane. Less than in Iran obviously but still.

todayilearned,fcuvhzv,t1_fcuue5m,1577989390.0,Maybe you went right after high tide? You gotta wait just before low tide
todayilearned,fcuu4g5,t1_fcutk50,1577988538.0,"Well it's warmed up by the sun only, and there isn't just one, there are many like that. Of course it only works in summer.

They aren't really pools, they are just places which are underwater at high tide and above water at low tide. So they get filled up with new water (therefore they are somewhat clean) at high tide, and they get gradually warmed up by the sun until it's high tide again.

Last time I went was more than 10 years ago."
todayilearned,fcuskwb,t1_fcukzzm,1577987678.0,"No I meant gannets apparently, which are closely related to boobies.

They do have puffins as well but it's harder to spot them. Either that or they weren't there when we went."
todayilearned,fcuse29,t1_fcuiucw,1577987561.0,yeah that's the one.
todayilearned,fcui0an,t1_fcuc2dl,1577981424.0,"I went there, lovely island.

It has ""ponds"" which are filled at high tide and then you can go into them at low tide, at which point the water is warmed by the sun.

It has quite a bit of natural life, with nearby booby (I think that's the name of the bird) colonies, and a lot of marines species of birds.

Island itself is quite small, you can go all around it easily and the people are friendly, it's also not particularly touristic and there are no cars, which makes it pretty calm."
HowDoIRespondToThis,fcqtbct,t1_fcpf6ky,1577891877.0,"You don't owe anyone any respect but it's nice to give ot anyway. Say something generic about not clicking then specify a few stuff he did wrong. If he insist then ghost.

As a person it is really hard for me to understand what i do wrong when interacting with people, be it friendships or love. I understand ghosting, i have also done it to assholish poeple, but if someone is nice enough it doesn't cost you a lot to just help him improve himself. At worst you can still ghost him thereafter if he keeps insisting.

Just because you don't owe people doesn't mean you can't be nice to them. I don't owe a tourist to give him directions  but i'm still gonna do it if he's lost, it makes the world a better place."
AskReddit,fck9p4a,t1_fck0cbe,1577720328.0,"Did you know that you can walk right under where the hiroshima detonated with a geiger counter and it'll indicate normal radioactive activity, lower than in many cities where no nuclear bomb ever exploded?

The long term effects of radiation from nuclear bomb or even dirty bombs is vastly overestimated. What is true is that radiation poisoning is an absolutely awful way to die, but cleaning up radiation is comparatively relatively easy."
