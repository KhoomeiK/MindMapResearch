California_Politics,ff7nbgk,t1_ff7n0yr,1579653656.0,"State regulators have reviewed 133 studies about acetaminophen, all of which were published in peer-reviewed journals. Some studies reported an increased risk of some types of cancers, while others did not. Overall, the review noted acetaminophen has been difficult to examine because it is hard to isolate it from other variables that could contribute to cancer, such as smoking.


A panel of scientists appointed by the governor can add chemicals to this list. In 2011, the panel voted to make acetaminophen a ‚Äúhigh priority‚Äù for consideration because it believed there was relevant evidence to consider, according to Sam Delson, spokesman for the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.


The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group representing over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements, conducted its own review and found most studies suggest no risk for most forms of cancer, although some studies did show increased risk for kidney, liver and some forms of blood cancer."

On another post, I found



Civil eng here. You need to understand why the foundation is moving before you fix. If it's expansive clays, that is one thing, or if it's just typical settlement it's another. I do large commercial buildings (5+ stories), and we typically design foundations for 1/2"" differential settlement. You have almost 2"" differential settlement in some places. This is very high. Differential settlement places internal stress on the whole structure, so it's likely there is damage to the framing, roof, etc. that you cannot see. Also, plumbing slopes may now be off which is another issue altogether. 

I'd at least get another 2 estimates. Maybe even have a structural engineer come evaluate. Don't trust any estimate/assessment by the Seller. 

If it were me, I'd bail. A ""perfect home"" cannot have a foundation that is shifting. If you buy, you will likely be dealing with this for decades. So, it's up to you.
