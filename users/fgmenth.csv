Επίσης για κάποιο λόγο αντί για γλάρους έχουμε παπαγάλους, αλλά κανείς δεν δίνει σημασία."
wow,fdg67np,t1_fdg5yik,1578381654.0,"Oh yeah, that didn't use to be the case. When you tamed a beast it actually used to stay that way, but people abused it and they tamed beasts that were permanently on fire, or were permanently transformed to oozes or (the most annoying one) were incredibly huge. Even though it was fun, the developers deemed that it was game breaking so everything gets removed when you tame it now."
wow,fdg5kw6,t1_fdg4y5s,1578380918.0,"All the exotic pets are unique to BM. Specifically: Chimaeras, Clefthooves, Core Hounds, Devilsaurs, Krolusks, Pterrodaxes, Quilen, Rylaks, Shale Spiders, Silithids, Spirit Beasts, Water Striders and Worms.

I get what you mean though. A rare pet that its appearance **actually** stays rare."
wow,fdg3xr1,t1_fdfzhyd,1578379083.0,I've been maining a hunter since early TBC and I agree 110%. MoP hunter was the best it's ever been. After that it was prune after prune until the class became a generic DPS without much utility. I'm hoping with the unpruning in Shadowlands we'll get some of it back.

programming,fc99w76,t1_fc5ow15,1577549400.0,Hahah sorry about that. The reason I wrote it like this is because I'm used to pressing it with just my right hand instead of using both. On the right side of the keyboard it's Alt+Ctrl+Del (from left to right)
programming,fc55lje,t1_fc55dmh,1577444369.0,"There are multiple ways. 

Win -> Tab -> Down Arrow until you reach the shutdown button

Win + X -> Shutdown

Win + D -> Alt + F4 -> Enter

Alt + Ctrl + Del -> Tab until you reach Shutdown

Win + R -> type ""shutdown /s /t 0""

just to name a few"

howdidtheycodeit,fbx64o5,t3_eeraag,1577170996.0,As [he said himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/37b1lk/oc_i_made_a_planet_generator/crl5s0y/?context=10000) he didn't use 3D at any point and this was made in GameMaker. So in that context my guess is that he is randomly generating a map and then uses a spherical projection to make it look 3d. Probably doing [something like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18264703/mapping-a-2d-grid-onto-a-sphere).
