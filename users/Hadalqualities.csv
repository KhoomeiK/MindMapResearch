There was way more complaints than that, and also some I never knew about (I was never big on forums so I missed most of it.). The fact some parts of the game were only updated a couple years ago although graphics were atrocious, the fact Nineland seems to have stagnated in her artworks and still draw girls with flat faces and no details just like ten years ago, the fact beemove really wanted to focus on their dating sim instead of Ma Bimbo, the design contests, not opening up the Steampunk, Halloween and Christmas world even though now they mostly have dropped the game and it wouldn't change anything... Other complains I remember now : The fact she had a roomate for a while and people thought she was a girlfriend/wanted her to have a girlfriend, the fact it took years for them to include skin swatches and not just tell the players you're more or less tan because you used the tanning bed (ie defaulting the bimbo to a white, just more or less tan girl), etc... I could go on forever.

Thank you for this post, that was so fun to read. I never knew her talking in babytalk was bothering people, but man do I see it."

JusticeServed,fdr3ppv,t1_fdpsywv,1578679099.0,"> I’ve had this discussion a few times, and weirdly, women usually use the exact same arguments as anti-abortion people - “he should take responsibility”, “just don’t have sex”, “just use protection” or some other irrelevant nonsense.

How is any of that irrelevant nonsense? You don't want a child, you make damn sure you're not getting any of your gametes into a woman. Period."

You don't have any obligation anymore, and we all should strive to be our best even when hitched. Why would someone stay if there's red flags? You don't HAVE to be in a relationship. you don't HAVE to try and make it work for years with little to no results. You don't have to lose years of your life trying to fix something that doesn't want to admit is broken.

Dump them, save yourself years of headaches or worse. People who whine that ""dump them"" is a easy solution are projecting their insecurities and wish they could do nothing to better themselves and never be dumped despite that. They want infinite chances. Well fuck that. Get good or be ditched.

Trying to make the relationship work at all cost is how we get abused partners that don't feel legitimate to leave because ""I should give them another chance, after all relationships hurt, right??"""
