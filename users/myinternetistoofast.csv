But my theory can coexist with yours, and I very much like how the daughter cant be corrupted. Maybe he infected her like he infected Jack, so he can acess her brain like he does at nights"

I dont think The Outsider took human form when he got Terrys blood. I think he was in the form of Doppelnurse when he got Terrys blood and started shaping into Doppelterry. 

Terrys father could also be involved. Perhaps The Outsider remotely infected Terrys father for a while like it is with Jack now. Maybe it turned Terrys father insane.

It could have beem doing this for ages, or maybe Terrys father discovered it in his youth or something."
