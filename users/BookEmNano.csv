valencia,ff9v9r1,t3_esgyv0,1579722243.0,It’s fine.
dogs,ff9jw07,t1_ff9jlee,1579714563.0,"100% try it. One of my mutts was particularly anti-clippers. Brought the stress of trimming her nails down from a 9.5 to a 0.

There’s a few different coarseness options for the trimmer head. Go with one of the fine options. If it’s too coarse it can sometimes chip the nail off instead of smoothly trimming it down. Not a big deal either way, just a heads up."
PlantedTank,ff9dodg,t3_esc58q,1579710746.0,"This tank looks like shit. You should just send it to me, I’ll deal with the eye sores."
dogs,ff8e0w8,t3_es3qbm,1579674544.0,Have you considered a Dremel rotary tool instead of clippers? Was a total game changer for me.
Parenting,ff8df57,t1_ff8d78q,1579673876.0,"If you find a truly great gym/owner, you can tell him what you’re dealing with at home. He could then emphasize that he’ll be checking in with you and if he hears bad reports, no training. Not sure what size city you live in, but you should have a good chance at finding a great gym. Many martial arts/boxing gym owners get into the business largely because they’re passionate about molding young boys into men."
offmychest,ff8d6ma,t3_es61zw,1579673619.0,"This isn’t petty. Your current job is a student. You didn’t perform as well as you wanted to at work and are feeling badly about it. Totally normal. You should 100% speak with your professor. Given your history of good grades, he/she will almost assuredly work with you to improve the grade. Perhaps a little extra tutoring, a test retake, some extra credit. 

Students don’t engage with their teachers nearly enough when things like this happen. Trust me, they’re not doing it for the money, they want to see you succeed."
dogs,ff8coof,t1_ff8caun,1579673095.0,"Well you’ve got him contained and have vet appointments lined up, so there’s no reason to make a rash decision until your head clears. You say his recall is great, what happened that we wouldn’t get out of the truck even with food incentive?"
dogs,ff8ckyi,t1_ff8ccxc,1579672986.0,Certainly nobody wants their income producing goat killed by a dog. I just meant that to say you don’t euthanize a dog because it killed a cat.
Parenting,ff8c5wy,t1_ff7mkko,1579672556.0,"14 year old boys don’t have a ton of interest in female role models, from my experience. If he’s shown an interest in boxing you should definitely pursue that avenue, or some other martial art. It’s tougher thru his school club, but if you could get him signed up at a gym where the owner emphasizes respect and discipline I suspect you’d see some changes."
dogs,ff8br6b,t1_ff8b7qs,1579672141.0,"Glad to hear that you’re not willing to chance it. 
Rehoming would break your heart more than his. He’s a dog. But how likely are you to find someone willing to take in a huge mastiff with a history of biting his owner in the face? 

Sure it could be medical, but how will you ever know? If, say, his thyroid levels were off and you got them back in line, would that alleviate all your concerns? He’s killed multiple small animals (not really a huge deal imo), but more importantly injured you three times. And from the sounds of it, you don’t have great recall or command over him. I feel like a dick writing this and being so adamant about euthanasia, but I just want to be an un-emotionally attached voice of reason. Like you said, you could have lost an eye."
dogs,ff8ayqz,t1_ff8ab9n,1579671363.0,"Yeah, that cranky line was what I was basing my assumption off of. You’re in a terrible spot, for sure. But we’re talking about a very large dog, and an aggressive breed at that. Do you have kids? Or do much hosting?"
dogs,ff89zwx,t3_es6yn1,1579670445.0,"135 lb Mastiffs that bite their owners in the face are dangerous. From the sounds of it there’s probably more acts of aggression than were even mentioned here. You don’t have control over this animal. If it had bitten anyone other than you there wouldn’t even be a discussion. As an owner of three dogs I don’t say this lightly, but euthanizing it isn’t the last resort, it’s the obvious answer."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ff83uzq,t3_es308o,1579665281.0,"Carnitas! Cook a huge batch, save the juice, freeze it. When it’s eating tim broil an appropriate amount with said juice drizzled on top."
relationship_advice,ff80bdx,t1_ff7jctt,1579662677.0,"I graduated high school with a guy who got the name of the girl he lost his virginity to (Barbie) tattooed on his back like a name on a jersey. She was not a virgin, and was not impressed. Her reaction was “we aren’t even exclusive.” 

Dude then had to get this ridiculously massive Barbie tattoo covered up because he couldn’t afford to remove it, so he got a MASSIVE Boston College eagle, completely filled in ink, looks like shit. And no, he didn’t go to BC, it was the first suggestion of the tattoo artist."
steak,ff6ubnh,t3_erwtnl,1579635041.0,"Anova owner here. My whole family consistently complained about my sous vide steaks being tougher and just generally much worse than when I cook them on cast iron. Like you said, they looked beautiful but they just weren’t that good. I tried altering a few things like cook time and temperature but they always kind of sucked. Gave up and went back to cast iron."
Kombucha,fel3p4s,t1_fekm02l,1579213386.0,"Her fermenter definitely doesn’t qualify as nice. It’s just that entry level plastic jug you see all over the internet with like a cheesecloth lid. I think a proper fermenter built to last like this is a good option. I do feel, though, that I’ve heard her mentioning wanting to do a bunch of different flavors. Is that done at a later step? Do you brew one master batch in a thing like this first?

Also cheers for those two cleaning products. On the list!"
Kombucha,fel1ngg,t1_fekx0c7,1579212117.0,Damn that is sexy!
Kombucha,fel1j7z,t1_fekygbw,1579212046.0,"Well thank you, but I’ll take my bow once the station is complete and unveiled. My wife is an amazing woman and I’m just really excited to see her be able to focus on herself and having fun with a new hobby."
Kombucha,fekfv5c,t1_fekdbzz,1579199175.0,"Great, thanks!"
Kombucha,fekfsew,t1_fekdvtm,1579199129.0,"I’ll 100% update. Going to evaluate our space options and will post with tentative plans for a fermentation station, complete with temperature controlled cabinet. In fact, I’m feeling so motivated about this project that I think I’m going to expand the idea and incorporate a dedicated soap making station, which was a budding hobby of hers before two back-to-back babies sent that hobby packing to a storage bin."
Kombucha,fekffl6,t1_fekdwme,1579198917.0,"Googling water keifer now...

Now that I think about it, I really don’t drink anything other than water and the occasional glass of orange juice. I’ve never liked carbonated drinks and the kombucha is just very intense and ferment-y. Sounds like there are adjustments that can be made though, and that will be a fun part of the process of us doing it together."
Kombucha,fekf589,t1_fekei0i,1579198747.0,"Ok, so a no-brainer failsafe component of my gift package should be ordering Grolsh beer bottles? We’re in Spain and she has a hard time finding commercial kombucha, thus the spur to brew it."
Kombucha,fekb3me,t1_fejg3pr,1579196347.0,I see you differentiating between kegerator and keezer. Will she need to keep different stages at different temps or something? Why the need for near freezing temps?
Kombucha,fekam5k,t1_fek58ix,1579196061.0,"Your post and a couple others have made me realize that time spent partaking in the hobby with her will be valued just as much as whatever I end up building. Seems obvious when I read it back to myself, but sometimes us guys lose sight of this."
Kombucha,fekaekh,t1_fek9wpn,1579195938.0,So in these kind of setups you just refrigerate the un-carbonated kombucha in a keg and inject the carbonation in-line into the tubing as it’s flowing up to the tap?
Kombucha,feka9qg,t1_fek8dd5,1579195860.0,Sorry this may be a dumb question but what would I be volunteering to peel the labels off of? Like the glass mineral water bottles she stores it in?
Kombucha,fek9wsa,t1_fek237l,1579195649.0,pH meter! Of course!
Kombucha,fejyo7j,t1_fejg3pr,1579188844.0,"These are great ideas! Thanks! 

I don’t know if we have the kitchen space to pull off a boocherator, but she would flip out if I built her a fermentation station. Would the heating pad sit on the floor with the kombucha directly on top of it, or is that too direct of heat? Probably better just heating the ambient air with a temperature gauge turning it on and off?

If I were to go ahead with the cabinet build, I should probably incorporate some drawers and tool storage as well. What kind of items should I be designing around in terms of space tolerances?"
Kombucha,fejy7mj,t1_fejo5he,1579188553.0,"You are 100% right in so far as I definitely need to be more active in tasting her brews and looking for the positives. I’m going to ask her about sampling it or maybe bottling me some of my own earlier in the process, because hell yeah I love sweet tea. I also love the apple juice idea. Thanks!"
Kombucha,fejy1qg,t1_fejh5vo,1579188450.0,She does. This is what she’s basing her recipes off of.
relationship_advice,fedke6f,t1_fed5es8,1579013722.0,Points 1 and 5 are particularly spot on.
functionalprint,fecolyp,t1_feb8t8z,1578979237.0,How many hours does this project represent?
offmychest,feco3cf,t3_eo4j99,1578978818.0,"I got my mind blown with the concept of a shame box. Anything that brings you shame, write it down on a piece of paper and put that shit in a box. Visualize that someone else could come by, open the box, take the piece of paper and start carrying the burden instead of you.  I resisted the idea a bit at first, was obviously even ashamed to need a shame box. But the physicality of the exercise really helped hammer the point through my thick skull. At some point you elect to pick up and carry these pieces of shame with you. Why not take them off? This was the most helpful tool I received on the journey to learn that You. Are. Not. Your. Thoughts."

FoodLosAngeles,fc8oi5v,t1_fc68ty2,1577539078.0,"I went to the place on the corner of Sawtelle that always has a crowd. Right next to ROC, which I love. Rancid was probably a lazy description. I remember the broth being overpowering with a fermented taste, or something I was extremely unused to. There’s really very few foods I don’t enjoy, less that I can’t even get down, but this was one of them. We ended up bailing and walking over to Tatsu Ramen, which is always good."

Parenting,fbsv97z,t1_fbspxib,1577061198.0,"Honestly I wouldn’t worry too much about him missing out on this social interaction, if you can even call it that. He probably sees plenty of them in school. 

Have you thought about enrolling him in a martial art? In my humble opinion, it should be required for all boys. There’s always the possibility that he’s spending all his time in his room and online because he’s not terribly confident in the real world. Learning how to defend himself would help tremendously if that’s the case."
