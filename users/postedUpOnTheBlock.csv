politics,feslnj2,t1_fesd63l,1579366526.0,"Those that work in places like the pentagon do wear formal uniforms everyday. That couldn’t possibly work for those that don’t work in an office setting and VERY inconvenient even if you did. 
1. The dress uniforms get dirty really easily. 
2. Most of us only have one set of each type of dress uniform. They are very expensive and we buy all our own uniforms. 
3. They can only be dry cleaned so the bill would really add up. 
4. Oh did I mention they’re really expensive and we buy all of our own uniform items."

We were over seas at the time and he would use internet calling. I paid for the internet and was letting him use it. As pay back, whenever his arguments would get heated, I’d log into the router from my iPad and shut the internet off. I did the same thing when I heard him strangling his chicken to porn. He’d freak out and curse the crappy internet which was actually pretty fast. He just had no idea what I was doing."

It’s when people start saying I’m not attracted to you because of this or that is when you run into issues. If they’re not attracted to your height, body, or personality then so what. They should just leave it at “I’m just not attracted to you” or “you’re just not my type” and both can be satisfied with that."
