socialanxiety,femib4f,t3_epqfuc,1579257024.0,"There’s plenty of helpful posts, for support or advice. I personally find the memes somewhat uplifting. I like laughing at my misery."
socialanxiety,femi9vj,t3_epqjlx,1579256973.0,"Yep. Always the Quiet One. Being called that fucks with your brain. I can’t talk at all after that. I get branded as quiet, and I brand myself as quiet, and now I can barely speak at all at the office unless I’m spoken to."
socialanxiety,femi7sx,t3_epqyup,1579256889.0,"Aye, humans do suck. I agree. So you find yourself not wanting to spend time around people at all? Like, is it because you feel anxious, or just generally? If the anxiety wasn’t there, would you wanna spend time with them? Or maybe you need to surround yourself with some new people. People sometimes grow apart from each other, and that’s natural."
socialanxiety,femi1gk,t3_epu3bl,1579256625.0,"I don’t know. Try to not think about it too much. Smile to people, and greet them, and then do your work. If a conversation happens naturally, so be it."
socialanxiety,femhtq2,t3_epwucs,1579256301.0,"I wanted to do that too. An additional problem for me is that not many artists of the ones I care about actually come to my country. So if I wanted to go to a concert, I would have to go alone in a foreign country. Which seems somewhat scary and I don’t know if I’m brave enough for it. And I just don’t have friends I could ask to come with me."
socialanxiety,femhqk4,t3_epy469,1579256165.0,"I understand that feeling! You know, when you go long periods of time without having a proper conversation with anyone, it kinda fucks with your head. And for me, even the simplest shortest normal conversation that goes somewhat well can snap me out of that. This also happens surprisingly rarely for me."
socialanxiety,femhmmw,t1_feikwnj,1579256003.0,"Good luck to you, friend. I hope we both manage to figure it out one day."
socialanxiety,femhl2z,t1_fegumpm,1579255937.0,"I tried seeking help. I’ve been going to therapy but it makes me feel awkward and I shut down and unable to talk about what’s bothering me because I feel like all my worries are stupid. It’s always the same kind of scenario all over again of me being anxious over a social situation and I feel like my therapist is tired of that too. And when I shared it with my doctor, they said it must not be that bad if I shared it with them, and gave me some passionflower extract thing. I feel so stupid but work is so hard for me to get through every day, everything just feels like hell, it just isn’t living."
socialskills,femdd33,t1_fekbkm9,1579249722.0,"I see what you mean. But then, where do you draw the line between understanding and accepting your anxiety, and giving into it?  Because I understand why I feel anxious, but I still can’t help but beat myself up over it, and telling myself that I need to be better."
depression,femd8t5,t1_fekh637,1579249556.0,"I think the “wake up early, see the sun, do some cardio” method would do good to everyone as long as they manage to pull it off and turn it into a habit. Whenever I put in the time and effort to work out, I feel immensely better, even if it’s just for 20 minutes, and yet I still get too lazy to do anything on most days."
socialanxiety,femd336,t1_felofmx,1579249339.0,"Good luck to you! Yeah, there are lots of resources, and this subreddit is very helpful too. But creating new habits is such a hard thing, once you’ve gotten used to behaving in a certain way. CBT workbooks, therapy, I like the idea of those things, but therapy hasn’t particularly helped me, and I find it hard to find time to work on CBT stuff on my own, even though I found some great books (still haven’t gotten around to reading more than a couple of chapters of Feeling Good by David Burns)."
r4r,fektyjs,t3_epoft1,1579207546.0,so you’re not literally dying...
depression,fektn5j,t3_epmwv5,1579207359.0," Keep going, and trust that life has something in store for you. You sound like a nice enough guy."
shadowhunters,fekibxz,t1_fejtuq9,1579200643.0,NOOO THAT’S SO SAD. SO HE HAD IT EVEN WORSE IN THE BOOKS. That’s not even close to a happy ending. My poor boy.
depression,fejj2ok,t3_ephq3m,1579176401.0,"No, it’s not an excuse. Not wanting to do anything isn’t a pleasant place to be at, it sucks, and it’s hard to get through, so I’m sorry that you’re feeling this way."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fejhr17,t3_epfp77,1579174803.0,"Oh, you mean The Philosopher’s Stone?"
depression,fejh3tc,t3_ephb69,1579173961.0,"Honestly, it doesn’t matter. Because if you’re feeling depressed, unless you go out and try to distract yourself by keeping yourself busy with other stuff, it’s gonna be really hard for you to snap out of it. I’m obviously not an expert and I’m still struggling myself too, but I know from experience that the more I close myself off and do nothing, the worse I feel. So try taking smaller steps towards being more active and outgoing.

Also, it’s really cheesy and overused as an advice, but exercising genuinely helps. It’s hard to stick to it and incorporate it as a part of a routine, but it’s worth giving it a try."
socialskills,fejgosl,t1_fej59bb,1579173402.0,"That was very nice of you to say, thank you. Best of luck to you too!"
lonely,fejgmgp,t3_epghwg,1579173311.0,"I get what you’re saying, but just because there’s a bunch of horny guys on Tinder that we get to choose from in case we get super desperate, doesn’t mean “loneliness is harder to evade”. I mean I get what you’re saying, but then, I don’t think this is how things work. It’s a lot more complicated."
shadowhunters,fejebne,t1_fehtyqa,1579169918.0,Yeah! He seemed happy but. I think he could have been ever happier and I think he deserved more recognition. I don’t know.
shadowhunters,fejeadj,t1_fehti2c,1579169866.0,"I’ve only read one of the books, and a long time ago, so I don’t know what happened there. Did something different take place in the books?

I will say, David Castro is pretty darn charming, so maybe that has influenced my opinion of Raphael too a little bit...."
Scrubs,fejaxha,t3_epcf1s,1579164805.0,I’d pick J.D or Dr. Cox. Don’t know about Turk. Maybe if I needed a surgical opinion but otherwise nah.
socialskills,fej3ajd,t1_feirfzk,1579155291.0,"That’s true, not caring at all isn’t a good thing either. But then, when I’m around people who I respect a lot and appreciate, I often feel more anxious than ever, because I want to impress that person, and I really really don’t want to disappoint them. And in my effort to do that, my anxiety goes out of control and I’m unable to act the way I intended.

That being said, I’ve met a couple of individuals in my life that are so inspiring, so completely opposite of me, and the epitome of everything I want to be in a way that- you feel accepted by them, because you can tell that they don’t really care about you being more anxious or whatever it is that you are insecure about."
depression,feizeli,t1_feir2zv,1579151572.0,"Watching very sad movies sometimes works for me. I know it sounds stupid but something like Titanic or Atonement almost always makes me cry.
Or maybe try writing your feelings down on paper, if you haven’t done that already. I rarely remember to do that, but when I do, it feels a lot better, and it makes you more aware of what you’re feeling, so perhaps it’ll have a similar therapeutic effect. 
Hm. Or talking things out with someone, being completely honest with them? If you don’t have a friend you would feel comfortable doing that with, maybe a therapist. Either way. Good luck, man."
socialanxiety,fehh03l,t3_ep494b,1579116350.0,"Damn it, brain. 😔"
socialskills,fehgpgi,t3_ep5sor,1579116176.0,"You’re right. I try to remind myself that, but it’s still hard to pretend you don’t care. Anxiety doesn’t always make sense."
depression,fehgjr0,t3_ep3t6s,1579116084.0,Yeah. Sometimes I want to cry real bad so I listen to all the sad songs in an attempt to squeeze a tear out but it ain’t coming out. Crying is very therapeutic. Better to feel sad than to feel nothing at all.
Needafriend,fehgd78,t3_ep5va3,1579115978.0,That’s very interesting. I love the fact that you made a graph for your life and I also love the fact that you communicate through your email. The idea of having a penpal is cool.
socialanxiety,fefypkj,t3_eoobsc,1579069742.0,This is a curse. How does one get out of a vicious cycle like this? It’s like you can never win. You’re anxious because you’re not talking but you’re also too anxious to talk.
socialanxiety,fedclq6,t3_eoktux,1579007661.0,"I’ll tickle you.

depression,fe82u7o,t3_env9a0,1578921843.0,"You don’t have to work a shitty job. You get to choose what you wanna do, and I know that it isn’t always this easy, but you always have a choice. You get to choose the people you want to surround yourself with, you get to choose the goals you work towards, you get to choose what to do in the sometimes limited spare time you have.

And what I’ve learned in the time I’ve had a job is that, ever since I’ve been spending my 9 to 5 in an office, I appreciate my spare time so much more than I have before. It’s hard, but it feels nice to know you’ve done something productive, you’ve earned the money you’ve been given. It ain’t all that bad. Life is unfair, sure, but try not to think about it. Thinking too much doesn’t lead to anything good."

socialanxiety,fe7b49u,t3_ench3j,1578912344.0,Well said
socialanxiety,fdmv6el,t3_em2zua,1578567319.0,"I’m the same way. Wish I had a solution for your problem. Don’t have a lot of job experience, I only have had this one job that I am currently at. It’s an office job and it’s terrible but I’m hoping that when I find something else, something that I enjoy more too, I’ll stumble upon people who are less intimidating, loud, talkative and judgemental, and people whose presence makes me more comfortable.

Don’t give up. Aim for a job that you would genuinely enjoy and feel passionate about and just hope that things will work out better."
socialanxiety,fdmv1v4,t1_fdlzkit,1578567150.0,"That’s what I thought. An entry level office job, that sounds simple enough. No. It’s hell. Being surrounded by people all day. Who are always expecting you to have some kind of small talk with them. And have lunch with them. And then talk more."
socialanxiety,fdmuxhl,t3_em4f0z,1578566985.0,"You may never be ready. But you have to start somewhere anyways. I’m working my first job right now, been 5 months already, and I’m still terrified everyday, and yeah, it’s super hard to do it with anxiety. But I’m proud of myself for still trying everyday, for waking up every morning and facing these challenges even though it doesn’t always seem like I’m making any progress at all.

So yeah. I guess what I’m trying to say is that life is scary but that shouldn’t stop you. Take small steps. The things that scare you the most are the things that help you grow the most. You can do it."
socialanxiety,fdmu3eq,t3_em6gxw,1578565841.0,Thank you too. And I agree. This has been so helpful. I’m very glad this subreddit exists.
socialanxiety,fdgf43p,t3_el9kjz,1578393872.0,"Thank you for sharing this! It makes me happy hearing that others have found a solution because sometimes social anxiety feels like a curse that you just can’t get rid of.

Did you talk to a psychiatrist and ask them to prescribe you something? How does that happen?"
socialanxiety,fdg8x3e,t3_el76zs,1578385058.0,I’m going through the same thing and it’s horrible. About to quit my first job. I would love to chat to you more so we can be partners in suffering.
socialanxiety,fd9lvgz,t3_ekdn8b,1578235135.0,"I feel you, my dude. I’m in the same place. Maybe try working on your confidence first instead of focusing on the social anxiety. Become someone that YOU would like and would hang out with. I know it’s easier said than done but just something to think about."
mbti,fcx7trg,t1_fcx78ge,1578054704.0,You’re welcome! Also it did sound like a joke so you totally could have gotten away with it.
mbti,fcx5rgo,t1_fcx4x5e,1578052386.0,I was just wondering about the part where you said Freud. Wasn’t it Jung who described the cognitive functions.
mbti,fcx2wxj,t1_fcx2syg,1578048861.0,I missed your point too....

socialanxiety,fcwscd7,t1_fcwqer4,1578035639.0,"Oh no. Good luck. If he said you’re a good worker, why would he fire you though?"
socialanxiety,fcwn4xr,t1_fcvos22,1578030385.0,"I did that, and got a job, but I’m not entirely sure if the minimum (which for me personally feels like a lot to begin with) is enough, since I’m constantly ostracized due to my social anxiety and my quietness is always being pointed out in some way. The fact that everyone there is super loud, and that my boss barely has any time to give me any feedback on my work doesn’t help (the only feedback he has given me is to work on my communication skills).

So yeah. I’m losing my sanity and fighting what seems to be a hopeless battle."
socialanxiety,fcu0ej4,t1_fctqfvf,1577968167.0,Thank you for your comment! I’ve been at my office for around 5 months now. It does not seem to be getting any easier. It’s getting increasingly frustrating and I’ve never been more unhappy to be a quiet person.
socialanxiety,fbxi0o7,t3_eez1q9,1577188473.0,"Honestly, sometimes I genuinely feel thankful to people who keep inviting me to things. Because I’m super awkward and shy, and I’m always too afraid that when people find out what I’m really like, they’ll lose interest at all and stop wanting to go out with me at all. Which happens sometimes. That’s why I’m thankful when someone is persistent and actually wants to spend time with me. Unless they’re an asshole or something."
