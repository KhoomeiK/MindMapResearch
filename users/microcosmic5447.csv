There are these comprehensive guides for most vehicle models, and so in theory if you can take it apart piece by piece you can figure out which piece is busted.

politics,ff7w9rj,t1_ff7nvpk,1579659864.0,"Thanks for sharing your experience. I think you're right about a lot.  

**Tl;Dr - All work is exploitative, the more physical the more exploitative, and the most physical work (like sex) will always exist, so those workers need the most protection.**

The military is an interesting analogy. Like the military, sex work is categorically different than most types of labor, so even though all body-labor tends to exploit poverty, we have to be extra-concerned with the well-being of people who undertake that labor.

There are obviously a lot of factors - I think if we lived in a perfect world, where sex wasn't taboo and women weren't oppressed, where people could choose their careers based on passion instead of poverty, an open, legal, normalized sex trade would be wonderful, and I would be interested to see if it attracted workers from all walks of life. If there was a sex booth at the mall and it wasn't a big deal, and if nobody was starving or desperate, maybe all sorts of folks would do it as a summer job when they were 19. 

In our real world, I think that sex work will always exist, and that it will always be more of a draw to impoverished people.

So I guess *right now* it's a matter of protecting the people who find themselves in sex work while we work on the larger problems that make it so dangerously exploitative. I think things that will help include **decriminalization** (bc fuck putting sex workers in a cage), **access to medical care** (including but not limited to mental health and addiction services), **access to safe housing**. I feel like these would mitigate a lot of the harm. Universal Basic Income and Universal Healthcare would, I think, certainly give some people the safety to get out if they want to.

I wanna say legalization and unionization is the best way to protect everybody and start killing the trade of people for sexual slavery. But people who know more about the issue than I do say decriminalization, not legalization, is the smart move right now, so I'll go with them.

Anyway I wrote a lot lol. Good luck to you, and feel free to share any more about your experience or your reasons (either here or in a pm) if you want."
worldpolitics,ff7g8pa,t1_ff6tksy,1579648840.0,"Why do you think private insurance would either adapt or go out of business? There already is (or was) theoretical competition in the market, and it resulted in the current system.

worldpolitics,ff7fiss,t1_ff6x9zs,1579648366.0,"Your quotes from Acts literally describe how the early Jesus Movement embraced socialist values. They did not own property. ""They held all things in common"" is literally communism. ""Giving all you have to the poor"" is redistribution of wealth. And please don't tell me that this redistribution has to be ""voluntary"". The poor aren't *voluntarily* poor, and their starvation doesn't care whether you donate because Jesus told you to or because they State compelled you to.

What matters is that the populace is cared for. There is more than abundance, and it is being unjustly hoarded. 

I myself have rejected the moral authority of Christianity and its texts, but for anybody who *does* still value the moral teachings of bronze-age nomads, those texts are pretty clear that when there are wealthy people in luxury while there are people homeless and starving within the same nation, that nation is economically unjust. Micah doesn't call for individuals to be nicer and share more -- he calls for the nation to take care of its people.

The redistribution of wealth is the very minimum that a just society needs before it can even begin to flourish."

politics,ff76v42,t1_ff745g2,1579642285.0,"I recently spoke with reps for a human trafficking organization, and raised that exact concern to them. I work in the adult business, and told them that many voluntary sex workers I know have serious concerns that trafficking organizations make that work more dangerous, and that their efforts can result in workers being treated as victims or traffickers themselves. I asked if that concern was something they paid attention to, and how they worked to ensure that their efforts were appropriately directed.

They told me, in short, that **there are no ""truly voluntary"" sex workers**. That every trafficked woman *claims* she's making her own choices, but really they're either pressured, manipulated, or addicted into saying that. ""Even if not,"" they told me, ""then you've got a person who was sexually abused or put on the street by a family member at age 13, and can that person *really* be said to be doing it of their on free will?""

It's like the Judeo-Christian history. Modern Judaism and Christianity aren't parent-and-child; they're *siblings*, both of which were spawned from various ancient Judaic traditions.

Now, I run a good store and compensate my people well, and I think that my employees would actually, for the most part, be better at their jobs if they all had healthcare.

politics,fdq3z3z,t1_fdpjim2,1578653729.0,"Frankly even Jesus wasn't all that great

There are some very sweet cherry-pickable Jesus moments, but basically the entirety of the Gospels exist to make the point that Jesus (or, *the community who holds these teachings*) is the one who gets to say how to be friends with God. That's really it. He gives us a little bit of content, and some of it is nice (Love one another) and some of it is not (leave the dead to bury their dead, ignore your parents' rotting corpses and follow me), but the majority of it is *I'm in charge*."

Yeah my wife gets annoyed sometimes because me and her mom are a lot alike. Wife was always a square growing up, mom's an old hippy who always gave her shit for not being bad, not smoking or anything.

I turned my wife onto herb at 22 by being nice about it, and it took several weeks of me and her mom smoking together before she admitted that she did it too, just didn't want her mom to be right lol.

Now MIL has a med card and so every time she comes to see us she brings us presents."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdnenuu,t1_fdn9vbv,1578584191.0,"My wife was iffy about getting the Mirena (great prevention rates and period control, but some slightly higher infection risks, and the horror-stories of a partner/toy/tampon getting caught and *yanking* on the Mirena), so she got Nexplanon (the arm implant).

She loved it. Easy insertion (basically just getting a shot), slowed her periods to almost nothing, then her gyno put her on a mild daily BC pill to finish the periods off completely.

Since I got my vasectomy she got the Nexplanon out, but now she's on continual oral BC and it's still *mostly* killing off her periods"

My mom says that when I was a little kid, I would get up when one of my parents went to shower, sneak into the bathroom and crawl into the cabinet under the sink with a book. A lot of mornings they found me asleep in there.

To this day I love being in bathrooms with the shower running. It's so wasteful and now that I own the house it's getting expensive, but goddam is it soothing. It's like being in a tiny, cozy little cave behind a waterfall except the waterfall is hot and steamy so the cave becomes a sauna."

Now my wife and I argue about what display hutch to buy to show off our smoke collection in the living room, and walking into the house I bought 3 months ago smells like walking into a wonderful purple haze.

trees,fdm03zj,t1_fdlsp8t,1578536634.0,"Thanks! It's the ""Friendship"" from Snoop's *Pounds* collection. Hits like a champ, cool pinched mouthpiece that feels comfy in the lips, and a built-in glass screen. It will cherry an entire bowl if you let it (actually gotta be careful to not waste).

I've only had it a few months so I haven't had to *really* clean it yet. The screen gets pretty cloggy and requires poking out maybe every couple days. But I don't think it'll be tough to take care of otherwise.

My store (I run an adult store that also sells smokeware) carries this, as well as a bubbler and a gorgeous full size bong/rig, from the Snoop collection."
