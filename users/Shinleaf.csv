Drugs clearly have a spectrum of propensity for harm, based on toxicity of active dose, statistical likelihood it'll land you in the hospital, and potential for physical dependency. Anything consumable is potentially abusable, but I'm referring, basically, to the substances that actually kill people, to simplify it. 

https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-rank-recreational-drugs-based-on-how-dangerous-they-are/amp

For example, it's pretty clear that mushrooms are much less prone to cause hospitalization. It's also been observed that they, in most cases, are counter addictive. People tend to develop an aversion towards frequent use after using them. They've even been used in the treatment of other addictions like alcoholism. Another psychedelic, ibogaine, has also yielded a lot of promising results for opiate/opioid addiction.

It's frankly a bit pedantic to say ""all drugs are potentially abusable"". That's really not the point, that's like saying ""all foods can make you fat"". It's a matter of what produces a better possible outcome, because we know that 90% of people can simply be sober with no medicine or vice to turn to."

It's really bizarre watching basically an entire generation with an epidemic lack of capacity to recognize the macroscale effects of their own actions and inaction. Impractical home prices, stagnant wages, tuition drastically outpacing inflation, oligopolistic consolidation of wealth to a handful of companies, unnecessary luxury industries collapsing...this is all product of multiple generations pulling up the ladder behind them after they got theirs, while also not fixing fundamentally flawed systems. The signs of a broken currency, lending, and investment system that favors people who are already hyperwealthy are blatant beyond comprehension, yet what was done about it? Nothing, because they were more concerned with their own wealth than their children's ability to independently survive.

I even say this as someone not really in their crosshairs as much, as I've hit some modest milestones in my life, but I really can't stand how callous and insensitive they are to people in my generation who aren't as lucky as I am.

Still, even 18% less doesn't make a household non-functional. In the US, 91% of nurses are women, and women have a slight majority in medical school now. 47% of the labor force in the US is women. Simple statistics make it quite obvious that women are just as capable of being the providers as men. So the notion that men ""don't have the choice"" is frankly laughable in this age.

Also, working a customer service job for \~10 years helped me be more comfortable talking to people after being a very socially anxious teenager. Essentially quitting drinking was also important, as in the past I would have absolutely just drowned my social anxiety and made a fool of myself on first dates. After that though, all dates that I went on were quite chill, and I was able to get over the social anxiety after the first 5-10 minutes or so of the first date. 

Beyond that, one of the best things was reading Models by Mark Manson, as well as taking time to write out the general type of person that would be compatible with me in terms of values and interests. Having a clear idea of the type of person I was looking for was crucial. Also, knowing where to look was important.

>Over the course of the preceding year, IFAS researchers had dosed a total of 22 other men for the creativity study, including a theoretical mathematician, an electronics engineer, a furniture designer, and a commercial artist. By including only those whose jobs involved the hard sciences (the lack of a single female participant says much about mid-century career options for women), they sought to examine the effects of LSD on both visionary and analytical thinking. Such a group offered an additional bonus: Anything they produced during the study would be subsequently scrutinized by departmental chairs, zoning boards, review panels, corporate clients, and the like, thus providing a real-world, unbiased yardstick for their results.

>In surveys administered shortly after their LSD-enhanced creativity sessions, the study volunteers, some of the best and brightest in their fields, sounded like tripped-out neopagans at a backwoods gathering.

After their 5HT2A neural receptors simmered down, they remained firm: LSD absolutely had helped them solve their complex, seemingly intractable problems. And the establishment agreed. The 26 men unleashed a slew of widely embraced innovations shortly after their LSD experiences, including a mathematical theorem for NOR gate circuits, a conceptual model of a photon, a linear electron accelerator beam-steering device, a new design for the vibratory microtome, a technical improvement of the magnetic tape recorder, blueprints for a private residency and an arts-and-crafts shopping plaza, and a space probe experiment designed to measure solar properties. Fadiman and his colleagues published these jaw-dropping results and closed shop.

There's even been a lot of investigation on this with regards to the Toyota stuck throttle issue. No one could replicate the inability to slow down when the car was locked at full throttle. The average driver simply panics if a throttle sticks and doesn't realize that it's not a huge deal if they know to just stand on the brakes. Obviously there's rare exceptions, like the throttle sticking during a sweeping turn approaching an intersection, or other instances where it would cause an unrecoverable loss of traction, but in most cases it's not a guaranteed crash"

AskMen,fctpii4,t3_eippts,1577952919.0,"The fact that my wife is a published scientist who speaks multiple languages is extremely appealing. I finally have someone I can talk to about all of the engineering and science stuff that I constantly read, study, and think about. I don't find much difficulty in being supportive, or at least in wanting to try my best to be. Also having an Engineering education, and being someone who reads a lot of science journals anyway, makes it pretty easy to not be intimidated, since we have a similar enough way of thinking (although she's smarter and much harder working than I am). So you may want to find someone who has at least studied a field with similar level of intellectual rigor. If not that, then someone who is at least generally secure with themselves, has functioning empathy, and isn't looking for some hyper-""traditional"" woman.

Just keep weeding through the men that aren't worthy of you, to be frank. You'll eventually find one that values your drive and all of your passions, and it will click. Be patient with dating and don't get hung up on people that are ""good enough"". If you haven't already, make sure you have a clear idea of the full scope of what you really value in a partner for the long run before continuing dating, imo. I made sure to take a break from dating for a long while after my previous relationship to do this, and to work on myself, and it's the majority of the reason I ended up finding my wife (on r/r4r actually, of all places).

Yes, men like this are likely dealing with some internal issues of ego, their general value, gender roles, etc. Any reasonably mature man who's compatible with you will not have those issues, and anyone who values what you do will love the fact that you're a scientist. Unfortunately, a lot of men, even well into their 30s, haven't done an adequate amount of inner work to address these types of issues. Not sure why that is, whether it be finding early success in life and not ""needing"" to, being in socially isolated and male dominated work environments, poor upbringing, or what.

So yeah, it might take a bit of searching to find the right person, but that's just the reality of dating. Especially for people who are highly successful like yourself, finding someone who's compatible is always going to be difficult. The average guy just won't have what it takes to keep up with you mentally and otherwise."

The simple issue is that it's incredibly cheap to manufacture new polyethylene and polystyrene products from petrochemicals, unless external costs are priced in.

Also, on the subject of Textiles and sustainability, anyone who thinks cloth bags are vastly more sustainable than multi-use polymer bags needs to research the textile industry. Textiles are one of the most polluting industries on the planet. Dye waste is often just dumped back into fresh water supplies, and the water and energy input into crops is pretty extreme. The lifespan of most cloth products is also usually much lower. On top of the fact that textile manufacturing involves borderline or legitimate slave labor the majority of the time. Just because the product feels more ""natural"" doesn't necessarily mean it's any better for the planet or society, although they certainly can be with the right materials and manufacturing methods"

AmItheAsshole,fcjghba,t1_fcj3fsd,1577686717.0,"Any remotely mature adult develops a filter for their emotions, unless they want to be a social pariah or regularly lose jobs. It's perfectly fine to have emotions, even extreme ones when unexpected things happen, but having zero ability to regulate how and when they are expressed is very abnormal. The husband is a douchebag in this situation also, but OP absolutely needs to figure out a better way to manage her state of mind and how it is expressed. It's called tact, and it's something that any adult that people actually want to spend time around has.

FFS, she's 46 and it sounds like she's never done a single thing along the lines of meditation, yoga, journaling, therapy, or anything remotely geared towards inner work to help manage emotional states. Anyone who hasn't done any of this type of thing to ensure that they can be stable and centered in most social occasions, especially with children are involved, is being highly irresponsible with themselves and their family.

\> but I can’t really control myself when something is so upsetting

This is the key part. It was a gift for her that was the upsetting event. Not a family member being dead or injured, not a natural disaster, not losing means to feed her family, not the full collapse of a relationship. It was a trip that she wanted but didn't get...and she threw a tantrum over it in front of the whole family. Anyone who wants to escape that badly on a trip, such that they'll lose their mind if they aren't able to, needs to recognize where that feeling is coming from. Everyone has the ability to do simple things to improve their state of mind, and no one who's feeling moderately content with themselves would have that sort of reaction over not getting their way, no matter how much of an ass their SO is being. People need to take responsibility for their own emotions and quit giving so much power to their relationship or anything else external to themselves. It's a severely toxic mentality to rely on everyone else to make you happy and keep you sane.

This also isn't uncommon either for people in that age group and older for some reason. There seems to be an epidemic of denial, inflated egos, fear of psychotherapy, and a major lack of mental self-care. Not sure where it comes from, but it's blatant and pervasive, and it really hamstrings younger peoples' ability to trust that our elders are worthy of the baseless amount of respect they perpetually and desperately demand."
UpliftingNews,fcje6vf,t1_fcizsvt,1577684462.0,"The world is getting safer, but people are more aware of issues in the world due to ubiquitous information. In the past, we just had a sheltered and unrealistic view of the world due to less information being at our fingertips.

For example, serial killers were rampant in the 80s in the US, but not everyone had a complete picture of how bad it was. The media landscape of the time made it a lot easier to ignore the threats and pretend everything was okay. Additionally, due to the limited ability for various law enforcement divisions/departments to share information quickly and easily, serial killers could just move to another state and continue their activity without remotely as much risk of being caught as today.

It's also easy to indulge in paranoia and outrage these days, and media pushes that narrative because it evokes an emotional reaction that sells well. So yeah, the information & post-industrial age has brought a better life to a lot of people, but we're apparently more scared, angry, and effectively disconnected than ever in a lot of cases."
