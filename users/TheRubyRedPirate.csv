Wishlist,fct9nxv,t3_eikcg1,1577936621.0,"2019 was definitely a tough year personally and as a family.  By far, the greatest has been how speech therapy helped my son in unexpected ways. He has a speech therapist who comes to the house every week for an hour. Shes been coming for over 6 months now. Hes had little progress in speech, but so many successes in other areas. Hes always been very shy, fearful of strangers, and slow to warm up to new things. In the past 4 months my son has flourished in his personality and social skills. He now plays pretend with his therapist and looks forward to her visits. He will give strangers a smile and occassionally a high 5. We went to 4 different houses over Christmas holiday and he didnt cry, want to be held or hide. He went off and explored. My husband and I even went away by ourselves for the first time since he was born, over 2 years ago. It was huge for everyone since I'm a stay at home mom. He had a blast that weekend with my mom and brother. They went so many places and played with so many things. When we came back, he barely looked at us! He just kept on playing! I know it sounds silly but hes a different kid than he was 6 months ago. Hes always been super independent except in social situations/new places. Now I have to dress him in bright colors in public so I can see him! He smiles at me and takes off.  Hopefully 2020 is the year for his speech successes. We know he can talk because we've heard him. He just chooses not too. This year I strive to understand him better and help him understand us, even if talking isn't in the equation."

We went to my cousins for Christmas.  Hes about 6 years older than me. When we were kids, I was outspoken and sassy, but I always felt nervous around him and didnt like when he visited. He loved to tease my bad moods by tickling me even when I asked him to stop. He now has a 5 year old daughter and 3 year old son and is a stay at home dad. Hes so good with the kids, is an extrovert, made good money before the kids, has a great wife. Nothing has ever happened to make me mention it to anyone, ever. But being around him makes me uneasy. Like I'm waiting on something to happen. I'm slightly worried about his relationship with his daughter but have nothing to base it on, other than my feelings. If it came out he was abusing his daughter, I would be zero percent surprised. But I would probably be the only one that felt that way and I can't explain it."
