enoughpetersonspam,ffap3ne,t1_ff9z0kw,1579741176.0,"im not dumb, and im not a right winger. i just wanted to give voice to something ive seen indigenous people in australia speak about in the face of this crisis as an additional dimension to the damage colonization has caused to the land. 

colonization by europe of many countries has in general fueled climate change and should be something which is discussed when looking at our current environmental state."
enoughpetersonspam,ff9ksxm,t1_ff920jx,1579715102.0,"perhaps “naturally” isn’t quite the word but indigenous people of australia started controlled fires to cultivate the lands and prevent more catastrophic fires quite regularly before the colonization of australia. it’s not a right wing talking point to acknowledge that this is, in part, due to not clearing the lands properly, while also acknowledging that land is drier and more easily catches fire due to climate change."
AmItheAsshole,ff7v18c,t1_ff7jbvt,1579659025.0,"okay, but in a world where upwards of 95% of people your age have been socialized among their peers 8 hours a day for twelve years, homeschooled kids often fall significantly behind their peers in the ability to engage with others their age. talking to adults is not enough, and i’m tired of that excuse being peddled around, as someone who’s social neglect in homeschooling was excused for that same reason."

college,fe61cj3,t1_fe607u6,1578879589.0,"how i study depends on the course tbh and what the professor provides! for gen chem, my professor’s slides were very well organized and informative and a huge resource, so i would mainly study off of them, and rewrite the relevant lecture notes before each exam. that usually took me three days but it helped me to review from the beginning of the chapters what i knew and to make important connections. i tried to explain everything to myself until i could make sense of it and remember it. reviewing every week before our weekly recitation quizzes also helped a lot!

ochem is an entirely different beast. i mainly study the textbook as best i can, practice problems as much as i can, and pray lol. so far it’s worked out for me. 

as for my other classes, i have a good enough short term memory to cram for biology, and i’m okay enough at math to cram for it as well. i should probably be more diligent in my non-chemistry classes!"
college,fe5zy2l,t1_fe5z7q9,1578878688.0,"well the best way to get an A is to get an A in every subcategory on the syllabus. so if i have quizzes, exams, and homework in a class, i try to get an A average in each, making sure there’s no doubt i’ll get an A in the class. 

for the quiz thing, let’s say i have six quizzes in a class, ten question each. that’s 60 questions. in order to get a solid 90, i can miss 1 question from each quiz (9/10), or 6 questions for the entire semester. then i budget those missed questions to the best of my ability to keep myself from getting a string of Bs or Cs on quizzes. (meaning i study to the best of my ability to get a 100 on those quizzes.)

i do the same for exams. i try to do as well as possible on early exams, and once there i’ll try to calculate what i need to make on the last regular exam to have an A average for exams. 

then, when all is said and done for the semester, i usually just have the final left, with high As for most of my assignments and quizzes, and As for exams. i calculate how much i need on the final to get a straight 90 in the class, and aim to make at least 20% higher on the final than that. the whole process makes finals week much less stressful for me, and i usually only have to focus on one big final."

college,fdmy4hq,t3_em60aa,1578570956.0,"gen chem 2 is more difficult than gen chem 1 but i will admit i enjoyed it more! i’m now a tutor for it. my tip is to study every week to the best of your ability and make sure you’re reviewing regularly. my professor had short weekly quizzes, which i’d study about 1-2 hours for, which helped me a ton in retaining information. 

some problems will be hard. when you’re confused on a problem solving technique, watch a video on youtube or khan academy or similar and copy down the problem and their solution, listening to their reasoning, then try to work it out for yourself. once you feel like you understand it, try a new problem of that type and see if you can solve it on your own. do this for every problem type you encounter and be sure to rework every problem your professor presents in class or includes in notes/homework before exams. 

when you are taught ice/rice tables, learn them well. you have to apply the concept a lot and even when you get beyond the acid/base chapter, you have to use them to an extent when talking about solubility. 

more than anything else, be sure to brush up on your math skills. math skills are the number one predictor of success in gen chem classes!"

professors often do this because they are busy and they don’t know what you want emphasized in a letter of recommendation. write something positive but not overly glamorous and emphasize the accomplishments you find important to your application."

unt,fdmx8t7,t3_em0swq,1578569925.0,"apply asap if you haven’t already, you’re sure to get in with those scores. as soon as you are accepted, apply for the general scholarship application. you will automatically be considered for excellence scholarships which may be given to you depending on your gpa, rank, act/sat scores, etc. you cannot get these once you start, only based on high school stats. (there are also individual scholarships you can apply to on that page which have other requirements you’ll have to fill out.)

i’d also suggest applying for the honors college. honors classes aren’t harder and make core classes more fun, you get to live in rawlins if you’re a freshman who wants to live in a nice dorm, and you get to register for classes nearly a month before any other freshman, before seniors even. it’s not hard to get in to out of high school and early registration is so helpful at a school with nearly 40k students."

Earwolf,fdmn3a5,t1_fdlt1ms,1578556317.0,he’s most likely referring to recent years when they lost most of their ad revenue for their website while facebook never paid them a dime and youtube stopped recommending their videos as much. they launched a streaming service of their own but it isn’t profitable yet.

news,fdmm2dx,t1_fdlwuew,1578555117.0,"im guessing part of the problem is that collegehumor’s channel hardly does enough numbers to fund one person via adsense (they usually only get at best up to 500k on their new videos, usually 200k, when just a year and a half ago they regularly hit 1-5 million views on popular videos), let alone a large team of writers and crew as they had. 

the algorithim hasn’t been as kind lately and i doubt they’ll be able to rely on youtube to get back on their feet. 

as for the facebook scandal, from what i understand it was that they moved away from updating their own website with their own ads to social media platforms like facebook, likely due to decreased ad revenue as people stop visiting individual content websites for social media. that’s an inevitable change that would have bit them in the ass one way or another, but facebook lying about viewing figures only made it worse."
