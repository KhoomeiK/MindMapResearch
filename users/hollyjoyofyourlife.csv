dating_advice,fd5vx3r,t3_ek49am,1578182163.0,If kids were 100% part of my future and I were seriously pursuing a relarionship I'd ask early on - no sense in setting  yourself up to really like someone just to learn that you differ on a topic that would be a non-starter. Maybe the third question is VERY early on but not sounds like this person is just checking off their boxes to play it safe.
mentalhealth,fd5twxh,t1_fd5t696,1578181467.0,"Understandable. Maybe at some point he'll reconsider. Honestly, you listening to him, hearing him, and checking in on him is a lot for you to do to help! So you're doing great already. Maybe theres a book or something you could offer him that's relevant (depending on the situation hes dealing with). Is he depressed or just opening up about some of his demons?"

mentalhealth,fd5sj7h,t3_ek4dul,1578181011.0,"Hug him and reassure that he didnt deserve that treatment. Tell him that he can confide in you anytime,  even if you dont know what to say. It probably helps him just having someone on his team. Maybe encourage him to go to therapy or counseling to heal from his childhood (because he deserves to be happy, not because hes fucked up or broken). Good on you for being concerned for him."

Anxiety,fd5hir3,t3_ek3m9w,1578177711.0,"This is the worst! I'm sorry to hear it. Try 10 slow, deep breaths whenever necessary - close your eyes if you need. A walk is a great idea and I notice it helps after just a few minutes. Also, a bath can be relaxing and a good way to unwind from physical anxiety,  especially if your thoughts aren't preventing you from being able to be in the moment."

I totally get you on the anxiety and have it myself. Try a walk in the evening. Even 10 minutes can make a difference! And, who knows what that small change can lead to. Hope you keep counting those days!"

mentalhealth,fd0v87o,t3_ejtjh3,1578124214.0,"Careful what you wish for - my brother died in a car accident unexpectedly in 2018, and even though I'm sure hes at peace I'm definitely not. Nor is my entire family. The ripple affect is real - start with something small. A walk, an apple, a shower when you dont want to. Those small things can lend momentum to other small things. After a while, those small things add up. Hang in there. Your life matters more than you know."
