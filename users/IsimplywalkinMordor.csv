sahm,ffactue,t1_ffa1cr4,1579732529.0,"If he likes his job then he just can't get up  because he's too tired.  He'll have to set a limit on his time to himself at night.  I know how he feels, he works 9 hours then comes home and wants time to himself. I would try at least getting him to come to bed around 1 or 2 and eventually maybe you can work your way to 11 or 12.

As far as doing everything yourself that would be something i would talk over with your counselor.  He could do some things around the house before he goes and plays like laundry or dishes.

And the sex would be something i bring up with the counselor too. He also could be jerking it every night or his libido isn't there. Maybe a date night would help if you could get someone to watch the kids."
sahm,ff9nw32,t3_eqjkjb,1579716924.0,"A lot of posts on here saying he has it made but do you think he may have depression? Does he hate his job? Im not a morning person so i would go into work as late as possible too. Maybe you can compromise and he can go in from 9 to 6 and help with dinner or watch kids for while longer before bed time.

The games and tv late at night make it harder to fall asleep. He's only hurting himself by staying up that late. But again,  baby steps.  Maybe he can try winding it down at 1 or 2 AM instead of 3 or 4. That will help him get to work that one hour earlier."

unpopularopinion,ff4brqo,t1_ff4911u,1579559907.0,"A lot of fathers who knew the kid wasn't theirs but agreed to raise the kid from birth could just leave after 10 years out whatever and not pay child support just to spite the mom. 

You are right though in that being a dick isn't illegal. If that were to pass and dna test was done at birth im sure there would be papers to sign saying you are going to take care of the kid and be the father.

If you don't sign and the kid isn't yours then I suppose you wouldnt get parental rights, the state would go after whoever is the real father for child support, and he would get visitation rights and other responsibilities and you would be like a step dad if you chose to remain in the relationship."
