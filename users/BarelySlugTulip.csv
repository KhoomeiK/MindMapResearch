dogs,ffe4kx5,t3_esvcz7,1579836538.0,Why on earth would a dog of a breed genetically prone to dog-aggression be getting into fights with other dogs?  It’s just baffling.
BanPitBulls,ffdft8x,t3_et0jsv,1579819975.0,"Thank you, could you please go tell this to other pit owners? Not that I agree you can fully train out instincts, but I’m glad you’re aware and I mean that sincerely."

dogs,ff94eos,t1_ff93t7u,1579704578.0,"Oh I’ve done plenty of research and have seen in real life, watched videos and seen pictures, what pits do to other people’s pets. It’s in their genetics to be aggressive towards other animals. Just because you don’t like that fact, doesn’t make it not true."
dogs,ff92ywa,t1_ff818cu,1579703569.0,"You cannot love or train out instincts. 

You can’t say it’s all how they’re raised and then go right on to say little dogs are worse. If that’s your belief, why don’t you train your little dog better. They do *less* damage but you need to be *more* careful with them? That’s just really stupid. 

If it’s only pits from shelters with a bad past that attack (which it’s not) then doesn’t that mean pit rescue should stop being a thing since those rescue pits are the dangerous ones?"
BanPitBulls,ff8zvch,t3_esc3gb,1579701222.0,"“This bill actually allows them to go to a dog park...”

Proof right there they don’t know anything about pits. 

And pit owners aren’t going to make any effort license their goddamn dogs just because they’re no longer banned.  Nothing will happen to a pit, whether licensed or not, if it mauls someone or a pet.  They’re always allowed to do it a few times before they’re even considered dangerous."
BanPitBulls,ff80qkt,t3_es3zi8,1579662977.0,"Just a little scuffle. I’m so sure that those other dogs were just so mean to the poor pittie. 

Punctured a child’s lip but good with children. But, as pit owners always like to remind us about their sweetest most gentle nanny dogs, the dog obviously didn’t mean any harm since it was just a puncture  — if it really meant to hurt the child it would have just killed them.  

People who make excuses for these dogs are the worst."

That tail wag don’t mean shit. My dogs wag their tails when they see a squirrel they want to kill. Pits wag their tails while they’re literally mauling a person or animal to death. Sure, there’s enough people out there who have pits and cats together that hasn’t ended in tragedy, and some pits thankfully don’t live up to their breed’s standards, but it takes a real stupid asshole to even risk it.
