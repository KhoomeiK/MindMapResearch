Professors,ff1xtli,t1_ff1x5zv,1579488640.0,Expected impacts from this study include the promotion of underrepresented groups in higher education. The PI will have direct involvement with women from disadvantaged backgrounds and mentor them with one on one meetings. Involved parties will also receive substantial funding to assist in educational attainment.
Professors,ff1vbd2,t1_ff1qpo6,1579486985.0,"I was thinking more like ""the broader impacts of this study are that it will pay for several young women to attend nursing school"""
Professors,ff1mmyn,t1_ff1kq5m,1579481695.0,I would love to read that Broader Impacts statement
ShitMomGroupsSay,ff1m4at,t3_eqxl4p,1579481443.0,"My ""maternal instincts"" were that basically everything I was doing was killing my baby. The ped was the only person keeping me sane for the first 6 months. Without him I would have definitely drowned in self loathing for all the things I later found out were totally normal."
beyondthebump,ff0wfby,t1_fez4kpy,1579472915.0,"I'll add that going into it as ""I feel when you...."" Rather than ""you have a problem"" is important. If OP goes into this conversation as ""I'm right and you're wrong"" likely nothing good will come of it. I honestly get wanting to get shit faced with an infant. I don't see an issue with partying occasionally. The issue I see is that there was literally no communication about expectations. If we have a party we have clear communication about ""this is my time to let loose"" and we agree on EVERYTHING ahead of time. Without that, fights and resentment are bound to happen. I certainly would not jump to the conclusion that hubby is an alcoholic. And revenge is also a terrible idea."
BabyBumps,fetgpdn,t1_fer9z5g,1579375245.0,"I felt like I was giving birth all over again. I had been popping stool softeners like crazy and it was still incredibly painful. I screamed like a banshee.

Edit: I did have a third degree tear."
Professors,fejx180,t1_fejwql7,1579187801.0,"What do you mean you ""changed things around""? I got comments that said I was the best instructor students had ever had. Same class. Same semester."
Professors,fegbfyo,t1_feetnnv,1579086241.0,This is hilarious! Our old dudes definitely wouldn't go for it but I bet us younger folks would.
Professors,fegbdew,t1_feejbao,1579086145.0,"Hey! Someone called me the worst teacher they've ever had at any level, at any institution, at any time their entire life. I make (my University) look bad.

There was also a student entering the academic integrity process at the end of the semester for stealing my final...... Just a hunch but I bet it's the same person ü§∑"
TwoXChromosomes,feejusz,t3_eoip7f,1579035217.0,"Students comment on my evaluations that I don't dress appropriately. Male colleagues have commented on how I dress. Male colleagues have also felt up my leg under a table at dinner at a conference. While I was a grad student another male student grabbed my chest and told me to come to his room. Yes, this is what your career will be like.

This is why I fill my lab with women and underrepresented groups. People from disadvantaged backgrounds. First gen students. I target those students specifically. So yes. Your career will have some of those assholes. You can choose to focus your energy on the ones who aren't. My major professor and all my committee members for both my MS and PhD were men. They are my biggest supporters. They have given me so many opportunities and are a major part of why I'm so successful today. You get to choose who you surround yourself with and you can work to make the next generation full of fewer assholes. Don't be afraid to tell the others to fuck off (but maybe be nicer about it than that lol)"
unexpectedoffice,fee8lxe,t1_fedb33e,1579028644.0,I was like when did I subscribe to child free? I have a 15 month old so I thought maybe I did it in a dream.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fe6h9jn,t1_fe4doby,1578890852.0,"""I don't need to read this because it was paid for by big pharma and just contains lies"". That's the answer you would actually get. You can't argue with logic because they are delusional."
bipolar,fe3jraf,t3_enn2xv,1578849877.0,Way to go! That's awesome. It's so nice seeing positive reports on here üòä
Professors,fe38fbl,t1_fe2ikjn,1578846910.0,"This year was the first time I taught a room full of kids who had their entire education in the NCLB era. I had none of that. It's totally foreign. They really don't know how to study. They're completely helpless. And I am woefully helpless in how to help them. We had a workshop on what gen z kids expect but there really isn't much in the way of helping us translate to them. I want to help them be expert learners and their system has them totally unprepared to get there. They literally need classes on how to study. It's pathetic (and not at all their fault). It creates a tense classroom and, in my case, some pretty aggressive students. I hate it."
bipolar,fdxjqbm,t1_fdx51mo,1578769437.0,At least you know what it was spent on. I couldn't tell you what any of that money went to üòñ
bipolar,fdx4pqa,t1_fdx4b1o,1578765326.0,"I went through that when I was 18-24 ish. Nobody ever taught me how to use it responsibly. And, unfortunately, shit happens. And when nobody makes enough to just live, you end up with a ton of debt no matter what."
Justnofil,fdwwhrk,t1_fdr4gv3,1578762980.0,"He definitely has a spine and sets hard boundaries (not that FIL always respects them). That doesn't go over well in a family that thrives on drama and codependency. His mom has called him hateful and gone off on him for ""disrespecting"" his dad. We're totally fine living 14 hours away as you can imagine."
bipolar,fdvzxti,t3_en8455,1578753575.0,The second spike was travel for a conference as well as Thanksgiving.
academia,fdpb4gm,t3_emjzrg,1578624227.0,"There is absolutely more to this story. There is no way someone gave you an F for no reason and then ""ruined your life"". TBH, you sound like you haven't taken responsibility for yourself or your education."
psychology,fdnmrqs,t1_fdn8qnf,1578589041.0,"There is plenty of research that shows focusing on work vs natural abilities is the way to encourage children. If you constantly tell a child ""you are so smart!"" It becomes a part of their identity and any failure means ""I am not smart"". If you tell your kids ""you worked so hard!"" Then they tend to grow up being satisfied with their work and not focusing so much on the failure part of things."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fddj6x3,t1_fdcx6o6,1578314409.0,"Oh it does. At one point I told my mom if she sent anything else to Mr and Mrs I would just throw it away. She said ""well what am I supposed to call you then?"" And I said well I'm actually a doctor and you've never sent anything to Dr so and so. So now she hyphenates (which is also not my name) üòê baby steps I guess. But yes, it's a feeling of complete invalidation and invisibility. Like my worth is solely wrapped up in my husband."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdcr8le,t3_ekizg4,1578282059.0,"In my experience it doesn't matter what you do anyway. I kept my last name but here I am, 4 years later, still getting mail addressed to Mr. And Mrs. Blah blah. Not to mention I am a fucking doctor. But does anyone ever mail anything to Dr. Bugnerd? No. Even though that's an actual accomplishment I worked extremely hard for. Anyone can get fucking married."
cats,fda4dby,t1_fda2der,1578241479.0,"Yeah we have one of their litter boxes plus a box with a blanket that our other cat (they are bff's) lays in. We've got signs up everywhere and have posted on Facebook, Nextdoor etc."
Professors,fd6nesb,t1_fd6mfi5,1578193426.0,I am in forestry and natural resources. The vast majority of the kids in my college are white men. I took about 5 minutes one day to explain to them that the resources they will manage disproportionally affect people of color and other marginalized groups. That they need to be aware that they are not a diverse group and they need to understand how their actions affect others. Boy did they not like that. Apparently I'm easily offended and also unprofessional. PS I don't dress professionally either. Kids are dumb sometimes.
Professors,fd3m6sa,t3_ejxbfk,1578159685.0,"This past semester was the worst for me. One student flat out railed against me in their eval. Said I made fun of people with mental illness (I actually apologized because I have untreated ADHD due to being pregnant and breastfeeding and I know that causes me to be disorganized). They said I was constantly 30 minutes late for class (I was 15 minutes late once because there were 3 accidents on the highway). They said I was easily offended, unapproachable....I mean this person straight up hates me. And just about everything they put in the eval was either untrue or greatly embellished. If you look at grade associations, I would bet the people who do this also don't do well in the class. There are a ton of papers that show how ridiculous student evals are. They are pretty much worthless."
Professors,fcukem4,t3_eiw511,1577982982.0,Those are what make the rest worth it. I had the worst semester of my still short career this past fall. I was so down about it. Then I got an email from a student telling me I made class interesting and she was actually excited to come to class. She told me that my class made her happy to be in school and she had the best grades she has ever had - and she credited some of that to me. Queue happy tears. Congrats on your awesome job ü•∞
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc7cz9l,t1_fc5xxqs,1577503804.0,"On the flip side, I'm faculty at a large University and also a mom of a 14 month old. When a freshman comes to me complaining that they're tired after their final I'm like you are not getting any fucking sympathy from me. You're tired because you spent all semester getting fucking wasted (I hear your stories before class) and I'm tired because I'm up all night writing 4 different versions of a final bc you fuckers can't be bothered to not cheat. Bottom line: everyone is fucking tired and everyone needs to just chill with the dick measuring contests about who has it harder."
LadiesofScience,fc32ya8,t3_efxctd,1577380219.0,"I've been really scared that I will have to give up this thing I love because of stress. Like I love teaching. I love research. I love service even. I love mentoring kids. I love my University. I love my department. But sometimes I feel like it's just too much. I'm doing everything I've ever wanted in life. And I truly love it. And at the same time I'm worried that one day I'll have to say sorry, I can't do this anymore. I also have a 14 month old and that is definitely part of it. I don't know if maybe I'm still in that transition phase and learning how to balance things or if maybe this is just how it is. No advice really. I'm just here with you üíì"
Professors,fby2v07,t3_eewjaf,1577206752.0,I just don't respond. I had a student email and ask if they could do anything to raise their 88 to an A. I had already submitted final grades. It's Christmas. Eff off.
UpstateSC,fbjwv3t,t3_edqz0o,1576941315.0,"Our cat has been missing since Tuesday morning. We live just off Issaqueena near Ingles and think someone picked him up. We've posted at all the right places and put up signs etc. He is microchipped. He answers to the same Thursday or Orangie. He is incredibly sweet and loves sitting on shoulders. We are heart broken. We are offering a reward for his safe return! No questions asked! Our one year old son picked him out at a Cat Caf√© and he is our other cat's best friend. Please, if you know anything, PM me. We are desperate."
