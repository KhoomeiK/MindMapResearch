ibs,ffe4gz1,t3_et2rjg,1579836456.0,Yep. I usually eat some rice or plain pasta until my stomach feels less pissed
lululemon,ffe1uc4,t3_et3xxj,1579834508.0,I stay true to size for my aligns. They tend to go sheer for me if I size down and I haven’t had any issues with stretching out
ibs,ff97vi6,t3_esbka1,1579706884.0,Gluten? Dairy? I cut out dairy and felt a lot better. I’m currently starting to cut out gluten and I think it’s helping
AppleWatch,ff59fh5,t3_erp9pt,1579584227.0,The breathe app is so underrated. I also have calm on the watch and use it a lot. The activity app helps me make sure I’ve gotten enough exercise (which reduces my anxiety a ton)
emetophobia,ff52p5w,t1_ff52n8p,1579578598.0,Then you should hopefully be fine soon :). You can always take some extra miralax because it’s been a couple days just to really try to move things along
emetophobia,ff52jk8,t1_ff52ar4,1579578480.0,Have you tried miralax or Metamucil? they’re super gentle laxatives that will help you within 24 hours. Also burping doesn’t mean you’re going to be sick at all. I have reflux so I burp all the time but all it does is make you feel better
emetophobia,ff527lc,t3_erovyl,1579578227.0,have you tried a hot beverage and walking around? Helps me so much with constipation. Just know that you won’t v* from simple constipation and it will pass
IBD,ff4og4a,t3_eobmpo,1579568578.0,Going for a walk helps me release some
fuckeatingdisorders,ff48w4p,t3_er7i9g,1579558094.0,I think it’s just what your body does when you eat more than is typical. Try a different OTC antacid like Pepcid. Your body will figure it out soon.
vegan,ff1t51o,t3_eo2xxa,1579485598.0,I really have never understood this. I like meat but I hate the ethical consequences of it therefore I don’t eat it. I will admit that it tastes good tho
science,fetybbw,t3_eqgtxg,1579381256.0,My normal seems to be around 97.1 and I’ve dipped to 96.5 normally. If I hit 99 I actually have a pretty bad fever even tho that’s not much of a fever at all with the old standards
lululemon,fetvptx,t1_fetvi62,1579380557.0,you could also try some very seamless Lazer cut underwear but those tend to shift
lululemon,fetv31g,t3_eqlqzm,1579380335.0,I’ve only managed to be panty line free in luxtreme with lace thongs. The fabric tends to show texture a lot
EDAnonymous,festyks,t3_eqhtvo,1579368942.0,"the gym is so beneficial for mental health but it’s a slippery slope if you’ve had an ED. You have to figure out how to work out for the mental health benefits without fixating, which is super hard but can be done"
EDanonymemes,fesss4l,t3_eqgdeh,1579368648.0,life hack! They can weigh you while you’re standing facing away from the numbers. They just write the number and won’t tell you
ibs,fernvph,t1_feqgy7j,1579356279.0,You can buy dairy free yogurt with probiotics if that’s better for you!
ibs,fepohh7,t3_eqc8bj,1579326094.0,coffee ice cream can be very low in coffee if you can tolerate milk. It’s a good way to get the flavor with minimal pain
fatlogic,feo8mcr,t3_epwfvv,1579296628.0,I have a major gluten sensitivity and I gained weight when I went GF cuz I was so malnourished before. I don’t get their logic
Celiac,felu6ni,t1_feiw54n,1579231028.0,I think a lot of store brand versions of Imodium are gluten free
ibs,feljxa8,t1_felj4jx,1579223964.0,theoretically yesterday but they’ve given up at this point and just want me to do it eventually
ibs,felihxb,t1_fekqfyr,1579222976.0,this is a rough test. Dunno why my body refuses to agree
ibs,fekq5ht,t1_fekl3vd,1579205306.0,still haven’t managed. fmlllll
AskReddit,fehruz8,t3_eit3ug,1579122634.0,from what I heard it gets easier every time. A friend got over her fear completely by the end. You kinda just have to do it
emetophobia,fegtv2p,t1_fefw5sx,1579102410.0,yea I have some suspected ibs (still getting tested for Celiac and the like) and it’s more the n* that comes with it that freaks me out
emetophobia,fefa2d1,t3_eofslo,1579051727.0,Sometimes bodies do weird shit like that (no pun intended). take a pepto or Imodium if you want to calm it down but otherwise I wouldn’t worry.
lululemon,feetoyx,t3_eor1vz,1579040990.0,"if they have a triangle inseam on the back they’re aligns. If it’s one straight seam, they’re wunder unders in luon. If they have many seams throughout the pants they’re probably in movements."
emetophobia,feccpo4,t3_envn7w,1578970856.0,He might not have noro at all. Little kids v* from basically anything that elevates their temp at all. I wouldn’t panic
ptsd,fecagj4,t3_ef576m,1578969573.0,This is late but I make crazy plans for anniversaries. I try to replace the awful memory with a super good memory. It’s super hard but helps a ton

loseit,fe63tlk,t3_enwppo,1578881165.0,Cold turkey for a week and the cravings disappear. It’s so hard but once you do it you’ll see a difference. Have healthy snacks and drinks ready and easy to grab so you aren’t tempted (like unsweetened tea or whole grain crackers and cheese). You got this!
loseit,fe61w6j,t3_ennq98,1578879927.0,"You have to figure out what motivates you! I was blessed with good luck and a fast metabolism but I was “skinny fat” for years. I got an Apple Watch and made it my goal to close all three activity rings every day. I watched the fat melt off (and I only had about 10 to lose, it will be even faster for you). That thing has motivated me so much. I also buy a ton of frozen fruit because no matter how lazy I am I can always reach for some fruit for a snack."
stupidpol,fe4uv1k,t3_ehcpuo,1578863022.0,"that’s insane to me but I realized that I live in one of the thinner states (California) in an area with very good access to cheap produce. We’re lucky here that it’s somewhat easy to be healthy, especially considering that the weather is usually nice enough for people to get outside and move"
noburp,fe3vs85,t3_ekjgm5,1578853310.0,A couple after every meal. Probably 5-10 a day
noburp,fe3vhgq,t3_emwb4o,1578853212.0,This does sound a bit like an ulcer. It might be work getting checked out just in case
emetophobia,fe3s7y8,t3_emwme0,1578852367.0,Make sure you don’t eat or drink if it’s a fasting blood test!! A lot of people are saying to eat or drink juice but that will mess up your results if it’s supposed to be fasted and you will have to do it again. I did mine at 7am when the lab opened and ate right after and was completely fine
emetophobia,fe3rxsm,t3_emtgdo,1578852274.0,"I did mine under local. It took no time at all and I didn’t feel sick at all. They didn’t give me any painkillers either, so I just took advil and Tylenol. I felt just fine"
emetophobia,fe3rikg,t3_en6gw0,1578852129.0,"This happened to me for awhile. I try to get as much exercise as possible during the day (so I’m super tired and sleep well). I also take a Benadryl if I wake up feeling hot and n* because it’s an anti-emetic and a sedative, so it puts you right back to sleep. This truck helped me break the cycle and I don’t wake up anymore. 
Also, keep your room at about 62 degrees. People are built to sleep at colder temps. I got a weighted blanket and I love it."
AntiVegan,fe2wndp,t1_fdpa3i1,1578843684.0,Most vegans I’ve seen don’t care a ton about cross contamination because they didn’t contribute to the suffering of the animals cooked before their vegan food
AskDocs,fe030nm,t1_fe026w1,1578801805.0,I don’t personally but I think you could probably find someone to help you with some internet sleuthing. Diabetics cross country borders for insulin all the time and one of them might be able to help you
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdzzdp3,t3_end2yk,1578799426.0,I have bad anxiety and spend a lot of nights sleeping on the couch for a change of scene. Top tier sleep
AskDocs,fdzz23c,t3_endt9u,1578799236.0,Can you try to fly her to Canada or somewhere with universal healthcare? Believe it or not it might be much much cheaper if you can get that much cash together. Get a one way ticket and figure out getting home later. This is life or death
shittingadvice,fdwh6g0,t3_em6ddc,1578758644.0,If that bugs you you could try taking beano. It helped me a lot
LaBrantFamSnark,fdpg13v,t1_fdc637u,1578627667.0,They’re both Mormons so I think they’re trying to follow the very “traditional” method where the guy works and doesn’t help at home and the mother does all the work with the kids

AskDocs,fdm8xi5,t1_fdm8rr5,1578542743.0,the new medical advice on concussions is to sleep as much as possible (it used to be waking yourself up every couple hours). Let yourself get all the rest you need!
AskDocs,fdm8aqw,t3_em3ifh,1578542279.0,"NAD but I’ve had 3 concussions. I felt fine for the first 12ish hours but then felt super tired, kinda nauseous, and had some sensitivity to light. Look up symptoms of concussions and monitor yourself for a few days. It’s not an emergency at this point so you can make an appointment with a doctor if you have any symptoms. The biggest danger signs are pupils being different sizes, vomiting, and blacking out."
AskDocs,fdg0oaf,t3_el6q25,1578375773.0,I had pneumonia last year as a healthy teen and I would say it took me about 2 months to feel like I could breathe as well as I could before I got sick. Running was hard for awhile. It’s been 9 months now and I feel just fine.
AskDocs,fdfzeu2,t1_fdfyxmv,1578374607.0,Both were sore but the right was so much worse.  I’ve learned my lesson about arms after a long break
AskDocs,fdfyyzq,t3_el3vde,1578374210.0,"Have you tried asking about deep sedation? You would still have full control over your airway but you wouldn’t remember the procedure and would be asleep for it. It’s usually better tolerated than general as well.

ADHD,fdfyspo,t3_el5qqg,1578374051.0,yea I had all of these with adderall. It took a few weeks for my body to get used to it. You might need a lower dose tho
AskDocs,fdfyf6n,t3_el4eqt,1578373724.0,NAD but I’ve also never experienced a dream. I also sleepwalk (unclear if that’s connected)
study,fdfycec,t1_fdfw8tj,1578373658.0,you should probably go to a doctor about that. Anything limiting your ability to exercise is a problem because exercise makes a huge difference in mental health
AskDocs,fdfy9d4,t1_fdfx00r,1578373584.0,the doctor said it was not problem for me not to take them. With routine wisdom teeth surgery I’ve heard it’s about 50/50 with having them or not
AskDocs,fdfy3aq,t3_el4rc0,1578373438.0,"NAD but I just did the exact same thing to myself. Take it easy, use heat, and foam roll and stretch it. I found it helped to take walks to get my arms moving gently. Take a break from the arm weights for a bit and try lighter weight/less reps next time"
Anxiety,fdfw3t2,t3_el4eiy,1578371788.0,Yup! I tend to wake up with them in the middle of the night (which sucks) but I can usually cook off
AskDocs,fdfw1ov,t3_el5at8,1578371742.0,NAD but you’re underweight. Not weird to see your ribs but you may need to try to gain some weight
ibs,fdfuait,t3_el5vx4,1578370396.0,"I’ve heard that if you sleep on your left side gravity can help move the stool along, which might help with that feeling."
AskDocs,fdftp8y,t3_el4r9e,1578369959.0,"Basically they should never be taken unless you have a bacterial infection. I’ve taken them for ear infections, pneumonia, and UTI’s but have refused them for a routine wisdom teeth surgery with no infection. No need to take antibiotics for a nonexistent problem. NAD"
AskDocs,fdftjo9,t3_el51sl,1578369845.0,if they hurt you should go to a doctor. They can do things to treat them. NAD
ADHD,fdftbse,t3_ekynmb,1578369684.0,Current AP student. I would be fucked without medication lol
study,fdft6sm,t3_el5san,1578369589.0,"I workout. A lot. The exercise gives me the happy hormones to get through a study session. I also take antidepressants, which sound like they could be helpful for you"
emetophobia,fdfmoik,t1_fdfme1w,1578365245.0,Same. I like using it on nights before plane flights or first days just to ensure that I get a good night of sleep.
ADHD,fdfmg69,t3_ekxp1y,1578365093.0,I set an absolute fuckton of timers. I decide that I’m gonna deal with one issue for 5 minutes. Then I take a long break. I also motivate myself with food and get a ton of exercise so I’m too tired to be distracted.
funny,fdfjry1,t3_ekw6d2,1578363348.0,I turn my blinker on so unconsciously that I can’t not use it. It’s so easy to do I really don’t understand people who don’t
mentalhealth,fdea4me,t3_ech8j4,1578334534.0,If you can afford to try to spend a night or two in a hotel. This could help you see if it’s anxiety or something related to the house.
emetophobia,fde0419,t3_ek554i,1578328140.0,What I do is tip my head up and shake it a bit. Not sure why but it makes it so much easier (probably because the pill is then suspended in the water)
emetophobia,fddzpmr,t3_ekrdvm,1578327870.0,"Are you still in your bed? If so, you need to move. I find that it’s easy to stew in my worry when I lie awake in my bed at night so I move to the couch. This helps me cool off and reset and usually helps me fall back asleep"
emetophobia,fddze3f,t3_ekw86w,1578327658.0,Ginger tea and pepto saved me. The nausea was only really bad for about 2 days and then seemed to reduce from there and I never felt like I was gonna V*. You’ll be fine!
brokeabone,fddz6ae,t1_fddyg4v,1578327509.0,Yikes. I’m surprised considering the displacement
brokeabone,fddxx7c,t1_fddw67d,1578326659.0,Did you get pins or a plate put in?
brokeabone,fddw0u2,t1_fddvyrm,1578325358.0,I’m pretty impressed. Mine was a different type of break so probably a pretty different experience
brokeabone,fddvktb,t1_fddh5g0,1578325049.0,the worst is like day 4-5. The sleep deprivation really started to hit there because I’m a side sleeper and had to sleep on my back
brokeabone,fdcou1o,t3_e8d12t,1578280281.0,I broke 2 wrists and they hurt less than a sprain. I broke my collarbone and wanted to die
brokeabone,fdco96a,t3_ekka0h,1578279854.0,That is a pain I never want to live through again. They didn’t even give me any painkillers so I had to suffer with just advil
emetophobia,fdc820m,t3_ejc4bb,1578268921.0,I take Zoloft and it’s wonderful. I still get depressed and anxious but I’m much better at pulling myself out of anxious moments than I used to be. I had side effects for about a week but they were easily managed with pepto and tea and melatonin for sleep
emetophobia,fdc6nsk,t3_ejtt6o,1578268151.0,If this happens again my secret weapon is Benadryl. It’s both a sedative and an anti-emetic and it will help you sleep well (just make sure you don’t drive within 6 hours of taking it). As long as you don’t use it too often you don’t become dependent
emetophobia,fdc6g0t,t3_ek3f4h,1578268026.0,I did mine awake (so no nausea from anesthesia) and the only pain meds I took were Advil and Tylenol. No issues at all. Advil was plenty (tho I have a somewhat high pain tolerance)
emetophobia,fdc6bkb,t3_ek4y5o,1578267958.0,Def do a sinus rinse. It should help reduce the amount of mucus. If you look online there are ways to loosen mucus so you can just cough it up and spit it out which helped me a lot. I found that hot tea and steamy showers helped me clear a lot of mucus
IdiotsInCars,fdar2rv,t3_ej7s88,1578249143.0,A drunk motorcyclist plowed into my friends front yard 2 feet from where he was sitting. Not sure what he was thinking or if he was thinking at all

AppleWatchFitness,fcydlsf,t1_fcy5xd7,1578078445.0,"Yea any move goal over 800 is basically impossible for me. I only get 1,000 on days when I have soccer plus an extra workout plus a lot of walking"
AskDocs,fcxvlmr,t3_ejg3e5,1578071157.0,"NAD. That dose seems super high, I started on 25mg. That side effects should have been gone by now so you should probably reduce your dose."
AppleWatchFitness,fcxtqyz,t1_fcxqpuu,1578070300.0,Body size is def huge. I’m 5’ 6” and 130 pounds and will only get about 2/3 of the calories of my 5’ 11” 170 pound friend for the same hike
AppleWatchFitness,fcxt39p,t1_fcx8k12,1578070041.0,"the bigger issue is that I commute by bike and can’t wear the watch for soccer, which means a lot less miles"
AppleWatchFitness,fcwli93,t1_fcwkx17,1578028974.0,the rings are easy for me but my primary workout is weights and soccer (which I can’t wear the watch for). I accidentally walked more than usual over the past months due to injury and surgery and my watch has decided im a walking master
AskDocs,fcwlb94,t3_ej64fb,1578028808.0,"NAD. Mine used to be 12-14 days (which sucked). My doctor said it was normal but I started taking birth control constantly to eliminate them because of the discomfort. I think the potential side effects (anemia, cramping, nausea) are usually more worrying than the length itself but you should probably touch base with your pcp just to make sure."
fatlogic,fcw0mcw,t1_fcvltx3,1578014397.0,agreed. I just eat my dinner by 6pm and don’t eat until 8am. Not the biggest fast but I feel my best when I do this
HydroHomies,fcvzs10,t1_fcvme8o,1578013836.0,Herbal tea is like fancy leaf water. It’s acceptable
lululemon,fcvzgnw,t3_ej6jkk,1578013630.0,They seem to loosen over time. I originally bought an 8 (when I’m usually a 6) and had to bring them back because they stretched to become unwearable. The 6 was snug at first but now fits like the luon ones
xxfitness,fcrwcrq,t3_eiiov3,1577907524.0,What I did was convinced a friend to go with me. I got more comfortable with the gym while being distracted by having company and eventually was comfortable enough to go on my own.
fitbit,fcpajjk,t1_fcp87bz,1577856222.0,What I will say is that my Fitbit broke in just about a year. My Apple Watch still looks and feels brand new
AskDocs,fcoyfsx,t1_fcoyc7k,1577845055.0,please just go to a doctor. They can keep you safe while you figure all this out
AskDocs,fcoxuaw,t1_fcoxmnt,1577844569.0,then this is an ER visit no matter what. If you stop taking it you’re putting yourself in danger but if you keep taking it you’re causing more issues for yourself

AppleWatchFitness,fcow4rs,t3_ei6giu,1577843199.0,I was wishing for that so much this week. Got the wisdom teeth out and was unable to work out for a few days. The watch was not pleased with me
fitbit,fcou5qn,t3_ehhbo8,1577841642.0,You can get the series 3 for 200 dollars from Apple and I would say it’s much better. My Apple Watch is so much more accurate for steps and calories than my Fitbit ever was and it’s also been a lot sturdier so far.
fatlogic,fconniu,t1_fconbpe,1577836773.0,People don’t seem to know how weight really looks. It’s always surprising to me how someone who’s 200 pounds can look much lighter or heavier based on body fat and fat distribution
AskDocs,fcon30m,t1_fcolabm,1577836365.0,Exposure whoops
AskDocs,fcokuef,t1_fcok8dl,1577834769.0,I basically got forced to eat and the exposer helped me recover. It was hard
