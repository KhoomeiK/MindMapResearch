After everything John goes through, he rescues his family, he gets the happy ending, the government still comes to kill him. John fights his way through, but no matter what he'll always die. So even though he went through a ton of shit to get his happy ending, he still dies. I think it's one of the best video games ending, even though in the end you still ""lose"", because John accomplished something, he protected his family.

You need to have them still win something in the end, even if it's not what they'd been chasing."
