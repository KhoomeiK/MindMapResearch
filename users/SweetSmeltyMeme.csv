unpopularopinion,fdz11zf,t1_fdyuud1,1578785602.0,"There's alot more to game than just being ""fun"". People enjoy games that have charming characters, great story, some sort of challenge, which this game really didn't have a whole lot of. In all honesty, the only ""fun"" part about this game was the wild area, because there was so much to explore."
unpopularopinion,fdxp143,t3_emvk03,1578771377.0,"If you had actually seen the complaints people had about these games, you would see that's it's so much more than Dexit. The story was really dull, incredibly predictable, you could tell who the main antagonist was almost right away, it was way to easy, so sense of challenge at all, post game story was short but alright, Animation in battles left much to be desired, and alot of character's weren't that interesting. Don't get me wrong, swsh still had some charming things, such as the wild area, the graphics, and pretty much all the new pokemon (At least to me that is). Overall, it leaves so much to be desired. I'm really sick of people saying ""there's no real reason to hate on this game"", because that statement is just a load of bullshit."

unpopularopinion,fdeux93,t3_eknmjs,1578347120.0,"I agree. This is the case for me where my friend decided to create a group text and added me into it, even though he never even asked if I wanted to be added into it before hand. And it pisses me off, because I don't bring my charger wherever I go, and then my phones battery goes down extremely quickly throughout the day because of all the notifications I'm getting from that group. I have an incredibly own phone (please don't ask) so it's not even possible for me to mute the chat."
unpopularopinion,fdeteui,t1_fdesqdx,1578346221.0,"I know I'm probably gonna be called fragile or sensitive or whatever, but that's just what I think. And in all honesty, I don't see how being sick of the constant circlejerk towards the country I live in makes me ""fragile""."
unpopularopinion,fdesqdx,t3_ekzpuw,1578345821.0,"Agreed. As an American, I agree that our country isn't perfect, but still, the whole circlejerk is so annoying and overused. I can't go onto a single subreddit anymore without seeing so many posts shitting on Americans. And what's sad is that it seems (as least from what I've seen) that a lot of non-Americans just think we're all nothing but a bunch of beer guzzling, diabetic, McDonalds, gun loving idiots (news flash, not everyone here is). Like I said before, our country isn't perfect, but this circlejerk is just out of hand."

pokemon,fd2h2zs,t3_e0jv1n,1578147118.0,"What pisses me off even more is even after you go through all that hell and finally beat the raid Pokemon, it's not even a guaranteed catch, and a lot of times a g-max raid Pokemon will break out of the ball after not even one shake. It's like, at least make the regular raid Pokemon guaranteed catches, and make it so that the g-max Pokemon are can actually be CAUGHT.  Raid battles are really just a load of bullshit."
