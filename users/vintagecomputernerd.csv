aspergers,ffbigke,t3_eso4lx,1579766809.0,">I am very observant of other people and recognize social cues like when someone makes eye contact, but I never know what it means, what the person is thinking, or what a good next move would be to become friends (and no this is not my only social issue but it is the biggest one). My counselor assured me most people were bad at reading others and this was normal (I'm sure it is to some extent). She then said sort of hesitantly (as if she couldn't think of a better way to say it), and I quote, that ""Autistic people, even high-functioning, aren't aware of what's going on,"" and basically argued that I can't have Asperger's because I do know what's going on. It sounds offensive, but I think she meant to say that if I did have Asperger's I wouldn't even notice any social cues to begin with. Is this true for all Aspies, especially those that have learned to mask their symptoms?

Your counselor is full of sh&t, and very condescending. We might not **intuitively** be able to know what's going on (at least sometimes). But I, for example, feel like a sociologist studying and learning the behaviour of the strange creatures on this planet. 
And yes, sometimes I get that people want to say something to me with subtext or nonverbal cues, but not *what* exactly. I used to get mad at my parents when I knew that they wanted to convey something, but refused to tell me when directly asked."
