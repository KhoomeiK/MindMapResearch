I refused to watch it because I saw the clip of the interview with Mayor Pete on Twitter. Binyamin Appelbaum is an asshole. He asked an obviously unfair question that suggested Peter was in cahoots with a McKinsey client accused of price-fixing when the timeline was wrong and the idea that a junior employee would be involved was ridiculous.

Mayor Peter rightly called the question ""Bullshit.""

What's worse is that Appelbaum clearly didn't understand how badly he came off. It was he who posted the clip on Twitter. God, the ratio!

I agree that the Editorial Board did itself a great disservice in creating a reality show out of its endorsement process and then it didn't even do the job. I've disagreed with a number of editorials in the past year, especially ones about the schools and how to fix poor performance by Black and Latinx students.

I don't think the choice was made solely based on gender. But a dual endorsement is meaningless. And why did they have to come out with their endorsement now if they so obviously couldn't decide?"

AskNYC,ff3a3xx,t3_er3fvi,1579537201.0,"I'm a black woman who lives on the UWS. I can't say I regularly experience what you describe on the street on the UWS. But I have had incidents in other spaces. A white woman who had recently moved into my building was on the elevator with me and she asked me how long I'd worked there. I told her I'd lived there for 30 years. Several months later, I happened to sit next to her on the subway. She recognized me, we exchanged pleasantries and I reminded her of what she said. She denied it -- at least she was embarrassed. I told her she said it. Eventually, the conversation moved to more congenial topics.

A couple of months ago, I attended a play reading by a group that two of my relatives belong to. The usual library location wasn't available so it was held in the auditorium of a nearby nursing home. The audience was filled with older people who came to the reading and some nursing home residents, many of whom were out of it. 

I was sitting in my coat. I had come late. I always dread these annual readings because the group picks terrible plays.

A nursing home resident starts to act up.

A white nursing home supervisor rushes over to me to ask me to take the patient to his room. Just as she reached me she realized her mistake. She apologized but I told her it was racist to assume that a black woman sitting in the audience must be a member of the staff. I had thought about letting it go, but I'm tired of white people pulling this shit. Time for *them* to be uncomfortable. Whenever it's safe for me to say something, I intend to.

I wasn't dressed up as it was a Saturday, but I have had plenty of incidents in offices when despite being dressed up in a suit, having a briefcase, and using the language of my profession it was still assumed that I was a secretary."

&#x200B;

My horror stories about New  York Sports Club. I've belonged to more than one branch:

&#x200B;

* I got a call at my office after a lunchtime workout. It was another member who accused me of taking her grooming products. Not only had I not taken her cheap shit, what was the front desk doing giving my number to a complete stranger? I complained.
* I froze my membership for the summer but was not supposed to be charged an administrative fee. I was charged anyway and no number of calls and emails changed the situation.
* There was a hideous, fat and not fit woman trainer who kept trying to pressure me into taking sessions with her despite my clear lack of interest.
* After Super Storm Sandy, I called and called to see if the gym was open as it was not in an area that was hit badly by the storm. The phone kept ringing and they didn't even put on a message. When I finally walked down there, it was closed.
* The equipment is squeezed in so tight I've banged my limbs against the walls.

Never again."
