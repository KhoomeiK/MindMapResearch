AskReddit,ffcg473,t1_ffcbp4y,1579798721.0,"Manual's are a dying breed globally. Electric cars will never be manual and everything is shifting that way. There's maybe another decade left of companies producing new manual transmissions. After that pretty much everything will be automatic regardless of what country you're in.

Although to be honest it's already been decades since automatics where better to own. They do a better job of shifting than 99% of manual drivers which means better gas efficiency. Of course everyone always believes they are that rare 1% of manual drivers.

It's a good skill to learn, just in case you need it but I wouldn't ever buy a manual for any normal car again. Maybe if I was buying a race car I'd go manual just for the fun of it but that's pretty much the only scenario I'd consider it."

It's also pretty rare that they even check if you did pass in the first place.

The only way to win with the route they picked was to succeed from Canada and they weren't trying to do that.

They could have fought for better regulations or any number of other things but they chose a losing fight purely for political reasons. They knew they'd get ruled against in court and they'd cost the country billions all so they could claim they fought against it."

There's also lots of people who live out of their car. You keep gym clothes, rackets, soccer balls, tennis, etc... You leave work and you go do your after work activity. There's lots of people who drive around with trunk fulls of items at all times.

You're also forgetting, if you've got a SDC you've now got free time while driving. You're going to see people setup powerful gaming pc's with giant tv's. Video game consoles, mini libraries, beds, offices, etc... There's lots of reasons for car ownership with SDC's. In fact SDC's create a whole new market for cars. Car pooling is great and certainly going to be a thing but it's only one thing SDC's can offer and I don't even think it's going to be the biggest."

That still lets you get into your car, tell it where to go and take a nap. Level 5 only matters for places with extreme weather, like a foot of snow over night or off roading. Level 4 is limited to known routes (roads) and won't be able to just make up its own.

He's honestly just being realistic. If Level 5 really comes out it very likely will be long after he's dead. That doesn't mean we won't get self driving cars though, we just won't have a perfect one."

In general cheap HDMI cables under 25 feet don't have to be chipped and can work quite work well but $10 is a really cheap price for such a cable."

They essentially just declared themselves the standard and they likely would have held that title if they hadn't stopped developing IE for years.

Chrome is getting close to being in the same position. I wouldn't expect to see them try and pull a true split any time soon but I wouldn't be surprised if it happens in the next 10 years and history repeats itself. The only nice thing now is at least Chromium is open source. If Google pulls this move they'll be a handful of competitors very quickly, unlike in MS time where it took almost a decade."

So after all that bitching and moaning they're still a positive.

He then justifies his position by saying they're only in a positive because they own land. His solution is to just steal all their land which would mean they aren't bringing in money. Now the Royals are a negative because we just stole all their shit. 

He doesn't have a single good point in the whole video, it just comes off as the ranting of a lunatic who makes it clear he doesn't like the Royals.

Of course most people don't care because they actually want a good portion of those Google apps.

Either way your wrong about most bloatware coming from Google. The majority of crap apps installed on phones come from the manufacturers, even if you consider all Google apps bloatware. If you do I really question what you're doing with a stock Android phone. Install something like LineageOS."

Edmonton,fe9amlp,t1_fe5a9h8,1578935902.0,According to people working at Telus I've heard that internally Telus thinks it's 70% finished it's Edmonton Fibre rollout. That number seems wrong to me though as I know a lot of areas don't have access to Telus fibre yet. However it's hard to say for sure as Telus won't release the information publicly for years. I'm pretty sure they realized their projected Jan 2020 completion date was wrong way back in 2017. That's when they pulled all their publicly available information about the rollout.

TwoXChromosomes,fe6i735,t1_fe6czwq,1578891684.0,"I think this ones trickier. The truth is stockholm syndrome is a thing and people have been equating parent hood to stockholms for a long time. It would be very hard to raise a kid and not develop strong feelings for it. Even if you were forced at gunpoint to raise a child you'd ultimately end up caring for it. It's not the child forcing this on you and you know it.

This makes birth regret very hard. Being forced to have a child will drastically change most peoples lives but very few people would be willing to claim they regret their child. Regardless of the circumstance of birth, I don't think they'd be lying. Once you've done it you really have no choice but to embrace it, good or bad."
mildlyinteresting,fe6d3et,t1_fe622h7,1578887402.0,"I think you'll find most people simply prefer the system they grew up using. I'm in Canada and we still have plenty of 60+ year olds who will use Imperial and say the temperature in Fahrenheit. Many have converted but not all. To get all citizens using one system takes a good 80 years because you need everyone to die off. Most of the ones who convert, converted because they had to make use of the new systems for work so they really became familiar with it.

I've actually been very surprised how bad Americans are with Metric and Celsius. When I travel to the states I just use Imperial and Fahrenheit as I'm not wasting vacation time dealing with it. When I do slip up and use the other systems I always get blank stares and have to convert it. Same thing in Canada, always had to convert for American tourists, tell them a distance in KM and you get blank stares and then asked how far that is in miles."

I can understand you're use to Fahrenheit but it's not easier to understand. It's simply what you're used to and grew up with. If most of the world/scientific community or really anything in existence used Fahrenheit still it might make sense. Unfortunate since it's largely just the US still using Fahrenheit it's not very useful these days. It's made doubly worse by the fact that even the US recognizes it's not a good temperature system to work with so it uses Celsius when actually doing anything important forcing people to learn two systems instead of just one.

Edit: I'm getting some weird private messages so let me be clear. I think both systems are simple to understand. I'm simply saying I prefer Celsius because it's what the world has standardized on with the US being the only significant outlier."
nottheonion,fe3frxm,t1_fe2c6vr,1578848866.0,That's hopefully not true. Most places try to convert their Olympic villages into something. You can sell partially furnished apartments or worst case sell the beds to a hotel chain. Beds that have been used for a few weeks shouldn't be hard to unload. No reason to be trashing them and if they are I'd pick on them for having such a wasteful plan. I certainly wouldn't congratulate them for it.

AskReddit,fdz78zz,t1_fdyup3q,1578787371.0,I can find a torx screw at a HW store but not in most types and sizes. If I need a smaller metal torx they've likely got it. If I need something like deck screws they most likely only carry it in Robertson and maybe Philips.
AskReddit,fdypx8l,t1_fdx9hmr,1578782394.0,"Canada is pretty big on Robertson's and you'll find the most variety for Robertson's. Philips heads are common too as that's what America uses so it's pretty easy to find those in basically any size/type, flatheads as well but everyone hates those and I'm convinced they just bought stock on those a few decades ago and have never managed to unload them. You can usually tell if something is Canadian made or American made based on if it's built with Philips or Robertsons.

Torx screws seem to be almost exclusively used for metal screws. I've seen a handful of Torx woood screws but it's extremely uncommon. Pretty much only ever see them on electronics, many people consider them a security screw meant to keep people out. A basic screw driver set usually won't even have Torx drivers in it."

Unfortunately it's rare to see torx heads on most things especially any type of wood screw. HW stores don't really carry them so I'm sticking with Robertson for now.
gadgets,fds6bti,t1_fds4owg,1578695342.0,A lot of manufacturers still produce roll windows and manual locks. They mainly do this because if they don't they can't list power locks and windows as an upgrade. However you'll never run across these cars by accident as sometimes they will only make 1 and then it will go to whoever special ordered it. Most dealerships will never see these types of cars unless they are trying to bring them in special.

It's why shipping times are listed with ranges like 2-7 days. If you don't pay for fast shipping it can just sit there until there is an aircraft with room for it. There's almost always a backlog of items to be shipped should there be room.

Telling someone how they MUST use something they created is very much something I wouldn't support in the least.

Multiple streaming services is annoying but it's still TV. You don't need to have access to everyone at once. Laws that require you do go against pretty much everything I believe in.

At this point I feel like I'm just talking in circles so I'll leave it here. I've done my best to try and explain the issues but you seem very firm in your belief that this is all easily solvable using completely impractical solutions and I can see I won't be able to change your mind."
technology,fdmm63b,t1_fdmduuh,1578555236.0,"The browser picking the file format means it has to relay that information back to the server. It can't just magically transform the information the server sends into the format it wants. No matter what you do the server will always know the file format because it has to send it.

As for it being the least important issue, that was actually a fact. Screen size has the lowest point of entropy of all known tracking methods currently. It is quantifiable the least reliable way to track someone online.

It being an issue on a fraction of sites, you're dead wrong here too. It effects almost all sites. Any site with content that loads dynamically which is now all major sites. Google maps is the easy to understand example but even the site showing the specs for the latest pixel phone would be effected by your change. 

You've managed to list no possible solutions that are even remotely viable. You're asking companies to take on massive costs to solve the easiest of tracking solutions. I don't think you grasp how complicated this issue is. You could throw a billion dollars at this problem and have the best intentioned programmers working on it without solving it. 

Solving this is unlikely to ever happen. While the technical hurdles are huge and need much more complicated solutions than you've been envisioning the real issue is actually getting everyone to agree. Pretty much all solutions only work if everyone implements the same solution. World peace is honestly more likely."

As for your encryption suggestion. That's not accurate parallel, your solving one of the least important tracking issues by at a minimum doubling costs. There's dozens of known tracking methods today most likely hundreds of actual tracking methods. If we solve each one by making everything twice as slow and twice as expensive we simply won't have functional computers anymore.

There's a trade off you've got to make in this kind of fight. Right now all your solutions are coming with massive downsides that very few people would accept."

Even if you treat everyone like they have huge screens it would mean making things load 2-4 times slower and it still wouldn't help with tracking. If you're fudging the results the same way each time it's still trackable information. You could randomly report screen sizes 2-4 times your actual size but now you're still back to making things load 2-4 times slower and you've just increased your bandwidth requirements by 2-4 times as well. Now you've eliminated one of dozens of known tracking methods but have made your operation cost twice as much while also reducing it's usability. 

As for videos, yes it does require a handshake. The only other option is failures. For example youtube sends videos in different formats depending on user settings and capabilities. The handshake allows them to determine which video to use. If you eliminate the handshake you have no way to know if you're sending a valid format. You'll end up with a bunch of users who just see nothing and get no error because you're not allowing the issue to be reported back to the youtube servers and send the video in a format you can use. Or if you meant the client just requests it in whatever format it wants, then your back to doing a handshake because you're sending info to the servers and now the server can respond with invalid format and force the client to pick a new format and it can do that until the browser has exhausted all its choices."
technology,fdlkfni,t1_fdlji5a,1578526028.0,"You don't waste a little bandwidth you'd waste a ton. Things like Google maps need to know exactly what your looking at and send that information. If you hide that information the only option is send everything and let the browser sort it out. The problem with that is Google maps is terabytes of information, they can't send everything to everyone.

Even simple things like video is finger printable. You request a video from youtube and there is a back and forth about what formats the browser can accept. That information has to be exchanged in order to get a video to play. Unfortunately it also means sites can compile a complete list of formats you can play and use that as part of a unique fingerprint.

I don't think you understand the massive amount of work your changes would take. Many of them are impossible or would just outright ban some of the most used sites in the world."
