I'm suspecting that people are more lenient in your experience because at that age not everyone really has their act together, that it's just such a common occurrence anyway, and that's why this perspective is new to you.

I know where I live (with people of various ages, young professionals, middle aged, elderly - all in one building) that would just not fly. As long as you're not bothering people by doing this, I say all good.

He was waiting on someone for over an hour to get their ass in gear and switch their load because he needed to get his laundry done, he finally said fuck it and started taking her clothes out, bunch of underwear etc. Inconveniently, she walks in and starts FREAKING out about how he's touching her underwear and he's such a creep. Because of this, he was ridiculed by some of the other women in their small apartment complex too and labeled as a creep.

Just because *you* don't care, it doesn't mean other people don't care. Your indifference to other people's belongings is not shared universally, and some people value their time. You're putting x amount of people in an uncomfortable position by simply not being considerate. My building only has 2 sets of washers and dryers, if we had one or two people with your mindset, the rest of the building would be inconvenienced as a result.
