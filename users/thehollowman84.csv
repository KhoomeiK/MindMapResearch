These people are believing whatever they want, because its much easier and less taxing on their brains. They are boosting their egos, and making sure they are always victims. 

The only way is to call it out. These lies exist as a way for garbage people to justify being evil. 

My theory is, we already experienced this problem once as humans. What do you do when people decide its easier and more fun to do whatever they want, and refuse to help society? Thousands of years ago, the problem was ""fake gods"" telling people they can fuck and drink all day and do no work. The solution was to create a religions that made this behavior bad. 

I can imagine the old Jewish tribes, people constantly eating pigs, and getting parasites and getting sick. Smart people noticed the pattern and tried to say, dont eat that, its bad! People said, FUCK YOU I DO WHAT I WANT. So eventually they just said ""God doesnt want you to eat pork!"" 

I think this all stems from something nietzsce spoke about, the death of God. Yet we all live in his corpse. All our ideas on morality are Christian based. Yet most people don't actually believe in this God. Even the millions that go to church now don't. The main US Christian ideology mainly supports stopping people like Mary and Joseph, its nuts. 

We need new morality systems - and we're seeing them be formed. ""God"" is now society. ""Cancel Culture"" is the emergence of this morality. It's unrefined, and overly sensitive, but you can see society replacing the idea of God, with the idea of society being moral arbitors. That you shouldn't treat people like shit, not because you will be tortured when you die, but because you don't get to participate in all of society unless you follow the rules. 

Something we don't like to mentioin in politics is the flynn effect. That is, each older generation has on average 10 IQ points less than the younger generatioin below it.

""Oh they want you to be outraged!"" because Britain First is constantly thinking about me? They set up a far right organisation to troll me? 

No, they setup a far right organisation to spread far right propaganda, and organise, and attempt to infiltrate the mainstream. 

These aren't people who liked their facebook posts. They joined Britain First. They joined a far right organisation. 

If members of the Real IRA joined Sinn Fein would you be applauding? Oh bravo Sinn Fein, it must be because you saved them and brought them into the light.  Fuck off you would. 

If Far right muslims were entering the Labour party would you applaud them for bringing them to the centre? Again. No. You definitely wouldn't. 

And people are acting like you PWNED the ""left"". Just no. No. No! Madness. This pseudointellectualism has to stop. We can't just start off saying ""This is a dumb argument that i can take apart easily!"" and declare yourself the victor. You have to say things that make sense. You have to have a coherent argument. You need to test your logic."

unitedkingdom,fc3ai05,t1_fc2e7xf,1577385420.0,"Yup, this is where you remember Bercow was part of a political group that called for the hanging of Nelson Mandela as a terrorist. 

I've heard the same thing over and over. We need to be civil. Unless you're a brexit voter, then say or do anything you want, lie freely. If someone calls you a liar, they're being uncivil. You can say and do as you please though, and politicians all have to come running and do what you want. 

Literally all the ills of the world apparently stem from me being outraged that the rates of rape conviction are so low, and that black people should be treated like human beings. 

All my heroes were also told similar things. Every great spectre of change, was told sit down and be quiet. For hundreds of years it's been the call. ""Yes, things are bad, but let's not get silly and try to change them.""

Blatant lying and cheating are civil, but how dare you call people who voted to shut off most immigration from europe racist! They have complicated reasons for voting. You can't hear them of course. We'll never explain them. But trust us, they're definitely not racist! 

It's also bullshit. The right does the literal opposite to massive massive world wide success. Being civil is an idiots game. The next left leader is gonna be someone who is willing to tell the older people of this country they're the worst generation of humans, and they've failed as parents and custodians of the earth."
