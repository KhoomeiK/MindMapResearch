nba,ff5e724,t1_ff5dh4n,1579589103.0,"You know, scientists make theories and test them using all available evidence and data. There are no scientific theories that are 100% proven. You’re basically using the logic that because it can’t be proven it can’t be determined. Sure, if theoretically there was a player that was in all 30 locker rooms in this NBA era, they might have the most credible opinion but even then it wouldn’t be “the truth”. There is no “only way” you could know."

I don’t agree with his statements on Harden but that’s not what I’m arguing for or against. I agree that leadership is contextual, but that’s besides the point, from everything we’ve gathered, as fans, and from the media/players/coaches he has demonstrated himself to be a great leader. My point is me not knowing him personally doesn’t negate the fact that all other evidence points to him being a good leader."

This is one of those “smart takes” that woke posters here will salivate after but in reality it has zero substance."

If Luka never wins the title in Dallas, what are the chances he even stays? he could spend the next 8 years trying, and then go to the Lakers or any other team to win it all. or he spends his whole career in dallas and never wins a chip? what scenario do you have in mind of Luka never winning a chip for Dallas and somehow being considered the GOAT in Dallas?"
