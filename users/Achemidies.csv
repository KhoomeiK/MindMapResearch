FragileWhiteRedditor,fek116o,t1_fejatf1,1579190309.0,"Well you should, you post something about how terrible white people are and something about slavery, then I’ll give you gold or I’ll say ‘here take my upvote! <3’ and then once I give you gold you say ‘thank you kind stranger!’. We will have loads of upvotes after that, these schmucks love anything wholesome"

HardwareSwapUK,fddr8ye,t1_fddqiaz,1578321878.0,"Those are some good deals 👍🏻if it’s a build solely for profit the i5 would be your best call, lowballing is the worst, I can understand making an offer but people who obviously don’t have the money making ridiculously low offers is retarded. Like no you can’t have it for £400 less because you will pick it up now cash in hand."
HardwareSwapUK,fddqajv,t1_fddq1mg,1578321105.0,It depends how cheap you got the 2060 and RAM for? I’m from the West Midlands so I’m not help when it comes to determining the Irish market. If it really is a good deal maybe just finish the build with a good value i5 9600k to give you the funds for the 2070/9700k build?
HardwareSwapUK,fddptuo,t1_fddpnqv,1578320724.0,"If you do go for the 9700K deffo get a 2070 if you are going to sell it, personally if I see that it has a 9700k paired with a 2060 in my mind I’m just thinking that’s more money I’m going to spend because I need to upgrade that. I’m sure you can find one on Facebook marketplace that’s where the best deals are hands down"
HardwareSwapUK,fddpk2b,t3_ekudut,1578320496.0,Personally I’d grab the i7 9700K so when the time comes to upgrade your card (which it will) you will already have a strong future proof CPU sorted.
TIHI,fd7ts5e,t1_fd7pn1s,1578209983.0,I’ll have you know that anything related to Australia is currently a no joke zone on Reddit. I’m hoping you’ve already sent your bottle of water to Australia to put out the fires already?

gaming,fcjgt6p,t1_fcjg7ti,1577687061.0,"I really need to start doing that, it’s hard to look at you all sucking each other off. 

I’ll post one of these one day with my nutsack on the game case so please be there to give me gold and tell me how sorry you are for my loss? I’m counting on you man I won’t get through the loss of my third step uncle without your comments of encouragement, maybe you could offer to pm me if I need someone to talk to? Or tell me that it will all heal with time? Share your own experiences of how you dealt with it? Or write a witty comment of how he will be looking down on me? 

You can all go fuck yourselves I hate you and the rest of the 99% of reddit."
gaming,fcjfr10,t1_fcjfckw,1577685962.0,But surely you get tired of seeing these posts right? Every day is a new one with a sad tale slapped on it and why do we all have to act like we care all the time? Find it very tiring sometimes
gaming,fcjfo3i,t1_fcjeci3,1577685880.0,But this is a low effort karma grabbing post :(
gaming,fcjf2cz,t1_fcja9u8,1577685285.0,"Sick and tired of all these posts with the OP’s thinking we actually give two shits about their dead dog or uncle, it’s very late at night and I couldn’t give two fucks about your dead aunt who used to play halo combat evolved with you"
