She also shuts down a lot of lost/stolen property because she makes millions and seems to have forgotten that most people don't have a spare $1000 to replace a washer someone else destroyed or is keeping."
JustNoSO,ff7k5jp,t3_ersnz7,1579651461.0,I just want to say you need to be careful.  Your ex was a relationship you jumped  into after another bad relationship and now you seem to have made another  jump.
MensLib,fetbuqt,t1_fesz5lt,1579373681.0,"Let me google that for you.  From the articles I could find, because I can't find anything that shows a graph of how women are killed, I'm seeing that 70% of women in dv relationships are being strangled non-fatally. 
 Obvs some must be fatal since strangulation seems to be one of the top go-to's for men who commit domestic violence.  I watch a lot of true crime crap. 
 Lots of women are strangled to death. I am not, however, finding any true stats for fatal strangulations.  Perhaps your google-fu will work better than mine.

MensLib,fepbvt3,t1_fenm0i7,1579316738.0,No.  Men strangle women to death all the time.  Using their hands.  I count that as beating as it usually is accompanied by punching and kicking.  I'm a big fan of Discovery ID and I've seen many episodes where death resulted with no external weapon being used.

Sorry, all the ""we have it so much worse"" is bullshit.  Every generation has had it better than the last one with more luxuries and a better standard of living.  I couldn't afford to go get coffee three times a day in 1981 but lots of millennials seem to be able to."
AmItheAsshole,fefqei6,t1_fefpnrd,1579062240.0,"They think anything early than 1999 was halcyon days where we all had money to burn, 3 houses, 10 cars and no debt.  I'm 56, the end of the boomers.  My dad worked 2 jobs as a molder which was horrible work.  He had one new car in his entire life because I bought it for him after I won big in Vegas.  I lived paycheck to paycheck while I was raising my kids and I didn't get to go to college because my parents couldn't afford it.  It pisses me the fuck off how these people seem to think they're the only ones who've ever struggled."
AmItheAsshole,fefgtx6,t1_fef1l06,1579056029.0,He is wrong.  In 1981 I was making 4 bucks an hour and that was about a dollar and a half higher than minimum wage.  My rent was $150 and I still had a hard time making it sometimes.  Houses were about 30 grand in my area and there's no way I could have even thought about buying.  Just because inflation happens has no bearing whatsofuckingever on how hard I would have had to work.  It's bullshit to say older people had it easier.  They did not.  They worked their asses off to get what they have just as young people have to do now.

Yeah, child porn is bad, and the law wasn't written so that 16 years olds sending nudes to their bf would get caught up in it, yet get caught up in it they did.

Giving your rights away by asking for more government is never the answer.  Reddit, of course, is chock full of teenage edgelords who know everything so I guess it's par for the course.
