AmItheAsshole,ff8lizi,t1_ff8eqkx,1579684387.0,"I find the OP’s version of this situation suspect.  Human interactions are rarely one sided, more of a give and take.


There is no situation where I would ‘stop harping’ on my new spouse for the sake of my child.  But there is also no situation where I would subject my child to OP’s attitude.  If my child hated my new partner that much, my partner would be gone...a long long time ago.  I can’t live in that fight either.

Also this is completely an ultimatum.  At least as presented in the OP.  She won’t live with him,she doesn’t like him enough to try and doesn’t want therapy.  She just wants him gone."

AmItheAsshole,ff7c8bk,t1_ff7agud,1579646162.0,Ultimatums destroy marriages.  Forcing a parent to choose between their spouse and a child who has clearly been victimized by his mother will not help anything.
AmItheAsshole,ff7c0s7,t1_ff66qij,1579646005.0,"To be fair the child was likely victimized as well.

It seems all this started at 6 years old and was initiated/ fostered my a biological mother.

I do realize that kids at a certain age start to think for themselves, but brainwashing is difficult to overcome if at all.

All this doesn’t negate what you said about the home needing to be a safe place.  I don’t envy the father in this scenario.  It’s really horrible when parents do this to their kids.  I might suggest staying at Moms over the summer since the kid clearly doesn’t like being around step mom either.

I don’t think the OP is the asshole, but I think her ultimatum will break her relationship."

Also, and I’m by no means an expert on America history, but was there not a large contingent of freed slaves who left the America’s and settled in Freetown...as an option to return home?  And immigration happens all the time.  This woman is free to return to wherever DNA says she comes from.  Global immigration is a thing.  If she is a descendant of slaves, she could very well ‘return home’ if she went through the right channels and got the right paper work.

Lastly Chinese, at least Chinese Canadian, didn’t come here under great terms.  I’m not sure if the US had a similar history, but it’s worth a read.
