SuicideWatch,ff4g8um,t1_ff3u6xs,1579562872.0,"I only learned after being left almost (nothing dramatical though) alone after some difficult times around age 24 how valuable a stable family and as you age, group of friend is, until you get your own family. I discovered how strong friendships bonds can be once I met a Brazilian girl that had a crush (or liked me, while I was spending my time there pretty much as a loner, and kept me involved with the group, and it really helped). And as someone with a multicultural background (but only european) I partly travelled to discover (only in Europe though) but also to  flee, until I have found a balance. I wish you to find the same one."
Catholicism,fexkxia,t3_eqoxcq,1579432671.0,"Nice list,  wouldnt have added much, if anything."
NoFapChristians,fep6rx1,t3_epxn79,1579313405.0,I like E nomine - Psalm 23. Very calming and inspiring.
NoFapChristians,fep6j9h,t1_fenypxe,1579313252.0,"Indeed, or paradoxically a good partner should be a girlfriend, she can keep you excited but still push you towards building your common future (doesn't have to get anything more than flirting of intimacy). But ideally community is the way to go or being busy."
SuicideWatch,feeogjb,t3_eok4w3,1579037888.0,"I can feel you, hope you won't give into cynism and continue to try. Sometimes a few more attempts can turn out unexpectedly. No one has it always easy after all."
NoFapChristians,fdaes9w,t3_ejxoog,1578245226.0,I write a few lines on a document for a few years daily (about everything). It's worth the dedication.
NoFapChristians,fdadpkk,t1_fd6l5kx,1578244908.0,Ambiguous nickname for this subreddit.
SuicideWatch,fd1w81a,t3_ejrvnk,1578137782.0,"You write it from a throwaway and realize your mistakes, obviously people care about you and your behavior isn't dramatically bad, it's just a few, mistakes with few important consequences.

Keep doing your best."
FreightBrokers,fcxfgzj,t1_fcu5cp4,1578061553.0,"Thank you for sharing your knowledge about the field, as someone who had a mixed experience in the brokerage."
SuicideWatch,fcrpfax,t3_eiltmv,1577904850.0,"If your dog chooses your mom over you, it means the dog likes you and want you to focus on taking care of yourself (see the cup half full)."
SuicideWatch,fcn19ed,t1_fclgqku,1577800352.0,"In my opinion, you seem to have a lack of focus and direction in life in general. That's what usually helps to have a better and clearer mind. Also, university is in quite some cases, especially once you get burdened by work, very opressing. This is why university is not considered as easy and need you to have intelligence and support. There isn't a time, in comparaison to high school or work, when you can feel that your work is over.

I would suggest you to put in more effort into doing things as opposed to introspective thinking. Wish you to do better."
SuicideWatch,fcldnwf,t3_ehtamg,1577745390.0,"Which kind of mental health issues ? Have you shared your issues with someone ? If you are behing in studies, it's also difficult to have time to socialize, although socializing can motivate to study. If you have a basic job but hobbies it's still a good thing. Better to view the glass as half full. 

As for spending the new year alone, I can relate, something came in the way most of the time, even when I met truly nice people. Keep going."
SuicideWatch,fcfhb46,t3_eh5jyv,1577629917.0,"Unstable relationship can negatively affects all other aspects of your life, but can also be an opportunity if you learn to move on and keep the stories until you are able to tell about them once your life gets better.

I think a job is more important currently and do education as something extra. When it comes to love, keep it for later I guess unless you  can both manage to stay in good terms, which would be a good."
NoFap,fc6znjh,t1_fc6z8wd,1577493636.0,Glad you are receptive to the advice. Wish you to find some additional willpower to go with this advice and wish you to succeed with you studies.
NoFap,fc6yxq4,t1_fc4cipr,1577493105.0,"I am sorry that you view it that way, but looking back, I can assure you that you will regret it.  Instead, try to build yourself a nice group of trustful friends, guys and gals and I wish you that you meet a stable partner as well. It  might seem a little pety as advice but you will soon enough see the long lasting influence hook ups can have on your future."
NoFap,fc4ced6,t1_fc3s4qu,1577412613.0,Now avoid hook ups and you will be even happier in the long term. Hook ups are unholy. Basically it creates  chaos in life and doesn't contribute towards building a family.
SuicideWatch,fbzqdl5,t3_edulm8,1577256307.0,"You should be fine, life can often turn around with good habits and consistency as long as you stay healthy."
NoFapChristians,fbwey7b,t1_fbsahje,1577148140.0,"I had times where I felt truly holy and spotless. And I believe one can either get sidetracked or lose salvation.  Most people however get sidetracked in life, I believe."
NameThatSong,fbssfl1,t1_fbsp70x,1577059719.0,Just realized I posted the wrong title... this title was meant for another song.
