Just that they have been and that trends usually affect the outcome of the next data point (e.g. actors and show runners seeing the trend and wanting to keep it running). If Jodie gets a 4th season, I'm sure many people will be happy to see it, but it doesn't mean that there isn't a current trend."

That's literally a trend. Trends are what the statistics are doing now, not what they've done forever.  


Maybe you are confusing ""tradition"" with ""trend""."

Yeah, not true. I was a landlord at one point in time. I was constantly repairing stuff for my tenets, having the yard cleaned, dealing with the HOA, and paying taxes. I eventually sold the house after dealing with an asshole tenant that smoked in the house, destroyed the bannister, and, somehow, bled all over the carpet. This was after we had worked with them on the rent because they had lost their job. The amount of repairs I had to make on the house after they left was probably 3-4 times the deposit. I just wasn't making enough money to justify keeping the house.

I think you had a point about CEOs and executives being overpaid and teachers being underpaid. We have definite proof that the former's salaries have gone up disproportionally to the working class, but you lost me with ""owners and landlords"". People who finance things deserve a return on that finance, as long as that return is ethical."

todayilearned,fcj2pnf,t1_fcj0hl6,1577675793.0," I understand. This is my last post on this as well.

Being hit in the head with a rock doesn't mean someone either threw the rock or not. That's the point people are trying to explain about false dichotomy. The rock could have fallen off the back of a truck. The rock could have been dropped by a bird flying overhead. The rock could have tumbled down the mountain due to shifting Teutonic plates. It could be a meteorite! That's the problem with mainstream Christianity: it teaches you to think in binary. This belief is right, therefore that is wrong. I'm a sprinkler and you're a dunker, therefore you are going to hell, because I'm right. Christianity fights wars within itself because of that kind of binary zealotry.

I'm not here to change your mind. Your beliefs are your beliefs. But you have to know that some of the people you are talking to might have studied all of this a long time before they landed where they did. Like learned Koine Greek to study the Septuagint. Like strongly studied church history, read Josephus, and the Martyrs Mirror. Like read the Bible multiple, multiple times, and even read some Apocrypha (like the book of Enoch and Maccabees). And even read the Christian apologetics you keep posting. 

And some of us, because of that studying, land more on the side of Deism now. It's not because we're ignorant."

You don't get to define who a true Christian is. Ironically, according to your own system, only Christ gets to do that. That's the whole point with Matthew 7:1-2."
