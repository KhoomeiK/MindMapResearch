Jokes,ff77y98,t1_ff7213x,1579642892.0,"Point is that they were being used to increase the representative power of the (white men of the) state without actually being given freedom or rights or representation. The slave states ONLY wanted them to count as people for the purpose of determining how many representatives they got, and did not want to count them as people in any other regard. Northern states were essentially arguing that they can't have it both ways. 

The compromise of considering slaves 3/5 of a person is absolutely racist. Counting slaves as people solely when convenient for political gain would also absolutely be racist. Not counting slaves as people would also be racist because they were people and slavery was racist. There could be no non-racist solution regarding slavery in America that didn't hinge on its abolition..."

todayilearned,fdv1u26,t1_fdui10a,1578742206.0,I am explicitly referring to *not* life and death situations--imaginary threats. The problem is that police here are trained to think of *every* situation as a potential life and death one... It's really hammered into them. And then they become a threat to civilians' lives. Much more emphasis is placed on reacting immediately to a perceived threat than on remaining calm and taking steps to assess and/or de-escalate.

todayilearned,fdsjkg3,t1_fdsgleu,1578703956.0,"I acknowledged that the roles are usually entirely different in my comment. If it's harder for police officers to stay calm, that's all the more reason for there to be more emphasis during training on how to do that. It is a huge problem when police perceive their lives to be at risk constantly even when they are not. 

Maybe if police were trained on how to remain calm under stress they could properly assess the situation and would shoot less citizens who have imaginary weapons.

I mean, police expect untrained citizens to react calmly when the police are threatening their lives...  I don't find ""perceived risk"" to be a compelling excuse for failing to meet the standards they require of civilians whose lives are on the line."
Thoughts,fdsfz2a,t1_fdrumee,1578701914.0,">Look up ""suppression - coping mechanism"", it's actually one of the 4 medically recognized positive coping/defense mechanisms out of dozens of mal-adaptive strategies. Temporary suppression of emotions to ""get the job done"" is an important skill that all adults should strive to master.

I am aware that suppression is considered a form of emotion regulation. My point is that emotion regulation is not what is being taught to boys. ""Man up"" doesn't send the message that there is a better time and place to work through your emotions, so you should temporarily distance yourself from them. It sends the message that expressing these emotions is not acceptable and makes you less of a man. Full stop.


>In reality, females have a far higher proportion and rate of mental illnesses in developed and undeveloped societies

Women have a higher rate of ***diagnosis*** of mental illness than men. They are more likely to seek out help because they aren't taught that expressing and talking about emotions are unacceptable. Men are more likely to suffer in silence and more likely to die by suicide.


>Further, early puberty is not an indicator of quicker development of the abstract thinking skills necessary for maturity, thus it would be inappropriate to suggest that early puberty -> earlier maturity. In fact, there is evidence to suggest the opposite: 

My point was that ""girls mature faster than boys"" is referring to *physical maturation.* The verb mature does not strictly refer to psychological and emotional maturity. Physiologically, girls mature faster than boys, on average. However, puberty definitely does change the brain considerably, so there are likely be some differences in thinking too.


>girls that reach puberty *earlier than their peers* suffer higher rates of mental illness and have lower chances of economic success later on in life

Yes, that makes sense


> likely due to the effects that early puberty has on said vulnerable adolescents in female social groups, which can have harsh, hierarchical pecking orders. 

Wait, what? You don't think it has to do with receiving adult male sexual attention as a child and the fact that girls who go through puberty earlier are more likely to experience sexual abuse? ...It's because girls are mean?

tifu,fdsbzlv,t1_fds4c31,1578699121.0,"Eating works to an extent, but if I'm well and truly stoned, it does not make enough of a dent to get me to what I would really consider ""unhigh."" Can be good for taking the edge off, anyway. Showers just make me light headed if I'm too high. Kills my enjoyment of the high, maybe, but not the high itself. That's just my experience, though."
tifu,fdrm6ou,t1_fdqi0a2,1578686434.0,"I'm guessing that a little something was making it to your lungs despite not inhaling properly. Enough to give you a tiny morsel of the effect you would get from inhaling it normally.

...Though it is possible that the effect was psychosomatic. Hard to say for sure.

But yeah. Anytime you are dealing with concentrates, wait like ~15 minutes between hits. Matter fact, as a beginner, 10-15 minutes might be a good rule of thumb no matter what form you're inhaling (30 minutes to 1 hr for edibles). You can always get more high, but you can't really get unhigh except by waiting it out."
todayilearned,fdriace,t1_fdqzbns,1578684924.0,"I wish a big part of police training was in how to stay calm. I realize they are usually in an entirely different role, but I think we would be better off if that were emphasized, instead of emphasizing that everyone and everything is a potential threat."
Thoughts,fdposq6,t1_fdodjs3,1578634957.0,"Boys aren't actually taught how to regulate their emotions. They're taught to bottle them up, which is definitely not a mature trait... What's more, the only ""negative"" emotion that many boys are conditioned to allow themselves to express is anger, so sadness, frustration, loneliness, etc. are often channeled in that direction. Socializing boys this way makes them more emotionally stunted, not more mature. 

This might, in fact, be another reason that ""girls mature faster than boys."" I'm pretty sure that phrase is actually alluding to the fact that girls *on average* literally start puberty earlier than boys do, though."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdihkrz,t3_elg1a9,1578443082.0,"It's only weird if you are a grown adult and have a bed *covered* with stuffed animals, imo. Having ~1-2ish is so normal that I can't even imagine someone making fun of an adult for that. I don't think your roommate will make fun of you, but who knows if you're destined to have an asshole for a roommate... 

Anyway, loads of people need something to cuddle when they sleep. It's totally normal. Some people use body pillows and some use stuffed animals. You're fine either way."

OurPresident,fczd8ix,t3_ejawco,1578098600.0,"Something that I think is really overlooked about Yang's UBI plan is that it comes at the expense of other assistance programs. You give someone 1,000 a month but take away their housing and food assistance and do not even account for the amount of mouths they have to feed that are under 18 ... they're not going to be in a better place than they are now. Sure they can keep their benefits and forgo the $1000, but whichever way you slice it, it does not help the people that need it most. 

I also think it would put those programs in a more precarious position, since there would be less of an uproar when legislatures try to gut those programs and defund them. ""UBI is good enough for the rest of us. These are just lazy people trying to game the system and get as much money as they can scam out of the poor, helpless tax payers."" You know the drill.

I'm not against UBI, but I don't think Yang has the right plan for it."
