Say for example, I'd take a job in my wheelhouse but it would also have something I haven't done before as a cross-training possibility.  I'd level up on that and then I'd take a job doing my primary function and the secondary function to ensure I could be proficient.

I think if you put your cards on the table now, you'll be at a disadvantage.

You can't really bring up that you found out you were dramatically underpaid for the role because that's a death sentence.  You could make up some BS that the role was not what you were promised and leave it at that.

If you stay and push for a raise, they can tell you no and it may make them paranoid about keeping you around knowing you're unhappy.  If you do it at a year,  you're in a better spot.

ITCareerQuestions,ferbvl1,t3_eqaq6l,1579352186.0,"A few things.

First off, your co-worker can get in serious trouble for disclosing his salary.  So I would not mention that to your manager.

Secondly, did you research salaries in that area before you accepted the offer?  Even if you didn't, did you run a Cost-of-living calculator based on your previous pay against your new city?

For example, I was offered a job in the Bay area (one of my good buddies lives there).  The pay was a sizable increase over what I was making in the Midwest.  When I ran a cost-of-living calculator against it, it was a sizable pay cut...so I didn't take the gig and I didn't move.

Thirdly, I would not bring this up now at 3 months...the proper time to do it is during your annual review by stating something along the lines: ""I researched salaries in this area for this type of role and I'm below the average pay for this area.  As you can see from my performance, I'm better than average.""  If you don't get a sizable raise, start looking for a new gig."

AskLibertarians,feohd7d,t3_eq47ib,1579300164.0,"As others have mentioned about positive and negative rights (which are spot on), I'll address things more specifically. 

Regarding Social Security.  The government took a questionable idea and turned it into a Ponzi scheme.   Yes, Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.  Rather than taking the money you've paid into social security, holding it until you retire and paying it back with interest...they rely on the people currently working to pay for retirees compliments of the Social Security Trust.  This is compounded by the fact that life expectancy has increased 10 years since 1950.  Short version...people are living much longer after retirement which results in a higher liability to people paying into the system.  When it started it was 42 workers for 1 retiree.  As of 2010, it's 2.9 workers for one retiree.

 the concept of Universal Health Care does nothing to address the root causes as to why healthcare costs are increasing.  Rather than posting my long copy/pasta...I'll list a few of them.

1. Medical care costs are not transparent.  Obviously, you can't shop for emergency services, but most everything else you should be able to do.
2. Pharmaceutical costs.  This is in big part to the FDA and the ridiculously long and expensive approval process (average is 10 years and $2 billion dollars to get a drug approved).  Does it make us safer?  There are better ways to do this or at least have reciprocity with Canada and the EU.
3. Doctor Shortage.  This will only get worse due to an aging population...and why?  The shortage of doctors by 2025 is estimated to be between 60-90,000 doctors.  Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) is the U.S. Department of Education-recognized accrediting body for programs leading to MD and the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) is the U.S. Department of Education accrediting body for a DoA.  The LCME is jointly sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Medical Association (AMA).  There was a 20 year gap for new medical schools between 1981 and 2001 and a 7 year-gap between 2001 and the next accredition in 2008.  Since 2008, there have 23 new med schools accredited.  Not nearly enough to offset the upcoming demand.  Many qualified applicants are going to medical school outside this country.  Quite simply, there aren't enough medical schools to meet demand.  Fewer doctors plus an increased demand results in higher costs."

Not a good analogy.

You park a car in a lot owned by someone else.  I get permission from the owners to park my car in the same lot, but you're blocking the entrance.  The owner asks you to move to allow others to use the lot and you say, ""Fuck you, make me.""  And a court battle ensues which takes years. 

Of course, the owner could have your car towed, but that would probably cost him money...so the owner waits to see how it plays out in court.

The poles are NOT owned by the cable companies...they're owned by the city, state or utility that gave someone else express rights to use those poles...so your property rights argument falls flat.

>Excessive regulation doesn't cause ISP monopolies - private property rights do. Without access to poles and conduits, which were built by private companies years ago, new entrants would be completely unable to enter a market simply because securing the right to put poles and conduits over thousands of private properties would be impossible. Those ""regulations"" you're talking about are rights that the pole-owners have to keep others off of their poles.

That's not correct.  Utility poles are usually the property of the local or state government (or a utility company).  Google would get permission from the pole owner, then be blocked by the competition.  Comcast, AT&T and Verizon fought Google on moving their own wires to make room for the competitors...on utility poles owned by local and state governments or utilities.  In 2018, the FCC approved a One-Touch Make Ready to alleviate the delays caused by competitors..

Secondly, cities grant monopolies by causing excessive red tape on new competition.  I provided an anecdotal example on how my hometown's mayor and city council gave a monopoly to the cable company simply by causing so much red tape that competitors walked away.  Cable prices in that city were 42% more than neighboring cities with 3 competing services."

Libertarian,fedirtt,t3_eoke8i,1579012589.0,"It's too bad that this type of intervention is necessary (much like Net Neutrality)...all because of government-created and supported monopolies due to excessive regulation.

Of course, if these cable companies didn't have government-supported monopolies, they wouldn't have been able to get away with this anyway.  These monopolies are usually supported more at the local and state level.  Look at the headaches Google had to go through for Google Fiber.  It was bad enough they just threw in the towel.

I'll provide an anecdotal example which took years to resolve.  My hometown had exactly one cable provider up until about 10 years ago...Time-Warner.  Cable rates and broadband were 42% higher in this city than surrounding cities that all had more than 1 cable provider.  All the other major players tried to get in.  Comcast, AT&T, WoW...but were buried in so much red tape that after years of trying they also gave up.  

This only changed when the people got fed up after some of this was detailed in the local paper and the leadership of the city changed (new mayor and some city council turnover).  The end result is that up the markets by reducing the red tape and invited everyone to set up shop.  I'm convinced that Time-Warner bought off the Mayor and City Council for years."

[This](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-ignoring-jessica-yaniv-allows-her-to-distort-the-struggle-for-trans/) article has another perspective as to why that's true.

""But to ignore Ms. Yaniv is to overlook the fact that her actions affect real lives – not simply the women she has targeted, but also the trans people her actions inadvertently malign when she behaves litigiously and irrationally. Ms. Yaniv is already infamous in many far-right chat rooms and socially conservative publications, where she has become a caricature of what it means to be a trans person in Canada: a useful scapegoat, in other words, to dismiss legitimate efforts for equitable treatment for the trans community. To ignore her is to risk allowing that narrative to fester unchallenged. """
AskLibertarians,fecsz0b,t3_eoeqwe,1578983422.0,"I'm a libertarian and I believe IP comes with some rights.  The problem is exclusivity.  Too many companies sit on patents which stiffles innovation.  Conversely, many have a long period of exclusivity which also hurts innovation and competition.  Now where I differ from some libertarians is that I think of someone invests time and money in R&D, they should have a limited period of exclusivity (no more than 5 years). 

You're trying to use a red Herring to make your argument as IP and private property are 2 completely separate things."
