That ache is a result of the drugs. MDMA, Ayahuasca, etc. 

Let me give you some perspective. 

I was a good boy for most of my life. The first time  I touched illegal narcotics was to protect my brother in law from a criminal charge. We were hiking in the Smokey mountains and some self-righteous park ranger decided we were the people who made his life miserable. 

Since my good boy days, I've tried every possible drug on the planet. My psychiatrists tell me I'm a drug addict with schizophrenic tendencies. Guess what? They're right and wrong. 

Schizophrenia is a real diagnosis. I've struggled with it my entire life. Unfortunately, most doctors don't understand how to deal with it and are hesitant to give a diagnosis. I dealt with it my entire life and it was only in the last few years that my everyday struggle became an illness capable of being understood.

AskDocs,fclvw52,t1_fcljg81,1577757745.0,Take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/ehtm5x/ongoing_chest_pain_for_3_days/fclmgnb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Is it relevant to your circumstances? You have another active thread.
AskDoctorSmeeee,fclmgnb,t3_ehtm5x,1577751240.0,"That's a bad combination of drugs to pair. I'd stick with single drug trips until you're comfortable with stuff and never combine stimulants and something like molly or ecstasy. 

[Take a look at this link](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/weird-feeling-in-the-chest-after-mdma.569213/). Are any of your symptoms similar? Does it feel like a burning sensation in your chest, esophagus, or muscle ache? The burning sensation may be a chemical burn. I've had miserable weeks where I haven't taken enough water with my meds and they literally burn going down. It takes almost a week to heal and be able to feel normal. 

The vomiting, hot flashes and diarrhea could be the bad combination of drugs, bad drugs or your body just don't like MDMA. I don't think cocaine would still be bothering you at this point. 

I hope you feel better but for future trips, don't plan so many activities before and after. Make certain you know where your drugs are coming from and if you're not sure, just stick to weed. Make some edibles if you want a psychadelic, safe, trip."

I'd look up stretches and exercises for carpal tunnel and tendonitis. You're probably not there yet but on your way. Preventative exercise and stretching are your best defense."

CanadianMOMs,fcjextr,t1_fcivbxy,1577685163.0,"I just tried out my little contraption. It was just a pyrex bowl with a bit of window screen duck taped to the edges. 

Sifted it twice and was super happy. You can modify the diameter of the holes by cutting a + shape from 4 connecting smaller edges. It'll make a larger one. 

All it cost me was a window screen I'll replace in the spring, some duct tape, and patience. No giving the devil your money. Eff Amazon."
