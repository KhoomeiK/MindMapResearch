legaladvice,fe8qz7j,t1_fe6lc8h,1578929594.0,"So for negligence I'm just going to postulate (not a lawyer btw)

1. The policy have a duty to ensure that they only arrest people who are actually committing a crime.
2. They breached that activity by arresting you despite eye witness testimony,  and other factors 
3. They're the ones who arrested you thus they caused the breach.
4. Your damages would be your lost wages, as well as the cost of classes and loss of driving privileges due to their faulty arrest.

Not a lawyer... shouldn't you contact your lawyer?"

Next.... I'm not a lawyer, or a landlord, but here's my advice

1. Do some research- specifically learn what the market rates are in your area, and be prepared to either make, or negotiate to, a reasonable offer.  
2. Talk to your landlord, especially if you're a model tenant (rent on time, no complaints or issues, you were just being a good citizen with the whole building repair bit) .  Let them know if you want to stay and say ""I understand our lease has been very generous to us, and that we currently pay below market rate, I'm willing to pay a fair rate because xyz, and you will like it because of abc qualities we have.
3. Be prepared for the worst
4. With your cats, it's less about the disease and more about if they know not to inhale drywall, that said an alternative living arrangement for them isnt the worst idea.

Finally, check out r/legaladvice they get landlord/tenant questions fairly often and are a good place to ask.  Landlords dont like to evict people, so yea."
