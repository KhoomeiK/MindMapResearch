Stories like mine are pretty common from all the venezuelans who left during 2016 crisis just before the dictatorship got rough; everyone had to get crafty.

There are 5 millions like me not all were programmers of course.

What I say is that you need motivation and dedication, there's no eureka moment, there's nothing special to it; only determination, there are no tricks and no shortcuts.

You just code and get progressively better, and learn from your mistakes, and never stop learning; never lose the junior mentality."

I remember having to download deb packages by hand going to the cafe 3km away and getting one by one in a USB stick and their dependencies, many times because I'd always forget one.

I was using nano and then I got this eloquent javascript book and learned ES5 javascript with firefox.

Then the internet arrived for a little while, and I started using reddit and youtube, watching tutorials, learning english with cat memes.

My mom wanted me to stop using the computer and learn an actual skill, like the things they were teaching me in high school.

So as the edgy teenager I kept using the computer.

Then I found TF2, and my English got even better.

Years passed; I became legally an adult.

One day I logged into facebook and there was like, facebook developers, learn react, the new shiny thing, and I was like, hmmm.... sounds legit.

Some shady dude off the internet asked me if I wanted to go to Europe.

My mother always told me not to talk with shady dudes off the internet, so as the edgy teenager I still was I took the deal.

So I left home and came to Germany only to be exploited, yet mentored at the same time.

So then another shady dude asks me if I want to go to Turkey.

So there I was in Turkey but that didn't last long.

And then another shady dude asks me if I want to go to Finland.

I am still in Finland and actually was a sweet deal, and the shady dude is now my friend :D and actually a nice guy.

Meanwhile in my home country a dictator took over and destroyed everything, the place I was from is in total ruins, I am the one to keep my mother safe; and I'd be most likely starving to death if it wasn't for ubuntu, facebook, youtube, and shady dudes off the internet.

There was no eureka moment, only dedication.

Don't wait for an eureka moment that will never come, just go on; think that if you stop you will starve to death, because trust me, that's a great motivator."

Basically government spending and all those shenanigans happen because government is inefficient whereas high prices in the same parts of the private sector are purely artificial.

Look for instance at the tech industry, they are all private and very fair; most internet solutions are accessible to everyone, they provide education for cheap, and phones are cheap considering they are basically a super computer.

Healthcare is much cheaper to produce than tech, but guess what will get you in debt?... Basically they are taking advantage of the urgency and being very shitty.

rant,ff55gg8,t3_ermwbu,1579580765.0,"I live in a country with socialized healthcare and there's something you have missed.

It isn't the socialized healthcare that makes healthcare cheaper, because healthcare per person doesn't cost much to start with, the ones that are scamming people are hospitals and insurance because they hold a monopoly.

Socialized healthcare is much much more inefficient than a private countepart, in fact many of these countries with socialized healthcare are managed by private companies, because goverment can't cope. And these goverments go into debt to keep this going, it's a money shredder.

Yes, USA healthcare is by miles more efficient, but, they are ripping you off, so not only they spend less money but they bill you more; because they can.

You see, USA education works the same way; they are more efficient but they bill you more because they can do so, university profit margins are among the highest in any industry, their margins are comically high.

So socialized healthcare isn't really the solution, the solution is to give big pharma and big hospital competition; they can bill whatever they want because they have no competition and they are using government in their favor; they are pulling off a huge scam, and your government is looking to the side and actually punishing the people that are attempting to fix that. (there's a video somewhere of someone who tried to start their own ambulance service which was much cheaper and was quickly shut down).

The issue with healthcare is that it is too easy to monopolize once it goes private, for which it is debatable it might as well be better for it to be monopolized by the government, but the government sucks at running healthcare and wastes a lot of money, so what to do? what to do?...

In an optimal world healthcare would be private and hospitals would just bill what's right to keep healthy profits margins.

We don't live in that world."

Even worse, most of south america (not all but most) being a highly mixed place, race, really is ignored to the core, to the point you don't even realize it; skin color jokes are akin to joking because your looks, your clothing style, etc... and people would often call each other by attributes, of which skin color is one; skinny, fat, tall, and of course, negro; which is literally the original origin of you guessed it, the N-woooord, wooooho; which ironically is a neutral and sometimes affectionate word, so Americans turned up a word that for us was super normal, and still is for us, into downright racist.

While xenophobia can be downright insane in SA (irrational hate between nationalities), racism is almost non existent; to a level you wouldn't see anywhere else, and now that I live in Europe, is honestly one of the hardest points of adaptation to me; while xenophobia is much lower here, surprisingly, lol because they seem to claim otherwise.

Race is too much of a big deal, even here in europe, at least to my point of view; but hey I come from the extreme opposite, I realize it's not as racist as something like south africa or india, but compared to my city in south america, geez people here do care about race.

For instance I once said oh look those guys looks like criminals, it was two guys a black and white guy, and the only black guy around; he made me uneasy; and other people called me out racist, but it took me a while to realize, it was because he was black, I wasn't even minding that, in my mind I didn't look at that, I just thought he looked like a criminal. They later tried to get in the common building :P so hey, I was right.

Whenever I have a problem with someone I notice they try to be nicer than they would be if I was otherwise.

And I have virtually 0 friends of other races, which people find odd; but what I find odd is that in a white majority country your friends wouldn't be virtually all white; when I see minorities hanging out together, I think it's the most fucking odd thing ever, like WTF, how can that happen?... math doesn't add up; full black families?...

I just wanted to mention, why would you chose a 1x setup for bikepacking.

In my last ""offroad"" bikepacking trip, hitting 70kph was quite a normal occurrence once I hit a small road, and sometimes in flattish areas when the wind is in your favor you could get to 50kph, and oh boy I needed it, specially after climbing 2km the pyrenees and going downhill like crazy over some small spanish road.

I was thankful of my 2x setup, heck 3x would've probably been better, I got stuck a couple of times because 24-36 simply wasn't enough, speeds varied between a crawling speed to bitch I am passing cars.

And a 24-36 is equivalent to a 32-48, but a 32-11 doesn't get close to my 36-11; still it was insufficient for 70kph, I'd have wanted a 20-32-40 setup at the front if I could choose again."

It's just like dogs, you have a lot of subspecies, then you have domestic dogs, of which there are many breeds; if the pug goes away (which let's admit these tiny monsters are no way a product of nature); that doesn't mean a dog species goes away, just human egos.
