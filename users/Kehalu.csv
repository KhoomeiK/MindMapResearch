MMORPG,ff8na4k,t3_erwau5,1579687095.0,"Here's why I personally think so:

1. They cost way too much to develop. Why spend tens of millions making an MMO when you can spend a tiny fraction of that on a mobile game that'll probably make you more money with less risk? The costs don't disappear once the game is done, either. Other than running costs like servers and software updates, you've also got to keep a significant team of people to constantly create content. 

2. People want instant gratification. Classic WoW is kinda popular, but it was the first to start making the genre more open to casual gamers and years of 'quality of life' changes have meant that gamers don't want any inconvenience whatsoever. Inconvenience is a big part of what made older MMOs feel rewarding. Younger gamers don't want to sit down and play the same game for ten hours. They might still spend ten hours at the computer, but it's all in quick bursts. Lobby based games capture the attention nicely because it's 10-20 minutes of high intensity action and then you can take a rest. MMOs don't have the same ebb and flow gameplay, it's just a long, slow burn, with occasional peaks. Killing a raid boss is satisfying but doesn't feel like the personal triumph that winning a battle royale or reaching your target rank in a competitive game does.

3. Microtransactions. The very nature of microtransactions is antithetic to the concept of an MMO. MMOs are about time investment and slowly building up your character to take on bigger and better things. Being able to pay for stuff, even cosmetic stuff, cheapens other rewards. How many MMOs have we seen where the best cosmetics are all bought with real money?"
MMORPG,ff8n16d,t1_ff8jupx,1579686718.0,"Give it a week and see what everyone's doing when the hardcore people have rushed to end game. Sure, it's early access, but having no content is a good way to kill the hype for your game dead in the water, even if it gets added later on. Look at Sea of Thieves. Launched with basically nothing to do outside of the very basic gameplay loop and quickly lost interest. These days it's got a lot of great content but struggling to bring the player base back."

teachinginkorea,ff870u6,t3_ergfc5,1579667803.0,"I've lived in Seoul and Gwangmyeong. If you don't know Gwangmyeong, it's the city where Ikea is. It doesn't have a lot to offer, but I liked it. It's all kids and working adults without much in between. I'd say the majority of people living in Gwangmyeong live there for cheaper housing and commute to Seoul, because Seoul is literally right over the river. There are two subway stations that are easily accessible, though it does depend where you are living exactly. 

I used to catch the train every weekend to Heukseok and it would take about an hour, give or take ten minutes, because that's where my girlfriend was living. If I didn't have a place to stay in Seoul it might have been a bit too annoying to go there every weekend. The last thing you want to do after a day of shopping is catch three different trains to get back home.

Overall, I'd recommend it, but only if you're not the sort of person who likes drinking and clubbing and other night life. Also, there are basically no foreigners. I think I saw three foreigners in the whole time I was there. Although, at the bottom of my building there was a chicken feet restaurant, and one night I was woken up by three loud Americans eating and drinking there. My building was hidden in a suburb so I have no idea how they found themselves there. Presumably they lived closeby. Never actually met them in the end.

Edit: Out of curiosity I just had a look on Google Maps and it seems like construction has exploded in the five years since I was there. It looks really busy and seems to be growing quite rapidly. Probably a bit more exciting place to live in 2020. In the [little shopping district](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4482394,126.8837228,3a,75y,204.51h,94.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQCcMeltu05hhHAXWs5bKwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) nearby where I used to live there are cars and people everywhere.

asianamerican,ff49aqb,t1_ff43mkg,1579558347.0,"I think you've summed up my thoughts on the whole Parasite thing very well. The main reason Parasite is getting any attention is because it had a widespread Western release and Bong has done films in English before so it's a director that audiences are familiar with. As you say, it also attracts the 'woke' audience who will sing its praises simply because it's a foreign film, ignoring the fact that it might be the only foreign film they've watched all year. 

Forming an opinion based on a very small sample size is something you see over and over again when people interact with people from cultures they aren't familiar with. They'll attribute anything unusual to being unique to that culture, rather than just a quirk of the person themselves. They might have a Nigerian neighbour who paints their mailbox green and so they assume that is a traditional Nigerian practice to bring in good luck (or something), without ever actually asking the guy. In reality, he just likes having a green mailbox.

So you've got people who have never seen a Korean film outside of Oldboy and Parasite making comments, tweeting about, and hell, even *writing articles* about a film industry that they've only experienced through the lens of two pieces. They get away with their commentary because their readers are even less informed and automatically assume the author to be an authority on the Korean film simply because they're writing about it. If you'd only ever seen Oldboy and Parasite, you'd probably make the following assumptions about Korean films:

* They're graphically violent

* There's always a big twist

* Revenge, deceit, and corruption are common themes

The bravest woke commentators take these limited observations and confidently say that since these things appear in ""Korean film"", they are in fact inherent aspects of Korean culture as a whole. Once again, they can get away with it, because their readers aren't Korean and will never bother to question the fact that an entire country of 50 million+ is being labelled as corrupt and sneaky."

Hagwons usually start looking for replacements about 2 months before they're actually needed, so I had my interview on the 17th of September (I think) but didn't begin working until the 31st of October. In the mean time they sent me to the Korean embassy in Fukuoka and the school covered flights and accommodation. Either way, a return flight to Fukuoka and two nights accommodation is going to be cheaper than the international air fare they normally have to pay.
