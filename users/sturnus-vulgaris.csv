In 1992, Heemeyer purchased 2 acres (0.8 ha) of land from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency organized to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He purchased the land for $42,000 to build a muffler shop and subsequently agreed to sell the land to Cody Docheff to build a concrete batch plant, Mountain Park Concrete. The agreed price was $250,000. According to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer changed his mind and increased the price to $375,000, and later demanded a deal worth approximately $1 million. Some believed that this negotiation happened before the rezoning proposal was heard by the town council.[5]
In 2001, the zoning commission and the town's trustees approved the construction of a concrete batch plant. Heemeyer attempted to appeal the decision but was unsuccessful. It was claimed by Heemeyer that the construction blocked access to the shop. Heemeyer was subsequently fined $2,500 by the Granby town council for various violations, including ""junk cars on the property and not being hooked up to the sewer line;"" he had apparently tried to cross 8 feet (2.4 m) of the concrete factory land to hook up to the sewer line.

You have to make trade offs between what bands a radio does, how well they do them, and how far they can send a clear signal. You can buy a multiband that gives you 15w on 4 bands or a specialized radio that does 60w on one band. Depending on your local conditions, either might be a good option, but better range is often important.

When you do, you realize the rules of grammar, punctuation, and spelling-- we take as law-- weren't codified until later. And in that, they were adopted arbitrarily, mostly in a classist attempt to demonstrate proficiency in Latin.

The elocutionists and pedantic grammarians of the Victorian age and their descendants took a living, vital language, pumped it with fermaldyhyde, pinned it to a board and marvelled at how clever they were being. They wanted a formal, dead language like Latin so that business and military communications were more standardized. And we use that monolith to write love songs.

Shakespeare and everyone before him wrote as they spoke. There was no ""to, two, too"" to worry about-- if there was no spoken difference, there was no written difference. If he'd have had to worry about table manners, chances are he'd never have been so brilliant nor prolific as he was."

...you did say tape measure, right? The image in my head."
HamRadio,fd3p93b,t1_fd3jdqa,1578160527.0,"I'm going to start out just getting connected to the local club. Right now I'll probably focus on voice-- but I honestly have little clue where to start with equipment and what all else.

Long term goal-- I'm interested in space. I think tracking satellites and communicating with the ISS is awesome. 

I'm also into DIY and antiques. I've messed around with restoring vintage electronics. I kind of want to make my own rig with an old radio and a raspberry pi. That's crazy talk though at this stage."
PoliticalHumor,fcwid8s,t1_fcwawfg,1578026418.0,"I think expecting an absolute plan and consensus at the get go is problematic. Kennedy said we're putting a man on the moon. He didn't tell NASA how to do it.

I want national health care solved in this country-- affordable and universal. I'm not voting for another person who doesn't have that as their stated end goal. Whether they get there in a single term is going to depend on so many outside factors that it is immaterial in a way.

Not that we should be aspirational toward him, but think of Trump. He's building the wall. That's all he has to say and his supporters go nuts-- lockstep to the goal. He never addressed whether it was possible or if there was enough consensus. He's building the wall. It may be a fence. It may be totally worthless, but his supporters are head over heels because he is ""building the wall.""

That's how political movements work, a big push and then a bunch of compromises. But if you start at ""Let's build some sporadic fencing,"" you never get off the ground."
