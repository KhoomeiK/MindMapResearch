GalaxyS9,ffc5tgb,t1_ffc2nge,1579792211.0,I'm not sure I understand you... I swipe the volume the lowest it can go before turning it to mute and that's that. It doesn't go lower?

GalaxyS9,ff2veng,t3_er7sz8,1579525657.0,"Mine has a led light that comes on when you hit the sweet spot so you know. It doesn't charge as fast as if I had stuck the cord directly into the phone, though. But I like it."

GalaxyS9,feyemdo,t3_eqne4h,1579444438.0,Thanks for posting this. We have a problem at my house. My s9 steals all the wifi and my gf's iPhone becomes slow. Maybe it's this issue that you mention! I'll try keeping bt off unless I need it and see if that works.

GalaxyS9,fe9otzq,t1_fe9588p,1578940116.0,I don't have to imagine :) it's all CenturyLink provides at my house. And we're not switching to cox. Too expensive.
GalaxyS9,fe8okky,t3_eo40f3,1578928668.0,Don't use Facebook. Download Metal. It has Facebook and Twitter in one app. Cuts way down on drain.
GalaxyS9,fe8o77p,t3_eo2xsp,1578928447.0,"Well I don't think my phone is trying to download a bunch of stuff now since Christmas... It can be idle not doing anything and her phone won't load a single thing. I'll try going into the modem settings then, and see to what extent it is hogging all the wifi. Maybe a new modem would work, but it's strange my previous phone didn't do this."
GalaxyS9,fe85r7s,t1_fe846lk,1578922883.0,"So you think it might be the router, not my phone that's hogging wifi?"
GalaxyS9,fe7w05o,t3_eo2xsp,1578919824.0,Well that's the problem. Bad cell coverage in the house too. But if I don't turn wifi off on my s9 then my gf can't use her iPhone.
samsunggalaxys9,fe7j64o,t3_enxylj,1578915279.0,I have the same issue.. And visual voicemail doesn't work either. I have to check my voicemail the old fashioned way buly dialing a 1. :(

GalaxyS9,fcgkj19,t3_eehhye,1577641116.0,Is there a way (or an app) that just allows a charge up to 80% like iphone has? I'd like to keep my phone 40 - 80% as is recommended for battery life.
iphone,fcaryy8,t3_egly1y,1577575456.0,"My gf got an iPhone a year ago. It came with a # but she changed it. Now whenever she sends an mms msg, it comes from the old # that was on her phone first. So when I get the messages they open a new chat and she can't receive messages from the old #. The old # just sends pictures.
I've tried to figure this out for a year now but have had no luck. Is it something to do with her apple ID? Or the messaging app? Please help I really appreciate it. Dr Google is not a help."

samsunggalaxys9,fc5erk1,t3_e9suw7,1577455441.0,There's no such thing as mounting. You just insert the sd in. If it's not being recognized that might mean something is wrong with the sd. Insert into one of those bigger ones that you can slide into a computer and check it out for errors.
samsunggalaxys9,facnp6l,t3_d748lm,1575943151.0,"Download cx explorer or really any file explorer. It'll probably show you what ""other"" is and then you can see if it's something to remove."
