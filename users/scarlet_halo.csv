MyChemicalRomance,ff9ij0t,t3_esarep,1579713750.0,"I just annoyed my best friend (who isn't a fan) by texting her Disgusting MCR Facts as if I were a subscription bot last week lol. This thread was meant for me. 

- Per Frank, the Way Brothers have some sort of armpit condition that make them rather stinky people to live with. And Mikey's toenails are ""like talons.""

- Gerard had just had surgery for a dental abscess during the recording of Bullets, and they had to record the album super quick while Geoff Rickley was still in Jersey. Because Gee couldn't be drugged up the entire time, they hid his pain meds from him to record. 

If that isn't bad enough, while he moaned in pain from lack of relief, Alex Saavedra said something along the lines of, ""Gerard, come here buddy,"" and held out his arms for what looked like a hug. When Gerard got close enough, Alex BACKHANDED THE HELL OUT OF HIM and told him to go continue recording, immediately. 

- [This interview](https://youtu.be/dOtm2bJavQA) with a porn star to be put in the middle of a porno double-feature, for some reason. Sans Ray, so they can discuss his porn habits. 

- Gerard and Mikey's mom had a room of antique dolls in their house which Gerard had to run through every night to get to his bedroom. 

- They found a dead man in the pond in the park where Gerard and Mikey played as kids. 

- Mikey pirated Disney movies in order to make money to buy Smashing Pumpkins tickets. Supposedly, the FBI showed up at the Way residence. 

- Consequently, Gerard attended the following concert with Mikey and was mistaken for Billy Corgan because his head was shaved at the time. 

More TBA because for some ungodly reason I can't think of a suitable one for Frank RN."
