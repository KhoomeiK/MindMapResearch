dogs,ff2y1yf,t1_ff2nc5y,1579528269.0,That’s not gonna work. My dog has a bit of anxiety when it comes to seperation so keeping her in room or backyard wouldn’t work. Not to mention the weather here around this time is wild as there are chancea of lightining and tornado’s often and i don’t wanna risk it.

Max: 
This year in may i had to say goodbye to my dog i have had for 6 years and since i was 10. He sadly had a tumor in his heart and was suffering from chf. We thought he had been he had been healing but sadly that thought had been wrong as two days after he thought that he put him down and buried him. I just hope wherever he is he is in a better place.

Maisy: About a month after max’s death we had found an ad about a lab/golden mix puppy that was three month’s old. Of course we thought that it had been enough time for us to get a new dog. And she turned out to be very different from our calm, sweet boy. Besides this being our first time raising a girl she was very hyper and had a lot of quirks such as drinking out of sinks instead of her bowl. But soon those quirks started to grow on us and now we find her quirks endering and cute. 

We decided that whatever mistakes we made with max would be fixed with maisy to make sure that her life would be as happy and even more happier than max’s and we’re even discussing getting maisy a new friend soon from the shelter"
dogs,fe6phjw,t1_fe06law,1578899382.0,Yeah tbh i looked it up and it may just be because she’s extra needy rn due to being in heat.
dogs,fdv5nmw,t3_emnqy7,1578743498.0,"My dogs name is maisy(maizey,maizy) everyone in my family as their own way of spelling it. We have several different names for her but i call her maemae or meimei. Which i’ve called her since she was a puppy"

Advice,fddg5lc,t1_fddcar3,1578310800.0,Trust me saying he was anger issues will result in a bigger fight
Advice,fddg51k,t1_fddbq2j,1578310780.0,I mean my dad has a lot of pent up anger and undeniable emotional trauma but he refuses to let it out due to him being kinda told the whole “emotions make you weak mindset.” Type thing
Advice,fddfosg,t1_fddc3gg,1578310190.0,I mean it’s mostly in a closed space in his office though he has a history of while not hitting our dogs he scares them a lot due to his agression
Advice,fddb7k2,t1_fddazsy,1578303656.0,I mean it’s no excuse but my dad was abused by his dad so i think he’s unknowingly picked up on some of his mannerisms. There was only one time he insulted me before this which was several years ago when he was newer to being a parent. And he has a very bad temper he’s never hit me or anyone in my family. Just kinda yells at throws things but never directly to hit us.

dogs,fc3uy94,t1_fc2q34p,1577399288.0,Dog bakery to be exact. And the dog ice cream is just ice cream made special towards dogs. If’s the frosty paws brand so. The only human food my dog gets are esentially vegtables and other things that are nutruttious for her.
dogs,fc3ut4f,t1_fc2p0il,1577399184.0,Sorry for the late response. But dog ice cream is just something my dog gets sometimes that’s in a little paper container and it’s custom made so it’s safe for dogs. Also we’re planning on going towards a bakery customized towards dogs so we can get her a proper cake. The only human food she gets is usually vegtables or fish which are good for her.
AskReddit,fbg8ph5,t3_eczx54,1576840133.0,My dumbass really thought that the plate my sister grabbed for her food was my plate and i went to go grab it again out of the cupboard. I promise i am mentally okay
