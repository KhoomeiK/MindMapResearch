TooAfraidToAsk,ff5t1fs,t3_erl3o2,1579609154.0,"Here's my two cents in the matter as a trans person:

If you're not interested because you don't vibe with the person, it's not your thing, it didn't click, of course it's not transphobic. It happens. Sometimes I'm not interested in the cis people who hit on me, I'm not cisphobic.

It becomes transphobic when you don't know the person, you haven't once talked to them and you simply assume it won't work because they're trans. Even thinking like, hey, they must have not gone through gender reassignment surgery.

It's fine if you're not attracted to someone. It's not fine to discriminate someone with assumptions."

Lord of The Rings is good, but it's dense and not nearly as meta. A Song of Ice and Fire is good, but it doesn't come close. The closest I ever got to feeling the same thing was with The Hollow on Netflix but it's just because of self awareness of the show itself.

I don't think I'll ever find a series this good. If I could erase one thing from my head, would be this series, so I get to experience it all again."
