I set the amount I paid myself. So disregarding exact amounts, I’ve paid about $2800. I don’t even want to think about it because I’m still mad because I could’ve avoided the whole situation altogether but I legitimately was curled up in a ball on the floor in pain, and therefore thought something was seriously wrong. I don’t have the best health for as young as I am and have chronic pain anyways, so it takes a good amount of pain for me to consider something serious might be happening.

Instead of it being a discussion, I ended up offending him greatly and he was going to have himself checked out and what not. That reaction, while understandable, made me feel insecure about having sex with a partner. It was a part of me I evaluated too harshly. Luckily, I’m in a relationship now where both parties are sexual! It’s still difficult though because sometimes we are too drained by the day to do much more than a goodnight kiss. I just remind him that yes, I am quite literally always horny and all he has to do is say the word. He’s very insecure as well, but has made leaps and bounds in that aspect. For the first year of our relationship it was sex in the dark with only the necessary articles removed. I about lept for joy when he took off his shirt for the first time!

Yes, it’s good to reframe things and see them in a different light but dude, the chemical imbalance in my brain couldn’t give less of a shit if I’m always positive or not.


Edit for clarity/spelling because autocorrect is a terrible guesser."

cats,fdhh3xj,t1_fdhgxzw,1578422519.0,Hey thanks! That’s actually good advice! He’s a rather erm... rotund cat and gets into plenty of things he shouldn’t so I’ll have to try this lavender idea. Appreciate ya!

cats,fdhg18s,t1_fdhfqul,1578421868.0,"Some nicknames are only reserved for when cats are being assholes. For example, Sterrin will sometimes be called “Wee Fuck” when he is doing something deserving of that title, like when I finally got a succulent to take care of and he destroyed it in less than 24 hrs."
cats,fdhflk2,t1_fdhekv4,1578421612.0,I imagine Churro did something to earn the nickname “demon”!
Awwducational,fdhb01y,t3_elc6nh,1578419148.0,"We had a plethora of turkey vultures that would sun themselves in the trees surrounding the school. Eventually we used the vultures to tell when spring was near because they disappeared during the winter. As soon as the turkey vultures returned, we knew that things were warming up."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdfxa5t,t3_el2wyj,1578372744.0,"This is a tad bit of a cheat, but the [burning barrels case](https://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/29326849.html) from my home town. Nothing has ever come out of it, and given the lack of resources and coverage, I doubt it will. They reopened the case in 2013 after a man was arrested for two other murders and was supposedly in a relationship with the barrel victim, but nothing really came of it. The burning barrel cases happened very near to my house when I lived in the county and scared me to death since I was a kid. I think about this case all the time and really wish the person who committed this monstrosity would be found already."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdfw7mn,t1_fdflxpi,1578371873.0,"Agreed. I vaguely remembered it being discussed and on TV at one point but I never thought much about it until I watch the Netflix docuseries on it. That whole situation is seriously messed up. I feel like we would be closer to finding Madeline if it wasn’t for that police “investigation”. The whole case was a mess from start to finish and because of that there’s not enough information to accurately point at anyone. I don’t think it was the parents, but I do think it was someone close or at the very least watching the family."
cats,fdfu0cb,t1_fdeuy32,1578370184.0,"My cat tries to jump in my pants while I’m putting them on. He knows my work schedule and if my alarm doesn’t wake me up, an almost 20 lb cat standing on my face howling sure does. It’s like he can’t possibly wait another second to make my morning routine as difficult as possible."
Advice,fdef6yf,t1_fdeet46,1578337703.0,"We all know this, unfortunately. We have all tried a great amount to help him... hearing it from someone else really solidifies the situation though. We do love him, and when he’s stable he’s actually really fun to be around! It’s just that we never know what version of him we are going to get, and how long that version will stick around. I just wish he would accept some help, but none of us can for e him to do that. It’s his decision. 

Thank you for your advice."
Advice,fde6la2,t1_fdd0rpc,1578332306.0,"He also has plenty to do. He went on a big spiel about how successful his food truck business is going to be and went and bought a food truck. He hasn’t touched it in a month. He won’t let anyone help him, even though we’ve all tried. We want him to succeed and find productive ways to use his time but at this point it’s just self sabotage."
Advice,fde6cbi,t1_fdd0rpc,1578332150.0,He believes he is the victim and thus doesn’t think he’s doing anything wrong. Therapy and such has been suggested before. However he also doesn’t believe mental illness exists so the point is moot.
AskReddit,fdczv4w,t3_ekgrxd,1578289364.0,"I’m about to show my age here but whatever. Alright so I am somewhere between 8-10 years old. Whenever the time the Suit Life of Zack and Cody was popular on Disney. Anyway, I fall asleep watching this show and have the most beautiful dream of me and Cole Sprouse getting married. Everything was warm and white and beautiful and my child heart though that’s what love must be like. I woke up to find myself absolutely infatuated with Cole Sprouse and infatuated with the show because I see the love of my life right there on the screen. 

Not gonna lie though, Cole Sprouse is still hot as hell and I still get a tiny dose of butterflies when I see pictures. That dream really had an impact on me dammit."
podcasts,fct3zyl,t3_eiqxta,1577932290.0,Honeydew. It’s hosted by Ryan Sickler and it’s just him talking to people about the awful things they went through and how they made it through. It’s actually very wholesome and a good listen if you’re struggling. Covers everything from single parenthood to abuse and survival. Definitely recommend.
AskReddit,fcrgn3x,t3_eifsmg,1577901575.0,"I was a pretty fearless kid for the most part. Ghosts and monsters didn’t phase me. However, my parents favorite thing to remind me of is that once I was absolutely TERRIFIED of windshield wipers. If I was in the car when It was raining, I’d be in my car seat screaming. One time my grandma forgot this fear and went through a car wash. Cue me screaming bloody murder when she used her wipers and my grandma panicking and trying to console me not realizing the wipers were the issue. 

I have one very fuzzy memory of my dad putting me in the front seat of his truck and turning on the wipers and telling me “it’s okay. They’re not going to hurt you” until I calmed down and realized that windshield wipers weren’t dangerous. I genuinely don’t know if this is a real memory or a dream or some false memory I created as I was very young during the time of my windshield wiper fear."

AskReddit,fclyxa1,t3_ehmt6u,1577759894.0,"I saw my first dead body last summer.
I was visiting some family with my boyfriend in a town that’s pretty big on outdoor recreation. One of the most popular things to do is white water rafting. We got a lot of water this year and the river was so deep and turbulent officials were recommending people stay away because people were drowning left and right. Well, on our way back home, my boyfriend and I saw emergency vehicles everywhere by the side of the road on the river’s edge. People were visibly distraught, some crying while officials paced the river banks. My boyfriend goes “someone must’ve died” and right as he says that, we saw officials pull a body out of the river. They just kind of... stood over the body. No one did anything. Not a lot bothers me, but seeing a dead person yanked out of a river made me feel sick to stomach and that image is eternally etched into my brain."
AskReddit,fclxrja,t3_ehsc7n,1577759066.0,"I work with kids and their burns are pretty brutal sometimes, especially because they don’t know why they are funny. One time, a kid requested I draw him a football helmet to color in. Why I didn’t just go print one out, I’ll never know.
