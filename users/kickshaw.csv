There's no ""safe sane consensual"" kink play possible for choking/strangulation, only ""risk-aware consensual"" kink, because there's no 100% safe way to compress the human neck like that and not risk serious injury or death. Anecdotal success stories don't make it safe.

It's meant to cut down on cat overpopulation by reducing the number of breeding cats in an area while keeping the number of cats competing for resources the same. 

Many TNR vets use [eartipping](https://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/veterinary/eartipping), cutting off the tip of the cat's ear while it's still under anesthesia for neutering surgery. It doesn't really hurt or impair the cat. And the eartipping makes it easy to tell from a distance that a cat has already been fixed, so you don't have to waste time & money and stress out the cat by taking it to a vet to be cut open again."

He will then proceed to never actually *use* this name where we can hear it, because apparently their Mandalorian Way includes never referring to other Mandalorians by birth names even though they're all wearing near-visually-identical armor, which must make calling roll pretty difficult. 

If we don't get a Baby Yoda name over hiatus or in season 2's first episode, I'm going to start calling him Baby Mudhorn in self-defense, since we know that's at least his clan name now."

CatsAreAssholes,fc1ni25,t1_fc0wvsf,1577324076.0,"PSA / FYI, while I don't doubt your story and 24 hours was definitely not long enough to hurt the cat, in general ""they'll eat when they're hungry"" is not a power game that should be used for very long with cats. If a cat hasn't eaten well or at all in 3-4 days, [it may be a medical emergency](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/liver-disease-fatty-liver-syndrome-in-cats), because cats are prone to hepatic lipidosis / fatty liver syndrome. Basically after days of a cat not eating, their body starts to break down body fat for nutrients; but the cat liver kinda sucks and can be easily overwhelmed by processing too much fat too quickly, so the liver fails and the cat gets very sick or dies. 

TL;DR If a picky eater cat hasn't eaten after 3 days, take them to the vet ASAP, especially if they're a fat cat."
