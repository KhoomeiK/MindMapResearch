Advice,fctshya,t3_eivhix,1577957189.0,"There is no secret to getting self discipline. Motivation has to come from within, you will never work hard towards getting good marks if the only reason you are doing it is because your parents want you too and you want to be like your friends !

So find something deeper that motivates you. For me the initial reason I started working hard in life was to prove to the kids who bullied me that they couldn't stop me and that I was better than them at something. Now I am more mature and I do it because I genuinely believe getting good marks at university is important to getting my dream job and the life I want for myself."
Advice,fctrmld,t1_fctq7at,1577955911.0,"Yep I agree with the guy above, a lot of women love squats but make sure to try and train your whole body using composite excersises. Start light and try to find someone (either online or in person) that can train you on safe technique. What you eat is the most important part ! It's still important to remember that its very difficult to put on muscle unless you have a calorfic surplus, you can find calculators for this online. Lots of protein is also essential so eating things like nuts, eggs, meat and beans are great . I've also got a fast metabolism - protein shakes are a really effective way for me to get enough calories to put on weight because they are easy to get down. 

More importantly, if you have severe body image issues try to seek therapy. As a man I can say that guys literally find so many body types attractive, as long as you arnt unhealthily skinny or morbidly obese I really dont think the way your body looks is worth worrying very much about."
Advice,fctr6ne,t3_eivobh,1577955273.0,"What's more important to you, a intimate relationship with her or your friendship ?

I had a crush on a really close family friend for years but knew the relationship could never work.

If you are happy with just a friendship I think the best way to get over her is start dating or hanging out with someone new. I always find excersise and going out with (other) friends as the best ways to get my mind of something or someone. This may sound kinda fucked but until you think you are over it I wouldn't hang out with her as much because that just brings back the feelings and pain.

If you are only in the friendship because you are hoping it leads to a relationship then I say you just keep trying, I mean she might never come around but in this scenario it's worth a try.

At this point I am completely over the girl, and we are still just as close friends so it is possible to get over someone."
depression,fco9s5w,t3_ei6wkl,1577827003.0,"Dude I completely feel the same way especially with respect to how things seeem to come naturally to others. I know I'm an asshole for being jealous but it's just so annoying when I see people who appear to float through life without trying but they have everything I ever wanted. Meanwhile it's a constant battle for me, i spend almost every hour of every day doing things that i think will make me more likeable or interesting and i have nothing meaningful to show for it.

This also makes me feel weak and pathetic. I'll be in the middle of a conversation with people and just realise that I am useless and feel like a fucking child. I hear stories that people tell me about their lives and realise that I have done nothing notable and maybe never will. The most annoying thing for me is  I know for me my depression isn't about a chemical imbalance in my brain. I know that by default I am meant to be a happy person but I am so shit at life, I fuck up so often in so many way that I have made myself miserable."
depression,fco6gr9,t1_fcnwh5t,1577824988.0,Haha it's funny to imagine someone stunned by their own positive emotions. I hope you get to a point where feeling like that is much more commonplace !
depression,fco5nmv,t3_ei6jh8,1577824550.0,"Being alone one night is nice and I don't think anyone has a problem with it. The problem is being alone your whole fucking life. I would genuinely hack saw my legs off for a partner in life even if our relationship did involve fighting. Fuck, I would do anything in the world to feel someone genuinely love all of me for just one day."
depression,fco4vig,t1_fcnqr2a,1577824123.0,"Haha spot on. Some people - most people infact, are capable of actually enjoying their lives and building real relationships with people. Unfortunately I'm stuck here watching from the outside wondering how things work out naturally for them whilst I spend every second of my life working on myself to just feel like that for a fucking day but instead feel like I am just getting repeatedly fucked in the ass by life."
depression,fcnxxt9,t1_fcmwhtm,1577820604.0,"I spent it physically with other people but alone inside, pretending I'm having fun while internally wondering why the fuck I am so different to everyone around me who is able to enjoy themselves. Feels great when new years rolls around and everyone around you is calling loved ones and receiving calls and you realise no one gives a fuck about you because you are pathetic or you pushed them away. Also feels great to have a reminder that a whole another year has gone by and you have achieved nothing other than watch your few remaining relationships atrophy into nothingness and your health slowly deteriorate."
Advice,fcldco8,t1_fcld4aw,1577745185.0,"I am pretty confident she will say yes based on past interactions and the fact that she is the one that set it up.

Thing is if she doesnt like me I dont really want to go on a date with her haha."
Advice,fclc2rs,t1_fclarus,1577744368.0,"We were meant to have a date next week, should I just not bring it up unless she does ?"
Advice,fclbtal,t1_fclawvc,1577744199.0,Funny thing I didn't ask her but she did address it (She said that she is just like that).
