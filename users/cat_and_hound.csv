dogs,fezy9ru,t3_eqwncc,1579463181.0,"Flyball finished up today. I really love the team and would have had a lot more fun if I hadn't felt so far behind everyone else. This was the first time I ever thought of Baron as dumb before, which I also feel terrible about. Every class I felt like the absolute most garbage trainer with the worst dog. I would get so discouraged every single class because he was just so far behind all the other dogs. I didn't find out until a few weeks in that all the other dogs had either already gone through agility training or were owned by a professional trainer. Still, my confidence is really shaken after this. I wish I'd had more fun, but I do want to do the next level of class when it starts up in a couple months. I just hope we're less embarassingly bad this time around."
dogs,fezwiot,t3_eqohkm,1579462576.0,"Baron dug a used condom out of the trash then pooped it out at daycare.

Oh, also, when I was a teenager being left alone for the first time when my parents went on a 3-4 week long overseas trip, my old beagle Carmen got into the kitchen cabinets and ate an entire bucket of twizzlers as I slept. I woke up to bright red vomit all over the kitchen. I had no idea what was going on and thought that she was vomiting blood. Not knowing what to do, I frantically texted and emailed my parents that Carmen was vomiting blood. It wasn't until after the whole family got into a panic that I found the empty twizzlers bucket in the next room and pieced together what had happened. 

Years earlier, this dog also ate a huge box of dark chocolate covered orange gummies and vomited all over my bedroom carpet, causing us to have to rip up the carpet. Somehow she lived to the ripe old age of 16."

dogs,fe96jwh,t3_eo3sk2,1578934830.0,"I got my puppy from the shelter for about $500 after adding in all the fees and taxes. Got my kitten from that same shelter for $120. Both came fixed with all their shots, a few months of free pet insurance, chipped, and with a nice take home package. Adult animals are significantly cheaper from that shelter, and sometimes they have free adoption events. My parents got their little chihuahua from there for about $200 when he was around 4 years old.

The county pound here seems to have adoption fees ranging from $0-$50. Not sure what is included with that fee though. The greyhound rescue I was going to go with before finding my puppy had an adoption fee ranging from $350 to $400."
dogs,fe42nq2,t1_fe34qzt,1578855162.0,"It's just really discouraging that he's the only dog in our Flyball class who can't be off leash. I keep thinking back to what that SAR evaluator told me when he got away from me and wouldn't come back during our evaluation. She said, ""At a year old he should have perfect recall"". I feel so far behind and like such a crappy trainer compared to all these other dogs I see."
dogs,fe42csl,t1_fe3w68m,1578855059.0,"He just turned one. Honestly, hearing your experience is really encouraging. It's super discouraging when every time he sees a cat he scrambles and tries to lunge for it, and that he's the only dog in our Flyball class that doesn't have good recall and needs to stay on the long line. His recall is decent enough that it works at the dog park and in low distraction areas, but it's worthless at Flyball practice, for example. And if he's on leash and I'm constantly engaging with him around the cats I live with, he's generally fine. But we can't walk through the house with him nearly pulling me off my feet and seriously causing me pain every single time because he's constantly scrambling. Loose leash walking in stores and public is fine though. Inside the house it's utter crap.

I hope Baron turns out like your dog!"
dogs,fe2yhwt,t3_ennwwt,1578844249.0,"Practiced some recall at the field where Flyball practice is. I really should have brought something higher value because Baron is so obsessed with the cats at that field. It's really frustrating and gives me a lot of anxiety considering how slow my progress has been towards getting him to stop chasing my cat. I don't think he'll ever be able to be off leash, which means I can never compete with him in anything. And that would be liveable if he could just be safe around my cat, but even that looks bleak."
Equestrian,fdweavt,t3_en0kp1,1578757812.0,"Not at all. I'm a total noob and have been riding just shy of a year now. I'm about your age. 

Be sure to find the right barn to ride at. My first one was really mean. Even though I had made it very clear to them that I had never ridden before and was a total beginner, they got really mad at me whenever I took too long to pick up a skill. They tried to make me lope starting my second week, and every time I acted scared or almost fell off they yelled at me. 

After about six weeks I left that barn and joined the one I'm at now. They are really great here. No one has mentioned my age or made me feel bad for not knowing as much as an 8 year old who has been riding since she was 2. It's been maybe 8 months and they still haven't made me lope yet, which is great because my experience at the first barn caused me to panic real bad at even a fast trot. Most of the people here are also either teenagers or adults, so not being around small children who are somehow expert riders also helps me mentally."

dogs,fdr9jpg,t3_emreuz,1578681376.0,"My quest to develop the perfect homemade training treat continues. Last week I dehydrated canned tuna. What it produced was great, but there is so much liquid in canned tuna that what it produced was minuscule compared to what I spent on the cans and how long it took to dehydrate. This week I'm trying chicken tenders and chicken breast. Got a few pounds for under $10, so this is looking to be potentially more cost effective.

Going to try to take Baron out today for a mini Mommy and Me day and focus a lot on recall. He's gotten a lot better with it, but I'm still pretty embarrassed at Flyball where he's pretty much the only dog on a long line. Part of it is me failing to work enough at that when I first got him, part was me just not knowing how to work on it, and the other part is that I'm so incredibly paranoid of him getting hit by a car that even if he had perfect recall I would still be scared to let him off leash. 

Also, I'm so happy because my brother and my sister in law got me a Petco giftcard last night. I immediately ordered two puzzle toys and an indoor agility set. Got more than $100 worth of stuff for about $20 by combining the gift card, sales, and coupons."

This week has been absolutely insane for me, but for once it's actually \*good\* insane. I'm really hoping by the end of the month life will slow down a bit and I can focus more on Baron again. Ever since mid-December things have just been so intense. In the last week I've had five job interviews, accidentally started a big HR investigation into my really mean boss, gotten in contact with some fancy pants connections of mine, coordinating moving into a new place while helping a friend move, and have been wrapping up grad school apps. I'm trying really hard to keep up at least one training session and walk a day with Baron through all this.

\-Tarte Amazonian Clay mascara: I've been a die hard user of Better Than Sex since 2017, but this may have converted that me. This is light weight and doesn't seem to clump my lashes, but it gives them a lot of length and lift. I'm not into super heavy makeup looks and I think lighter makeup looks better on my fair complexion, so this is pretty great.

\-Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar moisturizer: This soaked in so nicely and my skin has a noticeably better texture today. 

&#x200B;

\-Akar pure lip restoration: This is close to my favorite item in the box. It soaks in so fast and has already made my lips really, really soft. The taste isn't super great but it's not strong either.

&#x200B;

\-Vitabrid C Dual Drop Serum: I was looking for a vitamin C serum exactly like this, so this came just in time. My skin is pretty soft after one use, but of course there's no super noticeable difference. I will say the consistency is very gel like, and it's going to be a challenge figuring out exactly how much to use on my face each night.

&#x200B;

\-Kate Sommerville Exfolikate: Holy cow, this stuff is pricey. Used it last night and so far so good. Will use this as a mask once or twice a week until it runs out. I really love the smell of it. It smells like herbs my mom uses a lot when cooking.

&#x200B;

\-Nature Lab Tokyo Perfect Shine Oil Mist: I've been wanting to try something from this brand for a couple years now, so that already makes it my favorite item in the box. Most hair sprays promise ""mirror like shine"" but they've never delivered for me. My hair is naturally coarse, thick, and wavy, so it's very, very hard to make it shine. Even at its healthiest, my hair is just plain dull. This stuff comes through though. Not only does it smell great, my hair is truly shiny right now without looking greasy. I'm so happy with this and may just make it a permanent part of my haircare lineup."

With being sick, the holidays, and having another wave of depression hit all at once it's been really hard to keep up with training. In any case, he'll really enjoy being out and doing something with me. I think these last couple weeks had him bored out of his mind.

Friday we went on a four mile hike, and yesterday we did some training at Petsmart then went to the dog park for a bit. Training at Petsmart went really well considering we haven't done any public training in a couple weeks. His loose leash walking is actually way better in stores than it is around my neighborhood. He did start barking at this other dog who had been staring him down, but as soon as we walked away he calmed down and recovered."

dogs,fcncnn1,t3_ei3g81,1577808846.0,"I started off this decade with my old, family beagle Carmen and volunteering at the local animal shelter. I was such an animal lover but I knew absolutely nothing about actually owning and training dogs. I wasn't a great owner, despite being a well intentioned one. I spent far, far less time with Carmen than I should have. Then midway through the decade a bunch of things happened and I lost Carmen in a really traumatic way. I wasn't there for her when she died.

During that time I was living with some friends from undergrad whose dog made me hate dogs. It was terrifying. My adrenaline still kicks in when I see dogs that look like it. 

Then I got Baron, and he's marked the beginning of a whole new chapter with dogs. I'm more mature and knowledgeable now. He's not a scary dog. He's the perfect starter dog because he's so incredibly willing to please and learn. What happened with Carmen motivates me to do better for Baron and never let those same mistakes happen again. 

So the decade's kind of gone full circle. Went from a huge dog lover who was a crappy owner, to both hating dogs and not owning one, and now to being a pretty good owner and healing my perspective on dogs. 

All in all, this decade has been a really, really wild ride and I only hope that this coming one is calmer. I just want to work on reaching my educational, financial, emotional, and career goals while exploring the dog world with Baron. I want to get as many titles as possible with him and check out as many dog sports as possible. He's my All Terrain Dog, and I really want to take advantage of that. At some point during this next decade I'll probably take in another puppy, but for now I'm just trying to focus on the dog I have right now."

Still can't take full breaths but I can at least sleep through the night. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get back to training with Baron! Just need to restock on training treats.

My parents got Baron a huuuuuge crate. I'm so happy about it. He outgrew his original one and it was too small for him to fully stand up or lay down. So he had to sleep outside it because I didn't want to make him that cramped, which meant Castiel couldn't sleep in my room at night and sleeping with me is her absolute favorite thing in the whole wide world. But now all is well because Baron has a massive crate that with more than enough room to move around in, so he can spend the night in it and Castiel gets to sleep with me again. 

But other than that things have been super boring for the last week or so. Baron's handling it well but he clearly really misses training."

All she wants is to just nap on my lap and purr. 

Baron is great when I'm not severely depressed but at most ""regular"" depressed. He makes me get up and do things, forces me to have more energy, and gives me motivation to improve my life. But when I was severely depressed it was so, so hard to have a dog."
dogs,fckr2tl,t3_eho07v,1577731357.0,"Kind of? Yes and no. 

When I got Baron I was at a pretty high point, and then everything came crashing down in the month and a half after bringing him home. I got extremely sick and the sense of losing control of my body, combined with an extremely toxic and abusive working environment caused my untreated PTSD to flare up bad. That and the fucked up hormones that came as a part of my sickness drowned me in paranoia, auditory hallucinations, intense anger, suicidal depression, constant exhaustion, and random crying spells. 

On one hand, raising a puppy alone in an apartment as a first time dog owner made it all so much worse. When I could barely stand and was scared to go outside, I had to force myself to do so because Baron's tummy was hurting yet again for the 10th time that day and he'd already had diarrhea all over the carpet. When my boss pulled out on his promise of a full time, very well paying position because he had been stringing me along for months and suddenly I was sick and no longer capable of the 60 hour weeks (40 of which were unpaid) he was making me pull, Baron became a bottomless money drain. I obsessed over every mistake I was making with him and would often just sit down on the sidewalk on walks and sob because I was just so damn angry at him. 

On the other hand, he's the reason I couldn't justify going through with my plans to kill myself. Every plan that would actually work would require him being locked in his crate for at least a day or two, or me setting him lose, or returning him to the shelter, or any manner of horrible things I simply couldn't do to an animal. I was the only one in my life who knew enough about dogs and knew Baron well enough to give him the life he deserves. He needed me alive. Baron gave me something to take my mind off of everything, and I was able to obsess over training him and learning about dogs. That gave me relief from my situation, at least temporarily. When my mom made me finally see a therapist and my mental state became just stable enough, Baron began giving me reason to do more than just survive. I want to give him a happy life, and that means finally getting help for my PTSD and working to get the life I want. I often felt like Baron was the one thing in my life I wasn't screwing up, that he and my cat Castiel were the only living things that really wanted me and were proud of me. 

Now that I've been working with my therapist for a few months, Baron's presence in my life brings me almost nothing but joy. He's like my child and it's hard to imagine I was ever so sick to feel the intense anger towards him that I felt this summer. I'm glad I got him. I only wish I'd been a better human for him during our first few months together. I tried my best but I wish my best had been better. I feel a lot of guilt for how broken I was during that time."

dogs,fc9xnkp,t1_fc91auq,1577559737.0,"If you're in the Phoenix area go to South Mountain park. It has so many hiking trails. Dog needs to be on leash because 1) it's the rules and 2) we have lots of coyotes there. Tempe Marketplace is a nice outdoor mall that you can take your dog to. Also heard Scottsdale Mall is dog friendly but I've yet to take Baron there.

Be careful hiking into the Grand Canyon this time of year. Fall is the safest time to hike it, but in Winter snow and ice sometimes freezes in such a way that it looks like part of the trail but is actually overhanging off the trail and over the edge. Some hikers over the years have had bad accidents because of that. But staying on the rim is perfectly safe and there is a lot to see. I like the rim better anyway because that's where all the nice pine trees are. 

Flagstaff is very dog friendly, much more than Phoenix. It's a crappy city to drive in though, and since us Arizonians aren't very accustomed to snow (and there is heavy snow there right now), be prepared for bad traffic and delays. There is a great dog friendly ramen place there though that has really, really good bao buns and carnitas ramen. You can also check out the observatory if the roads to it are open. Elden Peak is a great hike too.

Wherever you hike here, be careful of flash floods. It's not really the season for that now, but I was raised to always be cognizant of where I'm at during the rainy times. We just had a bad accident a few weeks ago where a family of hikers got swept away and most of them died. So don't spend a long time in washes or narrow canyons. It's not like, a common thing, but just good to be aware of if it's not a thing that's normally on your radar.

Also water. However much water you normally drink, try to double it. Every out of stater gets really dehydrated when they first come here."
dogs,fc9wcrg,t3_egr4ld,1577559162.0,"I haven't been able to really exercise Baron since Thursday, so I spent a few minutes out with the flirt pole with him today. He had a lot of fun with that, even if it got me wheezing. At least a mix of that and playing tug with him for a few minutes at a time will be better than nothing.

At least we have Flyball tomorrow, though with how this week's gone we haven't been able to do much practicing."
Dogtraining,fc6ufq7,t3_egil21,1577489782.0,"So, as ashamed as I am, I'll be the first to admit I hit my puppy twice. Both times he'd been relentlessly chasing my cat, and I can think of a million other reasons why I hit that breaking point but in the end I did. I gave him a single slap once on his butt the first time and right on his face the last time. I cried for hours after each one. I really, really don't like admitting it.

It would be hypocritical of me to outright condemn someone else for hitting their breaking point too. You obviously feel bad about it or you wouldn't be posting. \*But\* this is also really unacceptable and wrong. You hit the puppy in its face over and over and over again. Any hitting at all is wrong, but slapping it over and over again in the face is excessive. And it doesn't sound like this was only a one time thing. It sounds like this is a regular occurrence. That tells me that there is \*a lot\* of pent up anger towards this dog that you're releasing onto him and you don't yet have the tools to unleash that anger in safer ways.

Whether or not this puppy gets rehomed sounds up to your parents, and there's only so much you can do to control that. What you can control, however, is your anger. I get you jhate this puppy. I get that it is an annoying little shit that you never asked for. But you are the human in this relationship and therefore the responsibility is on you to handle the situation correctly. Start by getting up and leaving the room. Close the door so the puppy can't follow you. Remove yourself from the situation if the puppy is being so annoying you can't contain yourself, then go hit something inanimate. 

Remember that in the moment when you've raised your hand, you have tunnel vision, and you're about to strike that puppy that you have a choice. Whether you choose to hit that puppy or walk away is completely in your power. So make the right choice."

dogs,fc6pmd7,t3_egblk9,1577486294.0,"So I'm pretty close to getting pneumonia. Doctor says she can't hear my right lung at all and that if my symptoms get any worse I need to get my butt to the hospital. All I can think about is how much this sucks for Baron. Pretty much since Monday I can hardly walk without getting winded and wheezing, so it's been really hard to do anything with him. I've just been trying to sit near him and read so he can at least feel somewhat involved. The good news is that he's not getting too crazy with this lack of exercise and training this week.

On another note, I got his breed results from Embark back last week and just upgraded to get his health and traits report today because the upgrade was 50% off. I'd been planning on making this its own post but I can't get the energy to focus right now. I'll try to do that this weekend. [But here are his results for anyone interested.](http://embk.me/baronhumbertvongikkingen?utm_campaign=cns_ref_dog_pub_profile&utm_medium=other&utm_source=embark) Embark found a ton of German Shepherd first cousins and one potential mix breed half sibling.

The GSD cousins seem to come from the same breeder and lots of them have bite work titles. Knowing that kind of explains some of Baron's traits to me, like his really high drive. I'm wondering if, once his obedience is waaaayyyy better, some form of bitework might be worth trying considering his lineage? I'll have to think about it a lot more and learn a lot more first, but I've been toying with the idea since I adopted him. No clue if this is even possible to get into if you haven't been training the dog for it from puppyhood, or if I'd mesh well with the culture. Eh, who knows. I'm kind of rambling at this point."
dogs,fc6oxe6,t3_egagg0,1577485802.0,"We got our Intermediate Trick Dog title, started Flyball, began upping our cardio game, and improved our recall dramatically! 

This month has probably been my worst when it comes to training. I've been out of commission sick pretty much every week of December and now it looks like I'm on the verge of pneumonia. Doctor says if it gets worse then it's off to the hospital for me. Somehow though, Baron seems happy and he's not gotten too crazy. I'm also really proud of that. I've been worried about how he'd do if the time came when I wouldn't be able to keep up with our multiple, long training sessions every day. Well, looks like that time is here and he's doing pretty well. So I'll count that as a brag too."
dogs,fc6o6td,t1_fc5uu1a,1577485273.0,"Yeah, this I can understand. The shelters may be overflowing, but if you don't want a pitbull, have an existing pet or small child, and live in an apartment then the number of potential adoptable dogs plummets."
dogs,fc6o3na,t3_egdlot,1577485212.0,"I commented earlier on how I hate the phrase, ""If you can't afford xxxxx, you can't afford a dog"", but complaining about a $50 adoption fee is just ridiculous and selfish. Do these people not understand that the shelters have bills too? Do they think shelters pay those bills with puppy love and doggy kisses? 

Seems people are willing to scream ""adopt don't shop"", but when the time comes to pony up and pay a small adoption fee, the shelters are suddenly the bad guys.

For what it's worth, Baron's adoption fee was around $500 and worth every penny."
dogs,fc6365j,t3_egbn40,1577471223.0,"I really hate this phrase. I definitely think it applies to some things, like basic healthcare, food, shelter, and vaccines. But I've seen it applied to stuff like $10,000 surgeries, daycare and dog walkers multiple times a week, training classes, etc. I think that's ridiculous.

There's the ideal and then there's reality. The reality is that the majority of us can not afford the ideal. But as long as the dog's basic needs are being met and there is good faith effort in giving the dog the best life possible, it's not anyone's place to judge. Dogs aren't just for the rich."

Gah. The insistence on using alternative medicine is a huge sore spot for me. My parents became anti-vaxxers and super dedicated to alternative medicine when I was in high school, and this was after a whole childhood of me being extremely ill with blood poisoning and pneumonia multiple times. Modern medicine saved me. Yet for some reason my parents now insist on colloidal silver and herbs to solve every remedy. They're well meaning and really believe they're doing what's right, but it's just so incredibly frustrating."
dogs,fc0l3ta,t3_efgvlc,1577293464.0,"I've got a bad cough going on and it's pouring, but I'm trying to make the most out of my days off work to spend a lot of time with Baron. We've been going on a lot of long walks, doing sprinting exercises, and whatever else I'm able to do without my lungs dying.

It seems we have a weird neighbor and I'm kinda stressed about it, but also just confused. She sent in a noise complaint to the city and we got a warning saying our barking dog is disturbing the peace. My parent's dog Dino hasn't barked in years. The culprit has to be Baron, but he may only bark once every few days or when the play between him and Dino gets too wild. The only noise he makes regularly or multiple times a day are these little yips when he's outside and wants in, but they're really soft. He also never makes noise between traditional ""quiet"" hours of 8:00 pm to about 9:00 am. We all have half acre backyards surrounded by tall bushes and big, nice houses with thick walls. It's hard for any noise to travel from one house to another. Our closest neighbor has three huge rottweilers who bark \*a lot\*, but even that is hard to hear when you're inside.

My parents \*hate\* dogs and barking, but they were baffled that someone would complain about Baron. They're home a lot more than I am too, and Baron is usually only alone for a couple hours at a time, so if he were barking up a storm someone would have heard. They have extremely low tolerance for barking and they weren't bothered by the noise he makes at all. We went and spoke to all five of our surrounding neighbors. Only one, the lady who reported us, had anything to complain about. The others, including the weird lady's husband, were just as confused as we were.

We're going to set up cameras in the backyard (we already have cameras in the house and front yard), both to gather evidence to show that Baron isn't barking excessively back there and in case that weird neighbor tries anything. We're hoping that having talked to her really nicely and getting that face time in will calm her down, and that she'll be nicer after the holidays are over."

I spent most of my childhood reading and the few people I talked to (outside immediate family, who have Midwest twangs) had very thick Eastern European or Greek accents. So I ended up saying most words in my head, and if I ever heard them out loud they came out in a hodge podge of accents.

It turned me off a lot of breeders because, not knowing much about how to identify good breeders, it seemed logical to me that sketchy breeders would have sketchy webpages. To me, a bad webpage was a sign of a breeder just not giving a shit, and sometimes they were so out of date I wondered if the breeder was even still active. On the other hand, I saw sleek, nice looking pages and assumed that those people really knew what they were doing and cared, even though those pages were usually run by (what I know realize were) puppy mills."

The biggest con would be that sometimes the box isn't curated super well, and there have been some items I'm just not thrilled about or that end up as clutter."
puppy101,fbwje8w,t1_fbwdjdy,1577151496.0,"I thought this too when I first brought home my puppy, but it's actually kind of counter intuitive. You'd think a dog would stop when they're exhausted, and some dogs will, but many dogs and especially young puppies don't know when to stop. They just keep going and going and going, kind of like young kids. 

It's also dangerous for young puppies to have too much exercise because their joints aren't really set yet. They're all wobbly and the stuff fusing the joints is kind of like jello (so unscientific, I know, but there are actual terms for this stuff). Too much exercise, especially sustained high impact exercise such as running or jumping, can permanently damage their joints and growth plates."
