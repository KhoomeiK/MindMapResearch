UXDesign,ffbdlv4,t1_ff9le9f,1579760836.0,"You confirmed what I would have suspected. Thank you. 

In Apple's app, I often take a few seconds to remember what Dark Mode's icon looks like. Same for Low Power Mode and a few more. I think our muscle memory is based more on position rather than icon design.

The biggest problem I face is that it is a nightmare to guide someone technologically-challenged over the phone. I then have to resort to describing what the icon looks like. With a label, I would have had it easy!"
UXDesign,ff8c3w9,t1_ff5iq7m,1579672500.0,"Thank you for the reply. 

Regarding labels for icons, isn't that going away in general in all apps? I make apps and I too find it extremely difficult to predict what will happen if I click on something in multiple apps. Even Apple's own apps have that a lot. Control Center in iPhones have that. Sometimes it takes me a few seconds to remember what the icon (of what I am looking for) looks like, but with accompanying labels I would have found it very quickly. What do you think about that?"
theXeffect,ff8buz8,t1_ff66sad,1579672248.0,"Regarding sleep, I know there are a whole bunch of people saying that ""sleep less, work more"" but they are also the millionaires or wannabe millionaires, who don't really do what they preach. On the other hand, there are repeated studies that talk about the effects of impairments in cognitive abilities if sleep deprived. Here's one such study which compared sleep deprived people with drunk people:

> In one study, researchers found that subjects who slept just six hours a night for 14 days had the cognitive wherewithal of someone with a .1% blood alcohol level. That’s legally drunk.

Here's the video that discusses the study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVQlcxiQlzI

About the bullet journal, I too vastly prefer digital over analog. But the very fact that you will not be tempted to open another app or respond to a notification on your device, and focus entirely on your planing, is what makes the difference. I hate having to carry an extra thing all the time, but it seems to be worth it. Those who have been using this for some time, say that it has made a big difference.

Yes, I agree, Cal Newport makes some pretty compelling arguments about getting more productive."
UXDesign,ff5c3bv,t1_ff47vlp,1579586827.0,I am new to UX. Could you point out the things you are referring to? What's broken?
theXeffect,ff5bdsp,t3_erdcp0,1579586102.0,"An excellent idea to take up x effect.

If you are trying to power through your day with just 6 hours of sleep everyday, I think you are extremely likely to fail though. Even if the first few days feel easy, I guarantee you that 8 hours is much better than 6.

You can be more strict with social media though. 3 times a day is not really necessary for the average person. Also set not just start times but strict end times. Like a timer every time your social time starts. It helps to not have the phone in your visual line. Try to keep it in another room. If that's not possible, try to keep it out of sight, like in a drawer or anywhere behind your chair (if you work on a table/chair).

For the third, instead consider a bullet journal. It will help you plan a day. Ivy Lee's suggestion of listing the 6 most important tasks that need to be done in each day is stellar. Keep it simple, and you will automatically be able to see what is getting done, and is repeatedly getting postponed. 

Keep a Failure notes beside each day in the journal, where you will have to say why you didn't do what you didn't that day. At the end of the week, you will know what went wrong, and within weeks you will be much more productive. And with time, that Failure notes section will get shorter and shorter, till every thing gets done almost every day. You gotta set realistic tasks though for this to work. If what you can't actually do in 4 hours is set for an hour, you will obviously fail.

I learnt about this recently from a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bxIg3M_MHY

getdisciplined,fecsbul,t3_enk8il,1578982739.0,"Thank you for this writeup. It made me realise a lot of my mistakes. I often tend to do things in 2-3x the amount of time. Call it the perils of being self-employed (and thus not having any deadlines whatsoever).

And this perfectionism has creeped into every aspect of my life. Recently a friend casually said that I have OCD. That got me thinking and I realised maybe that's true. I tend to keep things in fixed places and get bothered a lot if they are not in those places. (On the plus side, I hardly ever have to look for anything, and can do a lot of tasks on auto-pilot)."
AppleWatch,fdmknbh,t3_em548d,1578553465.0,"I thinkI read somewhere that it depends on your usual Exercise heart rate. SO if it is usually pretty high and then you do a workout where it is much lower, then it might not cross your threshold. While if a sedentary person were to walk at the same pace, it would register fully.

Just for reference: I use Outdoor Walk all the time. Never had a problem. My pace is around 9-10 min/km on most days."

bodyweightfitness,fdghkp8,t3_el7evo,1578397107.0,"I have read the FAQ and the emphasis on 3x per week part. Personally I find it easier to stick to something when I am doing it regularly. 

I hear from my gym-going friends that they have arm day and leg day and so forth. I was wondering if there is any way I can split each day's exercises into 2 days so I can workout 6x per week (for a shorter duration), while ensuring that the worked out muscle groups are getting the rest needed?"

I will watch the Mark Bowden video. Although far more benefit can be derived by simply implementing the advice you already posted."
