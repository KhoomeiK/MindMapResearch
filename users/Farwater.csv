PrequelMemes,feoqiph,t1_fened9g,1579304003.0,"I agree and I think a major issue is the fact that, for me, the prequels ruined Vader. When I was introduced to him as a kid, he was just this tough, shadowy bad ass who helped rule the empire. I knew he used to be a Jedi and was also somehow Luke's father, which gave him this big mystery factor that set my imagination wild. His redemption at the end of the trilogy was so *awesome* to me and made him appear like this layered, complicated, conflicted man.

Then the Prequels came out. Anakin was a cringy kid (who somehow built C3PO?), a whiny teen complaining about ""sand"", and his turn to the dark side was just... *boring*.

It totally killed the mystique of Vader for me and shrunk him down in a way that I can't even describe. My imagination for him was way more exciting than what the prequels delivered.

For people who grew up with the prequels, they'll never know that disappointment. They'll always think of Anakin as just what the Prequels depicted and not get what my problem is.

I consider the sequel trilogy quite a bit of a let down as well, but it doesn't *ruin* anything for me in the same way. And the general feel of the movies is something I really enjoyed. They are well-crafted, cinematically speaking, so I can see myself rewatching them for years to come."

So understandably, what she's done is simply confirm that she believes the reports are basically true, without quoting his exact words.

Paganacht,fe291vj,t1_fe24y26,1578835811.0,"Keep in mind that *Iceland* converted far later than Britain did. Britain was a part of Rome before the empire converted to Christianity. Nearly as soon as it did, Britain began converting too. Iceland wasn't converted until maybe 600 or 700 years later."
Paganacht,fe27ihj,t3_enmxo1,1578835303.0,"Linguistically, we can establish links such as Lleu < Lugus, Mabon < Maponos, Modron < Matronā, and Rhiannon < \*Rīgantonā. So it's essentially a scientific fact that the names of certain Mabinogi figures equate with theonyms from the archaeological record (with the exception of \*Rīgantonā, which is a reconstruction that matches the general form of a Celtic theonym).

*Nudd Llaw Ereint* would appear to be a clear reflex of Irish *Nuadu*, on account of the similarity of their names and characters. *Nudd* can also derive from \*Nowdonts by regular sound rules. So I would consider that to be quite persuasive, rather than a ""tenuous"" link.

Of course, we need to keep in mind that these tales were written well into the Christian era. They are no longer pagan mythic lore, although they clearly are derivative of it. The Mabinogi are Medieval Christian fairy tales, essentially, that are rooted enough in the old oral tradition for us to find a few key links to the pagan past. Luckily, some nuggets of the original myths survived; but unfortunately, much of it was edited or just naturally evolved away from its original purpose."

Paganacht,fds5q8h,t3_emsicr,1578694953.0,"The first thing I would say is that it's a mistake to think in terms of cut-and-dried pantheons. The second, is that it's a mistake to map modern nationalities onto people from antiquity, who didn't have such concepts (there were several tribes in Ireland who each would have had their own identities). The third is that besides an array of different regions, you are comparing totally different time periods, both of which have *very* incomplete records to draw from.

Basically, the kind of comparison you're trying to make is fraught with complications.

It's important to understand that while ""Celts"" had certain linguistic and cultural characteristics in common, they were anything but a homogeneous group. ""Continental Celts"" alone refers to several subfamilies and probably dozens of tribes all over Western Europe, and some who even reached as far East as Anatolia.

Furthermore, these can't be divvied up into clearly separated categories, because there was plenty of movement and interaction amongst them. There were Belgic tribes who held territory in Britain and possibly even Ireland, for example.

While there are several deities who had widespread cults, the majority of theonyms seem to have been regional or local. There are some ""Irish"" gods who may have cognates with ""continental"" gods, or at least similar characteristics. For example, war and sovereignty goddesses, riparian goddesses, a rustic fatherly god who wields a giant mallet, etc. But in other instances, you'll be hard pressed to find a close match. You can find a healing goddess in Ðironâ, for example, but She is not specifically connected to herbalism in the way that Airmed is. And of course, no one seems to compare to a deity like Cernunnos.

But there is an incongruity in the Irish and continental evidences that further makes apples-to-apples comparisons difficult. Besides all the things I mentioned earlier, you also have to consider that one source is largely tales recorded by Medieval monks while the other is votive inscriptions and curse tablets from antiquity. These are dramatically different contexts with unequal levels of detail, from dramatically different periods in history."

IndoEuropean,fdhkzj3,t1_fdhhf9b,1578424870.0,"I think part of the disconnect here is that you seem to be comparing two different time periods.

For example, Koch and Schrijver agree that Brittonic underwent the same phase that Gaulish did with the PCl. *gʷ* > *w* sound change. Only later did Brittonic undergo *w* > *gw*.

At the time that the *uediiumi* inscription was written, it is safe to assume it would have been more-or-less the same in Brittonic.

That Brittonic translation of the Alesia transcription must be a modern person's effort and thus not historical evidence."
