My middle daughter was almost 2 and learning to potty train. She was getting some ""fresh air time"" walking around nakie butt and started to poop right on the living room carpet. 

Hard solid poop. No biggie. Mama scoops her up and hurries her to the potty. She finished up there and got praised and cleaned up. I go to get the initial accidental poop, and its gone....

I look at my little dog and he looks guilty as sin and full of regret. He always sits waiting for them to drop food, and he looks like he'd just made a horrible mistake.

Fast forward 10 minutes to the dog throwing up my child's shit in the same spot where he found it. It smelled so bad that everyone cleared the room except for me. We all knew this one was on me.

He averaged 12 kills a game, but only 1655 average damage. Meaning he isnt double killing each person, but rather knocking and moving on with the rest of the squad. 

That head shot % is high, but I would say that it isnt impossible either. Especially for a player who is in a much lower tier than they should be. 181 games is low for a serious player at this point in the season. Mine is 34% and I'm definitely not this caliber of killer.

His accuracy is low, but that could be made lower by sending rounds to the moon.

Win ratio is super high which again tells me this person is much lower than they should be and playing against inferior competition. 

All I'm saying is the only issue with this is the headshot%. But even that *could* be explained. The big numbers dont mean shit."

HomeImprovement,fcsgya2,t1_fcsdx2g,1577916382.0,"Without knowing your duct layout I thought this would be the least likely possibility. Normally supply duct runs start with a main trunk line and have all of the smaller round pipe runs coming off of it and then running the distance to where they terminate.

 If you're hearing noise from the supply grills it could either be you're lucky in that you have square duct running much further than normal which would provide better air flow in general, or multiple terminations come from the same initial tap off of the trunk.

Are you getting sound through the grills where the air is coming out, or from the large grills on the walls for the return? 

If it's the supply air, the best option would be something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/hKAIJuf.jpg), where noise would be disrupted. Most likely your round pipe is 6"" diameter, and those are about 21"" long in total. If you can get those in anywhere they would help quite a bit.

If it's the large wall mounted return grills, I would check to see if the adjacent room has the return grill directly on the opposite side. A lot of times they're put in low and use the same stud space in the wall, which leads to basically a hole in the wall connecting rooms. If this is the case, you could move one grill up higher to offset that, with minimal disruption to return air function. 

Any specifics you provide would help greatly in determining a solution."
HomeImprovement,fcrq73w,t3_eiix5h,1577905147.0,"It depends on what noise you're trying to get rid of. 

If its noise from expanding duct, like popping and pinging, that needs insulation on the duct. That's coming from expansion and contraction of the ductwork from the conditioned air. Someone here posted about using ductboard, but that's unnecessary and not helpful. Most of your duct is going to be light gauge round pipe, and that just needs duct blanket style insulation. 
The difficulty with this is accessing the duct in ceilings of floors. 

If its room to room noise or noise from the fan of the furnace/AC, that's more difficult. The noise is traveling through the duct, not caused by it. Commercially we use lined duct to fix this issue. It's a layer of insulation inside the duct that is specifically to catch noise. You can also use a sound attenuation device. Both require you to cut out and replace duct. 

Knowing specifically what noises you're trying to get rid of would help greatly and make a fix a lot more certain."

I cared about her alot and treated her well, but I knew there was no future. When we found out she was pregnant I was actually sleeping on the couch. 

I grew up without a father, and when I did get to know him I learned he is a horrible person. I never ever want my kids to know that hurt. So I stayed with this woman for 7 years. When I knew the relationship was worse for the kids than being apart I left her. She kept the house, car, kids etc and I left with a backpack. 

I would still go pick them up and stay there until they went to sleep, then leave for months. I wanted them to ease into the new situation and not suddenly disappear. As time went on they learned what was happening and we were able to get them through it with almost no issue.

To answer your question dont fucking have kids until you both agree it's what you want and are ready financially and are mature enough to understand the stress it causes. Kids are amazing but they also really suck. You change everything about your life because you now arent as important. Your job becomes parent first, yourself second. 

Secondly, dont make any life changing decisions based on your emotions. Every relationship feels amazing in the beginning. As it should. But you dont know each other yet and you dont know how you'll age and grow, how they handle stress, what living together is like etc. Make sure you know a person before making the decision to take a next step.

Lastly, you're gonna fuck this up. You're gonna love someone who you shouldnt. You're gonna have your heart broken sometime. That's all ok. But don't add one more heart to that. No kids before you're ready and able."
