Student here, I recommend both [Discover and Deserve.](https://vibeincollege.com/how-to-improve-your-credit-score-as-a-college-student/). They were my first two cards and helped me reach a 760 FICO score in a year.

In the long run, yes.

>What’s the difference of a secured card vs a unsecured? Any benefits to either one? 

Secured cards are easier to get, but you have to lay down some cash until you graduate to the unsecured version. Discover has the best secured card, but still, unsecured is better if you qualify.

>Transfer balance. Is that putting money from my bank onto the card? If I transferred 100$ to a card, they would take a extra 20 from my bank for a 20% apr?

Balance transfer means moving debt from one credit card to another. It doesn't apply to your situation currently.

>Credit utilization. This confuses me a lot, wouldn’t I want to spend a lot and pay it back for a higher credit score when reported? I’m confused because i see I want a 20% utilization or 30% but that would be spending 60 out of 200 or so

Don't overspend just because you have a card. Utilization also only affects the last time it was reported (every month). Therefore, it's not important to worry about until you're applying for credit within the next month or two.
