My MIL has been coming over to help in AMs for some time now and over the last few weeks my LO hasn‚Äôt been sleeping - too much stimuli during day, and then we all got sick w a cold and anyway.... it was nice to take a quick nap. HOWEVER, I‚Äôm now back at it and she tried to take her from me THREE TIMES today and even cried to my husband that we don‚Äôt need her. 

Note: I brought her out at 7:30a, she fed the bottle, cuddles her, and gave her to FIL to hold. I came out at 8:30a to set her down for a little nap and that‚Äôs when my husband found her crying?!

My best set up is with my Medela pump, pump pals flanges, fractioned coconut oil, duckbill attachments, for 1 hour power pumps.   supplements I take lecithin from legendairy and I have dabbled with some of their other supplements for a slight boost here and there (nothing has really worked consistently)

It was hard, but as my healthy LO had a growth spurt at around 12 w (4w adj) I just couldn‚Äôt fully support her. I brought in a few bottles of formula and it made a world of difference in my morale. 

I chose a Couple organic European formulas, one was goats milk and the other was a hypoallergenic option because I thought maybe she was having some gas due to the proteins. Anyway, she‚Äôs doing fantastic and for being born eight weeks early she is already in the 50th percentile against babies born at term.

The hardest thing is that you will have 2 more months of the newborn phase (which can be positive too, with cuddles and bonding)... but it‚Äôs also pretty exhausting to be constantly not getting sleep.  Aaaand the other thing is that you will constantly be reminding ppl that your baby is X weeks by birth BUT Y weeks adjusted. 

So when they ask about sleep, rolling over, smiling, etc like - ‚Äúoooh their X montages shouldn‚Äôt they ____‚Äù you‚Äôll be like - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget, developmentally they are only ____‚Äù.

ExclusivelyPumping,fe5bief,t3_enqt3g,1578867328.0,"I had a similar situation. I‚Äôll just share what I did and you can do with it what you want :)

I was able to build up a pretty decent freezer stash right off the bat. I had not planned on utilizing it until closer to four months since it was good for six. However, it was pointed out to me that early milk contains a ton of nutrients (not referring to the colostrum, she had 100% of that in the NICU) and fats, so I slowly started to swap out a couple portions a day and it really helped with my daughter‚Äôs weight gain and appetite. The early milk was definitely more creamy.

fast forward a few weeks and my supply started to dwindle a bit even with regular pumping. After she hit it big growth spurt I had a very hard time keeping up with her and had to lean on the remaining freezer supply to supplement my fresh supply. Once that supply was done I had to then supplement a couple bottles a day with formula. 

so in summary, I was exchanging the early frozen for an equal fresh amount and then I ended up having to go through the final frozen supply. Aaaand now I pump and formula feed."

The heaviness and guilt will pass, but only as you finally start to truly see all your efforts. I finally felt like I was doing a good job once I started thinking about all the trips to the Nicu, all the time pumping, all the cuddles, all of the meetings with doctors/nurses, etc...

ExclusivelyPumping,fd2ze09,t3_ejy4jv,1578153307.0,"I don‚Äôt necessarily have great advice, but I will tell you what we ended up doing....

So, my daughter was born two months early, luckily she was (is) very healthy and able to start suckling right away. For me, it was more important to get her the nutrients and calories rather than pushing a latch so I pumped like a mad woman for several weeks. Once we were home I tried getting her to latch and she would, but it was incredibly shallow and very aggressive üò≥. I had her evaluated for everything, it turns out it‚Äôs just her muscle memory and what she got used to early on. 

I was able to pump enough milk for her until she got to about 12 weeks, at that time it was just getting too stressful to try to get every single drop out and stay ahead of her hunger demands. I made what seemed like a difficult choice at the time 
, to supplement with formula (it was actually a huge sigh of relief in the end)- bought a brand called Holle (Goats milk stage 1) online because it was organic. As my little one got a little older I realized some of her gassiness might be from anabiotic‚Äôs given to her when she was little and decided to start helping to repopulate her good gut bacteria. I got probiotic drops, and I also bought a hypoallergenic organic formula from the same site, it has some probiotics to help with overall gut health. So.....In summary, I pump what I can, and then supplement with a bottle or two of goats milk during the day and I give the hypoallergenic formula at night.
