dating,feru45m,t1_fenhybd,1579358357.0,">Dude, you confuse me. On the one hand, you want to end it all, so you should have not that much attachments, what do the social consequences matter, anyway? What are you risking? That, maybe, you don't have to kill yourself? That you could be happier? Wow. You are already at rock bottom. You already think about ending it all. So why don't you try something different? Risk it. Risk the social backlash, or the lack thereof. You don't know what will happen, and it doesn't matter anyway. 
>

The social consequences are I won't have plans to hangout in this small City that I moved to. I could be rejected from my social clubs, and I could not be invited to events. I try to maintain a shallow, pleasant relationship to where people want to hangout with me again, it working. I don't even have a friend group that I can hangout with consistently yet despite me being here for 7 months, which I am fine with now since I decided to end it in March. 



>Do you know how lucky you can count yourself? Not everyone has that connection, and I'm sure that friend will be pretty sad when you are dead. Not to mention your sibling, who will be so grateful for your money when his own brother killed himself, thinking that maybe they could do something. Ofc you are suffering, but you are acting like literally no one cared.
>

Look, when from middle school to college I thought people could help me fix this issue, however, I came to the conclusion that nobody can help me heal or fix me, only I can. Whatever way I choose to fix myself should be left to me and only me because no one else matters in that decision, since they can't help me. I chose suicide because it is guaranteed to solve my problems, it's quick, and I have a lot more control over it. If ending my life means no more suffering then I am fine with it.

>I mentioned it because it's mentioned in the article. How is there not a way for you to recover? Oh right, you are lying to your therapist and don't want to at least try seeking help elsewhere. I, too, am very sensitive and more on the feminine side, but I just have to learn to accept that. Easier said than done, of course, but that's not a reason to kill yourself. Can you list me all your problems, just once? I can't believe that the solution to all of them is killing yourself. You don't sound like someone that is 100% sure with his plans.
 
Main reason why I am considering suicide:

A lot of childhood trauma that I never healed from. Being called ugly, creepy, annoying, telling me to ""shut up"" or ""I should be punched in the face"" is something that sticks with you, especially if you've rarely been told the contrary. Plus I did a lot of stupid mean shit back then which I regret to this day. I literally moved to another state after college because I wanted to start fresh, away from the negative perception of me.

Solution:
A: Spend more money, and  years with therapists and self-help books in hopes of healing/being fix
B: Commit suicide, which is guaranteed to end  the pain and bad memories. 

Secondary reasons:

1. I live with a lot of regret and shame due to many of my failed relationship with others. That's why I am very cautious about telling anyone except for an internet stranger about this side of me. It has cost me friendships with wonderful people. So I focus on my outgoing, funny side more. 

2. As long as I am like this, I am toxic/a hazard. At best, I am good in small doses and at a distance, at worst I should I be quarantine or destroyed. The track record shows it. If I get close to anyone, I open up, they get exhausted, they distance themselves, and move on while I regret ever opening up. 

3. I am lonely and not really care about by much of my current friends. I could go days and a week's and no one would call me. Maybe one friend but that's it. I  embraced it since it makes suicide easier. I could die and they would never find out unless they went to my parents or made an effort to investigate, which they wouldn't.

4. I've been made to feel less at a young age. I didn't receive the stuff I needed to undo the damage. Now I am being told I must fix myself with something I never received and I get criticize if I choose another way to heal. College just made it worst because those issues never got solved, so it affected my social life which now affected my adult social life. It doesn't get better unless I get lucky.


>Why do they have to mean nothing? You have your best friend, or friends, and even if not, you can still do things by yourself. Nobody will look down on you because of this, it's all in your head. I know what you mean, it can be soulcrushing, but if you limit your time on earth, then just try it. You are rejecting every option without even trying it.
>

I have no issue doing things alone.I tend to do it alot but there's a difference when it optional and when it's not. Many time I would like to have someone to go to trivia night with. It was fun but sad to go with a one man team, so I stopped. 


>Sorry for the rant, didn't mean to attack you or anything, but I can't just read your posts and not do anything.


You're not attacking me. I thank you for taking the time to deal with this. I appreciate you at least challenging me on my choices. I am 60% committed, the biggest hurdle is getting a gun which I can get after my income tax. For now, just enjoy life, smile, have fun, and don't raise any suspicion"

dating,fenewxd,t1_femzgcf,1579283214.0,">Don't you think there are in fact people out there that wouldn't let the relationship implode if you open your heart to them? (given that you don't do it the very second you meet them, but you get it) There must be some people out there who won't turn your back on you when you show them your true self. What kind of life is it where you put on your mask before meeting your friends, tiptoeing around the topics that really interest/hurt you, never getting to feel a great connection with someone because the real you is somewhere else?
>
Lol and how exactly do you do that ? Especially after being burned several times and thinking about all the social relationship you've ruined? I don't want to risk it. Besides, if I do die, they won't miss me or even know I am gone. 

Ehh I've only found one and they're my best friend but even then, I feel guilty for putting so much emotional labor. I rather keep it casual and positive. If we talked in person you wouldn't know about these negative thoughts at all lol. I seem like a Happy chill person irl. 

>I've skimmed over the article, it was a bit too long for me rn, and all the stuff she mentioned is enough reason for anyone to break down and cry in fetal position. I can understand your reasons, but I think that sensitive (?) people like you that see the wrongdoing in the world are needed, because they are the only ones who have the insight to change something. If every one of them killed themselves, we probably would be off even worse than now.
>
Change? I rather not focus on things that are out if my control like climate change, consumerism, corruption, ECT ECT. And the thing about being sensitive is it works if you have a way to recover or at least survive. I survive by numbing myself because then you can't function. On too of that there's a lot of negatives for being a sensitive guy, especially if you're not winning the game of masculinity in other aspects. 

>Why bother with therapy? Maybe because you seem to do have some life left in you, given that you have some glimmer of hope attached to your rise of income in the future. I 100% don't endorse your killing yourself, but then I ask you: why don't you make a bucket list and try to make the most of it, until it's over? Probably easier said than done, but if disposable income sounds good to you, you must have some plans. Maybe you have to get more in touch with your ""spiritual side"" (I know this sounds ridiculous, sorry, but that's something some people need) or, idk, just do something that sounds just fun.

Plans mean nothing when you have to go about them alone, like most of the time. Which isn't bad but annoying and depressing when it's your only option. I figured I'll just save the money and pass it on to my sibling after my death. Let's see if things get better by March then December."
dating,femo2im,t1_fem2wy4,1579264309.0,">You know, I think you are so stubborn that you think only you know what's right for you. I have the feeling that you think you have to do this all on your own/no one can help you. Just snap out of this shit for one moment and maybe, just maybe, you SHOULD talk to someone (that doesn't want to send you to a mental hospital right away). Your ""socializing"" seems to mean nothing when you can't form a connection, not because of your ""bad self"", but because you don't let anyone near you. It's hard, of course, but those patterns won't help you.


You are right, I am stubborn and I do have to do this on my own. Experience has shown my relationships are better when I don't open up, despite them being shallow, at least I am not socially alone. Also, many people are not professional and even then, I doubt the professionals can help lol. The treatment sounds vague and without an end goal in sight. 

 The many times I have opened up, the relationship has emploded due to me not holding back. 

Yes, I go to a therapist that I see once a week now once every 3 week but even then, it's for 30 to 60 minutes. But even then, I ask myself why bother working on myself when I really want to leave this life.

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, even though it might seem like all hope is lost. Did you tell your therapist about your thoughts? If not, no wonder he can't help you. Suicide is the easy way out, and you will bring a lot of sorrow to the people around you. Your feelings might overwhelm you and make you feel like that's a preferable alternative to your suffering, but you can change it. Please at least call the suicide hotline if you don't want to tell anyone else, just pour your heart out, I mean there's no point anyway to not try if you are going to die anyway, so why not try it?
>This post was about people meant to be single, but your first priority rn should be you. I'm just a stranger on the internet, so I can't do much, but please, think about it.


I would not tell my therapist because then I might not be able to get a gun and worst case, I might involuntary be place in a hospital which means I might potentially loose my job and have more debt. 

Way to many problem to list but the gist of it is I lost the will to improve myself. I wasn't improving myself for myself, I just wanted tge love and validation that I lacked that as a child. To be honest, I really don't know if you can fix it on your own, without others. But that's the gist of it. 

I've been keeping my friends and others at an arms distance due to experience. I noticed my relationships are better when I don't open up. Which is fine I guess, there's nothing they could do for me. Plus I see an opportunity to take the least painful way to die so, I am not trying to fuck it up."

AskAnAmerican,fcsmeef,t1_fcskdj3,1577919644.0,"Except Nazi kill because they believe in some ideology that based off racist fake science. I am fine with killing them because their lifestyle is a choice that's harms other. You can't choose to be born gay, non-white, or Jewish, but being a Nazi is a choice. A dumb choice."
AskAnAmerican,fcsjmke,t3_einj1s,1577917888.0,"Nazis should be killed, without trial. They have a history of destruction and all of their view pointt have been proven to be I objectively and morally wrong. So if you're still a Nazi in 2020, you choose to be this dumb and ignorant and your death would be a beneficial."

AskMen,fcr7d1f,t1_fcr5vhp,1577897837.0,"Honestly, wants the point of living if you can't fully express yourself? Not worth the trouble imo. I don't blame other men for commiting suicide now, I actually empathize with them a lot more. It might be the only solution. Men seek a solution, a fix."
AskMen,fcr5b6t,t1_fcr437o,1577896990.0,"Yes, feel free to MSG me. I'll try to be as open and honest about any questions you have. I can't speak for all men I can only give you my perspective as a male."
AskMen,fcr26st,t3_eido1p,1577895697.0,"You don't, it causes more trouble than it's worth. I've lost a lot of friendships that way. Just keep it positive and fun for everyone. Use Reddit to vent when you can't see a therapist and get a therapist, they get paid for it. Also, accept that you might never be close with a woman as you'd like to."
AskMen,fcqzjmg,t1_fcqthb5,1577894552.0,"This goes beyond toxic masculinity. There's actual negative consequences for men opening up. Yeah it might feel great to vent now, but when people treat less as a man and more like a fragile thing or an annoyance it doesn't seem worth it."
AskMen,fcqz9gj,t3_eihu63,1577894441.0,"I don't know if this would help but I realized that my relationships work better the less I share. If I maintain a positive, stoic look, my relationships tend to last longer despite them being less meaningful.

After realizing this, I've just accepted the fact to commit suicide because the chance of me living in a society that accepts my emotions openly are low as of right now. 

 Idk if that's much help."

offmychest,fcogn3d,t1_fcmwsns,1577831762.0,"Oh yeah no I am not about that. I dislike suffering. I've already decided on when to buy the gun I am just waiting to fly back home get it. I am more or less at piece. What's fucked up is I am hesitant because of the potential money I'll loose out on making but I know that why I seek money, it's too proof my own worth. I am done chasing that. I realized today that as a man, I was better off never opening up,. I could have had a lot of good friendship. Shit like that keeps me up. So this is the solution."

ElectricalEngineering,fcnhdgn,t3_drpm2n,1577811739.0,"I know this is late but I completed a BS in Electromechanical Engineering Technology in 2018. I got a job starting at 68k, another friend got a 90k job and she was MET. 

Most companies don't care. Actually, at my college, many places prefer the EET/ET over the actual engineering students because they have practical experiences. Most of my classes were project base vs just taking a test. 

We still learn theory but to the extent to understand how the system works not really to design it or optimize, that's what's graduate school is for. Plus these days, you're rarely designing something from scratch. 

Also, the degree is are not for technicians.  It is a bachelors not an associate and the stuff learned is way too indepth for a technician.

Btw, engineering technology degree only matters if you're going for FE/PE but you can get around that by getting a masters or looking at what states allow it."
