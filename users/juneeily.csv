My senior was VERY helpful with this: she'd let her know when it was too rough. Aussies are smart breeds, but as babies they are about a dumb as every other puppy. I think my girl stopped biting at about 4 months.

Ultimately, love and patience, and a bunch of ointment for your poor swollen fingers. Pupper will get there."
dogs,fdrr05v,t3_emtk6k,1578688332.0,"If my husband had not loved my dog, I would have left him. I don't really mean that as a joke: she was literally my scale when I started bringing her around. She adored him, he adored her, and so it was meant to be.

But in seriousness: your dog is a metaphor for YOUR mental health. she is telling you to value *her* mental health over yours. Nope. You (and therefore your doggo) come first. She has a lot to figure out, but it should not be at the cost of the living creature you brought into your life."
dogs,fdrnl7p,t3_emnqy7,1578687049.0,"Bear-Bar-BEE (Barbie), Bar, Bearlina (which is why her middle name is Lina)
Basil-Basie Dukes, Baise, Bouillabaisse, Basil Winifred  (her actual middle name. Grandma said she would haunt me if I ever named a kid that, because it was HER middle name and she hated it. Decently sure it isn't working)"
CrohnsDisease,fdppvvs,t3_emasw9,1578636041.0,"I feel like it is a bit exaggerated. But yeah, I think that everyone who DOES have a medical condition like suggested knows fully darn well that restaurants, gas stations, or large retail stores are easiest to access bathrooms. Sounds like she might have known about the merch thing, having pulled this in the past, and thought she could help herself."
CrohnsDisease,fdpp5qz,t3_emblud,1578635314.0,"Most of my colon was removed. My advice is to not unfairly push yourself afterwards. I was talked into returning to work after only 4 weeks because my big boss is just a bad person (I resigned about a year later because I wasn't able to really heal, leading to severe depression). It was only after just...stopping... that my body started to fit back together again. I think it wouldn't have been so tough if I'd just let myself heal in the first place."

Anxiety,fbb31or,t3_ec72yv,1576692252.0,"It's blankets for me. I have a fleece with me right now. I used to have one I'd take to work. Whenever I go to a friend gathering, I'll choose a quilt to take and wrap myself in. I'm 29, and I just feel better with a blanket on my lap."
