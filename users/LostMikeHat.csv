aww,feozy3s,t3_eq7jfi,1579309056.0,"Wow, I follow you on YouTube! Awesome to see you here brother!

No offense at all but I started watching your videos because I was so intrigued by how you had such a beautiful girlfriend given your situation. Just being honest. I’m so embarrassed that that thought even went through my brain. After watching many of your videos, I found that your personality and attitude are so incredible that anyone would be lucky to be with you.  I was so closed minded to think that relationships had to “look” a certain way. Thank you so much for opening my mind and I really hope others watch your videos and learn from your warm outlook on life.  You’re the man! Hope you’re having a great new year!"

toastme,fe2olfl,t3_enh0nt,1578841243.0,"Take this time to find yourself as a person too.  It’s hard to realize now, but there are tons of guys out there who you could be happy with. Once you find one you’ll realize that your ex is probably not even worth the heartbreak. The sooner you get out there and start dating again, the sooner you will feel better. Let me know if you even need a wingman :) good luck!"

borderlands3,fd4kjq8,t3_ejzs94,1578168386.0,Console players don’t have access to Mayhem mode in TVHM until they complete the campaign in TVHM. This makes creating multiple characters very time consuming. Needs to be fixed.
