PowerShell,ff5uzsu,t1_ff5fr2p,1579611182.0,"Excellent response! I really appreciate all this input. I'm glad to hear it's not a simple concept, but still a functional one! I at least know where to start on this long journey. 

Noticed a lot of rest methods wanted credentials or tokens or session keys. I'm attempting to use get-member to see what I can input, but realizing now that it's all custom and ends up relying on the developers side of stuff. This is likely stuff I'll slowly dabble in instead of driving head first, but it also seems like some of the most relevant and useful ways for me to use powershell at all. Everything I've learned so far falls under ""cool! How do I use this in the real world?"", Which doesn't help me much lol (such as working with AD objects, interacting with registry keys, log files, etc). All very useful tasks that I'm happy I know, but just not currently relevant for me."

Now 25, it doesn't get easier, it just changes. I'm still in the process of finding the right meds. Had it right for the past 8 months, but my body just gave up on them and I'm switching...apparently it's not normal to want to kill yourself at least 5 times a day"

PoliticalHumor,fdkqud4,t3_elrz8p,1578509246.0,"I think we need to evaluate this differently. Americas RICH don't want to pay for healthcare, Americas RICH want to pay for war because it makes them RICHER. Americans don't fucking want to be in a war OR be without healthcare. The bad apples at the top, unfortunately, represent the whole, but thats the tip of the iceberg, and the rest of us fucking hate them."

dogswithjobs,fcwkea7,t1_fcwi5e9,1578028039.0,You're too stupid to even Google it. It's the first result: https://www.servicedogcertifications.org/emotional-support-animal-laws/. Says exactly what I've said. Rights to board a plane as any service animal and the housing act to allow them to live with me without occuring additional charges. Take 2 seconds out of your lonely life and educate yourself
dogswithjobs,fcwk9sn,t1_fcwjwn1,1578027937.0,What 'service' am I stealing with my legitimate ESA? Flight status that was legally obtained with the proper paperwork? Legitimate housing acts that allow ESA's to not be subject to additional fines? I suppose someone who doesn't use their blinker should be gunned down in the street ?
dogswithjobs,fcwk60f,t1_fcwjb8o,1578027851.0,Want more photos of my cute amazing dog doing work? You have a lot of free time on your hands loser lol.
dogswithjobs,fcwk3ub,t1_fcwh6ym,1578027801.0,So you didn't take two seconds to Google it? I'm done arguing with someone so stupid that they won't even read the last comment
dogswithjobs,fcwh2x3,t1_fcwcyql,1578025444.0,"Treat him better than a child cuz he's more well behaved and does more for me than any child ever could. He didn't get in my Xmas card cuz Xmas is lame. He's not a furbaby, he's Rick, my ESA. A single picture of him wearing a vest makes you think I'm loopholing through the system? Do you even know what ESA stands for? Lol. My doctors would bet to differ and have signed off on him"
dogswithjobs,fcwgwm9,t1_fcw2g24,1578025316.0,So annoying. They just say what they think and don't look up facts.
dogswithjobs,fcwgv5f,t1_fcw12mx,1578025286.0,"Lmfao, you want someone arrested for having an ESA. He's not a pet, look it up"
dogswithjobs,fcwgtll,t1_fcvzv9v,1578025255.0,"Could at least get the gender right, idiot. It's a two way situation. Pretty hard to get a personal plane to train him on, but he acted accordingly and did amazing"
dogswithjobs,fcwgpaw,t1_fcuyznn,1578025168.0,"Again, YOU are wrong. They DO have privileges. Did you not even take 20 seconds to Google it? ESA's have special permission for flights and housing. That's it. I never said I brought him to my local McDonald's or Walmart and let him shit on the floor like you seem to be thinking. The vest helps others (like you) who know nothing realize that I likely do have a reason to have him on a plane or am working with him in social environments (such as a local street event or fair, where he wouldn't be brought indoors unless I've checked with the coordinators). You're just bumbling about service dogs, which are entirely separate and have FAR more access for damn good reasons"
dogswithjobs,fcwgax3,t1_fcuef7g,1578024876.0,Sure they will lol. Got any links?
dogswithjobs,fcu91ew,t1_fctveky,1577975440.0,"No, YOU are by complaining and not recognizing that ESA's have legal rights as well and they have been fought for separately. I do the same paperwork as a service dog, go through the same efforts and talk to the same people when taking him on a plane. They are making is easier for dogs with jobs to do what they need to do and people like you who don't recognize that they have separate rights and claims make it harder by complaining because 'he's not a real service animal', meanwhile I've filled out almost a dozen forms, made 10 phone calls, talked to the flight staff weeks before hand and the day of and then get some turd burger (you) who thinks I'm making it harder by doing all the proper steps. He has rights and he will express them. Look up those rights and understand them before hating on him. If he were a pet, he'd go in a carrier. Simple as that."
dogswithjobs,fcu8ib1,t1_fctr1om,1577975062.0,"He isn't much of a fan of flying, but he's much better at it now after a few flights under his collar"
dogswithjobs,fcu8gyo,t1_fctqqhr,1577975036.0,"Are you a troubled person? ESA's have been fought for and given extra rights not that long ago. Pets are being cracked down on much harder. I had to fill out 10 forms to be allowed to take him on the flight. Legitimate service animals have vastly more rights and are given every opportunity they can be given. ""Later this year"" will never happen. I think you need to evaluate what you say first as he has been signed off on by my phsychiatrist multiple times in order to be allowed to be taken with me and live with me. If you don't understand what an emotional support animal is or does, then ask, don't say 'they suck and you're a cunt because I don't know why you'd need a non-service dog ever'. It's people like YOU who will cause issues simply because you don't understand the need for them. They have legal rights and you can look those up anytime you'd like, meanwhile I'll keep expressing those rights by doing the same damn paperwork as a service animal, and getting the same signatures from licensed doctor's and medical individuals to show that I need an ESA for my personal needs. Shame people like you exist who think every dog is a pet. This vest keeps people away from him much the same as a muzzle can be more of a comfort for owners, dogs and others around. I'd rather people view him as the necessity he is instead of instantly tagging him as a 'pet' when he's far more and has been trained as such."
dogswithjobs,fcu7x1g,t1_fctqk3l,1577974671.0,"It is not illegal to put on a red (are you color blind) harness and this vest came with ESA and Service animal tags and he is an emotional support animal and acts as such. He has paperwork from a licensed doctor (phsychiatrist) who is willing to put their job on the line to backup my need for this animal. It isn't as if I'm trying to take him into every building. ESA's have legal rights to be aboard a plane without a carrier in the owners possession as well as being allowed to be owned and live inside of any apartment or rental unit without additional charges for a pet, since they are legally allowed as occupants. I'd suggest you learn up on something before spewing hate lol."
dogswithjobs,fcu7k0w,t1_fctvjji,1577974426.0,"You can't ask to be relocated due to a child. Boom, he's less of a problem already. Also, airports are VERY accommodating for ESA and service animals and most people will happily work with you, whereas an annoying child is just an annoying child. No moving them or anything to avoid problems there."
dogswithjobs,fcu7fiq,t1_fctwqkg,1577974347.0,"That's just a bad owner of they don't wash and brush their dog. It also isn't recommended to wash them more than once or twice a month as they need the oils on their hair for something, so there's still limitations on how much we can do to help prevent this. From my experience, most individuals would have to either be in contact with the animal or I'd have to be actively petting him against the grain to get hair/dander on the air. Sat right next to an individual was stated he was very allergic, but he said Rick never bothered him once."
dogswithjobs,fcthxfb,t1_fctfapb,1577943862.0,You're stupid. They have jobs and are (substantially) less problematic than most kids even are. I'm glad they have the right to be allowed on planes and hope you get kicked off before they do. Brought my dog along for emotional support and he was much more well behaved than the kid across the isle throwing a tantrum over his fucking crackers.
dogswithjobs,fctht8z,t1_fcterw3,1577943750.0,People no buy ticket that cost lot money.
dogswithjobs,fcthrci,t1_fctcbe4,1577943698.0,"100% agreed. I always joke with my GF that my support animal is FAR less disruptive than any fucking child. Some morons brought their kid to starwars and it was screaming the entire fucking time. Alternatively, I brought my dog on a 4 hour flight and he didn't make a fucking peep. They can EASILY be trained to behave better than any child."
dogswithjobs,fcthmb4,t1_fctfuga,1577943563.0,"Could be the other side of the flight. This was 16 hours, so likely not even the same country. I brought my support animal to go home, and he helped me with dealing with my family. Sometimes it is worth the trouble to have them along if possible, I can get paperwork to have my support animal with me, but I can't tell a cop to hold on while I go get my dog lol."
dogswithjobs,fcthis5,t1_fct8vfw,1577943469.0,"Could be an empty one, but this rule was applied to me with a 15lb chigi. They did ask a lot of questions along the lines of ""is your service/support animal smaller than a 2 year old child"", so they may be more lenient on larger animals, or require a seat to be purchased separate for them. I was surprised at how little they cared the day of the flight, but they were hounding me for paperwork the day I bought my tickets, and that was for a support animal, not service"
dogswithjobs,fcthcji,t1_fct11xm,1577943304.0,Most the time they don't get their own seat unless you paid for it. I brought my chigi and he had to sit in my lap.
Garmin,fcndwoa,t1_fcn7x1a,1577809668.0,"Could very well be that I'm out of shape and riding just puts me up to that 'high' point I guess. It was just a leisurely ride to work though, nothing crazy. fastest I went was 55 lol. I get it catching steps there, but not sure how it got steps from me laying in bed doing nothing, that's a bit bothersome since I expect more accuracy, it's not a cheap-o pedometer after all haha."
LateStageCapitalism,fbtj2qm,t1_fbt88oe,1577080726.0,"He may have been arguing the increased cost for the new year? Any way it goes down, it's a gross situation where the majority is overruled but a massive minority."
