She was excited, she said it bothered her, and not only did you make her feel shittier for it, but you could have had a little empathy. I have zero sympathy for no-shows. It's an extremely selfish move and pretty much the reason deposits exist. But that situation could cost you more than 100 after the word of mouth and bad review. People look at that stuff.
