todayilearned,ff8jov9,t1_ff7lbrd,1579681657.0,I read the book for my common reading in college. Though I struggled to get through the beginning of the book the bulk of it grabbed my attention. I didn't realize it was a true story until I reached the end. I don't remember any of these events from my teens and childhood.

todayilearned,ff7pd26,t1_ff5ugds,1579655091.0,"Something I have started doing is writing one thing a day that I am grateful for. I try not to repeat. I've been doing it for a month and a half and sometimes it takes all day to think of something that I actually feel grateful for. Often times I say that I am grateful or happy since that is the appropriate emotion but I don't actually feel it.

I don't know if it is helping with being able to feel more emotions. I think I have more good days than not now."

migraine,ff7m5ma,t1_ff7kzc7,1579652852.0,"I might be a little weird and let my cat drink milk off my spoon while I'm eating cereal. I know it might not be the most sanitary but it taught him to wait until he is offered food to grab it, made him love me more, and makes him happy.

Your story made me smile. Thank you for sharing it."

migraine,ff0zmdv,t1_feu05pn,1579473790.0,"I've travelled a good bit in a variety of environments. I didn't get them in TN, but I lived on a farm with many animals. In PA I got them occasionally and there was just a dog. In TX they flared up unimaginable and there were no animals but an unbelievable amount of stress. In WV I've gone from every week to a few years remission and now daily.

Thank you so much for your advise. I've also noticed that during the winter they flare up even worse. I'm sorry your feline friend caused you so much pain. Maybe a furless one could be an option? Or a different type of animal? When I was missing my animals pretty bad I got one of those pet games on the 3ds. It helped the ache a little bit."

migraine,ff0xw2x,t1_fevycps,1579473394.0,"If you ever have questions or just want to share something everyone on here is nice. Some things I recommend looking up or doing: nightowl (an app that let's your phone get super dark), migraine buddy (an app that is a godsend for tracking migraines), and making yourself a little cave to hide in. I hide in my closet during attacks and while it doesnt make the pain stop it is comfortable"
migraine,fetf12z,t1_ferldsj,1579374776.0,"Not weird at all! He was trying to help the only way he knew how. If anything he told you that he knew you were hurting and focused his love and attention there.

When my migraines aren't going on every day anymore I want to get a support animal to help me detect attacks. My main prodrome symptom is depression and I can't tell it from my normal depression. It makes taking medicine before a full attack hard."

migraine,fetedr5,t1_ferzdle,1579374551.0,That is so sweet. Momma has stomach issues and our old boy would try to lay on her tummy and purr. He tried so hard to make her feel better. She would be able to handle his head against her stomach which was enough for him
migraine,fete32d,t1_fesfx9v,1579374439.0,Sadly no. I wear a cute black cat eye mask I got from Books-a-million. It is just the right tightness to keep out the dark and stay in place while not hurting my head. I do want to try an ice cap though
migraine,fetduzz,t1_feta4pq,1579374359.0,Oh they definitely know! The only time he comes to me for cuddles is when I don't feel well. Otherwise I wrap around him while he is asleep to get some cat snuggles

todayilearned,feibz0g,t1_fei08n4,1579134940.0,My blue heeler loves to be carried around so she can lay her head on my shoulder but she's older now and it hurts her arthritis for me to do it. I still try occasionally because she loves it so much. It is a surefire way to cheer her up.
memes,fds0cs2,t1_fdrzdey,1578692376.0,"You just reminded me of something silly.

migraine,fdp4lez,t3_emc2u0,1578619862.0,I'm either starting the flu (roommates have it) or a migraine. I'm not sure which I would prefer
migraine,fdp4ge1,t3_emh7p4,1578619768.0,"In my experience CBD oil didn't do anything but lower the anxiety I get with migraines. I have been using marijuana vapes to try to help. They keep me out of the hospital for when I can't take the pain anymore, but they will not stop an attack unless I take it as soon as I think it is starting. Sadly I don't want to be high constantly so it is usually too late by the time I'm sure it is a migraine. It can help me sleep one off though. If you try, drink plenty of water. It gives me terrible cotton mouth"

Eyebleach,fd7b9ys,t1_fd55xes,1578201880.0,"I had it happen once when our dog had puppies. We kept the one who played tug of war with my hair and the one who took my glasses and ran. On my darkest days I remember the event and the utter joy I had.

And yes, there was a lot of excited puppy pee. Well worth the immediate shower and new glasses."
techsupportgore,fcqdhwt,t1_fcq2img,1577883842.0,I think you're right about the key. Probably slammed his lid because it crashed from overheating. Open it up after it (and he) cooled off just to see his new permanent screensaver.

migraine,fcntcto,t1_fcno7oo,1577818031.0,"I might turn the notifications off. It is an absolutely fantastic app, don't get me wrong, but seeing ""You have had a migraine for XX amount of days"" is pretty depressing.

Buuuut, the app is great. I need to start doing it again. It helped me realize that storms are one of my triggers now."
migraine,fcnszif,t1_fcn6tm6,1577817833.0,"All of my immediate management either saw me in an attack or had attacks themselves. Due to the grace of a very loving supervisor and manager, they kept me. They offered to fire me due to the absences being un-accomitable so I would have a stronger case for disability. I declined the offer, but it was genuine. They felt bad for me. (During the second month of my 90 day probation period I used up all 14 days of my annual sick time. It has calmed down since I work from home now, but I still miss a lot.)

It has been two years and my manager is gone, the supervisor who had them is gone, and the other supervisor isn't mine anymore due to a shift change. I'm getting afraid with rumors of the new manager. I printed out FMLA paperwork to have my doctor do today. With the real possibility of needing disability before I didn't fill it out when it started and there was an understanding with the prior manager that I could miss time as needed as long as I stayed a strong employee. I have kept the same mentality of getting fired up until the new manager.

It's hard, but get paperwork filled out if you can. I found communicating with my manager and supervisors about exactly what was happening physically and mentally was a boon. I got lucky- they were so understanding. Try to keep your chin up and I'll do the same, okay?"

I knew, but I gave the very misplaced benefit of the doubt."

I had a woman who called in about their word not doing *I don't even remember what* and they had me so confused. I remoted in and saw Outlook open, asked her about it (it seemed unusual), and she got both defensive and passive aggressive.

I got a bad survey for making her feel stupid and that I should have known what she meant when she said Word."
