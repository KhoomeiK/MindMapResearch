gtaonline,fe1msqx,t3_enlbj5,1578828479.0,"Spend every penny smartly. Get 50k and register for VIP. Next is the buzzard attack chopper to grind headhunter and sightseer. Then, work towards your bunker. Get the Chumash bunker, might seem a bit expensive, but it's the best one hands down. Upgrade the bunker and then you can buy supplies for 75k. Till then, steal supplies because if you buy then for 75k, you'll sell them for 75k as well, netting you 0 profit. Next should be a vehicle warehouse and then focus your grind between that and HH-SS. Set-up MC businesses after that and finally set-up the nightclub.

See, I know doing heists is very exciting and I agree. Maybe get a high end apartment for 215k (Alta street) and do the first two, or just the first one ""The flecca job"" because it makes a dope ass car called the armored kuruma cheaper to buy. The kuruma will be your friend for a long time in this game."

gaming,fcozt7z,t1_fcn9rru,1577846167.0,"I know I am gonna get downvoted for this. But the way fortnite handles mtx isn't really predatory. You get the skin what you pay for. Their battle pass structure is also kinda nice given that if you buy it once and complete it (which is easy if you play like half an hour a day) you would have more enough needed to buy the next one. 

Mind you I still hate loot boxes and other predatory shit. But there's a simple logic to be followed here. Assume I only play SP games and thus spend 60$ every 3 months. The kid only plays fortnite and spends 60$ on the game every 3 months. We both are getting what we pay for, no bamboozles. So does it really matter? I mean we are both spending money on shit we actually like to play."

I can confirm this. My mom is a hardcore vegetarian. My dad ate meat very occasionally before the marriage but now he doesn't. To be fair he doesn't really care much about the topic anyway. I started eating meat when I was 15. My mom refused to talk to me for 3 days when she found out. After 3 days she asked only one thing, that meat shouldn't enter this house. I can eat whatever outside, but inside the house is a no-no.

My mom is generally a very sweet lady and is pretty chill about other things but in this case her beliefs outweigh everything else."
