women,fel0lhq,t1_fekxab7,1579211493.0,"I guess though if someone says they’re going to show you a pic of their bbq you would expect to see some people shirtless. I can see how not expecting to see someone shirtless when they say the pic is of their dogs, would be uncomfortable. I live in CA so I’m more closely aligned with you in the sense that men go shirtless all the time where I am. I can see how like in the midwest for example, especially in Jan, someone would be surprised and uncomfortable at that, even just from the surprise alone. And, I may be cynical, but I’m sure the guy knew exactly what he was doing “accidentally” showing her a pic of him shirtless, which would also be uncomfortable to witness."
SapphoAndHerFriend,fekyjx3,t3_epl4ye,1579210268.0,"are these books actually about lesbians or does it frame homosexuality (or bisexuality) as a sin/madness/signs of a~ man hating bitch? ~

bc it would be cool to red a book about lesbians from the 40s if it was engaging a discussion, but not cool if it’s just another pulp book about “crazy bitches” and the hell they bring to men"

AteTheOnion,fdiomzh,t1_fdhyw20,1578447575.0,I have been wondering recently about all of these subtle and very believable posts from ironic sites- if it is almost completely indistinguishable from truth when does it turn into fake news?

beauty,fd4jnvl,t1_fczb0lm,1578168126.0,"I’m not sure how familiar you are with depression or if this is the first time you’re experiencing it. i’ve had it for a long time and one thing I learned that will undo a lot of the hard work i’ve done or set me back is expecting an output or result like from the early days before I had depression. There is a lot I could do then that is just too overwhelming for me to attempt all at once now and if I try to make myself perform how I did before I felt like this, I just feel worse about myself. Integrate as much of your beauty routine as possible but don’t beat yourself up if it takes a little while to get back to where you were. Having a desire to get back to your routine is a really good sign that you’re on your way to being able to do it again! I believe in you and your post has inspired me to add more steps to my beauty routine."
ProjectPan,fcyqkjq,t3_eiu6b0,1578085043.0,"can i ask how you like the go-go tint by benefit? It seems like something I’d be interested in, especially since you can use it on face and lips but how well does the pigment spread and what do you use to spread it around on your cheeks? thank you!

also good luck with the pans! i believe in you and i bet you’ll create some amazing looks with all the colors in your pallets :^)"
unpopularopinion,fcaegb8,t1_fcad6gq,1577567840.0,"your female boss telling you you’d lose your job if you didn’t sleep with her, even though you potentially have a wife and kids is sexual harassment. she didn’t touch you but she threatened your job and well-being"
unpopularopinion,fcae9sy,t1_fcab5wg,1577567749.0,"that’s sexual assault, not sexual harassment. harassing someone is not leaving them alone when you ask , so sexual harassment is someone not leaving you alone or still harassing u with sexual noise pollution after you’ve asked them to please leave you alone when it comes to that stuff."
relationship_advice,fc48nku,t1_fc3nrsm,1577409610.0,"Right but finding a person who CAN respond to that information in a constructive way is imperative to a healthy relationship based on trust. If someone is going to leave him bc of that information, then they aren’t right to be together in the first place. His lot is hard, but finding someone who will accept him knowing the truth is part of the challenge. He can never ever have a real relationship with that secret if it will end the relationship once it’s told. No one, including him, *deserves* a relationship, they have to work hard and be worthy and honest. That secret is a major aspect of his life and someone marrying him, not knowing that, would not be marrying the real
him, just an image created for the SO that’s more palatable

Also, idk if it makes my point clearer, but i think everyone who struggles with those feelings should be able to go to a doctor before they’re shamed into oblivion, a place where succumbing to urges is much easier. The issue I find is the imbalance of trust"
relationship_advice,fc3fz5s,t1_fc1q5jf,1577388951.0,I think it’s the issue of not telling the truth. That is a major secret and one that is disturbing to try to keep hidden from the person you want to marry and conceivably have no secrets from
relationship_advice,fc3fqu5,t1_fc1q5b3,1577388808.0,"I know it would suck for him, not feeling like he could ever build a meaningful relationship bc people would leave him if they found out he was a pedophile but isn’t that their absolute right? I know it’s hard on him and maybe he can’t help his feelings but I still wouldn’t want to date someone who was programmed/born/whatever to be sexually attracted to children, even if he is working on it. His desire for a relationship isn’t more important than telling the truth about something so serious, right? I mean he could NEVER have a real, meaningful relationship if the truth isn’t out and his SO doesn’t love him despite it

nvm just read you’d still be outy/ aren’t defending him just explaining his rationale. imagine this response directed at the BF"
