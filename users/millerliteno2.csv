I’ve seen cold patch, hot patch, panel replacement, etc... never slopping some Home Depot concrete into the hole and calling it a day."
facepalm,fddop4s,t3_eklcc6,1578319761.0,I don’t see the problem... a little bit of rain and some traffic and you’ve got yourself some perfectly mixed concrete. Can’t fix some potholes without first getting some irreparable auto damage!
facepalm,fddn9q4,t3_eki24e,1578318494.0,This is more of a r/iamatotalpieceofshit
facepalm,fddmqiw,t1_fdcchm0,1578318006.0,It’s really not a specific angle or spot. It looks like that clear as day from the highway up the hill as you drive by. I’ll give you that head on it doesn’t look that way. But to the thousands of cars that drive by on Hwy 64 every day... your house says poop.
facepalm,fdcd5uk,t1_fdccym9,1578272020.0,I’ll give you that. I think it could go either way. I feel for the poor sap that buys the house either way.
facepalm,fdcck1f,t1_fdc79pp,1578271622.0,It’s not intentional... I drive past it often. Just poor choice and an unfortunate angle to see it from the road.
tmobile,fakg2ij,t1_faju6zl,1576166535.0,"Do you have any idea of the costs that go into installing and maintaining cell sites? They’re hundreds of thousands of dollars per site. There are spectrum licenses, feature licenses, software licenses, equipment, electricity, backhaul, permits, labor... the list goes on and on. And that’s just on a macro site. Small cells are even less “bang for the buck” in terms of subscriber coverage. After learning about how much expense there actually is, I was a bit amazed that service isn’t more expensive.

Yes, there will be some economies of scale, but that doesn’t mitigate inflation and other costs forever."
