That isn't accurate.  Most states have verbiage that says something along the lines that you can't ""knowingly"" sell to someone prohibited.  The reason that this is very different than ""can't sell to"" is that it doesn't force a background check or any verification.  I can sell you a gun in those states and just say ""I was not aware of any reason why I could sell this person a gun"". and furthermore ""do not tell me about your situation because I don't want to know.
