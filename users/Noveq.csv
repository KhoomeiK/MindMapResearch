A lot of the issues you raise don't really come up in every day life either. And in the case of people who try for security clearances, a lot of those things like having a foreign passport, or having assets in another country actually disqualify you from obtaining that clearance.

Your points are obviously valid but I just really haven't seen it become an issue before. 

All I can comment on is my own experiences, and I firmly would be on the US side of a US-Italy war in that crazy scenario.

Her voice as it currently is, is not the way she would sound had she not intentionally trained it to sound the way it does. This is evident by the fact that it is a complete mimicking of the way anime characters speak and trying to sound ""cute"".

Accents are not trained and happen unintentionally. This is the difference between a natural accent and an unnatural way of speaking. As you say, an Indian person who lives in Ireland will have what we think is an ""Irish"" accent. If I, who does not live in Ireland decide tomorrow that I want to speak with an Irish accent, I would have to do so with voice training.

Patently false. If you talked to a woman and talked to her pre-puberty you'd know this.

>Its no more ‘unnatural’ than being raised to speak with an accent.

It is unnatural because they are making an effort to sound a certain way whereas an accent is inherently present when they learn to speak. This is why we can differentiate where people grew up based on how they speak. A -regional- accent.

>As you yourself stated; No ones voice is 100% “natural”, everyone speaks with an accent.

Never have I said no one speaks naturally. You seem to have some sort of disconnect with the real definition of the word ""accent""."
