{Edit:} So my above comment was based on History class in the 90's - from a bit of googling, I assume the story is based on some of the hypothermia experiments.


The story we were told: during WWII, Jews at Dachau were submerged in ice water. Their metabolisms slowed to such a rate that the speed of oxygen exchange from the water was sufficient to sustain them. These test subjects were able to continue breathing water until they died of hypothermia, or were removed from the water. At which point, they would drown.


One of those ridiculous tales that you believe until you think about it, I guess!
