It only takes $14,500 to crack the top 10% globally(Note: this source calls the PPP$ from above international dollars to attempt to equalize for translation/parity).  The line barely moves vertically because it takes so little income to move up through the percentages.  But then at the end it gets insane to try to move further to the right.

The risk of ESPP's is that you're already extremely invested in the company, and the ESPP just makes you more invested.

Let's say Apple suddenly implodes and declares bankrupty.  That would definitely hurt the S&P, but apple makes up less than 3.5% of the total S&P.  Assuming that whatever hit it was isolated, you would be down, but still ok.

But imagine if instead, you had been putting all your money directly in Apple.  Now your entire apple investment is gone(or near gone).  That's bad.  But it could be worse...

Right now, I'm assuming you don't work for Apple.  You lost your investment, but at least you still have a job right?  But what if you did work for Apple.

Your highly concentrated investment just tanked all your savings AND you likely lost your job all at the same time.

That's why ESPP's are a concentration risk.  You're already invested in your company because they give you a paycheck.  Going all in on your company is what destroyed people when Enron went down.

So does that mean they matching your ESPP purchase or are you talking about the 401k?  If they match on ESPP, that would be instead of a discount.

For example, my company does a 75% match on purchases.  So if I buy 100 shares, I get an additional 75 shares free.  We have a one year holding period though.

If you're getting a match with no holding period, that's a pretty nice deal."

Job hopping **is** the best way to ensure you're being paid market rate.

If you're being paid competitively for your skill level, hopping won't help you because it will slow down your skill development, but if you're significantly under market, it's the best way to fix that.

I started my career in 2007 getting hired full time after being an intern.  Then the market tanked.  Over the next 3 years, 2 of those had a salary freeze and the other was just a 3% raise.  Meanwhile, while I had been hired as a financial analyst, I was really an IT professional role that worked closely with finance.  My starting salary never reflected that my job was more complicated than the others in my department.

So I got hired at $45k, my one raise got me up to \~$47k.  At the end of 2010, they gave me a bump up to $58k, but I knew that wasn't good enough.

I left and got brought up to $80k in early 2011.  Worked there for several months when my old supervisor(not the boss in charge of raises) reached out saying he left our old company too and had a chance for me to come work with him.  The company I was at had just hired a new boss over me that I didn't get along with(he ultimately drove 4/5 the department away).  So I left after working there for 11 months, for a jump to north of $100k, however I've now been here for 8 years with no plans of leaving any time soon.

So it took 2007-2010 to go from $45k to $58k.  2011-2012 to get from $58k to $105k.

The job hopping got me a huge jump because I was underpaid in 2011, not because I hopped.

Job hopping itself doesn't pay well, but it's great at fixing mistakes in your pay level.  The further you are from market rate, the more of a reason to hop."

  [Qualifying Relative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifying-relative.asp) 

The IRS requires four tests to be passed for a person to be classified as a qualifying relative.

1. The qualifying relative must not be a qualifying child of the taxpayer or of anyone else; no taxpayer can claim them on their tax return as a qualifying child.   
**If your mom didn't provide over half, she can't claim him.**
2. The qualifying relative must either ***live in the taxpayer's household all year*** or be related to the taxpayer as a child, ***sibling***, parent, grandparent, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, certain in-law or certain step-relative. Someone who is not technically related to the taxpayer can become a qualifying relative by living with the taxpayer all year, and someone who is related to the taxpayer – but doesn’t live with them – can be a qualifying relative. A person who died during the year but lived with the taxpayer until death or who was born during the year and lived with the taxpayer for the rest of the year is considered a qualifying relative, even though that person didn’t live with the taxpayer for the full year.   
**You're covered under both.**
3. The qualifying relative must have a gross income of less than $4,200 in 2019. This amount can increase every year. **You said he had no job, so you're good.**
4. The qualifying relative must have received **more than half of their financial support** for the year from the taxpayer. **I'm assuming you're good here.**"

Completely agree there.  I actually think the author's focus on networth vs monthly budget was is a big problem with his stance.

But at the same time, the concept seems right(even if his numbers are wrong).  If you're putting away $1k a month towards savings.  The difference between $1000 and $999 isn't something the to worry about.  If you're only putting away $10 a month, then the extra $1 is huge.

That said, you should also be balancing the math be excluding the amount of your mortgage payment that goes towards principal payment from your monthly costs.   That amount is effectively you paying yourself in an account that you can't get to easily, but it's still your money.

But definitely make sure you budget for maintenance, and budget higher for the rental maintenance.  You may take better care of your house and put repairs off if things are ""good enough"" for now, but most tenants care less about your house yet demand you fix things immediately.

You can then contribute to a roth IRA up until somewhere around $190k if married.  If you go over that, you're not allowed to deduct the traditional ira contribution **or** directly contribute to a roth IRA.

At that point, you make a traditional IRA contribution that you can't deduct, and then convert it to a roth IRA.  That gets your money into a Roth IRA through the back door."
personalfinance,feafv5p,t1_fe8swjn,1578948176.0,"It doesn't quite work out the same... but honestly, to be able to predict which is better is almost impossible.

Let's say for example that you have no other retirement income.  A Traditional now gets you a deduction at your marginal rate.  Then in retirement, when you draw from your 401k, the first money will be taxed at 0%, then next will fill the first tax bracket, and so on.  

The end result is that you got a deduction today at your **marginal** rate, while in retirement you'll be taxed at your **effictive** rate.  Meanwhile, if you had nothing but your Roth account, you don't get to tax advantage of the first amounts of income that are basically tax free.

However if you go too far with traditional, you're tied to what the future tax rates might be and if they were to go significantly higher, you could lose out.  If you're in the 24% bracket today, you know you're paying at 24%... in retirement, the rates could double for all we know(they could also plummet, but that's less likely).

So it's definitely not equal... there's just no way of knowing for sure which is better right now.  Generally people suggest a mix of the two so you have flexibility in retirement."

That ""limit"" is just the front door limit.  **Everyone** can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as they have earned income.  

The backdoor roth contribution isn't complicated, just one extra transfer.   If you keep the account open, you don't even have to create new accounts every year."

The match is usually something like 50% on the first 6% or 100% on the first 3%(other matches obviously exist, but let's say you get a 50% match.  1.50 *.83 = 1.245, so you're still up 24% after 30 years of expense fees.

Much more importantly though, that ignores the fact that the match is growing.

If there match earns 7% a year, on $1000 invested, the match would earn $35 a year, while the full $1500 would cost .006 *150 = $9/year.  You just have to earn a measly 0.018% return for the match to pay for the expense fees entirely.

Also, I wouldn't count on inheritance from parents.  It's not unheard of for people to live long enough to see their children retire.  What's the plan if you go to retire and they're still alive?

It can still be a great deal at the right company, but at the same time, a single stock can easily drop 15+% in 3 months.

My company doesn't offer a discount, rather they do a 75% match, but if you sell before the 1 year is up, you lose the match.  It works out that it would have to take a 63% drop for me to lose money.  At this point I don't think that's likely and most analysts predict us going 30-40% higher, but a few years ago(before the ESPP existed) the stock dropped about 95% in a year.
