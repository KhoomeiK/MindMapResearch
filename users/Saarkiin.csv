gaming,feojtzu,t3_eq5q53,1579301141.0,I always wondered if pokeballs would work on people. You think the pokeworlrd has laws against capturing people in pokeballs against their will? Do people become fiercely loyal after being captured? Do criminal organizations use pokeballs to facilitate human trafficking?

dankmemes,fdrzors,t3_emtqll,1578692149.0,"A meme isn't synonymous for joke. It was coined by Richard Dawkins to refer to the concept of self replicating thought. Ideas that, when they get stuck in your head, can't help but be replicated into your own version of it. 

An example of nonfunny memes is religious thought. When a religious or spiritual concept gets into people's heads the tend to replicate their own version of it. I.e. the many, many spinoffs of Christianity. 

But almost anything can be a meme. Memes help us build off of one another until we live in a society."

Showerthoughts,fdg5fi4,t1_fdg4mhw,1578380743.0,"If it were a fungus or a parasite then puppitering a corpse would make sense, narrativly speaking. But a virus needs living DNA to multiply and spread so it'll need be an living, infected human rather than an undead. I could see a virus engineered to keep the host living as long as possible to spread itself quickly. But the host would likely be a sickly, lethargic thing that posed no threat beyond infection. 

Bacteria is why nonmagical, actually dead zombies can't be real. Bacterial colonies eat through corpses quickly."
Showerthoughts,fdg1f1j,t1_fdfr24m,1578376501.0,"In my opinion an infected human style zombie apocalypse like 28 days and cinematic WWZ would be scarier than the undead version but it would burn out very fast. The zombies are just infected people who are otherwise normal. So they would still need food and water or become lethargic and suffer from malnutrition and die off. So it would be over in roughly 28 days as the zombies either starve out or cannablized each other. That dude in 28 days later would've slept right through the apacolpyse. 

I still think it's a cool concept because it would still be a neat and effective terrorist attack scenario or the narrative can play with the zombies mutating like resident evil or l4d. Also it fits the origins of zombies as Hatian serfs under a chemical induced mind control by a witch doctor.

But a true undead horde is a much different nightmare than a bunch of diseased cannibals rushing you. It is a slow, rotting mass of the damned corpses of countless generations. Individually, they are painfully slow and pretty weak. But that's not the point. A raised army in the hundreds of thousands range is an unholy force of nature. Anything approaching a true horde would be filled with dread and risk dying instantly. The negative energy would slowly kill everything around it and anything that could resist the fear and darkness would be swarmed by the wretched creations who exist only to kill. 

And, of course,  at the center of the relentless undead is often a very pissed off Elder Lich. The Lich would've spent decades raising these dead and is going to steamroll the country side. It'll nuke anything that threatens the stability of the dead. 

The infected human style zombie apocalypse would be short but intense. You could either wait it out or defend yourself with conventional weaponry. 

Idk wtf to do about the undead horde led by a Lich. Probably sit back and hope someone's god gets involved. Nothing is scarier than the impending doom of an undead army while hoping a deity decides to get off its ass and do something about it.

Eh a teenage girl will probably prison shank the Lich. It'll be fine."

Showerthoughts,fdff23k,t1_fdf7uve,1578360187.0,"Modern zombies should just decay rapidly over several months.  That's why I think all risen undead are conjured through some dumbass fucking with the dark arts. Magic undead are saturated with negative energy which kills living things in and around it, preventing biological degredatiion. However the elements should do the same so idk wtf I'm talking about."
