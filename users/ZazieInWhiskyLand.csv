1. identify things that were triggering me that Low Fodmap didn’t
2. Helped me pick the best options within Low FODMAP to not keep slowly topping up the bucket without realising (the differences between races and potatoes really helped)
3. The two above combined to give me a margin of error/latent capacity I didn’t have before, so I’ve been more able to tip toe out into small serves of the FODMAP foods I’m less sensitive to. This has really helped me increase diversity in my diet, and also take a few small controlled risks on foods that are either beneficial to me for other dietary reasons or have meaning/sentimental value for me (hazelnuts for example).
4. As my diet gets more diverse and I’m relying less on a few staples, my overall health gets more stable and some positive cycles start up (able yo exercise more etc).

Good luck."
FODMAPS,fekz8tj,t3_eobmkk,1579210686.0,"I think part of the reason behind the traffic light system (no no just scrolling through green light foods) is that you’re not meant to eliminate all fodmaps forever. You are meant to reintroduce and find find your tolerance leveks. And that;s so you don’t end up with a massively restricted diet of like 10 or 12 :safe” foods that you end up intolerant too because you’ve overeaten them.

The extra information about which foods are totally FODMAP free, which have traces, how big the red dose is compared to the green dose have been really, really useful to me in working out  both balanced meals/menus for the day and also personalised safe portion sizes of different foods based on which of the fodmaps I am more or less sensitive too.

The amount of info can be really overwhelming at first, but as you get more into it and what to adapt things to what works best for you personally, it’s really, really valuable."

Of the two, I’d say the app was most useful in practice.  There are notes at the beginning of the app that pretty much cover everything in the book, but in less detail. There’s also lists of foods with scores and a calculator that lets you plug in details of foods not already on the system. 

 If you prefer the full rationale behind it before trying then the book is better. 

I did try the diet on it‘s own for a while (I.e. loosened up on fodmaps a lot). That didn’t work so well for me, fodmaps is definitely a big part of the picture (esp. fructans). But in conjunction with low fodmap it really helps a lot.

 I’d say that structurally I follow Cedars-Sinai (meal timing and spacing), for content  (which foods) I’m a mix of Low Fodmap, Fast Tract & Low Sulphur, and there’s a pinch of paleo in overall food philosophy- fresh, real foods are usually, but not always better."

Thai or jasmine white rice is absorbed really quickly as it has a high glycemic index, low/no fibre and low/no sugar alcohols I got that information from the Fast Tract Diet book and app by Norm Robillard. He uses a formula based on net carbs, dietary fibre, glycemic index and sugar alcohol content to calculate the fermentability potential of foods. 

Thai or jasmine white rice basically has a fermentability potential of zero (in fact less than zero), whereas basmati rice has an FP of 17 and ordinary Uncle Ben’s is 20. 

Waxy potatoes are less fermentable than floury ones too. That’s another thing that’s really helped.

When I feel like I’m getting close to low motility (methane) or high motility (hydrogen sulphide) I not only tighten right up on fodmaps, I head for the fastest of the Fast Tract stuff. It does really help.

With me it’s the bust rather than the hips, but the outcome is the same- easy to look too sexy without trying.

As you’re cool/pink toned I’d say there will definitely be a shade of lavender or lilac that will work for you. I think it would look great with your hair. Colour theory says primary colour looks great with the secondary colour composed of the remaining two primarys, so purples in general (red and blue) could be a really fruitful option for you."
Microbiome,fee33p2,t1_fdot1ct,1579025394.0,"That’s interesting. I’m pretty much the same. 

I wonder if it’s down to methane archaea and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria both competing for hydrogen but drawing other elements from diet. E.g. meat is high in sulphur, so the sulfate reducing bacteria have more to draw from, so if you go into low carb paleo you are favouring that side of the competition and do into IBS-D, too far into soluble fibre etc and it favours the other side so bloat/constipation. 

I’ve noticed I do pretty well when I do an odd combo of a lot of things that seem contradictory.

So

1. IF, but 14/10 not 16:8 (even 12:12 or 13:11 can work well). Usually that means two meals, but often I do well with a snack too- as long as I leave at least 3-3.5 hours after a meal to have a snack and the same interval after and as long as the snack is highly Fast Track compliant (so basically waxy potatoes or Thai white rice based- there are a couple of potato starch based snacks that work for me).
2. Low Fodmap, but occasional v small serves of GOS foods, like canned chickpeas or hazelnuts or chocolate.
3. Lower Carb/higher protein, but lower sulfur meats, so lamb rather than beef, pork rather than fish/seafood, with chicken dark meat is better than light.
4. Choosing starches/fibers carefully. So waxy potatoes and thai white rice because they break down quickly, resistant starch/bamboo fibre/citrus fibre/ hydroxypropyl methylcellulose good but avoid too much psyllium.

I’m wondering if that’s some like balancing both sides of methane/hydrogen sulfide production in SIBO."

FODMAPS,fedyptd,t3_eog10n,1579022701.0,"I follow the Pimental/Cedars-Sinai advice for SIBO meal spacing in addition to low-fodmap. Meals 4-5 hours apart, no snacking, last meal 4 hours before bedtime and fast for at least 12 hours at night. 

In practice, for me this has evolved into 2 meals a day to least 4 hours apart, plus 14:20 or 16:8 intermittent fasting. 

When it comes to stackingit I bear the following factors,in mind:

1. I try not to eat more than one portion of fodmap containing food in a “safe“ portion size per day. 
2. I’ll often eat less than the green portion size limit- so 50g rather than 75g to give myself an additional margin of error.
3. I’ll be a bit more lenient with foods that have a wide margin of error e.g. something that has a green portion size of 75g, a yellow portion size of 200g and a red portion size of 350g than something where the green portion size if\]s 50g, the yellow is 60g and red is 75g.
4. I also know which of the fodmaps I am most sensible to (lactose, fructans and sorbitol) and which I am less sensitive to and bear that in mind.
5. If I do ever eat more than one type of fodmap containing food in a day but in separate meals it’ll be from the groups I’m less sensitive to and the two foods won’t have fodmaps from the same group.
6. I regularly have ”firebreak” days, where I eat no fodmap containing foods. Sometimes this will be for 2-3 days or even a week. I don’t do it on a schedule, I just keep an eye on what I’ve been eating and how I’m feeling."

1. Changed my colour palette a bit. So for me that was mostly black, charcoal grey, silver grey, lavender with some tartan/tweed/plaid thrown in.
2. Wore more pulled together outfits. So usually all one colour and definitely paid attention to silhouette.
3. Swapped trainers for ballet pumps or low wedge heeled suede maryjanes or flat knee boots.
4. Lots of fine knit sweaters. At a Scottish University it‘s winter for most of term. And those old buildings are drafty.

FODMAPS,fdqcooo,t1_fdpxaah,1578663111.0,"I found low FODMAP really tricky to get a handle on in practice. A bit of experimentation and personalisation has helped a lot for me. It also took me a long time to work out how not to stack foods in a meal or across a day. 

And tinkering with portion sizes helped a lot- the app says “most people with IBS will tolerate this portion size”. It helped to realise that I’m not always most people. I’m a pretty small person, so maybe a portion for me is a bit smaller than a taller person for example. It can also be worth working out which of the FODMAPS you are most sensitive to.  I have to be strictest with things containing fructans and sorbitol- I can manage about half the Monash portion on those. Dairy I need avoid nearly everything except the occasional pat of butter because I react badly to lactose and also casein. Mannitol, fructose and GOS I can manage the Monash size portion pretty much. 

I also keep an eye on the difference between the “safe” portion and amber or red portion on the app. If there is a narrow margin of error I’ll play it really safe with quantities. Just because agriculture isn’t a totally standardised process- different soil or weather conditions can affect the nutritional profile of things.

Some of the foods you mentioned would just kill me. The things that stand out are:
Genius bread-does this mean you’re in the UK? I’ve found they’ve added things like pea fibre to a lot of their stuff lately. I get on a lot better with Schar stuff, especially the things with the blue Monash sticker on it. 

Coconut milk and cheese can be tricky for me. Coconut milk from a can or carton is impossible if it has any gums or thickeners (carrageenan etc) in it, and if I find one free from those then only a tiny amount on the odd occasion. Also, a lot of coconut cheeses have things like ‘natural flavouring’ in them and lord only knows what that is.

Peanuts and corn I have to be really careful with quantities. 

It also helped to keep fat to roughly 20g per meal as fat affects gut motility and to keep an eye on overall sugar content of meal (even “safe” sugars). 

Good luck!"
FODMAPS,fdqahwx,t3_emkj5h,1578661177.0,"It could be a few things- meaning it’s not all the same mechanism that’s giving you a reaction. 

I’ve had issues with most of these at one point or another. Except guava, but I don’t like it so I haven’t eaten it really. Coming at it from a few different angles helped me. 

So GERD/high acid is one angle. That covers a lot of them. I found watchingbprtion size beyond what Monash says is safe helped a lot with that. So I can have a little bit of tomato in a salad, but not a tomato sauce on pasta. 

Sometimes I have to watch overall sugar content. When I’m stressed or ill or tired I need to not go over 5g total sugars per meal. If I’m relaxed, in good health, exercising regularly I can have more- up to 50g as a one off (like a party or something) and 10-20g per meal. Even then, I try not to eat any meals high in sugar more than once a day, and I never eat fruit two days running. For example, I can eat half a small orange or a small handful of grapes, not the Monash portion sizes.

Sometimes I also have problems with skins and pips. I find I can tolerate cucumber if I peel and deseed it ( then cut it into batons). Really have to watch how fresh cucumber is for some reason. And I can eat grapes if they are seedless (in a small portion). Strawberries I can handle a small amount, very occasionally, so I tend to leave them for when they are in season locally and smelling delicious, then only have a few. And with tomatoes, I’ll sometimes skin them or discard the seeds if I feel like I’ll have trouble with them that day. With peppers, which you don’t mention but which are a common trigger for GERD, I either roast and skin them or buy those thin skinned long and pointy Romano ones.,

Carrots I can handle if they are cut into slim batons, cooked well and dressed with a little lemon or lime juice and some oil. I cannot really handle them raw at all. And my ideal portion size is more like 40-50g rather than a standard 75g portion. I also like to slice them really thinly with a vegetable peeler and add them to stir fries. 

I do find with some foods (carrots, tomatoes in particular) a little lemon or lime juice on them helps. I read somewhere that some foods give you GERD not because they are acidic in themselves, but because they are difficult to digest, then your body goes into acid production overdrive to compensate, so in those cases a squeeze of lemon or lime or a dash of vinegar (if tolerated) can help you digest those foods. I do squeeze half a lemon or lime over most meals now and it does help. 

I know some people have found that digestive enzymes really help. They gave me a reaction but they did really help a friend of mine.

Hydrogen in itself doesn’t cause problems, it’s just that it does feed the microbes that cause problems. It’s possible to have both hydrogen sulphide SIBO and Methane SIBO.

70%of people with SIBO have it as a result of food poisoning. They produce antibodies for CdtB and /or Vinculin (measurable via the IBS-Smart test).  Anti-vinculin affects gut motility as the body is basically attacking itself (Vinculin is a protein needed for gut motility), so that basically means this type of SIBO is an auto-immune disease.

Methane SIBO seems to be independent of food poisoning. Methane production slows gut motility 60%. You’re either a methane producer or you’re not. However, it is possible to be a methane producer and get food poisoning which developed into SIBO. It’s also possible to be a methane producer and not have SIBO. But if you are a methane producer and get food poisoning that develops into SiBO, your body gets caught in a loop where hydrogen feeds both archea (leading to constipation, and also to the gut not clearing itself out, ideal breeding ground) and also feeding the sulfate reducing bacteria (leading to diarrhoea).

Edit: I’ve heard some discussion about methane production just being an adaptation which confers advantages at times of food scarcity (alongside the slowed guts motility comes increased ability to extract/produce calories from food)."

SIBO,fdiagsd,t3_elehg0,1578438663.0,"I watched a presentation by Mark Pimental today (recorded yesterday) where he pretty much said there’s no such thing as Hydrogen SIBO. There’s Hydrogen Sulfide (diarrhea) and Methane (constipation). It’s possible to have both. And hydrogen does feed the microbes in both, but the hydrogen doesn’t cause problems in itself.

He said more information will follow in May (they have to  wait for peer reviewed publishing before discussing), and typology, testing and treatment will evolve based on this.

I’ve decided to hang fire on treatment and focus on management until the new information is fully out. My last attempt at treatment was pretty disastrous, based on a practitioner not really being up to speed on hydrogen sulfide SIBO, but thinking she was and not really paying enough attention to my symptoms. I’m not keen to waste a load of money and months of my time until the picture is clearer.

In the meantime, L.Plantarum 299v really helps me."

SIBO,fd9u6rt,t3_ekcoei,1578238067.0,"Hello

Sorry to hear you’re having such a tricky time.

So, there are some parallels in my situation. Bad bout of food poisoning during childhood, which, looking back led to some of the strange symptoms and respondent strategies that have followed a bad bout of food poisoning in adulthood. And lots of symptoms (insomnia, anxiety, reactions) between the two periods which would suggest with hindsight that not all was well with my gut.

I am reluctant to go the antibiotic route because I have gut bacteria that show antibiotic resistance markers, so I think I have one shot with antibiotics (bacteria species are more prone to swap elements of genetic code under stressful conditions). So I want to get to the bottom of what’s going on before I try that. As well as the two obvious food poisoning episodes, I want to look into MTHFR and also periodontal Ehlers-Danlos via genetic testing later this year as there are some indicators.

A recent attempt at the Elemental Diet left me in a very bad place- reacting to lots of foods that had previously been safe for me, bad smells, severe abdominal pain, bleeding.

The thing that had really helped by SIBO before the Elemental Diet and also after, is using L.Plantarum 299V. I started taking it pretty much daily about 5 years ago and had achieved a fairly stable place. Then I stopped taking them to prep for a breath test prior to the Elemental Diet, then during the Elemental Diet.

Ended up back where I was 7 years ago after the last bad food poisoning episode (which came after a couple of corses of antibiotics- one long term for skin issues, one short but heavy duty for an infection) re symptoms.

Been on a high dose since coming off the Elemental Duet and I’m getting back to a much better place- have stopped reacting to meat/fish now, can eat a little bit of fruit, many more veggies.

When I first taking it years ago, I took a dose of 20 billion organisms with each meal (so 60 billion a day), then reduced to taking 10 or 20 billion organisms once a day with a meal. I’d take a bit more during times I felt my symptoms were unsettled. After the Elemental Diet, a nutritionist recommended a dose of 60 billion organisms once a day, between meals. It took a month of that to see improvement, which I extended by 2 weeks to make sure. In the next few days I’ll go back to a smaller daily dose.

The other things which have helped are the Low FODMAP Diet. I’ve found elements of Cedars-Sinai and Fast Tract diets helpful too. GAPs and SCD were useless for me. Paleo was a mixed bag- it helped because cutting out gluten and dairy and eating less processed food were steps in the right direction. 16:8 intermittent fasting has also helped (basically 2 meals a day). 5-HTP, D-Limonene, running and abdominal massage have helped with motility.

SIBO,fczjrjy,t1_fczectc,1578102766.0,"Depends what you mean by “eliminating SIBO”. If you mean “relatively symptom free” then I believe diet alone can be an effective management tool.

If you mean cured, then no. To be honest, I think SIBO returns for most people at some point, even if they are “cured” (by which I mean symptom free even when eating freely) by antibiotics/herbals etc.

This could be because there is an underlying medical condition that is behind the SIBO like a faulty ileocecal  valve. With post-food poisoning SIBO, I think Pimental is now saying that you’re at an increased risk of getting food poisoning again and then more post-infectious SIBO, and that risk is for the rest of your life.

Edit: spelling"
SIBO,fcy4mix,t3_ejf1id,1578074697.0,"If you get the antibiotics, you’re better eating a diet that feeds the bad bacteria so they gobble up the antibiotics too. So that would be e.g. higher FODMAP. Or you could take PHGG. 

But if you want to use diet in the absence of antibiotics, that can help manage symptoms but won’t cure it. That would be different from how you’d eat whilst taking antibiotics. So e.g. Low Fodmap, Cedars-Sinai, SIBO-Specific etc.

The Elemental Diet can cure SIBO for some, but it didn’t work for me (made symptoms worse for a good while until I took a long course of L.Plantarum). It’s a liquid diet that is very restrictive, pretty expensive and lasts 8-12 weeks."
