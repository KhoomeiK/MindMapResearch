* Her internal organs
* Her skeleton
* The Sky
* The Ocean
* The Earth
* Gravity
* Light itself
* The day of every beachgoer around her
* Her dignity
* Her self respect
* Her bellybutton
* Her ability to be taken seriously ever again
* The respect of any man who happens to see this picture
* My erection

Really quite impressive."

AskReddit,fextpp2,t1_feui0f5,1579435948.0,"I had this same kind of thing happen to me except for me it was my silver haired mother on her knees at the foot of my bed rolling her head around in circles like she was stretching her neck.  She was facing away from me and all you could see was her hair, not her face.  Luckily by that time I was very well experienced with sleep paralysis as I had it all the time, mine is brought on by pain induced chronic insomnia and I can even begin to tell when its going to happen as I'm falling asleep.  I know what you mean when you say it felt so real, just remember that every single thing you have ever experienced or will experience, real or imaginary, to your brain is the same thing as it is what's responsible for allowing you to interpret reality through your senses.  Some people go through life for years with certain hallucinatory aberrations without even knowing it because they were something benign and easily ignored, your brain is just that good since it does it all the time with everything else."

securityguards,feuar2y,t3_epvrs4,1579384798.0,"Update: I learned since posting that he has been trying to become armed security for the last year, meaning he could have at any time gotten himself a handgun.  Instead, he has decided to blame me for the fact I won't illegally loan him one of my handguns to use for his job until he finally decides to get his own, going so far as to say that my recently deceased father would have done this for him (he absolutely wouldn't have), and that I should want to help him because I haven't been around over the years, not mentioning that its because of my disability which he knows.  So thank you to those that helped me, but I'll be fading into the background again as far as he is concerned.  

Just for context, I have only spoken to him a handful of times in the last 10 years and only just got back in touch with him on a more consistent basis just over two weeks ago.  I guess two weeks is all you need to attempt to guilt someone into breaking the law and risking imprisonment if he actually uses my gun to shoot someone."

HumansBeingBros,fejn16r,t1_fejlpjg,1579180372.0,"I can't for the life of me understand how anything I've said could be used to make the argument that I feel more enlightened than everyone else.  I think you are just a small, petty person who can't accept any viewpoint but your own.  Otherwise you would be able to point to a single thing I've said that supports any of the nonsense you're saying."
HumansBeingBros,fejmk47,t1_fejjvi6,1579179933.0,"Well see that is why I said I think three times now that IF it is at all under your control you should stay for your loved ones.  I understand the desperation that comes with these thoughts, the crushing weight of feeling like nothing will or even could ever get better.  Panic inducing thoughts lending weight to the legitimacy of an action that can never be undone, an action that will forever scar the ones you are leaving behind.  

You have to try to understand that for most people who have these thoughts about suicide, it comes about in many different emotions and degrees of urgency.  Whether you have a bad day out of a thousand bad days and one thing happens that pushes you over the edge, or if it has been (to your mind) a long and thought about process that feels brought on by cumulative events rather than a single well defined one.  The act of committing suicide in itself is the one thing everyone who comes to that decision by different means has in common, and if IF you have any control over whether or not to actually carry it out you should remember that when you have a family, friends, people who love you, that your life does not belong ONLY to you.  You can't take your own life, you can only take it from those people and that is a very selfish thing to do."

HumansBeingBros,fejj94q,t1_fejit7h,1579176601.0,"That is exactly not what I am doing, if you had read my reply to that idiot who ACTUALLY did what you're saying I did you would see that I said "" if it is at all under your control you should never rob your family of your life and love. Why would you hurt someone you care about so badly?""

Meaning no matter what is causing you to be suicidal, the physical ACT of committing suicide if at all under your control, should be avoided solely for the sake of the people who love you.  I think maybe you read his reply and thought it was me."
HumansBeingBros,fejii6s,t1_feji4gv,1579175740.0,"Speaking as someone who literally only posted one single thing and never expected to see this thread again, you should learn how to internet.... or even how to basic conversation."
HumansBeingBros,feji02r,t1_fejgtpo,1579175123.0,"How exactly was what I said being a trashy asshole to them? I said I was sorry for the mans family, but not for the man.  Why would you attempt to justify someones selfish actions or try to mitigate the damage his actions have caused? Just look at all the people in the post, all those people cared for this man obviously.  Yet he decided to harm each and every one of them, for life."
HumansBeingBros,fejhcky,t1_fejgs0c,1579174286.0,"That is incredible, you can encompass the variety and entirety of human existence to your own opinion?  It couldn't possibly be that different people cope with the exact same experience in a number of different ways right?  Seems like you're the one with zero experience with these kinds of things if you think you can boil down something so complex like this to a single opinion for HOW people deal with suicidal thoughts.

It is exactly BECAUSE I know what it is like to be suicidal that I know no matter what is causing those feelings, if it is at all under your control you should never rob your family of your life and love.  Why would you hurt someone you care about so badly?"
HumansBeingBros,fejglhe,t1_fejgaa5,1579173274.0,"I had my military career cut short by what turned out to be a degenerative genetic disorder that has caused me pain daily for the last 14 years.  Unlike you I have actually been in the shoes of someone who at one point thought suicide might be a better alternative than having that pain only get worse over time.  You know what convinced me otherwise? My family and friends.  I knew the pain would be over for me, but for those I left behind the pain would never go away.  You do not do that to the people you claim to care about, and being an indignant child who can only speculate on behalf of people who are no longer alive doesn't help anyone.

I haven't been on reddit long but from the few interactions I have had here, it seems like the overwhelming majority of this sites users are kids with zero life experience or responsibilities, who get offended on behalf of others who never asked them to in the first place."
HumansBeingBros,fejg5ok,t1_fejfs4d,1579172659.0,"Is that right? I'm guessing you have never had to face any kind of hardship your entire life.  People who kill themselves are taking their lives away from the people who loved them, they are dead, they can't feel the pain of loss that their selfish actions will forever haunt their loved ones.  You have no idea who I am or what I have done or been through, but still blindly say I'm the cowardly asshole.  Well I'm not the one that robbed my loved ones of my life and love.

I am sorry for this mans family, but not for him. Suicide is the most selfish thing a person can do."
HumansBeingBros,fejfq5r,t3_epfjdd,1579172030.0,"Anyone who does such a cowardly selfish thing to the people left who loved them doesn't deserve such efforts.

Edit: Btw before you just knee-jerk down-vote, remember that everyone is different, everyone has different views, and if you think suicide ISN'T selfish think of it like this: Suicide is over for the victim almost immediately and forever, but for the people who loved the victim they will remain scarred by their actions for the rest of their lives.  The people in the post above all clearly loved this man, but his actions harmed each and every one of them forever.  Not something you do to the people you love and care about."

Something younger guys should understand is, even in a position where you can put it in as deep as it will go, it only goes in so far.  Even still not every girl enjoys having her cervix beat to shit, and the ones that do you will have certain positions you just flat can't do because if she pushes back unexpectedly, or drops her weight down on you and you bottom out in her with a good inch or two still out, you could very easily break your dick."
