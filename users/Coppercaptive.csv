> Our star ratings are based solely on the content of a dog food label. Nothing else...Please keep in mind that there are many products with 5-star label ratings made by companies who never test their products for nutrient content, disease-causing bacteria (like Salmonella) or deadly mold toxins."
therewasanattempt,fcopidk,t1_fcoovlh,1577838137.0,Those aren't consumer ratings. The ratings they give are based on the opinion of whatever group of sudo-researchers they have at the time. As long as you realize that.

therewasanattempt,fconqts,t1_fcnxgek,1577836842.0,You do know that website is owned by a dentist? They don't actually do any testing. They just talk to people and read articles and recalls.

Most ""standards"" organizations are formed/pushed by the industry leaders because there's 1) a need and 2) they have the resources and experts. This is universal, in multiple industries.

They weren't readily available 15 years ago, so there haven't been any longterm studies. It's ridiculous to me that pet owners are willing to let their dogs be the guinea pigs for these companies."

I do search and rescue. All these organizations that make a living off their dogs feed these big brands. They're healthy, better regulated, and have a ton of research and time behind them. These people feeding all these fad diets don't realize *they* are making their dogs the test subjects or guinea pigs."
