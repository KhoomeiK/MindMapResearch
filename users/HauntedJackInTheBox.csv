musicproduction,fdgkdz8,t1_fdf4kjs,1578400239.0,"The reason why this is the case is not because of the type of mic, but because of the polar pattern. And the polar patterns of dynamic mics are usually quite a bit tighter than the ones on condenser mics (remember that the polar pattern changes with frequency a lot), especially in the treble. This is due to the dynamic mic capsule being physically bigger most of the time. 

Also, you can get closer to the capsule on a handheld mic, which is designed for better plosive protection, and the thing that makes the most difference, almost more than polar pattern, in the amount of direct vs. room sound, is distance. 

I use a high-end handheld condenser for vocals, even though my studio is relatively well treated. It sounds perfect, and the results are as dry as I need them to be. However, the mic is over twice OP's budget, and most cheaper handheld condensers are kind of harsh and noisy, whereas a great dynamic such as the Telefunken will give them better results for a cheaper price.

However, if you *don't* have an acoustically treated room, fancy studio microphones are going to sound pretty crap, no matter how expensive they are.

Lavalier microphones are by almost any measure more accurate than a U87.

The only issue lavs have is positioning and self-noise. Self-noise is an issue in a studio, but no real-world environment will have 26 dBSPL background room noise. Positioning is another issue, since[the frequency response changes and the level of the voice drops around 10 dB](https://www.dpamicrophones.com/mic-university/facts-about-speech-intelligibility).

But this is often, with high-end mics and a high-end digital wireless system, as well as well-placed lav mics, one of the best ways to get a good sound.

They work through an interference pattern that doesn't account for reverberant environments. However, in many circumstances they can sound fantastic. Sometimes even better than an LDC. 

Btw the claim that almost no TV uses ADR and that it never sounds good is very strange. Most films and TV series with extensive visual effects (the most expensive to make) are mostly ADR'd.

Yeah. You can clip your kick or snare if you want, but you should stay away from overprocessing your mix buss as a crutch. If your drums sound wimpy once the guitars come up, that's a mixing issue, not a mastering one. 

A great example of stuff you can make to give the drums more punch even with big guitars:

NO. DON'T limit or clip your mix before you send to a mastering engineer.

You can certainly do some clipping to mix elements as sound shaping, in drums specifically, but unless you know *exactly* what you're doing, you're going to degrade your sound by doing this to a full mix. Let the mastering engineer take care of volume for you."

> the administrative side is shambolic

Have you ever worked for a company where everything is underpaid and understaffed? Administrative issues start to accumulate when people are unable to keep up with work. I almost thought this was a natural state of every company until I ended up working for one that didn't shy away from paying a bit more for structural quality. It can be done, as it was done, even before the age of computers. It just needs to be funded and staffed properly."
