AskReddit,ff7227r,t1_ff6yum0,1579639564.0,">  I don't see any legitimate arguments against it

Let me give you a few then:

\- First of all, baby boys didn't get a say in what happens to a part that belongs to their own body.

\- There's always a chance that the procedure goes wrong.

\- Would it really be that necessary? It's not that common to do in Europe and the men over there don't seem to get infections constantly. If you can just wash it daily, then there shouldn't be any problems.

\- It reduces sensitivity, which may reduce sexual pleasure.

\- It's painful. Just because it happens when you're a baby and now you don't remember it, doesn't mean you didn't feel it at some point.  


>   it does make things look better. An uncut one looks like a dead worm. 

\- You're probably just saying that because you're used to circumcised ones"
AskReddit,ff70ky5,t1_ff6z3v5,1579638717.0,"Just because you don't remember the pain doesn't mean it didn't happen. And I get that it may reduce the chance of getting infections, but they are not that common in the first place (otherwise it would probably be a pretty common practice in Europe as well). So all-in-all I don't see why you should put someone through that, especially without their consent and there is always a chance that it may go wrong. But hey I still respect your opinion for the record though. I just wanted to share my view."
