Ring,fekj1g7,t3_eplwsg,1579201069.0,"They really updated their app recently.... this version of the app may not be the one you’re supposed to be on which would explain the issue.... when you click your device, you shouldn’t see the device page anymore.... it should take you to a scrolling bar of your events. Just FYI! I personally do not like the update :( However, that might fix this issue......"

 is carried through the dust and man... it knocks people down. I have lived here my entire life and I honestly wouldn’t choose to live anywhere else... You want snow? Drive 2 hours to Flagstaff,. Want to go to the beach? Drive 6 hours to California. 

Dust (allergies) and heat are our biggest concerns honestly.. and flash floods..

oddlysatisfying,feihzpq,t3_ep6u82,1579138974.0,My boyfriends mom bought a 50 dollar pillow and the first that got to try it was tiny her Jack Russell Terrier who she later called us laughing/complaining that her butt was the first one to test it.

UlcerativeColitis,feg1eai,t1_feemtcp,1579072780.0,Opposite for me... it always triggered accidents for some reason. Had to sleep on my right side and usually had a pillow between my knees to give my body more support and help promote relaxation

UlcerativeColitis,fdyfnc7,t3_enagby,1578779272.0,"Mornings are the worst!! First thing that happens when I open my eyes in the morning is my stomach... it flips, rumbles and it’s like if you’re not on the toilet right now, then you’re about to have a literally shitty morning. My boyfriend even wrote me a cute note on a piece of toilet paper I got to read in the morning that said, “I love you my favorite pooper”. 

I’d advise rice and scrambled eggs today if it’s a flarey day. And Imodium. I take just half of a tablet or a whole one depending on how bad my stomach is! Otherwise you run the risk of not pooping for a few days, at least that’s what I’ve experienced!"
Ring,fdye4e5,t1_fdx9o7t,1578778746.0,We’ve had to do the same... Amazon just isn’t what it used to be.
Ring,fdydu0s,t3_en98wn,1578778668.0,It’s amazon. They have been posting wrong images of items lately. I order from them for my company all the time and we’ve had to send so many things back twice because both times it was the wrong items. I’ve been in contact with those actual companies. One company had labeled their bins incorrectly. And the others said amazon has been posting their items incorrectly... not sure exactly how that’s possible or what their process is between Amazon posting items and the companies supplying them... but something has definitely been off. Not just with Ring products.

I’m aware there’s a disorder that causes this , too, but coming from someone with colitis, gluten allergies aren’t a bad thing to look into, especially if you’re tired after you eat!"
confusing_perspective,fd6iyx1,t1_fd3fzy2,1578191758.0,This is good to know! Thank you for sharing and for the advice. Yeah we knew to keep the collar right but not too tight. We fit it right under his normal one and he never had fleas. But we were also in a very dusty area of Arizona... ticks and scorpions were the problem here.

confusing_perspective,fd2nd5m,t1_fd2i37c,1578149689.0,What about the powdered collars? I used that for years with my lab German Shepherd mix (pretty much his whole life ...)  he never had fleas but this was 10 years ago. I’m sure in that time frame things have changed a bit. But just curious if they’d still work or if they’re recommended. That collar was great.
