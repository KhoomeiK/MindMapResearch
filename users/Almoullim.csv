PS: For this to actually work you need to find a project that you like and would wanna finish, not something you found online."

Its not only Satrawi though, I‚Äôve been hanging around people from Muharraq these days and in many instances they were using words that I‚Äôve never heard before and couldn‚Äôt entirely understand their conversations at times."
Bahrain,fejq46z,t3_epip02,1579182979.0,"Think of Ajmi as an accent just like we have here in Bahrain. I know Arabic fluently but when I‚Äôm around people from Sitra, I don‚Äôt understand half of what they‚Äôre saying, and there isn‚Äôt a way to learn their words but to be around them and ask them whenever you hear something you don‚Äôt understand. Same goes for Ajmi, learn farsi first, then talk with Ajmi ppl and when they say something you don‚Äôt understand ask them."
typescript,fega4px,t3_eostn6,1579084422.0,I‚Äôve recently released a product with VueJS and Typescript using the Composition-API plugin for vue2. Its easy to setup and works really well as far as i can tell. I think Nuxt does also have support for the plugin so give it a try.

Bahrain,fd245sm,t3_ejt5tl,1578141398.0,"A university will never teach you anything beyond ""basic"" more or less. Never expect to be ready for a job once you graduated university. Computer Science is a really broad subject and universities try to teach you a bit of everything so its really hard to get you to intermediate level let alone advance in that way. Plus, most of the things they teach will most probably be outdated or not applicable in the real world or both.

Pretty much all people working in these fields who are good and well-payed (no connections) are self-taught, so it doesn't matter as much which university you choose.

If you don't know what kind of job you wanna do then try to figure it out now, and if you already do then thats really great. What you should be doing now and during your study in a university is use your free time to teach yourself everything you can about the field you choose to work in. That is the best advice I can ever give you.

As far as I know, Polytechnic does have a basic course on Information Security and another on Ethical Hacking, no idea about UOB.

A starting salary would probably be 400-600 BHD. I'm a programming major and my salary for my first job was 550 BHD"

Bahrain,fcu1tmy,t1_fctw3nc,1577969755.0,"Well, I've been learning web dev and programming by myself for sometime so i already had the knowledge to compensate for the lack of a degree. 

So here i was two years into uni with zero experience, i receive a call for a web dev job interview and that got me a 3 months internship. In the first month i guess i proved im capable so they considered my internship complete and offered to hire me. 

A year into the job I got a call for another job interview and i was hired on the spot. Been working there for 5 months now. Meanwhile while working there I've received 4 web dev job offers which i declined as im happy where i am currently.

So i guess the take away is that in coding, a degree is not always required as most of us with a degree or otherwise are self-taught anyway, and i guess there might be a lack of web developers atm in Bahrain especially with the startups trend we're having now."
