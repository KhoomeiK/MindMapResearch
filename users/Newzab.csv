90DayFiance,fegnfp9,t1_fecswth,1579097973.0,"Man it's hard to know what's going on. They have the usual ""reality TV will boost our brand"" with soap and the jewelry, which I think is misguided. Your point about cute moments on the cutting room floor is a good one. 

Season 1 Mike is a commenter on this sub about the dumb production tricks with him and Aziza to add drama, like staging him talking to some other girls and pretending to be filming outside when they first had sex. That was when they had more normal, if eccentric, people.  


I wonder how far the show will go, like ""Tania, wear this shirt all the time, you're the villain of the season now. You can uh.. spin that into something good for your business.""  


Tania seems beyond the pale. I don't know what the hell is going on. Jasmin and Blake are deluded but the show gives their music/influencer goals make a lot more sense. Maybe they might be taken under the wings of some more well-off hippies, like who have a farm or  something, but then those hippies would want them to work. Syngin could get a sugar mama or a wealthier, nicer hippie chick, but he's got the K-1 issue. Tania isn't getting an edit that's gonna get her the same thing only a wealthy guy who wants babies right away and travels.   


Jeez IDK just speculating. Reality TV attracting people who want fame can be rather toxic (Jon and Kate worst example I can think of) but it's still fun entertainment."

Shitty of him not to come down for her surgery on top of the other dysfunction. Like, that's bad, even if he's got a booze hound sidepiece, it would show some human decency to come down there for her surgery.

I was hoping Dr. Now would tell them both to go to therapy sooner and the therapist would have given Paul a come to Jesus talk too. Maybe he's too far gone, but it would have been something. I mean, they were both doing the same thing to their livers for one thing.

Oh plus, I think John's wife (like a lot of the spouses on this show) met him when he was big but could still get around and do stuff. She and the other spouses didn't see the writing on the wall that that this person would be bed-bound and couldn't work and would need all this care.

People on this thread keep saying that there are a lot of books labeled literary fiction that are trash, and sure, there are, but it's \*our\* trash, we can argue about why it is or isn't trash and why the good stuff is good.

It's probably fine he's on the panel this time, but if you want to call literary fiction a genre, fine, I'm afraid of my genre going away. I'm probably paranoid. Hopefully. But if it was all Lee Childs on this panel, the prize would be meaningless, same as if it were all Harold Bloom types judging a competition for commercial crime books by women of color.

She'll mostly love him for his abs and he'll mostly love her for her tits, but they can bond over  their shared philosophy of ""I love to travel! I'm a free spirit!"""
90DayFiance,fcvs5zp,t1_fcurbsr,1578008888.0,"Yeah I feel dumb he kind of fooled me. He said he kept pictures around cause she was the kids' mother so it made me think that she'd just totally peaced out of the family. 

You don't have to keep pictures of your ex around for your kids! Just don't trash talk your ex to your kids. I bet he did that. But he was so obsessed with his ex and trying to reincarnate Nikki as her. Like not taking a romantic pic of him and his ex-wife out of the bedroom when his fiance arrives?? That was just the tip of the iceberg.

I'm with some other people hoping his ex-wife will try to talk to Nikki. Maybe she has. I don't want anyone to have to associate second hand with Mark, but his ex probably knows something about emotional manipulation and even Stockholm Syndrome. I hope she's living her best life and that Nikki eventually escapes too. She seems like such a nice, fun person. It's awful."
My600lbLife,fctkdiq,t3_eisbpk,1577946418.0,"Great episode! They are from my neck of the woods so extra awesome.

Lonnie's a breakout star; his salon might get swamped with new clients. He and John both seem like really good dudes. It was really wholesome how John walked the walk for his son and wife because a lot of the patients say they gotta change for their families and then don't try very hard. Really great to see him playing basketball with Caleb near the end of the episode."
My600lbLife,fcte0ki,t3_ecxg27,1577940268.0,Just started watching... I'm excited to see some participants from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I like that John's trying to be independent and Lonnie's still working (at a non-desk job! have we seen that before on the show? rarely if ever) so I'm hopeful for them.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fct58l3,t1_fct3ffc,1577933203.0,"Lol that's great! Yeah that makes sense. I had a Spanish and German name back in high school for those classes. Tour guides probably have to make it sound not too goofy, though maybe not. 

My favorite guide's English name was Happy. I rolled my eyes at first but it fit her personality super well and that's not the corniest name. 

Chinese names run together for me because they're unfamiliar like comment above said, but if you start learning the language or getting to know people, it's gotta get easier."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcszjil,t1_fcsv66h,1577929032.0,"I figure you work at it and the new names get familiar eventually though. I just visited China and would have a rough time if I were there for an extended period. I mean with lots of things but just people's names. It's kinda lame that tour guides have English names to use for the tourists, but it makes sense cause you're just with them for a few hours. I felt bad for people who didn't speak English, English speakers are so spoiled. Like I was seriously afraid these South American fellow tourists were gonna get lost in throngs of people."

So like, ""It was just a tool for file sharing and information seeking etc."" rings sort of false to me, personally.

It sucks that's gaming's such an uncivil mess. I remember back in the 90s, some guy was on a news show with a classic NES, showing this port and saying, ""Someday people can connect to the Internet with this"" which sounded futuristic and cool. I know people have made close friends and met spouses with gaming, and just had a lot of fun, which is great. But it's *such* a trash fire. I def think the Internet was more innocent before effing GamerGate."
90DayFiance,fcsy9vf,t1_fcsvxkg,1577928139.0,"The people I work with are very anti-choice, but they do also use the term ""social justice"" in a positive light. I've never asked anyone what exactly that means to them because I don't want to get too political at work. They are big on charity but also very big on protesting at abortion clinics and whatnot.

I know Catholics vary a lot. The term probably means just something somewhat different to the folks I know; they are mostly on the conservative side of the spectrum. I've never seen anyone use it as a reclamation either, but it seems like some conservative people might say ""this is what social justice means to me"" out here on the Internet because of the SJW trope blah blah blah."
CasualConversation,fcsxs8x,t1_fcsrdkk,1577927794.0,"Yeah I mainly hear this from YouTubers, and YouTube was more innocent ten years ago, probably. Though it seems to have had ups and downs with different types of ethics. A lot of these YouTubers are younger people so they don't remember the 90s."

It's hard to know how to help. Maybe a petition for potential tourists to vow to never visit in solidarity with the Australian people? That hurts Joe Blow Australians too I know though.

Your mom sounds awesome and that's a pretty great story! At least that place has security. 

Sort of related because about nursing homes and an affable mom--my boyfriend's mom was a young, 40 something nursing home resident who chose to live there because her MS was getting worse. A couple of 20 something volunteers were visiting and became good friends with her. One of them wound up marrying my boyfriend's sister! I wish I'd gotten to know my boyfriend's mom and that she'd gotten to know her granddaughter who is great and kind of exists because her grandmother's likable personality."
TwoXChromosomes,fcrqu13,t1_fcreod3,1577905382.0,"Yeah and nursing homes have visitors and sometimes volunteers too, so a fairly random assortment of people coming in and out. That's really bad the residents and staff can't get help quickly in a dangerous situation.

I work with very conservative Catholics, and they basically have that in their mission statement and like the word. I know  a lot of it has to do with protesting at abortion clinics, but I think they care about better class equality too. I disagree with them a lot, but I'd work with them on stuff like helping out kids in poverty (while disagreeing that all birth control BAD). Anyway, they do like the term sans warrior so I think it's interesting. There are a lot of young people so some of them probably use SJW as a pejorative online. Or maybe even try to reclaim it I don't know lol. They have to know about the  perjorative for liberal activists."
