buildapc,fee0oaq,t3_eokfwq,1579023931.0,i want to install a graphics card on a PC that i built in 2014 that is currently running intel HD 4600 graphics. i will be using the GPU to edit photos on photoshop CC and lightroom CC. i was looking at the geforce 1650 super overclocked. i also have the option to buy a used nvidia gtx 970 for about 125 dollars. which is the better option or is it better to purchase a card that is more upmarket?
tippytaps,fdsafg0,t1_fds2jog,1578698071.0,"for me to accept the idea that “dolphins are almost as smart as us” i’d have to see results of research that they are an advanced species in the fashion that they can organize democracies, implement industry, produce literature, invent a science that explains the laws of their environment like mathematics and physics, and build upon their already existing knowledge to improve the problems they solve, which is something humans have done over the course of history.

you’re bringing up things that are extraordinary in the animal kingdom, but my problem is that somebody is casually using superlatives to describe something that has yet to be proven to measure up to human intelligence in so many different ways and you can’t just quantify what you just told me as sufficient evidence to the contrary. ...and you’re bringing up my perceived self-assuredness like you didn’t see what happened. the person i responded to dragged it out on me and i’ve been engaging with them."
tippytaps,fdqvoje,t1_fdqtyb2,1578675575.0,"off the top of my head other animals besides dolphins have been documented doing at least two of those three things, so i don’t get this impression that their intelligence is so exceptional as to be almost as high as ours. yes, they’re highly social. yes, they’ve evolved a high level of communication relative to other species. this is not enough to be on par with human intelligence."
tippytaps,fdqtlx6,t1_fdqsvvt,1578674607.0,"you said they are almost as intelligent as us...there’s nothing in this gif that demonstrates that. i’m not advocating for captivity, that’s a completely different discussion. i’m pointing out that you’re giving them way too much credit. among animals we have observed, yes, they do appear to be more intelligent than almost any other, but they don’t understand a level of abstraction nearly to the point that we do. the trick is misleading. dolphins aren’t woke enough to understand pollution and know what material gets sorted into the bin properly labeled in english."

Ancestry,fdpodlh,t3_em7m7j,1578634556.0,"“dago” was an ethnic slur for Italian immigrants living in English speaking countries especially in the late 1800s and early to mid 1900s. It’s possible he didn’t want to be referred to as one bc in those days Italians were considered non-whites in English speaking countries. The word’s origins have been traced to the name Diego, which is known as a Spanish or Portuguese name but it is also an Italian name although it is much less commonly used in Italy. One of my 4x great grandparents going back about 250 years was named Diego and he lived in a village in the Italian countryside about 130 miles east of Rome."

TrueOffMyChest,fc6c2wn,t1_fc6a9dr,1577477086.0,"i speculate on this from time to time. one thing i really believe is that a lot of men/women have no respect for the opposite gender as a human being, and won’t acknowledge any wrongdoing on their part. if someone calls them out on their bullshit, all they do is clap back with “but men/women do the same thing” because they have to suppress the thought dispute that they may be a user."
