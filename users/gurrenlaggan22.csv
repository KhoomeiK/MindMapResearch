videos,ffd65nz,t1_ffcolkr,1579814177.0,"It's not a lie. There is plenty of videos. You just haven't looked for them. How about cops just murdering people for no reason?  Then just saying ""oh well."" I watched a video exactly like that last week. Fuckin sociopaths all of them.
Or how about the video of a cop shooting a little girl in front of the family, then not even attempting to help, because ""oh no a scary little doggo barked at me! Better shoot the kid!"". THEN taking the injured child away and from the family without getting her medical attention.
How about the two cops who turned off the cameras so they could punch a handcuffed woman in chair and bag on her head? Or how about the cop who repeatedly smashed a dudes face into the ground and killed him by putting his knee on his neck, while handcuffed. What about the cop who shot a crying drunk man in the hallway with an AR. Gun had ""Your fucked"" etched into it. Downvote me. ACAB. Fuck em all."

manga,ffbjv97,t3_esl1jg,1579768751.0,How is this manga? I enjoy all types not worried. Like to know if it's a good read? :)

facepalm,fejjxrx,t1_fejjmsc,1579177348.0,"No worries. I'm a giant flat earth fan. And anything flat earth I watch multiple times because the absurdity of it is so unbelievably mind boggling that I can't get enough of it. I even know what is under the flat earth. Oh yes, they have elaborated what ""gravity"" actually is. Truly scientific work at its finest my friend."
facepalm,fejje2f,t1_feixwhe,1579176755.0,$20k. They spent $10k more to see they were wrong and still denied it.

Conservative,fdgkotp,t1_fdeuhjx,1578400548.0,Golly I can only hope someone puts a bullet through trumps empty skull. Here's hoping for a long overdue presidential assassination.
FortNiteBR,fdgh3de,t3_eixvqc,1578396510.0,"Jesus fuckin Christmas. I haven't been able to play for 2 God damn days. I'm currently in a match, not playing, still falling. I've been falling for 10 damn minutes. Can't move, can't do anything. It's starting to piss me off. I even was able to get into a match yesterday, walk around, but literally not do a damn thing, not even run. Ash every 30 seconds it would reload my loading screen, but nothing was fixed. Then was killed by some random person I followed around who couldn't even see me. This is absolute bullshit. This is absolutely ludicrous. It's also crashing my Playstation too. Sometimes when I start fortnite it just turns my entire Playstation off. It's ONLY fortnite."
horizon,fde14d1,t3_eki9ci,1578328811.0,"As someone who sunk 200 hours into FFXV and 200 hours into HZD as well for the harder difficulties. HZD wins, obviously. I know a lot of people had problems with FFXV, and the never ending hate it gets is unfortunate. I don't care how the story was handled, and the combat could have been harder, but I've also never played a FF game that was actually ""Hard"". I saw someone here mention that they could just spam revive and potions, but that's just been almost every FF? I've been playing since Final Fantasy on the Nintendo. 6 was tough. 7,8,9 were moderately difficult. FFX and X-2 were downright easy but I loved them all the same. I liked FFXII and XIII. What attracted me so much to 15 (gonna stop using numerals) was finally what I've been waiting for. No more turn base. Yeah the hack and slash isn't for everyone, but I don't think people really grasped how great it was to no longer be forced into a little cut scene to wait your turn to fight. The monsters were enormous just like FF always delivers, the summons were incredible as usual (although I wish I could just straight up use them). They still gave you your flying vehicle as usual. Had your Cid. Bounties were awesome. Nothing was more satisfying than mid fight, hurling noctis away with from the enemy 3x with his huge sword only to turn around, target, and launch into an attack that did x4 damage to stun and gang up with the bro's. I really do hope they learned from FF15 mistakes for story, keep the massive freedom that combat finally gave you, and come in with either a FF15-2, or move forward with FF16. That's my personal rant to Defend 15. HZD was an amazing experience and loved it multiple times over, I can clearly see why it was the better choice between these two. Glad to know others were still playing FF15 too."
