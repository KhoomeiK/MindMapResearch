TheRealJoke,fewlllm,t1_faolndq,1579413739.0,"That’s why it’s called dark humor. Some people don’t get it. Some people get it and don’t like it. Some people get it and like it. If you think it’s funny, then it’s funny. If I think it’s funny, then it’s funny. if you think a joke is funny but I don’t, that’s too bad for me. It remains funny because you said it was. 

Some people brush up against the guardrail separating Dark Humor and Hate Crime. Written words or jokes that are intended to incite violence against a particular group might be a hate crime. Written words or jokes that threaten a targeted group with planned violence might be a hate crime. Notice I am using the word ‘might’.  I am not a lawyer so this paragraph is just my opinion.

If you like Dark Humor, you have to have thick skin. Even then, you might get offended every now and then but that’s an individual thing. For example, some people like suicide jokes. I don’t particularly like them even though I’ve never known anyone personally who did that. Imagine how it would feel for someone whose brother committed the act.  Deeply offended, right?    But then you have the dead baby jokes. And the priest having fun with the altar boys jokes.  

Aww fuckit..They’re all nasty and unacceptable. Let’s just shut this whole thing down. NOT!"

I didn’t side with the Karen. Reread what I wrote. I didn’t condone her behavior. I focused my comments on the ticket taker. 

I said the kid was wrong for not letting her pass through. I said the kid was wrong for not using common sense. I said the kid did not understand business. 

The world is not black and white. There are grey areas that requires the use of grey matter to navigate. A subway turnstile does not have a brain. No ticket. No pass through. The kid demonstrated that either he has no brain or he doesn’t know how to use the one he has. It won’t be long and there won’t even be movie theaters for dopes like him to work in. But before that happens, his job will be eliminated by a turnstile. Why? Because some people can’t think. 

And I’ll have you know I started out cleaning out the incinerator ( do you know what that is?) worked my way up and paid my own way through college with my own money. Not mom and dad’s. Not the bank’s. I had a 6 figure income by the time I was 35 because I used my brain all the way through. Hit the books hard and learned everything I could about the business I was in. I did every job in the store at one time or another before they turned a $100m per year business with 400 employees under me to run. I’m a paper pusher alright. Mmm-hmm. You sure got me figured out. How old are you, anyway?

I would not have fired that kid. He would not have been hired in the first place. I would have exposed his attitude in the interview process. 

I’m not entitled to anything and neither are you. I worked for and earned everything I have. Do you think you can do that? With your little commentary there it doesn’t seem so. 

One other thing. Were you sleeping in class through high school. The USA is a Republic, not a democracy. Do you know why that is? Our founding fathers knew that the general public as a whole are really not too bright, as you have so aptly demonstrated here. That is why we elect Senators and Congressmen to make the decisions. It’s why we have the Electoral College to elect the President. It’s to prevent the not too bright general public from electing charlatans like Hitler in desperate times. 

Lookie here. I just gave you Business 101 and Govt. 101 in half a page. It’s pretty deep and the words are pretty big, I know. You should thank me for dumbing it down for you.

FuckYouKaren,fctf37b,t1_fctbr3z,1577941230.0,"Yes they do. When they keep trying to scam you is when you stand them down and trespass them. The first time you let it slide. 

Ill have you know the last store I managed we served over 100,000 customers per week. Over $100m in sales annually. So I, too, know what Im talking about. Out of those 100,000 customers we rarely reached 10 per week who tried chest us It just doesn’t happen very often. 

Do you know how much you save by losing an honest customer? As little as a couple of dollars. 

Do you know how much it costs to replace that permanent customer with another permanent customer, just to break even on customer count? Its upwards of $8,000. Its a little harder to measure the damage this Karen can do to the hard earned goodwill of that company. 

You do the math on that one, if you can. 

How do I know this? It’s because I’m edumacated. And experienced. 

Almost every thing I read on Reddit, I’ll admit, is some of the funniest stuff Ive read anywhere. Including the Dark Humor section. Roast me, too. 
The wit and quickness of the people here is amazing and I enjoy it a lot. I do what I think is a lot of ab work at the gym 3-4 times a week. No pain the next day. One evening of reading Reddit humor I laugh so hard the next morning my abs hurt. So, much credit goes to millennials for that, which I assume most of you are. 

I am not that much older than you but I am a successful businessman. This little prick at the ticket taking booth thinks he’s saving me $10 when he’s actually potentially costing me thousands. There’s no profit in selling those tickets anyway. Most of it goes to the movie maker. The theater get a few coins. The profit is in the concessions. You need to let her in, Karen or not, so she can spend $15 for 30 cents worth of popcorn. And $5 for 15 cents worth of coke. I know this and I don’t run a movie theater. 

I’ve had to terminate kids for this exact type of treatment to my customers. Make a mistake, it happens. We can coach and teach you. But be proud of this BS and brother, you are going down. Mess with my paycheck and I will eliminate yours."
FuckYouKaren,fct98yg,t3_eir6ws,1577936291.0,"Juveniles. Have you ever owned your own business? Have you ever managed a business for someone? Do you know how to sustain a business? Do you know what cost/benefit ratio means? 

I would bet NO is the right answer to those questions. 

Do you know how to be an asshole? 

I would bet YES is the correct answer. 

This little ticket taker cop was obviously bothered by it. He worked the rest of the day. It still bothered him after work as evidenced by his writing about it here. 

If he would have just let the woman in like a person with a brain would have she probably would have said thank you and that would have been the end of it. But no. He couldn’t do that. He had to bring out the worst in himself and the woman.
