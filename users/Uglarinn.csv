We left to go get some food and come back. His mom got pissed off that we left the air conditioner on, so it would stay cool, so she took one of his knives and cut the chord to the A/C.

Oh and he was living in a shed, with no insulation."

My absolute favorite novel of all time is Dune! I really love the whole Dune series, honestly, but the first two novels are my favorites!

For my second book, I would say The Lord of the Rings Trilogy/The hobbit. Not exactly all one book, I know (though it could be argued it was supposed to be one book), but no other books I have read compare in terms of how impactful the works of Tolkien have been.

Bonus 3rd Novel. I am a huge fan of Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein!"
