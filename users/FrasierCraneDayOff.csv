It's none of the client's business and doesnt reflect well on your company. It's really not a surprise that the client left after seeing you fire someone. It's pretty awkward to witness, the client may feel partly responsible, and they definitely may lose trust that you're running a good operation.

That doesn't make you an asshole though, just giving a minor business tip :)"

>$136k in lost discounts because that money was in taxable or 529 accounts instead of home equity and retirement accounts.

Well it wouldn't be that much because you'd be spending it down as you go. Also, I don't think they usually give 17k/yr of aid to students, but more like 6-9k. But if you are able to save 300k in a taxable or 529 by the time your kid goes to college, there's a good chance you aren't middle class though."

>savings reduces grant aid so the money is better put towards paying off the house while maxing retirement accounts every year.

529 savings only count for a max of 5.64% towards your assets or some small number, so it doesn't reduce grant aid all that much. The first 20k is exempt as well. So if you have 30k saved, you'd lose out on $564 of grant aid. If you had 30k saved up, you have a good chance of having gotten more than $564 in state tax breaks as well."

Further, because of hedonistic adaptation, I prefer to start with cheaper cars in your earlier years, then get better cars as you get older. It's easier to go from a 20k car to a 45k car than it is to go from a 45k car to a 20k car.

On a personal note, when Caitlyn Jenner first publicly changed genders, I'll admit I was pretty skeptical of it, but seeing it discussed here completely changed my view.

This guy's explanation in the comment on the linked, more balanced, wsj article seems to be a fairly reasonable explanation :

>The capital markets rely on the repo markets to fund leverage. Meaning, a bank can buy treasuries and then offer these treasuries at a ""haircut"" less than 100% of market value and receive a 1 day or more loan on this collateral.

>The bottleneck in the system is investment banks no longer really exist and have been replaced by money center banks ""too big to fail"".

>The current repo market is archaic and has been devastated by regulation making it ineffective.

>The reason the Fed does not lend directly to non-dealers is to protect the Fed from undue risk.

>Therefore to solve the repo market volatility, and to ensure all the excess capital is utilized in the US economy, the Fed needs to support an electronic market place where treasuries can be used as collateral for capital.

>The benefits are enormous in achieving a digital marketplace for US treasuries and excess capital. It keeps treasuries in demand and provides capital for those that have collateral while removing risk for the Fed.

>The genius of the futures market is the risk is removed systemically by the market operator, think CME.

>The Fed should not be the operator of a digital repo market but rather the regulator.

>The Fed's tools would not change.

>The Fed could enter this digital repo market either adding reserves or taking them away much like it did before 2008. 

>The challenge for the Fed is the excess supply of capital would drive rates to 0% plus any transaction cost. So if the Fed wanted to continue to artificially raise rates by paying 1.55% interest on excess reserves (IOER) the Fed could not afford to pay globally. 

>I believe that is good because I recognize the value of allowing the Natural Equilibrium of Interest Rates to be 0% to promote growth and reduce inflation expectations to 0%.

>BTW the Fed's 2% goal is a fools errand. 

>Lastly, having a digital repo market that the Fed could monitor in real time helps the Fed understand and manage the capital markets and the economy.

That explanation rings more true to me than ""socialism for those rich wall street dudes"" which is what the original article said without much elaboration.

fatFIRE,feo1syf,t1_fendvvs,1579294014.0," I think using an expected return is more appropriate in this situation. The reason swr (3%) is much lower than expected returns (7%-8%) is that it has to account for inflation and a potential market crash in the beginning. By pushing your start date back, you get an expected 7%-8%, as you don't have to ""withdrawal"" less for fear of a market downturn at the beginning. If you use that  3%, you're essentially starting your withdrawal even though you won't be withdrawaling, which doesn't really make sense.

For example if you worked 1 more year then retired, and your portfolio dropped to 3 million, wouldn't you use the swr based on that 3 million number or would you just use that 4 million from last year?"

Your analysis is spot on. This is what makes part time work so much more appealing if possible. OP can get an expected 320k of market gains if they can work a highish paying part time job to roughly cover living expenses (while saving very minimally to nothing). I did this for about 5-7 years, loved the work life balance, enjoyed my work more, and my net worth and swr nearly doubled. If you somewhat enjoy your job, going part time is amazing for FI people."

If you are rebuilding credit, right on the edge of 760, or are planning to get a loan soon, yeah don't close cards. For many of us that will have good scores our whole life, it doesn't matter.

Agreed. Parents routinely ask their kids to smile for phone pictures when they are spending no money. They also don't post many non smiling family pictures on fb. It's just the nature of personal photos. The photographer would be doing bad work if he couldn't get the kids to smile.

Further, passport photos are for police purposes, so they don't want the most natural photo possible."

BTW, I don't recommend you do this until you have significant assets where you can comfortably self insure. My personal rule of thumb is if your net worth is 10x your cars value, you can probably afford to self insure, but you have to come to terms with the fact you might be out 15k tomorrow. 

So far, I've probably saved around 1.5 new cars by self insuring, so as long as I don't get really unlucky, it will probably stay ahead for the rest of my life."
