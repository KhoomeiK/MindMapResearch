GetMotivated,few7ddb,t3_eqhr0b,1579406397.0,"Yup. This happened to me. I decided against my parents wishes and went to an art school. Graduated and couldn‚Äôt find work at 22. I got accepted into university for engineering. After 3 years, I flunked out and went into the military. Again, things didn‚Äôt go smoothly and my dad got really ill. That‚Äôs when it clicked and decided I wanted to be an oncologist. Took courses to fill my prerequisites, got into an Ivy League medical school, well known pediatric hospital for residency and now in my first year of my oncology fellowship."

I‚Äôm sure some don‚Äôt intend to be racist but it comes across that way. Things like, waiters or locals approaching you in a less friendly manner. Not wanting to converse. You can really tell by their non-verbals.

When I travel solo and these feelings emerge of wondering ‚Äúwas that racist?‚Äù I almost feel guilty in thinking that it was. It‚Äôs best to ignore it, don‚Äôt let it spoil your trip.
