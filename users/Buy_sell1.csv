OurPresident,ffaa5n4,t1_ffa0bt1,1579730882.0,Agree on the first point in principle. But if deficits are not reigned in you won’t have a much of a country after financial markets punish the currency. It may not happen soon but at some point $ will not be a sought after reserve currency of the world and then we will just get treated like Zimbabwes and Venezuelas of the world. Our debts are already over 100% of the GDP. It’s crazy but all politicians seem to do is up our deficits when economy is bad (this is not bad as you said for a common good we can up the deficits to stimulate the econmy) but when economy improves they do a round of tax cuts arguing expansion will be revenue-neutral causing even bigg er deficits.
OurPresident,ff9wdv3,t1_ff9ttdy,1579722961.0,But two wrongs don’t make it right correct? If this keeps up we will be running $1 trillion deficits forever. We are swimming in debt and the only we can fund this is to roll back the last couple rounds of tax cuts and increase taxes on top 60-70% of population. I am not against  Bernie’s arguments about people needing affordable health care (as so many people are dying or getting bankrupt just to pay for their health) and affordable college education so poor people can pull their families out of poverty. But there is no way to pay for this except increasing taxes on everyone (yes this includes rich -top1% and middle class)
OurPresident,ff9vq0d,t1_ff9p4er,1579722546.0,Don’t understand people downvoting this guy. It’s an honest question he asked.
OurPresident,ff9vhuw,t3_esea66,1579722395.0,"Frankly, three is no way out of the mess we have created over the last 40 years unless we feeeze (even cut) federal spending and increase taxes on rich, upper middle and middle class. There have been no of bipartisan congressional commissions to tackle budget deficit issues before and none of their recommendations get implemented. Both parties just kick the can down the road. Even before promise of larger benefits like single payer health care or massively subsidized college education get implemented, everyone (not just the rich but more like top 60-70% of Americans) will have to pay higher taxes to just balance the budget."

SandersForPresident,ff9gmn1,t3_esatd2,1579712594.0,Don’t have a horse in this (yet) but how is Bernie (27%) joining Biden (24%) “atop”? Bernie is leading Biden by 3 points. Biden has moved to second place. This is just dishonest.  Joining at the top is only valid if they both polled same % amount.

todayilearned,fdtchb2,t1_fdkua1i,1578714797.0,You are correct about him dying recently but he did vote in last election. Election commission had to set up a polling station just for him because there is a law that a polling station has to be accessible by all voters in India within 1.5 kilometers of their residence.

relationship_advice,fc5uokq,t3_eg3q65,1577466295.0,Consider yourself lucky and blessed. You got to find out how your BF and his family is deep-down. Lot of people don’t get to see it until it’s too late. Based on this you need to ask yourself “ do I need to be part of this type of values and behavior for every holiday each year of our relationship?” Act upon the answer you get from that question.
