AskReddit,ff6mrpn,t1_ff5qbl3,1579630523.0,Better to fight naked.  Less to grab onto.  I also coat myself in bacon grease before bed just in case I have to wake up and fight off an intruder - he will have a hard time grabbing hold of me - like a wet dolphin...a delicious smelling wet dolphin.
sportster,ff51gm9,t3_ernae1,1579577663.0,I am 5 ‘ 11” with a long torso and ride a 48.  I feel fairly comfortable but I only ride to and from work (20 miles per day) and around town.  I’ll be upgrading to a fat bob by August because my ride is going to be about 2 hours per day after my move and I want a larger fuel tank and more power and better suspension for the longer ride.

Whatcouldgowrong,fcnvdc2,t1_fadec0z,1577819177.0,Passing between cars between lanes is called lane splitting and is legal on a lot of places but at that speed it was not safe or wise.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcnuysp,t1_fa4bpk2,1577818941.0,Yeah because we all literally do this.  And car drivers never do.  It’s not like I see car drivers texting while driving or speeding every single day while out riding.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcnut4p,t1_fa3uby0,1577818849.0,It’s been shown to be safer than having motorcycles sit in traffic and it reduces road congestion.  Works great in California

Whatcouldgowrong,fcnudxy,t1_fa2oppk,1577818607.0,It is safe if done at appropriate speeds.  What is definitely not safe is sitting in traffic between two cars.

OP titled his post “fighting racism with racism” on top of the guy’s joke about a racist Amish woman. How was the guy being racist?

Edit:  rereading your comments I think you might be confused here.  This was posted in /r/facepalm with the title “Fighting racism with racism”.  I took a screen shot including the original title with my own title “/r/facepalm poster thinks Amish is a race”."
facepalm,fcio128,t1_fcin2qz,1577665858.0,It was sarcasm
facepalm,fcio04a,t1_fcimw7t,1577665844.0,Accusing someone of being racist isn’t racist though.  If the jokes were about her being white it would make sense.
facepalm,fcimo0z,t1_fcid3he,1577665123.0,"Then how is he being racist?  Accusing someone of being racist because they clutched their purse when you walk by is not racist.  That shot happens and is common.  I’ll admit that there is a possibility that she does that with all men, but he isn’t being racist."

facepalm,fche9mb,t1_fchbfzm,1577649656.0,"Or, and hear me out, you are disturbingly obsessed with a teenage girl.

Edit:  You changed your reply.  Lame.  You originally said “op mentioned religious nut jobs so related”"

oakland,fcb4w3z,t1_fcaw04n,1577582384.0,"They are a conservative leaning cult who:

* opposes LGBT rights and believe god plans to eliminate gay people
* supports Donald Trump and believes he was sent by god to destroy Chinese communism
* convinces poor rural folks in china to seek treatment through prayer and to give the cult the money they would have used on doctors - their practitioners frequently die from treatable diseases.  
* claims that biological evolution is fraudulent 
* believes in separate heavens for each race
* believes that aliens control humans by making them dependent on modern science
* runs newspapers like Epoch Times

What is worse is that almost all of the sources for China's alleged organ harvesting originate with Falun Gong and western media consumes it without criticism.   

The primary source is the China Tribunal which claims to be an independent tribunal into forced organ harvesting from ""prisoners of conscience in China"".  The China Tribunal, according to its own website, was “initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), an international not for profit organisation, with headquarters in Australia and National Committees in the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.”  

You can go to the ETAC's website to see its staff and you will just see pics with names and positions.  So like the executive director and co-founder is Susie Hughes; Margo MacVicar is named as the New Zealand national manager; Rebecca James is the UK national manager for outreach, and so on.

If you follow these names you will see the connection to the Epoch Times.  For example,

Susie Hughes has photographer credits on several Epoch Times articles. 

Margo MacVicar has [numerous articles](https://www.theepochtimes.com/author-margo-macvicar) gushing about Shen Yun, Falun Gong’s traveling dance show. 

Rebecca “Becky” James shows up [organizing a Falun Gong art exhibition in Bristol](https://www.theepochtimes.com/international-art-at-bristols-island-gallery-uk_1478588.html) and [sharing vegan drink recipes](https://www.theepochtimes.com/5-vegan-drinks-to-try-this-winter_1926921.html).

ETAC’s UK national manager for initiatives, Andy Moody, is [credited by Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/europa/londons-lord-mayor-new-years-parade-a660905.html) as a reporter for its sibling NTD, or New Tang Dynasty Television, Falun Gong’s TV arm. 

ETAC’s UK communications coordinator Victoria Ledwidge appears in [another Epoch Times article](https://www.theepochtimes.com/shen-yun-to-begin-its-european-tour_2759102.html), coming to greet Shen Yun performers in London and, of course, acclaiming the “amazing” performance.

As one goes down the list of ETAC management, these Falun Gong connections spring up for almost everyone. ETAC is very clearly a Falun Gong front group and their claims about China have made it into the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nightmare-of-human-organ-harvesting-in-china-11549411056), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/06/18/china-killing-prisoners-to-harvest-organs-for-transplant-tribunal-finds/#5c51bd0d53d4), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/china-is-harvesting-organs-from-detainees-uk-tribunal-concludes), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-religious-ethnic-minorities-uighur-muslim-harvest-organs-un-human-rights-a9117911.html) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-organ-harvesting/un-urged-to-investigate-organ-harvesting-in-china-idUSKBN1W92FL)."
RVLiving,fcalbub,t1_fcaf3ro,1577571493.0,"If trying to be calm, patient, and kind is being a “snowflake” then I guess I try to be one - I don’t always, or even often, succeed.  Never saw those characteristics as a weakness though.  It seems to me that it takes more willpower to stay calm in situations like you described than it does to fly off the handle.  Your words here show that it seems like something you struggle with."

facepalm,fc3xuvj,t1_fc3sqw4,1577401427.0,My point is that the religious aspect is traditionally there and it’s us that push it out - which is totally fine.  But to me when you say “push a religious aspect” it comes off as something put there out of nowhere.
facepalm,fc3rsh4,t1_fc3q41x,1577396997.0,"I am about as atheist as they come, but Christmas and Easter are religious holidays that we non-believers celebrate out of nostalgia and tradition.  To suggest that people “push a religious aspect to it” is absurd.  These two holidays exist in most parts of the world because of Christians.  You likely celebrate them because one of your ancestors was Christian.  Even the pagan roots of these two holidays are religious, albeit not Christian."
