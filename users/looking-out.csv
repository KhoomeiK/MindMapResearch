australia,ff50ggp,t1_ff4el9y,1579576919.0,"> There’s no level of hard work that can replace being in the right place at the right time.

There is a quote I love that goes:

**""I wish you luck. Luck is useful. Often you will discover that the harder you work, and the more wisely you work, the luckier you get. But there is luck, and it helps.""**

I feel like it takes into account both ""right place, right time"", but also that your work ethic is what can get you into those positions. I worked hard, and I scarified fun times and easy options, and now I'm earning more than I expected, in a position I didn't think I'd be in. It was ""dumb luck"", I just happened to be in the right spot when the institution restructured. But I was actually offered the chance, because I had taken on a few extra responsibilities in my casual job, that meant I was attending certain meetings, where someone else saw me being professional, friendly, and willing to contribute. I wasn't even working ""that hard"".

I was accidentally in the right place, at the right time. But my attitude to my job at the time was what convinced someone I didn't work with to give me a good opportunity."

If you have knowledge in your head, but you don't know how to use it, have you really learned? If someone can recite a list of facts, but can't answer a single question about any of them, have they learned?

AskWomen,fdlnkus,t1_fdl0uhd,1578528089.0,"I had irregular periods for ages. They were long, there was spotting, they happened anywhere between 3-12 weeks weeks apart. My average period was 8-9 days bleeding.

Around 18-19 I went on the pill. That was alrightish. But if I ever messed up, it was a nightmare. I had bleeding for 6 weeks at one point, rough. I went off my BC at one point, and my period didn't come back for 4 months. My Dr was concerned.

Then I got the hormonal arm implant at 20ish. For the first two years I didn't really get periods. That was great. The third year they started coming back, and were irregular (because implant). I always had other symptoms on the hormones as well that weren't good. I had it removed when it expired and didn't replace it at 23.

Now, at 24 and BC-free, my periods are okay. They're not like super trackable, but I have a range I can guess in. Cycle of 25-30 days, and bleeding for 4-5 days. My SO says my overall mood has improved as well, I seem happier. It was about 4 months after going off hormones that it started to balance out.

Your body will change a lot between 13-25, so if you've been repressing periods for a long time (which is fine), don't be completely afraid to try going off of all the hormones for like 6 months. To simply evaluate your non-BC experience *now* because it might have improved since your teens. It also gives you a bar to rate against when you're deciding if a BC is worth it or not. I put up with a lot because I didn't want to experience the symptoms I was having in my teens. But now I'm happy with my normal cycle symptoms (most of the time).

I recommend getting an app that lets you note down your cycle and symptoms, it gives you something to compare to if you decide to trial BC-free. You might have to wait out a few months (like 4-6) before your cycle ""settles"" after going off."

If you're already calorie counting and it's not working, you might not be measuring stuff correctly. Try using a kitchen scale to weigh everything you can, as accurately you can.

If you crave snacks all the time, prepare things like carrot sticks for you to munch on after working out. Drink water. 

Also, new exercise can mask any weightloss you have. When we start an exercise program, our body starts to store more fluids in our muscles as it adapts. It could be several weeks before this balances out, depending on your calorie deficit. 

Exercise can only really boost your weight-loss, IF you also have a calorie deficit."

writing,fcaebxw,t3_egs1rn,1577567780.0,"My strategy to start to overcome this was to do Camp NaNoWriMo last July and I challenged myself to write flash fiction every day for a month. 

I basically wrote a minimum 500 words every day. I would go to a website I liked and pick a new writing prompt, and then I would smash out at least 500 words. The next day I would either continue the story if I felt like it, or I would open a new document, pick a new prompt and write 500 more words.

When I got stuck or was too tired to write fiction, I would just write 500 words of reflective journalling. This helped me generate new ideas as well, and kept me in the habit. I followed the idea of ""write what you know"". I basically wrote a stream of thought about something that was on my mind that day, e.g. mixed feelings about my job, and in some cases these feelings and ideas fueled scenes I wrote later. 

The result of this, was that I got more comfortable with writing garbage. It didn't matter if I wrote something good or bad because I didn't have to go back to it. I practiced coming up with good ideas, funny ideas, stupid ideas. I wasn't wasting time, because it was a part of my challenge anyway. 

Then, I did NaNoWriMo in November. This was a huge challenge for me. The most I'd ever written was 20k in a month and that was just random flash fiction. But I took the same principles in and I successfully finished 50k in a month. 

I realised that it was fine for me to write stuff that would never end up a part of a final draft. I just wrote whatever stuff I though was relevant to the story, and I figured I could cut out anything I didn't like later. 

I also stopped expecting that the story I wrote for NaNo would be anything other than a NaNo project. I didn't plan to write a ""good story"" I just wanted to win NaNo and practice. I actually just picked one of the flash fiction pieces I liked and mashed it with another idea and just ran with it. My story is totally word soup, but I learned *so much* from writing it. 

I wrote a lot of shit. I wasted a lot of time. But I'm now so much further ahead than I would have been. I have an anxiety disorder, and deciding that first drafts don't matter has been transformative to my writing goals. 

I highly recommend spending a couple weeks writing a super shit short story every day. Just 500 words every day makes all the difference. It also helps you to start getting story ideas down, so you see what shape they start to take, and decide if you like where it's going."

The issue with pedophillia isn't so much the feeling, as it's the fact you cannot have a consensual, healthy relationship with a child. Similarly, child pornorgaphy is an issue because it's all part of a whole network of child abuse and exploitation.
