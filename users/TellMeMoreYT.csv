wisconsin,fekqcdg,t1_fekp1qh,1579205419.0,"How do you figure? Instead of saying I'm wrong twice tell me **how** I'm wrong.   [Here is the source my comment came from.](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/14/why-is-legal-weed-so-expensive-low-supply-high-demand-and-big-tax-driving-chicagos-pricey-pot/) The meat of the cost and taxes is more than halfway down under ""A Complex Tax System""

Starting with your numbers: $55 for the lowest grade flower. +20% tax = $66. I can get that at ""street value"" for here for $35.  So yeah it's *almost* twice as much for the lowest grade. Most high grade dispensary weed you're paying $80+ an eight after tax where as street value is around $40+. I feel like we're splitting hairs here and the point of my original comment was just that it's super expensive. We agree there."
wisconsin,fekhwmj,t1_fek5wof,1579200392.0,"Products with THC level at or below 35 percent are subject to a 10 percent tax. Products with a THC level above 35 percent are taxed at 25 percent. All cannabis infused products, like edibles, are taxed at 20 percent.
Those rates are in addition to local and state sales taxes, which is a combined 10.25 percent in Chicago. And in July, an additional cannabis tax of 3 percent will take effect there. Cook County could also tack on another 3 percent tax, as the proposed county tax is currently being considered by the Board of Commissioners.
So, customers who buy a high THC product from a Chicago dispensary right now are hit with a 35.25 percent tax. In July, that tax could soar to 41.25 percent. 

Chicago is the extreme, but until demand calms down it's going to be expensive for quite some time. Most 1/8ths in this area are sold for $35 or $40 on the street."
wisconsin,fekgvc4,t1_fek5wof,1579199779.0,Yeah I see that. I'll just wait until the supply catches the demand. Prices should drop a little. Also more dispensaries will be popping up soon. One of the reasons it's so expensive is because there is only one within an hours drive from me.

ShitMomGroupsSay,fef1s53,t1_fef0sns,1579046155.0,">You would never get prescribed any of these things 

You **can** get prescribed things that are over the counter such as your example hydrocortisone. I'm not saying it's a conspiracy. I'm saying that there are some things that can help you that are not prescribed because it's not in the best financial interest of the industry. 

>Doctors frequently recommend that their patients try these things

I disagree with this generalization. Doctors will prescribe antibiotics or pain killers in place of letting a cold pass or a strained muscle rest. Doesn't mean they are wrong or shouldn't 100% be listened to. I'm just saying that no one from Pfizer is going to tell you to take tumeric instead of their antiinflammatories, and majority of family doctors would agree with them."

ShitMomGroupsSay,feed9e9,t1_feebbob,1579031370.0,True. I know this wasn't targeted at me. People should just remember that pharma companies can't patent anything that is 'naturally occuring' therefore sometimes we don't get prescribed things that might help us...because there is no money in it.
