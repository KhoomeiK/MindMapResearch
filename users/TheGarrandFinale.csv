whole30,fczi8hl,t1_fczhir9,1578101825.0,"Sure thing, I’m on mobile so sorry if the format is messy. 

I got all ingredients from Sprouts. 

Organic Broccoli:
• cooked at 425 for ~7 mins or until they start looking brown on top. 
• pour a bit of olive oil onto a cooking tray and lay broccoli on top.
• I seasoned with cayenne pepper and salt. 

Ground Sausage:
• the brand I used is Swaggerty’s it’s all compliant with whole 30. 
• throw on a skillet and chop up into small pieces with a spatula until all pieces are cooked to a nice light brown (basically I just made sure there was no red/pink)
• seasoned with garlic. 

Tomato Sauce:
• the brand was Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Tomato Pasta Sauce


I just poured everything into a bowl and mixed it up. It’s the first thing I’ve made since starting that made me want to make more, it’s definitely going to be a keeper. 


EDIT: I just sauce that you said SAUCE recipe lol, well there’s everything I did laid out for you."

AskReddit,fcbqhm5,t1_fcbqbuz,1577589846.0,Nice. The outdoor movie theater that is in the movie burned down years ago and the community was really disappointed by it. It was pretty historical.
