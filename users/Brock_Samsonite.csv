You need to think of the context within those stories and the brutal occupation that the Romans had on the region.  Part of this meant soldiers would run wild and do bad stuff to citizens in public because they could. This included stuff like rape.  

Due to these conditions, people did mental gymnastics regarding fidelity, and conception.  Remember that the Bible didnt exist back then, these stories hadnt been collected."

funhaus,fd3rjiu,t3_ejxbco,1578161058.0,"I have a pretty cool story about Filter and ""Hey Man, Nice Shot!"" the song James was playing at the end.

I was deployed to Iraq for 15 months back in 2008.  Part of helping make that not suck were these USO tours, where celebrities would tour combat zones performing for troops.  I usually ignored these, I didn't have time and they were typically country artists.  These tours were far and few between, but the benefit of being on a larger base meant consistent tours.

&#x200B;

I don't recall the actual date, but it must have been towards the end of my tour when Filter played.  This was my first ""real"" concert.  My mom took me to see DC Talk when I was younger, but this was my first real Rock N Roll experience.  Filter took the stage and started jamming out.  They opened up with ""Welcome to the Fold"" without Richard Patrick (the lead singer) on stage.  He came out when his part started and stole the rest of the show.  Filter proceeded to perform in front of hundreds of service members, in Iraq, in a combat zone, in 2009.  They didn't open up with grandiose statements of praise for us.  They opened up with what we missed from home.

Richard did eventually talk to us.  I'm paraphrasing here but, 'We went to the DFAC (Dining Facility) and we heard some fighting.  Our escorts rushed us inside, and made sure we were safe, but I was pumped.  That shit got close!  I thought to myself, ""that was a pretty nice shot.""  I thought to myself..'I wish I would have met you...'' and proceeded to play ""Hey Man! Nice Shot!""  Easily the best introduction to a song I've heard then or since.  I remember everyone jumping in a mini-mosh pit, careful to not bump into each other too hard due to weapons being present.

The last song Filter performed was ""Take My Picture,"" where something else special happened.  Someone was recording the whole ordeal with a video camera, a small handheld thingy.  Richard took the camera, and sang to it for the whole song, eventually giving it back to the owner.  I eventually got the video from the dude, and need to go back and see if I still have it.

At the end of the concert, the band posed for photos and autographs for each and every person in the audience.  I was lucky enough to be one of the first 50 or so, and let Richard hold my weapon.  He loved it, I remember he called it a ""rocker launcher"" but it wasn't.  I had an M203 attachment on an M16.

I've sadly forgotten or suppressed a lot of my memories from that time, but a few remain, and this one stands out.  I need to go and see if I still have any photos.
