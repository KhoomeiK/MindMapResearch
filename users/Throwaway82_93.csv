So why bother moving on? I don't believe one can answer that question because you can't describe an answer."
depression,fegnp5h,t3_ep29q8,1579098166.0,"Then wait. Sir, wait."

depression,fd6amj5,t3_ek32c5,1578188065.0,"Maybe you would enjoy the armed forces , your days would be structured and you do a lot of phys.
And with the US going into Iraq again, its looking like a juicy train to jump on."
depression,fd69z2i,t3_ek5hvk,1578187781.0,"No, just leave the place and go cry in the toilets."
