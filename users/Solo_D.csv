absolver,ff5ccfb,t1_ff4mzgi,1579587090.0,"It's when you perform a 'perfect attack'. I bet you saw that when you perform an attack, you see your stamina bar show up with gold lines around the rim that quickly go from the start to the end. If you perform another attack once the golden lines are on the two arrows, you will cancel the recovery of your previous attack and immediately execute another attack.

I've explained this to many people, and I always receive the ""it's too hard!"" Excuse. Please try your best as it's probably the most important thing you could do possibly do."

absolver,ff2mfcf,t3_er0z09,1579513197.0,"I see that you're Kahlt. I'll give you a very brief overview of this style as someone who never used it but knows a thing or two about it. I'm sure you already know how to absorb so I'll gloss on how you do it.

When you absorb an attack that isn't a breaking attack, the you take the damage of the attack but if you manage to not get hit/punish your opponent with an attack of your own, the damage you took from the attack you absorbed will regen. Goldlinking is super important so I hope you know how to do that - refer to the tips screen that can be found where you can edit your deck."

Kenshi,fd882u5,t1_fd4uz3a,1578215036.0,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little Okranite? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Old Empire, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Holy Nation outposts and farms, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in heavy weapons and I'm the top Skeleton in the entire Anti-Slaver faction. You are nothing to me but just another Paladin. I will wipe you the fuck out with strength the likes of which has never been seen before on this planet, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me? Think again, cuck. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Spiders across the Black Desert and your outpost is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, Okranite. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your religion. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare skeleton hands. Not only am I extensively trained in heavy weapons combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United Cities arsenal and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the planet, you little flesh man. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn Okranite. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, Holy Nation."

absolver,fcjh07y,t3_ehbvso,1577687267.0,"Not that I'm aware of, but sword moves have attacks which have crazy long range, so if you want to surprise your opponent and engage him from afar, assign a specific attack to your sword, draw it, attack, fold the sword back and continue the fight from there. I've seen people use it to add a few new attacks to their deck, then immediately redraw it to confuse opoonents."
