I can bring it home and share with family so it doesn’t go to waste. 

I also usually follow with a conversation (as organically as possible) about how I am trying to eat right so I have to be really careful about meal planning."
WhatShouldICook,fdow0g0,t3_emhtds,1578614151.0,"Im personally a fan of veggie overloaded spaghetti! It’s just regular pasta and I sauté zucchini, onions, mushrooms, and garlic together. I add the sautéed veggies to pasta sauce. Nothing fancy, but it makes for great comfort food."
creepyPMs,fdlh3ha,t1_fdiszk7,1578523881.0,"I would probably say yes to Kirk though, but I love that connection haha"
WhatShouldICook,fdjrdoq,t1_fdexgo2,1578484629.0,Make sure not to eat too many of the Russell Stover candies- My mom is diabetic and refuses to eat those candies now because they messed up her stomach.
OopsDidntMeanTo,fcncj77,t1_fcm21hs,1577808766.0,"Oh 100% meant for me. We talked in the past about hiking and camping, especially back country trails and sites."
LifeProTips,fc9yrq9,t3_egs81p,1577560226.0,"Before I bought my most recent car I paid for the pre vehicle inspection at an auto shop. 100% worth it! I wish I was car savvy enough to do it myself, but it put my mind at ease knowing I wasn’t getting screwed by the dealership."
creepyPMs,fc8y04x,t1_fc8w0np,1577543900.0,"HA! A little like that, actually!"
creepyPMs,fbxk7a8,t1_fbuz6be,1577191352.0,"It’s possible, but I was out of town for a party so I wasn’t home anyways!"
creepyPMs,fbxk552,t1_fbxjpff,1577191278.0,A southern accent would be more accurate!
creepyPMs,fbxjz2w,t1_fbv7qlm,1577191066.0,We are both teachers!
creepyPMs,fbxjyeh,t1_fbv9lig,1577191041.0,"This happened close to the end of last school year, so I can tell you what happens then! Basically I completely avoided him. I talked with some of my friends at work about what to do, and I had everything saved up to send to my Title 9 Assistant Principal. He backed completely off and didn’t contact me after the text so I didn’t submit it yet, but I still have it sitting in my back pocket if need be. I didn’t want to ruin the guy’s career because he was lonely and made a bad judgement call  in sending that novel."
creepyPMs,fbxjmpk,t1_fbvoxx0,1577190637.0,"Definitely other people at work rejected him, I just don’t know if they also love the outdoors!"
creepyPMs,fbxja3n,t1_fbwb15p,1577190188.0,It’s 8 pages of screenshots combined together! I used StitchPics and tried to make them combine as seamlessly as possible
creepyPMs,fbxj6nw,t1_fbwd5rw,1577190064.0,He’s a charismatic and typical presenting person in real life
creepyPMs,fbxj1q4,t1_fbwgzmp,1577189889.0,I used StitchPics! It was very easy to use and no fee
OopsDidntMeanTo,fbxiz44,t1_fbwilpx,1577189794.0,That’s 100% it! This happened around May and I still avoid him like the plague.
niceguys,fbxiuad,t1_fbwtme8,1577189615.0,Oh how I wish this wasn’t real!
creepyPMs,fbxindu,t1_fbx2rn2,1577189357.0,"They thought my no was not good enough. My first no was trying to be nice but also the truth. I don’t date co workers. It’s messy. Been there, done that, never doing it again. My second no was just a no thanks. But I think he still interpreted it as a no because he’s my co-worker but I just need to be convinced it’s a good idea."
creepyPMs,fbxigrz,t1_fbx4lq1,1577189103.0,"I used to park next to him, and he saw that I had a state park tag hanging from my mirror. We chatted for a couple minutes at dismissal every once in a while, just friendly stuff about where I went hiking or where he went fishing. Nothing at all that seemed flirty, especially since he’s somewhere between 15- 20 years older than me."
creepyPMs,fbxiazj,t1_fbx4pd8,1577188878.0,Into the outdoors?
niceguys,fbxi9c0,t1_fbx5u9t,1577188815.0,"As far as I know he doesn’t know my address, I hope!"
creepyPMs,fbxi3u2,t1_fbxa2bx,1577188600.0,I’m guessing that since I didn’t respond to his texts he thought he could either try to save face or I would suddenly see the messages and want to meet up with him. The “wrong person” message was sent the next day.
creepyPMs,fbxhz2v,t1_fbx903h,1577188409.0,"Looking back I probably should have, but I was already out of town for a family birthday party. And honestly I was so overwhelmed by the what he was saying I couldn’t even process most of the text right away."
creepyPMs,fbxhs9k,t1_fbxa4al,1577188138.0,"He started talking to me at first because I had a state park tag hanging in my car and we parked next to each other. It was nice friendly conversation in person about hiking and camping, nothing crazy and nothing that really seemed like a red flag."
creepyPMs,fbxhl1s,t1_fbxah76,1577187846.0,"So all this happened closer to May this year. He backed off completely, but I keep on the lookout for other girls he tries to do this too because apparently I was like the 5th teacher in the school
He aggressively pursued. Some for friendship, some for dating. All the girls were around 20 years younger than him (I’m in my 20s and he is in his 40s).  I did keep the time stamped texts and emails just in case."
creepyPMs,fbxhec5,t1_fbxan0j,1577187578.0,Watching my phone blow up with the texts that night was truly an amazing sight
creepyPMs,fbxhbv9,t1_fbxbqjf,1577187477.0,Oh don’t forget my favorite part though- natural ecosystem!
creepyPMs,fbxhagq,t1_fbxcv9h,1577187423.0,"So he sent the huge wall of text at like 7:00-9:00 ish at night, the “wrong person” text was sent around 3:00 in the afternoon the next day. 6:30 am was just when I screenshot everything because I couldn’t sleep"
creepyPMs,fbxh58w,t1_fbxfyw5,1577187212.0,Well he was a criminal attorney before he became a teacher so maybe he thought school system rules are the same as laws?
niceguys,fbu6bbj,t1_fbu32w3,1577108574.0,Done! Thanks for the suggestion!
