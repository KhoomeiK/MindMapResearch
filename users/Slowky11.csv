52book,ff3api1,t1_ff35qgs,1579537526.0,"Those are all great! 11/22/63 in particular is one of his best imo. You seem to have your own path on the beam so I won't recommend much. I've done about 40 of his works in the last 3 years, trying to finish them all before I re-read the Dark Tower series. The one I'd recommend doing is Salem's Lot before Wolves of the Calla. There's a character in there that is pulled from Salem's Lot. His character arc is very rewarding between those 2 books. Keep it 19, Constant Reader!"

52book,ff2xji1,t3_er84bg,1579527795.0,"Absolutely the same. I’ve made the habit of just saying I read them or say “can’t wait to read that” even though I only do audio. I’m not lying and if i delve deeper into conversation about it it usually comes up, I’m just in the habit of saying I read books. Some people are a little too hoity toity about using their eyes instead of their ears to digest information. I just don’t get it."
52book,ff2xano,t3_eqvoon,1579527564.0,"I enjoy single post book discussions when there’s things to talk about. Book hauls aren’t nearly as interesting if the OP hasn’t read them. Since it’s the beginning of the year I enjoyed the “going to read this stack of 52 books” posts, but seeing those throughout the year isn’t very fun. Maybe make a rule that discussing books requires that you mentioned whether you’ve read the book(s) or how far you are into them?"
52book,ff2x0qj,t3_er82ys,1579527295.0,Drawing of the Three is one of my favorite King books and IS my favorite of the Dark Tower series. Do you know what other King books you want to tackle this year? Have you ever read Different Seasons?

TheLastAirbender,fdoknv1,t1_fdoedbq,1578607071.0,"Since no one has said otherwise, almost all of LoK season 2 used a different animation studio than the rest of the series run. (The Wan episodes were studio Mir). After season 2 looking as bad as it did, season 3 and 4 returned to the original animation studio. (Studio mir)"
classicwow,fdlqssm,t3_em1cit,1578530284.0,Yeah fuck that quest so much.
TheDarkTower,fdlfd7q,t3_ej2drt,1578522821.0,"I remember the character being extra stupid and disgusting. I absolutely did not think of it as an accurate depiction of the actual person Bryan Smith. After finishing the series and reading about who Bryan Smith actually was, I did think King may have treated him poorly. But i mean, he hit King with a car so, I gave him a pass. King also joked that he was hit by a character in his own books, and I'm guessing he ran with that idea. Smith was written like any other useless henchmen villain in King's works."

CastleRockTV,fdgp2ay,t3_el061i,1578404511.0,"Along with the multiple twinner references(thekid/Henry or thekid/the baby that died), There are several magical talismans in the first season as well. The chess set and the soap figurine that makes the new warden walk into traffic. These are reminiscent  of  talismans that are made with intention. Like Eddie Dean carving a key out of wood, or Dinky earnshaw writing weird hieroglyphs and the people who read them end up killing them selves. 

The second season was much less ambiguous about the multiverse references and they weren’t afraid to try some new stuff and veer off the written path. So who knows where they will go with all the kingisms. From the creators ama next season may center around pop/pangborn/Lacey dynamic set in the past. But that’s strictly conjecture."

classicwow,fdcgji1,t1_fdceif8,1578274351.0,Yeah I’ve been avoiding grinding mining for this very reason. Still no epic mount. RIP.
wow,fdcg002,t1_fdc6unf,1578273972.0,Yeah forums are nice for that and I’m rly bored on a family visit. Comics are commentary and it affected me. The other comments didn’t have my opinion so I shared it. I want to like Shadowlands but don’t want to look forward to this again. At this point Blizz is adding dailies to mix up the repetitively of wq. They’ve digressed since Legion. It worries me.
wow,fdc55jd,t1_fdc1nkf,1578267305.0,"It’s art and art speaks volumes. Bfa wq was awful and I hope they make this amazing system better and not do the same thing again fatiguing their players even sooner. The only reason wq were such a success in Legion was because it was a new system. Exact same thing with the ap system. Then bfa comes out with either the exact same(WQ), or an even worse system(AP). Shits lazy and makes me question their design team."
wow,fdc0kb0,t3_ekhpgc,1578264788.0,"I hope Blizz address the world quest fatigue because it is NOT fun content after two months of gameplay. Once you’ve seen all the world quests once(which most are just reused regular quests) there’s no more interesting things. Just another grind. Except there are so many things tied to wq. Rep, allied races, achieves, mounts, pets, gear.. I grinded my shit on one toon and yet never did it again on any of my other three 120s.  
  
The worst part is Blizz says allied races require exalted because of story purposes, and yet you spend 21 days doing repeated content AFTER doing all the quests. Nice. Worked for the Nightborne during Legion and never again after that. Ffs instead of creating interesting content for wq, Blizz just made candy crush into wow. Blizzard is owned by the same company that owns candy crush. It’s frustratingly lazy by design. In Legion we got platformer dailies that were kinda fun. Bfa we get candy crush and the memory game... I really hate the design this game has taken around world quests."
television,fdbjsav,t1_fdb9j3q,1578258061.0,"Idk, I like the bigger world feeling. It’s different and fresh for the fantasy genre on tv. I agree the show should be able to stand on its own, but Witcher has several Books and they are telling the story in their own way. In 2020 people watch a tv show or movie then immediately go online to discuss it. So the standing on its own opinion is getting murkier and murkier to agree with. Finding information for the world you’re invested in is almost always rewarding. And Witcher seems to want to reward re-watches. Another example is The Watchmen tv show having lore tidbits between episodes to fill in the gaps of the scripts. For Watchmen it’s also a obvious reference to all the world building material between the original Watchmen graphic novel release. I think both examples (Witcher and Watchmen) handle the lack of information in an interesting way that the average viewer should be able to pick up on."

FlashTV,fdab04q,t1_fda79z4,1578243919.0,"I believe it was always admiration for Barry. Deep down, he admired his powers to the point of obsession. He's the reverse of him after all. The antithesis, the nemesis, he was playing him, Barry, because the bigger he was, the harder he'd fall. And thus, the reverse would be stronger. Just a guess though. I didn't read it as father/son but definitely mentor/mentee situation. And if it's like the sith the student always surpasses the teacher (by killing him)."
CastleRockTV,fda8bxf,t1_fd630kj,1578242911.0,Is the voice of god supposed to be the same hum that the statue makes? Maybe if we're saying TK has a demon inside him possessing the thinny perhaps? The tinnitus-like ringing is textbook thinny from the King universe. So the statue doing it made me think it was a different source. Maybe some sort of deadlights-like power similar to what Pennywise does in IT to hypnotize kids long enough to be consumed/controlled?

I imagine we both worked at a big pizza chain in-house at some point, because they are all basically the same. They make the sauce and dough, but the flour and tomato paste and spices are shipped in. This post is assuming just ingredients and not labor. They factored that in after. Also, as others already stated earlier this is most likely a shill post that is super outdated and only here to get people to talk about Little Ceasers. Which whatever because I would never eat Little Ceasers given the option of something else. It's  garbage pizza with garbage ingredients, like most big pizza chains, like the one I worked at.

CastleRockTV,fd9znom,t1_fd4xsbs,1578239989.0,"I agree. I think joy was not possessed but the writers wanted to be a little ambiguous as to whether she truly was or not.

52book,fd9zh8c,t1_fd6ajmg,1578239901.0,Oh most definitely. They merge a few plot lines from later books in season 1. With that said the first book was by far my favorite. It’s just so adventurous and the main character Lyra is unforgettable.
todayilearned,fd9ywu9,t1_fd9ybt7,1578239738.0,"Yeah, it’s probably 6-7 ounces of cheese. Which is probably hmm... .90 of cheese per pizza. The dough and sauce probably cost them next to nothing.  Idk about pep but it’s definitely cheaper than cheese.

todayilearned,fd9wdno,t3_ek9iav,1578238800.0,Little chasers $5 pizzas do not cost them 3.50 in ingredients. There’s no way. I’d believe 2 bucks maybe. It’s one topping and cheese. Everything else costs pennies.

harrypotter,fd2z0ek,t3_ejv26m,1578153187.0,"Luna is a not eating magic mushrooms. She’s just aloof. She’s a little weirdo off the normal path. Saying she’s on drugs all the time sounds offending to her personality. I never noticed the Alice in wonderland parallels so I think your theory has merit in her origination, however I would disagree on the final product. My favorite moment for Luna was when the trio go to her house and into her room while she’s not home and sees portraits of themselves. Her best friends and new family. It was incredibly touching to sense that great loneliness inside her."
