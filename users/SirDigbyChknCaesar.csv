Fantasy,ffexd1f,t1_ffdyu59,1579869305.0,Character because someone writes this. Her relationship is strung along as a mysterious drama element for so long that the payoff wasn't really worth it to me. Drama for the sake of drama always comes off as cheap. Also it feeds into a tired trope that women are mysterious and capricious and men are helpless to it.
Fantasy,ffex70h,t1_ffeltc8,1579869136.0,That's not exactly what I said. As a reader you should have at least some insight into character reactions. From Locke's point of view (and hence the reader) Sabetha is nice to him one moment and then turns on him for seemingly no reason. Then it repeats multiple times. It seems contrived for drama.
masseffect,ffewwzj,t1_ffe8187,1579868849.0,The problem I always have is they look great in the editor and then they look weird in the game. There seems to be a lot of unflattering lighting during cut scenes that makes her lips look weird or face look gaunt.

Omg that's a great description"
Fantasy,ffdxrdg,t3_et2fpl,1579831560.0,"I thought Sabetha was a pretty bad character. She  puts Locke through hell and it takes years for her to tell him why. She blames a lot of shit on him but never bothers to explain herself. I get that she's been traumatized and maybe that's even realistic, but it doesn't make me like her. I'd like to hear more about how she's become successful and used her wits to get ahead, but I don't care for more relationship drama that's instigated by her just to punish Locke for things that he isn't even aware of."

mpminidelta,ff9u55o,t3_esgcf5,1579721370.0,"Not sure which clips you have. The ones I made aren't magnetic, just a printed base with a binder clip.

If I remember correctly you want to put a .024"" thick piece of card stock between a clip and the bed. Screw the clip down until it trips the bed sensor, then back the screw off until the button just barely doesn't trigger (the light on the side of the MPMD will go from red to blue. Repeat this for all clips.

This makes it so all the bed sensors trigger with the same minimal force. I assume the theory would be the same for whatever clips you have."
