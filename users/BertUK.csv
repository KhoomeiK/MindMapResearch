>SchuKos are harder to pull out the wall because they're recessed, regardless of their orientation.

Because a plug can really only be accidentally pulled from a wall by its cable, not by the plug itself (that would be intentional).  Right-angled plugs make this basically impossible.  Some SchuKo plugs aren't right-angled.  

> By the way, it's a lot safer for the plug to come out of the socket than it is for the wire to come out of >the plug...

Makes no difference to my argument.  If you did manage to pull the cable from a UK plug then you'd still be safe.

> Given that they're plastic that's pretty hard to do, but if it happens, bend them back? This is a complete non-issue.

Yeah it is hard, but it was still unnerving that it was possible relatively easily.  The pins in the UK plug are much thicker and have a rectangular profile.  Almost impossible to bend. 

> No, I'm suggesting that while it's definitely a good idea, it's fundamentally unnecessary if the wire can't be ripped from the plug.

It's still a safe feature.  You could theoretically rip the cord from a SchuKo plug if you wanted to.  If you managed it (let's say you rolled over the flex with your car in the garage), there's no guarantee that you won't create an issue with exposed wiring.

> the British plug is full of superfluous, unnecessary, and redundant safety features, most of them anachronistic.

If the British were to design a new plug now, it would be different of course.  Nobody's saying the aesthetics are better, just that it's technically safer.

> Completely unnecessary? Yes.

>Do you wear a helmet all the time, everywhere you go? Why not, it'd be safer! Same concept.

Exactly: I might look worse but I'd still be able to successfully argue that I was safer than you.

> Yes we're talking about that. Here in the developed world we don't shore up outdated technology for centuries on end, we make progress.

actual lol.

>You're claiming that non-shuttered sockets don't exist, which may or may not be true, but if it is it's just a consequence of the whole standard only existing in one country. Trust me, if your plug was in use in Kazakhstan you'd see some creative, unsafe sockets. But again, shutters are also completely unnecessary, so it's a moot point.

Are you're proving here is that having an inline fuse adds a layer of safety that would protect somebody using the plug in a non-standard way.

You're also moving outside the standard.  It's possible to put a certified SchuKo plug into a different certified SchuKo socket and still achieve an unsafe result with [exposed live contacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schuko_plug_inserted_in_CEE_7_1_ungrounded_socket.jpg).  Sorry, but it's true. Shutters would prevent this.  It's less safe.

If shutters are completely unnecessary then why do some countries insist that they are present for safety reasons?  And why do the newest ShuKo sockets have them?  And why is it possible to create an unsafe scenario with SchuKo plugs and sockets that both conform to standards?

>By the way, I should point out that you have not one but two, completely incompatible and concurrently used standards for sockets: the one you're thinking of, and BS 546, which is quite possibly the most asinine design of plug I have ever come across (it comes in three different sizes for fuck's sake).

You're complaining that the plugs are too big but then also complaining that they can come in multiple sizes?   I believe it comes in different sizes because it's been revised multiple times over the years.  Isn't progress what defined a developed country?  We also don't allow ANY non-shuttered sockets in the UK.  Progress, see?

>LOL, are you serious? I'm regularly inconvenienced by the fact that my plugs can only be inserted in only two orientations as opposed to 4, I'd tear my hair out every other week if I had to deal with your massive, unidirectional pieces of antique crap!

Maybe you have to unplug and plug things in so often because you don't have switches on the sockets?  In my house plugs just stay in the wall.

Not that my argument was ever about anything other than safety, but literally nobody cares.  And nobody leaves plugs laying around on the floor with the pins facing upwards because if they want to unplug something, they either do it on the device or do it at the wall if they want to shut off power completely.  No need to unplug and have it sitting on the floor. 

Again though, I'm not saying it's aesthetically or practically easier to use, all I'm talking about is safety. 

> It's inconvenient, inflexible, incompatible

I mustn't spend enough time using plugs to understand how their usage could ever be important enough to negatively affect my life.  We go abroad, we buy a £1.50 adaptor, and we still have fuses in the plugs just in case some cowboy has wired up the apartment in the underdeveloped European country we're visiting ;)

> gigantic

Again, nobody's arguing about aesthetics here.

> more expensive (hence wasteful)

[According to this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60906-1), it seems appliances with SchuKo plugs  ""must be fitted with double pole switches and fuse links on both the line and neutral pins in order to be safe. Requiring these extra safety features can add to the manufacturing costs of electronic equipment."" due to the fact that the plug can be inserted either way up.  Happy to be proven wrong on this if it's not true.

Out of interest, can you easily replace the plug/flex on a device with a SchuKo cable yourself, since they are factory sealed?  Replacing the flex often means disassembling the device, which most people can't do.  Many more people will be capable of replacing a UK plug.  Quite economical compared to getting a new flex and plug combo fitted.

> and antiquated (despite >being younger than the SchuKo).

I'm assuming here, since I haven't checked, but are you saying the version of the SchuKo that was already in use at the time of the conception of the modern UK plug, was already safer?  I suspect you're comparing the most recent SchuKo variants with the 60-year old UK one (which still isn't as safe due to the reasons I've listed above).

>The additional safety features (like the fuse, shutters, and wiring) are totally redundant and completely >unnecessary, like a helmet for every day. 

Like I said, they may be unnecessary 99.9% of the time, but it's still safer.  I'm sure there have been many, many incidents around the world where the fuse in a UK plug has stopped somebody's house from burning down. Just because they are basically superfluous now in modern homes doesn't mean it's not safer by design. 

>There is not one feature of the British plug or socket that would make the SchuKo Type F plug and socket any better, or safer

Well, there is: the inline fuse and the obvious polarity.  It can't cause accidents but surely has and will continue to prevent some.

> while the British plug, if nothing else, could be smaller, cheaper, reversible, and have straight-in plugs.

Yes it could now, but again it has no bearing on how safe it is, which is what I was talking about.

>Like, for fuck's sake, with nothing more than smaller contacts in one straight line (like the Italian plug) you'd be halfway there..

In-fact, straight-line connectors introduce a safety issue of their own (hard to differentiate between polarity - a potentially fatal error). [This international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60906-1) was designed to rectify this safety flaw but has only been adopted by South Africa (maybe they're more developed than your country?)

The arrangement of the UK pins means it's instantly obvious which is live and neutral and you could even determine this when unsighted.  It also permits the wiring pattern that ensures live and neutral disengage first in the event of a forceful removal of the plug from the wire.  The odds are that this has saved a few lives over the years whether you want to think it's completely useless or not.

The only thing that SchuKo wins on is size, which has nothing to do with its safety."

Yes but you can also get non-right-angled SchuKo plugs, which aren't as safe.  If you want to talk about specific variants then we can, but all we're talking about is SchuKo in general.  The cleaning lady in our apartment in Rhodes who managed to bend the pins in a SchuKo plug with her trolley as she pushed it past would probably agree that she would have preferred a design where that couldn't happen.

Are you suggesting that isn't a safe feature?  The wiring design inside the UK plug ensures that the earth will always disengage last in the event of the wires somehow being pulled from the plug while live.  Incredibly hard and unlikely?  Yes.  Safer?  Yes.

A child would have to connect to *both* terminals simultaneously with a tool that's unusually small and narrow to successfully electrocute themselves, and at that point the shutter isn't going to add any extra safety. Contrary to common belief, sticking a single sowing needle into an outlet won't do much.

>Plus, of course, *we* have breakers *on our circuits*, therefore all that will happen if a child does somehow succeed is that they'll get a brief shock and the breaker will pop and that's it.

&#x200B;

The shutter adds security because you would have to insert something into the earth pin hole AND simultaneously touch both live and neutral, and be on a non-RCD circuit.  Virtually impossible? Yes. Still safer?  Yes.

Are you suggesting that UK households don't have RCD's and circuit breakers?    Or are we only talking about ancient and non-standard wiring in things like old farm buildings, in which the UK plug is still safe to use because of its inline fuse but a SchuKo equivalent would be more dangerous in?

Shutters are an option on SchuKo, but not mandated by the standard.  They are a safety feature, whichever way you want to spin it, so the plug/sockets are therefore inherently safer.
