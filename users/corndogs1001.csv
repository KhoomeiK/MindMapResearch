makinghiphop,ffd1iiu,t1_ffcpty6,1579811574.0,"Gambino said it best

“These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it

Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed

All I do is make the stuff I would've liked

Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite”

There’s always an audience for something out there."
hiphopheads,ffczywj,t1_ffcv1cm,1579810716.0,"Yes it is, but if that album wasn’t Eminem and instead some new pop/rap artist’s debut it would probably been received better. It’s just now what we wanted to hear from Em."
hiphopheads,ffczurk,t1_ffcxvlq,1579810653.0,If revival is the worst album you’ve ever heard then you need to listen to more music lol.
hiphopheads,ffczsft,t1_ffcyd5z,1579810616.0,"Yeah I agree, that production for Em was perfect at the time but music doesn’t really sound like that anymore. It’s really a time capsule of 2010. I applaud em cause he just wanted to be different during that time and try something new. Meanwhile Relapse was full of smooth timeless Dre beats."
hiphopheads,ffczkr6,t1_ffcziub,1579810497.0,I disagree cause MMLP2 was excellent but hey your opinion

hiphopheads,ffcvosf,t1_ffcrzop,1579808234.0,"Every CD critics gave it a three, then three

Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it

And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest

The Marshall Mathers was a classic

The Eminem Show was fantastic

But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it

I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet

A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic"

AskReddit,ffcn3r3,t1_ffc6foh,1579802968.0,I watched one and like half of 2 with a friend back to back on Netflix before getting bored. I don’t remember a lot of two I thought it was just lame. For what reason did they have to make 3 of them?
Eminem,ffcldvp,t1_ffccbne,1579801929.0,"The Way I Am, was his autobiography that came out in 2008. It was during his hiatus but like a year after he got sober but a year before Relapse. He might of been working on relapse during writing this book. Very good read btw."

hiphopheads,ffcikdx,t1_ffcgkgy,1579800222.0,The old music always gonna be there. No ones making me listen to the new music.
hiphopheads,ffcie7e,t1_ffcflza,1579800119.0,"Honestly. I understand not being able to get into most of Em’s stuff, cause each album is different. Albums like Recovery may not be my cup of tea but it’s by no means a “bad album.” Only album I would call bad by Em is Revival, and even that isn’t really bad it’s just mediocre and not what the fans wanted, so it’s just bad to us fans."

hiphopheads,ffarj9l,t1_ffaat1z,1579742815.0,"I mean I can see why, drugs were a huge part of his life, and he ended up having a serious problem, where he even overdosed and almost died. Life changing events are always relevant to rappers lyrics. 

Happy we’re lucky to still have Em. RIP Wrld."

AskReddit,ffa8abt,t1_ff9r3jk,1579729826.0,"This show is the definition of getting ruined by its fan base. I also think (personally) the show isn’t as great as it was in its first two seasons. It’s still a very solid show, but yeah for a small while I didn’t want to wear my Rick and Morty shirts in public."

Edit: Since you guys dont like to google... Mike Lazzo and Adult Swim kept asked him to get darker with the show, so they kept pushing the button. That led season 3 to be so dark, Adult Swim panicked and cut the season episode order in half and made the season the final one. The show literally got cancelled for being too dark. Asking Dino he said he wouldn’t want to go back to AS anytime soon."

Eminem,fez7pcn,t1_feyz1q3,1579454546.0,"I’m not really against editing an album after release, I just think personally when you feel an album is completed it should stay that way. That’s one piece of your work and now you can move on. That’s how music always was before digital streaming. But then you got people like Kanye that have obviously rushed the craft he’s done (late album drops, etc) which goes into why release a album date in the first place if you know it wasn’t completed. It’s like a school paper, take your time and hand it in so we can all enjoy it together.

Other times people have gotten so used to the originial songs that changing it actually makes it worse, like Young Thug getting rid of the second verse on ecstasy, or Kanye taking out and adding things on I thought about killing you."
