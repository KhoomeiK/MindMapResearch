also take your time on decisions

they may have you take a practice asvab if you feel up to it, and they may be able to let you know on prospective jobs if you / they have the time. don't rush any of these decisions though, trust me. whenever you get to that point of choosing a job try to research what their actual roles for the AF and military in general are. if you ever have any questions PM me :)"
