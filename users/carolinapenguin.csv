vegan1200isplenty,ffahgrz,t1_ffagr2h,1579735834.0,Yea that would just be weird ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
vegan1200isplenty,ffa67p0,t3_esh7ht,1579728672.0,Anybody know if I can sub the oil for melted vegan butter? I only have lemon flavoured olive oil ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
fuckeatingdisorders,ff6cvaw,t3_ermrmg,1579624432.0,"Drinking calories is okay, but only if they're ""healthy"": that means smoothies and natural juices are ok but not regular coke or Pepsi or wtv.

It doesn't matter how many calories something is, if it has protein it's healthy and I can eat as much as I want.

Veggies are all good, except potatoes. Those are the devil for some reason.

I can eat more if I exercise, but the net calories need to be below 1000 otherwise I feel like a failure.

And that's just to name a few."
veganuk,ff4adpj,t1_ff49bkn,1579559027.0,"Same, it's nothing special but neither is kfc (imo). I just felt like the girl didn't even give her a fair chance. Besides the dryness, it's nice and it tastes to me like kfc used to."
EDanonymemes,ff3vdsc,t1_ff3uvb0,1579549680.0,"He knows I kinda struggle with food but he thinks I'm over it (I told him I had an ED last year but didn't mention that I never fully recovered), I'm in the start of a relapse so this hit very hard"
veganuk,ff34avy,t3_ere3v6,1579533321.0,Oh god that girl was so irritating. It's like since she knew they were vegan she had her mind set on not liking the food. I've tried all three of them and I love the sausage rolls and the steak bake. The KFC burger IS a bit dry but it definitely tastes like chicken and it was very good imo
intuitiveeating,ff33n5a,t1_ff334w2,1579532840.0,"If you feel satisfied, then there you go! You were eating mindfully until you felt satisfied, so I dont consider that a binge, just a day where you ate a bit more"
intuitiveeating,ff32ois,t3_erdd1j,1579532109.0,"I think a binge is only called that when you feel like you can't stop eating. It doesn't matter the quantity, but if you're eating something and you feel like you lose control, you can't stop eating (usually quite fast), then it's a binge. Also for me I always felt shame afterwards, or regret. If you were enjoying it and eating mindfully i think it's not. But only you can know that."
EDanonymemes,ff32fh1,t1_ff298s7,1579531914.0,Oh believe me I DID. He said I had big strong thighs and I wanted to cry

fatlogic,fez2i2h,t1_fez1ypq,1579453242.0,Considering my TDEE is around 1300-1400 cals (I'm a short girl) I kinda have to eat at least some amount of the calories I burned ðŸ˜‚ but yea I understand what you mean
fatlogic,feyy9g6,t1_fey9eld,1579451938.0,According to my Google fit my 10k ish steps today burnt around 400 calories. Should I not trust it? (Legit question)
fatlogic,fejcpil,t3_epekuo,1579167474.0,"Technically, if you're overweight with a restrictive ED, the goal in recovery is to heal your relationship with food. This could mean eating a lot of calories a day (yes, even if you're fat). Because if you have anorexia, even if you're at a ""healthy"" weight or even overweight, your body is still deprived of nutrients. So you eat and restore your body and your mind. Then, once you are recovered you can try and lose the weight healthily (but a lot of people find this too triggering and are never recovered ""enough"" for it).

Having said that, I don't think this person truly suffered from a restrictive eating disorder. The way she talks doesn't really sound like someone with anorexia or anything like that. Also, no, you can't pray the ED away."
ihavesex,fehuiib,t3_ep6c1u,1579124128.0,I believe that's called rape
veganuk,fdlpl2k,t1_fdlphly,1578529457.0,Yea the Bailey's is a pretty obvious one ðŸ˜‚ I was just wondering if all the stuff you crossed out has egg whites/fish bladders in it. Yuck

veganuk,fdlp8xg,t3_ely4xl,1578529229.0,"Just out of curiosity: why are the drinks not vegan? I've heard about beer being filtered through fishes bladders and egg whites but I don't drink beer anyways so I never paid much attention to it. 

Is the fish bladder thing also applicable to the other things you crossed out or is it another reason?"

vegan,fctyv71,t3_eiop7o,1577966316.0,"When I first transitioned to veganism, I found it so much easier than I thought it would be! I recommend if you're worried about nutrition to try it out for a while and track your food using cronometer, so you can see if you should be eating more of a certain mineral/vitamin. Also, I suggest cowspiracy, it talks about the effects of eating meat on the planet, and dominion (graphic images warning tho), which is about the animal abuse and mistreat. For me those are the main reasons why I went vegan!"
vegancirclejerk,fcty6e7,t3_eiwufd,1577965421.0,"Finally, a place where I can justify eating bacon!"
vegancirclejerk,fcs5t1u,t1_fcs4ic6,1577911847.0,"Not eggs and milk together lol yes that would be vegetarianism. Like for example my best friend uses eggs quite a lot (from her backyard hens). So I told her, just be vegan and keep eating those eggs if you find it hard to stop. Then eventually transition to fully vegan. Problem is, even though she claimed to only eat those eggs, I have seen her eat meat, fish, cheese and cakes (non vegan) on several different occasions. All under the pretence that she is reducing her intake (which I don't think happened, she's just eating normally and claiming to be taking baby steps)"
vegancirclejerk,fcrgajn,t3_eij94f,1577901438.0,"Aka I ate only fruit (mostly bananas), didn't meet my nutritional needs at all and felt horrible, obviously, so that MUST mean vegan diets are unhealthy and dangerous!!1!!11!"
vegancirclejerk,fcr326k,t3_eiiv4m,1577896070.0,"The thing is, I've told several people to just be vegan for everything but eggs/cheese/wtv and then transition and they still don't do it. They're just looking for excuses to not be vegan, but still want to feel the moral superiority"
