nba,feozbn5,t1_feoyt3o,1579308659.0,">political messaging

Dude, that's his entire shtick, it's literally the only reason he's popular. He's popular among racists. How can you say that he doesn't lean into political/racist messaging when that's all he talks about? 

There's more than one way to make a point, and the boob comment kills any credibility he had, it did nothing to further the 1st amendment or anything, all it did was show that's he doesn't give a shit."
nba,feox3ju,t1_feowtuk,1579307279.0,"I'd argue /r/nba likes him more than the average person. /r/nba still posts about him all the time, most people I talk sports with don't bother with FS1 and don't even mention a thing about him.

He's not respected now, maybe by some people but not nearly as many or as much as before. Just because you win awards doesn't mean your respected for your opinions. Skip plays a part and it cost him the respect of his peers as a journalist. 

You're basically saying Stugotz is respected, they both spew the same bullshit, it's just that one of them had a journalist background so we're supposed to believe that one."
nba,feowl0p,t1_feovnpu,1579306960.0,">Your shifting goal posts only exemplify your dislike for him which is blocking you from thinking rationally. 

No he's not...he said this in his first comment reply:

>He thoroughly discredited himself back in THE 90s when he published a book full of unsourced rumors including totally unsubstantiated hints the Troy Aikman was gay. 

Personally I'm not going to say if he was respected at one point in time or not because I only know him from his ESPN/FS hot take days. Maybe back on the Cold pizza days he was legit, but that was 20~ years ago. He's not respected now. Just because he was respected at one point in time doesn't mean he'll always be."
nba,feow8tp,t1_feoryj7,1579306756.0,">he seems genuine despite the corniness

genuinely racist? What do you even mean by that? He's not any better than anyone else, if anything he's worse. What kind of guy goes on TV and says the only two things he believes in are the 1st amendment and boobs?"
