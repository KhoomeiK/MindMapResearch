The Iranian side isn’t just helping us – we have obtained access to both the parts of the plane and the crash site – police are helping ensuring the site’s safety… Now our team has received access to the black box, which we plan to use soon to reconstruct the negotiations.” “

They have/ had access to the sites that mattered. Of course there’s debris everywhere, but the main areas with the biggest parts had access the whole time. 
There’s no need for you to demonize something when Iran has come out an admitted it. Period."

The founding fathers never envisioned this type of warfare, this type of ineptitude, this level of corruption. They entrusted too much on the public to do their rightful duty and first off vote, and second off vote for someone who has the best interest of the people, country, security, and prosperity, with an unbiased tone and execution.
