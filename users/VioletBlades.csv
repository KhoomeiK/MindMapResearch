creepyPMs,fcl2jyy,t1_fcjk5am,1577738419.0,"I honestly wish I thought of something better. As soon as she showed me her phone, and I read the message, I went into anger/protect mode."
creepyPMs,fcl2fg1,t1_fck4gkp,1577738341.0,"He did, my sister looks young, and I have another screenshot of him confirming he was aware. He claims he just wants “love” and nothing more."

creepyPMs,fciuzoe,t1_fciuu1n,1577670455.0,"I tend to get protective over my younger siblings, so I won’t deny I had a less than calm mind. I trolled him for awhile, but I need him to admit to what he wants. But thank you!"
creepyPMs,fcitz8w,t1_fcitg3e,1577669761.0,Oh is it now? I’m gonna enjoy this.
ChoosingBeggars,fcitmcz,t3_ehc2oa,1577669517.0,"Wow... sorry that happened. It’s like talking to a brick wall, you’ll never get an answer. Only this wall has an attitude."
creepyPMs,fcisg56,t1_fcis130,1577668727.0,"I really wanted to mess with him, I trolled him a little.  But my friend claimed I could get in trouble for harassment, so I’m not sure what to do with him. My younger sister was upset, and now has all social media set to private."
creepyPMs,fciny8n,t1_fcimo62,1577665812.0,I shall teach you my ways.
creepyPMs,fcim7u1,t1_fcihth6,1577664911.0,"Lol I added that lovely insult 😂 And yeah, you’re most likely right. I ended up happily trolling him for awhile."

creepyPMs,fchsah8,t1_fchrrf8,1577653620.0,"Thank you, the person in question was not underage, he looked to be in his late 30s, while my sister is a teen."
niceguys,f8v7vk1,t3_e2cjcz,1574862350.0,"Okay, this guy is a creep. But you really shouldn’t be talking to someone that old, please be careful."
