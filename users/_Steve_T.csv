Throwers,fewld2b,t1_fewl9n2,1579413500.0,You might be right. Is there a reason that you want the sage?
Throwers,fewfdk1,t3_eqrff8,1579409672.0,Tried another retailer?
aww,fep9qzg,t3_eq9uvf,1579315315.0,Do not resist. Do not hesitate. Just sign the papers and take her home.
Buddhism,fep8cs4,t3_eqa5p5,1579314419.0,Also look online at different sects of buddhism it may help you find one that fits your needs.
Buddhism,feoymxx,t3_eq921y,1579308233.0,Edit: please ignore my previous ignorant comments. I read your post as you think that a sutra or something was gonna help your mother. I horribly misread and misunderstood what you were saying. I see that you were asking for now. I deeply apologize.
fantasywriters,felm8mg,t3_eptc3q,1579225539.0,"Its written like some bibles. Some people will like it others won't. If you want to sell books write how your target audience reads (usually simple common words). On the other hand. It's your book, write how you want to write and enjoy it."

Meditation,fdunn7m,t1_fduf3nf,1578735882.0,Cant afford a meditation cushion? Roll up a towel. Or fold it. Your choice. Works just fine.
writing,fdtpa8g,t3_en0iiq,1578720100.0,This was fantastic to read. A lot of great information in there.
freebsd,fdtds0f,t1_fdtdhv0,1578715313.0,Personally I despise debian. Install it. Then spend 4 hours changing everything because nothing is right or accessible. Hell. Gotta add crap just to get a decent firefox working.
freebsd,fdtctqe,t3_en21u0,1578714938.0,Because it not changed just for the thrill of changing something. It's only changed when it needs to be. And its stable as f**k.
aww,fdtcm8w,t3_en21zn,1578714852.0,I'm not picking. But I have seen alot of people who get pets but have no money and it's bad for the pets. If you dont have the money to get a pet then you dont have to money to take care of it. Dont get one if you cant take care of it. Try getting a stable source of income first.
Meditation,fds4772,t3_emv7e2,1578694004.0,I think the down voting is from people who think their way of doing things is the best and only real way.

Meditation,fdrbu4c,t3_emqhiw,1578682258.0,"My personal method to deal with this is to not get on social media. Except pinterest since it is a gold mine of cooking recipes. But no instafacetweetcrapbook. 

Shit. I'm on reddit... damn."
Meditation,fdrblph,t1_fdr06os,1578682114.0,I would say the toxicity of just everyday people is just as bad. All three drama and senseless inane garbage is pretty depressing.

Meditation,fdf0oos,t3_el1hd6,1578350664.0,"From a fellow large person. Start working on your diet. I have much the same issue due to my size. But I'm eating alot healthier and am starting to lose weight. I feel much better and my meditation is slowly getting better. Not gonna bother with the health talk that we all hear so much.

Untill you lose the weight try sitting on a chair with your but on the edge and back straight as you can."

Fantasy,fc5pzqj,t3_ega76n,1577463475.0,I see the wheel of thine in there (eye of the world and the great hunt) good series. I recomend finishing it.
demonssouls,fc3yggu,t1_fc3y85j,1577401875.0,Oh. Well then. Yes it's worth it. If even just to experience the game that started the souls thing. With the world tendency it has more replayability.
demonssouls,fc3y6hp,t3_eg19bw,1577401669.0,"Why do people ask these questions? ""Is X worth it in Y year?"" Do people actually think that the year makes something less awesome than the year before?

And yes. It's worth it in 2019, and 2020. Hell it will still be worth it in 2035."
Buddhism,fc1lle1,t3_efkyfj,1577322432.0,There is no better system. There is no worst system. Any system that is put in place will become corrupt and people will suffer for one reason or another. People going on and on about capitalism have yet to see that in socialism everyone is dirt poor. Communist countries are the most controlling and are usually run by evil dictatorships. Capitalism just falls apart after a time. And you know what? None of it matters. Any system looks good on paper. But as soon as you add humans to the mix those systems become corrupt hell holes. So stop worrying about it. And for the love of what ever you believe in please keep politics out of here we have better things to do.
homelab,fbweh8s,t3_eemzef,1577147786.0,I'll take one of those off your hands. I'll even pay for it.
