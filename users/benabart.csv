So the world anaesthesia is a little bit, let's say, off. The ""no water overnight"" part is utterly and completly wrong, as the main part of the problem is the stunning and the bloodletting. That means that they have water overnight and that you simply invented that.

For the space or the transport, I don't see why it is in the debate here: this wasn't about that but about the conditions in the slaughterhouses."
Switzerland,feh5ht1,t1_fegvfvm,1579109556.0,"
Nope, only a minority is incriminated, as said in the federal report, so don't be overdramatic saying that 90% of them are just illegal, that's not fair nor true."

Switzerland,fegq9u2,t1_feg607j,1579099992.0,"The problem in the title is that it present part of the truth and can be interpreted as «10% are tested and most of them are seen as illegal so most of them are illegal». 
And by saying «our laws are more strict that the one in EU» is that these buisnesses will be legal in EU (at least in some part of the EU). (Let's slip there that the kasher and halal way of slaughter were legal in EU until last year and that this law haven't totally made his way in all lands)"
Switzerland,fegphkg,t1_feg2syp,1579099450.0,Well they done a test and the results were not surprising. At least it means that our system works because they are able to find the ones who are problematic and try to solve the problem for them
Switzerland,feg03al,t3_eoszoz,1579071266.0,"So... typical 20 minutes: they only read the basic infos without reading the press communication: the slaughterhouses that were controlled were already «at risk». Long story short story: they discovered that in some of them, there was problems in some stages of the slaughter.
Here's the link to my source: https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/fr/home/dokumentation/nsb-news-list.msg-id-77769.html 

After the «official» part here comes the subjective part: this is sad that some slaughterhouses aren't in the norms and I think this is not really surprising as our animal right legislation is more strict as the one in the EU."
