Cant get it all in one night so you gotta keep a steady rotation of what needs doing when. I also understand how to take something from good to great when given enough time.

Off the clock I'd rather not do it. My house is passably clean but by no means spotless. Typically takes me an hour or two to top to bottom the place instead of just knocking it out as I go along. For instance, cooked yesterday,  ain't done those dishes yet. Figure I'll get to em tomorrow or sat. I get a little defensive about saying my house isn't clean so I want to be clear, I wouldn't be embarrassed typically with having unexpected guests."

UnethicalLifeProTips,ffbb57n,t3_esea2x,1579758175.0,"So I had my buddy live with me for a bit, he was going to be homeless so I let him stay in my spare bedroom rent free so he could fix his life. Obviously I was his land lord but I always considered him.my room mate and treated him as such.

He didnt really do anything wrong but I was sure I didnt want him there past a year so at six months I informed him he will not be welcome at house after 12 months.  Made a pretty basic eviction notice letter with dates and just told what was up. Had him sign a copy. He Ended up leaving 3 months later with his life in dramatically better shape. We are still on good terms. I think the reason why we are on good terms is I was open about what was going on and gave ample time for him to plan his next move.

Dont think this will work for your idea of getting some else to move out with out it being evident. But I haven't seen a good idea in here really. Like people are suggesting learning an instrument, you're going to either have to be an oblivious dick head about how annoying that is or be an asshole who just doesn't care, both make you look like a dick.

people are suggesting things like using it climb trees and that seems wrong simply because you are going to want to bang on the back side of it to get it to stick into the tree and using a hammer on the t side seems like good way to damage it.

Edit: a whole bunch of people should watch some lawyer talk about why speaking to people with badges is a bad idea


https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE the first 26 minutes is a lawyer telling you why you never talk to the cops. At 26 minutes a cop tells the class they are teaching  the lawyer is 100% right. Do not talk to cops.

Btw anything you tell the cops is hearsay if its positive for you. Watch the video to figure out why"
NintendoSwitch,fcosa8p,t1_fcns841,1577840189.0,"its half voice acted, this is driving me nuts.  the games story is pretty lame,  the combat is ehh. as far as rpgs go theres ones that far out pace it in combat and in story so its basically running as a puzzle game and the puzzles are pretty lame.   


also crafting food is dumb as fuck and should of been stream lined."

Gamingcirclejerk,fc7trh0,t1_fc7o88i,1577518421.0,i wish i was that smart. when i did my build i basically had to have someone tell me what parts to buy cause i was so utterly lost on what cpu would work with what mobo. i realize this shit isnt rocket surgery and i more then likely was pretty drunk but yeah idk if  at the time i coulda done that.
Gamingcirclejerk,fc7tmvs,t1_fc7q2d4,1577518325.0,"thats likely true, i have no idea because besides adding an ssd and buying more of the exact same ram my pc has lasted me with zero issues 5 years.  i am def preparing for the hit on buying a new gpu when the time comes from and considering just buying a whole new rig when i need to go beyond 16 gigs and or a better cpu.   


the point i was trying to make tho was that pc gaming really isnt that cheap. especially if you are going from nothing to a full set up. to make a sweeping statement, most people have a tv before they buy a console. so its buy console buy games and play.  my other question is, how long till low performance parts last before you are unable to play new games at medium to high settings and you dropping money to build a new rig. this was my first pc build, although a 970 wasnt top of the line, it was still pretty good for the time and still is capable.    


i didnt have monitors a desk or a chair nor really the funds to purchase those things so i was playing on a very sub optimal set up. this was my old set up [https://i.imgur.com/YvGb9Tf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YvGb9Tf.jpg) before i went to [https://i.imgur.com/c4cGveu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c4cGveu.jpg) (FLEXING) changing out from the tv to monitors was like 600 bucks cause of chair and desk and my monitors are pretty freaking cheap IPS panels, not even what you really want for some games. 60hz 1080p. now, i think it would be a little bit misleading to say that my route and price points are the only viable options. a piece of lumber on top of cardboard boxes you picked out of the garbage can be a desk and you can sit on a bucket you grabbed at the same time but that aint exactly comfortable. and you dont need 2 monitors."
NoStupidQuestions,fc7ircb,t1_fc79fda,1577508714.0,Fuck that game
Gamingcirclejerk,fc7evl2,t1_fc767d7,1577505346.0,So you seem to know a good bit about hardware. When I built my first and so far only pc I was kinda overwhelmed and required a good bit if help fro. The internet. I dont think what you did is applicable to entry level people
Gamingcirclejerk,fc7c3ey,t3_egc05c,1577503098.0,"My monitor costs as much as a xbox one...


I am primarily a pc gamer but it is in no way cheap. 5 years ago I bought a 970 
 GPU 8350 CPU set up and spent around a grand. Then another 150 on mouse keyboard. I was using my tv as a monitor.

When I went to monitors i spent 270 on two cheap ips panels. I had to buy a chair for like 150 and built a custom desk for 200ish.

My set up was all new stuff but still we are talking like 2 grand here.

 My mobo is ddr3 only compatible so when I decide to go from ddr3 to ddr4 I'm looking to drop what, 200+? Going up to a 1070 or 1080 is a few hundo."
gaming,fc73d5f,t1_fc68jfe,1577496445.0,"I am not feeling this.... maybe zelda games aren't for me. This is my first zelda game sense OoT and even tho I'm bout to be heavily critical here I don't want to imply that you are wrong for loving this game. 

 I'm playing botw as well and I'm generally underwhelmed.  The shrines are all p easy and I solve them  as soon as I look at them the only puzzle that sucked was the desert divine beast. Haven't done the divine beast that's in the air yet.

The game is half voice acted and that annoys me. Like alot... Also the dialogue seems... idk forced maybe childish. I'm not sure the right phrase here but I'm not invested in the story. Yeah link slept for 100 years okay go kill ganon what ever zeldais  waiting. Played the witcher3 this year and I kinda have the same problems with that game but the story was just amazing and I played it more for the story than I did for the game play.

Coming from playing ds2 the combat seems lacking.  Just a generally underwhelming. Besides lynels everything can be killed with just pausing to eat more food. Resource management is a joke once you can kill guardians as you can just fast travel to get more arrows or food selling screws and gears. I probably have 20k in items in my stash. Ds2 lacked an (obvious) story but the satisfaction of improving and finally beating a part you are stuck at  mades me want to continue 

Crafting food is obnoxious and should have been streamlined. At least when you want to make multiples of the same thing. Or after you make something it ends up in a recipe book where all you gotta do is bash accept .Considering I haven't came across anything precooked that provides more then 5 hearts cooking seems to be a central activity. Kinda annoying it's like 9 button presses per dish. 

This is where I really think maybe the game isn't meant for me.  I have zero desire to wander around a undefined area looking for a side quests objective. Recently got the  titans remains side quest and yeah... not likely to do that with out yt.

Overall, I'd give this game a c or maybe a b. Its not unenjoyable and there are things I really  do like especially the art style but compared to other rpgs its def not as good in terms of combat or story and the unique part of it, the puzzles are all pretty easy."
LifeProTips,fc4ts0k,t1_fc4czda,1577428127.0,"maybe if spectrum didnt try and sell me bull shit with letters like ""last warning"" and other bull shit i might consider listening to them. any time i talk to them i go ""can i get just internet for less""  and they want to ""upgrade me"" to phone and internet for like twice what my current bill is.

AskReddit,fc2r9wu,t3_efqzp6,1577371706.0,"Ehh 5 and 3 year old niece and nephew doing 5 and 3 year old things. 4 hours of opening gifts can be rough. I also failed at sleeping and showed up to xmas after being awake 23 hours 

Niece got a blue tea set instead of pink. Sister got mad that she wasn't happy. My niece has a melt down over using the wrong color cup so tbh, I put that on my sister.

Nephew doesn't understand that not all gifts are his. Or that sometimes you need to be shown what to do with the gift you got.


Tbh par for the course if you ask me and more reasons why I dont want kids. I'd honestly say it was a good xmas. Just the adults dont handle the minor blow ups all that well. By the time we left I was very tired so screaming loud noises and just general kid stuff was making me irritated. Idk if that's in the kids or me tho. I'd sat more me"
