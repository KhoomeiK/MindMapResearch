keto,fc3axly,t1_fc2lbyj,1577385718.0,"I have to have very controlled cheat meals very occasionally; i haven’t been officially diagnosed but I’m acutely aware i have some kind of binge eating problem (even if it’s not necessarily a disorder), and even one cheat food could spiral out of control. I have to be very careful with it so i stick to keto as strictly as possible to prevent relapses. But I’m actually HAPPY eating the way i am and i feel good and better than i did before."
keto,fc3apa8,t1_fc2jfmj,1577385560.0,Thank you very much!!
keto,fc3an0s,t1_fc2sova,1577385518.0,"I started out very very slow. I was sedentary in work and at home, so i needed to build myself up. I started walking 3 miles a day to start, then added muscle workouts, then started doing group fitness classes at my local gym. I did have some trouble at first bc i was so out of shape but i adjusted pretty well and i can do an hour of working out now without feeling like i wanna die LOL"

keto,fc25m17,t1_fc24zqg,1577341445.0,Not at all! If you find something that works with your schedule it’ll eventually just come naturally
keto,fc24r73,t1_fc24l01,1577340382.0,"Sure!! Breakfast i have bacon and eggs, two hours later i eat tuna with seaweed and pickles, two hours later i have a prepackaged salad from the grocery store (usually like $3 each), two hours later some string cheese or 2oz off a block of cheese, and two hours after that i eat cauliflower rice with applewood smoked sausage. 

I have a lot of control issues and binge eating issues; so i eat the same thing every single day to keep it simple and make it less excusable for me mentally to cheat on my diet."
keto,fc24hzv,t1_fc24ft6,1577340078.0,Thank you!!!! I’ve been so emotional all day i couldn’t wait to post about it!!!!
