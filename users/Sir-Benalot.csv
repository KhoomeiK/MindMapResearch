Sorry my point is: there is no ideological equivalence between neo-nazis and climate change activists. As much as you try to pass off hyperbole as literal death threats. 

Also worth noting you are using some specific language said by some student on some forum, as if it were the manifesto of an entire movement that includes mums and dads, school children, the elderly and everyone in between, now you see even liberal politicians jumping on the band wagon.

The Australian white nationalists got Frazer ‚Äòfinal solution‚Äô Anning.

Last year he denied two requests for a meeting with a joint committee of ex-fire chiefs trying to warn him the country was facing a horror fire season. 

In November last year when the first of the bad fires were underway the opposition leader wanted to have a meeting with PM and all state premiers (‚ÄòCOAG‚Äô - council of Australian governments) to rally assets and form plans. This meeting was also rejected. 

Right now he could be on the phone to northern hemisphere world leaders and maybe ask to borrow their water bombers. He could even allow HMAS Albatros (the RAN airwing based in Nowra) to deploy their water bombing helicopters... none of this has happened.

TL:DR - our PM is a tone deaf climate change denying happy clapper."
