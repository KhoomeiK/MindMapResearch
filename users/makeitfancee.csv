Someone asked me about my uni hoodie and I told them the truth- that I just like the hoodie itself."

bipolar,fek7yuv,t3_epkb2n,1579194498.0,"Prozac made me manic, delusional, and sent me to the hospital. My pilldoc won’t put me on any sort of ssri antidepressant for fear that I could go swinging. 

People with bipolar disorder(especially type 1) have to be very careful about antidepressants. I’m surprised your doc gave you Prozac. 

If you think you might be getting manic, call your doc! It sounds like you are

Edit: added a few words"
bipolar,fek7dxn,t3_epkeei,1579194150.0,Morning👋🏼
bipolar,fek790f,t1_fek70iy,1579194068.0,"No, I stopped taking it on my own. I stopped because of the increased anxiety and heart rate. But when I see him next week I’ll find out what he’ll put me on next. I’m also supposed to take klonopin but it makes me too tired so I stopped that too"
bipolar,fek713i,t3_epkfo3,1579193939.0,I went through a period of a few months last year where I would cycle multiple times within the same day. It was terrible.

bipolar,fejvesy,t1_fejfw6x,1579186745.0,I’m not able to cut it and tapper. I don’t know if my pilldoc will give me another antipsychotic. I see him next week
bipolar,fejipep,t1_fej2wpy,1579175980.0,I think you should tell them. Your physical health is still important!
bipolar,feiecm6,t1_feibhva,1579136537.0,"The thing is, the lowest dose of vraylar is 1.5mg capsules. So I can't cut them in half."
bipolar,feie9pt,t1_feiawxa,1579136483.0,Really? Did your doc say anything about it(if you don't mind me asking)?
bipolar,fei17v7,t1_fei0qn1,1579128063.0,"I want to quit because ever since I’ve been taking it I’ve been experiencing severe anxiety (well first latuda started it but then I switched to vraylar and it continued). My ocd has also gotten worse. And my heart rate has been higher. 

I saw my pilldoc yesterday but he wants me to up the vraylar to 3mg(which I took last night). I just can’t take this anymore. So I want to stop the vraylar to see if I’ll feel better.

Edit: i don’t see my pilldoc until next week"

mentalhealth,fc6o39r,t1_fc6kjah,1577485204.0,"> But the thing is, when you’re depressed you usually can’t control your negative thoughts. 

I agree, it can be really hard to control the negative thoughts while in a depressive sate, if at all possible. Some people make it seem or think that it's so easy to do."
mentalhealth,fc6gbwi,t1_fc631fi,1577479908.0,The changing the mindset part really gets me because that’s not easy! How does one even do that? What does that really mean?
mentalhealth,fc5z2xa,t1_fc5jxbn,1577468815.0,"I can relate to this in regards to myself. 

Sometimes I feel pressured or guilty about ‘getting better’ whenever my mom starts talking “when you’re better and this doesn’t effect you”. When in reality, this is probably with me for the long run."
mentalhealth,fc5ypli,t1_fc5jdk0,1577468610.0,"Yes, this right here. If it goes away for some people and never comes back, that’s great! But that’s not the case for everyone. And maybe for some people it comes and goes throughout life. But people saying “Your depression will leave if you just do this!” is unrealistic and not always true. I used to get that false hope from motivational videos after they would say how their’s went away permanently. I learned that’s not how it works out for everyone."
bipolar,fbxta4u,t3_ef0dcd,1577199920.0,"I feel this way with everyone, including my family. As in, I try to hide things from people as best as I can. I try to act “normal” as best as I can. The only person that has seen the most of me is my psychologist. 

I do sometimes feel like I have something to hide. I guess I don’t want to be judged. Or looked at in a different way. I go by the ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’. If someone doesn’t ask me about my mental illnesses, I don’t tell them about it. Although, I have been opening up a little bit more towards my mom about them."
