bipolar,ff8dian,t1_ff7ct8o,1579673972.0,Thank you!
bipolar,ff7ak1v,t1_ff79t6q,1579644699.0,"For me, yeah it did. Took a while but my brain adjusted for sure. After 6-9 months it wasn't an issue. It seems like a long time but definitely wasn't considering it supplied me with 4 years of stability"
bipolar,ff7ahzn,t1_ff7a7r4,1579644652.0,"If you are a part of this sub you know plenty of people on four. I'm on five. You probably know plenty of people in your life on 2 or more, not even for bipolar but for a myriad of other mental health issues. I appreciate your apology but I hope you try to be more thoughtful in the future."
bipolar,ff7a2zu,t1_ff71ncc,1579644310.0,"Bipolar 1 Ultrarad here, I was on lamictal and Lexapro (ssri antidepressant) for years with excellent stability."
bipolar,ff79wl5,t1_ff72kno,1579644166.0,"Dude what the hell. You're all over this telling people that meds are ok and then doubling back and saying 4 is too many? 

You seem to be high functioning, I'm glad 150mg of lamictal is working for you. Do not presume to interject yourself into anyone else's med regiment that they've decided on with their doctors. You have no business telling people what is or isn't too many. 

Also, not everyone has the same easy reaction to meds you do. Some of us really struggle to find ones that work and I find all of your posts terribly condescending. You may know your disorder but you certainly don't know mine. 

My medicine HAS to numb me a little or a lot in order to manage my symptoms. How exactly are you sure that it's not supposed to numb you? Do you have experience with severe bipolar? Ultrarad?  It's not as black and white as you're making it seem. Your original post may have had good intentions but the rest of it is reading like you think you know better."
bipolar,ff73sgd,t1_ff69lm2,1579640548.0,Sauce please? Lots of armchair pharmacology here.
bipolar,ff73m7z,t1_ff6xbyv,1579640449.0,Where are you getting this??
bipolar,ff73ire,t1_ff6tz5m,1579640394.0,"I had the same. Loss of words, memory, all that. The mania was worse so I just stuck with it."
bipolar,ff72wyb,t1_ff6mjj0,1579640048.0,Thanks I hate this
bipolar,ff72t80,t1_ff6p7rj,1579639989.0,You had me at 'does not fuck with your weight'
bipolar,ff72mzg,t1_ff6qxla,1579639889.0,"I'm not so sure it's a failure thing- at least in my experience. The med side effects can sometimes be worse than the bipolar, and playing musical meds while trying to figure out the right cocktail can be really traumatizing. It makes sense that some people would pick the devil they know."
bipolar,ff729ul,t1_ff6ubbq,1579639681.0,HAHAHA. All the yes.

Thanks for the comforting words. Helps so much"
bipolar,fefhh1y,t1_fefgpi3,1579056413.0,"I'm sorry for your fog. It's the worst. Thank you for responding.

Wish I could lose weight! I'm binge eating on Buspar and Seroquel after sustained and hard earned weight loss. Doesn't help, for sure. Just weaned off Lexapro after four  years and she stuck me on Wellbutrin only for a week because It made me stoned out of my mind. Wellbutrin was off a week ago, Lexapro two days ago so who knows which one it is."
bipolar,fefgz4o,t3_eol4ss,1579056117.0,How does one rapid learn?? I'm so intrigued! Arabic is so beautiful
bipolar,fefgj2r,t3_eoul1s,1579055848.0,"I hear you. Went for a decade without any support due to finances. You will make it! 

Maybe look into local hospitals that do charity and outreach work - they may have student therapists who will see you at no or low cost. Not the best or ideal scenario but something may be better than nothing. 

We are all here together"

bipolar,fcbgvu7,t3_egu5ec,1577586708.0,Some pharmacies will do an emergency stop gap for two or three days worth. It's worth asking where you fill if they do that. I don't know those meds - I know they won't stop gap controlled meds though. That's saved my ass from withdrawals a few times
HomeImprovement,fbt0kmr,t1_fbsloba,1577065120.0,"Why the hell is this, anyway?? I feel like I'm a good homeowner - I understand about issues and time delays and cost expectation vs reality but I'll be great goddamned if i don't have to pull teeth to get any information or movement on a project we're paying five grand for. 

It's been six weeks. Put up the tiny effing piece of drywall behind the toilet so I can't wave to the person in the kitchen while taking a crap. Might as well cut em loose and learn to tape and mud."
