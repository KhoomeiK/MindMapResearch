BeAmazed,fes8f1d,t1_fes1sqq,1579362506.0,"Ah the post expert, post truth society. The death of expertise. Where knowledge and professional input is regarded as equal as laymen’s opinion.

homelab,feibfi8,t3_eoxuhy,1579134577.0,Is there any reason you can’t just get a cheap 6th+ generation i3 or i5 build and utilize quick sync? Unless I’m missing something it looks like you’re trying to move a molehill with a bulldozer :D I think even a low end celeron with quicksync can do 18-20+ simultaneous 1080p transcodes

WTF,fdp6ble,t1_fdp3rga,1578621022.0,"It can be yes. But unless you’re buying it direct from the insurance company at an auction and can see the waterline, you’ll never know.

politics,fdexve9,t1_fdeuqql,1578348912.0,Hard to say without more information. But my likely guess is your WiFi router is overheating from the constant high volume of traffic from your downloads. Many typical consumer routers are so cheaply built they just can’t handle much. You’ll likely see a good performance (or at least reliability/stability) boost if you go wired instead of wireless.
