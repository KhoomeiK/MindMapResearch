I use it in alsorts of stuff and has its own simple language so you can program logic into actions etc.  There is a metric fuck ton of stuff you can do if you take the time to get into it but even at its simplest level it will press hotkeys for you based on a spoken word or phrase.

If I'm gonna go for a Pimax, mine will be the 5K XR as it has OLED's which will be better for me as I play Elite Dangerous so I want my blacks black.

As for XTAL - They have started work on a consumer version of their headset so keep your eyes peeled for news.

YAW: How is this gonna work while using a HOTAS or wheel?  The HOTAS still has to be connected to the PC somehow but how do you address the fact that a user will be spinning around?  How can you interface a mobile HOTAS with a static PC without cable distasters?

I noticed at CES they had people using a wireless XBox controller but no way is that gonna fly with simmers (pun intended !), they'll want the proper kit and so would I."

Walk up to it and look at it and it will appear.  Its supposed to give you an indication of what you're looking at and its horrible.  I don't need an indication, I know what I'm looking at lol

I already have that but it doesn't explain what the numbers are above a mobs head, what affliction counters what Inspiration, what that circle of dashes actually mean that appears around your character on attacks for instance.  I know is mostly a max range indicator for that last point but depending on the attack you can so stuff outside that circle without actually moving so id like to understand what exactly it represents in more detail.
