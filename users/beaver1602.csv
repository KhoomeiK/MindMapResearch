AntifascistsofReddit,ff9fu1m,t1_ff9cuai,1579712107.0, I never considered myself right wing I was always a left leaning moderate. I would say my skepticism of the government providing health insurance for everyone at least according to my therapist stems from my parents opting to take stuff away from me when they punished me instead of spanking me. To me anything the government provides me is leverage they have over me. I’m scared that the government can provide health insurance for everyone getting rid of all the private options. Then when they want stuff like a border wall they can decided to take it away unless it gets funded like when they held the whole government ransoms last year. I know I’m paranoid but it just what it is for me.

As far as the Warren and Sanders thing, Warren is way more radical on how much she is willing to make the government spend than Sanders is. Raising an the income tax rate is one thing but a wealth tax is a whole other thing. That tax taxes everything from bank deposit, to estimated value of cars and real estate, to insurance and pensions. Things they already paid taxes on. Once they decide they can do that they will 100% do it to the middle class over time. The government doesn’t want a better functioning society they want more and more money so they funnel trillions of dollars into the CIA and the war machine. At least on the side of making the government an even bigger all encompassing monster Sanders is nice and good person.

It’s not supposed be a factual movie more of an alternate time line that’s different but the same to our own. Like when Superman stoped the Cuban missal crisis or the watchman fighting in Vietnam it simply is a movie being a good person in the right place at the right time. Jenny being a ous had less to do with her abuse and more to do with the free love of the 60’s that Forrest wouldn’t understand. Bubba wasn’t meant to be mentally disable he was just a guy with a deep drawl that would cause other people to look down on him but because forest has a child like quality to himself doesn’t have the capacity to judge some one based on that so they become friends. The movie is a lot of what if’s bout history that is meant to put a smile on your face.
