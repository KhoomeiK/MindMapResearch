Art - Would spend $150 for some nice markers. Would spend another $300 for a class and/or a good software (like photoshop).

Cooking - total $250 at max. Always wanted to try allspice (wooow such a monumental purchase). Would get 2 candy thermometers (1 to replace my mom's that I broke, 1 for me). Would buy shrimp because I love it, large-grained white rice, and some seafood that I haven't tried before. Food does fall under cooking, right?

Baking - Pastry cutter and other varius utensils (~$50). Also always have wanted a real icecream machine, like the ones on tv (my guess is $250).

ack there's still $500 left...

I'd either use that to
1) ignore the first sentence I said and get a VR set or nitendo switch or ps4 or whatever

2) start a new hobby (likely construction related, e.g. woodworking or a robot, etc)

Downside: I don't see my friends super often and get sore of sitting at my desk all day. I also don't have the opportunity for some classes, like art :(

I would choose hearing what people say about me. For one, there's a lot of risks with choosing the phone. What if that person barely uses their phone, what if nothing they say is useful to you?

Choosing option one (the phone) only gives you access to what ONE person is saying. I could easily get obsessed with one person's life, opinions, secrets, etc. that don't affect me in the long run.   
If I choose option two, I can hear things from everyone. I can use what I hear from my friends to try to be a better person (e.g. maybe I have an anger issue I didn't realize?), while ignoring what lowlifes say about me.

my religion sees being gay/lesbian as wrong. First of all let me clarify, I would never confront someone or get mad at someone just for being LGBTQ, and I respect people's identity and how they feel they are. I treat them like anyone else. I do my best to learn and understand them.

I don't think it is morally wrong to be friends with, for example, a lesbian. But, I do believe it is morally wrong *for me* to be in a sexual relationship with a transman (meaning ftm), as according to my religion, that would make me a lesbian. I would not stop being friends with the person, just due to my beliefs would not be in a romantic relationship. Essentially, I don't expect the world to go out of their way to please my religion and ""not be gay"", I simply would wish that people respect my personal choice to follow my religion and to be upfront (in a relationship setting) if they are trans. I don't hate gays/lesbians(or any others) personally, I just don't want to be one.
