There are social chameleons in the work place! 

Many people fake a personality set because it’s profitable, this leaves the individual exhausted and frustrated at the end of the day.

In depth personality traits and assessments can show this but cost a bit. People have work personalities, personal personalities and they are also modified by stress or pleasure!"

Harness two of the rascals and make bitch mommy and Tyrone pull you using two of them next time. 

Just send them inside to get the scooters and a flat pallet cart, then tie the flat cart handle to the back of the scooters and viola! Comfortably cruise the store giving them directions as needed. 


That’s what I do."

No one concept or idea is going to solve all problems. 

To quote the late great Zig Ziglar:

“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing - that’s why we recommend it daily.”

Any new idea that gets people to reset their goal setting is valuable. Keep teaching, they’ll keep learning. 

Also, the 12 week year or quarterly goal reporting is good and if have never read Ron Willingham, you are missing out. Ron was one of the most brilliant humans to ever teach communication and selling. You might not be “selling” in theory but we are all advocating for action, and that’s a lot like “selling.”
