Music,fewjous,t3_eqrqfp,1579412014.0,"**Norman F---ing Rockwell!** by Lana del Rey: Each track is different in its own way, yet they are all distinct. Lana's angelic voice could cuss you out and you wouldn't flinch. 

**the masquerade** and **plum blossom** by mxmtoon: the first is mxmtoon's debut album and the second is her debut EP. I like her EP more because it's more stripped down; that's when she was still making music in her bedroom. 

**Death of a Bachelor** by Panic! at the Disco: Out of all their albums, this is the one with the highest concentration of songs I like from them.

**thank u, next** by Ariana Grande: Highly basic but this is hands down my favorite album."

Not. The. Damn. Asshole. 

God, that's terrible. I thought my parents were bad but this is a whole new level of terrible. Borderline abusive? Not sure but sounds like harassment. If she was doing this to someone else and they found out, this would be illegal. But unfortunately she's your ""parent"" and she's doing this to you. Right of you not to trust her."
unpopularopinion,fefhzry,t3_eokvph,1579056719.0,I agree with you! Except it sucks in school when most of us are too lazy to bring an umbrella and we're running through the rain like crazy hooligans trying to get to class. I say this exact same thing and my friends think I'm crazy. I love the concept of staying in with your dog on the sofa with a warm cup of chamomile tea and a good book. Bonus points if it's heavy rain and there's thunder.

depression,fe0hv9t,t1_fe069b4,1578813676.0,i've previously tried to tell my parents to take me to a professional but i think they assumed i was exaggerating or lying about wanting to do something. so now i just bottle it up which i know is not healthy but i do it anyways. i'm trying my best to hang in there and my friends are helping a lot but it's difficult with my family. especially as i'm exploring my sexuality and my laptop is prone to being controlled/searched. i try my best to talk to my friends online without revealing too much and leaving traces but it's hard.

demisexuality,fdwsecg,t1_fdvrzbu,1578761924.0,"The problem is I'm not really allowed to look up stuff about sexuality/lgbtq+ information because there's a software on my laptop (I have no phone) that tracks whatever I do and blocks certain topics. However, by talking to my friends and using school computers I'm slowly figuring out more about it.

I know I'm definitely heteroromantic (at least, at this point in time). The hard thing is really the sexual part because at this point I really don't care about having sex since I am a) a teenager and b) I'm not sexually attracted to any guy. Maybe my ex-boyfriend but I'm still puzzling over that. 

But thank you so much for your response, it's actually helped me understand demisexuality a lot!"
lgbt,fdpsjfc,t1_fdpovvt,1578638805.0,"Thank you so much! I needed this. I think I may be gray ace/ demisexual, though I need more time to parse through what it really means. 

The weird thing is that I'm het both sexually and romantically but I have no aesthetic attraction towards guys, only towards females. It's also really hard for me to have physical attraction like hugging, holding hands, kissing etc. I only have physical attraction if I really, really like a person. I'm not sure whether I was also sexually attracted to them but I guess I'll sift through my feelings and get back to it. 

Thank you so much for your response because I am not sex-repulsed or sex-indifferent but I don't think I feel sexual attraction??? I need to think about it and this helped me a lot!"
lgbt,fdpsa59,t1_fdppjzs,1578638529.0,"A lot of nonbinary use ""they/them"" which is also becoming acceptable as a general pronoun when you don't know the gender of the person in question. I belive some people also use ze/zir, though I haven't seen that in real life yet. Most I know are they/them. However, it's a good idea to ask someone their pronouns beforehand so you know what they would like to be called. 

I'm probably not the best person to ask since I'm not nonbinary but this is what I've heard!"
lgbt,fdot7g3,t1_fdmghhk,1578612333.0,"Well since they identify as nonbinary they should be called by their pronouns (most commonly ""their""). Biologically they are still male or female but they don't feel like they need/are a gender, they present as more neutral and androgynous. Regardless of what gender they were born as, they should be respected and called their name (if they have changed it to something more gender neutral) and their pronouns."
lgbt,fdllvjv,t1_fdlkpnp,1578526966.0,"I'm not nonbinary but I can answer this question!

Sex and gender are two different things. Sex is basically what you are at birth (ie, based on genital organs). There are generally two sexes: male and female. (I'm not sure what it's called when you have both male and female genital organs but I think that also counts as a sex?) What you're referring to is sex. 

What nonbinary talks about is gender. (This is treading into unfamiliar territory so please correct me if I'm wrong.) Gender is what you feel like as a part of your identity."
