nihilism,ff647y8,t3_ero5wc,1579618720.0,"Copying my response from an earlier post:

I knew a guy who killed himself.  He thought it was the logical thing to do.  He was intelligent but  had mental issues, lived entirely alone through government assistance and isolated himself to the point where he really only talked to people online.  He thought about it for a long time before he did it.  He was absolutely sure that it was the right thing to do.

We weren't friends, I don't know if he was really capable of true friendship, or at least he didn't seem to want that from anyone.  But I still think about him, and I do miss him being around, even if he wasn't a particularly pleasant person.  He had his place in this world.  And now he's gone.  I don't think that's good or bad.  I don't think it's logical or irrational. I don't think it really means much at all, just like the birds chirping and dust blowing around, it's just a bunch of stuff happening.

I think this guy could have lived a different life.  He was a victim of circumstances, including his own sour disposition.  I believe he could have been helped, but nobody was helping.  I don't believe he had the means to help himself.  And I know it doesn't matter much either way.  But it still makes me sad when I think about him, who he was and who he could have been today.  Even though it doesn't really matter and it's all just a bunch of stuff happening, tweets and chirps, I would have liked it to have happened differently than it did."

Nihilists are like a bellows.
Empty, yet full of hot air, 
The more they bellow, the smaller they seem; 
The Stranger also rambles and loses his train of thought 
But tells a purty good story.

The tumbleweeds do not last long, 
Nor does the Dude. 
If the Stranger’s words do not last 
Why should those of man?

The World is shaped by taking it easy."

AskReddit,fekj3a5,t3_epj100,1579201099.0,"Random Adventure Roguelike II.

It's a mobile game with minimal old-school graphics, basically you explore randomly generated maps while leveling up your character.  Choose between different skill paths, learn crafting abilities and gather materials to craft better weapons and armor, learn spells or make potions, train wild beasts to become your pets and fight in your battles... I think there are a few different approaches to the game.  Also go on random quests to earn more gold. Pretty fun time sink."

nihilism,feiepxv,t1_fei00mu,1579136787.0,"My acquaintance definitely thought he was making a logical decision too, but whether it was logical or not doesn't matter much to me.  Even if it was a very logical decision and I am just some fool, I still miss his presence, his contribution to the conversation, his place in this world that now feels empty to me.  I know that he could have been happier, he could have done more with his life had things happened differently.   He was so sure of himself.  His pride is what killed him.  He was so sure he was right about suicide, but I've seen him change his opinion about things before.  I remember years and years ago, he was staunchly against drug use.  For years and years he talked about how stupid marijuana is, and it showed how much better he thought of himself for never trying it.  Until one day he acquired legal cannabis, decided to try it out, I forget exactly why.  But I do know it opened a whole new world for him, eventually leading to him doing various nootropics and smoking dmt.

But while he changed his mind on experimenting with drugs, he still killed himself before he could experience much else that life has to offer.   He never so much as kissed a girl.  I still believe he could have lived a good life, had he left his apartment and tried to live it a little.  He probably was not able to do that on his own.  And I feel like it's such a waste.  His life could have been so much more.  Even though it wouldn't really matter very much, I know I would have liked it if things had happened differently."

This great unity we are all a part of had been called by many name.  God.  The Tao.  Reality.  And life is like being scooped up out of this, shaped and formed and breathing and able to see and think and communicate and imagine.  It's a beautiful dream.  And God or whatever is always asking you if you want the dream to end, if you want to slip back in and let go, to stop clinging to life, to stop clinging to your habits and your ideas about who and what you are, to stop thinking and feeling and just let it all go.  And life is just us saying ""no thanks, not yet.""

But we all say yes in the end.  We all get to the end.  Eventually life will become heavy.  It will be to hard to keep going.  So tempting to stop clinging and to let go.

I like being alive.  I like being a person, having thoughts, living life.  Even if it's a dream."
