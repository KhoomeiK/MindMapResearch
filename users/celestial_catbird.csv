proplifting,feohjon,t1_feixe6k,1579300273.0,"It's basically the same as with any succulent. If you want to do it by leaf propagation, you just need to carefully twist off the leaves you want from your plant. Be careful not to tear the part of the leaf that attaches to the plant as that is the part that will sprout roots and a baby succ. Leave the leaves out for a few days to callous over a bit so they don't rot, then place them on top of the soil in a tray or pot. Jade leaf props tend to take their sweet time growing, so just be really patient, they manage in the end. The faster way to propagate jade is to take stem cuttings, although you obviously won't get quite as many that way, so I use both methods. If you have a good sized jade plant, you can cut off one of the branches, maybe a few inches or so with the leaves attached. Leave the cutting to callous over for about two or so days, then stand it upright in a pot so it can root. Hope this helps!"
