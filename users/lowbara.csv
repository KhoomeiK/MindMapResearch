ADHD,fepr5e8,t1_fepr0ca,1579328489.0,Thank you. Ive had a couple days i  which my heart at resting is reaching 98bpm but its rare. so i guess thats why i may stress. but ill just.. go for it. i just always get anxiety when i start meds.
adhdmeme,fefw3gp,t3_enfwj1,1579067100.0,I RARELY watch movies and everyone i know looks at me like i just raised the dead. like theyre ashamed and disgusted.. like you think i could SIT STILL for that long. i have to take 65 breaks when watching an episode of some anime thats 24mins long!!

adhdmeme,fefvopi,t3_eoaah9,1579066709.0,my issue is... that 2 matches was too many...
ADHD,fecrg2n,t3_eoepwt,1578981819.0,i can relate. i needed sudden time off due to a mental breakdown and my dept manager and my store manager looked st me and told me that my health comes first and they will be happy to bring me back when i feel better. and i was so.. touched that i was cared for as a HUMAN at my job. i had to fill out paperwork to go back but i was welcomed back easily. even after almost 2 months gone.
depression,fecowem,t1_fecjp3i,1578979477.0,i posted my comment in the wrong place and it was long. but its said that it doesnt seem like brain fog because its not a tired feeling or like.. just like.. general forgetfulness. its like im talking normally and BAM its all  blank. nothing for 15 second and then im back and i feel fine except i remember nothing of the current conversation. i ask what i was saying and get back on track once reminded. i read it could be a adhd thing which i was diagnosed with recently. i lived my entire life thinking it was normal but turns out i wasnt like the other kids and i have always had adhd (mostly add). however this is a new symptom. thats why i worry.

depression,fdcsmyn,t3_eknyi3,1578283174.0,"im there with ya.. why keep working just so that the uppers can make millions... Why study, why go to school.. working gives me nothing but money that i use to pay bills and thats it. never have enough to travel. and if i do it ends and its back the the routine. it gets tiring. like why do we keep doing the same thing. over and over all day for little reward and a lot of our time gone. idk i get you though. fuck this"
depression,fdcrw4p,t3_ekmg5o,1578282552.0,not only do i think about it.. i have in my own ways. nothing too dramatic cause i have anxiety lmao.
depression,fdcrbnf,t1_fdcr4h5,1578282122.0,I hope the best for you. and know that you can go at your own pace. and if you tell people you feel like youre losing them and that theyre running too fast ahead.. they should listen. hopefully we can get better soon. even if by a little.
depression,fdcr0y1,t3_ekh6lr,1578281900.0,i was actively threatened by an incel that he would doxx me and come to my house to horrifcly kill me and i was like.. ok... like... sounds good ig. im feeling especially bad today  we can meet up at mine. ull figure it out.
depression,fdcq9eu,t3_ekng7n,1578281332.0,"honestly im tired of these weed doctors out here telling me weed will cure me. i personally hate the smell of the stuff. and idc if it ""gets better when smoking it"" idont want to breathe smoke into my lungs. i do not want to have to rely on a plant that puts me ""under the influence"" whenever im sad or depressed. like weed is very good for many people. but know that it simply is not what everyone wants. i have bad reactions and get paranoid and idc if it gets better the second time. the first time was the worst. So no. i probably wont smoke weed. but im happy for those qho have found it to be useful for them and their recovery."
depression,fdcnxc1,t3_ekjdmh,1578279613.0,i absolutely feel like this. most of my friends are graduated or in college living fulfilling lives. i watched some get married. and they are genrally moving so fast and doing such fulfilling this and im here.. a 24 year old baby who has no talents or achievements under her belt. i get it.
depression,fdcl27a,t1_fdckr3o,1578277560.0,"Thank you. i mean ita not like it helps when people say they get it. but you at least feel like your symptoms and behaviors are validated and NOT your personality but your depression. 

I can easily separate what thoughts and moods are depression and which are me. but i simply just.. do not care anymore. i wasnt even forced to go out. i wanted to. it was just that it wasnt anything. like my therapist made it seem if i leave my house id feel better. but i felt the same in tighter pants.."
depression,fdck9xy,t3_cml6ni,1578276998.0,im doing so badly right now. time to talk to my doctor again. for the 3rd time in 5 days.
