assholedesign,fepluf7,t1_fenm2m9,1579323909.0,The law that forbids sex discrimination is a federal law. It’s illegal in the entire country. Maybe it’s like cannabis and the federal government is just not enforcing it. Sex discrimination isn’t something they can really turn a blind eye to though.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe2va3d,t1_fe2rmng,1578843265.0,"Not really the same. I totally agree that civil asset forfeiture is absolutely corrupt. But bribes go into the policemen’s pockets. CAF goes to the department to use as they see fit. It’s the departments as a whole that are taking bribes. And they do it right in the open and are not remorseful in any way. 

They’re out here literally ruining people’s lives so that they can steal their money with no wrongdoing on the victims part, and no due process. At least the police taking bribes are taking small amounts at a time so they can milk them endlessly. Here they milk you once and rip your tits off and take em with."
RedDeadOnline,fdxwhgc,t1_fdvsecl,1578773616.0,"That’s actually a workaround for the lack of animals. If you do a mission from Maggie at the bootlegger shack and call in your hunting wagon you can fill it up. There’s plenty of animals and it lets you call in your hunting wagon. Used to be you could do a legendary bounty but only a couple let you call in your wagon anymore and you can’t skin anything. 

All the workarounds for the lack of animals have slowly been screwed up by R* over time. If it’s a glitch that we have to do to overcome their lack of animals, I can’t see why they keep breaking the fixes that the players come up with. It’s almost like they don’t want us hunting at all. If a lobby goes below a certain amount of players the animals start to spawn so we know there’s a fix they could temporarily implement to keep us hunting. 

Even the bootlegger was unplayable until a week or so ago. Now we have a coin that gives you a different coin than what it’s supposed to and the most valuable collection can’t be completed until they fix it. The bounty hunter gives me the least money of all the trades and requires the most work. 

It’s been so broken lately that I get on just to do a couple challenges to keep my streak alive. My dailies streak is at like 108 days so I’m not willing to completely walk away til they fix it but every single aspect of the game has something wrong with it so it’s been frustrating to say the least."

RedDeadCollector,fdtrimo,t3_en2p2g,1578721070.0,It tells you the prices in your collectors bag. You can see which collections are almost full too so you can figure out a route based on what’s worth more and which collections are almost full. The flowers aren’t worth much but I tend to be almost full on flowers all the time because you tend to run into them a lot when you’re doing other stuff. If I only need 1 or 2 to fill a collection I’ll add them to the route cause it’s easy money.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdtlqxr,t1_fdtjuky,1578718594.0,You like to get into arguments with people and keep a monotone and use your particular version of smooth talking instead of having a good point. It’s like spinning in the mud with you guys.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdtitm0,t1_fdsl4so,1578717375.0,"Listen Tad, you’re just wrong.We can find a flaw in what you are saying because it is extremely flawed. I know too many people older than me that are absolutely worthless and I don’t respect them one bit. Maybe change your stupid saying to “Respect your elders who have more experience and knowledge but ignore all the jackasses who don’t have knowledge and experience.”"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdthq6k,t1_fdshocc,1578716928.0,"If it’s a professor, doctor, cop, firemen, or ANYONE, they deserve your respect only if they earn it. So you’re saying I should respect Jerry Sandusky or Larry Nassar because they’re older than me? Respect your elders only applies to children. For a professor to say that a dm is unprofessional is ridiculous. If it was his student maybe. This was a high school student that was just asking a question. He could have just answered instead of being a jerk."
PSVR,fdtd90y,t1_fdsycof,1578715106.0,"I wasn’t sure because there’s an actual thing called flatgaming that has nothing to do with what’s being discussed. It’s like homemade, very simplistic games."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdsrrqo,t1_fdsg95k,1578707102.0,"This right here! The student was totally wrong to go off like that. The professor put himself on a high pedestal and looked down on him. At a certain time in the past, the same could be said about email. At one point it wasn’t adapted by too many people yet. In that time, sending an email could have elicited the same response: Could you be a little more professional and fax that over?"
PSVR,fdspjqm,t1_fdsea84,1578706283.0,What do you mean by flatgaming?
fightporn,fdslmvy,t1_fdrjjbl,1578704787.0,"Fuuuck NO! I’ve seen this post so many times now. It’s pathetic to see someone else’s post and want the worthless internet points so much that you STEAL someone else’s original content and try to pass it off as your own. Nobody cares how often anybody uses Reddit. Filter it by hot and if it’s worth watching you’ll find it. It doesn’t need to be posted again and again and again til I can’t even stand the sight of it. 

A bit extreme is wanting everyone else to be annoyed by repetitive content so that people who only view Reddit an hour or less a day don’t have to do the extremely hard task of going into a drop down menu and select Hot. And if you miss it, I guarantee you that some karmawhore will set a reminder to repost it in 30 days. GUARANTEED"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdsjb4x,t1_fdsg10g,1578703842.0,"I agree. The owner is more of a piece of shit in this situation. EVERBODY says their dog never bites someone, until it does, then they’re so surprised that an animal famous for biting people bit someone. Keep your dogs on your property and don’t just let them roam free in public. So many dog owners are so entitled and irresponsible, it blows my mind."

facepalm,fdrucvf,t1_fdqjc3e,1578689858.0,"Germs, dumbass. And it’s super effective. I don’t know about you, but I see someone with a mask and I assume they have the plague and avoid them as such. All these people have already said this, wearing a mask is accepted differently in different societies. Here in the US it’s not as acceptable because of all the racist fucks who see other races with a mask and get suspicious and wonder what they’re hiding. THEY’RE HIDING GERMS!!! The people with shit to hide know how racist we are and don’t use masks because that brings attention to them. Sounds like Canada isn’t any better."

StonerCringe,fdna6qm,t3_cge0ah,1578581322.0,"WTF is this 6 month old idiotic post doing here? All I have to say is that the LEGAL drug alcohol causes more problems and death than any of the illegal drugs. Hypocrisy is such a burden on our society that if everyone stopped being a fucking hypocrite, we’d be doing ok instead of on the brink of disaster. Had Prohibition happened at a time when the police had the technology and ability to stop it, that poison would have been successfully eradicated."
MurderedByWords,fdn6xvo,t1_fdlogv6,1578578970.0,"Nobody said anything. Ops post is hypothetical. What I’d like to know is how many people commenting about things that require extensive experience with swords actually have experience with swords. It sounds like everyone here is an expert but I’d bet there’s only a small amount of actual experienced people commenting. Most people saying with utmost confidence what is required to wield a sword, have never held a sword in their hands outside of a knife store. Why do so many people with zero experience on a subject act like experts on the subject?"
IdiotsInCars,fdmfylf,t1_fdk58g8,1578548603.0,"Thank you to whoever awarded me for that comment. I know the comment has negative karma, but it’s quite the coincidence that my negative karma is about the same as this guy’s positive karma. I suspect that this person has 10+ accounts and lures people into bashing bicyclists and then aggressively downvotes his opponents with all his accounts and upvotes his entitled responses. He posted something that would invite criticism, and then used multiple accounts to downvote his critics. Narcissistic much?!"
Wellthatsucks,fdm9yei,t1_fdm3gny,1578543515.0,Glass has a way of getting in the craziest places. It’s not worth the consequences. You swallow one piece of glass and it could literally kill you with a thousand cuts. It has the potential to cut you from the throat all the way to the asshole. The whole digestive tract is one of the least sterile parts of the body. Glass can perforate your stomach or intestines and leak bacteria into your body cavities causing sepsis. Not a good way to go.
gtaonline,fdkxpc0,t1_fdktqd6,1578513307.0,"Just shut the fuck up already. First you’re super over aggressive about something with little to no importance. Second, you act like some kind of super genius that can tell why people do everything they do, but you’re not even smart enough to make sense of this. The game must have also voted to kick you because you’re just that big of an asshole."
gtaonline,fdkrb1z,t1_fdkdyqd,1578509521.0,"You’re overgeneralizing and basically saying that everybody thinks the same way and that you can tap into what they are thinking. Also you say you don’t THINK they can. If you don’t KNOW, don’t say anything.  If what this guy says is true, a modder just has to tell the game that a person was voted out and it will kick them and send them a notification."
IdiotsInCars,fdkqhd3,t1_fdkhkra,1578509031.0,"Where I live the law says come to a complete stop ALWAYS. There is no exception for bikes. The law says they have to come to a complete stop, not rolling stop. It’s illegal and it’s still a human making the decision so there will be mistakes. More importantly people develop habits and running stop signs as a habit means that eventually you will do it out of habit when you shouldn’t and people’s lives will be ruined. There is no excuse for running stop signs on a bicycle. The reason I say this is because I have almost killed bicyclists on two occasions, both ran a 2 way stop sign and I didn’t have a stop sign so I was going 25mph and had to lock up the brakes. On one occasion it was so close that if I had sneezed or turned the ac up at that moment, that man would be dead and I would have to live with having killed someone and the memory of their mangled body would haunt me forever. Considering that the consequences for making a mistake on the road are death or injury, maybe don’t be so selfish and think of the other people on the road. It’s not all about you and your entitlement. It’s illegal and people who do it are assholes."
gtaonline,fdk90or,t1_fdk8jou,1578498815.0,I agree there are differences. The biggest being that on PC there are modders . You can’t be sure if it was game mechanics or a modder
IdiotsInCars,fdk8409,t1_fdk6yys,1578498235.0,"I agree. I come to a complete stop at every stop sign and light. It’s not worth hurting someone to be a little faster. I would do the same on a bike, even if the other bicyclists made fun of me."

IdiotsInCars,fdk6m0u,t1_fdk58g8,1578497259.0,"You completely made that up. Let’s see, yesterday I saw 300 bikes run stop signs and 3 cars run stop signs.  So there you have it internet, the guy above can just make things up and you should believe everything he says. I don’t have to bait people into an argument and then make up whatever I have to to gaslight people into believing my lies. We all see the entitlement of bicyclists on a daily basis. Sure cars do run stop signs , but bicyclists run ALL stop signs. If I ever see a bicyclist stop at a stop sign I’ll send you the dash cam footage so you can use that instead of randomly making up numbers to prove your point."
gtaonline,fdk5pm1,t1_fdjvqdg,1578496664.0,"I’ve tested this so many times. On PS4 you 100% cannot kick a player if there are only 2 ppl in the lobby. You guys can insist all you want, but you’re wrong. It has a 0% occurrence rate over six years of playing. Not one single time has that ever happened to me and it has NEVER worked when I vote to kick someone from my solo lobby."
gtaonline,fdk58vl,t1_fdjpitv,1578496355.0,No it does not! That’s complete bullshit! It requires a third person to kick someone from a lobby.
IdiotsInCars,fdk4ra6,t1_fdk3itp,1578496026.0,"A bicycle ramming my car does nothing. A bicycle running a red light or stop sign and causing an accident is a regular occurrence. It’s not that a bike will harm my vehicle. It’s that, to this day, I have never seen a bicyclist follow the laws that they are required to follow, the same as cars. If I follow the laws and a bicyclist runs a stop sign, which they ALWAYS do, and I t bone him and kill him, I have to deal with that for the rest of my life. If there is truly a book that you can judge by it’s cover, it’s bicyclists. If you act like you’re above the law and you don’t have to follow the rules that everyone else has to follow, everyone’s gonna hate you. That’s why people hate bicyclists. It’s not that they can harm our vehicles, it’s that they are entitled assholes who REFUSE to follow the law and people hate that."

PublicFreakout,fcr8nxa,t1_fcp3uv8,1577898385.0,No it does not. I wish all you people would stop spreading this nonsense. Water does not make a spicy mouth worse. That is complete bullshit. Milk doesn’t work for shit either. Water is the best thing for a spicy mouth if you hold it in your mouth w/o swallowing. Once you swallow the pain comes back but it’s the only relief you’ll find. I eat extremely spicy chile as a regular part of my diet. Notice how every person with a lot of experience eating chile and peppers is saying the same thing.
PublicFreakout,fcr7nen,t1_fcohn69,1577897964.0,"I’ve tested this many times. Milk does not decrease the spiciness at all. Not even a little bit. Everybody try eating a jalapeño and drinking milk afterwards. You will be sorry. Also water does not make it worse. Filling your mouth with water and not swallowing is the only thing that helps, but once you swallow it’s comin back."

Who cares if they did the setups, all you did was sit on your ass and move your fingers. That’s not so much work that you deserve a bigger cut. That’s GREED!
