How is it possible that masturbation never comes up as a topic of conversation??? It’s May be embarrassing, but you have literally *created another human* with this person, there should be nothing off limits. 

I have greater concerns for your marriage than just this one incident. Do you discuss all your finances together, or do you not even know how much debt she is in?

Your communication is awful and needs to change."

It’s all about intent at the end of the day. MeToo was/is about people with the intent to abuse their power, especially over women. That might be rape, causal sexual assault or harassment, or anything similar. Let’s not gatekeep a movement, eh?"
Showerthoughts,fdnmaot,t1_fdngu3a,1578588763.0,"I don’t think the point of MeToo was that people who gave blowjobs made a lot of money.

The point of the movement was people who were sexually assaulted or raped and didn’t want it, and didn’t get any kind of benefit. If you were forced to give someone a blowjob just to keep your job, for example. Not voluntary stuff like choosing to butter up your boss by offering that stuff freely."
