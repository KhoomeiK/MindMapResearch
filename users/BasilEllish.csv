One time I had a coworker literally ask to have my baby. I mean, she was extremely attractive, a nice person, a young, tall, black woman who did some side-work modelling. But she was obsessed with having an Asian baby.

I thought she was joking at first but after a shift, she legit asked me to come talk to her outside in private to talk and she was almost begging me to make her an Asian baby. ""You don't even have to be a parent. We don't have to date, or get married, or anything! You're just so beautiful and I've always wanted an Asian baby! We can even be friends with benefits! Isn't that what guys want?"" She kept going on and on and on about how much she loves Asian babies and how they're the cutest and best etc. Going on about how she's beautiful and I'm beautiful, so we **should** make a beautiful baby.

At least I felt like I knew what I signed up for in the past - disregarding how naive I was to go for it - but nowadays its like everybody is beating around the bush and using buzz words in a long-winded effort to say the same kind of stuff I heard back in the day.

""You Asians are all so smart"" has turned into, ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've noticed that many people from Asian descent have certain characteristics and I was wondering what leads to that kind of mentality."" Meanwhile I'm like... ""Asians"" aren't one thing and we're just as diverse and varied as everyone else.

Sidenote: I sort of wish I had more physical traits that align with western beauty standards. I'm attractive but in a KPop-type of way. My tinder matches and likes are almost exclusively Koreaboos, weebs, and fobs. Finding someone IRL works better since they have more of an opportunity to get to know who I am.

unpopularopinion,ff77ugj,t1_ff75tfl,1579642833.0,"I'd much rather have my kids live fulfilling and well-rounded lives. Academics and education would still be a high priority, I don't want my kid picking a major for dying industry or something that has no career prospects. But let kids be kids. Encourage their hobbies and passions through positive reinforcement and discipline (without beatings). Gradually give them more and more responsibilities over time through teaching and mentoring. These are the kinds of methods that I believe are proven to produce individuals that are not only academically excellent but also well-rounded in other areas like music, sports, a healthy social life and the ability to make friends easily which comes in handy when you want to get that promotion or new job through networking or a boyfriend/girlfriend and have a healthy relationship etc. Expose them to how other people live lives through having a wide variety of experiences and friends.

&#x200B;

A well-rounded and happy child is what I consider success. And if I've done my job right, maybe they'll get into Harvard and I'll have done it without having powerful connections, tons of money, or by beating, and screwing up my kid.

&#x200B;

Edit: I got sidetracked from the original topic. Asians aren't ""superior"". There are reasons behind the high percentage of certain types of Asians in higher education. The biggest point that I haven't talked about much is that Asians and Asian-Americans are EXTREMELY DIVERSE and come in all shapes and sizes and beliefs and values and traditions etc. But the stereotype that ""All Asians are \_\_\_\_"" is actually hurtful, detrimental, ignorant, and untrue. This is why ""representation"" is so important for a lot of Asian-Americans. Media needs to showcase the dumb Asians, the creative artsy Asians, the musician Asians, CEO Asians, small business owner Asians, leader Asians, etc. Most non-Asian Americans all seem to have this belief that all Asians are monolithic and the same. During my short lifetime PC culture made it so ignorant statements are considered taboo to say but that just means that many people use fancy words or beat around the bush to basically say the same thing I heard in high school, ""You're Chinese aren't you? No? Japanese? No? Whatever, its all the same."" Texas isn't the same as California or Massachusetts or Illinois or Nebraska etc. even though we're part of the U.S. The U.S. isn't the same as Canada or Mexico even though we're American. People just don't care to even want to get to know the differences in Asian backgrounds (willfully ignorant) even if its visually obvious and also explained to them. Being an Asian-American in the U.S. is to have your identity and heritage stolen from you and your entire existence mocked or ignored."
unpopularopinion,ff75p0h,t1_ff72p60,1579641632.0,"Yes, and if you want your kid to go to a great school. Don't hug them. Never say sorry. Always guilt trip them. Hit your kids. Constantly pressure and berate them about their grades and schoolwork. Constantly be on the lookout to see if your kid has any romantic interests and if they do, sabotage the relationship. Any friends that you don't approve them? Sabotage. Ban any of your kid's friends from coming over. Always remind them of everything you sacrificed for them. Beat them some more. Guilt trip them more. Intrude in every faucet of their personal and social life until the only thing that gives them any peace of mind is to shut up and study.

They'll either hate you forever and turn into weird and disturbed individual, or get into an Ivy League school (highly unlikely), or both! Maybe you'll have chilled out as you age and your kids leave the nest but the damage is done and they may never forgive you as they struggle with love, friendships, and a lack of critical thinking or inwardly reflective skills. Or if you're a native Korean/Japanese parent, your kid might commit suicide from failing the entrance exams for higher education.

unpopularopinion,ff6ygkt,t1_ff65zdg,1579637478.0,"I think the point u/suckmysaltednutz is trying to make is that there is a lot of hard work behind those grades. To be told that you're inherently smart invalidates all that hard work. And all that hard work in achieving those academic goals come at a cost; you may be guided by family down career paths that you don't want, associate familial love as highly conditional and equate it to academic success, be expected to provide for your entire family when/if you've ""made it"", have little to no experience in love, relationships, and friends.

&#x200B;

Having poor immigrant parents who risked it all to come to U.S. to seek a better life for themselves, their kids, and all of their descendants is also a powerful incentive/motivator, often, at the expense of mental health, autonomy, and many other factors that contribute to a well-rounded individual. Education is a powerful tool to help people climb out of poverty and up classes, sometimes many immigrant parents take it too far.

&#x200B;

But not all Asians are smart or hardworking. And even if someone is book-smart doesn't mean they're necessarily the best critical thinkers or knowledgeable, especially if they've chosen a very specialized field.

&#x200B;

This isn't a matter of what race is ""superior"", its a matter of individuals and all sorts of factors like class, culture, traditions, origin stories, etc. that have shaped them. I think class and immigration are the bigger things to consider. **There are PLENTY of Asians that don't fit the model minority stereotype but they get ignored as it doesn't fit people's preconceived biases** (I'm very happy to see that kind of representation in media e.g. [Jason from the Good Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjyCstLOJQU). Its like showcasing a wider range of what an ""Asian"" person is allowed/expected to be). There is also a high percentage of Asians in higher education but I think that can be explained partially by what I wrote above."

Dating with the priority of ""reproduction"" seems backwards and creepy."
unpopularopinion,fefadtk,t3_eopsrb,1579051936.0,"I'm not sure what the moral of this story is but here goes:

I had a friend who was hellbent on getting absolutely hammered after a recent break up. We headed to a bar, me, her, and her roommate. What followed was one of my worst nights out ever. She's the completely irresponsible type but she has been going through an extremely rough time in her life for the past couple years with one terrible thing happening to her after another so I cut her a lot of slack for her stubborn behavior. She ""knew"" the bartender and he kept pouring her extremely large shots and giving her free drinks. I told her COUNTLESS times to slow down, drink water, eat something, have a beer instead of liquor. I bought her some appetizers that I ended up eating with her roommate because she kept refusing. The only thing that would work was when I'd trick her into ""sharing"" all that ""free whiskey"" with me but she was still drinking quite a lot.

What really freaked me out was the sheer number of predatory men coming out of the woodwork. They'd chat her up, tried to take my seat next to her, tried to buy her drinks, got handsy with her and one guy even told me to ""mind \[my\] own business"" and that I ""don't have a shot with her"". The drunker she got, the more men showed interest in her. From meek mid-life crisis older men to young stereotypical douchebags with sideways caps and more muscles than brain cells. My friend being... her usual self-destructive self would invite the interactions and chat up the guys and take their drinks while me and her roommate sneakily took the drinks from her and placed them elsewhere. I had to tell the bartender to stop serving my friend and though he gave me a nod, he gave her a few more when I wasn't looking and she gulped them down in a split second.

Eventually me and her roommate had to literally drag her out of the bar and call her an Uber. The scathing evil eyes that passerbys gave to me and her roommate could be felt down to my bone. It certainly wasn't a good look: 2 large buzzed men carrying around a tiny, limp, blackout-drunk girl talking nonsense. The Uber driver was extremely suspicious of us and we had a huge argument because he refused to drive us. Eventually he saw that we were trying to just help her get home and that this wasn't like other situations ""that have happened before"". We eventually got her home and monitored her all night and cleaned up her vomit and made sure she was sleeping on her side and tried to get her to drink water and eat anything. She doesn't remember what happened that night and I'm terrified to imagine what would've happened if she didn't have a couple people to look after her.

I'm no longer friends with her. Every time we hung out, I felt like her caretaker, babysitter, bodyguard, therapist, and dad rolled into one. It was fun at first to have a sassy drinking buddy to complain about life together with, but eventually it sank in that her irresponsible behavior isn't a result of alcohol but that she consistently and pointlessly makes poor life choices and creates drama on top of being exploited by others. I understand how when life spirals out of control its harder to think straight and make good choices, but I have my own life to tend to. Ultimately I walked away from that situation being disgusted by nearly everyone involved, mostly the predatory men and the bartender who should be fired, but also her belligerent, immaturity and death-wish mindset. It really opened my eyes to how disgustingly and shamelessly predatory some men can be - I had never seen so many men be so forceful and creepy, almost leading to a barfight between me and several men wouldn't leave her alone and who seemed gravitated towards her drunkenness - everything from hover-handing to touching her inner thigh (we usually drank at our regular bar where everybody knew each other and looked out for each other, but not that night). And also how bat-shit crazy, entitled, and irresponsible some women can be. I ended up ghosting her, I assume she probably talks about how I wanted to get with her and then lost interest or something when all I wanted was a new friend. I hope she's in a better place.

Meanwhile, I'm buying kimchi and sliced ham for the containers they come in and skipping meals to pay debt.

Most people can't afford kids these days. And every subsequent generation past boomers are footing the bill for their aging medical needs while most Americans contribute around half of their income to rent. Unemployment is low but most of the available jobs are in retail and food service and are hourly, not salaried, with no benefits, and benefits that are provided require you to pay an impossible sum just for basic care so you opt to slowly die instead.

&#x200B;

Yeah, I'm never having a baby. Older generations truly had it easy. They could work a retail job paying minimum wage and afford a house and a couple kids after a few years of hard work. These days, its a lifetime of debt and slowly dying from preventable things, while contemplating suicide over the mundane daily life of work, home, sleep, work, home sleep. All your friends are busy doing their own version of work, home sleep, work, home sleep and probably moved somewhere else so you're alone and in a miserable endless cycle and you wonder if you should just end it all.

Fuck having a baby, I want a nice steak and a future. But whatever, I can at least say I'm doing my part (not by choice) in reducing my carbon footprint by not having one. Why not go a step further and zero-emissions my own ass?

&#x200B;

I agree that anybody who chooses to have a child when they can't afford it is irresponsible. But also, the price of admission for a basic life is ridiculous in 2020. When you're well-off, people actually give you things - free headphones and towels to take home at your fancy gym and better rates on loans and blah blah blah. When you're poor, exploitative people and corporations prey on you and blame you for it. I for one, will not be having kids until I can afford to, so that's either never or possibly never.

&#x200B;

I guess my point is that personal responsibility is a wishy-washy concept that doesn't truly exist, like free will. If the system is broken, its difficult for human beings to behave as they naturally are inclined. Only people with the resources to buy more freedom have more free will. But free will ain't free."

&#x200B;

Try looking for information that doesn't align with your preconceived notions rather than falling into the echo-chamber trap of algorithms and preconceived notions. Again, I love both Bernie and Warren and I slightly favor Bernie. Some of the best stats/data-based policy wonks would agree they're VERY similar. In the very least, they'll both probably pick very similar appointees and have very similar administrations.

confidentlyincorrect,fe6q12c,t1_fe6lxr4,1578900058.0,"Uhh... they’re both extremely progressive democrats that both have their own ideas on how to redistribute wealth and fix healthcare and wage/wealth gap. They both have comparable plans to eliminate student debt and reduce foreign wars. They both have similar ideas on how to regulate and reform corporate greed/corruption and promote sustainable practices by holding manufacturers accountable for plastics production and carbon emission. They are extremely similar and have explicitly agreed with each other on many fronts.

As much as I love Bernie, stop your fanboying and choose the candidate that is most beneficial. In terms of Bernie and Warren, it’s a matter of nitpicking the means to which the end goal is met. They’re extremely similar with slightly different approaches as to how they’d tackle the same issues they both care about. 

Shut your ignorant face up and take a look at their actual policy positions and their plans on how to achieve them. They’re VERY similar and I’d be happy with either candidate winning the nomination. I favor Bernie because he is more electable with independents and trump-regretters. But Warren is an equally strong candidate with extremely similar beliefs and very similar means to achieve the goals they both agree on.

To say that Warren and Bernie are “nothing alike” is extremely ignorant - they’re both the top democratic progressive socialist contenders that corporations and conglomerates fear for a reason."
confidentlyincorrect,fe6iyrf,t1_fe6b39u,1578892399.0,"I voted for Hillary in 2016. I still believe she was the most qualified and experienced candidate in that line-up and likely to win. But, even in the short 4 years since then, times have changed so much, I think we need someone far more progressive to combat corporate greed and to redistribute wealth for the common American. I'm currently hoping for either Bernie or Warren to win. I think Warren is more studious and realistic whilst also extremely progressive - Leslie Knope type - but Bernie is equally nice. I hope both of them continue hammering corporate greed and corruption as their primary message, as it seems to be the most effective message across the political spectrum, and rightfully so. I thought Hillary would've been the type to use her political knowledge and expertise to bridge the gap between both aisles and work with people of all political beliefs to further a more progressive agenda whilst intelligently leveraging political capital and systems - regardless of how the public perceives it. But I think we need someone who throws political capital to the wind and enact common sense policies through brute force, though I still have reservations as to how realistic their policy propositions are with national conservative politicians demonizing ""socialism""."

During the past 2 years, I've had nothing but bad news and major hits to my financial, physical, and emotional health.

I have basically no friends (2, abroad), in a new city and I'm estranged from my family.

Today I got a job offer at a good company for a good position that's in line with my career goals and I've been crying tears of joy all day. This was the first bit of good news I've had in 2 years. Perhaps in a some time, I'll get a sandwich and find myself with extra eggs too.

unpopularopinion,fdpeodc,t3_ehe9e7,1578626691.0,"Nobody ever talks about issues facing Asian-Americans. Nobody seems to know a single thing about AAs. Its still overwhelmingly acceptable to make fun of them for being strange, and stereotypes aren't even close to being understood or broken. The overall conversation about race in America is always about other ethnic minority groups and even the most ""woke"" people are offensively ignorant when it comes to AAs.

I'm not trying to have a competition to see which ethnic group has it worse in America. But I'm reminded of Bill Burr when he was talking about nobody cares about men:

>[""I gotta tell you, I’m envious of women, okay? I’m not saying your problems get solved, but at least they’re taken seriously. You know? You got 1-800 numbers, you got ribbons, there’s groups. People give a shit. Anything happens to a guy, it’s just considered funny. Some woman cut her husband’s dick off, threw it in the garbage disposal, and turned it on. People thought it was hilarious! They were, “Ahhhh! Hey, stumpy!” Nobody cares.""](https://youtu.be/x0gaYyNk7QA)

In the quote above, just replace ""women"" with any other ethnic minority group, and ""guy"" with ""Asian-Americans"". That's how I feel. The things we're good for - according to how most Americans treat us - is to fetishize our culture and women, while emasculating the men because hardly anybody wants to date an Asian guy because of white ethnocentric beauty standards setting the baseline of people ""preferences"".

AA's also never seem to ever be considered for leadership positions in the professional world. We're always the sidekick, like [Short Round](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087469/characters/nm0702841?ref_=tt_cl_t3) or [the geek (men), or prostitute (woman)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/asian-american-actors-whitewashing-hollywood) and [god forbid we're ever portrayed as complex characters or even get to speak](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/01/80798/asian-actors-leading-roles-not-sidekicks), let alone have a romantic interest - I freaked out when Steven Yuen had a love interest and Crazy Rich Asians came out and I didn't even see them.

>In a recent study conducted by the University of Southern California, out of the 3,932 speaking characters evaluated from 600 popular films made between 2007 and 2013, only 4.4% were Asian. The same study found that Asian men were least likely to be depicted in a romantic relationship.

With that type of representation - and lack thereof - its no wonder that Asian men are more likely to find themselves in technical roles, but never in leadership or upper management roles.

Asian women live in completely different world to Asian men. They're valued higher, treated like royalty and fetishized and eroticized at the same time. [The number of white guys with Asian girlfriends is disturbing to me.](https://www.flare.com/sex-and-relationships/asian-men-stereotypes-dating-desexualization/) And the toxic Asian male mentality of obtaining a white woman is equally disgusting and far less discussed - with many Asian men saying things like, ""I'm going to dental school, so I can get a white girl"". The casual racism of [""Sorry, no Asians (men)"" in online dating is the norm](https://medium.meetm8.com/dating-as-an-asian-guy-sucks-but-heres-how-i-cracked-the-code-11ec375d47ea), but everybody wants to hook up and/or date an Asian women.

All my life I've been called smart and though I'm not particularly intelligent, I think I put a lot of time and energy into learning things in and out of school. The racist stereotype that all Asians are smart, completely takes away all the hard work and effort many Asians put into studying and learning. And also, not all Asians are smart. We all come with our individual and different experiences and knowledge. I know plenty of Asians who aren't ""smart"". And no, ""positive stereotypes"" aren't ""positive"". As a result, it feels like I need to work 10 times harder to get a fraction of the recognition and I'd better not work too hard or I'd just be another Asian whiz kid.

And why is it so damn hard for English speakers to get our names right? I changed my legal name to an English one but before then people in honest good faith would try to pronounce my name with a racist accent or add letters and syllables that aren't there. Even if you have an American name, like ""Andrew Yang"" people still fuck it up and call him ""Frank Yang"" when being introduced to the debate stage. [My name could be ""Hitoshi"" and people would say shit like ""High-Tosh-Shang"".. Its HE (like, ""he"" is an asshole) - TOE (like, I hope you stub your ""toe"") - SHE (like, ""she"" is ignorant); where the fuck did ""SHANG"" come from?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1RKkRCiU90) My Korean name is 1 syllable. ONE SYLLABLE. I've heard people try to pronounce my name with upwards of 3 syllables. Do ya'll have... racist ears or are we really that much of a joke to you?

Nobody gives a shit about Asians, especially Asian men. Being an Asian man in America feels like you're absolutely invisible and worthless. Asian men and women are considered objects and concepts to others, rather than human beings and most people prefer to keep it that way and never think beyond. Of course this doesn't sound like an unpopular opinion, who isn't against social inequity? But judging by the way everybody treats us, you'd think that the popular norm is that we're not human and we don't have issues."
