Eyebleach,fdse6lz,t3_emuy1k,1578700637.0,"The year was 2018. The place? Union falls trail, Yellowstone, Wyoming. Me and a group of friends(bout 12), overnight near the trailhead, hiking out to the falls in the morning, beautiful hike(waterfalls to go under, a hotspring you can legally swim into, beautiful). We enjoy ourselves and head back home. 
The trail was about 12 miles one way, up hill and down multiple ""hills"" both ways. On the way back, about 4 miles in, we run into a great pryenees( as I remember, regardless big,150lbish dog, tons of hair.) and the son(16yo possibly) of the dogs owner sitting on a log, or rock or something. The boy was talking into a walkie talkie of considerable size while the dog lays in the shade and pants real harsh like. 

Our group is waved down by this kid and he tells us his situation, something like this: his parents had started the hike earlier in the day, the son and the dog start an hour or two after the parents. The dog being of the long haired variety (he had tons of hair.) Was ill equiped for a relatively strenuous hike in the 75-80Â°F weather.

 This kid, not making it to the end of the 12 mile hike was about an 8 mile trek from his parents(who were even further into the hike and 4 from the trailhead with a severely over heated dog, in the bear/backcountry..by himself.

After a long night of drinking and a long day of hiking up and down hills for about 16 miles at this point (8 or so from campsite to trails end and 8 miles back to dog) we were all pretty beat and with a 3 hour drive home(we all worked in the park) this task seemed daunting. 

With a little finagling, we get this giant doggo on our pack hammock, 8 of us grab a side and we all carry this dog to a river 3 miles in and down hill to about 1 mile from the trail head and while the dog cools in the river, much like in this video, we bid the kid good luck and gtfo just as it started getting dark. We all Ford the river, get into our cars and drive back home. 

That turned into a super long story but it was fun actually thinking about that dog rescue op, courtesy of some hungover degenerates. Hopefully someone reads it.

TLDR; even bigger doggo gets cared out of sticky situation, in a pack hammock, cools in River like this pup, everyone is happy."
