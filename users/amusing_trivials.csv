You're also ignoring that a doctor is involved, and it would be their job to say 'No' to frivolous or harmful things.

You don't hear liberals scream 'dont cross the desert with your kids' because it solves nothing. Parents only ever do that if their other options are worse. The solution is not to make crossing the desert worse, but to give them an actually better option. 


Also, the 'cross the desert' portion of immigration is rather small. Most come in on a temp visa and just don't leave. No desert crossed. But when caught ICE still throws them in jail, splits the family, etc. So you're screaming about a tiny percentage of the issue as if it was the entire thing."
