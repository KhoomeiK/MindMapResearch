ntbdbiwdfta,ff8t2y7,t1_ff79f14,1579695043.0,Keep going. You are loved and I'm sending all the good juju and healing vibes to you. Your fur baby is lucky to have you.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff8t1gx,t1_ff6m8qd,1579694998.0,Thank you. I'm kinda partial since she is my baby but I think the same.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff8t0nd,t1_ff6zk39,1579694974.0,Yes it is. That and the little headbutts for head scratches.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff8szyb,t1_ff7wr41,1579694951.0,She really is. I can't imagine not having her.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff8sxps,t1_ff8svfg,1579694880.0,She has been chilling with me since I got up at 4. I'm reading and having some coffee and she is just snoozing away. We don't deserve pets.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff7oq1y,t1_ff7omkv,1579654647.0,"I exercise daily and have a very restricted diet of mainly chicken and veggies due to having the duodenal switch. Trust me if exercise fixed it, it would have already."
ntbdbiwdfta,ff7lt9i,t1_ff7loun,1579652614.0,She is definitely a chonky girl. Weighs in a 14 pounds and has adorable AF fat rolls on her belly.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff72tby,t1_ff722qc,1579639990.0,"Yeah until there is an actual study with a control group, I'm out on finding this factual."
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6xa56,t1_ff6nh8l,1579636785.0,Thank you. All of you guys have really helped me out today.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6x8y5,t1_ff6rhzh,1579636766.0,She will get lots of pets when I get home.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6x5fv,t1_ff6rhzh,1579636709.0,Thanks for the vibes! She will get all the pets and extra treats when I get home from work since she seems to be so loved on here.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6s3hm,t1_ff6532x,1579633719.0,Pretty sure doing crunches isn't going to help my depression. Croissants on the other hand.... that just might.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6hxrq,t1_ff6glgk,1579627578.0,We wouldn't have it any other way. She legit picked us. Was pawing to get out of the kennel and when she got out came over to me and laid in my lap and headbutted my husband for pets and scratches. It was like she waited just for us.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6d5rj,t1_ff60r89,1579624614.0,"Thanks for the well wishes. I tell Lucky (name of said kitteh) that she is gonna break her purr box lol.
Today is going loads better thanks to all of yall and to her and my hubbs."
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6d2zi,t1_ff60qqg,1579624566.0,She really is. Loves to snoozle and her treats.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6d2al,t1_ff641sg,1579624553.0,I'm at work today but it is going 100x better than the past few days.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6d16p,t1_ff62p4x,1579624533.0,They do for sure. She is one hell of a companion.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6d0db,t1_ff68708,1579624520.0,She offers leggie all the time! Thanks for the positive vibes!!!
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6cz74,t1_ff6aqz4,1579624500.0,Thank you for the support.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff6cy78,t1_ff649ie,1579624482.0,Awwah I'm sorry!!!

ntbdbiwdfta,ff6cw8k,t1_ff63iw1,1579624448.0,Her name is Lucky too! We adopted her as a senior (well she picked us).
ntbdbiwdfta,ff5xrla,t1_ff5xkqx,1579613726.0,Thank you! Today is better than it has been for a few days so I'm staying positive.
secretsanta,ff5wmpq,t1_ff5tzdd,1579612715.0,My question as well because that would be freaking AWESOME to be randomly given a kitty.
ntbdbiwdfta,ff5vgtw,t3_erjp9g,1579611636.0,Such a hambsome boi!
ntbdbiwdfta,ff5vfdx,t3_eror09,1579611597.0,Look at those little peets!!! NTBDBIQTDFTK
offmychest,ff5uhnc,t1_ff5udco,1579610684.0,"You are most welcome! I totally understand feeling uncomfortable. I work in a huge corporation and there are like 250 people on my floor, all of which I interact with quite a bit for different projects. They were all super supportive and I was terrified!!! You will be shocked with the support. It will renew your faith in humanity that everyone isn't a fucking dickwad.  Good luck and I hope it grows back exactly how you want it!"
rarepuppers,ff5uaaw,t3_err0ek,1579610478.0,"Such a hambsome,  h*ckin good boi"
offmychest,ff5u75e,t1_ff5u0a2,1579610390.0,"If you are nervous of comments like I was at first, a cute headscarf does wonders. Youtube has some amazing videos on different ways to tie them too
 If you want to do an ornately tied one, the longer the scarf the better. Once it starts to grow, IT WILL look like you put a penny in a light socket and cowlicks will emerge you never knew you had ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
Mousse (a very lightweight one) is great and also learning to spike it can be fun. I personally looked dumb AF with spiked hair (think Heimrich from A Bugs Life with Billie Joe Armstrongs hair from the American Idiot album lmfao) I just let it do its thing and prayed for the best."
Zoomies,ff5u0j5,t3_erpub4,1579610201.0,I needed this in my life this morning. Thank you.
offmychest,ff5tugb,t1_ff2sndc,1579610023.0,Yeah this happens to me too. A LOT.  But I love being bald.
offmychest,ff5ttfr,t3_erc0p0,1579609991.0,I shaved my head back at the end of August. Different reason (not illness) but my hair was not healthy at all. I just shaved it again last weekend because I honestly like it that much. Rock it!!!!
offmychest,fepyrdl,t3_eq7mmn,1579334854.0,Wow.... what an ass.... you need someone in your life to be there for you. I'm sorry for your loss OP and hope you find some comfort.
offmychest,fepylly,t3_eqbjpz,1579334740.0,My heart just melted some. I love this.
offmychest,fepyf0z,t1_fep06oh,1579334593.0,"As someone who grew up on the Iowa/Missouri border in the corn and soybean belt, I can attest that both are pretty awful ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†"
offmychest,f7lu1s7,t1_f1x672w,1573848097.0,"Thank you for your kind words. I'm sorry I never responded until now.
I'm almost 5 months out now and glad to report I'm much better and able to get in nutrients."
