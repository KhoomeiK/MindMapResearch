But its just my opinion, no one knows if he is electable until an actual election.  And he would be running against Trump.  I know lots of people will vote for literally any democrat over Trump.  

My understanding of his medicare for all proposal is that hospital ownership would remain unchanged.  Doctors offices would still be owned by doctors.  The big change is that instead of being on private insurance, everyone would be on medicare.  So hospitals (still privately owned), would only have one insurance company to deal with, Medicare.  This has huge efficiency bonuses for hospital administration.  It also gives the federal gov't the power to contain prices to reasonable levels.  Since all healthcare spending runs through medicare, medicare gets to set prices, and prevent hospitals from gouging.  It would also stop predatory drug companies from overcharging for medicine.

AdviceAnimals,fe489hf,t3_enqovt,1578856712.0,"So it's pretty complicated, let me break it down.

Your interest on your savings account is so low because the federal funds rate is so damn low.  Now why does the fed have it so low?  Because they crashed it to zero during the great recession and have had to keep it relatively low during the anemic recovery phase.  Also inflation is still super low, so they can't raise rates.

Now why is economic growth so poor, and inflation so low?

Because of stupid crazy high levels of income inequality.  The USA has an economy dependant on consumer spending... where consumers have barely enough money to pay for rent and food, and whole generations are being bogged down with unthinkable amounts of debt just to get through college.

But monetary policy can't fix income equality.  If anything it makes it worse.  Only fiscal policy (through congress) could fix income inequality.  Why doesn't congress do this?  Because the republican party exists.  They WANT high income inequality.  They want billionaires to get richer while everyone else struggles.

But what if we passed fiscal policy measures to help people at low and moderate income?  Higher minimum wage, overtime protection, enforecement of existing labor laws, paid family leave, universal health care, etc?

Well if we did, there would be a surge of wage inflation, resulting in price inflation and economic growth.  But, the fed with monetary policy could raise rates to keep that wage inflation in check.

The economy would rebalance with lower inequality, higher wages, and higher fed funds rate.  And your savings account with pay a higher amount.  But you would have higher mortgage interest rates too."

So Rey as a character is bland as a result of these mismatched directors pulling the trilogy in different directions.  It's a failure by the producers and executives at Disney who made these decisions.

TLDR:  Fire Kathleen Kennedy pls.
