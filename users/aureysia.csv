REU,fesmy8e,t1_feprbce,1579366944.0,"I did write a new essay for every school and research the professors and individually mention the ones I wanted and why I think they would be good for me and vice versa. I'll definitely put more time into the essays this year, though, and hopefully it will pay off! Thank you!"
REU,feo64hp,t3_elgzzm,1579295620.0,"My professors use the same letter for each school and just adjust it if needed. In the case that the REU asks them to fill out a form about me, the one prof told me that she can usually just copy-paste blurbs from her letter into the form. I used the same two professors for all my apps last year, and they said it wasn't a great deal of trouble."
REU,fenzqbg,t3_efdvry,1579293089.0,"There is no such thing, unfortunately. From what I've seen/heard/experienced, they're all pretty darn cutthroat, mostly due to scarcity of positions.

Edit: I did see, however, that UT Austin changed their REU to be freshmen only this year. I was bummed since that's my dream grad school and I can't apply, but hey, you'll probably be competing against less people if you try for that one!"
REU,fenz8yt,t3_epac8s,1579292993.0,"I mean, I've seen people in this sub with a healthy amount of experience get in. Schools say all of that, I think to get funding from NSF, but I don't know how much they actually follow through with it. It certainly doesn't hurt to apply."
college,fch7m6l,t3_eh33ph,1577648020.0,"One thing I'll say is that I'm pretty sure sociology/anthropology don't have more to offer in terms of job security, so if that's the only reason you're considering switching, then you're better off just sticking to what you love best.

I really hate all the STEM worship that goes on here because I feel like it misleads people. I work at a doggie daycare, and I still know a couple of people with STEM degrees who work there. Nothing is a guarantee. Maybe you should look into the careers you would be interested in and then pick a major based on that. You could find sociology really interesting but the careers for people in it less so. Working backwards might be a better way to make the choice."
college,fch4p8o,t3_eh8h0c,1577647296.0,"I always search for free online PDF copies, but when I can't get that, I rent. I strongly recommend renting over buying and reselling. Renting is always at least a little bit cheaper (and usually a lot cheaper) than buying a used copy, and you are never guaranteed that you'll be able to resell your book. Not only do you have to go through the work of getting a buyer, but I've known many people who got screwed over because the class switched to a different book the next semester. The money difference between buying/selling vs. renting isn't good enough to warrant the risk in my opinion.

And pro tip: for some books (especially ones that use online codes), it's actually cheapest to buy the online copy."
college,fbvw222,t1_fbvpye9,1577136913.0,"Not a problem! I know how hard this process can be, so best of luck to you!"
college,fbvl57t,t1_fbvi0qy,1577132389.0,"That's rough. Student experiences are the next best thing. Do your own research based off your values and create a list of schools to digitally tour. Read the experiences of the students, because that can be super helpful. My second ""nope"" school had plenty of students detailing how horrible it was online, which I only saw after my tour. I'd be cautious about just asking for direct recommendations because sometimes people on this site try to be too helpful for their own good, and you may get pushed towards schools that the endorser might only know through third-hand information. I know grape-vine recommendations were hurtful during my search, which is why I encourage you to be cautious."
college,fbvjsif,t3_eeh4bf,1577131820.0,"This hits close to home.

I didn't even have my first kiss until college, and my first relationship wasn't until second semester sophomore year. The truth is, when your ""firsts"" happen doesn't matter at all, and no one cares after they happen. I cannot stress this enough: a relationship should not be some sort of ultimate goal to happiness. A good one can be a great part of your life and can certainly augment happiness, but if your goal is to improve your life through acquiring one, you've got it wrong.

Get comfortable being you, on your own. If your life doesn't feel great and meaningful without a relationship, getting one won't solve it. As far as improving your solo life, clubs are awesome. Go to meetings. I know it's so damn scary to go to one on your own when you don't know anyone, but do it. I went on a club ski trip to Canada all alone, and I absolutely don't regret it. I called my mom crying about how alone I felt on night one, but by night 4 I had made friends and everything felt worth it. You'll find others, but you gotta branch out first. I know how hard that can be, but you have to force yourself to just go for everything and take risks, or you'll stagnate in your unhappiness."
college,fbvhn02,t3_eeovlo,1577130932.0,"All I have to say to you is tour your butt off.

I just randomly picked a bunch of backup schools online and applied and didn't actually bother touring until afterwards. One of my schools near the top of the list (not necessarily a backup because of how prestigious it was, so it's not like I was guaranteed entrance, but I didn't have a top pick like you, so it was one in the shuffle) was horrible. I hated the attitudes of the students I met on campus. Another pick I found online that looked like a perfect fit from what I read online was just not right for me at all. The school I picked wasn't one I considered at all prior to my mom forcing me to apply because my major was so small (like 10 kids each graduating class). A quick tour revealed that the program, despite being small, was super strong due to my discipline being an aspect of both of the school's heavy-hitter majors. But you don't find that kind of stuff online.

Do some research. Pick some things that seem nice, and tour every one you can."
college,fbvf5uw,t3_eemam0,1577129918.0,"I actually go to a school a little under an hour from home! It would definitely depend on your parents, but I might as well be 3h away with regards to how much independence I have. So, if your parents are normal in their attachment/control levels, I highly recommend the distance. I can go home on a whim for emergencies or when I want to see everybody, but I still am as on my own as anyone else.

That being said, if your parents are a little more controlling and the type to force you to come home every weekend or show up unannounced, more distance will be necessary because that distance is way too convenient."
REU,fbb5sek,t3_e9q0bn,1576693907.0,"My professor who had done an REU herself 10ish years ago acted as my mentor for the process last year, and she said that I should ask only professors in my major (which was also the type of REU I was applying to). She ended up recommending that I ask a professor who I had spent less time with but who was more relevant to my REUs over another prof who saw me more. I'd assume her advice would apply here as well."
