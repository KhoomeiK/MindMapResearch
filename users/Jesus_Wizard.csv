Cocaine does something similar: [However, cocaine prevents dopamine from being recycled, causing large amounts to build up in the space between two nerve cells, stopping their normal communication.](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine)

AUD is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over alcohol intake, and a negative emotional state when not using.](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-use-disorders) Alcohol is different in that the abuse is characterized as a disorder or psychological dependency as alcohol isn’t inherently addictive like some other substances listed above. However it’s uses and effects can result in a dependency I.E. coping in social situations, numbing emotional/physical pain, relieving anxiety, etc. This results in people developing habits, dependencies, and even addictions due to the widespread availability of the substance.

AskReddit,ff7uq0i,t1_ff70ptn,1579658819.0,"Addiction is a weird thing because it can be either psychological or physical but generally they work the exact same way with the same symptoms and problems they create. For example: coffee is chemically addictive because if the caffeine within it. You become physically dependent on it for your energy and daily function. Alcohol is psychologically addictive because it isn’t inherently addictive but people become dependent on it as a solution to some sort of dilemma. The drinks are very different from one another but the end result is the same.

Edit: something to consider is that chemically addictive substances are far easier to develop a dependency on. This includes substances such as sugar, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, and a bunch of others."

unpopularopinion,fdgdj19,t3_el2zao,1578391618.0,"See I understand where you’re coming from until the aspect of irritation for the celebration of African culture. 

I think the admiration, celebration, practice and appreciation of all cultures should be seriously supported, despite the race, nationality, or country of origin of the individual practicing. I think that culture is a wonderful thing and secluding and hiding it only creates the problem of alienation even further. 

Using culture as a medium for capitalistic gain as done often in many first world countries can be disrespectful, especially when the accuracy of the cultures practices are manipulated or changed to be more marketable.

However I generally don’t agree with the overall public view regarding cultural appropriation. The longer we uphold divisive views, the longer we alienate ourselves from one another. So come on inside and let me tell you about my culture, and I’ll hope you’ll share yours with me :)"
