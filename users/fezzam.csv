Sorry my formatting is so bad I’m on mobile.


So I am a very suburban white kid no problems whatever but I have a cheap old car I was giving a coworker a ride home and it was to “the bad neighborhood” but it was about 1:30 in the morning we got off at 1. 

Anyways I have no idea where I am and I’m just taking turn by turn directions. I don’t know why I was actually pulled over there was no old tags or mechanical problems.  

But just the same I pull over quickly,  the cop asks me what I’m doing here. I’m just giving a ride home from work.
I’m asked to get out of the car. I’m like okay what’s the problem?


Second cop shows up, me and my passenger get separated. Then the first cop directly asks me if I think he’s stupid. Says I know your out here pimping her out. 

I start laughing like what no we just got off work and im giving a ride home?  I forget everything that was said but eventually they say fine get out of here you’re too white to be hanging out round here. I had to ask how to get back to the highway...  not my fault I don’t know my way around the area I don’t go..."
