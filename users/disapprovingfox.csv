WhitePeopleTwitter,feo9y0f,t1_fenoorb,1579297182.0,We were the cool kids when my dad brought home a pong console game for the TV.  Options of large or small paddle.

Antiques,fecfpvy,t3_eobeou,1578972821.0,I'm jealous. ðŸ˜Š
MadeMeSmile,febi17x,t1_feawj48,1578959024.0,Thanks. I just remember how much it stung when my dad didn't appreciate our efforts. He had his own issues. Now that I'm older I understand. It was an easy thing to do different.
knitting,feax1n9,t1_fe9zzgm,1578953077.0,So this is what heaven looks like.
MadeMeSmile,feaw7qm,t1_feag66j,1578952811.0,"Because my dad never displayed anything I made, when I became a mom I hung my son's art with pride. Framed the pieces I really liked. We even have a display shelf for his LEGO builds. 

He is now in his 20s at uni, had some old friends over at xmas break and overheard one say. ""OMG your parents let you decorate their house, they must really love you"". I have never been so pleased."
FormerPizzaHuts,fdzy13i,t1_fdzwe0e,1578798584.0,Actually haven't been. ðŸ™„
FormerPizzaHuts,fdxzlz2,t1_fdxl656,1578774542.0,After the Pizza Hut closed it was two different Mexican restaurants. The pull to its original purpose was too great.
1917,fdwxqan,t3_emzj6c,1578763267.0,"I thought the hand in the body was a nice bit of acting. Will pops over the side and starts to take care of his hand, glances at the body all ""meh"" like just another day at the office. But his reaction when he is bumped and his hand goes in the body. Brilliant acting and facial expressions. Nicely showed that people can become desensitized by horror, but never immune."
whatisthisthing,fdtjho5,t1_fdtho3v,1578717652.0,"If the packaging is only in English it is older than 1969, when bilingualism became law and all packaging in Canada was supposed to be in French and English. Not the answer but you get an idea of its minimum age."
mildlyinfuriating,fdj0nne,t3_elhipm,1578455444.0,How else do you have random pieces to leave in an obscure pocket just before it goes in the wash.
quilting,fdj0ga9,t3_eliz1k,1578455300.0,My first quilt was the similar Around the World basic squares. But learned a lot. It is still going strong after 30+ years.
KnitHacker,fdfug7z,t3_el0brh,1578370512.0,Must master crochet. I desperately need a budgie.
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fdd1ewe,t3_ekmoku,1578290975.0,That is a very beautiful cat.
Antiques,fdailis,t1_fd6u8nd,1578246516.0,"Thank you.   Right now only the cat sits on it, as I use the top for sweaters I haven't put away. But will remember not to put near heat, and discourage sitting. 

I love that it has my great grandfather's initials HB. And wonder if he had other luggage when he immigrated. It doesn't hold much to move your entire life."
Antiques,fd6b49n,t1_fd69eet,1578188274.0,"Thank you. And very sturdy, works as a bench also."

whatisthisthing,fcsvwio,t1_fcrntdv,1577926453.0,Possibly to divide the lane to keep people to the one side to avoid bumping into others.
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fcpgwm8,t3_eiba66,1577863509.0,Temperature control arms.
whatisthisthing,fcp696y,t1_fcp3yp7,1577851839.0,Antique body warmer. I've seen them called hunting tummy warmers. Bed warmers generally had long handles on them to allow them to be shoved under the covers without undoing the sheets.
whatisthisthing,fcp52dc,t3_eidi79,1577850712.0,"Tactile paving, textured ground indicators to assist pedestrians that are visually impaired. Started in Japan at pedestrian crossings."
secretsanta,fcp4v80,t1_fcp19ef,1577850531.0,It is like a gentle hug all night long.
secretsanta,fcoy6yn,t1_fconaoa,1577844854.0,"Mine is YnM from amazon. Although it is the only one I tried but am happy with it. The fill doesn't ""puddle"" so weight stays spread out. Even put it through the wash, after an unfortunate cat incident, and no noticeable change."
secretsanta,fcojbvq,t1_fcnzcn2,1577833655.0,I highly recommend a weighted blanket. Dang I sleep well.
britishproblems,fcktzuw,t3_ehk5uf,1577733154.0,Showed up at emerg after my at home migraine meds didn't help with the pain. Weekday evening. My son dropped me off. I wore my hoodie up  and sunglasses. I fully expected to cringe in the waiting area for a few hours. Was shocked when they put me through to a doctor. And decided that the people I passed in the waiting room could probably all go home if my migraine was the most serious thing they had going.
Antiques,fcjd4oo,t3_ehea11,1577683525.0,"My sister has a similar one she got from Syria years ago. The desifn motifs that aren't flowers, look like stylized Arabic lettering. There is a tradition of decorative art using letters in the Arabic world."
Brochet,fc7epcf,t1_fc7cpsf,1577505202.0,"Squared off the corners over the sides. And ties on the corners underneath, tied around the legs and tucked in under the edge."
knitting,fc5bv12,t1_fc5ads9,1577452599.0,Lol. I hate moss stitch so much the trauma blocks me from even being able to see it.
cats,fc4jpv3,t3_eg2b47,1577418659.0,Don't show my cat he'll want one too.
knitting,fc49rma,t1_fc470ks,1577410491.0, He was blanket worthy. There is a lot of stocking stitch. Months of work probably.
knitting,fbyme53,t1_fbym0i1,1577220607.0,"Responsible yarn buying, is that waiting until you have selected enough to get the free shipping?
Or stocking up when it is on sale?"
