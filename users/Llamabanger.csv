servant,fepsfeb,t3_eq5g4r,1579329692.0,"I think that they’re probably in a residential neighborhood that’s on the edge of the inner city/busiest part. I live in a quieter neighborhood that’s on the edge of my city and I’ve had people say similar things to me, like “oh wow your house is so close to the city!” Technically I’m very much inside the city, I’m literally a mile away from where my friends consider “the city” but my neighborhood is more residential whereas they still rent apartments in really busy areas that are full of bars and shops."
insanepeoplefacebook,fenjns3,t1_feng9v2,1579286126.0,I agree but he’s claiming he was interrupted every few seconds and I’m just not convinced
politics,fenf2j4,t3_eq019a,1579283310.0,The other 17% are the fake black conservative twitter accounts being ran by middle aged white men.
PublicFreakout,fem88sx,t1_felqkms,1579243334.0,"But he was right...the police had no right to search his pockets, as cited multiple times in this thread. If police detained you, deserving or not, and they violated your rights, would you just ignore it?"
PublicFreakout,fem84pm,t1_felq15w,1579243209.0,He was filming an acted out video with a handgun that he had a permit for. What was he doing that was shitty?
PublicFreakout,fem7wky,t1_felun2o,1579242962.0,"I mean...he did look suspicious because he was handling a firearm. He produced his permit and both parties let them know what was going on, that should have been the end of it."
PublicFreakout,fem7pxz,t1_fek9llh,1579242768.0,"I thought it was interesting too that according to an article posted here, the men were detained because the officers observed one man putting a gun to the other’s head while filming a music video. They were questioned and the man with the firearm had a permit and was doing nothing wrong and they still treated them like this. Just goes to show you can do everything right and still be treated like absolute shit."

vegan,fe5ybe3,t1_fe5w4gb,1578877654.0,"7-Eleven has them, but only certain locations! My boyfriend drives a lot for work and he says that he’ll stop at different gas stations every day until he finds one that sells these hahahaha"
vegan,fe5t43f,t1_fe5su6j,1578874351.0,"tbh I found this while trying to figure out what stores near me sell these because I needed to get my fix. 

have you tried them yet??"
vegan,fdxofnt,t3_em4kfp,1578771248.0,"I just signed up near me but haven’t gotten my first box yet. I can fully customize my box, and even with shipping the pricing is cheaper than stores around me plus it saves a trip! I love that they have options for grains and things now too."
MurderedByWords,fdk3txh,t1_fdk337l,1578495389.0,"A lot of parents like having their kids around as young adults if their kids aren't anti-social neckbeards. 

They're already paying for the house to live in, having another person live there only adds so much to what they're paying. OP never said she doesn't contribute by helping cook, clean, etc. You're just assuming because you hate women and you're probably projecting the dislike that you know your parents feel for you."

AmItheAsshole,fcvcbpa,t1_fcuxri3,1577999114.0,"Who goes into someone else’s house and starts rifling through their canned good and frozen foods? Lol. If auntie wasn’t willing to let OP make her own food and would make anything or adjust any recipes because it was too stressful, do you really think she would let OP dig into her pantry during a party?

I’m vegan and visited my southern granny for the week of thanksgiving, she literally did not cook a single dish that didn’t include an animal product but it was fine because I was allowed to bring pre-prepared food and because my grandma was thrilled to let me take over some of the holiday cooking. A lot of the recipes were really easily made vegan by just using vegan butter and plant milk, and my family members couldn’t tell the the difference. I brought my own ingredients though, I certainly wasn’t going to just expect access to all of my grandma’s vegetables."
AmItheAsshole,fcv9pz1,t1_fcubih3,1577997578.0,"She’s not asking for anyone to cater to her, her aunt shut down totally reasonable suggestions and wouldn’t even allow OP to bring pre-prepared store bought food. The aunt is allowed to do that, and OP is allowed to politely decide to stay home and not go to a party where everyone but her will be eating."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fculg23,t3_eipr9i,1577983589.0,"Choking out a “lady”, my ass. This is definitely a group of high school kids and they are definitely choking a kid."
TheRightCantMeme,fctg3e5,t1_fctejgr,1577942144.0,"Because you’re ignorantly promoting a party with corrupt ideals, policies, and leaders that are ruining lives. The only point that you got across is that you’re willing to argue for things that you don’t understand and that’s foolish and harmful."
TheRightCantMeme,fcs3tn1,t1_fcr0zy9,1577911062.0,Your inability to distinguish between “parody” and “parity” really makes me doubt that you’re a particularly credible or knowledgeable source when it comes to politics. Great example of the link between conservatism and low intelligence lol. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611421206
creepyPMs,fcneer7,t1_fcmt21i,1577809993.0,Eventually I ended up changing my settings so that I can’t receive PMs. This happened at like 2 am and it scared the shit out of me.
creepyPMs,fc62n1x,t3_eg8760,1577470878.0,Update: he made three different accounts to harass me with after I blocked the first one. People suck. https://imgur.com/a/loVMemr

I’m so impressed that you’re a math tutor!! I hope that your friends and family tell you that they’re proud of you, if they don’t - I’m proud of you!!"
college,fc2wwey,t1_fc2sz4q,1577376196.0,"Your history is almost exactly the same as mine, even down to the grade that your parents stopped teaching you math! I’m trying to get up to speed to take calc I next year, you’ve given me hope!"
news,fbgt7tk,t1_fbgjumm,1576858037.0,"Even if you legally exist, homeschooling allows parents to totally isolate their children and it often goes unrecognized because no one interacts with the children enough to raise suspicion. My parents were incredibly negligent to me and I was incredibly hopeless and suicidal until I moved out, because it felt like I had no options since I had about a fifth grade education, no emotional support or guidance, and no resources to get away.
