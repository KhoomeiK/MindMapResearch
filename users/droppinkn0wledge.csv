It took me 15 years to start questioning the religion I was raised in, another 10 to comfortably tell myself I didn’t believe it, another 8 after that to tell my family I didn’t believe it. 

Being raised in that kind of dogma is the most powerful form of collective gaslighting on the planet. It completely breaks your psyche and worldview, and you’re left an emotional and interpersonal infant afterward. 

So you’re right; obviously there’s a distinction. But people who are being raised in that shit and forced to unpack their entire identity as adults and start over are absolutely to be pitied, not reviled. 

If they’re not willing to change, then sure, hate them all you want, I guess."

I hope your son does have a shot at Juilliard. It's an incredibly exclusive school. In 18/19 alone, my studio sent four seniors to Chapman, UofA, SUNY Purchase, and Juilliard. All girls, all competition dancers throughout their training here. In 2010, one of our boys went on to become a finalist on that season of So You Think You Can Dance? Once again, competition dancer. Eight out of every ten professional concert/commercial dancers have some kind of experience on the competition circuit. Moreover, former competitive dancers often become contracted teachers/judges for those same competitions. 

This has nothing to do with ""Dance Moms on Lifetime."" I have no idea what you're talking about there. You seem to have a very skewed opinion of the competition dance circuit based on YOUR viewing of reality TV. As an administrator at a private dance school, I can tell you for certain there are many, many issues in competition dance, especially the lower tier circuits (you named a couple in Hollywood Vibe and Starbound). Moreover, competition dancers who focus solely on competition dance rarely succeed in the professional dance world, because they develop bad habits and a warped idea of ""good"" dance. The competition circuit is hugely flawed. I'm not arguing that point.

Again, the competition circuit is not the ONLY avenue to success, but it is without a doubt the most widely utilized and reliable network in beginning to carve out a professional dance career."

pics,ff9smy1,t1_ff9q6i5,1579720363.0,"Firstly, boys are in a very unique, privileged situation in dance. The demand for boy dancers (especially in ballet) always vastly outweighs the supply. So boy dancers will garner attention where girls may not.

Secondly, ballet is unique among the disciplines. There really is no ballet-centric competition circuit. Competition ballet numbers do exist, though they typically do not do well.

Thirdly, ballet is one of the only disciplines (perhaps THE only discipline) that can be exclusive in regards to carving out a professional career. HOWEVER, you're limiting yourself to only ballet, which comes with its own drawbacks. Most dancers with professional aspirations are much more versatile than strict ballerinas, because that versatility obviously opens up many more professional opportunities in concert and commercial dance.

Lastly, I'm not sure what you mean by ""real directors."" There are real directors at private studios all over the country that are training successful, professional dancers in the competition circuit. Most serious private dance schools have teams in the competition circuit. It's just the way the industry is right now. It is absolutely the best way to get your name known among top level choreographers and teachers, all of whom have connections at Juilliard, Ailey, Point Park, etc. 

HOWEVER, pure competition dancers (who are only trying to win) are typically flawed dancers with a flawed mentality. That much is definitely true."

Senior elementary/junior high girls who are getting into competitive dance teams can spend upwards of a few grand a year on local competitions, tuition, etc. 

High school age serious dancers who want to dance professionally are almost surely neck deep in competitions/conventions, and paying upward of $10,000 a year.

There's really no apparatus in public school systems for high quality dance programs. Serious dancers are getting their dance education from a private studio, which obviously costs money. The competition/convention scene is the real racket, as well as private choreographers who are being paid $1000+ to set competitive solos.

People act like Wayne’s era was a joke, and that’s a huge recency bias from mostly young fans who never saw Wayne play. Yes, the overall talent level was way down compared to today. Absolutely. But that doesn’t mean Gretzky isn’t still the best player to ever lace up a pair of skates. 

Gretzky’s 85/86 season saw him win the Art Ross by 70 points. That second place scorer? Mario Lemieux. 

People need to stop diminishing the absurd statistical dominance of players like Gretzky and Lemieux just because they played in an older era. A 40 year old Lemieux was basically a point per game (22pts in 26 games played) in 05/06, the first year of what many consider the “new modern era” of the NHL. Just imagine a 25 year old Gretzky or Lemieux in 2020, especially with how much the game has softened up. They would be McDavid tier if not higher."

The Uldah coup is a perfect disaster. It sets up the next expansion with significant resistance to our main characters. There is a lot of unknown moving into the future, which raises tension and excitement.

You can't go wrong with Dragoon. It has a much simpler rotation than something like Ninja. At endgame, Dragoon can be a little challenging in regards to properly timing your raid buffs, but you can screw that up and it's not super punishing.

Kavanaugh's reaction is irrelevant. How a Justice reacts or doesn't react to salacious, uncorroborated personal allegations has no bearing whatsoever on how they will or will not react to hotly contested court proceedings. If you walked up to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and punched her the face, she would likely react with shock and anger. Using that highly specific reaction under extraordinary circumstances is utterly useless in making any definitive judgement about someone's overall character. It takes five seconds of unbiased, unpartisan critical thinking to understand this. Kavanaugh's ""temperament"" during that kangaroo court is the most pathetic red herring goalpost shift I've ever heard.

Not a single witness to the alleged event corroborated Ford's story. That should have been the end of it. If Kavanaugh didn't react with anger, he would have been labeled ""elusive, cold, uncaring, and emotionally unfit for the Supreme Court.""

ffxiv,fdoxyvr,t1_fdotn43,1578615434.0,"Not hard at all, unless you're referring specifically to the 8-man Bahamut Raids. For some reason, these 8-mans are not included in the Normal Raid Roulette. That means players will have to queue up specifically for these raids. I would not recommend this, as you'll be waiting hours upon hours for the queue to pop (if it ever pops at all). 

As others have recommended, I would suggest asking a high level friend or two to clear the Bahamut raids with you. One to two level 80 players can speed clear all the Bahamut raids with relative ease as long as they unsynch their character level/item level. You'll simply tag along.

Again, I'm not sure why the Bahamut raids are not included in the Normal Raid Roulette, which would otherwise reduce queue times for Bahamut. I'm sure there's a reason, but I don't know it off the top of my head.

As for the Crystal Tower alliance raids, these are included in the Alliance Raid Roulette. So your Duty Finder will be drawing on this vast pool of players, which significantly reduces queue time. Broadly speaking, if you specifically queue up for a Crystal Tower alliance raid, and 23 other players are queued for the Alliance Raid Roulette, the system will prioritize your individual queue, match you with the other 23 players, and you'll all do Crystal Tower.

Item levels and character levels are always synced with content in the Duty Finder (unless you manually change that setting, which you shouldn't except under very specific circumstances, like speed clearing Bahamut with a couple buddies). 

Item and character level sync functions exactly as it sounds: if my level 80 Black Mage enters a level 25 dungeon via the duty finder, my item level and character level will drop to level 25. I won't be able to use action skills learned past level 25, and all of my stats drop to a level 25 range due to the item level cap.

Regardless of this level sync, most pre-60 content is pretty simple, anyway, and experienced players will likely know the most efficient way to run the content. If you're feeling insecure, just let everyone know in party chat that this is your first time in a dungeon/raid/whatever, so they'll understand if you lag behind a bit. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this if you're queued up as a tank or healer. It just sets expectations for the party accordingly.

ffxiv,fdote3y,t1_fdorj40,1578612449.0,"Not sure if you can re-do them, but you can re-watch all the cutscenes by interacting with the ""Unending Journey"" item in any inn room.

As long as you have actually cleared the questline, you can re-watch them at any time. If you haven't beat Shadowbringers MSQ yet, I would watch the old Crystal Tower cutscenes beginning to end before continuing.

I had a buddy who carried me through the Bahamut quests a while back, and to save time I had to skip all the cutscenes. So I just went to an inn room, accessed Unending Journey, and played them all back at my own leisure.

The developers understand the social demands inherent in systems like Duty Finder. Anyone who has cleared these raids/dungeons/trials will obviously auto-skip the cutscenes. And most players (including me) skipped them, as well, knowing that the rest of the party is sitting there waiting for me. So the Unending Journey is a perfect addition to still experience the story.

New players NOT skipping cutscenes was a huge problem back in ARR, particularly in the two Main Scenario duties at the end of the base ARR MSQ. New players were watching these (very long) cutscenes, and sometimes being kicked by the rest of the party who didn't want to wait for them. That's why the Main Scenario Roulette now exists, and does not allow cutscene skipping for those two specific duties."

ffxiv,fdokwd6,t1_fdnna1t,1578607208.0,"I would strongly encourage you to complete ALL of the available Alliance Raids and their corresponding questlines. There are currently ten 24-man Alliance Raids:

- Three level 50 alliance raids (the Crystal Tower raids)
- Three level 60 alliance raids (the Heavensward raids)
- Three level 70 alliance raids (the Stormblood raids)
- One level 80 alliance raid (the Nier raid)

By the end of this current expansion cycle, there will be another two level 80 Nier raids. I'm sure you can see a pattern here.

The Crystal Tower questline *directly* ties into the events of Shadowbringers MSQ. I would strongly encourage you to complete the entire Crystal Tower questline before you get to Shadowbringers.

I would also suggest you complete the entire Alexander raid questline (a series of level 60 8-man raids in Heavensward). While not as directly linked to the Shadowbringers story as the Crystal Tower, the Alexander story provides some important peripheral worldbuilding knowledge. Moreover, completing at least two 8-man Alexander raids will unlock the Normal Raid Duty Roulette.

Stick to prioritizing unlocking roulette content. Daily roulettes provide a huge amount of exp and gil and tombstones (end game currency). I consider the following roulettes core daily roulettes in leveling:

- 50/60/70 Roulette (dungeons unlocked at level 50, level 60, and level 70)
- Leveling Roulette (pulls from a huge list of dungeons, ranging from level 14 and up)
- Main Storyline Roulette (pulls from only two ARR endgame story dungeons, cutscenes are non-skippable, but this roulette provides a boatload of exp)
- Trial Roulette (pulls from a huge list of 8-man boss trials)
- Alliance Raid Roulette (pulls from the ten 24-man alliance raids covered above)
- Normal Raid Roulette (pulls from all 8-man raids from Alexander forward)

There is an absolute fuckton of content. I still havent unlocked everything, and I've been playing for awhile now. 

The toughest part about getting into FF14 is exactly what you just described: there is just so much content, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed.

I wouldn't worry about doing ANY side content at all until you're at least level 50. Power through the MSQ and make sure to do all of your corresponding job quests. Don't screw around with a ton of different jobs early on. Don't agonize about gear choices. Pick a job you like, stick with it, and get through the MSQ.

*There is never a ""point of no return"" in FF14. You will never accidentally lock yourself out of important content. So there is no point in stressing about unlocking everything. You will have plenty of time to do that once you get through the entire MSQ and reach level cap with at least one job.*"
