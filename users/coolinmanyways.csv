SkincareAddiction,fel8w0w,t1_fel8srj,1579216605.0,that’s so true tysm
depression,fel88os,t1_fel3rvj,1579216189.0,"i live in nyc and yes it was just sleeting. it’s honestly not occasional wonky weather anymore, this is a real problem progressively getting worse and you can’t deny it. but you’re right, we’ve experienced lots of weird weather in the past too lolol"
SkincareAddiction,fel1erv,t1_fel18fu,1579211973.0,"okay, thank you so much! i will invest in a bentonite clay mask."
depression,fekzhev,t3_cml6ni,1579210829.0,ever since i’ve started using and being active on reddit i’ve only been ridiculed when i try to help people. thanks for making me feel more worthless
depression,fekz8ui,t1_fekyo0f,1579210686.0,i’m sorry. i meant to say where i live it was around 21°C when it should be around -6 to -4°C
depression,fekt7bn,t1_fekrxkb,1579207099.0,"you’re absolutely right. in many cases they do end up having great lives, and social skills are definitely good to have. but they’re not all you need. it’s okay to be alone. it’s just a matter if you accept the fact that you’re alone or not. if you’re fine with it, that’s great. if you’re not, either accept it and find the beauty of being alone, or, put yourself out there, get involved, be yourself, and see if you have any luck at making friends."
depression,fekqqa9,t3_epmseq,1579205648.0,"this is what i’d do; i would save up for as long as i need and move to the nearest city. then apply for as many jobs as you can until you get hired. there’s much more opportunities in cities than rural areas. just a suggestion— if that sounds good to you, pursue it. i just wanna remind you that you’re so strong for still pushing through all these hardships. as for those women, don’t worry about them, they won’t get far in life doing stupid shit like leading people on. set goals, and work for them... best of luck ❤️"
depression,feknnsf,t3_epmgz5,1579203823.0,"it really sucks. i live in new york and this past week we’ve had multiple days where it was OVER 70°F, which is so ridiculous because it’s usually supposed to be around 20-40°F this time of year. your efforts do count though. if more people weren’t ignorant about climate change like you, i think we could make a difference."
depression,fekett2,t3_epl6wp,1579198559.0,"i know EXACTLY how you feel. i have no friends in school too, and it sucks because, we over evaluate every single thing we do because we don’t wanna be judged,since we’re already judged for being quiet 

but... it will be over. make your main priority education. it can be hard since everyone, especially the popular people in high school are partying and enjoying themselves, but their peak is in high school. if you focus on education now, you’ll have a much better future. then, you can truly reap the benefits of all the hard work and struggles you had to put up with in school

i hope i made sense lolol,, anyways i wish you well! good luck ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
SkincareAddiction,fek21ut,t1_fehcy8m,1579190939.0,there’s been some studies on it and even if it’s untrue i try to stay on the safe side lol
SkincareAddiction,feh69mw,t3_ep18hl,1579110023.0,i wouldn’t use hadalabo since it has parabens
