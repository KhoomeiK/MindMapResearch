doctorwho,fezqdax,t3_eqvl8x,1579460328.0,"Reminds me of a presentation I did on Banksy for a school project. Wore a navy hoodie and a cap with the English flag on it, and when I was giving a brief description on how Banksy looked (“fairly average, scruffy looking fellow with a baseball cap and hoodie”) I stopped to hurl off the baseball cap. Look a bit tomboyish myself so the joke worked well haha"
u_estela-online,fedt8vq,t3_ekda5a,1579019400.0,Sounds like an MLM to me my dude
antiMLM,fecp3js,t1_feco5hi,1578979646.0,Thank you Kendra very cool
antiMLM,fecp1xk,t1_fecodrd,1578979608.0,"Thank you! I like it too. Sometimes she even has peanut M&M’s (my favourite!) to snack on and it’s overall a very relaxing atmosphere. And thank you for the advice as well! 

I do like the smell of oils unless it’s a particularly strong one, and I don’t believe that the school has any problem in regards to health concerns and diffusers—especially considering she wouldn’t have it otherwise. 

So with that said, in the end my main goal would be to encourage buying another brand of essential oils. As I mentioned in another comment: I think she would be interested in knowing Young Living isn’t exactly ethical."
antiMLM,fecoge9,t1_feco3c0,1578979111.0,"I guess? But at the same time, I feel like she would want to know that it isn’t exactly ethical. I dunno. Good point though."

FireEmblemHeroes,fdk9zsx,t3_eltzpa,1578499425.0,Should add that I also posted this on the [Fire Emblem Amino](http://aminoapps.com/p/rr0nck) back in September—meaning that this isn’t necessarily new by any means. Just wanted to say this so that people wouldn’t call me out for (somehow) stealing my own artwork.

In all seriousness though, I love that scene. Man’s so proper and composed 99% of the time, and ~that’s~ the moment he snaps? Speaks volumes about where his loyalty lies. ...Plus the little shit deserved it, so. Y’know."
