Though we believe lots of things about him, there's so little we actually *know*.

First, antibiotics don't kill viruses (those are not really alive to begin with), they kill bacteria. Which causes a selection effect as you said.

There are antiviral drugs, but those work only against specific viruses and are completely useless against the vast majority.

Second, vaccines don't kill anything. They teach the body how to fight off a disease on its own. So without vaccines, more people would get sick and spread the disease around. I don't know if preventing *that* really leads to a selection effect, and I'm too tired to open up PubMed right now, but it would be interesting to find out."
