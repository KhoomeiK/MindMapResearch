IdiotsInCars,fcrnnho,t1_fcr76kv,1577904186.0,"I actually got into a heated back and forth on the Michigan subreddit, I live in Michigan, about people not clearing their cars off and it was crazy how many people tried to argue with me that it’s more work for THEM to completely clear the car off and one guy actually said “oh so you expect me to climb on top of my jeep to clear the snow off the roof? Get fucked.” And I swear to god I wanted to throw myself off a roof. I can’t believe people like that exist. Luckily with the jeep comment, I had multiple people come to my defense and say things along the lines of if you can’t handle every aspect of the vehicle you own, get a different vehicle dumbass. It made my day haha"

survivorsofabuse,fc3lqft,t3_efyw30,1577392685.0,"Cut her out of your life. You and your siblings. You will be better off. She’s shown you her hand, don’t hurt yourselves worse by trying to reason with a lying narcissist who obviously just enjoys hurting people. Blood does not make you family. Do yourselves a favor here, end that relationship. I don’t even know your mom but this post told me everything I need to know about her and that is that she is toxic to you and your siblings. I’m so sorry this happened on Christmas. That’s a shit way to spend Christmas. I hope this next year brings less of her and more of you and your siblings starting to heal the wounds she flayed open. Best of luck moving forward. ❤️💔"
