facepalm,ff43e9m,t1_ff3zq58,1579554670.0," You don't know exactly how long a guest is going to take to eat. Sometimes you think a guest will be leaving soon because you see the checkbook on the table so you plan to put a party there when they get up, but then they camp out and talk forever so you have to rearrange your chart. You can't plan super far ahead because each night is going to be a different dynamic. If you left the table open long before the guests arrive, half the restaurant would be empty all day. 

Every restaurant is different and every host is different, for me when I hosted I tended to plan in 45-90 minute increments because that's about how long the average guest stayed. So if I see a few reservations coming up in an hour, I'll plan to seat them at tables that I think will be done eating in an hour. Sometimes another table opens up first and I'll move around my chart. Reservations always go before walk in guests on the wait list as long as there is a table large enough to accommodate them, but sometimes guests will still ask us why someone who came in after them is getting served first."

TwoXChromosomes,fezgbmi,t1_fexagd0,1579457041.0,"I was pro life until I was 15 and thought I was pregnant (spoiler: I actually was not). But then I became pro choice.

There's a lot of ways to learn and expand your mind without having to personally experience the thing, and it shouldn't require a close personal brush to actually think about how other people are effected.

TwoXChromosomes,fezd1l9,t1_fex843r,1579456062.0,"I was not born with perfect morals, but I feel super shitty when I get put in a situation that I previously judged, but that hasn't happened in a long time. I thought I was pregnant when I was 15 (I wasn't) but I immediate thought about getting an abortion. Up until that point I had just believed in pro life. It was a huge lesson for me, and I try to hold to it today. Like, I've never had a kid been gay or homeless or a sex worker and I'll probably never be in that situation, but I can empathize without having to have gone through those things personally. Point is, I felt super shitty when I realized how wrong I had been.

For me, this post left a bad taste in my mouth because there wasn't a lot of regret or remorse expressed, although I am glad they changed their mind because of course that's a good thing. But it can't be ignored that it took a personal experience with the situation to stop judging people in it. 

It kinda reminds me of that U.S. (senator? I think?) who was super pro gun until his own kid was involved in a school shooting. Like, you didn't feel bad for all those other parents or stop to think about how they felt until now? 

It also kinda reminds me of an ex boyfriend who would be dismissive about my feelings towards things until the same thing happened to him (ex an opposite gender friend stepping over boundaries). And he always wanted brownie points for when he finally saw things from my pov. It's like yeah, you learned from the experience of it happening to you. You could have also just listened to me before we reached this point. 

It's a lesson most people learn as teenagers and children, it's a bit off putting when an adult does it. I'm not sure I think they deserve brownie points for coming around now that it's effected them, it's inherently selfish and low empathy to have only realized something is an issue when it starts to effect you. We have a lot of problems in this world because people want to judge and control others until it effects them and it should always be called out."

I don't give a shit if some of the people who knew about it called him out on his shit.

I've cut off family and friends for being homophobic / racist towards complete strangers. If they were like that to my own sibling, I would be so full of rage I couldn't maintain a relationship with them.

Yeah, someone's second hand air with no compressions is pretty useless most of the time, and if you have no idea why this person stopped breathing or what's going on, you shouldn't do just breaths because they stopped breathing. You should be doing CPR until help arrives. The fact that when help arrives they found out it was only their lungs that are not working is 20/20 hindsight.

I still feel guilty for introducing some kids to the meth bomb ecstasy that went around my school for a while, most of them went on to harder drugs and I can't help but wonder where they would be if I never gave them drugs. I think it's amazing that you and your friends never got hooked but I'd be very cautious about saying most people won't get hooked because of your personal experience with not getting hooked, empirically coke is a very addictive drug."

He didn't realize how wrong it was to push OP to do something she's not ready for, until OP suggested he do something he's not ready for. He blatantly ignored her feelings and acted in direct opposition to her wishes until he had similar feelings. You shouldn't have to personally experience a similar situation as someone else to respect how they want to handle it. 

If he can change his behaviour and support her without making it about him or trying to push her to do things she's not ready for, then it can potentially still be healthy. But it can also be healthy to have a break from him, I don't think what other support she has should play a factor in her taking a break from him. 

To rely on a single someone emotionally for support, immediately after they've just disrespected your agency and threatened to leave you, can be just as damaging as having no support at all. I can't say one way or the other, both options have potential up and down sides."

Just don't use oils like that too often, even hair safe ones can be drying. The flour by itself will work fine, just won't have scent. 

Once every month to two months I use a mix of about two cups water to two table spoons acv, one egg yolk, and sometimes a tea spoon or two of jojoba oil or almond oil, put it on dry hair (I apply with a hair dye bottle, makes measuring and distributing easy), leave for 10 minutes, rinse in cold water."
NoPoo,fefxkrl,t1_feeg5l9,1579068551.0,"I haven't personally tried it, but from some quick research a did, Castile soap is even more basic than baking soda. 

*However* 

Castile soap will dissolve better into the water, and is less abrasive. 

*However again,* the process of using a base followed by an acid still gives us the paper clip hair cuticle dilemma. 

I had an idea that maybe you could mix the vinegar into the soap to cancel out the base, but that was quickly dashed when then I learned it will just un-soapify the soap, leaving just the oils and an ugly curdled mess. 

I'm personally a big fan of cleansing oils, flour, and the occasional egg wash. But I can't speak personally to Castile soap. And I can't find too much about it online, a few things for it, a few things against, and a lot from Castile soap websites as the top results, I can't really do a deep dive right now. 


Depending on if your hair is chemically processed, if you ever use heat, how fine vs course your hair is and the natural pH balance you have, it could work for you. As I said, some people report long term success with BS and vinegar rinses and I said maybe they're lying, but that still leaves the possibility that maybe they're not. 

From the websites I read on using it for hair, they warn you may have a greasy phase and then a dry phase. I take it with a grain of salt, it was from Castile soap websites. 

I'm leading towards potential long-term damage but milder damage than baking soda. Having grits of semi-dilluted baking soda in your hair naturally means the parts the undissolved baking soda touches will be more basic than totally dissolved soap, but there's just not enough info out there for me to say definitively. 

I'm running out of data so pages are taking a long while to load, but I did see an add for pH balanced Castile soap, maybe you could check that out. 

 I do want to warn against two things concerning acidic rinses: 

First, using lemon as your acidic rinsing agent. It makes you photosensitive, or react more quickly to UV, and is essentially a ""bleaching"" agent. It's why people often use it in their hair then go in the sun, it will lighten your hair. If you get lemon juice on your skin and go out in the sun, it will leave little white speckles on your skin. It's why if you use a vitamin c serum on your skin you have to keep the bottle away from sunlight and religiously apply sunscreen to your skin. Over time this can leave dark hair with a brassy tone, and it dries the hair from the inside out, leading to thinner and more brittle shafts over time. 

Second: Vinegar is safer to use as long as you are diluting it well compared to how often you use it. 

  Lemon juice and vinegar essentially have the same pH (2-3 acidity), but lemon juice is just different mostly due to the vitamin c causing so much uv damage. 

You can use vinegar more often if you're diluting it a lot. You just don't want too much acid too often, it can be drying and also has the problem of shrinking the hair shaft over time (which is what causes the drying, think of it as just having less room for moisture.) But vinegar won't make you as brittle as vit c because there's less sun damage. 

Essentially, stick to vinegar. If your diluting it one table spoon vinegar per one cup water, maybe twice a month. If you're doing a a few table spoons to like a liter of water, you'll probably be fine doing it as much as once or twice  a week. Check out the pH balanced Castile soap, keep trying it and keep an eye on it. Worst that can happen is it'll dry your hair out a bit and you'll just need a moisturizing treatment and a trim. Best that can happen is you find a cheap way to have awesome hair. I'd say the risk to reward ratio is worth it to keep experimenting with it."
NoStupidQuestions,fefspjg,t3_eoxars,1579064047.0,"People have mentioned the pay of going into specialty fields, but they could have just as easily gone into feet or eyes or butts or whatever. As far as why someone would chose this specific specialty, most gynos are also OBs (ob-gyns). 
I gather there's a lot of job satisfaction stemming from a sense if purpose if part of your job is about getting to deliver babies into the world. 

People also tend to go into fields that have personally effected someone they know, it wasn't too long ago people were dying from back ally abortions so maybe things like birth control and reproductive health Care is an issue they care about, or maybe someone they know had cervical cancer or something. 

Or maybe it just kinda happened that way lol. I have no idea why I'm good at algebra and not geometry. My college/career plan is to basically just take a variety of classes and see which ones I excell at and go from there.

TrueOffMyChest,fe8mh51,t1_fe8526r,1578927933.0,"Of course. I hate it when servers complain about consistently getting little tips, chances are 9 times out of 10 they're the problem. I thankfully don't have to work with very many servers like that anymore at the place I'm at now, but when I worked at shittier restaurants the entitlement was infuriating.

 I knew several servers at several different restaurants who would literally just take the order, bring out the drink, bring out the food, drop off bill, and that's it. Barely even a smile or anything resembling good customer service, then bitch about making shitty tips (and never being scheduled for good shifts and being given the bad sections). I personally though they were lucky they were still making %10, because I personally witnessed them fucking off with a million smoking breaks or flirting with the cooks or on their phone hidden away from guests. And of course as I'd be walking around the floor trying to take care of my tables, their tables became my problem because they need stuff and can't find their server. 

I follow r/serverlife and that place is absolutely toxic sometimes, I got downvoted to hell because I suggested the somewhat traditional guideline that a %20 percent tip should only be expected for really good service, because everyone thought it should be %20 *minimum*, and even more on top of that for above and beyond service. 

I think server culture dug itself into a hole now, it went from the guilt trippy ""tip us or we'll starve!!"" to now ""don't get rid of tips, the money is better than what I'd make elsewhere!!"" 

I know I'm getting long winded but the whole thing pisses me off. I think the model pushed of ""anything less than a %10 percent tip makes you a terrible person unless the waiter personally spit on your tie on purpose, otherwise you have to tip no matter how bad the service was"" is going to eventually lead to the downfall of tipping."

My restaurant is busy (two and a half hour wait time on weekends) and it's still not about trying to turn tables over to make more money. People who spend good money to eat out do not want to be rushed, they will take it out on your tip if you rush them. No one is worried about table turn over when it's busy because we're all gonna do at *least* 2,000 in sales anyway. Also partially because tip pool.  Which is more common these days, as it was at the beginning of last year after a new policy that made it legal to pool tips across the majority of the U.S. (How long ago was your most recent serving experience? If it was more than a year ago tip pooling was not as big of a factor as it is now). 

It's either you aren't filled to capacity and you can take on more tables in unassigned sections. Or you're busy and on a wait list and don't need to worry about milking a few extra tables in a night. And again pooling tips is more common as it's become legal.

Moving on: Most restaurants are not full to 100 percent capacity every day or limiting servers from picking up extra tables when there are customers waiting for service. ""You need to flip tables to make money"" is only true if you are limited to only picking up a certain amount of tables. 

Are you basing your opinion off having worked in restaurants or observation from eating in them? Doesn't really change anything either way, just curious. 

 I very much doubt there is any kind of empirical evidence out there tracking what model of seating restaurants across the country use, and your opinion is just as anecdotal as mine, which again, the anecdotal aspect isn't relevant at all as this isn't a research paper and the point wasn't about how norm it is or isn't  But I am curious why you think that this is a ""strong rule"" and why you are so confident in that assumption."
