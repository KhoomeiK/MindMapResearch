personalfinance,fezszxo,t1_fezqy4v,1579461266.0,"Again though for many of us living here it's an absolutely spectacular life. California gets a lot of hate from the rest of the US but take it from someone who has only ever lived outside of California for 6 months my life, living here has been absolutely spectacular. I'm an hour from the beach, a few hours from excellent skiing, mere minutes from some of the best restaurants and entertainment in the country. We have the 5th largest economy on Earth, and are the greatest job creator in the United States.

It's not like we don't have problems, homelessness is an issue, and rent and housing costs are definitely high, but the pay is good, there's lots of great parks, the people are amazing, the weather is flawless, and overall it's a spectacular state to live in... If you can afford it. And that's a big if for most people."
personalfinance,fezlio7,t1_fezbo66,1579458616.0,"I mean, if you can afford it though...it's kind of an excellent place to live. Plus this guy is talking about $56,000/year salary. Well I am a teacher and I make over $88,000/year salary for 9 months work. CA pays more for most jobs, ergo the cost of living is higher. It's economics.

I also bike 5min to work from my home in the suburbs South of Oakland. It's kind of excellent."

Assuming the article is somewhat true then it's a decent enough argument that economic growth isn't the only important factor in a society. But there are too many factors involved to conclude that Cuba is a better place to live than anywhere else in the world. I want to believe it is, but I don't have enough evidence to support that."

So, wake up at 4am to get up close and personal with penguins waking up and going out to fish. Broke no laws, stayed a good distance from them so as not to disturb them, but also got to see them close up instead of the other tourist schlebs who had to stand on a cliff above with binoculars to view the penguins.

unpopularopinion,fdmgpgp,t1_fdk3dfo,1578549306.0,"Firstly I need to state that I'm not a NIMBY, I'm one of the few in my neighborhood who supports building a large apartment complex proposal just a few blocks down. 

Having said that not all NIMBYism is evil. In the 70's there was a massive proposal to dam and drain huge shallow parts of the South Bay of SF to open up a massive swath of land for expansion. From SF to Hayward area. I'm glad for the NIMBYs who fought against that, it would have been hideous urban sprawl. 

In many parts of the SF Bay there just isn't much room to expand without cutting into state and county forest or other beautiful areas which make it so lovely to live here in the first place. So with limited space and high demand you get high cost of living. Easy math. 

But on the other side of the hill in Dublin and Livermore the residential construction is some of the fastest developing in the country."

But I'm also relaying to you my personal experience in countries that are considered impoverished, the people overwhelmingly are incredibly kind, welcoming, joyful, giving, and gracious.

And again this isn't true of every impoverished country, from my personal experiences in all my travels the difference is inequality. In countries where there is a vast gap between the ultra-rich and the very poor, poverty is dismal, depressing, and a brutal existence. The number one place I've seen this is India, and parts of Africa. 

But in countries where the entire citizenry is at a similar level of wealth, and as long as the government isn't some brutal dictatorship, the citizens tend to be really surprisingly incredible and happy.

It would take me a book long of writing to try to parse out why, but that's just what I've observed."

They are not being greedy, there is an awe-inspiring generosity and joyfulness among people from countries such as these. I've traveled to 38 countries in my life and the one thing I realized without question is that many of the poorer countries are indeed overall happier in many ways. (not always, especially in BIG poor cities, I'm speaking more rural) than us with our relatively lavish lifestyles."

It truly makes one question whether all this wealth and technology we surround ourselves with really makes us happy. Sure living in poverty has moments that truly suck (getting sick or hurt without access to medical care), but overall life seems better for many people in impoverished countries which seems counter-intuitive."

4. Obviously a life of prayer and celibacy doesn't do anything to quell your desires because that's not how humans work.
