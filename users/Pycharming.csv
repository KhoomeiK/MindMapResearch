DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff9qnur,t1_ff937we,1579718859.0,"Sorry, I made an assumption based on the meme and that many similar products are labeled for men. Again, I get frustrated at the usual marketing because I too love those scents and usually end up buying the things with ""for men"" stamped on them, which gets frustrating when shopping for something like shampoo, because the ""masculine"" brands don't work well with my hair so I have to settle for that generic floral scent."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff9ovs3,t1_ff9lk42,1579717580.0,"Yes, I noted in one of my other comments that this particular soap isn't actually targeted to men, but the meme presented it that way and many similar products are specifically labeled for men."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff7zeb3,t1_ff7xenx,1579662018.0,"Looking up this soap in particular and it's not actually advertised specifically to men, but in my defense I assumed because of the meme and countless similar products that turn up if you Google soap and smoke. I'm not making up that one of the first results pitches a soap for ""hardworking men"" who ""like beer and power tools"". Most of these soaps are selling an identity unrelated to the actual smell. This meme might have chosen the wrong soap to exemplify a very real trend in marketing targeted towards men."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff7vmms,t1_ff7sxs5,1579659426.0,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a woman and I like a lot of wood and smoke scents, and even the smell of some whiskeys as long as they don't have a lot of peat. But that's why I find the marketing weird, because they feel the need to divide their market when there's nothing essentially manly about these scents. 

Soap fragrances for women are less marketed as something to make you more feminine and more about how the scents make you feel (lavender is calming, citrus energizing, etc). I think a camp fire scent would be more attractive if it was sold as ""this soap will make you feel like you're at a camp fire"" and less ""this soap will make you seem like the type of *man* who enjoys camp fires""."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff7rbva,t1_ff7k63w,1579656475.0,"Many colognes do use a smoky wood scent. I imagine that's what dominates with some undertones that wouldn't be noticable anyways. I know my soap fragrance does not last like a perfume.

 Marketing though is still ridiculous. Like are most men so easily fooled into thinking that the smell of those things makes them ""manly""?"
Jokes,ff7py16,t3_erzqvf,1579655505.0,I was expecting it to circle back around with the idea that at 80 you don't give a fuck about looking like pervy old men. Appreciate this direction though.
learnprogramming,ff7nci1,t3_ertbrd,1579653677.0,"Others have covered the basic differences, but I'd stress that or depends heavily on the school. Where I went, CSE did not have good teaching faculty so students would try to take every CS crosslisted class they could. Many of my engineering friends said they regretted not doing CS because their gpa suffered and in the end they were only using the CS knowledge for their job. The engineering school was slightly more prestigious, but it ended up not being worth it when many places have gpa cut off and don't look into which school within a university."

suspiciouslyspecific,ff5bbtq,t1_ff4pa7y,1579586047.0,"Ah makes sense. My brother got vivance (sp?) from his friends when the doctor stopped prescribing, but eventually the doctor put him back on a low dose because the alternative was for him to continue refusing bipolar meds and he'd find the vivance anyways.

Now he's convinced he's not bipolar and it was just a bad reaction to weed... Sigh..."
suspiciouslyspecific,ff4jvwh,t1_ff49abq,1579565382.0,"Bipolar people often have comorbid ADHD, and Adderall can trigger mania for a bipolar person. Bipolar can also make people want to abuse Adderall (and other drugs) while in a depressed state, because they like mania or simply prefer it over depression. In fact, the similarities and rate of comorbidity make some doctors believe that stimulant induced mania is a sign of an underlying issue (such as bipolar)

It is strange why OP would have access to Adderall if they were still having mood swings. Usually doctors stop stimulants if the patient is not stable. Then again, I have no idea if OP is getting treatment."

Here is one, it only briefly talks about mushu but I can't find the thing I read years ago in class. This was waaaaay before the Mulan remake was conceived. We were reading the original ballad and  it's various adaptions. It may have been an article about Disney cultural representations in general. I do remember they also commented that Mulan is a huge mix of several historical periods when he comes to the art design and that way another issue with Chinese audiences."

I did live most of my life in a part of the US where this was not common, but now I live somewhere (still within the US) where it's about 50/50, and actually makes it really confusing to meet people because it's not defined by whether the setting is casual or professional. And it's not safe to assume that all Latina women will want to hug and everyone else will shake hands. It's not the exception, different cultures have different rules."

It shouldn't be hard to account for the fact that most people will buy paper towels on a regular basis, but a treadmill once in their lifetime. 

In fact, Amazon aught to be able to predict how frequently I buy things and be recommending socks a week before I notice holes. They have the data and resources, why are they not using it?"

She did a great thing, but if we want to fight the slut shaming tendency to treat sex work as less then other kinds of labor, we need to not frame this situation as exceptional.

They never compared it to the n word because that's a reclaimed slur, but they did express anger over how black people get told their speech is uneducated, unprofessional, whatever, but when white people use the same language it's trendy.

Eventually the complaints died down, idk why. Maybe because the current slang all comes from the black drag community specifically and they can't claim membership without conflating drag with lgtb+ and that's other can of worms."

science,fdcy970,t1_fdcqxcb,1578287879.0,"Almost every comment agreeing with the study is anecdotal as well. I did read it and it's an entirely self reported study about anticipated aggression, not observed acts.  This is only one step above anecdotal evidence, because you're relying completely on women's perception of what other women will do and to justify their own actions (which psychology has shown is not something people can reliable do) Then the article goes on to suggest sole causation despite not exploring any other factors. Social issues are complex and the study from the onset only explores one angle.

 For example the second experiment asks about a co-ed and an all female function, and completely ignores that women would also be at the co-ed event. That would suggest that it's the presence of men that causes women to dress more provocatively, not the presence of women making them more conservative. But the women are only questioned on female aggression as explanation. I'd say this study only suggests a) women anticipate aggression from other women based on attractiveness and b) women dress more conservatively around other women. Like a lot of evolutionary psychology, it has a real issue with causation that borderlines  speculation."

They are also far more affordable and have been commercially available at home longer, impossible burgers for a long time weren't available in grocery stores in part because it doesn't look appealing raw. 

I also don't think the impossible burger (at least at the places I've had it) tastes like beef, but rather some other type of meat (something more gamey). If you told me it was buffalo or something like that, I'd believe you (mind you I've never had buffalo)"

 Unfortunately, it was a pain for them at the time because at least in the US they make it easier for one person to change their name when they marry, but to change both you need to go through the lengthy legal name change process, which I think also includes a fee."

 Not to mention, I've never heard of human hair being more prone to pathogens than any other. Hair waste, like from barber shops, can develop pathogens but only in decomposition. Otherwise hair isn't a good source of food for viruses or bacteria. The closest you get is lice, which do not live long in hair that has been removed from the head."

It doesn't help a lot of people in my life will say I look like I lost weight even when I had not yet (or even had gained). 

And especially during the holidays, you risk complimenting someone who lost weight but is gaining some back in the holidays and might not like the reminder.
