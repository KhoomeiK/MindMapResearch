college,ff3lhcv,t1_ff3klkk,1579543580.0,"Yeah, well to get certified in a language you need to have a reached a certain level of proficiency. Your example is purely anecdotal. Language learning is truly a “use it or lose it” thing, as research has shown, it only takes a matter of 2-3 years of not using a language *regularly* to completely lose fluency in a language. I was near-fluent in mandarin, now I don’t remember much, because I haven’t used it in a couple of years. I use my French more, so I’m still proficient. People can even forget their mother tongues. So, at one point your students would have been proficient, if they got official certification, they just haven’t maintained the skill, so it’s rather foolish of them to still list it. You’re trying to correct all of my comments, but you’re wrong. This says a lot about you and your level of insecurity."

The war was actually successful, until Obama pulled troops too early, before leaders could be established, which allowed terror regimes to run rampant, then he sent $150billion to Iran so their terror regimes could buy weapons and develop nuclear power.

For example, the largest podcasts and YouTube shows are mostly right wing and the audiences for those are predominantly young people (15-35). If you want a more anedotical example, I go to your typical “left wing” college, but our signups for Republican club hit an all time high this year with 95 signups...the dems only got about 25. People of all races and sexualities signed up (yes we have a few lgbtq), male and female. Even I’m on the board, as a female of black/white descent. The “identity politics” & dismissing the right as “straight, white males”  is simply a faulty generalization/stereotype. And nah, I’d argue that the liberals are quite regressive. Conservatives just want limited gov and freedom for all. We just want to protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We encourage charity, fundraising, helping one another- over failed gov programs forcing your money out of you whilst growing more powerful. Heck, GoFundMe is proof that private entities are more beneficial than the gov. People misinterpret the point of government, and forget that we the people are the authority- not the gov. We also don’t care if you smoke weed (most I’ve encountered are high anyways lol), sleep with whoever, or transition. Yes, some conservatives might crack jokes about lgbtq or find it strange (at this point only really the “t”), but if you listen to them talk, they all say something along the lines of, “yeah I think it’s strange, but as long as you’re an adult, you can alter your body however you choose”."

First of all, I’m very sorry for your loss. I can’t imagine that kind of pain.
Now, she’s not your kid. You don’t owe her a thing. You saved this hard-earned money & you shouldn’t give a single penny of it to a woman who is apparently not even kind to you. She isn’t even kind to you, but feels entitled to *your* money? You worked for it long before you married this man, you haven’t even been married to this man long. It is 100% yours. Also, might sound harsh, but marriages end as well. It is a total possibility that yours could end & these people will end up strangers again & you would’ve given your money to a rude girl who you’ll never see again. Do you maybe have a biological niece or nephew who has college debt? That might be a good idea to give it to them. Also, if it upsets your step daughter you can say that she hasn’t been kind, it’s your money, these are your biological relatives, and/or student loans are more important than “cushion money”. To be blunt; how dare someone ask for your dead daughters money, in any regard, the nerve! 

PS...be careful when donating to charities! Your money doesn’t always go where you think it does! And that’s a LOT of money!! It might just be safer to donate a smaller amount in your daughter’s honor and then use the rest to build up a saving Incase you need the money someday."
