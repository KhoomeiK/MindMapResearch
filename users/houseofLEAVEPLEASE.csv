relationships,ff4hci4,t1_ff4g6by,1579563629.0,"Sure. Years ago, I worked for AIG, just after the bailout. They started pitting us against each other for raises, cutting our pay, eliminating bonuses, outsourcing our jobs to Manila and making us train our much cheaper replacements, and, at the same time, they were gifting $1 million+ bonuses to executives. They did this yearly “survey” where they asked our honest opinions about how the company was running, then pretended to care about our feedback before immediately ignoring and discarding it. One day they had someone from corporate come and have a big meeting with everyone at our location to tell us a bunch of lies and pretend they weren’t fucking us all over because they were doing *super generous things* like giving us free soda and popcorn on Fridays. So I stood up in that meeting and I asked the executive a lot of difficult questions that he either couldn’t or didn’t want to answer. The entire exchange took maybe fifteen minutes and it infuriated my manager because she thought that it made her look bad so she stood up to talk about how great the company was. She was booed, and there was a small smattering of applause for me for fighting back. It was one of the proudest moments of my life because I felt like I’d fought back for every “little guy” in the company. The exec told me, in front of everyone, to “find another place to work”, and I told him that I planned on it. 

At the temp place I was let go from, I was paired with a guy on my 2nd day to learn the job and he recognized me because he was there that day (we apparently worked there at the same time). He was very complimentary and even called me his “hero”. I’m not gonna lie, that meant a lot to me... and then it got back to the higher-ups in this little company, who were in the same building. I’m pretty sure they immediately decided I was a trouble-maker and didn’t want to take the risk of keeping me on. 

So that’s why my contract was ended."

I think of Amish kids, who are removed from school in 7th or 8th grade, then have zero legitimate options for escape when they’re adults and no opportunities to flourish because all they know is their community. I think of kids like OP whose parents learn to look at them like property instead of independent human beings, and then disown them because God is supposed to come first, and if they have a non-religious child then God probably wants you not to associate with them, right? I think of myself, and all of the psychological trauma that I endured and and am still trying to overcome at 33 that stemmed from being in Christian schools and a Pentecostal home and church until I was about 16. Kids deserve to grow up without this fucking weight hanging around their necks, hobbling and misinforming and damaging them. They are not the property of their parents, and unfortunately, I think that we all know that parents do *not* always know what’s best for their children."

This place gives out stamp cards for a free drink after you visit ten times, and I started to notice that he was giving me full stamp cards every time he brought me a coffee. Like, daily. One day I went with him when he got me a coffee and, without even thinking about it, he said “oh, the girl at the window is the one who always gives me full stamp cards!” She smiled when she saw him, frowned when she saw me, then gave him a stamp card with only one stamp. Now I duck down in the car if I’m ever with him to get coffee. And I happily accept the perks of other girls thinking he’s available and giving him free stuff. 

He didn’t notice that any of this was happening. So... a lot of times, they don’t notice."
