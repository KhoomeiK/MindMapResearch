DestinyTheGame,fdk5p5q,t1_fdjzozn,1578496656.0,"FOMO is fear of missing out. 

So, last season how vex offensive armour and weapons went away ""forever"", this season all the sundial weapons and armour are going away ""forever"". The season pass ornaments and emote, gone ""forever"", even a lot of Eververse stuff goes away now instead of just being placed in the store for purchase.

All of it is done to trigger peoples fear of missing out. ""I need this now, before it's gone and I can never get it again"". It's an extremely gross tactic and it goes into manipulation. All so they get people grinding out and slaving away at these activities season after season."

With America it \*is\* everyones crisis. Because of America, everyone else in the world gets dragged into shit one way or another. Directly, indirectly, economically. Your nation manages to affect every single nation you interact with and every nation adjacent to them. It's ok if humour isn't your way of dealing with the reality of the fact that America can fuck the world over but you definitely do \*not\* have a claim over what is ""funny"" or not. Especially as an American. Everyone living there has a more direct say and vote on who is in power, and what they get away with. Don't blame the outside world for trying to lighten up the shitty smelling breeze that an entire country full of people keep restocking over and over. Get off your high horse and go do something about it if you \*truly\* don't like how things are happening."

Don't get me wrong either, a lot of people that work there are fantastic but for whatever reason it feels like whenever somethings in a good place, the higherups scramble to find a way  to undo, change, or make said thing worse and I have no actual idea why. What was so bad with how D1 ended with the Age of Triumph that none of those core systems stayed?"

\> the move from space trenchcoats to space dresses or the loss of holographic Bonds

\>  the only reason you're running it is for one ability in PvP

\> there isn't really much synergy here, nor is there much in the realm of build possibilities beyond ""you get grenades and super faster""

\> Ball Lightning and Celestial Fire, two ranged melee abilities that... aren't melee abilities, for some reason

\> **Warlocks are the only class that especially leans into the ""fantasy"" part of ""space fantasy"", but are left behind in terms of being bugged to shit and not having very interesting kits that allow for building.**

&#x200B;

110% correct on all accounts. It's clear that either Bungie has stopped giving any care about Warlock OR the person who is now in charge of those decisions for the class(es) has no legitimate idea what they're doing or what a Warlock is about. Our looks went down the drain, why would ANYONE want to wear all these stupid robes. What happened to the trench coats. Subclasses and trees either bugged, useless, or severely underwhelming. Worst pvp performance by FAR. Worst overall exotics by FAR. This is why I've stopped going on Warlock except for bounties.

&#x200B;

The class sucks, looks dumb 95% of the time, flat out isn't \*fun\* and \*\*sucks\*\*."
DestinyTheGame,fcgfzhq,t1_fcdhf5m,1577639573.0,"Came here to comment just this. Even if SIVA never returns as a regular enemy in an open world zone, having them reemerge in a dungeon would be fantastic."
depression,fccrdqi,t3_eh1hgi,1577601738.0,"I didn’t start feeling this way until I opened up to my ex, which made her do all sorts of things to force me into ending the relationship. All her issues were apparently fine to vent and talk about and be there as emotional support but when I opened up and it turned out I had stuff going on myself, that was a man extremely quick decline in a multi year relationship.

So, now guess I do believe nobody will love me or to put it bluntly, even really accept me if I bring up my issues. Opening up only makes stuff worse."
depression,fccqn8m,t3_egz4nv,1577601489.0,I wouldn’t say I outright hate compliments but they never do feel real for me. Whenever compliments happen it just feels like the other person is trying to be nice and that they don’t *truly* mean it.

DestinyTheGame,fc9okcf,t1_fc88vff,1577555809.0,"Don't get me wrong, I feel like Warlock has great choices in every subclass in pve, which is fantastic.

DestinyTheGame,fc9ocx2,t1_fc8g708,1577555717.0,Pretty much. Mobility is king in pvp.
DestinyTheGame,fc9o6ne,t1_fc8x946,1577555641.0,"Believe what you want, doesn't change the fact that Warlocks don't have many options to compete with. Whereas the other 2 classes (Titans to a lesser extent than Hunters) have more options and therefore more overall variety."

DestinyTheGame,fc9ntks,t1_fc95x2m,1577555482.0,"Maybe in lower ELO games or for the first few times, but most people catch on extremely quick. It's just not strong enough compared to what HHSN offers in a close-medium range OHK and strong damage reduction at choice."
DestinyTheGame,fc8376q,t1_fc7sc5e,1577525737.0,"To be fair, Warlocks have been an awful pvp class since launch. Years now they’re consistently behind Hunters and Titans. So some people might just be entirely fed up being the bottom tier class by a large margin, meanwhile Hunter players somehow always manage to play the victim and underplay how good they have it in pvp.


It doesn’t help that melee speed hasn’t changed since launch. It doesn’t help that every update seems to break some perk on a Warlock subclass. It doesn’t help that “reworks” either end up falling flat (top tree solar) or end up neutering existing choices (taking away movement speed in super in a purely super dependant bottom tree for solar). It doesn’t help that Hunters are the majority so any post aimed at pointing out how bloated their kits are, how insanely strong their class ability is, how many great options they have for pvp and exotics is met down a barrage of downvotes into oblivion because they make up the majority.


To call the Warlock “experience” frustrating is beyond putting it lightly."

DestinyTheGame,fc81sah,t1_fc7s6qi,1577524608.0,It’s the only pvp class for Warlocks anyways. All the other options suck.
DestinyTheGame,fc81lvo,t1_fc7g3ll,1577524476.0,"I’d gladly take a nerf to HHSN if it meant warlocks actually had multiple viable pvp choices and didn’t get some bug where a perk doesn’t work every update..

It’s a joke that HHSN and contraverse is really the only big choice for Warlocks. Titans have a few more options but not much and then hunters just have bloated kits across their subclasses and multiple amazing exotics for pvp.

Being a Warlock player sucks in Destiny 2.."
