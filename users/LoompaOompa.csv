As a counter point to this -- My mother is an incredible story teller, and one of the things that makes her stories so enthralling is that she is very good at organically building suspense. She knows exactly when to stretch and add details in order to get a person on the edge of their seat before hitting them with the punchline.

gamemaker,fevrsbk,t3_eqk8do,1579400752.0,"It looks like you've got a solution that works for you, but I wanted to offer an alternative for other people who read this.

1) Give the object a variable called something like shieldAvailable. Default it to true, and add a check for it before allowing the shield.

2) When the shield breaks. set shieldAvailable to false, and set ""alarm[0] = 500"" (or however many steps the cooldown should be in effect for). The alarms are built-in timers for instances. You have 12 of them to use on each object. 

3) Define the Alarm0 event on your object to set shieldAvailable back to true.

I think this is a little cleaner because it doesn't dirty up the step event with timer logic."
gamemaker,fevnb24,t1_fevkr0o,1579399280.0,"I haven't done that tutorial, so maybe I don't understand the full problem, but in addition to what was recommended above, can't you do something like 

if (y < (0 - size_of_the_ship) ) {

 y = room_height - control_bar_height_in_pixels

}

Edit: I took a look a the tutorial video so I have a better idea of what's going on now. I think you should just stop using move_wrap and define the logic to jump to the other side of the room completely on your own. You can use the if statements that have been provided to you so far as a base for it. If you want to do the x coordinates you can just change the y to x and use room_width instead of room_height.

it looks like move_wrap has a margin argument, where you can set a pixel margin, but it's going to work on all sides of the room. You could use that, but then you'd have to make the room larger than the viewport on the left, right, and top by the same margin as the status bar. I'm pretty new to Game Maker as well so I don't know how complicated that is, but I imagine it's a lot more complicated than doing 4 if statements for when x <0, x> room_width, y < 0, and y > (room_height - control bar).

I hope this is helpful"

I don't feel like exclusives are the reason you buy something like this.

To me, the appeal of a product like this is that people can take the 100s of games that they already have on Steam, EGS, GoG, Xbox Game Pass, etc. and play them on the go in a comfortable and convenient way. Obviously some of my games are going to require more power than this thing can dish out, but probably >80% of my steam library would be playable on this.

I think Dead Cells is a better game, but think that has more to do with its production quality and scope. I think the mechanics of Rogue Legacy are completely sound. It has a great flow with all of the the dashing, double jumping, and bouncing. I think they really nailed the controls, and I still come back to it from time to time. Rogue Legacy is a simpler game, but it executes on that simplicity very well. 

The only mechanic in Rogue Legacy that is bad is the trait gimmick. It was a neat and funny idea at the time (and I admit it's one of the things that got my attention about the game), but once you've learned the ins and outs of the game it doesn't add anything except to be annoying.
