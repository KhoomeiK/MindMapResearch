insaneparents,ff5jpj2,t3_erf0hm,1579596096.0,"Grandfather: Is it my fault that I'm an alcoholic pathological liar and my son won't let me see my grandchildren and can't stand me?

Grandfather: No. It's my evil daughter in laws fault that I can't see the kids and that my son hates me. How dare she value their wellbeing over my 'rights'?"

WatchPeopleDieInside,fdd0imp,t3_ekjoag,1578290003.0,Anyone tries that shit with me they're going to have some sore toes.
inlaws,fdd0h3t,t3_ekp0se,1578289959.0,"Oh yes...been there, done that, still hearing it. I lost 30kg last year, my start weight was 99kg. Apparently I'm now 'too skinny', 'need to eat a few pies', 'keto will kill you'. No, what will kill me is diabetes and being dangerously overweight. Listen, those people that have a go at you for wanting to be healthy are just projecting. You're not to blame for how they feel about themselves. FTR we don't have anything to do with the in laws (hubby's decision) and before we cut contact I realised how nasty they were behind my back about my appearance. Needless to say I nearly gave one of them a heart attack when they saw me recently. You do you, and they can go to hell if they think they have the right to berate you for choosing to be healthy."
christmas,fczil2t,t1_fczgdt5,1578102037.0,Perfect! I need more lights. Ours is a six footer so one more string might just be enough. Thanks ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
christmas,fczf5r4,t3_ejhqtn,1578099883.0,Love it so much! This is exactly how I want my tree this Christmas..all lit up! I bought a 300 light string so hopefully it's enough. Thank you for inspiring me!
inlaws,fczej9i,t3_ejokvm,1578099408.0,"My own parents love their grandkids and will do anything for them, but my FIL (who we cut off for our own safety and wellbeing) would only do something for the kids if he got something from it. He was about wanting all the glory for next to no effort. Children are smart, they pick up on that sort of thing."
aww,fczcvnx,t3_ejlwpp,1578098383.0,Serious case of the giggles when saw the larger t-rex strutting towards the doors
CatsAreAssholes,fcmrebd,t3_eht1io,1577788493.0,I feel so judged and it's not even my cat
CatsAreAssholes,fcmrdg8,t1_fcm3q08,1577788459.0,Yet here you are....just sitting here.
trashy,fcmgawo,t1_fcme3ck,1577774169.0,Thanks! I definitely find more supportive people on the internets than irl that's for sure!
trashy,fcmc3i2,t1_fclp8lv,1577770112.0,"This definitely rings true right now. I've lost 30kg this year through keto and low carb. A couple of us at work eat healthy and have lost weight, but get looked down on for some reason while everyone else eats terribly tbh."
christmas,fcbslmv,t3_egzs7q,1577590510.0,Beautiful! The arrangement of ornaments is impeccable!
inlaws,fcbk4cb,t1_fcbjkzj,1577587799.0,"I'd say they've helped enough going by previous postings. If the mother cannot care for the child's needs herself and it is as bad as it is, then there are other agencies that can step in."
inlaws,fcat73k,t3_egxc6o,1577576129.0,Stop buying stuff for her? You're digging a hole for yourself if you keep doing so.
aww,fcasbxv,t1_fcaix3k,1577575653.0,Feeling offended?
inlaws,fc7dwhq,t1_fc74hf1,1577504546.0,He gives his laundry to his mother. He's not exactly helping anything. He's a grown man whose mother still does his laundry. Those apron strings need to be cut. Sooner rather than later (like now)...trust me on this.
inlaws,fc7dpnb,t3_egiktq,1577504393.0,"If your husband can't back you up and stand up to them then things are not going to change. If you don't have him on board then, unless you leave him, your life is going to suck."
Instagramreality,fc7dduh,t3_eggjgf,1577504129.0,"I feel sad for their children, particularly their daughters. Imagine growing up and having a mum that is so insecure that she has to photoshop every photo or video into someone that doesn't even look like her. They're lining their daughters up to be as insecure as they are. It's awful. Screwing with their kids minds."
Instagramreality,fc4w900,t3_eg6cvr,1577431009.0,It's so sad that she does this. Her self esteem must be rock bottom.
Instagramreality,fc4vnvy,t3_eg6d1i,1577430289.0,The hell is wrong with these folk ðŸ˜³
inlaws,fc4tx2k,t3_eg5756,1577428280.0,"Sounds exactly like my in laws. My family treat my husband so well but his family have always been awful to me. I grey rock his family, just barely give them a thought for the way they've treated me and made me feel over the past 20 years. Eventually your other half will do the same with them. Just focus on your life and ignore them."
FiftyFifty,fc1y1w7,t1_fc1grlz,1577333287.0,"Exactly. Happened to someone in my workplace. Struck and killed by a truck as it moved around an intersection in the centre of town, driver had no idea (she went right under) and the first he knew was when he had hit the open road and a cop pulled him over."
newzealand,fblycbc,t1_fbly3ll,1576973492.0,Do not feel bad! We've been there. It's hard! Things will get better for you soon xxx
