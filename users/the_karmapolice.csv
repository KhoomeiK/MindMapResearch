Paleontology,ffajd8g,t3_es5hlw,1579737175.0,Ahh I love opabinia! ðŸ’š
succulents,ff9bvpc,t1_ff9b5yn,1579709431.0,Yes! You might have to remove some lower leaves as well. Check out my edit :)
succulents,ff9almt,t3_esdp1s,1579708613.0,"Leave it out of the soil for a few days so the wound callouses. Repot it into a tight pot with a cactus potting mix. It will likely need some support because the remaining ""stem"" is so short. Put it in as much sunlight as you can and don't water it for several weeks. Periodically you can veeeery lightly lift the plant - if you feel resistance it means roots are forming in the soil. Don't water it until you feel strong resistance when you lift it. This problem likely came from overwatering in the first place, so be cautious going forward. Especially while the new roots are still young and developing.

Edit: it looks like there's some rot still at the end of your remaining ""stem."" Cut that off first to a point where the remaining tissue is all healthy. You'll likely have to remove some lower leaves to give yourself enough ""stem"" to repot it. Then leave it to callous over and continue with the rest I mentioned. Let us know if you have any other questions and good luck!"

SmashingPumpkins,fem2bxl,t3_epq3jk,1579237448.0,"Seriously, thank you for sharing this. Very impressive."
todayilearned,fekvp68,t1_fekpiub,1579208569.0,"No problem! If you have the time I'd recommend it. I definitely did enjoy it, even if it wasn't an accurate portrayal of society."
todayilearned,fejvpih,t1_fejs5bo,1579186939.0,"I just finished this book for the first time! I would back you up on your observation. I feel like roughly the first 70% of it is just a bunch of kids arguing on the beach. Once you reach the part of the book where you find out what ""lord of the flies"" means things start to take a turn, then kind of ramp up exponentially. If you didn't put it down too long ago I'd recommend finishing it off - it does get more interesting at the end for sure!"
todayilearned,fejmp7y,t1_fejdj46,1579180065.0,"Hey, I do too! I just found r/etymology recently and am loving it. You should check it out if you haven't. You'd probably enjoy it. Have a great day!"

AskReddit,fdqmt7k,t1_fdpbbbz,1578670384.0,"Another Emily here! I hear my name called out in public so often that I just started ignoring it, because the chances of me being the Emily in question are so low. However it's gotten me in an embarrassing situation once or twice where I actually was the Emily in question, and was just straight up ignoring a friend/coworker/etc trying to get my attention. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
bodymods,fdqeubf,t3_emnegs,1578664838.0,So cute! I want to get my faith jewelry swapped for some kind of clicker too. I love that yours fits so snugly - do you know what diameter the ring you have is?

cactus,fct3ndv,t3_eiqctd,1577932029.0,My guess is it looks like it got too cold - frost injury maybe? I could be wrong though!
intrusivethoughts,fcm5hgn,t1_fclgkve,1577764747.0,That... is not true. Most Americans definitely know what those are. At least in my experience.
