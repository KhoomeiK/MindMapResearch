Never could pull more than a C average, I just “didn’t get it.” 

One day during sophomore year of high school, I was doodling during class when I looked up because I heard a strange noise. 

My teacher was on almost on all fours, imitating Sméagol (LOTR), singing and hobbling around. 

I don’t know how he did it, and I can’t say it was that moment that caused it, but I went on to take AP Literature and never received anything less than an A in future composition/lit classes, even throughout college. 

I’m still friends with this teacher today, he owns a very unique brewery now."
