I'd also argue that China is a present day example of the rewriting history motif. Between the chilling effect of the state reviewing Weibo, and the Google/China Project Dragonfly returning no results for searches deemed inappropriate (ex: Tiananmen Square Massacre) China has shaped their public consciousness.

LifeProTips,fcfwn5y,t1_fcft8xo,1577634395.0,"Definitely not a hater. Just more of a skeptical realist.

The battery degradation and range anxiety basically falls into two camps: 

- those who never needed to stress it in the first place, because they don't drive more than 20-40 miles a day

- those who can't get an old BEV, and can barely do a new one, because they daily drive more than half the max charge each day (this was me. I almost got one).

For the latter group, battery degradation is *HUGE*.

I am really excited for an EV future, but it's not here yet. We need more infrastructure. I am pretty interested in the new Rivian prototypes though."
LifeProTips,fcec8sq,t1_fce8xd0,1577619097.0,"I understand the economics of time and operation at a dealership. That is what I have an issue with, not the work or worth of a professional mechanic.

Indy shops are great, and exist for a reason. It's the same reason most of the indy shops are started by former dealer mechanics.

Skilled work deserves skilled pay, no doubt. Inflated overhead, BS, and antiquated operating systems do not. 

Dealerships make the majority of their money on financing and service. The way they do that is by taking advantage of their customer. Indy shops make their money by providing better service for a lower cost. Nice bonus is that you are actually paying your mechanic for their skill and expertise - not dealership overhead.

You don't need a dealer for reliable service history. You need a good mechanic and a good owner, who keeps records."

There are a bunch of 1st Gen Nissan Leafs (leaves?) Which are crazy cheap for low miles because the batteries are losing capacity.

In addition, new battery tech is miles ahead of previous development - literally. A few years ago 100 mi range in ideal conditions was news. Now 200+ mile ranges are the expectation.

As far as maintenance costs though, BEVs are the way to go - as long as you have a liquid cooled battery in good condition!"
LifeProTips,fcdzvub,t1_fca3dg2,1577615436.0,"Only point to raise here is not to blindly buy based on badge. Go by particular model/generation. For non car savvy people, an easy way to do this is to look at the resale value/depreciation rate for the car in question.

For example: agree that many Chrysler products are unreliable. The LX platform cars are very reliable. Talking Charger, 300, Challenger. The Chargers and Challengers hold their value exceptionally well.

My wife has a 2013 Charger R/T. It's got 130k on the clock, we've put half of that on there. Only non-maintenance repairs in 65k were a faulty CANBUS module and two wheel speed sensors. Total cost was something like $400 over 5 years.

Had the same thing happen on my old Grand Prix. For me it was a sensor issue - poor design. The key thing was it took my 2006 car with abs and turned it into a car from the early 90s - no abs. Changes how you have to brake in an emergency/hard braking situation"

2 hours at dealer labor where I live is about $200-225. Quoted price of service was $450+ tax and shop fees. Even being generous that's a $175 markup on copper spark plugs."

That just doesn't make sense.

Usually rear seats are really easy to take out. Including older Mercedes.

Getting to the fuel pump from inside the car is great for folks like me! Usually if the car is designed that way there's a hatch-plate bolted on that you remove to get to the fuel pump(s). 

Last time I did this was on an old C series Mercedes. Took my time so I didn't mess anything up, only took me 30 minutes to remove the seats and the hatch."

The TL;DR is that cooked bones are brittle and splinter, regardless of cooking method.

As far as raw diet and bones go, either grind the bones up if for nutrition, or if recreational use the general rule of thumb bone size = pupper snout/head size.

That last part is where you are kind of right. Raw chicken bones **will not** break or splinter as easily as cooked chicken bones, but they are still a choking hazard due to size.

I have larger doggos and use raw beef marrow bones. The strong bones stand up to chewing, and don't splinter. They are dishwasher safe to sterilize them after they get dirty. Plus you can put peanut butter/treat of choice in the hollow marrow channel!"
news,fc7bp6s,t1_fc6y4o3,1577502798.0,"Am lawyer.

Depends on the state, but really all you need is:

- False imprisonment (unlawful confinement of a person without their consent)
- and either moving or concealing/hiding said person

Like I said, some state statutes are more particular, or allow for other factors.

Example, in TN false imprisonment which exposes the victim to substantial risk of bodily harm is per se kidnapping. So in TN confinement with a firearm is kidnapping, even without concealing or moving the victim."

I just bought my 2016 scat pack. 

I have also owned a 2013 Charger R/T for almost 5 years.

I find the Charger to be a great daily. It is fast enough to get out of it's own way, and has tons of V-8 torque. I'd call it quick, not crazy fast. I've driven a Challenger with the 5.7 and the 8 speed auto. It's pretty quick.

The scat pack is **FAST**. Crazy fast. 

It all depends on your priorities and what is powerful to you. 

If your driving history is mostly NA 4 cylinders, either one will feel like a rocket. If you are used to high boost or performance engines, then the 6.4 is what'll feel like a rocket.

A good way to liven up the 5.7 is to get a manual. It's not faster than the auto, but any car feels more lively with a stick.

Honestly, can't go wrong either way. I love the 5.7 and the 6.4"
