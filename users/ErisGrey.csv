How African countries are based on the resources the British and Western Europe could exploit. That much of the turmoil and unrest today across Africa is because countries have competing people confined, while also confined from their own culture across the western defined borders that split the African Tribal lands.   


Taking into our home country. I understand how slavery caused multi-generational loss of wealth. I know about Jim Crow era laws. I know about white people refusing to let sale groceries to black people. Being forced to buy from small Asian shops that opened as the intermediary. I know about Interment Camps that were used to steal the wealth back that Asians made off of being the intermediary between Whites and Blacks.   


I know about [Tulsa's 'Black Wall Street'](https://www.history.com/news/black-wall-street-tulsa-race-massacre). Where prior slaves and 1st generation free blacks made a fortune. When Black Wall Street started to outperform Wall Street, White Racists leveled all the homes and stole everything they could.   


I know about the wealthy black neighborhood in Philadelphia that was [firebombed by the police](https://i.imgur.com/j3qhQk9.png) in 1985. These were people that used all the money they've raised in the 1-2 generations since freed from slavery to invest in a nice property (The American Dream). Simply to have it all destroyed because a political adversary may have been in one of the houses.   


I know that Blacks and Hispanics were hit hardest by the Great Recession. Losing more than 50% of their generational wealth.

Making the argument that she's retired and thus not in the public eye, I would argue that with her publicizing her new HULU series where she makes the same statements again against Tulsi would take away her ""private citizen"" stance.

A private citizen usually can't make statements through commercially endorsed corporate broadcasts. And seeing as she's making these claims from her position of authority, ie listing her titles prior to these statements, I think it really does stop any Private Citizen complaint argument.

I'm retired military, but as a military person, having a secretary of state say that I'm a Russian asset would not only hurt my further promotion abilities, it would also limit the work I would qualify for with foreign dignitaries.

I believe the case has merit, but don't see Tulsi winning substantially.

Every Fraternal Order of Police endorsement for President has also been conservative/republican. 

The Leading liberal/democrat is currently running with the ""Justice and Safety for All"" belief instead of ""Law and Order"". 
He is: 

1) Drafting a ""Prisoners Bill of Rights""

2) Ban Facial recognition software by PD's, and create actual community oversight boards to evaluate use of force.

3) Prevent PD's from responding to calls of service for: mental health emergencies, homelessness, maintenance violations, and other low-level situations (They want mental health workers and social workers to respond to non-violent, non-risky situations.)

4) End the War on Drugs by legalizing marijuana and expunging past convictions

5) Treat children who interact with the justice system as children

6) Reverse the criminalization of addiction

7) Cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration by abolishing the death penalty, three strikes laws, and mandatory minimum sentences, as well as expanding the use of alternatives to detention

8) Ensure due process and right to counsel by vastly increasing funding for public defenders and creating a federal formula to ensure populations have a minimum number of public defenders to meet their needs.

9) End for-profit greed in our criminal justice system, top to bottom by: by banning for-profit prisons and detention centers, ending cash bail, and making prison and jail communications, re-entry, diversion and treatment programs fee-free.

He also plans to cut Police significantly since other departments and programs will be handling a lot of their work. It also seems wrong to have non-proportional budgets between public prosecution and public defense. 

The leading conservative/republican wants to end investigating police brutality. His Criminal justice plan was to let cops do what they want to do.

Bakersfield,fet6zf5,t1_fepk7wb,1579372356.0,"80% to China is what 2 of the almond farms advertised as their export to China when I was touring their grows. That is just what they said, but didn't have any paperwork to back it up. In early 2018 China was [already purchasing 70% of Kern's almond supply](https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/investigations/kerns-massive-almond-industry-faces-uncertain-future). They then ordered a few million more pounds, but [tariffs hurt the sales at the last minute](https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article214459579.html). 
With California as a whole exporting 80% of the almonds overseas, and Kern County specifically has more Chinese trade partners than other farms. So 80% directly to China is within the realm of reason and I had no reason to doubt their numbers. 

After 2017 China became the number 1 world importer of Almonds. Specifically because almonds like Mediterranean Climate and lots of water, Kern's almonds are more desired. Each almond consumes 1 gallon of water. With 225,000 acres of Almond crops, you can understand the amount of water Almonds consume is astronomical. 

Combine that with permanent water conservation bills created a few years ago,  [SB 606 by Sen. Robert Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) and AB 1668 by Assemblywoman Laura Friedman (D-Glendale)], to help Californian's understand the importance of our scarce water resources. California's are allotted 55 gallons/day/person. 

The Almond Harvest a couple months ago brought in [2.2 Billion pounds of Almonds](https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9140576/kern-county-ca-is-world-leader-in-almond-production/). 1 Pound of Almonds takes ~280 gallons of water to grow (1 gallon per almond, 280 almond on average per pound). The last actual certain numbers we have is 70% on China directly. That gave Kern County 1.54 Billion Pounds of Almonds exported to China alone. At 280 gallons of water per pound, thats 431,200,000,000 gallons of water we lose to China every year in Almonds alone. 

If China won't use their water to grow Almonds because it's too precious, I find it wrong that our farmers use our water, while we are in water restrictions, purely for profit. The amount of water Kern County Exports to China each year is 24x the annual allotment of water that all Kern residents are permitted to use combined. 

This isn't for food for us, this isn't growing medicine, this is purely to grow a snack that currently is the largest fad in China, using our scarce resources to provide for a country we are in a Tariff war with at the cost of our residents. 

Oh yeah, and they need European bees to be pollinated which cause havoc on our local ecology."

Bakersfield,feoyykb,t3_eq8lug,1579308435.0,"I would love to hear how they contribute to a balanced ecosystem. Most environmental studies show that the honeybees in agriculture save farmers billions, but at the cost of native species. 

Wildflowers have disappeared around Kern County because the honeybees from agriculture disrupt our [native bee populations](https://www.insidescience.org/news/how-bees-you-know-are-killing-bees-you-don%E2%80%99t). Farmed bees have the advantage of a strong colony when we get our wildflower blooms. This enables them to out-compete with our native bees, causing the colonies to have collapsed long ago. The flowers that the European bees don't pollinate have essentially gone extinct. 

[National Geographic did a big Q & A](https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2018/01/29/honeybees-help-farmers-but-they-dont-help-the-environment/) on how disruptive the honey bee populations are. 

The National Academy of Science Engineering and Medicine lists Agricultural Honeybees as the number one cause of pollination decline. 

The evidence inspired WIRED to do an article on it in 2015. Titled [You're Worrying About the Wrong Bees](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/youre-worrying-wrong-bees/). 

The National Library of Medicine Journal of insects 2016, showed the complications with measuring the impact of an invasive species that's been around for 400 years. 

> For 13 species, there are potential negative impacts, but no potential positive impacts recorded in the literature, and, conversely, there are 11 species for which only potential positives are recorded. Thus, for more than two thirds of the non-native bee species distributed around the world, we have no empirical evidence of any impact of their introduction. This is not equivalent to evidence for the absence of an impact, though such evidence would be less likely to be published [65]. Moreover, it is more difficult to obtain evidence for some impacts than others. For example, it is easier to demonstrate that a non-native bee can pollinate an invasive weed than to show it competes with native bees, as the former can be directly measurable (Figure 1).

The Sierra Club noted last year that 25% of our Native Bees are near extinction since 2005, and half of our native species declined significantly. [Some Native species](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/could-wildfires-benefit-bees-pollinators-native) are starting to rebuild in the areas devastated by wild fires. However, those areas are being quickly converted into more agriculture. 

[California Invasive Plant Council](https://www.cal-ipc.org/resources/library/publications/ipcw/cwip/) notes the problems we face with habitat restoration as the honeybees prefer to pollinate invasive plant species.  

>Other plant invasions may be promoted by introduced animals as well. For example, honeybees boost seed production of invaders whose flowers they favor (Barthell pers. comm.)

So why do we promote Honey Bees? Cost! They work for free! 

>Hand Pollination

>To hand pollinate apple trees, it takes 175 USD worth of pollen/ha, and the number of man days for hand pollination (at five seconds per flower) per hectare are about 120 days(Allsopp et al.). Accordingly, the total cost of pollen and labor in the U.S. would be 5715-7135 USD/ha. The fruit set will only change a negligible amount.

>In the United States, there are about 379,000 acres, or 153,375 ha of apple orchards nation wide. From the costs above, we will lose more than 38,458,731 USD annually by pollen dusting, along with more than 70 percent of fruits. With hand dusting, the cost will be more than 876,538,125 USD annually, which could be free if bees are kept alive.

Bees can be replaced with hand pollination that would produce higher quality fruit, save the local habitat, and even give us better air quality. But it will make the farmer employ someone to do that work, and when the goal of your farm is to automate as much as possible to increase profit, an extra employee is the last thing you want to add. 

So understand these informational days from the farms about how great the bees are for us, understand it is PR. 

If it sounds like I'm bias, I am. I volunteer with habitat restoration around Kern County. I also fully automated my greenhouses to cut down on labor I need to pay. Also, with[ Amazon's Deep Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/), I've been able to automate far more than I ever thought possible. 

I make sure my plants are hand pollinated though."

Many thought that growing up before and after computers would be the generational cultural change. But within a few years of the computers connected everywhere the internet was introduced. Life before the internet was vastly different than life after internet. This was a major cultural shift, where people started to visit with strangers online.

When I was young, we had things called Chat Lines. You would connect to a group line on the phone (50 cents per minute), where there would be dozens of strangers just talking about anything and everything. You can see how much of a shift the internet brought from that perspective.

Followed by Cell phones. Suddenly you can be contacted anywhere at anytime. The term disconnect, changed. It became a verb that the person would do for themselves, as everything else was always connected.

Then Sept 11, 2001 happened. We went to war, Patriot Act was Passed, over patriotism was popular. Strangers were marked as ""scary"" and you never know when you will be at the mercy of a terrorist attack. (At least how it was portrayed in the news.)

All these things combined, there was no one true cultural shift. There was a mass migration, explosion of shifts and behaviors instead of just one major one. Without any other way to describe it, they called the generation remembering and experiencing all those changes millenials."

During droughts the droughts are more severe and the days hotter. The significant change between wet and dry years are amplified by climate change.  The recent wet years, the same ones that brought the state out of drought, cause the explosive growth of the fuel woods. The redwoods are much much slower growing, and don't take advantage of the wet years like the eucalyptus does."
Natureisbrutal,fcz1hy2,t1_fcz08wt,1578091783.0,"To start off, that's partly where volunteer efforts come in. One day we will harvest wild seeds from a nearby section of forest that didn't burn. We raise the plants in a greenhouse for a few years until they are healthy enough to survive outside in the harsher area. While the plants are growing up in the greenhouse, we're out cycling soil where we are told the new plants would have the best chances for survival. It's a big part of forest restoration that's a lot of work but worth it in the end. 

Different intensity of fires. Previously, we would have lower heat vegetation burns. But the fires have been getting gradually hotter. The hottest fires burn where there is enough low brush, high energy fuel wood, and natural forests. It's those areas that create the trifecta of trouble. Once it's hot enough to ignite the fire resistant trees, you then have a recipe for a mega fire. Not all forest fires reach mega fire proportions that prevent anything from growing back. But we're finding about 1 a year now.

We also have 33 million acres of forest. We had two mega fires in 2018 with a severe loss of 1/30th of our forest that year. With about 6-10 years to restore the sections severely burned it puts us at a real risk of losing all our forests at this rate. Thus why its a problem."
Natureisbrutal,fcyo5bd,t1_fcyla0w,1578083710.0,"There's extensive operations to remove them. Free logging if you can do it safely. I would go and look for special burls for woodworking projects. I had to have a specially certified electric chainsaw to cut in the area as well.   


It comes down to size and money. We opened it up for commercial logging to try and save money, but the commercial loggers cut down the larger, healthier trees that were more fire resistant. Leaving the sick, dead, and smaller trees that actually cause the issues with our fires in the first place.   


[The ideal solution is called mechanical thinning.](https://calmatters.org/environment/2018/08/california-forest-management-fires/) It runs about $1400 per acre to do it. Puts the cost of thinning just over $46 billion. On top of that, ownership of the forests is split between private, state, and federal governments.   


The current use of controlled fires aren't as accurate in removing the trees we want removed. But do great for removing dead/sick trees and ground clutter. The ash also leaves nutrients that allow new unwanted saplings to sprout quickly. At a costs of $150 an acre it is much more cost effective. To do controlled burns on all our forests will still cost just under $5 billion. 

The $200 million that was allocated at the end of 2018 just isn't enough."
Natureisbrutal,fcy7m3u,t1_fcxqao9,1578075908.0,"Yes the redwoods have evolved to be mostly fireproof, and would grow in densities of 50-70 trees per acre, not 500-1000 per acre of trees their are now. It limits the intensity of the fires, limits fuel, and keeps the canopy out of the reach of the fire. 

However, commercial logging has brought in many invasive species across California. The Blue Gum Eucalyptus (The native trees burning in Australia right now) was planted specifically for firewood and fuel. It grows fast, burns really hot, and likes to grow next to redwoods. 

Those trees has been noted as the fire starter trees that were the first to ignite with many forest fires dating back to 1920. Unfortunately now are forests are over saturated with fuel wood right next to our heat tolerant plants. 

The redwoods were able to survive fires because of the hollowing of their bodies, their specialized bark, the canopy 100's of feet off the forest floor, and the area their roots take up to tell other trees to stay back. 

All those protections have been minimized since we increased commercial logging and brought in invasive fuel trees that destroy every protection the redwood has.

If you are wondering why it's hitting us so much harder now. The eucalyptus isn't tolerate to drought. So they propagate and grow when the wet seasons come in, when the drought arrives they become kindling. And we happened to significantly increase our planting of Eucalyptus in the 80's.

Natureisbrutal,fcy4owv,t1_fcx143u,1578074731.0,"California wildfires have grown more severe because of climate change. I've lived in the fire zones for decades. I can tell you the last 8-10 years the fires have been noticeably worse. Most the wild fires were centered around Diablo Canyon and the other notable fire canyons mostly away from people. 

Now the fires are destroying whole towns (ie Paradise, California). Major fires have started at locations such as the 405 freeway in downtown LA. Something unheard of a decade ago. 

I volunteer for forest restoration. Some misconceptions that should be cleared, high severity fires, which we are experiencing today, burn so hot they crystalize the soil. In these areas, the soil chemistry is changed and can no longer absorb rainfall. Which prevents the growth of new trees, and increases mudslides. 

I've came across sections of forest that burned so hot, they disappeared completely. Leaving nothing behind to even have a chance to reseed, the soil black glass that just crunches as you look out over a field that used to be forest. Seeing the damage from a mega fire for the first time hit me hard.

Historically, our forests have contained 50 - 70 trees per acre, and today our forests have more than 500 - 1,000 trees per acre – increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfire. This increase in density comes from invasive wood species that aren't tolerant to fire, and produce the mega fires that California is starting to become accustomed too. The forests grew more crowded and shade tolerant trees filled the understory, providing ladder fuels for today's crown fires, that jump to the crown of the trees and quickly spread.

The Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018 burned more than 459,000 acres, the largest complex fire in the state’s history. 

The two single – largest recorded wilfires in California have occurred in the last two seasons, the Ranch Fire - 282, 479 acres and the Thomas Fire – 281, 893 acres.

Two of California's most damaging and destructive wildfires in state history were the Camp Fire (2018) and the Tubbs fire (2017) which accounted for over 20 deaths and over 20,000 structures burned.

The Christian Historian Eusebius (260 AD - 339 AD) believed that the Biblical Enoch was Atlas from Atlantis. King Atlas (of Mauretania) mapped the stars before he mapped the world. [Eusebius concluded that Enoch was the Babylonian word from Atlas.](https://imgur.com/kWHqqs7) Based on the history of other ancient civilizations (ancient from Eusebius perspective) who were similarly taught astrology by the legendary mariner. 

Diodorus Siculus (Greek Historian 90 BCE - 30 BCE) also came to the same conclusion that it was King Atlas who taught all those around the Mediterranean astrology to navigate the oceans. His [Library of History](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/home.html) explained the rise and fall of many civilizations. He even tells of how the Atlanteans were ""too"" civilized and surrendered the city of Cernê (as well as a few others) when they were faced with the acts of rape and plunder. 

>After the death of Hyperion,29 the myth relates, the kingdom was divided among the sons of Uranus, the most renowned of whom were Atlas and Cronus. Of these sons Atlas received as his part the regions on the coast of the ocean, and he not only gave the name of Atlantians to his peoples but likewise called the greatest mountain in the land Atlas. 2 They also say that he perfected the science of astrology and was the first to publish to mankind the doctrine of the sphere;30 and it was for this reason that the idea was held that the entire heavens were supported upon the shoulders of Atlas, the myth darkly hinting in this way at his discovery and description of the sphere. There were born to him a number of sons, one of whom was distinguished above the others for his piety, justice to his subjects, and love of mankind, his name being Hesperus. 3 This king, having once climbed to the peak of Mount Atlas, was suddenly snatched away by mighty winds while he was making his observations of the stars, and never was seen again; and because of the virtuous life he had lived and their pity for his sad fate the multitudes accorded to him immortal honours and called the brightest31 of the stars of heaven after him.

The issue comes when separating mythology from history. His Biblioteca Historica was heavily researched while in the Great Library of Alexandria. Where all ships were required to surrender any documents for copy and archive. From his perspective the History was to the best of his ability truthful and accurate. That's where we get more details of the smaller city states that also claimed to be descended from Atlantis. 

Diodorus believed King Atlas of Atlantis was simply a man who achieved monumental success in his life. And that him directly being the child to Uranus/Poseidon was created by the people who interacted with him. That he was humble with his knowledge, extremely devout in his temple, and said his talents and knowledge were a gift from Poseidon because he was a true son of the sea. 

According to Diodorus many ancient Mediterranean civilizations tell of a visitor who traded knowledge of navigating by stars and how to construct boats made of local reed to navigate the flood basins easier. They also taught them how to find their city to come trade with them. There is no word in the texts of what the explorers boat was made out of. Simply that they held about 20 people, and there was an army of boats that protected the Temple of Poseidon. 


I just think it's fundamentally important to differentiate advanced ancient technology vs advanced technology. Being the first civilization with boats 12000 years ago was impressive. There is a significant chance that when Plato read of royal army of boats, he imagined frigates and galleons. Given the time frame that Atlantis existed, an army of reed canoes would have been equally advanced (and scary) technology. Considering the ringed islands were separate by a couple miles of water between each ring, (mirrored in the Richat Structure), it would be quite difficult to get to the center fresh water island without a boat. 

At a time when the Sahara was flooded, being the first to build boats would be incredibly advanced. If your society did, the Richat Structure would be the ideal location to create a city. It was on the edge of the flooded sahara and atlantic ocean. The Richat Structure was created by sequential volcanic uplifting/flow eruptions leaving the plains near the Richat Structure some of the most fertile in the region when it was getting rain. 

We KNOW there was an ancient civilization that doesn't exist anymore that taught celestial navigation and boat making to the people of the Mediterranean. The part that made Atlantis mythical was that something was still able to destroy a civilization so advanced in a single day and night.

The actual text from Plato

>"" The records speak of a vast power that your city once brought to a halt in its insolent march against the whole of [**Europe**](https://www.ancient.eu/europe/) and Asia at once - a power that sprang forth from beyond, from the Atlantic Ocean. For at that time this ocean was passable, since it had an island in it in the front of the strait that you people say you call the ‘Pillars of [**Hercules**](https://www.ancient.eu/hercules/).’ \[Strait of Gibraltar\] This island was larger than Libya and Asia \[for the Greeks at that time Asia was the [**Nile**](https://www.ancient.eu/nile/) to the Hellespont\] combined, and it provided passage to the other islands for people who travelled in those days. From those islands one could then travel to the entire continent on the other side, which surrounds that real sea beyond. Everything here inside the strait we’re talking about seems nothing but a harbour with a narrow entrance, whereas that really is an ocean out there and the land that embraces it all the way around truly deserves to be called a continent. Now on this Isle of Atlantis a great and marvellous royal power established itself, and ruled not the whole island, but many of the other islands and parts of the continent as well. What’s more, their rule extended even inside the strait, over Libya as far as Egypt, and over Europe as far as Tyrrhenia \[central Italy\]. Now one day this power gathered all of itself together, and set out to enslave all of the territory inside the strait, including your region and ours, in one fell swoop. Then it was, Solon, that your city’s might shone bright with excellence and strength, for all humankind to see. Preeminent among all others in the nobility of her spirit and in her use of all the arts of [**war**](https://www.ancient.eu/war/) she first rose to the leadership of the Greek cause. Later, forced to stand alone, deserted by her allies, she reached a point of extreme peril. Nevertheless, she overcame the invaders and erected her monument of victory. She prevented the enslavement of those not yet enslaved, and generously freed all the rest of us who lived within the boundaries of Hercules. Sometime later excessively violent earthquakes and floods occurred, and after the onset of an unbearable day and a night, your entire warrior force sank below the earth all at once, and the Isle of Atlantis likewise sank below the sea and disappeared. That is how the ocean in that region has come to be even now unnavigable and unexplorable, obstructed as it is by a layer of mud at a shallow depth. The residue of the island as it settled. (*Timaeus*, 24e-25e, transl. D.J.Zeyl)   ""

No point does he say it is imaginary, or simply a philosophical thought project. Plato said this massive country that pooled their resources were almost able to take over the world. Their Kingdom started on the Western edge of Africa, and extended all over the Mediterranean. Founding king was named Atlas the first son of the sea.

The Western part of Ancient Africa was known as Mauretania (currently called Mauritania). Unforunately, Mauritania is one of the last places you want to visit. Very desolate stretches of Sahara desert mixed with civil and religious wars. 2.5x the size of California, with a population smaller than LA city condensed into 4 cities. Interesting enough, their history is that of sailors who traversed the whole world until their [King Atlas settled the area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania).

\> [King Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Atlas) was a legendary king of Mauretania credited with the invention of the celestial globe.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania#cite_note-12)

Other important details.

>Plato (c.424–328 B.C.) describes it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a night and a day, into the ocean around 9,600 B.C.

The dates and location of Atlantis put us in the Sahara desert around 10,500 years ago. Similarily, [at that time there was a historical flooding event that drowned the Sahara.](https://www.livescience.com/4180-sahara-desert-lush-populated.html) It was filled with waterways, rivers and canals that are hard to imagine. There was so much water in the desert around King Atlas of Maurentania, [that today the largest fossil water deposit is located under the area](https://steemitimages.com/DQmd7UpXKzVQsEuyhu7qZsJCVxTS7jzpTVN414WFgyxb6QB/1.png).

Lake Potelemy existed at this time in this area. It was a lake so massive, it was larger than the Great Lake Eerie. [Over 30,000 Sq Kilometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ptolemy). You can see the aquifers from the ancient waters that once covered the sahara during the time Atlantis supposedly existed.

At the same time Atlantis sank below the sea, records show the massive lakes in the area flooded from the massive increase in rains and drained into the Atlantic Ocean. We don't know if it was an earthquake, natural erosion, volcanic eruption, landslide,  or an extreme flood event during the flooding epoch, but there was a major event that caused a flooding followed by mudslide of proportions it would be hard to imagine. Many human settlement that popped up West of the Nile in the Sahara disappeared and their cities buried. (It's the same flood event that spawned the myth of Noah's Ark in the same area.)

The interesting part is one of the areas affected the great event fits the [description of Atlantis](https://i.imgur.com/ssz5n8y.jpg). It's an area just South of a Mountain range, that has sequential ringed islands (they are islands far larger than what can be worked by hand), where the main center island has fresh water spring that gives both hot and cold fresh water. The fresh water was fed from the mountains into underground aquifers where it was heated by the volcanic activity and rises to the surface. It is just South the Pillars of Hercules. 200 miles from the ocean in the Sahara desert. Known as the [Eye of the Sahara](https://www.usgs.gov/news/landsat-sees-eye-sahara). A very [pretty view from space](https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mg22730333.700-1_800.jpg?width=800), but not nearly as [impressive when standing on the mountains](https://i.imgur.com/TiHre5l.png). Happens to be the area that King Atlas of Mauritania settled. Hit by a massive flood event that the mountains channeled over the structure stripping everything away.

It fits almost every aspect of the story of Atlantis. They share the same history of sea of faring, Atlantis had a king who was the first son of the Sea Poseidon, Mauritania's founding King Atlas created the first world map from sailing. The flood event that hit the Mediterranean, corresponds with the sinking of Atlantis to within 2.8% the time frame of the great flooding event that hit the area. The Richat structure which matches the physical description would not be navigable during Plato's time. He heard tale while reading the archives of Egypt, and civilization that was known to be the most advanced at its time, but their texts talk about Atlantis as their heritage being even more advanced. The city was said to be a symbol of protection (Mountain range), power (Military fleet in the ring to protect the temple and the people) and health (The fertile plains and rich waterway for food).

[The Egyptian Eye of Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus), is the Symbol of Protection, Royal Power and Health. The earliest known written mathematics use the [eye as a unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus). As if there was a real world physical object that was the basis of their math and looked like the Eye of Horus.

Main problems are that the Richat Structure 200 miles landlocked from the ocean in the sahara desert, and at an elevation of 400 ft. I'm sure a combination of the flooding event and higher ocean levels during the time can explain a lot of it."
FanTheories,fckq8j6,t1_fckocpz,1577730838.0,"The history of actual Egypt states their pharaohs were a decedents of one of the 12 great gods.

Plato believed it was real as well as many others.  The Atlantis from Myth with tech more advanced then us isn't real. 

The same contemporaries that believed the Atlantis city was just a thought problem created by Plato,  made the same claims of Angkor Wat,  Troy, and Heracleion. 

The black haired Irish, and the Egyptians were the only locations with historical text of being decendents of Alantis that survived. They also have a lot of overlapping genetics recently discovered which brought back more researchers on the Atlantis front. 

It wouldn't be any more advanced than Alexandria, but the time and size of the city are more important."
