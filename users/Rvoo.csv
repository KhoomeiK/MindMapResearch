teenagers,fcwkea9,t3_ejaj0s,1578028039.0,Well to manage school stress try and have a really solid routine to ensure you get everything you need done. Also grades are not everything and as long as you arent completely bombing that class and are still learning something from it you're fine. This is what I do in attempt to manage that stress and I hope it helps you out.
