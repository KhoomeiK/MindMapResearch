Tips are taxed, everything you report to your company will be logged and provided to you on your W2. Tips are just the same as wages earned. 

If you decide to under report your tips, there’s two things to “worry” about. The first is your company, they won’t be happy if they find out. The second is the IRS. Even if you don’t earn the money on paper, the tips you made should still be taxed as income. 

If you do decide to take advantage of your company, chances are you won’t track extra tips. If you don’t report them, it is tax fraud. Most likely not a material amount, so it will have a very low chance of ever being caught. 

If you do keep track of your unreported tips, you can add them to your tax return. This would relieve your issues with the if you worry about that. If you don’t want to keep track, you could estimate, but it’ll most likely be a slightly inaccurate number. Again, not a material amount, and you acted in good faith. IRS won’t go looking for money or anything from you. 

If you report your unreported tips, your company would never know. Unless you told them of course. If for some reason you got questioned, just say you did some side work for people or something."
