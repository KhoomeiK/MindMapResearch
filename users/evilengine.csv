In Lucas' 9-movie plan the sixth film would focus almost entirely on saving Han from Jabba, and whilst Jabba was the one pulling the strings, it was Fett they would have to defeat. Hence why they gave him a ton of extra weapons and gadgets (which he didn't use much of). If you watch that costume prototype video you can see how excited every one is. Ah, if only."

rpg,fcosq9w,t1_fcopakt,1577840521.0,"very rarely do player deaths occur that don't compliment the story in our games. Once or twice a player wanted to change characters, so killing off their original was a handy way of swapping. 
The only death I recall that was, shall we say, at the player's fault was in a Mass Effect setting. The player wasn't very familiar with the M.E. games, and when his Asari was being called names by police, he wouldn't drop it, kept trying to pick a fight, unaware that bigotry and racism is kind of a staple of the series. We kept trying to talk the player out of it, but he wouldn't listen, resulting in his Asari getting smulched by the police officer's space-bazooka. It happens, and I am always prepared for the inevitability of a PC death. I just didn't realize how unprepared I really was. I've played him for literal years, and even that felt too soon."
rpg,fcn49d9,t1_fcmyhku,1577802844.0,"that's sweet of you to say. I don't really consider myself a particularly good RPer, all too often I'm kinda stuck not saying anything or without much to contribute to a lot of situations. One or two of our party are the social ones who always jump straight in with the right thing to say, meanwhile I'm normally stood at the back letting the scene continue. I figure if I joined in my character wouldn't leave a good impression and would more than likely mess it all up, so I usually take the backseat. Come to think of it, I don't think any of my characters have been charisma based or in a leadership role (not counting a cleric character, whose social position didn't mean anything if they weren't involved in his religion... so most people). 

But thanks again, I do try, but as a shy person it's difficult to know what to do or say."

rpg,fcmvrjl,t1_fcmuw0u,1577794532.0,"it's kinda funny, I've never been in a game where characters were considered 'disposable'. I've steered clear of D&D which can be pretty ruthless with little to no second chances, and I've never even played Call of Cthulhu, which characters can be killed or rendered unplayable at the drop of the hat. I'm a complete stranger to that kind of gameplay.

Our GM is pretty fair when it comes to fights and dying and such. To me he's the kinda guy who would happily fudge a roll so the story fairs better. His attitude is the story trumps rolls, like saying Star Wars wouldn't be a good story if the Millennium Falcon got shot down immediately after blasting off from Tatooine cause ""that's how the dice rolled"".

I think reality just hit me pretty hard, considering the character in question I had planned on killing at the end of his initial campaign (self sacrifice, redeem himself, save his friends, all that nice stuff) but we actually fought the final boss of that campaign very very efficiently, meaning no sacrifice was actually necessary. This left him a little aimless afterwards since I hadn't considered what he'd do now it was over, until this current campaign kicked off and he had a reason to adventure again. Just a pity he never saw it to the end. Hell, his best friend in the campaign wasn't around, so there's inevitably going to be that awkward moment when he comes back and asks ""where is he...?"" and everyone has to say what happened to my guy. 

Thanks for your input, it's always interesting hearing different perspectives on these things. Cheers!"

A lot of games I've been playing lately are old or just plain not intensive enough to keep it going, meaning I've got two games running at once to keep the damn thing quiet."
