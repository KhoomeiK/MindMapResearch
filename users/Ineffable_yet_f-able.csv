BudgetAudiophile,fe459oj,t1_fe3l7hv,1578855926.0,"It's a very nice budget system. Up next, however, you should think about the room configuration, speaker placement, and acoustic treatment. Having the right channel in a corner next to a window at the point of first reflection isn't doing you any favors. The left channel is also pretty boxed in. In the meantime, use the room correction microphone and software that came with the AVR (won't help with records tho).

TV should be at eye level in the viewing position (it's a bit high), though TV positioning isn't too bad as these things go. Some people hang them up like paintings, which is just stupid. After that I'd consider looking for a good deal on an external amplifier with a 12v trigger to power the L and R channels, using the pre-outs on the AVR.

Just regular enlisted people in an extremely tense situation expecting airstrikes, which would probably be very destructive to their personal well-being. In a very tense, high-stakes situation mistakes are going to happen. This time it was them. Maybe next time it's us. This is, in general, why good leaders try and pursue stable relations, even with adversaries. Mistakes happen and can quickly spiral out of control. We played our part in this.

This has afforded me a bit of a *time lapse* perspective. I'm currently having as much fun in Eve as I've ever had. I love this game. Overall, you guys have done a great job. The game has vastly improved in just about every regard since I began. Yet I understand why you guys are in a challenge. The game is like 17 years old. Bitter vets complain about everything and are so far removed from newbdom that they cannot empathize with the new player experience and tend to belittle it. Personally, I appreciate what you guys are doing to try and make Eve more approachable for new players. I wear some Eve swag (hats and shirts) that are often conversation starters---except the conversations don't take long because while everybody has heard of Eve they're all too afraid to try it. There is so much potential out there. I dearly hope more and more people from different parts of the world come to join this grand adventure.

In terms of my own experience, I miss battleships. They just don't seem to have much of a role right now. Now that they aren't the biggest, baddest things around they're just too slow to roam with. They don't seem to have any strategic or tactical function (with the exception of BLOPS). This probably gets into the proliferation of caps and supercaps. I remember when ASCN released their propaganda video showing off the very first Titan in the game. It was incredible. I was in awe. ASCN had achieved something nobody else had at that time. It was an enormous investment in an asset that was supposed to produce strategic value. Now I see videos of people dropping Titans on gate rats. I'm not suggesting getting rid of them, but their role should be reduced somehow to sovereignty contests. Battleships should be the deadly, mainline ships that large fleets are built around, requiring a mix of smaller, faster, ships for support. Obviously, there should still be a role for light, fast fleets of cruisers, dessies, and frigs with their only kind of goals. Instead, cruisers do battleship damage. Capitals have awesome power and hardly move. I guess battleships are too slow to compete with cruisers that can control the distance and too weak to overcome them anyways, as HAW dreads do. 

Mostly, however, the game is amazing. Trigs are super cool. Markets and industry are super fun. PI is super fun. Roaming fleets are less blobby and more fleety, with fleet composition and maneuver mattering more. Even mining is fun. 

Oh, and I'm still a hold out waiting for an implementation of *walking-in-stations* that allows meaningful interactions with other players. DUST514 was dope. Stop coming out with cool shit and then abandoning it because vets complain about everything."
