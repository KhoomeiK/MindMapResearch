The writing, music and cinematography of dark is superior to me in every way (especially S2), even with their tiny budget compared to stranger things. They explore time in a way no other show has done before, subvert many cliche tropes and only having 3 seasons planned overall means they have a clear ending planned so I am really quite confident that it will go down as one of the best television series of all time (at least in the science fiction category)"

DarK,fbz3nah,t1_fbyzg6r,1577234087.0,"S1 was really good. Season 2 was so rehashed and unoriginal with the most boring and deus ex machina type ending ever. Oh look 11 uses her powers again, levitates a bit and it's over. 3 was a step up but still way below the bar S1 set.

Dark season 2 is better than any of the shows on this list. There are contenders like the first few seasons of black mirror, narcos, house of cards etc. But nothing really compares imo to the second season of dark."
DarK,fbz29iq,t1_fbyzclm,1577232909.0,Stranger things season 1 was really very good. But 2 and 3 were very average. Dark aside I don't know how anyone can still consider stranger things as good as it's first season. Different opinions though I guess
Coachella,fbx7qb8,t1_fbx7ljg,1577173106.0,"Calm down BTS fan guy I was simply asking and other replies have already given me some context. I don't listen to kpop so I legitimately had no idea. I've heard of blackpink and BTS and that's all. Yeah now I understand that BTS is the biggest.

So do you think they will do coachella? I think they will make far more money doing another world tour rather than going to coachella correct?"
Coachella,fbwxwhp,t1_fbwxn4w,1577162451.0,It seems like a very frank thing to do to see the news articles and then drop out solely because of them haha. Fingers crossed but yeah I'm having doubts
Coachella,fbwxfyw,t1_fbwx33f,1577162068.0,"Yeah good point. Well I don't mind if they come along, just don't replace frank and for the love of God frank be confirmed and don't flake pls. Stupid sexy frank"
Coachella,fbwwrhr,t1_fbwvxap,1577161523.0,"Well like you said their US tours sold out within seconds so I don't think they need the exposure. If anything it would be for the significance of coachella itself. 

Being able to say I performed at coachella is a pretty damn amazing accomplishment, especially for a non English performing band. I guess we'll just have to wait and see"
Coachella,fbwwjf8,t1_fbww2jb,1577161355.0,"Yeah I guess being able to say they performed at coachella is far more significant than money to a band as successful like them. Pretty nice notch to have under their belt. 

I don't mind if they came, just don't replace frank and for the love of God frank please don't do what you normally do you elusive and unpredictable cunt"
Coachella,fbwvqad,t1_fbwvcy6,1577160716.0,I assume the revenue they bring in from their own tours would be at least 5x more than what coachella could offer them. Maybe they could make a guest appearance or something for a couple of Mil but it doesn't make sense for them to headline when they can make that much money on their own
Coachella,fbwvicp,t1_fbwuwz5,1577160544.0,"I just googled the question and the general consensus is that being 7 members + the revenue they pool in means they're way too expensive for coachella to book. If they had their own tour in April, they'd make 5x the amount they'd get paid for by coachella easily. Plus they've had enough scandals and coachella is a hub of those so another reason. 

I'm a massive fan of frank ocean and I really want to see him live at least once in my life. But I'd love for there to be a 4th headliner because with Travis Scott it doesn't really seem coachella standard (especially with people like Beyonce performing in the past)"
Coachella,fbwuvm6,t1_fbwud1p,1577160069.0,"So if they were to perform at coachella would they get headliner slots? Theres no denying how big they are but I can only assume they don't have the same audience in USA as they would in Asian countries. Maybe someone just below headliner (undercard? Not sure what those acts are called). But then again would they accept that being as big as they are?

If they're confirmed headliner over Frank ocean I would be devastated haha. I've been wanting to see Frank ocean live since he cancelled one of his only 3 shows in Australia back in 2011.

Ive seen so many artists and bands across different genres. I've seen most headliners over the past decade at concerts. Pls God just give me frank"
Coachella,fbwugxy,t1_fbwty8y,1577159759.0,"Is BTS really big in the USA? Blackpink and perfume(?) are quite huge too but they weren't headliners. Maybe because kpop doesn't attract as many Americans as it would Koreans/other Asian countries?

Or is BTS just like miles above both of those?"
