It was my first job ever, and while I’d honestly never go back (my managers were pigs, we had far too many regulars who often got handsy, and good lord was I tired of paying for pantyhose every time they ran) I learned a lot and wouldn’t have changed a thing."

plants,feny81d,t3_eq5rtx,1579292587.0,"One of my best friends gifted me a pot of hyacinths last year for Easter. At the time, I was eagerly trying to grow a couple other plants from seeds- lavender, a tomato plant, and some peppers. All failed, partly because I was overconfident in what I was doing and am pretty sure I did something wrong, and partly because we got heavy rain while out of town and my pots became flooded. A few months later, my fiancé was going through our gardening stuff and found what looked like onions- we literally had no idea that they were in fact the bulbs from my hyacinth until we did a little research. Figured, why not, it says they can rebloom, so let’s give it a shot.

MurderedByWords,felgaom,t3_epqong,1579221491.0,"I don’t tend to be super vocal on the internet when it comes to politics; it can turn volatile real quick and that’s not something I enjoy being a part of. 

That being said. I know I’m clearly not the first to notice, because people literally talk about it all the time, but I am 100% baffled how Trump gets away talking the way he does on social media. And I’m not even talking about the worst of the worst, I’m talking about posts like this. I get that our way of communicating is ever evolving, even more so in the last 15 years or so, and it’s important to be open in terms of adapting. But this is ridiculous. Regular folks get fired all the time for way less; saying something stupid about your boss on Twitter, accidentally posting a photo of you shitfaced while wearing a shirt with your company’s logo. It’s become the norm for employers to expect a certain degree of professionalism from their employees, even on social media. 

So that’s where my issue lies. This dude is our president. He has the social media presence of an entitled, whiny teenager who was never taught the importance of caps lock and is convinced the world revolves around him. 

Not to mention, his insistence on nicknames- “Crooked Hilary”, “Crazy Bernie”, “Shifty Schiff”, “Wacky Omarosa”, “Al Frankenstein”, etc. That’s the shit that makes me cringe the most, because it fucking reads like Dr. Seuss if he wrote a book about a fluffy orange schoolyard bully except again, it’s not, and that’s our president behaving like a goddamn crazy person. And there’s people out there who not only find it acceptable, but embrace it. It’s crazy times y’all. Welcome to Idiocracy, Terry Crews tried to warn us."

It’s weird, because I’m not a sweets person at all- I’ll pass on your cakes and cookies and chocolate but when it comes to beer, I can drink the rich and sweet darker beers all day. My top favorite styles are all very sort of in your face- boozy stouts, hoppy citrus forward IPAs, spice heavy Belgians. That being said, you can’t go wrong with a lighter session ale from time to time, especially on a hot summer day."
AskReddit,fel7pa0,t1_fej2u2h,1579215851.0,"Oh yeah, love the founders too! I used to manage/run a bottle shop and always had first pick of all the new stuff coming in; that was an awesome time. Dragons Milk did a vanilla chai version and that was incredible; another favorite is Stone’s Xocoveza. I also really enjoy a good IPA/double IPA, and loooove a well done Belgian dubbel/tripel/quad."

depressed,feijrio,t3_epa6ce,1579140145.0,"I know exactly how you feel. After my sophomore year, my mom found out my stepdad was cheating on her (actually knocked up his secretary, and split). My mom became incredibly depressed and we had to move a county over, because we could no longer afford where we lived. After getting my younger brother and sister enrolled in middle school and elementary school, respectively, I just...didn’t. I can’t remember if it was my decision, or my mom’s, or if it just kind of happened. Those were some rough years. My mom worked third shift as a nurse, and slept during the day- I took over getting my siblings to and from school, helping with homework, making meals, and basically taking care of the home. My mom was depressed, and it didn’t take long for me to follow. My old friends constantly reached out; I was a pretty popular kid in high school, and regularly competed in pageants and had high hopes for my future. I was overcome with embarrassment about my situation, and told my friends I was homeschooled and made excuses to not hang out. I retreated entirely, and overall it was a pretty dark time for our family. 


That being said, while it took a few years, things DID get better. I got my GED when I was 22, and thanks to studying hard, passed in the higher percentiles. Soon after I got my first job at Hooters- zero shame. It helped me gain some semblance of financial freedom and I moved out shortly thereafter. Since then my life has changed a lot- spent several years working at a local brewery, and helped open and manage our town’s first bottle shop. My mom is doing amazingly and has become my biggest cheerleader, I got engaged last year to my best friend, and while my life looks nothing like what 17 year old me initially envisioned for 32 year old me, I couldn’t be more content. I still struggle with depression, but am working towards finding a therapist, because the most important thing I’ve learned is that your mental health is crucial to your well being. In the meantime, I surround myself with people I love and who love me. 


I’m so sorry you’re in the situation you are. I know how bleak it can feel, and never feel like your feelings aren’t valid because of your age. Take things day by day, and set short term goals. It’s easy to be discouraged and can be incredibly overwhelming when looking at the bigger picture. Please don’t hesitate to pm me if you ever need someone to talk to. You’ve got this."
cats,fei8wox,t1_fei6h56,1579132904.0,"Haha I noticed! Eight kitties! Between my fiancé and I we’ve got three rowdy kitties and a hyper chiweenie in a very small house- prob for the best, if the house was any bigger I’d make plenty of excuses to keep more!"
cats,fei3g63,t1_fehzylc,1579129432.0,Aww they seem so sweet! I’m sure they’ll find their home soon with such lovely personalities. The first time I fostered I gave in and kept him- my fluffy ornery Kaiser. It’s hard not to keep every single one. Thanks for making these cuties comfortable and happy. :)
happy,fei091a,t1_fehkfa8,1579127479.0,"No, I don’t think my teeth were rotting. And unfortunately I’m not alone in my experience, as I’ve referenced in my other comments; down to the fact my mom wasn’t even allowed to go back with me, which was awful in and of itself. 

There’s also [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/mKMiWbI) if you’d like to take a peek. So yeah, I believe the dentist did the work for a reason, but not necessarily because it was in my best interest. 

Also, the last time I attempted to get checked out, my dentist was lovely and warm and understanding. I didn’t go back because the anxiety was overwhelming and that’s currently on me, as I’m well into adulthood; however, the trauma is real and I think I’ll always have it to some degree. 


I’m trying to be civil, and this is the last I’ll speak on it, but I do think it’s awful to outright accuse my mother of neglect and not even consider the evidence I’ve provided. But that’s that I spose."
happy,fehhpw7,t1_fehh0tp,1579116767.0,"So you’re blaming my mom for going along with what the dentist recommended? Cool. Cool cool cool.


Edit: You’re right about one thing- kids shouldn’t need multiple root canals, crowns, etc. That’s exactly my point. They were needlessly done because a dentist my mom should have trusted told her they were necessary. Just like the kids in the article I referenced. Go tell Jazmin she had 11 root canals (done in a single visit, mind you) or Hunter, who had 16, that it’s their parents fault."
happy,fehgpqa,t1_fehe106,1579116180.0,"I really don’t know how to respond without sounding catty, but that’s rude as hell.

The article I referenced confirming my suspicions that this sort of shit happens, a lot? 

I wasn’t perfect, because what kid is, but you better bet my mom ensured I took extra good care of my teeth because I was terrified of sitting through another three hour procedure, another one the dentist assured her was necessary."

AmItheAsshole,fegj879,t1_fegd88l,1579094444.0,"Agreed. Someone else mentioned how babies pee and poo overnight in their sleep a lot, and this is true. I took care of my nephew when he was an infant, and if he finally went down and was sleeping heavy, I wouldn’t wake him to change what MIGHT be a soiled diaper (cause nine times outta ten he’d be up in a couple hours anyway).

However, the moment a baby’s up and moving around, with a clearly dirty diaper, who in their right mind just looks at it and think, “eh, I think I’ll just let ‘em sit in it”. 

Beyond disgusting. Not to mention how the parents, NOT the OP, are essentially sexualizing their two year old. NTA OP, and unfortunately I wouldn’t watch her for them again."

I get massive anxiety to the point where I’m borderline panic attack, and I blame my childhood dentist; several root canals, crowns, and spacers all on baby teeth that fell out soon after. Every time I went I was in there for hours, and one time while pulling a front baby tooth I cried- he slammed the door, put his hand over my mouth, and told me “we don’t cry in here”.  Truly awful."

Are all six identical? Like what you’d find today in a manufactured set? If so, then it’s even weirder there’s no marking identifying them as such, but if not, it very well could be that someone made them. Even then it’s strange that they wouldn’t sign their work.

To reiterate what others have said- make sure she’s got mace/pepper spray she can carry if it’s legal in y’all’s area. And maybe have her download one of those tracking apps she can activate while in transit- I’ve used one in the past when I had to walk to and from work in the dark and it made me feel so much safer. 


I’m honestly so sorry she has to deal with that. As women I feel like we deal with creeps pretty regularly, and far too often it reaches this level. It’s one of the worst feelings in the world to feel unsafe simply going about your daily business."

trashy,fc5h2jf,t1_fc5gvht,1577457392.0,I agree it’s messed up. No wonder the poor kitty had issues after the fact. I hate he had to go through all that but I’m glad it brought him to us.
trashy,fc5cm35,t1_fc3arp6,1577453390.0,"My fiancé adopted a cat about two years before we got together. He was a little older and owner surrendered, because he just so happened to begin having pee issues not long after they declawed him. 

It’s been a bit of a struggle to socialize him with my two kitties I brought when I moved in (and he does still have accidents from time to time) but I couldn’t imagine him not being around. I love our fuzzy little boy and it breaks my heart thinking about how scared & confused he must have been after being surrendered."
AmItheAsshole,fc4kgex,t3_eg5c4x,1577419290.0,"NTA. Please don’t get rid of your babies. They’ve been with you for a decade and are completely innocent in all this. My fiancé has a cat he adopted before we got together, who had been surrendered by his family, and the poor kitty had issues because of it. We love him to death though and it breaks my heart to think of how confused he had to have been at first. 

Also, I’d take a good long look at this fiancé of yours. His reasoning is ridiculous, especially considering the cats are nothing new."
