fatlogic,fcisduv,t1_fccq61j,1577668684.0,"Another couple of things: 

People with eating disorders consider their problems as being shameful. My friends know I have an eating disorder but it’s still hard for me to talk about with them because I’m ashamed to have these issues. I can’t say the word “purge” even to my best friend who’s known for years that I’m like this. Other people have no problem with eating, why can’t I just get over it? 

Eating disorders are often complimented with depression, anxiety, and self harm. I have suffered with all of those. 

Recovery from eating disorders takes years and everyone relapses a few times. A lot of people still show the mental symptoms years after they recover physically, some never really recover.

We are really good at hiding our disordered eating. I have had an eating disorder for 4 years (I’m 17 now) and my family has no clue."
2meirl4meirl,fcgy690,t1_fcgvqkb,1577645238.0,I stopped taking mine without permission because I read the warnings and it said don’t take if bulimic and I kind of struggle with that but I didn’t want to tell my doctor

If you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to ask. I don’t get offended over legitimate questions, no matter how personal or blunt. This is an account I made specifically to talk about eating disorders so AMA"
fatlogic,fccfoxy,t1_fcbvlhk,1577597858.0,"Not op but- There’s a crash course on YouTube that goes over the medical side and the body dysmorphia. Basically for a lot of people it’s coping mechanism to deal with things they can’t control.  Then calories is all they can think about and numbers is all that matters. Eating is just so anxiety inducing and they can’t do anything without worrying if there will be food, what’s in the food, how they can avoid it, when they can work out. There have been times that I ate something and could not calm down enough to sleep until I walk 3 hours to burn off the calories, it was 3AM. If I stopped walking then I would panic, I’m worthless, I’m pathetic, I’m stupid, this is why my mom hates me, why do I even inconvenience people with my existence, no one even likes me in the first place, why do I bother? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. 

I got my eating disorder mainly because because i have abusive parents and was bullied as a child, so I thought if I lost weight then maybe my mom would like me more. Trauma is a huge component a lot of the time. There’s also a genetic factor, and a desire for control.

I’m only worth anything when I’m empty. It’s fucked because when I started, hunger felt euphoric. I loved being hungry. But as it grew into an addiction it feels bad but eating feels even worse. Some people keep some of the good feeling though, there’s something special about feeling small and light, I could either feel like absolute shit or like I could do anything.

Also note that a lot of people get eating disorders around puberty. So a lot of young people have suffered from an eating disorder when they were supposed to be forming their identity, they don’t know who they would be without the disorder.  Imagine giving up what you feel is the only thing that makes you, you. 

You should know that I’m not anorexic, I am mainly bulimic but have gone days without food and restricted calories to an extreme, kept it up for a year or so before changing to bulimia.

[Empty (a song) by a former anorexic  ](https://youtu.be/36QMyiRAv-Y) 

The BTS for that song is good too. It shows a bunch of string circles that shows the difference between how big the singer was vs how big she thought she was (due to body dysmorphia)

fuckeatingdisorders,fcba9sj,t3_egsd7f,1577584402.0,"I’m 17, here’s my list so far

Stole laxatives from my 73 y/o gramma (sorry gramma)

Stole a whole bottle of diet pills from my mom (she never asked for them back and I was like 15, you would think if your diet pills go missing and you have a 15 year old daughter then you should ask for them back so she doesn’t die or something)

Fingerless purged with the door open so my mom would see me and I would get out of doing my homework that day. It worked

My cat once knocked over a picture frame that was holding a drawing my friend gave me, and I used the broken glass to cut myself. My friend never would have wanted that

Stealing caffeine pills 

Making tea in English class (my teacher loves me so she gives permission) so I wouldn’t eat lunch. Bonus: her grand daughter is currently in treatment for anorexia and she is so scared for her, meanwhile I still don’t eat

Being so stressed because my teacher’s granddaughter was almost dying from anorexia that I didn’t eat for two days

When a friend was talking to me within those two days I did something small wrong and felt guilty plus all the stress from the previously mentioned incident that I started crying and had to skip class for the day to stop

Lying to my friend and making a scene at a lunch table because she wanted me to eat. 

Not bringing money for lunch but the same friend wanted me to eat so she gave me money so I could buy food I didn’t even want

Buying binge food with my dad’s money and purging it

Purging in a school bathroom after a class party

Using my super tiny friend as thinspo

Using my 275 pound friend as reverse thinspo

Accidentally introducing that friend to the proana movement (she ate 700 calories for one day and gave up)

Ghosted an “Ana buddy” when I was 14 (I contacted her this year to apologize)

And probably more"
EDanonymemes,fcb682p,t1_fcawbg3,1577582894.0,"Yeh fam, but you would think telling a bunch of dumb teenagers to make sure they don’t drink 5 more calories than needed is a bit weird. And we don’t get caffeine at school. Any normal sugary drink has to be 0 calories and caffeine free before being put in my school’s vending machines

Edit: Actually I take it back, they got rid of diet sodas in the vending machines and all we have now is diet sports drink"
