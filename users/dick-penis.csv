keto,ff795jj,t3_ersmoy,1579643638.0,"Confused. Help! 

I have been on keto for 3 months now. I am still showing ketones in my tests. What is the deal? 

I also have not lost any more weight in the last 6 weeks.  My macros are all fine.  I literally eat the same thing every single day and intermittent fast. 

Lunch
Bag of spinach
Handful of cherry tomatoes
Half a cucumber
2 cheese sticks
Small cup of ranch 

Dinner
Pack of thin chicken breast (less than a pound) covered in cheese
Cup of broccoli cooked with butter. 

All I drink is water and black coffee. 

I bike 8 miles a day on an stationary bike. 

I started at 220 and I have been at 205 for 6 weeks. 

That is all I eat. If I have to eat less than that then I will just be fat haha."
