offmychest,fez2peh,t1_fez19ir,1579453307.0,"Well, if I was in your situation, I'd try to get as much out of it as I could. The stuff I mentioned about self improvement isn't just stuff that comes naturally. For me, I had to do legitimate research into clothing, skincare, exercise, psychology, socialization and romance to actually figure out how I could improve. So, maybe you can use a small amount of the time that you're stuck indoors on researching and figuring out ways that you can feel more comfortable in your own body. If you spend all of your time doing this, you might end up frustrating at a lack of progress. During the time when you can leave you house, I'd probably spend it at a coffee shop during cold weather, and a park during warm weather, just do I could get some air and be reminded about how big the world actually is."
offmychest,feyjn0p,t3_eqx8et,1579446390.0,"death is the exact opposite of freedom. you'd be condemning yourself to an eternity of nothingness. true freedom is much closer to just being free from the judging of others. its extremely, extremely difficult, but its default possibilities to work towards. I'm absolutely hideous, and I have a shit tier body and personality, but I've been able to work towards better self confidence by finding a style that compliments the few aspects of my body that I do like, by working out, and by trying to shift my perspective a little bit, and have a more open personality. It's not easy, but the outcome is certainly worth it, and its infinitely better than death"

I'm diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (now reclassified as HFA)  and it's a lot more than just having a hard time socially. I have to think of every single word that comes out of my mouth. I have a very, very hard time articulating what I need in real life. The people who self diagnose are absolute jokes, and they're typically the ones who say ""HUR DUR AUTISM IS A SUPERPOWER"""

Anyways, you seem like a really interesting person! I think that if you were to find the right people, you'd easily be able to gain a ton of relationships with people that you find stimulating to interact with. Those who I choose to interact with in real life are the ones who I cannot predict or fully understand.

offmychest,fdjevb9,t3_elnflq,1578467870.0,"This is extremely interesting. Have you ever gotten your IQ tested? I presume that if your mind is capable of consistently predicting the actions of the people around you to a high degree of precision, you must be extraordinarily intelligent. I completely get the part about not being able to relate to people because of an ability like this. I have a photographic memory, as well as the innate ability to do extremely complex math quickly and accurately just using mental visualization, and the combined of those two things makes the people around me see me as a brain on legs. They only talk to me if they need help solving a problem, or if they doubt my abilities. Its really isolating when I already know the motive behind most of the interpersonal relationships I have. I also have an extremely easy time figuring out a person's possible actions, as well as a myriad of other personal details just from sheer calculation and deductive reasoning, but I've intentionally taught myself how to do this. You must be leagues smarter than me if you just innately figured out how to do this, and my IQ is 5 points from Einstein's. Granted, I am only 15 years old."

Trump aggravated a country that's known to be aggressive, and also pissed off every country in the E.U., Russia, and China, since his actions could have resulted in the usage of nuclear weapons in retaliation.

She hasn't responded to anything I've said in the past 2 days, and it's making me feel like shit.

TrueOffMyChest,fc7uwnz,t1_fc7hcva,1577519272.0,"The way that your entire comment chain is written  reeks of you trying to defend your stance on a disability being a legitimate superpower. I have autism as well. I have an IQ of 155. This does not mean, in any way, shape, or form, that I am superior to any average human being. It's not like people on the spectrum have abilities that inconvenience their everyday life, but have some ridiculous use case in which they're unparalleled. It's more akin to people who are high functioning on the spectrum being predisposed to certain traits due to their disorder. Psychopaths are predisposed to be extremely good at lying. Does that mean Ted Bundy was superhuman? No, it really doesn't. I have met people who, in practice, are leagues smarter than me, but who say that I'm smarter than them because I have near perfect factual recall, and because I have a high, meaningless number on a piece of paper. Autism is not a superpower. It is a disability. You have diluted yourself to believe that you're superhuman because of a disability. By no means am I saying that people who are on the spectrum are inferior to normal people, though.

I know from firsthand experience. I live with an individual who is nonverbal. I believe it to be extra strange that we teach both have the dialogue of ASD. I believe that having there be a distinction between people like me, who would've been diagnosed as Asperger's Syndrome 10 years ago, between people who are High Functioning, but who don't have the characterized Asperger's traits , as well as people who are low functioning, and those who are nonverbal. The ""spectrum"" is a poorly designed model. People who have Asperger have different symptoms than those with HFA, as well as every other sub diagnosises compared to one another. Also, autism is FAR from a superpower when it comes to functioning in society. Sure, I can memorize entire pages of books, and I have a number on a piece of paper that's high enough for me to be classified as a ""genius"", but I literally can't talk to the person working the register at the Wawa down the street, and I cant even read basic social cues."
offmychest,fc7sblc,t3_egnkav,1577517381.0,"I understand exactly how hopeless it can all feel. I understand how it gets so bad to where you feel like you can't function without drugs or liquor. I've been there. I've lived through multiple suicide attempts, and I know how it all felt for me. The hopelessness, the loneliness, the apathy, the frustration. It seems like it can't get better, at all. It seems like your world is engulfed by a massive, looming dark cloud, with no end in sight. I've been there. A year ago, I tried to drink myself to death, and it didn't work. Therapy didn't work. Abusing drugs didnt work.Being depressed, even for extremely long periods of time, does not mean that have never and will never be happy. It means that you haven't had a chemical in your brain that makes you feel happy. You forget how being happy feels. You feel like you've never known happiness. I know how bad it feels in the short term, but in the long term, things can change. My mentality when I was getting better was something along the lines of ""fuck it, I've never been happy, might as well stick around long enough to figure how being happy feels"". I dont know if this will work for you, but I know that you CAN get better. It's not about how hard you try to get better.
