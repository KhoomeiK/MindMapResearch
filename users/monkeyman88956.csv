""Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with someone and how you resolved it."" It'd be great if that story came from a work environment, because it's easier for me to relate to. But maybe that conflict was who did what work on a group project for class. That's okay. Explain it clearly to me. 

""Tell me about a time when you had a difficult problem to overcome, how did you do it?"" Again you may have more examples from interniships. But it may be that time when your car broke down before a big test. What happened, how did you overcome, how did you prepare for that in the future, those are the things I'm listening for.

Maybe the interviewer asked about something that you don't have experience in. If you can come up with a relevant story that gets to the topic, ask first. ""I don't have a good example of a disagreement with a co-worker, but I have a good story about a time I disagreed with someone on an opposing intramural team, would that be okay?""

Even worse short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income.

If you open an IRA, the money isn't taxed until you withdraw the funds in retirement. If you use a Roth IRA the taxes are taken when you earn the money before it's invested. Then any gains can be withdrawn in retirement tax free.

No one can tell you what your goals should be, but they can help you figure out if a BS in Bio degree is a good path to get you there. If your only goal is to have a college degree, then anything in the sciences is going to be a hard path to get there. If your goal is to go to med school, then a Bio degree is a reasonable path, but your GPA is probably low to get into med school. If your goal is to eventually work in medical research bio might be a good path. From the friends I have, a Bio degree was not their last step in education (pharmacy, medicine, physical therapy, hospital adminstration).

If you have no long term goal then I don't see how you can make a decision about changing majors. And it's okay for your goals to change overtime. You might say medicine is my goal, but as you progress maybe that is out of reach, but physical therapy is doable. One friend with Bio went to pharmacy (PharmD), decided he didn't like it as much. He is going to law school and because of his law school has multiple offers working in product liability law, especially in pharmaceuticals. Doesn't matter what your goal is, but you need something to work towards."
