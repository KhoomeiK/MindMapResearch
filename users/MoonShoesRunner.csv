SuicideWatch,fdxauq5,t1_fdx4bpb,1578766979.0,"So I just looked at your profile and that person who had a problem with you leaving the country so soon is wack.

And have a house with guest rooms so yall can fly out and hug me.

SuicideWatch,fdx6y4u,t3_en96dp,1578765941.0,"I feel this way too. It hits me especially hard while I'm at work and I feel this dread about what feels like the vast expanse of soul-sucking bullshit in front of me. So I've decided to say fuck it. Fuck peoples/societies expectations. I'm dropping out of college, and I'm going to work and hoard my money until I can move farrrrrrr the fuck away and hopefully start some form of alternative work that fulfills me and isnt 9-5. And since I came so close to killing myself I feel like I've kinda cut the strings to caring about anything else besides the things that do make me happy. Even if I cant have those things all right now, trying to be consistently happy is the ONLY thing I'm working toward. Its liberating"

I'll DM my snap and we can be friends and if you need a hug I gotchu ü§ó (p.s. the fiance lives 3,000 miles away so if you think ""there's no way shed come hug me"" you bet your ass I'll make my best effort to. Like bro I came so close to dying that now I dont care if shits crazy I'm doing it) okay so yeah hmu fellow sadbois"
