>I honestly believe women don't realize how hard it is to be confident

Women have the same issues. We're not an entirely different species; in fact, women suffer from depression and anxiety more often than men do. Women get it. By thinking your struggles are yours alone and no woman could possibly understand it, you're going to push away any woman who might have been willing to stick around. Because no one wants to hear 'you're a girl so you don't get it!'; that's sexist trash on top of your mental illness being a mental drain.  

You sound like you need a therapist and to learn to deal with yourself first before you can really find a partner who's going to be able to support you in the bad times.

badwomensanatomy,fei16fw,t1_fei0pth,1579128039.0,"That would depend on their preference. Just like with every other human alive they get to choose their gender and pronoun. As far as I am aware, most identify as either male or female but some identify purely as intersex. 

They are generally assigned a gender at birth. Most continue to live with that gender but some transition to the opposite gender because they think the doctor was wrong. 

Because you seem to understand intersex as something different, this is all a good reason not to be a jerk to trans people though. Use the pronouns they want and don't be rude. You never know if that person is intersex or not."
badwomensanatomy,fehywlx,t1_fehx7ky,1579126668.0,"Hermaphrodite is not a term applied to humans outside of porn usually. It's generally seen as a slur if you call a human that without them saying they want to be called that. 

It's rather rare for an intersex person to be born with both genitals fully developed. Among those, most are infertile and there are none who produce sperm. Some do have functional wombs and produce eggs though. Which means they are fertile women born with fully developed penises. 

No human can produce both eggs and sperm even if intersex since you require either enough estrogen or enough testosterone to be fertile. You can't produce both in that quantity."
badwomensanatomy,fehwo9p,t1_fehapqy,1579125353.0,"Intersex is a thing. They are born with both sets of genitals, that means a penis too just in case you don't understand. While most commonly an intersex person is infertile, those who are fertile have all had functional wombs. 

I could go look up the variations of intersex and tell you specifically which one it is, but I get the feeling you don't actually care or find this stuff interesting. You're more likely just being a bigot."

badwomensanatomy,fehucf7,t1_fehtqdw,1579124031.0,"1. It's not always consistently monthly for many women. Especially for teenagers and college age girls where the cycle is more likely to be erratic. 

2. That just means that women have even more chances to have close calls. Which just makes the comparison still play in the man's favor but is an attempt to help you understand what it would be like. 

You can stop responding. I'm not forcing you to."
badwomensanatomy,feht2x1,t1_fehsie9,1579123320.0,Everything in this sub is automatically marked NSFW. I would guess because so often this sub is NSFW and people were refusing to tag it so this was easier than doing it by hand.
badwomensanatomy,fehqtqf,t1_fehoxdn,1579122041.0,It's fucking golden that he's responded and said he has IBS and has had close calls. He literally understands the comparison but refuses to believe it's at all similar to a period. That is some head-ass level of denial.
badwomensanatomy,fehqrxc,t1_fehp5f2,1579122012.0,"The close call you had? That's exactly why this comparison is being made. Because you nearly shit yourself and the only reason it was only 'close' is because you either found a toilet nearby (with free toilet paper most likely) or you managed to make it home and shit in your own toilet before shitting your car. Were such conveniences available for feminine hygiene products, they would also be more likely to only have 'close calls' instead of bleeding through their pants. 

This is as close as born men are going to get to the experience of an unexpected period starting. And that's why it's being used as a comparison. 

If you lack the capacity to understand how comparisons work then there is indeed an idiot here, but it's not who you seem to think it is."
badwomensanatomy,feho2xs,t1_fehnwqn,1579120460.0,I see the phrase 'unexpected diarrhea' means nothing to you. You must have a very wonderful digestive and immune system if you've never had an emergency stomach upset.

badwomensanatomy,fehndj5,t1_feh79sk,1579120053.0,"This seems proof you aren't a woman or have never stuffed a kleenex in your panties. 

Your thighs rubbing together while walking alone would shred the kleenex into a disgusting mess before you throw in that you're leaking blood and only the lightest period in history would be contained by a kleenex in the first place. At least suggest something more heavy duty like a few paper towels layered together. 

Source: Tried to line my panties with tissue paper once as a teenager. Less than 10 minutes later the tissues were a bloody, shredded mess, stuck to my skin and pubes, and my panties were bloody."
fatlogic,feheyro,t3_ep2d6m,1579115157.0,"My clothes last longer now that I'm not fat. I don't wear out pants every 3 months because of chub rub. 

Plus, there's a limit to how small I want to be. There was no limit to how big I was going to get if I hadn't taken control. Buying clothes that fit lighter me was the end game. I will only ever have to buy that size now. Had I kept ballooning I'd have had to buy new bigger clothes constantly, on top of the replacement from wear and tear happening faster. 

It's cheaper to be thinner."

badwomensanatomy,fehagwc,t1_feh4lmg,1579112526.0,"We bought a used car. We were told everything was functional. 

The gas gauge said it had a full tank when we got it. It never changed. Oh shit, we realized it wasn't working. We had no idea how much gas was actually in the tank when we got it. We ran out of gas; it likely had less than a quarter of a tank when we bought it. 

We knew the gauge was broken after that, of course, but we still didn't know how far the car would go before running out. And as we were a bit strapped for cash we couldn't afford to just keep it always full so we did end up running out a few more times before figuring out the average mileage and using that as the fuel gauge."
badwomensanatomy,feh7x12,t1_feh7lu3,1579110995.0,Yeah. They weren't thinking ahead with that one. There was a pretty consistent problem with this behavior since a friend of mine bled through and was also sent back to class. She went all day with a hoodie tied around her waist to hide it.

badwomensanatomy,feh4rk6,t1_feh1n21,1579109126.0,"Back in high school, I knew my period had started before I left home. But it was apparently an ungodly heavy flow right off the bat which was super abnormal for me. I bled straight through my pad and a tampon a friend gave me all before lunch. Soaked my pants - my friend told me and it was humiliating but what really topped it was getting to the nurse, being given a pad and then her trying to send me back to class with bloody panties that couldn't stick a pad and visibly bloody pants!

I had to call my dad from the payphone in the school hallway and hide in the bathroom until he showed up to shout at everyone about it and then take me home for the day."
badwomensanatomy,feh3gnn,t1_feh17qy,1579108358.0,"Why do we have to find another comparison just because women also shit? That actually makes it the perfect comparison because it means women and men both know what this is like and that means women know if it is at all similar or not.

HunterXHunter,fee8s8r,t1_fee7i35,1579028750.0,"I wouldn't even put him on par with the mid-tier enhancers. He needs outside forces to keep from shattering his bones still because he struggles to control what he's doing (the girl on his back is the 100% full cowl, because her quirk erases him essentially killing himself with every attack). Controlling yourself is very first thing you learn for nen and he is just beginning to learn how to do it. 

If transferred into the hxh world, he was essentially gifted a hatsu before even learning what nen is and now consistently keeps ripping his own body apart trying to learn to use it. 

As it is, anyone with a hatsu in HxH would knock the girl off his back with some quick thinking and then chew him up and spit him out (assuming he didn't just demolish himself with the first attack). 

When he gets control of the quirk properly things could be different, but they're also now adding all new quirks to the original quirk so he's going to be an entirely different thing all together anyway."

This concept was abandoned a couple chapters in and has never reappeared. Deku had to be given a legitimate epiphany that legs can be used for kicking instead of constantly shattering every bone in his arms to punch stuff really really hard with little to no planning or strategizing. Deku is not a smart boy."
