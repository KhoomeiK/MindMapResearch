You said that not everyone who is in pain becomes a bully, but your sister clearly was not saying otherwise. She was trying to say that a lot of bullies are in pain and take it out on others. This just after having apologized for bullying someone - she's trying to make things right after acknowledging it was wrong of her. And let's be clear, apologizing to her victim was a big step that should be supported. Telling her that not everyone behaves the way she did was not relevant or useful, and was purely argumentative.

You said yourself that it takes you 1.5 hours on a bus to get where they are sold. I don't think laziness can really play into this one unless your sister has *way* more freedom than is probably legal to have at that age. You also say she's too stingy - does she have a similar income/allowance to you, and have you offered to let her give you the money to buy pretzels of her own? Talk to your mother about that idea and you might find she will take your side instead. All assumptions really, but worth a shot."
PoliticalHumor,ff9hzqi,t1_ff9gjq6,1579713429.0,"> What happened to ability to face one’s accuser? Who this man is relevant.  
  
He wasn't relevant. Everything he said had been corroborated before this point. This was not a trial, so there was no ""right"" to face him.  
  
> And please, “scare future whistleblowers”? So outing Monica Lewinsky was done to “scare future accusers”?  
  
No, but calling for this particular whistleblower's death because he's a traitor was. Funny how that one thing was ""secretly"" recorded and leaked. It's not like Trump has invoked his base's penchant for violence before.  
  
> Shouldn’t it be if Biden were engaged in corruption, that Trump’s investigation into him was warranted and not a political hit job for 2020?  
  
Nope, because it would have come up as a result of abuse of power. If a police officer breaks into someone's house who they don't like and starts snooping around, is it suddenly ok for them to have done that because they find some pot while in there? It doesn't fly. That police officer would be sued into the ground and lose their job. The Republicans in the House wanted the impeachment hearing to be flipped into a trial of Hunter Biden on the basis that if Biden was corrupt then it was ok for Trump to break the law to flex on Ukraine to announce an investigation. That is why the House democrats didn't allow it. That *would* have been political theater.  
  
What is really disappointing here though is that you believe abuse of power is not an impeachable offense."
PoliticalHumor,ff8kxdw,t1_ff87832,1579683470.0,"> Why do democrats need more witnesses if its a done deal that Trump is innocent?

If it is a done deal that Trump is innocent then there will be no harm having the witnesses called. It will show once and for all Trump did nothing wrong and this whole ""witch hunt"" won't be dragged out for a few more years with conspiracy theories. By preventing witnesses it only makes it look like a cover up and will keep this problem coming back again and again. The accused doesn't just get to say he's innocent and demand that a trial go away, that's not the way it works once it reaches this stage.  
  
>Why are they wanting to take their time with impeachment when they said it was urgent Trump be removed ASAP?  
  
Because the Republicans are trying to rush it through in a kangaroo court.  
  
>Why did they say this is something they did not want to do....while smiling and celebrating over it?  
  
Because they did what they were elected to do and understand that they can stand tall and proud with having been a thorn in the side of someone widely deemed to be corrupt.  
  
> Why wouldn’t they allow the Republicans to call their own witnesses in the House?  
  
The republicans were trying to out the whistleblower in an attempt to scare future whistleblowers into keeping quiet. It was a power move. They also tried to divert the hearings in the House into a trial of Hunter Biden - who was not relevant to the case at all.  
  
> Why is it the Republicans job to accommodate for the Democrats incompetence and rushing through the process?  
  
The House didn't rush it, they were rushed. The White House would not allow its aids to testify, and the House did its job anyway, showing reasonable evidence for impeachment."

He could have put it to you better, but you should *both* want him to be sure if there are any doubts. This is something that can nag at a person for years. It's one thing to trust someone, but you're talking about *a kid* and using two forms of birth control. Of course he's going to wonder. That the decision to abort was already made when he asked for the paternity test is what solidifies his status as an asshole. Actually, rereading it makes me think he hadn't been told about the abortion decision yet, so that be a YTA in that case.  
  
>So I told him since he didn't think it was his kid that meant his opinion on how to go forward was irrelevant.  
  
This makes you the asshole too, because that's not how this works. First, his request for a paternity test doesn't mean he doesn't think it's his kid. Second, it is overly immature and flippant with something as serious as a kid, even one that was to be aborted. And you made the right decision there because you were clearly not ready to have a family."
AskReddit,fdr3hru,t3_emqd57,1578678982.0,"Pepsi. When I was real young I used to help dad mow, rake, shovel and all that with toys. As soon as I was strong enough to use the real things I always looked forward to yard work. Back then, we would go every Saturday to my great grandma's house to cut the bushes and mow the lawn. I would cut the bushes in the back (there were a lot of them, it was like a secret garden with trails between huge shrubs, bushes and stuff) then go inside and sit on the porch talking to great grandma while dad mowed. Occasionally she would try to hand me a beer, even though I was like 8, but the other times it would always be a nice, cold bottle of pepsi. Mine was a low income family, and this was the only time I ever got pop as a kid really, so it was an extra special treat. Pepsi always reminds me of those days and that's why I still prefer it to coke 30 years later."

Saying that was probably a little assholish, but it's also a typical teenage retort, so you get a pass there.  
  
Your stepmom sounds like she's speaking more out of ignorance of your history than being an asshole. She may just be worried that you're still ""playing"" when you're getting to an age where you will need to start behaving more seriously soon.
