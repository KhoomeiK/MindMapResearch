IWantToLearn,ff5fmfl,t3_ero4fu,1579590758.0,"My friend and I were talking about this earlier today, actually. 

Giving unsolicited advice is a barrier to learning.

 The only way to help them is to wait for them to ask for your advice (and only give it when they ask), or, if you find the right moment, ask questions about their situation. Since I saw that you're talking about violins, ask them what they know/understand about the technique you're trying to impart. 

Maybe they know about the sweet trick you're trying to teach them, and they're not ready to learn it. Or, maybe they have all the info they need to put it together, minus one bit of knowledge. You won't know until you ask and get to know where they're coming from

Are you teaching them because they want to learn it, or because you want to show them that you know that trick?

I hope this applies to you! My friend and I were talking about disc golf :)"
creepyencounters,feebqb8,t1_feeb0tf,1579030477.0,"Totally! If you keep your red flags close by, the abuser can't get far. If they pull too many red flags, they have marked themselves as unsafe. I advise against 'cancel culture' in most situations, but at some point you're keeping someone dangerous around and they've canceled themselves."
creepyencounters,fee9u4n,t1_fed54uu,1579029368.0,"I've dealt with an abusive parent(emotional and verbal), but my mom was strong enough to get us away. 

Unfortunately, the stuff I've seen through a lot of stories points to a sick connection that was true for my situation, at least until my mom grew to the point of leaving. 

Abusers will pick a partner that they can control and manipulate. It's necessary for their lifestyle. They start small, weaving a story about how the things they do are necessary, or that the abused parties are wrong. They can often make a strong case, as they can be master manipulators. They warp reality to make other people 'sensitive', 'paranoid', or any sentiment other than correct. The worst abusers (or the best at it) always have a backup plan. 'If they don't believe X, then I've got to attack Y'.

Their partner becomes trapped living in a lie. To step out of the lie and into the real world is a huge paradigm shift, and it causes the abused and the abuser's partner a lot of horror. The abused have to come to terms with the fact that they've been lied to, that one of their loved ones has been causing them to live a lie, and at some point they also have to realize that it was intentional. 

This can be so horrifying that it's hard to deal with. The partner to the abused has a latent choice to make, and the abuser has (probably) made sure that the abused KNOWS how hard the road out will be. There will be anger to face, disappointment, the upset of 'normalcy', the idea of loneliness after. And with some abusers, a guarantee of violence.

Let's not blame the victims, as the partners of abusers are still victims. But at some point, there is negligence. OP's mom sounds like either a co-abuser or at the point of negligence. I can't say, because situations are complicated and I only have a few details.

Thank you, OP, for your bravery. I hope you do well from here on out. There are positive people in this world, and I want you to believe that. But abusers always throw off red flags eventually, and it's good to be acquainted with them to protect yourself. There are lists of the top ten red flags out there, abd I encourage everyone to know them. They got me out of an abusive relationship at one point, and have kept me out of them since. 

Much love, y'all. You deserve to be safe."
conspiracytheories,febwzxt,t1_febud0v,1578963681.0,"Let's not forget that no-ones path is linear, and that people learn things in a different order than your own. Knowledge is good, art is good.

conspiracytheories,fe9l4ql,t1_fe7l2ws,1578938953.0,"I guess I don't know where you're coming from. I pointed out a cool fact related to the topic, and you replied with 'random stuff happens, wow'. I know random stuff happens all the time. So whatever high horse you're on, go ahead and ride off. 

Nearly every single barcode has a 666 embedded in it, and that is not random. It would be if it only happened once in a while. That's not the case though.

Alternatively, random stuff DOES NOT happen, and everything is related and connected. Sychronicity abounds in this reality. That's why r/randonauts exists. That's why iChing readings actually match up with the question you pose. I've seen crazy synchronicity, while I'm paying attention. 

So maybe you should pay attention when you reply to old posts with snarky comments. What have I said that lines up with your present? You might need it soon."
atheism,fe1ldpn,t3_enh9yz,1578828021.0,"I know this post will probably be drowned out by more extremist ideas, but consider reading it any way.

Yes, religion and its followers do some bad things. And yeah, I've seen the posts disparaging this sub. People on this sub sometimes take atheism to mean 'us vs religion'. ALL of these examples are ways that each group gets misrepresented by a minority of its users. 

Don't believe that a few examples of anti-atheism creates the rule. Don't believe that all people of faith are out to get you. Don't believe that there is no hope for spiritual people to understand where you're coming from.

People get divided into groups, stereotype others (often incorrectly due to the narrative offered by the powers that be), and continue to be divided. Keep thinking, and keep representing your group well. Break down false narratives where you see them, and create new ones through new experiences. It's not the easy way, but it's the right way."
HighStrangeness,fe1ivcd,t1_fe1a6n0,1578826996.0,"Check out the double slit experiment. 

The short answer is: if a laser one photon wide were pointed at a double slit, which slit would it go through? You might expect, since light is thought to be a ray, that it would choose a slit and the projection on the wall behind it might have a two-slit pattern. But the truth is that light in that situation acts more like a wave. It causes a pattern of slits on the wall. When observing the slits that the light is supposedly choosing to go between, the photons act weird. The act of looking to see which slit it goes through seems to have an effect on the outcome, and the answer isn't as simple as 'it's going through the left or right'.

It's worth looking up. Hard to describe in shorthand. If you understand the new questions that arise from this experiment, you start to understand quantum mechanics as a concept."
psychology,fdqzm2u,t1_fdqy2hm,1578677458.0,"I've done some, and for me they don't usually have an out-of-body effect (I only became completely unaware of my body and self once. I had to nap on the couch until I 'came to').

 Connecting to nature has more to do with feeling trees and plants as being distinctly alive, moving, even present. One time in a large park, I felt like the ferns along the trail were active and friendly, whereas sober I've seen them my whole life as just scenery. Things have a tendency to move and glide when on those substances, despite our usual insistence that things are stationary. Imagine seeing a tree distinctly swaying in the breeze, and maybe even watching its bark move a bit. Is it me, the psychedelics, or is that just how they are normally?"
holofractal,fdmknpe,t1_fdm6x7u,1578553477.0,"I'm new to this sub, so correct me if I'm wrong; isn't the idea of r/holofractal that we may be living in a universe of light and sound that may have been programmed by higher beings or being? Not gatekeeping, asking in earnest. 

I'm open to the possibility of no 'God', but then my next best guess is that we, as an organism called humanity, create our reality within this system (the universe) using our combined energy. We see patterns bc we created these patterns? 

I'm just armchairing. What do you peeps think?"

Thetruthishere,fdkhbiw,t1_fdkfl6u,1578503878.0,"If the metaphor of the Bible speaks to you, good on ya. Like I said before, it holds a way to truth. But, some people have been scarred by the church, or have never been taught its ways. That doesn't mean that they haven't found a way to truth by other means, or that they haven't learned about a spiritual way to connect with God.

The idea that there is only one way to God (through faith in Jesus in the 'right' denomination) is a divisive tool. It has evolved from the old church, which claimed only priests could help one access the divine. That gave the church in the Euoropean world and beyond complete power over the people. Is that free will?

And as for the non-European tribes and societies? Is that part of our historic population just condemned to Hell? I say no. I say the Creator loves all, and provides for all. Even people not touched by Christianity throughout the ages have had the ability to call on the Divine and be right with themselves and God.

I do agree with your first point to an extent. We do live through our mistakes and we must learn from them."

Thetruthishere,fdj29mo,t1_fdhlyx0,1578456573.0,"I was devout for 16 years, and then I began to ask questions as I left Christianity. 

Does it make more sense that God became more loving over the years, or did the Church have to change to keep up with modern times? 

Does Christianity have THE answer, or are they just the most insistent?

Is it better for your local church to help your community grow locally, or is it better to convince third-world communities across the globe using your tithes?

I'm not arguing against being in a religion. With the right intent, communities are great. Positive people are hard to find sometimes. But if one realizes that churches divide more than bring together (hence all the different Christian faiths), they subjugate more than encourage (""a woman should submit to her husband"", used on my Mom with my abusive dad), and they support political parties based only on divisive issues (gender, abortion, etc.) instead of issues that effect everyone (worker's rights, war, health care)... Then I can't help but see a pattern of control.

A high-noon standoff. Two players start either face to face or back to back. The map is very small, and the only cover is hard cover; no bushes.
