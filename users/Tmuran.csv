But later in teenager years I just snapped; hard to explain on english the reasons  what happened and anyways: somewhat similar things later happened like what happened. The usual :alchohol, metal concerts, late mornings home etc. I dropped from 2 faculties by 25 and somewhere around this time by sheer amount of boredom i actually also stopped drinking. I spend 2 years playing games and watching youtube videos for 12-14 hours a day because i couldnt find a job(no working experience and also shitty croatia) and by 27 I said fuck it and moved to Ireland alone. So I was 27 alone in another country far away from my home without any work experience. I lied on my resume got job at shitty food factory standing and packing fruits whole day. Now here lies a catch. If you are smart and hard working person like you say you were, whatever you do in life you will show it for sure, and people will notice. In 4 years i went from general operative, to team leader, to category team leader in one factory, decided I dont like it there, went straight to different factory for a team leader and now waiting to apply for supervisor. Do i like it, absolutely NOT, but I am way better than i was almost 5 years ago and I'm currently trying to get into programming, all with still managing to waste time on reddit and playing guitar. My father said once to me: there are many options out there but JUST PICK ONE. I could still live in Croatia and think what to do with my life, but I chose to leave and it all just came down like lego bricks.

I just realized that my english is still pure garbage like before coming here but i try."

StopGaming,fffbsb3,t1_ffe6d35,1579880487.0,"I checked all of channels your mentioned, funhaus is one of those channels i would never watch because you can get a feeling that you are part of the team and that they are your friends but reality is just the opposite. Maybe I am wrong it just looks like one of those channels. LGR and NR seem fine, LGR actually looks really interesting. But at the end it's up to you if you think they gonna drag you back to gaming.  From my experience if you are serious about stopping gaming you are also gonna stop watching game related youtube channels and you gonna look back at them thinking what a waste of time."
StopGaming,ffdlb4v,t3_et0o2r,1579823301.0,Are you talking about comedy video channels ƒçike for wxample videodunkey or killeanexperience or lets players or any twitch channels. The point of quiting games is to get life back. Watching somebody else playing the game is no better its probably even worse because at least when you play games your brain is active. That is why i always tell my friends I dont care about watching ootball but i like playing football. As for watching comedy channels eh if you think they wont make you play games like before go for it. I still sometimes watch some random people like mandalorian or sseth but they release videos like once a month and its nice to see them talking about games i liked when i was younger.
books,ffdjhn5,t1_ffd1uwi,1579822186.0,Oh thank god Im not the only one. I tried to read couple couple of really popular self help books couple of years ago that my friend read but i just quit after 20-30 pages because it always just repeats itself.

I was in so much pain that i wanted to kill myself. I stopped eating for a week because i was so scared of the pain. I literaly cried every day. And it was only because my doctor told me to eat boiled vegetables to heal myself even tho it didnt do shit.  You know what help  me to became well; eating medium rare beef. So much for your vegetables. My friend is telling me to became vegetarian meanwhile her mother fucking died at 45 of pancreating cancer and she was vegetarian her whole life. Don't tell me meat causes cancer please, while you put corn syrup into everything that exist."
StopGaming,ffanjnk,t3_esfw8x,1579740130.0,The achivement for not playing game is having a life(if you dont watch twitch or youtube or whatever people do this days) You dont need an app saying you that.
getdisciplined,ffana6y,t3_esj4bp,1579739953.0,"While i dont agree with some of thw resolutions you made foe yourself mainly no meat and waking up at 6 oclock and nofap??!? Im not gonna judge. 
But I can tell you only this: you saw what happened when you deviate from the plan, so good news you now know better. I dont know what time is now in your country but you know the saying tomorrow is always a new day. So buckle up and try again. You only failed if you stop doing what you made yourself promised you gonna do. you just triped in the race you didnt fall down."
StopGaming,fewkfss,t3_eqloez,1579412609.0,"I have a friend who games like 1 or 2 hours a day max. Sometimes he doesnt game for weeks. But every couple of months he gets urge to play something for 8-10-12 hours for couple of days. Then we both laugh at him because he didnt sleep properly for a week. And then everything goes back to a normal. Is he addicted, ye probably not, he works hard as fuck to have a nice life and he needs those couple of days to behave like a teenager again to not go crazy."

Stop watching those shitty ""my life changed after waking up at 4 in the morning"" videos and then they show you people meditate and doing yoga or going for a jog, like you can't do that in 9 AM also."

What they gonna call you weak bitch ass faggot?

What you wrote doesn't make any sense. If you don't want to play something just DON'T. Tell your friends that you don't feel like playing and you want to do something else in life. If they are your friends you will still hang out with them IRL, if not, well you gonna meet new friends somewhere else in with your next hobby. Good luck"

StopGaming,fcnib2h,t3_ei3otk,1577812275.0,How can trolling ruin your mental health? You can mute players or if they ruin the game on purpose you can you know NOT play the game anymore. Play 1vs1 games or play single player games. Or walk outside of your house and play real life.  I played dota 2 on and off for 7 years and I never felt angry or something like that and after 7 years one day I got feeders 3 or 4 games in a row anf I realized welp Im out and decided to persue my love for guitar and playing offline strategy games. instead. in 3 weeks. Its like a relationship If you dont enjoy it anymore you can quit. Life is short
StopGaming,fccd520,t3_egst5b,1577597034.0,"I always think like this: when I am in my bed dying by old age would I would be glad i played 60k hours of games or would i be more glad I spend 60k hours playing guitar, recording music, running outside, hanging with my friends, reading traveling etc. Playing games is awesome activity also but not 12 hours a day. If you play games and watch tv for more than 8 hours a day in my opinion you have problems in your life and you need to figure what those problems are and work on it."
