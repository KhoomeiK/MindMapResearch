Other factors have been cited as reasons for the decline of streetcars and public transport generally in the United States. Robert Post notes that the ultimate reach of GM's alleged conspiracy extended to only about 10% of American transit systems.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-68) Guy Span says that actions and inaction by government was one of many contributing factors in the elimination of electric traction.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-span1-66) Cliff Slater suggested that the regulatory framework in the US actually protected the electric streetcars for longer than would have been the case if there was less regulation.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-even_earlier-69)

Some regulations and regulatory changes have been linked directly to the decline of the streetcars:

* Difficult [labor relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_relations), and tight regulation of fares, routes, and schedules took their toll on city streetcar systems.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Hanson-70)
* The [Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Utility_Holding_Company_Act_of_1935) prohibited regulated electric utilities from operating unregulated businesses, which included most streetcar lines. The act also placed restrictions on services operating across state lines. Many holding companies operated both streetcars and electric utilities across several states; those that owned both types of businesses were forced to sell off one.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-dcmuseum-71) Declining streetcar business was often somewhat less valuable than the growing consumer electric business, resulting in many streetcar systems being put up for sale.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-72) The independent lines, no longer associated with an electric utility holding company, had to purchase electricity at full price from their former parents, further shaving their already thin margins.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-73) The [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) then left many streetcar operators short of funds for maintenance and capital improvements.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-74)
* The [Dual Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_Contracts), signed by the [Interborough Rapid Transit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interborough_Rapid_Transit_Company) and [Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn%E2%80%93Manhattan_Transit_Corporation) of the [New York City Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway), restricted their ability to increase fares at a time of high inflation, allowed the city to take over them, or to operate competing subsidized transit.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-75)

Different funding models have also been highlighted:

* Streetcar lines were built using funds from private investors and were required to pay numerous taxes and [dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend). By contrast, new roads were constructed and maintained by the government from tax income.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-cqpress32-76)[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-economist-77)
* By 1916, street railroads nationwide were wearing out their equipment faster than they were replacing it. While operating expenses were generally recovered, money for long-term investment was generally diverted elsewhere.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]
* The U.S. government responded to the Great Depression with massive subsidies for road construction.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-cqpress32-76)
* Later construction of the [Interstate Highway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System) was authorized by the [Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956) which approved the expenditure of $25 billion of public money for the creation of a new 41,000 miles (66,000 km) interstate road network.[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-economist-77) Streetcar operators were occasionally required to pay for the reinstatement of their lines following the construction of the freeways.[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-dth5-78)\[[*failed verification*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)\]
* Federal fuel taxes, introduced in 1956 were paid into a new [Highway Trust Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Trust_Fund) which could only fund highway construction (until 1983 when some 10% was diverted into a new Mass Transit Account).[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Hanson-70)

Other issues which made it harder to operate viable streetcar services include:

* [Suburbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbanization) and [urban sprawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl), exacerbated in the US by [white flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight),\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] created low-density land use patterns which are not easily served by streetcars, or indeed by any public transport, to this day.[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-79)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-80)
* Increased traffic congestion often reduced service speeds and thereby increased their operational costs and made the services less attractive to the remaining users.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-81)[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-83)
* More recently it has been suggested that the provision of free parking facilities at destinations and in the center of cities loads all users with the cost of facilities enjoyed only by motorists, creating additional traffic congestion and significantly affects the viability of other transport modes.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-84)

## Counterarguments[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy&action=edit&section=10)]

Some of the specific allegations which have been argued over the years include:

* According to Snell's testimony, the [New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad) (NH) in New York and Connecticut was profitable until it was acquired and converted to diesel trains.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Myths-85) Little of NH was converted to diesel, and remains in electric operation under [Metro-North Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-North_Railroad) and [Amtrak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak). In reality, the line was in financial difficulty for years and filed for bankruptcy in 1935.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-86)
* ""GM killed the New York street cars"".[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Myths-85) In reality, the [New York Railways Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Railways_Company) entered receivership in 1919,[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-87) six years before it was bought by the [New York Railways Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Railways_Corporation).[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-88)
* ""GM Killed the Red cars in Los Angeles"".[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Myths-85) [Pacific Electric Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Electric_Railway) (which operated the 'red cars') was hemorrhaging routes as traffic congestion worsened with growing car ownership levels after the end of World War II.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-89)[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-Curb_2017/9/20-90)
* The Salt Lake City system is mentioned in the 1949 court papers. However, the city's system was purchased by [National City Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_City_Lines) in 1944 when all but one route had already been withdrawn, and the withdrawal of this last line had been approved three years earlier.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#cite_note-91)"

worldnews,fddtppl,t1_fddrwwg,1578323731.0,And are you defending somehow the quote from Phil Jones about not providing data because they’d just try to find something wrong with it? Remember a few comments ago how you explained to me how science works? Maybe send that same comment to Phil Jones. So again I don’t need the blogs to make me question the leading “scientists” all I need is their own words.
worldnews,fddsl03,t1_fddrwwg,1578322901.0,"Hold on are you telling me that Trenberth saying they can’t explain the pause and it’s a travesty they can’t was misinterpreted?  Yes it was from an email back. So leaked communications are now off limits?  Good faith discussion? I’ve read the emails. I’ve read the “explanations”, I’ve read they’ve been “investigated”.  Honestly if you can read those communications and come away thinking there’s nothing rotten in denmark the you my friend are the one arguing in bad faith.

Have people not lost their jobs at universities because they asked inconveninet questions? Have the data not been massaged? Has Michael Mann not sure critics?"
worldnews,fddrlwg,t1_fddqbpx,1578322156.0,"And my god if you can go back and justify the things said in both rounds of the climategate emails many of them directly involving Phil jones and the met then I don’t know what to say.  When these private conversations are leaked and then you see things like what happened to peter ridd and the polar bear lady, witness the obfuscation and denial of fisa requests for data, the lawsuits but learning climate scientists Michael Mann, it all clearly demonstrates the behavior these scientists talked about in private emails happens in real life.  They hide data, silence contrary scientific views,  lie, massage data, seek and succeed to have editors of scientific journals removed because they don’t toe the line. 

So no it’s not just what’s communicated in the media. It’s right from the horse’s mouth when they are speaking privately to one another and in the way they squash dissent.

My biggest dispute is that the science is in any way settled.
