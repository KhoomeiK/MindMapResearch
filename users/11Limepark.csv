trashy,ff6cccr,t1_ff5gewy,1579624099.0,Maybe that isn’t true. I’m not against prostitution in theory. They should be legally 21 and over though. Men seem to obsess over forbidden fruit so a law like that wouldn’t matter anyway. Like any good liberal I just don’t want in my neighborhood. 😎

hoarding,ff52zlv,t3_er79d5,1579578822.0,"Don’t discuss, just do it. Eventually she will hear you, get wind of it and probably join in. 

1) have one room that you can use as an extra storage room. Put obvious junk in it. Then have another room where you can go over the other piles. Like clothing, toys, furniture etc.. have her choose what she wants and keep it in that second keeper room. Do that for every room. 2)Eventually the crap that you don’t keep from whatever other place will end up in the trash room. Once you have everything in the trash room THROW IT OUT ASAP. 
3)Then back track to the keeper room. At this point the other rooms you mentioned should be fairly empty as everything else has been divided into two rooms. The trash room and keeper room. From the keeper room, break down things into sections. Clothes to keep, furniture that can be used and so forth. Clean the now emptied rooms. Then focus on redistribution from the keeper room into the proper places. 
4)If there is a bottle neck in the garage or basement include this in the great purge. NOW, not later.
5 ) If you are able it would be helpful to hire a person for a day or two to deal with the dirty, heavy stuff. Maybe from Craig’s list.
After this is all done, you could do a real cleaning, do the windows and even fresh paint. 

I have helped more than a few people with this sort of thing and doing it for myself to lesser degrees. She does not sound like a true hoarder as in she just won’t let anything go. Or a dirty hoarder or animal hoarder. It sounds like she is overwhelmed and disorganized right now. 

Lead by example. Be patient and humorous and think of this as giving back to your parents in a concrete way that they really need.have a check list of items you will need and bring it over. Garbage bags, extra boxes, tape, broom etc...

Good luck. You will feel good making a positive difference in their lives and they will be overwhelmed with love and gratitude for this gift you have given them."

I would put the tv over the fireplace and put the l shape sofa so one back is against the kitchen and the short side of the l so the back is facing entering the room.  I would pull it out a bit but use the l shape so it’s facing both tv and fireplace. Then I would hang the art on the wall next to the fireplace and put a narrow table up against the wall with a lamp, plants and some cool object de art. Also two big rugs one inside the l shape and one when you first walk in, facing the the room. A small low coffee table in front of the sofas. Lights on a dimmer.i would also not use the tv stand at all and add some textured blinds for windows and sliding glass doors. Long plantation wood shutters on sliding door if you can swing it."

These people who are criticizing you can fuck right off. Many would not have done half of what you have done for this animal. You are right about the neighbor. It’s weird.

hoarding,fdzqxyb,t3_enbwxq,1578793763.0,"Fabulousness! Now that I’m mostly on top of it, I divide my cleaning in a big way and organizing into four seasons. I do a deep cleaning 4 XP’s a year, like cleaning the wood work and wiping down every piece of furniture. Move everything around and throwing out or donating stuff. Having the rugs cleaned and washing the sofas. I also take the blinds down and soak them in the sink. I clean the oven out only twice a year. Same with a ceiling fan I have. I have the house power washed once a year and the rest of the time, weather permitting I hose it down myself. I also clean out the garage twice a year.

The fridge and garbage bins are washed down once a month. I straighten out my closets about once a month as well. Same with the windows unless I have new peeps visiting. I sweep a couple times a week and wash the floor every ten days or so. It does not look it and I guess I should do it more as I have pets. Once a week I dump the kitty litter, clean the bird cage and the bathrooms. Linens get changed every Sunday and blankets and pillows once a month. I burn incense every day. Sometimes I fuck off a little bit here and there but I try and stick to it. I love my house but I don’t want to be a slave to it either."

DomesticBirds,fdznrkv,t3_end0t9,1578792143.0,"I have a pineapple green cheek conure going on 8 years. I also have volunteered at a parrot refuge. My conure with luck and care can live to 20, maybe a bit older. He went thru the nippy, screaming stage from about 2 to 3 years old but has really settled down and is a cool little bird. 

I doubt I would ever get another parrot. Although if I did...I would go with a budgie or cockatiel. They live about ten years, maybe a bit longer. They are loving and very bright birds. The larger birds are fantastic but they take much more of everything to take care of and they live 60 to 80 years. If I were you, go to a parrot rescue and get an older one. They desperately need homes and you can get a good idea of their personality etc...there is also allot of truth that the bird chooses you. 

They are wonderful and magical creatures."
fragrance,fdziy7q,t1_fdzdln0,1578790630.0,"How democratic and kind of you. Really. No wonder you are romping in a field of femininity. I’m charmed. 

I’ve never used f.b or dating apps. The dick pic came about  from a young friend I rented a room to years ago. And they were from her friend. Her step brother and another friend of hers also asked me out. When I was under 50 and over 30 I dated younger men exclusively. Some are still good friends. I was not a club or bar person. These were and are very good looking men, talented and mostly decent sorts. I never expected or wanted anything serious with them and our entanglements went on for years. No regrets. Obsession! So 80’s. I do like a light soapy musk tho. The young ones are now firmly in my rear view mirror. I don’t want to become a caricature and it’s kind of nice being the young one.

fragrance,fdz8v4c,t1_fdylca5,1578787826.0,"Oh I am flattered although....bemused. I’m in decent shape, have good bones and was very good looking when I was YOUNGER. I don’t dress frumpy but I’m not super trendy. It’s just odd that’s all. I’m 55 and I still have men as young as 25 who have obvious crushes on me. They tell me and the selfies and a few unsolicited dick photos that have been sent to me tell me so. Maybe they just think I’m a horny old lady =low hanging fruit. I have a boyfriend and I’m friendly but not salacious or needing validation. I dunno. Maybe my deteriorating body is giving off desperate, last hope pheromones. 😏 I do seem to attract allot of creatures and insects. Lost or injured pets, birds and squirrels where they let me pick them up if they need help. Bees land on me and spiders. I also get the shit bitten out of me by mosquitos, fleas and so forth which is distressing. Guess I have sweet blood. 

The world is filled with old men. My boyfriend is older but has the energy of a young man. He has no clue and really no interest in porn. I find his wholesomeness to be rare quality that I treasure. Im glad I’m no longer young in this time that I live in. Young women ( and men) truly have my sympathy."

I’ve been debating if I should keep trying to entice my green check into a parrot backpack that I got him. He loves to ride in the car in an open cage. I only hesitate because I’m ashamed to admit I don’t want to be that person that others think are trying to seek attention. I also live in New England where there are severe weather and the pasture fluctuations so I have to be careful of that as they are very sensitive. They also get nervous when it gets dark."

BPDlovedones,fc6p3v7,t3_ege9m7,1577485927.0,"Let’s take what you say at face value. If what you are expressing is true, more or less, this is the best thing for the family. 

1) You are still young but old enough to observe patterns, history in this relationship. What has happened before will happen again. And again because she lacks unchecked qualities that will effect and are effecting the children. Never mind you. Your needs will have to go on the back burner for now.
2) Start strategizing. You don’t have to do anything right now. But do compile info that can be proven re: wife. Like stints at the hospital, any arrests and so forth. Reach out and subtly contact family, allies, witnesses just in case.
3) Your wife does not have the law on her side. She left of her own accord. She has demonstrated mental illness in the past. 
4) Forget romanticizing  your relationship. The longer the two of you stay together, the more she will disgust you. Encourage her to be a shitty mom and her absence. She wont change unless she experiences profound loss and probably not even then. It should not be at the expense of your children. The older you get the more you will resent the both of you for wasting so much time. This drama will become tedious and predictive in just a few more years. Let her go and do whatever...this will be the end result in any event, make it your choice and have a success plan for your children. 
5) If you get your house straight, mom is treated, untreated and lives happily far away, the kids are smart, happy and healthy and you are an earner THEN maybe start thinking about a real relationship. Make a better choice, now that you have a blue print on how to avoid disasters. 

2020 and doing it better."
