I advise her to report the landlord to the council.

Entering the home without permission counts as harassment and is very serious, reporting him to the council will likely get him a serious fine and potentially his license to lease properties revoked if this has been reported before or he doesn't change his behaviour.

The usually act very fast for issues like this and I really think she should do it ASAP."

AmItheAsshole,fez4xtp,t3_eqtevd,1579453904.0,"Kudos to your sister for realizing she was wrong. When you are so deeply set in religious beliefs and the people around you are as well, then it is really difficult to see the ugly untruths of it. She needed to be around people who didn't have those beliefs, maybe others in the LGBT community as well, to realize that what she did was wrong. For her that was college

Realizing she was wrong however does not erase what she did, and if you are not ready to make amends then no one can blame you for that.

But it is nice to know that when/if you feel ready, that she will be there.

But you definitely shouldn't feel pressured to forgive her, you'll just feel more resentment towards her and those that pressured you into it. You need to be able to forgive where when you are ready for it and if you're never going to be ready, then so be it."

Countries that have it, like the Netherlands, also get heavily demonised for it."

You did warn them that it's in a demolition zone and it is now a hazard.

Or you know, one of the big machinery tries to get around it and instead knocked it out of the way, accidentally of course"

Always look for the ""suitable for home freezing"" mark or freeze food you know 100% hasn't been frozen before (such as fresh foods)"
offmychest,fcn0zoi,t3_ehyc7q,1577800112.0,"I had to euthanize my cat because if a misdiagnosis. She coughed a lot and the vet prescribed medication that didn't end up working.

Despite going back multiple times because of this, our vet insisted to keep using the medication because it was helping and we just weren't seeing it.
Now when I think back on it I should've questioned it and gotten a second opinion right then, but i didn't. I figured she is the one that studied for this so she probably knows better than I do myself.

When my cats coughing got so bad she could barely do anything anymore, I finally convinced my parents to get a second opinion somewhere else.
I was told then that my cats airway was so tiny she couldn't breathe anymore, that it was like breathing through a straw for her. It would've been simple enough to fix with the right medication, but they could no linger give it to her because the pills she had been getting from the other vet completely destroyed her liver and kidneys.

I have never been as close to another cat as I was to her, and even though this was several years ago now I still think and cry about her often and am even crying writing this.

I know you can't expect people in medical (or any other) professions to never make a mistake, but I do think the first vet should have at least  considered that she got it wrong and done something about it. I'll never forgive her for that.

I am very sorry you have to go through this, it isn't something I would wish in anyone."

They may refuse you service in the future (highly doubt this) which they have a right to do.

But you are in no way legally required to heed their request."

vegetarian,fbydoau,t3_eewpx4,1577214286.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I've stopped getting my hopes up for Christmas. Our only real family tradition was a big meal at the dining table (we only use it for special occasions) with food that has been prepared all day.

It's not that my family doesn't approves, it's that they simply don't care.
I get frozen pre prepared meals for Christmas if I'm lucky. Tonight it's just potatoes.

If I didn't live in another country I'd make my own dinner and bring it.

I try to keep my expectations low every year but catch myself getting a little disappointed anyway.
I look forward to having my own home when I can be the one to invite my family for Christmas and make something that will include everyone.

I hope you and I both will have a nice inclusive family Christmas sometime soon. X"
