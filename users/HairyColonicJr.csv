I’ve gotten insanely sweet comps (first class flight plus vouchers to comp another flight) from overbookings and volunteering for the next flight. I got to use those vouchers for my gf and I to visit her family for the holidays.

Edit: the subsidies also provide airspace for private travel, so big airlines don’t just benefit from it. Airlines have a very low profit margin. If these costs were passed onto the customer, most of us wouldn’t be able to afford to travel. It’d be only for the rich again."

This is interesting. Idk if this is true of every farm, but the two farms I get my humanely raised meat (cow, chicken, pig) from doesn’t feed the animals human grade food. The food they get it the stuff that wouldn’t even be allowed to reach humans lips. I think it’s important that if you’re going to eat meat, to try to know your farmer. To know their sustainability practices, how the food is sourced, how the animals eat, the vaccines they may or may not be receiving. It’s more expensive. But I think it’s worth it to give the animals as best life they can have. And I do think the quality of life is reflects in a the quality of the end product. Ugh.. it just makes me sad still because I have some health issues and eating meat really does make me feel better and greatly reduces flare ups.
