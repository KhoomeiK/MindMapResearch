Art,ff5goam,t3_erk7ms,1579592056.0,"While I disliked Your Name, this image gives me a similar vibe. In fact it reminds me of my time living at Takara Gaike, Shugakuin station in Kyoto. It is very strange and feels like a strong wave of nostalgia, I can't out it properly with words, but that image expresses that feeling of a place that means a lot to me and that I miss. And I like this."
NintendoSwitch,ff406sh,t1_ff3h3q1,1579552680.0,I disagree with that. I think it is the right way to put it for consumer to understand right away what this game is about. Similarly diablo-like works fine for me. Those are landmark games franchises and it's fine to have a consumer friendly marketing.
NintendoSwitch,ff401a9,t3_erftlb,1579552585.0,Insanely dope
netflix,ff2q3p4,t3_er8rlv,1579518836.0,"I watched the show expecting to be a cliche high school thingy with students looking like 28+, girls existing solely for the purpose of existing, protagonist winning over the bully after receiving shit all year, minimal to no character development and so on. You see ! Like the typical drama filled cringworthy shows.

It's exactly what I think it is. I felt asleep halfway through the pilot. Never looked back."
MMA,ff2q03a,t3_er8ehp,1579518686.0,"Soldier of god is a very impressive war machine despite his age. A mistake in judgement could easily cost Adesanya a loss. Nevertheless, this is going to be an amazing fight, I like and respect both fighters."

blackdesertonline,feu72ui,t3_eqj1cs,1579383778.0,Ok so this is the weirdest request ever. But I wish we could play the kind of otter race such as Crio.

worldnews,feqc1hm,t1_feq2rvr,1579340022.0,Euthanasia is allowed. It artificially inflates the number and counts as suicide tho it's not.
worldnews,feqbwnt,t1_fepvsk1,1579339967.0,"Belgium suicide rate is higher because euthanasia is allowed, which inflates artificially that number. Look at France however, the country has a very high suicide rate if people consider Japan having a high suicide rate."

reddeadredemption,fe19bxy,t3_enbgcb,1578823953.0,This game is horribly overrated. A gorgeous game enveloppe hiding the shittiest game mechanics of this gen. The gunplay and movements are unbearable. Nice composition though.
PlayTemtem,fe17zzc,t3_enfoyp,1578823533.0,Tateru means to stand up in Japanese. Funny name isn't it?

gaming,fdb8sjq,t1_fd8z5rv,1578255000.0,I disagree. You should keep your style. Monsters can fit a wide spectrum in genre. Shin Megami Tensei. Temtem. DokeV. Digimon and many more! Keep pushing your identity and style it's great.
gaming,fdb8j61,t1_fd8ok5g,1578254910.0,If we push hard enough we may have a chance to have this in Temtem. It happened before!

Her entire career relevance is based off those campaigns. She then jumped off the boat right before it was about to sink, and is now an advocate against the company and mass media campaign manipulation."

gaming,fcr0u06,t3_eihqpg,1577895095.0,"I have bought Red Dead Redemption 2 to play together with my wife. The game is not fun. I don't know. I am very surprised and my wife as well. The gameplay is utterly unsatisfying and frustrating. It has the worst shooting mechanics and every single thing feels so good damn tedious. 

The game was immensely praised by everybody, both players and critics. I just cannot recommend this game. It looks gorgeous and realistic, but it simply is not fun. Very overrated game in my opinion."

blackdesertonline,fce04g7,t1_fcap6g5,1577615524.0,Enjoying it so far. I did not know anything about the combat system. I was pleasantly surprised about the almost fighting-game like mechanics. A breath of fresh air for a mmorpg.
blackdesertonline,fcajwby,t1_fanxz6b,1577570619.0,Technically I already bought two copies on PS4. Regarding PC I will get Crimson Desert when it releases.

blackdesertonline,fcajq6f,t1_fcajnan,1577570515.0,I was surprised at how much the game rewards you for talking to NPC. A lot of the stuff in the game is not said. And you get to do things better when you take your time.
blackdesertonline,fcajnan,t1_falaxh1,1577570467.0,This!

blackdesertonline,fcajiei,t1_fakzpfj,1577570386.0,Awesome. Thank you for the advice. Apologies for the late response. I definitely agree with the fact this is not a Sprint. I and my wife enjoy playing at our own pace and it's very enjoyable and fun. Still looking forward to the higher level grind.
blackdesertonline,fcaj9ii,t1_falbn3s,1577570242.0,Actually I found out the game doesn't require to purchase so much.
blackdesertonline,fcaify5,t3_egu4vt,1577569791.0,"Have fun. A lot of people on this subreddit are obsessed with performing like it's a job or something. it's not a race, take your time, try all the activities the game has to offer and play the way you want. In other words: become your true self."
