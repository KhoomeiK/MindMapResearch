What bank details were leaked? I'm looking at various sources and all they say is that a screen shot of his account balance was posted. And where are you seeing these shout outs to other hackers? None of the source I've seen mention that."

It was America doing the UK's dirty work in 1953 after the Iranian government (Mosoddegh) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now British Petroleum): 

""UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the preceding Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set. British intelligence officials' conclusions and the UK government's solicitations were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup, despite the fact that the U.S. government in 1952 had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"
