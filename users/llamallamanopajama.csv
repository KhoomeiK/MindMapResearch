depression,fennrc4,t1_fenmc5y,1579288370.0,"I'm a girl but it's all good. It's just rough feeling like no one cares. I always make it a point to be at their birthday celebrations no matter what and mine rolls around and I'm lucky to even get a text from them. Birthdays are a big deal to me and I almost always am the first one to wish someone a happy birthday (usually right at midnight). 

Having depression/anxiety I'm already in my head about feeling alone or unloved so when you get ignored on your birthday, those thoughts feel validated.

Anyway, sorry you went through that too. I hope you take some time this weekend to celebrate with something you enjoy."
depression,fenfcqe,t3_epym4o,1579283484.0,Happens to me all the time. It definitely sucks. Happy birthday!
Frugal,fen8pxu,t3_eq1ai2,1579279420.0,"There are some things that Walmart has for $0.88 that the dollar store sells for a $1 so it isn't always cheaper.

 I get those packs of green scrubbies for dishes/cleaning. I buy balloons. Party supplies like table cloths or decorations. 

A lot of times they get a surplus of inventory and you can find deals. For example, I bought a big pack of Kleenex brand pocket tissue. They've had Snyder's brand pretzels in the large bags. Sometimes they have Betty crocker or cake boss brand kitchen items. Some of the toys are pretty good, like they have the kids at work stacking blocks or outdoor balls/bubbles.

I like to buy greetings cards and thank you cards from there. Sometimes I get different craft supplies."

Frugal,fd7hse2,t3_ek0z22,1578204732.0,"I like to find little ways to reset that make me happy. I enjoy looking at the stars for a few minutes at night, going on a walk by myself, taking an extra long hot shower, or watching a show or reading a book that I want (usually my family chooses). All cheap or free but gives me that little reset that I need."
LifeProTips,fd7fxa9,t3_ejn6m4,1578203863.0,I agree with this. I would also add a few things you're looking forward to. Even if it's something small like looking forward to lasagna for dinner or having a long weekend next month.
LifeProTips,fd7f54d,t1_fd6qdvr,1578203505.0,Haha that's exactly what I was going to say. Do you want ants?! Because that's how you get ants!
LifeProTips,fd7dazg,t3_e96kkz,1578202687.0,"This is great advice. As someone who is the only one of her friend group to have children, I always appreciated the invite even if it wasn't possible for me to get away. Then once my oldest was able to be away from me for a bit (ie no longer breastfeeding), the invites were few and far between. Now I have two kids and have given up on my ""old"" group of friends for now. Different stages of life, I guess."

SantasLittleHelpers,fczs24f,t1_fczrg7w,1578107653.0,They really do! She's been so sick for over a week now and we've made urgent care trips and had an emergency room visit but I am just enjoying the constant snuggles and studying her little features that are changing from baby to little girl by the day. ðŸ˜­ It's going so much faster this second time it seems. But these ages are magical and I try to cherish every day!
Parenting,fczp1k0,t1_fczfdmw,1578106045.0,"I'm breastfeeding my youngest so that also may be a huge trigger with my hormonal need to protect my oldest, too. I just hate how mean kids can be from such a young age!"

Parenting,fcyziq2,t3_ejlt47,1578090549.0,"Could it also be anxiety related in that you don't know why she's crying? I have bad anxiety and sometimes it comes out as anger. It may be worthwhile treating anxiety if so, but otherwise I agree with others, you're a great dad and you are doing just fine."
Parenting,fcyy95x,t3_ejgxac,1578089732.0,"My five year old just told me he's getting bullied physically and emotionally a day before Christmas break started ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I held him while he cried and told me about what people have said and done to him.

I wish we could protect our babies forever. I'm so sorry this is happening already to your daughter too."
Frugal,fcytgfa,t3_ejhazv,1578086713.0,"I needed this kick in the butt kind of motivation. You're absolutely right. Having two pregnancies and years of breastfeeding in the last six years, I have quite the collection of clothes that I can't wear. I'm tired of being frustrated having nothing to wear despite a bursting closet so I'm cleaning it out this weekend!

I also have just about every piece of clothing my five year old has ever worn. It's come in handy for my one year old but now I need to get rid of some she's outgrown too.

Enough with the what if I lose weight or what if I have a third. I can't be this unhappy and crowded for years waiting."

Frugal,fcwn90u,t3_eiq0pw,1578030488.0,It depends on your prescription what type of lenses are best for you. I have to get the more expensive ones on Zenni because I have a higher prescription so they end up costing quite a bit more. Sorry I'm not much help there. But I came to say check out goggles4u. I liked them more than my glasses from zenni.
Frugal,fcwmblt,t3_eja6m9,1578029667.0,We don't do anything fancy but we like to do 1/2 Alfredo and 1/2 tomato in ziti (can add hamburger/mushrooms). It cuts down the tomato flavor and adds variety. Then another meal we can do spaghetti and then Alfredo (can add chicken).
BigBrother,fcwfgbc,t1_fcwa07g,1578024258.0,Wrong Jessica :)
SantasLittleHelpers,fcvatho,t1_fcva721,1577998225.0,"Did you even read what I wrote? Wow, toxic response. 

I DID post a thank you. I did post one image, that's all I could figure out how to attach. I did message every single one of my Santa's and thank them this morning. For being an anonymous Santa it seems you want quite the recognition. I'm glad you're giving to families and appreciate you, I was just offering an opinion from an alternative point of view. 

And your response is ridiculous about me not ""following any rules"" and people ""throwing gifts at my kids"". That's hardly at all what happened. But thanks for tagging the mods because they know the truth about my situation and that people are human and make mistakes. :)"
SantasLittleHelpers,fcv8x2h,t1_fcug1xa,1577997095.0,"Maybe I'm naaive or ignorant here, but how do people scam with a wish list of children toys? I'm so confused. Especially because the Santa's could read our stories and decide who to help.

It seems the process was pretty through in applying, requesting personal information and submitting a picture of your family holding your username and such.

I saw another request to ban people next year who break rules. Although I'm hoping to not have to return as a requester next year, I'll be the first to admit I broke a rule accidentally that I didn't know was not allowed of deleting my request post. I screenshot the comments so I could make sure to come back and thank my Santa's but I didn't want someone to purchase any more for my family since the kids had received a few gifts each and someone was good enough to purchase items for me and my boyfriend as well (he's my baby daddy x2, weddings are just expensive ðŸ˜‚). Shortly after I got a message from a mod asking why I did and I apologized and explained why I did and still feel badly about it.

I've also been really bad at thanking my Santa's. I did once the gifts arrived and posted one picture but both of my kids have been sick, the baby more severe, so I've been slacking on my growing to-do list. I also am not sure how to upload pictures or use imgur. I joined Reddit for the big brother community recently and am really behind on learning it and joining so many awesome communities like this one.

Anyway, thank you, for being kind to families and know not all of us that suck at communication or following rules are scammers."
