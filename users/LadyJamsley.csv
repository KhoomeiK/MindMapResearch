Parenting,fegvhy9,t1_fefl7pf,1579103458.0,Haha ok. What if you combined the two maybe? Like Javanna? Or maybe something that combines your mother‚Äôs name?
Parenting,feefh73,t1_feed8nb,1579032679.0,I simply meant most of the names we liked were unisex. And what exactly are the ‚Äúdownsides‚Äù? An upside could be finding a name you really like whether you have a boy or a girl. Which is useful if you are the type of person who likes to wait until the day of birth to find out the sex of the baby.
Parenting,feecqc1,t1_fee6qx5,1579031061.0,Not a fan of the name Jamie? Or Vanna?
Parenting,fee202n,t3_eoofiu,1579024738.0,"Are you comfortable with any of your boy names being used for a girl? For us, we liked more unisex names. My daughter‚Äôs name is Charleigh, not short for anything, just Charleigh."

SIL kids were all obsessed and now my kiddos (especially my daughter) love that show. Like...LOVE...that show. She goes into like a trance state whenever we put it on. 

- What about the music/visuals is so entrancing?
- Where are their parents and how come it took them 3 seasons to even mention family outside of the classroom?! 
- Why do their animals all have fins, but when they imagine scenarios, the animals are more anatomically correct?"
cats,fe5m5oa,t1_fe4vrr2,1578871214.0,"I had a cat who was this fat. Vet explained he had a gastrointestinal issue that basically slowed his metabolism. So he didn‚Äôt eat more than his siblings, but was much larger than them. He never developed diabetes, but he did pass from kidney complications at 13 years."

careerguidance,fdh7ctg,t1_fdfns1i,1578416963.0,"I second this and will add the smiling a lot does wonders. You tend to come across more confident and (at least for me) feel it more too. Plus, it makes you more personable and that‚Äôs something sought after as both an employee and a co-worker."
femalehairadvice,fdfjdmt,t1_fdfiewb,1578363079.0,Thank you! I go through rotations of hair preference. This is my third time having pixie short hair and I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be the last lol. I did like keeping an undercut the last time I grew my hair out so I definitely agree with you there.
Marriage,fdehnn7,t3_ekylvp,1578339228.0,"I too came from a household of yellers so I definitely understand your struggle. I am also the type who cries in the midst of conflict (usually from frustration of not being able to articulate my perspective and/or feeling unheard). But when my husband and I argue, our intensity goes up (meaning we both try to stress our points), but our voices stay fairly level, then we get quiet, cool down, and reconvene with less emotionally charged defenses and talk it out. 
It is totally possible to have a relationship where yelling is not the norm, but you also have to let your partner know that not yelling it your style of arguing and you value that greatly. If they are the right partner for you, they will respect that and will abide by said method."
Marriage,fdabta2,t3_ek68sv,1578244280.0,"My parents constantly fought and laid blame on each other for anything that went wrong. My favorite piece of advice (actually handed down from my grandmother who was married to her husband til death) was essentially this: The secret to marriage is the realization that you are a team. It‚Äôs not you vs them, it‚Äôs both of you vs the world."

Marriage,fbin70d,t1_fbguzv2,1576906349.0,"I agree that communication will not necessarily solve the problem and that in the end it is action that will, but talking would ultimately help people arrive to the appropriate action for the both of them. And to reference the other post in this subreddit, he communicated to his partner what he believed his options to be and from there it took action on both their parts to try things again. 
I can see where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm just trying to give a perspective from a neutral ground (as an old psych major). Communication is a vague answer to a very personal problem and I definitely recognize that. The idea is to try communicating in the way that works best for the couple. Even that takes precious time and energy and, in the end, not all relationships are worth saving."
