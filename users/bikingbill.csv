McKinsley: For example, as heat and humidity increase in India, by 2030 under an RCP 8.5 scenario, between 160 million and 200 million people could live in regions with a 5 percent average annual probability of experiencing a heatwave that exceeds the survivability threshold for a healthy human being, absent an adaptation response. (The technical threshold we employed is a three-day heatwave with wet-bulb temperatures of 34 degrees Celsius. At that point, the urban heat island effect could increase the wet-bulb temperature to 35 degrees Celsius. All our lethal heatwave projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects).

OldSchoolCelebs,fdozhxy,t3_ejjawi,1578616431.0,"**Christine Margaret Keeler** (22 February 1942 – 4 December 2017) was an English model and topless [showgirl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showgirl). Her meeting at a dance-club with society [osteopath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy) [Stephen Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Ward) drew her into fashionable circles. At the height of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), she became sexually involved with a married government minister, [John Profumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Profumo), as well as with a Soviet naval attaché, [Yevgeny Ivanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Ivanov_(spy)). A shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom), Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied. This incident discredited the [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)) government of [Harold Macmillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan) in 1963, in what became known as the [Profumo affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profumo_affair). Keeler was alleged to have been a prostitute - which was not a criminal offence. Ward was however found guilty of being her [pimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procuring_(prostitution)) – a trial instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government."
