I think you can ask an audiologist to try out hearing aids before committing, if you‚Äôre curious. There are some programs (check with your state) that offer assistance for hearing aid costs."

Taking care of yourself can just be baby steps - hygiene, to building relationships, to seeing a therapist. Set yourself one goal a day.

AskReddit,fcgcds5,t3_eh4nfa,1577638575.0,"I was 15 when I went to NYC for the first time in late 2000s. My mom and I were shopping in Macy‚Äôs and I was scoping out the junior section. I was waiting for a dressing room and a girl my age was waiting too. 

She was nice enough to compliment my purse and ask me where I was from. She was so nice and talkative, genuinely interested. I felt like we could‚Äôve been friends. It was so neat meeting someone my age from NYC and I was totally socially awkward at 15, but she made me feel cool and likeable. 

We walked to another part of the store together to find a dressing room for ourselves and parted ways when it was her turn to go in. 

I tried to look for her after I got out but never saw her again.  But still think about her and hope she‚Äôs doing alright!"

When I became familiar with some of the nuisances (good and bad) of certain sub-Reddits...is when I felt like I was part of it...

And then some comments I expected to get downvoted were upvoted."
