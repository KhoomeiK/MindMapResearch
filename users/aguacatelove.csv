It has worked well for me, but I have had trouble finding the right combo.  Anyway, I would just take your time and be kind to yourself.  Practice good self-care and try to stay grounded in science as another user shared.  I just started a med that changed things for me but it only started working like 10 days ago, and my doctor told me to give it time.  Try to develop a new healthy routine for yourself of meals, rest, healthy outings if you feel up to it.  Best of luck!  So happy you are doing so much better overall."
