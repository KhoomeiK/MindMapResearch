This is why Portal is absent from JCG for instance, it just cannot handle Rune.

As a result, other players may want to consider to threat of Portal when thinking about bringing, say, Ambush. Now if you're bringing something like Rune/Shadow/Dragon, and your opponent has Ambush, it's likely they want to ban Shadow and you have to ban Ambush, therefore leaving their remaining 2 decks open (even if one of them is Rune).

I question that, I don't remember it ever being that high. Usually cygames uses an undisclosed threshold (I suspect it's 55%) for both winrate and playrate, and make an adjustment when both are crossed. Usually they'll post it to justify their changes, unless it's in the middle of a GP."

The whole convo was about tournaments (although it's also true of ""tryhard"" ladder players going for gm3). Ladder monkeys will play whatever they find enjoyable yes, and often that's spellboost. Now if you look at the top of the ladder and players trying to climb efficiently, you'll find plenty of Shadows, Ambush and I believe the current rank 1 has been spamming Amataz. In any meta dominated by one powerful deck, pretty much everyone in the top 20 spammed the same deck. This is clearly not the case now.  

>That has nothing to do with whether Shikigami Rune is braindead. It's ease of use doesn't affect winrate.  

​Of course it does. If it was that easy and ""mistakes aren't punished"", it would perform better. The reason it's not doing as well in reality as it does in your imagination is because players consistently get punished for screwing up.  

>The point was, you said it was less Runecraft dominated last week when the difference was a whole 3% less and is still north of 75%.  

I'm not sure which tournament you're referring to since there are multiple jcgs every week. I have access to all the data so feel free to be more specific. Last week had multiple tournaments with Shadow being heavily represented (roughly 80% of Rune's representation, both archetypes included), whereas this week there's a lot less Shadow and more Forest, and as a result, Rune is performing better (ie there's more at the top).   

>Anyone playing Ladder can tell you that the overwhelming number of matchups are Shikigami Rune, there's posts complaining about it on this sub daily.  

Ah yes, because whine posts and anecdotal evidence from a tiny minority is even better than flawed data.  

>Mistakes are made and you can tell they are being made, but they don't make as much impact when Spellboost, card draw and board vomit are all largely unaffected.  

Again, that's just you spouting random shit, there's 0 substance there. Post some replays or refer to some vods and I can show you exactly why and how mistakes are punished and how that affects the outcome.

​Thanks, whatever that means.  

>How many languages do you speak? Why do you think the ""top Shadowverse players in every region"" somehow have more of an opinion on playrates and the game in general than others?  

Uh... 3? I can't even begin to understand why you'd ask that, but okay. And turning the next question around, there are plenty of players who perform extremely well and consistently, have repeatedly demonstrated a deeper understanding of the game and its balance state, and some of them play for a living. What makes you think your personal opinion (and I'll give you the whiny minority of the sub on your side if you want) is more accurate than all of theirs?  

>Ah here we go. ""It doesn't matter to me, so it doesn't matter""  

​Broadly speaking, yes. But also, basketball stats are rarely brought up to discuss a footballer's performance. Unlimited is a joke format and has nothing to do with the balance of Rotation, this much should be obvious.

Alright the troll was credible up until this."
Shadowverse,feqectt,t1_fepxn7m,1579340833.0,">Shikigami Rune has been the most played deck since the expansion dropped.  

I didnt deny that. But anyone paying attention should notice the meta shifts. Also playrate != success. For example [this one](https://sv.j-cg.com/compe/view/tour/1970) had 205 Runes, 163 Shadows in qualifiers, but by the time they got to top 4, they were even (42 Runes including 2 Natura and Shadows). And in the top 16 there were more Shadows than Runes, with Shadow+Dragon winning it all.  
Wanna go over that again? 40+ players brought Rune over Shadow and Shadow still ended up with a higher frequency at the top level AND won the tournament. But clearly, Kuon is braindead to pilot and those 200+ players just got really unlucky.  

>Last week Runecraft was picked by 12 of 16 participants, aka 75%  

No shit? It's a 2 deck, no ban format. Competitive players in a tournament aren't going to play Blood+Portal for funsies. Also only 12 out of 16 players is lower than usual (eg we regularly had 15+ players bring Nhaven last expansion, or lion AND midsword in SR, and let's not even go over RoG Vblood/Machina Rune). It indicates that 4 of the top players thought they had better chances bringing not one, but 2 decks that weren't Rune.  

>On the ladder last week  

One, those stats aren't reliable, especially if they come from shadowlog. Two, these stats conflate Natura and Spellboost and you have no way to tell them apart. Three, I don't really give a shit because again, playrate is an indicator of popularity, not of power level. In fact Ambush Sword had a much higher winrate for 2 weeks and you still don't see anyone whining about it. Even if that was the case, the discussion was about tournament players, so ladder stats are irrelevant because they're played on a much lower level.  

>tempo and card draw are largely not dependent on their own decisions  

A claim without any substance, borderline absurd. There are plenty of mistakes to be made, and against good players, they get punished. Post 3 replays and I guarantee you I'll spot 3 mistakes, probably even before turn 5.  

>Nice to see you've spoken to ""the top players in every region though.""  

Not sure what your point is, but yes. I interact with many of them regularly, and plenty of others post their opinions publicly on twitter and other media. So far I have not seen a single good player claim that Kuon is an easy deck to pilot, or complain about a lack of diversity. If you find some, I'd love to talk to them.  

>both formats  

Don't give a fuck about unlimited. That format was meant to be for fun and is not supported in competitive anymore, anyone who brings it up as an balance argument loses any credibility they may still have. You might as well bring up T2 or O6 format.  
  
Also conflating Rotation's Kuon archetype with Unlimited's D-Shift + Daria (which are different decks themselves, individually less popular than aggro shadow or amataz...) is disingenuous at best.  

>the exact same archetype is running literally the entire game.  

I already gave examples above for archetypes that actually ran the entire game. Feel free to go over both their ladder and tournament stats and compare them to the current environment."

They did, last week. Then control forest showed up, and it performs well against shadow but worse against Rune, so people who know their matchups switched to Rune + Forest. This is also why Rune players started including 1 Karyl, otherwise a very poor choice in the deck, specifically for that matchup.  

This really isn't complicated, it's how metas evolve over time. It takes more than just going ""wow that's a big number"" to analyze data and draw correct conclusions.  

>People are playing Runecraft because it requires little skill or effort to pilot properly. Misplays aren't accurately punished because temp losses or lack of draw are never a concern and can be forgotten about.  

Skill floor/ceiling are somewhat subjective, there's someone else in this thread claiming that Shadow is braindead easy for instance. But the consensus among top players in every region seems to be that all the current best decks (rune, shadow, forest, sword) are all reasonably hard to pilot and there's a significant skill gap - much more than in any meta since 2018 at least.  

>Considering Runecrafts overwhelming dominance in both rotation and unlimited, I'd expect the same.

In this particular case there's also, of course, the main issue of putting a player at risk.

>people get them because they like the way they look.  

And again, for a host of other reasons. Among small dogs ( < 15kg) they're some of the smartest, most loyal and playful breeds you'll find, again provided proper training and care. The short-haired ones require minimal care and handle hot weather well. And they're great at guarding houses despite their size because they generally don't trust strangers, bark loudly, and aren't afraid of... anything, as far as I can tell. Those are just a few reasons why I picked dachshunds over other breeds, their appearance is just an afterthought.  

> They are prone to spinal problems because of their long spinal column and short rib cage  

Which should show you why your previous argument of ""why not just breed that trait out of them"" was absurd. It's an inherent risk. The big difference here is that 1) it's just that, a higher % of occurrences, not an inevitability like munchkins being shit at running and jumping, and 2) it's not a permanent condition, there are treatments and even surgeries that can solve this problem if it ever arises. In my case, only one of 4 dogs (which seems to fit the stats) ever had a spinal problem, and it took a single day at the vet to completely cure it. Fucker is 11 and still sprinting around like it's christmas. The others never showed any sign of pain nor did it impair their movement. I wouldn't say that's a reasonable argument against the very existence of the breed. It's hardly comparable to munchkins, or a lot of other dog breeds and far more common health issues; for example, most female bulldogs cannot give birth naturally and need a c-section, while the males are often incapable of mounting and require artificial insemination of the female. Now that's a good case for a breed that probably shouldn't exist, if it can't even breed nor give birth without human intervention.  

The rest of the health issues you mentioned aren't really worth going over. Every breed is, by nature, more prone to some issues and has some strengths and weaknesses. Google ANY breed and you'll find similar lists. Those are not indications that the breed is an abomination and a crime against nature, they're just warnings to potential owners and breeders.  

Brittle bones are hereditary and tested for before breeding. Heart defects may happen with all small dogs but are way more common if you own a hunting dog and don't give it room for exercise, or let it go obese... much like humans, really. Again, of the 4 I cared for, the only one that had a heart defect from birth was the most active one and didn't show any sign until she was old, and lived to be 14. I mean, over the course of 4 dogs' lives, the most serious health issues my vet had to deal with was one of the dogs being attacked and bitten by 3 other, bigger dogs; and a tooth infection. So much for the congenital problems."

They're basically just a dysfunctional, miserable version of the original breed, and the only minor upside is that some people find them cute, which is clearly not worth it. Therefore we should not breed them.  

Dachshunds on the other hand (and most dog breeds) have a lot of unique traits, other than their funny appearance, that make them valuable pets. You wouldn't compare a dachshund to a husky, a beagle or a german shepherd and claim that some of them live happier lives than others based on breed; or that some are ""worth breeding"" and the others aren't. They're all completely different animals and all good pets, but they suit different people with different needs, eg. how much space do you have? what's the climate? how much time can you dedicate to them, what's your food and vet expenses budget? how much do you know about training, do you have children, do you live in a noisy neighborhood, do you own other pets and which ones?

Renolock had Shadowflame and Hellfire for somewhat similar boardclears). On occasion, meta decks had a third of their list already fulfill HL requirement.  
 
On the other hand, HL in Shadowverse is unreliable because you have 40 cards, most of the cards in a ""good"" deck are 3-of, and you rarely get 2 cards with similar effects in the same class.  

So in HS, you can balance HL decks roughly like you would any other deck, and just assume that they're about as reliable. In SV, you have to make those HL effects ridiculously overpowered to compensate for the fact that they're unreliable (and/or print a large number of cards with more reasonable effects to support the archetype, at the cost of fewer cards for every non-HL archetype).  

This results in a deck that will generally be crap, but will absolutely crush opponents when they happen to draw well. Now I'm sure you can see why Cygames would err on the side of caution and keep such an archetype weak rather than risk it becoming meta, let alone competitive."

This is very much an argument about viability and diversity, no matter how much you throw your buzzword around.  

>never had this level of planned obsolescence before  

Oh no, we had far more than that at any point before Rotation. See, when cards don't rotate, powercreep is necessary for new decks to supplant old ones, with the occasional exception of decks being pushed out by an unfavorable meta. Now we have key cards rotating every expansion, so the power level can stay the same or even go down.  
Mysteria didn't get powercrept by Lions and Midsword in SR, it simply lost Knowledge and Bertrand, while Cocytus lost 2PP Aiela.  
Pre-nerf RoG Blood was the one blatant case of powercreep this year, and even that was enabled because midsword got gutted by losing DBNE core. Most of that powercreep was then reverted by nerfs.  
In VC DLF and Fate's Hand rotated, hitting 2 major players from the previous expansion, enabling NHaven. Poseidon rotating allowed Roach to get a good matchup against Dragon, and so on.  
And finally Haven lost both Cravings and Feather Rush while also getting Agnes nerfed... and it's still a good deck by UC standards. So no, there's virtually no powercreep going on, just Rotation working as intended. Not that your argument was going anywhere even if that claim was true.  

>people use it to climb easily, resulting in everyone seeing virtually nothing but Kuon on the ladder and consequently complain it, not because it's popular, that's just evil evil anti-Rune bias, but the reason it is played is because players love the class so much, not because it's strong  

Yawn. Yes. If people wanted to climb quickly, they'd play Ambush sword. That has proven to be the fastest deck since day 1. By and large, they play Kuon over it because they find spellboost more enjoyable. Again, just like they played D-Shift back in the day when they couldnt even achieve a 50% wr with it and there were half a dozen better climbing decks.  
You could also make a point about budget, which makes players flock to cheap decks like Kuon rather than Ginsetsu, which is about 3 times more expensive to craft.  

>everyone seeing virtually nothing but Kuon on the ladder and consequently complain it, not because it's popular, that's just evil evil anti-Rune bias  

Welcome to the sub I suppose. Step out of the bubble and you'll realize that this is a tiny fraction of a small western community, in a game with millions of players. Just like the rest of reddit, it is in many ways an echo chamber, and does not represent a global consensus.  

>X class main threads which used to be everywhere didn't start disappearing around a year ago because of powercreep  

Part of it is because we have more centralized resources to discuss those things, rather than individuals all posting about classes. Dane posts a weekly thread gathering commonly played decks which, if you read the comments, sparks a lot of discussion about each class, what works for them, how they can push back against the top of the meta and so on. Add to that videos from Jordude, Igni and so on, and our meta snapshots.

>let's be real here for a moment: Kuon, is played so much because it's broken tier strong and brainless.  

Both false. Kuon has several counters and isn't the strongest nor the most popular deck. It's also one of the harder decks to pilot well, and a lot of competitive players are enjoying the meta because several decks are actually difficult to play, as opposed to RoG and to some extent VC.  

>People like to copy-paste lists, then pat themselves on the back what great players they are.  

That's true regardless of deck complexity. But people also enjoy playing specific classes and mechanics and Rune is a long time fan-favourite that disappeared for 3 months."

Shadowverse,fd79fbi,t1_fd6tyfl,1578201165.0,"That's not really how tournaments work though. It's not ladder where people play whatever they want provided it's somewhat viable.  
Even if a deck is considered 1% better than everything else, the majority of participants will play that deck to increase their chances, leading to a ""class count"" almost identical to the most unbalanced metas where one deck crushes everything. People will *always* largely play 2-3 decks in this format, unless the meta somehow reaches a perfect state of balance never seen before.  

Pointing out that most people played Shadow/Rune is what the OP already did, and pulling random conclusions about balance from there is very narrow-minded. Following those kneejerk reactions, Rune should have been hotfixed day 1 before JCG while Shadow was a joke and needed a buff, and 24 hours later Rune was actually fine but Ambush was oppressive. 1 week later people are calling Shadow broken. Now granted, even broken clocks are right twice a day, but I'm not sure there's a point to that.  

Now if you wanted a constructive discussion solely based on stats, you'd have to collect the data for the entirety of the bracket and compare how well classes performed relative to their popularity, rather than just look at absolute numbers.  
For instance, you would see that Portal and Blood saw almost no play - meaning they're considered bad, but could still be explored or might come back to a more favourable meta - while 34 players brought Forest and none of them qualified. This tells you that those Forest decks have been experimented with and definitely perform poorly against the current gauntlet. Same result for 3 classes, but very different conclusion.  
Another example, Kuon Rune had 10/136 = 7.4% players qualifying while Shadow had 16/192 = 8.3% qualified, though of course that number is gated by the fact that it's a top 16. If we go down to top 4 of each group (64 players, 128 decks) it's 40/136 = 29.4% Kuon, vs 58/192 = 30.2% Shadow.  

So despite picking up steam more recently and lists still changing, Shadow is outperforming Rune and even more so in the final stages of groups / top 16, where the matchup is more common and the players are generally stronger. From there you could expect that Rune becomes the target in a 2d0b format and will slowly get pushed out by aggressive decks in future tournaments."

That's very unlikely since you need to burn your evos to get the pings, but you also need to evo Karyl for the removal. In practice this almost never happens.  

>2 Karyl equals 10 DMG.  

Only if you don't actually deal damage in the meantime and just slam Karyls. Kuon is a tempo deck that can push a lot of damage by the time Karyl is online, so most of the reduction from Karyl is wasted against anything but Azazel/Sanguine Core. Pretty much every high rank player doesn't run Karyl and they still have plenty of damage to end games.  

>Putting 3 Karyl in the Kuon deck is enough  

It really isn't though. Every card you put in your deck comes at a cost, and in a spellboost focused deck, a 6 cost card that doesn't boost nor gets boosted is simply too heavy. It's a brick, and it means your deck is missing 3 useful cards."

Strongly disagree with that. 4 classes and 8 decks is good. It's extremely rare in SV history to see more classes or more decks represented at the highest level. If you're expecting more than that in a tournament setting, you're either incredibly optimistic or you don't understand balance.  

And of course there are multiple natura decks, the whole expansion was focused on making those happen.  

WGP 2018 is hard to compare because the format included unlimited (blergh), and Rotation was 2 decks in day 1, 3 decks day 2.  
I don't have the full data anymore but from what I remember, the vast majority brought Blood + Dragon day 1, and everyone had at least one of those.
