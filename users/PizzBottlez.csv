Drugs,fcto4ik,t3_eilz8j,1577951032.0,"Depersonalization and derealisation is a living nightmare to deal with. You can't enjoy anything. When I was at my worst, a few sips of tea would set me off on a day long panic attack. 
For the depersonalization and derealisation, what I reccomend trying, is to simply let it happen. Do not fight the feeling. I spent years trying to fight this feeling and it only lessened when I just let it happen. I know there is a fear of losing control or becoming permanently damaged, but trust me you'll be fine.
I know it sounds like a silly solution but just try it  :) 
Good luck pal, also, if you can get your hands on it I'd reccomend some CBD, it helps me a bit."
