todayilearned,ffdir3b,t1_ffdex2x,1579821733.0,I saw this in a video on reddit years ago.  We should start a new subreddit showing videos of home experiments on cats.  The new sub shall be called r/expurriments.

restaurateur,fekqlbe,t3_epo6q2,1579205566.0,"My friend on LI just sent me a link showing me these the other day. I did a quick search and see a lot of articles about places in bigger cities doing it but no one is here.  I am considering it but they're at least $1200. Can I ask what you're charging for renting it? I assume you rent it out for 1-2 hours and then just sell your regular menu?

It might be easy to build a portable floor with fake hardwood flooring that is easy to assemble and clean. You could make separate pieces that get put side by side, so you can pick them up and stack them for storage.  Another idea is rubber mats that lock together like puzzle pieces."

OutOfTheLoop,fe4o95e,t3_enoa5i,1578861295.0,This is so funny. My girlfriend and I said this exact thing recently. Her ex bought her daughter a $70 hoodie and we were shocked. Before that we saw young girls wearing Champion track suits at a concert. They're still very affordable at the outlet stores.
howardstern,fe4a2ao,t1_fe261dh,1578857225.0,Sounds like a perfect date night for Benjy and Perez.
Syracuse,fe48552,t1_fe46yol,1578856669.0,"It is great and I'm like you with beer. Try a hefeweizen, maybe a sour, or for darker beers, try a porter or stout. I like Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout."
drunkencookery,fdy9k0c,t1_fdx50ia,1578777463.0,"Can't see the name, what is it?  My brother growing up made pizza with, I think, Don Peppino and it was fantastic."
howardstern,fdqlyzw,t1_fdqizo9,1578669838.0,I guess you could call it a pig roast.
howardstern,fdqhc4y,t1_fdq574x,1578666680.0,So Gary was right.  What's your point?
pics,fdodyts,t1_fdm8kfs,1578603370.0,Hello fellow upstater. I was just telling someone that said she was related to him that I used to see the cabin he was born in in Filmore Glen in Moravia.
pics,fdodqye,t1_fdjjd89,1578603265.0,Are you in upstate NY or do you have relatives from there?  He was born in a cabin that is preserved at Fillmore Glen state park in Moravia. I used to see it every summer when we went camping there.

shittymoviedetails,fcalm4z,t1_fcae5sc,1577571665.0,"You reminded me of an actual news story.  In 1997 an agent shot a kid holding a foil wrapped candy bar, a Three Muskateers I believe. So give Al some credit."
howardstern,fca2ahw,t3_egrqrj,1577561985.0,What a coincidence. She was just on the local morning show here promoting her appearance at Funny Bone doing stand up. I don't think she even mentioned her podcast. I had never heard of her before that.
Syracuse,fc96ck0,t1_fc95vul,1577547737.0,That is correct.
Syracuse,fc3whya,t3_efzvdv,1577400422.0,"Not ""fancy"" but a good brunch at The Evergreen."
