insanepeoplefacebook,fcbhwjh,t1_fcbfu19,1577587070.0,"Sorry, alot of people have been discussing about plant life that I've gotten overwhelmed. What is your opinion on a embryo/fetus and when it's life begins?

And I was talking about a humans perspective because I am not educated on if any other animals have embryos that are developed differently to start being considered living. I just wanted to go in depth on when a humans fetus is considered alive scientifically and how."
creepyPMs,fcbgfuq,t1_fcbe842,1577586554.0,"My boyfriend is always home (doesn't hang with his friends much) he doesn't make any  jokes that he wouldn't around me, we are just bluntly honest with each other and enjoy dark humor. 

And he doesn't have to have romantic interests, just sexual interest. There are guys that will text you without any respect and no care about if they lose something with you, with immature advances, he only knew me for a day so the likeability of him caring about losing me is slim

Having said that he had texted me from a different account admitting to being serious and wanting to start a sexual conversation but didn't know how to since all my posts weren't something he could sexualize to his liking, they were all of my boyfriend.

He wanted me to unblock him and said that he claimed it was a joke in fear of being blocked in the first place.

So it wasn't a joke, and quite frankly if you joke like this to a girl you've met just a day before, you're an idiot."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcbev7p,t1_fcbcmqa,1577586001.0,"My bio book says different in regards to plant life, it's what I and my classmates have been taught. And I keep saying this, I am trying to only talk about human life in general. Plants are a whole different thing vs humans, we don't have the same things such as blood cells and hearts, to try to compare human embryos to a seed is not a good comparison, but it was the best way I could think of trying to explain an embryo.

My point here is that embryos aren't able to feel anything and are not alive, science has said it for years.

And I believe that our life is equal to an animals life, I don't agree with how people rise humans above them."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcbcshx,t1_fcbcfbw,1577585286.0,"Well, that's basically what it is I suppose. Without the trigger it's not alive is the whole point of my argument."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcbc1e9,t1_fcbacft,1577585027.0,"Good question, A seed is the embryo of a new plant but in a dormant state, which requires being buried in soil or other suitable matter to trigger off the renewal process.

A quoted text from a biology textbook I have

""Seeds grow when they are planted in the ground so they are living, but they don't when you leave them in a packet so they are then not living. Because they do not move or grow without help from water or fertiliser.""

There has to be a trigger in order for the process of life to begin with a seed."
creepyPMs,fcbasmv,t1_fcb7jpd,1577584589.0,"Even if it were a joke it doesnt make it any less creepy. 

He tried to text me on a different account saying that he thought saying that would lead to a sexual conversation since he was ""in the mood"" and that he was sorry, wanting me to unblock him on his main page."

insanepeoplefacebook,fcb3fo0,t1_fcb11ff,1577581825.0,"I already said plants don't have a heartbeat, they don't ever have one. I am referring to human life, not plant life."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcb2t63,t1_fcar08x,1577581565.0,"Humans are made of cells, we start off as cells, but without a heart beat we are not actually alive, meaning a embryo doesn't live.  Being able to live and currently living are two different things.

Most plants are made from seeds, yet a seed doesn't live does it? If given the chance to grow it would start to become a life, only difference is that a plant doesnt have a heart beat ever in its life cycle so its actually alive from the very beginning of its roots, it's the best way I can think to explain the difference on why cells and life aren't the same. We need cells to live, but we cannot live with only cells.

> You didn't even mean human, you meant a human

Not sure what you mean by this, I meant what i said. Human.

As for the farmer question I don't know considering I'm not a farmer, but it may just be because the calf would come out disfigured beyond living, or becoming a danger to the mothers life.

Yes, A person who loses their arm is still a human being, not technically a full human though since they are missing a limb, but no matter the case they still have a beating heart, if a person dies it doesn't mean they stopped being human, it just means they died.

If a fetus develops to have a heartbeat and theres a miscarriage, this is technically an actual death. Of course morally we call any miscarriage a death, but in reality that's not actually true.

There are brain dead people who still live without being a able to have a conscious, they are still considered alive due to their heartbeat.

So no, we do not consider life as a conscious. People do not agree with abortion because of morals and feelings, an embryo cannot feel pain nor the lose of a ""life"" just like how a seed wouldn't care nor feel pain if you cut it."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcb0t9l,t1_fcayd1r,1577580448.0,"Cells don't have a heart beat. Once it does it is no longer just a clump of cells, it's a functioning body that can feel pain."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcap7yh,t1_fcaomh1,1577573812.0,"True, When I say living beings, I was only referring to humans.

But plants don't get pregnant so I guessed nobody would assume I meant all life."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcaoj59,t1_fcados0,1577573394.0,"Well she's complaining about not being able to while being pregnant, that should answer that question in itself.

Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted? She's literally demanding the age be lower again for her because it makes being an adult easier while she is carrying a child.

Guess I'm wrong."

insanepeoplefacebook,fcamllh,t1_fcalcwy,1577572241.0,"As a rape victim myself, I had gotten pregnant but miscarried without even knowing I was pregnant in the first place. I had felt like shit for it for years but I realized that I wouldn't have wanted to carry a child that was a result of so much of my trauma, especially when I was only 15.

People who get abortions also feel grief, it's not something that is just done easily like others believe, it's a hard process to figure out your options and understand what's best for you.

Sorry about your past as well."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcam4pv,t1_fcakjj7,1577571966.0,And people say to just give the child up for adoption afterwards. They don't seem to be able to grasp how difficult it must be to stay holding the child in your body that you were already violated from.

insanepeoplefacebook,fcadnn8,t1_fcacqro,1577567456.0,"I agree, I texted him and have been trying to tell him to collect all of this information, she has done far worse things and it pains me to see his child suffer.

 They were about to get court involved but then she came to them high and drunk trying to take the baby and say that he would have to stay until the court date. They do not trust her with the child, nor do I blame them."
