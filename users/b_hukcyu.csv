IWantToLearn,ffgtm8b,t3_ethuxx,1579914742.0,"Something that helps me, is that I kinda force myself to live in the present. Like.. when I'm sitting on the couch thinking about someone I wronged years ago.. or an embarrassing moment from years ago.. I just cant fix those past problems at the current moment. Like, I realize that there are some things that I have to let go and live NOW instead of the past. 

It's tough, but I also have struggled with intrusive thoughts from OCD and it took ALOT to overcome those negative, unwanted, thoughts that kept popping in my head. Something that helped a lot too was listening to this secular buddhism podcast by Noah Rasheda (spellcheck on the name). 

Little techniques you can do everyday like taking note when you say or do something destructive and make a donation jar. Everytime I said or did something negative I would put a dollar into a jar and at the end of the week I would donate it somewhere. Since I am broke, and decided to stick with that practice.. I basically cornered myself into stopping (or mostly stopping) my negative behaviors, including thoughts. 

Good luck on your journey!"

musicproduction,ffewen9,t1_ffdyn7k,1579868313.0,"Whoah gearsluts... I havent been on there in forever I forgot that was a thing... and yeah, tbh this is probably very unconventional but I have been doing my mixes using multiple different consumer level headphones, mainly because when I was younger I couldnt afford studio headphones, so i had to use basic $20 dollar sonys or my gaming headset, etc. 

My logic is that 90 percent of consumers will be using consumer headphones to listen to our tracks and if it sounds good in all my pairs of headphones and across all my consumer speaker products (car stereo, tv, bluetooth, etc) all at different eq settings and environments then I dont need to spend money on expensive stuff.

But now that I am a little better off I still have a nice pair of studio headphones, I just still use my old tricks."

unpopularopinion,fbh662w,t3_ed9s80,1576866210.0,"I was a vegan for two years before my body started deteriorating. Yes, I had supplements, fresh raw food, etc. I had my 50 grams of protein a day and all my vitamins. I felt like absolute shit by the end of the second year and started eating meat again. I eat less now because the meat fills me up more, so I agree. If its between a couple cuts of chicken or 3 cans of beans, I'm gonna choose the chicken now because it makes me fuller so I'm spending less. I would have to eat SO much on a vegan diet to feel even remotely full. I was basically still starving myself and my brain was foggy all the time. Now I feel great. Veganism is a passing fad for woke people that will most likely go back to eating meat again after a few years because it deprives us of essential nutrients."
