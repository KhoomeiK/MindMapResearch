theXeffect,fezyf3w,t3_eqypk8,1579463248.0,i’m proud of you! :)
WeListenToYou,fezxd79,t1_feyg4zo,1579462918.0,"i second this. i’ve struggled with depression pretty much my entire life. i’ve only recently realized that if you want to improve yourself (FOR yourself) you gotta just start doing the things you know are objectively helpful to human beings even if you don’t want to and eventually it just kind of becomes habit. also, most things almost never take as long as you think. sometimes i try to time myself to see how fast i can do something just so it can be over faster haha. 

in addition, think of your future self like you do your past self. at this point you’re basically not even the same person and that will continue to happen as you grow and shift with life-altering changes like this. i started thinking about this concept as drunk/sober me. “thank you drunk me for putting tylenol and water next to my bedside table before passing out.” so the idea is current you is looking out for future you by going through the motions of getting help and staying active and seeking out companionship. also, check out r/EOOD. 

also helpful is just making things fun for no reason other then why the fuck not. gotta do the dishes? gonna blast michael jackson greatest hits and dance around like no one can see me (because no one can see me. except my dog and she’s just as weird so who is she to judge). 

i hope this ramblings are helpful, op. hinge your happiness/identity to yourself own wagon and it will be less devastating when people come and go, as they tend to do. 

ps: consider getting a pet again! they’re great ice breakers."

Petioles,fet8kji,t3_eqjqeo,1579372774.0,"i tried switching to a 1:1 ratio of cbd-thc and keep decreasing the thc from there. 3:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, etc. i live in a legal state though, so i hope you have access to some level of options like that! even if you alternate the two, smoke till you’re kinda high and then use the cbd for the like “oral fixation” for lack of a better term. i felt like i couldn’t just cold turkey and stop because i enjoyed the entire experience. i found continuing to have the experience just with mostly cbd was helpful to not get too high but not have to stop the ritual entirely."

makeuporganization,fdxy3be,t1_fdtd1ov,1578774094.0,"that was mine too! obviously i know sewage backups are a thing, but it never really occurred to me as something i would come back to. bug infestation, mold overgrowth, fire, flooding—my brain went there. raw sewage?? nope.

MadeMeSmile,fdxcw5t,t1_fdxa08c,1578767532.0,my husband and i have a sort of unwritten rule that pretty much boils down “have you eaten? no? probably not actually that mad then. better have a snack and discuss.”
makeuporganization,fdtato1,t1_fdt7tlu,1578714170.0,"i don’t know either honestly, but i guess it’s worth a try? i mean, if a smell is just tiny particles of whatever the scent is from, wouldn’t that mean all my brushes, etc. are coated in microscopic fecal matter particles?? hella not tryna get pinkeye."
