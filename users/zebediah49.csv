- If the player is standing on a bridge tile when damaged by a train,
 - negate the damage
 - move the player to be a non-colliding entity type

An underground belt is a N-long belt segment, where the middle is entirely missing.  So, the first and last squares of the underground belt actually exist in the world, but the rest is just the data structure, with no corresponding location in the world.  In effect, it's a teleporter with a time-lag.

Similarly, an underground pipe is just a pair of ends that share a fluid box.  Nothing actually exists in the space between them.

This means that only items can use underground belt mechanics.  For everything else, it just appears to be two segments of belt with nothing in between.

The video is scanned at the source, and encoded as an analog electrical signal.  That's then somehow transmitted over (radio, or retail tapes, or whatever), into the TV.  The TV then outputs that signal.

Note that the signal format for analog video is *very* specific to the display hardware.  There is zero storage in these things, not even for a single frame.  The CRT starts scanning across the first line of pixels, and the brightness/color value is directly controlled by the video signal.  There's then a gap with no data, to let the electron gun reset to the next line, and then that line blasts into the screen.

So, if you want to record this signal, it makes sense to do it with as little modification and processing is practical.

Thus, VHS.  Take the signal, send it into a magnet while the tape goes by, and it will imprint itself on the tape.  Run the tape by a sensor, and it'll convert it back to that same signal.

- Fuel is generally less reactive with hot metal than air (you don't want to burn the hot internals of your nozzle, due to forcing air over it.

Scaling is really the big one (also, atmospheric).

People are saying that starlink can do gigabit.. okay, sure.  To me.  What about to the dozen internet subscribers within 100' of me?  I live in place with north of 1k people/sq mile.  If we figure 4 people average, and the 190GB/month average per bill in the US, is 150kB/s/person.  Multiply that out, and we're looking at 1.2gbit/s/sq mile, across wide portions of the country.  Average.  Peaking is quite a big higher, I don't know the numbers.  And it doesn't take into account any ""special"" customers.

With fiber, I can get 10gbit down a fiber.  The NICs are dirt cheap. If that's not enough, I can burn a bit of cash and start pushing DWDM channels down that little yellow cable.
