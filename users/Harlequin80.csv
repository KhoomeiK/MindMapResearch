Bees are brutal though, if you hive is queenless the workers will turn a heap, say up to 10, larva into queens. The first born of those queens then goes around and murders all the other unborn queens. Then she goes off for her mating flight, where if the mating is successful the male has his bits ripped off and dies

Then once back in the hive she is an egg machine laying up to 1500 eggs a day. But dont you dare slack off Queenie!!! Because if you get a bit old and slow the workers will raise another queen and suffocate you to death!"

aww,fdmbjts,t1_fdmb4fl,1578544765.0,"Find the existing queen, remove her, and put your new queen in.

The new queen goes in a little container with vents and a candy plug and is put in the hive. She will eat the candy from one side and the workers will eat from the other. By the time the plug is gone the old queens pheromones will have been replaced with the new queens, and away you go.

If you just remove the queen the workers will detect there is no queen in the hive and will then work to turn one of the babies into a new queen. As long as you have larva under 3 days old youre ok. Of course if you do this you will get genetics similar to the old queen, so they are likely to be poor temprement. It takes about 16 days for a larva to become a queen."

I wear a suit when I physically open up the hive and poke around inside.

When I am mowing near the hive I will wear a veil as the mower stirs them up.

That said you get queens that are known for being docile.  It is possible to get queens that have grumpy hives that crack it when you get close.  So in that case you re-queen the hive to calm them down.

When you see bees foraging like they would on these flowers they will completely ignore you unless you stood on them.  Also keep in mind that bees die when they sting, unlike wasps or ants, so they need a far bigger reason to do it."

I know it's convoluted.  And it's a drawback of our governmental structure.

Firefighting is a province of the states.  Funding for NAFC has to come from the states.  Currently the states fund it to about $140 million, and the feds contribute $15m per year, via the states, with additional payments of 11m being done in december of 19 and december of 18.

brisbane,fdccyl9,t1_fdccb35,1578271887.0,"Genuinely the funding request needs to follow this path.

NSW RFS --> NSW State Parliment --> Australian Federal Govt.

It has to follow that path.

Then funding distribution has to go

Feds --> NSW State --> NSW RFS.  

This is the setup of the Australian government and the basis of the constitution.

The exceptions to that are where states have already agreed to devolve responsiblity to the feds.  The only relevant thing here is aerial fire fighting equipment which is funded and managed by the feds.

As it stands there isn't the NSW --> federal request step.

Just because there are people screaming out for the federal government to give them money doesn't mean the can, or that they should.  Our whole country is setup as a federation of states, and there have been multiple court cases to test this.

brisbane,fdcbu5c,t1_fdcayo5,1578271178.0,"In principle I agree with you.

Morrisons handling of his holiday, the photo ops and his inability to articulate has been frankly painful to watch.  I actually think people would have been ok with the holiday if they hadn't tried to hide it.  Personally I want us to move away from the cult of personality which we have had since late Howard / Rudd and move back to ministers being the experts on their portfolio and the PM deferring to those ministers.  One person can't be the expert on everything.

I am really hoping these fires will trigger a move to action on climate change.  It might be a completely baseless hope, but I think it is a wedge issue for the LNP and potentially one they will need to move on.

As for leadership, 100% agree.  Morrison has fallen on his face and doesn't know how to stand back up.  But when you try to make your protest about too many things, and target it at the wrong person it won't succeed."

Australia shares its  aerial fire fighting capabilities with the US and Canada. Because traditionally the fire seasons don't overlap. 

Even if Morrison had given 500m on the day he was elected there wouldn't be additional aircraft in the air.

movies,fcsgu83,t1_fcrhi4l,1577916332.0,"Writing a text wall at the start of a movie to change the fundamentals of a universe is not good writing, and doesn't justify you just running off and doing what ever you want.

The replicants had a specific life span for multiple reasons.  The biggest one being Tyrell corp hadn't managed to come up with anyway of making one with a lifespan of greater than 4 years despite lots of trying, but also didn't want them to have longer life spans because of risk.  This is added to by ""Do android dream of electric sheep?"" having a 4 year limit.

To turn around and say ""1 year after the events of the original movie we have given replicants open life spans"" absolutely misses the point of the first movie and cannot be held up to be a good thing.  It sure as hell isn't addressing a key point of the original.

What's more is extended lifespans is no special justification  for blade runners.  Simply having replicants is enough.

Re the Las Vegas scene, there was a nuke set off in space, which had the magical mcguffin ability to remove all records of replicants everywhere on the planet.  This nuke managed to remove all offline records, torch papers and then even though it was set off in space causes radiation on the ground.  There is no history of nuclear wars on the planet at all.  Whats more is the nuke went of 29 years before the events of the movie, by which time radiation traces from nukes set off at ground level would be marginal and certainly not justification for the area to be abandoned.

You are trying to fill in the logic gaps in the movie.  There is no evidence vegas was nuked.  There is no rational for everyone to be living in cities.  Industrial farming on mass implies a higher population, yet there are ruins everywhere and an obvious lack of people.

If you want to try and say there was a nuclear war that removed a huge chunk of the population and created ruins you are the one stretching to justify a films failures.
