thatHappened,ff50m1m,t1_ff4w1n8,1579577035.0,"Fr, back in the 20s Jazz was viewed by rich white people as a degenerate group of weed infested people who didn't mind integrating with the black community (since they essentially pioneered Jazz and music is often used as a casual way to proppogate racism).  It was the music that was destroying society before rock and roll came around to also destroy society."

I'm familiar with at best 2 or 3 states laws, and only 2 of them well.

AskReddit,ff23o8d,t1_ff231ru,1579492931.0,"There was a big push in the 90s after the 80s crack epidemic and there is an attempted push right now.  Other than that best I can give for actual attempts is that I was taught in law school that the legal community has had this discussion of whether to be punitive or rehabilitative since the founding, and that it depends largely on how a crime is viewed.  Like now the big push for rehabilitation is in regards to drug addicts.  In the past we've tried to rehabilitate violent offenders.  I know that was a thing in the 70s because of the studies going on in psychology at the time.  To be fair, I'm not super knowledgeable on it past that.  The general idea now is that rehabilitation is better, but in implementation we haven't quite figured out how to economically do it. Also, I imagine for profit prisons make it hard to switch over as well."
AskMen,ff228ar,t1_ff1xxuy,1579491823.0,This isn't creepy at all.  No sir.  Perfectly whatever the opposite of totally fucking creepy is.

AskReddit,ff21lbu,t1_ff20gz2,1579491342.0,"Well, if it is, look up laws on removal from the registry or expungement of juvenile records. Most states I know of have laws or a system in place to get your name off the list for certain crimes after a period of time or if the charge was removed from your record.  I know the firm I work for has done similar things for clients in the past, though I tend to avoid criminal defense when I can. Closest I have in experience is restoration of constitutional rights for ex convicts."
AskReddit,ff21cc5,t1_ff20au7,1579491156.0,"I mean, sex in front of people (maybe, you would have needed a victim and in most states police can't be victims for lewd and lacivious behavior crimes) is a bit different than a disabled boy peeing behind a tree."
AskReddit,ff216ey,t1_ff20n2s,1579491034.0,"It would have to be a combination of an overly zealous or spineless prosecutor mixed with a very pushy and upset ""victim"" in a state with absurdly written laws and a judge who either completely missed the point and public policy of a sex offender list or claims their hands are tied due to terribly written statute in a poor attempt to convince legislature to change the law.  I mean, maybe if the victim was politically influential in a small town where that matters.  Otherwise I still find it difficult to believe.  But then again, what the hell do I know?  If it is real, I feel bad for the kid."
AskReddit,ff20x40,t1_ff206s8,1579490847.0,"Well, I can see that.  In a lot of states statutory rape is a strict liability crime which means essentially there is no real defense other than you didn't do it.  But urinating behind a tree with a mental disability as a defense is exceedingly difficult for me to believe."

It's only medicinal in my state but I feel like a good 1/2 only get their card so they can get high.

niceguys,fdtkvmt,t1_fds4cna,1578718230.0,"I don't know. While local bands can sometimes be fun for me I get bored of the mediocrity (I don't mean to sound mean, but there's usually a reason they're still local. Though I have seen some gems).  Metallica was actually pretty fucking good in 2018. James voice sounded better than it did in the early 2000s. Not golden era good, but close.  And then S&M2 was fun because my nephew and I did a road trip out to San Francisco and made a whole weekend of it, plus they were fucking Amazing at S&M2.  So I can see why the tickets seem expensive, but both provide cherished memories for me, so I consider it worth it."
niceguys,fds1lsw,t1_fdrqv2d,1578692978.0,"Shows are priced at what people are willing to pay.  The more your popularity grows the more you can charge.  Some bands have to set a minimum price because of the venue, etc.  I saw Rush for 25 bucks, but they're not as commercially big as Metallica right now.  I have no idea what my friends tickets included but they definitely weren't nice seats so I dunno.  An event like Metallica is something I'll do once or twice a year, I'll see other shows as well, but yeah it's just how the market works."
niceguys,fdrlsru,t1_fdri3fu,1578686364.0,"Yeah but why would I go to a full on Metallica concert every week?  Metallica is actually pretty reasonably priced compared to some other big name bands.  You can get crappy seats for 75 bucks to see Metallica.  My friends went to see Coldplay when I was in HS and their crappy seats cost 250 a pop, and that was in 2006."
niceguys,fdrenj5,t1_fdrajye,1578683485.0,Metallica tickets range from 75 to 500 bucks depending on the concert and where you're sitting.  I paid 150 a ticket for general admission floor spots when I saw them a couple years ago and about 200 a ticket to see S&M2 last year.

While she said women definitely had women's rights issues on a social level over there, she was still a judge.  That's far from property.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcr4i0h,t1_fcr2xme,1577896666.0,"I think the point is it is a super complex issue.  While I think it's ignorant to say all white people go through a racist phase, and most people probably say it to make themselves feel better, I also try not to blame someone who has changed their views and is being an ally now.  It sucks that forgiveness is necessary, but I don't foresee a more equal future without it.  Sure, don't forget, we need to be aware of the history, it's bad to ignore it in my opinion, but if someone is genuinely trying to be better, a little forgiveness can go a long way.  Of course, I'm white, so I didn't experience racism the same way POC have, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  I never went through a racist phase myself despite having racist family members, but credit much of that to my mom and dad, and growing up in a diverse community.  It's hard to be racist when half if not more of your friends are POC (at least it should be).  But I also recognize that being white will bias my perception of it all simply because I don't know what it's like to be in a person of color's shoes."
