birthcontrol,ff3nfpb,t3_erek3d,1579544795.0,Do you have the option of going to a local Planned Parenthood? They may be able to reduce the cost.
UnresolvedMysteries,fen7gqu,t1_fel1a5g,1579278641.0,"I agree with your take on Maura Murray. To me, she likely hit her head in the accident and was highly confused and not thinking straight. Witness reports state her as reporting not to call the policy and say she had called AAA when she in fact did not. This would indicate two things to me -   
A: She was driving under the influence, which would further explain her confusion  
B: Hypothermia had set in and her resulting confusion from the accident was exacerbated (this is more likely to me).   


I think she wandered off into the woods for help and got a ways in before eventually succumbing to the elements."
progresspics,femrnwt,t3_epyld9,1579267652.0,Congrats on getting clean - it always warms my heart when I see someone fighting the good fight! You got this.
gratefuldoe,fekyekf,t3_eplvyz,1579210179.0,Submit it! It looks like a promising match.
birthcontrol,fejtalt,t1_feib1td,1579185324.0,"I didn't notice any difference in pH at all - honestly, aside from feeling strings, I haven't noticed anything major. There IS a period where you have some brown discharge (it's very thick) after the IUD is inserted - this is normal and goes away. It's just a result of your body adjusting. In terms of pain tolerance, I'd say I'm fairly normal. My two insertions were VERY different though - the first one hurt a lot, the second was uncomfortable but tolerable. It really depends on your body. Even if it is very painful for you, it literally lasts less than a minute and goes by very quick."
birthcontrol,fehku93,t3_ep2m82,1579118587.0,"I've had a copper IUD for five years now, and I love it. Insertion was painful, but not terrible. I recommend scheduling the insertion appointment at the end of your period (your cervix will be the softest and most open) and taking 600mg ibuprofen about an hour before the appointment. The first period I had after insertion was...unpleasant, and quite painful. The second after insertion was not nearly as bad. Aside from a few more cramps around that time of the month, I have no side effects."

femalefashionadvice,feabgrl,t1_fe9vs12,1578946630.0,"Maybe look into Aerie? Their jeans are usually a tad too long on me, and I have a 32 inch inseam. I always cuff their jeggings for this reason."
birthcontrol,fe2s6yl,t3_encw5m,1578842320.0,I've taken the pill with no side effects and it worked. Everyone is different.
knitting,fe2pjpz,t3_ennspm,1578841502.0,"The average person isn't going to notice these mistakes, so I wouldn't worry about that. The scarf is still beautiful! If you really are bothered however, redo it! It'll be good practice."
fatlogic,fdquj94,t1_fdqmixr,1578675131.0,"There is no problem with it, but I tend to avoid it since it's so high in calories. I'd rather eat something less calorie dense so I feel fuller. It's easy for me to dump 300 calories of mayo alone in a single serving of tuna salad, whereas when I use full fat Greek yogurt, I'm consuming less than a third of that."
fatlogic,fdqkg61,t3_em3jx5,1578668830.0,I'd like for these people to look at photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents and see how many of them were morbidly obese (especially their great grandparents).
madisonwi,fdqighb,t3_em6l9a,1578667472.0,"I'd say your best bet is to look for private homes that are rented out rather than apartment buildings - in my experience, they tend to have less carpeting than apartment buildings. Walk around the areas you're interested in during the springtime and look for 'For Rent' signs, as a lot tend to be owned by private landlords who don't advertise online."
fatlogic,fdqcoiz,t1_fdp25jq,1578663107.0,This is it! For me to have the amount of moisture in the salad I like (leaving in water doesn't cut it) I'd need around 3tbsp mayo...adding 300 calories on! With Greek yogurt it's only around 75-100.
fatlogic,fdqcl5x,t1_fdpr5sp,1578663028.0,"Ah, that is also a great idea! I hate the texture too so buy dry curd cottage cheese occasionally to mix in, but never thought of blending the other stuff."
fatlogic,fdpng7f,t1_fdoz9nt,1578633691.0,"I didn't give up mayo, but I try to avoid most days it due to how calorically dense it is. I'd rather spend my calories on things like cheese or dark chocolate!"
fatlogic,fdnytck,t1_fdn6geh,1578595610.0,Venezuela too! I heard the average person lost 20 pounds in a year due to food scarcity. I guessing starvation mode never kicked in for them.
fatlogic,fdnyei8,t3_emav3d,1578595372.0,I just discovered that full day Greek yogurt makes a wonderful substitute for mayo in tuna salad...I'm so happy to have tuna salad again! I'd given it up because of the mayo.
HarlotsHulu,fdnffyl,t3_em5hx9,1578584667.0,"I honestly think they are going to leave it on a good note. Honestly, I feel that after Charlotte's death, ending in season 3 was a wise decision. I liked the show, and I'm sad it's over, but I'd rather it end on a good note rather than it keep going until people stop watching it."
gratefuldoe,fdksncj,t3_elwjz2,1578510321.0,"A LOT matches up here - dates, height, weight, etc. She went missing in 2005 and Jane Doe was found three years later. She likely could have been a victim of trafficking, or a runaway. I know that Milwaukee is a HUGE trafficking hub for the Midwest, so it's not far fetched that she could have ended up in the area as a victim or endangered runaway. I would definitely submit it as a possible match."
femalefashionadvice,fdkc2wq,t3_eligni,1578500719.0,"I carry a backpack frequently. I like to have a bottle of water and a book, plus I pack my own lunch to work. I can also use it instead of a bag at the grocery store. It's far more practical. For days I want to dress up, or if I have an event, I can take a purse, but for everyday use, a backpack works best for me."
birthcontrol,fdgobhy,t3_el78g4,1578403877.0,"Copper IUD. I've had one for six years now and LOVE it. Your first couple of periods after insertion will be more unpleasant than normal, but your body adjusts."
fatlogic,fdf651i,t3_ekk3u2,1578354187.0,I was fat at 5'6 and 190...
madisonwi,fdcmt94,t3_eklfva,1578278809.0,Welcome to Madison! What part of town are you living in?
childfree,fcxo9a2,t3_ejf7tf,1578067630.0,"Are you into outdoor/fitness activities? I find that meetings/outings that center around things like hiking/biking/climbing/running/etc generally don't tend to involve alcohol.   


Otherwise, I have seen suggestions for alcohol free Meetups and such. If you are in a larger city, there may be a dry bar open now, as they are trending - perhaps start your own Meetup group that meets in one of those?"
casualknitting,fcue6ic,t3_efk403,1577978843.0,"In this situation, if people are asking they get me something for a specific hobby, I'll send them a link or show them exactly what it is I want. I've had it happen where people will buy me things for hobbies, and while they're close, they'll still get the entirely wrong thing and it ends up being a waste of money for them because it never gets used. Otherwise, ask for something else not related to your hobby that is much harder to get wrong."
SixFeetUnder,fcof2av,t3_ei06th,1577830680.0,"I don't think he is an overall terrible person...but I think his actions are pretty deplorable. He's used to coasting by on his looks and charm and never really grows out of it, and is always looking for the next best thing around the corner. There are good things about him - I think he would make a good friend, but a terrible partner/husband. He's too self-involved to really commit himself to anyone outside of his immediate family."
BPDlovedones,fcnvfv8,t3_ei49a7,1577819218.0,She liquidated about 30k in mutual funds and left utility bills unpaid for months in her husband's name (they were divorcing) before her suicide. He still has no idea where the money went and then had to pay 6k in taxes on the money that was cashed in.
