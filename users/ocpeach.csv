I get the feeling where it just seems never ending, but yeah we have to just keep pushing."

depression,fd7esdg,t1_fd788q5,1578203347.0,"I totally get it. I’m going through a depressive episode myself (not in the same realm as yours, but still one none the less) and it’s EXHAUSTING.
Everyday is a struggle and a fight but please just keep pushing. Give it more time, how long have you been on meds? Maybe see a new counselor if you can ... I’m not a therapist but I think you’ve certainly identified you have this void in you and there is clearly something deeper there and it’s really good you’re working on it and exploring it. It’s so fucking annoying to feel like you’re working so hard with no result but sadly, there is no quick solution, not even suicide. :(

It has to be day by day <3"
Anxiety,fd7edwh,t1_fd7dgs7,1578203162.0,Yes me too! I don’t want to die though.... just like go away and really just throw my brain away too lol
Anxiety,fd7ebkp,t1_fd77a6m,1578203134.0,"omg The Smiths song is one of my FAVORITES. It’s so beautiful/sad and just ugh... I love it.
Especially because they use it in the museum scene from Ferris Bueller and it makes me feel this sad peace if that makes sense lol."
Mindfulness,fd7e443,t3_ejy7bw,1578203050.0,"Needed this.

Going through a situational depressive episode and my mom is a total mediation lover and for years tried to get me to do it, but I thought it was stupid, useless, and not for me — turns out I wasn’t desperate enough.
I’m terrified of the future, but feel a peace knowing I’m going to do whatever and try whatever to feel better!"
depression,fd77cql,t3_ek8a13,1578200383.0,"1. I love you. Yes— I don’t know you, but I love you.
That might not mean much, but it’s true. I wish you didn’t have this pain and turmoil and I just wish I could scoop you up and let you just cry cause that’s what I need right now too. 
2. I hear you, I see you, and I want you to know your feelings are valid.
3. I haven’t “cured” myself from this depressive episode but I do feel more hopeful than I did before and that’s because I am working at utilizing all methods to work and improve myself. 
One book I read was the positive advantage, and it was really great, though I need to read again and take notes because it really is amazing how perspective changes everything. Depression makes us perceive everything as dark — black and white — pain and suffering or nothing. However, I know that there are glasses out there that help people see color — medication, therapy, self help, meditation etc. Well, I have a couple pairs of those glasses and I have seen a glimpse of the hopeful beauty out there, but I’m not done yet, I still have to learn what all the colors I’m seeing are.

So my whole metaphor shpiel is to tell you, it’s not going to be easy now, but if you’re willing to hold on to even a glimmer of motivation and hope, slowly you will start to see the colors back in your life (I hope).

It’s cliche and it sucks, but you HAVE to start with small goals. What helped me is I got a daily planner. It’s broken down hourly and when I was at my LOWEST low, I would literally make goals like “put makeup on and make the bed” simple things that depression makes harder. So maybe for you it’s just “text a friend”.
Texting a friend doesn’t have to jump right too, force myself to get coffee with friend... give yourself grace. 

Slowly the more you feel better, positivity and people gravitate towards that because you yourself attract it."
Anxiety,fd760sf,t1_fd75anl,1578199887.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate it.
Sometimes hearing that someone who doesn’t even know you cares, feels better than people who do. Can’t explain it but it does ❤️"
Anxiety,fd6kfdf,t3_ek6axv,1578192356.0,"Me too. I keep commenting the same thing on others post because I’m glad to see i’m not the only one.
The memes and jokes aren’t funny since this time it kinda has an effect on me 
I’m really scared since I have family in Iran (good people, not for the regime) and I’m terrified I’ll never see them again and even if they are safe, I don’t see how they would be able to come to the US anytime soon. I have many friends that are active duty military too and I’m really scared of losing them as many are combat. It feels different when it’s not a place you are “connected” to but America is everything to me but I do have family in Iran. My mom tells me not to worry but my anxiety is already so bad and the thought of a World War is fucking shaking me and I was a history major so I know how bad it gets 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Like I was so young during the beginning of the last one and my boyfriend was actually in combat in Afghanistan but I didn’t know him until after so I never felt like truly scared and was kind of far removed.

I’m literally crying and no one is taking it seriously. My military friends are joking and of course they signed up for it and are ready but people making jokes about killing Iranians is scaring me. The Iranian people don’t want this!!!! I’m sorry for the long comment I’m just legit scared too and I’m crying right now and my boyfriend isn’t taking is seriously and my parents and everyone says I’m over dramatic, I mean they aren’t worried about their family? And Iran has mandatory military service and a majority HATE the Islamic Republic but are going to be forced to fight and die for these disgusting leaders. Lastly, I’m being selfish, but I don’t want people in the US to start hating me and bullying me again. My whole life I have to try to laugh off jokes about me being a terrorist and I sadly had to learn that at age 7.

Sometimes I wish I was just white and that my whole family was white."
depression,fd6jl33,t1_fd3dc09,1578192027.0,"Awh thanks :) I try to be. 
Funny how we can be so loving to others and so bad to ourselves."
Anxiety,fd31vsa,t3_ejsckx,1578153937.0,"Iranian-American, with family in Iran... love you and am thinking so hard about the Iranian people.
That regime is fucked but the Iranian people are good and I hope it’s going to be okay. I also don’t want our troops to have to get hurt either so I’m so worried"
Existential_crisis,fd06t6y,t3_ejnfql,1578114495.0,"let me know, I am still wondering 😂
but it’s pushing me to do a lot of work on myself and explore outlets for my anxiety etc.
I’m reading that popular Jordan Peterson book... I’m not taking into consideration people’s opinions of him, I’m going off of desperately seeking some guidance and help!"
Anxiety,fd06i5i,t1_fcyd3ac,1578114359.0,"yes and I love our troops and have many friends in the US military and I know they are ready and that’s what they sign up for but it’s so scary, I worry about them and your father just as much :(

My anxiety just doesn’t need more to be afraid of and I HATE all the memes!! Really wishing for it to all be okay and for your father to return safely ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Anxiety,fcxolv2,t3_ej90dr,1578067855.0,"I’m so sorry to hear this.
I’m an Iranian-American and I woke up scared too because I don’t want everyone to hate us when the Iranian people don’t like this regime!! I’m so afraid of the US going to war and I hate that it seems inevitable that every so often we have a war and I’m so afraid of something happening to innocent people, I just wish only the horrible people would suffer.
I already have a daily war in my mind, and I don’t want to worry about a real one. When Iraq/Afghanistan started I was a child so by the time it went on and on I was desensitized but now this is scary and twitter and memes don’t fucking help."
Anxiety,fcuu1ob,t3_eiydnk,1577988490.0,"I never drink heavily but we had a New Year’s Eve Party (me trying to force myself from just hiding and being in a ball) and I drank WAY too much  and I woke
up with the worst anxiety and depression, even though at the time it can make you feel FREE AND GREAT It’s.not.worth.it and it was a reminder as to why I don’t drink heavily or more than 1-2 drinks in a social setting.

I don’t personally don’t have social anxiety so I don’t really need it anyways so yeah, it just makes me sick and feels awful and I don’t even crave it so I’m fine drinking very little and could honestly never have alcohol again and be fine."
bathandbodyworks,fag0442,t1_faexwfj,1576036345.0,"Yes!! ugh it’s so unique .. I feel like all the scents now are bakery or berry and even though that scent had “berry” in it, it wasn’t as fruity as it sounds!!
Raspberry Sugar smells similar from the bottle but when I sprayed it on me it was not great :/ oh well, i’ll just keep hoping and savoring what little I have left lol"
