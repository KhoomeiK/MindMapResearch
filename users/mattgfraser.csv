Ayahuasca,fdsfb60,t3_ems9jl,1578701436.0,">  But what I remember mostly about the ceremony that I didnâ€™t want to die and I had a lot to do in this world. 

And are you doing it? 

After my time in ceremony I came back to daily life and things were good for a couple weeks, and then it was like the experiences I went there to gain insight to were amped up in my life. This was a difficult process to go through but lead to me making the changes I was shown in ceremony, mainly the difficult choice to quit a job that was draining my energy.  
Answer for yourself what are the things you have to do in this world and start. If the medicine has shown you to eat healthier, begin. If you need to stop smoking marijuana, stop. Need to create more connection with others? Begin generating that.

While you may have cleared a lot of anxiety and negative energies I think it is an oversight to believe you will go back to regular life anxiety free. Stresses and triggers are still there. The medicine has incredible healing potential but you still need to do the work. You won't go back to a situation that caused you anxiety and not feel anxiety without still making the conscious effort to change your interpretation and response to the situation.

Wish you the best in this process."
alchemy,fcp0i49,t3_eicl2p,1577846742.0,"Refer to Robert Bartlett's work. Spagyrics involves the separation, purification, and recombination of the essences of a substance/material. A tincture uses the water and/or alcohol extracts, while spagyrics goes further to extract the mineral essence and recombine it into the tincture for a higher level/more fully integrated end product."
RationalPsychonaut,fcaeox9,t3_eebqb0,1577567950.0,"Thanks for your share. With school, was it a program you are passionate about or more a society/family expectation you've accepted that you should go to school - get a degree - end up in career? I followed the latter after high school and while I got through my undergrad it was a struggle. In my experience teacher's are pretty understanding and willing to give an extension if you let them know ahead of time about stress/difficulties.

Your recognition of the situation and willingness to improve are excellent signs, insight into yourself is a very helpful tool. As are mushrooms. Ultimately the work will have to come from You; mushrooms can open your mind to new insights and with micro-dosing can help install new patterns over time - but new patterns won't create themselves without effort and consistency on your part. You likely know this but just a reminder.

Sounds like you are well on your way to creating the change you wish to experience. Allow time for it to manifest and don't hold to any expectations, just a gentle anticipation ::)"
