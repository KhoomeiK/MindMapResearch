depression,ff80hxp,t3_es3msr,1579662806.0,Music is so powerful. I still can't listen to certain songs the same way. I had Asleep by The Smiths playing nonstop the days leading up to my attempt. It's too much.
Anxiety,ff3nx5i,t3_ercttk,1579545090.0,"Dating can be so difficult, let alone with anxiety, and I'm so proud of you being able to go and have a good time for yourself!"
arizonapolitics,fenfgzn,t1_fekcda9,1579283556.0,She probably gained some IMO. Gotta get into Trump's coalition quick before the conservatives decide to finally throw Kelli Ward into the Senate.

depression,fek6xa0,t3_eph52w,1579193876.0,"Dude do NOT let anyone take that away from you. You accomplished this by yourself, and you now know how to and that you can lose the weight. Super proud of you. Cheers to a life of health and friendship!"
Anxiety,fek6gwm,t3_epe6k3,1579193608.0,"I lurked onto an old friend's account recently and saw a friend that I've had a lot of problems and stress with, and it basically knocked me out for two days. Social media isn't just a waste of time for me any more, it's straight up my menace."
Teachers,fek5esm,t3_epbapl,1579192979.0,I dream of having a schoolmaster that cool when I get my degree. Congrats on having such a supportive admin!
arizonapolitics,fek5910,t3_eplmly,1579192883.0,"Apparently jury isn't holistic to evidence relating to the case, just limited to the evidence presented at impeachment.


Also, love this era of respect for journalism we're in. Really ties together the truth when you can't respond because the journalist is a liberal hack ðŸ˜«"
SandersForPresident,feiz7p2,t3_ep87yl,1579151403.0,"Idc about the moment. I thought both of their responses to the mod's question were holistic and concise. I thought Bernie's response to Warren's personal question was apt. Frankly, so what if Sanders lied when he basically corroborated Warren's point anyway? This is a faux-feud."
arizonapolitics,feiw9ut,t3_ep6xv2,1579148939.0,"I met Ann a few times while she was in recess. I would have never known that she was an alcoholic, let alone drank! Super eye-opening for me, and I'm glad she's getting help. One of the most challenging things to do when you have a serious problem."
antiwar,fdj3wo1,t1_fdi7xdt,1578457768.0,Someone missed the whole point
depression,fapt41b,t3_ea539h,1576293037.0,"I understand how that feels. It can be hard if you have no actual treatment plan in place to help fish you out of it. I know it's been hard for me my whole life.


Along with the small, achievable goal setting, the bare minimum I do is trying out some small hobbies. I read and write, do poetry, I try to stay not shit at playing guitar. Something small and inconsequential helps me to remember that I can at least do something during a day! I also started trying to enjoy small nothings, like playing video games and watching movies. I get too depressed to even do that, but when I make a plan to I feel great about it.


It's ok to have bad days. It's ok to have nothing but bad days. You're ok for being and feeling the way you are."
