depression,femg2g6,t1_fema08e,1579253645.0,"It's selfish to expect people to take care of your mental illness 24/7. Those who take care of such people have their own problems and issues too. What IS selfish is being entitled to the world and people to serve you care and protection while you take it for granted. It is absolutely fine not to want to bear a responsibility and problems that are not even yours to begin with, especially when they weigh down your own mental health and life. Think of me as selfish or whatever you want, but people are not entitled to other people ripping their ass to keep you happy and at bay from suicide."
depression,felj7bj,t1_fekgxee,1579223467.0,"Some people really don't want to deal with other peoples depression and that's fine. They're not obligated to. It can be very daunting and exhausting, especially when you watch people you care about slowly kill themselves from the inside and nothing you do seems to help or be appreciated. Hope you find a better partner."
confession,fe18uhj,t3_enj7da,1578823874.0,"That was a shitty thing to do. These things are private for a reason. Next time, keep your hands to yourself and perhaps guilt won't have to eat you alive."
socialskills,fdv69la,t1_fdu2wkf,1578743805.0,So what are you going to do to help yourself then? The advice is pretty solid.
depression,fdq8yjv,t3_emnbdm,1578659687.0,"Divorce if you don't open your relationship? To HELL with her, how god damn VILE. Either way, do whatever is best for you and your child, it's horrible that you have to go through this mess. Don't worry about heartbreak and not being able to open up to others, there are billions of people out there and I can guarantee that most of them are a thousand times better to talk to than your wife. I know it hurts, I know you loved your wife dearly, but don't ruminate on it. Why let yourself keep being beaten down and taken advantage of by a person who does not care, who does not feel the same as you do? To hell with the wife.

Make your daughter the light of your life, be strong and get through this for her. You can do this."
