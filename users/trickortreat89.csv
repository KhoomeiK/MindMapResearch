AskReddit,ff9a1od,t3_es53p0,1579708267.0,"I often find that I respond to what someone says, with talking about how I feel about that myself. Is that being self-centred or boring? I try not to, but I suffer from social anxiety, so I'm not always in control of what I might say when getting stressed out, and social interaction makes me stressed out, no matter how little. Oh, and I also often talk about negative stuff or don't talk at all. Guess I'm really freaking boring"
socialanxiety,ff89u4a,t3_es42g8,1579670290.0,"Well, I feel like this whenever there is people in the room, especially if I cannot see where they are exactly looking. Then I totally feel someone is watching me, and it feels like I start overthinking every move I make, which makes it terrible clumsy. But if you are definitely alone and still feel this way, it is not anxiety but paranoia, maybe even skizofrenia. You should take that seriously, cause those illness can be extremely terrible, as you'll never feel alone and able to rest."
socialanxiety,ff89i6h,t3_es3k9t,1579669979.0,"This is me too! And when people I know rarely tell something about my personality I always feel they are so wrong, and if they say in example ""Oh, I know you, you love XX"" they are always SO wrong, but it just makes me feel so terrible sad. Just imagining that I'll probably die one day, and no one will care or have any clue about who I actually was."
socialanxiety,ff2r62i,t3_er903p,1579520398.0,"This is me! I constantly have small conversations in my head, as I imagine it could have been like, if I was a better talker. I am just constantly judging myself for the way I speak, so I am always afraid of saying something stupid. And also - yes I AM probably stupid, but I also know that it's just the anxiety not making me want to reveal that part. I see and hear so many other ""stupid"" things everyday, but it's not something I blame others for at all. In fact if someone says something stupid it only makes me more relaxed if anything, cause then I feel it would also be more accepted if I said something stupid too - and my thought is that it would then be everything I say."

GetMotivated,fettlxl,t3_eqhr0b,1579379926.0,"But you also age in different speed throughout your life. You may feel a shift when you enter your 30's or you're in your late 20's, but between that and probably not before you hit your 50's (20 years later) you might not feel that big of a change in your body or mind. So it is completely useless to think you'll become progressively older once you hit 30, cause you'll probably gonna have 20 years of very active years left, to accomplish everything you dream of. Just to compare - when you were between 10 and 30, how much have you not learned and evolved as a person? Now imagine all those years, just being an adult and much wiser."

socialanxiety,fekt2fq,t3_epigcp,1579207019.0,"To be honest, I no longer know what I actually want from people. I've gotten so used to do everything alone, and feeling disconnected emotionally from other groups of people, that I don't know what I can expect to achieve there. Sometimes I feel the urge to be sociable and have friends, but I'm not even sure if it's because it's something I actually want, or if it's just something I feel I should want, because everyone else wants this. But being with people cause me so much pain that I can't really take it either."
news,fekpytl,t3_epi6lz,1579205195.0,"What's going on in Australia at the moment is literally a massacre, and it just seem so much to me, that people don't get the extent of it at all. People just go on with their usual lives after this, maybe talking about ""that though year 2019-20 with all that bushfire"" but in the end, that's all we will get out of it. I just personally don't understand how people can go on after this, how can they afford a new house, new farm and new animals after it's been burned to ashes? Where do they get the money for that from? Do people just have a nice insurance that'll cover it, and then that's it? They rebuild whatever they lost in the fire, and try to forget about it? But to me Australia will never be the same. And nature will probably never fully recover after this, and in a few years I bet it will all happen again. I just feel so hopeless for nature, and seriously don't see how life can be the same as before in Australia."

It's ridiculous, the man is completely saying the opposite of what he said only minutes ago, and no one dares to account him for it in the media?
