TIHI,fegk0zx,t1_fegfhk6,1579095108.0,"Do you know what you can do if it bothers you so much? GET OVER IT.

The only things you have control over are your own behaviors, thoughts and reactions. Spend more time focusing on those, and less on trying to control what internet strangers type into their keyboard.

For fuck’s sake."
kratom,fe68xkw,t1_fe5da1z,1578884381.0,"Gabalentin is commonly abused in the recovery/halfway-house community. I spent 2 years living in halfway houses 5 years ago and a lot of the clients (and the owners) would routinely take 20-30+ pills to try to get high. I’m not sure if I would call it recreational, but it definitely does something"
calculus,fdyn3j8,t1_fdylojn,1578781564.0,"Thank you so much! Multiple people have told me to review Calc II integration so I’m gonna do my best to go deep on that. I spent the past two months going through derivatives from Calc I just to try to get my bearings under me again, so at least the basic integration techniques should come to me pretty easily. 

Time to find a tutor!"
iamverybadass,fdwr0hy,t1_fdwqwqi,1578761479.0,"That is bizarre as well. Your comment is also bizarre. They are not mutually exclusive. You also just included an implication that introverts cannot also be strong, which I do not understand."
iamverybadass,fdwq0n4,t1_fdwnxs2,1578761275.0,This is a bizarre comment

I hope you never smoke DMT again. You may end up regretting that “too strong” comment"

BobLazar,fdc3vas,t1_fd99l23,1578266587.0,Which part of that formula looks complex to you exactly? Is it the addition? Or perhaps raising two variables to the...*gasp*...second power?!
kratom,fcyluu4,t3_ejbrzl,1578082405.0,"This is an incredible story. Thank you for your service, and thank you for sharing that with us. 

This might sound weird coming from an internet stranger, but I’m very proud of you. So many people succumb to the darkness and let it destroy them. I’m proud of you for fighting back.

Be well."
selfimprovement,fcwju7f,t3_ej8ub9,1578027583.0,"Don’t try to do it all at once. Build systems. Start with small daily habits. Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t stick to them every day at first. 

What, specifically, do you want to improve about your life?"

Drugs,fcryoam,t3_eiintf,1577908479.0,"“The Natural Mind” by Dr. Andrew Weil is a fantastic book that helped me overcome a lot of those same worries and concerns.

I think a lot of us intuitively know that there is nothing “wrong” or “bad” about our drug use, but the conditioning by society is strong and sometimes we can doubt ourselves. This book helped a lot because Dr. Weil echoes ideas that are common amongst thoughtful drug-users, and does so with the creditability of a Harvard MD.

I hope that makes sense"
JoeRogan,fcrfqky,t1_fcrf11z,1577901235.0,I believe it has something to do with Joe protecting his time. He has started recording multiple podcasts in a single day and then staggering their release. Given his lifestyle it seems like the only way he can manage to publish them at the volume he does and still fulfill all of his other commitments
JoeRogan,fcrfgqn,t3_eikjog,1577901129.0,"Wow. I’m surprised Elon didn’t make the list

spirituality,fbsfd57,t3_ee7dzi,1577054469.0,You are a beautiful person and I’m happy that you posted this. Agree with the above in regards to reading Jung and Joseph Campbell. I would also add Abraham Maslow and Eckhart Tole to your reading list. “The Power of Now” was the first spark on my spiritual journey.
