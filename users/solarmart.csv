Winnipeg,fe5u588,t3_enk0pg,1578875001.0,If you go to u of m may I recommend donating plasma at Prometic for extra cash? You get $25 per donation and can go twice a week. It doesn't take too long either so it might fit into your schedule.
Anxiety,fdchrgm,t3_eh5a3k,1578275209.0,"My winter semester starts tomorrow and I'm excited and anxious! I recently tapered off Zoloft after being on it for 3+ years, and so far it's okay. I'm a little more anxious, but it might be the discontinuation effects, so I'll wait it out and see.

It's nice having my full range of feelings back (among other things), but I'm a little worried about how I'll be in school. I'll try my best to exercise mindfulness when I'm feeling too intense and remind myself daily that I'm doing my best!"
Winnipeg,fcspbz1,t3_eimbbv,1577921710.0,"Spent 6 weeks inpatient at hsc, and the food is surprising not bad at all. As another user said, bring salt and pepper and hot sauce (if you like it) as some dishes need it, but if you're not there for long, it's not the end of the world. 

If you have the chance to pick your meals, avoid the scrambled eggs at breakfast, it's more like an egg loaf and the boiled eggs are hit or miss. Their mac n cheese is bomb. They also have the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had, and I'm not over exaggerating. The portion sizes are a little small though, and this is coming from someone who was treated there for an eating disorder, but other than that I don't have many complaints. 

Good luck on your surgery OP, I hope you have a well and speedy recovery."

college,fcb135q,t3_egwl0j,1577580619.0,Try to keep them in their own binder if it's an important class or a class I enjoyed. The others get tossed into a box because I'm too lazy to sort through things and keep telling myself I'll do it later.
college,fc83c6y,t1_fc5jevv,1577525852.0,At my university we have signs that warn you about the geese and say to take alternate routes around campus to avoid them.
college,fbzqkzv,t3_eexkun,1577256574.0,"Nice not having to do anything and just relax, but at the same time feel depressed because I'm not being productive. I have been getting my butt out of the house and to the gym more often which is a step in the right direction as far as productivity goes!"
