ww2,ff70rqa,t1_ff63btf,1579638826.0,"Actually, this is not true. The Germans had many more duds, largely because the slave workers that they used to assemble the bombs would sabotage many of them so they would not explode."
ww2,fesuygv,t1_ferwi01,1579369253.0,"So which stories got buried? Hitler giving money to the girl scouts? Or the Emperor giving amnesty to all the US prisoners? 

The Axis powers were evil and they deserve every story told about them."
ww2,fesulp6,t3_eqgy7h,1579369164.0,"Because conventional arms were used. And in the shadow of all of the massive destruction wrought during WW2, it was just another horrible event. 

The atomic bombs were unique. New and horrible, and scientifically amazing. The fact that ONE bomb destroyed a city was unimaginable to the general populace."
todayilearned,fesfq0t,t1_feqqg2k,1579364689.0,"You describe him as a man of integrity and not crazy. He was certainly not a man of integrity. He murdered innocent people by mail bombs. There is no integrity in that. If he had integrity, he wouldn't have done it anonymously. As for the crazy......if you think that man, living in the woods alone, and producing those journals and the bombs, was not crazy, then I really wonder what qualifies in your mind. He may have been brilliant, but that is not mutually exclusive to crazy."

newhampshire,fek9icl,t1_feifygz,1579195409.0,"No the reason to register guns is so that if someone gets killed, we can figure out who did it. If there is illegal activity performed around that gun we might be able to trace that gun. Why would you have a problem with that unless you intend evil actions with that gun?"
newhampshire,fei6c5y,t1_fefhdjb,1579131257.0,Why are you so opposed to registering guns?

politics,fehl7ex,t3_ep46f7,1579118799.0,"I speak as a die hard liberal. Bernie is very old, very left wing, very loud, very annoying, and there is NO way he will win in a national election. All you millennials can scream all you want, but he will not beat Trump. He has alot of baggage, alot of hypocrisy, and is annoying to listen to. I actually support most of his policies, but they will never get through the US Congress, no matter how constituted."
newhampshire,feeeybj,t1_feeero3,1579032367.0,No....lack of gun registration is absurd.

AskReddit,fdwyf5v,t3_en7dgg,1578763516.0,"I utterly disagree, if you read several legitimate, journalistically ethical, intelligently written news sources. The good ones will report what they firmly believe to be the truth, and will retract anything that is proven wrong. They try hard to be accurate. And there are decent ones that skew towards liberal, and some towards conservative. However, I do firmly believe that the majority of sources that are complete bullshit, are generally found in the hard right wing. Breitbart, Fox, Infowars, are a few of the examples."

Stalingrad on the other hand, finished the Germans in Russia. Their failure there was the biggest, most impactful loss of the war. It essentially ended the two front war."

pics,fd9zw78,t1_fd39vkc,1578240046.0,"That is simply not true. WW2 was an existential crisis for the entire world. Japan and Nazi Germany were truly intent on conquering the world, and defeating them was FAR more than a political decision. It was the moral, ethical, and obligatory action necessary to defeat evil."
pics,fd9z89p,t1_fd8v7r1,1578239786.0,"No it is not. That attitude did not exist in the US populace at the time. Nazi Germany and Japan were existential threats. It was the government and its ""America First"" policies coming out of the 30s that caused the desire not to enter the war until Pearl Harbor. The people of the country were all in, once the war was entered. That is completely opposite of the war in Vietnam."

My mother, who lost her first fiance in a B-17 over Germany, had a ""go bag"" all prepared for my brother. She said over and over, she would NOT lose her son to a useless, political war.  

War sucks, and people who have seen it know it."

All the pilots would play at that course, so when they came in on their approaches, they would buzz the course just to fuck with people's drives and swings and be cowboys."

Into the park comes a pair of chihuahuas, who immediately begin barking at everyone (of course). Clyde runs to his human, whines, hides behind his legs and peeks out until the dogs have stopped barking. What a big baby."

Justrolledintotheshop,fc0ks74,t3_efbi3w,1577293200.0,"So I am a wicked dog nut. They love me and I love them. Rather eccentric, older customer named Ray comes in and asks about something in his sync system. So, I told him to wait there, and let me go check it. So I go out to his Navigator, get in and suddenly feel a hot breath on my neck. I turn my head to see a big, huge, German Shepherd who was obviously in the back seat. We make eye contact, I say ""Hi Buddy!"", and give him neck scratches and he kisses my face and as I do that, I see Ray running out of the shop yelling ""Wait...the dog is in the car!!! - Don't go in the car!!"" I looked out from the window, with my arm curled around his big neck, and say, ""He's a good boy!!"". The customer stops in his tracks and says he has never seen anything like that.....the dog only responds to actual German commands, and is usually NOT friendly. And because the dog was sleeping, he completely forgot the dog was in the car. He was a bit disappointed that ""Kaiser"" didn't eat my face, I think. Oh, and Kaiser kept insisting on my scratching his neck while I fixed Ray's sync system. The sync system needed an APIM (surprise!)....Ray needed clarity......and Kaiser needed a cookie."

The only issue I would have, would be when you said that no previous US president has ever lied. Let's not be naive. Plenty of presidents have lied to us including Democrats and Republicans. But that doesn't really matter. You and I both know and everyone else, that Trump lies like no one ever in the history of our nation. He is a vile monster."
