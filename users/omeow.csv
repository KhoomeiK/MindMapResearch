Depends on what is your definition of good economy. If it is economic growth then no. If it is stock prices then meh. If it is unemployment rate then Obama era trends continue. If it is government deficit - then we are in bankruptcy territory.

>And also, Scandinavia has an insanely free free market, their economies are even freer than the US and are trying to stop the EU from implementing minimum wage across the continent. Yes, they have a welfare state, but that doesn’t mean they’re socialist. Countries like France or Belgium may indeed lean a little socialist, however


So, I am confused here. If unbridled capitalism is good then how is Scandinavian good too?  If free market everything is so great then why are US citizens in such shitty health and all welfare state people are living longer?  If free market capitalism is so great then why are people in US dying from opioid addiction and all other welfare states in great shape. If free market capitalism so great the why is the POTUS such a fan of dictators?"

No. Could you honestly name a successful socialist country that wasn't investigated for human rights violations, or had/has a terrible dictator? I can't.

Aren't you confusing communism and socialism.  
Under the current political vernacular in US, most Scandinavian countries , west European countries will be socialist. Your list seems to omit that. 

EDIT: Also putting Cuba, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Algeria, China in the same category seems little misinformed.  Yes they aren't as well developed as Western Europe and United States.  But they also had the disadvantage of being under colonial rule (forced by the Europe and US) and the handicap of not looting the wealth from every continent.

AskReddit,ff9e03a,t3_esd3b7,1579710961.0,"In his time Jesus was not an important person. There are no clear records of him that detail his looks, his personality etc. 

From a PR standpoint, in a world where most people lived in small communities, it is much easier to spread the gospel if Jesus looked like them. Also the medieval times saw a tremendous amount of talented artists depict Jesus in influential art. While probably historically inaccurate these pieces had long lasting effect on our current culture.  That is why Jesus is depicted white with blue eyes and a kind of hair that is very rare in that part of the world. 

It is interesting to compare this with Islam. There were many talented artists in the Islamic world world. But depicting God or the prophet is strictly forbidden (and it has been enforced well)  by most religious sects. As a result even though there are several different interpretations of the  prophets words we don't see his image.
