So you will have to go around a hairpin curve right next to Dorothy's front porch. And with one hand. Because you have to wave at Dorothy. Do not go round that curve without waving at Dorothy and Earl and their dog, Bruce. My goodness, how long have you known their family? Don't be rude!"

TwoXChromosomes,fc6d46a,t1_fc6bgcd,1577477750.0,"Bringing awareness to someone about the dangers of the world is not making them afraid. And I'm glad you have such a positive outlook on society. 

And, sure, it's ok to be afraid of cancer. But don't you do things to reduce your risk of cancer? Not smoking? Getting breast exams? Pap smears? So maybe it's ok to do things to reduce your risk of getting assaulted.

I live in a city in America. I am a woman. I feel relatively safe for a female. I also practice martial arts and carry a knife or brass knuckles when I walk at night. (And during the day, tbh) But I have been approached and threatened by a male, and also followed by a male who taunted me for 2 blocks. 

I am lucky to say I haven't had to use my weapons. Yet. Danger is real. There are bad people out there. Sheltering someone from these real threats is not going to save them."
