However:

You made it perfectly clear that you don't care. You accused me of zealotry. Claimed that I was the kind of atheist who would have people follow my personal dogma. Denied any change or nuance in the term atheist or the language around non-belief. Made a big thing out of activists trying to make a living. Likened ideology to politics. Oh and dismissed the struggle of others.

That said, I'm still responding to you. Possibly because I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe because I actually think that once you can get the fact that I don't care what you believe, we need to get together and show strength, that you'd still be that nice bloke I thought you might be.

Atheist is a great label because it literally means without theism, not against theism, without. Think about it from the other direction, right, the Christian right want to turn your country into a theocracy, and I've lived my entire life moving from theocracy to theocracy, they would all describe themselves as Christian when they want to show strength, not Catholic, mot CofE, not Protestant, they certainly don't identify as members of the Church of our Divine Mother, these technical differences erode at our ability to stand up as a strong and powerful block."

Humanism isn't politics, it's an ideological point based on the values of humans, as I say, it's one I agree with, but me agreeing with it doesn't mean it should be included with politics. Call me old fashioned but democracy should be the basis of politics, the will of the people and all that. A lot of politics will overlap with humanism because we are human but that doesn't make then interchangeable. What you have said is as daft as saying that charity is religious. 

Also you are being exclusionary, you're saying that you're different from other atheists, and your language carries massive undertones of condescension too. 

As for the accusations of zealotry, if attack with zealotry that would make me a zealot. Note that no where here have I told anyone what to think or how to believe or not believe. Honestly, if I thought it would work I would encourage moderates to identify as atheist too, the only way we will shed stigma of not believing is by becoming familiar, not infighting and excluding ourselves from the points. 

You sound like you're a privileged atheist, never had to hide who you are, never been discriminated against for not believing, and good for you if that's the case. It's not like that elsewhere, do we stop fighting for women's rights just because they get a pretty decent deal in the UK? No, we don't and whilst you appear to be well placed to help, your answer is to not get involved, to not give a shit.

You see I can't help it but care when I see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/esdko8/my_11_year_old_daughter_was_attacked_by_a) and [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-man-sentenced-death-atheism-ahmad-al-shamri-hafar-al-batin-appeal-denied-a7703161.html%3famp) but it's ok, because atheist fundamentalists or something.

One day we'll have the same rights simply because we are humans, but we're not there, and I'm sorry but you excluding yourself is part of the problem, not the solution. I would love for the term atheist to be meaningless because quite frankly it says nothing about me, petrolhead, geek, chap, fuck it even bipolar has more descriptive power than atheist, but I didn't get turned down at a job interview in Ireland for owning a car, when I meet my gfs parents they don't ask me if I play videogames. If I go to the middle east or the US I won't face discrimination for wearing waistcoats and unless it's a really backwards place I won't be shunned for having depression. 

Yes, some people earn off being atheist activists, and people make money off being feminists or lgbtq+ activists, you can make a fortune being vegan these days. Fair play to them, let them make their money how they can, I'm not that petty, and I haven't bought the tee shirts. I am a member of the UK Humanist society, but honestly I get far more from that than I donate.

Equal civil rights regardless of your (lack of) religion is something that is important to me, and believe it or not, helping atheists is in the interests of the religious, even if they can't see it. There will be a day when Islam becomes the world's biggest religion, and with all the shit Christianity is pulling in self preservation, the laws will be open to wipe them off the planet. Also, if you think the extent to which primarily Christian countries is poisoning the well, take a look at Islam. In America they will change the history books and science books to promote religious bollocks, and ban atheists from running for office, if Islam gets its way, it'll be beheadings in the town square.

There are no atheist dogmas, no atheist fundamentals, however, there is for humanism. In your desperation to paint atheism as an ideology you've identified as an ideologue, one I agree with, but still. I have kept away from talking about humanism for this exact reason, because humanism has no place in politics either. Secular states would no more adopt humanism than they would Christianity. I'm afraid that you're coming off as ignorant, and I really hope you aren't. 

If you can honestly say to me that people shouldn't fight for freedom from religion as hard as freedom of religion then this is going to be my last post to you. You called me religious and a zealot, for being inclusive of everyone who doesn't believe, because I'm only accepting of people who believe, or more accurately don't believe in the same way I do, but everything I have said has been about the oppositions bigotry."

I hope that where you are, that is the case, that they don't care, I mean. My experience is that the only people who truly don't care are the ones who honestly should, atheists. The religious around here, are extremely mild, but they litter bombed me after I decline JWs into my flat when I told them I was atheist. I live in a progressive part of a largely atheist country.

atheism,ff9t7ag,t1_ff9g38c,1579720733.0,"It is political, yes, because throughout most of the world religion is political, including here in the UK, and we probably have more atheists than anything else here. If a country so popularly atheist still encourages bible study (not comparitive religion), 6 day creation and school lead prayer, then the politics are wrong. We have caveats allowing for Jewish and Muslim children to be left out, but not atheist children.

Also what you say about Dawkins is bollocks, utter bollocks. He doesn't want to be some kind of pope, and he's never said he does, neither has Alice Roberts, he wants religion and politics to be separated, and religion and education to be separated. As does Dr Roberts. We're not here to stamp religion out, it'll do that itself when the time comes, we're here to show that we have a voice, that are a voting demographic. This isn't religion, it's civil rights. Being openly atheist should not be a burden anywhere, and the fact that it clearly is a burden in the progressive western world is a sign that we have a long political fight still ahead of us and we're not even talking about the East where being atheist will get you killed.

Yes it's a political move, and while it's not as bad as other marginal groups have had it, it's still an evil inequality in our world today. If you can dismiss it then you either live in a truly secular society or you simply don't care that the aforementioned atheists in America are being treated like criminals and are being lynched in Pakistan. I certainly hope it's the former, but just as I don't think a Muslim should be mistreated in America, neither should an atheist in Syria."

The best way to look at it is in a court room setting, there's a reason why we use guilty and not guilty, rather than guilty or innocent. Theist and atheist is the same. Anti-theists, such as myself, believe that there is no god, at least none that have been described can exist, but again I'm a subset of atheist. 

A call of not guilty will include people who are both not convinced that the defendant committed the crime (agnostic) and those who are sure the guy is innocent (anti-theist) but collectively they will say not guilty as it's the guilty verdict that is important. Similarly in todays political stage, it doesn't matter if you don't believe there's a god or believe there's no god, we're getting shat on by society, by apparently secular societies, so for us the not guilty label is more important than which side of the bus we sit.

Words change meaning with use, the original Greek use of the word was simply for people who doubted the gods existed, then decades, even centuries of religious rule changed it to being a positive claim that god doesn't exist, well lets take this extremely useful label and set it back to how it used to be used. Indeed the current online usage is already being taken as both anti-theist and agnostics are all atheist thanks to Matt Dillahunty and Aron Ra. By identifying as separate (where we're not really different, i mean we're all treated poorly) we split ourselves apart and appear weaker, despite being the fastest growing group in relation to religion in the world."

DebunkThis,ff8r6ov,t3_eqz102,1579692763.0,"First, don’t trust your memory so much, you’re incredibly fallible, especially with memories you visit often. I’m not a psychologist, so don’t take this as absolute truth, but if I remember correctly each time you recall a memory you rewrite it in your memory, meaning that each time you recall it, you have the chance to change it. Our memories are heavily affected by suggestion, too, you might not think it but if you have a tendency to believe in the supernatural then you will remember it as being more supernatural. Watch some of James Randi’s shows, he shows that a fortune telling from a famous ‘clairvoyant’ actually goes very different from how the victim, I mean mark, punter remembers it, and that was still fresh in his mind.

As mentioned before all public calls into a TV or radio show are screened, I worked in radio for a few years and even on local radio covering a couple of hundred listeners there are dire consequences for broadcasting the wrong material before the watershed. Given that humans are social entire conversations can be had with the call handler before going on air, and it can be brutally easy to glean information from those conversations. Your grandmother might not have outright said ‘My daughter has just been diagnosed with epilepsy, but it might have been a ‘Oh, I hope you’re doing well, it’s been a long week, hasn’t it?’ ‘Oh yeah, I can vouch for that, we’ve been having all sorts of problems this week.’ ‘Oh no, well, hopefully you at least have your health, we’ve had a breakout of flu in our house.’ ‘Well, my daughter isn’t doing great right now.’ Moving the conversation on to an unrelated subject and your grandmother will have forgotten she ever said that. It’s part of social engineering.

Social engineering is actually a really easy thing to do to most people. Give me 2 or 3 minutes face to face with someone and I’ll be able to glean something from them that they wouldn’t normally like to share, not necessarily something you’d immediate think was important, for instance your bank pin number, but it could be your grandmother’s maiden name, for example, pet names or all sorts. It’s also trivially easy to get someone to empathise with you and tell you about their similar ‘problems’ by inventing illnesses, money troubles, etc.

Then there’s reading the target, cold and hot reading are real things, and while back then there wasn’t a facebook, if I was to call into a TV show and give my name a google search could turn up a number of things, including my own mental health status, the fact I’m engaged, probably who to, too, my new puppy, the fact my best friend is an alcoholic, etc. In fact, just running a cursory analysis of my reddit posts alone will turn up a pretty clear picture of me and my private life, and I’m not only aware of this, but I’m also not a particularly public person. But even without this you can glean a lot from someone by how they talk and relate to other people.

“Your sick daughter” is vague, and is probably really a 50-50 punt when you include colds, sniffles, etc. There’s also a large chunk of the population who will develop some kind of long-term illness during their lifetime again raising that chance of a hit. My mother had a tarot reading done and they successfully ‘predicted’ that my dad would work for an international company, but if you stop and think about it you can describe most large scale employers as international, and if you add that most companies buy services or products and either import or export them, the international tag just keeps getting bigger.

Now, none of what I’ve put here is ‘debunking’ the argument that the cards told her the answer, and as James Randi always says, it’s entirely possible that they are genuinely using the supernatural to answer these questions and that this answer is just how I would do it without using the supernatural, however, if those tarot cards have EVER come up with an incorrect answer, it should shed enough doubt on how accurate they can be. If at any point during the reading a wrong answer was given, whether or not the reader was able to hand-wave it away, then it suggests that perhaps these cards are just cards, and don’t have some connection to the mystical."

It’s also incredibly convenient that when they get to the cupboard the lights just go out for a good few seconds.

Then there’s the cupboard, while the bit of the cupboard we can see is very shallow, there is what appears to a space beneath it, although it’s only shown for a very short period and I might be misunderstanding this. I can’t see any reason why there can’t be someone there banging the cupboard door, it would be easy to slam the door a few times and then disappear into one of the rooms leading off the corridor in the seconds of darkness before the lights surprisingly come back on. If you set up a string or lever to move the door then the pranker doesn’t even need to be near the cupboard, the banging could be done from one of the rooms, and let’s be honest here, apart from a quick panning shot we don’t see into the room.

All in all, there’s absolutely no reason to believe that anything remotely supernatural is happening here, not really a debunk, but perhaps a bit of clear thinking.

bipolar,ff6o15p,t1_ff6mkk1,1579631286.0,"That's a healthy approach. If I need to stay awake I delay taking my quetiapine. Went to my best friend's wedding not last year but the year before and our boat was delayed by 18 hours. I quarter dosed every few hours until we got to the cottage so I wouldn't flake, but equally wouldn't feel ill. I was driving the full 400 miles though, so no alcohol for me."

bipolar,ff6nea0,t1_ff6lg6t,1579630901.0,"My liver function is checked every month along with my testosterone, and I get a ultrasound done every 3 months as I'm carrying too much belly fat currently. That's more related to food though, although I have cut down a lot in the last year I was very overweight (just over 100kg for 6' tall) I've just dropped below 82kgs. GP is impressed at how fast the fatty deposits are working their way out.

I have absolutely no problems with totally stopping drinking, I would however get bored. I don't think I've ever been addicted to it, even though I was drinking for pain relief and to help sleep, as I've never had a problem with just stopping. For instance when I was homeless I stopped drinking. I'd rather a portion of fried fish than a bottle of wine at that time. It really is just something I enjoy every now and then. I think it helps that my meds help more with than alcohol ever did, and I've learnt to deal with the pain of depression in other ways now, too. I've been drinking this little for about years now, and I do go a week or so without anything just to make sure, but I tend to do it when I have other treats in the house, like kettle chips or wine gums.

If I hadn't been given a rather beautiful sherbet lemon gin I probably would have done dry January, tbh. I would like to point out that I still have a lot of that gin in my cabinet, too."

Just today I took an interview to work at the Wetherspoons pub, to get some extra money. I guess also that a big problem is that I've only ever enjoyed two jobs, one was as a driving instructor (but the rules here are much tighter than where I was actually doing it, and I don't have the £2,000 to stump on the official training) and radio DJ and news presenter for the local station.

bipolar,ff6e0cy,t3_ersw5w,1579625144.0,"You know, my favourite music is Pink Floyd, especially the strained albums of Dark Side of the Moon, Wish you were here and The Wall, virtually everybody I know finds them depressing, but I find them comfortable and familiar. Part of it is no doubt because as a kid my dad used to put the music on loud and we'd just sit there listening, but I wonder if some of the comfort is not down to my different outlook caused by my demons? It seems similar to your love of these faces. I especially relate to the lyric 'there's someone in my head but it's not me'.

bipolar,ff6cadz,t1_ff667m2,1579624064.0,"Not necessarily, you can be schizoaffective depressive, but given the diagnosis was schizoaffective bipolar, then yes, that's a form of bipolar. There are three major types;

Type 1 typically experiences full blown mania, type 2 experiences depression and hypomania (typically less severe than mania) and cylcothymia, which is experiencing less severe depressive and manic states. The way they are described make BP1 seem like the worst one to have, but honestly I wouldn't want any of the 3. People call cylcothymia 'bipolar lite' which I honestly think is wrong. I fear that those with cylcothymia are more likely to go undiagnosed and have more risk for that reason.

Your chart is showing some very rapid cycling, which itself doesn't rule out bipolar, but the trend is that mania lasts weeks and depression lasts months, even years. The other thing to keep an eye on is that mania isn't just feeling elated or feeling good, just like depression isn't feeling sad, if you can appreciate this and you genuinely recognise your mania and depression these could be mixed episodes or very rapid cycling. It could also be related to BPD.

Diagnoses are dependent on what your psych's judgement, which is based on what you tell him/her, so can change with each doctor. I've had a separate diagnosis for each doctor I've seen, for instance. Really the most important thing is that you are getting better regardless of what you have, and many of the personality disorders share a lot of symptoms.

The most important thing to remember is that I am not your doctor, so do not take anything here as advice. Your doctor is going to be far more knowledgeable about you and your disease than I ever will."

atheism,ff5zbhx,t1_ff5v32z,1579615017.0,"You are spot on. Today we are aware of more mental health issues and their causes than ever before, and we put safety and warning labels on everything from coffee cups to petrol cans. We discuss the increased cancer rates from eating bacon and regular long distance flying. We recognise that people who indulge in conspiracy theories are more likely to deceive themselves and are at higher risk of becoming delusional, and yet we refuse to consider any kind of religious belief as delusional, just because billions of people suffer the same delusion.

Just in the same way that believing in one off the wall conspiracy theory encourages you to swallow more and more disinformation entirely uncritically leading to belief in a vast matrix of separate and often contradictory 'facts' religions that value glossolalia and auditory hallucinations and celebrate delusional behaviour and feelings cannot be imparting any kind of healthy mindsets on their participants. If you encourage and indulge delusional behaviour then it will quickly become the norm, and the warning signs that normally point out the downward spiral into psychosis are instead seen as great acts of faith thus muddying the waters even further.

Just take the case of Annalise Michel as a perfect example of encouraging unhealthy behaviour in the name of furthering your ideology. The girl was showing textbook symptoms of neurological disorder, most likely epilepsy, and yet her priest and parents saw this as a great test of their and her faiths. Only a truly delusional person could look at this case and not see it as a result of indulgence of this delusion on all parts. 

This woman here will not have just woken up one day with the idea to test her faith, there will have been episodes that up to this moment, moments that she will have seen as confirmation that she was on the right track. I know this because I am bipolar and have suffered similar levels of psychosis, looking back there are several red flags that thankfully my friends picked up on. Yet in religious circles the steps I was taking toward this psychosis are seen as great displays of faith. For instance her faith that Jesus wouldn't let her be harmed was probably the last in a line of increased risk taking activities. While risky behaviour is not always bad, when out of character it suggests a problem developing. There were almost definitely other steps, such as hallucinations or apophenia, which are encouraged and indulged by religious groups.

Btw, I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist, I know what I know to better look after myself and keep myself from doing this sort of shit."
atheism,ff5td7a,t1_ff5pza6,1579609510.0,"While I somewhat agree, religion hides mental illness. If she was testing her faith that the world is an illusion, or a video game, or whatever it would be far clearer that she isn't all there and needs help, instead she's been allowed to get to a point where she's harming others and this is related to the fact behaviour typical of psychosis is often brushed off by the religious as showing great faith.

I don't know the specifics of this or of your friend, but delusions are dangerous and religions actively encourage people to indulge in their delusions. If you strip back any talking to or listening to God then delusions appear more obvious and while she may not have been picked up sooner, she equally could have done."
atheism,ff5ruaa,t1_ff4zkcs,1579607808.0,"Unfortunately not every Christian or priest sees things the same way. I know a number of people who think this way, especially the being born evil part. It's how a lot of  religious folk defend childhood diseases and cancer.

depression,femhyxp,t3_epx64x,1579256522.0,"Depression for most people is temporary, whether due to treatment, lifestyle or situational changes, most people get past it. There are, however, two types of depression that are unlikely to improve without a lot of treatment and/or effort, MDD and PDD. Both of these have a reasonable chance of reoccurring in the person's lifetime, so it's important to see someone and find out if you have them and what steps might work.

At any one time in the west, up to 10% of the population (depending on where you live) are suffering from a form of depression. Most of these will recover, although inevitably some won't. It's also worth pointing out that for most treatment of the symptoms is entirely possible. By either taking part in behaviour therapy, physical therapy drugs or a combination of these the symptoms can be reduced to virtually nothing. 

Your chances of getting over or living with depression are grossly improved by having a positive attitude to beating it. 

As for how many die without it being successfully treated, there simply doesn't appear to be any certain study on that specific, but what you can find out there is that there is a general trend toward lower suicide rates with every passing year since the 1950s at least."
