It is a stubbed toe waiting to happen, it looks ugly, it's taking up way too much space. Using pallets instead of a bed frame or platform is incredibly cheap and tacky.

The New York Knicks, a pathetic and embarrassing franchise, decided against trading for one of the top centers in the league after an outcry of disapproval from their brain-dead knuckle dragging fanbase. Colin Coward reacting to the news on Saturday said, ""I've never witnessed such an incompetent front office. The Knicks are truly the worst team in the history of organized sport.
