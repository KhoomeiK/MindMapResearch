He looked comical. I said ""What happened to you! You don't look so badass."" He's a strange cat who usually avoids people but not always. He let me pet him. 

Just then I noticed my neighbor was standing there with my book in hand and a pissed off look on her face. ""Thanks,"" I said. She didn't say a word..

---

I woke up in a daze and I was absolutely disoriented. I was in a stylish room  in a bed with frilly sheets. A redheaded girl was next to me snoring. She somehow had just the right skin to get a great tan. She was light brown and looked delicious.

I groggily walked outside to find to it was a cabana. It was very warm outside and I was on a beach. I went right up to waves and stuck my index finger into the water. I warily tasted it. Salty. My last memory was that I was in DC in snowy December taking care of some serious stuff for some very serious people.

I didn't realize she had come outside. In what I took to be a Northern Ireland accent she said ""What are ya doing? Did ya just taste the water?"" Christ, was she beautiful. The sun shone through her négligée. 

I was able to create some very foggy memories. Rachel and I had been on a cruise ship. She was a paying customer and I had been playing the bass in their fairly good band. I didn't even know I was musical. It turns out it was June and we were in Belize. I was tan too. I had lost at least 20 pounds and I was fit as a drum. I looked great. 

Rachel said ""It's time for yoga! You're acting so weird! You're not gonna flake on me are ya?"" I had been doing yoga? We soon had a huge fight. Rachel was a spitfire. Just my type. At least my taste in women had remained the same. 

I even said ""I don't want to have the nth row about fucking yoga when I'm not in the mood!"" Nth? I don't sound like me. ""Rou"" - I never used that word in my life. Well, I never remembered doing so. 

She slammed the door in a huff. I was pleased. I knew we going to start to hump like bunnies minutes after she came back. I checked the place for booze. Not a drop. I don't even know if I really wanted any. it was muscle memory and impulse. 

I looked in the fridge. Macro-this, vegan-that. I grabbed what seemed to be carrots covered in some kind of smelly goop. I somehow kind of liked it. I munched away and ate with with my fingers just like Rachel does. My last DC memory involved absinthe. I tried to figure out just what the fuck had happened. I couldn't wait for Rachel to get home."
