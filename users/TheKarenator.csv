AskReddit,ff2bgnd,t1_ff1hlrm,1579499640.0,"Sat behind a 13 yo kid playing a video game on his phone with loud volume. The kind with sound effects that aren’t relevant to gameplay with no dialogue. Seemed like he was alone so I held my tongue. Eventually someone asked if he could turn it down. And his mom was apparently across the aisle the whole time right next to him, “oh he has earphones he just doesn’t like them.”  Flight attendant came over and said he needed to turn it off or put them on. I don’t blame that kid at all, but how can a parent just let that happen?"

personalfinance,fermzrx,t3_eqfbid,1579355973.0,"I don’t have an official budget, but I do write down everything I spend. I categorize it by what it is (eg Utilities-Electric or Entertainment-Movies). Then I group each category by:

Required - basically fixed commitments that I must pay and would take major lifestyle changes to remove. Example would be car payments or even medical (which varies but I must spend when needed)

Flexible - required expenses but I can control how much I spend to a degree. Grocery bill and certain utilities. 

Optional - all forms of entertainment or eating out. Buying stuff I want but don’t need. Things I could cut out of my life or delay without major lifestyle changes. 

Record every dollar with the date and category in a giant list. Then pivot table to see by groups and categories by month. It makes it easy to identify where I need to cut spending. I can also easily compare expenses between months."
AskReddit,felgam1,t3_epq2l7,1579221490.0,"Step 1. Be fat

Step 2. Fly southwest to pick your own seat

Step 3. Find a row that has 1 fat guy already in the window seat. 

Step 4. Sit in the aisle seat leaving a tiny space between two fatties so no one picks it. 

Step 5. Relax and enjoy extra space without someone next to you. 

Step 6. The last person on the plane is even fatter than you and the only seat remaining is right next to you so you have three fat people crammed in And miserable for the next 3 hours and there is a lot of sweating. 

Step 7. Cry and eat some cookies that you packed since you are fat."

Reformed,fcl2gv7,t3_ehbyu6,1577738366.0,"The “math” on how Jesus’ death pays for our punishment isn’t shown. How can one short death pay for a long death? A similar question can be asked, how can one man’s death pay for many deaths?

The only answer given is that God finds the payment acceptable.  We can speculate that Jesus’ infinite worth can pay for many forever, but “how” isn’t explicitly stated in scripture. 

I also find it helpful to compare to animal sacrifices in the OT (as a thought exercise not an argument). Why CAN’T an animal’s death truly pay for my sin? Because my sin is greater than it can bear as a lesser creature. Why CAN Jesus death truly pay for my sin? Because HE is greater than my sin and can bear it all."
