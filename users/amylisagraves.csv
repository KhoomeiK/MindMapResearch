aww,ffckqep,t1_ffa8915,1579801535.0,My dear Uncle just passed at 100 ... so I’d need to outdo even him. Trying ... 😊 ... but he was a vegetarian and a tennis star. My poor tortoise is stuck with a sedentary scientist.
aww,ffckfo1,t1_ff9gmbz,1579801350.0,"So fortunate! My kids love their dogs but didn’t grow up w the tortoise. They did grow up with rats - but no worry that any rat will live for very long after me. They are lovely, but ephemeral."
aww,ffck81g,t1_ff8wtzq,1579801223.0,High crimes and ... no wait ... that’s why the US president is being executed😕
aww,ffck4id,t3_es8zqy,1579801164.0,"Thank you people of the reddiverse for these lovely comments. I will post a new Bortus picture soon ... will see if I am clever enough to link it to this thread. Yes, Bortus looked so like a Moclan to me that’s how she was named. Plus she is a female, which makes it sweeter if u are an Orville fan. 💚😊"
aww,ff8vcfp,t1_ff8te26,1579697344.0,"I hear you. I’m over 60 (yikes) and have a tortoise who may have 50 years ahead of her. Solution - wrote her (and other animals) into my will. My kids + executor must find home, which could be a reputable rescue (there are two near us) which will be glad to accept some $ I left...  to accept (and rehome 🙏) Bortus the Tortoise  😊"
tortoise,fervn5j,t3_eq9jzg,1579358820.0,"Mine likes to be hand fed ... she loves it when I hold the food, especially a the crunchy part of green leaf lettuce. (But eating from her stone “dishes” is best for her nails and beak). She comes to me to get picked up. She likes to motor around the house, exploring corners and cozying up to the warm heaters."
turtle,ferue9q,t3_eqa7pe,1579358460.0,You are blessed ... thank u for sharing that affectionate turtle with us!

tortoise,fe621ne,t3_envlay,1578880024.0,He (or she) wallow!
aww,fe5lywm,t1_fe0e84x,1578871153.0,"That is a great 👍 justification. Please forgive the small addendum ... 
You might find/buy a rat that’s lived alone for a while. There’s a decent chance it will be  *hostile* to a new rat if abruptly introduced.  Scared, territorial, etc ... fights ensue ☹️
 We’ve had great success gradually introducing new rats to an older one who lost his or her “bonded” friend(s). Info available on request ... But easiest way to start as a rat owner is to get 2 or 3 young rats (same sex) who are already living together. Siblings. That’s the dream  🐀 💕"
aww,fe054xo,t3_enfkv1,1578803312.0,"  We will always have rats. They are smart, gentle and dear. We get our from a rat rescue if possible. Two males at a time are what we’ve owned lately. Not smelly - just give them a big cage, good paper bedding and change it every week. 
   Yes they die ... you give them good care and extra love in their old age ... shed tears when u bury them,  remember them kindly but also move on by opening ur heart to new ones. 
   These simple animals have no self-concept - their mortality doesn’t occupy their thoughts.  But I like to think that they would want you adopt new rats after they depart  ... be a friend of the rat nation ... a nation which will outlive any rat or person."
frogs,fdsde2q,t3_emqrl8,1578700087.0,I miss my albino clawed frog (Xenopus= strange foot). Her name was Blanche. Loved to watch her gobble her food 😋
tortoise,fdsb9iv,t3_em93r2,1578698636.0,"Thank *you* for your gentle reply! 
Weirdly last night a friend who has 2 torts visited. She was sayin how the older and younger (newer) got along fine. Then today I got an email saying “help!” ... she was noticing signs of aggression and the youngerone not eating - can she have my unused habitat? (Yes!) Even really experienced owners get surprised.
 All good wishes to you and your new pet ! 🙏 🐢"
tortoise,fdnxi2p,t1_fdnpc2l,1578594848.0,"Sorry to be the buzz killer. Don’t get her a buddy. It is a miracle if two females coexist thru the years without getting aggressive. It never happens for two males ... they will fight brutally when they mature. 
Try to not think of them as a dog, cat, or even other breed of turtle.? Tetsudo torts truly want to be the only  turtle in their home habitat ... but they will grow to love interacting with their people ... you 😊🙏"
AnimalsBeingBros,fdnwnga,t1_fdni1g8,1578594353.0,"One of our rats was named Miracle Max ... the only pup of 2 litters his mom didn’t cannibalize.  He made it over the finish line ... got big enuff ... his last sibling was eaten the day before.
   In defense of Mommy Dearest: She was a hairless rat - she had the typical trouble lactating. Likely she had almost no milk to give.
   In celebration of Max: He lived to be almost 3. A venerable age for any Norway rat, much less a hairless one. Max, you are missed!"
tortoise,fdljhlh,t3_elsox4,1578525390.0,"This inevitable criticism of keeping the wrong tort with the wrong tort makes me sad. I was eviscerated for posting a pic of my 2 Russians together. A month later I had re-homed one with a turtle experienced family who kept him as a singleton (their sulcata was kept separate).  I kept the other. Would my 2 torts have had a better, longer  life with smart, careful me than out in the wild if I hadn’t immediately done this? Oh yes. Better life than 20% of the world’s children? Oh yes.  Please Redditors ... be kind, be open minded and ... perspective!"

Who stalks the top of prison wall? I cannot tell - not  enough tall. I strain to see. Sniff  to ID. I get slapped down for bein curious. He be arrogant; he be furious.

AnimalsBeingJerks,fchy127,t3_eh8hl6,1577655462.0,Agree - and I’m sure u are taking great care of Yogi and Boo-boo. Our Wyatt will snatch a bit of corn muffin from my fingers so fast I can’t see it happen. Our Billy takes it rather decorously from my grip. LOL !
AnimalsBeingJerks,fchl1gb,t3_eh8hl6,1577651468.0,My pet (Norway rats) did this too. Needed to feed one elderly rat some Ensure from syringe. Young rats kept coming up and slapping it out of his mouth and sucking on it greedily  ... Solved problem by diverting/ giving them small bowl of their own Ensure. Now they are very sleek and strong. It was funny and sad but all good now.
tortoise,fbm10hg,t3_edwfy5,1576975451.0,"I know 2 dessert turtles who like the Zilla fruit ... not mixed fruit and veggies. Yeah yeah don’t feed too much or often, as greens are their main diet..  But there is nothing wrong w this (vs fresh) for a treat. My more extroverted eater loves to munch hers off a (padded) baby spoon that I hold for her. Livin the life!"
