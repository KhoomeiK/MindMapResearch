AskReddit,fd0grl3,t3_ejsmzs,1578118560.0,"Last year I taught Kindergarten in a class that was primarily special needs. I had this one sweetheart of a girl who was latched onto me and had sever separation anxiety when I was away from her. To the point where her (adopted) parents had to come in and forcefully pull her sobbing from my leg because she didn't want to leave me overnight. During my class's lunch time, she would just sit in the cafeteria and bawl because I wasn't with her. Turns out I look similar to her biological mom who was extremely abusive. The mom did and cooked so much meth in the house with my student that when CPS found her she had intense brain damage. The mom also sold my student's body, when she was a toddler, to men for discounted prices on drugs."
