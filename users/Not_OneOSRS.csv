GetMotivated,fczgj8z,t1_fcyrmnz,1578100759.0,"Where I live employers are sometimes given incentives to hire people with disabilities to ensure they get given a fair chance. I feel like this could almost be used in this situation for people with a criminal history looking to actually pick themselves up and work on their life. Doesn’t even need to be permanent, just to give them a start somewhere. Idk might be a terrible idea but I think more thought needs to go into rehabilitation"

sydney,fbzwwfc,t1_fbzpb79,1577266042.0,What upsets me most about this is the amount of focus people like this are putting on climate change right at this very moment. Even on a post about the firies and discussions about their poor treatment and lack of support from the government leads to climate change constantly. How about we focus on an immediate issue a little more such as these guys being exposed to toxic chemicals and paying out of pocket to protect our homes and lives and then we worry about the future of our climate policy?
australia,fbz1rq5,t1_fbyvw85,1577232489.0,Oh don’t worry I’m sure the defense forces have plenty budget for that. Seems it’s just the firies that nobody in government gives a shit about
