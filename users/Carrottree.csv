I LOVE that this is still a thing.  I was happily agreeing with you 15 years ago.  

Not sure this is the case anymore :)"
technology,feourxn,t1_feont4u,1579305887.0,Both are equally bad in the current political climate.  Hillary was pro-establishment and appeared competent in that arena.  Biden is pro-establishment and appears incompetent.

AmItheAsshole,fdxzyo2,t1_fdsuyim,1578774632.0,"This is why ESH.  You took out your ex-wife's actions on your daughter's permanent driving record.  You had no intention of doing this until your wife disagreed with you. Would this have long term implications on your daughter's insurance premium and background checks (I'm asking, cause I honestly don't know)?"

Putting the TP in backwords makes it so they'd have to bat the roll upward to have it unroll... an unnatural movement for a cat, but I'm sure they are working on it.  The assholes."

science,fbxykf6,t1_fbxnx9s,1577203803.0,I think this is one thing you really can't blame on Insurance companies.  They want to keep keep healthcare costs low (for them).  Vaccines are way cheaper than treating the actual disease.
