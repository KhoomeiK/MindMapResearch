Before they started transitioning they're used to the societal 'norms' that are afforded to males such as being listened to, simply because of their (perceived) gender. 

Once they start to transition or present themselves as a trans woman, they run into the case that society affords less attention to females, their needs, and opinions 

They are not used to this, and rather than attribute this to male vs female, they attribute it to cis vs trans and assume the transphobic ""They treat me like this because I'm trans"" rather than the societal patriarchy of ""They treat me like this because I'm female"""
