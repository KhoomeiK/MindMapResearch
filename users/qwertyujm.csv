depression,fe2452m,t3_enn51k,1578834292.0,"Hey you should try Prestiq, it’s a snri but it works really well for me and I’ve only been taking it for 3 weeks. I was on Lexapro for 4 months which worked at first but after like 2 and a half months I started noticing that my depression and anxiety had gotten worse. The only thing that sucked was because I had to change from ssri to snri I needed to stop taking medication for like 2 days which was the shittest thing as I could barely function haha. Goodluck with it and shoot me a message if you just need to talk :)"
