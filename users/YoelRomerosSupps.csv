I think it's a shame he never got to see a legitimate parliament here."
ireland,ffebbpe,t3_et39ez,1579842004.0,"We don't generally curve grades based on how the class performs so don't get annoyed when you get the equivalent of a C/B, the grade conversion is worth much more for you back home. Also ECTS credits are generally less credit hours than you do back home. 

Just a couple of things I noticed from having American students in classes over the years. 

Culturally, just hang around the locals, don't do what most Americans do and only hang around with other yanks (that's what we call yis). 

Stay away from Temple bar and don't order silly drinks like mentioned above."
ireland,ffd2el6,t1_ffcz535,1579812072.0,"What are you on about? 

How has his senior managerial time got anything to do with helping run grassroots development for the FAI? 
He ran the youth program for the FAI for years and won major competitions at multiple levels, he was directly responsible for the development of multiple players that went on to win senior caps, one of which you actually mention (Robbie Keane). 

The fascist dictator comment is even more out of left field."
ireland,ffckiy5,t1_ffapcwf,1579801407.0,I'm not defending him because I think he's a ponce but he did grow up in Phibsborough which isn't exactly D4.

soccer,ff2z33i,t1_ff2wdp7,1579529191.0,Utd are still 14 points behind 2nd place City so it's still shit whether you polish it or not.

MMA,ff00hka,t1_fezt323,1579463852.0,"And you are right about the quality of that whiskey, you can't start a company and have your own aged whiskey in 2 years it has to be bought from somewhere"
MMA,feyvxmv,t1_feyq40a,1579451096.0,"Spot on, this is venturing into the ""why do people care so much"" territory but there's a rhyme and reason for the way Proper 12 is made. 

Conors marketing appeal spans men aged between 18 and 40 (actually starts much younger but we're talking alcohol here). The marketing is what he's bringing to the table here, if people buy it because it's synonymous with Conor McGregor then they'll keep buying it once it's palatable and produces the desired effect. 

Conor has always said he was aiming to take sales away from Jamesons generic bog standard 750 mL. With that in mind he had Bushmills blend him a cheap enough whiskey that he can churn out millions of bottles at a low price and get his brand established.

 I wouldn't be surprised if in 5 years he comes out with some special barrels and reserves that are much more popular amongst whiskey connoisseurs but right now, if you know whiskey then Proper 12 isn't marketed towards you."

You have an excellent point but it's this shite you'd have to contend with. School runs would account for a decent chunk of traffic and it's easily enforced."
MMA,fewlfvj,t1_fevnndp,1579413579.0,"I'm saving this video for when it comes out Malki is involved in some financial ponzi scheme that fucks over his clients. The dude just gives me the creeps. 

I'd legitimately trust Ali over this dude and he was possibly a double agent for the feds."

ireland,feunilj,t1_feukzb9,1579388257.0,So nobody would take that job? As far as I can see there are plenty of eligible candidates that would stay if you offered the position. Many candidates leave for better packages but that's more of a reflection of how few jobs there are available at that level.
ireland,feuhvjz,t1_fete8kn,1579386670.0,You think people won't take consultancy jobs because they'll be in a higher tax bracket?

nfl,feog50i,t1_feo9k9n,1579299623.0,"They said that after we lost to the Chargers last year too. ""The offense and Lamar were figured out, Ravens are going 7-9 next season"" 

Lamar will be back, it was mainly bad play calling that fucked us over in the Titans game. Vrabel just spanked the offense with great plays and we couldn't contain Henry."

Getting paid to be educated my bollocks, what they gave me amounted to a few frozen pizzas and a bottle of milk every week. I ended up having to work 30 hours a week on top of university to get by and that pushed me out of the maintenance bracket altogether and I got fuck all."
