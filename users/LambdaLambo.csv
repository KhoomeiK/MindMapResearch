As you can see from my other comment, my friends in investment banks have explicit PTO that they can’t use because the culture prohibits it. 

At the end of the day it comes down to industry and employee power. In tech, especially big tech, if you don’t like your job for whatever reason you can quit and get 5 offers in a few weeks. Can’t really do that in most other industries. 

So that means if you’re working somewhere with unlimited PTO, but they only let you take 2 weeks a year, well you quit and go somewhere that doesn’t do that. And since employers know you have that option they normally don’t enforce such things. 

All I want to do is dispel the myth that “unlimited PTO = 0 PTO”. It varies by company, and you have to do your own research on the company. Whenever I tell someone not in tech that I have unlimited PTO they think I’m getting ripped off, and that’s just not true in every situation. Some times it is but not always."

Well I take about 5 weeks off a year with my unlimited PTO. If I had an explicit 5 week policy, sure I'd take that. But if the alternative was a 3 week policy, I'd much rather have what I have now. Yes, unlimited PTO saves the company money in-terms of being able to turn that into extra compensation. But unlimited pto usually results in more vacation being taken off.

That's a false logical step. In 2019, the bay area population increased by 0.42%. In that time the population in NYC increased by 2.7%. And yet the Bay area is more expensive than NYC. 

Again, this is because there is no normal market cycle in the bay area, because the step where supply would logically increase doesn't happen (because zoning laws prohibit it).

cscareerquestions,fevf4rj,t1_fevccas,1579396667.0,"> Supply is what it is. 

Supply is not static. In a normal market, once demand pushes prices up, developing new buildings becomes more profitable, so development increases, causing supply to increase, causing prices to fall, causing development to wane, causing prices to rise and repeat. Common dude, this is basic shit.

This doesn't work in the bay, however, because zoning laws prohibit denser housing."

I come from a low socio-economic status. Without the social programs and government assistance I received I probably wouldn't get the opportunity to be an engineer. Now that I am successful and make great money, it is my turn to give to others what was given to me. That's why I support progressive taxation.

So yes, even if you come from low socio-economic status you're a dick for not wanting progressive taxation. *Even* if you truly truly got no help from the government, then I would hope you'd feel the desire to change that so that others don't have to go through the same.

Pete has done Fox News town halls, because he wants to talk to republicans and not just yell at them. 

Pete has a story about some trump supporters in a small town who were angry when the (illegal immigrant) owner of their favorite restaurant was deported. He uses this story to try and convince republicans on progressive values, and that deep down we are more similar than the divisive media makes us out to be. 

Pete called the reporter from theroot who posted the  hitpiece article on him and *just listened* instead of trying to fight or argue that he wasn’t in the wrong. 

Pete leads by example, and then actively encourages his supporters to do the same. No other candidate does this to this extent.
