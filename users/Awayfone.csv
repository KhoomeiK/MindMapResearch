He is a certified quack. He buys into the theory that cancer is a fungus. As an aside the original person who pushed this theory was found guilty of manslaughter because he kept killing people with baking soda IVs (to ""treat"" the cancer). But that's why the weird ""**antibiotic** or medication"" he belives antibiotics lead to fungus overgrowth,  candida of course, which means antibiotics cause cancer. Among other things, big into gut health so antibiotics cause allergies. Autism, Asthma, diabetes,  depression etc.


>Edit - he has a Ph.D in experimental medicine. So not a physician

 his education is really interesting. By interesting i mean he is a fraud, he has a dozens of biographies that contradict each other. His PHD is probably from mcgrill in well something maybe experimental medicine but he has claimed other things like functional medicine or nutrition. Also claims harvard grad and fellow which he isn't but was a post doc for a few years.
