Nurse,feygf3z,t3_eqnvti,1579445177.0,"This is not the biggest exam in your life. It‚Äôs an exam. Keep it in perspective. You‚Äôve had other exams in school and life, and undoubtedly there will be more ‚Äúexams‚Äù in your future. In my time as a nurse, I‚Äôve met some amazingly great caregivers that had to retake it and some dumbasses that passed it the first time.

Don‚Äôt focus on reviewing what you know. Focus on what you may not like, or where you are weak. I HATED L&D and the general peripartum stuff. I was also not great at a few other things. Every day for the week leading up to NCLEX, I studied my notes and did focused questions only on my weak areas for a couple hours. 

The day before the NCLEX I didn‚Äôt review a single note. I took the day to myself, had a couple great meals, saw a movie, had some beer, ate my favorite snacks, and soaked in the tub for hours listening to my favorite music. One of my teachers told me if you don‚Äôt know it the day before your NCLEX, you aren‚Äôt gonna learn it. So enjoy the day and do your best during your exam."

But dark and sinister might also apply. It‚Äôs kind of an isolate on the opera spectrum, but check it out, especially Act I Scene 3, the Window of Appearances trio."

Nurse,feo8gfj,t3_eq5t6y,1579296540.0,"1. Yes it‚Äôs normal.

2. I don‚Äôt care if the facility you might work with discourages it, it‚Äôs your choice, not theirs.  

3. If there is a negative event, I want people I pay at the table protecting my interests, not people the facility pays to protect theirs. 

Ask your nursing professors or other working nurses you see in your clinical experiences what they do. It can vary depending on state/city and healthcare facility.

If you have other kinds of insurance (home, life, etc.) you can contact those agencies (you already pay them) to get some advice.  Also, if you‚Äôre leaning toward a certain specialty in nursing, find a local chapter of a nursing association and ask them what they do."

Nurse,fejyayk,t3_entw1w,1579188612.0,"Getting through NCLEX was my priority. A friend suggested that was the trickiest part of any nursing education and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I got my ADN, and haven‚Äôt stopped working as a nurse since. Got my BSN, worked more, then finished my MSN. The progression kept me financially in good standing, and as I increased my education, I saw some return in salary.  Yes, I worked in a nursing home before hospitals, but the skills I developed helped me as a nurse. 

Your nursing degrees are an investment. I chose not to spend the money all up front because I didn‚Äôt want that financial burden. I think the real world experience while working helped me tremendously in school. My route let me manage debt while acclimating to life as a nurse."

I can‚Äôt speak in depth about purchasing used machines, but if the paddle or baking pan look icky, a quick search on your phone to check the cost for replacement parts will help you decide if that machine is worth purchasing."
chicagofood,fdi38jp,t3_eldwcs,1578434938.0,"I order of increasing spice: When I lived in Rogers Park, the suicide wings at Buffalo Joe‚Äôs  scarred me emotionally. But I continued on. 

Then, much later, there was The Incident At San Soo Gab San during which drunk me thought it was wise to order kimchi-jigae extra spicy. It wasn‚Äôt. Whatever the opposite of a religious experience is, I had it. 

Finally, when I lived in Buena Park, I ordered ‚ÄúThai taste‚Äù heat level on the noodles at the former Siam Noodle. They smelled extraordinary. They tasted as if I was fellating a space shuttle thruster during launch. Just don‚Äôt."

Also, I think Papageno would give good hugs.
