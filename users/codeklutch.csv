I can see us cutting Baron just as much as I see us keeping him. I mean at the end of the day, I want to keep juju, but Im just worried my dude. If he had a great year id be feeling completely different, but the fact is he didn't. I don't doubt hell bounce back with Ben, but, if he does how much of that is Ben and how much of it is juju? What if he really only is good because AB was taking off all that pressure. This season left a lot of questions for me about him and if we get an amazing offer, I'm at least considering it. Because best case? He doesn't ball out and we can get him cheap which... He didn't ball out.. we could have gotten a huge return and drafted the next guy and already have him in the system for a year. Worst case? He balls the fuck out and we can't afford to keep either him or our defense intact. It's, blah, I want juju. I want him to stay, but you can't sit there and say you wouldn't listen to the offers."

When I was breaking down to my girlfriend and the one close friend I do have (who moved across the country) one of the big things that hurt was, I don't feel like anyone wants to connect with me. That I have to put forth so much work and energy just to have a basic friendship with someone. I feel that I can't just reach out because I isolate myself at times because to be honest, I like being alone. But I don't like feeling alone.

steelers,ff93yw5,t1_ff9369x,1579704276.0,"And those are 2 things that experience will fix. You got to remember, we're going from Ben to a 2nd year guy who came in RAW as fuck. The thing I like about Mason is he doesn't back down. He's going to fight you and he's going to scratch and claw his way to win. That's the attitude I love to see out of any player. He wasn't great for the dolphins game, although he pulled it together in the second half to play a decent enough game. The colts game was a bit rough, but he did enough. Then the Rams game, I think, was his best game as a pro. Doesn't look like it, but, that was probably the worst game I've seen our receivers play, they were straight terrible. During Mason's stretch, we damn near lead the league in dropped passes. A QB can't build confidence or chemistry if noone knows how to catch a football. JuJu was hurt pretty much all year but that isn't as big of a deal as just how young our receivers were. They were expected to be carried by Ben, not expected to carry the qb.  Mason is good enough to be completely average with a bit of growth, with a new qb coach and if we were to actually build an offense around Mason during the offseason, I think he's on par with Dalton. You gotta remember, he wasn't expected to start until next year at the earliest and that was worst case scenario. He was supposed to start his 4th year in the league as he came in raw with a lot of small issues that needed to be worked out. I think if we were to move on from Ben this offseason we would make the playoffs next year just because of how Mason will improve over the offseason and during the preseason. I don't think he's ever going to be on Ben's level, but that is just such an unrealistic expectation."
steelers,ff937ew,t1_ff92qqa,1579703735.0,"Yeah, i kept getting him and Cain mixed up and didn't want to just give the wrong name. I don't think Edmunds has a future in the league (the rb not the safety) he just isn't better at anything than anyone else. Snell is just a better version of Edmunds. Samuels isn't the best at running, but he's a decent pass catching back and is actually pretty good in counter runs. The problem with that is, you know it's gonna be a counter when he's in there. I think Snell Samuels and Whyte are a pretty good combo, low key wouldn't mind us trading Conner for like a late 4th early 5th."
steelers,ff92hmu,t1_ff8uh11,1579703226.0,"Well, Edmunds is trash, he got out played by a dude who joined the roster in like week 12. Conner can't play more than 6 games a season it seems like. Samuels isn't a number 1 and has proven he is better and more effective when he isn't the focus of our offense. Snell? I think can be the guy moving forward, but if you really wanna talk about depth we have Snell and Samuels that actually matter. We got that dude who came in near the end of the year. I personally don't think we need a runningback drafted in the third especially with the fact we don't have a first and have so many other holes on offense and positions where we need projects more so than running back. But I can see a 6th round guy or a 7th round guy getting snagged."

steelers,ff8zasx,t1_ff87p1u,1579700773.0,"Okay, look at the circumstances of those games because football does not occur in a vacuum. That browns game would have been tough as fuck for Ben.

Then, after being the center of the entire NFL media and being dragged through the mud as a racist, you expect him to be mentally ready to play against the Bengals? Nah fam, should have sat that game out and I think the Brown's game too. You have to take care of your young QB, not throw him to the wolves.

steelers,ff856e4,t1_ff81zp1,1579666291.0,Go back and watch the Rams game. We had like 10 dropped passes that game. It's hard to trust your receivers to make a play when they don't catch the ball. He would have easily had 300+ yards and a couple TDs had people actually caught the ball when it hit them in the hands.

Cryptomains,fek1wm0,t3_epf5wq,1579190850.0,"So, Crypto has a bit of a learning curve to be decent. Just like Wattson, you gotta get creative with your abilities and put yourself and your team in position to win. I personally like to play him with 1 defensive legend and 1 movement legend (wraith/octane/path)

I like to scout out compounds before moving in on them, knowledge is key. If I know there are no squads nearby, I can relax. If I know there are squads nearby, I wanna pop a squat and find them.

If you have 2 squads in drone range, you can have some fun. You can draw out a fight by flying around a squad causing them to shoot at it and giving away their position to other squads. If they're fighting, you can ult the entire fight to try and get them to either fall back and heal or get the fight over quicker. Most people will immediately try to back off and heal if they get hit by your ult use that knowledge to your advantage.

Something else you can do, if you move through a chokepoint, leave your drone there (as in, go back to being crypto) and if someone passes by your drone, hit your ult and you can move on them while you're ulting and get a good rush on em, it also lets you know if someone is coming up from behind you. 

Later game, i like to play a bit defensive and just try to hold down a building or a hill, something we can defend or at the very least, not be easily targeted. I'll pop in my drone and try to locate as many squads as I can so I can start planning out where they are, where they're probably going to go and if they're going to run into a squad. I really like starting fights between other squads by using my drone around another team. That's just a few things you can do with him off the top of my head, remember. Knowledge is key. You want to know as much about the battlefield as possible before engaging. 

Can he be meta? Absolutely. With his recent buffs he's actually in a good spot."

Yes they get special treatment and a bit of leeway. Because he's winning games. You don't bench your best player because he got a bit mad and threw a watercooler when you're trying to win playoff games. Remember when Bill benched his top corner because he was late to a walk through? Remember that the corner he replaced him with got eaten up? Yeah, you don't bench your best players when you're trying to win. You handle it behind closed doors like a god damn adult."
ApexOutlands,feh0edx,t1_feh02l6,1579106515.0,"No mid range coverage. Yeah I dominate in close range and long range. But when the zone starts closing, the flatline/g7 gives you some mid range options. I can run flatline mastiff or scout mastiff. But if I have the Kraber, I'm running flatline with it because it can still take a mastiff in close range AND if they're more than 10 feet from me, I have the advantage."
steelers,feh08hl,t1_fegzwpz,1579106414.0,you're just out to bash on tomlin. I thought you were over that blind hatred of the big scary lazy black man
steelers,fegzkxv,t1_fegzd8f,1579106018.0,"Where is your proof he did nothing to handle it? Because he didn't talk to the media bout it? What? you gonna sit there and say ""yeah, AB threw a watercooler so i made him sit in the corner while all the other players got to shower and cool off after the game"" The fuck? Tomlin DID WHAT HAD TO BE DONE... you have literally no proof there was ""nothing done"" to curb AB yet here you are. Slinging your dick in the air like it means something."
ApexOutlands,fegz80q,t1_fegx18t,1579105796.0,"Trust me, I have a clip of me taking out 2 dudes from like 30 yards with the mastiff. I can do it, but damn do i not want to."
ApexOutlands,fegz6l0,t1_fegxnaf,1579105773.0,"Flatline gets that mid and close range. Mastiff can hit mid range shots but you're just wasting ammo. Kraber for long range, flatline does everything else. at least, that's what i run."
steelers,fegz3f2,t1_fegthwl,1579105718.0,"If getting hall of fame level production out of someone who other teams can't keep on their team is doing nothing, i apparently can't do nothing."
steelers,fegsuh9,t1_fegq4ir,1579101743.0,"Because, no other coach could handle his shit, tomlin did it for way too long. What other action could he have taken? You don't cut the best wide receiver in the league. You could have traded him, but, if we did that? how much shit would you have given tomlin and co for trading the best wide receiver in the league. His talent was enough to put up with his antics and his ego. But the moment the on the field didn't justify the off the field? He was let go. Like I said, you don't cut the best wide receiver in the league for anything other than them demanding to leave or a huge scandal. Tomlin gets credit for getting more than a game out of that headcase, BB couldn't handle him for more than a couple weeks. This guy has had issues going all the way back to highschool. He's always been talented, but he has always been a headcase. There's a reason Arians wanted to cut him his rookie year."

ElectricForest,fegroja,t3_eot5lb,1579100959.0,"damn, someone else says this!"
ApexOutlands,fegpisc,t1_feghv7b,1579099474.0,"dude what sucks is that i want to run the mastiff, but i can't do mastic kraber. So im forced into kraber flatline. but, it does some work"
