At what point when  R+ fails do you have to decide to either give up, or try a different method?   The removal of e-collars can, and will lead to only one option when things reach that point.  Personally, I don't think it should have to reach that point for most dogs with difficult issues, and I think there should remain other options.  Obviously, some dogs are living in misery and the best option is obvious. For others, when R+ isn't working anymore, and something else will...?

They seem to be studying e-collars in relation to punishment based training, and finding that they *add* even more stressors to something that's already creating them to begin with (dogs with e-collars show *more* stress than those without).

The other, we got as a puppy and raised alongside our other dogs, in the same way.  That dog ended up killing half of our chickens and ducks, and almost got the neighbor's cat.  My dad took it away the next day.

Later in life, I worked at a grooming salon for a number of years and had my hands on 100's of pitbulls.  None of them were dangerous to handle, they were friendly and sweet... *BUT* almost every single one of them came in with the warning ""don't let them near other dogs"". I could count the number of pits on one hand that *weren't* dog aggressive.  Over time, I just started to find them a pain in the ass to try and manage in an environment full of dogs, and I actually started to find them grossly unattractive (along with bulldogs, frenchies, etc.). 

In addition to that, I was living in a neighborhood that was starting to become overwhelmed with young, uneducated ""rescuers"" with pitbulls. Not a single day went by where my dogs weren't lunged at by a pitbull. If i saw a pit, I knew it was going to go after my dogs.  Seeing so many dogs poorly mismanaged by well meaning owners was enough for me to finally conclude that most people have no business owning these dogs.  At the time I was also starting to educate myself more about breeds, statistics, hunting, canine genetics, training, so on and so forth.

It was when my own dog was mauled (survived) by an off-leash pitbull that I had had enough.  I have no sympathy for owners. I have no desire to be near you, or your dog. I don't care if your pit is nice or friendly. I don't care if your pit is better trained than my dog. I will avoid you and your dog at all costs. I will automatically assume you are a fucking moron who can't find your ass with both hands if I see you with a pitbull. I am not ashamed to admit that I think less of a person and have less respect for them, if they own a pitbull type dog. 

I now carry a knife, a stun gun, and pepper spray because of these dogs.  It is because of pitbulls that I kind of wish I could conceal carry... and I am almost entirely anti-gun!

They make winter coats and snow boots for dogs.  Yes it sucks to have to gear up your dog just to pee, but unfortunately it's part of the deal when living with a dog in certain situations. : /

>When I moved in, this was NEVER mentioned. It’s only become a problem since these numerous families of apparent dog-haters have moved in. They are all friends, so choose to live here to be together, it seems. Also, in that same vein, there is a grassy area around the other side of the building we were told anyone was entitled to go and that it was a nice area for the pups to walk around. This was a different building manager, and it seems she might have been a little less “people-pleasey.”

Unfortunately things change. While some might not find it an issue, clearly enough people do that they have changed their stance on their policies. If they legitimately feel that it is negatively impacting the quality of enjoyment of other tenants, then they are more likely to make changes. 

>Renters rent the apartment and the balcony/patio pad outside said balcony, not the grass.

Unless it is the strip between the sidewalk and the street, it is still private property. I'm honestly more surprised that the manager or owner didn't take issue with it to begin with. 


Personally, I never allow my dog to go on anyone's property or front yard, fences, mailboxes, trashcans, or anything else that wasn't considered to be public use. Even when renting, I would take my dog away from the property I lived in and move to the public strips of grass and dirt. 

HOWEVER!!! I think it would be reasonable to maybe ask the property owner or manager about designating a specific area of the property for doggy use, if there's a significant amount of common area."

Often many of those charges will be waived depending on age, income, etc. I've also seen certain breeds having their fees waived. 

At the local SPCA, it's $140 for dogs, $90 for cats - including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and a few more bells and whistles.

Owned cats for 40+ years. I've never *not* had a cat in my life, and I've had experience with a variety of personalities. I've had barn cats, indoor cats, indoor/outdoor cats, purebred cats, shelter cats, etc.

Cats are just plain easier overall... in *my personal* experience.  They are much easier to have as an indoor/outdoor pet, and while I've had affectionate cats, they were not excessively ""needy"", and I must have a different idea of what ""clingy"" is (implies negative mental state, imo).  It is much easier to find an aloof, easy going, and relatively mellow cat.  In fact, I've never owned a cat that had any major issues. I've had little issues modifying their behavior with relatively simple changes or techniques, but it does require different types of efforts than dogs.  Granted, none of those behaviors have ever been extreme. 

It's not hard to find an easy going primarily outdoor cat that requires minimal affection. Just as it's not hard to find a cat that's clingy and needy.  YMMV but my lifetime of experience has been one that is the opposite of yours. Maybe I've just been extremely lucky with the cats I've had. /shrugs

But as I said, I was playing the devil's advocate.  *If* that is going on (as I admitted previously - not likely), then breeding non-traditional colorations isn't, by itself, inherently bad.  I'd wager some non-standard colorations get mixed in with working dogs (as does out-breeding).

>There's no evidence that any of that is being done when the new colours are introduced and multiplied

I am not a show person. I don't know show breeders. I am trying not to let my cynicism against show dogs and breeders (I rarely assume positive ethics) effect me questioning the introduction of new colors. I'm trying not to assume the motivation of every breeder out there, be it show, working, etc. I do have to wonder if profit is the *only* motivating factor when people who, at least seem to be, passionate about a breed and showing that breed want to bring in non-standard colors.  I mean are all merle corgi fanatics in show rings unethical? At any point do standards become too outdated and just plain too restrictive (or too open to interpretation) for the continued health of a breed?  I mean at some point someone/someones decided that merle was ok for Cardigans but not Pembrokes...? Someone decided that the mutation was ok for some dogs, but not others.  Herding dogs allow merle for the ""betterment of the breed"", but it's not ok in most terriers? 

These are genuine speculations. Again, *IF* breeders and breed clubs were prioritizing health and betterment, then non-standard colorations should have little effect on that overall? 

All that aside, I know most ""unique"" colors, or extremes (pocket bullies) that are being bred in dogs aren't putting the health of the animals as a priority in any way shape or form."

Well, no. I think that's a very safe assumption. I highly doubt most people breeding or advertizing unique colors are doing it for much else. Although, if health testing is being done with the new colorations, and the dogs are passing, and overall healthier in the breed?
