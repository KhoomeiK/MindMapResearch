fatlogic,fdpzear,t3_embfp2,1578647241.0,"I'm an unfit lardarse and even I don't get out of breath going up stairs, there's absolutely no way that most people do. Sounds like someone wants to believe that everyone is as unhealthy as them..."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdceryu,t3_ekj1ik,1578273121.0,"Ted Bundy, if only because he apparently said to a cop “the guy you’re looking for for these murders will have a body count in the triple digits” obviously referring to himself. I believe he only actually confessed to thirty, but he could easily have done more, he was quite reticent and would act like he couldn’t recall how many he’d done. 

Also the Moors Murderers, my relatives from that area who lived there at the time always told me that it was pretty much universally thought that there were literally dozens of victims, buried on the moors, or dumped on a farm."
UnresolvedMysteries,fda5jrz,t3_ek6jut,1578241979.0,"That's so sad, there's a similar problem close to me. A certain bridge near me has potatoes etc thrown down onto cars multiple times a week, plenty of broken windscreens but no injuries yet. The police just aren't interested unfortunately."
fatlogic,fd91fts,t1_fcyjplx,1578226801.0,"It's not even a good one, I have a learning difficulty and can barely add up two and two, that's why there's a helpful app that does these things for me."
LegalAdviceUK,fcv3ydu,t3_ej0h2u,1577994152.0,"My divorce was free as you can have the fees waived if you’re on certain benefits or just have a low income. I did it online myself and it’s been quite easy, no kids or property. Otherwise I believe it’s around £500."
fatlogic,fcu7dfl,t3_eimgv0,1577974309.0,"The truly daft thing is, that I really don't get much exercise and I do a lot of sitting down and watching screens at home because I have chronic health problems. I can still eat adequate meals and snacks (although you could argue that a lot of people don't need snacks) and lose weight, because of some incredibly simple maths. You can sit down all you want but don't expect to eat like a marathon runner and stay the same weight."
BingeEatingDisorder,f8p195y,t3_e1f18m,1574693948.0,"To be honest I've made the biggest strides with my BED while restricting on a small deficit. I can't eat intuitively or ""normally"". I can binge or I can track/restrict and I know which one I'd rather do."
