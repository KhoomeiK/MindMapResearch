confession,ff2cz97,t1_ff2bokq,1579501179.0,"People give unsolicited advice all the time, everywhere. Just because other people give advice doesn’t mean advice was asked for."
dontputyourdickinthat,ff28jn3,t3_eh46b6,1579496936.0,What is it?
confession,ff27yed,t1_ff26y72,1579496423.0,"This isn’t a subreddit called “advice” it’s called “confessions”. Who ever said OP was asking for advice. He also isn’t bitching or complaining, he’s just confessing something anonymously that he’s done. That’s what this subreddit is for, some people just need to tell someone what they’ve done and it’s better if it’s anonymous."
offmychest,ff0v4pv,t3_eqxx45,1579472574.0,"Almost the same exact thing happened to me the other night. My relationship wasn’t quite as abusive, and my new one wasn’t such a strong friendship first, but I often lay in bed with him and think of all the nights I never thought I would make it this far with someone so loving and kind. He is an absolute blessing, and as he is holding me in his arms asleep this very minute, I feel more that just safe. I feel that HE feels safe, and we are a pair. We just fit. 

I’m so happy for you OP, because I really know how it feels to go from having worse than nothing to more than anything you could ever hope for. Keep on shining like the star you are, and remember to cherish and hold onto those little moments of silliness and giggles. Those moments can be such fundamental pieces of a relationship. I’m proud of you <3"

offmychest,feouycl,t3_eq2qd2,1579305973.0,"What an excellent thing to say, especially on this subreddit. I wonder how many lives you’ve just saved."
offmychest,fej3no5,t3_epes3s,1579155680.0,"That’s depressing. I feel like a completely irresponsible lazy bum because I’m 24 with a part time job and I’m not motivated enough to do anything about getting a better job. But at least I have a job. At least I have a license, and a car that I bought with my own money all by myself."
tipofmytongue,fej2way,t1_fej2g2l,1579154874.0,"Solved! Thanks! I kept making up the most ridiculous lyrics in my head. I still do t know why I know this song, or what I know it from, but that’s definitely it."
offmychest,fej2cqt,t3_eosbpu,1579154321.0,"Today is literally the first time I ever downvoted something, so I never saw the blue before today, but that’s the FIRST THING I thought when I saw it."
