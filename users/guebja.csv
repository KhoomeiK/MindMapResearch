No, it didn't.

The 4.2% ""happened"" in Q2 2018. And I put quotes around ""happened"" because it was later revised downward to [3.5%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/economic-growth-didnt-hit-3-mark-last-year-revised-data-show-11564144200).

The most recent figures, however, are significantly lower, at a decent-but-unremarkable 2.1% for Q3 2019.

That'd be a solid result, had it not been for the fact that the Trump administration is engaging in recession-level deficit spending to boost the economy, growing the debt at a time when it should be shrinking."

The quote in question:

> 4\. **IN 2018, BIDEN LAUDED PAUL RYAN FOR PROPOSING CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE:** The Week reports that in 2018, Biden gave a speech declaring that ""I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble” and then declaring that ""Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare … That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.""

And [here the full transcript of the actual speech by Biden](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/biden-transcript.pdf).

The quote in question, with context:

> So here’s what we have to change in my view. I think there are answers. One, the first
thing I think we have to do is we have to deal with income inequity. I love Bernie, but I’m not Bernie
Sanders. I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble. I hope my grandkids grow up
to be -- don’t listen to their parents, who all decided to do something, run the World Food Program, run
the -- another will be attorney general, another one run a social organization for at-risk youth, you know.
They got all this education and, you know, I should have had a Republican kid. (Laughter) So when they
put in the home I’d have a window with a view, you know what I mean? (Laughter) But now there’s going
to be no view.

> But all kidding aside, we have not seen this huge concentration of wealth. And the folks
at the top aren’t bad guys. I get in trouble in my party when I say wealthy Americans are just as patriotic
as poor folks. I found no distinction. I really haven’t. But this gap is yawning, it’s gaping, and it’s having
the effect of pulling us apart. You see the politics of it.

> And the country’s not going to stand for it forever, so we have to deal with the tax code.
It’s wildly skewed toward taking care of those at the very top. It favors, overwhelmingly favors, investors
over workers and it’s riddled with unproductive expenditures.

> My economics teacher at the University of Delaware taught me the reason for a tax
expenditure is to promote a social good, generate people taking risk, increased productivity. Raise your
hand if you think that 1 trillion 300 billion-plus dollars in tax expenditure whether even half of it meets that
-- well, two-thirds of it meets that criteria.

> As I say where I come from, get a life. Look what’s happened with the latest tax cut.
Once again those at the very top get the biggest breaks and what do we have to show for it? Even our
Republican friends are now beginning to admit there’s no evidence these tax cuts are being put to work in
the economy. No new growth, just more debt. And that puts middle class programs that they rely on and
they’ve worked for at real risk.

> Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What’s the first thing he decided we 
had to go after? Social Security and Medicare. Now, we need to do something about Social Security and
Medicare. That’s the only way you can find room to pay for it.

> Now, I don’t know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1
percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don’t know a lot of them. Maybe you guys
do. So we need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just
investors; that gets rid of unprotective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to
make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and
pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country.

TL;DR of what Biden is saying:

* Income inequality is a major problem.

* Billionaires aren't bad people, but the tax code does favor them too much.

* Republican tax cuts for the wealthy don't pay for themselves.

* The only way to pay for Republican tax cuts is by cutting Social Security and Medicare.

* What America needs is a progressive code (i.e. higher taxes on the wealthy) to increase revenue and protect programs like Social Security and Medicare.

He's not ""lauding"" Paul Ryan. He's saying that the most distasteful part of Paul Ryan's tax proposal (cutting Social Security and Medicare) is unavoidable if you want to have the rest (low taxes for the rich).

Which is why he **opposes** a regressive tax code that favors the wealthy."

For example, if you look at [the inventory of Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_of_Henry_VIII_of_England), it lists thousands of Almain rivets spread out across his holdings."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdornx0,t1_fdolx32,1578611366.0,"[This sourced list of medieval prices and wages](http://medieval.ucdavis.edu/120D/Money.html) is useful in getting a general idea of the price levels during the relevant period.

Near the bottom, you find wages for various professions.

If you look at 16th century wages, you'll see that an infantryman earned 8 pence a day, a cavalryman 18 pence a day, a captain 16 shillings a day, and so on.

Meanwhile, an armorer in the same period earned 24 shillings (288 pence) a month, and an apprentice armorer 6 pence a day.

With armor, we're fortunate enough to have several royal proclamations on price levels available.

For example, in [this proclamation from 1544](https://books.google.nl/books?id=cBzuka1QBKkC&lpg=PA67&ots=e_Gp47Ew9f&dq=almain%20rivet%20price%20shillings&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false), a maximum price of 9 shillings and 6 pence (114 pence total) is set for Almain rivets. And the Wikipedia article cites a proclamation setting the maximum price at 7 shillings and 6 pence (90 pence total).

So the price is a few weeks worth of work for a skilled laborer. Not cheap by any means, but certainly not prohibitively expensive, either.

For more information on the subject, I'm afraid you'd have to look at books instead of websites.

A few good ones are *The Knight and the Blast Furnace* by Alan Williams, *Armourers* by Matthias Pfaffenbichler, *The Armourer and His Craft* by Charles ffoulkes, and *English Weapons and Warfare, 449-1660* by Norman and Pottinger."
