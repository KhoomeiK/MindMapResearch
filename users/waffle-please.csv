Dogtraining,ff7sy6r,t3_es1cri,1579657597.0,You have to reward her for when she is not focused on food. Kikopup has some good videos about it. When she is relaxing and not thinking about food give her a ton of treats.
Dogtraining,ff6myoy,t3_erw0tb,1579630639.0,"I’m on mobile so I can’t grab the link but you can’t reinforce fear. You CAN safely soothe a fearful dog. However, that’s different than alert barking. I have a Great Pyrenees so we have to manage alert barking. What I do when mine does it is get up and look at what he is barking at, and then I go back to him and tell him “thank you, it’s okay.” If he continues to bark then I tell him no and he’s usually done after that. 

He went through a fear period for a few weeks last year. We just stayed patient and confident and let him work through it. Never punish him for fear or alert barking because it will probably make him more fearful. There’s a difference between barking to alert or out of fear and barking for attention and it sounds like it’s just the former."

I moved in with him to help him recover since my parents have been long divorced and he had been living alone for more than a decade. Fortunately he only lost his ability to drive and read because his eyesight was a little messed up. He was back out owning the guys on the golf course just a few months later and looking really healthy. He was taking uber there every day and I thought he was doing really well. We moved into a bigger, nicer apartment together.

About 9 months after the stroke, he got really depressed and I didn't notice. A few months after that he died by suicide. I wish I could go back and make sure he had started going to see a therapist right away. The doctors always checked on his mental state in the months following the stroke, but after about 8 months he didn't really have any appointments anymore, and I didn't do a good job checking in and paying attention. I'm glad your parents have you and each other, but make sure that he is getting the mental help he needs to work through the disability that he has now."

aww,fenppvu,t1_fennons,1579289065.0,"All due respect, but you are not living in reality if you think you can visit a dog in a shelter and discern everything you need to know about his temperament and energy level."
aww,fenncyx,t1_fenl144,1579288135.0,"It's not about looks. Dogs have been bred for thousands of years for function. Good breeders produce healthy and well-adjusted dogs which is what most people want. People shouldn't be shamed for not rescuing the sickest, neediest dog at their local shelter. In my case my shelter just doesn't really have dogs. Cold parts of the world just don't have a dog overpopulation problem. It's a THROWDOWN at the shelter when they get a new batch of dogs from Texas. I nearly couldn't get one at all when I went in and got my dog. 

You don't know if these are working dogs. You think everyone who uses a border collie to herd their sheep, their livelihood, should go rescue a mutt from the shelter and believe that can do the same work? Tollers are not casual dogs. They are very difficult to own and maintain and require a very specific lifestyle. Do you think every Toller breeder should stop just because the southern US has too many pits in their shelters? 

In the US more than twice as many animals are adopted from the shelter as there are put down. And euthanization is down by half from 10 years ago, down by more than SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT in urban areas, and there's no data on how many of those dogs were deemed adoptable.  ""Adopt don't shop"" has been *so successful* that people in Canada can't find adoptable dogs. My ASPCA has 6 dogs listed for the *entire province*. Shelters are going to market to buy bred dogs so that they can sell them as ""rescues."" 78 MILLION dogs are owned in the US. We are importing MILLIONS of dogs from other countries because US shelters can't keep up with the demand to rescue. 

It's none of your business what someone wants to bring into their home and commit the next decade or more of their life to. It's MORE responsible to make sure that you get a dog you won't have to give up because it's not compatible with your lifestyle, your location, temperament, etc."

aww,fegmgvk,t1_fefmz7n,1579097226.0,If we stop breeding dogs for adoption purposes we will eventually not have any dogs at all. There's actually a much higher demand for adoptable dogs than shelters/rescues are able to fill in North America. Key word being *adoptable*. In southern Ontario we are shipping dogs in from Texas by the dozens and they all adopt out within hours (at least at the shelter where I got my guy).
Dogtraining,fec7v7k,t1_fec2y2f,1578968169.0,"yeah definitely, when I started watching the husky I thought I would go insane. Lol. I'm glad my guy only alert barks. We've treated that by getting up as soon as he barks to check what he's alerting for. Then telling him ""thank you, everything's okay!"" So he now he will only growl or bark very quietly to get our attention instead of going all out every time he hears something in the hallway LOL. Best of luck to you."
Dogtraining,fec2l5p,t3_eo86d7,1578965745.0,"I have a great pyrenees mix who only alert barks. I don't know that barking for everything is necessarily a GP trait. They are prone to alert barking and sometimes reinforcing that the wrong way can lead them to barking for other reasons. 

I also regularly babysit his BFF who is a husky mix who barks a TON. Her owners have taught her that barking is how she gets anything. To go outside. Attention. Treats. Whatever. She barks all the time which wasn't working for me when she was first staying with me. Since I work from home I needed her to learn how to relax and we started doing ""settle."" 

The barker is highly food motivated and her barks were ear splitting, too. I put on noise canceling headphones as we worked through it. I kept a big pile of very low value treats or even kibble on my desk and would without looking at her drop kibble any time she was quiet. Then she needed to be sitting. Then lying down. Then fully relaxing. When she's fully relaxed lying on her side with her eyes closed I'll occasionally just make it rain treats. It's pretty much solved her barking issue in my house. And yes I had to completely ignore her barking. No movement, no flinching, no speaking. So I had to have the headphones on.

I would argue that playing with another dog in the yard isn't sufficient exercise for a lot of dogs. She may need more mental exercise. I live in a condo with a dog park out back. We do 30 minutes with our friends at the dog park + a 30 minute sniffy walk before work and at least a 60 minute walk once other time during the day (midday in winter, after work in summer). The rest of our potty breaks are 10-15 minute walks down the street and back. When we walk we are always working on something in between the sniffy spots... usually walking better on leash. By the time we get home after 45-60 minutes he's pretty exhausted. He also gets a bully stick once a day."

dogs,fc5i1nu,t1_fc5hne1,1577458171.0,"pet insurance is one of the biggest ripoffs out there. you're better off setting aside that money in a separate bank account than paying an insurance company.

edit: I'm not going to respond to everyone saying the same stuff, but maybe it's different in the US than where I am in Canada. Here's a story from recently where this woman paid into her dog's insurance for more than a decade and still got ripped off when he finally got sick: https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/ecc4g1/pet_secure_users_be_carefulontario_woman_feels/

I'm sure people have plenty of stories where pet insurance saved their ass, but it's NOT the same as your own medical insurance and they CAN change your premiums and deductibles based on your dog's declining health (where I live). When I got my dog and looked into my options for pet insurance almost everything was insanely expensive for what it covered."
