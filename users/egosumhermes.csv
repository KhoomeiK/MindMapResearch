uber,fe6a7ps,t3_enxgkw,1578885272.0,"A lot of people have been abusing the service animal law to travel in Ubers with their normal pets. They know drivers aren't allowed to ask if it's a service animal or not, so they abuse the system. While I don't doubt yours is a legitimate service animal, blaming drivers for putting their foot down when it comes to being forced to take all sorts of animals carte blanche into their personal vehicles isn't fair either. 

The fault lies with the people abusing the system, not drivers. In my opinion, service animals should be clearly identifiable with a license on their collar, or other means, and drivers should be allowed to decline rides when people travel with pets, not service animals, without fear of being terminated from the platform.

Don't misunderstand, I'm all for people's freedom to travel with their pets. However, that freedom doesn't supersede the driver's right or freedom to not accept other people's pets in their personal vehicles."

No. I told you several times now that I want them to be independent of the US. 

>Do you think that all of the 50 states of the US became suddenly states after being incorporated?

Uh, what? Let me break down the process in four easy steps:

1st step:
Congress appoints a governor, a secretary, and three judges to rule over a certain territory.

2nd Step:
Once 5000 free adult males are in a territory, that territory can elect a legislature and send a non voting delegate to congress.

3rd Step:
With a total free population of 60000+, the territory can write a constitution and send it to congress for approval.

4th Step:
The territory becomes a state.

That's it. It's not a long and convoluted process. The hard part is getting approved by Congress, who has to see the benefit of a territory becoming a state."

Let's put this in simplified perspective: If a bully is hitting you and you finally stand up to that bully and punch him out, while that may appear like an escalation to an idiot, it's in fact a de-escalation of violence when the bully is no longer hitting you. If the bully tries asserting dominance again, you hit him again. The bully eventually learns he's not a big dog and stops hitting you. That's de-escalation, not escalation.

>This is just stupid. What we did is literally an escalation. It escalated, we did it.

Bullshit. Iran has been behind the majority of terror attacks through their supply of money and weapons to terrorist groups. Where are you getting your data from, misinformed . com? Souleimani himself was the leader of one such terrorist group, the Quds, and was supplying weapons to Hezbollah.

>No things wont happen just like before. Not the country of Iran is openly going to attack US troops somewhere that they would not have before

No they won't. They'll rattle their sabers, and that's all. Iran isn't the pitbull you all think Iran is. They won't engage us in open battle because they know they'll lose. What they *will* do is try to bomb a few military installations, just like before. They'll provide more money and weapons to terrorists, just like before. Nothing new. Calm down. 

>I cant tell if youre being disengenuous this entire time or if youre really this much of a simpleton you only understand ""brown man bad. Kill him good""

What? Did you just pull out the race card when the race card wasn't required? We killed a terrorist leader under the guise of a generalship. That's it and that's all. Get a grip."

You *would* find Souleimani's equivalent in both ranking and responsibility in the Mafia however. Only *there* will you find someone who's respected at the same time he's committing atrocities."
