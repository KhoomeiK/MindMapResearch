I don't know why you would spend time in a sub that makes you feel that way. You'd be better off finding some incels to bitch and moan and be miserable with, you're clearly so deep into their bullshit nothing else matters to you."

*1053kcal*?? I only eat 1600kcal a day, that's like omitting most of a day's intake for me. No wonder these subjects have had ""diet resistance""."
AmItheAsshole,fevhxih,t3_eqor6p,1579397673.0,"YTA, and overly sensitive. If you weren't insecure about being fat and really ""owned"" your poor food choices, you wouldn't have gone into a tizzy over some harmless banter and this post wouldn't exist.

The cashier was only joking around, if he was trying to be rude or malicious he could have said so much worse! I mean come on, fat person throws a pile of candy on the counter? That's a lot of ammunition. He was just trying to be funny, not personally attack you.

As an aside, the fact that you drove to multiple stores just looking to cash in on a candy deal is ridiculous to me tbh.

Edit: Lol OP didn't like her judgement, deleted all her comments here and then commented on her other ask post like ""fuck AITA they're all loser nerds who live in their mom's basement!!"" Lovely"

Tbh the only death in DR2 that gave me the chills was >!Ibuki's!<. The entire build up to discovering that body both had me on edge and made my skin crawl. 

I'm not sure what it is about hanging. It just elicits this visceral reaction of ""oh, holy shit *no*"" in me."

danganronpa,fcb4hvq,t3_egyjxi,1577582239.0,"Completely, 100% agree. As the RPing and metaness has ramped up, I've been frequenting the sub less and less. This sub was one of my favorites until it got taken over by all the RPers and inside references. It has just been cliquey and weird for awhile now. 

I'm *very* happy about rule 9. I'm looking forward to the sub going back to being about Danganronpa, rather than serving as a place to host peoples' RPs and circlejerks about each other. That stuff was ruining the sub tbh, it was annoying and not what I was looking for from a Danganronpa subreddit. Rule 9 is going to save the sub for me!"
