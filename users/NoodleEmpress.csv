I sat next to a similar ""weird kid"" last semester and was put in a group with him.

He would mutter very inappropriate things during class (he would read hentai and mutter about how hot and sexy the loli girls were, nothing directed to the professor though), he told me to go fuck myself under his breath when I didn't answer a question he asked me right away, called me an asshole when I expected him to do work that I assigned him during our project and he didn't do it. 
Also, his muttering was barely mutter at all, he was pretty loud. Sitting next to him made it worse because I can't hear/listen very well (not diagnosed with anything) and his ""muttering"" made my issues 100% worse. Also couldn't move because where we were sitting was the only place I could hear the professor properly and see the slides or whatever. All sorts of stuff. I just ignored all of it because I assumed from the beginning that he might have had a disability and boy what an asshole I would've been deemed as if I complained to someone.

It turned out that he *did* high functioning autism, and the professors just gave him his needed accomodations and ignored his outbursts.

I wrote it down as soon as I was finished crying), etc.), but it was very quick. The labor took up most of the dream. I remember that I felt this gut wrenching pain. I screamed for help but no one came. Suddenly I'm in my childhood bed and the environment is beautiful. The walls were so white, there were new curtains up, the bed was so clean and made. Then there was me, screaming naked on the bed while my dad just sat on the side and calmly watched, my mom was just calmly telling me to push.

Next this ""baby"" pops out with blood all over it. No, not the regular amount of blood and placenta, but like this baby was DRENCHED in blood. You could barely make out its features,it was just that thick, and there was just blood *everywhere.* Then this chilr just started screaming bloody fucking murder like a banshee!

thesims,fdm9gi7,t3_em0f5u,1578543140.0,"I think the *worst* ever was in the Sims 3 where I basically used this one son as a punching bag. Ever since he was born, I just... hated him. But I didn't want to kill him right away. I'm pretty sure I fed him only spoiled food to make him sick on purpose, made him a vegetarian and gave him meat, only spoke to him when his social needs were extremely low, and locked him in isolation. He finally died when he was a teen and I called the game's bluff that he was starving. I thought I had time to give him a little something before he died, guess I was wrong. I killed the whole family in the end anyway because I felt too bad. Guess his death was for nothing. 

There was that one time I was fooling around with teen pregnancy in the Sims 2 (Either with InTeenimator or the Tombstone of LorD or something like that). Basically I had a daughter, and I had a storyline where she was this great girl, destined for a brilliant and rich future, and it all came crashing down when she got pregnant in early teen hood. I made her get bullied by her family, her boyfriend left her, and she basically got abused by this other shmuck who crawled into her life. Well by adulthood she was much better! She had a job, her kid was doing well developmentally, she left behind most of her family, and she made amends with the rest. She even left her new abusive bf! Don't know what got into me but I readded both exes to the family. I never had them get together with my sim, as she had her eyes on someone else. Being the salty bastards they were, they decided to team up and vowed to ""get back at her"". 
My sim ended up having a second baby with her newest boyfriend. She and the two men she lived with all took care of the baby, and everything was *seemingly* going well. Well, one night my sim wanted a date night; She came back home, hungry and tired, which was convenient for the exes. Her exes told her that they made her a ""special"" dinner so she could relax. 

After she finished eating they ""revealed"" that they bbq'd the baby (also a mod) and gave it to her. After learning that she ate her own kid, she had a breakdown where she locked herself and her first born in a room to die from a fire, but unfortunately only the child died from the fire. For some reason. I felt so bad for her in the end that I started a fire the second time for her to die in, which she did. I later killed the exes by summoning flies FWIW, and just moved on with a new story."

I fucked up in my first gen when I made this one man basically impregnate the whole town. Now everybody's someone's cousin, and I have to add in new sims to diversify. Hopefully the family trees grow long enough where some of the family relations get lost, and I can get some royal family esque incest stuff going on, and the family trees can literally go full circle. It's literally like one big silly soap opera, and I'm living for it.

My main goal was to connect all of my played household family trees. Like if I click around the family trees, I should be able to jump around through all of them without switching sims.

Then, I rub any thick lotion I have available on my hands.

I tend to find that oils dry my hands out more *personally,* but if you haven't tried it I would say to give it a go. I heard that jojoba and castor oil works great for dry hands.

I now know what works and what doesn't, I know my budget and my limits, so I know what to rebuy, and what not rebuy, I just have to not give into temptations.

- unsubscribing to these YouTube gurus because they were a big part in convincing me to keep buying more and more stuff.

- spending more time with my other hobbies like playing my instrument or painting, you know instead of going to Ulta or Sephora

- Focusing more on skincare (a routine that is also becoming more concrete for me, so hopefully I won't indulge money in that instead), so I won't feel like I need the makeup I wear

Thing is, there are others who were ripped apart more than me on the forum and are constantly made fun of, and they take it in stride. I. Couldn't. Handle. It. At all.


I had a mini breakdown, and wrote in my little blog thing (on the same site) what was going on in my head, and I logged out. It's almost going to hit a whole year since I haven't officially logged in, and tbh I don't feel like logging back in any time soon. 

I realized that the site was making me waaaay too dependent on the amount of laughs, likes, or hugs I got and it was becoming truly *unhealthy*. 

Reddit does the same to me too, but I feel like with unlike that other site where it was less people and a bit more personal that there's less at stake? Like with Reddit, I feel like when I'm personally scrolling I don't even read usernames or anything. It's *mostly* anonymous, so if I say something dumb again at least I can ignore it and move on (hoping that someone doesn't stalk my comment history).
On that old site? That shit is gonna follow me forever.

Good on you for recognizing that there might be a problem in putting so much weight in a site and how people view you.

Anout the friend, maybe she didn't feel the need to reply, or maybe felt like no more needed to be said. She saw the meme and moved on. It probably wasn't a slight against you. I've done it before, usually for the reasons of not knowing how to give a reply that's not some variation of ""lol"" or ""lmaooo"""

beauty,fct7fto,t3_ei77h1,1577934869.0,"- Stay consistent to my Replacement Only No Buy, I already started late 2019, but I hope to continue going for 2020 

- Keep taking my Multi Vitamins consistently, I already do and I see great improvements in my hair and skin, but I hope to continue the consistency in 2020

- Finalize my skincare routine, I learned in 2019 that creme products are way too heavy, the oily or light products do little for me, and gels and serums are my skin's happy medium. That info to me is a good start because then I won't be buying products that I know my skin might hate.

- Create a realistic exercise routine to lose this weight. Includes things such as walking only instead of taking the campus shuttle unless absolutely necessary

- Adopt a pescatarian/modified Mediterranean diet 

- Do my nails more. Makeup not so much, but I do want to get a handle of eyeshadow and concealer


- As for clothes, stick to my low buy. I buy one piece per month. No more, less is preferably. I have this bad habit of going to the shops when I'm bored and then buying unnecessary clothes. My plan is to occupy my free time with my hobbies or schoolwork instead. If seen through, this would make me more critical of the pieces I buy, and I SHOULD be saving more money.

- Take care of myself more, I look like a bum like 355 days out of the yearly 365, and it makes me feel bad everytime I look back at pics but it feels like I was doing my best then. Sigh, it's like I never do enough, so I hope making this year the year I improve myself improves that aspect as well.

- Better oral health, I started scraping my tongue last year and it dies wonders imo. Now I want to start flossing as well. Maybe find a way to lighten my gums 

- Consistant hair routine, I'm closing in what my hair likes, and I've been FINALLY seeing some noticeable growth. Hopefully that leads to some thicker hair growth."

I got back into music playing and making, forced myself to play all of my untouched video games, learned to watercolor, etc

From what I get from your post she wasn't being overly rude or demanding, probably just direct if anything.

You wouldn't be an asshole for not giving her the name, because while branding is important, she doesn't really *need* it. I'm sure she could probably work something out with Instagram or her sponsors if she was that popular. Nbd.

And let me just be clear, assuming that you're not a business owner and don't really have a brand, giving her the name with no fuss *would* be the nice non-assholeish thing to do. But again, it's just an Instagram account, not something that's more substantial."

AskReddit,fck9p1l,t3_eh9zw2,1577720327.0,"When I was back into stuff like Jfash, Alt fashion, scene, emo etc a lot of the people that were promoted were skinny as fuck and imo gorgeous.  

So in the late 00's and in the early 10's (basically when I was an impressionable kid/preteen) I basically got sucked into and loved those ""thinspo"" and ""proana"" accounts that also fashioned as well fashion accounts on Tumblr. These girls (and sometimes) boys were *clearly* unhealthy, and I used to defend them posting all the time. I wanted to be like them so bad because I was convinced that only short thin people with childlike figures could look cute in the clothes I liked.

Luckily I never developed any diagnosable eating disorder because

1) I loved fast and starchy carbed foods waaaay too much

2) My mom saw where this obsession was going, and nipped my insecurities in the bud. She told me that I would never look like that without making myself sick (I thought I could).
 My  dad's family (the side where I apprently get my size from) are all thicc people. We, the women, aren't fat, but our bodies are just a little bigger. If I were to get that thigh gap like the girls on Tumblr then I would have to literally starve myself.

3) The body positive movement/HAES came rolling on out soon after and I saw more thicker people wearing the fashion I liked
I did get this unhealthy relationship with food though which has caused me to get anything BUT skinny so there's that.

Now I sit back and think on it all, and I realize that wow that shit was awful and I 100% used to be okay with it. I feel for the girls who are now growing up looking at that shit, and don't have momma's that'll snatch them away when they start getting too deep like mine did.

Oh yeah, sugar. When I was a kid I LOVED sweets. Candies, sugar, sodas etc.. Now I can barely lick some frosting without gagging for the sweetness."

Sadly I live in tropical climates, and may never find the use for one unfortunately. I'm cool with both coming back into style, but you gotta think of the climate and practibility. If the world's getting hotter... Well, I'm not sure if it'll come back the way people think it would. Especially in the way people are writing in this thread. IF capes or cloaks had to come back, they would have to be very airy to accommodate for hot temperatures, they would have to be made to fit our more casual way of dressing, and they would have to be made not to knock into to things, or get caught in automated doors.

AskReddit,fc3zz18,t3_efqzp6,1577403014.0,"Lots of things. It's not as bad as other things that are written, but still pretty shitty nonetheless:

- We aren't home for Christmas. My dad got sick last year and my parents are stuck living in the continent in this cramped miserable apartment until he is healthy enough to go down, and not need to be rushed down to a hospital. As a result we are separated from our culture, our family, our large house, etc. It fucking sucks. I tried my best by making small cultural trest throughout the day and by playing traditional music, but my mom was still very homesick. :( All she was talking about was that next year will be better because she'll be home.

- With my dad being as sick as he is, I had this underlaying fear that this was going to be his last Christmas and I was upset that this Christmas was pretty miserable and shitty instead of memorable, warm, and fun. 

- Mom invited us all to this buffet dinner because she couldn't afford elaborate presents for everyone this year like usual. Medical bills are hitting us hard unfortunately. She decided to pay for everyone and the tab came out to be a whooping $200 (which was kind of okay because she expected as much). What made it was that we also made the mistake of inviting this cousin+bf who are often rude and ungrateful. She bragged about how ""They can pay for themselves, *bf* has money"", and lo and behold when they came they didn't bring any money. They didn't even any money for tips. Anyway, instead of a ""Good night/Merry Christmas"" or even a hug, she just... extends her arm out for my kom to just *give* her the debit card. No asking or anything and even her bf thought it was rude as hell. Later that night she talked shit about the buffet and was saying to some other cousins that we should have went to a *fancier* restaurant..... Despite her not bring able to pay for themselves last night. The kicker at the end of the night was that they gave my mom attitude and didn't even tell her thank you. Smh

- Uncle and aunt were no better. They were antsy, dismissive, rude, and they were rushing us to go home so they could drink and smoke. Uncle moaned the whole night about how the food was soooo terrible and how he would have never picked here (well he never gave any other suggestions so)

- My dad (who is physically and a bit mentally disabled) gorged himself and puked in the parking lot as soon as we exited. This family who also had a daughter with a disability (so I would have thought that they would have been a bit more sympathetic/undsrstanding) laughed at us, and called my dad nasty names. :("

You - You broke your momma's windowscreen bro. Who does that? Well I guess, *you*, but I've never heard of people doing so outside of movies or whatnot. Could have used the front/back door. ADDITIONALLY, while I do *understand* why you would feel embarrassed I can imagine that if you came clean from the get go whatever bias some of your family had (or definitely has now) would have been avoided. Let's look at this through some of your family's eyes:

Your nephew/son/cousin suddenly breaks up with his *seemingly* nice girlfriend that he was just about to get married to. The fact that it was so sudden is concerning, but whatever.
 You don't push it too much, but you have your assumptions. Sarah finally says that it just wasn't working out and you were not ready for marriage (idk, could be anything. But it she definitely didn't say it was because she cheated and it was definitely something that wasn't so bad where they want you to get back together). So matriarch invites her to the house to work things out (you would be surprised to learn how many people think that this is an appropriate thing to do), and instead of OP confronting Sarah or just... leaving out the front door, he jumps through the window? Well, now you know that the breakup was bad, and that OP probably had something to do with it since he *jumped through a window*.
As for your sister? At this point she probably thinks it's the other way around now, or completely believes Sarah because you didn't come clean.

Do you owe your family an explanation? No

Should your mom be playing matchmaker/Maury? No
 
Should Sarah be trying to weasel her way back into the family? No

Are you the asshole for all of the events that happened to you? No
But you ARE for how you acted at this time. 
Get some therapy, apologize for breaking the windowscreen, and go get your head straight, man (if that's by cutting them off for a bit then that's cool. 
Mom, sister, and Sarah are assholes for reasons mentioned above..

Personally I think you should pull your mom or any other trusted family member and tell them the full truth. Maybe do it in a family counseling environment if you can afford it and if you can't handle telling the truth that well. Because yeesh..
