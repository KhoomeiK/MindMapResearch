TTC30,feug8yz,t3_eqbn07,1579386235.0,"After more nasty comments by my mother in law today that literally caused me to walk away from the table we were all eating at (by excusing myself today the bathroom for an extended period of time) my husband decided to quietly tell my awesome father in law on the side about our fertility complications.  He was genuinely surprised the complications are on my husbands side, but he understood and I’m hoping he has that discussion with my mother in law because all of her comments are out of bounds.  He was super nice about it when I mentioned that the added pressure and nasty comments aren’t helping us any as we quietly and privately struggle with this.

All as I wait for my period to show up tomorrow after a temp drop.  Another failed cycle."

AskReddit,fcilyc1,t3_eh4nfa,1577664780.0,"Another one.  I had just gotten kicked out of the Peace Corps (for defending myself against a man who attacked me) and I was on my second flight home.  I was a mess having had my lifelong dream shattered.  I was 25 and was seated next to a young (19) year old soldier named Casey with a lovely smile.  We discussed our very different circumstances, traded some cools stuff we had on us from our travels.  At the end he wrote his number down (which I lost headed to the couch I slept on for 10 weeks) but told me he was leaving for Afghanistan in 9 days.  He was just home to see family before he left.  He also asked to kiss me before he left.  I was single and happily obliged despite the age difference.  I hope Casey made it back unharmed and is doing well.  He was a wonderful person and I still have the random item we traded."

They were not in my conference, I have no idea who they were there for or why, or who if anyone, they represented, but it was cool to see."

While sharing a meal with him on our last night we asked him if he had any burning questions that he may be hesitant to ask that he was curious about or just had to know.

He asked us about a rumor he heard that we have eggs that you can pour out if a bottle/carton.  That was his number one burning question.  We explained about them, what they are and that while they exist, most people use normal eggs.  We did tell him Americans have to refrigerate their eggs though and why."

I’m not emotionally ready for the stomach states and womb inquisitions tomorrow even though it’s none of their damn business."
