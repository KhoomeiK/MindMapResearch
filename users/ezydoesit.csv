It's too bad that some self centered jerks think the world revolves around them and have absolutely no regard for how disruptive their actions are towards others.  That's when we should be able to count on the By-Law people to take action on our behalf!"

Wow, this is well thought out.  I had to laugh because I have imagined this scenario a few times.  I wasn't going to do any real damage, just put a banana in the muffler or something like that.

The house is rented by a bunch of foreign speaking men that I don't want to have any problems with.  They have at least two cars a night parked out on the road almost every night.  I have called in the past about this but try to cut them some slack so I haven't called in a long time.  

I don't want to call the police for something that is not an emergency.  If it is reported to Mississauga By-Law, they should act upon it.

Toronto has attempted to address this problem, we need to band together and get Mississauga to take action.

It will literally wake me up from sleep!  The really unfortunate thing is, he likes to start it up and wait a long time before leaving. I'm talking 20 min or longer.  I'm not sure if he has a remote start or gets in and checks emails etc.

Lately, he has take to going out for a snack around 1:00 in the morning.  His car can be heard booming away for blocks.

Now before you say phone the city and report it, I have and it has fallen on deaf ears.  They basically said there is nothing they can do.  This can't be true, there must be some sort of noise violation.

Here is an example of what we are subjected to.

Get yourself a huge piece of paper.  Make a grid, put all of the things you want across the top, parking, animals allowed, rent etc.
Then, down the side, put the address & phone number of the place so you are not calling the same places back over and over.  Within a few days you will have amassed a good amount of info to help you make a decision.

""Friend"" went to check on the dog and found it had pooped/pissed in the house and perhaps done other damage.  In a rage, they put the poor doggie in a suitcase and discarded her.  They planned to tell the owner the dog ran away.

No decent person would do this to their own dog.  This is beyond sick!"
