They excused that as a 'structured transactional agreement' or some similar weasel phrase.

Of course, what it really came down to is they defaulted and had their HQ foreclosed on.

Which is exactly the same as it would be for any mortgage holder. The terms are in the contract agreement. If you don't pay, the bank takes the property. That is the resolution.

During the whole process, NAR tried to pain their foreclosure as some sort of pure white business arrangement. When, in reality, they were simply walking away like any home owner in foreclosure.

Lying bastards."

That said, I would be more than happy to fund the college educations of millions of people by paying a bit more in taxes. Why not? It wouldn't benefit anyone in my family. My son is 27 and has his own career well under way, again without college, and is making great money as a top manager at a well known national company.

He, also, has said he'd be happy to pay extra in taxes to benefit future generations, including current students and future students (which may include his own future children).

So, if someone is suspected and an investigation reveals a bunch of calls from a number no one wants to talk about, that could be helpful to the school investigating.

I'm not really FOR the added scrutiny, I guess. Just one more hurdle for coaches and compliance. And I'd like to think that *most* coaching staff has enough integrity to be trustworthy. Why would you hire someone who was not? That seems like courting disaster.

There are always outliers and strange circumstances, but I think we should treat staff like actual adults until they prove otherwise.

A big incentive not to cheat. Because you get caught and you get fired for cause. No questions asked, no negotiations or back and forth and no settlements in or out of court.

history,ff80q2h,t3_es4a4p,1579662966.0,">Now a few of the generals actually proposed this. But they were always denied. The Soviets had no atom bombs at the time which basically just means we could nuke them (Not that we would), and they couldn't nuke us. That threat alone could have caused them to leave.

This could be easily rephrased as ""What IF the allies attempted to drive the Soviet Union out of Europe?""

As such, it is more appropriate for the suggested sub. If you would like to rephrase this we can take another look. However, as it currently stands, the post is essentially a giant 'What If' that covers mostly speculative ground, and is therefore not appropriate here.

The /r/HistoryWhatIf sub is a great place for these questions. If you are more interested in the scholarly works that can cite the reasons and thoughts by the people who made those decisions, we would recommend /r/AskHistorians They are the professionals who can provide the most details answers.

Thank you."

science,ff5pp6s,t1_ff5pa9v,1579605049.0,"That sounds like the Holy Grail for many or most types of cancer.

This would be an absolute revolution in treatment, should it work in humans.

I hope no company decides to buy out the research and patent it to charge millions per patient. That would be criminal.

And, this looking way, way ahead, I wonder if such a targeted treatment could be used to affect other cancers that are typically far more difficult. Like passing the brain barrier to treat brain cancer, among other notoriously hard to reach or treat cancers.

It seems, it feels I suppose, that we are on the cusp of something huge.

Of course, we have all seen miracle cures come and go. But this one seems different. And I have always held a cynical view. I think it's because this was purely an accident and seems to work right out of the gate.

Fingers crossed!"

It could be a life saver for millions. If it works in people the way it has thus far in animals and petri dishes.

This could actually be the one. I know we have all seen so many hyped promises, but this one seems very different. In part, to me, because it was completely by accident, I suppose.

We shall see. I hope it goes well. And is inexpensive as suggested."

Would this be done in large quantities like plasma for blood replacement?

Would/will it require differentiation for different blood types?

Or will it require taking some t-cells from each patient and activating the proper receptor, then sending those cells back into each individual?

What about air craft carriers? Some of these super rich actually have that kind of money.

- ***It breaks rule 12:*** **No Atrocity Olympics** Atrocities aren't an Olympic event, to be compared and scored according to how 'bad' they were. All mass killings, crimes against humanity, aggression, and repression are terrible, and while it is important to be able to contextualize the scope of a given event, boiling that scope down to a number to argue on a top-ten list or 'worst of' thread both denies the humanity of what happened and cheapens the severity of the crimes.
    We invite and indeed encourage discussion of atrocities. It is vital that we transparently analyze and keep such tragedies in living memory, so that they are understood and never repeated. But that needs to be done in their own context. If you would like to rephrase your submission to focus more on the history of a given event or set of events, and less on just comparing subjective 'badness', we can reconsider. But as written, we cannot approve this submission.
