depression,felyomg,t1_felylie,1579234338.0,I guess. It’s like I purposefully push people away sometimes and I can’t even control the fact that I do it. Even the people I love I push away because I’m not even sure I can feel love anymore
depression,felyk29,t1_felyfuo,1579234238.0,"Ya that’s what I meant. I take comfort in my sadness because sometimes it’s the only thing that I can feel, and that feels real to me.

depression,fdfomke,t1_fdfluua,1578366524.0,Maybe you just don’t have a great therapist then. Try to find help in other ways if you can I guess or switch to a better therapist or different type of therapy and maybe try medication cuz there’s no shame in that. But good luck with all that depression and self harm it’s some nasty stuff. And you can always pm me if u want to talk btw

Advice,fdflih0,t3_el4oi8,1578364484.0,Make a joke about it or something to help him shrug it off. Or just straight out tell him exactly what you just posted so he knows that you’re loyal to him and won’t cheat. Good relationships you should be honest and make it clear exactly how you feel.
depression,fdflbfy,t3_el4ok7,1578364356.0,Definitely mention it. It’s uncomfortable and weird to know that your parents know about that kind of stuff but in the end it’s better that you tell them. Therapists will usually understand this kind of thing they have been trained to and it’s also probably not the first time something like this has happened to them.
depression,fdfl4if,t3_el4oli,1578364226.0,Yup it’s been a rough start for me too but don’t lose hope it’s always the worst before it get better!

I’m pretty young and I don’t really have much advice, but if I were you I would see a therapist. It may be hard to make the first step and go to see one, but they can really help you more than you think. Best of luck. Btw it’s not stupid at all and it’s actually very brave to post this on the Internet. Some people can’t do that and I applaud you for it."
depression,fdfkklm,t3_el4o3f,1578363865.0,I feel. It really sucks when you feel like everyone’s looking at you. You seem to have handled it the best you could have and there really wasn’t much you could have done. You’re beautiful inside and real people will see you for that. :)))
