googlehome,ff3j2ln,t3_erc0si,1579542112.0,"If your new to google ecosystem,,,, well that frustration it's going to be something you are going to get use to especially with the smart home experience .  So as it stands everybody experience this same thing. 

my 12 year olds account was a nightmare to get connected,. Part of the problem is it takes a long time to get it connected.
I was on the phone with technical support (a whole new level of frustration I swear to God they just read from cue cards) anyways, What I had to do was make sure all the settings and features are complete in the family link profile,  including voice recognition.. This is a key component for the home to work. 

 I would like to make a observation of my home set up Once the voice recognition is complete you can add them through the family link app.  As a example I have 11 devices between the nest mini, nest hub and home mini  and two Chromecast. My kids are only on 4 of them. So here's what you do 

 In the family link app select whichever child your a are adding
 
*Manage settings 

*Google assistant
 
*Add - your child- to new device 



(this is where whatever devices that are already connected to your google home ecosystem show up) 

You can select what they have device they access to, you can retrain voice commands 

Ect. 


I am a android user and no nothing about the Apple ID stuff, but this is how you add children to devices. 

to be clear you can't add children straight to your google ""home"" as they will never show up there but if you go to the settings of whatever device it will show your kids listed as a linked account after you follow the above instructions"

Android,fetc12w,t1_fet77pj,1579373747.0,"No but it changes the direction for the purpose of what Chromebooks were for.. If I wanted to video edit or sound engineer for music, I would not look for a Chromebook. 

The ecosystem and user experience is not designed for that market. The moment you change that now im paying a extra 300 to Chromebook because now it has 4k screen resolutions, over the top storage  capacity, higher  video cards, larger battery capacities.. 

All things not needed on a simple piece of equipment designed around a ecosystem for general word /data  processing, web browsing , netflix / simple entertainment. 

Also if you have used a lower end spec windows  laptop you will understand why Chromebooks thrive in that price range market, but You are right if I wanted the higher range like the pixel book ($1000 range) I would switch to windows"

Calgary,fcmmj0f,t3_ehy4dl,1577781642.0,"I believe all that are a problem as a business. I ordered  tires and booked an appointment at the deer ridge location, had my wife bring my vehicle in because I was away at work. They told her the tires weren't available and tried to sell her more expensive tires, I told her to leave the shop cancel the appointment and I will deal with it.. 

I looked online with their website to order tires. it says it's in stock.   I  called with the information they say they don't have them in stock at their location( I guess the website could of been wrong) and the closest location that had them is in Quebec. I was cool with waiting for them. They said they would order them they said it would take a week. 

I waited a week to see if they were in apparently the tires weren't ordered but they did have x tire available (the one they tried to sell my wife) instead of ordering them... The beet solution I had was I just went to Costco. 

It's just shady business tactics. I'm pretty certain no one tire shop has a specific supplier, and that you will pretty much get the same rough price on tires, or  tire selection that can be ordered.

But to answer your question you have the receipt, that shows what was purchased, go back and have the situation rectified. They have a head office, contact them with the name of personal involved."

All that responsibly and  airlines feels this response team is only worth minimum wage levels of pay. By saying they are emergency responders because they have first aid and know CPR and understand standard flight  protocols  is a bit of a stretch. 

I agree with your statement about knowing protocols, but they are still onboard to serve passengers. 
They do not actually have the authority to make decisions on the plane in terms of safety, they follow orders given by the authority (pilots), they can say a passenger is becoming a problem on a plane but its the pilot who makes the decision for the outcome. They don't have the ability to make a decision to have a plane grounded. 

I can not just go back and serve myself. Nothing to do with being impatient, just I can't freely take complimentary products from the back of the plane. 

This is not to take away from the point that they are concerned about your safety over serving you snacks.  I just wouldn't put them on the same level as a emergency response unit. The plane is experiencing turbulence (that the pilot determines you to remain seated) they ensure everyone is seated. Unless they are studying to become a surgeon or MD  they have standard first aid and aren't able to conduct any medical diagnosis or medical feat onboard a flight. 

Obviously this is my opinion. But hey ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
