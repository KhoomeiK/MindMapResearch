Your point about a story is not something I agree with, as even in supers games it’s the same as in OSR: make situations not stories. Player agency is more important than the GM telling a story, by many factors. Stories are for books. Games are for playing, for puzzles or situations, for dilemmas, trilemmas, conundrums, and disasters. That’s one thing I don’t like about most YouTube attempts at critical role games: Mercer is a performer and talks too much for a GM of a game. He’s good but it’s not the best example for a real game."

I was going over the posts in a word document, trying to sort out individual points, but then realized that's too fine-combed. I'll try to generalize.

1)  If you're complaining about someone whose writing or the organization of their writing isn't clear enough, but you're doing it in a way that's also disorganized and unclear, it looks bad.  This can include when you're dumping on them about the clarity of descriptions; or where they put monsters either in the encounter or at the back of the book; or whatever. It's not just the typos, it's broader than that.

2)  Being a blog doesn't exempt you from adequate clarity of writing, as they're both intended for public consumption. I disagree with everyone that has said he doesn't get paid. It shows up on Feedly, it talks about whether other people's writing is good or bad, it counts. Broad strokes, not fiddling with format or giving out passes because I like him or I don't like me (no one read into that phrasing!), it's writing on writing that judges writing so it counts! I still value your right to say that you don't care about it, but it is a point that I'm bringing up.

2.a) If anyone is okay to have a shitty wall of text complaint it's ME on REDDIT!

2.b)  I'm replying to your critique of my critique of your critique. Just going to pause at how meta this. Pretty sure if we keep going we'll travel through time... to the very near future!

3)  As a custodian of the game (and honestly, you are one) your voice matters. It influences the industry - which is great! More locally it matters to your fan club here (although as of this writing I haven't been downvoted into the dirt, which is surprising; like I honestly thumbed my nose at your blog rather acerbically, and people have been vocal about calling me on it, but I'm still at exactly zero. Saying anything will probably tilt the balance, but I'm surprised my karma isn't in the negatives with the booing.)  

3.a)  Your voice also matters to the writers who get back to you with their responses to the criticism, whether they take your advice to heart or not.  

3.b) It also matters to me, a reader, as apparently I thought it was harsh enough to pretend I was a low rent Thomas Swift, which is not my usual way of being. Which is to say maaaaaaayyyyybe it's worth considering looking at?

4)  I agree that a great deal of mulch is pushed out onto the RPG public. Lots of it is bad, really bad, often because people do things like what you're discussing. You're not wrong.

4.a) Although there is an undercurrent of ""too much writing"". I didn't pick up on that you were saying that it was specific to bad description text. That's my read, but as I may have said, it's what I was seeing over a number of entries. 

I think ""Too much of THEIR writing with their mistakes"" (ie: ignoring player agency) is the problem.  It's not you, but my read of your stuff over the last little while hasn't picked up on the difference.  I fully believe you know about it, but as an idiot who hasn't been there for your entire run (Geezey pete, ten years is gob-smackingly good for a blog) I can only go by what I've seen. Flawed as that is (not may be but is, yes) that's the impression that I got.

5) I also want to recognize you've forced yourself to wade through it to the betterment of us all, a feat which I know to be well beyond my instinct for preservation of sanity. Thank you for that.

6)  The RPG community has a large number of people with serious social problems. I'm talking about people who aren't just rude jerks (yes, sorry), I'm talking about the really nice, really quiet, silently suffering with depression and other serious problems types. We're including the titans of the industry, sure, but guys like, I don't know, Monte Cook or Joseph Goodman (a) are big shots, (b) have money?, and have (c) thicker skin for criticism built from eons of rejection that is patched with success. That's not everyone, and the amateurs who are giggling at the idea that someone could pay(?!) them for their precious, precious RPG writing? No way. They're delicate people. I've met one who we had a great time hanging out but he wouldn't give me a copy of his heartbreaker because he was super shy - and no I didn't get snippy on Reddit, I'm pretty sure I was more charming than usual. At least Charisma 6, which is impressive for me. The point being, it's easier than you might expect for people to click a box. This isn't the acting industry (which is way too harsh at times), or business. 

6.a)  Note: you're not wrong, it's just... maybe easier after years of blogging to be focused on other things than kid gloves?

7)  If we're too blunt, the right people will chicken out of putting really good stuff out there. If I'm too blunt, no one will play at my table.

7.a) Oh God... I think I've had a self-realization... No, no... No. I'm - I'm totally fine. It's them.  (hugs volleyball friend)

8)   Contrary to someone's claim that I'm saucy over you reviewing my work, the joke is on them: No one has ever read my stuff, certainly not admitted it via review (for shame of association I'm sure). If you had you'd be one of three people who did read it, including Goodman (who had to because it was a 3pp DCC adventure and he had to make sure there weren't rape-snakes or something. To be clear, there were not), and a community member who gave feedback beforehand (who disappeared shortly after reading it, in a freak snow storm - not the location, which was Canada, but even then July is a strange month for blizzards).  Probably for the best."

I’m bothered by aspects of your articles, but that makes me think and react, which is good. I have strong feelings about the topics, and maybe it’s because you’re someone who can understand what I’m talking about?

If so (and the typos, geez!!) then I will happily sing his praises. 

I should disclose a story that might illustrate why I am going on about this; it’s not Bryce, I don’t know him except through his blog. Anyway: I had a GM who I thought was good at strong challenges but it turned out he was just a sadistic person. The escape room scenario was not intended to be solved but rather to cause actual stress to the players and get the characters to fight each other. There was no solution. The interesting scenario was actually just in my head, and a mask I put on the actual situation which was not what I thought it was at all. 
I’m hopeful that Bryce is more than just someone who punches down, I do. I have read as much of the blog as I can, and I will continue to keep up with it via Feedly; but I don’t like saying nothing when there’s a problem, and after dozens of articles it seems like that is all that I read."
osr,feitaf8,t1_feiogkn,1579146641.0,"Fair point and I have a question: how does he know if he doesn’t run them? And is it just not liking the reading not running module style? Fine, but it’s not helping the cottage industry or, more realistically, the volunteer GMs who put their hearts on their books and put them out there. 
To be blunt, it’s like going to a community center art fair and dumping on someone’s Nana because they don’t have the talent of Caravaggio. Yes, we know that. It’s a mixed bag, and that is the beauty of access that drivethrurpg gives: anyone can post, from the greats to the novices.
And I stand by the comment that it’s public self-gratification! There is zero constructive criticism, and only showing off by putting others down.
Fine, Bryce can tell when something is not good. But (a) the horrible errors, typos and such, all over the blog is a sign that he’s also pretty bad at this, and (b) he has yet to prove that he can do the one thing that matters: take the modules (probably first drafts with no real revisions, and based off the notes of the writer when they ran the game; or even just prettifying the notes before showing them publicly), and either do a good job himself or (my preference) workshop a module with the writer and offer advice that fixes the end product. 
Right now it’s just the dumping on novices. It’s punching down."

I still have a theory that the function of sports is to keep aggression focused on sports and not local violence and raids. Human beings and especially many males are physically violent and aggressive, but if they aren’t put into a situation where they have a tribal group that can “slaughter” another tribal group, they get their aggression out in other ways. Note that North America has not had a widespread military conflict on its soil since the civil war (ignoring singular attacks like Pearl Harbor that quickly moved overseas and away from the continent. Local violence, especially racial violence, is not channeled via sports, so maybe it’s a supportive example?). Local sports teams are I believe a major one of the factors that have allowed the modern western civilization to be the way it is. If other regions can grow their sports culture, more than it is now, that can help.
If we don’t do the sports, the economy goes to heck because everyone is killing each other.
This was humanity for many thousands of years.
While I agree that it is a shame that the reality of the sports skill and spirit of the women at the top level of play is not getting the respect it deserves, I wonder if it is a comfort that at least women don’t need the level of special attention and organized pretend War that more aggressive, perhaps less civilized (though not less intelligent; they can be clever about violence or sport) men need?
I’m a man, and I have never been passionate about sports. The culture of sports people is alien to me. The things I like, while brilliant, are not valuable to sports fans, any more than women’s sports are valued.
But I see the value of the skill of women’s sports. They have great games, great players.
The world will just never care about the things it should. 
Maybe that’s not why we should do them?
Maybe it’s a treasure to see the value, the truth, and not be just another person who doesn’t?"

But seriously, if you are Catholic, it's not a joke when you use branding for the rest of us. The US assassinated an Iranian leader, then bombs have been fired, and real people have died. Saying ""Catholic"" related to Iran at this point in history is idiotic. Perception of Catholics is so easily pointed towards the crusades, which really were about grifting europeans into taking over one of the major trade cities in the world. It was spices, money, and the war machine. Kingdom of Heaven is a too-simplistic version, but it makes a good point. 

Being ""nice"" is a relative term. If I can get through to you, and to others, in talking about this stuff on social media? That's a big deal.

What's your follow-up? So far you've got them on the run.

Will the comet still be a thing? Great backstory for sword material, plus whatever critters landed with it. 

Marco could be dead, but if you space it out you could freak them out with a reintroduction later on. Like they adventure for a while, get rich, and are invited to a wealthy party. Then they meet the new viscount, someone in from I dunno, fantasy-Vienna, who has some important rank or something.

But it's Marco!  He's all cleaned up, really rich, has the whole Count of Monte Christo thing going on.  Now he's connected, and claims to be someone very different from the axe-wielding maniac they met previously. The players won't be believed if they challenge him, or if they are then it's suddenly tense and perhaps deadly for their loyal host (see how the relationship they build up has gone, play it based on that).

And hey, maybe this whole time he's really Vandal Savage (see Justice League cartoon), who can be killed over and over but regenerates to full health at midnight or something?"

Credit to creators (ie: rightful credit) is 100% right.

I'm not sure ""100% free"" is good. Certain formats, yes. But there has to be a way to support artists/writers. Not a cash cow system, but basic needs.

What about a Patreon? The documents would be free but people could donate to the creators so they (we) can eat/pay rent/etc. Maybe I should ask him myself?

My point being this:  Not that gaming has ever been lucrative (it isn't, despite being vastly cheaper than other hobbies), but if there isn't a way for people to donate to the cause of getting the game out there then it means working class people can't justify the time spent working on it. If someone has enough money, fine - donate yours. But until basic income needs are covered for everyone (which is a good thing, btw, and perfectly reasonable for society to do now that we have automation the ability to do so), something like this punishes creatives who want to be able to work on a project while still meeting basic human needs in a currency-based society (whatever the flaws of the system, it's the current reality)."
osr,fda6rgn,t1_fda34wt,1578242374.0,"They seem to be finished making the Minotaur zine, as the last one had an editorial farewell from the designer. The community was on yahoo and google plus, and both are not working on my Mac or phone, or for google plus it’s long defunct.
Which is the problem: there is no hub for the community, and the creator seems to be uninterested in doing anything official. And because it’s a free game, and the creator doesn’t want to make it even a small for money publication, there is no srd or Creative Commons option for others to (for example) make a hack of the game. I mean I guess one could, but I’m not sure the legal issues. 
I started fiddling around with a class design, but I don’t know if I could even post it somewhere that it would be seen.
It’s a bizarre thing, and I kind of like poking at bizarre things to see what happens."

And where is Eno Cordova???"
