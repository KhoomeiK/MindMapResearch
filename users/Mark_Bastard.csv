AnimalsBeingBros,ffdwlj5,t1_ffdvhul,1579830729.0,"Most people call it 'Balanced' dog training now. Most training breaks down into 4 'quadrants' of [operant conditioning.](https://www.dog-training-excellence.com/operant-conditioning.html)

Some training exclusively only uses some of these (e.g. you've probably heard of 'positive reinforcement' training). For example give a treat when the dog does something good.

The efficacy of training methods is often confused with the perceived ethics, similar to how Vegans talk about meat being unhealthy. It's something to be aware of."

brisbane,ffddkig,t1_ffcu1xh,1579818632.0,That explains a random night from almost 20 years ago perfectly. It was an incredibly hot and humid day and when it turned to night there was literally no wind and the air turned to a horrible deathly fog that just sat there. It was maybe like 32 degrees and 100% humidity at 9pm with zero breeze. I remember going outside only to realise it was even worse and coming back inside but nothing helped. I had no air conditioning at the time. Horrible.

In particular, people place the aesthetic, ownership, life-chances abd activities, culture etc. and historically contingebt and changing things abd aspects of each together.

People generally prefer cartoonish views and usage of words to replace thoughts so to speak.

This is actually somewhat reccurring in other words. People get confused by inadvertebtly connecting different things signified by apparently 'the same' word.

In this case in my opinion besides reference to historical use, it is not of utikity to use this word as opposed to what we nean in each case"

stupidpol,few4joh,t1_feuughv,1579405254.0,"The exploitation can be mutual though. The 200k worker has much greater opportunity to freelance, potentially for more money but with more responsibility to do work outside their core skillset (e.g get and retain clients, finance work, basic admin). They implicitly opt-in to a system of mutual exploitation where they choose the certainty of more or less fixed pay and fixed hours.

This may be true of the person on 30k however the risk profile  is so much higher that they are far more coerced into wage slavery. The 200k person has the option of living like they are on 50k a year, then accumulating wealth to act as a safety net before freelancing. The person on 30k is so worried about access to basics like food and shelter they don't have that option."
