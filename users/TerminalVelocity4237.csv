facepalm,ff5jx0d,t1_ff5jox3,1579596395.0,"Feminism isn’t a specific sect of the movement for equal rights. It isn’t limited to a certain gender or a certain extreme set of opinions. Anyone who doesn’t want women to be restricted from the same equitable opportunities as men is a feminist, and this is sadly misunderstood. The ‘man-haters’ you are referring to may have their own name such as radfem or femcel and I think it would be helpful to call them by that to avoid poisoning the term feminist. Finally they could just be a crazy or bad person, the way a couple loud and toxic vegans are spoiling the idea for everyone, and in such a case it’s important to remember that they don’t speak for everyone"

insanepeoplefacebook,fe9a346,t1_fe9890i,1578935742.0,"Illness: a disease or sickness affecting the body or mind.

Saying dysphoria is a disease or a sickness suggests it is outside of a working order and caused by harmful sources and should be fixed, not treated. Dysphoria is not an illness in the same way autism or a sixth finger isn’t an illness. It isn’t caused, you’re born with it.

Now I’m done with specifics, can I please reiterate that the original comment you are defending is far more overtly transphobic than the word ‘illness’ and that trans people have little relevance to the content of the post itself. Even if you had won some pedantic battle of specifics it wouldn’t have made the original comment any less offensive.

Apologise, delete your comments or continue with the full implication of your argument as you see fit."
