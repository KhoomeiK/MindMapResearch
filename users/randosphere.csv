Ah. That tells us all we need to know. r/niceguys

>I feel like being ugly to certain degree would be fine for some girls/women

Talk about contradicting thought patterns. You claim you are ugly and therefore can't get women out of your race and league who you for some unfounded reason feel entitled to, yet also think ugly women have it easier when even a self described ugly guy is much more (possibly exclusively) interested in women who are better looking than himself. How would that train of thought make sense? 

You have a lot of work to do on yourself and I ain't talking about the looks department."

You can't get better in the place that's making you sick, and I urge you to do WHATEVER you can to get out of your situation.

Dogs aren't THAT hard to train. Your boyfriend needs to train that dog with a consistent effort, as well as offer discipline and boundaries. He doesn't even give enough of a fuck about his chronically ill girlfriend to keep the dog off the bed or allow some private intimacy snuggling on the couch. He has major issues you can't fix. No amount of asking him to put down even the most basic boundaries and structure for this dog is going to cause him to change.

Only AT&T and T-Mobile are GSM carriers. I have AT&T, so I have no problems using an international version phone (they are all GSM). Sprint is CDMA - a US only network (so is Verizon and US Cellular) - so you will need to pay close attention if you buy your phone from a marketplace seller and only purchase a phone marked CDMA compatible. Listings are almost always marked GSM or CDMA to avoid angry/unsatisfied customers but, if not, make sure you ask before buying. Probably assume international/GSM if it's not specifically listed as CDMA.

You've moved her to a new country every five years and she doesn't know the language. Do you know how difficult it is to exist on a daily basis in a country where you can't communicate with people? How difficult it is to learn an ENTIRELY new language? Even with strong mental health and a supportive partner, it's really fucking difficult. 

Your partner is mightily suffering with serious mental health issues and is stranded in a foreign country where she doesn't speak the language and lives with a partner who actively resents her.

raisedbynarcissists,fc0ilt0,t3_efdlx3,1577291647.0,"I can relate so much to this! When my mother's sister found out about my dad's physical abuse, she had to walk off for a moment to cry. My aunt never liked him due to his rude, self centered and verbally abusive behavior but tolerated him for the sake of her sister and the fact that she had ""nobody else"" because of my dad and his controlling, domineering, selfish ways. My mother frequently justified his abuse in ways very similar to your own mother.

It was so freeing for the family secret to finally be ""out."" And I was already in my late twenties at the time! My younger sister was visiting but had already married and moved overseas.

I now live in a large city away from them all and am NC, spending my 9th Christmas alone. Sometimes I feel lonely and depressed but it helps to remember what a shitshow the holidays used to be and then I feel tremendous relief. I'm glad your family secret is ""out,"" OP, and that the rest of your family seems normal and appropriately horrified. Here's to things getting better for you here on out and a joyous 2020!"
