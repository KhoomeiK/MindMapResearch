There were many times I was having a tough time making ends meet, and yes, my sons always came first.  I gave up a lot to have my horse.  I stopped buying nice clothes, getting manicures, going out, having a boyfriend, eating out, not having other hobbies and taking less care of myself.  I also quarter leased my horse to a friend, rented out my horse trailer, and allowed the barn to use her for lessons with beginner riders and little kids (her favorite because she didn't have put forth any effort).  As she aged and became less viable, I made the decision that if I had to give her up I would put her down."

relationship_advice,fcyf17i,t3_ejfaae,1578079080.0,"Hon,

It is a lifestyle that requires 100% commitment to the horse, you will never come first.  When you met her she was already into horses, it's a package deal.   Yes, it is expensive and it sounds like she is doing exactly what she needs to do to manage that expense.  If you don't get it now, you never will.  It's not about only taking horse lessons twice a month, it's  about the hard work, the shows, the mental therapy, the emotional attachment, the confidence building, the fun, the scent of a horse and a barn, the friends, trail rides, giving your horse a four hour spa treatment on a beautiful sunny day with no one else around, just the sounds of nature and a happy horse letting out a big sigh and licking its lips.  It's about getting up a 3 am for an emergency colic, it's about feeling proud when you and your horse learn a new movement, it's about taking risks and jumping higher than you are comfortable with.  A horse is also a girl's best friend.  She can tell it about her day, about her boyfriend who is unable to accept her passion.... and she can cry into it's soft, warm neck as she tries to figure out how to make the relationship work, or if it can work.

I know this, because I was that girl.  I was always into horses, but I proudly became a first time horse owner when my kids entered high school.    My world changed before me.  I could do whatever I wanted, which I could not do with a lesson or leased horse.  When I met my now ex-fiance, he thought he could accept my ""hobby"" and I was more than excited to share it with him.  He tried to show support by attending events with me, being my groomsman, watching my lessons, etc.  I tried to be aware of his needs and make adjustments to spend more time with him.  In the end it boiled down to him being jealous of my horse.  He felt he should be enough to make me as happy as I am with my horse.  He came to resent my excitement, my enjoyment.  He hated the cost, a cost that I managed on my own from working full time and doing barn work, in addition to paying the mortgage and taking care of my sons.

The more my ex complained, the more I withdrew from him.  Eventually he gave me an ultimatum.  If we married I could no longer have my horse and my dog.  Guess who won?  I've encountered several men who wouldn't date me because I'm horse crazy.  I accept that, I wouldn't want them in my life as well.  It's no different dating anyone with a passionate hobby.  Either you accept it or you don't.   If you don't, then move on."

datingoverfifty,fct7jnp,t3_eha1wo,1577934951.0,"Go for it, there is absolutely no reason to not.  I'm 58 and dating three gentlemen in their 40's.  They have told me they prefer older women because we know what we like, what we want , are pretty much self sufficient, have far less drama, are more grounded and realistic compared to women in their own age group.  It took a while to get used to dating them (one is 40), but they treat me like gold and have earned my respect.  Now, when I try to date near my own age, the difference is very noticeable both physically and, sorry to say, mentally."

As for the feelings, it's a given you will develop feelings over a period of time.  It's also a given that were you to become an actual couple and meet the families, no one will be happy on either side.  Do you think you can handle the backlash?  If not, end it."

relationship_advice,fc0n8yg,t1_fc0mad8,1577295080.0,"I just wanted to tell you it does end well at times.  He really had no option but to stay friendly with her because she had become a part of his close circle of friends.  Was it tough for him?  Sure, but he managed and was able to deal with it.  He was able to to put aside his feelings enough that it didn't affect his interaction with her.

As for a rebound, I agree, waiting is risky.  Only you can decide if you are willing to wait it out, as well as manage your feelings towards her.

In all honesty I didn't think he would succeed in the end.  My advice to him was for the sole purpose of protecting his heart.  I didn't want to see him hurt, but yet it is a part of life.  Listen to all of the advice offered here (good and bad) and go with your gut feeling.  Only you can decide what is best for you.

Good luck!

Edited to add:  Rebounds are a natural reaction, it's a part of the dating game.  In fact, I have implemented a rule for myself to not date anyone who has been divorced less than two years."
relationship_advice,fc0lktx,t3_efiayp,1577293846.0,"My youngest son (31) pretty much went through the exact same thing a couple of years ago.  I'm pretty sure it was love at first sight.  Since she and her boyfriend became a part of my son's group of friends, he saw her often.  He decided to wait it out and see what happens.  Sure enough a year later they broke up.  He asked around for advice, including from me, as to whether or not he should make his move.  My suggestion was to wait because he would most likely be a rebound.  I also told him to not best friend her. He waited and not surprisingly she started dating another guy.  My son was heartbroken.  I told him to wait again because this was the rebound and it wouldn't last very long.  Sure enough after a few months the relationship ended, my son made his move and asked her out.  This past September they were married and I finally have a daughter I have always wished for."
