> 6. Conclusion
Evidences searched from Indian ‘Puranas’(scriptures) are of immense importance not only in case of religious knowledge but also 
in various branches of science. These concepts concerning the truth of nature of sages as per brilliance are sacred truths, hidden in 
allegories. Enlightened souls of sages of yore could concentrate, contemplate and enjoy the unknown mysteries of the 
Universe. Hypothesises of these sages at different ages may differ but the fundamental truth remains the same. Those basic truths 
enlighten the interested minds of modern scientists. This discloses, more often than not, is a mere accident. Although some 
misconceptions stated by the sages to be excluded. The modern geographical views may not be appreciated without accepting the 
concepts and ideas of the sages which are scientifically admirable. Furthermore among all these ‘Puranas’ there are little bit 
concerning broadly about the Human Geography, especially in the field of man-nature interaction, which have to be studied by 
future social scientists."

French,ff24oew,t3_er7161,1579493715.0,"Your confusion mainly springs from the fact that there really isn't a word that corresponds to ""it"" in French. Since all nouns are considered either masculine or feminine, you're literally referring to them as ""he"" or ""she"" regardless of whether you're talking about doctors and nurses or books and chairs. 

In this system *le/la* before the verb literally correspond to English **him/her**.

*Ce* and *ça* both correspond to **that/this**, but *ce* and its alternate forms are adjectives and *ça* is a pronoun, so you'll hear/see phrases like *As-tu vu ce livre/cet homme/cette femme?* (** Have you seen that book/man/woman**) but *As-tu vu ça?* (**Have you seen it/that** [either translation works here]).

There's a big exception to that rule, though. When used with the verb *être* (**to be**), you always use *ce* as the subject pronoun of the verb. In this situation, *ce* never changes to match the gender/number of the thing it's referring to, so you'll see/hear *c'est/ce sont/c'était/ce sera* for **that is/those are/that was/that will be**.

If you think about the way you speak in English, you'll note that it usually doesn't make a big difference whether you say **that is...** or **it is...** in a given sentence. This is true in French as well."

Cooking,feq3l44,t3_eqda7w,1579337168.0,"Onion powder: Onion and eggs it a classic combo. I'd prefer sauteeing some fresh onion before adding the eggs, personally, but using powder will be quicker and you won't have onion chunks. Probably better to us in a scramble; the flavour needs to permeate into the dish. Sprinkle over fried eggs, for example won't be a very good result. I'd use somewhere in the range of 1/4-1/2 teaspoon per 2 eggs depending on how much you like onion.

Ground mustard: Mustard and eggs certainly go together; it's often added to homemade mayonnaise. Dry ground mustard is *super* strong, hot and pungent. A tiny pinch goes a long way. Again, you want this mixed into you eggs as you're cooking. Not something you want to be sprinkling over your cooked meal.

Turmeric: Hard to describe the flavour. Warm, earthy, a slight hint of bitterness. Certainly not a traditional egg seasoning, but I've done it and liked it. You'll have to experiment to see if it fits your taste. Not as strong s most spices. Use in a similar proportion to that for onion powder (or perhaps even a little heavier). It will turn your eggs bright yellow. It will turn you fingers and clothes bright yellow. Be careful to avoid staining. Again, you want this mixed into you're eggs as they cook. It's not a topping. As a side note: combine turmeric, a bit of your mustard and some vinegar and you've pretty much got the flavour of prepared yellow mustard (like French's).

Oregano: You've probably tasted this in pizza/pasta sauces before. It tastes like it smells. Nice with eggs, especially paired with a bit of shredded cheese. This one you can toss over the dish after cooking. In fact it's probably better that way, since cooking it with reduce the flavour. Also pairs beautifully with tomato.

This situation is a bit tricky because in addition to the elected chiefs and councils of the 5 Wet'suwet'en bands (imposed by the federal Indian Act), who have official authority over administration of the communities' *reserves*, there are also hereditary chiefs I the traditional clans and houses of the Wet'suwet'en. In addition to having authority over cultural/ceremonial masters, the hereditary chiefs have often served as a sort of united representative voice for the various Wet'suwet'en bands as a whole. Famously, it was the hereditary chiefs (along with those of the neighboring Gitxsan nation, that launched the legal case *Delgamuukw vs. British Columbia*; possibly the single most important legal decision regarding aboriginal title to unceded lands in Canada.
