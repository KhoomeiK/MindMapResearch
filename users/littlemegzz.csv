personalfinance,fes7ujv,t1_fer3x8o,1579362286.0,"You arent a moron man. I dont think I've ever gotten a receipt for a deposit, or if I have, kept it. You cant foresee a mistake that has never happened before, especially with a large bank (with mostly reliable technology) Obviously with an event like this you will want to take additional steps to prevent it from happening again. There are cameras and every single dollar must be accounted for in atms like that (prior teller) The bank will fix it and most likely apologize profusely."
