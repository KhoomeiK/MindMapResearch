If the friend literally had no other place he could possibly spend the night, then I might say he was desperate and not necessarily a buttface. Your roommate is *beyond* presumptuous.

Check your lease contract to see if overnight guests are prohibited. If they are, tell your roommate that. If not, don't mention it. But tell him YOU do not allow it. You each have the right of prior refusal. That means prior notice is required, of course.

>Boyfriend agrees with me, but said I should of just let it go and not bring it up unless he tries to do the same thing again.

No! Bad boyfriend! Bad! You need to bring it up (and you did, yay!) to make sure it never happens again. One does not just let things like this go. That is a terrible idea.

>I told roommate how I feel and he responded by saying I’m over dramatic and that his friend had nowhere to go.

Please try to not **punch your roommate in the face** for that ""over dramatic"" bullshit. Isn't this something men do **a lot** to minimize or dismiss women's needs and concerns? Just to get their way? **NO!**

>He also said he knows his friend is a good person so I’m wrong for feeling uncomfortable.

""[H]e knows his friend is a good person....""
How nice. YOU DON'T. Have you ever read about, or watched TV shows about, serial murderers? Or even one-time murderers? How many times has a person said, ""He has such a nice, charming, kind ,helpful man. Pillar of the community. Church-going family mam!"" Same goes for burglars, robbers, rapists, and on and on. ""He just seemed so normal!"" ""Everybody liked him!"" Knows he's a good person. Ha! Kiss my butt. And if he actually said you're wrong for having the feelings you do? Kiss my *entire* ass.
