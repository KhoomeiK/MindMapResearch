phenibut,fc5nspv,t3_egchiv,1577462268.0,"It should give you some degree of relief, altough for me its more when reflecting on it the day after. You realise you were a bit more social than usual, had a bit more fun than before and so on.

BUT! The way you are thinking of taking it sounds risky to me. See it more as training wheels. Something to give you relief when confronting your fears and stepping out of you comfort zone. You can use it 2 times a week as training wheels, not as a crutch. As a crutch you should not use it at all. I'm not in your position so I obviously don't know the situation as good as you do, but from what I can tell using that frequently for that purpose should be avoided. A better approach would be to use it the first 2 occasions and then tapering down and staying low. At certain points after that you can still do it but don't make it a habit. The relief is nothing compared to the downsides of withdrawal symptoms.

In the end it is your choice but.. okay I have an idea. Do one day with and one day without. You get some relief and a more constructive way. Use the day with to motivate you, to train you to be more comfortable in your surroundings. But I would strongly advice against using both days.
