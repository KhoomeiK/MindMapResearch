He's no fighter. They look better with ears anyway. There is no legitimate reason to crop dogs ears anymore.

In fact... In Paul's first season, Paul started out very badly when he decided to ally early with Jozea. How did he react? Did he get all isolated and delusional like Jozea did (""Look, we own the f\_\_king house"")? No... he distanced himself from Jozea (and Victor) and worked his way into a power position, slowly week by week. He made new social connections and made a run to the final. Just sayin."
