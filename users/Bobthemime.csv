You are using reddit.  I have been in a lot of support groups and the bar for high functioning varies.. but the general consensus is that if you can swim trough the daily life of someone on the internet.. with all the things that can be upsetting.. you are high functioning.  You don't need help to live your life, in your comfort zone.. which i'd argue the place you have your computer would count.

Sorry if I am a bit harsh on you.. I know far too many aspies that use it as an excuse to get out of things, that I guess it is my natural preset to see a new aspie.. as an asshole."
