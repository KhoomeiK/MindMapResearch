TeamfightTactics,fdql8e4,t1_fdpydcb,1578669353.0,"Um no, you transition normally by 4-1, wherein at stage 3-5 onwards you start building up the comp you are aiming for in the end-game. One good example for this is when you have for example a decent winstreak (5) with 50gold at 70 HP  at Level 6 by stage 3-6 (wolves) with a [Woodland Druid Mage Ocean 2 comp](https://lolchess.gg/builder/set2?deck=52e4243033bb11ea82c97792cd35d333), assuming you have already have your key units (brand upgrade, Naut, Thresh, Nami, etc.) you can let go of the Woodlands bit by bit, (eg. removing Ivern and maokai to get [ocean 4](https://lolchess.gg/builder/set2?deck=a8e1bec033bb11eab80873df07ddea75)) then test the waters of the comp, if its strong as it is, econ again level to 8 by 4-1 up to 4-3. If you're lacking upgrades, better lowroll for key units (unless someone else is donkeyrolling for lets say, brand, then level to 8 EARLIER, then roll for brand.)

[This](https://lolchess.gg/builder/set2?deck=5648e56033bd11ea917aeb442c032154) should be your comp by level 8. And just go 9 to add either Summoner/inferno (Zyra) or Ocean Lux or a Mystic.

Theres more to how you should build up to this comp (and obviously some units arent mentioned here and without consideration of spat items, I just placed it there to give the idea of transitioning better)
