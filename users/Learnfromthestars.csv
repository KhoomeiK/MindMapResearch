iwatchedanoldmovie,ff6cbhm,t3_ermcgo,1579624083.0,"This movie holds up so well, in part because it’s so dark. An alcoholic beats a little kid until his ear bleeds! That scene haunts me. And Jimmy Stewart is so torn up for the whole movie, attempts suicide, feels tied down by his family, and ultimately realizes his life kinda does suck, but it’s still worth living, even if he goes to prison!"

CICO,fdf2rz0,t3_el0v5a,1578351995.0,"Also, by the way, try starting with smaller changes. 1200 calories is great if you’re under 140lbs, short, a woman, and extremely sedentary. For most of the rest of us, it is not enough to avoid feeling hungry most of the day. Why not start with 1500-1800 calories and see how you do with that?"
CICO,fdf2iln,t3_el0v5a,1578351826.0,"Hey, the reason you’re doing this is because you ARE WORTH DOING IT FOR. Your future is worth being healthy for, your soul is worth tending, your heart is worth love. You deserve to treat yourself well, and feed your body well, no matter what size you are. You will have far greater success if you don’t sabotage yourself by thinking you’re trash, so treating yourself like trash, by eating trash. You deserve it today."
StrongCurves,fdcjbix,t3_ekktii,1578276313.0,"How much are you eating overall and how much protein in particular? If you are eating at maintenance or less than your needs, it’s almost impossible to build muscle no matter what exercise you do. To get a juicy butt, you need shapely muscle with a little fat on top. At the very least, eat 100g of protein a day and, let’s say, 100 extra calories (like one extra snack a day). You won’t get fat overnight doing that. Try it for a couple months and see if your butt improves. Give it at least two months, preferably more unless you’re willing to eat an extra 300 calories a day. Do not exercise more to make up for the extra calories. The point is to gain weight, in your butt."

Volumeeating,fd71z9c,t3_ejyimy,1578198450.0,"Pasteurized egg whites last forever in the fridge if you check the expiration dates. Rolled oats, frozen sliced strawberries, bottled lemon juice, and Walden Farms syrup are all great. Oh, is that a recipe you sense coming?

Strawberry Oat Bake

100g egg whites

Generous glug of lemon juice

80g rolled oats

115g almond flour

250ml milk

Teaspoon baking powder

200g frozen sliced strawberries, thawed

Preheat oven to 350

Mix everything but the strawberries in a bowl. Spray a baking dish with nonstick spray and spread the strawberries along the bottom. Dump the batter on top. Bake until it’s pretty brown, about 40 minutes. Serve hot or cold with Walden Farms syrup or other sugar free maple syrup. If you don’t have sugar free syrup, try Splenda squirts or some other sweetener in the batter to taste. 

Makes 4 huge servings, about 300 calories a piece (using Fairlife whole filtered milk, which is lower carb)."

compsci,fcswrnl,t3_eiq9bt,1577927075.0,"The math is important and you will get very little out of the book if you don’t understand it. It’s like a cookbook. Basically, you’ll be able to follow a recipe, but you won’t be able to figure out what to do if something starts to burn. The math is the part you need to understand so you can figure out what to apply where and why. I wish so much that I had taken more time to study math. Study more math however you can! I’ve found Coursera to be great, but it takes discipline to stick with it."

I’ve been lifting for years, I don’t think anybody would think I’m noticeably jacked or anything, but I have enough muscle that I can eat more than expected pretty often and I don’t gain weight. Only explanation is the additional muscle has turned me into a teenaged boy. ;) Relax, do better tomorrow, keep lifting!"
loseit,fcp5yk6,t3_eibojp,1577851556.0,I was planning on doing it anyway! What would “with you” mean? I’ve done it with my mom once and would text her each day to say “no sugar”. I also wrote it down in my calendar. I’ve eaten so much junk the last few weeks that I’m sick of it and ready for a change!
