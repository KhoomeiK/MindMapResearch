I dont know if you should reach out.  Honestly?  I'd be terrified to hear from you.  You've probably kept him up nights, anxious that you would have said something to some one because he no longer speaks to or sees you.  He's probably relieved several times a year at least when he goes to a family gathering and you aren't there.  

I wouldn't ever want to hear from you again. I dont think you will ever have a relationship with this person, especially if he has a girlfriend, wife, and or kids.  Having something to lose makes time bombs atomic.

Your shame isnt his responsibility, seek help but if you're  going to contact him for the love of christ dont do it in person or call him,  the only thing you should even consider is sending the letter.  

If this is how you treat people you love I would be afraid to see how you treat people you dont like.  The psychology behind this is seriously fucked up and dark, and I'm getting a vibe from this that makes me think you might have a personality disorder.  Seek professional help immediately."

One of his co workers went in to take a look at it and lost consciousness because of some kind of gas buildup and he went in to save the guy.

He was climbing back up the tank with the guy on his shoulder and I guess was either overcome with the same gas or got tired from carrying him up a ladder but they both fell back in the tank.

Turns out he was the son of a prostitute, fathered by one of his mother's customers.  They lived in one room and he grew up with a dirty cigarette burned sheet in between him and his mom making her money.  He was also baptized into the ku klux klan.  You can imagine what kind of person that creates.  He was a coal mining alcoholic and a bastard to everyone in town. 

He beat my mom, her sister, and brother.  Used to hold loaded guns to their heads and tell them that if the bullet wouldn't cost him a nickel he would shoot them. He raped my mom and my female cousin, and he used to hit my two male cousins because he hated my uncle the most and they were his kids, so they stopped communicating with him.
