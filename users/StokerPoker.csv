ChoosingBeggars,fef740q,t1_feeapza,1579049745.0,If you knew anything about financials (which it sounds like you don’t) you would know that it is completely situational whether renting or buying is better both short and long term. If he’s making that much money and living at home and paying $500 in rent for everything in that ad (which I’m assuming he is) then his parents ARE trying to teach him about financials by showing him that he should be more grateful for what he gets for that minimal amount of money as it does not exist in the real world.

HeadphoneAdvice,fcvaph5,t1_fcv9raq,1577998159.0,Honestly what I would do is if you can wait sit another month and see what the wh1000xm3s drop to. I’m assuming they’ll go on sale a bit more as Sony filed their patent for the xm4.

While both are fantastic headphones (great sound/noise cancelling) I’ve tried both in the gym and haven’t really been a fan. I find them hot and bulky, but that’s just me.

ChoosingBeggars,fbw27p0,t1_fbvxxom,1577139528.0,I think there have been a few attempts up here but the shit that the service industry gets away with is ridiculous. It’s largely unenforced and so many people are afraid of losing their jobs that they just put up with it. I have worked a few nights at certain Calgary Stampede tents where if you don’t receive enough in tips you actually pay out of pocket because of the tipout. One night myself and our bar collectively paid out $600. It’s fucked.
