UnresolvedMysteries,ff4l6bm,t1_fen5fg6,1579566283.0,"It’s been a long time since I watched part one but the one part that stuck with me was when they both testified in court that they “saw each other drive by going hunting”. Just their demeanor and everything was so sketchy, I got bad vibes. I haven’t seen part two, so maybe new evidence came up that points somewhere else. Just a gut feeling that they knew more than they spoke of. Then again, I only saw the one part of the Netflix series and didn’t dig much further. Nothing substantial lol"
UnresolvedMysteries,fem3ivs,t3_eposcn,1579238552.0,"My theory on Making A Murderer (Steven Avery & Brendan Dassey).. I think Brendan’s step-father and brother murdered Teresa Halbach.

And Kyron Horman - stepmom for sure!

JonBenet - Burke killed her and mom covered it up. Dad played dumb and, while not involved, knows who is guilty."

You deserve better, you deserve love, you deserve support and people in your life that love you for who you are. I can tell that you’re a beautiful soul, I hope you find happiness and go on to write many more stories."

amiugly,f9yii8s,t3_e79k11,1575729125.0,"Honestly, I don’t think height is the problem! I would NEVER approach a guy first because I’m way too self conscious and scared of rejection. I think a lot of girls wait for guys to make the first move. Give it a shot! The worst that could happen is you get denied and move on to the next!"
