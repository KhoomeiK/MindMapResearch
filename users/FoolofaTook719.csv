Christian,ffa04sc,t1_ff9np3d,1579725193.0,"It's not so much attention on how I look (since makeup is just an artistic outlet for me and I mostly throw on whatever), and more of, am I wrong for what I wear? But I understand what you mean."
Christian,ff9f52u,t1_ff9dj8m,1579711683.0,Sounds epic! Thanks! :)
Christian,ff8jep9,t1_ff8je0n,1579681257.0,Ok! :)
Christian,ff8jbzu,t1_ff8j7x2,1579681150.0,"That's usually what I do. I add brighter colors all the time. Usually nothing too gaudy, but something beautiful that compliments the rest of my outfit. Thanks for the suggestions. :)"
Christian,ff8h9zl,t1_ff8h5v9,1579678437.0,"Ok, thanks! :)"
Christian,ff8fb8r,t1_ff8f5y3,1579676007.0,"Ok, thank you! I'm actually glad someone finally gets it. I like what you said, ""black clothes do not a dark soul maketh."" A very elegant feel to it, but speaks the truth. :)"
Christian,ff8d8i5,t3_es6fox,1579673674.0,"I believe in them. There's evidence of them existing and that's enough for me. I don't know when they existed. A theory of mine is that maybe they existed with Adam and Eve, but after they ate the fruit, maybe God killed them off so that they wouldn't kill Adam, Eve, and their descendants. Because it would probably be very hard if not impossible to defend oneself against a dinosaur. Aside from that, I don't really know. I think the Bible mentions dragons a few times. Maybe the dinosaurs are the dragons? Idk."
NoStupidQuestions,ff8c2fd,t3_es4khz,1579672457.0,"I usually nickname the characters. Simple names like Sam or Jessie. That way, if I do forget the names, I have nicknames to refer to them as."
SuicideWatch,ff7rmzz,t3_es07op,1579656690.0,"I get that, too. Mostly from morbid curiosity. Been fascinated with death since I can remember. Although those thoughts can be a bit disturbing and maybe even distressing sometimes."
SuicideWatch,fezl1af,t1_fexk304,1579458459.0,You're welcome. Happy I could help. :)
SuicideWatch,fewxpsz,t1_fewxgy9,1579421101.0,You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Feel free to talk to me any time you need to. I'm a good listener and don't speak unless I need to. :) Have a good day.
SuicideWatch,fewxdwo,t1_fewwy0s,1579420948.0,"Oh. In that case, I suggest that you at least try to distract yourself. Maybe take care of yourself (shower, breakfast, or just something small) or talk to someone you know. I really hope I'm helping."
SuicideWatch,fewwtwz,t1_fewwmqv,1579420718.0,"I'm sorry. But don't harm yourself, whatever you do. Maybe get some sleep. What time zone are you in? It's almost midnight over where I am."
SuicideWatch,fewwfx3,t3_eqtdg5,1579420543.0,Are you alright? If you don't mind me asking.
SuicideWatch,feww1pv,t3_eqp6ad,1579420376.0,"Yeh. I just can't see myself severing old ties really because of family and friends and stuff. Might screw off to another country one day, dunno. Might travel the world. Don't really like the idea of staying in one place. It seems better than suicide."
SuicideWatch,fewvgpv,t1_fewv87s,1579420118.0,Oh. Ok! That's very interesting. :)
SuicideWatch,fewuynm,t1_fewuir9,1579419892.0,"Oh. That sounds interesting, though quite concerning. :/ What is that like? Does it hurt? Sorry if I'm asking too many questions, I'm a very curious person."
SuicideWatch,fewudvx,t1_fewu1ig,1579419634.0,Did you hurt it? I've never heard of this happening before.
SuicideWatch,fewu1uy,t3_eqpu19,1579419491.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way. I do sometimes, too. I'm sure there will be someone that will love you someday. Hang in there. :)"
SuicideWatch,fewtchm,t3_eqs0ug,1579419191.0,"I'm pretty sure it is painful. If I may ask, what's going on with your neck???"
SuicideWatch,fewsdvn,t3_eqsqqc,1579418774.0,"Hey, how's it going? Anything you want to talk about? It'd be lovely to hear from you."
SuicideWatch,fewriqn,t3_eqr1qw,1579418418.0,Is everything alright? Wanna talk?
misophonia,fepkais,t1_fepjd0n,1579322708.0,"Alright, thanks! :)"
SuicideWatch,fem2yyb,t3_epmh3y,1579238032.0,"Yeah, and I feel like it would destroy them. One of the only things keeping me here, but it's something."
StopSelfHarm,fefd7gr,t1_fefbbui,1579053794.0,No problem! :)
StopSelfHarm,feejc10,t3_eomd8c,1579034916.0,Good job! I wish you good luck and much success!
gaming,fe0e1h9,t3_enf1qa,1578811443.0,I'm both terrified and fascinated. It's amazing.
lotr,fdp1vkd,t3_em5k5g,1578618018.0,You just said something...Treeish.
AskReddit,fdfq8vz,t3_el2az5,1578367600.0,Haven't watched any TV shows. But I did watch Lord Of The Rings. So I guess Frodo. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
AskMeddit,fddynma,t1_fddxdwu,1578327161.0,"Ok, I sort of knew that. But I'm guessing that's a no."
SuicideWatch,fdd328t,t3_ekpb5j,1578292774.0,"I feel that way at moments, too. Self harm really isn't good for you, even though it may feel like it in the moment. Please try to keep from hurting yourself as much as you can. r/StopSelfHarm is helpful."
gaming,fdd2v7f,t3_eknpgr,1578292557.0,"Oh, I thought it said ""scp"" energy."
SuicideWatch,fdcwlea,t3_eko216,1578286429.0,"No, I like the idea. I feel like it might actually help. I love a good story, more so when its purpose is to help people. :) Just a piece of advice, as long as you don't make the suicide's description too grotesque, it should be fine."
SuicideWatch,fdcw1q7,t3_ekd3q5,1578285959.0,"While I would say, cover it up with makeup or something, I also suggest telling them what happened. You don't have to go into too much detail, and just tell them what you're comfortable with."
SuicideWatch,fdcvtnn,t3_eknqjr,1578285769.0,"Maybe so. I've never heard of such a situation as this, if I'm going to be honest."
SuicideWatch,fdcverw,t3_ekn5mc,1578285423.0,What's going on? Everything alright? I'm here if you need me.
SuicideWatch,fd7xdzn,t3_ek933e,1578211435.0,"I feel the same way sometimes. I'm sorry that you have to go through this, too. But I'm sure that neither your death nor mine will make it any better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm right here."
lotr,fczv1m8,t3_ejkp48,1578109095.0,Hail!
SuicideWatch,fcyrpni,t3_ejkeuf,1578085667.0,"I don't really think so. I can't just ""ignore"" it. I tried doing that for 5 years and all that happened was that it got worse. 5 years I wasted thinking that I could handle things myself and that nobody would care anyway. I know it hasn't been long, but I feel much better here knowing that there are other people that go through the same thing. I hate that other people do, but it's amazing to know that I'm not the only one."
SuicideWatch,fcyqquj,t3_ejg4uv,1578085136.0,"I don't like it, either. Yellow is a very irritating colour for me. And it's just too bright for my eyes. I personally like the moon better. More happy and mysterious, while I feel like the sun is annoying and gaudy."
StopSelfHarm,fcxov6h,t1_fcxorok,1578068020.0,Ok. :)
StopSelfHarm,fcwwvuh,t1_fcwwvgt,1578041070.0,Ok! :)
StopSelfHarm,fcwwuvd,t1_fcwwr99,1578041036.0,"Ok, thanks for the advice! :)"
SuicideWatch,fcwvxnd,t3_ejau64,1578039874.0,Congratulations! :)
StopSelfHarm,fcwvhyk,t3_e4x513,1578039340.0,Only my mum ever found out. She was pretty chill. And then she told me not to do it again.
AskReddit,fcp3qo1,t3_ei4bkv,1577849543.0,Last thing I watched was Tom and Jerry.
SuicideWatch,fcorczz,t1_fcorblw,1577839489.0,"Aw, no problem! :)"
SuicideWatch,fcor3rw,t1_fcor15a,1577839300.0,Thank you. Good luck to you as well. :)
SuicideWatch,fcohd9t,t3_ei4k2u,1577832259.0,"My mum probably wouldn't be able to handle it if I was gone, I have a dog, and there's a guy at school I like. It's not much, but it's something."
SuicideWatch,fcodiuc,t1_fco9aey,1577829593.0,"Ok, thank you very much!"
SuicideWatch,fco0hzr,t1_fcnzxuj,1577821880.0,Thank you. I will. I've gotten just a bit too close to actually going through with it.
SuicideWatch,fcmr6i3,t1_fcmr52v,1577788181.0,"Yes, that would be helpful. Thank you."
SuicideWatch,fcmr4ph,t1_fcmr2ca,1577788109.0,Ok. Thank you. :)
SuicideWatch,fcmr2bu,t1_fcmqxzo,1577788013.0,"Oh. Ok, thanks. That makes it a bit less stressful. :)"
SuicideWatch,fcmqpwe,t1_fcmqlb8,1577787516.0,"Literally everyone. I know I need science, of course, but I was told that I needed math as well. That math is important for that. :/ I specifically want to be a pediatric surgeon, but I doubt that changes much."
SuicideWatch,fcmpt58,t1_fcmpo3q,1577786229.0,"Thank you. I actually would really like to be a surgeon when I grow up, and I was told I need math for that, so I'm really stressed. But thank you very much."
lotr,fbvwqmo,t3_eeig1w,1577137198.0,"We likes it, precious! XD"
