AskSF,fe6k5mk,t3_enwu4q,1578893553.0,"In general I find it easier to make friends in SF than other places (easier than LA for sure), but I know my experiences are not shared by everyone.

When I moved to SF I bought a book about how to make friends in SF. It emphasized common interest groups. I did a lot of different things, but had the best luck with making friends through work (not all jobs are good for this), friends of friends, and through a philosophy discussion group at a local college. I went to a lot of different churches and meditation groups as well, but had less success with that. A good place to start is probably Meetup.org."
Foodforthought,fc6izxn,t1_fc682eu,1577481720.0,Fair point
Foodforthought,fc67au4,t1_fc5pq2j,1577473915.0,That's quite a generalization.
Foodforthought,fc679ny,t1_fc5up9r,1577473894.0,I can't understand what you wrote. Maybe you can edit for clarity?
Foodforthought,fc43u39,t1_fc41o87,1577405918.0,Maybe this is a good start: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-000-1017-5
Foodforthought,fc411oo,t1_fc40tdk,1577403820.0,I agree that more quantitative evidence would be nice.
Foodforthought,fc40wxt,t1_fc3x0l2,1577403722.0,"I second what c\_ferox said. I would also recommend:  taking an acting class, watching lots of dramatic films with close ups of facial expressions, spending more time interacting with others in intimate small group settings, and possibly mdma."
Foodforthought,fc3ti48,t1_fc3teqo,1577398227.0,In my experience the acceptability of close friendships between friends has depended a lot on geography.
AskLosAngeles,fbkzpkt,t3_edrrc7,1576956899.0,"There's a new form of TMS you may want to try. It's accelerated theta burst stimulation (aTBS). There are psychiatrists in the Bay Area that offer it, but I don't know about LA. You can DM me if you want more info."
