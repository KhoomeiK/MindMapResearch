Also you didn’t mention anything you do and really like doing. Find a hobby or something to excel at. You’ve been doing this for a while so change it!"

I lost 46 pounds in 4 months but didn’t have any problems with loose skin tough."

With moderation of course! Just things like cooking, workout and that kind of stuff.

Every time you don’t come up with an answer go look for one. If you don’t know what you’re passionate about go look for something. Try a new hobby, sport or whatever!

Don’t know what your favourite food is? Go try making something you think you might like. Maybe you’ll get passionate about cooking and the dish you’re making at the same time!

Trial and error, you’ll find out!"

You can’t ask us how you can become the best version of yourself because we don’t know you! You need to decide what the best you is or can be. No faking. Do the things you really like and do them because only you like them! You got this bro, keep your head high and go for it!"

dating_advice,fdjztf2,t1_fdjz0gd,1578492469.0,"You should really start working on yourself my man.
YOU ARE NOT WORSE THAN SCUM!
Go read some books. I just finished “Can’t hurt me” from David Goggins, it’s really cool and you should go and start reading it right now.

It’s the mother of all cliche but you can’t love someone if you don’t love yourself.
I still think you should go and ask her but that’s up to you. If you really don’t want to then please listen and work on yourself. Be the best version you can ever be. Be the person you think she could be interested in! And no faking, don’t pretend to be someone just so she might fall for you but just be that person! First do you.

You’re a human being and you deserve love. You’re not scum but you are beautiful in your own way! It’s hard to see and I don’t alway see it either but it’s true. Tell yourself everyday that you are a person who deserves the best and you will start believing it! Come on dude, take this advice from this internet stranger and go do something.

PM me when you need help."
dating_advice,fdjy29i,t1_fdjxlbc,1578491079.0,"The point is that you are worth it. Even if you think you are not!

Let me put it like this: you have a crush on this girl and want to ask her out. You probably think about her all the time. You think you’re not worth it or that you will be rejected. You think she might think you’re a creep if you do ask her. 

All this time thinking about this one girl you’re not going to ask out? What’s the point in that?

Are you going to hide away and hope your feelings for her will disappear somehow? What’s your plan? What’s the point?

You can do this mate. Think of yourself als the baddest and toughest in town and try! You can make up a million reasons to not do it, I know that. Find that one reason why you should and do it!"

dating_advice,fdjwm4k,t3_elqjxh,1578489855.0,"Dude what are you really asking here? You’re telling us what you want to hear!

Listen what other people are saying and just try and ask her to do something with you. Don’t use the word date. Don’t do something romantic. Just go hang with her and some other people you both know. Then go talk to her and ask her some questions about what she does and that kind of stuff. Just get to know her a little better.

If you feel confident enough ask her on a date when you leave. If not try and ask her later.

It’s the most scary thing to do, I know! I also think I will be rejected every time and most of the time you will be. You only need one to say yes and go from there!

I’ve just been trough something with this girl I really liked and I asked her and she said yes and we were together for about 2 months but it didn’t work out in the end. It hurts like hell! But those 2 months were 2 of the most beautiful months I had.

Go for it dude, please don’t wait to long and talk yourself down! You are worth it and you can do it. I’ll be rooting for ya!"

love,fdgskhb,t3_elc36t,1578407238.0,"You’re 20, as long as you don’t plan to die soon you’ll be fine.

All cliche but you will find someone, I was where you are right now 10 years ago and found someone to love and who loved me back. And although it’s over way too soon I know everything will be ok.

I’m working on myself right now. You should too! Find out what you like to do and go for it, you should be broadening your worldview and do things for the future you!

All will be fine, I’m sure of it! There is someone who’s going to love you but if you keep focused on finding that person you will miss out on many opportunities you just don’t see.

First do you, the rest will come!"
