casualnintendo,feqj9hm,t1_feqfx88,1579342545.0,"They dropped the initial lawsuit. And they failed in their second attempt. I’d wager they failed because Nintendo’s legal team is insanely proficient and their resources far exceed a small company from Simi Valley. Just because they failed to sue Nintendo doesn’t mean Nintendo will fail to sue Alienware. Also if you look at the products, visually there’s not a lot of similarity, it’s a tablet that slides into a single piece joystick unit, not two independently connecting joysticks. It was marketed as a gaming tablet, not a solely a game system. Finally, this Alienware unit is directly referencing the fact they ripped the idea off Nintendo."

If he doesn’t have/is limited with tricks, training new skills is a huge way to garner trust. As other people have commented, they’re mostly 1-2 person dogs. However, if they understand someone is there to help/look after them they will add them to their pack. My fiancé’s sister is one of my heeler’s favorite people because she let him out for lunch pees for a year. They take time, patience and a lot of attention. Someone mentioned making sure he knows he’s got your attention. This is key. Sometimes my little dude doesn’t want to fetch, he wants to walk around holding a toy while I hold it. I’ve never interacted with a more intuitive and attention needy breed than heelers. I guess to summarize, lots of treats and training, tons of outdoor time, and attention to form a bond."

Awwducational,fcl7swg,t1_fcl4cb2,1577741668.0,"Not really. Dog breeding history is kind of funny. Early on dogs were selected for there jobs based on behavioral disposition rather than being bred specifically for a job. You could have a litter, and some of the puppies chase balls and animals more while some explore and sniff more. They would then foster the behaviors into working conditions that suited the behavior best. Your dog liked to go fetch things for you?Congratulation you have a hunting dog. Your dog likes to circle animals and control movement and energy? Congratulations you have a herding dog. Obviously after a while they started getting bred into specific lineages but there’s a lot of overlap going on with breeds. 


Also most dog breeds haven’t been genetically mapped. Some of the popular ones (think labs and goldens) have but a lot have not. 

Plus most companies selling dog dna tests are just taking your money. It’s anecdotal but I personally know someone who got 2 dna tests done on their one dog, lied to the company and said they were testing two separate breeds and got completely different results back for the same dog."

They were too yippy and not rugged enough, plus the coat traits don’t match and herding styles don’t match. The curr, as he points out does. Couple that with the fact the currs are bob tailed and there’s a genetic lineage of natural bobbed tailed Heeler’s and the evidence is pretty strong that the idea they came from collies is a misconception.
