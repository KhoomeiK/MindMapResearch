Couldn’t find a place to move and it made me think about learned helplessness and all that and I ended up begging to stay!  Yeah so now I have no dignity either.  When playing apps I am very driven but I think that is because it is in a safe place with boundaries and rules that are always in place.  Some really nice people look for a job for a year and have no luck.  It’s not fair.  In video games the playing field is level.  It’s fair.  Idk."

He would come running into my room because he could hear me laughing and wondered why, only to find out I was laughing at something I had read.  As a toddler I would punish him by only reading 2 books at bedtime instead of 3.  He learned to read at the age of five and a half.  He is 22 and is constantly buying books and trading books with friends.  He DOES have a girlfriend and an active social life.  But, as they used to say, “Reading is fundamental”."

TrueChristian,fdft4fy,t1_fdfifc5,1578369543.0,Who advised you not to work during your appeal?  I have a client that worked (part time) the entire time they were waiting to hear back from the application.  I asked a representative from Social Security and wats advised that my client could work.  It did not change anything.  I believe that’s a misconception.  You are in my prayers.
TrueChristian,fdfgiaq,t3_el06lw,1578361158.0,"I am a devout, born again Christian.  Praise God for the blood of Jesus Christ that makes us family.  I have worked with many people trying to get S.S.I.  I just want you to consider some things.     You have been turned down multiple times but did you appeal each rejection and ultimately come before a disability court judge?  That’s the way to do it.  It really is a numbers game.  When you are rejected it’s hard not to take it personally.  If 100 people apply today and only 30 are accepted out of the remaining 70 maybe 15 will appeal.  This saves the Social Security Administration money.  Don’t take it personal.    I suggest you see a disability lawyer.  What will happen is they take your case and you pay no money up front.  By the time you are successful you will have accrued back pay from $2000-$5000.  The lawyer will ask for 20% which Social Security Administration will pay them out of your back pay.  I have seen people who are terminally ill turned down.  It really is like a game of chess.  You  also need one person as a support to talk to and encourage you through this process.  I worked for a wonderful Christian woman at a non profit mental health center and I really worked closely with them and think you have a case.  I saw many people through this process.  The thing is, when we are walking a hard road it’s important to have a friend/cheerleader in our corner.  Let me know if you need more help.  God bless you."

I didn’t just become a Christian and decide to agree wholeheartedly with everything I’m “suppose to” believe in.  Secondly, I know a host of Christians that have fostered and adopted children of ALL ages.  It is something I long to do myself.  That argument is just pro choice’s latest slogan.  Not very well thought out either.  In the City of Orange, California there are two homes for unwed mothers ran by a catholic charity.  The first home is for women who are keeping their babies.  The second home is for those giving their  babies to adoptive parents.  Maybe Christians are just busy out here doing the work and not blowing their horns."
