FemaleDatingStrategy,ff2rtbm,t3_er7o4i,1579521313.0,"She needs to stay away from him. He destroyed there marriage and made her look stupid. Theres no room for “friendship”. Old feelings could resurface and they could end up fucking.

He’s just not worth it. Also now look at Angie. She used to be the hottest thing now she has all those damn kids and going through gods knows what emotionally. I bet thats why she’s laying low. 
He honestly destroyed both of them. He’s probably not even remorseful. He’s probably just looking to get his ego stroked. Jen is still beautiful. He is hunting and wants that chase again."
