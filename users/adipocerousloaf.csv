my point is: regret can fuck you up EVEN MORE that the loss. it will be hard to let that part go - to not feel so responsible. your entire circle of friends will have to train your minds to not do the ""shoulda coulda woulda"" talks. it is fucking very hard not to go there. do not let the regret stay too long. THAT is the part that haunts if you let it. share stories about her with each other. tell her you love her aloud, with your friends or even by yourself. it feels good to let them know, even if they cannot hear you.

keep you guys heads up. best of luck. it takes a long time if you allow it to, but you are in control of the regret part, not the other way around. hugs all around from me to you and your friend circle."
