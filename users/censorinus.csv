Once when I was out in the garden another cat came into the yard and they both went into a flanking maneuver. I got the other cat out of their quickly before something happened. 

I would say certainly get a companion cat, I suggest a girl kitty then spend the first day or two with them both getting to know each other. My guess is after that they will probably bond and be inseparable."
