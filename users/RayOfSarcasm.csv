offmychest,fcaq5ww,t1_fcaot4p,1577574379.0,"Let's take you for example if your username has any truth to it. 

It's your thoughts that's tell you you're attracted to women, and that (presumably) you identify as female and that's how you live your life. 

Despite many people (let's use a religious sect as an example) being anti lbgt and saying that your sexual preference is a choice and that you can control it and that it's part of an agenda because they don't understand it. And because they don't understand it, they fear it and see it as spreading misinformation. Yet you know it as your truth despite what those who don't walk in your shoes say. 

You and your views on nonbinary are no different to a radical religious view on lgbt. It is their (nonbinary peoples) truth. Not yours. Which brings us nicely back to concluding this with ""you don't need to understand or like it, just do the decent human thing and respect it, and don't be a dick"".
