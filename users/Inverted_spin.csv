Funny you can claim someone found the HR permit ridiculous but you still can't link to the green tape in it or even the comment that you are referring to. 

It's OK bud. I actually did have a look at the permit for you because you clearly haven't. 

There's 12 questions. Things required include:

-Personal details

-Location of hazard reduction works (Lot/DP, even a sketch is fine)

-Assets that are intended to be protected

-What method of hazard reduction is being used

-Proposed date

-Time since last treatment (if known)

-Type of last treatment (if know)

-Has consent been refused in last 3 years?

-Are there any known threatened species? (RFS cross check the appropriate databases when application is submitted)

-Any known Aboriginal sites in the area?

-Is the work on land subject to NPWS Act 1974, Conservation Act 1997, Trust Act 2001, Conservation Act 1995 or Vegation Act 2003.

-Does it require work on neighbouring land?

Now what exactly in that list do you consider to be 'green tape' that hinders HRB? I mean, that whole application would take maybe an hour (if you're going extremely slow).

I thought given you've made the claim on every single bushfire thread, you'd have come up with at least just one instance of 'green tape'. I mean, it's been a couple of months now and I've not had a single link to green tape.  

You sure know how to make a claim without backing it up. Just like the lock on devices. Still haven't found a butane cannister have you mate? A link to a police report will suffice? A court case? Anything. I've always stated they will suffice.

And the current fires still would have happened, a lot of CFA resources and $$ would be wasted on some grassy paddocks (at this stage of the drought, most of them are probably dust tbh). 

Every hectare of low/no risk land burned is an area of high risk land that isn't.

Better burn that grassy reserve down the end of the suburban street! It's got no trees or bushland and poses no fire risk at all but it's crown land so it's gotta be included in the 5%... 

When you look at the 3.9 million hectares of Parks and Conservation land (not state forest which accounts for 3.1 million), you'll see that a great proportion (at a conservative estimate, around 25%) is cleared land. Looking also at the 796,000 hectares of 'Other Crown L and' it is almost exclusive cleared land with a little bit of marine reserves. I assume you'd want that 2 million or so hectares cleared for no actual benefit too? Might find it hard to burn marine reserve I admit but hey, it's part of the 5%!

As for East Central:

>East Central has several major towns that adjoin land that is not treatable by planned burning
 
>Fuel management activities are projected to stabilise residual risk at around 79-80%

So even with planned burning, the risk there is never going to get to the targeted <70%.

*""So if we are doing more burning in at-risk areas, that may well be more effective than having large-scale burns.""*

As you can see above, having a 5% blanket target is useless and wasteful because it doesn't factor in the differences in fuel loads across different land types. The *Safer Together* program targets high risk areas (forest and bushland as opposed to grassland or low risk areas). As such, the residual risk was 67% (with a target of <70%).

>In the current season, just 2,100 hectares have been burned off so far and 5,200 hectares have been given mechanical treatments.

Which may have been true almost a year ago (when that article was published).

However as per the 2019 Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning annual report, the total area treated with hazard reduction burn was 130,000 hectares as at June 2019. Which makes sense that much of the burning was completed in the months after February when the weather was more conducive to burning. 

With no significant rain fall in the last half of the year, any additional burns were impossible.

australia,fcryglj,t1_fcrrj2e,1577908362.0,"Except the Greens don't hold the balance of power Federally or in NSW. They don't really have any way to pass or block legislation. 

There's about 50 odd Greens councillors in NSW out of over 1000. 

So how exactly are they stopping hazard reduction burning? Given you're so insistent that they're preventing hazard reduction burning, I assume you can point to policy or legislation that they've implemented that show this?"

What's the point of going through the process of your set up (which, if we are honest, many users would struggle to set up) when the streaming services already know what you're listening to anyway?"
australia,fcp2sl0,t1_fcmwvkm,1577848720.0,"NPWS exceeded their prescribed burn targets last winter.

The problem is that drier conditions result in more combustible fuel and the window for prescribed burning is getting shorter as the conditions aren't conducive to safely burn off."
