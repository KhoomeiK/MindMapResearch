Wishful thinking. Humans can't just ""adapt"" to outer space like our ancestors did to land. There are no marginal steps to take into that environment and there is no guarantee that we will find a technological bridge. We have created a new kind of problem and pointing to our ability to solve old problems is not reassuring. The fact that the planet will survive when we do not is equally useless. /u/mctheebs is right, you're a nihilist who doesn't seem to care if our species survives.

Close, it's a specific property of the alcohol/water mixture. Many (most?) other mixtures can be distilled to absolute purity, including ethanol with other compounds besides water. 

Regarding osmosis, they are both driven by concentration gradients. With osmosis you have movement through a semi-permeable barrier. With alcohol the ""barrier"" is the difference between the solution and the air, so the water is just condensing into solution."
