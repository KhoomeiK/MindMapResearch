When I joined the navy, I went to school to learn how to operate nuclear reactors. I was in goose creek SC where there's a naval training base. Out on the river were two old missile subs that they use to train new operators on. We were standing outside on the smoke pad and one of the girls there announced today was her birthday. She just turned 18. She had been through boot camp. Been through A school. Been through Naval Nuclear Power School, which I can assure you is *not* a fun experience, and there in south carolina, had unrestricted access to *an actual functioning nuclear power plant*. As a 17 year old. 


I think we as a society really need to acknowledge that, morally, there's a whole bunch of fuzziness about where the actual line is based on the individual, and that '18' is nothing more than a general guideline meant for efficient application of law, and shouldn't be taken as some signpost for morality."

Can we please stop saying this? I'm in no way defending 20 year olds doing anything with 12 year olds, but not all rape is equivalent. Its an entire spectrum of crimes just like assault is. 


I got raped once. I was passed out drunk and some fat annoying chick tried to have her way with me. My buddy found her on top of me, kicked her in the cunt, and drug me out of there. Yeah, sure, I was 'raped', but who cares? If that were an assault that would be a bar scuffle where you got punched twice in the gut and now your buddies are holding you apart. If that were a theft that would be like someone making off with your wallet with 20 bucks in it. I was raped in the same way that a guy who never left stateside during a war is a veteran.

If a person dies without a will, the government will distribute the persons estate according to whatever the local customs are, generally all given to some next of kin according to whatever the heirarchy of next of kin is. 

Same thing with the meat sack. It doesn't belong to the family, it doesn't belong to the government, its owned by the estate of the deceased. And if the deceased left no will describing their wishes, then there shouldn't be a problem with the government making some choices about the estate on behalf of the deceased. The corpse has no value to the government. It potentially has sentimental value only to the family, which in the overwhelming majority of cases will still be satisfied by an organ donation being done.

Puberty will cause changes to the body no amount of money can undo once it occurs. You're not helping them, you're sentencing them to a life in the body they don't want.

That's why they're given puberty blockers at a younger age. There's risk with them, but its minimal. These continue until the child either changes their mind, or, far more commonly, shows that this is actually what they want, at which all the HRT stuff kicks in.
