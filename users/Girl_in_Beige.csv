BipolarReddit,ffbuqs2,t3_ess59i,1579783430.0,"I think you’re on the right track, that’s essentially the route I’ve gone with my eleven year old (mom is sick and needs medication to be well). 

I focus more on the things I do to stay stable/feel good (like, mom needs sleep or she’ll lose her mind🤪) than I do on how I’m feeling specifically. He’s also come with me to my psychiatrist appointments (only when I’m doing well, of course) and that seems to have made it easier for him when I haven’t done as well to imagine me going to see a familiar face. 

Bipolar disorder certainly makes parenting more complicated (it makes *everything* more complicated), but it’s totally possible to have a mental illness and be a good parent.

We do better long term when we seek and except help. 

Even though I was having hypomanic episodes by age ten I only saw a psychiatrist once briefly when I was seventeen and then would get antidepressants from my primary care doctors, I was terrified of the hospital and terrified of psych meds due to the stories I’d heard. 

I didn’t actually set foot inside a psych hospital until I was twenty-eight and had been in a mixed episode for at least a month, my now eleven year old was eight weeks old. 

After I was diagnosed I really resented the people who had discouraged me from seeking treatment sooner. I’d spent so many sleepless nights pacing around various apartments in my early twenties and I’d missed out on a lot of experiences because my anxiety kept me trapped inside. 

I am only alive because I sought and then accepted help, please don’t discourage others from doing something that can absolutely change their lives for the better.

How is your relationship with your family, would they be willing to step in and do the legwork to get you to a psychiatrist? 

Bipolar disorder is manageable but I have yet to see anyone do it successfully long term without psych meds, they’ve either end up dead or medicated. Medicated is the *far* better option, imo, if you don’t find meds that work for you right away there are other meds you can try but if you die there’s no fixing it.

I hadn’t had a manic episode until a few years ago (only hypo, mixed, or depressed) and my mom would semi regularly ask if I was *sure* I have bipolar disorder and not “just” depression. I definitely had some doubts about my diagnosis too but since the meds were working as expected it seemed likely that it was correct. 

And then I was prescribed steroids for a sinus infection and had my first (and so far only) manic episode. Yippee. 😒

It’s fine though, I have a much better idea of what to avoid (steroids for one) plus an even better plan for emergencies than I had before (and the old one was pretty good).

There were a few meds I tried that made me more miserable than I had been before trying them and being able to tell my kid I wasn’t feeling well and needed a break was a big deal. 

Finding the right medication can be a real drag but it’s worth it. Doctors tell us to give new meds six to eight weeks but I’m a huge proponent of complaining immediately and constantly when you don’t feel like something is working for you. It’s possible that your doctor will say to stick it out a little longer (and they might be right) but at least you’ve got a complaint on file.

OP, I didn’t sleep well last night either because it’s close to my period (tendency toward elevated mood) and my husband stayed out late (it’s hard for me to sleep if I’m expecting someone to wake me up at any moment). I should have taken a sleeping pill when I got in bed at eleven but I was doing that in and out of sleep thing didn’t wake *all* the way up until 2am and I didn’t want to be groggy today because I’ve got shit to do...

What’s the point of all that?

I know where I screwed up and I know how to get myself out of it fairly easily. 

I’m not a big consumer of stimulants (caffeine, decongestants, etc) but I definitely avoid them or use them *extremely* cautiously when I’m already elevated. So, I’m going to find shit to do throughout the day that doesn’t take much brain power, and then go to bed at my normal bedtime. If I haven’t drifted off in an hour I’m going to take a sleep aid. 

I know how hard it is to get the mania under control when the depression takes up so much of your time and energy. I also know how hard it is to *want* to get the mania under control when the other option is depression. BUT the mania only sinks you deeper into depression in the long run so fighting it is a thing we have to do.

Take a sleep aid tonight. If you don’t have a prescription sleep aid I know that people use Benadryl (get generic) although it makes some people hyper (I’m not a fan of the day after grogginess, personally). 

Also, call your doctor about your depressive symptoms.

Sleep is *so* important and it’s hard to get a regular sleep schedule with an infant. I don’t know what your support system is like but I had to trash the idea that I was going to be a totally hands on mom and let other people help so I could take my pills at night. 

Thankfully, the sleeping thing gets easier. 

In retrospect I shouldn’t have bothered with breastfeeding, getting up multiple times a night to feed my baby quickly lead to not sleeping at all and it also limited the medications I could take. I didn’t really stabilize until after I started a med that wasn’t approved for breastfeeding. I can’t believe I placed so much importance on a thing that ultimately matters so little. The kid needed a mom who was functioning *not* breast milk. He *still* needs a functioning mom. 

I don’t know if there’s a good time to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder but right after you’ve had a baby is probably pretty low on the list. The good news is that you’ve got a few years to get it together before your kid starts to form real memories though. 😁

Long term, I’ve been age appropriately open with my kid about the fact that my brain doesn’t work right sometimes and I’ve worked really hard to stay stable because my life stopped being mine when I decided to have him.

bipolar,fdxuvbz,t3_enbzjl,1578773130.0,"Really briefly because I’m out running errands. Please take your meds, I spent the first twelve weeks of my child’s life in a mixed episode. I *know* you want to get up with your baby, believe me, but taking your meds is what’s best long term. I ended up being separated from my infant twice before he was thirteen weeks old. 

I’ll check back with you later. ❤️"

bipolar,fdv9hjc,t3_en6djk,1578744931.0,"Everyone’s body processes medication differently but I’ve had good luck on the weight gain front with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, Latuda, and Geodon. Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are mood stabilizers, the other two are antipsychotics. I told my psychiatrist early on that weight gain is a deal breaker so he’s tried to steer clear of prescribing medications that cause it. Geodon did give me cystic acne though, so that was out. 

Good luck. ❤️"
BipolarReddit,fdqlnos,t1_fdqirjs,1578669634.0,"Oh good, I’m glad you reached out to your doctor and I hope the extra Latuda makes a difference quickly so you can avoid the hospital. *Not* that the hospital is a bad thing, mind you, it’s just no fun and my preference is always home (my sheets are nicer, for one😁)."

bipolar,fdqh1bx,t1_fdqejsy,1578666466.0,"I get it, I was diagnosed when my kid was twelve weeks old, I didn’t want to take sleeping pills either, I wanted to breastfeed. Sleep is crucial for us though, it’s better in the long run to get sleep before you lose your shit than try to tough it out. Is there someone who can stay with you and help out for a bit so you can catch up? As parents we’re playing the long game."
BipolarReddit,fdqgjob,t1_fdqdz9u,1578666114.0,"My suggestion is to pack a bag with five days worth of comfortable clothing keeping in mind that they’ll remove/cut any strings (I can tell which sweatshirts/pants I’ve brought with me by the missing strings), toiletries, and paperback books/magazines. Leave your jewelry at home, they usually make you take it off and leaving it home is one less thing to deal with. 

As for what will happen? You’ll spend a lot of time answering questions and a lot of time just sitting around waiting for the next thing. Ideally, there will be activities/group therapy. 

Every single time I’ve been in the hospital I’ve had moments of “what the fuck have I done?” Seems inevitable. So, remind yourself that you can and will get out of the hospital. Morgue? Not so much."
