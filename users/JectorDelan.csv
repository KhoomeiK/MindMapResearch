Planes don't plummet out of the sky on fire from engine failure.  We're talking about an explosion. It's possible that it could happen accidentally, but not nearly as common as happening because of a bomb or, you know, a missile detonating near your aircraft.

Anyone spouting ""This plane had engine failure"" immediately after a crash is absolutely suspect. There's no way they'd know that without direct contact with the aircraft, and they'd have those recordings on hand to share with people if that actually happened. It's super fucking suspect that this is what they announced shortly after the crash with zero supporting evidence and if they had a recording proving this there is zero reason to not release it immediately as it clears them of shooting the aircraft down.

Weird coincidences do happen, but not very often, which is why they're suspicious until you can prove them. You new to reality?"
