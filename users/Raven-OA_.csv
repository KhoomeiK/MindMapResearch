AskReddit,ff8fukl,t3_es1gaf,1579676639.0,"This dumb ass art teacher left my five year old daughter all alone after school. All the parents took off and she did as well. I’m driving to pick my daughter up at the school and find her walking down the road alone crying. She was terrified when I picked her up and said she didn’t know where she was going. Or where home is. She still tells me about that story that happened many years back and now she is terrified to walk alone without me being with her. I literally was in shock when I saw her walking down the road that day. What kind of teacher leaves a five year old? I went off as any parent would. The principal ended up calling the president of the school district. Who ended up giving me some bullshit apology. The teacher never got fired. Ever since that happened the teachers make all the parents drive up to the front to pick their kids up. So no child is left behind for after school programs. My daughter seemed okay once I picked her up and let her know she was safe. When she got home she seemed to be back to her normal self and told me she was okay. However, I can tell it traumatized her."

AskReddit,ff8eodo,t1_ff6rph1,1579675275.0,"This guy who was massaging me started massaging my butt, then he moved in between my legs to where my crotch was. I immediately jumped and told him not that area. He looked confused and left the room. Then came back a few minutes and apologized. My boss told me to go to this shit hole across the street because her friends male order bride worked their. She had never been herself but recommended I go to support her business. It was a Vietnamese  massage place. I think it was escorts though. It was like no massage place I’ve ever seen. It felt like a sex place and the guy for sure seemed confused when I told him not that area. When I told my boss about it she said it probably was an escort place. After all the women was a male order bride. I was expecting her to give me the massage and it ended up being a male. I’m like no happy ending please, ain’t that kind of party dude!"

askwomenadvice,ff76bzb,t1_ff73i97,1579641986.0,I think couples therapy is the best and just getting to the root of things can help. I’m going to my first one at the end of the month. Just be raw and real with your feelings. You don’t have to hide how you feel. It’s just taking it day by day and taking that pressure off yourself. If your partner is willing to work with you then you’ll be alright. Even if you have a great relationship I still think counseling helps. Most likely you’ll discover things you didn’t know the other person felt. They say it gets a whole lot worse before it gets a whole lot better with therapy. It’s also finding the right one. You should never go to one who tells you what to do. They’re not supposed to do that. They’re only supposed to be an ear and to ask you how you feel and what you think would be best. They can direct you where you want to go and what’s best in your interest. It may take a few before you find the right one.  Some are real quacks so you have to be careful. I’m hoping I’ll be comfortable with the one we’re seeing. I’m also seeking independent therapy for myself as well. Just a few suggestions if you want and when you feel ready. If it’s not for you guys then that’s cool too. Good luck! You’ll be okay.
askwomenadvice,ff74ikb,t1_ff6o10r,1579640962.0,My longest relationship was 13 years. We ended when things got bad. Now we’re back together again. It was work for sure and now I’m not looking for the pink cloud. I’d rather be realistic. Some days are great and some are bad. That’s just how relationships are as you said. Good advice!
askwomenadvice,ff72onm,t3_erxsmj,1579639916.0,"It isn’t all rainbows and butterflies. It’s getting through the hardest parts that count most. Plus, we’re only human so there will be day where you feel closed off and then other days where you’re happy and close to one another. I have a lot of the same feelings you do but they come and go. Sometimes I feel something is off and not right. Other days I’m happy and content. Some days I feel I’m living a lie and then others I’m okay. Sometimes, I can’t be affectionate or even want affection. Due to what I’ve gone through. Other days I’m more warm and open. It’s hard for me to trust any guy anymore due to every guy letting me down in the past. I’m not sure I ever will but I’d like to think I can someday. I think the easiest way to get through these emotions is to just go through them. Not to put your life on a single motion of will we be together forever. If you will, you will and if not. Then you will survive either way and it’s okay. I’m not afraid anymore of a relationship ending. I’d rather just live in this moment. In fact I have little expectations anymore due to being let down so much. It’s just a waste of energy worrying about it. If it ends then it ends but don’t give power to that fear. As long as you tried your best. Sometimes you will give your all to a relationship and it still won’t be good enough for that person or vice versa. I think every relationship gets with one another thinking they’ll last forever. If you knew your fate then most would not enter in that relationship to begin with. Unless you knew for sure you would last. I like to believe that, it is better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all. A tragic romance can also be beautiful in its own poetic way."

depression,fer50z4,t1_feph1l9,1579349928.0,"I understand... Sometimes nothing sounds appealing because you’ve done it or you just don’t have the motivation to do it. Which has happened to me many times. What helps me everyday is to look forward to simple routines that make me content. It doesn’t have to make me excited, just happy enough. I feel like the little things count the most. Looking forward to each morning, drinking my coffee on my patio while sitting in the sun and reading. Even if it’s for ten to twenty minutes. Or taking a bath. At night it’s lighting a candle and turning off the lights. While listening to the sound of rain on my phone. Which tends to help me sleep faster. I also spray this lavender spray. Even smells can help a little."
depression,fepdfj2,t1_femrddj,1579317783.0,Perhaps new scenery?
depression,femqz78,t3_epy9c8,1579267063.0,"You needed that pain to come to the surface as it’s been held in too long. I cut my arm too and was not proud of doing so. As I quit for many years. What led up to me doing so was similar to your experience. The year of 2019 was not kind to me. I got in a car accident in February. The guy I wanted to be with did not want to be with me which was the greatest pain to endure. I walked away from my career shortly after because I knew I was being replaced by another female who was a bitch to me. Plus, another person was stealing my tips. They were trying to weed me out. Not to mention the physical pain I felt from the car accident affected any labor involved at work. My neck and back were fucked after that accident. I had to do so much physical therapy and go to the Chiropractor. The trauma from the accident itself weighed on me. I was scared driving and kept having flash backs of the accident with my sister in the driver’s seat. It’s still hard for me to be in a car with others when they’re driving... After leaving my job I felt I lost my second family. I felt I lost my entire support system. I grieved a lot over that. Shortly after I left my job I had four of the most excruciating surgeries. I was only supposed to have one surgery but my Doctor fucked me up. Due to the plumbing bursting from the ceiling while I was under anesthesia in the operating room. They had to cover me with tarps and the Doc had to hurry to finish me which I know is what messed me up. Later at home, in the middle of the night I hemorrhaged and could have died. Had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance. I’m still not recovered mentally from seeing massive amounts of blood and blood clots coming out of me. Had to get emergency surgery for that. It’s very scary when a Doctor tells you you’re bleeding internally and have a blood clot the size of a balloon inside of you. After that hell had taken place. The father of my kids got with this girl who was turning him against me. Shortly after he was with her he hired an attorney behind my back to get custody and he completely turned against me. I was alone in all of this. One bad hit after another. All I could think about was hanging myself or slitting my wrists. I downed a bottle of wine with tons of Clonzepan and cut my wrist. Was rushed to the hospital yet again. I can say I had enough at that point. All the pain had come to the surface and I was exposed fully to everyone. My mom told everyone what I had done to make matters worse. I was just the gossip of the whole family. 

2020 I decided to reach out for help to talk to a therapist. My first appointment isn’t scheduled until February. The father of my kids got back with me after he saw what that girl was about. I’m still not healed from my previous relationship. Have a lot of pain and trauma from that. The guy I’m with now knows that but wants to help me and support me through it. We have our first couples counselor appointment at the end of the month. I’m still not healed at all from the surgeries. Yet, I’m just living my life now and doing as much as I possibly can. Some days I’m a mess and others I’m perfectly fine. I feel with the right attitude you can get to where you need to be. I think when you lose everything you can appreciate what you lost. You can appreciate what was not given to you when you get it. I also think if you’re on the bottom of the pavement. You can only go up from there. Be gentle on yourself and patient. It’s okay that you cut yourself. Forgive yourself for that and move onto today. Focus on what you need to do now to move forward with your life. Even if it’s baby steps. Sometimes life can be a lonely desert but just hang in there."
askwomenadvice,femn1fc,t1_fembeju,1579263226.0,"We all make mistakes and I can say most of us women have been taken advantage of at one time or another. That includes me on this list. Yet, like you I take ownership of what I could have done different to have prevented it. The best way we can help ourselves is to not repeat our mistakes. Perhaps even being grateful for just the lesson learned from it. To view it in another light. So it doesn’t eat away at us. Forgiveness doesn’t excuse their behavior. Forgiveness prevents their behavior from destroying your heart. This is the hardest lesson for me personally but I want to get to a point in my life where I can forgive the people who hurt me. It’s how we let go of that pain and not let it wield power over us. By the way you’re brave for what you posted. I hope you can find peace from it. Because he doesn’t deserve an ounce of your sorrow. I believe that what one does to you will be done to him/her of greater or equal. Everything comes full circle."

Everyone is entitled to their opinions. There should not have been a second time. It probably did lead him on. Not to be an asshole. Just saying if he did it a second time. Yet, going back for a third and this time drunk. That’s just asking to be taken advantage of. You state you liked him but were upset after he had sex with you and basically ghosted you. So it sounds like you wanted a commitment with him? Even after everything that happened. Rationally you feel used and probably sickened by what took place and how he just discarded you. He sounds like the biggest piece of shit given.  He saw an opportunity and went for it. You sound like you were vulnerable and naive. Especially being young and all. I think maybe talking to a professional might help you get passed this."

Christianity,fdqatfu,t3_emhse7,1578661472.0,"John 15:12 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Try not to judge others for you will be judged the same. We all sin and sin is sin. Remember why Jesus died on the cross for us. I hope this helps you and you can open your heart and be closer to those who make you uncomfortable. Nobody is perfect. I’m a Christian and I’m attracted to both sexes. However, I choose to be with a man preferably. If we all learned to accept one another’s differences maybe then we could bring others closer to God instead of away. A lot of the LGBTQIA community is fearful of Gods people because they can be cruel and not accepting. God wanted us to love thy neighbor. It can be a hard task at times as none of us are perfect. Perhaps just practicing might help. Thank you though for your honesty and your post. You might feel bad deep down inside about how you feel. Maybe pray that God takes that away from your heart."
depression,fdq9xi0,t3_emmfkf,1578660640.0,You feel hollow inside and always alone even in the presence of others. You never feel like you fit in even when trying or not trying. It’s like being in a world in fast forward while you’re on mute. You’re just standing still while the world is going on. Everything seems pointless and routine. Sometimes you ponder upon suicide or dying. You feel like a burden and you would be doing people a favor. Sometimes the pain of the past is just too heavy to carry. You wonder what your role is here because for the most part you don’t contribute in a normal healthy way. You don’t feel like you deserve anything. So you sabotage your own happiness or hurt others with your depression. People start to get sick of you if you even have anyone around. You push people away and don’t let others come close to you at all. Afraid they’ll only cause you more pain or you’ll just disappoint them. So you fade away even more into your darkness. Which causes you to withdraw more. Some of us live in the shadows while others in the spotlight.

He was rolling back and forth on the patio floor. When I opened my door to meet him he ran right up to me like he knew me forever begging to be pet. Then he ran up to my kids and did the same thing. My other cats hiss at him but he isn’t a fighter at all. He just looks at them like they’re idiots and isn’t fazed.
