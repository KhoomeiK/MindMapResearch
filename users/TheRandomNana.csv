MadeMeSmile,ff4nihz,t3_eri3bz,1579567918.0,That was a beautiful video. The contented look on his/her face at the end was so perfect.
Sourdough,ff3cpxc,t1_ff38g6w,1579538534.0,"You have to work the loaf when you shape it. There are some good videos on YouTube. Basically you shape and form to build surface tension, and that tension will hold the shape. Have you tried cold proofing? Shape your loaf then stick it in the fridge for a few hours. Take it out, flip it out onto a strip of parchment paper, give it a score or two and then put it in the dutch oven. If the hot pan bothers you, try it with a cold one. There’s lots of ways to get there. You have to find the one that works for you."

CapeCod,fewerdb,t3_eqnv9i,1579409375.0,"I’d get on Pinterest and start reading up. There’s good stuff throughout the Cape. Whale watching, if they’re running then, museums, gardens, P-Town. Personally, I love Chatham. It’s quaint, beautiful, small enough to enjoy walking (good cause parking is at a premium), and lots of interesting shops."

food,fecjl5a,t3_eodles,1578975486.0,"Pardon the really stupid question, but how do you eat the egg white when the shell is still on? Is it all about the yolk? When I grew up we had poached eggs on toast - kinda the same thing but no shell."
Sourdough,fech0yr,t1_fead9v9,1578973720.0,"In my limited experience, mixing with a mixer does cause a very tight crumb, because you’re actually mixing the air OUT. Look up lift-and-coil methods on YouTube. It helped my loaves a lot, and is very gentle on the bread."
Sourdough,fe3tt6p,t1_fe3njua,1578852796.0,"That’s so true!! I never had any luck with leaving my loaves out to proof - I never seemed to give them enough time. But overnight in the fridge, weird as it sounds, does work, as does taking the loaves straight from the fridge to the oven. I haven’t tried the cold oven version yet but I’ve heard it works. I rely on the finger test, which means your finger leaves half a dent - not too deep (comes up a little) but stays dented, when I check to see if its ready. The best way to learn is practice. The vocabulary is confusing but reading thru
 Reddit comments really helps."
Sourdough,fe0igaq,t3_encs3y,1578813902.0,"I admire all the beautiful artisan loaves here but, for me, this is my favorite way to make sourdough, and yours turned out beautifully."
Sourdough,fe0hyw1,t3_enhzvy,1578813723.0,That’s the best part of breadmaking. You can still enjoy the “not as good as I’d have hoped” ones.
Sourdough,fe0gj9f,t1_fdzvbba,1578813083.0,"It took me several different recipes to find one I like. I use the Pioneer Woman’s artisan sourdough recipe on Pinterest. I like how she lays it out and thoroughly explains in plain language, and it has worked well every time. I tend to let mine sit in the fridge a bit longer tho as I used to underproof every time."
Sourdough,fe0g8nk,t1_fdztdjh,1578812927.0,Good luck!
LifeProTips,fdu5ltn,t3_en2dgx,1578727973.0,"My grandkids great grandma got a book for each of them that were made to be read and recorded. There’s a button they can push that will play each individual page. Even after she passed they still have the sound of her voice reading them the story, and a personal “I love you” at the end."
Sourdough,fdtrwxc,t3_emz9sj,1578721252.0,That’s exactly what I did!! I had a lot of fun making crumpets until my starter got more hardy.
Sourdough,fdtrkme,t3_emys1k,1578721094.0,"I had a hard time with keeping the glass jars clean. I use a deli container. I have 4 or 5. I use the smallest one for storing in the fridge, and the bigger ones when I’m going to bake. While the starter is doing its thing in the big ones, I clean the small one so it’s ready to go back in the fridge."
Sourdough,fdtq2ao,t3_emy12y,1578720444.0,"I use Press N Seal. I cut the loaf into quarters after it cools, wrap each quarter in the P&S (“sticky” side out - holds together better), then put all the wrapped pieces in a gallon ziploc bag. When I finish a quarter, I take another from the freezer and put it in the bread box. It defrosts overnight, and the cut edge doesn’t get too exposed to air and dry out. Microwaving it briefly will make it softer but chewy. Toasting in a toaster makes it crunchy on both sides, air frying it for 2-3 minutes makes it a bit crunchy on the outside but still a bit chewy on the inside. The best of the three for a crunchy crust is the air fryer. If you don’t have one you could try the oven."

Breadit,fds7j9h,t1_fds0dzz,1578696125.0,"I had the dense crumb too until I started using the fridge for proofing. Overnight before you shape, the next day shape and put it right back into the fridge. Whenever you’re ready to bake, pull it straight from the fridge to the preheated oven (with a water pan unless you have a dutch oven). The dense crumb means you still have proofing to do, and the fridge takes the worry out of catching it at just the right time."

Sourdough,fdp0xnf,t1_fdolyxg,1578617385.0,"Wait until your next feeding. You discard half so the remaining starter both gets more food (flour) and has to work harder for it (fermentation). You should give it at least 4 hours, or until it has at least doubled, before doing anything with it. After I pull mine out of the fridge I feed it roughly twice a day. It doesn’t have to be exact. Sourdough is actually quite forgiving."

Sourdough,fdp0b2t,t3_emh49t,1578616968.0,"I’m just a beginner, too, but I’ve made loaves in my dutch ovens, in bread pans, and on a cookie sheet. They all work. I use a pan of water underneath when I don’t use a dutch oven. The loaves all vary, of course, with baking style. The dutch oven ones have a crisper crust, the bread pan loaves tend to be softer. What works is what you have and what works for you. Make them whatever way you choose, and enjoy."

loseit,fd4ckme,t3_ejx9gf,1578166390.0,"The truth is, with what you’ve said, you could lose all the weight you need to be healthy and still feel exactly the same as you do today. Your problem seems to be self hate, and your eating habits are a stick you’re beating yourself with. Not exercising is understandable when you’re not healthy, so that’s not a real gauge. Cut yourself a break, find things to love about yourself, and be the best supportive friend that you need. NEVER allow yourself to say, in your head to yourself, what you wouldn’t say out loud to someone you love. Be kind to yourself, and give yourself time to heal, learn, and figure it all out."

I gave some 1/2 sized loaves for Christmas gifts and was a little concerned that I couldn’t cut them open to check the crumb. After the gifts were passed out I glanced over to see one of the recipients happily tearing into it with his teeth, with a flourish. It seems bread, made with care and love, is always appreciated."
