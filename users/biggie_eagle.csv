technology,ff0qcye,t1_ff02ifi,1579471335.0,"That sounds shitty for privacy but I guess it helps prevent fraud.

My question is why isn’t there a centralized government registrar for this type of thing instead of relying on private businesses."

BlackPeopleTwitter,feltgll,t1_felg352,1579230515.0,"not really. It’s because the eyes are deformed and the light gets focused way behind or in front of where it needs to be.

And when people get older their farsightedness comes from the cornea becoming less flexible.

If weakness is what causes a need for glasses people could be cured without lasik."
leagueoflegends,felsxtk,t1_fel21rv,1579230148.0,NA isn’t a good example. The league as a whole just got progressively weaker...

Actually there’s probably hentai or fanfics of this somewhere."
todayilearned,felrigr,t1_fel0fcz,1579229161.0,They should instead make it where you get free annual medical checkups for people who are donors. Helps incentivize donors and makes sure their organs are healthy.
todayilearned,felr6vm,t1_felm6mg,1579228946.0,Did you skip over the part where he had medical conditions and might have died in prison?
todayilearned,felqwsb,t1_felh0gp,1579228754.0,"Lmao “let’s purposefully kill this person so that later on we can maybe save a life”

The paramedics do not have control over where the organ goes even if the patient dies. There’s no incentive for them to do a worse job just because someone is a donor."
patientgamers,felfcv5,t1_fehmowi,1579220854.0,"If they played Quake Champions they’re probably aware of the other Afps titles. The problem is that nearly all of them have the community of like 10 regular players and a revolving door of 5 newcomers that quit because the community isn’t any more alive than their afps.

And an afps player won’t be interested in ss type games because the mechanics in those games are “kill a bunch of easy targets while you’re nearly invincible” vs “you’re fighting against other players, many of whom can kick your ass because they’ve been playing the game since 1999”"

gaming,feldw46,t1_fel34fz,1579219881.0,A delayed game won’t have DLC? If anything the publisher will nickel and dime us more to make up for the lost money.
gaming,feldgue,t1_fekxbfr,1579219597.0,"Then they should have released the game as a “beta” for people who preordered. That’s what many companies do these days.

It would have actually been more accurate than games that sit perpetually in “beta” with very few changes and many of the same known bugs at “launch”."
gaming,feldbl3,t1_fekqttf,1579219499.0,"Also, something called content updates and patches have existed for consoles for two whole generations now and the vast majority of gamers have internet. You can definitely fix a botched release."

I’m going to do you a favor and assume that you just don’t know how abortions work.

You think an abortion is just a woman Thanos snapping and then the fetus disintegrates, and never to be see again.

In reality the fetus and placenta has to be scraped from the womb using tools, commonly causing scarring and lots of blood coming out. It’s pretty traumatic as well. oh and infertility.

Just use a condom."
leagueoflegends,fbykkwf,t1_fbxwvzu,1577219267.0,"The LEC needs deeper talent. As of now they just have 95% of their talent stacked on G2 and FNC.

A team that dominates LEC is just a team that beats one good team.

A team that dominates the LPL like FPX did is truly scary."
leagueoflegends,fbykez5,t1_fbygui9,1577219148.0,"Still be a mystery?

It’s only a mystery to those who only watch LEC.

Also G2 LOST in groups to the Korean team. That’s why they’re the 2nd seed of group A.

G2 lost to IG in groups of MSI.

The entire narrative that G2 was an unstoppable force is wrong."

A lot of people get wrong ideas of what mental illnesses feel like because it’s not well represented in media/entertainment. Tourettes is usually not what “Tourettes Guy” is acting like. He doesn’t exhibit the facial/vocal tics that real sufferers from Tourettes have.

OCD is rarely portrayed correctly as well. People call themselves “OCD” meaning they like to be organized. That’s not what OCD is.

“Schizo” is used to describe someone who is paranoid or crazy when in fact it’s only a subset called paranoid schizophrenia that acts like that.

Then there’s depression where people imagine it to be life in constant emotional pain and dressing up like a goth."
AskReddit,fbtp7so,t1_fbtnwge,1577088557.0,"I wonder how far that goes though. What if someone with a gun verbally threatened you and then you shot them in self defense? Would the law state that since you didn’t have their consent, the part where they verbally threatened you is thrown out?"
