reloading,fecp5yi,t3_eogwcz,1578979703.0,Bought a 3 die lee set for 9mm and with a box of bullets and primers and powder I already had I made a small batch to start out. I enjoy reloading the pistol ammo. The only question I have is how do I make the cheapest loads possible in this caliber? 9mm is so cheap right now that it’s hard to justify reloading it. However I was just becoming a gun owner in 2013 and remember how hard it was to find 9mm.  I want to stock up on powder primers and projectiles to prevent the lack of ammo I had during the last panic.

The only problem is I can’t drop the box truck off where we move too. I’ll be driving it back empty back to my current place. If thats the way it goes than that’s the way it goes. I’m going to be pretty sad thought cause those Isb’s drink fuel like it’s water.

Justrolledintotheshop,fdie4a9,t3_elf0x5,1578440838.0,"While rotella is an amazing diesel oil and I believe in its anti wear properties I wouldn’t use it in their vehicle. Rotella would be bad for multiple reasons. Reason one, modern engines have tighter tolerances and need oil to circulate on cold starts quicker. Second it isn’t the right weight for the engine that you have in front of you and considering vvt systems needing the correct viscosity to operate I wouldn’t try it. Third is that it will damage your catalyst in a gasoline engine application. Rotella and other diesel oils are high in anti wear additives like zddp. These will “poison” the catalyst over time leading to failure. I’m surprised no one has mentioned the last part."

I’m a mechanic so my rides are old but reliable and not to ugly. debt is risk and when times are tough you still have to service that debt. In the next recession I’ll have a stack of cash to buy assets and no monthly burden of a mortgage. I think this boils down to views on risk and lifestyle. I think I understand your math but a 30 year mortgage is insanity and PMI on that mortgage has to be insanely high too.
CRedit,fcl52ko,t1_fcl2a57,1577739980.0,I would hate to live in nyc. I paid for my honeymoon there in cash and it was the best even experience in my life cause it showed me how terrible big city living is. I’m from a rural area and in my state I’m far above the median household income. My knowledge of finance is simple but it’s doing pretty well for me. I’m in my mid 20’s and have positive net worth and if I die my life insurance will buy my wife a house and my heirs will have a nice chunk of change left. I’m still lost on the whole idea of beating companies who spend more money studying our behavior and thinking we can beat them at their own game. My parents were big fans of debt and it’s cost them dearly. For every success story of debt I’ve seen hundreds of horror stories. Leveraged debt is still debt.
