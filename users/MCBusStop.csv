I'm sorry no one ever took the time to sit you down and explain basic male grooming to you or this groom. I'm not saying he needs to change his everyday style but I see nothing wrong with stepping up his game, going above and beyond, on the rare and special occasion of his wedding day. Besides, I'm guessing he doesn't live his everyday life in a suit and tie so putting that on in itself is already maybe a step to ""looking weird"" to friends and family, but why then only settle for a half measure? Besides, it's not about looks it's about effort. It's in the little details that bigger things can be reflected. If you can't be bothered to take your own wedding serious enough to put in the work to look better than your average best that potentially says something about your ability moving forward to go above and beyond yourself in your marriage. 

To that end, no it is not contradictory to think he wasn't trying hard enough if he was fine settling for his usual best effort rather than asking how to make his wedding day more special. In this case it's not hard considering he literally had a picture of how to dress to match his bride to be. Although to be fair if it were me I'd opt for a regular tuxedo rather than dinner jacket, but Grandpa clearly knew the difference and in knowing was able to rock whatever he wanted and totally made it work for him."

Plus, no one will think you look weird on your wedding day if you use a little product in your hair.

Now, to answer your question, no, he probably didn't say that as you worded it. He looks dressed the way he should be any Sunday for going to church. If he went into his wedding thinking that was the best he could do then yes I think he (like hundreds of thousands of other men today) wasn't trying his best. To be fair I get that plenty of dudes don't put that much effort into dressing themselves to go to church, or court, or a funeral... but they damn well should and that kind of mentality is why we're having this convo now.   


TLDR: Step your fancy dress game up fellas."
pics,fcv8iip,t1_fcv201j,1577996855.0,From my experience the only men who wear what their women tell them to wear only do so because they don't know how to dress themselves like a grown ass men.
pics,fcv0r8j,t1_fcuxa9e,1577992296.0,"Thank you! I didn't want to be the only one on here feeling like a dick (no homo) for thinking hubby could have at least tried a little to impress at his own wedding. I don't care if he is wearing a vest and his best pair of hiking boots, it's not good enough son. Dudes today need to learn how to dress and a suit doesn't cut it when you should be wearing a tux."

Selfhatred,fcm1dzv,t3_eht0oe,1577761702.0,Are you saying that you want to travel back in time to commit suicide in front of your recently delivered baby self? Or do you mean that if given the ability to travel through time you would use it to go back and kill baby you thus creating a time travel paradox in which you never lived past birth to grow up and travel back in time to kill youself as a baby and therefore baby you grows up to be current you?

As a fan at the time it was pretty much the only show I made an effort to follow, frequently had to tape it and watch it later (thanks for making me feel super old). It was a super frustrating period in human history to have lived through, dark days indeed."
death,fcb3klf,t3_egrftd,1577581886.0,"Regardless of if you think it a comfort to hear their voice or a crutch to hold on to preventing you from getting over the loss of a loved one I'd purpose the idea of saving voicemails from loved ones to be a worthwhile endeavor in the long run and not strictly for yourself in the wake of the loss. If you don't see the comfort it still might be worth doing simply to have a record of their voice for posterity. Despite all of us having video cameras at our finger tips we still rarely think of sitting down with a parent, grandparent, or loved one and recording them while they speak. Even if we have them in ""home movies"" it's usually meant more like a moving photo to capture a moment, an event, the person is in it but it's not about capturing them. Having a few audio recording of you parents or whoever, even if it's not a profound message, could still be interesting to your kids, grandkids, etc. at some point if they find an old photo of grandma as ask who she was and what she was like."

OldSchoolCool,fba46pi,t1_fb9dvkm,1576663637.0,"Not a spelling error. Single ""e"" is considered a rare and dated alternative spelling but as the word comes from the French ""employé"" both the single and the double ""e"" at the end are technically correct. Which is the best kind of correct. That said, there is a natural preference to the double ""ee"" when a word ends with an ""e"" sound as it eliminates the question of whether the ""e"" should be pronounced or not, when ""sounding out"" the word."
