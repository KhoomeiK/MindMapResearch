leagueoflegends,ffbv5xn,t3_esi6xa,1579783834.0,Good.
dbz,ff7giol,t1_ff7g62i,1579649021.0,"Thanks again for the reply! A bit of an ignorant question, but what's the future of dragon ball?

Is it just continuing to fill the gap between the Buu Saga and the Peaceful World saga? And is there then coming a continuation on that? Or does nobody know?

If i finish Super before it's new episodes release, i might look at picking up the mangas! :) Thanks for the advice"
dbz,ff7fxpb,t1_ff7bc0q,1579648641.0,"Thanks for the reply! I wasn't aware of that last bit at all, i've done some googling and stuff, and all i could find was that Super was officially ended and that the authors hasn't announced any new developing stuff for DB.

From the few spoilers i've had, the anime ends around the ToP with Goku vs Jiren? Does the manga follow this timeline, or is there another skip or similar?

I've never really read a manga except like one book of dragon ball when i was a kid, so this might be a good time to get started, though i'm sketchy about the price of that.

I'd assume they'd work the new Super manga's into the anime as well?"
dbz,ff74nqa,t1_ff6oswl,1579641046.0,Thank you! Are there any spoilers in the BoG movie? Or is it safe to watch before starting super?
dbz,ff74lsf,t1_ff6rgyg,1579641014.0,"Regarding that, is there any release date for Dragon Ball: Super Kai? I assume since it's after the mangas again (right?) that there's a lot of filler like in dbz?"
dbz,ff6omsg,t1_ff6ogfu,1579631647.0,"Thank you! I'll just watch Battle of the Gods, should i just watch the Broly movie after finishing Super?"
dbz,ff6neg1,t1_ff6n4vo,1579630904.0,"Thanks for the reply, i'm a bit torn on watching the Broly movie and Battle of Gods, as i understand it BoG is the same as the first episodes of Super right? Just in a movie version? I'll probably watch both if this is the case.

But the Broly movie is standalone right, as non canonical?

Also, as i understand now the whole of Dragon Ball Super is the years between the Kid Buu arc and Peaceful world, right? So the 10 years between those, are actually what happens in DB:Super / the movies?

Edit: a side question, am i right in the assumption that all original dragon ball and dragon ball z movies, are not canon and doesn't add anything to dragon balls story, but it just ""what-ifs"" and such that retell arcs from db / dbz?"

todayilearned,feolsn3,t1_feokxr4,1579301960.0,"I tried to come off as unbiased as possible, and i truly have no political views regarding the US bombings, i simply haven't done any research whatsoever, so i can't form an opinion on it.

I was merely trying to compare them, as i don't believe you can compare those two things and call them the same."
todayilearned,feoiman,t1_feofjma,1579300700.0,"I mean, that's something entirely different?

While i don't have any political views regarding whether the US bombing people is okay or not, there's a vast difference.

When the POTUS sanctions bombings or are in any way involved in those things, they're targeting people who are a danger to other people, for example terrorist groups and similar.

What those ""serial bombers"" are doing, is killing innocent people.

I'd say those are vastly different things, and cannot be compared."
