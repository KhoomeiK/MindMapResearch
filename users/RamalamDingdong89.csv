The thing is: it's normal. That's what happens when you go through puberty and your brain rewires and you become a new person, different from the child you were before.
These feelings should be taken seriously but not overly catered to. The US society (yes, I think this is a typical US problem) as a whole is putting way too much attention to a, in most cases, simple ""restart issue"". 
Help the teens with their problems and feelings, talk then through stuff, guide them. Help them find solutions and help them grow and prepare them for the real world out there where they will have to deal with much worse, with much less help.

Don't even get me started on that ""wombats are herding other animals into their caves to save them from the fires"" bullshit that got the same attention 2 days prior.

feeding the fish as the post implies. I do agree that the duck doesn't mind the fish eating the crumbs floating our of her beak. I do believe however that the duck would be that 0,5% happier if she didn't have fish trying to swallow it's beak while taking in water.

But 1. have a look at the video. The duck IS trying to put her beak into the water where there's no fish atm. The fish just move along because they notice where the duck is loosing crumbs out of her beak.

2. Have you ever fed fish in a pond and then tried to run away from them and throw food into the water a few meters further? They come right over to where you are. Even if you've got no more food.

The duck is feeding where there's food in close proximity to water with easy access to the water for her. The fish are a nuisance but not actually stopping her from eating. It would be way more if a hassle for her to keep moving away from the fish.

But hey, maybe just go and spend some time with ducks and fish yourself. Other animals, too. You'll learn the difference between real possible behaviour and bullshit spread on the internet eventually."
