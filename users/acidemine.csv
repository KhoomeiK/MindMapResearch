MuslimMarriage,feugxnx,t1_feuf01o,1579386476.0,"Yes of course if I plan not to work I'll understand that I do most of the housework, absolutely not a problem. But what I see around me is that men don't even clean their plate, never cook even if the wife is sick, never ever help, aren't thankful or much respectful over their wives... I've heard husbands calling their wife ""chhht"" instead of their name :/ 

But it is really not the point here haha"

MuslimMarriage,fcxizib,t1_fcxivxh,1578064112.0,Try to be very delicate about it and ask questions that would not shock her
MuslimMarriage,fcxivxh,t3_eja8pz,1578064042.0,"I'm a girl and I don't think you made a mistake here by talking about it. Women should really learn about intimacy before getting married otherwise it can lead to uncomfortable situations and you could have some couple issues. Sexual attraction is a natural thing, it doesn't have to be shameful in a halal relationship.

If you are engagedh, I don't see a problem in talking about it without pushing the edges of adab (of course don't talk about it like many times but like once or twice idk).

I'll suggest you to read the book of Yasir Qadhi ""Like a garment : intimacy in Islam"" and then maybe offer it to her.

May Allah help you and put love and affection between you two."

MuslimMarriage,fcs1gjq,t3_eiis2o,1577909957.0,"I know it's hard but I think you really should talk more to your husband. If there is a problem, something that he does or says that hurts you, you should share it with him. He can't guess what hurts you, he can't read your mind. If you let him understand your sensitivity, your delicacy, if you tell him about your insecurities and traumas, he will be softer, more tender with you. It's not ALL about communication but communication really matters, really affects your relationship.

Maybe try to talk to him more :(

May Allah help you"

MuslimMarriage,fcg7wrm,t3_eh7f0a,1577637353.0,"I used to feel desperate about my family too. The feeling of constantly being misunderstood or not belonging to the family etc. I saw a therapist, we discussed about my feelings and thoughts then I realized that I was too much judgemental with them. So I tried changing my attitude and since we are doing better.

I know that it can be veeery hard to deal with this kind of situations but try to see the good part of them. Try to talk to them, to show them love and maybe things will get better. And even if it doesn't, they are your family and you have responsabilities among them, you'll stay in touch with them for your whole life, there is no runaway. So try to maintain a good relationship with them and be patient (i know it's easy to say..)

Keep in mind that marrying in a hurry just to have a new life can turn your life into a nightmare. Take your time, trust Allah, think about the fact that everything is a test from Allah and that things will get better when He'll decide"
