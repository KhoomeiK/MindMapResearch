zerocarb,fdze6n1,t1_fdy8bvb,1578789391.0,Just wondering... Then why have you stuck with it?
zerocarb,fds8rjl,t1_fdqeyr8,1578696935.0,Nice job! That's great!
zerocarb,fds8pb2,t1_fdqeil6,1578696894.0,Wow sorry about the gut disorder but that's an awesome result!
keto,fdes8sw,t3_eks0m3,1578345531.0,"Currently doing OMAD. 

Today's meal was a 10oz ribeye, two hard-boiled eggs made into egg salad with some homemade mayo, and 2 oz of brie. 

I feel so satisfied and full! 

My meal prep consists mainly of just meal planning and then putting groceries away in a strategic way. I hate meal prepping for the week... I prefer to cook my food as I need it. And with a carnivore diet that's even easier to do. 

It's been 36 days of eating this way and I'm down 17lbs. (1 month of keto 6 days of carnivore)"
keto,fdaxlu7,t1_fdaugso,1578251587.0,"There are all sorts of youtube videos and keto recourses out there that encourage that behavior as a ""reset"" for your system. Something like... get your calories up so that once your body has been in ketosis for months you'll have a higher resting metabolic rate and be able to consume more calories without gaining weight... but I've never tried it because when I eat more, I gain weight. lol typical."
keto,fd9omus,t3_ek6pvd,1578236088.0,Congrats! Keto rules.
keto,fd9ofgk,t3_ekdauo,1578235984.0,"Not weird. Mayo is delicious. 

Have you tried making your own mayo? It's super easy and way cheaper than buying ""the good stuff."""
keto,fd9m4gz,t1_fd9lxrn,1578235255.0,That's good to hear!
keto,fd9lml0,t1_fd9kx9i,1578235010.0,I'm pretty strict about weighing my food and tracking so I should be okay then?
keto,fd9kb03,t1_fd9j50e,1578234605.0,"Why do you think it is that steak causes you to gain? Is it just too much fat? 

I've done pretty well on a high fat moderate protein ratio in the past. When I lost weight the first time (\~35 pounds in 3 months) I was eating a lot of bacon and eggs and steak and charcuterie boards (hello love of my life). But I also included a lot of brussle sprouts, broccoli, and salad bowls from chipotle."
keto,fd9jntl,t3_ekdixm,1578234262.0,"Yes. Tracking calories is important. This also helps keep your macros in check as well. If your macro ratio is off, you may see delayed results. If you play around with macro ratios you'll find what works best for your body. And the only way to really do that effectively is to measure and track what you eat."
dogpictures,fd20btq,t1_fd1xacl,1578139666.0,We learned he had hip dysplasia and a shoulder ocd at 6 months. He’s 7 months now. My poor baby.
aww,fcw5qeh,t1_fctem8x,1578017776.0,"So far the buttons we've used are Treat, Play, and Outside. We also began training Food and Water buttons."
aww,fcw5nhz,t1_fcsugh0,1578017723.0,Haha maybe one day!
aww,fcssqfy,t1_fcsskbj,1577924160.0,Thanks! We just started training this behavior 3 days ago.

aww,fc7d4k9,t1_fc70lkw,1577503924.0,"My dog is my family. I’m single. I don’t have siblings. This is my first dog that’s been just my own. I love him and I’d do anything to give him a pain free life. But it’s hard. 
If anyone wants to help, or has any advice about what I should do, feel free to PM me."
aww,fc6xxlo,t1_fc6xm21,1577492350.0,I know but I love this one. I’ve had him since he was 8 weeks and he’s the sweetest pup. He’s 7 months now and I can’t imagine my life without him.
aww,fc6uryl,t1_fc6u8u6,1577490031.0,"I wish I’d had pet insurance. I’m about to pay 9k for three procedures for my puppy in the next three months. 

 So sorry about your baby. 😭😭😭"
dogpictures,fc6uczh,t3_egb9se,1577489724.0,So sorry for your loss! 😭😭😭
omad,fc59khu,t1_fc597x3,1577449967.0,Yeah. Especially if when you do eat you eat low carb foods. It definitely gets easier the longer you do any sort of IF. But the tip about water is a good one too. Sometimes we crave cause we’re thirsty.
dogpictures,fc59a2m,t3_eg691k,1577449599.0,What a sweetie
aww,fc595qi,t3_eg3g5k,1577449446.0,What Pokémon is this?
dogpictures,fc592cq,t3_eg1xoz,1577449325.0,So sorry for your loss. Dogs are the greatest gift and the best of friends.
omad,fc58us2,t3_ega1c7,1577449052.0,Yeah pretty normal. You’ll probably think about food around your normal eating times.
todayilearned,fc58ois,t3_eg69s6,1577448820.0,But I don’t want a spider on any part of my leg...
aww,fc58mkx,t3_eg7r89,1577448753.0,Is this Ferdinand the bull???
puppy101,fc58jvd,t1_fc58386,1577448653.0,True. I have a little clip on pouch that I use during puppy class but it’s not super comfy to wear for a long time. (Again.. I cant clip it to a front pocket so I have to hook it on the waist of my jeans). Maybe I should get a fanny pack...
puppy101,fc57ogz,t1_fc35179,1577447443.0,Thanks for the suggestion! We’ve done so much of that sort of thing! The problem is that in real life I don’t have treats with me 100% of the time. I suppose I could make an effort to do that. It’s just hard cause girl pants don’t have front pockets so I can’t keep treat in them. 😂😂😂
puppy101,fc57k5o,t1_fc1zm5e,1577447271.0,He comes when there is a good enough reward. I’ve done all sorts of training exercises with him. Inside the house. Outside the house. With other people. At other indoor locations. It’s not that he doesn’t know the command it’s that he doesn’t want to do it.
puppy101,fc57hwt,t1_fc2wwoe,1577447183.0,What’s an emergency recall?
puppy101,fc57h6k,t1_fc2p88y,1577447153.0,I’ve done a lot of that. He knows the command but doesn’t listen. I suppose it’s just going to take time...
puppy101,fc57gan,t1_fc1y6t6,1577447116.0,It’s not that he doesn’t know what I’m asking... he just is being stubborn and doesn’t want to do it. 😅
funny,fc4ch4m,t1_fc3kv9h,1577412676.0,Augie (the older dog) was waiting for us to tell him it was time to go... he doesn't take instruction from the pup.

Need,fc2wuaf,t1_fc2wkvu,1577376151.0,Hello! My karma is over 300. Is there something I'm missing?

Assistance,fc1x2mm,t1_fc1wyxk,1577332376.0,I thought I did that already. Does it take time to show up?
aww,fc0tcz0,t3_efjzlf,1577299189.0,oh my gosh this is great
keto,fc07jad,t1_fc06ajg,1577281879.0,Wow! Good for you! It's definitely tough to fast around family! I usually leave my fasting periods for when I don't have any social engagements. haha too tough for me to fast while everyone feasts!
dogpictures,fc07gax,t1_fc05d9j,1577281786.0,Aw thanks!
