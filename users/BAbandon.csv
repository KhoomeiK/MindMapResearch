todayilearned,fed3lcg,t1_fdjfkvu,1578997100.0,"Oh yeah, the ole Holy grail bowl. I've heard it's next to the natural pot field where the plants are as big as tree's, just past the hot springs with all the hippy chicks that don't grow body hair. Also heard old man Chucks secret moonshine stash is in the area. All the times I went hiking growing up looking for some magical place all the homies talked about while getting stoned, and all I found were meth labs. Used to be a lot worst in South West Oregon. Now that you can't buy Sudafed without a script, you can hike all summer without finding one. Also a lot more rare to stumble on other people's pot farms since they legalized and most people grow at home. Prime hiking time now days! Ever think about hanging the Powell Peralta up on a wall in your house? It would look good!"

Well either that or I passed out naked in the woods and my buddies turned up the car stereo to guide me back in, again... 7th or 34th time now."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdj87n2,t1_fdj702z,1578461236.0,New game? Thought that had been going on since the cold war started. I don't think anything gets the CIA as riled up as a good old fashoned proxy war.
interestingasfuck,fdj6xhg,t1_fdicioy,1578460164.0,"Just think about what we've witnessed, and are going to witness. The world seemed entirely different when I was a kid in the 90's. We keep advancing faster and faster. I read once that from 2000 to 2015 we advanced about the same as as we had the hundred years before. Our phones make Star Trek NG look pethetic. Never would have guessed that I would someday have a computer in my hand that's way faster than the giant desk top we had. It also doesn't notify everyone around that you're getting on the internet like the dial up modems did. I can ninja watch porn whenever the fuck I feel like it. Amazing time to be alive the present is!"
awfuleverything,fdj59tk,t1_fdil95c,1578458825.0,Infested is probably my favorite. Honestly I don't think they put a track out that I didn't like.
todayilearned,fdd9dvt,t1_fdd7dcs,1578300928.0,Nice grew up in southern Oregon. Going by your name I hope you built a sick ass half pipe out there.
