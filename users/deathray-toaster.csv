seduction,ff8m84p,t3_es7h8y,1579685462.0,"I think this is so great! Did she somehow know that you didn’t know what to do? I love that she took it in stride and decided to lead on for you. I would love to meet a woman like that. Because I don’t know what to do either. The date doesn’t have to end just because the guy isn’t experienced in dating. Or because he isn’t alpha and don’t know how to/don’t want to lead. I’m not assuming anything about you or judging you. This is how I feel about it. Anyway, I’m happy for you :)"

AutoDetailing,ff8lsbw,t3_es6qw7,1579684785.0,"As long as it doesn’t rev to bad I reckon it would. I usually polish with 2-3 thousand rpms. If you stay to long on a given spot it kinda burns the rubbing into the paint. So you have to wax it to be able to wipe it off. Or maybe that’s just the 3M rubbing. Also, even if you’re “just polishing” it can still penetrate the paint if you are too rough"

autism,ff79hff,t3_eqc3if,1579643856.0,"My dad told me about when a teacher at kindergarten said to him that she thought that something was wrong with me. And he said: what do you mean wrong? There’s nothing wrong with my son. And then some explanation followed to which I had an investigation. At six years old it turned out I have add with autistic features. I have a few symptoms of autism. Barely enough to give me a diagnose for it. But I still feel like this subreddit is speaking to me. I can still identify with issues that some of you have. I digress. 
Me and my dad go to a school that is *for* different kids, like me. And when we entered my dad was discouraged. Because the classroom had been demolished more than a few times by the looks of it. And he didn’t want to place me there. So I went to completely normal schools for the rest of my education. As a result I got bullied a lot. I could never seem to fit in. But I don’t have any resentment for my parents, because I feel like they did what they could. And I got a lot of help from teachers due to my learning issues. I’m fairly certain they learned about my little quirks through the parental meetings over the years."

It’s even frowned upon for fucks sake! I think it’s beautiful in a way to have such strong feelings. Especially if it’s good feelings. I don’t know if I fall for girls that quick because I’m a social recluse or because I have my little manufacturing errors. But it’s a shame that I can’t share as much as I feel. That’s the way we have to live though."
autism,ff73n0g,t3_eqwvgk,1579640462.0,"I completely get how you feel. Personally I’m kind of accepting my “disorders” for the most part. I still have bad confidence days that are a fucking bitch to get through. But I do my best to focus on what’s good. My work buddies always go to me when they need help with english language. Because I have a big vocabulary due to me absorbing that freaking language so much because I love it! 
They also come to me when they need music information or need to remember the name of a celebrity. Because these things are something that really stick in my head. This is one good trait i have. But like I said, some days are really bad. And I think it’s the insecure part of me that thinks, even though it can’t be helped, that removing my disabilities would solve a lot of issues. Even though I don’t really hate my brain for what it is, but rather the people I sometimes have to deal with. Sadly, that would mean replacing my brain. Along with all of my happiest memories"

But as soon as anyone talks about me so I can hear it, refer to me, or even call my name. It’s like a thunderclap that never fails to shift my attention, I ALWAYS hear it. Why???"
autism,ff68brf,t3_erahbb,1579621514.0,"I figured out how much it takes for my clothes to get dirty enough to wash. But if It’s about a pair of jeans or something that I only wear a day or so, it always goes on a chair or something if it doesn’t get very dirty during that time. It helps to remember to wear it again so it *does* get dirty enough to wash. My room is surprisingly free of “half-dirty” clothes considering how messy I am lol"
autism,ff67ix1,t3_erageb,1579620984.0,"I have no idea if its because of my unique traits so to speak, But i can ”sense” when someone is getting pissed. It’s like a spider sense of some sort. You walk into a room and you can feel in your body that someone is angry. It’s weird, it’s a little scary. But actually very helpful."

AskMen,ff5lh5a,t1_ff4a8g5,1579598687.0,I often tear up when I get emotionally moved. And I always feel a little whimpy when it happens. I know I shouldn’t. But I think it sucks to be ashamed about it
AskMen,ff5l5l3,t3_eriqdp,1579598196.0,"I have add and autistic features. And it affects the way I behave, but whenever I bring it up at work as an issue, I either get waving eyes or they listen but don’t seem to believe me. So I pull excuses that accidentally gets overused. So that looses credibility too. 
I’ve also thought for years that the students in my classes at school all hated me, and I’ve befriended my middle-school bully to find out that they never did. I’m a little fucked up in the head because of the bullying, but it feels good to know that I was wrong about that. But I think it’s a shame that there weren’t more people than my friends, that dared to say no."

relationship_advice,fegmd6h,t3_eop40o,1579097144.0,"Maybe you can tell him that you have theories/suspicions about what he feels insecure about and then tell him that if he does, you promise it’s okay. Because it kinda seems that he would rather take this secret to his grave than tell you, because he might be overthinking it. And then hug him tight or caress his hair or something. Do something that is caring as you say it. I think it’ll cement what you’re saying and convey it in a way that feels true and safe.

I’m a bit of a lightweight so I can get drunk by just downing a drink or three in a small timespan. And I can pour a drink at any aftenoon of the week, sometimes you gotta indulge yourself you know? But I drink like 3 times a month. And I rarely get drunk. So i’d say I have healthy drinking habits. Just maybe a bit more at ease than what is considered normal"

I had just one class that didn’t bully me. I got the diagnose when I was six. And the one always going to the pediatrician with me was always my mum. Dad knew about it. But mum told me that he couldn’t handle it. Because he “knew” that I would have it hard. But him and me are on good terms. We also kept it a secret to other pupils in school. Because it could mean worse bullying. There was a few complications during my teens. But I’ve never resented my quirks, just the people that decided to be assholes, even though some of them had other unrelated issues. And I intend to tell future spouses that I have this.

I can tell you that I’ve seen miserable people in public and well, it’s not like your brain is telling you: go talk to them. But I’ve never considered such a person undesirable.

I started playing video games when I was like 8 or 9. Played halo: combat evolved and was hooked. I don’t remember why I started playing other games 

 My interest in music comes from my dad. He’s been playing music on his sound systems since I was a crazy shit machine (I was very little). I would sing along to ac/dc songs and just completely immerse in the music. I was the toughest toddler ever, you know how it is ;). 

My interest in animals comes from benevolence I think. I really like furry animals. They’re so cute I want to cuddle with every single one I meet, there’s something golden about having a cat or a small dog in my lap. And I think they can tell because they’re nice to me too."
