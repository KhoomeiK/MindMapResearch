todayilearned,fecwkdg,t1_fec8gma,1578987484.0,"Forests are doing it on their own anyway. What you don't see in an old growth forest is all the trees that died along the way because they got choked out by the big ones. By cutting the under brush, you're allowing the survivors to get ahead faster by absorbing more nutrients that would have been available otherwise.

The smaller trees are called ""suckers"" because they are literally sucking up nutrients and water that the bigger trees could be getting. We described to the foresters what we wanted to achieve, which is essentially a good, healthy, old growth type forest. We then asked what we can do to make that happen.

Their response was to do some strategic thinning, and that the forest itself is already doing it on its own, but it will take a very long time. Their advice was to simply help mother nature along its way by thinning in a methodical way."

Go out and drop as many acorns as you can on an two acres. Let one acre do as it will on its own. On the other acre, do some strategic thinning over time, and see which one replicates the ""old growth forest"" that your familiar with the fastest. 

If you want big, tall oak trees, don't let them get any light. They'll grow really tall trying to get to it. If they're too thick, though, they will be competing for a finite amount of resources from the ground. By thinning them, you allow the survivors the benefit of getting more nutrients and water.

The forest is going to do this on its own anyway. All we're doing is helping it along."
todayilearned,fecvquu,t1_fecalsl,1578986536.0,"I agree that an entire region should not be clearcut all at the same time. In my area, timber has been a major industry for a very long time and continues to thrive because of good management. Management is the key word. The companies in my area seem to understand that their longevity is dependent on the longevity of the forests and act accordingly. I realize this may not be the case all over the world."
todayilearned,fecvdve,t1_feccegq,1578986132.0,"Do you have a source on that? My source is two professional foresters, employed by the State of Mississippi, which is a major market for both timber and game hunting. 

Forests thin themselves over time. What starts out as a brush pile eventually turns into a stand of pine, oaks, sweetgum, hickory, and various other species. Over time, the pine spreads and grows pretty quickly, the oaks drop their acorns, and so on. They are all competing for space, soil nutrients, and sunlight.

Over a long period of time, the genetically superior (and fortunate soil and sunlight recipients) grow taller, shading the genetically inferior, disease stricken, parasite ridden, and otherwise inferior specimens. The weaker trees are eventually choked out.

Ground fauna can then sprout and thrive, such as ferns and other grasses. A widely dispersed forest of tall trunks with wide canopies is ideal for most wildlife. There will always be briar patches and other thickets for the smaller animals, and larger animals such as deer like to be able to move around in the woods comfortably just like you do.

So a brand new stand of timber can wait a hundred years to work itself out, or we can go in and chop out some of the undergrowth that isn't going to survive anyway. The dec rate is pretty quick in our region, and it helps the remaining trees in more than one way. 

First, there are only so many nutrients and so much water in the ground, so the remaining trees get more food and water. Second, the competition for space is reduced, allowing for a more robust canopy. The sacrificed trees decompose and provide the best fertilizer in the world, almost immediately providing much needed nitrogen to the soil. 

Certain rodents prefer the thick underbrush, but larger game only likes it for cover and bedding. The larger game is forced into open fields to forage for food, where they are more vulnerable to predators, including humans. A mature forest provides a healthy mix of thick cover and open woodlands. 

A forest is going to develop this way on its own whether we intervene or not. All we are doing is accelerating the natural process. Forest fires can be significantly reduced with prudent forest management, including controlled burns and harvesting.

If you disagree with any of this, I would like to see your sources of information. New information is always being released, and if I am wrong, I would like to know it."

I know a few professional foresters, and the consensus is that a properly managed forest that is thinned on a regular basis will produce significantly more timber over a period of time than one that is not harvested at all. Every few years, you go in and take out the small stuff, which over time gradually gets a little bigger, until all you're left with is saw log timber. Then you harvest all that, replant and wait several years and start the process over.

The time between the final cut and the next harvest can be a couple of decades, but if you rotate tracts, there is always a fresh harvest of every stage. I'm all for having as many trees as possible, but some of the ""don't ever cut any tree ever"" crowd don't seem to understand how timber management works."

Well, you will probably want to record a few songs and get them out into the market place. Studio time costs money, so someone has to pay up. If you want it to really sound good, you're going to need to hire a producer, an engineer, and possibly even some studio musicians.

Okay, the band can pay for all this themselves, so let's say they do. Now what? Where are you going to sell them? It's a pretty limited market just selling them at bar gigs. You can put it on spotify or itunes along with the millions of other artists and get a couple of pennies per download, but it's a long shot to cut through the mix and get noticed.

You're going to tour? Great. How are you going to get the word out in a town that no one has ever heard of you? You need promotion. How are you going to pay your bills while you leave your day job and go on the road? Bars generally don't pay bands much if anything at all to play. 

There's more, but hopefully you get the point. The label pays for the recording, the promotion, the touring, and other expenses so the band just has to focus on practicing and performing. The label has the professional connections in all the distribution areas such as streaming, local concert promoters, radio, television, etc.

It's a big risk financially, which is why most first contracts aren't all that great for the artist. It usually involves an advance against future earnings. The artist owes that money back to the label, but only against future sales. They don't have to pay it back if the product doesn't sell, though."

Yamaha Pacificas have a very good reputation, and it will serve you well also. The main thing is to not get too hung up on which guitar for which style. The guitar you hear most in RHCP stuff is a strat. Jimmy Page is more known for playing a Les Paul, but the first LZ album was a Telecaster, as well as the solo on Stairway. 

Angus Young plays an SG, but I read somewhere it's mainly because it's smaller and lighter than an LP, and he likes the way it looks. Keith Richards and Bruce Springsteen both really like Telecasters, but Keith once said, ""Give me ten minutes, and I can make 'em all sound the same.""

Once you start adding effects and experimenting with different pickup settings and fiddling with the volume and tone knobs on both the amp and the guitar, you will find a wide range of tones in just about any guitar. Pick one that you think looks good and plays well, and just get to playing. If every player spent as much time practicing as we do searching for the ""perfect tone,"" we'd all be a lot better lol."

CFB,fdqzxni,t1_fdqrl5y,1578677652.0,"I would also add that once a coach feels like they've hit the glass ceiling in their current role, their days are numbered. The fan base always wants to find the guy that can ""take them to the next level"" because consistent winning seasons just isn't enough anymore. ""He can't win the big game,"" ""He's taken as far as he can,"" etc. They have to move while their stock is high and they're still young enough to be considered up and coming instead of old and washed up."
sales,fdqz0jk,t1_fdqy5lj,1578677101.0,"Gold has increased, but not necessarily gold coins. It is easier and more efficient to buy a gold ETF. Gold coins generally are not worth any more than their weight in gold, and they generally cost more than their weight in gold. The coin is just a fancy design and adds nothing to the value. They're a ripoff."

We lost 40 something to 40 something. I was so pissed. I walked out of there cussing our defensive coordinator because *Texas Tech* beat us with over 40 points on the board. They went on to do that to everyone they played, and that is when I learned who Mike Leach is. Been a fan ever since."
