offmychest,ff9nws4,t3_esbir3,1579716936.0,If you're both in high school you can date. Any larger than 4 years at this point would be iffy because teenagers go through so much mental development at this point in their lives. Age differences tend to stop mattering once you're older but when 4 years is 1/4 of your life it's a lot more important to recognize.
