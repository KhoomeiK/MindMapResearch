offmychest,ff5023n,t3_ernpwn,1579576627.0,"Even very bright people can make terrible judgement calls when they are making decisions in a heightened emotional state (fear, in this case). 

In your career as a physician, you’ll most likely serve many patients who make decisions based in fear rather than logic. 

Have an in-depth, non judgemental conversation with your mom and find out how her belief systems affect her medical decision making. It may help you in your future to have a better understanding of where a person is coming from when they make different choices than you would."
AskReddit,ff1zjcv,t3_er6f2u,1579489847.0,"If this is to alert partners or potential future partners, I’m not sure how much good it would do realistically in preventing future domestic abuse. Domestic abusers often have a way of explaining away their past (“I was just defending myself”, “he/she was a crazy lying b*tch”, etc), so it may not deter as many people as we hope. 

It may be a better use of resources to invest in widespread educational resources for kids which focuses on coping with stress and conflict so that less people overall end up abusing others in the first place."

Marriage,fe5xaof,t3_enuspr,1578877012.0,"This will be a fairly practical response (as opposed to emotional).

Logistically, in these conversations, you can maneuver her into a partner position, as opposed to that of an adversary. This is for the benefit of you, your wife, and your children.

Next time she interjects and contradicts you, absolutely ELIMINATE any snark in your tone/body language and say ""You make a valid point."" In this specific case, when she said that you were like the person who offers unwanted advice, you could say to her ""You make a valid point"" and then turn to your son and say, ""Sorry - didn't mean to do that."" If you weren't really overstepping, he'll say it wasn't a problem. If you were, he won't say that, and at least you know now. No harm either way.

Watch her overcome her shock at your reaction and validation. Rinse and repeat. I bet she/ll learn a new behavior (validating one another's points, even if they are contradictory) through your display of a new pattern of interaction.

It'll suck and feel like a ""lose"" for you for the first bit, but you ultimately hold the power if you refuse to be an adversary. Keep in mind that telling someone they are making a valid point is NOT the same as saying that you are wrong and that they are right. It is simply validating them. Which you should do for your wife in conversation, and she should do for you. Lead the way."

ABCDesis,fe5ts4y,t3_ckh874,1578874766.0,"There may be some underlying issues here.

You mention that they're older. Is it possible that your parents are worried about making sure you're ""OK"" by choosing a partner for you? They may be worried about your security and be hoping to ease their own anxiety about an uncertain future without them by arranging a marriage. Can you talk to them about this? Maybe start with ""Do you ever worry about what will happen to me if something happens to you?"". They may not have recognized that the idea of marriage and this fear are connected. Don't press them or point this connection out right away. Let the conversation naturally lead to this conclusion. 

Were your parents an arranged marriage? They could have potentially had the same doubts that you did when they were younger but are ultimately glad that they followed their parent's wishes and married. In this case, your adamant expression that arranged marriage is not for you may not be something that is relevant to them - it may be seen as a reasonable response to the request, but one that is ultimately not considered to hold a lot of weight.

As an additional way to address their issues while maintaining your autonomy, ask them what qualities they would hope to find in a partner for you. Show interest in their input. Show that you respect the fact that they have made a marriage work long-term and that their opinion holds value. Start writing down the qualities they suggest looking for in a partner (writing it down should indicate to them that you'll have their input even if something happens to them if they're old or passed when you look for a partner). Let them see you writing them down. Tell them it's an ongoing list and that if they think of something else, to tell you, so you can add it to the list. Considering that they are older, you may be grateful that you have this list if they aren't around when you're choosing. 

Just some food for thought - good luck!"

Parenting,fe5lpk3,t3_enst97,1578871002.0,"We make choices that suit who we tell ourselves (and others tell us) we are.

""I have a sweet tooth"" = I will eat sweet treats if they are accessible.

We don't define ourselves by our choices, we make choices depending on how we define ourselves.

It sounds overly simple but it's true.

Start telling your son what a healthy eater he is. He'll be a healthy eater, despite the environment. Let him overhear you telling another family member that ""he makes the best, most healthy food choices!"". He will.

This must be stressful for you to worry about this - I know I would be in your shoes. But you can make the difference by subtly (or not-so-subtly because he's 5!) praising him for being the type of person who makes healthy choices. If he recognizes himself as that type of person, even when he is surrounded by junk, he'll seek out the healthiest choice on the menu, because he ""is that type of person"".

I would, however, think that her sleeping a lot and not participating in other activities may be an indication that she is struggling emotionally or socially.

Perhaps instead of viewing her extensive sleeping as a sign of laziness, you can approach her with an open mind and inquire about how she is doing/feeling.

It sounds difficult (because it is!), but you can either 1) listen to a long meltdown a few times, or 2) listen to shorter meltdowns until the end of time and always be ""on-call"". There is no third outcome. 

For the children, if they don't learn to self-soothe without you, you're setting them up for a difficult go in the real world (as they'll need to have this skill to have the confidence to start exploring the world).

I think this is something that most of us have struggled with when we were thisclose to being independent but were still technically the children in the house. 

It is her house, so it is her right to have an independent party in there to manage it while she's gone - but maybe this wouldn't be as upsetting if you could voice what you're really worried about. 

It sounds like you've taken on a lot of responsibility in your family (in your comments, especially) and it's reasonable that any indication that you are less-than-mature would hurt (and be offensive, really). But maybe the babysitter is about easing your mom's anxiety and not about a reflection of how much she trusts you to be an independent adult.

Even when it's with someone you love deeply, and after years of sexual experience, the first sexual experience with any partner is often not the best.

It gets really great when you learn your partner's body, their likes, and dislikes, and connect with them in intimate ways before the act of sex.

When you picture yourself with your ex, you imagine a situation where they are in love with you. You may imagine being in the car on the way to dinner together, holding hands and smiling warmly at each other every chance he has a moment to look away from the road. You may imagine feeling warm all over knowing that he loves you so much. He looks at you like you're the most beautiful woman in the world, and you feel sexy and confident. If you take your hand away to fix your hair, he grabs it the minute it's free again. This is the version of him that you are comparing your recent date to. This is a fantasy.

Now imagine being in a car, next to a man who isn't holding your hand. Your hand is resting in between you, and you're hoping that he reaches out for it. But he doesn't. Every moment that passes you are more and more aware that he isn't reaching out to you and you feel sad, confused, and empty. The man in the car with you is wishing he was out with his buddies, or daydreaming about the new woman at work, or wondering why you aren't as much fun as you used to be. You can sense this. He doesn't want to be in this car, on the way to dinner with you, even if in the past he did. This is the reality.
