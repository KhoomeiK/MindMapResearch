oysters,fewmrby,t1_few6w7i,1579414971.0,"I live on the west coast of Canada (Vancouver).  I never thought much about oysters (I grew up on the prairies) till a weekend getaway my wife and friends went on up the coast.  The cabin we rented was on the ocean and was touted by the owners as a great oyster area.  I'm standing on the beach and asking the owner where the oysters are and she's like ""you're standing on them"".  The entire beach was all oysters, it was crazy.  We ate them all weekend, mussels too.

Anyway, it really intrigued me.  Normally Im so disconnected with my food source and then to be walking on a field of protein.

Did you take any training?  How did you get into it?"

woodworking,fe3vkfu,t1_fe3npmb,1578853238.0,"That's the funny thing, tech and white collar jobs generally have very little overhead (a computer, buisness insurance ect.)  A woodworker needs all those same debts as well.  Plus they need a shop, a truck and 10s of thousands of dollars of equipment that  eats money (and possibly body parts) constantly.
