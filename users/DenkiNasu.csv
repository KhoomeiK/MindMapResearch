Anger,fel2hiz,t3_epjgir,1579212634.0,"Hi OP,

I hope you're doing alright now. It's very insightful of you to know the triggers and that'll be helpful when working on issues like this. You did so well by trying to avoid the confrontation! That there is proof you're not a bad person. You can't control the other person, and what they did was wrong, uncalled for, and utterly rude. I'm happy to hear that it didn't end in violence; it could very quickly turn into a stabbing or shooting...and it's not worth it. Even if you don't harm them or get into a fight, they can still claim harassment (I'm not sure where you are, but that's a risk in my country).  


I've always found that a few, deep hard breaths, gripping the steering wheel, and thinking, ""This \[insert favorite curse here\] isn't worth it. Isn't even worth the beat down!"" Or something along those lines. Hell, if it's really bad (your anger, I mean), find a safe spot and pull over. Scream if you need to.  But please don't drive when anger has consumed you. It's not safe and someone completely innocent to the situation could get hurt or killed (including you).  


But no, you're not a bad person. You dealt with this situation in the best way you could, even if you did confront him. You had the insight to know not to fight and you seem like you're working on you. 

Also, on an unrelated note, I like that term ""mean mugged"". Where's it from if you don't mind me asking?"
reddeadredemption2,fekrlxh,t3_eph50o,1579206162.0,"Oh, you're going to have so much fun! Starting out in Red Dead online was a little bit rough for me, since I didn't have gold bars and couldn't seem to level quickly, but it's absolutely amazing how rewarding it is to save up your money and gold for a good gun, then be able to go out and get better pelts for a better pay, and then buy another, even better gun, and so on and so forth.

I don't know if you've decided to do any of the roles, but if you want a role that just lets you explore the world, I would recommend becoming a collector. If you become a trader alongside it, you can hunt while you're looking for the Collectibles :-) It's a good way to level up in both roles, and in general. Plus, good pay. Happy Hunting!"

WarriorCats,fekpjcw,t3_eplllk,1579204937.0,"Dang, that's cold blooded xD

My mom currently helps this old, roughed up street tom cat by giving him fresh food and water, a nice little cage (she leaves the door open and the cage outside so he's free to come and go. It's mostly for cold or rainy nights), and a lot of love that that poor kitty probably hasn't seen in years. She said he jumped right into her lap and started ""making biscuits""  :3

When I told her I was re-reading the series after hearing this, her eyes lit up and the first thing she said was, ""Oh, he's definitely a warrior cat. You can tell just by how he carries himself. "" ^_^ 

It really does make me happy to see that this little kitty felt comfortable enough to go up to these Twolegs in it's time of need :-)"
reddeadmysteries,fekoj64,t1_fejy5ra,1579204343.0,"For all the hours I've been playing Red Dead, I've gotten a good mental library of animal sounds. Like I said, it sounds like a fox's scream, but it also almost sounds like  raccoon chitter, and an opossum screech mixed in. It's too guttural and low pitched though.

 Although, that mix of sounds may have just been what they used to produce that effect. Really neat find otherwise! I'll definitely have to start playing the main story more so I can go and experience some of these mysteries for myself. I'll go ahead and gander that these are not on Red Dead online, right?"

But you don't see me waging a war against every store because I'm not an entitled asshole like these fine specimens. /s

But yeah, get a sitter! You would think they're around their crotch goblins 24/7, so they would want to have at least *one* nice quiet dinner, just the two (or one) of them. 

But kids put such a strain on marriage; after they're born that's ALL breeders ever talk about. Even if it's not directly about the kids, it's always something like how they'll finance their college tuition, new clothes, etc.


...But then there's nothing substantial to talk about at the dinner table because the whole marriage is about  the kids, not them anymore. 

So, I guess parents feel pressured into having the kids there as a distraction to keep them from realizing there's nothing to talk about anymore? But that's just my theory  ;P"

You see a lot of artists, especially comic artists, who get outraged that someone chopped off a bit of their picture (usually the bottom or sides), didn't credit them, and had the audacity to tout the image as their own.

Idk if they still do it, but Deviantart used to offer their users a watermark to put over their images. You could always upload it their and then use a copy from the site to post to Reddit. Saves ya from having to make a whole other layer just to add it."

There's a lot of things that fuel peoples' disdain for sleeping in and for dubbing it as ""lazy"". But, you don't have to work yourself like a dog to earn the right to be tired or to sleep.  Rest does not need to be earned. But as you said, we all have our own paths in life.

There really should be a standard, either we all have LED bulbs or we all have those cozy yellow bulbs that help us see just fine.


If your night driving vision is poor enough, I can see a reason for having LED headlights (though with a prescription, like those dark tinted windows).  However, I think that should only be the exception.

Besides that, isn't it illegal in most states to drive with your high beams on??"
offmychest,fdojeif,t3_emb1oc,1578606349.0,"When I was in nursing school, I cried at the diagnosis of one of my patients with colon cancer. But, I was the only one crying and she (the patient) seemed quite accepting of the diagnosis, as she was in her late 80s. 


My adjunct professor later pulled me aside while I was crying, and though she made me cry more, calmed me down by saying that a nurse who can cry (i.e. really *feel*), actually really cares about their patients. 


And as awful as it is to go through, death comes for us all. But the fact that you provided such genuine and loving care to this patient helped ease their transition to the next life. And that's extremely admirable of you.

The medical field can be a very draining field; emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually. Don't ever be afraid to cry when times like this are tough, but take pride in the fact that you know you gave that patient the best care you possibly could and whatever was ailing  them has passed."
WarriorCats,fdoi7tc,t3_emdi0v,1578605664.0,"Absolutely lovely! That's a very unique art style 🐈
But, you should put a watermark over the character itself. People can very easily crop out the bottom credit, but it's a lot harder for them to get rid of a watermark over the actual image.

When I got married, I had a lot of pressure to do this big thing with family, basically the traditional bullshit. I don't like conventional things in general, and I was quite alright with a quiet meeting. Matter  of fact, the ceremony part of my wedding was with strangers at a music festival :D

But anyway, the *absolute best* advice I was given, was by my sister, who did the big wedding and the LifeScript following. Her advice was,  *if you try to please everyone else, you'll end up not pleasing yourself at all.*"

How is she even living? That's existing in its finest form right there.  I do feel terrible when it's one person that's burdened with all this, however *she was the one with the brilliant idea of getting knocked up* /s

I'm going to assume that you're a nurse or other personal that works with patients, so her not taking care of herself physically in that manner (regardless if you work with patients or not) is really irresponsible. A recipe for getting sick...

Looking back on it, I think my kid brain couldn't fathom why someone would want to constantly take care of something that's so.../dull/. I got taking care of a puppy or kitty; those are fun and appreciative of you! But, I never liked baby dolls and even made it a point to be a bit rough with them. I often preferred Beanie Babies or animal plushies. Hell, I still do! I'll take a kitten or puppy ANY DAY over a kid.

But I /knew/ knew about my feelings regarding kids when I was 12 and all the girls were getting their first periods. I remember dropping to my knees some days after school and praying that I wouldn't get it. Praying that I'd be barren and self-harming because I would get dysphoria each month it happened.

I've since come to terms with it. Part of me wishes my reproductive health/wealth could be given to someone who really wants kids and could raise them well. I'm tentatively looking into sterilization, but my personal belief is that surgeries shouldn't be elective (unless it's desire consequences), however I hold no ill-will against people who have them performed.
