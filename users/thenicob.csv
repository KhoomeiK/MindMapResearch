Can apparently a topic again, although it sounds more like an assumption/conclusion by kicker. juve wants 30 mio, he earns allegedly 14 mio. both are way too much imo. a loan + buy option would be incredible.

borussiadortmund,ff8vnzh,t1_ff8stey,1579697644.0,"More Gündogan type. I've seen a lot rennes games and he's miles ahead of every 17 year old. he's very smart and while you would think he's better offensively than defensively, his strengths are maybe even more on the defensive side.

good tackling timing, his interceptions are really smart, good work rate, good positioning, good passing and small dribblings to outplay pressing situations. very agile. vision is also good already. can play a safe pass but also a explode with a small dribbling to move the ball forward. he's very calm for a 17 year old, hence the nickname Calmavinga. overall you wouldn't think a 17 year old is playing there. 

he's probably playstyle wise a mix between Gündogan and Busquets"
borussiadortmund,ff8u7ct,t1_ff8rwn3,1579696232.0,"true. but I think we can keep up with the amount of clubs that actually offer him playtime. as long as he isn't stupid enough to think he'll get as much playtime as he would get in Dortmund in Madrid, PSG, Man City, Bayern, Juventus, we have a chance.


surely if PSG comes around and offers 80m, we're doomed, but the player also has a word in transfers. if we can manage to keep the fee around 40-50m I'd say we should take the risk. this kid is an incredible talent.


also our prestige when it comes to young players is maybe even the best in Europe. where would you rather go? plus the French connection we already have, the connection to rennes, the puma connection, us getting haaland - there's a lot in our favour and MAYBE rennes even allows us to talk to him first."

stop blaming favre for EVERYTHING jesus christ. reus has been in a slump from the beginning of this season. he has been wasting attacks and chances no matter what position. 


as I said, Götze is underrated as a 9, but who do I keep telling that lol


you don't keep a player who desperately wants to leave. you can keep him on the stands and let him rot there, but NEVER let him play. like honestly, imagine he doesn't train well and then gets subbed in before another player that works his ass of!? that is just ridiculous. 


again, this is all based on rumours and assumptions. I'd rather discuss a replacement or w/e when it's confirmed that Paco is gone and his acted like a little Bitch. There are also people, who visited trainings, saying that paco is not acting up and training accordingly."

2) Keeping a player who wants to leave would be dumb as a rock.


3) We are discussing things that are purely based on assumptions and rumours. Maybe he's a child, maybe he talked to the board in peace about him not feeling well. Honestly, if he never felt home here and wants to go back to Spain then be it. He's still a human and apparently very sensitive.


I am by no means defending his actions or whatever it is he's doing or wants. I certainly agree **IF it is all true** that his behaviour is suboptimal and not very professional.
