aww,ff0qmxn,t1_ff07ywb,1579471411.0,He was a great cat growing up. Never scratched or bit anyone and just wanted to lay on the couch and relax. We got him for free from a family who had several other cats all living in the basement. It was a pretty sad environment and Billy was clearly the outcast of the group. I’m just glad he was able to live the rest of his life in peace. [Obligatory picture ](https://imgur.com/gallery/F4qZh6w) of Billy posted to my Facebook in 2009. I have another photo of him and I that was marked in 2006 but I’m pretty sure we had him for a year or 2 before then as well.
aww,ff0morc,t1_ff0g2qa,1579470301.0,I literally own a cat now and have owned many cats in my life. Some of them were outdoor cats and others had no desire to be. I never said to “make your cat indoor” but there are steps you can take to make sure your cat is able to go outside while also not getting itself into trouble. I think that a cat should be able to go outside but I know it’s not always possible. An outside cat can become in indoor cat with proper training and inside stimulation. It happens all the time in rescues.
aww,fez2lfy,t1_feyz7fq,1579453268.0,"Obviously it’s too many and there are a lot of people trying to stop the increase of the stray cat population especially in places like Australia where there are many native birds that reside only there. I don’t know if it’ll ever be possible but controlling the population does need to happen. 

My comment before was because you said “no it isn’t...” when someone commented that cats hunting small prey is natural. It’s absolutely natural for cats to hunt but that doesn’t mean it should continue the way it is if other species are going extinct because of it."
aww,feyzxmz,t1_feyoe6x,1579452552.0,This is true and not true. Cats need a lot of mental stimulation and the outdoors is an easy way to give them all the stimulation they’ll ever need. Unfortunately letting a cat outside can do damage to the ecosystem or to themselves so it’s better to either put them on a leash or build a catio so they can still enjoy the wonders of the outdoors while also staying safe and not eating anything. Keeping a cat strictly indoors is fine but there needs to be some mental stimulation available or they’ll get bored.
aww,feyy6po,t1_feywj5z,1579451907.0,Yes stray cats are doing a lot of damage to the bird population however it’s still natural for them to eat and hunt birds as well as rodents. The large population of outdoor cats is probably because of humans but cat’s have been hunting small prey forever. Just now there’s a lot more of them.
aww,feyw2eg,t1_feyiv2d,1579451154.0,I once had a cat named Billy who had no desire to go outside or watch birds from the window. Only ever wanted to lay on the couch. We also had a very old bird that had injured its wing several years ago and so couldn’t fly. Well we got a kitten and one day my grandma came home and saw the bird cage on the ground and obviously thought the worst but to her surprise Billy was laying on the ground with the bird on one side and the kitten on the other. We don’t know how long they were like that but I’m just glad Billy was there because that kitten would’ve 100% eaten that bird if given the chance. Billy passed away several years ago but that bird is still alive and well.
AnimalsBeingBros,fdtzmka,t3_en1dy6,1578724893.0,I follow a wombat rescue and it’s sad the things they’ve seen. Wombats aren’t always treated so kindly. They are absolutely adorable though and obviously beneficial to other wildlife.
aww,fdqs5xn,t1_fdqexn3,1578673725.0,Though I agree with a lot of what this article says you can’t just let zoo animals free. Many of the animals in zoos have been born and raised in captivity and cannot survive in the wild on their own. Especially an animal like a white tiger which has no camouflage whatsoever and is inbred as hell. One day I hope zoos won’t be a thing but I’m sure that won’t be for awhile.
aww,fdm4ovl,t1_fdlbgc8,1578539721.0,Glad they didn’t. Bottle feeding would’ve probably done more harm than good. Shouldn’t bottle feed a random baby animal anyways.
Sims4,fdh3ms0,t3_elbi8f,1578414663.0,Yeah townies are definitely something else. Thankfully it doesn’t bother me too much and I’ve never bothered to “fix” any of them. I wouldn’t mind seeing them cleaned up a bit though. I enjoy some of the wackiness that is the sims and that includes terrible style choices in my eyes.
aww,fdh1hb2,t1_fdgkazk,1578413326.0,Yes however there wasn’t an excess of dogs. She had maybe 10. I’d call her a backyard breeder over a puppy mill where they’re producing dozens of dogs all the time.
aww,fdgf32h,t1_fdg2qdh,1578393831.0,Last year several rescues in my area worked on rehabilitating golden retrievers that were taken away from an unethical breeder. Not necessarily a puppy mill but just bad breeding practices and living conditions. They had puppies of all ages and sizes as well as adults. Some were listed as golden mixes but there were a few purebreds as well.
Sims4,fde2w54,t1_fddp8eo,1578329964.0,Yeah and there were a lot of people like you too. I think the “open” neighborhoods is a much better concept. Almost like a middle ground but as I said before I do wish you didn’t have to load into buildings in the neighborhood you’re in. If they could do that then the Sims 4 would be perfect in my eyes. At least when it comes to world/neighborhood layout.
Sims4,fddf64i,t1_fddeof2,1578309489.0,I mean if they can get open world working well for most people then I’m all for it. I’m just a little skeptical over Sims 3.
Sims4,fddewm5,t1_fdd1ra4,1578309127.0,Love this website!! Without it I’d lose so much progress and information on my Sims.
Sims4,fddes4c,t3_ekrcq1,1578308958.0,When my legacy sims get older I like to bring them to cas for a makeover. I get to use clothes and styles that I might not use on a younger sim which is nice.
aww,fddee1s,t3_ekrw99,1578308407.0,That one closest to the camera took a nibble out of a couple bowls till they found the right one haha. Honestly impressed with how well they’re eating and not crowding around one or two bowls.
Sims4,fddd7kb,t1_fdd7vbt,1578306679.0,I don’t particularly want open world since it can be incredibly buggy and laggy for a lot of people but I wish there weren’t loading screens in the neighborhoods. I’d like to be able to go to my neighbors house or a shop and not have to load in.
aww,fd3hc0j,t1_fd1lrao,1578158331.0,"If you put something online that could possibly harm someone or something, and yes eating whipped cream too much could possibly harm an animal, then i see no issue in pointing that out. Obviously if you do something in your own home then that’s on you but on the internet you have thousands of people watching and some of them could be very impressionable. 

I don’t expect every OP that does something even moderately dangerous to put a disclaimer but I don’t see why someone else pointing it out in the comments is such a bad thing so long as they’re at least decent about it. When it comes to animals especially it’s very easy for people to get ideas and just go with it without proper research."
aww,fd1g5y8,t1_fd18xrh,1578130941.0,“Everyone” is a broad statement. OP says in a comment down below that the top picture is the most recent one. Picture order shouldn’t matter so much that it overshadows the achievement of getting an animal healthy again. That should be the main focus.
aww,fd1ex33,t1_fczyokp,1578130612.0,I don’t understand why everyone is so upset over the picture order. It’s really not that serious. Especially when we’re talking about an animal getting healthier. That should be the main point.
aww,fd1cz71,t1_fd0rxds,1578130002.0,Even if OPs pets are healthy someone else watching might get the idea and do it too often.
Sims4,fd0i5oj,t1_fd0544x,1578119149.0,I have never finished a 100 baby challenge but I love starting new ones! It’s just such a silly challenge and always a lot of fun. The most I’ve gotten to is like 52 or something. I just always lose motivation haha.
aww,fcvmto7,t1_fcvdx3d,1578005487.0,I never said the baby couldn’t be the same age.
aww,fcvadsa,t1_fcv8jq4,1577997968.0,That makes the most sense I think. Both baby and kitten are a month old in picture but were technically born 3 days apart...a month ago.
aww,fcva377,t1_fcv9619,1577997796.0,That kitten is way older than a week. Probably closer to 5.
aww,fcrohq4,t1_fcrc1b1,1577904501.0,I thought big sister as well. Her face and size look pretty young.
aww,fcrb62u,t1_fcra420,1577899414.0,I’m the same way. My boyfriend and I don’t plan on having any kids either so our pets are the closest thing we’ll get. I have many nicknames for my pets and “baby” is just one of them.
aww,fcr44bx,t3_eii4yv,1577896499.0,I don’t know why people are getting upset that you called the puppy your daughter.  It doesn’t hurt anyone or anything to say that. I call my cat my baby but I obviously know she’s not human. Let people be happy.
aww,fcolqjn,t1_fcoc847,1577835406.0,Ugh I can’t believe they even declawed the poor thing. People like that don’t deserve the love of an animal.
Sims4,fcmr9j5,t1_fcmnwbi,1577788302.0,I recently allowed up to 6 children. I’m both excited and terrified at the idea.
Sims4,fcly6ev,t3_ehmn6o,1577759358.0,I love MCCC so much. It has really helped spice up my gameplay. I have it set so it doesn’t interfere with my active household because I’m pretty sure I’d get lost in all the drama but my townies can do whatever they please. I recently made it so they can have up to 6 babies from one pregnancy and increased the household number. We’ll see how that works. I love how alive the world feels now.
Sims4,fclxp9m,t1_fcl4p1w,1577759020.0,LOL! This is similar to what’s currently happening in my game. I created my actual family in game and decided I’d just let them do whatever while I play myself and boyfriend. My elderly mother decided to get married to some young adult hunk and move in with him. Well she eventually passed away and a few days later I went to check up on my siblings and one of my sisters had married the same guy and had a kid with him! I couldn’t believe it haha. She was just waiting for the opportunity apparently.
Sims4,fcjjy9c,t3_eh6q3w,1577690603.0,Hmmm this makes me want to fiddle with my MCC and raise the household number and multiple babies percentage. I love a good challenge haha.
aww,fc3tyca,t1_fc3sbfr,1577398558.0,Yeah my boyfriends family got 2 kittens last year and the female kitten became sexually active but the vet wouldn’t spay her till she was a bit older. They kept saying she wouldn’t be sexually active for a few more weeks but she was doing all of the characteristics of being in heat. I think they also wanted her weight to be up more? Not sure but she’s fixed now thankfully. Now every once in awhile she’ll vocalize and act like she’s in heat and it can get pretty loud.
Sims4,fc2wli2,t1_fc2fs6u,1577375969.0,I was seriously surprised when watching an old sims 4 YouTube video and you couldn’t even lock doors! Like that’s so basic! Thankfully I got the sims 4 a couple years after it was released but things like that should be in the game since day one.
interestingasfuck,fbvx5ym,t1_fbtv81t,1577137374.0,Albinism can actually affect more than just their coloration. Animals with albinism can also suffer from sunburns and blindness as well as hearing loss. It varies based off of how the gene mutates.
