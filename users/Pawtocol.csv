What makes you feel that this is only a good investment for pet owners? We believe this platform will also benefit local businesses that are trying to compete with national big box stores or veterinarians that are building their practices and doing important research.

Pawtocol_official,fde0lyw,t1_fddthl4,1578328475.0,"Blockchain is just one type, albeit one of the most common, of distributed ledger technology.   A blockchain can be thought of as a series of blocks that are connected to one another ""in a line"", where the end of one block is ""connected"" to the beginning of the next block, and so on.

dogs,fddyklv,t3_ei3g81,1578327104.0,"I do have a future plan with dogs - I started working for a dog company that uses blockchain technology to enhance their lives. I lost my dog last year to a senseless disease that could have been prevented if all my dog's vet information was in one place. Because it was scattered through different vets throughout the years it was impossible to track down. After this mess, I swore I work in the pet industry and do my best to increase the lifespan of all animals, not just dogs. Anyway, that's my story for 2020. Taking personal loss and using technology to fuel my inspiration."
