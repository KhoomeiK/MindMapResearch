piercing,fela1tf,t3_eppyn5,1579217349.0,"Labret jewelry does work for conch and tragus piercings. How old are your piercings? If they're old enough to downsize, try to eyeball how many extra mm of length there are so you can order an appropriate length of post (you may have to try a couple different sizes of post). Your daith will probably be good with a 5/16th"" diameter ring or 3/8"" if you prefer larger. You'll most likely need 16g jewelry, and I also suggest getting a 16g taper to help change out the jewelry (to do this take the ends off your existing jewelry, put the end of the taper in there to back the jewelry out while keeping the hole open, then put the new jewelry on the end of the taper and guide it back in). Get a 2 inch taper that you can bend to make the hard to reach ones easier to reach.

Also, you could try threadless jewelry which is less likely to randomly fall out.

Good luck!"

You're supposed to switch to shorter posts after about 8-12 weeks and the swelling is gone completely. If you're still wearing the initial piercing jewelry it's probably too long and getting irritated by catching on stuff. If it isn't implant grade material, that could be another cause for irritarion. Additionally, you do NOT need to do salt rinses every day and especially do not touch your piercing to clean it. Don't touch it at ALL and just let the water in your shower rinse off any crusties.

Tl;dr your problems can be solved by any combination of the following: 1. Get your current jewelry switched to shorter posts made of implant (NOT SURGICAL) grade titanium, steel, niobium, or at least 14k gold. 2. DO NOT TOUCH IT not even to clean. 3. Do not sleep on it."
