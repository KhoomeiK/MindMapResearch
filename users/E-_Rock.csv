fantasybaseball,fcxcqvl,t3_ej91fa,1578059376.0,"I run a ten team roto redraft league.  Our big difference is we do not have a hard cap.  We have a soft cap that taxes every dollar spent over a certain amount (last year $200) at 200%.  This makes for some pretty wild differences in roster cost/construction.  Ex. one team cost around $190 for the whole season, waiver adds included, while another team spent nearly $400.  All waiver pick ups are taxed $1 in addition to the FAAB.  Our league is also different because our roster sizes are really small.  We're from an NL city (purists that will never accept the DH), so we only have 8 hitters in the every day starting line up- 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, C, 3 OF. We have 5 SP slots and 1 RP with an innings cap of 1100.  League is 12 years old with the same format for 8 years, always used yahoo.  All friends and family too, so there is a lot of shit talk through out the long slog of a season.  

I only have 2 complaints.  I would like to move away from yahoo to fantrax, and want to add a utility spot as a de facto DH.  The mob rule of democracy has prevented both changes, but I propose them before every season at our ""winter meetings.""

Edit- forgot it is now 11 teams, so there will be 198 players auctioned instead of our past 180."
