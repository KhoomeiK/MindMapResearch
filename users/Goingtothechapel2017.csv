Buying premade cheese alternatives is probably a good way to go, violife is pretty good and miyokos. I like Daiya but a lot of people don't. Just don't expect stuff to taste exactly like cheese, it will be different."

vegan,fez27gp,t3_eqsfok,1579453157.0,"I took so many acne medicines in high school and washed my face daily with the Proactiv stuff. Then i finally told my doctor I'd had enough with temporary fixes so they put me on accutane. Which i wouldn't recommend to anyone...it messed with my head and dried out my skin horribly. It did work...for a time. But about 5 years after i had regular breakouts again. 8 years ago this summer i went vegan...and that did it. I know it was dairy in particular because that took me a bit longer to cut from my diet and within a couple days my skin had improved significantly. I still get hormonal acne sometimes (though not right now since I'm pregnant) but that is easy enough to handle.

Congratulations to you! It's amazing the differences a vegan diet can bring."

It's just that up until that point every character important to Harry that died actually had a death scene.

QContent,fe6nfkh,t1_fe6fjsy,1578896985.0,She's also in an upgraded model from her previous body. She'd know what features she was used to and what was part of her firmware. This feature disturbs her and seems to be triggering dysphoria so the conclusion is that her previous body didn't have it.
