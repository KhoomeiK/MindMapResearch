movies,feti32d,t1_fepir0z,1579375636.0,There is an excellent book called Q by Luther Blissett that covers it in a section. The book is about the life of a religious zealot and the various movements he joins/fights in. A good third of it is about him fighting in the Munster rebellion. The book is in the public domain because the writers let it be so it’s free to download.

television,fdy8jeq,t3_enbo8o,1578777188.0,"There is an episode in the show Jeremiah where Jeremiah comes to a town and finds two brothers  acting as doctors. He discovers one of the brothers is a straight con man but the other knows a little about medical treatment because he has some medical books. He forces them to stop treating people because only doctors can do that.

Except the entire premise of Jeremiah is that everyone who was over 13 died in a world wide plague. So there are no real doctors left and these guys were pretty much the closest thing that town probably had!"

I believe over all people are generally good so if they don’t know about god then that’s basically a free ticket to heaven. By spreading it you only damn innocent people to hell.
LPOTL,fdcjk6y,t3_ekkno7,1578276486.0,They mention it in the 9/11 episodes and say they will talk about it later in the episode but they never do. Really disappointed me because I had never heard about it but it would make a lot of sense.
