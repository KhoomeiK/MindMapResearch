pokemon,ffb19ng,t3_esk403,1579749297.0,"I mean, red and blue are probably more popular throught fans in general though.  You can't forget how many people only played the first games and watched the anime a bit.  

I'd say this is most likely correct if you're looking at the community online.  However, that is a small fraction of pokemon fans out there.  

I believe if we look at every single person that's played pokemon and still says they like pokemon, the majority probably played rby and maybe gsc but didn't progress past that."
pokemon,ffb0tiw,t1_ff9uqzn,1579748992.0,"I mean, that just sounds like you're admitting Gamefreak (the hippo suggestion guy) should've communicated and planned better (same with Kamen Rider guy) which is what I just suggested could be fixed but okay. 

Look whatever excuse people want to come up with for a multi billion dollar company coming out with a mediocre game is fine.  I have too much going on in real life to argue this in depth online."
pokemon,ff9qtzx,t1_ff94c12,1579718991.0,I'm still not seeing why that means the games can't be delayed to make a better product.  They can still release the merch and trading cards as another ad for the games.  Or they could actually plan in a way that multiple billions of dollars should allow them to and delay merch or the anime until the game is ready.
pokemon,ff9qhhr,t1_ff9pwzf,1579718729.0,"I mean, it's an anime already only loosely based on the source material (the game).  Filler has been around forever (dragonball, sailor moon, bleach, pokemon itself).  The pokemon company as a whole can do better with the ridiculous money coming in from this franchise to coordinate their anime and other merchandising with the game if needed.

It's ridiculous to make these excuses when they can plan better for the possibility that a game needs more polish before hitting the shelves.  You ABSOLUTELY can plan around a delay.  If a game is delayed because they've noticed it needs longer to finish you can work with that and create new timelines for other products.  It shouldn't be hard for a multi-billion dollar company.

Of course now they know they don't have to because the fans will buy anything with the name ""pokemon"" on it.

Actually, that's a good point.  Why are we even bothering to have this conversation?  Pokemon games (or any of their products) will never be high quality until they have actual competition."

According to this study: https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2812.pdf it would appear that workweeks on average haven't really changed that much at least between 1950 and 2000 (of course there's 20 more years since then so that may be different now, I'll see if I can find a study that includes us millennials).  Except women, women work a LOT more now than they did during the boomers' start in the workforce (excepting unmarried women, their workweeks didn't seem to change much).  If you take women into account, which we should, newer generations as a whole do work more than boomers did.  I'll try to find a wage adjusted for inflation study too."

Do you honestly think all the boomers worked those jobs?  How long ago do you think boomers worked?  The majority were already moving into service jobs.  If the majority of boomers worked 10-12 hour shifts every day then that would reflect in modern studies.  However, modern studies show that work weeks have only increased since then.

Talk to any prosecutor or defense attorney.  Juries are DUMB they make decisions based on emotion way more than based on evidence.

One of my law professors (a practicing prosecutor) made a joke that isn't really a joke, ""everyone that winds up on a jury was to stupid to get out of jury duty.""

You don't have to have a strong case anymore either.  90% of all cases are plead out regardless of the strength of your case.  Being innocent until proven guilty is honestly a pretty outdated notion at this point (even though everyone still likes to pretend it's what we do.)

Also, I have no idea what types of work are best for that, I'm still trying to figure it out.  It seems generally that government work allows leaving at the time your workday is suppose to end so I'm probably going to gravitate toward that.

I'm not a big law/contracts/deals kind of person.  I'll never be a salesperson and I'll never pretend to care about business.
