I think you're mixing up your human facts, because that is *not* a difficult trick... <_<

What you're probably thinking of is that A) humans have sweat pores almost *everywhere,* whereas most other mammals are basically limited to nose & foot-pads (why these, I can't really say) and panting for heat-removal, and B) quadrupeds' breathing *is tied to their movement.* i.e.: while at speed, they can only intake and expel air at the same rate that their legs are moving, so both quick, shallow breaths and long, deep breaths aren't available options until they come to a stop, which means both overheating and oxygen-deprivation/lactic-acid buildup are inevitable risks.

After doing that a few times (might need to leave it off for a while, too? Not sure.), the boot bug will disappear, and I can (usually!) cold boot just fine... until the *next* time I save any BIOS settings changes, even if it's as simple as tweaking the fan profile.

After that, I checked my Device Manager, and saw that the AMD PCI driver was still version 1.0.0.74 (and not 1.0.0.75 as it should've been.) I was able to point it at the AMD install folder and have it update itself properly, but I don't know how/where to force the SFH or 'MicroPEP' drivers in. :/

Edit: Okay, yeah... **Uninstall**ing **AMD Drivers from Windows Apps/Programs & Features** from regular, non-Safe Mode Windows and then immediately restarting the install with no reboot or fancy tricks or anything in between seems to work fine.

And *that* seems to have fixed it, without disabling FreeSync.

...so maybe try something like that, and see if it works."
Amd,felq42i,t3_eo6om7,1579228206.0,"\****SOLUTION / WORKAROUND DESCRIBED BELOW!***\*

- MSI X470 Gaming Pro Carbon / 3800X (also occurred with 3700X & 2600X in the same system) / G.Skill FlareX 3200CL14 @ 3800CL16 / MSI RX 580 Gaming X 4GB / 750W EVGA G3 PSU / Samsung 960 EVO M.2 (+ some SATA drives), Win 7 / Win 10 1803-1909, all with the latest drivers for the past two years.

- One Monoprice 1440p 144Hz TN Panel (which they *told* me was VA... \*mutter\*...) connected with an Accell UltraAV DP 1.2-certified DisplayPort cable (tried multiple other high-quality cables, too.)

- No CPU (core) overclocking. RAM is overclocked from 3200 to 3800MT/s, but the issue occurs even at 2400MT/s.

- FreeSync enabled. Disabling it stops the flashes. Enabling Anti-Lag or Enhanced Sync seems to worsen the frequency with which they occur.

- No 3rd party overclocking software. Windows Defender & Radeon Settings, basically. The issue occurs even on a fresh install, most visibly when scrolling in a browser (Chrome / Vivaldi / Firefox / Pale Moon... Firefox seems least affected) or when scrubbing through videos (PotPlayer / VLC / Media Player Classic).

- Yes. Disabling FreeSync fixes it, as does running at 60Hz, while 120Hz *reduces* the rate of occurrence... but I want to **use** FreeSync, damnit!

- Actually, I rarely notice it in games (although I don't game all that much these days). More often, it's as described above: general browsing and scrubbing videos. Basically: anytime I go from low-(graphics-)load to medium/high-load.

- Anywhere from once a day to several times per minute, apparently depending on the number of background processes.

- I get black or green screen flashes/minor corruption for what seems like 1-2 frames, then it quickly recovers. Blink, and you'll miss it. With a lot of browser tabs open in the background and a video playing, though, the frequency increases and has on several occassions actually built to the point where either the whole system suddenly locks up and becomes completely unresponsive (with the last displayed frame stuck on screen and the audio buffer looping to produce an awful screech/death-rattle until I force a hard shutdown/reboot), or it spontaneously reboots with no warning... and doesn't provide any error message in the Administrative Events log in either case.

- Undervolting & overvolting the CPU and GPU, loosening RAM timings, tightening RAM timings, setting everything to default, testing different refresh rates, making sure Fast Boot was disabled, *watercooling the entire GPU,* swapping out cables, using a different DisplayPortPort, using a different PSU port for the GPU power cable, flashing a new GPU BIOS, *changing the motherboard, RAM, PSU and processor* (previously an Asus 970 Pro Gaming/Aura with an FX6350 and Seasonic 660W Gold X-Series), not using my M.2 drive, reinstalling Windows, cleaning GPU drivers out with DDU and reinstalling, forcing browser hardware acceleration both off AND on, twiddling the Voltage Swing and Pre-Emphasis override settings (this seemed to help a *bit,* but not enough), altering the FreeSync range of my display from 40-144 to 44-132 using CRU (again, this helped a *bit,* it seems, but still not enough), tweaking every conceivable BIOS setting on and off, swearing, crying, pleading, etc...

- ***I HAVE SOLVED THIS ISSUE*** by setting a [flat(-ish) frequency profile](https://i.imgur.com/iDQ4fkn.png) in Radeon Settings / Tuning / whatever you call it these days now that it's not 'Wattman' (I'm not calling it ""Radeon Software"", by the way. That's just dumb.) Something about changing GPU frequency states is causing a frame skip or a FreeSync blip or something to that effect, and reducing the number of state changes seems to resolve the issue. However, for some reason unbeknownst to me, I can no longer set a profile and expect it to *stay enabled* after a reboot / after waking from sleep, regardless of how minor the change. Even DDU'ing and installing Adrenalin 2019 doesn't help. ...the only thing I can think of that's changed significantly is that I installed Ryzen Master a few months ago, and got a Razer mouse (with its accompanying infuriatingly-awful software) for Christmas. But otherwise, anytime that profile is enabled, I CAN USE FREESYNC WITHOUT ANY FLASHES.

- I know that it's likely related to the quality of my display's FreeSync implementation, but the fact that altering my GPU state profile solves the issue implies that a GPU-side fix is absolutely possible. Searching for others experiencing this problem is also extremely difficult, given the vagueness, randomness, and easily-overlook-...edness... of the issue, along with the number of different ways that people might describe it, so the number of customers struggling endlessly to resolve this to no avail (or just ignoring it but getting increasingly frustrated by it) is likely far, *far* higher than any poll or forum search might suggest.

Update: Removing Ryzen Master & uninstalling both the AMD Chipset and GPU drivers from safe mode and then reinstalling them still doesn't allow my profile to persist. What gives?"

My mother's allergic to normal, fast-rising-yeast bread but (somehow) not stuff like sourdough. So no fast food buns or grocery store loaves, and we've been, uh... culturing bacteria in a jar... to make our own sourdough, but if anybody knows if anything *other* than sourdough can sidestep that allergy (and might be available for sale somewhere without making it ourselves), I'd appreciate hearing about it."
toronto,fe6dwfd,t1_fe6d3d8,1578888042.0,"Yeah, I kinda figured you were a dick.

It's astoundingly arrogant of you to claim that **I'm** the uninformed one immediately after me informing *you* of something that you admitted to being confused by (as well as providing a list of answers **and** sources in response a question you'd asked me) while using the only link that *you've* provided in this entire thread to childishly attempt to insult me by hypocritically putting words in **my** mouth.

toronto,fe6cqa3,t1_fe69juu,1578887123.0,"If I reference the dozens of people in this comments for this post alone unequivocally stating that the relatively frequent nature of the alerts, their unnecessarily jarring and potentially-dangerous noise, their poor or nonexistent localization, their tendency to have little to no genuinely useful information, the number of times that an 'abduction' has turned out to be a misunderstanding or simple custody dispute, and the *multiple* followup uses of the same **emergency** system to repeat the same thing in French or to simply **cancel** the alert has led to them [disabling and/or ignoring the alerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue) (as it was [widely predicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alert_Ready#Reception) that it would) and that they're now honestly concerned that they would miss something genuinely relevant to them whether they receive the alert or not, would you simply continue to roll your eyes and dismiss that as ""selfish, lazy people acting cranky about getting woken up""? Somehow, I get the impression that you would, because all those examples and more are posted all up and down *every* post about this *every* time an alert is sent out, and you'd have to already have been deliberately ignoring them if you've been paying any attention at all.

Here's an easy-to-read [article describing the Daylight Savings thing](https://www.businessinsider.com/daylight-saving-time-is-deadly-2018-3) that you so presumptuously dismissed as 'trolling', by the way.

Your fatalism and disregard for reality speaks volumes on the thought process behind this system, if you truly were personally involved in its development. Did anyone ever consider revising the implementation or testing public reaction to it in advance of finalizing it, or was it just unquestioningly rammed through right from the start?"
