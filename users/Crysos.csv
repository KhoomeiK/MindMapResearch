todayilearned,ff68wvu,t1_ff5xpko,1579621898.0,Jokes and laughs are how I hide crippling depression and anxiety. I know that being depressed and a nervous wreck isn't fun to be around. Making other people laugh is a great way to hide the black cloud from   others and even yourself for a few hours.

Jaws,feciuwd,t3_eocsbc,1578974980.0,When I was really young my family lived in Massachusetts. We used to take the ferry to Martha's vineyard when the weather was nice. There was a tour that took you to the filming locations. It was pretty neat but I wasn't old enough to really appreciate it.
AdviceAnimals,fdpes88,t3_emi7g5,1578626768.0,"A few years ago we had an elderly neighbor and her name was Gertrude or Trudy for short. She was super sweet and an all around awesome neighbor. She fucking hated the name Gertrude. She would always joke and make my wife promise not to use the name Gertrude when we had kids. She said it always made her feel like ""an old fuddy duddy""."
AskReddit,fdngf3i,t3_em2vfz,1578585259.0,"As a kid my siblings and I weren't allowed to shower if it looked like it was going to storm out or currently storming. They didn't want us to get struck by lightning. I remember after a baseball game I had change into clean clothes and sit on a beach towel until I was allowed to shower. It sucked, covered in dirt and sweat and starting to itch.

Also when it stormed we had to watch TV as a family in the basement because of a threat of a tornado killing us all. We lived just outside of Pittsburgh not tornado ally. It's no suprise that I have the irrational anxiety."

narcissisticparents,fdkq32z,t3_eldh9x,1578508797.0,Yeah this hits hard. Grew up in a house where my parents should have gotten divorced ages before they did. Cause they were miserable I was supposed to be too. The amount of times I was told that no one would ever love me is too much. I wasn't allowed to date because all women were whores that would leave me heartbroken. Or that I would be a cheating sack of shit like my father. This is 15 years ago and I still have these arguments burned into my fucking skull. And they wonder why I don't respond to their sappy vomit inducing messages. I always feel like a burden even though I am well liked.

todayilearned,fc9b42v,t1_fc87o4f,1577549934.0,I grew up in Pittsburgh and have met Mr Rogers and some of the other cast members. They were/are genuinely the nicest people ever. Another really cool fact is that George A Romero got his start in the entertainment industry through Mr Roger's neighborhood. So zombies as we know them today (not the voodoo zombies) can tangentially be linked to Mr Roger's neighborhood as well.

AmItheAsshole,fbyerlr,t1_fbydn40,1577215071.0,"I have been no contact for a a few years. It just sucks around the holidays. I haven't proclaimed that I'm not talking to them I just don't respond or read their texts. My wife is great and we do spend our time together. Her family has their own issues mainly being super, gay hating religious and we are ""filthy liberals"" according to her uncle. I am looking forward to tomorrow because we were able to afford a nice Christmas just for us. It's been a while since there were gifts under the tree."
AmItheAsshole,fbybzsp,t1_fbyb012,1577213110.0,The thing is it still eats me up inside. I want to have my parents in my life. I have done a lot of soul searching and I'm tired of being angry at them nothing productive comed from anger. I know that my mom and dad are hurt by this and I do miss them. I am tired of the disappointment. I still feel like the asshole because my sister told me both my mom and dad talk about me constantly during the holidays.
AmItheAsshole,fbyas16,t3_ef52p7,1577212258.0,TLDR I am no contact from my family for multiple reasons. I have tried to rebuild a relationship on the condition that the past stays in the past. That hasn't happened and I am done. My sister has rose tinted glasses because I protected her from the worst and she was really young. She thinks I am the asshole for not being in their lives.
