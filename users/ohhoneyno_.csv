Advice,fefuju8,t3_eoxi2w,1579065654.0,"I’d say that your concerns are valid.
That your partner is not a partner; but a dictator who is selfish and demands time and care but doesn’t reciprocate. By not introducing you to her parents, I would say that she doesn’t see you as a serious partner because if she did she would - a.) want you to be in your hypothetical baby’s life and b.) introduce you to her parents. I think that her unwillingness to compromise her time to fulfill your needs and desires should show you that this isn’t going to work out in the long run so it’s tome to forget about her and move on even if you still love her."

SeriousConversation,fefjoah,t3_eoumdy,1579057741.0,"I have the same type of relationship you had with your mom growing up and I’m terrified that I’ll have that acceptance and closure on her deathbed too, but I think that I’m trying to accept it now with therapy and coping mechanisms so it doesn’t kill me later on in life (though I know it’ll still hurt). I don’t have any real advice for you other than to be happy for what you have for while you have it. This is the time for forgiveness if you wish to give it. This is a new chapter, a better chapter with your mom even if it’s a time sensitive one. I would invest in a therapist to cope and also look into healthy coping mechanisms and make sure to make time for them."
KindVoice,febwjmt,t3_eocpqb,1578963520.0,"Sometimes you have to go through a lot of shitty ass therapists to find the right one. I met my new therapist last week and had I gone on first impressions, I would have gone to another therapists, but today, I brought my service dog in training along and asked if I could sit on the floor with him during our session and she told me not only was it okay, but that she would sit with us. I automatically felt more comfortable with her and our session went so much more smoother than last time. I’m really happy to have her as my therapist now.

TLDR: not all therapists are bad and sometimes you have to try out a ton of them before you find yourself a good one."

I was afraid to continue the loop because I didn’t think we would finish before dark and we were not prepared for a night hike/it was our first time there/it would be just too easy to get seriously hurt or lost there.

And I’m telling you now, you are wrong here. You can’t expect your partner to automatically become poly because you are. You went into the relationship with the understanding that it was a monogamous relationship and she at no point agreed to a poly one. In fact, you should be thrilled that she even still wants to be with you and wants to work with you after you told her that you’d like to open the relationship up. You can’t force polyamory on someone no matter how many posts you tag them in, no matter how many articles you have them read, no matter how much you ask them to research. Some people are simply monogamous, some people are poly, and some people are somewhere inbetween. But, no, you’re in the wrong here. She didn’t sign up for a poly relationship and you asking her to educate herself in hopes that she will change her mind is selfish and wrong. Find yourself a polyamorous partner."

What I suggest? Forgive them. They don’t need to apologize to forgive them. Forgiveness isn’t for the other party, most of the time. I’d even venture to say that often times, forgiveness is selfish. Forgive them because it isn’t fair to *you* to hold on to the hurt/anger/sadness. Forgive them so *you* can move on and be happy. At the end of the day, they don’t believe they were in the wrong; so all of this hurt inside of you? It’s only effecting and damaging you, not them. They have probably forgotten about it by now.

Advice,fczvgk0,t3_ejqtyw,1578109296.0,"The reason people tell you to stay in school is because once you start making money, you usually don’t want to go back to school and being broke all the time - that’s the gods honest truth. I took a “gap year” for three years because I liked working. So, I mean; you’re not wrong for being hard on yourself for taking the tome off of school, but just be realistic with yourself. Are you really only going to take one year off? What does it mean to you if you don’t? Are you open to changing your life plans? Things to consider."
Advice,fczumw6,t3_ejqusf,1578108898.0,"I don’t think that there is a route you can go without something legal happening first whether it being CPS or the cops, someone’s getting called. And don’t be ashamed about how you feel. You shouldn’t feel like you *have* to feel a certain way. You don’t have to feel angry. You have a right to be sad. Maybe you’ve already forgiven him because it helped you heal and so you don’t want to ruin his life because he’s still your brother? Maybe you’re just a super kind and caring person? I would say, if the family can afford it; hire a nanny so that the brother is no longer with the niece and nephew alone."

Advice,fczfand,t3_ejoy87,1578099975.0,Everyone has different ways that they act in different situations. I think who you are with your family is more telling of the “real you” because it’s the rawest form which needs to be addressed. I would say you should seek out the help of a therapist to get to the bottom of this behavior before you have a family and take it out on your wife and kids.
