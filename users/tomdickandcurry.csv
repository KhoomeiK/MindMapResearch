Go for a run or lift super heavy weights- whatever you prefer but make sure you do something productive to make yourself feel better. I would let my one day binge drag to 2, then a few weeks and sometimes months- just don't be like me!! One day is NOTHING in the grand scheme of things! Make sure you get a good workout in tomorrow to get back on track. Good luck!!"

Think before you speak and be concise ffs. This is an ensemble interview not your own personal podcast. That coupled with her accent makes her genuinely difficult to listen to."
