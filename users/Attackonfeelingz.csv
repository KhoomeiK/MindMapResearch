If any money is left after that then I’ll just save it or donate it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fexcjmo,t3_eqovtn,1579428663.0,My parents must have not gotten the memo. They still bully me and will till the day I die.
relationship_advice,fexcdqi,t3_eqr15p,1579428569.0,"Often times people find things weird because they genuinely can’t understand it. Maybe you should sit down and explain to her why you’re hanging out with him (explain the kids situation as much as you can, if possible) till she understands. I don’t really find this behavior weird unless you were doing something weird together? Idk why your girlfriend find it weird either but have her also explain why she thinks it’s so weird till you also understand where she’s coming from, maybe she just wants go spend more time with you and bond but can’t because he’s always with you??? Idk I don’t live hour life but just try to get why you’re both feeling weird about this."

AskReddit,feutlxr,t3_eqies2,1579389757.0,"Me and 5 of my cousins all experienced something when we were little that we still talk about today. We had been playing hide and go seek in the dark in my grandmas garage and we were on our second game when we all noticed a shining blue ball of bright light. We were all crepes out because yes we had a toy that was a character from the Avatar movie (the blue people) but it was only activated when someone was talking. None of us were talking and none of us were hiding near where the light was coming from. We all got freaked out because we all vividly remember playing with it outside and leaving it outside. Nobody brought it into the garage and nobody was talking to activate the light. We all got up and ran back outside to see if the Avatar you was missing from outside. We found it on a chair outside when in theory if the bright light had been that toy it should’ve been inside the garage, but nope. It was outside on the chair and not inside the garage, till this day we still can’t figure out what happened. Nobody had a copy of the toy and none of us brought it into the garage or took it back outside if it had been in the garage.
It’s almost like it transported from one place to another and it really scared us."
college,fencyfb,t3_eps7yi,1579282025.0,"That is pretty odd. I wouldn’t brush it off if I were you. By nature we usually say “that was weird” and don’t report behavior like this and let if get out of hand. I really hope your professor, you, or one of the students reported it to someone higher up in the education department. By the time you’re in college you need to be acting like an adult and especially in class. I would report him so that not only will you guys be safe, but he’ll get the help he needs. Maybe he’s having some mental issues and hasn’t got help for it yet. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. No person in college confidently asks a professor a sexual question like that and should get away with it."
AskReddit,feg7zy1,t3_eou6il,1579081383.0,"As a kid I always wished everyone was nice to each other. It’s a bit childish but I still would wish for it today. 

When I was younger I always saw a lot of people and adults in general were unnecessarily mean or rude. I’ve always tried to be very understanding and let as many things go as I could instead of staying mad over the little things. If I could just make people live a bit of a happier life I’d be happy."
iKON,feg7r8w,t3_eosjp8,1579081039.0,"Ugh where to even start hahaha, I love probably love Rhythm TA the most but my other favorites are Anthem, B-Day, Bling Bling, My Type, and Dumb & Dumber. I’ve been a fan for a long time and I’m always listening to their music, iKON will always be a in my list of top music artists."
college,feadrar,t1_feacrql,1578947408.0,"In that case then I’d just buy it after the first day, but it wouldn’t hurt to buy books before school starts if you’re more comfortable with that idea. I just like to save money where I can and try not to buy textbooks I don’t need."
college,feacck0,t3_eo938q,1578946942.0,"I guess it depends on how the school is run or the teachers but I always wait for after the first day of each class. I’ve had books that are on the syllabus and are marked as required but once I go to class on the first day they’ll say that it’s not necessary and that it’s more or a suggestion. Sometimes books are actually required and sometimes they’re just for extra help. I do recommend though that if it’s a class that is part of your major that you just go ahead and buy it, all information pertaining to your major is important (even if it’s suggested and not required)."
college,feabb98,t3_eo8ga9,1578946572.0,"Idk if this is even going to help, but I’m in the same position as you. I have really bad depression and College has been making it worse and worse to where I felt like I was in my worst mindset I had ever been in all of my life last semester but somehow I pulled through. It still feels like I’m trying to run in waist deep mud but at least I’m not buried up to my shoulders yet. What I do to get me out of that funk (even if for a temporary few minutes at least) is to think about how much other people around the world would kill to go to school and have an education to make money and support themselves or their family. It’s really cheesy but you really have to actually think about how real it is that people out there can’t be in the same position as us and will maybe never be able to have a good life. I try really hard to make an effort to not let my laziness and depression conquer me. I’m alive and breathing and have all my limbs which is more than what some people have in this world. I try and watch a lot of cheesy inspiring YouTube videos (like videos of people being amazing and helping on another) so I can start to at least put myself in a positive mindset. Sorry that this is all the advice I can give you, but know that you’re not alone and that a lot of us are trying to fight feeling like this. If you can, maybe talk to a therapist or a friend about how you’re feeling. Good luck, I’m fighting these feelings along side you! (Sorry for the rant hahaha)"

It’s awkward but what can ya do."
AskReddit,fdmstac,t3_em2vfz,1578564036.0,"My parents were super strict and controlling in some ways. I wasn’t allowed to sleep over at anybody’s house except for my grandmas (not even cousins or other family members) and I wasn’t allowed to go out with them if I didn’t get permission first. My mom always had to know if one of my aunts wanted to take me out to shop or eat with them and a lot of the time she’d say no so I’d sit at my grandmas house alone while everyone else got to go shop and eat. 

And she wonders why I’m not a social person and hate leaving the house. It was kind of ingrained in me because of her and my dad. I literally get anxiety over doing normal everyday things, I hate it."
nottheonion,fdms0o9,t3_em3poy,1578562906.0,"It’s like trusting a handshake on a deal. Could they stick to what you agreed on? Yes but also no. It’s the risk you take when you confess such a big crime.

I think doing the right thing is what matters most. Come on! That is a child!!! No mother in the right mind would ever stand by the idea that the confession should’ve been kept a secret just because the husband admitted it to the church and they took it to the police. A crime is a crime, sorry.
Plus the husband probably confessed because it was eating at him and he just wanted to get rid of the guilt. Just confessing will not get rid of your actions or get rid of the guilt. Maybe God (or whatever you believe in) is putting you through this time in prison for you to reflect and repent for your sin and get better. Just my personal opinion."
