depression,fefw4ug,t3_eor2wz,1579067135.0,I spend so much time thinking about my friends too. Wondering if they care about how am I doing. Or if they are better off with me. I can’t help but think they don’t care for me. And that their lives are so much better than mine. It’s very annoying that we think this way.
