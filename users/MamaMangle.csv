TrueOffMyChest,fe8vax6,t3_eo3m0z,1578931393.0,"I think the problem is on both you and them. You can't practise or imitate empathy. You either have it already or through some kind of learning experience, gain it after something profound happens. And people can sense that in a person. It sounds like you only want into their pants with the way you've written this. You're also clearly going for the wrong kind of girls. My boyfriend is exactly as weird and fantastical as me just brimming over with imagination and we have heaps to talk about. He's also very in touch with his feelings and the feelings of others. 

So the advice I'd normally give would be to stop looking and focus on yourself. Love is like a wild animal..you can't persue it because it will always run away. You have to be gentle, be kind and be *trustworthy and understanding*. Stop pretending you give a fuck and learn how to not only be interested in others, but be interesting yourself. Hobbies and interests, films, games, tv...folklore and belief systems, philosophy and the bigger picture..art and music. There's so much out there.

So I would strongly suggest not looking for love right now and instead learn how to be alone without being lonely. A lot of successful couples will say the same thing - that their partner kinda dropped out of nowhere. We tend to find a real genuine person when we're happy with ourselves, happy with our lives etc..when you can say you love yourself as a person, you can love another. So I'd learn to be genuine because by being an asshole, you'll only attract shit."

It can't be that bad"". But since I met my boyfriend and was tested and diagnosed with autism, I find my family who always thought I was faking everything to suddenly go all ""if you need anything let us know"". I don't need SHIT from them. My mum and boyfriend understand and are *actually* there for me, trying everything they can to help.

I attract broken people and I try to fix them up as best I can..I do my very best to help people..and after a lifetime of being shunned and excluded..now I'm the mother figure to a group of troubled late teens who've changed my life.

He's 12 years younger than me, but we match up perfectly in our mental ages..emotionally and mentally I'm younger than him, as I have autism and a whole host of issues and ailments that have sent every other of my partners running. Depression, severe anxiety, ptsd, bipolar, arrested development, sciatica, cluster headaches and migraines, severe insomnia...I could go on.

I'm somebody who needs a lot of love, patience and gentle handling. I cry all the time. At first, he was stubborn, refused to admit when he was wrong and held me accountable for things that just weren't my fault. I remember thinking it was all happening again..but there was a voice in me that whispered not to give up. To teach him about autism and other things, to be patient and show him all the love and kindness I had. We never fought when we were together, only apart. Circumstances changed and he had to emergency move out of his grandparents due to his nan abusing him. Now we're inseparable.. we miss each other like crazy when he's away even just for a few hours and we recharge just sitting near one another.

He's my primary carer and the sweetest, kindest and most selfless guy I've ever met. Always putting others first, even strangers. He's so gentle and loving..I feel I don't deserve the way he looks at me. I've never seen a look like it..his beautiful blue eyes just gaze at me, and that smile.. even after 4 years it makes my heart flutter, my stomach flip and my head go weird..hehe. He's always working long hours and very hard, even at work he does things outside of his workload to help his colleagues. He'll clean  and restock the entire bar so the morning staff won't have to do it. He cooks for me, helps me up or just walk in general. 

He's tall, slim and feminine but straight. Gorgeous blue eyes and floppy sideswept hair and a beautiful smile. And me, short, overweight with next to no teeth, more rolls than a bread factory and I just lay in bed like a seal. But there he is, gazing at me with the most love I've ever seen. A medium told me that our souls are already married, and I believe that. He holds me when I'm scream-sobbing from flashbacks or anxiety attacks and can stop most attacks or autism meltdowns before they start spiralling. 

He cares for me more than himself, is endlessly patient and kind. He listens to me when I'm babbling about my interests and we both listen to each other and are actually interested in learning all about each other's interests. He knows most of the names from my little pony and remembers the lessons taught in the episodes. I am secretly learning about pokemon so I can talk to him about the thing he treasures. We have shared interests like Steven universe, doctor who and the walking dead, have made characters for those universes and we spend hours brainstorming about our stories and characters, building entire world's together. We game together, watch YouTube, or do our own thing while talking about all kinds of topics. He's weird like me and so completely unique. Beautiful, precious and one of a kind..I feel in my heart we're gonna grow old together. 

We were written in the stars, and he's the brightest and the one that sparkles and shines more than all of them. We complete each other, compliment each other and look after each other, and our love will persevere even when our bodies are dust. My soul mate, my life, my love.
