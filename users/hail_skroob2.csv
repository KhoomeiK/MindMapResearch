dankmemes,fe7mcut,t1_fe7fqox,1578916426.0,"Well, i am somewhat of a Rock expert and i can tell you he's an actor, investor, and a retired pro wrestler. He was born in 1972, he played football at the University of Miami until 1995 when he tried to enter the nfl draft. He went undrafted so he began his training for pro wrestling. 

In 1996 he signed a contract with the WWF and was said to be a prominent member of the ""Attitude Era"" in wrestling. Nowadays he's in every movie ever made. Hope this helped."
