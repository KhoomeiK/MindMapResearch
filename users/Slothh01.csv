Idk ab dog smell proof though"

StonerEngineering,ffabgkq,t1_ff9zvgi,1579731634.0,Eh. Could be. No way to truly tell how much it weighs without OP
u_mushroomman666,ffab6ot,t3_eq7u8c,1579731474.0,31 :) Heres a fact about my dog. We've got her kennel awfully close to her food and water bowl because of space issues and if we get her excited to go outside before coaxing her out slowly she just gets up as fast as she can and runs right over both bowls. Food and water goes everywhere and its adorably infuriating each time I forget!
gaming,ffa6qoe,t1_ff9c6wx,1579728962.0,A friend of mine did this with Madden Mobile when i was still in high school. I believe he spent over $300. His parents made him work to make up for the cash and then he also had some privileges taken away for some number of months
NolanBatmanMemes,ffa0uc5,t1_ff8dtj6,1579725610.0,Yeah. A few friends and I got drunk and tried to do the theater mods one day on 360 a few months ago and its still miserably easy. Shame as the three of us spent way too much time on bo2 back in the day. Sucks to see the game in this state.
StonerEngineering,ff9zrsn,t1_ff9jz0o,1579724982.0,It looks closer to 1-1.5 to me from first glance

RDR2,ff92my0,t1_ff9104n,1579703332.0,Same. I used to do the button combo to turn off golden guns every time when i played rdr1
RedDeadOnline,ff4hiik,t1_ff3stb3,1579563746.0,"I make my Arthur eat all the time for his health but he looks normal I think. I haven’t really looked hard enough. This is a feature I was not expecting them to bring into this game, since I don’t really remember it happening in R* games besides San Andreas."
gtaonline,feujkm0,t1_fetzr55,1579387145.0,"A friend and I are grinding businesses/bunker right now and playing missions like we did back when we were in middle school and we’re graduated now. This game, man. It’s such a wonderful experience"
gtaonline,fetdsxw,t1_fesy0zo,1579374338.0,Same thing happened in cod where they left old school physics on for certain game modes in Modern Warfare Remastered. Really neat when they throw those throwback physics into modes but that bike flying glitch was just fun. Shame they tried to patch it to begin with
treedibles,fes3xty,t3_eqh0re,1579361137.0,"How strong is each one? So jealous, there are never bags of small edibles around my area like that

RedDeadOnline,feqycwa,t1_fepu3w8,1579347434.0,They always did that in gta. Every little fun thing you weren’t supposed to do got patched from opening the back of the titan to the original red parking garage wall breach

AmItheAsshole,fekucgf,t3_epjirr,1579207774.0,"NTA, OP. But I’d love to give you something to think about. I spent my 18th birthday in rehab with no contact to my family or girlfriend. It went just fine. It was hard as hell, but I came out of that place a better person whether I wanted to admit it or not. Don’t let your kid manipulate you anymore. Get him into juvenile in-patient. Theyre not all only for kids with charges. The one I went to spent so much time working on mental health. The place had its flaws, but it gave me time to work on myself. Your son sounds like he needs it bad. I don’t think what’s wrong with him is something you or your wife can control."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feknmf8,t1_feknbmp,1579203800.0,"Seeing it like that, I agree 100% now. I wouldn’t want to have Jubilee’s future happiness jeopardized for a feel good story"
AskReddit,fekne2c,t1_fekl95z,1579203660.0,Well this is fascinating actually. A quick search tells me Paradox made both the HoI series as well as the Victoria series. Has paradox been running the strategy genre themselves?
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekmay2,t1_fekln4i,1579203013.0,"I wanna argue with these dog laws but they’re just protecting the dog in case it doesn’t work out. Good on them, but shame for specialty cases like Jubilee."
RainbowSixSiegePS4,feklni9,t1_fcy5loh,1579202623.0,I bought the year 1 edition with a friend on sale in November and we had only yr 1 operators. His first 20k went to Mira and my first 20k went to the defaults :)
RainbowSixSiegePS4,fekl0qf,t1_fejqni4,1579202249.0,"I get plenty of silent and party games, but typically when I get a good team it’s not hard to talk to them and have them party up for a few more. Kids sound ridiculous in this game when they teamkill and then call you out for offensive language. Toxicity is a whole separate level from other games I’ve put time into."
dankmemes,fekkbde,t1_fejstct,1579201836.0,I was 18 when they changed the law on me and I’m still resentful for the lack of the grandfather clause in my state. Went from walking into the gas station myself to buy cigs to just walking in with my dad or uncle instead. Just another bullshit workaround for what I’m already doing anyway
AskReddit,fekjy6t,t1_fek1z29,1579201619.0,I heard this too while I was looking into HoI specifically. Does one of the HoI games receive more general praise for being better than the others?
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekjqam,t1_fekjhca,1579201485.0,"I’m sure there’s some actual logical reason for that, but it sure doesn’t sound reasonable. Someone driving 400+ miles for this weird dog that’s already seen social media coverage might even get news involved for a feel good story. I don’t know how it’d be bad for Husky House or Jubilee, but I’m just speculating."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekhph2,t1_fekf9fk,1579200272.0,"Just read above that not a lot of apps have been sent in despite the overwhelming support from social medias for Jubilee.

AskReddit,fek08v1,t1_fejrr86,1579189825.0,I remember looking into these games a while back when I was on a PC war games kick. They look so insanely complicated I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve always been pretty miserable at strategy though.
RedDeadOnline,fejzrmb,t1_fejzirp,1579189529.0,I’m on ps4 and assuming this is on pc specifically. That looks totally gamebreaking and disappointing wow. I prefer higher brightness in shooters as it is but this is a little much

RainbowSixSiegePS4,fejqeh4,t3_epjisk,1579183205.0,"I don’t know why teamkilling in general is such a staple of the negativity in this game. I played over 1500 hours of csgo and teamkilling happened, but most games you had a mutual understanding that both parties in an argument wanted to win. This game is just wild man"
RedDeadOnline,fejls4h,t1_fej3x36,1579179205.0,I’d love to see what you’re talking about. I haven’t experienced this glitch

gtaonline,fdm8s0f,t1_fdm5o3z,1578542629.0,Most spots have been accessible platform-wide since GTA V launched. There’s two at the airport. A few hangers to the right of the titan hanger at the airport is this cool one with three access points. Great for holding out cops. Other one is by the helicopter spawns as soon as you jump the dumpster ramp. There’s one by the clothing store up in grape seed. There’s the mine/tunnel in the hills. There’s probably videos that go into great details on YouTube. I’ve had more fun with glitches and hidden areas in this game than I did with any other.

RDR2,fdi68zl,t3_elfmy9,1578436464.0,Gf got me the game for Christmas and we’ve been binging it together and loving it. Saint Denis is the industrial southern town right? I pissed off so many of those factory worker guys there and ended up having to fight off like 10 with a knife. Killed like 6 before I had to start sprinting through those alleys pushing people away and evading police. This game is such a rush in free roam I love it

trees,fbxvs48,t1_fbxuy8s,1577201799.0,"I agree with this wholeheartedly. I’ve been trying to become less mentally reliant on weed these last few months. I wish weed was already legal so I could find low potency weed for cheaper. The strong stuff is fucking amazing don’t get me wrong, but I wanna smoke a few joints and just feel nice but still be able to think straight. I’m sure once I have more control in my day to day life, I’ll stray back to the escape that high potency strains give."

When it comes to silver and gold and platinum, I know they’re ranks, but is there anything I can compare them to from another game like cs to get an idea where I’m rly at?"
