thatHappened,ff9s75x,t1_ff9s0s1,1579720053.0,Thank you for the experienced insight! Thats all very interesting. I can see how the smaller details laypeople dont really know about make all this seem fake.
thatHappened,ff9qfg0,t1_ff9qccc,1579718687.0,Yeah but it doesnt cover the whole face. I dont know the whole situation but all im saying is that it isnt entirely outlandish

socialanxiety,fey52c8,t3_eqp7y4,1579440891.0,"I get this too and i feel like it was also imposed on me by my parents. They would tell me things like that people with anxiety/depression have ""real problems"" and nothings ever happened to me and I've gad a good life and therefore im clearly just faking it for attention.

Even though its gotten to a crippling degree (I've missed work, I've quit jobs, im struggling to even just get my license) I cant always admit that it really is that bad. There are people who have it so much worse and my problems will never be greater than theirs and i feel like it invalidates me."
MadeOfStyrofoam,feveva0,t3_eqpl88,1579396561.0,"If someone has to tell you that you have a loving mother, you probably don't.
Edit to say that it can really go either way from this post, but she should not feel like she has to tell you that. You dont owe your parents anything for birthing you, or raising you. They were legally obligated to raise you and the birth wasnt your choice so don't let people manipulate it like that."

socialanxiety,feok929,t3_epjf4u,1579301365.0,Thats awesome. I just got prescribed beta blockers and i cant wait to try them but im hoping i can get something higher strength. I dont have a psychiatrist or a long term doctor so im thinking more than likely I'll either have to go through the low strength options before i can get up to something like Xanax or I'll find something that works a long the way

insanepeoplefacebook,fdw7fdk,t1_fdsbk3i,1578755888.0,"Depending on your personal trust of medical staff, your personal wishes (if they were violated by said medical staff) and your past history with, say, general intrusions on your bodily autonomy (abusive partner, sexual assault, shit/abusive parents) I can see how they might think that way, even though its a stretch.

Its less about comparing the trauma to the trauma one might receive in a traumatic rape, more about that loss of bodily autonomy and will to someone who you're supposedly supposed to trust."
softwaregore,fdu0ve7,t1_fdt5nsn,1578725518.0,"Former employee, I can confirm with certainty that its a doordash order. Its the confirmation code used when they approach us to ask about the order. Either that or some other 3rd party service, depending on the country.

Kind of annoying to see this every other week on here haha but i understand the misunderstandings"

socialanxiety,fdmeo5o,t3_em2zua,1578547421.0,"Not sure where you live, but in the US, fast food is actually great for my social anxiety, at least while I work on my degree.

I got hired at a local chain working grill and making sandwiches. Unfortunately I have a ton of customer service experience so I might end up with customers sometimes, but im also really good at assembling sandwiches and time management, which makes me good in the kitchen so when i applied I requested a kitchen position.

I totally get where you're coming from though- at my old job, people really disliked me, and even though i was a manager, I got bullied by a crew member into leaving that job after a mental breakdown where I quit before my shift started same-day.

Id really recommend therapy. I'm trying to get some myself, if you're in college there's all kinds of free life counselors available that can help, and there are therapists who are sliding scale, meaning the less you make, the less they charge"

As for the illness part, yeah that makes sense. I used to work with a man who was homeless, which is a small step down from living in shelter with no utilities (where I live anyway, where summers are 110Â° and winters are 15Â°, at their worst that is) and it always seemed kike he had some affliction or another."

Going off of your scenario of the apartment costing $800, thats $100 for... Everything. Electricity, internet, water will eat away at that bill faster than the mold that grows on your walls because you cant afford to run a dehumidifier.

I know you aren't disagreeing with me, but I just felt the need to point out the inaccuracies, like the idea that working 40 hrs a week would build up a terrible fatigue but that's the normal working week for hundreds of thousands of people who are just fine"

No thanks."
