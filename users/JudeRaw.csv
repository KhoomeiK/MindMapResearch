Our dogs were good at showing them our fields was off limits but they still poked around if they felt they could get away with it.
ThatsInsane,ffaofdr,t1_ffam0x4,1579740726.0,No. They will snatch your small dog if they think they can. Right out of your leash in broad daylight even. Any dogs 3-20lbs should have a ton of vigilance in an area with known coyotes. Basically anything larger then a cat is only of they really think they can get it or at night alone. All dogs tethered to something will probably at least be tried. Coyotes are savages.

funny,fdwb05x,t1_fdvu3mr,1578756905.0,What's your point? This comment is redundant under mine. Either take the example or don't lol a disparity is a disparity whether it's no income or 12% less. Nobody takes half (your) things. Most people dont understand that when they buy something in marriage both of you bought it and anything you brought in unless it's a large ticket is also merged and even then many large ticket items get absorbed (save your receipts people)
funny,fdwa5jo,t1_fdvw744,1578756630.0,You are wrong. You aren't taking Everything into account and probably didn't consider what you were doing or buying or allowing in terms of assets within the marriage. Everyone got a story.
funny,fdw9roh,t1_fdvw9j1,1578756529.0,Doubt what you considered yours and what was actually both of yours was different. The fact is it isn't the 80's and the era of the housewife is basically over. Courts have become ridiculously fair in terms of asset allocation.
funny,fdw9isy,t1_fdvyoxp,1578756440.0,That's not taking the whole thing Into account. If she got custody of kids then that seems right. Kids cost money.  Sounds like your dad is spinning a sop story though. She got an extra 10% and a building that will cost her money woo.

funny,fdvs2h4,t1_fdvqpr2,1578750912.0,"That's not how that works. If you get a wife and tell her she doesn't have to work and she has no income or whatever then you are likely to have to split what you may consider ""your"" assets. However if your wife works and you guys have lives apart from eachother you are probably not going to do anything but split large assets. As a female you are not just simply entitled to 50% of someone's shit. That's ridiculous."
