Denver,fcxtso8,t1_fcxqhcc,1578070329.0,"Nowhere in the public transportation syllabi does it say must have light for bus driver to stop. Besides were paying for a service. So I do expect to get to point A to point B. If I get an Uber and get them to pick me up, and when they gets to me, they skip over me and drives on. I won’t be paying for the Uber and I’ll likely get a free ride next time. We can both give extreme comparisons it’s ok."

Denver,fcxmc71,t1_fcxl5lc,1578066380.0,"Def have used a bus for and have owned bus passes for years at a time. Outside of standing at the stop and putting myself out there to be seen, it’s no longer in my responsibility to do anything more to get a bus to stop. Yes I could use a flashlight, awesome idea. But that’s not acquired of me to catch the bus as the stop the bus driver is supposed to check for me at. Bus drivers in my area, have the same routine, they know where the majority of people get on at on the route, and off. They still slow down and visibly check the other stops. Me waiting an extra 5 mins here or there will never kill me. The bus driver has a hard job, picking people up etc etc. patience is a virtue. But I don’t agree with the OP post."
