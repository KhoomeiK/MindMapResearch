Active training everyday in a club maybe, but you will have time for home workouts for sure, especially if you get rid of your surfing habits. You might also go playing ball on the weekends if you want. 

Of course take it slowly and don't push yourself over your limit. I started of with daily walks too a year ago and went jogging and ballin in the summer - despite being the biggest couch potato ever. It can be hard to start new things but it will be rewarding maybe not in an instant but later on.
