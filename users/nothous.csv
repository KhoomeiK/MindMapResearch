BringMeTheHorizon,feh2zf4,t1_feh0n2q,1579108071.0,"thats how i feel about CYB and earlier. i’ve tried really hard, but it’s painful to listen to oli scream the way he does before SS. i really love the instrumental music, but the vocals are what put me off. i started listening to BMTH a little after sempiternal was released and i thought i didn’t like their old stuff at first. it just sounded like “noise” to me, as you put it.

what helped me begin to like TIAH and SS a lot more was listening to the whole album with a completely open mind. try not to judge what you’re listening to and try to find bits that you like. if you try and find that you still don’t like it, that’s okay! you can try listening again in a couple weeks or months and you might find things that you didn’t appreciate before. 

it’s also entirely possible that it just *isn’t your thing* and thats totally okay. for new fans, it seems sometimes there’s a bit of pressure to like all their music, but i think that’s kind of bullshit because their style has changed so much over the years. i would never in a million years expect everyone who discovered BMTH through GO TO or even TTS to fall in love with CYB. some do, but to expect most people to is so unrealistic. like i said, even i can’t stand the vocals on CYB and EOYS. 

in the end, it’s all up to you. for you, maybe nothing is missing. maybe you’ll find that you really do like it. maybe you’ll appreciate it, but it won’t be your favorite. maybe it will always just sound like noise. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
BringMeTheHorizon,fegxn99,t1_fegx0ek,1579104819.0,"no problem! for a long time i thought i didn’t like TIAH either, but really i just needed to keep listening all the way through the songs. i would listen to the first 30 seconds or skip around and make instant judgements before even listening to the whole song. now it’s one of my favorite albums of theirs and i always like to listen to the whole thing from start to finish :)"
BringMeTheHorizon,fegwx97,t1_fegwp0n,1579104364.0,"i think the best way to listen to TIAH is from start to finish and don’t stop listening, even if you think you don’t like it."
