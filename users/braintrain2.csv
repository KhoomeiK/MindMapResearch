insomnia,fcyimue,t3_ej8clz,1578080661.0,"The more exhausted  I am the less I sleep because then I become fixed with getting sleep and the anxiety makes me sleep less and the cycle continues. Then again, my sleep issues are highly connected with my anxiety disorder"
insomnia,fcyi53b,t3_ej5bv7,1578080565.0,"Not for me. It actually revs me up even when I‚Äôm exhausted, therefore I only workout in the morning or early afternoon"
bipolar,fconzks,t3_ei6wov,1577837023.0,"I‚Äôm embarrassed 100% of the time. I find every facet of my being embarrassing. I talk to much, I‚Äôm awkward, I over share when anxious, and probably look like an all around loser."
bipolar2,fcobeai,t3_ehd4h5,1577828117.0,"Hey you know what I say? I say do you!! There are certainly way worse and more destructive things you could do while manic. A piercing is fun, and not permanent so enjoy!! Just take good care of it while you‚Äôre healing :)"
Winnipeg,fcm4pzr,t3_ehuthx,1577764186.0,This has just been proven now?
bipolar,fcm0lae,t1_fckqfpa,1577761111.0,Wow thank you so much üôè
bipolar,fckiwvz,t1_fcjmrzp,1577726330.0,Hi I really appreciate the response and it makes me feel some comfort to know I‚Äôm not alone in all this confusion and questioning. I believe my psychiatrist 100% has my best interests at heart because she believes wholeheartedly in her chosen profession. I actually have only recently started to see a psychologist for therapy due to it being $200 an hour and out of reach I won‚Äôt be going often enough but we are going to start addressing some of those root issues that my anxieties and fears were based on. I wish this had started when I was young. Thanks again and I hope you too can find more answers. I think somethings are just going to remain unknown in our lifetimes
bipolar,fckihw7,t1_fci8h3z,1577726070.0,"I‚Äôm afraid it might make me cast even more doubt on medicine and psychiatry... I didn‚Äôt purposely seek out anti psychiatry information, I kind stumbled across it while reading up on psychiatry in general. My first questions were really about pathologizing every human emotion and personality/coping skills that ‚Äúbother‚Äù society. And tried to stop before going to much further down the rabbit hole. Is it an anti psychiatry book or neutral or both?"
bipolar,fcki9vy,t1_fciv7wz,1577725933.0,"Thank you for your response. It‚Äôs very helpful to hear people who have been or in the same situation I‚Äôve been in to reassure me they have found psychiatry helpful. I‚Äôm not sure it has for me. I wonder if I went off my meds, and I mean really cleared my body out and did a hard reset would I be okay with some therapy alone? I know I need them to knock me out at night but is it a dependence thing? Talking to folks about all perspectives on here is very insightful because I can‚Äôt ask my doctor this stuff as I obviously know her stance and she is truly trying to help me. Thanks again and I am glad you are in a better place."
bipolar,fckhx22,t1_fcif1fk,1577725710.0,Thank you. I do believe my anxiety is far beyond what a normal person would have over the same things and it is extremely disruptive to my life but I wonder if it‚Äôs from letting my thoughts completely get out of control that it has become a learned behaviour for me (and my brain) rather than an illness of that makes sense.
bipolar,fckhqrd,t1_fcivwjd,1577725597.0,"Yes you have been very informative. I checked out that book Bipolar, not so much on amazon and reading the reviews it seems like it‚Äôs geared to people like me... who don‚Äôt fit the stereotypical symptoms for bipolar disorder or a unipolar depression either... in fact a couple reviews mentioned it‚Äôs great for people who have been given a BP2 or NOS diagnosis understand the spectrum . I knew they had overlapping features but I also didn‚Äôt know that OCD and ADHD are also on the same spectrum. I think I‚Äôm going to order it and check it out. Or see if it‚Äôs at the library as it‚Äôs $30 here."
bipolar,fckhftc,t1_fchq7wi,1577725406.0,Thanks for your input and to know I‚Äôm not alone in this worry.
bipolar,fciufr5,t1_fchxb4c,1577670073.0,"I really appreciate your thorough response. Thats is exactly why I posted this - I wanted some motivation to believe that psychiatry is doing the best it can for me. Although I‚Äôm not necessarily going to have my mind completely changed by a single post and the responses it gives me a lot to think about. Thank you for the links to resources - I think I need to educate myself more. A lot of my doubts probably do revolve around denial of my disorder. I only got a concrete diagnosis last winter (even though supposedly it was on file for 14 years without being discussed with me or confirmed). I don‚Äôt meet the stereotypical symptoms of hypomania so it‚Äôs all really confusing . I do question if my issues started with childhood emotional neglect, I know a lot of people had it and don‚Äôt get diagnosed with this disorder. I kind of blame both that any myself as I think I had a million opportunities to ‚Äúget myself together‚Äù yet no matter how hard I tried it wasn‚Äôt hard enough. I blame my dependence on meds to sleep when other people don‚Äôt go down that route. I guess if I blame myself it means I have some sort of control and there fore it doesn‚Äôt make it real."
bipolar,fcir065,t3_ehde1j,1577667749.0,Awesome. It finally got me to sleep 15 years ago. Now it often gets me to sleep.
unpopularopinion,fcimqul,t1_fcatm5x,1577665160.0,"Bipolar disorder isn‚Äôt a personality disorder you are confusing it with borderline personality disorder. Edit: and you are right, having a mental illness or personality disorder is not a free pass to be an asshole."
bipolar,fcik5rs,t1_fcid4qq,1577663911.0,Hey I‚Äôve never been to that sub you mentioned but I wouldn‚Äôt find solace there. It would confuse me even more. I posted here because I wanted to some help to get these thoughts and scepticism out of my head and I very much appreciate your response.

insomnia,fci2dsr,t3_eh6yis,1577656922.0,Seroquel if you can get your hands on it
bipolar,fchxpqf,t1_fchu416,1577655356.0,"Thanks for your input. I don‚Äôt think my psychiatrist has any ill intentions, i actually think she is very caring and kind and really wants to help me. She doesn‚Äôt really like me questioning much though. I think she would be really upset if I brought up these concerns to her.

I too am glad we are living in a time where we have what we do have rather than lunatic asylums which is surely where I would be."
bipolar,fchtxgg,t1_fcht5xe,1577654093.0,Haha! I like that ‚Äú needing the barbarian treatments‚Äù. I guess that‚Äôs my  relationship with the meds I take to sleep. I like your take on it. I guess flawed is more how I‚Äôm feeling rather than like it‚Äôs a complete fraud.
bipolar2,fchtkgz,t1_fchny1i,1577653967.0,I have terrible insomnia that is why I take mine in the morning. I would definitely check with your doctor about adjusting the time you take it.
bipolar2,fchieu5,t1_fcgzqxj,1577650726.0,"It took a really long time for me to get to that doses, like months. So a lot changed personally in that time. It certainly didn‚Äôt hurt. That‚Äôs the thing about lamictal is you have to go up so flipping slowly it‚Äôs such a long time before you‚Äôre at a therapeutic dose. Are you looking at taking it once or twice a day? I only take it in the mornings."
bipolar2,fcgy3uw,t1_fc6bthv,1577645215.0,"Started 25 and went up 25 every 2 weeks or so depending on how often I was forgetting to take it. Started feeling better at 150, now staying at 200mg. Although I went off work and started sleeping again so honesty that‚Äôs probably what calmed me down. I no longer had continual panic attacks about work"
bipolar,fbyz1k0,t1_fbxon1e,1577230250.0,"I feel so sorry for the couple of people that know both sides. It‚Äôs not fair that people I care about the least, such as coworkers, acquaintances  and strangers get to see me with the mask on, a person who is much more tolerable"

bipolar2,fbyy45c,t3_ee7bgb,1577229509.0,I‚Äôve always been very good with money. Not everyone experiences every stereotypical symptom
bipolar2,fbyxhpb,t1_fbyv26u,1577229013.0,"No I never noticed before. It took my psychiatrist observing it. I‚Äôm still not 100% sure what hypomania is as I only experienced long spells of extra racing thoughts, severe insomnia and heightened anxiety/panic. So when I experience those episodes I didn‚Äôt understand they weren‚Äôt typical as they were just heightened experiences of what I already experience anyways. It was one time they got so extreme I went to my psychiatrist. At my calmest I am anxious, have trouble sleeping, and racing thoughts.  I never get sex-crazed, overspend or have flights of grandiose ideas so I would have never guessed any of it was hypomania"
bipolar2,fbytlkj,t1_fbysyqs,1577225982.0,I also had a severe reaction to Zoloft. Unfortunately it worked great for a few months first
bipolar2,fbytjdb,t3_ef7akz,1577225934.0,If you‚Äôve had a hypomanic episode and episodes of depression I think that‚Äôs a diagnosis of BP2. It was my hypomania induced by various SSRIs that sealed my diagnosis
bipolar2,fbytg0b,t3_eekphy,1577225864.0,"I think there‚Äôs more research to back the Mediterranean (also known as kind of a brain food) diet. Low in read meat, mostly fatty fish, healthy fats such as olive oil, and primary plant based"
bipolar2,fbytcca,t3_eelf8d,1577225786.0,"Yes, in a mixed episode I can‚Äôt let go when I‚Äôve been wronged and obsessively seek ‚Äújustice‚Äù (NOT revenge)."
bipolar2,fbyt93c,t3_eeubws,1577225716.0,"I actually feel stable for the first time in over a year and over the last few months slowly worked up to 200mg lamictal with my seroquel. I was having hypo and mixed episodes that presented as extreme anxiety, panic, irritability, severe insomnia, feelings of being overwhelmed by everything and basically nothing good. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the Lamictal or the fact I‚Äôm off working and sleeping again."
insomnia,fbysy8x,t1_faz09u7,1577225489.0,For some people yes. I‚Äôve been steady on mine for 15 years
insomnia,fafifdj,t1_fadsk71,1576023537.0,Sometimes requiring sleep medication to sleep on a long term or even permanent based is no more bing addicted to sleep meds as someone with poor eyesight is addicted to their glasses
