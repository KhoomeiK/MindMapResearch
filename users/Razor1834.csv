You will look silly though.

Edit: you can’t have possession of the ball, jump and then land without releasing the ball, to be clear. 

One special case is a jump stop. You can gain possession while moving and jump off one foot and land on both. At that point both your feet are your pivot, so you can’t pick up and put down either without releasing the ball."

And you can watch plenty of basketball without understanding how some rules really work. It certainly does look like you “get 2 steps” at the end of the drive, but that’s not what’s happening from a rules standpoint.

You can gain control of the ball with both feet on the ground, then move one foot as far as you can. You’ve now established the other as your pivot foot. You can now lift your pivot foot and stand there like a flamingo as long as you want barring any other rules violations. As long as you don’t bring your pivot foot back to the ground you can start a dribble or shoot. You can even jump off your other foot, but then you can’t bring either foot back to the ground before releasing the ball."
