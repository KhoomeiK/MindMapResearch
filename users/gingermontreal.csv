also, you do have things to track: mood, water intake, exercise, reading, time online, etc. 

you can also use it to doodle or do other art. There are no rules. Maybe you don't need a lot of space for planning everyday, but maybe you want to journal. Or you can have very few dailies if that's what you want. It's flexible and it can change over time. 

Sometimes I have weeks where I don't have many appointments or things written down on my dailies. it sometimes bare and that's fine. other times I fill it in with washi tape or drawing or quotes."

boardgames,fek8qlm,t3_epjp6x,1579194956.0,"I don't have Viticulture (but I think it's on my list as one of my next games to buy), but I do have Everdell. The first plays of Everdell had me thinking the same way that you did, I think. I felt there wasn't enough time or resources, esp. at the beginning of the game, to get a good engine going. We thought there was something wrong with it and wanted to institute some house rules to give more resources at the beginning. We kept playing with standard rules and got the hang of it in a few more plays. After playing close to 20 times (a few solo, but most at 2p) we've figured out how to optimize our card combos, and it's ended up being my partner's favourite game. There's a lot of learning how to best use the cards in the beginning, especially the more obscure ones that don't seem that valuable to start with. There's a lot of different strategies to get a good city going, not just one right card order.  Getting a good resource card in the first season is extremely helpful. That being said, we've had lousy deals and great deals and had equal amounts of fun with the game.

I am worried that Everdell and Viticulture are too similar, so I'm eager to hear what other people in the thread say. Thanks for posting to compare these games."

boardgames,fdiu180,t3_elliq5,1578451025.0,"My husband beat me three times in a row last night by winning through science. It's kind of embarrassing! First time I didn't notice that he was so close, so that's on me, but the other two, I was actively trying to ensure that he couldn't get green cards. His Wonder cards allowing him an extra turn and another card that let him look through the discarded cards and pick one to build for free.

So yes, it's possible, and it's infuriating!

ETA: you don't need pairs of 6 different science cards to win. Just 6 different ones. Additionally, the ""law"" progress card counts as one of your science cards."

AmItheAsshole,fdcyx57,t3_eko06h,1578288479.0,"NTA -- The student is being pretty ridiculous going to the dean -- will they go to the dean for all papers? Also, the prof should have taken up this complaint and dealt with it after they student was insistent about a grade change. (Postdoc here, so I've taught and also TA'ed)

The dean is actually kinda smart here to say they can redo it. The student then has to put in an effort, and doesn't get a higher grade just for complaining.

I would ask your professor to grade the redo. The student will like this and feel they are getting special treatment, but it's really just a good way to ensure that they can't complain more. (Students love to complain about TAs but are less willing to be rude to profs about grades. Profs are often more stringent, too!)

Since the student acknowledges they are struggling, ask them to come to office hours and that you will talk them through the next paper, ideas, outlining, how to back up claims with evidence, etc.

Hang in there! It's best to grade everyone according to the same standard, and you're not wrong to stick to your guns.

In the future, it might be worth it to allow all your students the chance to redo one paper. Don't worry, most of them won't take you up on the offer, but it rewards effort and improvement for those who do.

Additionally, tell the student that you're happy to help mitigate the challenges they have where possible, but hearing about it after the fact or trying to deal with it by just upping the grade is not the way to go about it. Tell them you are happy to give extra help in office hours."

I find that you should definitely water if the leaves are starting to curl.

if you don't water it often, I'm guessing the yellowing and wilting is from not enough water

water when the soil is dry. I find I'm watering more often in winter because of the heat and dry air. adjust as seasons change."
