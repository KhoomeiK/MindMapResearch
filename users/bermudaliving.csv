WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdhkzm,t1_ffdas0z,1579821025.0,Majority of PARENTS are dumb af when it comes to social media and or definitely don’t don’t come close to being apart of the current climate. They have no idea of how quickly someone turns into a lifetime meme let alone spread like wild fire through a particular age group. So they think it’s cute and post it and share it then wonder why kid depression rates are so high. It’s not all their faults obviously but a lot of it stems from how careless parents are when they click that [share] button. On top of not understanding what kids go through online so they generalize things to “back in their day” ok my rants over.

Only 5 years ago I received my padi dive cert. I went to dive the same location and I’d say 50% of the reef is dead and almost no colorful fish are left - but the “scrap eaters” are prolific. A lot of barracuda, breams, chubs, and lobsters... No parrot fish, angle fish, barley any Mangrove snapper, etc

I’ve watched this happen in Grenada first, and since I’ve moved to Bermuda it’s slowly happening but thankfully the laws are super strict regarding killing of ocean life etc. $25,000 for a parrot fish + no spear guns, fish pots etc 

What I have noticed in Bermuda is the lack of land crabs that once use to cover the roads during full moons or super tides. Now if a teenager spots one they actually believe it’s a salt water crab which managed to survive on land.

Also lack of butterflies & bees. 

Sad times.

Don’t confuse having zero desires for so long than due to them creeping in means you’re falling backwards. 

Keep on course, fight the urges and I can bet any dollar you’ll be 1000x more happy in 2021 if you don’t give in.

Also if you start writing in a journal about your day to day experience (I’d recommend Tim Ferris routine) it’ll show you exactly what I’m really trying to express...

Someone not dealing with addictions go through the exact same shit just with other stuff. 

Take it a day at a time, write daily, go back and read every month and you’ll start to notice more patterns and triggers - you’ll then be able to alter those patterns and triggers but ultimately get to understand that they don’t ever fully dissipate and that’s completely fine as long as you’re aware and don’t relapse.

Also I’d recommend reading a lot about how the brain operates. It’s been extremely helpful.

depression_help,ff5ds6i,t3_ero365,1579588645.0,"(M 27) My best advice would be to give up on relationships 1000% in order to give yourself some clarity and sense of self love and respect / dignity 1st...

We’re living in a time of superficial everything + an abundance of availability which only makes both men and women less likely to commit to each other no matter how much love is actually on the table. 

Think about how much we have and how quickly it hit everyone all at once. 

Tinder, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Bumble, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, WhatsApp, this is all before the vast amount of sexual exposure let alone porn availability.

At one point in time if my girlfriend was upset with me I had only one choice: make her happy or guess what? No lovey dovey text, or love period for me. 

Now? If I wanted I can open an app and start an entire new engagement with someone from 1000 miles away and fill the void more or less “over night”. If not overnight definitely within 72 hours. 


My solution for finding real people in this new hyper connected world is through not finding them on any of these platforms. 

9 X out of 10 -  I look to meet people offline and often start with discussions related to this subject and if they’re atone or even 50% agree with my thoughts on this stuff I know for myself they’re “worthy” and or at least worth keeping some sort of connection with.

I also take it extremely slow because if it’s real it won’t matter - but if it’s fake it’ll be exposed more or less a lot sooner. I’d become very scarce on giving out love so freely - and even more so when found on the internet of things. 

Maybe I’m a little crazy about this stuff but I’ve experienced a lot more genuine people after taking this approach.. best of luck 🤞"

Instead of saving for a vacation and all that goes into it - I’d set a goal for myself I’ve struggled to finish. 

1. Read 15 books on subject (fill in the blank) before booking that Jamaica getaway. 

2. Get tooth fixed before taking that 6 day cruise to South America. 

3. Enroll for new college course for next semester before booking that music festival. 

It’s a serious game changer and lights a fire unlike anything else.

If I’m not drinking for weeks and months my body’s cortisone levels would stabilize then alcohol throws it all out of loop - Swapped hard liquor for wine and weed for a while - couldn’t go cold turkey after so many years of drinking.

AdultDepression,fds9ty7,t3_emyae1,1578697671.0,"Sounds like I've been in this very space you're at a million times. 

I haven't figured it all out but have noticed some changes since doing the following:

\- taking a BREAK even when I can keep going so I don't end up burnt out grasping for oxygen and end up taking part in the same things that keep me away from accomplishing my dreams. (clubs, girls, distractions, drugs, Netflix, porn, etc)

\- take note of everything I do throughout the day so, at the end of each month,  I can track why shit got done or it didn't. I use the Tim Ferris model.

\- I cut off all friends and family who were negative or weren't helping me etc

\- stopped listening to negative music, videos, porn etc

\- stopped getting drunk because no matter what people say the hangover effect is a bitch when you're susceptible to depression etc (this goes for weed too because when you can't get any you also feel like complete shit which becomes a trigger. Took me a long time but cutting off the b.s friends helped.)

\- didn't go all-in with the yoga stuff yet but I did download insight timer a meditation app and anytime I start to feel the dark shadows coming in - I'd simply put headphones in and zone out. Sometimes if the environment isn't the best I'd just go into a bathroom and listen to some guided breathing steps or stuff like that. I started this after watching a lot of professionals use it for their stress management.

\- lucky had someone around who I can trust so I told them I'd need someone to vent to at times and they were down for the cause - therefore anytime shit hit the fan I had my very own therapist to get everything off my chest - I also have a journal for this kind of stuff too. It sounds childish to some but it's nothing better than feeling like you've come to the end and open a journal where you were really screwed up and recognize you've been here before so makes the process a bit less grueling etc

I also play with the idea of death. If I died right now what would  I be most happy about that I did accomplish and what I wish I did do when I had the time. Take both answers and do more of them both and letting everything else go that's stopping you will be much easier.

I messed around with CBD but only the full spectrum stuff from companies accredited by health practitioners and noticed after a month or so I actually started having better mornings and slept a lot easier which reminds me - I also stopped staying up late due to FOMO aka social media etc and started sleeping by 10:00 pm and waking up at 4:30 am religiously. Sounds crazy but this alone helped me fight a lot off the things holding me back. Waking up at 4:30 am gives you the ability to do more in a day than anyone else and or simply enjoy more life + sleeping much earlier than everyone else keeps your head in the game and a lot of health benefits.  

I hope this helps a bit."
