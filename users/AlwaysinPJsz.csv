Except for my year they added the rule ‚Äòno alcohol‚Äô and would take any alcohol away. A teacher even took a bottle of expensive whiskey from a student and emptied it in front of his eyes.

BUT they said nothing explicitly about other softdrugs really. So the theme party was Disney, and a friend of mine shows up, completely out of theme dressed like a total hippie and stoned as hell. No teacher could tell if she was really high or just playing the outfit really well hence they could not send her away. They were so confused"

I was drunk and decided I could take a quick shit to get rid of the belly pain. The cafe we where at had only two toilets but it was still very empty (it was like 11 PM). But when I was at the toilet taking my shit a whole group of girls came in and they all had to go aswell and after a while they started joking that the person on the other toilet must've been shitting or puking and the jokes kept going on. I felt so ashamed I didn't dare to come out of the toilet so i just stayed there in Panic and after 20 min even my friends came looking for me but I still didn't answer because I was panicking. They started cracking jokes with the girls and when they all left I've sat on there for an hour out of panic still before quickly leaving the toilet and reassured all the smell was gone and leaving through the backdoor. Very. Akward. Night."
