DivinityOriginalSin,ff379d8,t1_ff3671k,1579535366.0,"Well if you're at all interested in it there is a show called Critical Role, where a bunch of voice actors play D&D. If you do end up watching I'd recommend beginning with Campaign 2 as Campaign 1 started in the middle of a game.

Dragon quest, at least the older ones, are closer to Pokemon combat wise, I also didn't know they brought 12 to the switch. It's probably my favorite one just for the environment alone.

Anywho, I've gotta get adulting today, if you ever wanna do some co-op in divinity and you play on PC feel free to add me on steam, I've got the same name!"
DivinityOriginalSin,ff36ou2,t1_ff35x2z,1579534977.0,"Exactly, if you're at all into science I guess an analogy would be use physics everyday as a way to interact with everything. Regular magic would be the machines that we've built to do work for us. While bending how physics works and changing the properties of it for a moment would be akin to source."
DivinityOriginalSin,ff35tqm,t3_erbo4c,1579534380.0,"Great game, the first one is actually what got me interested in D&D. I've loved turn based combat since FF tactics and was looking forever for another game that incorporated a dynamic field into combat. 

I stumbled across divinity, then figured out that it was basically inspired by D&D and since then have had no time to do anything xD 

Great game, hope you enjoy it!"
DivinityOriginalSin,ff35anm,t1_ff34f1i,1579534019.0,"Source is sorcery that using the energy of creation basically, taking from the 'source'.

Basically you have regular magic and then you have source which is a deeper more powerful magic that taps into the very building blocks of reality"

DnD,fe9e64r,t3_eo5mj7,1578936753.0,"I just started dming a little less than a year ago due to finding out about Critical Role. (It's taken almost a year-and-a-half but I'm almost caught up!)

Having played a lot of RPGs in my days dungeon design and combat felt pretty intuitive to learn but one of the things I'm having the hardest time with is internal political structures and faction and using those to create stories that can be found within cities, and between them.

I'm really hoping that some of the insight into the conflicts of Wildmount will help me create factions that are more believable.

Thank you for taking the time and effort to make this, and to everybody at critical role for always encouraging positivity and motivating me to make the effort to be a better person!"

StoriesAboutKevin,fdhqiv7,t1_fdh7ndr,1578428187.0,"Four dimensional objects are way more useful conceptually than literally. If you can understand two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects and how adding a plane can give you that third dimension, that's all you really need.

Adding another plane and another axis gives one more point on a graph. I've seen people try multiple different ways of representing a four dimensional object, but I've never been able to associate those representations physically. On the other hand conceptually they can be used to create physical representations of space, through computer simulation. 

if you needed a better explanation than what I can offer through a couple of paragraphs on Reddit try the linear algebra sections on Khan academy!"

DnD,fcnlh9x,t1_fcnihgk,1577813794.0,"It's the slumber and eviscerate spells that are giving me pause. I can't help but envision a scenario where the players just save it until the ending of strong encounters where things are getting tight. At that point they get a free surprise round to close out the fight. This one is more of a minor gripe, I don't think this will be too big of a deal given the health of the enemies at that level, possibly bump up to fifth level upon playtesting


Second when you compare eviscerate to the closest spell to it, magic missile, you are keeping the damage around the same from a 3rd level magic missile and giving it a DoT component, while making it scale better. Magic missile is unique because there is no save, auto hit and low damage. It just feels like a buff to magic missile. Also would making the con save here stop the DoT completely? There are high level beasts that wouldn't be able to make medicine checks and would just bleed out. Just hit them and keep running till they fall dead. Especially given the rangers ability to impede movement this feels strong."
DnD,fcniwgg,t1_fclv531,1577812576.0,"Drivethru rpg has a couple of in-depth potion making things, my advice would be to think about one or two potion ingredients for your potions (world of Warcraft and runescape have alchemy features built in so stealing from here is possible) give the potion a DC and a negative effect if it isn't met. Top it off with a feature where if a player has made a potion successfully x times then they've learned how to make it and don't need to roll anymore unless under pressure."
DnD,fcni7nf,t3_ei2eg1,1577812226.0,My only concern is that some of these feel a tad too strong in the fact that the enemies don't have the ability to save from them. Especially if the player is in any way familiar with the creature they are fighting.

todayilearned,fckivok,t1_fcj5y0e,1577726308.0,"Let's take it out of context and apply this scenario to a teacher-student relationship. I have a student that tries hard. Puts in extra effort and asks questions. Personally I feel that they are a great student. Then there is another student who is mostly quiet comes in late sometimes and seems to ignore the lectures, but they turn in their work on time and do well in the tests.

there's a good chance that I will have a bias towards the first student and give them a better grade because I noticed the effort that they put in. I could use that as a means to justify it.

or I could notice that I have a bias towards the first student and be more harsh with their grade in an attempt to neutralize my bias. 

The same thing for the second student I could read the more poorly because I feel that they are not putting in the same effort as the first student

Or I could realize that I am weighing both students in comparison to each other and push both of their grades closer together because I feel that I have a bias.

It is very hard to remain impartial with people and things that you become opinionated on. It is very likely for someone to be moved in some way shape or form. This is also why public speaking and soft skills are becoming more and more a focus of career building."

TalesFromRetail,fc6r4nt,t1_fc6ng8g,1577487358.0,"I guess you don't see it the way my local stores do? I know the stuff there that makes them money. 

I know the stuff that they can't compete with because the manufacturer gives huge discounts to places like Walmart and Amazon. There are products these stores have that I'm going to be spending $200 more and it won't make them anything.

 I won't know what is worth it for them unless I ask, and anytime I've been a frequent customer of a place and I strike up a conversation with the owner, they've never had issue telling me what items are usually there just to draw people in but don't make them money and what I can buy from them to support them.

Maybe it's just the way I go about it? Or maybe I'm pissing them off and don't know it? Either way, I'm going to shop local if I can, but there's no sense in me going broke over it if it isn't helping anyone."
TalesFromRetail,fc5yu72,t1_fc5ueej,1577468679.0,"True, but if you have Xproduct and X at local store is $400 and they make $5 on it, then there is X product at box store and they sell it for $350, you now have $50 extra to spend at the local store on stuff that might make the local store $20. 

So in the end you spend less and the local store ends up with more profit."
TalesFromRetail,fc5mk6b,t1_fc5ljb9,1577461534.0,"In that case it might have been better to buy the lawnmower at the box store and the blades and stuff with the small shop.

 In those cases the box store ends up with a discount because they move a larger amount of them then a small shop can. So in this case it might be better for their bottom line and your pocket. In those situations feel free to talk to them and be frank about it."
TalesFromRetail,fc4zuk5,t1_fc4bh6c,1577435864.0,"So much this. Also get to know the owners of these places. If something is online and there is a drastic price difference between in-store and online, talk to them (privately away from other customers). 


Be forthright, ""I want to buy as much from you as I can, but can't justify the price difference in the purchase this time. Your price is X and the online price is Y, might we be able to meet somewhere in the middle?"" Do that infrequently and oftentimes people are more than willing to work with you. 

If they cannot do it be respectful, thank them for hearing you out. 

I try to support my local businesses as much as I can,  but I am also not dealing with a 300% markup in the stupid cases (ie luxury hdmi & surge protectors) and stuff like that"

AskReddit,fbzv5vc,t1_fbyhle3,1577263267.0,"Many things are true in the literally sense, but think about how many things can be metaphorically true! Since there is a possibility to have a greater number of metaphorical truths, due to them being man made they must be better.

 Further yet if it's metaphorical I can never be proven wrong because it's not factual to begin with. So if you do not see it as true clearly you're just a viewing it out of context. But if you're wrong in the literal sense than there is no coming back from that. 

So everything that is literally true is absolutely meaningless in a word filled with far superior figurative being living in a reality so colored by their opinions and experiences, that people will deny actual reality to assert what they believe as fact."
