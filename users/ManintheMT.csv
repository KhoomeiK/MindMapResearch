Husqvarna,ff49dp7,t1_ff3yr4r,1579558397.0,"Common mods are a fuel tuner and the secondary fuel tank that takes the place of the rear subframe.  I added the rear tank to have around 3.2 gallons of fuel which would go at least 100 miles.  I did some point to point rides with that bike and the big range was great.

Once you have the bike home I would suggest you do pull the tank (be patient lol) and check the wiring harness where it goes near the upper rear shock mount towards the ECM connections.  My harness was getting pinched there and would have eventually caused me electrical issues.  

With regular maintenance these bikes hold up great. I even finished a couple rides with no coolant in the bike.  Had a tiny radiator hose leak that took me two rides to figure out.  Anyway the second time the bike did at least fifteen miles with no coolant, it got hot.  But once home I changed the oil, fixed the coolant leak.  Bike didn't skip a beat, tough.  Fwiw I run Lucas 20w50 synthetic, my motors seem to like it."
Husqvarna,ff3qer4,t3_er9nie,1579546613.0,"I bought a 2011 Husaberg FX450 new and rode it until this spring.  The FX didn't come with lights and had different gearing but basically the same bike.

The engine design is unique and has pros and cons.  Due to its orientation the bike holds 1.75 qts of oil.  So you are buying more oil with each change but I think it is great for the motor to have more capacity.  I rode my FX very hard, raced it in woods and desert events, it never let me down.

The bike is heavy compared to other 450s, but it ""rides lighter"" with the rotating mass being in the center of the bike.  If you want a 450 or bigger and are trail riding and/or dual sporting it doesn't make any difference, the ""70 degree"" bikes are great for that.  Jimmy Lewis loved these models, said the 570 version was the best dual sport bike available at the time.  I am sure you can google his articles.

Outside of the frame, engine orientation and rear subframe, all the other parts are KTM.  I never had a single issue getting parts ordered online.  And regarding the engine, from the base gasket up it is exactly like the KTM engine of that time.

This model isn't the easiet bike to work on though.  To remove the tank you have to fold back the air filter boot that is under the front of the seat, it can be a pain.  The wiring setup is very cramped under the seat, the battery is buried under the ECM and fuses. 

Over the years I added a JD fuel tuner to richen it up.  I got tired of the FX gearbox and modded it to FE specs (not an issue for the bike you are looking at), and then later I rebuilt the engine to be a 510.

I could go on and on, let me know if you have any questions.  Fwiw I sold mine this spring to a friend at what I would consider a discounted price of $3k.  I wish I had been able to keep it but I needed a down payment for my new bike."

RedditForGrownups,fei3fg7,t3_ep9v1p,1579129419.0,"It has certainly changed at our house over the years.  We ate in the kitchen as a family of four an average of probably four nights a week until the kids became teenagers.  It still happens but there are so many more obligations.

Both kids are in sports, the oldest has a part time job.  The number of evenings we are all together and my wife or myself has planned dinner has become more rare.  We have found the most dependable dinner prep method to be something in the crock pot with no set time of eating.  One upside to this is leftovers for lunches, but I totally see your point about wasted food and wasted ingredients.  

I remember as a kid (70s) that my stay at home had a ""go to"" list of dinners like spaghetti or tuna casserole etc.  Those known recipes probably made up 70% of the dinners.  We haven't really been able to establish a reliable list like this, not counting the weekly pot of taco meat.

So I can directly relate to your question.  Far too often dinner is whatever recipe we can find on our phone after work.  We grab the ingredients on the way home and prepare it.  Sometimes it's good, ""hey we should put this on the go to list"", but rarely do they stick, and any odd ingredients get partially used and later thrown out.  But hey our spice rack variety is pretty vast, probably hundreds of dollars tied up that cupboard!"
