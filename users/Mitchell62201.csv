 Here is the Wild, we seen an interaction between two Humans. The female tries to hint at her fertility, but the male was clearly distracted by something else, so when he tries to initiate the possibility of mating, he has already missed the opportunity. Scientists are still baffled by the mating rituals of Humans, and it may take decades before it is figured out. These are clearly confusing times."
