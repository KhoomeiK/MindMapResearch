greysanatomy,fem1itr,t3_epsle6,1579236728.0,"idk i feel like a lot of my issues with the character have resolved with better writing.

1) She had no chemistry with Jackson, and I’m glad they broke up the two characters.  I hope this opens both of them up to relationships with characters with better chemistry and can lead to better romantic plots for the both of them.

2) She was originally portrayed as a “perfect” character who was the youngest, smartest, best, etc. cardiac surgeon they ever had. Most of this was done through telling as opposed to showing, so it felt disingenuous and did nothing to endear you to her character.  I feel like the plot where the family member operation goes wrong has really opened us up to a Maggie who isn’t perfect, who was arrogant and made a grave error in judgement due to her arrogance, who has to confront the extreme consequences of making a poor ethical decision in performing the operation.  I feel like we have a lot of material to go on with her right now, and i’m interested to see how it plays out."

Big4,fdts7tr,t1_fdtr8jv,1578721384.0,"so you probably aren’t going to get much of a say, but 100% go for smaller clients.  Everyone at my firm having shitty experiences is one big client, i find that they develop their own team culture independent of the office culture and it’s impossible to change.  Small clients can be busier because you’re on a bunch with different filing deadlines, but you’ll get to see the whole audit process and learn a ton.  plus, when you don’t like a client, you’re not married to 1 small client.

And I’m in commercial, we don’t do FS out of my office.  I used to intern at a bank though, so i knew i didn’t want to get involved in FS."
Big4,fdtpplm,t1_fdto8qc,1578720285.0,"i haven’t refused yet, so idk what would happen.  Someone on the team was passed over for senior for “taking too much time to meet deadlines” which was total BS, so they may have been refusing to eat hours. 

I’m on a very large team with a very toxic team culture.  We work very late for the sake of working late (for example, I’m about to go into the client and work tomorrow despite having nothing to work on), you can only work on very limited aspects of the audit due to client size so i’m not learning and developing skills at the same rate as my peers, we have a very tense audit room atmosphere and spend most of the day in silence not speaking to each other (which means i have built no relationships with my team), and many of my team members say racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, or otherwise offensive comments that make me feel uncomfortable (this isn’t just me being sensitive, i worked with another person who felt the same way when on the team).  I dread going to work every day, resent my company for refusing to let anyone roll off this client, and am counting down the days until i have the ability to move offices or jump ship to a different B4 and have the opportunity to be on a not so depressingly bad team."

I don't think Goodwill is a bad organization per se, but they have engaged in some very unethical practices involving compensation and anti-competition in the past.

BeautyGuruChatter,fcry3dv,t1_fcnd0yk,1577908202.0,"So I bought that because of Taylor's video on it, and was disappointed.  It kind of creased on me and settled into my lines (admittedly not necessarily more so than other foundations I have), but more importantly it was an instant oxidizer on me.  Like, it immediately went 2-3 shades darker on my skin, and i could pump new product out on the back of my hand and there was a stark difference between the color out of the bottle and the color oxidized on my skin."
BeautyGuruChatter,fcrxjci,t1_fcqz2f5,1577907992.0,"They take advantage of Depression era federal labor law that allows them to pay sub minimum wages to disabled individuals.  Some people earn less than $2 an hour there.  While someone else mentioned that they often employ profoundly disabled people who are unreliable workers, more often then not they have disabled employees who are fairly capable and productive workers who are just getting taken advantage of by this organization.

You can research more on the topic, but I've also heard that they do some shady stuff with donations as well (not everything is getting put out on the floor for the community to buy like most donators assume).



On top of that, Goodwill has some shady practices regarding executive compensation."
Cooking,fcodeem,t1_fcn487u,1577829504.0,"That is not what happens at all.  In the United States, various immigrant groups have come to the country and adjusted their traditional dishes to the availability and cost of ingredients in certain regions at times in history.  This has resulted in cuisines like Italian-American food, Irish-American food, etc. that originated from the non-American country’s cuisine but have taken on their own characteristics not normally seen in the original countries.  It’s not because our tastebuds are “so whack,” it’s usually because immigrants are poor and can’t afford the items they would normally cook with, or there’s limited access to specific ingredients in the U.S."
relationship_advice,fckib6b,t1_fcik5in,1577725956.0,"Yeppp. My mom used to do this to my brother.  Constantly screaming at my brother and scapegoating him, which then led to him behaving badly, which then lead to more screaming and abuse, and the cycle continued.  Dad did absolutely nothing to stop it, other siblings weren't really around for it.  Obviously it fucked my brother up the most, but it affected me too.  Even when you're 5 you have a sense of right and wrong, and I would always be thinking ""why is my Mom acting this way? It's not right to treat him like this over unimportant things.""  Worst was when she would try to involve me the way this mom is doing with the ""we're going to live together and they can live separately"" or what she and my own mother did with the constant ""I love them but I just don't like them"" shit.  I didn't want any part in it and it made me feel like I was being forced to take a side I disagreed with.  It made me strongly dislike my mother for most of my childhood, permanently damaged my relationship with my brother, and left me with a lot of anxiety issues I still deal with today (because verbal and emotional abuse is still abuse, and it fucks children up to witness abuse).

So if you're reading this OP, grow a pair and stop this shit.  You're almost as bad as your wife for just enabling this to happen to your children."
Big4,fcg65ai,t1_fcfs7m9,1577636857.0,"Do you know anyone at the firms?

Big4,fcfin2z,t1_fcc5pgi,1577630393.0,"Unfortunately my office simply doesn’t care about how bad our experiences are on this and other larger clients, so I’ll only be able to fix it when I move to another office or just quit the firm for a different one.  So be careful, I get that other people are saying that shit like this doesn’t happen, but if you are unlucky and it does it is a literally soul crushing situation to be in."
Big4,fcc43hr,t3_eh07k0,1577594186.0,"So I’m actually an example of what your firm is talking about, and it does suck and does stunt your development at the firm.  One thing I’ve noticed (in my office at least) is that because being on these large clients is shitty for the reasons you just mentioned, they have difficulty staffing them. So a lot of people who come into the firm as experience hires or people who have just lost a client get placed on them, because they virtually always have room for people.  So there is a risk you could get boxed into a client like that.

I think ultimately you should try to research the B4 offices you’re looking at, see if you can get a sense of what their biggest clients are and what your actual risk is of getting placed in a team like I’m on is.  If your office doesn’t have an massive clients, this probably won’t be an issue.  If it has 2, 3, 4 of them, then I would say there’s a non-insignificant chance you could get placed on something like that."

SkincareAddiction,fc6wq3s,t3_egbj43,1577491460.0,"She sounds like some of my shitty past derms.  I went through like a dozen dermatologists before finding one who was competent enough to treat and clear my very resistant acne.  The worst ones were adamant that my moderate severity acne could 100% be cleared by antibiotics (literally never cleared anything the dozen times I was forced to take a course), birth control (repeatedly made it worse until my current Derm helped me find a brand that has a neutral effect), multiple topicals (that caused massive irritation to my ultra sensitive skin), and finally accusations that I don’t wash my face enough/correctly and that I need to stop all moisturizers (see topicals for why that’s a bad idea).  They couldn’t understand that my acne had a variety of causes and wanted to blame me for it instead of their incompetence.

My current Derm knew from the get that a 25 year old woman with acne like a teen has a myriad of things going on under the surface.  She encouraged me to wash my face with cleanser only in the evening and water in the morning, helped me find a topical regime that wasn’t blitzing the top layer of my skin off/introduced me to contact therapy for certain harsher topicals, got me on medication to actually address my hormonal acne, and then finally had me do a lower dose round of Accutane to take care of the acne still lingering.  If she had come into this with the attitude that “your skin is dirty and therefore congested” I would not be sitting here and typing this with pristinely clear skin for the first time since I was 10.  I’m just glad the derm I found actually keeps up on research instead of wives tales and based her treatment for me on that."

relationships,fc4e2z3,t1_fc4c1dz,1577413995.0,"Look, your sister had a kid in less than ideal situations.  That doesn’t mean your parents have to prioritize you over her and their grandchild.  Nobody is “entitled to sanity” in a shared living situation like this where you’re not paying rent.  You either have to accept compromises and figure out coping mechanisms for you to deal with being in the household, or start aggressively saving up for and prioritizing a move out.  Your sister has just as much a right to rely on her parents in a time of need as you do.  If you can’t figure out ways to not yell at your niece, and you can’t afford to move out, you need to do what other posters said and limit your time in the house."

But I agree, if OP can't get their shit together and stop yelling at a 5 year old, the onus is on them to move out.

She was behind on learning to read and extremely resistant to sitting down and reading, and my SIL was at her wits end on how to deal with it.  I just had a puppy and was doing training classes, so I came up with the idea to give her a small treat after doing the reading instead of getting frustrated with her/trying to force her to do it.  It was shockingly as effective as giving my dog treats when doing training, and many rice krispy treats later my niece loves to read and is one of the top in her class in English.

dogs,fc1oyqa,t1_fc1ny4m,1577325135.0,"Idk if this is still the case, but 3 years ago pretty much anyone asking about what breed to get as an inexperienced owner would be directed to labs or poodles, with standard poodles often being characterized as calmer than smaller ones.  Often times they would be described as relatively low energy with less exercise needs.  Granted, the average lab or poodle might be lower energy than your average border collie or or pointer is, but they’re still retrievers.  They both originated as sporting dogs used to retrieve waterfowl, so it shouldn’t be shocking that there can be pretty high energy ones in the breed.  In many ways they are great dogs for inexperienced owners, but I think it’s a little misleading to suggest that’s because they have low energy requirements."
dogs,fc136oj,t3_effz12,1577306942.0,"Amen.  I remember when I was looking for my dog I saw a lot of people recommend standard poodles, because they’re low energy and easy to train.  When I get my dog from a reputable breeder, he ends up being extremely high energy, not the smartest, and very difficult to train (not a food motivated guy).  I love my dog, but after talking to various trainers etc. while trying to tame my then wild beast it became apparent to me that poodle are generally higher energy and can be more difficult than people here would have you think.  Like there is a reason why they used to be used as hunting dogs and many people can still train them to do that (my dog would probably be a great hunting dog if I did shooting).

Moral of the story is that you shouldn’t take the word of people here as the word of God.  A lot of people are repeating what they know of a breed of dog without having ever owned that breed.  And even within breeds and with well bred dogs, there can be a certain spectrum of behavior and energy levels.  My dog is definitely not a chill, calm guy and instead has literally boundless energy which, since he’s a poodle, often results in him literally bouncing off the walls.  Just take the things you read here with a grain of salt, always research before making decisions with your dog, and prioritize the advice of your vet or reputable dog professionals over unverifiable advice you read here from people you don’t know."

When we think of somebody having a slow paced job with nothing to do, we usually mean that in terms of the work related tasks on their plate.  That person spends most of the day slacking off, talking to coworkers, fucking around online, etc.  Some people are fine with doing that.  What this company did was to truly and absolutely take away all stimulation you had during the day, so that people were essentially sitting alone, in silence, with no work to do but also no other forms of stimulation or time passing to engage in.  That’s not something the average person can deal with for 8 hours a day."
