CasualConversation,fekh2hv,t3_epiaam,1579199895.0,"Speaking as a former art school student, I‚Äôd also consider taking some drawing, 3D design/sculpture classes, and industrial/product design too. The drawing classes are the most important, imo. 

My major was illustration, which is basically fancy drawing, but even my friends who did 3D, film, photography, and digital media majors said that the year-long drawing course that all the incoming freshmen took at my art school was *essential* in developing their skills. The most important thing the class taught me was how to really look at an object and understand how to represent its form in space on a 2d surface.

Even if your school doesn‚Äôt offer them, I‚Äôd look and see if your town has some continuing education drawing classes, like a beginner life drawing class, because if you wanna make furniture or other handheld objects that people are going to use a lot, a basic knowledge of how human anatomy works will go a long way for you"

1.  Is there any risk right now of a possible tsunami hitting Puerto Rico?

2. The Miami Herald in particular mentioned that Puerto Rico has a *lot* of seismic activity, with hundreds of tremors recorded every day (though the vast majority are too weak to be felt). I was wondering what the rate of premature or early births is on Puerto Rico, since minor earthquake tremors have been known to cause a pregnant woman‚Äôs water to break. In fact, my sister was born about a week before her due date as a result of a minor earthquake in New England in April 1996.
