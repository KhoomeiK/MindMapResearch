As for Insulin prices, I don’t know what the main cause of that is, out side of maybe greed. I don’t read minds, so I try not to give motive to things or people I don’t know.

Yes Greed is the biggest problem with capitalism, but I don’t think it can be regulated. Giving people “free” things is the wrong way to go imo. There are many good points for UHC. No matter what we do there will be flaws tho.

As far a HRC, I try not to talk about her. It makes my blood boil, and is one of my least favourite people on this earth. Even b4 she ran for president. I told my wife that if she voted for her, I would ask for a divorce. Luckily Obama got the nomination and I didn’t have to worry about it for 8 more years."
