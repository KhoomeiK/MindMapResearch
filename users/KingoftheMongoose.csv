Though you'd need the wizards to travel along with the projectile and recast every 10m (30ft) a total of 30 times to get the total 300m range. 
 
...which would mean they would have to be following at the same speed shortly behind said projectile... Perhaps strapped to their own projectile traveling the same velocity. 
 
Now that second projectile, let's call it the WizShuttle, would need its own propulsion. Now this could simply be solved with Fly, but if these are all Lvl 1 wizards then we're stuck again to our favorite fisting cantrip. Let's suppose the total target payload of the WizShuttle is also 90kgs, that means we'd need an additional 20 more wizards to self propel the WizShuttle as the original 20 wizards guide the original projectile. But with 40 wizards in tow, we'd need to limit the weight of crew to stay under 90kgs (200lb). Kobolds are 30lbs a piece, no good. But fairies are only 4lbs! That gives us 160lb crew weight AND 40lbs left over for the WizShuttle materials. Likely plywood. 
 
In summation, in order to get a 90kg to travel 300m, we would also require 40 Lecwl 1 fairy wizards all fisting together closely behind."

movies,fdqfk72,t1_fdpc1di,1578665393.0,"I could see a GL Trilogy where the first is focused on establishing the Green Lantern Core and it's fight against the Yellow Lanterns, with Sinestro's betrayal as a central plot point. Keep it simple to allow for character development of Hal, Sinestro, the Guardians of Oa, Killowogg, and the other Green and Yellow lanterns. Really take the time to build on the mythos and establish the universe as the setting. Hal is already an established Lantern (#2 behind Sinestro until he defects) and John is the new recruit that the audience follows.

GL2: Lantern Wars adds Guy Gardner and focuses on the emergence of other Lantern Cores. Theirs is this massive multifront galactic war with Atrocitus of the Red Lanterns trying to form a Red/Yellow/Orange coalition against Green/Violet/Blue. Indigo arrives in Act 3 warning of a larger impending doom. Lots of casualties occur across the various Cores, including some key GLs (Hal, Killowogg, Head Guardian Krona!)

GL3: Darkest Night, focuses on the rise of the Black Lanterns, the fall of many Lanterns, and some entire Cores (Red, Violet, Yellow) to be raised as undead Black Lanterns. Led by Hal, Killowogg, Atrocitus, Krona and others are all evil zombies consuming the Galaxy with more black rings. The last surviving Guardian Ganthet and John leads a small band of resistance with Indigo and survivors of the other Cores to retreat until they reach Earth. They recruit Kyle Rayner and start to ally with Sinestro and Star Sapphire, Guy takes on a Red Ring. At this point, any dead DCEU characters rise as Black Lanterns to give chase as they try to escape and form a plan to rescue the last Orange and Blue Lantern. Only then can they all unite to attack the Black Lantern Battery. They try to fuse the colors to make Kyle a White Lantern but he is suddenly killed by Zombie Hal. Sinestro (wielding his yellow ring and Kyle's green ring) and zombie Hal have Round 2. Red/Green Guy faces zombie Kyle and the team finally fuses their colors (Orange was selfishly holding out until the last minute) to allow John to become the White Lantern to resurrect Hal and the Black Lanterns, and destroy the Black Lantern Battery once and for all."

Archers and crossbows are for crowd control, but unless I'm Britain, I'm probably just gonna leave them back on the walls as garrison. 
 
Edit for relevance to main topic: Thus, the main messaging and coordination is done prior to combat (the manuevering), and then giving the signal to commit calvary. As others noted, this can be done with flags and horns rather than runners."
