AskReddit,fcxnegv,t3_ejdlbw,1578067078.0,"so i had this friend in high school. he was always saying really offensive things and trying to annoy us. one day i just snapped and told him to go mind his own business and he told his mom this and that we were bullying him. his mom texted me via messenger: “i think i need to talk to your parents or i’ll call the police tomorrow and you might end up in prison, your choice.” i blocked her and she went on to blackmail my friends who were also “bullying him” and she was saying things like “you little c**ts i’m gonna call the police and ruin your little messed up lives”. this didn’t end here, at some point she actually told her son to find out where i lived and she came knocking on my door saying that i was bullying his son and that i had better surrender to it. afterwards, we found out that she had both called the police and the school principle to report our “bullying behaviour”. she’d also post a series of rant on facebook revealing our names and asking people who knew us to step up and literally give her information about us and our whereabouts. the guy lost all his friends after that."

the Giver quartet, 
Me before You series, 
the Fault in Our Stars, 
the Perks of being a Wallflower,

AskReddit,fc9cwjr,t3_egrtc6,1577550698.0,"i had a deam of a real life purge. So me and my friends, George and Fred, yes, Weasley and a couple of other friends- except they actually exist, were playing in my bathroom (idk why) and we didn't even know the purge was going on. Our parents were in the living room have adult talk that was really about the purge. So then, all of a sudden, they burst into the bathroom and told us we all had to leave to go to a ***really fun place*** and we literally just agreed and went into a tiny bus (literally a bus but really small?) that was our vehicle apparently, and set off. All our surroundings seemed to be empty and like desert but me and my friends were just up on the second floor of the bus and playing games and talking. I had this sudden urge to run downstairs and see what was going on, because ***obviously you totally wouldn't be able to see it from upstairs***, but I went down and found my parents. At that moment this cowboy dude who had scars or whatever on his face came over to our bus and just stood there, leering at us. He was also standing outside this thing like a workshop shed with weapons in it and I realised he was here to kill us. When I started panicking, this kid, called Ethan, who's got autism btw idk why I know that, ran over to us and said to the cowboy, ""don't kill theeeeeeem"", because he was actually pointing a gun at us. The cowboy just threw, yes literally, threw a saw at his head and Ethan's head just split open but he didn't even die and just said ow. His mom was watching this whole scene and she just started crying and ran over to him, at which point the cowboy threw a knife, and it sliced her hand clean off. I just ran upstairs to my friends, who were huddled together because they'd realised what was happening. One of them just **suddenly** happened to be my girlfriend and we just started embracing and... making out, like we are dying and let's just start making out because that's what you do. Yeah, this dream was really long and idk."
