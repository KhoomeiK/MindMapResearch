depression,ffdpgut,t1_ffdovtb,1579825856.0,"Yeah we talk about everything, it can be anybody in luding her. It's hard go explain because I'm not even sure where it comes from, but throughout the day everything will be fine and I know that she likes me. However whenever I'm trying to sleep every single time my brain tells me that I'm worthless and that nobody would like me. So yeah im not even sure why I think like that. 

I hope so, I just dont have much hope for myself anymore, things have only gotten harder and worse to deal with in the last few years."
depression,ffdn0cu,t1_ffdlr9h,1579824345.0,"Sort of, its not really what I want to work as but it's the right sort of track. I work at a sort of doggy day care where we look after the dogs for a day, walk them, clean after them and everything that entails. I prefer 'exotic' animals so I want to work in a zoo or atleast in animal conservation.

Eating is one of the only things that makes me happy but then sometimes my weight makes me depressed so I starve myself for days which isn't healthy.

Yeah our friendship is one of the things I cherish at the moment, we both overthink a ton and she's a bit depressed but not as bad as me so we bond over it and help each other out so I am thankful for that. But that's one of my problems, I have really bad paranoia and I always think the people around me dont like me and that they just take pity on me by talking to me :/"
depression,ffdj6wj,t1_ffdidpi,1579822001.0,"At the moment theres really only a few things, I spend most of my time playing video games done so my whole life, talk to my best friend (that I have a crush on so that's great) and go to my work experience once a week. I dont really know if you can call any of those hobbies.

I use to play a variety of sports, golf, squash, tennis and rugby but a few years ago I stopped caring and put on a lot of weight."
fo4,ffbko3n,t3_esaz56,1579769906.0,I would first off try deactivsting any mods you have to find out if it's your base game or a mod you have installed. Once you find out which is which reinstall that or try verifying game files
fo4,ffbkarx,t3_esqa9c,1579769364.0,Or ya know... just make that a rule to yourself?

A lot of lions dont have a stereotypical mane including all females and young males

Edit: Some females can also have manes, thanks u/I-Am-A-Nice-Cool-Kid"
facepalm,ff2lh83,t3_er8vhv,1579511749.0,Panthers can actually be any type of large cat they aren't their own 'species'.

How many kids have you known that don't understand the consequences of something or just don't understand when to do something. Giving this girl the responsibility of telling her dog when to attack someone that could just be trying to say hello, to me this is scary."

fo4,feu7w4e,t3_eqj4gt,1579383974.0,If its the first time its happened maybe try reinstalling. Every so often my game will start having weird issues (including fps drops) and a reinstall usually fixes everything.
fo4,feu7pfg,t3_eqifjo,1579383904.0,"Yeah, unless you're super in-experienced. Im lvl 65 on my newest chracter and I can kill them in under a second (gatling laser). If you're playing melee only (going from this) they will be slightly harder but as long as you get the right perks and good weapons you'll be fine.

If you need more tips feel free to PM :)"

fo4,fes79eu,t1_fes2ykn,1579362140.0,I don't remember the exact name of the mod but if you google or go on nexus just search mod legendary or something along the lines (I'm on my phone right now can't check myself)

fo4,feomzov,t3_epe28i,1579302450.0,"I've just completed the main game with the brotherhood (about to start going through the DLC) and I used a high strength high intelligence build.

I can get the specifics if you would like in PM but the just is max strength Max intelligence and maybe charisma, charisma isn't as roleplay-esque but I just like having it on all my characters. It's basically a power armour/energy weapon build. I start with using laser musket then when I met danse started using the quest given laser rifle (cant remember the name) then end game I have a gatling laser."
fo4,feomkcf,t3_epgqjq,1579302212.0,"Only thing I can think of is if you use V-sync (ingame fps cap) then you can use a mod that turns it off for load screens however I've never found a way to do it if you cap out of game.

I just moved fallout into my ssd and I can cap fps and load fine."

You said you're on console, I know there are tons of mods for PC to get them but I'm not sure about console. I'd still reccomend checking for any armour/clothing mods that might come with ballistic weave."

fo4,fe0yojl,t3_enl765,1578820410.0,"Well basic questions first, are you using F4SE and are you starting up the game with it?

If you are make sure you have the right mod version and that it isn't conflicting with any of your other mods."
fo4,fdzt0jx,t3_emp22p,1578795103.0,First off I'd start with checking your resolution and all your display settings are correct. Secondly verifying your game through Steam. Thirdly if none of those work a reinstall will fix all the problems it's just tedious.

fo4,fdzsaan,t3_emuikh,1578794606.0,Dog meat. Later game you can just rank them with high END but early on if you see one just tell dogmeat to go on a kamikaze mission.
fo4,fdzry1a,t3_enbzmr,1578794385.0,"Fallout is known for being pretty bad optimized wise. All I can reccomend is deleting old saves. If the issue persists you could try reinstalling fallout or resetting your console.

Sorry if it doesn't help, I play on PC so I only know the fixes for there."
fo4,fdzrq07,t3_engw4n,1578794240.0,"It's usually dependant on your build and preference, I like explosive bullets a lot just because I like knocking off limbs but theres a guide somewhere for the best legendary (you can probably find it with a quick google search)"
fo4,fdyimpw,t3_emz524,1578780141.0,My favourites are either the pier or the Castle. If I'm playing with the minute men i go Castle if not it's the Pier as it's got a nice view and pretty flat

fo4,fdye1qc,t3_en5hr6,1578778715.0,"YouTube is the easiest option. If you use Nexus Mods they should tell you how to install. Also if you use Nexus Mod Manager and install a mod usually it will let the mod manager down load it for you.

If you sont get it just search how to use NMM :)"

medical_advice,fc8c7xa,t1_fc2yixx,1577531638.0,"If you really want to have this argument, from my knowledge and what I see in my post history its not hypocritical at all.

First things, I last used this sub for when my salivary gland was enlarged and after 15 minutes of searching Google I couldn't find anything on it so asked this sub.

Secondly if you actually checked the post I wasnt asking ""is this game 150gb"" I was asking ""is this game really 150gb"" emphasis on the really. If you click on the post you can see that it was me questioning the fact that the game was so much space as a more of a rant.

Thirdly all your symptoms are signs of a cold and the fact you dont know that in you mid-late teens scared me for your general lack of knowledge. It seems you suffer from hyper paranoia but I wont get into the mental."

I'm hoping you're just an ignorant teenager and not THAT lazy. Google is your friend stop thinking you have something wrong with you.

I think you're just not used to it, as you said you're 15 I'm guessing you haven't experienced it before but most people if not all of us get sick like this.

It's likely just a bad case of the common cold, just treat the symptoms with throat soothes and stay hydrated."
