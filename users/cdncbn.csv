Where do they live? Is their house nice? Do they have food in the fridge? What is that guy's job? Is he going to get a paycheque soon? Where will he cash it? Will the money still work? Are grocery stores open? How will he feed his son?

Hackers was fun for a nostalgia kick, but was pretty cringy in parts and did not hold up well at all.    
Sneakers blew me away for not appreciating it nearly as much as it deserved. Especially the knockout ensemble cast. I was only 14 or 15 at the time and had no idea that having Redford, Kingsley, Ackroyd, Phoenix etc meant anything. Hell, James Earl Jones shows up!    
And the movie is great. It's smart and fun and funny and well written, well paced, well directed and well acted.

Your president ordered the assassination of a highly placed official of a sovereign nation that you are not at war with. This assassination took place in a different sovereign nation. 
You know what else could have actually prevented future escalation from a militant extremist?
The Iran Nuclear deal that was quite skillfully crafted by the previous administration. The one that the current president wiped his ass with before throwing away. 
Now Iraq is demanding that you leave, the country that you just dumped billions into. Now Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Now you're 1 misstep away from another Middle East war. 
Nothing about this has been handled pretty well."
