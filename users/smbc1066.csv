Leverage is always an issue especially if directional positions start to move sideways. This is what crushed LTCM. 
Leverage in the repo market is sort of benign. Think about it-you have a security and want to own it but not be out the liquidity. So you repo it to a Cantor Fitzgerald or the like and you only have to fund the haircut which is 50bps or something based on the collateral. If I had to venture what may be the next shoe to drop I would say subprime auto. The risk seems to be percolating through the system much like mortgages did. I think the concept of risk disintermediation is brilliant and an excellent way to free up the balance sheet to either rinse and repeat of do something else. I worked at a REIT in NYC from 2004-2006 and we did about $2Bn a month in CDO's. If one understands the risk and the underlying collateral and detachment points they are a good way to diversify a portfolio. The problem in the case of subprime mortgages was fraud. People making minimum wage should not have gotten $500k mortgages that when they reset would put them in default. This happened across the board. A savvy investor like Paulson recognized this and looked at the vintage and location of these loans and took opposite positions an made a good amount of coin. I think the problem in the case of auto loans is how to get that downside exposure?

finance,feypzw0,t1_fevspud,1579449077.0,"Hey,
I admit I had to look up Triffen Dilemma. I think there are always competing interests-whether short term vs long or ethical vs unethical. 

As for what you wrote, I would look at the machinations in a much broader context of market players. My understanding of the ""Shadow Banking System"" is essentially unregulated players that employ leverage, derivatives, and other esoteric means to generate alpha. Prime example would be hedge funds. I think the supply and demand dynamics of fixed income have been completely undermined and skewed as a result of coordinated interventions by the Fed, ECB, and BofE. Rates should not be this low. The yield curve has inverted multiple times over the past year. It is essentially flat. There is no liquidity premium no matter how far out you go. The desperate hunt for yield by pension funds and portfolio managers has completely distorted risk pricing.
To your point of conflicting narratives, take a look at Italian Sovereign Debt. I am constantly reading about political strife, structural issues related to the banking fabric, and wide spread tax evasion in Italy. Yet, they tap the capital markets at or below the risk free rate for same tenor treasury’s. 
If you remember the crash of 1998 where Russia defaulted and blew up LTCM that was fomented by the Thai Bhat being devalued…..everything is tangentially connected and the next crisis could really start anywhere."
finance,ferquif,t1_ferg79r,1579357298.0,"I passively follow discussions of ""financial plumbing"" so I only noticed a lot of ink about repo facilities and the Fed in December. The Fed should not be involved as it's distorting market fundamentals. This goes for every central bank intervening to keep rates artificially low. It's completely decoupled the yield curve from market dynamics and undermined efficient risk pricing vis-à-vis' the desperate hunt for yield."

It is when they are used for speculation that tits get stuck in the ringer...Corporations and countless banks rely on them for their ability to provide economic value as a hedge as there is always someone that wants to take the other side of the trade. IR Swaps are a great example. CDS too except they have a bad rep because of a few recent incidents where counterparties were manufacturing credit events and gaming the system. This will force new regulatory measures to circumvent this so as to reinstall vigor in the market.
finance,fen0i3x,t1_felmckx,1579274222.0,"I always wonder why people neglect to mention Bear was the first shoe to drop. My boss for a time was the global treasurer there. I think LB and Merrill as well as Bear all ran into a funding issue predicated on the way they were managing their asset liability structures. They were relying on O/N facilities to fund long positions.  There were rumblings about their exposure to CDO's they were holding on their books and the repo counterparties started to have concerns. I was at a primary dealer and one of the repo traders told me Bear would be done in a week. I was shocked and thought he lost his mind. He told me he got a call from UBS or Calyon and Bear was looking for credit and to increase existing lines. This effectively led to a run on the bank so to speak. And just like that they were gone...LB, ML, and countless hedge funds were soon to follow."

I was an associate in IB and it was competitive but I personally never had any issues. There are a couple ways to approach this. You can take him out for a drink and be frank and ask why he is behaving this way. You can, as some have suggested, be better which might be difficult as he has been there longer and has a more robust understanding of the firm itself.
