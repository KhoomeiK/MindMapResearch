Cannabis prefers a wide root structure over depth. 12‚Äù depth is totally sufficient, 20‚Äù+ width.

Topped outdoor plants risk splitting at the trunk, so be sure to consider adding structural support.

Larger containers require a little less attention than smaller ones (hold their water better, much more nutrition in the soil, etc). 

Have fun :)"

Parenting,ff3o49r,t3_er8jvl,1579545210.0,"Question: how much yelling is involved in rushing your kids from one activity to the next?

If your children, at that age, are behaving as you describe, tiredness will be only one factor. More important is the modelled behaviour between activities. I would bet it‚Äôs not all happy times. It‚Äôs probably rush rush, blaming them for being slow, faster faster, etc. Yeah?

Maximum of two activities per season. You are making yourselves insane, and there is almost no benefit for the kids at all if you do more than 3 activities. Is the point ‚Äúto be involved‚Äù or is the point to develop mastery and/or find a passion/interest/hobby?

Basic math ‚Äî your kids already have a full time job, called school. Each activity adds at least an hour, plus travel time. Think of their learning as a job, including extracurriculars ‚Äî their hours of work should not exceed 50 hours. What you describe sounds like close to 60-70 hours of scheduled time. Or, their entire waking life being spent shuttling from one end of the town to the other.

ER Bridges can result in an information paradox, no? Let's assume we find a natural, traversable wormhole, or develop the technology to fold space or build traversable wormholes. The local geometries at either end of the fold are still at vast distances across the ""natural"" spacetime plane, but we manage to merge them into a single point, creating a continuous spacetime curvature between the distant points. If you're looking through the middle of the wormhole at its entrance, it will look like the light travelled as it normally does through spacetime. But if you look to the side of the wormhole (several years or so later), the ship will appear to have appeared out the other end of the wormhole however many lightyears away the exit is, producing a vast difference in the apparent time and causality.

The violation of the information law is only an apparent breaking of the physical law, though, depending on the observer frame. This assumes a reference frame that cannot see the wormhole -- this is where the information loss exists, but only because the causal origin can't be observed. The no-hiding theorem would suggest that the information need to rectify the paradox should still exist, though.

If we assume an observing reference frame that is equidistant from both the entrance and exit of the wormhole, the light from both points would reach the observer at the same time. That observer should be able to construct the information to ascertain that the appearing object at the exit was the disappearing object at the entrance, and rectify the paradox.

More confusing would be if the entrance and exits of a wormhole are spherical, where the angle of viewing is not relevant, such that they can be looked directly through from any vantage. That would be even harder to parse, because then the observer that can see both the entrance and exit and can observe the ship going into and out of the wormhole through both the entrance and exit simultaneously. The two regions of space will appear to be both separate and conjoined, simultaneously. The entrance frame would be able to show you light from the exit frame at the same time, and vice versa. Each point would probably look something like those deep-field shots where a gravitational lens makes circle of galaxies. There would appear to be a large volume of space within the volume of space, creating really weird geometries in the perspective, but appearing all as a continuous plane/spacetime volume."

MMJ,fetmmm0,t3_eqkpu1,1579376908.0,"I‚Äôve been trying CBD (in MCT) for depression and I‚Äôve concluded that it has been contributing to/amplifying my depression.

The research is quite limited, and it has been shown to both help and hurt. It seems to depend greatly on how the CBD was extracted, for one, and by individual, and by strain (for whole-flower extraction).

In an experiment on mice, using the ‚Äúchuck them in the pool‚Äù stress test, a single dosage of 300mg showed de-stressing effects within the first 30 mins and the effect lasted for a little over seven days. The effect was said to be equal to a long term, balanced antidepressant. 

I‚Äôve tried dosages at 20mg, 50mg, and at the 300mg. The most positive feeling came at 20 mg, but I couldn‚Äôt really ‚Äúfeel‚Äù that it was the CBD (might‚Äôve just been a good day, each day I tried). The 300 was the last I tried and (whilst other factors were present), I had one of the _worst_ and longest-lasting depressive episodes of my adult life. Every day I felt incredibly lethargic, unable to smile, completely unproductive at work. I would need to lay down (completely ignoring my family) every day for a week and a half.

So it either caused or contributed to the episode, or did nothing. I don‚Äôt know if the CBD was a factor, given the existing depression (I‚Äôm going to try both a low and high dosage again to see). Either way, so far it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping me much, and may be making this worse. But dosage _does_ seem to be a component.

It‚Äôs possible the de-stressing effect is more of a ‚Äúdeadening‚Äù effect. In the endocannabinoid system, perhaps too much of it creates some dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It‚Äôs not well understood, so it‚Äôs hard to say. 

To your specific question, when I‚Äôve used/increased CBD I find that sleep is simply not restful. And that alone could be why my depression seems worse when I‚Äôm on it.

Hope that helps in some way. This voluntarily self-administered experiment will continue..."
ontario,felvwg5,t1_felt2ph,1579232254.0,"To be clear, not at all a social problem, and good for the health of our industries. But in terms of wage inflation, the requirement of ‚Äúat or above average‚Äù for high salaries is problematic. Generally once you‚Äôre up over $150k annually, the salary factors start to be based on percentages over stepped figures, so the at/above requirement means foreign workers arrive at salary par with employees who have put a few years into a company first. Within a year or two, that level will pay out at a higher percentage to level out relative to the structured role (say, something really structured like a Big 4 firm). This, in turn, affects the base starting rate.

As a result, the wage gap is growing, and it is felt in urban centres like Toronto particularly. The OECD identified this as a factor in Canada‚Äôs record high wage gap back in 2011. 

In Toronto this translates into the business core employees owning single dwelling residential within public transit distance to the city core, and you see massive housing inflation as a result. It‚Äôs seen as a secure investment, so these ludicrously overpriced properties still move. Meanwhile, it has pushed out service sector employees beyond where they can reasonably commute from. So then their wages have to go up. Rinse, repeat."
ontario,felkqb8,t1_felawcf,1579224512.0,"Exactly. The system is well designed to protect Canadians. It‚Äôs prohibitively expensive and painfully slow. Yes, it has some problems.

It gets politicized every election, though.

Canadians would be stunned to learn just how many TFWs there are in the higher income sectors. It‚Äôs actually a far bigger problem than any attention it ever gets for its effect on wages."
ontario,fel2gjr,t1_fekvxfp,1579212616.0,"Hence the design of the program with the requirement that temporary workers be paid at or above the average. Though not necessarily completely effective, many other employment sectors complain that the TFWP drives wages up too high."

Seriously: the point of the article you posted is that CBTU wants there to be an oversight and enforcement wing of CIC because they‚Äôre worried the program revisions designed to make it easier for high-needs sectors to get volumes of unskilled labour quickly will create the _opportunity_ for abuse. (I find little to disagree with there.) You said that article argued against my points, but the CBTU‚Äôs statement largely agrees with the need for and importance of the TFWP, in keeping with how I described it."
ontario,fekva3u,t1_feksvqr,1579208323.0,"Ahem: ‚Äú‚ÄòWe acknowledge the fact that in some sectors, for example, like the agricultural sector, labour supply has been a challenge and in order to meet critical demands is a necessary solution ‚Äî we have no issue with that.‚Äô

Furthermore, she said, when the skilled trades reach the saturation point the CBTU is cognizant that it needs to address legitimate skills shortages and has been working with the government to solve the problem.‚Äù

And: ‚ÄúUnscrupulous contractors are continuously looking at opportunities to bring in cheap and unskilled labour into Canada, the CBTU states, and construction will be ripe for possible abuse if proper safeguards are not in place.‚Äù

Note the statement ‚Äúpossible abuse‚Äù ‚Äî not _existing_ abuses. This is a statement about revisions saying the governments modifications do not create an oversight or enforcement wing of CIC to protect the construction industry from the possibility of abuse. (Canada doesn‚Äôt have an equivalent to ICE ‚Äî just the RCMP.)

They make many points about businesses needing the TFWP and it being vital for Canada. The CBTU is simply saying that there needs to be enforcement of the rules (which is true, certainly) especially in the unskilled pool.

ontario,fekqx7t,t1_fekkq7t,1579205761.0,"That‚Äôs not how immigration law for unskilled or skilled labour in Canada works. To obtain a TFW (temporary foreign worker) Permit in the skilled labour class, the foreign workers _have to_ be paid at or above the average salary in that field and position level and argue that this person is more qualified than the Canadians who applied (and therefore deserves to be paid as such), OR the employer has to demonstrate that no Canadians applied for the position and prove there is a labour shortage. And even then, the skilled foreign worker has to be paid at or above the average salary. This called an LMO (labour market opinion).

For unskilled labour, such as oil sands grunts or seasonal agricultural labour, the latter process must also be followed by applying for an LMO. Wages must still be paid at or above the local average.

It‚Äôs fun to complain about foreign workers causing the lowering of wages, but that‚Äôs not actually a significant cause ‚Äî not in Canada. In other countries with different laws, it might be the case. But in Canada, this process is designed to specifically prevent employers from driving down wages by hiring foreign.

I‚Äôm not saying it works perfectly, just that you‚Äôre seeing a causal relationship that isn‚Äôt there. Employers seek for the lowest wage as a matter of basic corporate law. Corporations are required to post profits, and human labour is the single highest cost to any corporation. Wages are lower because over the past 30 years or so we have shifted from about 70% permanent full time employment to 70% contract labour in the labour market. 

Capitalism is why your wages get lowered and stagnate, not competition from foreign workers. The foreign worker program in Canada actually drives wages _up._"
