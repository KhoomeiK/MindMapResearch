speedrun,feypleg,t1_feyn6dc,1579448800.0,So I as a person could write it off my tax? Well I can´t where I live because we don´t have that but if I lived in the USA I mean.
Kickboxing,feyehhc,t1_fewpg4w,1579444385.0,Pro tip: Do not try to headbutt knees. I mean it is allowed. But not recommended.
FoodPorn,fem8hz4,t1_felgt3m,1579243614.0,I could probably eat both plates without much issue. And right now I would damn like to! Looks delicious.
stockholm,fem746z,t3_epryqc,1579242129.0,"Lived in Solna a few years. Moved to Stockholm and ended up in Solna. Love it. I first lived close to Näckrosen and now moved to Solna Centrum. It is mostly calm except for when there is soccer events. I have never felt unsafe even then. 

We are young couple and feels like that is quite common. 

The only thing we miss is forests. There are park with water and green areas. Very nice walking/biking/running places. But we miss the closeness to real nature. But living this close to Stockholm it is impossible. 

A lot of good restaurants. Shopping for almost everything. Great communication to most places."
Kickboxing,fem33j3,t1_fel17bo,1579238154.0,Ah yeah. That sounds likely
Kickboxing,feksbc9,t1_fekpzoe,1579206574.0,">gym shield

What is a gym shield?"
Fantasy,fej8qkp,t3_ep7gu9,1579161760.0,"Sure sound like a fresh way to start a book. My father works with taxes. Much of it is to find like illegal activities, tax frauds etc. Actually very interesting to hear how criminals find new ways to find loopholes and take advantage of the system. I can see a fantasy setting where a tax collector find something.

Or just a funny book or series where a tax collector goes around with heroes all around him but he just want the taxes for that reward they got killing a dragon or whatever."
FPGA,feglkj7,t1_fegjdpe,1579096514.0,"You can buy one I think from iC Haus China. I found some guy who had some code on Github and BiSS was one of the protocol supported. 

I also implemented a SPI master recently for which there were a ton of examples available. I picked one and modified for our needs. Which is why I thought I was missing something about the protocol when the only IP I was finding I had to buy. I get that for things like EtherCAT and more advanced protocols. 

I will read up more on the protocol and make my own I guess."
Fantasy,fed9inb,t3_eoeiuh,1579004703.0,"**The Riftwar Cycle** by Raymond E. Feist I would say fit the bill. Starts with the trilogy ""Riftwar Saga"" and the first book is Magician. And about them weird names. Main character is named Pug. 

I do not know how many years the entire book series spans but kids will grow up and become grandfathers and die of old age before it is done."
Kickboxing,feaivfa,t3_eo49no,1578949400.0,If it works sure. But most of that breakfast will be in your stomach during your first workout and hell even your second. I say you are mostly using what you stored up during both early workouts. Focus more on carbs early and protein after. That late 10 pm dinner(?) is what gives you the energy I would say.
educationalgifs,fe9ulci,t1_fe8wjpa,1578941596.0,"It is mostly only used in baking and maybe for frying. Well we have ""butter"" for bread that often is margarine or something between margarine and butter."
educationalgifs,fe7lg6n,t1_fe7gqbl,1578916149.0,"I guess some don´t really appreciate the difference in taste. For me it would be one of the last things I would pick when I started saving money. 

It has a purpose for vegans or vegetarians that avoid milk products. But a lot of margarine is not vegan. And it has to be a small percentage of people buying it because of that."
educationalgifs,fe780d4,t1_fe75i8b,1578911163.0,Cheap. Margarine in Sweden cost less than 1/3 of butter. Had to check since I can´t remember the last time I bought margarine.
AskReddit,fe718i2,t1_fe53zwz,1578908658.0,Wow I have that one. Bought it cheap in a yard sale years and years back. Did not know it was rare.

audiobooks,fdwuy2k,t3_en99xr,1578762555.0,I am listening to it right now and was a bit confused in the beginning but they make sense when you listen to it.
audiobooks,fdprtbh,t3_emleof,1578638040.0,"Not best books. Best audiobooks that stands out because of narrator.

Harry Potter by Stephen Fry

Also: **Dresden Files** by James Masters, **A Christmas Carol** by Tim Curry, **Discworld** by both Nigel Planer and Stephen Briggs. Celia Imrie does a great job as well but not the same level."
insomnia,fdpr7o4,t3_emi84y,1578637416.0,"I have one. Only problem is that the times my partner changes the duvet in our bed she refuses to change it on mine since it weighs to much! :) 

It does not really help my insomnia though. But I like the feeling of it."
Marvel,fdmsdag,t1_fdmqm7x,1578563405.0,"I have a Deadpool compression shirt during kickboxing classes and I have gotten a lot of ""Cool Spider-man shirt!"" but zero Deadpool references."
audiobooks,fdjyopk,t3_elkife,1578491579.0,"In Sweden we have Storytel. About 16 Euro / 17.8 USD per month for their entire library. Like Spotify or Netflix. Sure if a book gets removed you loose it since you don´t own the books. Just like Netflix.

It can also be shared though i don´t think that is officially supported. I use my moms account sometimes."
Kickboxing,fdjc92w,t3_elk0xy,1578465013.0,Stop planning and start training. You don´t need to be able to kick higher to join. They will teach you to kick higher. You will build muscle that help lift your leg and you will become more flexible.
icecreamery,fdi11jl,t3_elcqhi,1578433835.0,If your cheap ice cream maker is one of those you free the container or part in the freezer instead of a compressor type. Then make sure your ice cream base is as cold as possible before starting. Let it cool in the fridge until it reaches fridge temperature. Also good idea to do for any ice cream machine but extra important for that kind.
stockholm,fdgbv77,t3_el94ug,1578389158.0,December 24-26 and 31 and as well as January 1 and 6 were public holiday. So no mail on those days. And no handling of mails or deliveries. Post service is also overburdened during Christmas by all gifts being delivered so everything can be a bit delayed.
Kickboxing,fdefz7w,t3_ekuy5e,1578338195.0,It takes time to absorb food. Eat 2-3 hours before your workout. Digestion slows down during exercise. It does not stop though but better to load up before.
AskReddit,fd9ymar,t3_ekalqa,1578239669.0,5 sessions of kickboxing.
chocolate,fd0w7z8,t3_eiu010,1578124600.0,As regular milk chocolate. Fazer is the winner imho. I don´t think they have a great sampler box of their products but I highly recommend their Salty Toffee Crunch. Not sure which countries they are available though.
chocolate,fd0vo24,t3_ejq2uh,1578124381.0,Women. But as a man I do my best to balance the statistics.
insomnia,fcwvqk0,t3_ej5bv7,1578039628.0,"I exercise a lot. Kickboxing many times a week. Other kinds of exercise on top of that. Bike to work. I walk about 20 000 steps every day. I don't sleep like a baby. It has been years since my last episode of extreme insomnia. I am also a lot healthier now. And found out that kickboxing is damn fun! 

Due to injuries there have been periods where I have not been able to exercise and it does get worse. So I think it helps. Just not as a miracle cure."
gamernews,fcwtwzh,t1_fcwaa5w,1578037455.0,I hope they can be used as Push To Talk. And some way of forcing people who have bad mics to use Push To Talk.
AskReddit,fcwtj4n,t1_fcvmk8o,1578037006.0,They explained this very clear when I did military service. It still explodes and spew out burning wood. Up to 1 meter (3 feet) is considered lethal. There were stories about a guy trying to be funny and aiming at his head pretending to commit suicide. The guy survived but he was fucked up. Another guy wanted to hurt himself a bit to get out of military service so he aimed at his foot and fired. Got out of military service. Had to amputate his lower leg as well.
Kickboxing,fcwtabw,t3_ej8osv,1578036719.0,"No free trial is a bit weird at least here. But maybe because there is a lot of competition between gyms. But at least ask if you can watch so it is not a McDojo or cardio kickboxing only. Ask how often they have sparring sessions. If the answer is never, then never is the time to join that gym. 

Is it $95 per month if you subscribe for a year? Or can you stop after a month? If you can stop I would say try it for a month.

As for age, weight etc. I started when I was 28. Been doing it for 7 years now. I am known as the Duracell bunny at my gym. My lowest recorded resting BPM is 37 a few weeks ago. At a health checkup they said my oxygen consumption is on par with the Swedish national soccer team. I have competed and won a few matches.

I love it. Can't wait to get of work today for a 1 hour session.

Trained with a guy with a prosthetic leg. No he was not allowed to kick with it. I have trained with people who could add a pizza or two to their diet and people who were overweight. Anyone can do it."
AskReddit,fctyet2,t1_fctvjig,1577965728.0,Yeah I know. I am never buying diamonds. Well maybe those synthetic ones.
AskReddit,fctuswe,t1_fctorb1,1577960638.0,Well diamonds are a kind of rock.
Kickboxing,fctq535,t3_ehyngt,1577953784.0,"Only do light contact sparring and you should be fine. 

The ones to look out for are other beginners. A huge muscle mountain of a kickboxer that have been kickboxing for years will be less likely to cause head trauma than a new kickboxer with little control. It is easy to do headkicks if you put a lot of force into it. It is hard to stop the kick from connecting hard when you notice the opponents guard is down midway through the kick."
Kickboxing,fctpync,t3_eiszq4,1577953534.0,"What do you want to achieve? What are your goals with kickboxing? Age, sex and physical build don´t tell us much if you should be doing kickboxing instead of something else. 

Since kickboxing is great for most the general answer is of course ""Yes"". But if your goal is for example becoming a great long distance runner. Then sure kickboxing will give you better stamina but there are better ways."
Cheese,fctlp8q,t3_eir1bq,1577947971.0,What is that red log in the left end? By the Oreos.
Suikoden,fcjk4dp,t1_fcgc90e,1577690812.0,The series if more dead than Neclord killed twice. Konami made sure to get the Star Dragon Sword and properly kill the series.
Kickboxing,fcjjeqs,t3_egtq7b,1577689939.0,">This coach has never trained a competitive fighter but assures me he can train me. 

This is what would bother me most. Ok I would want my coach to have competed some and was active in sparring. But some are better coaches than competitors. So a coach that does not compete but have coached a lot of fighters that have competed would be fine. But if he has never trained a competitive fighter I would look for someone else."
technology,fcginbl,t1_fcgbbg5,1577640443.0,Better than chili flavoured lava. That would be too hot.
chocolate,fbto9zd,t1_fbqh2fx,1577087228.0,Yes but what bean is the powder from? Or what brand of powder?
