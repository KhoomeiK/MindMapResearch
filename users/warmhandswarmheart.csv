But if the slave lives for a few days and THEN dies, well then they are off the hook.   It instructs people when they have to free Hebrew slaves; so they should allow them to marry because even if they have to free a Hebrew slave they don't have to free his family and some of them will stay in bondage voluntarily.   Yea, so your god didn't invent slavery but he sure didn't condemn it either.  Otherwise one of the commandments would have been, ""Thou shalt not own other human beings as Chattel.

This happened to Susan Nelles, a nurse in the intensive care unit at Toronto's hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada.   There was an increase in deaths of infants over several months.   She was on staff for most of the deaths but there was no other evidence against her.  There were photographs of her on TV and newspapers of her being led out in handcuffs.   There was an investigation and not only did they not find her guilty, they concluded that no crimes were committed.   At the same time the deaths started, the hospital started admitting more infants that were in more critical condition.   The deaths were found to be from natural causes.   Meanwhile this poor woman's reputation was completely dragged through the mud.

Edit.  Looked up the case on Wikipedia and apparently I'm wrong.  This case is still considered  unsolved homicides.  I'm not sure if I'm misremembering or if the article is wrong.
