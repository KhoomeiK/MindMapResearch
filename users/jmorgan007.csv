IAmA,cq5e3yp,t3_31c0tu,1428506261.0,"Why isn't there a voucher included for every stylus pen purchased for a free fabrick pen loop of the users color choice?

So the curent Surface 3 keyboard covers no longer have a manafacured pen loop. Instead this has become a $5.00 accessory with double stick adhesive backing.

I get it some will decide to stick it to the keyboard cover in the original location where others will decide to stick it to the back of the Surface on the right or bottom side where there is no side buttons.

This is why there should be a voucher with each pen sold for the user to pick the color pen loop they desire with out having to pay extra for this.

Why should we be expected to pony up another $5.00 for a feature that should be built into the unit or at least included in the box?"
