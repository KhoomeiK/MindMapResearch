The IRS uses 1099-K to determine, based on statistical analyses, what the likely business income/receipts you have earned using electronic payments. If your business income and/or receipts are not what the IRS expects, they will try to impute additional income for your return and send you a notice of proposed assessment.

All you‚Äôll need to do is send a letter to the address listed on the notice basically explaining that your 1099-K receipts are all nontaxable rebates from cash back. Hopefully you don‚Äôt get a notice from the IRS, but it‚Äôs definitely a possibility."

Once I stopped going, I started realizing that some of the teachings of the church are kind of unrealistic, and now I consider myself agnostic.

Although I am more or less agnostic, I still look back at the church as an overall positive experience: I learned positive morals and spirituality, and it made me believe that the world is a good place during my childhood, which is absolutely crucial during a child‚Äôs development. Those values are also something that people wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be exposed to otherwise. 

If I have kids in the future, I would probably raise them the same way, even though I don‚Äôt really follow the teachings of the church, simply because it teaches children valuable morals that will serve them later in the future.
