GetMotivated,fdbxbgr,t1_fdbx24p,1578263397.0,"Hey man sounds like you’ve been goin through it. My advice would be to stay active. It’s really crazy how exercise and fresh air can just make your overall outlook on life a little better. I’ve been dealing with some drug issues since my brother died last year, but after some counseling I’ve been doing a lot of yoga and it’s really helped honestly. I still smoke weed but I dropped other shit. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube is a good resource if you’re interested, she has a 30 day dedicate series that you can follow."
