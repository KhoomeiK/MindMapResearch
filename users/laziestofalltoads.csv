iPadPro,ff8qojo,t3_es7f19,1579692104.0,"I have 3 kinds of macs (Mac mini, MacBook pro, MacBook Air), two iPad mini‚Äôs and an original iPad Pro from 2015.  I love the iPad Pro and it‚Äôs the one device (other than my iPhone 8) that I use every day. I really want to upgrade to the latest one, but can‚Äôt justify it, because it‚Äôs still going strong! 

The last Mac I bought was the MacBook Pro and I almost instantly regretted it; it‚Äôs really (compared to the Air) heavy, was expensive and just doesn‚Äôt feel as good to use. My uses for Macs are really just browsing and the occasional word doc, as I have to use a PC for work. The iPad Pro is my work companion, where I write notes, review docs, type notes during meetings (on an external keyboard/case), so that my typing doesn‚Äôt drown out others on Skype calls (I work from home). 

Unless there are apps you really can‚Äôt run on the iPad Pro, get one. They are awesome. Actually, get one anyway; you‚Äôll find yourself making ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô to use it. üòÜ"

keyboards,fe5polj,t3_eh0792,1578872705.0,"Update: I ended up buying a TKL keyboard by Havit from Amazon; it was on sale for $59 and I used some points to pay less than that.

It only has one color backlight (ice blue), but I‚Äôm fine with that. I‚Äôm enjoying it and not bothered by the click at all. 

What I will say is that it has this slightly annoying ‚Äòmusical‚Äô ping after the click and I‚Äôm wondering if that is evidence of lesser quality metal components somewhere. Maybe if I had spent more, I would get that?  Anyway, I‚Äôm getting used to it now and find myself typing a little faster. The feel of it is just what I was looking for!
