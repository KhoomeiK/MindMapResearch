AskReddit,fe08v07,t1_fdyvkz5,1578806278.0,"Arborio rice. Put 4 cups of chicken or veggie broth in a pot on the stove and warm up. 

Toast rice in a very small amount of butter/olive oil over medium heat, basically until a little bit translucent. 

Add a couple pats of butter, onion or shallots and coat, cooking until the onion/shallot softens.

Start spooning in broth a 1/2 cup at a time. Don’t disturb too much at first, then stir to help distribute. Yes, you need to stir throughout, but don’t stir all the time. You want to stir, rest, stir, rest, and suss out the absorption. Once the the liquid seems mostly absorbed, add more. I like having music on, wine (or drink of choice) at the ready, and I just hang out in the kitchen.

Keep doing this until the rice is nearly the toothines you want. YOU have control over this. Taste taste taste, test test test. When you feel it is just on the cusp of done, add a few more pats of butter and absorb that. Throw in some herbs and/or some cheese, mix and you should be golden!

This obviously doesn’t take into account other ingredients, but if you’re just trying to get the rice itself right, a simple, plain risotto is just fine.

For me? Butter was the key. I had the best risotto at a restaurant once, asked for tips from the chef, and that was basically their answer. When I started using more butter, and not overly stirring (so the rice absorbs the moisture more, rather than it evaporating too quickly), I rocked risotto. I consider it one of my signature dishes now!
