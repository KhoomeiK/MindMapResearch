In the end, the couple just decided to use the wedding money to move to another city and buy a house, the wedding never happened but they're still together and have a baby. The bridezilla spirit left her LOL"

Well, he can build a brick wall on his side and paint something that his wife likes.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ff2zfrh,t1_ff2uc3c,1579529490.0,">what's the point of complaining about noise at checkout? 

I've had many guests complain about little things, or make stuff up, in order to get a discount later (some even expect to not pay at all). I know in some countries it's all prepaid, but here it can vary. Many guests prepay only the 1st day and the rest is paid at checkout. The things people will try to get out of paying is absurd."

I'm low contact with my siblings. If they suddenly realize the extent of their homophobia and how much they've hurt me over the years, that wouldn't change a thing for me. Good for them for becoming better people, but still not going to make me simply pretend nothing happened."
