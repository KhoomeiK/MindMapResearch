They really do grow up so fast! But I’ll tell you what - it was when I had to post bail the first time that I thought, “He really is a man, now.” And sadly that’s when I had to let my Mr. Peepers go.

Hey. At some point they have to learn."

I’m a bad ass cat, and my vet calls me Cleo 
This last minute rap is for you and from me, yo!

I love those pretty ribbons, up under the tree
But my very favorite part, is when you snuggle me!

Even though I’ve just admitted, my deepest darkest secret
Don’t ever let your guard down, lest you might regret it

‘Cuz I put the litter in Christmas glitter, bruh! Yeah, you heard me!
I’ll also put a cap in your ass, some fur in your glass, and then —


Oh, wait. I misread your post. Last minute *W*rapping. Not *R*apping. Got it. Much more innocuous the way you posted it. And more image/caption/holiday appropriate, as well. Apologies."
cats,fbzw8gp,t3_ef2hla,1577264967.0,"That’s wonderful! Congratulations, you. Baby steps... I’m certain you’ll achieve your goal and you’ll help this cat live a happier, healthier, safer life. 

Crazy thought I’ve been having, myself as I’ve been feeding and slowly gaining the trust of about 15-20 or so odd street cats (long story), and while this isn’t at all possible for me, I wonder if you might be able to somehow broadcast cat purrs to your little one? Hear me out. 

I’d read that the frequency of the cat purr in some way correlates to healing or comfort or an important kitten stage of growth or some such thing? After my cat back home had two consecutive surgeries, I’d play three hours of nonstop cat purr videos on YouTube while he slept on my chest and while I thought the little stinker was out cold I’d attempt to turn my phone off, but just when I’d try, he’d open his eyes, stare me down until I turned it back up, and only until the purrs were back up would he doze off again. I really did convince myself that he was comforted by the sound of it.

Anyhow. I wonder if perhaps this (or else Barry White, obviously) might help to win over the little one’s trust? If you have Netflix, check out The Lion in the Living Room. There’s a segment in their documentary on this phenomena that I’d forgotten about that you might find interesting. Anyhow. Best of luck."
cats,fbyccjw,t3_ef3wyi,1577213356.0,That. Is. Hilarious. Both the wrapping job and the cat’s achievement. Christmas cheers all around!
