EDIT/UPDATE: I went through the online system and looked at the appointment overview. It said the only thing I was administered was ""levonorgestrel"" which I googled and it's the Liletta.

I am sad for her kids that they've never had that.

But then again, they are garbage humans, so."
bipolar,fddn42x,t1_fddl8p0,1578318351.0,100% agree. Well put.
bipolar,fddn1u4,t3_ektrp3,1578318295.0,"Yes this drives me up the wall. Not to be preachy (I hate that shit) but when you really think about it, it is appropriation. 

When people say ‚Äúahh I‚Äôm so hyper I‚Äôm totally manic‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make up my mind! I‚Äôm so bipolar right now‚Äù it pisses me off! This is a very serious illness, not a verb. 

Recently an actress described a solo cross country trip she took after ending a years long show and how it was life changing and she described all of her emotions. She said: ‚ÄúI was a bit of a mess: heartbroken, a touch manic, quite lost, etc.‚Äù

I did some research and she does not have bipolar disorder. 

I was really upset about it because she has NO IDEA what she‚Äôs talking about! Just because you‚Äôre experiencing a range of emotions doesn‚Äôt mean you can claim you are experiencing something that comes exclusively with bipolar disorder, which is a very serious illness!

Mania is not an emotion like feeling lost or heartbroken... Don‚Äôt take my illness and use it to describe the way you are feeling...especially for likes on Instagram!!

It really steams my beans. 

When I hear people say things like this IRL My instant impulse is to call them out on it but don‚Äôt. Maybe I should start. 

End rant."
bipolar,fddlc2n,t1_fddhj64,1578316649.0,"Yes. You might be on the wrong meds. The right cocktail makes a world of difference. The biggest zombie offenders for me were abilify, latuda, lithium, Remeron and seroquel. Maybe ask your doctor if you can make some changes, if you‚Äôre stable enough to do so.
Good luck!"

There was confession and public acknowledgement involved, but no legal action. 

I wonder if this is something to be pursued."
DuggarsSnark,fdbfngv,t1_fdb0mxd,1578256908.0,That‚Äôs a nice dream. Can we add Gothard to that list too?
