relationship_advice,ff9j0c5,t3_esf36a,1579714039.0,"Do not allow this small person to derail your life goals. Talk to the professor. This girl is not a teacher and shouldnt be the one you ask to explain things anyway - that is not her job and, not to defend her rudeness, but she might be frustrated feeling like she has to teach as well as learn. You both would benefit from a new team up and from now on, go to your professor with questions on understanding the material. That's their job, not the other students."

funny,ff1mxhv,t3_er4ynn,1579481836.0,I find this incredibly endearing. They look so happy to get tacos together. This is love.
AmItheAsshole,ff1m3q9,t3_er4zuu,1579481436.0,"NTA - ""Excuse me, I dont like to be in conversations where I need to shout to be heard or not interrupted. I'll be in the other room."" It is always acceptable to remove yourself from situations where you arent being respected. Be calm and clear  and then stick to your guns - if you're shouted over next time, do the same thing. Maybe even add, ""I'm interested in your thoughts. When you can be civil, I'd be happy to continue the conversation."" Good luck."

getdisciplined,feti1pl,t1_fese12k,1579375624.0,"Funnily enough, I JUST got tested for it. My therapist (who did the test) is waiting for some feedback from my partner to determine if I have ADHD or ADD, but the deficient attention is in there for sure. I am female as well, and almost 30. I got the initial diagnosis a week or so before Christmas, so we haven't yet delved into it too hard, but it's next on the agenda.  


It's kinda nice to know that some of my weird ticks actually stem from something and aren't just me being a flakey loser. Did you have the same experience?"
getdisciplined,fethewf,t1_feqw9va,1579375505.0,Thank you! I appreciate the support and offer for further help. You'll most likely be hearing from me soon.

For writing it is definitely about not being good enough. Cooking is similar. I'm not great at it and I tend to forget what I'm doing and sometimes get bored and just wander away (v. Bad when the stove is involved). I also always feel like cooking takes FOREVER. Anything longer than microwave time feels, to me, like a huge temporal burden on my day. These are things I will bring up with my therapist. Thanks for the suggestions!"
getdisciplined,fessfml,t1_feqccam,1579368546.0,"Thank you so much for your input. The thing about your brain remembering you broke the contract is an eye opener for me. I break contracts with myself all the time and every time I do it just makes it easier to do it next time.

I will be writing a really crappy story later from your last piece of advice. I think giving myself permission to suck for a bit is something I need to work on
 Thanks again!"
getdisciplined,fess0eg,t1_feprnwy,1579368412.0,I'm a big reader so I will definitely check those out. I appreciate your input very much and I agree that this is probably just about learning new coping with the fear of fear. Thank you!

GilmoreGirls,fepsc9w,t3_eq6q1o,1579329607.0,My guess is that they show that guy to establish how much of a hard no Lorelai usually gives dads of her daughter's classmates/people who are associated with Rory's schooling. Max is supposed to be a huge outlier for Lorelai's dating behavior. That's why he's special.

StardewValley,fe9k502,t1_fe7uf9u,1578938578.0,"Yes! It has been available for a while though. This is my first one I've gotten on Steam, but I have gotten a couple on PS4 before 1.3 or 1.4. It's a really good reason to keep participating in the Feast of the Winter Star!  


Most characters can give it, however Jas, Vincent, Clint, Evelyn, Robin, Willy, and Marnie don't. Your Secret Gift-Giver is decided in the game when you get assigned your Secret Friend for the Year a week before the festival, so unfortunately you can't get a new person or a new gift by restarting the day. Just keep giving a gift every year and eventually you'll get it! Good luck."

StardewValley,fe439xm,t3_enoozt,1578855369.0,"I have a separate save file from my usual game that I call ""One Step Farm."" In it, I just do one thing at a time, and when that thing is done, I end the day. Right now I am just clearing trees. When all the trees are cleared for the day, I go to bed. I play this save when I am anxious and it calms me down, where as my other save files can get stressful.  


It takes away a lot of the rushed feelings and stress of wanting to finish everything as quickly as possible - this game is huge. I've played for a total of over 2000 hours - 1000 on PS4 and over 1000 on Steam, and I still haven't done everything possible. Find your favorite thing in the game to do, and just let yourself do that."
relationship_advice,fe0k94b,t3_enkc58,1578814853.0,"Yeah, this isn't a betrayal. She did not want a relationship with you. She does want a relationship with him. It has nothing to do with you. People change how they feel about relationships all the time, and it is a personal and internal decision to which you are not privy nor are you involved."
relationship_advice,fe0jlk2,t3_enkeeh,1578814473.0,"I just saw what age you too are, you need to break up with her and fast. If this is what her judgement looks like on parenting, it's probably not great in any other area, and you do not want to be around her when her decisions make her life go tits up."
relationship_advice,fe0jgmp,t1_fe0glkd,1578814383.0,I agree. People should be asking other people's permission before posting pictures of them to social media anyway.
relationship_advice,fe0jcrh,t3_enkeez,1578814320.0,"I think a lot of this depends on how bad of a friend she was to you. I have been hurt by some of the people in my life keeping in casual contact with truly toxic and abusive people, but only really if they'd heard what they did to me and still think they deserve ""politeness.""  


However, if the friendship was just that you two didn't get along anymore for the normal reasons that people fight and grow apart, then I think you might need to get over it. Either way, you can't tell anyone who to be friends with, even your mom, but maybe having an honest, in depth discussion with her about how painful it is for you to think of your ex-friend as in any way connected to your life anymore will provide some insight for her. It may not, though, and that's just life, I'm afraid. Good luck."
