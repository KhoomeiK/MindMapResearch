GarenMains,fe1zbre,t1_fe17z9s,1578832675.0,"Riven is another good example. On paper she's harder than Garen, but actually she's easier because she's really hard to punish if she messes up and her main combo has little counterplay.

If Garen messes up he dies. He has no mobility and no free get out of jail tools.

It's also much harder for him to apply his damage."

Dariusmains,fddrjsc,t3_ekkckp,1578322110.0,"Vayne or Fiora. You can't outplay either of them. Vayne just brainlessly right clicks on you for very balanced %maxhp true damage and between her invisibility and spammable Q and targetted stun / knockback you'll never get to her.

Her whole kit is braindead with zero counterplay yet people still talks about Vayne ""mechanics"" lmao.

Fiora is similar but she's melee so slightly more outplayable. Slightly. And you'll face her in lane more often. For that reason I personally ban her over Vayne but both are super cancer to play against.

Tryndamere is toxic but you can outplay him. Start W and kite him if he goes on you lvl 1. Zone him early. Then later never start fights. Kite him with W and E when he commits on you. Don't trade autos. Fight him at mid range. Rush Tabis and Randuin. Use active and your CCs to kite him during his ult. Ult early, they rarely expect it.

Akali cannot really be outplayed but if you kite her she'll never kill you and you outscale. She also rarely wins games on her own.

Morde you take short trades and trade E for E. Don't commit if he has shield. Buy QSS if needed. Farm lane unless he messes up. Either of you snowballs hard on a gank tho."
FA30plus,fddlkas,t3_ejqrt8,1578316881.0,"I'm the opposite. I don't mind having no friends but I'd like to have a significant other. However my experiences with women were catastrophic so now I've given up on that too.

leagueoflegends,fd9ogn5,t1_fd9nu58,1578236001.0,Yeah it's not even comparable. You can still farm because you're ranged and you have a support to help you. You clearly don't play toplane.
leagueoflegends,fd9m46v,t1_fd9jxyw,1578235251.0,"You can be oppressive and offer a terribly unfun experience and still don't have the best winrate. Nasus is a good example of this. He gets 6 with sheen and you can't duel him anymore or do anything.

1) The fear of failing and ending up a cripple

ForeverAlone,fcz0x4x,t3_ejc42d,1578091452.0,"I'm 30 and I accomplished nothing in my entire life.

I'm poor.

I don't have a career. I work shitty minwage jobs.

I have a very boring personality, because I've been used to being alone for way too long so I didn't grow adequate social skills.

I have no friends and no social circle.

I'm bored when I'm amongst people but I feel suicidal when I'm alone.

I hate small talk and have zero skill in it.

I have zero sex drive.

I'm clingy and emotionally weak.

I still believe in romance and in all the bullshit about love that Disney poisoned our minds with.

I've been depressed and suicidal my entire life, literally. Meaning my views of the world and life are very negative and dark. People usually don't like that.

I have no interest in what common people usually enjoy. I read books normies don't read, I watch movies they don't watch, I listen to music they don't listen to.

Being alone for so long also turned me into an asshole. People confide to me easily and think I have empathy but I don't. I don't care. I don't feel anything. I hate people and I don't care about their feelings. I just know what I'm supposed to say.

I don't even know if I'm capable of love anymore. I get crushes quite often, and usually on girls that are my total opposite and who I KNOW aren't good for me. It almost always ends up terribly.

I don't know if I'm ugly or not. Personally I hate my face and I hate seeing myself in any mirror. Some women told me I was ""cute"" but a ""cute"" man doesn't attract women. I also look younger than my age. Women my age want manly men and I'm not interested in younger women because they're too immature.

I have no life experiences because I've always been alone and recluse.

I think and overthink too much and too often.

Also I've recently realized that I've strong masochistic and self-destructive tendencies. I self-sabotage a lot. It is probably my only way to cope.

And... unfortunately: I'm intelligent. My hermit life forced me to introspect a lot. And think. I understand how rotten this world is and how shitty life is. How cruel most people are. How futile everything is. This makes it even harder to appreciate or enjoy this short (yet too long) time we have on Earth.

Basically I'm a total mess and there is no hope for me."
ForeverAlone,fcywc27,t1_fcx0m73,1578088510.0,"Lmao. I've been told that many times, IRL included. Fuck off. Also been told that I should ""forgive"" myself. Forgive for what?

ForeverAlone,fcyw69e,t3_eja1bb,1578088407.0,"Wtf. I actually tried to socialize this last two years at work and this is EXACTLY what I lived. I actually know many things, read many books, watched many cool movies. I have a huge musical culture because of the golden age of limewire, soulseek and last.fm.

Talking to people made me feel like I knew NOTHING because I never watch Disney movies, because while I have Netflix I don't watch most of the things people watch and because I don't listen or care about happy or positive things.

Yes I have a dark and negative view of the world... but this world is pretty damn rotten and sadly I'm intelligent enough to realize it. What the hell am I supposed to do?"

FA30plus,fcv193w,t3_ei6iz6,1577992564.0,"I've been called ""cute"" many times. I've been praised for my eyes too. Turns out I'm still alone. Men need to be masculine and not ""cute"" to attract women. Doesn't help either that I look younger than my age and that I can't grow a beard to hide it.

""cute"" my ass.

Also sometimes people call me ""handsome"". ""Hey handsome how u doing?"" I never could tell if they mean it, but considering how long I've been alone I guess they didn't.

That or my personality really fucking sucks."
FA30plus,fctxuft,t3_eihkn9,1577964977.0,"Yeah at this point I have just given up. I'm trying to learn to love myself, and not rely or depend on others for my own happiness. Happiness and peace come from within.

Seeing life as a tragedy helped me too. I'm alone, but I'm somewhat at peace now. I feel like I'm aloof and distant from everything. As if I was looking at the collapse of this rotten world on an island really far away.

Nothing matters. Our time on Earth will be short anyway. We're all alone deep inside. Nothing matters. Embrace the nihilism and the tragedy."

I'm like you, I could die and none would know or even care. But in the end, what does it matter? Ozymandias was the kings of kings. He was forgotten, and so will we all.

Our time on Earth is short and meaningless. Even the social people are alone. We're all alone. None of us matter. Embrace the emptiness and the nihilism. See life as a tragedy. Life will still suck, especially ours, but the depression won't be as strong.

""I met a traveller from an antique land  
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
 Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,  
 Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
 And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
 Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
 The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:  
 And on the pedestal these words appear:  
 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'  
 Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
 The lone and level sands stretch far away """

Many melees are scum champions and fake ""real"" top laners, such as Riven. Riven never plays fair, she stuns you and does her no counterplay combo then runs away all game like a coward.

Renekton is similar. He relies on a cheesy no counterplay combo. That's not manly.

Tryndamere relies on cheese too, and as long as he'll have this R I'll never respect him.

Fiora isn't worthy of respect either so long as her W slows AS.

Nasus is scum too. He loses games but his lvl 6 + sheen powerspike is retarded. So is his W.

I've been dependent on women my entire life. I thought eventually I'd find one that would put me out of that dark hole and fill the emptiness. It never happened and probably never will. Even the few times I've had relationships with them I was still feeling empty.

All the women and people in general brought me was pain and sorrow. No one truly understands me and in fact no one cares. It makes sense, that's how life is. But it took me really long to realize it.

The only answer is within and you are right we should forgive ourselves. After all we'll never have anyone else but ourselves.
