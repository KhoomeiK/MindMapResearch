They shoved too many of these microwave dinners down our throats and now we know that they aren’t even being clever about it, it’s an exact remake but with the charming animation replaced with CGI fur and lots of it."

bengals,fcobv96,t1_fco87dh,1577828448.0,Back in 05 when he was doing “Chads corner” on the local news and we were emerging from the dark days that his enthusiasm and personality were what cemented my love for the bengals. Unfortunately he wanted to be famous for things that weren’t football related and that’s when it all went downhill.
Watchmen,fck82wg,t1_fck7677,1577719173.0,"From the Wiki- 

if enacted, the bill would have allowed the extradition of criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and mainland China.[39] This led to concerns that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and legal system of mainland China, thereby undermining the region's autonomy and Hong Kong people's civil liberties.[40][41][42][43] As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into alleged police brutality and misconduct, the release of arrested protesters, a complete retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as ""riots"", and Chief Executive Carrie Lam's resignation along with the introduction of universal suffrage for election of the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive.[44][45]

—-seems like they want to protect their civil liberties from the awful Chinese government."
