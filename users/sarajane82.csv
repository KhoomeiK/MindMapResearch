asexuality,ffel49s,t1_ffdm37j,1579852628.0,Just because the oppression isn't public enough doesn't mean it doesn't exist.....
asexuality,ffel36w,t1_ffek9ds,1579852590.0,"Do we HAVE to be? YES, because we are marginalized and erased and told we are just wrong and freaks of nature and even abused for it. Ace people deserve to be recognized and validated.  
 We are told we just need to fix ourselves, to get help, to get treatment to change. We don't need to change, we need to be accepted just like any other sexual orientation.  
Asexual is a ""sexual orientation"", so we should be included.   
So many of us have felt broken and lost for so long because we are not the ""normal"" type, the sexual type, we are different and that seems to threaten everyone. Anything out of the ordinary seems to be taken as a threat, when really we don't want to change anyone, we just expect the same level of respect. Don't try to force us to change to make you feel better.   
It is important especially I think for the young people of the world to know, we can save them from years of anguish by having asexually awareness so they don't have to go through the questioning, doubting, trying to change....just all the pain of feeling like a freak. The youth of the world need to know that asexual is OK and normal and if that is what you are ok, just be you and that is enough.  
If asexuality is excluded many more people will suffer.   
I feel like LGBTQA+ is for anyone who is outside of the ""norm"" as described by current culture. Just my current perception and understanding of it. And it is important that we are all represented there."

BingeEatingDisorder,ff5iwkw,t3_erk94y,1579594967.0,"Likely he is feeling very insecure. He might be afraid you will leave if you lose weight and he doesn't. Change is always hard. And it is hard on you, and, it is hard on him.I suggest a deep heart to heart about it. Just set some boundaries, make it clear this is important to you and it has nothing to do with how you feel about him. You just need to do this for you.Sometimes it is easy to get afraid when our partner begins to change from what we knew them as at first. But that doesn't mean they stop being in love with us. It is possible he just needs some reassurance. His fears may be misplaced and based in his own mind rather than reality but for him they are very real.That being said, he also needs to know you need him to not sabotage your efforts because you also need support just as much as he does.In some areas I often find it easier to keep my self improvement to myself, just for a time, until I feel secure in my self motivation. Not because I want to keep it to myself, but because I know myself enough to know I do better when I walk the walk, more than, I talk the talk. Like me exercising more wasn't about anyone but me, it was about getting stronger and being more capable. So I did, but if I talked about it with others first or during my start, their doubts in my ability would have kept  me from doing my best. So sometimes, it is easier to just DO something than it is to try and share it with those closest to us.I know that sounds rather counter intuitive. Like we should be able to share anything with anyone at anytime. But that just isn't reality. Feelings are messier than that. And our wanting to be healthier really isn't an affront to anyone right? But it can be taken as such even subconsciously.  
And we can also begin to read a bit too much into our loved one's responses to our efforts (or lack of responses), if we share our goals with them. better to just know what you want, go for it, and keep track, and celebrate your victories on your own. Bringing other people into that before you are ready is messy and hard and may just get you totally off course.   
So just go do you...and let your success be your noise. This way no matter how slow, fast, backtracked or fast tracked it is, it is just THERE, it is simply a reality. I feel this gives everyone a more natural way to adjust to things rather than trying to figure out intentions based on ""goals"" we have set out loud. Instead of anticipating reality with the expectations of more than one person, you are now just simply charting the path you need to take for the sake of your own body which is really, your right and responsibility, nobody can take the from you."

AsexualAdults,fe9x08x,t1_fdpddzn,1578942212.0,I never saw libido as having to do with how much I enjoy an orgasm. It is more like scratching an itch. The action relieves the itch but isn't necessarily good times. Just like ah that is better.
AsexualAdults,fe9wlac,t3_emimnx,1578942102.0,"Having a libido to me is just my body working. It is hormones. It is an itch that one may scratch if they feel the need to to quiet it. 
I don't always need or want to scratch that itch. Often I can just ignore it and it goes away. 
It has nothing to do with sexual attraction for me. My libido has always been on the low end. But it is normal for an ace to have a high libido. 
You are still ace if you feel no sexual attraction to anyone."

deadbedrooms is very dramatic for sure, very negative space.   
I say if sex is the most important thing in a relationship for a person then you have bigger problems than sexual compatibility.   
How important it is to every person will vary, it is important to find a partner that is sexually compatible with you but at the same time we need to make allowances for life circumstances. Never assume your partner will stay the same as when you first meet. It is normal for sex life to have ups and downs and dry spells.

AskWomenOver30,fd401ef,t3_ejmaib,1578163138.0,"> Is the criticism warranted? 

No, there is no just reason for criticizing your partner in that way. You can say something nice like oh, you look lovely as always. You can even share a preference for long hair by saying, oh I love it long best but I love you no matter what and you are always lovely to me. Something nice. Criticism, like insults and the like, not ok ever. 

> Does a dramatic physical change like that need discussing between partners? 

Hair cutting isn't that dramatic, it isn't like getting something expensive done like say a boob job or other surgery that isn't' medically necessary. It's just hair and nobody should have to get permission from their spouse or even check in before changing their own hair. That is just over the top controlling to expect. 

> Does it actually have the potential to change attraction? 

I suppose that is possible but kind of ridiculous. When you love someone you love the person not just their body. I prefer longer hair but my spouse keeps his really super short, do I complain? nope. Do I treat him differently for it? Nope. Does it change how I see him? Nope. It is just hair and really not as important as him being comfortable and happy with how he looks. 

People have a right to be comfortable and happy with their own bodies, a partner has no right to criticize or demand their partner look differently just because they like it better a different way."

It doesn't have to be fancy, but clean. Just tidy, things in their place, no weird smells, clean toilet for heaven's sake, no nasty food on dishes in sinks or on counters, clean glasses to have a drink from, soap to wash my hands and a clean towel to dry them on, a snack or drink to offer, a clean space to sit with no pets jumping on me. I love animals, I do, I have my own.   
But I get annoyed if a person expects me to at first meeting at their home to just be cool with all their pets jumping on me right off the bat. Maybe I am wearing my best clothes and don't really want pet hairs or claw marks maybe snagging what I wore on a freaking date to look nice ya know?   
Some of these will vary person to person. I know some women who don't notice cleanliness as much and some who wouldn't be bothered by even 10 dogs jumping on them at once. But common courtesy and waiting to see how the other person feels before just throwing all your mess at them is a good idea.   
But also be honest, because really, nobody wants to be mismatched in any way. If you want to actually change yourself for life to attract certain people to want to be with you then creating habits of cleanliness is always a good idea. But don't let it stop after the first encounter. But if you are a messy person and want to be messy forever and that is just how you are, that is COOL, BUT, find someone else who is the same. Don't waste a neat freaks time by trying to be something you are not. BE yourself. If you want to improve certain areas because you think you could do better and actually want to stay that way, hazzah! That is great, more power to you. But if you are a more sloppy type of person and want to stay that way then own it, be proud of it, and find a girl who is cool with it.   
Either way can work, but you need to decide what you can live with. Don't fake it. Be yourself."

fatlogic,fc4skqo,t3_eg5oao,1577426833.0,"I have a pet that will eat anything and everything at any time including feces. He is overweight. I have another pet that I can leave her food out day and night and she only eats what she needs, she is thin.   
I would never say we all have the same challenges, but that we all have different habits. If your habit is like mine and my fat pet's, you need to keep track of what you eat and be careful. We must regulate what we eat.   
If you are like my cat and my son, you will never have an issue staying thin because you naturally move more and eat less.   
It is still about the same things, but, we somehow tend to over eat. I will never deny that. Some people and some animals will over eat even though it is bad for them.   
It is those types that MUST be careful at all times, and the pet owners must be diligent. In the wild having a lack of food can happen naturally, but in a home environment pets can end up obese especially if we pass our bad eating habits onto them by not making that effort to say nope, one treat is plenty for the day. NO more. Period."
