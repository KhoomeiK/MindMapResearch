wow,ffb113y,t1_ffb0xdy,1579749137.0,At the time he was still bound to them and this was prior to him turning against them and seeking the gem of sargeras. So loyalty. Though not sure if he knew he was dead yet.
wow,ffaj8np,t1_ffai2zm,1579737080.0,"No I think garrosh going back and trying to shift it made it alternate. IIRC because if he had never done so everything was set to go as planned. I.e. invasion of azeroth, orcs drinking demon blood, gul dan eventually dying."
wow,ffahbjk,t1_ffagzrk,1579735739.0,WoD had a fairly complex story line involving time travel especially the WoD--> Legion story line. Having alternate timeline gul dan be the new figure head for ushering in the legion was pretty dope.
wow,ff9dmdv,t1_ff9d74r,1579710709.0,Fair.
wow,ff9ajcx,t3_escxv6,1579708574.0,Dont all ending cinematics usually drop you in the raid still or am I misinterpreting this?
gifs,ff35aus,t1_ff336zk,1579534023.0,Are cameras that big even secured by anything? That seems rather dangerous as a diver. Should the restraint become tangled in something would that not pose a hazard?
gifs,ff2yjq7,t1_ff2y6ir,1579528711.0,I don't think the diver meant to let that happen. I think it was an unforeseeable accident.

wholesomememes,felh38j,t1_felguc5,1579222015.0,Gonna take this time to say digging the comics man! Keep on keeping on!
wholesomememes,felfojx,t1_fele3b7,1579221072.0,No no it's fine. I saw him like two swipes after this post.
wholesomememes,fele32c,t1_fele1oi,1579220010.0,I feel stupid. Didnt see that OP is the OP.

AnimalsBeingBros,fekvyb0,t1_fektu56,1579208721.0,Its not feeding them. Its moistening the bread.
wholesomeanimemes,fekda6a,t1_fekd0fd,1579197637.0,The title.
wow,feihbb5,t1_feifap4,1579138532.0,Did you mean broxigar?
todayilearned,fehx4c4,t1_fehvu95,1579125606.0,Sad. Truly truly sad. Been keeping kids and adults alike entertained with something so simple. Idk if he sees this since I know he has a reddit. But thank you for your invention.
CollegeRant,fehpaka,t1_feh1kn0,1579121157.0,Unfortunately things that require access codes are still an issue and usually the bulk of the cost.
todayilearned,feh8eyc,t1_feh7azs,1579111285.0,Fairly certain he is on reddit too. Also sad that they miss out on a really good toy for all ages.
todayilearned,fegxwry,t1_fegtq7k,1579104983.0,Imagine people acting that way toward super soakers
CollegeRant,fegwdfw,t1_fegw0lf,1579104012.0,I went to CC. Good stuff. Better than uni tbh. People care more. Its cheaper. Just didnt have my degree. Also it depends on how many classes I take. Since I am going only in the spring and fall semesters and not staying on campus it comes out to 6 k a year.
food,feej9ww,t1_feej5ba,1579034882.0,Yeah. I really dont know how to describe it. Like a distinct taste like seafood but not fishy. You know when you are eating gator and it's not as obnoxious of a flavor as seafood has. But still prevalent.
food,feeixq0,t1_feehvu2,1579034686.0,Honestly it has it's own taste. But with the texture of chicken.
gaming,fee1bz5,t3_eonyel,1579024335.0,Wait till he uses 11% of his power.

PublicFreakout,fd0gwgg,t1_fd0c255,1578118615.0,Former Dunkin employee here. That's just how they are. We do throw them away though.
antiMLM,fd0fmc9,t1_fd06o2u,1578118105.0,Good human.
relationship_advice,fcwjyct,t1_fcwhr7p,1578027674.0,Not gonna lie I have no idea what you are talking about. I'm complimenting OP for recognizing a toxic relationship and getting the ever living hell out of there.
mildlyinteresting,fcwb72f,t1_fcway7m,1578021367.0,But most definitely not a crook.
AskReddit,fcvdivp,t1_fcvd86j,1577999836.0,It was a fairly easy movie to follow. Human lets orcs invade. Orcs invade. Orcs bad. We beat orcs. Orcs kill king. My father who watched it with me understood and hes doesnt really pay attention especially when its nerd stuff.
AskReddit,fcvaj4a,t1_fcvacj5,1577998054.0,I thought it was dope for a movie introducing the general populace to the lore. There wasn't much complexities that would be difficult for outsiders to the game to understand. Some had issues with the CGI but I saw the orcs and got shivers down my spine. It was a really solid movie. If I ever become rich I'd pay the director to make then just for me at that point.
AskReddit,fcv93lf,t3_ej2gei,1577997204.0,The lore from world of warcraft would make a brilliant tv series. Just give credit to me for the idea!
relationship_advice,fcu8hy0,t3_eiyhsn,1577975055.0,Holy shit my dude. You are a brave man. Most definitely an aspiration.
food,fc7hub6,t3_egltpg,1577507895.0,Put this on a wooden plank and you got yourself one of them fancy French cuisines.
u_SnackCrate_Official,fc6kgvs,t3_caazjt,1577482711.0,Jumpy's! German cracker-esque snacks sprinkled with paprika!

specializedtools,fbv1lg9,t1_fbuw0t4,1577123903.0,Technically infinitely? If I recall correctly in 0 g you just need a force to push you and you can just keep going since there is no wind resistance. But I think even on the ISS there is still minor g holding the station in orbit. So EVENTUALLY if you try your fart propulsion you will eventually float back to earth. But get far enough away and you will continue in one direction. But this is just a theory. MY THEORY. Thanks for watching guys.
