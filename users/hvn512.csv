Austin,fekikqf,t3_epnkpx,1579200791.0,I used to go to Forest Family dental in North Austin and paid out of pocket. I remember it being decent and affordable.
Austin,fedaute,t3_eokt36,1579006044.0,😱😱
depression,fechf87,t1_fecc744,1578973989.0,"If you’re super worried about being too much at once, maybe try baby steps, feel things out?"
depression,fec7h63,t3_eodhu2,1578967975.0,"Because they have other things they’re dealing with, I guess. Sometimes you have to initiate. I try to send out texts to certain people every so often. My best friend checks in on me too."
depression,feawd3h,t1_fe45a61,1578952858.0,I don’t think you sacrifice anything by apologizing first. It takes courage and humility and responsibility to apologize and try to make things right.
depression,fe8t89k,t3_eo5ksb,1578930570.0,"So sorry you’re going through that. I’ve been there in the last couple of years and managed to crawl out of the hole. What helped me was finding things to distract and lose myself in, which was hard at first because everything seemed painful or pointless. But I just did what I had to do to make it to the next day, and the next, and the next. Eventually it gets easier."
depression,fe5uv9a,t3_enw83t,1578875474.0,"You sound like a great kid, honestly. Try not to put so much pressure on yourself. Just get through school as best you can and worry about things like jobs later."
AmItheAsshole,fe4uz6a,t3_entdum,1578863053.0,NTA. If he’s screaming in a public place he definitely can’t expect to maintain any privacy.
depression,fe46t5j,t3_enrqjb,1578856306.0,"I say order the pizza and when it gets there, eat some if you want. If you don’t, store it in the fridge for when you do."
depression,fe44kwo,t3_enrhnc,1578855730.0,Are you a student that has access to school counselors? Do you have a church? Not necessarily for religious reasons but for a sense of community and somewhere to turn when you need. Just some thoughts.
depression,fe41fxf,t3_enrd3g,1578854868.0,That just says he’s a worthless friend to you.
depression,fe3s5rc,t1_fe3p4oz,1578852349.0,"There’s also such a thing as reading too much into things, which is what you do. Good luck and please don’t stalk me. xD"
depression,fe3k9dd,t1_fe3c3gj,1578850048.0,"And yeah, I guess I can see how inserting myself too deeply into some random person’s situation and giving crazy advice about his children would be “pulling shit together.” 💩"
HeidiBroussard,fe3ildf,t1_fe3gyre,1578849587.0,"They absolutely are white knighting, and that’s what I find interesting. Not judging, honestly, just curious."
depression,fe3f0w8,t1_fe3c3gj,1578848716.0,"When I mentioned wounded ego, I was talking about yours. You are the one who claimed blackmail and advocated for him to take his daughter from her mother. I think the OP was presented with an ultimatum which many married people are - *this* or divorce. I think what his wife did was probably shitty (I say probably because I have no real knowledge of the actual situation and I know from experience if his wife cheated on him, OP is writing from a place of pain and betrayal which may not allow him to be objective) but not grounds for having her parental rights revoked. You and your ideas are just extreme."
HeidiBroussard,fe35nnv,t1_fe33sqy,1578846130.0,"Lol. You’re posting this weeks after the incident here and you have a channel dedicated to it? Or at least spend significant time on it, making hit-and-run comments on other people’s channels too. When will *you* #moveon? 😂 Like I said, I’m mostly just curious about your motivations."
HeidiBroussard,fe2zv23,t1_fdzer4d,1578844602.0,"According to who, though? Like who gave the statement for the affidavit and how are you so sure it’s accurate? Just wondering. It’s so interesting to me how random women are “white-knighting” for this guy who abused his girlfriend. It reminds me of these people who write fan letters to Chris Watts and Charles Manson, you know? I just wonder the motivation. Yes, many of us wrongly suspected Shane Carey of having something to do with Heidi’s disappearance/murder, but just because he turned out to be innocent of that doesn’t negate the things he did or magically turn him into a good guy. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
depression,fe2nzqq,t1_fe23xkw,1578841026.0,You’re the only one bringing up “male entitlement” and gender in general. Anyone reading these comments sees right through you xD You’re also obviously speaking from a place of anger and bitterness and advocating for a child to be taken from their mother and placed in the sole custody of a suicidal person.
HeidiBroussard,fdzdmt1,t1_fdypha9,1578789241.0,"I heard her talking about *one* other guy, but how do we/you know that was a lie? That wasn’t even about Shane. I didn’t hear her say the thing about him going to get drunk after Margo was born so maybe I’ll go watch it again. But how do you know that was a lie? Genuinely curious. Any others?"
depression,fdz6660,t3_enfgig,1578787093.0,"If she says she still wants to talk, and you still want to talk, then talk."
HeidiBroussard,fdye226,t3_en3jew,1578778719.0,Which lies?
Covetfashion,fdxzyly,t3_encfyd,1578774632.0,Aw. Well for what it’s worth I think it looks great.
AmItheAsshole,fdxzds0,t3_enbryj,1578774463.0,You tattled on his wife to him? Weird.
depression,fdwk60a,t1_fdulu6k,1578759536.0,"You’re adding the words abuse and violence everywhere and OP never uses them or alludes to that kind of thing. He never said she was threatening to take his child, only that she “threatened” divorce. It’s pretty obvious you’re projecting (and just a little misogynistic). And I’m 99% positive you’re not a parent."
depression,fdt1ckw,t3_en1dec,1578710646.0,That’s rough 😕 Did you try apologizing?
depression,fdssnyc,t1_fdsm0d4,1578707431.0,"How do you know? xD All you really have is some vague information from one person in this situation, and you’re adding all the drama."
AmItheAsshole,fds5hu5,t3_emxz9r,1578694805.0,I say NTA. Some people have no concept of what’s appropriate and need to be taught 😋
depression,fds2fhw,t1_fdqq9t3,1578693279.0,"A wounded ego is not a legitimate reason to take a child from his/her mother (or father), sorry. :-/"
AmItheAsshole,fdqn22r,t3_emshja,1578670544.0,"NAH. Your trust issues are understandable but if he's not into her, her intentions don't really matter."
Austin,fdqiyf1,t1_fdqfswb,1578667817.0, I read a little while ago that strong wind and hail is likely but tornado threat is fairly low. Hope that's right.
depression,fdqgtah,t3_emnbdm,1578666307.0,"I find all the ""take the daughter away"" comments really disturbing. If you're so depressed that you're feeling suicidal, you're probably not the best sole provider for your daughter right now.  Whatever you decide to do in regards to your marriage, seek therapy."
Covetfashion,fdnqb6s,t1_fdngg57,1578590814.0,It’s Thursday... 😆

HeidiBroussard,fdclrju,t1_fd08azp,1578278061.0,Wouldn’t you have a vendetta against the guy who abused your best friend? 🤷🏻‍♀️

jobs,fby8jpu,t3_ef4rbh,1577210696.0,So you use suicide as a threat? Maybe needs more context.
HeidiBroussard,fbxvtac,t3_eewzuk,1577201823.0,"Freaking adorable, with Heidi’s big eyes."
depression,fbwurjd,t1_fbwunxs,1577159983.0,I think he means when people use it as a weapon/threat.
