bipolar,fdkoyxn,t3_eltwg7,1578508131.0,"I just returned to work Monday after taking a month off a job I had just started in September. I had to go in and talk/cry to my bosses and explain I'm bi polar and in a very depressive episode. Took me a couple of weeks to work on getting my anxiety in control to go back and I was nervous. Co workers saw me leaving the meeting in tears. 
The hours at my job are great for me and close to home. I had to really turn my anxiety to excitement to go back to work...get back into a routine and ...well..make money. It's one of my prouder moments as I've always just never returned to work after an episode ( had over 100 jobs since 1995) I was always embarrassed. 
It doesn't matter what people think...it matters what's best for you! Just keep you're head held high, because no matter what, youre doing your best to navigate through life!"

bipolar,fcs3xih,t1_fcs2vua,1577911110.0,"I completely understand. For 20 years I've dabbled and there nothing I can take of drugs but weed. Anything else, the comedown and after effects have nearly killed me. I have also struggled to stay away because the happy high is relief from everyday lows. However I dont think the happy highs are worth the lowest of lows."
