Funny story though, I went Feb 2019. If read on reddit how the fare was optional, and if you went through the side entrance they didn't bug you at all, and how you should do that.

She kept asking me if I was sure - ""there are ticket machines right there!"" but I was 100% sure it wasn't required, I'd even told my boss about it! So into the elevator we went, thinking we'd start at the top and make our way down. No one stopped us.

Very shortly after we realised everyone had stickers on their coats with the museum logo. Wife started giving me looks, to which I just shrugged, while I started getting worried inside. A couple of rooms after I told her I might've made a mistake, but we took our coats off and hoped guards would assume the stickers were on them. I was dressed sharply (went on business) and thought we'd probably get away with it. To be fair, we did.

What I didn't count on was running into my boss sometime near the end of our visit, and him proceeding to tell me how he'd got into a discussion with the ticket personnel since he was also sure (I told him, remember?) that it was optional bla bla bla. Awkwardness, apologies, wife saved me.
