relationship_advice,ffa917i,t1_ffa8m9q,1579730241.0,"I think my bf is the same way, like we have conversations over text a lot but lately they’re becoming spaced out and stuff so it kinda worries me, he may be thinking of me he just hasn’t said anything so I can’t truly tell if he is and that’s kind of what worries me. We don’t really do phone calls unless it’s super important but I always try to make sure to send a goodnight message of some sort"
relationship_advice,ffa8lj1,t1_ffa85ov,1579729998.0,Exactly I’ve heard that many times so I mostly just send one and if he replies then yay! If not he’ll eventually text I know it so I tend to just leave it. Problem is sometimes it for over an entire day he leaves it hanging so like I will send another text under that circumstance
relationship_advice,ffa7r3q,t1_ffa7d4i,1579729526.0,"Yeah maybe I will have to let him know, chances are he just sees it sometimes and thinks it’s okay to not respond to. I just don’t want to send it because in the past and it’s pretty common he just won’t reply or he’ll leave it for 12 hours then reply saying he forgot or he didn’t see it. I guess sometimes just the straight up ignoring hurts a little so it makes me not want to say anything, he’s just a horrible texter he tells me"
relationship_advice,ffa7kcw,t1_ffa7e2n,1579729421.0,Very true thank you for the insight😊
relationship_advice,ffa69yf,t1_ffa5zyw,1579728706.0,Thank you 😊 and awe how come? If it was your gf wouldn’t you want to hear from her?
relationship_advice,ffa685y,t1_ffa5wyb,1579728679.0,Awe that’s real cute! Maybe he’s the same way but he just hasn’t texted me at all today and when that happens I just assume he wants some space or doesn’t want to talk so I tend to just leave it. Should I send it? He’s told me in the past he’s just a horrible texter and I remember seeing a text on his phone he got 4 days earlier that he didn’t realize he got lol so it could be anything
relationship_advice,ffa5tj0,t1_ffa5mtt,1579728455.0,"Sometimes I send him things like that or sweet messages and he takes the whole day to respond (but is online social media all day) or doesn’t respond at all, it’s hit or miss honestly most of his apologies are that he didn’t see my text or he forgot so it makes me a little afraid to text him. Although I know he really is just bad at texting he’s told me in the past!"
relationship_advice,ffa5eis,t1_ffa5aeu,1579728224.0,Thank you I’ll keep that in mind 😊
relationship_advice,ff60kk3,t3_erv5re,1579616026.0,"Yeah sorry but instead of being mature and telling him you cancelled you just ignored his text and ditched him? How would that make you feel? Frankly I’ll be surprised if he ever talked to you again, no offense!"
relationship_advice,ff5qvsq,t1_ff5q6nu,1579606633.0,Yeah I guess I don’t get it cus I’m usually good with my phone and he isn’t so much. Thanks for the comments I really appreciate it :)
relationship_advice,ff5q2pt,t1_ff5pwmx,1579605557.0,"Sounds the same as my bf haha! I guess sometimes he really just doesn’t notice it but he’s on his phone anyways liking stuff so I figure if he can do that then he can go to his messages. Thank you for your insight I’ll probably mention it to him, I think after 2 years of dating you just get used to it tho, also like one pull down on his notifications bar and he would see it but I’ve noticed he doesn’t even do that."
relationship_advice,ff5p8s7,t1_ff5p19e,1579604394.0,"Wow thank you very much this helps me understand a bit more, my fear was just that he didn’t care or didn’t think to say anything. I appreciate your comments :)

One more question, when you’re on your phone possibly looking at other stuff (looking at memes or scrolling through reddit etc.) do you still just forget all about her text? I find I do this with my friends sometimes but I would never to my bf so it just confuses me a little"
relationship_advice,ff5oud4,t1_ff5oqw2,1579603810.0,Thank you for the insight! I was looking for a man’s perspective on this because as a girl I would probably never forget to reply haha! And my bf said the same thing before too that he’s just a bad texter and forgets a lot. I know he does get distracted but are you thinking of her at all in that time that you’re forgetting to reply? Because sometimes he does it for the entire day
relationship_advice,ff5o73q,t1_ff5o4n6,1579602848.0,That could be the truth as I get bored of our conversations sometimes and frankly I just don’t really like texting back and forth a lot. I know he wouldn’t be with me for over 2 years if he didn’t love me
offmychest,ff2rwh1,t3_erab75,1579521435.0,"Happy birthday! I hope your day is as wonderful as you are, never give up sweetheart :) it’ll get better!"

relationship_advice,ferg5mx,t1_ferfgps,1579353491.0,Oh wait “too” lmao
relationship_advice,ferg3sw,t1_ferfgps,1579353470.0,Where?
relationship_advice,ferg2x5,t1_ferfe44,1579353460.0,Haha I love that! Same with my bf and I basically it’s so funny
relationship_advice,ferg1gc,t1_ferfb5c,1579353443.0,"That ain’t cool man! When my bf does anything I encourage it, he taught me how to go snowboarding so that we can go together and stuff like that and I indulge in my own hobbies while he also does"
relationship_advice,ferehtg,t1_fere01o,1579352967.0,"Awe thank you! It definitely is, his friends know that we’re basically the same person and I’ve only met a few of them but the ones I haven’t know me by name and I find that cute. It’s literally a dream"
relationship_advice,ferecw1,t1_ferctsg,1579352914.0,Ahh so sorry! You’ll find your match for sure I just wanted to put this out there because I’ve never been in such a long and comfortable relationship where he is literally my best friend. You’ll find your person keep your head up!❤️
relationship_advice,fere8g0,t1_ferc7jy,1579352865.0,Awe are you guys not??
relationship_advice,fer95my,t1_fer8wk9,1579351351.0,"It’s awesome, I’ve just never had it before!!😊"
relationship_advice,fed7w2p,t1_fed6zdn,1579002944.0,"He’s seemed to like to text before, but just recently we haven’t been doing as much texting if at all, I thought maybe it was a comfort level thing because he just stopped initiating some and would randomly send me memes or something related so maybe he feels he doesn’t have to chat all day? Could be anything, it’s not crazy important to me so it can slide like it always has"
relationship_advice,fe1zftv,t1_fe1yb0w,1578832713.0,"Thank you for the kind words. I know that I don’t think I could be with him forever but I can’t bring myself to breakup, I know I’m going to regret it and want him back once he’s gone because maybe I didn’t appreciate the things he DOES do enough. I don’t know why I feel like that but I think at this point I’m hanging on because it’s so comfortable."
relationship_advice,fdzvod2,t1_fdwkq7i,1578796901.0,"He had felt like he wasn’t enough for me sexually, it was a sad conversation but no breakup and we fixed things, agreed to try new things :) it made him happy"
relationship_advice,fdve8dt,t3_en6b1l,1578746505.0,"I too sometimes get jealous when my bf talks to other girls and stuff like that, but never enough to actually act on it. I trust my boyfriend, and she should trust you too. I think it stems from insecurities which she can work on herself for sure and things will get better, like you said she’s going to therapy so that’s a good step."
offmychest,fdvdboc,t3_emzknn,1578746257.0,"I was diagnosed with ADHD young, was on some medication for a lot of my childhood but my parents didn’t like the way it changed me. I’ve mostly grown out of it, I’m 19 (F) now and I have had a wonderful boyfriend who puts up with my annoying, super talkative ass and I love him so much! The only issues I find, paying attention in class is not easy and I think about a lot of other things, I switch topics really fast and talk REALLY fast, I get bored of a task at work quickly and start another while that one is half finished and then the same thing when that one gets boring, I accidentally blurt our offensive stuff sometimes when I get too excited I can’t think and talk really loud. I’m trying to learn to get better on my own, my memory is pretty perfect tho maybe I just have a mild form. Hope everything gets better!❤️❤️"
relationship_advice,fdqlxw3,t1_fdqigai,1578669817.0,"Thank you! He has actually tried a lot more of the things I like and it’s been great, I’m just glad it wasn’t a serious breakup or anything."
relationship_advice,fdnz9se,t1_fdnfi9j,1578595875.0,"I do very much, it’s just come as a shock to me as it seems very serious. Usually we just casually chat but this time he wanted me to meet him at his house to talk instead of snowboarding."
relationship_advice,fdn4krr,t1_fdn47tj,1578577100.0,Yes I will
relationship_advice,fdmuieh,t1_fdmu707,1578566418.0,"Thank you so much this puts me at more of an ease. People don’t seem to think he wants to breakup but I have no idea what he could possibly want to talk about. When I said I hope everything is okay and he said “I hope so babe” it got me kinda worried, but he did say that it’s nothing to do with us and that we are fine, he’s never lied about that before. Worst thing that can happen is I’ll be sad for a little while but I can go out and meet some new people after I heal, it isn’t the end of the world.❤️"
relationship_advice,fdmtr1r,t1_fdmtmmu,1578565373.0,"Thank you so much for saying this. My friends agree that he doesn’t seem like he wants to breakup but I just don’t possibly know what he wants to talk about, since last time I saw him everything was good. He likes to surprise me but last time he did he didn’t say a single word about it."
relationship_advice,fdmtmiz,t1_fdmtib9,1578565199.0,"That’s what my friends think to, but I don’t know what he could possibly have to tell me since I know every single thing usually that’s going on. He likes to surprise me but this was a complete surprise and not a good one. If he was breaking up do you think he would have told me that he wanted to talk beforehand? If it were me I’d just do it"
relationship_advice,fdmtede,t1_fdmtaam,1578564887.0,"I’ve been doing that to, it helped me calm down big time but I still have this fear in the back of my mind. Does it sound like he’s gonna break up with me?"
relationship_advice,fdmtd75,t1_fdmt939,1578564841.0,Thank you very much. I’ve only slept maybe 4 hours and now I just can’t go back to bed because this had my mind in a twist. Does it sound like he wants to break up?
relationship_advice,fdklrau,t1_fdklj11,1578506178.0,"He’s been pretty good with answering, he used to be bad for ignoring but he randomly got better without me saying anything. I’ll do that, I’ll let him miss me as I always do. He just isn’t treating me like he misses me"
relationship_advice,fdklokq,t1_fdkl7r0,1578506132.0,"That can happen but I feel like it’s only me he’s ignoring. I’m not worried as it sometimes happens, if he was having a bad day why not reply to me?"
relationship_advice,fcez354,t3_eh5fmq,1577625073.0,"Sorry yeah, I’d draw the line at open relationship. He loves the freedom of being able to sleep with other people too much that he’s barely in a relationship with you anymore. Ignored you for days on end but is active online the dating app (probably just getting constantly laid) and not caring about you in the slightest to check in?

Yeah I’d dump him real quick, don’t let him treat you like that."
relationship_advice,fc54jd8,t1_fc54fmj,1577442779.0,"Thanks girl it makes sense to me too but I wouldn’t do that to my bf, but I HAVE done that before to him just because I needed some alone time to yeah I guess it’s no issue."
relationship_advice,fc54hym,t1_fc54efh,1577442718.0,Usually when he’s shown to be up that late I’m always right because the next day he’s really tired saying he was up late
Advice,fc0e9xa,t3_efgfq8,1577288468.0,"Okay thank goodness this is really relieving, we’d be passing the border into the US from Canada so I do believe it’s okay. Age of consent here is 16 I do believe and my bf and I are really only a year and 5 months apart, he was born in April 2002 and I was born November 2000"
Advice,fc07tkr,t1_fc07cok,1577282200.0,K
Advice,fc072rr,t1_fc06wjo,1577281362.0,Yeah a friend of mine put that in my head that I would get rape charges since I’m 19 and he’s 17. But yeah that makes sense a Notarized letter just means signed by a Notary where would I be able to get that done?
Advice,fc0719l,t1_fc06q3s,1577281315.0,I don’t know one of my friends put it in my head that I could get statutory rape put under my name if they knew we were dating and staying a weekend in the States. But yeah you’re right it’ll probably be simple
relationship_advice,fb80oax,t1_fb80i47,1576603571.0,Cuddles are the best thing!! Hopefully you get some asap
