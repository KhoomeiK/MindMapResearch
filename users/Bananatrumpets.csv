bulletjournal,fbotwg2,t3_edsr4v,1577014360.0,Tombows! And also this thing called milkliners - they're like mildliners but one of the ends are a different shape? The highlighter bit is the same though. And they have pretty colours. Also i don't know the brand but some black calligraphy pens. Has some Chinese writing on them but they're pretty good
