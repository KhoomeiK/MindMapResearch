WeAreTheMusicMakers,fe6qcrs,t3_eo0ssz,1578900466.0,"I think anyone in music can succeed if they own their look with confidence and cultivate a cohesive brand identity. If in doubt, hire a stylist and/or spend some time hiring visual artists so that you don’t have to exclusively rely on photos for all of your branding. Yes there are certain genres that tend to have a specific look, but I think you’re good as long as everything looks professional. Plus, people can smell bs from a mile away so in my opinion it’s best to be yourself, just enhanced :)"

relationships,fdyhdcn,t1_fdwy1mk,1578779802.0,"The wig idea is a good one but I’d also speak with your parents about what’s going on so you have some backup. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this it sounds like your sister is really stressed about things being ‘perfect’ and is projecting that stress into you. Maybe as a wedding gift you contribute to some therapy for her? Just kidding, but also kinda not haha. Good luck!"
