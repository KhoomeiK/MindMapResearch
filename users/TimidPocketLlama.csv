theinternetofshit,ffdovk7,t3_esybgx,1579825484.0,Sounds like they changed their minds in this email https://twitter.com/Snubs/status/1220482203559153664
swatchitforme,ffdopwi,t1_ffcgtd6,1579825384.0,What’s an RONB? Some variation of no buy?
DidntKnowIWantedThat,ffbwh3k,t1_ffbvkrw,1579785049.0,What is it? A marshmallow?
Astroneer,ff8q0k5,t1_ff7v2ou,1579691171.0,My friend and his son both have PS4s and they play in the same house and still encounter lag issues when they play together. So it may not work for every system.
mildlyinteresting,ff8ody3,t1_ff87n4s,1579688784.0,Okay now I’m imagining like that one guy who took too much colloidal silver and permanently stained his skin.
Astroneer,ff5h27y,t1_ff3umr5,1579592540.0,Sorry I was thinking of Vesania having Titanite on land. I get Vesania and Novus confused sometimes.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff5h0pe,t1_ff3y42b,1579592486.0,Thanks so much!!
Astroneer,ff3k4sh,t1_ff1jn96,1579542758.0,"Novus has titanite on land, Glacio has it in caves."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff2l8p4,t3_eqmeua,1579511398.0,"I’m new, could someone link a great tutorial or thread on how to take care of brushes and beauty sponges? What cleansers to use on them? Thanks!"
BeautyGuruChatter,ff2kzql,t1_fezl4v1,1579511029.0,It’s baffling to me how many people fall for essential oil nonsense.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff2kshr,t3_eqzm2u,1579510742.0,I’m kind of new to beauty stuff...I thought Micellar meant like blobs of oil in water that help makeup come off. So why would you want it in foundation?
WeWantPlates,ff2kfuq,t1_feyr0by,1579510238.0,"Barbie cakes are totally a thing, where the cake is her dress."
AskReddit,feykak9,t1_fexjm2v,1579446651.0,"My mom insisted that TVs, like all appliances (in her mind), needed to “rest.” You can’t run them all the time. (No, I don’t know how the fridge and freezer were exempt from this idea.) My dad’s TV malfunctioned once and they unplugged all the cables from the back of the TV and satellite box to let them “rest.” Had to call the satellite company out to come hook it all back up and fix it."
thingsforants,fextaup,t1_feuujbd,1579435667.0,"Go to Amazon and search World’s Smallest or World’s Smallest Toys. They have tons of toys like Care Bears and My Little Ponies, Hot Wheels, as well as some Fisher Price classic toys and the first Super Soakers. Some are in blind boxes and some are not."
AmItheButtface,feq5g4l,t3_eqdmou,1579337885.0,"NTB and a small addition. When I was long-distance dating a guy in college, I hated it when he’d head to bed without any warning... just “well goodnight!” and I still had things planned I wanted to chat about. So I got him to agree, and this may be helpful to you, to give me a little heads-up. “I think I’m gonna head to bed in about 15 minutes or so.” Maybe your BF would like that as well."
HumansBeingBros,fep64e5,t1_fep5m2f,1579312979.0,Really glad. I’ve seen too many reports of wrong-way drivers lately that turned out much worse for the victims.
HumansBeingBros,fep5yps,t1_feov8ds,1579312877.0,"But sometimes taking a few seconds is a good thing. Because what if the obvious-seeming action is wrong? Like you’ve seen people say if someone has been stabbed and the knife is still in them, don’t yank it out...the knife might be blocking a blood vessel, and if you yank it out they might bleed to death. So a few seconds to evaluate the situation probably isn’t a bad thing, if the patient is still breathing and has a heartbeat. I get what you’re saying, that the shock of a situation makes those of us who are not normally participants in such events freeze up, but maybe that can be a bit of a good thing in some cases."
HumansBeingBros,fep5dxh,t1_feovm0t,1579312508.0,"Damn, sorry to derail but are you okay?"
HumansBeingBros,fep52xr,t1_feow2uq,1579312311.0,If your fist is all you have or you’re panicking and can’t get anything else at the right angle...use your fist to thrust in and up.
HumansBeingBros,fep4ypz,t1_feojs1o,1579312235.0,My mom went to lunch one day with a co-worker who had been a CNA in the past. My mom choked badly enough that she couldn’t get any air...she did the universal choking sign (both hands over throat) and the co-worker went to get more napkins because she thought my mom was gonna throw up! *facepalm* Thankfully my mom gave herself the Heimlich against the table edge and was okay.
PS4,fehycjd,t3_ep96ty,1579126334.0,"I can’t redeem at all, after I click to login it just reloads the 2019 stats page."
MakeupAddicts,fe4fy40,t3_eni67p,1578858875.0,Love!!
Sephora,fdp5y82,t1_fdp40vm,1578620769.0,Thanks!
Sephora,fdm7sjo,t1_fdm4chu,1578541910.0,Thanks. Will they work at the Sephora inside JCP? Because if so I do have one of those nearby.
Sephora,fdlul30,t1_fdlct7p,1578532851.0,"Oh, that’s inconvenient! The closest store is like an hour away."
Siri,fdib7jn,t1_fdgsixi,1578439068.0,"Unfortunately, that didn't fix it. 

I just got off the phone with Apple Support and I just don't think she understood what I was trying to say. I have cellular data turned on BUT not for music, and Siri has always worked fine until I signed up for Apple Music. The Apple rep kept telling me that Siri needs the internet to work. I know that. Siri sends the voice request to be processed. But I need Siri to play the music that is \*already\* on my phone (which has always worked fine in the past) and not stream it from Apple Music (because I am on a limited data plan). I tried explaining it 3 or 4 times and she just kept telling me that Siri needs the internet to work. I don't know if I should call back another day and try for another agent or what."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdghc41,t1_fdfl5v5,1578396811.0,Interesting!
Siri,fdejrw3,t1_fct7j7z,1578340515.0,"Similarly, I had never had a false Siri activation before but in the past couple weeks, I’ll be watching a YouTube video and they might say something like “you see?” and Siri will respond."
Siri,fdejm1f,t3_ejtlg2,1578340416.0,Have you been having any trouble with your internet? I usually get that problem when I’m in my car and driving through a spot where the cellular connection is bad.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdehl4c,t1_fde0kb0,1578339186.0,"That’s half of it. They sometimes colloquially call it “red white and blue” disease. Often the hands and feet get engorged with blood and really hot. I’ve had people tell me my hands look live I’ve been dipping them in red Kool-Aid before. But yes, if the purple and cold phase is absent, it would probably be erythromelalgia, but I’m not a doctor. OP should definitely see his."
TooAfraidToAsk,fddmogw,t3_ekt8m3,1578317953.0,"You mentioned also your hands getting very hot. When you are cold or stressed, do they ever turn white or purple? If so, it could be Raynaud’s. I have it and occasionally my feet get so hot that I have to stop in the middle of a store to take my socks off (shoe off, sock off, shoe on.)"
dadjokes,fd8s7tj,t1_fd8a86b,1578222681.0,Their train of thought derailed.
RainbowEverything,fcy4kli,t3_ehaojc,1578074670.0,Is that a Corsair case? I want one but they’re so pricey.
privacy,fcuc5t2,t1_fcubwo1,1577977541.0,I know it isn’t traditionally but since Dashlane can change passwords I was hoping maybe it could also do emails. And oh boy yes it is taking a long time.
privacy,fcqor53,t3_eiicah,1577889710.0,Is there a self-hosted alternative to Discord that’s maybe FOSS?
AppleHealth,fcmo755,t3_ehsooz,1577783938.0,"I think you have the wrong sub. This is about the Health app on the iPhone, not Apple’s health insurance."
sailormoon,fcjbn2m,t1_fcinxz9,1577682278.0,Me too!
casualiama,fcefu1g,t1_fccy3f4,1577620099.0,Do you have nightmares?
YouShouldKnow,fc46wgl,t1_fc3dnkp,1577408242.0,You don’t have to visit to keep rechecking. At the top go to notification and enter your email. It will then email you any time there’s a new breach that your email is found in.
YouShouldKnow,fc46th1,t1_fc42rb6,1577408179.0,"The website will tell you which breach your email was found in. In the case used here, the person would want to make sure their Neopets password wasn’t used on any other site. Which is why you use unique passwords on every site."
YouShouldKnow,fc46pbf,t1_fc3a0bx,1577408089.0,"Dashlane has a password changer too but I don’t use it, so I don’t know how much it costs. I use KeePass."
YouShouldKnow,fc46g7k,t1_fc3vg44,1577407892.0,"If you read the FAQ you will find it says that just because this particular site reports your email as no pwns found, doesn’t mean it never has been pwned.
