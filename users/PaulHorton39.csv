OculusQuest,ff2r125,t1_ff272nn,1579520196.0,"Great clip. As someone who has a fear of heights, Richies plank and the climb are great for getting the adrenaline pumping. What did you use to stream to the TV?"
OculusQuest,ff2qw7z,t3_er8uto,1579520000.0,"For me the climb is awesome. I have a fear of heights and I can honestly say I have never been more on edge playing a game. The thing is, everyone is different. I think what they have done on a mobile cpu, is tremendous."
OculusQuest,ff2qm0q,t3_er98te,1579519589.0,I love seeing posts like this. It just shows vr appeals to all ages. I hope she enjoyed the experience.
OculusQuest,ff2qexa,t3_er72tc,1579519297.0,"Big screen gets the thumbs up from me. They keep updating it which I always think is a sign of a good developer.
NETFLIX take note!"

awfuleverything,fednaar,t3_eohmo6,1579015665.0,This is shocking. I'd show it to my kids to scare them off drugs but would probably give them nightmares!
OculusQuest,fe7e7jm,t3_eo2i5x,1578913410.0,Great mod. Thank You for sharing.

OculusQuest,fd0zurt,t3_ejtely,1578126025.0,Rec room. Vr chat. Alt space VR. All 3 are great multiplayer. You get to explore amazing environments together.
OculusQuest,fckaftc,t3_ehmygv,1577720845.0,I have box vr on quest and I get vibration when playing. Check your settings.
OculusQuest,fcjxr6a,t3_ehku09,1577709666.0,"I agree also. Not used my psvr since getting a quest. The climb, real fishing, awesome tracking, freedom of movement, resolution increase, fast start-up portability, the list continues to grow."
PSVR,fcju7jq,t3_ehheoe,1577704946.0,"Arrr the classic ""but it's for the kids!"". Works every time. :)"
OculusQuest,fcjc1qu,t3_ehcuwf,1577682613.0,Try AltSpaceVR instead. Loads of user created experiences. Turn on beta rooms and your away. You meet loads of friendly users from all over the world.
OculusQuest,fcfki2k,t3_eh5ua8,1577630880.0,Also make sure your room is well lit.
OculusQuest,fce73xd,t1_fcawkt6,1577617508.0,Brilliant. Very clever. Will give it a go. Also thought about sitting in my garden in a deck chair for more realism. :)
OculusQuest,fca0rnn,t1_fc73cr4,1577561124.0,"Totally agree. The climb is beautiful. I have lost count of the times I've said ""oh wow!"" Playing it."
OculusQuest,fc9zkm9,t1_fc9z8r4,1577560568.0,Looks like the amazon basics case for the psvr. I have one. You can see the cuts you make in the foam for the quest to fit. Great case and cheap.
OculusQuest,fbtq1to,t3_ee6o18,1577089758.0,Excellent idea. Nice one.
