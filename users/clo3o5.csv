Either way he's way more likely to be even considered for a cabinet position by a Democrat. I think yang gang should think about the future. Yang may not win this election but I think a democratic president gets him in the administration. 

If he's not the nominee an endorsement from yang would be huge because at this point t even tho the main stream media isn't covering it, the yang gang is undeniable."

ibiza,fe8n663,t1_fe8ks3d,1578928176.0,"I purchased presale tickets to pacha last year for ‚Ç¨46. Day of was ‚Ç¨75. 

SHM day of sold out and the few tickets you could find on the island were all around ‚Ç¨200.

Black coffee pre sale ‚Ç¨20 day of ‚Ç¨50-60

A majority of people are not getting sick/breaking limbs. A majority of DJs are not cancelling. Yeah there is an off chance but people should plan their vacations on the rule not the exception, especially if they are on a budget. Ibiza gets expensive real quick and planning ahead let's you get some great prices on the first release of tickets. 

Besides if you are dead set on a specific party then why would you wait and risk it selling out or getting more expensive? It's best to lock it in with spotlight and you have up to 24 hours before to change your mind. 

If you are rich and money is not an issue then yeah don't buy tickets. But if you're on a budget like most ppl buy them ahead of time."

If you're certain about an event absolutely buy it online."
ibiza,fe7zgp8,t1_fe6t9qm,1578920834.0,"That's not true at all.  Ticket prices def go up especially for the most popular events. Not necessarily on the day of the event but as they get closer to the event.  The only event that's actually cheaper at the door is circoloco which you can avoid paying the ~‚Ç¨5 processing fee. 

Solomun +1 releases at around ‚Ç¨45 and will be ‚Ç¨80 day of. Same with alot of other events. SHM sold out last year. If I were tilisten to him I would have missed it. The black coffee party also released ‚Ç¨20 Tix last year when theynfirst went on sale then they went t0 ‚Ç¨45.

If there is a party you know you want to go to buy the Tix asap."

GIGABYTE GA-F2A88XN-WIFI FM2+/FM2 A88X (Bolton D4) Wi-Fi/BT4.0 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 HDMI Mini ITX AMD Motherboard
It has an SSD drive which im going to install PMS on and i plan on buying a high RPM drive for the library. (Small library, i usually delete movies after watching them unless I really love it and some audio).

I found a local guy that is willing to sell me 2 new DDR3 16 gb 1866mhz ram for $80. However doing some research it seems plex wont really benefit from the upgrade to 32gb.

My questions are:

Is the RAM upgrade overkill and even worth it?

Is a 7200 RPM drive good enough or should I spend a little more and get 10000 RPM for future proofing."

He was also very hostile when I didn‚Äôt want to meet with him cause I sorted out all my events myself.
