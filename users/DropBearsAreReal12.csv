I have a degree and it took me over 3 months and multiple interviews to find a job. In a totally different area that didn't require a degree. After a few weeks of looking I just started applying for retail jobs and the like. I still am unable to get full time work in my current job position without moving to a different sector, which I probably could do but I am now back at uni getting a masters and then a PhD during which I will be earning a lot less money than my 3-4 day a week job which only had first aid as a requirement. After that I'm not sure how much I'll be earning but it's not a whole lot."

They think because they're behind a computer screen that they aren't causing real harm, it's just fun for them to 'manipulate the system'. They don't realise their words cause real world harm. Heck there was someone on a post about Greg the wiggle (an Aussie icon my generation grew up with) insulting him and saying some awful stuff. This was right after he had a heart attack at a show raising money for the bushfires knowing he had a heart condition as well.

You have every right to feel hurt after a nasty comment like that and I'm sorry it happened. Just know that it wasn't a personal attack in respect to you. They do it because they find it fun and they're sick.

I'm not paying the same amount I paid for the Sims 3 pets pack back in the day to get two pets with some silly outfits that you can't even play as.

The lack of basic furnishings and building tools is killing me. I do like that you don't have to battle with the terrain anymore, but they could have just fixed it rather than remove it all together.

Edit: okay maybe complaining about Sims on a Sims subreddit was a bad idea. Graphics wise Sims 4 is very pretty, and you can make some pretty impressive builds. But taking away basic stuff really does impact the game."

todayilearned,fel53kr,t1_fek92lc,1579214247.0,"Just be aware that a lot of information on the internet tries to claim that drop bears are a hoax. This is the result of our government doing drop bear death coverups for decades, altering webpages, hiring actors, commenting on websites such as this one, all to make it look like a big Aussie joke. This is because tourism was being affected thanks to tourists being so scared of drop bears they stoppy coming to the country. However, the likelihood of running in to a drop bear here is not incredibly high, especially if you aren't near bushland. I believe it's more important to inform the public and prepare anyone coming here to make them as safe as possible. 

This is difficult thanks to all the misinformation out there. Nothing is a guaranteed to survive a drop bear encounter, but the Vegemite behind the ears trick does help. They have very sensitive noses and they don't like the smell. People who eat a lot of Vegemite are also at a lesser risk of attack as it's then in the blood stream. It's part of why we eat so much even though it tastes like ass. If you do happen to see what you believe is a drop bear, your best course of action is to walk away very quietly and hope it doesn't see you."

Some Aussies join in with the drop bear joke, trying to convince tourists they aren't real because they think it's funny.

sydney,fddiseb,t1_fddaeb4,1578313969.0,"Just so you don't go buying tickets hoping otherwise, you should know they probably won't be playing any  cockroach songs. From what I've heard about previous shows its basically just a kids wiggles concert but performed to adults."
sydney,fddimpg,t1_fdd9kmt,1578313794.0,"Nah they've done over 18s before. It's meant to be nostalgic for those who grew up with them, or those who watched with their kids. If they let in under 18s then they would get the wrong demographic. The original wiggles don't really do actual kid shows anymore (to my knowledge) they leave it to the new guys. If they did the kids wouldn't know who they were anyway."
sydney,fddi8eo,t1_fdd3f0p,1578313353.0,"Yep. They've done a few before with rather positive results. It lets people relive their childhood, whilst very drunk."
australia,fd68esl,t3_ek5big,1578187072.0,"I can completely understand how people might feel upset and outraged by the fact that the fireworks went ahead. It does seem in bad taste with everything that is going on. However, we need to stop the mentality that just because people are suffering, we need to stop everything and suffer as well. Now I don't mean we should just ignore the fires or completely lack empathy. The fires will always be in our thoughts, no matter where in Australia we are. But to deny people who are lucky enough to be safe at this moment the chance to have some happiness is not helpful. 

Not to mention, they had been planned well before we knew that the fires were going to be this intense, no money would be saved by cancelling. And yes, it sounds silly to worry about tourism at a time like this but ultimately, Sydney relies on tourism money to survive. Cancelling one of the biggest events of the year would put a significant dent in the states funds, which are already low due to bushfire efforts."
coolguides,fd61rz2,t1_fd5vs4z,1578184345.0,"Well that's simply untrue. It may have stemmed from the fact that we do in fact have trains, but they run so infrequently and are so often delayed and cancelled that they have become a bit of a myth. Some people have never actually seen one they're so rare."
badwomensanatomy,fd5vp6m,t1_fd4bc6p,1578182080.0,"Ah all good, I wasn't exactly sure what you meant so I just covered it anyway."
coolguides,fd5vb6b,t1_fd2j9vs,1578181941.0,"Thank you, I take the issue of drop bears very seriously and I want to make sure anyone who might come to this country is properly informed. The government has put out many websites etc. claiming that drop bears are a hoax in order to promote tourism, but we've had so many drop bear fatalities lately (particularly tourists) that I can no longer stand for it."
insanepeoplefacebook,fd5uu4m,t1_fd4aqtc,1578181776.0,"Well I think he was more referring to us eating at cafes etc. rather than at home. Also, for some reason avocado prices are ridiculous here, a smashed avo at a hipster cafe might be $10 or more. Regardless, housing prices in Sydney are astronomical. I live in Sydney but a good hour away from the inner city and houses here all go for over $1mil. A nice, spacey family home would go closer to $2mil. It's also not unusual to be paying $300+ a week in rent and utilities to live in a shitty shared apartment, which makes it difficult to save much. If someone stopped eating smashed avo it would take well over 250 years (likely closer to 300, more for the nice house) before you could afford a house with the money."
insanepeoplefacebook,fd5t3se,t1_fd2it1s,1578181198.0,Yeah. Living prices are going up and up and wages are not rising accordingly. It's harder to find full time work and many people are busy with multiple jobs and don't have as much time to do stuff. But us not spending the money we do have on frivolous stuff is a travesty!
insaneparents,fd5rx6r,t1_fd24l5w,1578180806.0,"I'm sorry you're in that situation. The best advice I have is that even if it's hard for a while when you leave, it will be okay. If you have some good friends hit them up and they may be able to offer you more personal advice and help. But if you stay at home then the cycle of abuse continue.

As for what to say to your dad, I think the best you can do is just remind him you are a legal adult and it important for you to make your own decisions. If he can't accept that you might just need to keep some distance, at least for a while, once you're out or you may risk getting dragged back in. I'm sorry I don't have more or better advice, but I wish you all the luck."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd21ydu,t1_fd207tv,1578140406.0,"Ah don't worry, you aren't being insensitive at all. It's good to think of other things and make jokes during hard times. Thank you, though."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd1zq42,t1_fd1xp4c,1578139362.0,"Real talk, ironically it's not the wildlife I'm terrified of right now. There won't be any of it left to kill us soon of these fires don't calm down."
Emuwarflashbacks,fd1xvah,t3_ejromc,1578138527.0,The train I caught to school every morning ended at Emu Plains. I always thought about skipping school one day and just staying on the train until the end to see what was there. I was too chicken though.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd1x5jx,t1_fd1uu91,1578138210.0,"Precisely. There's no reason for me to be lying, I could just tell you about another one of our deadly animals. Like the cassowary, also known as a death chicken."
insanepeoplefacebook,fd1s5nz,t1_fd00k9v,1578135960.0,That's the same one who suggested us millennials stop buying smashed avo if we wanted to afford a house right?
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd1rsgk,t1_fd1i1pt,1578135792.0,"I've lived in Australia my whole life, drop bears are most definitely real. Living near the bush we had drop bear drills where we had to learn what do do if a drop bear was spotted. Those things are not to messed with. My dad lost a brother to one once, he forgot to put Vegemite behind his ears before he went on a hike. Apparently the body was mauled beyond recognition when they found him, they had to go off dental records."
