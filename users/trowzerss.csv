There are many other genetic conditions as well that put the lie to the whole 'there's only male and female' idea. There are shades of grey, which is why we get into this who debate.

Copying this as you also appear to be ignorant of how complicated biological sex is, never mind the affect that might have on gender. (Biological sex and gender not being the same things). You also have the issue of naturally high testosterone XX females and XY males with androgen insensitivity who for all appearances look like women (and in fact, look more feminine than most women, with idealised female features as they don't react to testosterone much or at all)

You have some catching up to do. If you want to be at all taken seriously on this subject, you need to address these realities."

Even if they're getting around tariffs, it's putting Chinese money back into the Australian economy and also encouraging China to increase regulation to prevent money going overseas. A few local supply issues are minor in comparison. (I mean, it would be better if the money didn't go to multinational shopping centres, but the Chinese do focus a lot on Australian owned and manufactured products as more trustworthy than foreign owned, so they do support local industry) The daigou buyers are often students who send some wages home, but put most of it back into our education systems as foreign student fees are very expensive. So all up a lot of the money stays in Australia even further down the chain."
worldnews,ffdacb7,t1_ffcky8m,1579816561.0,"That's the daigou. It's a whole industry. They buy products like baby formula in a country with good regulations like Australia, and then resell it back in China. Some people get upset about it but I'm happy for anything that brings Chinese money back into the Australian economy. It also puts pressure on the Chinese government to increase regulation to stop the drain on their economy, so I see it as win-win even if it causes a few local supply issues in Australia.

I mean, even Australian fruit packaging is copied within China, so for instance cherry farmers have to put special hard-to-copy sealed packaging on their cherry boxes to prevent it being replaced by cheaper imitations. so after the milk scandal, Chinese really want to get products from a trusted location. They mainly transfer baby, health and beauty products."

I learnt to pause what i was saying when she focused her eyes on something else too intently, to the point where when she grew out of the seizures, she used to get annoyed with me for stopped mid-sentence whenever she was just normally distracted or looking at something when I was speaking to her. I think they stopped for her when she was about 12-13 and she didn't have any issues after that."
australia,fevk9j0,t1_fev65j8,1579398375.0,"I don't have a car and mainly walk/use public transport and have rarely flown anywhere, so I'm pretty sure my carbon footprint is a hell of a lot lower than most. I also recycle, compost and have a garden and plants in every room in my house.

I can't read that article without a login, but I'm guessing their tips are pretty similar. I just wish I could buy in bulk more, but that's not as practical in a single person household. I'd also love to install solar panels, but can't in a rented apartment."

Writworthy is the bomb. I did 72 writs the other day in less than half an hour. Turning them in almost took longer than the crafting part."
australia,fev2qd1,t1_feupyiq,1579392479.0,"It's what I've been thinking for a while. A lot of this anger is because people are being told they don't have to do anything, it's not an issue. But most people know otherwise and want to be give direction and leadership on what *they* can do to do their part. People don't want to sit on their hands while the world goes to shit, they want to help out. They want to be given something constructive to do. Pollies need to pick up on that and stop telling people it's not a thing."
rareinsults,fergesi,t1_fer82ew,1579353586.0,"That explains her eyes (I actually worked with someone with Graves disease for many years so I've seen how it affects appearance), not the filler and tucked nose, lipo, breast implants, a lot of other face stuff etc. She's got the classic filler duck mouth. She's pretty open about her extensive surgery, so it's no secret she's spent a lot of money there. It just points out added hypocrisy, that she would make fun of someone with a medical issue when her own appearance has been altered by a disease. It's like because she spent money to try and 'fix' every 'flaw' that gives her the right to mock people who for all she knows are perfectly okay with the way they look."

rareinsults,fepsezj,t1_fepeoy7,1579329680.0,"I mean, it's not like that's her natural appearance. A lot of work went into that look. That's kind of different than making fun of someone for a birth defect."
australia,fepsa54,t1_feprly1,1579329554.0,I've noticed most major supermarkets have them now (eg Coles and Woolies). Which makes sense as it's a place a lot of sick and elderly people will still go out of necessity.
australia,fepqzkw,t1_fepmxma,1579328344.0,"Yeah, considering there was a nurse in the audience who used a defibrillator (which they have on hand at many venues now) it sounds like he's lucky there was a timely intervention and it didn't happen when he was alone or traveling."

AskReddit,femy8sk,t1_femwb3b,1579272689.0,">Why subject yourself to that. 

Better than not getting help and then doing something and going to jail? Some people really need that accountability or they'll do something stupid."
AskReddit,femvzrg,t1_femkv23,1579271067.0,"There are specialist centers that deal with people with those kinds of issues because it's more common than most people would believe. They will refer the person to authorities, but just to ensure there's nothing illegal going on. Once that's ascertained, then they can start therapy and as long as the person doesn't report any illegal activity there's no further action. People can even self-refer, but it's usually part of court action. At least, that's how it works in Australia.

But of course nobody would be able to assist in any professional capacity unless they were sure nothing illegal was happening, that's just common sense. But it's like people with suicidal ideation - they help people find better coping strategies, and it sometimes even includes medication. It's not 100% but there definitely is stuff they have worked out to help people with those problems."
