socialanxiety,feuuvfv,t1_feps0sb,1579390190.0,a presentation in school or a teacher forcing you to read stuff in front of a class is in no way a therapy. it is traumatising.

ADHD,fdrhmn4,t1_fdralca,1578684592.0,isn't this about diabetes?
ADHD,fdnbfic,t1_fdnb5z9,1578582151.0,"thanks. I don't think this one will last all that long however. it's the third time it's happening actually, and thankfully I have a ha ndy little grammar book to occupy myself with until it passes away. and then on to the next thing, and the next one and the next one. you know I think the term jack of all trades was coined to describe adhd people when it didn't have a name yet."
ADHD,fdnb0q3,t3_em3dpz,1578581884.0,"Well, this is basically all I understand to be hyperfication. it almost feels like compulsion at times, for example for the last two days Ive been studying Welsh grammar, i don't even know where it came from, its just this sudden inexplicable burst of interest that I can't suppress, so I have to do it even when I'm watching YouTube videos, or I'll be reading a book and suddenly I want to check the Welsh equivalent of every interesting word on the page or something. it's not like I can't do anything else during these periods, but the interest consumes the majority of my attention and mental effort. I don't know though, I don't think the name is adequate enough, It doesn't feel like what I think something called ""hyper focus"" should feel. it's more like sudden, usually inexplicable burst of interest in a thing or subject (or even person, usually famous or a historical figure maybe) which lasts for varying periods of time and wanes just as quickly and inexplicably as it fired up. my longest ones last for a few months at most, and shortest are a few hours to few days."
ADHD,fdn95hm,t3_em7f01,1578580594.0,be invested in them. you can't force anything.
literature,fdmy9a6,t3_em5vpr,1578571103.0,"on the other hand, he has always had a very solid stance on exactly how much autobiographical a work usually is or can be, a subject which he discusses both in his essay books and his interviews. he even rejects the idea that Kafka's ""K"" s are in any sense the author's reference to himself. if I remember correctly he talks about it in les testaments trahis so I guess I'd recommend that."
ADHD,fdkpx4i,t1_fdklcas,1578508698.0,"I'm exactly the same. however I become most conscious of this during class because, I feel like I'm exploding with something to say and want to simply burst out and say it but I'm contradicted by the general quietness of the class as well as my social anxiety which gives me a heart attack even with just a look from a stranger and it feels like being caged in a corpse over which I no have no control... it was better in middle school, but then other students as well as teachers began to feel contempt for me because I was continously interrupting class

nowadays, I have very few people I'm comfortable with, and I'm continously interrupting them because I feel like I just have to get that thought out of me, whereas everyone else I know thinks I'm the most gentle, respectful and quiet youth ever. which in turn reinforces social anxiety because I'm sure that if they get to know how I behave normally, they will reject me (which was happened many times before)"
ADHD,fdfmyh7,t1_fdf5sxs,1578365425.0,"I dream in the exact opposite way. my dreams are so focused and vivid that after waking up I feel withdrawal symptoms (like I'm addicted to the dream). on the other hand my certainly not-adhd, very healthy and normal friend has the wildest most racing dreams ever and its crazy. so, yeah I don't know if they're related that much."

socialanxiety,fcmnsq5,t1_fcml6ac,1577783379.0,"Thank you!! Sometimes when I feel really disfunctional, I imagine how many people there must be like me or worse than me whom I just don't know about, and that kinda makes me feel better sometimes, like I belong, to an imaginary club of failures... Sigh.. But also makes me happy-ish through compassion.."
socialanxiety,fcmnnjn,t1_fcm7thh,1577783178.0,"Thing is, I can't convince myself I have anxiety. It feels like I'm just being extremely avoidant, I don't have too much problem in open space for example, I can interact with people enough to survive, but I can't talk to people I don't know for more than a few ninutes, my mouth gets dry quickly and I get stressed and sweaty and my voice shaky. I know these are probably clear signs, but they just don't feel enough of an impediment. On the other hand it's virtually impossible for me to enter closed, claustrophobic spaces (anywhere from campus to a small book shop). In the case of small shop, I just feel very uncomfortable, start blushing and sweating, but otherwise I'm fine, so again, kinda manageable although it's certainly not nice and makes me avoid these situations. And on campus, I feel like every single person is looking at me and judging me, so if I don't look at anyone, I can quickly pass through or by them and get to class. Once I sit down, if I don't move very much and don't talk to anyone and the teacher doesn't talk to me, I'll be mildly OK, although still very stressed.

I know I should consult some professional, but I just can't because I feel like I have so many problems that it can't be real or that they aren't serious enough. I live with my mother who's very supporting normally, but she's also physically sick and very very panicky, so I can never talk to her about my health because it crushes her and makes her even sicker. Plus, mental health is not really a thing where I live, and I don't have any friends (literally) whom I could talk to or get support. There was one girl who liked me, but I had to reject her because I was sure she'd judge me for being unmaly or something, and thst was my only interaction with a peer for the last four years since I graduated from high school.

As for serious therapy, I feel that even the therapist would make fun of me or judge me because I have a comfortable life and pretty much anything I need financially and yet here I'm bragging while there are so, so many people living in absolute hell and they would never be able to afford therapy and have to live on heroin or whatever. Am I making sense? Sorry"
depression,fclutif,t3_ehvm62,1577756997.0,Maybe you just have a sleep problem. So you have nay other depressive symptoms like ambivalent appetite or sudden loss of interest in things?

socialanxiety,fciorcx,t1_fci7t4a,1577666291.0,This is one of the reasons I repeated four semesters...
socialanxiety,fciodnb,t1_fcih9hr,1577666059.0,"Thanks for the suggestions. I'm not far into my major unfortunately, I'm basically non-existent as far as school is concerned. And at this point I don't think anything can reanimate that passion for my major.

And I really am a failure. I basically have nothing in life with which I can rationally fight back the negative thoughts. I live with my sick mother and live off her income (she works, isn't that sick). I have no friends, literally, no social life and i know that certain (distant) family members are making fun of me and my mother. The only people I had regular contact with and I knew who cared for me both died out of no where along with their dog so now there's nothing, literally nothing left of them. Etc. I could go on ad infinitum. All facts. Anyway again thanks for the suggestions. I can understand how bad the slowness must feel. I hope you conquer all this soon... It really does suck :("

socialanxiety,fcifh7h,t1_fcidley,1577661742.0,"I mean I have all of the same things right now and have had them at different periods in the past. I'm about to drop out of college because I can't bring myself to study or even write the answers I already know during the exam. (even though my major was my passion) Even entering a crowded classroom is difficult because of social anxiety. I feel numb all throughout the day and although previously I had many hobbies, I no longer do anything, have no desire to do any thing, feel empty, broken. The one thing I do is ruminate on how pitiful and disgusting I have become and how I don't really exist, and once I start thinking about death and catastrophes I end up crying. It's OK when that happens home but recently it's been forcing its way in public, and that's embarrassing and shameful. 
Anyway your situation sounds a bit worse than mine because currently I don't have too much issue with psychomotor skills (ie slowness).

My only worthwhile suggestion is to seek a mental health professional. Please, please save yourself"
socialanxiety,fcidhjs,t3_ehbc1r,1577660922.0,"Sorry to hear all this. I have lived through similar things in the past and still do. To me, it sounds like depression."
socialanxiety,fc7ywaq,t3_egdo9j,1577522338.0,"Same. Although as a man, it was much easier when I hand long hair. The reason I have this barber anxiety in particular is because our education system forced us to have a haircut, and I really liked my hair when I was little so being taken to a barbershop felt like torture, especially since I never liked how they cut it but couldn't speak up about it so I just had to endure this thing they were doing to my body. Not to mention, as a child I often cried at the barbershop."

ADHD,fbc59q8,t1_fbbr9b2,1576715996.0,"I can set out to the kitchen to wash the dishes just fine. I can leave my room, cross the corridor, and then I'll be thinking about what time it is, maybe I should've went out today, why is the weather still so bad, how n it was last year, some flashbacks from my holiday from years ago, and then I see some picture on the wall in the living room (and that's where I am now, not the kitchen, but the living room), I formulate some opinion about its framing on the spot, maybe I could remove it and make a new one? Where would I get wood for it and how would I cut it etc? didn't I have a saw in the balcony? Then I go out into the balcony, notice my unfinished clay project lying there all sad, I take it up, go back to my room, get out my chisels etc, and then in the process of decluttering my study desk to make space to work on clay I find my old notebook, start going through it, lots of memories and flashbacks, ""oh I can't remember I took this note all the way back in high-school! "" etc, and then I figure to check my watch only to learn that five hours have passed and I need to be out to meet some people or something soon and the dishes will never ever ever be done."
