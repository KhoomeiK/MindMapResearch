As for the ignorance;

ignorant 
/Àà…™…°n(…ô)r(…ô)nt/ 
adjective 
1.
lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.

I didn‚Äôt use it as an accusation, but rather a description. The downvotes here are due to the way your tone is perceived, but you‚Äôve clarified that genuinely didn‚Äôt know since then, so that‚Äôs that. Again, my tone was in response to the way I felt you were speaking to us, but I‚Äôve since found that to have been wrong.

I ask you not to generalise what the people on this sub are like. It‚Äôs me who spoke; not them. Also, I know the ‚Äòenjoy being hungry‚Äô remark was a final dig, but I‚Äôve got to tell you that it has really decreased the integrity of what you‚Äôve said in that comment. I wish you well."
safe_food,fef1uc9,t1_fef143h,1579046198.0,"Wowee, ignorance on another level! Well done, you lack empathy and the ability to step outside of your own shoes. You think we don‚Äôt know our opinions on food are severely disordered? (Again, read the sub‚Äôs description). This sub is so we can come together for support, and so we can share food which doesn‚Äôt make us feel as guilty as we would otherwise when eating. If communities like ours didn‚Äôt exist, we‚Äôd all be eating much less than we are now. Low cal food still offers energy, which is enough for us while we start our journey into recovery. 

If you were a troll, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. But you‚Äôre just rather uneducated on the matter. I hope that sorts itself out."
safe_food,fef16v3,t1_fef05ib,1579045759.0,"You‚Äôre ignorant, because you‚Äôre lacking the knowledge. That‚Äôs what that means. And the sub‚Äôs description basically spells out exactly what safe food is."
