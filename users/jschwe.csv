I just think 5 minutes is a super small window to give movies, that's all. You need to give things more of a chance than that! Unless you're exaggerating to make a point, in which case nevermind"
AskReddit,ffb0zom,t1_ffaxpq0,1579749110.0,I just can't think of many movies that AREN'T boring if you only give them five minutes. Do you think star wars sucks because all those movies are is a bunch of text scrolling across a screen?
AskReddit,ffaljjr,t1_ffajamy,1579738767.0,I don't understand how people can watch five minutes of a two hour movie and come to a decisive conclusion on it.

Greyhounds,fdfz8v5,t3_el45f8,1578374458.0,"Just make sure you keep it clean and covered. Our pup skinned his leg pretty badly this fall and it took 6+ weeks to heal, I wasn't as careful as I should've been by the end of it (poor guy was so sick of bandages) and I strongly suspect that is how he ended up with the bone infection he is currently battling.

My intention is not to be alarmist--our case is certainly not the norm. Just wanted to put it out there that any open wound is still technically a risk. Hope it heals up well for you, their tissue paper skin can really be a struggle!!"

books,fcvozmi,t3_eixln2,1578006849.0,"This is probably true for a lot of people, and is especially good to keep in mind during ""resolution season"", but in my case at least, the exact opposite is true.  Forcing myself to read books I normally wouldn't touch, and reaching for a high yearly target are precisely the things that reignited my passion for reading this year. I am very glad I shoved myself outside my comfort zone."
books,fcn7lpj,t1_fcn4npl,1577805356.0,"Ah ok, I read that it was a 'follow-up' which is what led me to believe sequel. Still, I'll add it to my list! Thanks"
books,fcn5alq,t1_fcj1ikp,1577803649.0,"I love the idea of a book club, but scheduling always seems to be such a hurdle. Did you find it added to your experience of the books you went through together?

Also I definitely recommend Discworld! They are a ton of fun. I would recommend starting with Guards! Guards! but I think that's a pretty popular opinion."
books,fcn4kbq,t1_fckj0y6,1577803085.0,"Did you like Recursion? I read Dark Matter by Blake Crouch this year and it was pretty good, it looks like Recursion is the sequel? I didn't realize there was one!"
books,fcn4c1k,t3_efe5j4,1577802901.0,"I realized at the beginning of the year that, even though I considered myself a reader, I hardly did any of it anymore. So I set myself a list of 50 books. I must've really missed it, because I ended up getting through 57.

[Here is my Goodreads Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/104064851-jen-boehm?per_page=75&shelf=2019&utf8=%E2%9C%93)

**Favourites:**

1. **East of Eden** by *John Steinbeck*. This was a beautiful read, and I felt like I enjoyed every page. It resonated with something within me, I think. I loved the experience of getting to know the characters and watching them move through their lives. While I was reading this, I very much felt like I was enjoying the process itself, and not just reading to find out what happens next, if that makes sense.
2. **Working Stiff** by *Judy Melinek*. Such an interesting look into an industry I know very little about. I read several autobiographical books this year and it became clear very quickly that not everyone can write a compelling book, even if they have led an interesting life. This was very well written, funny, and incredibly moving.
3. **To Say Nothing Of The Dog** by *Connie Willis*. This became an instant favourite of mine. It was silly, and confusing from the start, but it made me happy with that somehow. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it's part of a series!

**Did not enjoy:**

1. **Artemis** by *Andy Weir*. After The Martian, I was so looking forward to this, but it was such a letdown. The main character felt like a reskinned version of Mark Watney, and the immature humor / abrasive personality of Jazz seemed like a bad fit here. It came off as incredibly forced, and felt very much like a man writing what he thinks 'the perfect cool woman' would be like. Yuck. He also added racial elements seemingly only for diversity bonus points, as those aspects barely affected the characters or story in any way. Add to that the fact that the plot was lackluster and the majority of the exciting bits were interrupted with pages of descriptions of welding in space...it just didn't hit home with me.
2. **Animal Farm** by *George Orwell*. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me, I don't know what I was expecting from this book. It was pretty basic, and I understood the point he was trying to make within the first few pages. Seemed like a waste of time to me, though I suppose I'm not exactly the target audience.
3. **Believe Me** by *Eddie Izzard.* This came highly recommended, but it was such a bland read. Izzard has had a colourful life and so I thought surely his memoir would reflect that, but it was incredibly dull and I felt myself struggling to care about any of it."
books,fcn0wr8,t1_fcmxn52,1577800039.0,"I think I agree with you on both counts--I definitely found Mistborn felt very YA. I've got both sequels on my TBR but I am definitely looking more forward to Malazan. What would you say you enjoyed most from your list?

Edit: went back and saw you already put your favorites at the bottom haha oops. How did you feel about Rothfuss? I've heard mixed reviews and am not sure if I should take the plunge so to speak"
books,fcl6qod,t1_fcjwsof,1577741007.0,"Gardens of the Moon and Mistborn: The Final Empire were both also on my list this year! What did you think of them?

I found myself struggling to get into GotM for easily the first half of the book, but it finally grabbed me near the end and I surprised myself by adding the next one to my 'to read' list."

aww,fc7oivt,t3_egkgtq,1577514371.0,"We have a cat that is 3, yowls in the middle of the night, and demands constant attention. Good to know that doesn't wear off with age..."
aww,fc7l7rc,t1_fc6u8u6,1577511039.0,Our one cat died young of a blood clot (saddle thrombosis). It was such a heartbreaking experience and he was truly wonderful. Sorry to hear we aren't the only ones.
aww,fc7kmel,t3_egisn6,1577510470.0,Our dog does this too! But he's an anxious boy so I've always translated it as making sure I'm still there haha

tattoos,fbxve3u,t1_fbxie71,1577201515.0,Ok but the first star wars movie is already like 40 years old are you telling me ten years from now we are going to have a mass blackout and entirely forget what Yoda looks like
