It being problematic is situational. It can be an advantage or a disadvantage. When you just call it toxic you are being shortsighted. Men pressuring other men to fit is toxic, the behavior itself isn't.

Make-up and the fashion industry should also be considered toxic femininity, those are also very problematic, yet there are never any words used to describe phenomenons related to women that is etymologically related to women.

>a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.

So black people are definitely facing many disadvantages, but are white people as a whole really getting exclusive advantages?

There is more than just white and black, there is also Middle-easterners, Latinos and Asians which are also doing better than black, Asians are even doing better than whites in many things. 

It's also pretty strange to talk about a privilege when the vast majority of people get it, privilege is something small groups get.

Ultimately race is much less important than class. A rich black, Latino, native or Asian will do better in most things than a middle-class white person and a poor white will do worse than a middle-class black person. Racism against black is less in the results as in the processes that kept or are still keeping them from raising in class. Increased conviction and time has much more to do with a lack of lawyer which is linked to poverty, and repeated offenses which is also linked to poverty and a lack of support systems. 

Does it matter to the uneducated child of meth-head parents that an equally uneducated black person will pass after him if the educated black person also pass before him? That's a pretty insignificant advantage. That uneducated white person will also get higher sentence and worse health-care than a educated black person. The uneducated white will obviously get mad if you tell him he has privilege when most black people are doing better than him and privilege is something usually rich people have. When those same uneducated white poor people are the ones voting in the people creating racist systems, it's probably best not to use language that will fuel their resentment and make them easier to manipulate.

 How a ethnicity is viewed is almost always linked to its average richness as it's affect the group's power/influence. Europeans would have had a much harder time with their racist ideology and excusing chattel slavery if Africans countries were equally rich and developed as Europe and people in other countries wouldn't see white people as more positive than other races if white people weren't the most powerful. Increase black people's economic situation and racism will decrease dramatically. 

The problem with that is the pretty vicious circle regarding black people since they are so much poorer that people are allowed to make systems to discriminate against them and keep them poorer which keep the racism which keep the systems.

Not being afraid of cops is not white privilege, there is only black people scared of cops, Latinos and Asians don't have that problem either, so how is it white privilege? Though that point is currently arguable with the Latinos and Trump's hate boner for them.

So much of what is ""white"" privilege is a ""all-but-not-black"" privilege or a ""majority"" privilege."

A black woman in the justice system do better than a white man on average. This is also a part of intersectionality. Ultimately being rich is what really makes one better off in the justice system. That's why Asian are the ones doing the best in it since in the US they are also the richest on average.

Après les ICBMs ont aussi des systèmes pour déjouer les missiles d'interceptions et se cacher des radars. 

C'est aussi impossible d'avoir un missile qui va à la vitesse d'un missile balistique intercontinental qui descend en phase terminale.

I never talked about foreign aid until you did, I never said it can't become bloated. But what you said about it is just false. In itself foreign aid is supposed to be charitable, not that it actually is since it is given in exchange for greater power projection by the US military. They don't have to justify anything, it's the US who decide to give it. It's to the US to justify its own budget, not other countries. The price has not crept up under the Democrats, it has crept up under the Republican, it stayed the same under Democrats or went down. Foreign aid tend to go up with foreign wars. Foreign aid also tend to go up with climatic problems caused by pollution and go down with other countries becoming richer.

They have already been making high grade radioactive material for bombs for years, they stopped making it and started destroying them under Obama's deal. They started making it again after Trump broke the deal, Iran even gave time for the US to come back in the deal and didn't restart production immediately after Trump broke the deal hoping Europe could convince the US.

Oh come the fuck on. The US was not sliding into a one world government, other countries wouldn't join the US into all their bullshit. Unless you mean a world governed by billionaires that don't care about national boundaries in which case Trump has done way more than Hillary ever would for billionaires.

The people of Israel are not the oppressed group, the Palestinians are. Israel refuse to treat Palestinians humanly, Iran is right to say they can only be freed through force after 60 years of oppression and attempted negotiations to free them that ended-up nowhere. The exit strategy is Israel existing no more and Palestine getting back its lands. Israel get what it sows. The USSR also didn't have much of an exit strategy for Nazi Germany. Exit strategies tend to be neglected in wars. That's why you normally try to be decent and not get into wars.

Do you realize the number of countries with dictators that are US allies? Saudi-Arabia being one of them. Also the number of such dictators the US put in place. Iran is leagues better than NK and women are about as free as Saudi-Arabia if not more so, they are mostly not equal under the law. But women can still go to school and university, hold public office, drive and show their face which I'd say is above average for a Islamic country, Saudi-Arabia only recently gave the right to drive to women and they jailed those that pushed for it.

> The countries of the world are not big groups of friends like you make it seem.

It's you who think they are a big group of friends. I already said all countries are self-centered and lie, Iran isn't unique in that because of some Islamic doctrine, the doctrine isn't to lie for no reason like Trump, it's to lie to protect Islam's interest, they have no reason to lie about this and there were already procedure put in place to make sure they were not lying. Most country just hold themselves to their treaty and contract because breaking them set a bad precedent and make further treaties and contract harder, as with Trump.

>There has been plenty of speculation on Iran's dabbling in radioactive technology

So what? Radiation is used for medical use and plenty of things. They can already do what you say. Those other power will not help them, they don't benefit from Iran having those weapons either, they are the easiest targets for Iran.

>Which is in a way why you can't blame China or Russia for attempting to meddle in our elections, do we not do the same and apparently get away with it? 

All humans are also self-serving, it doesn't mean we just let people punch us in the face without doing anything. 

Drones can be shot down. Targeted missiles are nothing new.

Foreign aid is not a bloat, it's a military and economic strategy. That aid has never come for free, it's often in part given to allow military bases on their territory.

Trump has lied more than10 times on each day of his presidency. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/

Trump will go down in history as the point where the US lost its place as world leader.

Iran has been quite clear there is no way to free Israel in a humanitarian way and Israel has also been clear there is none."

Iran was trying to turn a new leaf and move forward, everyone was on board with it, only Trump and his warmonger wanted otherwise. There has never been such a pendulum swing before, Trump completely discredited the US politically worldwide, no country trust the US anymore. There is a reason why Europe want to increase their military fund and it isn't Trump asking for it, it's them realizing the US is absolutely not a reliable ally, that's why Macron is pushing for an European army.

Iran was respecting all its engagements in regard to the treaty, there was oversight put in place to insure they did, unlike with NK. They never reneged promises, only Trump and the US has done that. NK is a unique situation but all presidents have treated them the same, except for Trump, and NK made a complete joke of Trump and the US now because of it by getting all the propaganda material they wanted with the US president saying how great of a guy Kim is and how NK is a great country while giving absolutely nothing in return because Trump is a shit negotiator.

All countries do everything because it's beneficial to them. The US isn't spending a stupid amount on military and having so many oversea bases out of kindness and good intention. All that military is to have greater power projection and influence on world affair to get an advantage economically or to just plain steal resources as with Iran and Iraq.

All countries conceal and dissimulate shit, that's why the treaty with Iran had foreign oversight to make sure they were following up with their promises. The US is especially culpable of that. The number of countries that had their democratic government overthrown show that pretty well. Also the number of assassinations in south-America of politicians.

Don't need religion to lie, Trump do it all the time for no fucking reason or for money.

Saying they want Israel to disappear is nothing new, in 2000 Khomeini already clarified that they mean the state and not Jews which will not be harmed even in Iran. They consider Israel an illegal state. That's why they talk about how they hate Zionists and not Jews. Zionists are those promoting the settling of Palestine and push for the policies that treat Palestinians like the Nazis treated the Jews. Jalali is basically like an American general in ww2 saying they will eliminate Nazi Germany. Jalali is also known to be an extremist in Iran.
It should also be pointed out that Israel has repeatedly stated they would use nuclear weapons against Iran if they didn't stop their nuclear development and they have assassinated multiple nuclear scientists in Iran and have done multiple sabotages.

The national security advisor of the US, John Bolton, also said the coup in Venezuela is just about getting oil.

By making a treaty to stop the research and development of nuclear weapons in exchange for reestablishing normal relation with Iran and with the rest of the world by stopping the sanctions the country was under thus eliminating the reliance on Russia as strategic ally. A treaty Trump broke.

Iran is only a strategic ally of Russia because it has been pushed to be one after the US's CIA organized a coup to depose the previous democratically elected government and installed a dictator to secure Iran as an ally and steal their oil , which Iran had nationalized away from British ownership, which ended in a counter revolution hostile to the US. Before that Iran was a strategic ally of the US.

Your link only agree with what I say. Anthropologists also agree that it is a social construct.

>Race refers to a person's physical characteristics, such as bone structure and skin, hair, or eye color.

A black person with blue eyes and red hair is black or white?

Indians with darker skin and a bone structure more like that of white people are white or black? 

What constitute races is a pure social construct, there is no objectivity, it is only based on the utility people find in it. Before Darwinism and colonialism it was based on country, language and religion, it was pretty much what ethnicity is now, after it was based on skin color to discriminate against black people.
