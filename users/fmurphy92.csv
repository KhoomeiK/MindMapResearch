Considering I wasn't mocking OP or calling him a loser, but you are calling me that, you would seem to be the one who knows nothing of acting like a respectable  person.

Also, I would love to know how an independent (myself) that is pointing out the flaws of both sides is now a Trump supporter? That's the tribalism that is ruining America ""If you ain't with us, you're against us!"""

I know if Trump did retaliate with an airstrike Reddit would hang him for that too.

I fucking hate Trump, but the radically left Reddit literally criticizes everything he does or doesn't do. He can do absolutely NOTHING right.

The majority of Reddit is no better than the right. Same people just playing a different side of the field."
