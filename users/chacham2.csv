That is different than you original statement, and while closer to the truth, is still incorrect. One issue is ""for the benefit of a Jew"" is not accurate, and you also seem to be conflating two separate rules: paying for the work and of benefiting from it.

Paying for the work is forbidden when the work can only be done on Shabbos, given time constraints. However, if i paid him for the work and he decided on his own to do the work on Shabbos, it is perfectly okay.

If a Jew does work for me on Shabbos, regardless of whether i asked him to do it, if he had me in mind to benefit, i may not benefit from it. However, according to the Pri Megodim, if a non-Jew is paid to do work by another non-Jew, even if ultimately for the benefit of a Jew, there is to be lenient."

>When Marcus failed to respond with the password, Linski fired in the air and the man ran towards the monastery. He fired at the man, as did one or more fighters in a nearby sentry post. Marcus was found dead, wrapped in a white blanket. Marcus knew very little Hebrew and had responded in English, which Linski did not understand. Marcus wore no rank, although officers had been recognized by a ribbon pinned to their uniforms. As Marcus's body was removed from Abu Ghosh, a ribbon was found and placed on his casket."
