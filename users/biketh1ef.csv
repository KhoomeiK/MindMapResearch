ModSupport,fekkuc5,t1_fekkloa,1579202144.0,"Never hurts to send a modmail to reddit.com/r/reddit.com. 

Just to put it into perspective, you're basically going into a thread about a cute puppy, and complaining about sharks eating too many seals. That's why you're getting a negative reaction."
ModSupport,fekk932,t1_fekgvko,1579201799.0,"Boss man, no one is being disrespectful, unless that's what you think all the downvoted are for. There are better avenues to report mods for abuse and all that, this just isn't the thread for it. 

Passive aggressively editing this comment leads me to believe you're just an asshole looking for a problem, but that's another story."
ModSupport,feki8hb,t1_fekhs1f,1579200588.0,This isn't the correct topic to be REEEing about mod abuse.

Just a note: A meme that has been crossposted from another sub does not qualify it as a repost, as we only require that the meme has not been posted in THIS sub. The original post was in /r/memes, so it is allowed here.

Credit does, however, belong to /u/Shiroyaksha19 [for his post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ekr7dt/she_knows_another_chance_wont_come/)"
