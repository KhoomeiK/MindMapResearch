It wasn't criticized then and it isn't being criticized now. The movie's use of the word ""retarded"" was WAY more controversial when it came out than the blackface portion, and even then it was only a small number of advocacy groups.

It was a great use of satire when it came out and the vast, vast, vast majority of audiences understand the point it was trying to make. I'm sure you could find a handful of tweets and an article or two criticizing it but there's simply never been a controversy."

He tried to spin his apology into a “learning” moment but he didn’t learn shit. He puts his stupid idea of “art” above actual victims and when called out he cried crocodile tears.

He may be a good filmmaker but people should be aware that Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and others think what Roman Polanski did (drugging and anally raping a child) isn’t bad so long as you have a good RT score."

I realize he had some character development in other areas that defenders will point out but at this point the standard Marvel-esque humor is just too noticeable for me. They basically just copy and pasted Tony Stark’s personality across the cast with only a few personality tweaks."
OutOfTheLoop,fdhr7de,t1_fdh6iv2,1578428581.0,">Those things do a bit of harm too. But jokes don’t. 

Jokes and comedy are a part of media and media helps people form opinions about subjects, good or bad, which can lead to real world actions, good or bad. It’s hypocritical to believe that comedy is something that can positively impact the world- such as by giving awards and honors to Dave Chappelle, Carol Burnett, Mel Brook, etc for their work or using quotes from Carlin, Burr or Gervais to argue a point -while at the same time denying that certain jokes could ever have a negative impact.

It’s decades of media, including comedy, treating all men as basically sex addicts who aren’t capable of being sexually assaulted that have resulted in slower reforms in regards to sexual abuse towards men.

It’s decades of media, including comedy, that have perpetuated harmful Asian stereotypes that have resulted in Asian men(at least in the US) being seen as a race of emotionless, emasculated math robots and Asian women as either tiger moms or submissive sex robots.

What annoys me about Gervais is that he’s more than willing to accept praise for his work but when criticized he slinks back into this stupid “it’s just a joke, it has no affect on the world ” mentality.

Besides, he’s more being criticized for making shitty, unoriginal trans jokes than he is for making trans jokes."
RedLetterMedia,fdfrqf7,t1_fdfkqzm,1578368584.0,"Personally, I think the whole Jedi mythos became way too complicated after the OT. I realize that people apparently like endless novels, comic books and video games explaining every single facet of the Star Wars universe but in my opinion it really watered down the mystery of the Jedi seen in the OT.

Were they noble space monks who were few in number and traveled the galaxy helping those in need? Or maybe a long line of students and teachers that passed generational knowledge and wisdom down to each other? What was the relationship between the Jedi and Sith? What were the Clone Wars and why were the Jedi involved?

Sometimes I think its just better to leave some things to the imagination."

changemyview,fdcip59,t3_ekk2n7,1578275878.0,">I read somewhere that Asians get -50 points on average subtracted in SAT scores when applying to college. Whites get 0 points off. Hispanics get +130 points. Blacks get +200. 

That comes from a study by Thomas Epsenshade and you seem to be completely misunderstanding the results, as most have. It's only a review of private colleges, not public, and different races don't literally have points added or subtracted to their SAT score. It just means that the average Asian student has an SAT score of X, a white student has an average SAT score of Y, etc. Even Epsenshade himself doesn't believe that his study shows proof of anti-asian bias in recruiting because he didn't study the ""soft"" aspects of recruiting such as counselor recommendations, essays, extracurricular activities, etc.

College admissions are a holistic process and they look at many different variables when admitting a student. If you have 1000 applicants with great SAT scores who all seemingly have roughly the same profike and 1000 applicants who may not have as high SAT scores (but still exceed the minimum required) but come from a variety of backgrounds, the second group will most likely be more favored.The

The college I went to looks more sympathetically towards students from a particular region that is WAY poorer than the rest of the state. If you isolated the SAT scores from that region and compared them to the rest then they'd be lower. They also look kindly towards first generation college students among the whole state, but that particular region has way more first generation college students so that drives the average SAT even lower. And towards students who have suffered hardships, again, because of the economy and a ton of other factors more students from that region have had more hardships, which keeps driving the average score lower."

>It’s been pointed out before but they weren’t trained to be astronauts. They were “trained” to sit in a space ship and control their equipment in little to no gravity. They had astronauts to fly the space ships.

>they tried to train astronauts to be drillers but they kept breaking the equipment (it was also a patented made drill that no one besides his team had ever used before). That’s why they brought in Bruce Willis to help. And he would only help if he was allowed to bring in his own crew.

>It should be noted too that they weren’t some random roughnecks they were one of the most sought after deep sea drilling teams in the world. There is a scene where they have to explain to the astronauts why landing on a different part of the asteroid effects the drilling due to the composition of the rock, because the astronauts aren’t trained geologists

I feel like you’re  sort of falling into the same trap as the OP you’re responding to.

You need to keep in mind that Home Alone wasn’t always a Christmas classic. Many critics at the time, like Roger Ebert, simply didn’t think it was very good for various reasons. There are also many reviews on there that came out *years* after the movie was released, making the score even more distorted.

Honestly I don’t think RT scores are useful for older movies (like Home Alone). It doesn’t give an accurate reflection of how the movie was received at the time."

The Shape of Water made more money than As Astra and has better critic and audience reviews. This sub is in no way reflective of how general audiences or critics feel about movies.
