AmItheAsshole,ff1wnn0,t1_feykkai,1579487873.0,"Well, to be fair it *is* how it works, it’s just that the calories-out part shrinks and the calories-in part amplifies for reasons that are largely beyond your control, or under only tenuous control. (disability preventing exercise, metabolic rate decreasing, wild swings in hunger hormones & cravings that are almost impossible to resist). I do get the unstated point people are hinting at, that the act of eating is *in theory* under voluntary control, but the glucocorticoids can cause such tremendous swings in the hunger hormones & satiety hormones that getting control of calories-in really becomes an overwhelming additional barrier. W/o cort, cravings come under control pretty fast and your body readjusts to less food pretty soon. I’ve dieted when not on cort and sure the first 3 days are tricky but then you get a new routine going & it all gets much easier. But when on cort it’s a whole different ball game, like a mad howling wolf inside every second till I can’t think. 

I don’t think anybody who hasn’t experienced radical changes in the hunger hormones is qualified to say anything about it. So yeah it’s always calories in calories out, the laws of physics still hold, but no that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gonna be feasible to bring either side of that equation under voluntary control."

I believe 2 of the other leads are from the Royal Ballet & there’s also a famous tap dance guy in the crazy tap scene. There were enough pros involved that the Royal Ballet sent an accompanist & trainer to set so they could all do full dance rehearsals every morning, in order to be ready to return to dance performance as soon as shooting ended."
iamverysmart,fegxxb0,t1_fef2x93,1579104993.0,"Oh, they absolutely learn their trade too. The good grades demonstrate both - they learned their trade *and also* are a steady worker. Ultimately if I am hiring I need both - I need to hire someone who knows the trade *but also* it has to be the sort of person who will actually get the work done.

I’m in human health care & endangered-species science btw, doing labwork w hazardous chemicals, so this may be field-specific. There are a lot of safety issues. In hiring, we have to be sure that whoever we hire won’t accidentally injure or kill their patients - or themselves! A lot of the safety issues can be ameliorated w training & protocols, but there’s also a component of, just being sure you are hiring careful people who habitually pay attention to details. If I’m taking someone out with me in wilderness on the tundra with bears around, it’s *got* to be someone reliable who will listen to me. If we’re working in a vet clinic & they’re holding a sick, critically endangered, species of sea turtle, they’ve *got* to hold it like I tell them to and not drop the poor turtle. If we have ethyl ether in the lab I don’t want them to blow themselves up! In the end we have to be 100% certain that the person we hire will not accidentally kill the animals, poison themselves or burn the lab down, even when totally unsupervised when the rest of us are out on fieldwork. Of course they need to know their trade, of course I want someone bright, but *in addition* I screen for what a colleague calls “the detail-oriented mind” - some who stays on top of all the little stuff in addition to the big stuff."
iamverysmart,fedcj46,t1_fed6fvc,1579007597.0,"Prof here. I don’t really care if a student is smart. I only care if they have learned the class material. Grades don’t track with intelligence but they do track with hard work, diligence, consistency, time management, ability to maintain focus for long stretches of time, willingness to do some tedious work (studying) and forego short term pleasures (partying, etc) in order to gain a long-term goal (career path of choice), general willingness to be cooperative & play more or less by the rules, ability to turn up on time consistently, and a general habit of paying attention to details (details of the class syllabus, details of how an exam question was worded, etc). Thing is, those traits do matter in life (somewhat at least). They’re definitely not the only things that matter but they do matter, especially in the career path my students are headed to (largelt health careers). I hire my own employees partly based on grades because those are a lot of the traits I want in my employees."

Cool it there a bit. Maybe you’ve been in drunken brawls & been arrested for assault, but I haven’t & most people I know haven’t. JP crossed a line and though I’m not saying he’s a supervillain or anything, it’s not a good idea to try to normalize that kind of behavior.

We don’t know that. He hasn’t said anything about it. Could’ve just been drunk. I like the guy (quite a bit actually) but I’m cautious about trying to explain away this incident."

personalfinance,fc4w4ir,t1_fc4rew1,1577430855.0,"Former landlord here, you are incorrect. In my state tenant’s rights laws swing into full effect as soon as a person has been living at a given address for just 2 weeks, even with no lease and no rent. Most states are like this. (This is exactly why squatters are such a problem & are so hard to get rid of.) 

This is particularly likely to be true in northern states, where minor rent disagreements could escalate to actual death if somebody gets unjustly kicked out in midwinter. (Picture someone kicked out at ten below zero or in a blizzard. Immediate life or death situation) States with hard winters do not let landlords, or parents, fuck around with tenant’s rights laws."
personalfinance,fc4vpk2,t1_fc4o82c,1577430344.0,"Yes. No adult can be immediately thrown out of their residence (even if they haven’t been paying any rent, even if there was no lease). Almost all states have tenant’s rights laws requiring formal eviction proceedings, and in most states this process takes several months. (In northern states the process is often intentionally slow so that people won’t literally freeze to death if evicted in winter.) I used to be a landlord - you can never just toss someone out. The eviction process took 3 mos in my state. If you try to force someone out faster than that, they can sue you for all moving costs, hotel costs, etc., (and in my state they will virtually always win). In most states, if an adult has been living at a given address for 2 weeks or longer, they are legally considered a tenant even if there was no lease and no rent.

So:
If the child is under 18 the parent can’t kick them out at all.

If the child is 18 or over, tenant’s rights apply & the parent must go through formal eviction proceedings."

(they do then usually remember to check that it’s not just hair dye, but I’ve had some dentists who forgot to ask about that!) Also we’re much more prone to skin cancer and need more frequent dermatologist visits. Some other stuff, there’s subtle differences in psychology because the genetic difference affects a neurotransmitter system. It’s not just the hair, there’s some systemic physiological differences."
