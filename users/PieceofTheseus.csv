nottheonion,ff5jpko,t1_ff5iarv,1579596098.0,"The US has decent public transportation, it just no one uses them as much:  They are called Buses.  You'd be surprised at where you can go with a bus in the US.  

However cars are freedom.  I didn't realize how much more more economic freedom you have in a car until I lived without one.  With a car I could branch out to more stores and restaurants.  I wasn't as limited on how much I could buy and have to carry back."
japan,ff5i9n6,t1_ff309d2,1579594112.0,"Your talking about native speakers of the language, however English is still the top when talking about total useful level, and more importantly the language of trade/commerce.  More business deals are done in English by a landslide.  For years Japanese companies were passed over for other Asian markets because of the language barrier.  Since Rakuten went English in 2010, a number of companies are now jumping on that bandwagon:  Honda, Shiseido, IDEC, and even Softbank is requiring some departments to be dual language."
japan,ff5hs5g,t1_fezj2u3,1579593469.0,"I know I will be a heretic for saying this, but it is time to dump Katakana entirely from the language.  It is the digital era, use the foreign language version for foreign words and hiragana for Japanese common words that are in Katakana.  I think it will help the Japanese learn foreign words faster."
japan,ff5h6zd,t3_er43ac,1579592708.0,"You can do one of the following:

Since 1st June 2017, Japanese nationals can once again purchase and use the Japan Rail Pass.

Be aware, however, that the conditions are very restrictive.
You must obtain and fill in one of the following documents:
1 - An ""Overseas Residential Registration"" from the Japanese Embassy of your place of residence
2 - A ""Certificate of Overseas Residence"" from the Japanese Embassy of your place of residence
3 â€“ For the United States, Brazil and Canada, a permanent residency card.

I'm sure you'd be able to get one of those documents if your considered out of country citizen.


The length of residence must be at least 10 years on the day you purchase the JR Pass.
Please note that you must have those documents on you BEFORE buying your Japan Rail Pass."

todayilearned,fdm5you,t1_fdm11fw,1578540609.0,"I lived in Japan for a while, I loved trains... However I did the research and there are several academic papers especially out of Australia that trains are just not economical solutions.   Only in densely populated areas in peak traffic hours do trains make more sense.   For the average city buses have a considerable economic advantage for public transportation.  

High speed regional rail is still disadvantaged by buses under 300km and airplanes over 300km, and the more past 300km airplanes become exponentially cheaper."

todayilearned,fdj0ekq,t1_fdirwul,1578455267.0,"It doesn't have to be receipts, any sort of documentation or evidence of the ownership line from the artist to modern day... of course the older the painting, the less reliable the Provenance is going to be.

It not the rich people, trust me they are willing to pay for whatever they like. Instead it is the Auction Houses(mostly) and Dealers that sell these works.  They will list the price according to the catalogue, which is a list of works by each artist.  

The more stupid part is that each catalogue is made by art experts, and it solely their opinion on what is considered a work by each artist, especially if it doesn't have the documentation to prove Provenance.  Scientifically it can have all the hallmarks of the artist, but without the proper provenance, the opinion of catalogue creator is the end all say all, and if they don't think it is a strong work, they will leave it out of the catalogue."
todayilearned,fdhv17c,t1_fdgycrk,1578430645.0,"In paintings and other master art.. it is more about ""Provenance"" then the actually artwork itself.  
""Provenance"" is basically the line of owners/paperwork of the artwork back to the artist.  This painting had the provenance, so few questions were asked.

The UK show Fake or Fortune is quite a good example of this in action.  There is a number of instances where they came very close to having experts identify a painting from an artists, but without the provenance, the artwork is basically worthless."

I agree with you... There are ton of styles of Japanese animation.  How come it is grouped all together as Anime? Which proves my original point... Anime is not a style."

roosterteeth,fctfe8c,t1_fct3wsf,1577941509.0,Technically anime is not a style.  The style would be Disney-like or modern Japanese.   Anime just means animation in Japanese.

AskReddit,fbwpt71,t1_fbvsk92,1577156220.0,"I started learning how to cook Japanese meals when I lived in Japan.  Especially with rice cookers, it is super simple. Throw the rice in the pot, rinse with water, swish, and drain, repeat two more times, the water should be close to clear the third time.  Add the same amount of water as rice added. Hit the button and let cook.  

Japanese stores sell so many products that you just heat up and throw in with or along side the rice.  I wish they sold single serving individual packet Japanese Curry or Hokkaido cream stew in the US."
