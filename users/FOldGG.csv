**People can continue to say that Venezuela‚Äôs tragic plight is unrelated to its socialist policies. Yet it cannot be denied that Venezuela suffered one of the sharpest economic declines in history immediately after it began one of the largest nationalization campaigns ever, one that went far beyond its state-run oil operations.**

**Hugo Ch√°vez set his people on a path to serfdom from which there was no turning back.**

**By nationalizing everything from steel and shipping to agriculture, mining, banking, electricity, telecommunications, and more, Hugo Ch√°vez set his people on a path to serfdom from which there was no turning back.**

**People must not relish the tragedy of Venezuela, but we must learn from it. If we refuse, it‚Äôs a fate I fear we‚Äôll soon see repeated.**

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-collapse-exposes-the-fake-socialism-debated-in-u-s-11549465200](https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-collapse-exposes-the-fake-socialism-debated-in-u-s-11549465200)

Though Mr. Ch√°vez denied he was a socialist when first elected president in 1998, he soon radicalized, says Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan government official and now an economist at Harvard University who supports regime change. Soaring oil revenue in the 2000s enabled Mr. Ch√°vez to embark on a sweeping nationalization of the economy. The government ‚Äúexpropriated six million hectares of land, the steel sector, cement sector, supermarkets, telecoms, banks, dairy factories, coffee processing factories, hotels, and essentially ran all of them into the ground,‚Äù says Mr. Hausmann. It imposed controls on prices, imports and foreign exchange, which in effect expropriated the cash flow of private companies.

When oil revenue fell because of mismanagement and falling prices, the government forced the central bank to print money to finance its spending, resulting in hyperinflation and the current economic collapse.

If there was one or more loans from the corporate entity to the ESOP, then shares will be released in equivalent value to the loan payoff; those shares will be valued, momentarily, at the price at the time of the loan.

For example, to make this simple, if a person makes base and bonus of $100k and the company contributes 15%, $15,000 goes into the ESOP retirement account.  If shares on 12/31/18 were valued at $3,000 per share, the employee received 5 shares.  Assume the employee had 33.3 shares accumulated and they were all vested by the Federally mandated maximum of 6 years, on 12/31/18 the account value was very close to $100,000.  Since 40% was paid out $60,000 of value remains in the form of 20 shares.

If the company was sold at $4,000/share the value is $80,000.

All proceeds are subject to income tax as the company deposited them in with zero taxation.

Also, point of interest, I think. In a 100% ESOP Company all owners are in the business and zero ownership exists outside.  All shares hold the same status.

Strike price doesn‚Äôt matter.  It is a contribution by the company into a retirement account.

The company does not pay tax on profit. The owners/employees pay regular taxes on total value.  The employee contributes zero dollars into the ESOP account.

I read a lot of language that said ""inclusive"" and ""diversity"" and ""marginalized persons"" and literally nothing about increased living spaces...

Permitting is streamlined, from what to what?  Why no questions as to the obvious?"
madisonwi,fchjq1p,t1_fch4fdl,1577651131.0,":)  Likely so...only politicians, most of whom don't pay any attention to economics, will mandate and regulate what is unsustainable.  

Investors will be happy to go to Middleton, Monona and the rest where they can make more."

How many coffee shops can go up with all of the existing ones surviving as well?"
climateskeptics,fcgwc1v,t1_fcgud4n,1577644628.0,"No, no I am not.  This is an example of how it all works together and it is the voter's fault: Financiers bankroll the campaigns of politicians; then the politicians give great gifts in the form of crony capitalist deals and work that has no competition (union-mandated construction, Solyndra, Tesla, etc.).

The topic was Communism; name successful banks in Venezuela and Cuba...  Name large and profitable wealth financiers Russia...   You can't and you won't.  The Green New Deal is about government control of the means of production according to either slips in communication by, say, the UN or the campaign manager for AOC."
madisonwi,fcgugbd,t1_fcg86ir,1577644086.0,"Owners will allow somebody to modify the space to suit their specific needs; the spaces that are vacant are in the most modifiable, i.e. cheapest cost to modify now.  The 2nd renter would have to pay more making the space less attractive.

Further, why a tax break, or should I say additional tax breaks?  Maybe the answer is not regulate demanding retail..."

California_Politics,fcgpjp7,t1_fb8zzw1,1577642734.0,"Pensions are a retirement scam.  Underfunded and avoiding dealing with it.  Deal with that!  401(k)s are not designed to be short term investments.  Just try pointing out a 10 year period where 401(k)s don't do better than pensions...you can't and won't.

Please provide data indicating LA has cleaner air than West Virginia and North Dakota...you can't and you won't.  By the way, fantastic job of continuing the nose look down, especially considering you do so from a position of demonstrated failures.  Careful not to step in the crap in the streets as you do so.

Flint, also a Democratic run city and state, which helps to explain the truly devastating affect and incredibly slow response.  

Affordable housing, homelessness and poverty in the world's 5th largest economy and one of the highest taxed states in the country.  Astounding and worsening failure.  Repeal is perhaps in order, I don't know honestly.  I don't think you or anybody can count on an improvement until people are open and honest about just how bad the electorate is at holding themselves and the people they elect responsible.

Any education web site has California in the bottom 5% with regards to 4th, 8th and 12th grade test performance.  Agree on the Universities.

""Surprised you would say California is bottom of the country, when most other states are objectively worse. Borderline third world countries in the South or Appalachia for example.""  Cracks me up. You prove my point.  Looking down your nose with rampant poverty, homelessness, feces and syringes in the street, a lack of affordable housing and horrible public education.  California can't keep the power on; is moving to increasing electrification, what could possibly go wrong?"

California_Politics,fc4ofjy,t1_fc4geoq,1577422810.0,Great comments.  Rent control will deter building. Investors will demand greater returns and protections to invest and the long gestation period for permits combined with rent control will mean investors will choose other alternatives for investment.
conservatives,fc400hj,t1_fc3nn7u,1577403044.0,"True enough, but still hasn't stopped Californians from looking down their morally superior noses to lecture everyone who isn't worst in homelessness and poverty in the country, with feces and syringes in the streets, unfunded pensions, a lack of affordable housing and open borders and free stuff for those not citizens.  Top that off with a higher tax rate than what, 45 other states...and in the 5th largest economy in the world all of this exists.  

Not likely to improve in the near term with schools performing at Mississippi and Alabama levels."

Californians are never wrong.  Californians would not follow any national lead.  

The article fails to deal with the realities of California ."
