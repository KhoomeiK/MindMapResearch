Whatcouldgowrong,fe6125o,t3_enr6sr,1578879402.0,I've seen this several times. I am more amazed at how solid the first ramp looks. Doesn't seem to be much wiggle or bowing. The angle is even probably okay. He goes way to fast for the small gap and I have to assume the landing ramp would have crushed under the weight of you know a fat ass soft tail cruiser or wtf ever that definitely not made to jump over shit motorcycle is.

ShouldIbuythisgame,fdiszum,t3_elidk3,1578450369.0,"Honestly are you stressing about the constant upkeep of something like destiny or Apex in a ranked official setting? That I totally get. It's why I always turn back to sp story driven games. 

Sekiro is a wonderful game. It's honestly as rewarding as what people say. But it is as challenging as well. Being a vetted souls player kills me so much in that game. But if you're honestly looking to begin the from software journey. I fully recommend it. But give it time. Learn it's mechanics. You may ace a fight one time then get wrecked by some basic ass enemies another time keep this in mind. Keep going. Keep learning and read the enemies attacks. You'll ""git gud"" by doing this. If all else fails check out an online guide and see the you've been using the wrong prosthetic for a particular boss fight this helps to. 

If sekiro looks to intimidating. Bloodborne or any of the dark souls games are also awesome places to start as well. These are my most played games year over year because I can also do another playthrough and not get tired of it."

And a dollar on top that so like $6 per level cost to you (ish) I have no idea of the type of grind this is but in like 8 hours I'd expect to be able to pull at least 3 levels out.

ShouldIbuythisgame,fcngk1z,t3_ei1f23,1577811260.0,"I can fully recommend anything from soft makes to pretty much any person. Sekiro being your first entry in the whole thing. Maybe not the best idea. But it's still not a bad idea. These are my favorite games ever. After years and years of picking them apart. I can most definitely tell you if you play the games. Learn the systems. Adapt to the enemies. They become less difficult. Sekiro is kicking the shit out of me. But not as much as it was 10 hours ago, and not as much as ten hours before that. If this stuff interests you. Play it, it's worth the time and satisfying to learn. Don't be ashamed to turn to internet for help. Engaging with the community is also a great part of the game. I just had to look up how to beat a particular enemy in sekiro because she was handing me my ass repeatedly and I just couldn't get the leg up on her. 

My recommendation would have to be bloodborne honestly. It's right on par with the other titles. But slightly more forgiving due to the health return mechanic. It's still challenging. So if you just plain old don't like something that is willing to check your skill here and there. Then any of the games would be a pass. But if you're truly interested, don't let people saying it's hard or too hard or bad because it's hard intimidate your decision. Jump in. Learn. Overcome. You can do it"
