He also thought it was the only thing stopping him from having the looks and female attention he had in college 10 years and a good 50 lbs prior. Back then he was a bit above average looking so a decade later he was staving off the Wall by constantly referring to himself as handsome and constantly verbalizing that random other men aren’t handsome or aren’t as tall as him.

YouShouldKnow,fdqj4mk,t1_fdpb8ua,1578667936.0,"Yes, they get around fair pay by using subcontractors as well as by other methods including legalized wage theft and restricting hours to part-time.

I work for a subcontractor and I believe many of the last-mile delivery is done by subcontractors. 

In certain areas anyone with a car can sign up to do freelance deliveries for commissions. Amazon also [encourages](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pros-and-cons-of-amazon-delivery-business-offer/) individuals to become small business owners by recruiting a “fleet” of workers who have to comply with Amazon regulations and quotas, while Amazon is not responsible for providing insurance, materials or benefits. 

Drivers rushing to meet quotas have gotten into accidents and ran people over and Amazon denied [responsibility](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-not-legally-responsible-for-delivery-related-deaths-contract-drivers-2019-9). I’ve also seen YouTube videos shadowing drivers who say their work would be easier with a uniform or safety vest so customers aren’t suspicious of a stranger coming onto their property, but Amazon won’t spring for that. 

My own job is in rush grocery delivery. Amazon contracts logistics companies to deliver Whole Foods. Arguably buying Whole Foods was a move to compete with options like Fresh Direct or Peapod in a growing industry. It’s a tipped industry which means that we receive a subminimum wage and our employer can use part of our tips to pay our minimum wage. My employer justifies this because they are constantly jockeying with competitors to keep the contracts. People who drive directly for Amazon have also shown the [media](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-amazon-drivers-tips-20190207-story.html) proof of wage theft. The delivery app does not show tip payouts, discourages us from face-to-face interaction with a customer, and we are forbidden per Amazon policy to take cash tips. 

By the way, for those who don’t think we deserve tips - Many of us are hauling multiple customers’ orders by foot or bicycle (cheaper for subcontractors) and customers often don’t consider how accessible their home is to someone carrying a heavy or numerous load. People will order 12 gallons of water to an apartment with no elevator or a house that has a decorative flight of steps to the door. PrimeNow is a premium service and even if Amazon incentivizes using it, there is ALWAYS an environmental or human cost to getting whatever you want, whenever you want.

I also know people who are employed directly by Amazon and while there is a $15/hour rate and benefits options, hours are kept under 25 a week. Don’t forget that they recently [slashed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/whole-foods-to-cut-healthcare-for-1900-part-time-employees-in-2020.html) benefits for part-time Whole Foods workers. Whole Foods used to have profit sharing among other [progressive](https://fortune.com/2011/05/18/5-reasons-why-its-great-to-work-at-whole-foods/) benefits. After takeover, Amazon’s prerogative was to [discourage](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201) unionizing.

TLDR: Yes, they get around fair pay by using subcontractors as well as by other methods including legalized wage theft and restricting hours to part-time."

But philosophy gatekeeps better by using words instead of visuals. You can have a carefully constructed outfit that winks here and nods there but you’re still putting your message out in the world where random people can have a visceral reaction to your presentation.

I brought up celebrities because their actions are documented examples of engagement with others’ misery with varying degrees of ethicality (Also, their virtue signaling speaks on cultural values and the mechanics of media, including social media). 

On an individual level, we can impact others for the better, or without critical self-reflection we can fall into enacting and perpetuating exploitative relations based on our position in society.

When I first saw this image I didn’t know its context. After looking into it, I would agree that this individual is doing good in the world. That said, don’t you think it’s disingenuous or naive not to think about why this story has gotten attention? 

When’s the last time you saw a picture of someone feeding a child in the media, and do you think the historically sensationalized and propagandized thematic tropes this picture represents has anything to do with why these particular images made a splash?

What are the precedents to Europeans going elsewhere to update people into ‘civilized’ living conditions, and what structural inequalities ensure that aid continues to flow in one direction? Why do we take for granted that mobility of humans and resources aren’t evenly distributed? Are we celebrating Nigerian children being able to access basic human needs, or are we celebrating a fairytale of Europeans bringing enlightenment and morality to ‘darkest Africa’?

Do Nigerians need Europeans to tell them that persecuting children is bad? It sounds absurd but don’t many people think this way? Is it just as newsworthy when Nigerians do charity work to benefit other Nigerians?

Do you think that an African tourist in Europe who decided to stay permanently to address social ills would have gotten as much positive attention? How about white aid workers who stay in their own country to help the needy, or black people taking care of other black people in wealthy countries that have issues of inequality without the patina of “exoticism” ascribed to many countries in the Global South? Do you think the prevalence of trans-racial adoption and how it only flows in one way is natural? Does it ever involve fetishism?"
