AskReddit,fdhim5y,t1_fdgno0l,1578423427.0,I decided eventually on the left side of the bed as I tend to hang over the side and felt most comfortable when I slept on my stomach facing that way.
relationship_advice,fdgksd3,t3_elawtm,1578400648.0,We have a king sized bed big enough for 3 adults for just the two of us (and occasionally our cats). We both sleep weird and toss and turn so a big bed works for us. Anything smaller and we would sleep separately. I also work nights and him days - if it ever became a problem I’d have no bad feelings about sleeping in our own individual beds to get a good night sleep.
cats,fdgklzs,t3_elax9t,1578400467.0,"A couple things:
1. Look into a cat behaviourist, your local vet should be able to recommend one. They can see more than you can in the nuances of what’s going on with your little man.
2. Feliway. It comes as a spray or a plug in and is a cat pheromone. Humans can’t smell it and it helps to relax the cats stress and anxiety. 
3. He could be doing it just bc he’s a cat and they’re weird. Have you tried keeping him out of your bedroom and simply ignoring him? I know it isn’t easy but it could simply be a bad habit he’s developed and you’ve given into. Especially if the other cats are allowed in and not him.
4. If He clearly doesn’t feel safe so perhaps closing him in a smaller place in the evening such as another bedroom or bathroom might help him feel calmer. 
Good luck and I hope your little guy feels better soon!"
cats,fdgjzpm,t3_ela8y7,1578399837.0,"Spaying with help with some of the behavioural problems and is necessary for her health as well. Some vets will do a payment plan. Also try making her into a purrito, which is basically rolling her up in a blanket like a burrito and calmly talking to her and petting her. It helps ferals to associate humans as good and loving. Look up kitten lady on IG and YouTube and she has a ton of advice!"

AskReddit,fdgj3yf,t3_elabme,1578398898.0,"After the death of my mom and my marriage ending at age 27 I asked my dad while sobbing if ever I would find love again. His response was, and I quote, “ I don’t know, you’re pretty hard to love so you may never find someone else.”
Cut to 7 years later with my amazing bf and my dad says “I gotta be honest, I didn’t think you’d ever find someone who loves you”.
Awe.some."

AskReddit,fdgi7zg,t3_elad0i,1578397884.0,I switched back and forth for a few months with my bf until I decided which side I wanted. He can sleep anywhere so it didn’t matter to him.
cats,fdgi5ve,t3_elad0u,1578397815.0,"She could be doing it out of stress, like she’s marking her territory if you have other animals.
Another problem could be crystals so she wants to urinate on something that feels soft. I would absolutely take her to the vet to get her checked out. Better that it’s nothing than wait until it’s really costly and bad.
If it turns out it’s simply behavioural you could always look into getting a cat pheromones called Feliway. It’s a plug in or spray and humans can’t smell it. It helps the cat to relax and feel safe. Or try tin foil or tape on the bed to dissuade her. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,fdghpbr,t3_eladwt,1578397264.0,"Take caution. I always fell for this type of behaviour “oh he’s into me and I don’t want to change his mind” or  “maybe I’m just being too cautious”. Nope. Every. Single. Time. As soon as he got my goodies he bounced. Usually turned out to be not that interested in me or what I had to say and was aggressive. Tell me you want to take it slow and see how he reacts. Chances are he’ll show his true colours and if they are along the lines of pressuring you, making you feel like shit or belittling you MOVE ON. Be safe out there!"
