Thanks for the advice, and hope you have fun on your journey."
lotterywins,fe7dkbp,t1_fe7c282,1578913111.0,"I should have worded that to say ‚Äúa person with a lot of money‚Äù but it‚Äôs 5 am, sorry. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre perfectly normal lol!

So what are you going to do first? And are you going to invest in anything in order to keep that money going for future generations?

Thanks :)"
lotterywins,fe7b0p2,t3_eo0fic,1578912303.0,"That‚Äôs awesome, congratulations!

I want to do the same thing so bad. Like yes, being a normal person isn‚Äôt terrible but there‚Äôs so many things I want to do and learn and see! And fix my family‚Äôs debt issue and give some people who‚Äôve had bad luck some financial help and so many other things. 

Did you buy the tickets auto selected or did you choose your numbers?"

Went to get in the shower and fell in, took the rod with me and then it was me, my fat body, the curtain and shower rod all flopping around like coconut oil soup. I was pissed."

facepalm,fdp9ehe,t1_fdnvawr,1578623079.0,"So um.. I knew someone who did this. Except he did have insurance. But he drives a beater car around purposefully in case he ran into some high-horse douche driver. He‚Äôll ding the fuck out of their car if they drive like an asshole.

He has a separate car for when he doesn‚Äôt feel like dinging the shit out of people‚Äôs cars..."
aww,fdfaxfg,t1_fdf1m3f,1578357407.0,I also came here to say this üòÇ
AmItheAsshole,fdcpfwn,t1_fdao2wn,1578280729.0,"I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre from but if this works similarly - visit your county‚Äôs courthouse and speak with the administrator there. They (other than but not excluding lawyers) usually know best about what forms you can fill out yourself. Even for something like that, there may be a fee for record purposes."
askwomenadvice,fd2rdk2,t3_ejrzgy,1578150871.0,"Hi, I didn‚Äôt go through everything to see if someone already suggested this. But this razor and detail trimmer is a super sweet deal and the razor lasted me like 15-20 shaves without dulling! It‚Äôs water proof too. 

As to the act of shaving, I start by getting a good soap down there and then what I do (because I have a huge ass) is I squat down all the way and then shave back there, but reaching from my front. So shaving from back to front. I‚Äôve found that the easiest for myself because I was always afraid of getting a razor cut between the cheeks, and if I try reaching around, my ass tries to eat my razor.ü•¥

I hope you find a good solution!

raisedbynarcissists,fcx7218,t3_ej9b56,1578053871.0,Good for you. Don‚Äôt let her isolate you so that you have no one left but her. Haters can‚Äôt win if you‚Äôre not playing their game.
LifeProTips,fbx71y9,t1_fbwwe9o,1577172204.0,"My mom did this. I attended raging high school parties with alcohol present at 15, and the next morning when I called at 8 am (on her weekend off work), she would grumpily drag herself out of bed to come get me. She never complained though, not once. That is at least one thing I‚Äôll give her so much credit for.

Edit: just want to say that I grew out of this quickly after realizing my mistakes, which is a part of growing up. No need to bring up abortions and be rude."
