Muhlenberg legend

The **Muhlenberg legend** is an urban legend in the United States and Germany. According to the legend, the single vote of Frederick Muhlenberg, the first ever Speaker of the US House of Representatives, prevented German from becoming an official language of the United States. The story has a long history and has been told in several variations, which may be based in part on actual events.

The United States, however, has no statutory official language; English has been used on a *de facto* basis because of its status as the country's predominant language. At times, various states have passed their own official language laws.

todayilearned,felt0af,t1_felssqp,1579230195.0,"The nature of the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been described variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or – most popularly – a stony meteorite. Paul Partsch \[de\], the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.

A significant clue to its nature is provided by an account of the Stone's recovery in 951 CE after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.

Elsebeth Thomsen of the University of Copenhagen proposed a different hypothesis in 1980. She suggested that the Black Stone may be a glass fragment or impactite from the impact of a fragmented meteorite that fell 6,000 years ago at Wabar, a site in the Rub' al Khali desert 1,100 km east of Mecca. A 2004 scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred within the last 200–300 years.

The meteoritic hypothesis is viewed by geologists as doubtful. The British Natural History Museum suggests that it may be a pseudometeorite, in other words a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.

The Black Stone has never been analysed with modern scientific techniques and its origins remain the subject of speculation.

They became upset when Ali agreed to negotiate with Mu awiyah instead of go to war with him. They were even further angered when Ali and Mu awiyah agreed to bring in a third party to help with the negotiations because they could end up selecting a new caliphate. They strongly believed that only God could decide the fate of the battle. 

Over time they spread out and formed different groups. The most extreme group was called the Azariqah and they came from Basra. Another well known group are called the Ibadiyah, and they reside in Oman, North Africa, and Zanzibar and are the only sect to survive to this day.

SoftBank-backed robotic pizza startup Zume plans to lay off up to 400 employees and won't renew its Seattle lease amid widespread restructuring to stop burning cash

Zume, the startup famous for its pizza-making robot, plans to lay off about 400 employees on January 13, Business Insider has learned.

Several divisions will be affected, according to sources close to the company, but the highest concentration of layoffs will be in the engineering, operations, and corporate-development parts of the business. According to current and former Zume employees, those were the divisions that were rapidly scaled, somewhat haphazardly, as the company pitched growth goals and business objectives that were unrealistic. One source said the startup's Seattle office, which consists mainly of engineering teams, has chosen to not renew its lease amid the cuts.

""They hired so many people,"" one former Zume employee told Business Insider. 

* Zume, the startup famous for its pizza-making robots, plans to lay off about 400 employees across several offices in the US on January 13, Business Insider has learned.
* The lease for its Seattle office, which consists mostly of engineering employees, will not be renewed amid the cuts, one source told Business Insider. Corporate-development and operations staff will also be widely affected, sources said.
* The layoffs come as the Mountain View, California, startup has struggled to secure additional funding from SoftBank. Zume cofounder and CEO Alex Garden has become so cautious that he has restricted all communication from his senior staff to outside investors.
* Garden tightened his already vicelike grip on the startup as its troubles continued to mount in the past few months, including canceling a companywide meeting in December, overseeing departures of executive staff, and effectively shuttering Zume Pizza, the pizza-making-robot division on which the startup was initially founded.
