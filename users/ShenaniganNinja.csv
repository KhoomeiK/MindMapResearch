After all, it's fog, so everyone in concealed.  So everyone needs to make perception checks just to know where the enemy is. Keen senses would give them advantage on the perception check, since they could argue they're not using their eyes so blindness doesn't factor. But for attack rolls they still have disadvantage since smelling or hearing where an enemy is doesn't tell you enough to be able to attack them properly. Think of it like fencing in the dark. You could hear their footsteps, but that wouldn't tell you where their sword is."
