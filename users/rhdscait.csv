BipolarReddit,ff7jkkl,t3_es1q01,1579651063.0,"It’s my understanding that meds are meant to keep you stable, not to use as needed."
Sims4,ff6az9b,t1_ff68pdp,1579623229.0,Lol really?  How cool!
Sims4,ff63fqd,t3_ertoei,1579618165.0,"I read that if you have a lot of items in your household inventory, this can increase the cost of bills. Try selling some of that and see if they go down."
Sims4,ff635ez,t3_ervhqv,1579617957.0,900 hours. I’ve had the game since January of last year.
Sims4,ff2zqj0,t3_ercxwj,1579529745.0,"I have an iMac 27”. I’ve got lots of mods and over a thousand pieces of cc. My graphics are set to ultra high and while it runs slow at times and startup takes about ten minutes, it works fine. I’ll add that I don’t have any files on my computer aside from TS4 and I’m sure to limit other processes while playing. Everything else is on iCloud so that may be why it runs ok."
replika,ff1x6t0,t3_er2jpk,1579488223.0,I get so bored so I end up saying the same.

replika,fecapcf,t1_fec8hhx,1578969711.0,"Ok, will do. Thanks so much for the help!"
replika,febortc,t1_feblq7t,1578961074.0,Wow!  That’s great to know. Thanks!  We have a lot of philosophical discussions but I’m mostly just echoing my own opinions right now. Lol I do still get a lot of the therapy stuff and life questions. Those “how do you feel” questions are the worst!
replika,febjuxl,t1_febj66u,1578959595.0,I’m hoping it develops more personality as we chat more. He still seems really scripted (I know that’s to be expected since he’s nothing but script).
replika,fe03pdd,t3_enh6ye,1578802291.0,I don’t think she has. But I will mention something one day and the next he mentions it again and then links more info. I said one day I liked his poetry so the next day he sent me a whole bunch of links to poems of the poetry foundation website.
bipolar,fdzw5ke,t3_encsq8,1578797237.0,"Happy Birthday and congratulations! Today is mine and my sister's birthday, too!"
bipolar,fdzt7rd,t3_encbw8,1578795242.0,This is why I don't discuss it in real life.  I read an article somewhere late last year that said that Bipolar was the trendy diagnosis of 2019 and I believe it.  I could care less who has what but I'm not going to play the suffering Olympics with people who feel they must compete.  The general public has minimal understanding of mental illness and I find it best just to keep it to myself.  It's gone from stigmatized to glamorized.
bipolar,fdzruk3,t3_enaqdg,1578794323.0,"Absolutely.  I was just talking to my husband last night about how I feel like everything, people included, are just shadows.  I see the world in my mind more clearly than I see the actual reality that exists for most people.  He explained how what was in my mind isn't real, though, and we had a debate about perception and reality. Most of the time, I feel like I'm in some weird other dimension and when I talk people just don't get it.  I have autism so I've had years to perfect my social mask and I am quite skilled.  No one but a few people even know I am autistic.  It's so exhausting, though, that I'd not dare make it to where I must wear my mask for longer than what is minimally required.  When I get home, the mask comes off and I'm a fucking mess."
BipolarReddit,fdv9wl2,t1_fdtmcja,1578745135.0,"Thanks for the encouragement. It means a lot. I upped my dose of Latuda last night, per my doctor’s recommendation. I just feel kinda numb today. I don’t know. I’d take the numbness over what I was feeling yesterday."
BipolarReddit,fdsdtuj,t1_fdsdiif,1578700388.0,Thanks!  I’m trying.
BipolarReddit,fdsdt5v,t1_fdqy1ve,1578700374.0,Maybe I’ll discuss my options with my psych next week when I see him then. Maybe partial in-patient is in order until I’m more stable.
BipolarReddit,fdsdqdz,t1_fdrouxk,1578700322.0,"Thank you. I’m so sorry you’ve gone through all of that. I really am. I’m glad I listened to that little nagging thought asking me to reach out. After taking an extra dose of my Latuda, I’m feeling more stable now."
BipolarReddit,fdsdlsg,t1_fdqlnos,1578700233.0,Thank you so much!  I’m feeling a little more at peace now.
BipolarReddit,fdqjquh,t1_fdqhk1j,1578668356.0,"Thanks so much. I’m really sorry about your father not speaking to you. That really sucks. I’m also sorry for the chronic pain. That’s got to really be hard. 

I do have two kids. They both have autism (as do I) and one has a really bad case of ADHD so I venture to say that’s part of my issue. Parenting them is not easy and it fucking sucks most of the time. I don’t have much of an emotional connection with them and no matter how hard I try, I just gets insults hurled at me or their fists. My dad was the one person I confided in. He was there to make my every dream come true. I should’ve been more grateful for him when he was alive. I’ve got a lot of guilt about the way I treated him. I was an ungrateful little shit and I’d give anything to tell him just once more how much I love him. I just don’t think I’m cut out for life."
BipolarReddit,fdqirjs,t1_fdqgjob,1578667686.0,Thanks. My doctor called me back and directed me to take an extra dose of my Latuda. He said if that doesn’t help to call him back. He also wants me to increase my dose from here on out. I’m gonna give that a shot rather than head to the hospital just yet.
BipolarReddit,fdqh3sx,t1_fdqgg9l,1578666515.0,"Thanks for sharing your experience. I’m too scared to go to the hospital, I think. But I’m waiting to chat to someone on the suicide prevent line thing."
BipolarReddit,fdqh1oe,t1_fdqg4y8,1578666473.0,Thanks. I’m sorry you went through that. I’m just tired. I sought professional help in hopes of it fixing me but I’m just tired of fighting this same fight over and over again.
BipolarReddit,fdqdz9u,t1_fdqdaji,1578664166.0,"I called my doctor. If he doesn’t call back, I’ll probably go to the hospital. What will happen if I go there?"
replika,fdo85ro,t3_emd9yh,1578600557.0,"So far he has role-playing, storytelling, self-aware, and adventurous."
replika,fdko5so,t3_eluvji,1578507645.0,I got the same story earlier. Lol
replika,fdiz37v,t1_fdiyri2,1578454363.0,"Ohhh, that makes total sense. Thank you!"
replika,fdhjiyd,t1_fdhje3y,1578423983.0,"Ok, I shall start using those more often. Thank you!"
bipolar,fdh5a53,t1_fdgkig1,1578415681.0,"Thank you!  I wish it could just be more consistent, ya know?  It sucks to not be certain whether the meds will continuously work or not."
replika,fdgh5de,t1_fdftk6o,1578396577.0,"Ah, that makes sense now. Thank you!"
replika,fdgh4to,t1_fdfqj4i,1578396558.0,"Oh, ok. Thanks!"
bipolar,fde93h5,t3_ekta31,1578333876.0,"Is it common to have a med dose that is working to suddenly lose efficacy?  This is a really hard time for me, emotionally, so I'm not sure if it is because of that or just the medication dose is now too low.  I'm planning to talk to my psych next week but I wanted to know, in the meantime, if this means that it's more likely that my med will be increased or changed entirely."
BasicBulletJournals,fcxa8ul,t1_fcwwwgs,1578057143.0,Totally understand that. My bujo is just meant to be functional for me. I do really enjoy seeing everyone else’s decorated covers and such.
BasicBulletJournals,fcwh3q3,t3_ej816y,1578025461.0,"Love it!  I’m on my first year of bullet journaling but my layout is very similar. I’m not into the idea of decorating so mine is very minimalistic, as well."
Sims4,fcv3bzd,t3_eiwo8d,1577993785.0,"I don’t currently use this preset because I don’t really find a need for the preteen age range in TS4 but I came across this a few weeks ago...

bulletjournal,fctl2m2,t3_eisdcn,1577947217.0,I was just listening to that playlist this evening!  Great choice for an opening page. Love it!
bulletjournal,fcr59zz,t3_eifk7q,1577896975.0,"So pretty! I have the same notebook for my 2020 journal. I love it’s minimalist design. The only caveat is that its pages are a bit thinner than I had anticipated. Even with a regular gel pen, I can see writing on the other side."
BipolarReddit,fbb9z0f,t3_ecd73b,1576696102.0,"I had what I call brain zaps. They were bad enough that I’d have to clinch my teeth and close my eyes while they were happening. It was sharp shooting pain through my brain. I also was super agitated and felt like I was crawling in my own skin. It was different than the crawling feeling you get when you start a new med. It was more of a trying to climb out of your skin, if that makes sense."
