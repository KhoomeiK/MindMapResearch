My mom got sick some years back so she can only work 50% and my dad pays for 2 months rehabilitation trips to a warm climate for her aswell, they say they get a government aid, but it cant cover it all. Also dad works as an assistant on weekends and he used to own a massage firm with just himself that he worked on evenings aswell. 

They had to sell their house they had lived in for like 30 years cause they couldnt afford to live in it and moved into the city in an apartment.

Im also very tall so i dont fit in like 95% of cars that exists so these 2 years ive had a job i couldnt find one decent car for me to buy that isnt out of my budget, i wont pay like 30k or something for a car. So i´ve been walking to work taking cab and hitching rides with my colleagus and taking bus all this time."
