videos,ffbrjnk,t1_ffb8nf9,1579779946.0,Absolutely not. I'm having a son soon and don't want him circumsised but my husband isn't convinced
AskReddit,ffbrf16,t1_ffbea4m,1579779787.0,Obviously minus those things. I know Japan isn't perfect.
AskReddit,ffaogxu,t1_ffaba7h,1579740755.0,"Omg yes! The way they keep trash in trash cans and separate everything, the public bathrooms don't have large gaps, bidets everywhere, people mind their own business (for the most part my husband got oogled at by some giggling girls), I could keep going."
AskReddit,ffab9yq,t1_ff9br2n,1579731526.0,"Damn, I just got six months along and my breasts are already leaking. I wish I would have had some warning with that instead of waking in the middle of the night with my chest all wet."
videos,ff7wp5c,t1_ff7fggr,1579660153.0,"There are men out there that do not wash themselves in the nether regions or ass crack because they think it's gay to do so.

I really wish I was making this up but I'm not."
aww,ff4sv3t,t1_ff4qpms,1579571634.0,Omg I have seen so many different snakes eat but never a hognose. They really just go straight to the swallowing part huh? That's hilarious.
TwoXChromosomes,ff4rx1a,t3_erji6d,1579570979.0,"So glad I read this while I'm six months pregnant. But my husband kept telling me it's fine, we make enough, it's not as bad as you think."
AskReddit,ff0tis7,t3_eqvz78,1579472131.0,Magic Eye pictures. I've never ever been able to do it. It just hurts.
AskReddit,felgi4v,t1_fel7czs,1579221629.0,I like the meat of the coconut but the water tastes like semen water to me.
AskReddit,fel3grq,t3_epfjje,1579213241.0,I had a nerve in my tooth die one me. The tooth had been worked on twice but years later I went out to eat and got a hard bit in my burger. I didn't bite down hard or anything. But hours later I got a twinge and then it just kept progressing. It was excruciating. It was fourth of July weekend so it took a couple days to even get to the dentist.
TwoXChromosomes,fekk20k,t3_epkikf,1579201681.0,That's the thing that has scared me most about becoming a mother (24 weeks along). It's like I suddenly won't be an individual anymore and I should just be a parental unit. My needs and interests suddenly won't matter.
AskReddit,feilagw,t3_ep7tm4,1579141177.0,Most of the earlier music by Blue October.
aww,fe4bl1o,t3_enpg8i,1578857624.0,I love watching beardies prepping to eat something.
aww,fdzw1po,t1_fdzpwpo,1578797159.0,Sometimes they do. They might get sticky from some treats like baby food or fruit. Or they could have a jerk cage mate that likes to pee on them.
AskReddit,fdyxdmr,t1_fdxcqrq,1578784533.0,When I first met my husband I just thought he was some drunk guy fishing with my sister and I would never see him again. Didn't think much about him.
missouri,fdoz3xz,t3_emh4gi,1578616176.0,"If Frankie says it then it has to be true. I'm buying my milk, eggs and bread now."
BabyBumps,fdh5pli,t1_fdgft22,1578415943.0,That's a great idea
BabyBumps,fdh5me7,t1_fdfxd0o,1578415888.0,"That's true. Something else I thought of was what if it's as wobbly as people say and my 55lb dog bumps it and breaks it being the klutz he is. 

My mom just likes to give me the guilt trip when I don't take the used things she is always trying to pawn off on me. It's nice to not have to spend the money but sometimes new stuff is nice too."
aww,fcvupda,t1_fcvd6u9,1578010523.0,"It could have been Photoshopped to simulate how starlings see each other. Apparently some birds see in the UV spectrum so ""plain"" birds are actually more colorful."
BabyBumps,fcv0wh4,t3_ej257c,1577992375.0,I'm glad you asked. I'm 22 weeks today and noticed my nipples have been dry and a stain in my bra. If I squeeze them then a bunch of fluid comes out. It's fascinating to me but wasn't 100% sure it was normal.
aww,fcnw0bt,t1_fcnv2h5,1577819552.0,"My dog does this when I am sitting on the couch. I have not trained him. He isn't always interested in playing either because he will look annoyed if I throw the object. 

I read somewhere that some dogs try to trade for something they want.

My dog has brought me his toys, stuffed animals packed away for donation, water bottles, socks, dirty underwear, the pad from a bra, and most recently my pick up sticks game."
LifeProTips,fbudafe,t3_eeh8dp,1577112375.0,Or if they are pregnant. My family tries to get me to have just one drink all the time because they say it won't hurt anything. No thank you
