Yup. And I want to give grants and scholarships to everyone who can get into a school they want to attend.

I will literally downvote all my comments right now. I do not care about internet points.

I think education should be available to everyone who wants it. Obviously there are caveats: we need to bring costs down, unaccredited schools shouldn't get taxpayer money, people should pursue tracks that make sense, and there should be support for people who want to enter the trades etc etc. 

You seem to be upset that some people might get education that you think they don't deserve or can't afford. And I just think that's kinda fucked up.

There are so many problems in the world, but someone stealing an education from taxpayers is not a problem to me. I think the problem is the outrageous cost of schools and you think the problem is the poor people attending them. That's not a good look."

Who cares what it's called? Not all jobs require k-12 either. Are you saying that poor people just aren't allowed to have jobs that require higher education?

Why should we pay for k-12? And why did we start paying for k-12 in the 1910s when hardly anyone went to school? (What a stupid argument.) 


> And you gotta remember... college is not k-12. 

Great point! (lol. it's not)

> Some people never finish college. It’s not for everyone. (See second paragraph before jumping to conclusions)

15% of Americans fail to graduate from high school too. It's just not for everyone. (And it used to be way lower. Can you imagine giving up on k-12 because graduation rates were low and you didn't want to waste taxpayer money?)

> I’m saying I don’t believe in student loan forgiveness. I’m not saying I don’t believe in public funded colleges... (facepalm).

You're position is so soft. Schools are waaaay too expensive for basically everyone. You can't just say ""Everyone who can't afford it should go to community college."" That's basically segregation of poor people. Poor people have a right to equal education. (I literally went to a community college.) Community college isn't even interchangeable with state schools.

> Just like getting a car you can’t afford the payments on. 

AN EDUCATION IS NOT LIKE A CAR. It's not a fucking commodity. ""Only rich people deserve the best schools. Poor people get the shittier schools.""

Do you think people should be able to pay for their own children's k-12 and then not pay towards the public system?

Also, clearly getting rid of everyone's debt and making schools free clearly needs to be accompanied by a plan to reduce the price of education in the US. It's way too expensive and growing too quickly. We clearly agree on that. You just seem to think poorer people don't deserve the same schools as richer people.

60 million people have medicare.

Can you find me a reputable source that thinks the US has better healthcare than France? Because when I google ""healthcare rankings by country"" the US is looking pretty bad. France is often in the top 10 and the us is around 40. In fact, the top 10 countries always have Universal Healthcare. Pretty weird. How many countries are adopting our system?

Also, why would taxes and healthcare not scale well? France only has 66 million people, but it scales to Japan's 127 million just fine. (Oh, shit. Japan has universal healthcare too?)
