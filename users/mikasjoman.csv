financialindependence,ff6l4w1,t1_ff5cmzx,1579629525.0,"Well my mental gymnastics goes like this. I know I don't handle crashes well, so I hedge against it. That's my way to stay in the market given my risk averse personality. On the other end, we got the super risk hungry, they might look at us both as idiots because we don't leverage our portfolios at least 50%, given how cheap it is to leverage a portfolio. We are both losing so much right?  I do understand how you think, we are both making decisions on our willingness to accept risk. I like my smooth curve upward, and accept less returns - like you say a self imposed market crash. I worry much more about my sleep and how I act during market corrections. I do get your point, I just value things you might not. I don't call you an idiot because you go all in on the stock market, that's your choice and hopefully in line with your goals and risk-tollerance. But I do think you should drop the mentality that there is only one way and that's going all in. It's not like I'm making an uninformed choice because I would lack understanding of a 100% equity portfolio."

EuropeFIRE,ff40gil,t3_erio4f,1579552847.0,"There are quite simple steps:

1. Invest in yourself first, aka study so thing you enjoy and that pays well. I did computers... Has served me very very well towards my path to FIRE.  It's a marginal game; the more you earn the more you can save and the faster you get there. It's really hard to reach FIRE with a low paying job.

2. Follow the principle of always paying your future self first: if you earn 100 euro, always directly invest 20 euro the second it hits your bank account so you never see it. Automate it using monthly transfers and invest in global index funds is the common advice here. 

If you follow these two, that's pretty much all it takes. I can not imagine myself starting at age 15, that would have been really cool. But also remember; travel and see the world. You only get one chance at life, so you got to find a balance between YOLO and FIRE ;) Neither to the extreme makes anyone happy"
leanfire,ff3zcpp,t1_ff3w7a2,1579552161.0,"Or if you live in Sweden like me; maximum 1 month as long as your salary is insured. I get 80% of my salary for 250 days if I lose my job which would cover one year of expenses given my higher salary, actually I get unemployment benefits for up to 450 days since I have a child, but it goes down to about 50% of my current salary then. I keep like one month EF with house and family... Not sure I even need that actually. With our safety net... It seems kind of pointless. Worst thing I could see happen is that the heating system breaks down, but that would still be fixable with credit. I'm quite sure that a two year recession would not be felt too hard, given EF and other hedges."
leanfire,ff3kjpn,t1_ff3fasn,1579543008.0,Or... Young out of uni: 1-3 months. Family: 6-12 months. Retired:12-24 months given the need to hedge against drops in the market if you are dependent on your portfolio for living expenses.

Fire,fezkdv6,t1_fey7a0j,1579458252.0,Is it that hard though? I calculated my SR for 2019 and given my pension and the extra my employer set off for me I was at over 60%. 40% of that was my own SR after tax. Seems to me it's actually easier.
financialindependence,feyy6t9,t1_fey7jit,1579451908.0,"I work as an agile coach, but I also use methodologies/frameworks like co-active coaching or Coaching for performance etc. Finding out how to find balance and finding meaning in what we spend our days to do is quite common in my one on one sessions. Therapy can be really useful too, but many times there aren't any deep troubles - just some confusion/unclarity about what people value and a miss match on what they actually do. Clarifying those can be good enough through a normal coaching conversation. Just talking with your best friend about these topics with a friend can be mind opening enough to start moving forward. I still want to highlight that if you feel you might need a therapist, contact one."
EuropeFIRE,feyue0n,t1_feytp01,1579450640.0,"Cheers :) The normal path is starting as a scrum master for some years and then later when senior AND a BIG interest in everything Lean/Agile you start doing more than scrum mastering. I really don't think the role really matters, it is usually a way to increase the price as a consultant."
financialindependence,feytw8f,t1_feythpo,1579450453.0,"Yeah, I do equity/bonds (gov/Corp/short/long) and gold by 60/20/20. So it's kind of a adjusted permanent portfolio that's a bit aggressive. Fits my risk profile and it has given me really good risk adjusted returns."

EuropeFIRE,feyri21,t1_feyj8xs,1579449737.0,They pay depends on skill and experience. Say starting on the lowest and being junior in the SW field... 35k to 80k euro a year for seniors pre tax. Self employed or structures where you keep 80% can likey pull in about 100k or even more pre tax for the senior agile coach here in Sweden. Some pull in even more.
financialindependence,feyqzkd,t1_feyqsnf,1579449505.0,"Cool. Om a bit surprised that the permanent portfolio and it's versions isn't more popular post FIRE, especially the first few years after RE. During buildup it doesn't make sense, but after RE it really does."
financialindependence,fex66yy,t1_fewk3u7,1579425162.0,"Why would it be rare? If anything economic cycles are getting shorter. I try to hedge with a portfolio strategy that tends to weather those climates better as I see it, having my own lighter version of the All weather portfolio (Ray Dalio). Psychologically I just can't handle those hard swings, and using this strategy has helped me go from fear during drops the viewing them as opportunities where I should invest even harder. I'm quite sure many people heavily over estimates how risk tollerant they actually are.  For me it feels great to see the average way below my portfolio. It's a bit like when people reduce the withdrawal rates in bad times. Since I'm holding bonds/gold I sit with extra resources and I also go even more frugal and boost my buying of equity. It's not like I think I can beat the market, instead I feel awesome and find the strength to see the downturn as an opportunity. I know it's sub optimal strategy, but it not only keeps me in the market - it makes me boost my investments during downturns. That's more important for me and it makes me sleep very well at night. For me there is no ""law"" that says that 40% is the bottom, I do not even see a 60% downturn as strange given today's very high PE valuations."
eupersonalfinance,fev3plv,t3_eqn6xh,1579392751.0,Guess it depends on where you live. Here in Sweden most pre approvals are based on credit score and salary level to calculate how high interest rate increase you could manage.
firesweden,fev2684,t3_eqmfmj,1579392227.0,"Well, tech pays well. Early age always invest in yourself, it makes the biggest difference. A second tip is to read rikatillsammans.se with Jan. That's how I got started. Love their videos"

financialindependence,fev138t,t1_fes5hxl,1579391912.0,Seems very conservative given that we have such a big safety net behind us. So 3% SWR to empty it all out until you reach 66?
financialindependence,fev099a,t1_feu3x8a,1579391712.0,"Yeah. I would need about 36k/year to continue the same lifestyle we have today. I bet it's a bit (way more) more if I would live in the states. With that eldercare, medical, uni for my child etc is all solved. So the FIRE number is lower to have the same lifestyle. Still the 4% rule is the same."
financialindependence,fes4q87,t1_fes3t66,1579361405.0,"Indeed. And my employer also allows me to put the yearly bonus to tjänstepension, so that amount is taxed about a little under 5% less. I'm a bit behind in my retirement savings so my plan is to fill that as thick as possible allowing me to RE at at least 55. If you have a high income and you got a flexible employer then those things can make a huge difference."
financialindependence,fes41vw,t1_ferzupb,1579361175.0,"Yeah. Several people say we have many poor retirerees, but that's counting everyone that has 70% or less of the median salary. Personally I remember me and my wife just surviving on 900usd/month when we were both students. So it's definitely survivable and we also give extra housing money from the government if our retirement money goes under a certain threshold to pay rent/mortgage.  I think the median salary right now is at about a bit under 3000k/month. I'm counting on having about 3k/month when I retire in today's money."
financialindependence,ferwuhx,t1_fergpfo,1579359146.0,"Is it really that hard though? Say I earn 100k USD/month pre tax, and I get 61k post tax. Then I have about 20k/usd already in my retirement account paid by my employer. And then I save about 45% of my post tax income. That gives me 47k/usd a year saved to retire. Of course I am a high income earner, but I also need much less to FIRE because I do not need to care about uni, medical, eldercare, etc. Even with a lower salary, I find it highly possible - especially if you buy a LCOL house that can easily be bough for about 30k/year - and basically housing is not taxed at all."
financialindependence,fervexk,t1_fero9k4,1579358723.0,"Swede here, mostly this is exactly what has been accomplished. The ones that hurt are the low income earners because they get ""relatively"" low pension payments; ca 1000 USD/Month. Us high income earners though, we get a big pile of cash put away every month without even mostly people knowing about it - or caring."
financialindependence,ferv41x,t1_ferlkay,1579358611.0,"Wow thats really low. I think the average swede has about 200k USD in their early 40s in their retirement accounts that the employer is forced to pay for. I lived outside of Sweden for many years, not saving a single dime, and that bites me in the ass right now. I calculated my SR including my employers contribution and was surprised that I was at roughly 60% without actually doing any agressive savings."

I don't know what makes you so hostile to someone here giving advice and how managers might view it.

Fire,feeqvxt,t3_eogsd3,1579039291.0,"Well net worth is only really useful if you can access those funds. Say 3.4m out of 3.5m was locked in to your house and you are not ready to sell it, then you would really only have 100k that you can withdrawl from for FIRE. While I track NW, its much more interesting to track the assets that you can withdrawl 4% per year from without the pile getting smaller (compound interest -stocks etc). There is another reason why net worth would be interesting, at least for me, and that is to look at the debt to assets ratio. If it's high, say over 0.5, that means that you would have in my view high leverage (debt), and that could come back and hunt you if the economy goes to shits. Especially if you don't have a reasonable sized  emergency fund. In your case NW also puts a number on the assets you have, and we're you going to sell it now - it's highly likely you could just retire immediately if you relocated (guessing you live in a VHCOL."

As everything with marriage, it's about finding a common view. Getting married to him, means you'll be committed to solving pretty much everything as a team. 
My wife likes spending much more than me, and I love being frugal. So we do traveling/trips, shopping, etc, and I have to accept that we can't save as much I would like to. And that's ok, because it adds a few years to the FIRE path, but we are both happy.
 If leanfire is not for him, maybe FIRE or even fatFire would make him more excited? Or you retiring, but not him. Having too much money is usually not the problem.

Almost everyone here goes the index fund path, because it's really easy to be worse than the average of the market. The common advice here is a mix of bonds/index funds, say 10/90% givet your young age. There is zero value of spending time figuring out what stocks to invest in, that time should be used to create ""active"" income, like the best/most interesting/highest paying job you can/want to strive for.

It's worse if both of the income streams go to shits compared to having a possible currency risk. Otherwise it's a bit like saying that diversification isn't a great idea. Basically his salary can be viewed as a Euro bond paying x per month (maximum allocation) and then again buying excessive Euro passive income streams. I personally think it's way better to diversify globally compared to having all eggs in one Euro basket. Even if he selects a global ETF, there will be a very heavy euro allocation if we add salary plus stocks together."

The first years are terrible for finances, and I think a lot of it has to do with feeling of having to buy stuff that's either not needed or paying 10x more compared to buying it second hand. F.eg children don't care if toys, clothes etc are second hand stuff. To be honest it's kind of good to have them a bit washed (they grow out of them in months), because some of them has endless of shit/poison still in them when delivered from the factories. I remember reading that the average swedish child has like 500+ toys at age 3. Looking at my floor right now, Im thinking ... Where the hell did all those toys come from? My floor looks more like a battlefield of toys than a kitchen :-/"
todayilearned,fde7y0f,t1_fde3m10,1578333148.0,"Isn't that because almost all Forests are ""man made"" by now? Or at least heavily affected by humans? Most of it here in Sweden just looks like big farms of trees."
eupersonalfinance,fddqjnw,t3_ekr2k6,1578321315.0,"Awkwardly and surprisingly I'd recommend my own country; Sweden. We have tax advantaged investment accounts called ISK-accounts (stocks, ETFs/dividends) that are taxed roughly a flat fee of 1% per year right now. So we are heavily taxed on salary, but not so much on stocks. Not the first country people would imagine that is kind of a tax heaven... So taxes would be very low if you just lived here and lived off your investments."
eupersonalfinance,fd290sn,t1_fd28jw7,1578143583.0,"Just a side story. My family owns a year around vacation house that we use to rent out 10 months a year. We stopped renting it out because it was a pain in the butt. House is fully paid off, but we didn't make much cash after we had taken care of the troubles (destroyed stuff, late payments etc - there were so many troubles)."
eupersonalfinance,fd28jw7,t3_ejvd57,1578143380.0,"To be honest, if you would leverage stocks like real estate, your real estate investment would look really crappy. Stocks are also easier to sell if you have to in bad times. My friend bought a house, had to sell it because he got divorced in a bad market and today about 16 years later he is still paying off that loan (almost done). People tend to view the returns of R/E as a special case, but it ain't. It's a BIG bet the market will continue to increase. There are if course pros, like you could move in to it if you can't rent it out. But there are several downsides that can be quite dramatic because if the debt levels. I mean, I would not touch a stock with 100% leverage on their financial statements. But people go wild with debt easily putting themselves into debt levels of 400%. I personally aim for a debt to assets ratio of 0.5, but I'm a few years away from that (lowering it about 5% a year). The second worry I would have is to have so much assets in one asset class. Most people doing real estate for FIRE seems to have totally forgotten that diversification is the only free lunch there is. I feel bad over how my personal house makes me too heavily invested in housing, I can only imagine how the balance sheet would look for someone using real estate to get passive income. Then there are smart examples, like someone buying a house and renting a part of it out without taking in big debt, like one of my friends. So I would not dismiss it totally. If you could buy a house, rent a part of it out and still diversify to other assets like stocks, go for it :)"
eupersonalfinance,fcospdn,t1_fcn6flh,1577840502.0,"Cool. It's kind of funny that people are extremely averse to taking loans to buy stocks, or index funds, but when it comes to buying a investment house they are totally ok using high levels of debt. That doesn't make sense in a sense since I'd rather have a loan owning a small part of thousands of established firms vs owning one asset like one house where it's very binary if it goes well or to shits. To be honest I think leveraging my portfolio to say 20% would be all ok. Compare that to an investment real estate, where people happily takes in 400% debt. It's really strange how one investment is viewed ok to take debt to own, but stocks are ""risky"". Rationally, it makes more sense to take debt to own a small part of thousands of firms because it is diversified compared to owning just one investment that is not diversified."

EuropeFIRE,fcmzkts,t1_fcmriuv,1577798783.0,"Think of it like buying a small piece of thousands of large firms. Depending of which index of course. The biggest index being MSCI World, that includes the biggest firms around the world. If you buy a cheap index fund that follows that index, you basically get the average of the development of the stock markets around the whole world. Most used in these forums would be Vanguard VTIAX or the VTSAX for the us market. Google them and you'll find a ton of info. You get huge diversification and extremely low fees. Paying 1.6% managment fee for a fund might not sound much, until you realize that that's 25% of your profits for any given year. Vanguard is close to zero if I remember right (I live in Sweden so I buy similar funds to Vanguard)."
Fire,fcmothe,t3_ehpwye,1577784814.0,"It's kind of simple math. Would you spend 345k (lost salary and cost of studying) to earn 103k more per year? Payback will be under four years, and after that you get many many years of high income. I'd definitely go that path, only Bitcoin gives higher returns on investment at a much higher risk."
eupersonalfinance,fcmnrox,t3_ehrrro,1577783340.0,I'd guess it's how much of it can be used to loan money to leverage your investments. High risk stocks/portfolios can not be used as security for taking loans. So your bank made an automatic risk analysis and tells you that you can use your portfolio to lend money to buy even more stocks. I would not recommended that you take loans to buy stocks.
leanfire,fcmnkj7,t1_fcmiegf,1577783061.0,"There are definitely many here doing it with less than that. The main point is that when you go lean FI, the margins to cut cost are essentially zero if the market goes sour. That's not a critique, just a fact that if you are lean without any bond tent etc, market downturns will hit you harder since there is very little you can do to remove even more cost. I personally aim for 750k usd here in Sweden, but then I also have a big safety net with free medical insurance etc."
EuropeFIRE,fcmnb0q,t1_fcmh42y,1577782695.0,"Cheers :) I would advise against that of you are a beginner. Most people are worse at investing than the average of the market. That's why it's usually smarter to go with cheap index funds like global MSCI index funds or buying Vanguard VTSAX. The likely hood of you beating the market is... Extremely low. If you buy broad global index funds you get diversification and a mix of both strategies. Investing should be boring, not exiting like betting on lottery tickets. What matters more from a FIRE perspective is how you design your portfolio when it comes to asset classes, like the mix of stock funds, bonds, metals, REITS. I personally hold a portfolio of 60/20/20 cheap global index funds, Corp/gov bonds and gold. It's quite defensive, but it's a portfolio that makes me feel good, especially now when firms are extremely highly valued (p/e at 25) . Your asset class allocation is much more important than dividends vs non dividend stocks."
leanfire,fclpce0,t1_fckrb0r,1577753205.0,"Because mathematically it doesn't add up anymore if you RE. Say you see a drop of 50%, and you have REd with your relatively small portfolio. Now you keep withdrawing because you need that shelter and food to survive. You are now eating your much smaller pie even smaller and you realize that shit... I have to go back to work because even being lean this will never add up again. Your original 500k portfolio quickly went down to 250k and you keep spending 30k/year. After three years and no rebound in sight, it's down to 160k. If you added a 40% bond tent, well, you are much much safer to be able to weather such an event."
EuropeFIRE,fcloavd,t1_fchxv49,1577752496.0,"Leverage is a term describing how much you use credit to buy an asset. Say you buy a house and you out 15% down, the. 85% is leverage. If the house loses 15% or more of its value, you will have a negative net worth. Firms are the same, they use credit to fund their operations/investments for the future. A firm with high levels of debt (leverage), signals that the risks are high because it only takes much less trouble for them to go bankrupt. De leveraging means reducing your debt levels. Say you had to sell that house on a shitty market, or that interest rates suddenly went up, the risk of serious trouble is decreased by amortization of the debt. I personally strive to have a total debt to asset balance of 50%, but I'm still way off because my house is still highly leveraged (big mortgage left). So I track the debt to asset ratio of my balance sheet I make/update for my family every month. Big debt=potential big trouble also for us if the market takes a bad turn or interest rates go up. 

Dividend stocks are stocks that pay out their profits to their shareholders (often quarterly). Some firms doesn't do that, and instead re invests all of their profits. There are different reasons to prefer one over the other. Pension funds f.eg often prefer firms re investing their profits, if I remember correctly it's because it reduces the taxation. They are simply different strategies. There is nothing that makes one firms strategy better. Feg re investing the profits could signal to shareholders that instead of paying out, we will re invest it all because we have confidence that that will make our firm grow even faster."

cults,fcad7x3,t1_fc704o3,1577567184.0,"Sure is. But being extra frugal and investing the savings on low cost index funds ... That's just normal. What FIRE enthusiast mostly do, is to invest away more than the average Joe does per month. I put about 40% of my family's funds to low cost index funds every month, and expect to be financially independent in about 12 years given the performance of the stock markets the last 100 years. Nothing wild or crazy, just reducing wasteful spending and normal investments. That's pretty much it. It would only make you a millionaire in five years if you had a huge freakin salary. For most of us, it takes over a decade. No cult, no leaders, no organization. Just blogs and Reddit groups like  /r/financialindependence"

eupersonalfinance,fc8e85n,t1_fc8dtzk,1577532936.0,Varsågod :) Maybe you could try Lendify instead of Mintos? They automatically deduct your tax and send it to Skatteverket so you don't have to care. Seems easier than reporting manually with Mintos. You should probably decide fast so you only have to declare it to Skatteverket one time since we are reaching the end of the year.
eupersonalfinance,fc8dqmo,t1_fc8bwwf,1577532614.0,"Sure :) Even if you keep the money at Mintos it should be declared, since you received a payment of interest to your Mintos account. This you incurred a profit. The profit is not realized when you withdrawal money, it's when they pay you the interest."
