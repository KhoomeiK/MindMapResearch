medlabprofessionals,ffbiu4d,t1_ffbir91,1579767318.0,It was like 15-20 years ago. Not sure who thought that was a fair idea
medlabprofessionals,ffa7uc7,t1_ff9y3sq,1579729577.0,I know nothing - im not the boss so im not involved in any of that stuff. I think the cards do basically everything that the chem 8 and abg cards for istat do - but combined into 1 card. Ive heard the cost per test is basically a wash but havent seen any documentation on cost.
Darkroom,ff75yxh,t1_ff71hdz,1579641787.0,Im saving for a v800-850. Should do well for 4x5 and up to 8x10 if you shoot that big. Will do well for 120 - and as good as flatbeds can do for 35.
medlabprofessionals,ff6tcih,t1_ff6ta2m,1579634467.0,Nope. Not even allowed to strike - somebody back in the day added a no strike clause to our union contract.
medlabprofessionals,ff6t5b6,t1_ff6sz32,1579634350.0,21 usd is more than i make as an (almost) 10 year tech in the us. My hospital just blows.  This is why i am trying ti get out of the lab. Its not a job that can sustain me or a family fir a whole career.
medlabprofessionals,ff6s4jf,t1_ff4x9l1,1579633737.0,24usd is still more than i make - and ive been an mls for almost 10 years.  I even get to take call on top of my 40.

Darkroom,ff6phjv,t3_ernhx3,1579632159.0,I love developing 4x5 - but I dont have a scanner big enough to scan those big sheets.

medlabprofessionals,fepuahs,t1_fepthsj,1579331530.0,We are trying to get an epoch which i think is made by siemens.
emergencymedicine,fep9a1f,t3_eqa2xy,1579315011.0,Psh. Ive heard of 980. Ive seen 760. 150 is relatively common for CLL. ALL is usually in the 2-400 range.
analog,feogjd7,t3_eq2w9y,1579299863.0,"Sweet picture - hope you get some mad upvote love

Edit: how does complimenting a picture garner downvotes?"
medlabprofessionals,feo62v0,t1_feo3v48,1579295592.0,Fair. I know we are scrambling to get a new method. Point if care is our backup for chemistry - and our only option for abgs. Crucial services to a small emergency department like ours.  So im sure once we switch to something else - we will never go back.
medlabprofessionals,feo32sd,t1_feo1hnd,1579294496.0,"But it took 6 years for the fda to figure out not all the is were dotted? Smells like somebody at abbott pissed somebody off at fda or somebody at semens knows somebody at fda. Just feels fishy - for a device every hospital in the country has used for so many years and only now the fda figures out all the paperwork wasnt done? 

Thats just me being pessimistic - i kneo in reality somebody at abbot just screwed up."
medlabprofessionals,feo138m,t1_fenzvg6,1579293609.0,Well how is the FDA not at fault here. We have been using istat for like 6 years - why now is it not approved?

Spokane,feantqm,t3_eo5koh,1578950679.0,"Everybody that whines about the freeway - I dont think the city has anything to do with plowing i90 since it is a state / interstate highway, which I am fairly certain makes it the states problem to plow."
medlabprofessionals,fe6hbl3,t3_enw9zx,1578890902.0,That sure doesnt look like pseud arug - a pseud sp maybe.  Whats the source? Urine by the streaking?
AnalogCommunity,fe6h3dn,t1_fe2fsay,1578890702.0,"3.75 - no way that is cheaper. I do 15 rolls per liter, that makes it about 1.5 dollars per roll for me. I dont even spend 3.75 per roll developing my own e6."

ems,fe6fecd,t1_fe6eu1x,1578889253.0,Fair. I work in lab and im always surprised at the number of people that i dx with flu - that dont look sick at all. And conversely the number of people that look like garbage - that come back as flu negative. So i cant say that all the “flu like symptoms” i see all have the flu. Thanks for the answer i was just curious.

ems,fe6emd7,t1_fe6dqt4,1578888618.0,How can you tell somebody has the flu on an ambulance? I mean sure they can look like they feel like garbage - but do you get actual updates on your patients when they get a confirmed flu dx?  Just curious.

AnalogCommunity,fdofzkb,t1_fdocqld,1578604376.0,I am pretty sure they announced they are going to (or have) stopped making the 600 though.
todayilearned,fdofib6,t3_emcbmx,1578604110.0,Pretty sure they still do that - when you buy pure etoh for like laboratory use it has a tiny bit of benzene or something in it.

AnalogCommunity,fdo1u7i,t1_fdo1om3,1578597342.0,I (and so do a lot of other people) develop vision 3 films in c41 all the time. Just have to do it yourself instead if mailing it to a lab.
AnalogCommunity,fdo0kju,t3_emazze,1578596636.0,They do - where do you think cinestill gets the film they rebrand.
medlabprofessionals,fdj0j9t,t1_fdj0dum,1578455358.0,Blasts are always abnormal. And don’t *typically* look the same as reactive lymphs. Blasts will have basically no cytoplasm whereas reactive will seem to be crawling especially where they contact RBCs.
medlabprofessionals,fdj089e,t3_elm8dk,1578455146.0,The relative % will differ by age.  Little kids will be higher in a lymph %. The cells will pretty much look the same. A neutrophil will look the same no matter the age. A caveat to that is new borns especially premees can have a lot of lymphs that look relatively reactive.   This isnt necessarily abnormal - if you think about it they are literally trying to grow an immune system from scratch and they have just been exposed to a world of pathogens.

AskReddit,fcl3z5c,t1_fcl3qqq,1577739299.0,Tylenol is usually 500mgs per pill. 10 grams is plenty to kill a person. 3000mg is 30% of that. Doing that daily for a long period is probably not a great idea. 2 pills a day isnt bad. 6-8-10 - thats probably not great.

AnalogCommunity,fbz0vcl,t1_fbytnvf,1577231740.0,"The film will also lose sensitivity so you must add some exposure. I would not follow the same rule of thumb used for color negative of 1 stop per decade - i would add “a little” if i were unsure. In this case i would rate at 50. 

Following this strategy seemed to work ok on this film expired in the early 2000s
