beyondthebump,ff3myyu,t3_erh3ut,1579544506.0,"Some more info:  I'd like to keep my toddler and our newest edition confined to the living room. With a nursling, I won't be able to chase after the toddler and keep her from climbing on the dinner table or out of the kitchen.  

She can push down baby gates that aren't secured so ideally I would like something strong/solid."
BabyBumps,ff349gn,t1_ff26ld3,1579533292.0,"A 2 inch tall floor bed for a baby that can roll is completely fine.  The concern is when you place a baby that can roll on a taller mattress or bed.  As someone who had used one, it's 10x easier to get baby to sleep by laying on the floor with them then to transfer them into the crib.  

Also, a reminder that cribs are not necessarily the ""standard"" throughout the world."

You can add them to any old trashcan. Tighten them and keep it locked until you want to take the lid off.

The one we have was cheaper and less fancy than this, but similar."
clothdiaps,fed5mim,t3_eoenmf,1579000045.0,We have a locking lid bin with a reusable pail liner.  You can also make it more secure by adding a locking strap to it if your dogs are the type to try and knock things down.

Many states outline that failure to report is punishable by fines and/or jail time if it is found that you have failed to perform this duty.  

Essentially, if you work with the vulnerable, you have a duty to stand up for them.

SAHP,fct9vml,t3_eir228,1577936795.0,"Oh! Oh! I can answer this one!! 


I went with a traditional route to getting certified in my state.  I go to a small university close to me that has a good program, and started when LO was 6 months. My degree will be in English Education and certification for 6-12 ELA.  I graduate in May, just about the time LO #2 is due.  

I'm a full time (12+ hours) student with a mixed bag of classes online and on campus.  Typically I've been on campus four days a week for a few hours or so. I've been taking 18 hours of classes during the full semesters and 6-9 hours during the summer...except 25 hours Spring 2019 (I had to take certain classes before student teaching).  18 hours was manageable, but last Spring was super tough. My GPA is still around a 3.8 though.   

Student Teaching will be difficult if you go a traditional cert. route. I just finished that and it was a struggle on my family.  I was essentially working full time and paying thousands for it. My state requires 16 weeks of internship with a mentor teacher along with passing all certification tests for a university to call their program accredited. I know that some states require a full year.


As far as experience, I have honestly had a good experience! My family has been supportive of me and helping out when needed. I've built good relationships with professors who have connections and provided me with an opportunity for a scholarship.  I've learned quite a bit I didn't know about the science and art of teaching, and made some very good friends.  It has been a struggle, but very, very worth it."
SAHP,fci0ztj,t1_fcf1r9p,1577656462.0,"I try to make the time we go out right after breakfast. She's fed, changed, and we're not struggling to get everything ready.  Usually I just have to grab a sippy cup and we're off to do our thing.   

Keep these in the car to make it easier to transition into the activities easier: shoes, non-perishable snacks, and extra diapers (and a toy!).  My kid takes her shoes off mid-ride all the time so I just leave them in the car. If the drive is longer than 20 minutes I also bring my iPad so she can watch an episode or two of something entertaining while she plays with her toys. It's not always perfect but makes things run a little smoother."
SAHP,fcf0rls,t3_eh5opp,1577625558.0,"I try really hard to get us out of the house every other day or so.  Whether it's going to an indoor playground or just running general errands.  I notice when I don't go out for more than a few days and then try to get LO out, she acts like a lunatic. Climbing, yelling, and generally not behaving very well for a two year old.  It also helps when I do it in the morning instead of during the afternoon.

If I need time to myself I ask for it on the weekends and generally get a few hours of it."
