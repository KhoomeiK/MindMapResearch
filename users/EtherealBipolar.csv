It didn't seem like a malicious comment, just came out so blas√© as if it were some fact of life everyone is meant to know. 

In all fairness to them, pop culture only seems to portray bipolar in media in women (and only the fun stuff about it) so I don't blame them entirely. It's just a phrase that I think will always stick out to me. 

My best/now only friend was very supportive, he doesn't really understand any of it but at least he tries. He took it rather well, although I do get the clich√© ""cheer up"" occasionally."
