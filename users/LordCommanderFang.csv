AskOldPeople,fenyn2x,t1_femcevx,1579292688.0,"The earliest sign was that discipline and the feelings of others have absolutely no effect on him. He would plot to cause harm to other people or get what he wanted, not impulsively but very calculated, and, when there was a negative consequence, he didn't care. Fortunately, his behavior doesn't extend to animals, but he treats people as a means to an end, rather than people.

I worked with him for years with counselors and he'd, without fail, go in and use superficial charm to convince them he was improving.

breakingmom,fdokd1l,t3_emekmk,1578606898.0,"Resentment is a sign of caregiver burnout. Do you have access to resources for your son? Maybe respite would be helpful for you. I know here in Ohio there are programs to allow parents to have a break from being a full time caregiver.

I know that, as a special needs mommies, we can kind of feel like we are falling short if we can't provide everything our child needs, but our children are not typical and, to give them our best, we sometimes need help and that's okay.

Everything you're feeling is common among caregivers and it's good that you're talking about it.

If you don't have services set up yet, I'd suggest contacting your child's hospital social worker, your local board of developmental disabilities, or your child's doctor to start the ball rolling and get some assistance. If you have private health insurance, I'd contact them as well for information on home care, therapies, or respite.

You're doing great, please take care of yourself."
