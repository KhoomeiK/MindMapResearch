I laid traps all near the doors and climbed to the next level, where I could get a clear shot. He saw me and I ate a mini nuke. I came back and tried it again. I did the same thing, and using my sniper I killed him. I dropped through a whole in the roof to loot him, and landed on my landmine. Needless to say I didnt go back."
