quityourbullshit,fdviju9,t1_fdveguq,1578747770.0,"We use AC because the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

One the advantages being that if the electricity being distributed is AC, then there is no need to convert AC to DC at the powerplant (as the current being outputted from the generators is AC). 

Another advantage is that it is easy to step up and step down voltage when using AC current (as you can't step up or step down voltage using DC unless if you convert it into AC first). This is cruicial as power distribution networks need high voltage (and low current) when distributing electricity accross long distances otherwise the wires will heat up and subsequently lots of energy will be wasted (joule heating is proportional to current).

As a result, an AC power distribution network wastes less energy, which makes it much easier to distribute power across long distances."

I don't think they can really do that. A common misconception that I've seen on this subreddit is that people seem to think that the money from the fines go back to the organisation that has issued it. (For example: The money from a fine issued by a police force will go back to that police force).

Instead it goes to the government central bank account, which then gets redistributed (like taxes) to schools, NHS, gov dept, etc. Therefore, the organisation that has installed these cameras will only recieve a small amount of the revenue they generated from the fines issued by the anti lane hogging system as the vast majority of the money would have been given to other organisations."
