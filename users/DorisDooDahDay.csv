I'm UK where laws and school system are different.  I've heard of some British schools not dealing with assaults because they write it off as bullying and a childish problem when its among children.  One way round that is to report it to the police yourself.  This is a physical assault, threatening behaviour and (in UK at least) a hate crime which means it is a more serious crime.  I know it sounds like an extreme course of action but please consider getting the police involved and pressing charges.

Your daughter has been punched in the head.  And threatened again afterwards.  The school are not protecting her.  

Also, the perpetrators are children who need to learn acceptable behaviour and the consequences of breaking the law.  It seems they are not getting these important life lessons from family and school.  It could be said that by reporting them to the police, you are actually helping them where family and school are failing them.  

Please post an up-date and let us know how things work out."

todayilearned,ff7pqfo,t1_ff72c1x,1579655356.0,"Evans had low IQ and couldn't read.  He spoke with a regional accent and was known to loudly argue with his wife.  He looked up to Christie and probably believed Christie was medically qualified and putting his own reputation on the line by helping out with performing the abortion. 

Christie was manipulative and had a good reputation, for example despite having record for theft he had a position with War Reserve Police.  He was said to have spoken well and gave the impression that he was from a richer or more genteel background and had fallen on hard times.  He exaggerated his WWI record to impress people.  He gave evidence in open court (that helped convict Evans) in a whispered voice, claiming this was because of exposure to gas during the war.  

I believe there was an element of class discrimination in the case, and Christie hoodwinked everyone, including Evans.  There was evidence that would have pointed to Christie but the police investigation was flawed, and they believed Christie.

Did Evans really confess?  Forensic linguistics showed language used in his various statements was not consistent with his grasp and use of English, but rather matched that of police officers.  Remember he couldn't read.

Evans did not know his baby daughter had died until he was in police custody.  He believed Christie when told Geraldine had been adopted by a suitable couple.  To me it seems particularly vile that Evans was hanged for Geraldine's murder rather than that of his wife.  He was known to be a loving dad.

Evans was completely out of his depth, out manoeuvred and out gunned.  He must have been grieving and in a state of shock.  He didn't stand a chance."

And Storey's testimony was absolutely corroborated by the DNA findings, when it was extraordinarily difficult for her to give such strong testimony when so traumatised and injured.  Anyways the DNA says he was guilty."

Bentley's conviction was quashed on legal grounds.  

I suspect it was too difficult and contentious to admit we should not be hanging adults who are really children.  I'll bet the same thing is still happening in countries with the death penalty."

Is a good film, great acting.  But I don't think a film can tell the whole story in such a complicated case.  There were Christie victims buried in the back garden before death of Mrs Evans and her (and baby Geraldine's) bodies were hidden under floorboards taken up AFTER Evans had fled.  Police could have investigated more carefully and outcome would have been different.  Very sad."
todayilearned,ff7jm8t,t3_ery2yg,1579651094.0,"Another case that made headlines was Derek Bentley, who shouted ""Let him have it, Chris"" to Christopher Craig, his accomplice, who then shot dead PC Sidney Miles.  This was after a copper had shouted to Craig to hand over the weapon.  The phrase is so ambiguous, I would hate to be a jury member deciding on that one.  

Bentley's mental age was assessed as young as 11 years, he suffered head injuries as a child including being ""bombed out"" during WWII.  So could be argued it was the same as hanging a child.  

There is no justice system robust enough to ensure 100% accuracy convicting the guilty."

todayilearned,ff7gjmu,t1_ff6k2ow,1579649038.0,"Christie killed other victims before and after the murders of Beryl Evans and baby Geraldine.  Timothy Evans was actually convicted and hanged for the murder of Geraldine.

There was evidence at 10 Rillington Place that the police missed or manipulated.  If they had not, they might have caught Christie earlier.  There were human remains in the back garden, including a thigh bone which was reported as being visible and propping up a garden fence (at time of Christie's arrest, so may have been hidden at time of Evans' investigation).  Beryl and Geraldine's bodies were hidden behind wooden planks in an outdoor wash house.  The planks were moved by workmen AFTER Timothy Evans left the property.  The workmen were repeatedly questioned until they changed the dates they said they moved the planks.  Police knew the dates did not match up, and unfortunately dealt with incorrectly.  But hindsight ...

This case has always made me anti capital punishment.  I even question that DNA evidence is unequivocal enough to make use of death penalty safe - how the evidence, DNA or otherwise, is interpreted and presented is so vital."

whatisthisthing,fdcrexv,t1_fdaka4v,1578282191.0,"I remember reading in one of the books from Little Women series and also in British literature, about the making of something they called beef tea.  Victorians believed this was highly nutritious and easy to digest, particularly beneficial for the sick/recovering patient.  It was a loving dutiful thing to do and they had great faith in its efficacy.  I wonder if this contraption was to make beef tea?  1900 is late Victorian, but still Victorian."
