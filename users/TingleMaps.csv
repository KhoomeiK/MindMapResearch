Thought I’d offer a bit more:

I’m a long time Fitbit user (~4/5 years) that was finally convinced to switch when google bought them a while back. Grabbed a close out Nike+ Series 4 and decided to dive right into the fitness side again. Closed my rings on December 1 and had previously seen the perfect month here so decided: why not?

About that 1390 goal:

That’s what most of you keep commenting on, so I’ll try to provide some info: 

A lot of that comes from the fact that I am 6’7, M, 275ish. I was going to have a higher goal to begin with, ha. (In fact I was a little frustrated at first seeing goals of around 500-600 when I first joined the sub)

That being said: it’s completely obtainable. I do about 2 workouts per day. One is generally just light jogging (think like 12-16 minute miles) just to elevate my heart rate and the other is generally just an evening walk. I’d say in total I am generally logging about 80- 120 active minutes in a day. 

Some things I’ve realized:
1. Just get the heart rate up, but sustainable. For me, if I am in that 90-110 bpm zone, I can just keep power walking/jogging for a long time.

2. Log everything, within reason, as a workout. Maybe it’s in my head, but I feel like I get more accurate Move calories if I’m logging something. At the very least I am paying better attention. Taking the dog on a five minute walk? Log it. Walking to a meeting at work? Log it. Again, I’m not sure the science behind it or if it’s all in my head, but it seems to help.

3. Don’t push it TOOO hard. Take some breaks, don’t feel like you have to get it all in one workout (schedule permitting). Just this Monday it’s asked me if I wanted to up the goal to 1520. I said no. 

P.S. down 17ish pounds since November,"

AppleWatchFitness,fc5gfh8,t3_eg4gbo,1577456871.0,"Similar story:

I was training for a long time to run a half marathon and logging everything with MapMyRun. On the day that I decided to go for it, I was just crossing mile 13 and just had one tenth of a mile to go when for some reason I clicked “complete run” on the app then “finish” (or whatever the combination of buttons was the time to end the workout). I jumped like 3 feet in the air and screamed the f word (much to the surprise of the 13 year old on the other side of the street).

I started a new workout and ran an extra half mile or something as self punishment.

It wasn’t an organized race or anything, just me trying for a goal. Now my official record looks like I came up just short even though I didn’t, ha

Long story short, it taught me: the journey is the reward, not the gratification of some app! Happy to see you’re not giving up! :-)"

AppleWatchFitness,fc31ktx,t3_efwle4,1577379350.0,"This post feels tailor-made for me to answer as someone who just switched from Fitbit to Apple Watch about 1 month ago. (didn’t want to be under the Google umbrella). I had been a Fitbit user for 5+ years.

I definitely had concerns: 

1. Leaving the Fitbit App. 

2. Battery Life. 


I can honestly say now, the Apple Watch is MUCH better. 
It took some tweaking of my goals, but I actually found, after some personal goal setting, that the Apple Watch rings are much harder to achieve. That keeps me motivated. My move goal is 1390 per day (I’m a pretty tall guy, like 6’7, 270ish), but this still gets me moving more than my Versa did.

Another tip: Download Pedometer++. It will put steps on your watch face, just like Fitbit does.

I never really used the sleep tracking, so I simply bought a stand and charge my watch each night.

It definitely takes some getting used to, but it’s been worth it. Take some time and look up how to customize your goals. That and Pedometer++ are my two biggest suggestions.

P.S. I’m down 16 pounds since I switched and have a perfect month so far in December! You can do it!"
