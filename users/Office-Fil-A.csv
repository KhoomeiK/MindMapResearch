loseit,ffcouap,t3_esv86s,1579804038.0,I'm interested!
loseit,ffcom5w,t3_esvmod,1579803904.0,"I'm happy to have stumbled upon this and r/progresspics because I'm also very impatient, but there's so many real people achieving their goals doing what I'm doing. I know I can do this even if it takes years."
loseit,ffco84t,t3_esw6f8,1579803664.0,"I'm glad someone asked. I've been doing similar this time around, only eating one meal and maybe a granola bar or snack in the morning/afternoon"
loseit,ffco00x,t3_esw8t2,1579803525.0,"I used to do this, I haven't had to yet because it hasn't been too bad but in the past I would on days I got around 3000 calories. I'd usually just give up cus I didn't want to see it or leave the day incomplete and start again the following day. I told myself I won't do it this time though and I'll be completely honest with myself."
OfficeDepot,ffb3x45,t3_esn6l4,1579751147.0,I just tell them we can't copy that and walk away. Managers back me up soooo....
depression,ff930oc,t3_esah14,1579703604.0,"Crazy, it happened to me too(sort of), I was getting up to leave and I looked at the girl behind me when I was leaving cus I had to put my coat on, she smiled. I smiled back cus I'm happy she's friendly if we ever have to work together. Here's another (smile) for you, have a good day."
college,ff84ww8,t3_es46nt,1579666084.0,"I easily spend 400-800 on books and online codes each semester. Last semester I had to buy the same code 3 times. First time I bought a physical copy from my school's bookstore and I lost it(not even mad cus of second time) then the second time I bought an online code from my school's bookstore that did not work(probably the physical one wouldn't have either). Finally bought it directly from webassign. Spend about $300 on just that class. Also yes I did try to get a refund for the one that didn't work, I couldn't because they couldn't prove I hadn't used the code. It's insane to spend so much just on books. This semester I have cengage unlimited for stats and calc, $120. Rented two books for intro to personality ~$150 I think. Then Sapling and Aleks for Chemistry ~$160. Shitty thing about the online stuff is that you have to buy it for assignments, books you can sometimes get around by sharing or going to the library, it's such a scam."
OfficeDepot,ff7nvtn,t1_ff7nncw,1579654052.0,"No, I started to register in January (like the 7th) following the page from corporate, but then realized that the deadline to be sent off electronically was Dec 31st so I stopped, then tried it the other day when they said W2s came out and it worked for me."
loseit,ff253se,t3_er784h,1579494054.0,"Me too, I've started watching calories and now want to workout as well, I don't have a lot of extra money so if I get a gym membership I wanna know I'll use it, so I want to commit to myself here and say I will exercise at least 30 minutes 5 times a week for the next month on my own and if I can I'll invest in the membership. Hoping to find the discipline to keep me going, I struggle with working out at home. Best of luck"
loseit,ff1zm3n,t3_er5bbr,1579489903.0,"Skirts, crop tops, high rise jeans and shorts, dresses without leggings. But mostly I'm excited to be able to go into a normal store and find cute clothes in a size I can fit in at a reasonable price. Right now anything cute that fits me costs twice as much as it does for my average sized friends, and lasts half as long(especially pants because of how thick my legs are)."
depression,ff1xuos,t3_er5n7t,1579488659.0,"I do the same thing, I retyped this comment 3 times. I'm always paranoid of being seen by someone I know and them realizing how I feel. My fiance is always around and I feel bad burdening him. I hope that it helped to put it in words."
OfficeDepot,fezmn7x,t3_eqyw2p,1579459058.0,"My store requires high school diploma or ged. I was hired a couple weeks before I turned 18, but I had already graduated. I think each GM can choose the requirements to a certain extent."

AskReddit,fewilal,t3_eqhs5b,1579411275.0,"Owning more than one pair of a certain type of shoe. Growing up I had a $20 pair of sneakers from walmart that I'd wear till there were multiple holes and the soles completely fell apart and a pair of cheap flip flops or sandals for around the house or yard work. There were people I went to high school with and now in college too who own more than 20 pairs of shoes, fancy sandals, tennis shoes, and boots. Not the cheap walmart ones either but name brand. That's rich people stuff. Even today I own a pair of tennis shoes, a pair of sandals, and a pair of rain boots since I walk around my campus in the rain so much. I'm not not poor, but what extra money I do have isn't spent on shoes."
college,fewesbb,t3_eqpk6u,1579409387.0,"I read my textbooks ahead of time and do a note system recommended by my high school psych/world history teacher. It's not a specific note system but probably closest to outline. I write the title of the chapter/section, then read a paragraph or two(depending on size) and summarize it in my notes, if I can't summarize it I read it a second time. If there is an important date/name/equation that I should know I write that as well in a different color and indented.
eg.
CHAPTER TITLE
Section Title
  -summary(1-2 sentences per paragraph)
          *important facts/dates/people/equations in different color
I do this ahead of class, then just listen in lecture which helps me to reinforce my learning, I only write down subjects that will be on the test, that I did not read about, or that I still don't fully grasp even after lecture(I then watch YouTube videos on the subject that I can take thorough notes on and follow examples step by step).
At the end of the day these work for me, but they may not for you, figure out how you learn best, I learn best through hearing and actively doing things, so handwriting my notes and listening to lectures really help me the most. You may be more of a visual learner though and drawing graphs and diagrams may help you more, as well as watching someone work out a problem, either in lecture or on YouTube.
If you do want to try and take notes in lecture I recommend asking professors if you can record the lectures, most are fine with it, some aren't but it can't hurt to ask, you can just shoot them an email if you don't want to ask in person. I did know someone whose professor did not allow phones so she had to buy a tape recorder, that's a possibility as well."
relationship_advice,feo3tmi,t3_eq2pdm,1579294720.0,"Honestly he sounds like an immature child, a real partner would support you trying to improve yourself and definitely wouldn't expect you to move in and support them while they are being lazy(which is what it sounds like from you saying he works seasonal and won't find a full time job, my apologies if he is a student or has some other serious reason for not finding a full time job)

I'd say you should let it go and do what's best for you, you can find someone else who genuinely cares about you and will support you in your goals."
relationship_advice,fenzbwk,t3_eq3aq0,1579293007.0,"Tell him you don't want him to meet up with her because this is your time with him and it will upset you, you shouldn't have to spend your weekend trip upset because of this. He can make separate plans to meet up with his friends that don't involve infringing on your time together. If you tell him you'll be upset and he does it anyway then that's something else, and y'all will have to talk about your relationship. If the girl is his friend she'll understand that this is your time and will make different plans that are exclusive to them.

Honestly tho, I don't think he has a crush on her like others are saying, I can't say for sure or say if he made these plans prior without your knowledge although that seems like a possibility. I think if he liked her he would've traveled by himself or with someone who wouldn't expect him to spend time with him, then he wouldn't have had to worry about telling you at all, he also invited you along.

TLDR: Tell him you don't want to do that on your trip together and you're upset about it, he should understand. I doubt he has a crush on this girl like others are saying."
depression,feld26h,t3_epmgz5,1579219324.0,"I live in the midwest United States and saw a politician argue against global warming by saying ""look at the midwest, how could global warming be a thing?"" It was 70 degrees Fahrenheit on Christmas this year, the week after I wore t shirts and tank tops. As a kid we would get snow once or twice a year at least, and at least a foot or 2 every time. It hasn't seriously snowed in my city for the last 5 years at least and it makes me wanna cry because I love the snow.  Our summers have progressively gotten hotter and now our winters seem non existent, it's absolutely insane."
relationship_advice,feh2nrb,t3_ep3f6t,1579107875.0,"I read your original post and really felt for you, I know I'd be in the same position with my SO if I was ever sexually assaulted. He's often said hearing about that stuff makes him think about how he'd react if that ever happened to me, and he's a very emotional person. While your partner's feelings are valid make sure that you are your own priority, if his behavior is hurting you more talk it through with him and if the situation continues to escalate think about spending some days apart, maybe with you staying with your family if you're able, that way you can both calmly work through your feelings towards one another. If that isn't possible just try to communicate openly about how you feel until he is ready to seek therapy."
depression,feft8l4,t3_eox8w3,1579064494.0,"I'm not formally diagnosed with depression or anxiety because I've never seen a psychologist but I believe I've had these issues consistently since I was at least 10, I'm now 19 and while I'm currently in a state where I have more good than bad days, it could flip at anytime. I expect to deal with these issues until the day I die and I've made my peace with that. My point is age doesn't matter for these issues, don't let anyone invalidate you because of your age. People would roll there eyes if I brought up depression or anxiety while in middle and high school like there was no way someone my age could be seriously dealing with these issues. Wasn't until I wrote my college essay and opened up about my struggle with suicidal thoughts in detail did my English teacher see and she expressed concern and told me her 8 year old son has dealt with these issues and is in therapy for them."
loseit,fee3ur3,t3_eipvpv,1579025839.0,"I'm at my heaviest weight, 230 lbs, that's over 100 lbs over my recommended weight, I'm 5'3. I'm so depressed cus I just keep gaining and it's time I do something about it. Your advice seems very doable and I really want to lose weight, my goal has been 160 for awhile, but for now I want to focus on getting back under 200. That was a huge milestone for me when I lost weight the first time around. Congratulations on reaching your goal hopefully in 3 years I'll be almost there too."
depression,fcw0iti,t3_ej4e4s,1578014333.0,"It's my lack of religion that makes death something I don't want when I really think about it. I can't imagine just not existing having completely disappeared from the world. I've been depressed and had suicidal thoughts but recently watched a ted talk which mentioned an important distinction between legitimately wanting to die vs just not wanting to feel the way you do anymore and for me personally I want to not be depressed and have anxiety but I'm not ready to blip out of existence yet. Some people long for that release but to me I want to experience that release and the feeling of nothing but that's not what I believe happens when I die. It's something that I can't ever take back and that release can't even be enjoyed because my brain will no longer function, I wouldn't know that I no longer have depression and anxiety because I wouldn't know anything. That being said I don't live in fear of death. I'm prepared for it when it happens and am just trying to pick myself up enough to experience as much as I can before I just disappear and no one remembers or cares due to the overarching insignificance of the human race in the grand scheme of the universe."
depression,fclfk70,t3_ehotyn,1577746629.0,"I understand this, I try to be positive and cheery when I talk to people, but was having a really hard time a couple months ago and no one cared. I tried to talk about it and show how I felt and people just danced around it or felt uncomfortable. I feel like I have so few true friends, just a bunch of people who I have superficial relationships with, no one is willing to actually be there when I need help. I finally just had to pull myself up like I always do, but it gets harder and harder every time, especially realizing no one really cares one way or another. If not for my family and fiance I would have killed myself, not that they are there for me either, but I don't want to leave them with the burden of a funeral and the guilt of knowing I asked for help and they all turned a blind eye and made it seem like no big deal... I hope you find the support you need either in a friend or in yourself."
OfficeDepot,fc1dg68,t3_ecfsez,1577315457.0,Do other stores keep their fax machine out for customers to use on their own? I always tell them total first and get payment before I send the fax because we've had people try to walk out before after sending huge faxes. If it doesn't go through I refund it. Half the people leave when they find out the price.
depression,f8bpwvl,t3_e01pm1,1574442599.0,"Definitely seek help, if those good things and friends disappear while you're trying to better yourself, then they weren't worth living in misery all alone."
