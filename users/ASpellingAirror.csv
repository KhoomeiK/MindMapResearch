Gunners,ff94ag0,t1_ff8osjs,1579704498.0,"You sound like a guy who has never played 10 v 11 against a quality opponent for 60+ minutes. It’s grueling and you have to play smart and not over commit forward which limits your scoring chances. 

I’m more disappointed with how we opened the game 11v11 than what we did once we went down a man."
Gunners,ff93sbg,t1_ff8rc9w,1579704148.0,"That it wasn’t even looked at it what annoyed me. It was worthy of consideration. Go to VAR, maybe you determine he didn’t effect the play, but man was that at least worth a second look.

The survey then asked people what they would want to see to get capitalism more aligned with what they want. A concern from CEO’s in local issues would be a huge step in the right direction. 

The issue most see with capitalism is that it’s 100% about the shareholders in the now and never about the long viability and sustainability and how the company can actually contribute to the community. Which is better for the long term health of the companies."

MovieDetails,fezue4f,t1_feyq990,1579461779.0,"Vader is just toying with Luke in that fight. Luke is so over matched Vader doesn’t really even need to break a sweat.

Then you have the fight in Jedi, Luke is over matched again but trying to pick at the good he feels is still in his father. Then Vader threatens his sister and luke goes full anger, latches onto the dark side and just lets hate control him. He just bludgeons Vader into submission. The darkside is far more powerful to the unskilled than the light side. Vader wants this to happen. He’s been goading Luke the whole time to get this reaction. Luke then realizing what his has done, what he was becoming, Luke chooses to let go of that anger, let go of the power of the darkside, and give in to his fate to stay on the path of the light. 

Those fights were about the character and storyline not breakdance fighting. It’s why Those were good movies and the prequels and sequels are hot steamy shit."

AmItheAsshole,fevhawj,t1_fevfd7w,1579397430.0,"Your cousin is a complete and total asshole. I don’t have much good to say about her. Want to know why her husband didn’t tell her about the worst thing that ever happened to him? Because he knew she was such a vain person that she would instantly go drama queen, make it about herself and attack him. 

What kind of monster threatens to divorce someone because they lost a child before they met. 

Your cousin is straight up one of the biggest assholes in the history of this sub. I pity her son and husband. I don’t give three shits about her excuses. Being abused in your past doesn’t make you abusing someone else ok."

Gunners,fesgtak,t3_eqhblc,1579364957.0,Our fast break has left a bit to be desired today. I think a big part of it is that Ozil passes seem to be a bit heavy today. But everyone seems to be a bit off when we are breaking.

movies,fes0ye0,t1_ferqw7s,1579360288.0,"This is the answer. You are supposed to be unsure of Andy being innocent until the reveal comes. It’s why they play up that every other prisoner says they are innocent and that Red is “the only guilty man in Shawshank.” 

If you know for a fact Andy is innocent from the start the movie wouldn’t be nearly as good. That you are unsure about him and still find yourself rooting for him only to have the big reveal be that he was innocent the whole time has a much greater impact. 

OP is reviewing this scene incorrectly because they are viewing it with the hindsight of having seen the movie multiple times and knowing the twist is coming."
TwoXChromosomes,fep1lmx,t3_eq969n,1579310102.0,"It sucks to tell someone you love them and not be told it back. That said, Him not being at a point where he can say “I love you” after only dating 3 months is not that odd. I have never told someone I love them that early in a relationship. 

Also you picked a odd time to tell him you love him. He had just told you he wanted to dial things back a bit and your response was to escalate in the other direction. If he had said “I love you” back that would have been some bipolar level mixed signals. 

Give the relationship some time, it really is a new relationship and at 3 months you really haven’t seen much behind the curtains on the persons true personality yet. Time will give you more perspective."

Unfortunately if you use a bumper plate on each side and then load the rest of the bar with iron plates those bumper plates are not able to support the load you are placing on them and they get destroyed very quickly. It’s probably part of the reason they have a shortage of bumper plates now. 

That said, it sounds like they are being hypocrites as the staff are violating this rule and they don’t seem to be replacing the damaged plates in order to have enough proper equipment. 

Will they let you deadlift with all iron plates? Most places will let you as long as you do a controlled decent on a mat."
