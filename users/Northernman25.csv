psychotherapy,ffca5pa,t3_eso86s,1579795016.0,"Generally I think with ASD youths one has to do lots psychoeducation especially in the problem areas, and much less asking and being passive. Think of how you would be with a child with similar problems. Maybe just try to focus on the anger management at first, starting with how anger feels and what causes it etc. Read about autism and the other neuropsychiatric disorders."
gaming,ff9y4gr,t1_ff9gwnu,1579724018.0,Well you just had to say what you thought this post was didnt you?
getdisciplined,ff9viyz,t3_es7su4,1579722416.0,"You need to radically change your daily life in order to radically change. How bad do you want it? If you stop being on the computer, you have time to think and get enjoyment out of new things. Eventually your brain will get used to being without internet. Lots of addicts recover from their addictions. Boredom will not kill you. Actually it might cure you a lot. Maybe write down some principles on your new discipline and especially that why you are doing things differently now. It will be uncomfortable, but I think you will feel a lot more alive when you start taking action on this."
gaming,ff6gfme,t1_ff6f0hx,1579626650.0,Agreed. Played it through on all difficulties at least once.
IAmA,femkeqd,t3_epvbq5,1579260012.0,How do you feel at the moment about all of this?
getdisciplined,femjz4x,t1_fejukok,1579259425.0,Uhh it is totally possible to escape sadness. You are just thinking from one perspective now.

Nootropics,fegia3t,t3_eomahf,1579093627.0,"Haven't seen anyone mention it, but try doing a ""dopamine detox"", which means cutting out things like youtube/twitch/internet use, which are in a way immediately rewarding and thus you don't have the drive to do things that are not immediately rewarding. This just in a nutshell though. Also NoFap really brings your drive to do things for yourself together with that. I haven't looked into it much, but definitely it is so for me that the more I do these activities which are immediately interesting and rewarding, the less I care about doing anything else really, and end up with a feeling of dread."

Nootropics,fdvvo17,t1_fdr8k62,1578752076.0,"Quality green tea is amazing. By far the best stimulant, and extremely healthy too."
Nootropics,fbx77pq,t1_fbvfzfo,1577172416.0,"They tried to find the gene for decades and with billions of dollars but to no avail. The etiology is still very complex. The ideal treatment should be holistic such as a certain psychotherapy based on the individual, nutrition and lifestyle coaching and psychiatric medicine. The priority may be in reversed order."
