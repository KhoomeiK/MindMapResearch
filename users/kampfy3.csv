""I rented a car a couple weeks ago, in Los Angeles.  Had the car for a few days.  And then when I went home, I had to drop the car - you know, you have to go to the rental place, that's off the airport - give 'em the car, give 'em your thing with the mileage, and then you have to get on a bus and go to your terminal and check in.  

I was late and I was worried about missing my flight so I knew I had no time to do any of that, so I just - I never did this before - I just drove the car right to the terminal and I just...left it there, and just got on the plane.  And once I was on the plane and I had a little moment I called Hertz and I said, 'Hey, your car's sitting in front of Terminal 4 and the keys are in it, so...that's where it is.'

And the guy's like, 'You can't do that!  You have to return it to the location, and...,' and I was like, 'Well, I didn't do that already, and now I'm leaving California, so if you want your car, you need to go to that place where it is.'  And he was like, 'Ah Jesus, man!  Well, alright.  We'll get it.'  And that was the end of it!

And I realized, I can do this every time!  Every time I rent a car!  Of course they want you to do all that shit.  But if you don't, they still want their car back!  They're gonna send a dude.  You could drive a car until you don't want it - just get out of it while it's moving and walk away, 'Oh, I don't feel like being in that car any longer.'  Just call Hertz:  'Hey, your car is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway.'

But see, this is a terrible realization, because you should act in a way that, if everybody acted that way, things would work out.  Because it would be *mayhem* if everybody was like that."""

But I also see the viewpoint of those who see this as Bungie spoiling its own mysteries.

2) While we're on the subject of spoilers: the data miners who pumped info into every Discord server and Reddit thread. Took whatever shred of cool mystery remained and killed it pretty thoroughly.

That's actually the problem; there's so fucking many government contractors that I imagine it's relatively easy for one corrupt asshole to set up a ton of shells that aren't easily traceable back to them, and do a shitty job on all of them for massive profit. 

The investigative effort that would be required to link them to the total amount of money they've made by effectively scamming the government would be enormous, and would basically require insider knowledge that they're doing it in the first place, unless they're ENORMOUSLY stupid about it.

I mean, fuck. Look how long it took the government to catch Manafort, and he was the grifter equivalent of a weed dealer driving a new Ferrari every 3 years for 3 decades.

There are plenty of huge charities that still do a damn good job of maximizing the impact every donation has - in at least a few cases, the large size of the charity actually allows them to help people more efficiently due to economies of scale. Of course, it depends mostly on how competent their executive leadership is, and whether they're, y'know...corrupt assholes.

It's up to you whether you don't want to donate to any given charity - you're not a bad person if you don't want to, or don't have the money, or anything else - but there's plenty of avenues you can take to assuage skepticism or outright cynicism that every large charity is automatically corrupt, for those rare folks who use that as a rationalization to do nothing instead and tell themselves it's a good thing."

Common arguments are that homosexuality is a recent development in society (hilariously untrue) or that it doesn't ever happen with other animals (also patently false); they're incorrect arguments, but they're technically logical."

Hell, there's probably even one or two Nazis who don't agree with all the racist shit. Well...no, Nazis are just fucking assholes generally. Never mind."

That's what middle-aged people do, right?""

She didn't push back on my use of that term, and I think we both had simultaneous existential crises."

HumansAreMetal,fcnwgzk,t1_fcnsnh4,1577819829.0,"Seth Meyers has a bit in his Netflix standup special talking about his favorite memory of Kanye West as a guest on SNL. One of the sketches the writers pitched was Kanye interrupting an awards ceremony where somebody else had won, and insisting that he deserved it more. According to Seth, Kanye found it fucking hilarious.

""I'mma let you finish, but..."" happened in 2009.

That sketch was pitched in 2007."

lotrmemes,fcltts4,t3_ehr85i,1577756309.0,"I didn't ""get"" fandom until LOTR. I was a sophomore in high school when FOTR came out and it took me a crazy amount of time to see it; like 6 months after it came out.  I'd read the Hobbit when I was a kid but didn't really get it. I'd watched Star Wars when I was like 10 and thought they were good movies, but didn't understand at all why there was an entire convention industry of grown ass adults breathlessly excited over every single thing. Same with Star Trek, and the Harry Potter books/movies. 

But Fellowship? Fellowship fucked my shit *up.* I immediately read all 3 volumes in anticipation of Two Towers, and ended up driving 5 hours each way to go see the ""midnight"" premiere of ROTK at an AMC that was showing the extended editions of the first two movies (in a theater! A huge theater!) back to back before the ROTK premiere. I'll never forget that experience."

Also youngest brother, but only have one sibling, my sister, who's about 3 years older than me. We *fucking hated* each other growing up. We would physically fight until I turned like 11, at which point I was big enough that the fights weren't exactly balanced any more. 

I don't remember if there was a specific event that triggered it, but we seemed to spontaneously reach a mutual, unspoken agreement to only resort to emotional abuse shortly afterwards. Given that we lived together, it wasn't exactly hard for us to figure out each other's triggers. 

It got to the point where our ""fights"" were, in hindsight, super restrained in a pretty fucked up way; when we got upset, she would just calmly say a variation of, ""You're not actually smart and you're going to get kicked out of the advanced classes,"" to which I'd respond with some variation of, ""Okay, fatty,"" and then we'd both go to our rooms and cry for hours.

Ahhh childhood"
