changemyview,fctmmhy,t1_fctmc3s,1577949105.0,I did clarify control. Pretty much most countries new about Nukes but not about if there were any. Even we don’t know if the us has a weapon. If they did unlike China they wouldn’t  kill people and to the vast majority of people with new knowledge from the internet there will probably never be a leader that would use a super weapon irresponsibly due to the ramifications
changemyview,fctmgy0,t1_fctm93d,1577948912.0,"Survival is different from testing. I agree there is a leap but why is it not as immoral to kill a dog over a human. They both live, feel and have a personality and remember and care."
changemyview,fctmcq5,t1_fctm6zz,1577948767.0,Yet a lot of tech has been created via wars and they aren’t the only way but people aren’t willing to do anything unless it’s a problem they can easily understand and watch. That’s why flat earthers have risen because of lack of visual proof. It would be great if death didn’t fix things but yuno
changemyview,fctm5yo,t1_fctlywc,1577948535.0,"The world obviously would work together and from past wars have developed defences to stop these, I imagine they would collaborate and then using allowed weaponry not banned under the Geneva convention as an example to stop China."

changemyview,fctlcby,t1_fctl8le,1577947543.0,Make sure it isn’t too immoral by using sever gasses. Torture weapons like lasers etc don’t end the world
changemyview,fctlbdv,t1_fctl4zn,1577947511.0,I have answered the question for the UK AND US they were punished by themselves. Be specific on the coups what are they for.
changemyview,fctl93m,t1_fctku83,1577947434.0,The morality of exploiting someone for money is also bad same way the other way round. If you make money of some ones natural urges and them feeling left out because they could possibly be a virgin or sad without a SO it isn’t right to exploit them. Then if the prostitute is in debt or is struggling with money I see something wrong with selling your body to pay for it. Then their is possibilities of emotional trauma and physical trauma. What about this persons relationships. STDs still can be spread with regular check ups and people are also less likely to get prostitutes if they are illegal. Then you have teenagers who just became age to have sex wanting to do it quickly then exploiting a young mind for money.
changemyview,fctkz3a,t1_fctkt2s,1577947104.0,"But a person has to break the agreement and the one who did have been punished my god and as for Russia sadly but in terms of power the world right now can’t do much to stop Russia but if it threatened the world, the world would get much stronger to fight Russia"
changemyview,fctkpr8,t1_fctkn5u,1577946802.0,I totally agree but so far as I and you have presumably seen people don’t care unless it is something serious like war which is sad.
changemyview,fctkkqk,t1_fctkcww,1577946642.0,"Countries aren’t people, the people who broke them have been warned or punished. As for other countries we are trying to as we speak sadly some leaders aren’t as willing as most people on this subreddit."

changemyview,fctjwfn,t1_fctjo2e,1577945896.0,"But it is immoral and wrong to kill a sentient being which can laugh, feel sad and feel pain isn’t as bad as killing a human. I don’t see the logic if you are arguing morals of personality. Rats can be shy, outgoing and playful."

changemyview,fctjlei,t1_fctjher,1577945557.0,"So pain, and death are different for a human and a rat?
!delta on the other point though conscriptions are sad but needed and death is a sad part of these things"
changemyview,fctjio6,t1_fctjbeq,1577945474.0,"People who break the Geneva convention should be punished yes, I also based population growth on less wars and disease. Wars have been proven to kill people and stop spouses from having sex to make kids. Things have never been going well for millions. People are always oppressed in history not even from wars which is the subject"
changemyview,fctjdnr,t1_fctiy2e,1577945327.0,People in these wars usually aren’t forced to fight (I don’t mean global wars) they choose to for their country. Obviously having people die in these wars is sad but we do inhumane  tests on animals yet it’s for humanity
changemyview,fctj7c2,t1_fctixx7,1577945144.0,The population has never been constantly rising an example. Black Death caused a sudden decrease. My whole argument wasn’t about population increase. Statistically less people have been dying in this century and a sudden decrease in population would be a big war like ww1 ww2 which killed millions. I have answered your points.
changemyview,fctivx9,t3_eithpl,1577944819.0,I think it is good to argue about how logical a system is. If said system is poorly made or thought out then it should be changed. It also brings up a great discussion that should be thought about by historians.

changemyview,fctiidf,t1_fcthx6n,1577944438.0,Hmm than why has the world become more peaceful and has had a huge population rise rather than decrease?
changemyview,fctifsb,t1_fcthwol,1577944363.0,"Yes it would be great if people did these things but people don’t, war gives a purpose to lazy people who don’t care. An example is climate change. Until it became serious and people suffered nothing changed. And even now people still aren’t changing. War does bring people together.
People fight for others and freedom of it. People send aid and hospitalised the refugees. Politicians such as the uk have been forced to better the military and new ways to help save people can be discovered. Sadly people won’t stand up unless there is a good reason they can visibly see and think easily about."
changemyview,fcti7hf,t1_fcthwgn,1577944134.0,"!delta but most leaders aren’t stupid enough to nuke a country to oblivion, North Korea is an example as they threatened so hard yet caused nothing. And as a threat of nukes what did humanity do, we made even better defence systems. Conflicts can be controlled humans just need to find a way too. It has been done before. If my memory is working there was a whole day in one of the world wars where no one fought."

changemyview,fcthmbh,t1_fcth9wl,1577943563.0,"As I said the Geneva convention is a kind of ground rule. It is stupid if it is broken. It obviously can be further broken but there has been less deaths that are immoral or without reason because of it. Also I do agree minor wars are happening and my post is stating that these should keep happening just with absolutely less deaths. The strain on the uk from Syria had caused it too buckle up and put a foot down and make rules for immigration, improve the military and make people think. Of course the People who are civilians who die in these wars should not It doesn’t stop the fact these are helping."
changemyview,fcth1dd,t1_fctgqv8,1577943017.0,I don’t see the need to name a time where a war has not happened as there is no need. The Geneva convention is a ground rule for things. Of course tyrannical leaders won’t follow them but smart leaders like the modern day ones do causing casualties to be lower also defence systems from possible wars from countries without rules has caused The effectiveness to be increased dramatically.
changemyview,fctgsov,t3_eist9r,1577942792.0,"Prostitution comes with many health risks and can cause stds to become an even worse problem by creating a market where sex without protection is easy to get and legal.

Go out meet people even if it’s awkward it is something to do and memories too look on. People can be really caring.
