HumansBeingBros,fez0skg,t1_feszhbn,1579452861.0,Yes... Especially since this quilt thing is a fad. I've seen a bunch of similar videos. Lovely gesture but it feels less genuine when you film it for the internet points.

Maybe prisoner would be a better word."

nonononoyes,fdkae4a,t1_fd1ubq7,1578499680.0,"When I was 7 a big dog off its leash came running at me and my friend. She froze in place and I started running in circles. So naturally, it started chasing me and I could feel it trying to bite me on my back. I yelled for my friend to run away cause I had it distracted but she wouldn't move and looked super scared. After a while the owner got her dog to stop and she didn't even say sorry. Later that day my friend smugly told me that you are supposed to stay still when dogs run at you. While I learned something that day, I knew that the only reason she hadn't run was because she was frozen with fear. Dunno why I wrote this but I just hate that memory xD"
