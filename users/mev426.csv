deaf,feggmtv,t3_ep1oht,1579092116.0,"Yes, there are a lot of hearing aids that don’t plug up the ear canal. Also, any hearing aid you get from an audiologist will be programmed directly to his hearing loss and they don’t amplify above a certain volume, so they won’t damage the hearing further. 

Your first step is to make an appointment with an audiologist and get a hearing test done. They can then direct you with next steps."
service_dogs,fefemtt,t3_eoujqn,1579054694.0,"I have a small (48lb) lab and have flown with her 4 times now. First time we were in bulkhead and it was awful. There was *less* floor space than the other seats. After that, made sure to sit in the normal seats and we had so much more space! Didn’t have any issues with the airlines about flying with her, she fits great at my feet. I also know people with larger labs that still tuck under the seat perfectly fine. 

I found that I hyped up flying more than I needed to. It didn’t feel that much different than everyday life with my SD."

service_dogs,fdjz1tw,t1_fdjlxf9,1578491869.0,"I don’t always take my service dog with me either, there are a few times I’ll go without her. 

Going off of your wheelchair example: think of it this way, some people are non-ambulatory and require a wheelchair at all times. Other people have difficulty walking for long periods of time, so they may use a wheelchair some times and other times use a walker, cane, or help of another human. Just because someone uses a wheelchair doesn’t mean they use it all the time. 

Even a blind person with a guide dog will leave the dog behind some days and use their cane instead. There could be many reasons to go without the dog for a little while: the dog is sick, the dog just had a medical procedure, the place the handler is going isn’t the safest place for the dog to go, or, maybe the dog just needs a day off. There are many other reasons as well. We can’t expect dogs to work 24/7/365, they’re not robots."
service_dogs,fdilym1,t3_ell2d5,1578445862.0,"You need the Fair Housing Act, not the ADA. ADA only covers places that serve the public, not private dwellings. There are also a few ways that they may be exempt from the FHA, so I would read up on that law before talking to them again. 

Also, under the FHA you need to request reasonable accommodation in writing and get it approved in writing **before** you can bring the dog on the property. It is quite different than ADA. If your disability is not readily apparent, or your disability-related need for the dog is not readily apparent, they also may ask for documentation (doctor’s note, etc.) explaining that you have a disability and how a dog would help you.

Edit: [Here](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/19ServiceAnimalNoticeFHEO_508.pdf) is a PDF explaining the laws surrounding assistance animals in housing. Under the Fair Housing Act, both emotional support animals and service dogs are grouped together under the umbrella term of “assistance animal”.

Edit 2: What I have done in the past is print out the above PDF, highlighted the sections pertaining to my request, and attached that and a doctor’s note to my letter requesting accommodation. I would also recommend putting in your letter something along the lines of “I look forward to your response in the next 10 business days or by XX date”. This gives them time to talk to a lawyer, etc if they need to but also ensures that they respond to you within a reasonable amount of time. [Here’s](https://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/303) an example template of what a letter from your doctor could look like.

[Here’s](https://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/261) an example of what a letter requesting reasonable accommodation could look like, you would just need to alter it to say SDiT instead of ESA."

Plaque requires bacteria, carbohydrates, food particles and saliva to survive. Remember, plaque is the film that develops over the teeth which can turn into tartar around the gum line. *This is why greenies, whimzees, dentastix and milk bones will never do the trick and can in fact exacerbate the build up* — they contain loads of carbohydrates (sugar and starch)! Bacteria that live in the mouth LITERALLY thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel resulting in tooth decay."

deaf,fcin7vo,t3_ehduox,1577665399.0,"Another option instead of an interpreter is a transcriber (CART) - I’ve used both during different semesters / for different classes and they both have their benefits. If you have something similar to the Roger pen, you could have the professors wear that, as well (it’s a wireless microphone they wear that streams their voice to your HAs). 

If you plan on taking a foreign language, I took my Spanish exams in the testing center so that I could have the oral portion read to me in-person in a small, quiet room. I was able to lip read and hear her fairly well in that environment. The way the class was set up, the oral portion (listening to a story passage to text listening comprehension) was normally played over speakers in the classroom then we had to answer questions. You can imagine how that went."
