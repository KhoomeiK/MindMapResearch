PrequelMemes,fewkbv4,t1_fewiq2j,1579412519.0,"

That end goal makes sense but the overall plan process doesn't. Last time they fought anakin and obi were dummied by dooko. No doubt they learned from that but assuming another fight between anakin dooko obi results in only anakin living is one hell of a stretch, and given the overall space battle conditions and the involvement of grievous the most likely outcome is all of them dying.

And on that note why would the senate assume the jedi council would send anakin and obi at all, and only them to boot? What if they sent 10 squid jedi and mace windu instead? Like I said I love the movie for what they are but they do not hold up to in-depth analysis or even common sense. Thats actually a big factor in why i like them so much. I like anomalies. The new movies are textbook and suck imo.

The originals are memorable because they were... Well, original. Textbook, but unique. Ground breaking. The prequels are memorable because they are a combination of amazing effects, acting, soundtracks, and a nonsensical ridiculous plot with hilariously unrealalistic dialog, all based on a rich and built up history. Never before have such films been created. They are unique and revolutionary art in their own right. If lucas had made good films they would be less memorable imo. I can quote the prequels far more than say lord of the rings."
PrequelMemes,few8a19,t1_few7ir8,1579406801.0,"It was his end game goal to convert anakin, he cultivated it for years, and he realized the key was using padme... So I disagree. He would have wanted her dead after anakin became loyal, but not before. Sort of proven at the end when she is in senate and he takes total power and she manages to leave uneventfully when hes masacreing jedi directly outside. At that point, he could have killed her if he wanted and didn't even bother. All the assassination attempts were to cause drama and foster his control over anakin. Imo anyways. The writing is pretty bad so ambiguity is inevitable. There isn't really a right answer because the plot doesn't make sense. But that's my take anyways."

Makes more sense then his plan to be intentionally kidnapped by general grevious and then have anakin kill dooko and then escape a space battle for seemingly no purpose aside from an exciting opening scene. These movies make absolutely no sense. I love them so much."
