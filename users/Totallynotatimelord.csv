Purdue,fet54dz,t3_eqjt6t,1579371882.0,"In your first year you likely won't take any nuclear courses, unless you have a lot of credit (through AP, IB, or testing out). That will come after you transition to your major (T2M) at the end of the second semester of your freshman year. 

Someone in Nuke will have to speak to the specifics of your second, third, and fourth years, but in general it's a relatively small major which can make it nice for making connections with peers / professors."

Also, during you first year engineering curriculum, you will get familiar with all the different schools of engineering offered here. By the end of the year when it's time to choose your discipline, you may have decided you want to do another instead of aero."
