bigboobproblems,ff6xi2s,t1_ff6pfql,1579636915.0,"I don’t mind my saggy boobs when I’m naked. You can tell they’re boobs and you can still see that I have a waist. At 30H they aren’t THAT big. 

But once I put a shirt on it just looks like I have these weird lumps near where my waist should be and the silhouette of the shirt is ruined."
science,ff6ayw2,t1_ff635un,1579623222.0,"Sure, ok, the insulin makes you immediately store what you ate as fat. Then you go walk for an hour. So now you have to burn the fat you just made. Either way the equation will balance. 

Exercise and weight loss both increase insulin sensitivity and work to even out blood sugar and insulin levels. 

If you use the calories you eat you’re good."
fatlogic,ff5agea,t3_ern4q3,1579585195.0,"You could drag a 400lb sled across Antarctica — you can only carry 7000 kCals/day, but you’d burn 10,000 kCals/day. Bam! 20lbs gone in 28 days. 

(I can’t figure out how to link to the guy’s recent AMA.)

Edit— a letter."
fatlogic,ff59xu9,t1_ff59ca1,1579584702.0,Spontaneous human combustion. Or pretty close to it. The energy has to go somewhere. If you don’t turn the excess into fat it just becomes heat.  You won’t be cold.
BarefootRunning,fepb74f,t3_eq5w38,1579316280.0,I still buy my original Merrell Pace Gloves on eBay for between $20 and $40. I prefer them to any of the newer models and they seem to have usually been barely worn because “they have no support!!!”
fatlogic,fenlr59,t1_femvoj2,1579287396.0,"Actually it is:

Here it is overlay on a pic of me at 5’3.5” and 173. It gets my torso almost exactly. And I had a 38” waist.

fatlogic,fenc9ee,t1_fenai8m,1579281597.0,"Unfortunately, they are cropped out of the original image. 

And, even at my heaviest, I had very slim calves.  In fact, I think with all the running and lifting my calves are the same or even a bit thicker than they were before I lost the 55lbs."
fatlogic,fen62al,t3_eq0je2,1579277772.0,"It looks right to me. 

Here it is over an image of me at 5’3.5” and 173. It gets my torso almost perfect.

I also had a 38” waist. 

And often I didn’t think I looked that bad."

fatlogic,fecrxh2,t1_fecf8hs,1578982310.0,"Again, too lazy to find the link, but there’s a doc who wrote about how he’d rather have HIV than T2D. The HIV is easier to manage."
fatlogic,fecrrwh,t1_fec7loo,1578982152.0,"I’ll have to find the link but a recent study directly links T2D with excess fat in the liver.  As long as you actually use the sugar you eat, you’re fine."
fatlogic,fe6jemb,t1_fe6c7q1,1578892824.0,Totally. I had a very fat cat for my college A&P class. It was a nightmare. My scalpel kept slipping and I almost sliced myself daily. I couldn’t see anything. It was so gross. They wouldn’t let me have a different one.
explainlikeimfive,fdlgdob,t1_fdkvk0z,1578523445.0,This needs to be higher up!  We (5’3” 120lb women) also burn fewer calories per mile running.
explainlikeimfive,fdl7sra,t1_fdkz1ki,1578518505.0,"Slightly, yes. It’s hypothesized as a factor to explain why obesity is more prevalent in the southern US than in the north."

fatlogic,favg45y,t1_favdmmr,1576358524.0,"The range for “Healthy Weight” accounts for most of that.  Most docs won’t quibble about a BMI of 26 or 18 other than to keep an eye on it. Most of the complainers seem to have BMIs well north of 35, so no, it accurately indicates excess fat at that point. Yes, even for power lifters."
