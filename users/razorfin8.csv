dankmemes,femyzh9,t1_femygxc,1579273195.0,"Didn't say nuclear was renewable, said it was the most renewable.  Nuclear creates substantially less waste then many other types of energy.  Not only that one plant, while taking up a massive space can produce a lot more power then the same relative size of solar, distributed or commercial."
dankmemes,femxwfq,t1_fempapj,1579272450.0,"Solar is actually pretty bad for the environment.  Apart from taking up massive areas of land, which means destroying wildlife habitats, making them and recycling bad ones takes quite a bit of power itself.  Not only that but the battery cells used to collect the power are insanely harmful to the environment.  Nuclear is the cleanest and most renewable green energy atm"

The100,fdm1hns,t1_fc3cdwy,1578537570.0,"Exactly, Kane and Abby share atrocious deeds but Kane accepts himself and tries to make up for it.  While Abby is selfish.  It really turned me off of her when, as a doctor, she was the one that recommended cannibalism and then advised to make it law so that starvation would not destroy the ""crop"".  IMO it was Abby that ruined Octavia while in the bunker."
