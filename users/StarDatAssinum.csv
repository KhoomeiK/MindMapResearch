I can see why it comes off as phony, but I think it’s just a different way of responding to the camera. Any corniness in his part seems to just be him, or as a result of supporting Stassi.

One bridesmaid couldn’t go because it wasn’t in her finances, and we were all totally fine with it. It’s on whomever doesn’t want to go to speak up.

That aside, I would think again on this living situation. I would in no way be comfortable shilling out half the mortgage for a property that is not in my name (and please correct me if I’m off-base in that) and living with people, even family, treating me this way."
