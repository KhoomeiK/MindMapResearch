relationship_advice,fcs1gyy,t1_fcrzxot,1577909963.0," i obviously didnt write everything that was said between us after splitting. Didnt think it was necessary.

But considering about 2 months ago he told me he wanted to be able to talk to me more but he didn't want to complicate things with his new partner (now ex) says otherwise... I dont feel as though i over read into anything."
relationship_advice,fcrqv15,t1_fcrpq01,1577905393.0,"No reason to apologize, you are right in some way. 

Being together would be more than what i want. We were a good support to one another, even after breaking up. We were best friends. We appreciated our friendship over anything else. It just feels weird not being able to talk to someone who i talked to about literally anything."

dogs,fcn2jwc,t1_fcn1dva,1577801472.0,"I can respect that. My point on this is literally ANY breed can be a family dog, smart, friendly, and animal friendly. To discriminate against a dog because of its breed is not fair. 

People please educate yourselves. If you wanna make generalizations against dogs being aggressive, then please do your research. Labrador Retrievers are actually in the top 3 groups known for being ""dangerous and aggressive"" 

lookup dog bite statistics (there is a page for this)

dogs,fcn1rat,t1_fcn1d1l,1577800791.0,"Never said anything about the breeding of the dogs. Its how WE train them. Im done here. Y'all obviously aren't capable of getting the bigger picture, its the owners/humans that are the problem. Not the breed of the dog.
You clearly haven't owned many dogs in your life. Or maybe you have, you just didnt show them live as if they were your own family. Cause trust me, love/nurture REALLY DOES make a difference in how an animal behaves.

RESEARCH. https://www.pitbullinfo.org/pit-bulls-myths-and-facts.html"
dogs,fcn0btd,t1_fcmzvuc,1577799506.0,"If you're trying to tell me it's in a pitbulls nature to attack then you won't get far. I've owned both pitbulls and a number of herding breeds throughout my life. 

Have you owned any of these dogs personally or are you just generalizing? Not all border collies or Blue Heelers herd animals, some are lazy. Not all retrievers will retrieve things, some will do what they please with given object. And not all pitbulls are aggressive, most want to cuddle and be your big baby. We as humans, their owners, have the power to train our dogs to do just about anything. Like i said, it's the owner not the dogs. I've personally witnessed more German Sheppards show any sort of aggression than any dog. And i wonder why that is... hmmmm maybe cause WE train them to be attack dogs.

Could go around and make similar generalizations about humans too. Just doesnt make sense to do so when there is so much variation. 
So to answer your question, yes i totally believe that nuturing an animal makes all the difference."
dogs,fcmz3pe,t1_fcmxmnp,1577798310.0,Just here to simply put it. Anyone who blames the dogs instead of the people who TAUGHT the dogs are extremely ignorant. Pitbulls are some of the most loving/loyal dogs I've ever been around. Try working at a doggy daycare and tell me that pitbulls are the mean ones...
