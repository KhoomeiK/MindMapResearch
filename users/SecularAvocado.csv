Documentaries,fc6mf1s,t1_fc5yxpl,1577484023.0,"Well, saying many issues was probably a stretch. On Israel-Palestine, I will never support a two state solution where a Palestinian state resembles anything close to the current Palestinian authority (or Hamas for that matter). It is filled with antidemocratic values and would most likely pose a serious security threat to the state of Israel. If you think Palestine wouldn't collapse into civil war, you're na√Øve or disingenuous. It is a society very much poisoned by corruption and anti-Semitism. Not that I know how to fix that mess.

Edit: He's portraying the entire issue the wrong way around. Speaking of ""non-violent Palestinian resistance"" (good joke btw, I know it exists, but its influence is miniscule) and comparing Gaza to the Warsaw Ghetto. It makes me sick. Gazans (Hamas) literally fly swastikas at the border to Israel. They shoot rockets, want to kill the yahoods (nani? I thought they're anti-zionist, not anti-Semitic. How can that be?!) Gimme a fucking break Noam."
