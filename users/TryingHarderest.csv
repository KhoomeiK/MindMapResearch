languagelearning,ff8sclc,t1_ff8ktlk,1579694199.0,Its not asking for help if you are just communicating which is the execution of practice. If you don’t ask for anything and just communicate with them then they are doing you no other favor than maybe speaking slower if you don’t understand what their saying as long as they are willing to talk with you.
languagelearning,ff84ypo,t1_ff77fwt,1579666123.0,This is a great supplement to what I was trying to get at. And it appears that you get the idea that it is best to adjust your tactics based on the situation as well. That is the important part. And Machiavellian is what I would consider the most relatable to the theme of this post in reality.

languagelearning,ff6hm3p,t1_ff6e0co,1579627381.0,This will vary by country and culture.
languagelearning,ff5xu51,t1_ff5r3g2,1579613788.0,I’m not saying that anyone is supposed to speak to you In any language just because you bought a plane ticket. I’m saying that you bought the ticket so that you could go to a different country and speak and improve your skills in that country’s language. This mindset is more about holding yourself accountable to your goal. The point of the original post was to articulate a problem and propose a non-confrontational way to ensure that the only alternative for communication with you is your target language. Entitlement says that they have to make you happy and the other way around it says that you have to make them happy. It really all comes down to looking after yourself and taking what you want from experiences and how you deal with annoyances.
languagelearning,ff5lppf,t1_ff4qltr,1579599052.0,"That seems to be the current dynamic with people who are highly experienced in another person’s language. Still, I feel like using English with someone just because they are foreign can inhibit that person’s objectives from being fully realized. Any English usage is hardly going to get you there jf you’re searching for real depth."
languagelearning,ff5ljky,t1_ff544vl,1579598789.0,"This method is to be used with discretion. Most small interactions won’t amount to much and it wouldn’t really have that much of an effect on the person either way whether they found out or not. I’m not even talking about making friends, a lot of people prefer to be friends with people they can readily communicate with. I’m talking about becoming a person that they can readily communicate with by using a method to negate any rational excuse to revert to English for either of you. This method in a conversation is just going to be a detail and so are you in in that person’s life anyway. 

Im sure not all of us here are 100% honest with strangers for reasons of personal convenience anyway. This is just another thing to consider using in those cases when you don’t want to use English at all, period. It would also behoove you to be otherwise cordial and entertaining, even if you “don’t know English,” which should be the selling point in any “friendship” in the first place, so that you can be sure that you provide more value to the other person in the long run. 

But as I said before, use this methods in situations where you feel it is best suited. And don’t be stupid and tall to one person in English and then say you don’t speak it to someone standing right next to you. But sometimes traveling in a small group or solo you are anonymous and you can be whoever you want to be for a day. At the end of the day, world is big and inconsequential."
languagelearning,ff5l3xc,t1_ff5bci5,1579598128.0,"You can evaluate whether or not you want to use this method anyway, because most people you meet won’t want to be your friend just because you speak their language. In fact, if they are talking to you now, it is possibly because it is convenient for them and you’re standing right there. Start friendships how you like, but small interactions don’t count for much, and every person you meet isn’t going to want to keep in touch with you. Besides, you can’t expect these people to be completely honest with you either, you are both strangers and more times than not you will remain strangers. Use this method at your own risk, but you can always reveal that you speak English in case you feel like it and either tell them why you don’t let people know you speak English or make up your own story. The former will be more believable though."
languagelearning,ff5kti1,t1_ff5bib2,1579597696.0,"Because then it becomes viable for the other person to switch back to English to communicate when that  may not be what you are looking for it’s not a crime not to be completely honest and clear with someone at any given point in time. This is more of a subtle method.

Besides if you want to exert all of that energy that you could be spending on making the most of your skills in conversation on begging someone not to use English with you, which a lot of people won’t muster the kahoonies to do, that’s your choice. This is a thought experiment for those who might want to negate any viability for its use at the get-go."
languagelearning,ff5kl6b,t1_ff5amy1,1579597363.0,"Yeah, but you’re not in vacation to immerse yourself in the role of playing a personal tutor. Everyone needs to stop dwelling on the reciprocity of these interactions because primarily with the people that love “practice” you will spend more time hoping that they don’t revert to English than not. 

Another thing that I fear Is the possibility if a “deal” ending up in the other person intentionally talking too fast or too colloquially for you to understand so that you’re the one who reverts to English. 

Besides, finding the best deal on an airline ticket might be the only kind of “negotiation” that you might have the energy for by the time you’re actually there. 

If people stopped looking at language learning with this politically correct and optimistic view of reciprocity and started to consider the reality of the world we live in, we would be able to create a much hardier community that can follow through with our language commitments. This method’s purpose is to reduce the energy needed for confrontation and to negate the viability for any conversations to revert to English."

languagelearning,ff5k4iw,t1_ff4hz7b,1579596691.0,"Its not free if you pay travel to their country. Its completely normal to speak the official language of the country that you are in with the local people, but its borderline manipulative to expect free practice from expats on vacation who are investing in their ability to connect with the local culture. 

This method also prevents the innate temptation for non-manipulative  people, who just want to be accommodating, to revert to English, and another posts here have implied, make sure you know the other language well enough in case they want to use a translator, which imo is a clunky and low effort means of human interaction.

Use this method at your own discretion and reconsider the advantages of using or not using with everyone you meet during your stay."
languagelearning,ff5jsmd,t1_ff5jc6g,1579596223.0,"Its not entitlement its a mindset so that you don’t cave into practicing English with someone and not actually learning their language, which  is in my opinion the best way to learn. Another thing is that I don’t think it is useful to go to a country  without already having a decent level. This post is more of a thought experiment as an option to completely negate the interlocutor’s temptation to immediately revert to using English. Another thing is that entitlement would be expecting people to want to talk to you in the first place. Their end of the conversation is voluntary to begin with, but your limited time in a country is valuable so sometimes it may be in your best interest to experiment and seek out conversations with people who don’t mind your mediocre (but not poor) skills in their language. This is just one method to transition the conversation into a complete no English state. Spend your travel money how you like, but I know I don’t want to be someone’s foreign English teacher when I’m actually trying to connect with the local culture."

I got a little sidetracked with the whole idea of the person using you for practice, but of course, this is just a suggestion for how to avoid interactions like this. 

Also if you approach someone who speaks the language that you are trying to learn, if you are trying to get an explanation in *that* language them knowing that you know English will make it too tempting for them to switch to English. 

I also recommend using English only if you really need it. Also learn about the culture ahead of time."

seduction,fed1dod,t1_ewau9vq,1578993794.0,Yeah and another thing: I read that it is more rare to find a woman who is attracted to people their own age anyway. A decade or more of good experiences would definitely be more interesting to a woman than being in a similar place in life. I feel like if it is harder for her to empathize with what you live like day to day then it will be much more interesting for her to get to know you if you’ve got everything else together.

Therefore, instead of being paid for doing work that adds absolutely no value to someone else’s  life, (and if that was the case, who would be paying you anyway?) then there is no reason to expect any kind of financial compensation. 

And no, the surgeon spent 8-10 years of his life perfecting a skill which can potentially give that person decades to live, who valued the surgeon at that price.

Anarchy101,fe0659n,t1_fdz311s,1578804027.0,"Creating a justice system implies a policy under which coercion must take place in order to enforce the deliverance of the prescribed punishment. As it is, we have trouble evaluating the seriousness of a crime already, so I suggest the best resolution is to allow a person's closest circle decide how to not punish, but to **respond** to the actions of another. A punishment may be their decision, and it may be more or less severe, but they should remember that anything that they do to another, no matter how justifiable, is not in itself insulated from a counter response. With this in mind, the simple fact of having others around to mediate the feelings of a victim, which would naturally be present if he/she lives in a community, would produce a proportional enough response to the wrong-doing which was committed against another. The main point of all this is to allow people to naturally settle things and mediate them in order to maintain the ideal of non-coercion, because we know that the biggest crimes come out of the systems that the act of trying to contain natural human behavior produces."

Anarcho-capitalism should be considered more, at least for its value in transitioning away from the commonplace acceptance of impunible entities which hold a limitless monopoly on power."
Anarchy101,fe04kal,t1_fdxjjwz,1578802908.0,"I'll break this response into three parts and a conclusion:

**The Problem with Any ""Policy"":**

How would you enforce these policies? Any kind of ""organization"" implies a hierarchy of some kind, which I personally don't have a problem with, but others definitely will deem ironic or hypocritical. Organizing hierarchically and imposing policies will also easily become a weak point which will be analyzed from opponents.

This situation poses a unique problem, wherein in order to allow for freedom of organization among individuals, every aspect, good and downright malicious should not be suspended by any written doctrine that is based on superficial beliefs. Or one that punishes those who harbor hateful beliefs. 

A policy of any kind implies that measures will be taken against an offender in the instance that their free will as a person goes against the group's ideals. Sort of like an oppressive government. 

**An Alternative:**

A suggestion to the contrary that may be a little more productive could be to allow the dynamic of the group and the social pressures that naturally exist within the group determine the behavior and set the boundaries for acceptable rhetoric. 

**Troubleshooting:**

Here is a con to this which will have to be understood: people with diverging opinions will eventually find like-minded people to group up with in a kind of a clique. These people may not be on the same page about ""tolerance"" as the rest of the members of the organization. 

The solution to this could be to market the movement as being inclusive and a friendly environment for all kinds of people. This can be done in many ways, i.e. featuring diversity on banners, asking people from diverse backgrounds to speak about their experiences, etc. 

\- This will most likely ward off people who do not share core beliefs with the movement such as diversity and inclusiveness.

Another thing that can regulate attitudes within the organization is to allow stigmas to form around hateful speech and allow people who do not wish to associate with the speech alienate themselves through others naturally choosing not to be around them. Hate will never cease to exist, and grudges may form, but oppressing even them constitutes an oppressive power, let them face rejection naturally from those who they may try to oppress themselves, and don't encourage whiners or tattletales either.

**In Conclusion:**

Considering how to encourage tolerance instead of coercing tolerance is a much better way of vetting the most appropriate candidates for membership in your organization. After all, at the most fundamental part of this movement is to eliminate the need for an oppressive power that makes sure that we do things that we are already completely capable of, deciding what is right and wrong."

Another important thing to consider is the function that money has in society; it has three main functions: to store value, to act as a medium of exchange and to measure value among possibly others too. So money is a tool which allows for you to purchase something from someone in exchange for a currency which can be used to buy something else from someone else. The big idea with  money is that instead of finding someone who has what you want and wants what you have as in the system of bartering, you can use the money to transfer value to someone that you would otherwise be unable to barter with."
