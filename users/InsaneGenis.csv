No. It’s because he needs to know who was involved in case there is any report about him.  You know say this shit goes viral or something and people start making false reports about the officer as if they were one of those people.   

Any investigation of any kind a cop has to make his best attempt to document those involved so it’s filed away. For example let’s say that lady isn’t done. A few months later she shows up and shoots that guy and she gets away. 

Now you’ve got a murder and if he never linked this event to that woman no one would ever be able to link the crime."
