Getting the brain to detox from sugar is the hard part, but after I did that my desire for munchies diminished. 

The shit they sell us in the stores is filled with terrible things. Dietary policy isn't scientifically based. Ancel Keys wanted to be so badly that his ego wouldn't accept evidence contrary to his opinion.

The list of diseases caused by sugar are too long to list here but include diseases of the cardiac, nervous system, endocrine system, skeletal and muscular systems. Sugar feeds cancer cells using your own insulin. Many diseases are driven by excess insulin in the body. Stopping the substances causing harm and damage is the only intelligent move.

I might also suggest Dr Ken Berry in this podcast -  Fundamental Health with Paul Saladino,  MD: Lies You've Been Told By Your Doctor  https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXVsc2FsYWRpbm9tZC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw&episode=YWY1YjgwNTQ0MDU4NGI5MzljNjAzMzNkMmVjZDQ0YjI  He has a great way of putting the sugar issue so you can realize you are being poisoned. Sugar is killing us and society is brainwashed to think it's okay to consume.

I honestly cannot hand out halloween candy to children any more. I understand how bad sugar is for the body and I will never eat it again. You need to make the decision for yourself, but do it with all the information you can get."

Aphantasia,fb9jk4b,t3_ec69q5,1576640301.0,"From the case report:

Background and aims: Aphantasia (‚Äúblind imagination‚Äù) is a poorly described condition with an uncertain etiology,
characterized by reduced or lack of voluntary visual imagery. Preliminary evidence in humans suggests that
hallucinogenic or psychedelic drugs that act as agonists of cortical 5-HT2A receptors [lysergic acid diethylamide,
psilocybin, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT)] enhance visual imagery. Methods: Interview and description of the
case are presented in this study. Results: A man self-diagnosed with long-lasting aphantasia that he attributed to a
traumatic separation from his father when he was young and to a difficult relationship with him described sustained
improvements in his visual imagery following ingestion of a single dose of the South American botanical hallucinogen
ayahuasca, which is rich in DMT. Although improvements were modest, they were sustained and significative for the
subject. Conclusions: It is suggested that the described improvements were possibly attributed to biological and
psychological processes, including stimulation of cortical 5-HT2A receptors, subsequent increased activity in the visual
cortex, enhanced imaginative and imagery capacities, and psychosomatic resolution of a previous psychological trauma.
Further trials could elucidate the role of 5-HT2A agonists, especially ayahuasca, in aphantasia."
