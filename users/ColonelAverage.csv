Nor how much value you add to society/the company, nor the experience you have, nor qualifications you have/qualifications stated as being required for the job. I'm not sure if that is an issue elsewhere."
todayilearned,ff8iyem,t1_ff8fj4b,1579680626.0,"Oh, we still have that in the US. At least in my area, each city/county raises taxes for these services that charge outrageous fees anyway. The companies double/triple/quadruple dip from the tax payers, patients, etc.

The worst part is that it doesn't even go into those heros' wages either; it gets funneled right into the corporation's pockets. What never gets mentioned when people say that the Uber will be ~1/100 the price is that the Uber driver will probably make roughly the same amount of money from the ride that the EMTs would."
WTF,feni382,t1_fen7xqy,1579285164.0,It's crazy how many people in this thread are apparently unaware that planes are able to change their altitude.
todayilearned,felepyo,t1_felcz9z,1579220431.0,"I looked into it and they are right; the rich can't buy them outright at least in the US, but they are able to do things like see doctors in multiple transplant regions. They can also get problems detected earlier and get better treatment while they are waiting, so those help them be higher on the list while not dying/being ineligible before it's their turn."
todayilearned,fel6nnf,t1_fekv48g,1579215201.0,"Uhhhh, does that happen everywhere else? I wouldn't be surprised to hear that this happens in some or even a lot of places. I doubt it is happening even in most other countries, let alone all of them..."
SandersForPresident,fehgskl,t3_ep417s,1579116227.0,"Damn, sounds a lot like CNN is the only one around here saying a woman couldn't be president."
JusticeServed,feh9z8v,t1_fegujir,1579112231.0,"It could be both. In fact, I would imagine being a sick fuck is a prerequisite for being in a gang that poisons people's pets to sell as meat."
cursedcomments,feebgb0,t1_fedvhxq,1579030316.0,"There's repair procedure that cover just about everything. There's countless ways for each of the thousands/millions of components on an aircraft to be ""non-conforming"". From paint needing touch-up to a tech accidentally puncturing the fuselage with the forks of a forklift. The damage and proposed repair procedure are dispositioned by applicable parties and experts.

Obviously the fuselages aren't the total cost, but when the sticker price of a new plane is hundreds of millions of dollars and sometimes years of lead time there's a large budget for engineering, material, and repair to rework a damaged plane to working condition."
IdiotsInCars,fecxbxb,t1_fe9s616,1578988395.0,"Right? I was behind someone as we were approaching a red light. Just before we reached it he let off his brakes and went right through the intersection and nailed another car. He insisted that he had a green, and judging by his actions I think his mind filled in the light as being green and he honestly believed it. I wouldn't be surprised if he still believes that it was green and that the other drivers and witnesses were just out to get him.

Not everything is an insurance scam like many of the other comments suggest."
interestingasfuck,fc339e1,t1_fc32qno,1577380414.0,You have found the answer much more efficiently than I did.
interestingasfuck,fc329dq,t1_fc2cuw5,1577379785.0,"Right? I even tried looking it up before and googling things like ""how do manual transmissions work"" seemed to only yield information specifically about the clutch."
todayilearned,fbe72p0,t1_fbe1d7h,1576779659.0,"I'm not sure what you'd consider to be ""cleaning"" the pipes, but they absolutely flush the systems with sanitizing solution periodically. It is true that they probably never replace or mechanically clean the piping unless it is part of a retrofitment or repair process.

Out of curiosity, when was the last time you cleaned the piping in your home? Mechanically or with a sanitizing solution?"
