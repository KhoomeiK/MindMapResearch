TheHague,fe7u9uu,t1_fe7j0h5,1578919331.0,But the difference now is the height. They added a small ramp but removed the color markings. I think those combined can be enough. But the whole cycling routes to the station design is bad. Too much overlap with pedestrians on the whole.
TheHague,fe7g5b9,t1_fe7cu3v,1578914217.0,I got squeaky breaks. That helps
TheHague,fe7fzd2,t1_fe6tdmc,1578914152.0,This is the only solution that will work. Paint it red and add white bicycle logos on the ground. It's basically the only easy road for cyclists going to the central station from the south.
todayilearned,fdnezyj,t1_fdn9kgn,1578584395.0,And that is a good measure of labeling someone evil. Once they start dehumanizing groups of people. Thats how they destroy the empathy for others.
todayilearned,fdmonpw,t1_fdmkweh,1578558290.0, I've read a remark from a Nuremberg psychologist and the clearest common denominator between most nazi's was a lack of empathy. A complete lack of being able to imagine yourself in the shoes of another.
teslamotors,fdjnj0e,t1_fdjjgix,1578479537.0,"Show me any frontman of another car company. Tesla is musk. If he'd ever quit or is pushed out or whatever. Thats when you know the true value. Arguably it's quite allot, but musk adds mostly to the stock prize i think."
videography,fdjn06z,t1_fdit0wy,1578478787.0,The timecode thing is also good for revisions. So that way you're not obviously locking the file for the client but you have a reason other than trust issues
AskTrumpSupporters,fd2vcva,t1_fd2gbiu,1578151976.0,Trump has basically given that designation himself with opposition from his own advisors. It's not a international set of qualifications you can make. But if you go by that standard the US could be classified as a terrorist state?
AskTrumpSupporters,fd2eytp,t1_fd29s6c,1578146251.0,Is the entire country of Iran a terrorist cell?
AskTrumpSupporters,fcyvdnx,t1_fcyv4pw,1578087903.0,Perhaps a one on one retaliation? Perhaps assassinate the head of the secret service when he's in Canada?
netflix,fctlq9b,t1_fctfyiy,1577948005.0,I first thought the character was super annoying during that introduction. After a few more scenes i started to become a fan of the actor and binged everything of him on YouTube. Id recommend the toast of London too. Nearly peed myself
ukpolitics,fcn2bkw,t1_fcn25uo,1577801280.0,If that 15 or 20 minutes is so important. Just add one hour a week somewhere.

videography,fbkgwnq,t3_edshxk,1576950155.0,I've seen gaffers use modified c-clamps (like for woodworking) but with a spigot attachment welded on. And an extra metal wire around the rafter for safety.
