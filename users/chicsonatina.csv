college,ff3m8ce,t1_ff3g44w,1579544046.0,This is great info. Just to add a little more info pet deposits are illegal in Ontario as well. The only legal deposits are last months rent and a key deposit (which can only be enough to cover replacement keys and fobs). If you’re worried about disclosing that you have a pet you can pay the deposit and then when you move in let them know you just found out it’s illegal and would like it returned; if they refuse you can file at the ltb to get it back. Generally I don’t condone lying but given the current rental market in most cities this may be necessary. So essentially: you don’t need to get rid of a pet because you are moving.
bipolar,fesbxtj,t3_eqf2cc,1579363671.0,I’m just so tired...
AskDocs,fegm2by,t3_eowxxm,1579096906.0,I used to have a very similar issue. When I was having to go for treatments that required sedation on a weekly basis it got really bad. They would put the iv wherever they could including a couple times in my feet (10/10 do not recommend having an iv in your foot). The one thing that seemed to help was putting a heat source on my arms about 20 minutes before they tried to do the iv (we used hot oat bags that went in the microwave). It didn’t always work but it did increase the frequency of a successful iv.
college,fe6575t,t3_envjls,1578882039.0,"I hate access codes. I hate that the resale of textbooks is shit because of access codes. More than anything I hate apps like Top Hat that are needed for “participation” marks (10% of final mark). All of these are barriers to education and just plain suck. You pay for the course, the textbook, and now participation apps! just take a damn role call or use name cards! Worse still, professors get free iPads if enough students enrolled to Top Hat; how can they justify that to themselves?"
bipolar,fe30wi7,t3_enogbt,1578844825.0,So I’ve had this illness for 21 years now but I was only diagnosed as BP1 8 years ago. Prior to that I was misdiagnosed for 13 years (multiple wrong diagnoses).
bipolar,fdyvqfs,t1_fdyogkm,1578784044.0,"I feel the same and I’m still terrified every time I do come out. The less people who know the better. I also learned this past year that I should not disclose my diagnoses in any er; the dr was great until he learned my diagnosis, then suddenly everything was in my head and he sent me home. I almost died thanks to that (my gp agreed that I should “forget” to put that on my history if it ever happens again, that says a lot to me). 20 years battling this and I still learn new things every year. There is still too much stigma and if anyone in my field found out the truth I would likely be blacklisted. I also will go through Reddit and delete all my comments when I’m hypo manic or manic terrified someone will “figure me out”. Also I apologize  if I end up deleting this comment too."
stcatharinesON,fdw33xh,t3_en7xnd,1578754579.0,"If you’re on Facebook you might try the group “Niagara’s singles and mingles”. It’s not really meant as a dating site, more of a meet new people and get together in groups site."
bipolar,fdl652t,t1_fdk10ri,1578517698.0,"Keep an eye on the restlessness. There is a side effect to atypical antipsychotics and antipsychotics called Akathisia. They describe it as restlessness but it’s so much more (anxiety, inability to sit still, constant movement, and other symptoms I can’t really describe). Even though it’s not a rare side effect it is often not diagnosed and missed. I’m not suggesting that’s causing your restlessness, just something to be aware of and keep an eye on."
brocku,fdkc573,t3_elnz00,1578500758.0,I received 10 half credit transfer credits (so 5 full credits) from a two year program at Georgian. I did however have 90% or above in all my courses.
bipolar,fcxg4tx,t3_ejestr,1578062053.0,Seroquel can definitely cause muscle twitching. I would keep an eye on it though and if you start to experience an inner restlessness and inability to sit still I would immediately go see your psych doc. There is a side effect that seroquel and other  antipsychotics/atypical antipsychotics can cause called Akithesia that is described mainly as restlessness but it is also so much more. I have had some crazy side effects over the years but that one absolutely takes the cake. It was 7 months of pure hell but it took about 6 weeks after I started the med before the side effects kicked in so it took 6 months before anyone put two and two together. Just something to keep an eye out for.
legaladvicecanada,fcvksgm,t3_eiomdt,1578004220.0,I’m not confident enough in my knowledge to completely answer your question. The best resource I have found for Ontario LTB issues is the Facebook group “Ontario tenant rights”. I suggest making a post there as it is an exceptionally well run group run by paralegals very familiar with tenant rights.
AskReddit,fcncdsi,t3_ehu0ck,1577808669.0,"Make a semester plan. At the beginning of the semester take all your syllabi and create a table (excel works perfectly for this). In the left most column put the dates for all the coming weeks then use a column for each individual course. Add in all the readings for each week along with all quizzes, tests and exams (I use red font to make them stand out). All this takes about 20 minutes to do and if you check it regularly you will never forget about what’s due and when or be surprised by a test. I usually print it out and use a highlighter to indicate what I have already completed which immediately shows which courses I’m ahead in and which ones I’m behind in. I have been doing this for the last 3 years and it makes studying far more efficient and reduces stress as I can look at the plan and know exactly where I stand and what needs to be done/ prepared for in the coming weeks."
legaladvicecanada,fcimzv4,t3_ehcu4t,1577665284.0,"You have two options
1) talk to your landlord and explain the situation. See if they will agree to you signing an N11 to mutually end your tenancy, 
2) if they won’t agree to an n11 ask to assign your lease. If they agree you can assist in finding someone to take over the rest of the lease. If they say no or do not respond in seven days you can submit an N9.

In the first scenario I would mention to your landlord that they can increase the rent to whatever they would like if they allow you to terminate your tenancy.

Edit to add: if you’re looking for more advice consider joining the Facebook group Ontario Tenant Rights. It’s a really well run group run by paralegals very familiar with the LTB and Ontario tenants rights."
