Firstly, preferences will always exist. Personally I’m most likely to find women hot but it’s not because I’m looking for a hot female specifically, I just prefer traditionally “feminine” characteristics in the body. Secondly, equal attraction to all genders doesn’t mean an equal likelihood of being attracted to a specific gender in relation to the rest. Pansexuals just don’t take gender into account when they think about what’s sexy to them."

They are a Scandinavian Christian explanation of what happened when a child is killed at the hands of its own mother and not given a burial (and were unbaptized). There is a story of a Myling ripping the chest of the woman who killed it as a baby after she decided to feed it, killing her and giving the Myling peace. They are full of rage and want revenge and peace, and will jump and force travelers to take them to graves, where they wish to be buried, but they end up killing their victims for being too slow because the Myling gets heavier near graves. 


They make an appearance in the game *Year Walk*, which has more unsettling Swedish folklore.... Mylings stood out to me though."

LeftHandPath,ff5qi2m,t3_ersap4,1579606132.0,"Buddhism is by its very nature anti-self. Most of the original teachings of Buddhism is based on quelling the Self in order to achieve Nirvana, which is considered the goal of many Buddhists. Many also take a harder doctrine-based path to do this. 


But, Tibet is home to a school of tantric Buddhism known as Vajrayana (sometimes considered a sub-sect of Mahayana), which engages in taboo in order to achieve enlightenment. In a Buddhist context this would also mean practices that celebrate the material world, which Buddhists see as something to escape, The logic to this practice is that by indulging in taboo, one achieves enlightenment quickly because maya (illusion) is broken through by contradictions and study of maya (hence why the name of this school translates to “thunderbolt vehicle” or “diamond vehicle”). 


It’s a lot more complicated than that but my basic understanding of Vajrayana is that practitioners identify as a deity in meditation (a form of self-deification) while participating in taboo in order to recognize illusion, as sacred and profane are muddled in the worldview of Tantra. I’m no expert but plenty of Tantric books exist on the subject. Vajrayana is also discussed briefly in Stephen E. Flowers’ book *Lords of the Left-Hand Path* and there’s actually quite a few materials online."

If you haven’t already, I would suggest to you to get some of LaVey’s books in your personal library. The Satanic Bible at the very least, but the Devil’s Notebook is fairly useful in a philosophical context too.

A lot of people go into the LHP expecting a need to be completely dark and blasphemous in order to get anywhere. Not only is this usually unrealistic and often unnecessary, it could actually hinder your growth. Anton LaVey said we are both of evil and of good. Humans have a natural tendency to form Us vs Them opinions and one of the goals of the LHP is to recognize everyone to some extent is an Us and Them, and break down notions of rigid spirituality and belief to the point where you basically are your own god; you create yourself as you please, from the way you live to how you practice spirituality. It’s an alchemical process. 


Philosophy is just as if not more important that aesthetic on the LHP. And it’s more complex than siding with darkness. To be on the LHP means to take control of yourself and Self-growth, at least on a personal level."

For example, Tyr is indeed the god of war, but he shares the association of battle and war with many other gods (Odin, Freyr) and goddesses (Freyja, the Dis). It’s like saying only apples are red. Yes, apples can be red, but there are also green and yellow apples and red things that aren’t apples. Odin’s role as All-father is only a small portion of his character; he doesn’t have 170 epithets for nothing (including One-eyed, Raven God, several spear-related epithets, Hanged one, some High One epithets, Mask, etc....). Odin is the apple and his epithets are the colors; not all gods (whether they are pears, squash, onions...) have colors like Odin and some gods share his colors (like apples and pears are both green, but also some pears have a natural brownish skin while apples really don’t).

2. A little bit of both, to be honest; I have multiple patrons. I noticed in the kinds of books I read, the things in nature I’d notice first and in certain dreams various aspects of certain gods. Sometimes names and images made it clear who was influencing a part of my life, such as with Sekhmet and Shiva. When I was ready, I came to them. Only one (Santisima Muerte) directly came to me first, and it was in my darkest moment in life. 


3. I didn’t receive much signs for the one who came to me first. The closest thing to it would be my natural sympathy and spiritual attraction towards the idea of Death.

occult,fdjh4t2,t3_elfdxz,1578470575.0,"1. Taoism is not influenced by Paganism per say. It’s more a mix of Confucianism, Buddhism and traditional Chinese beliefs (arguably Pagan but some would say not Pagan), with the most influence coming from Buddhist Tantra, which was an offshoot of Hinduism (Hindu Tantra), which may have also influenced some forms of Paganism.


2. Wicca is a direct offshoot of Hermeticism through Thelema and the Golden Dawn. It was also based on a now widely rejected anthropological theory on Pagan cave art.


3. Should have added Gnostic Christianity as a coparent of Hermeticism. EDIT: thought I’d add, Hermeticism has some Pagan influences like like Orphism (Greek mystic Dionysian cult)


4. To answer your second question: they are all interconnected and must have some bit of the truth. No one is really better than another."

spirituality,fdjbvb2,t3_eloptx,1578464625.0,"“Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.”  ~Chuang Chou (aka Zhuangzi). 


Your dreams can become your reality if you aim for them. Happiness comes from transformation, not stagnation. Like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, or a man dreaming of not being himself but who he aspires to be (happy). Keep following the butterfly to transform into a happier Self."

books,fditc1g,t3_elg2mt,1578450579.0,My mom (in her 40’s) loves good children’s books (Especially in the “for age 7-10” range) because they tend to be very good at storytelling while communicating complex and difficult topics. Just because a book is for kids doesn’t mean adults can’t get anything out of them. I myself adore certain YA and children’s literature and I’m 21. Some parts of me just aren’t going to grow out of it and that’s fine. Everyone is still a kid in some way.

occult,fdg9z8y,t3_el8gwz,1578386481.0,"Honestly? Meh. He’s okay but he drags some of his politics into his occult videos too and it can be a turnoff for someone who’s not even into politics, or disagrees with his points. That aside, he is decently educated on the topic of medieval grimoires and Western occultism, and he does have experience in occult belief systems. Overall, he’s okay for starters who are interested in Western occultism specifically, but he’s not extraordinary. In fact a lot of the topics he covers are only surface level stuff and sometimes he doesn’t go anywhere with it later. Which is why I think he’s pretty “meh”. I gotta admit though, he is rather good-looking and that was the main reason I stayed with the series in the first place. I don’t like hearing him talk about politics though."

I don’t want people to care whether or not I’d sleep with another woman and I don’t care if some random person is gay or straight. Just respect people as they respect you. The only reason I’m vocal about my sexuality online is because I don’t have a lot of people to talk to about it in real life and I’m tired of people saying confidently (sometimes in person, in front of me) that I don’t exist. I exist, I’m a human, and I’m tired of being treated like scum, and I don’t want to be the center of attention. I just want to be happy being me and I want others to go about being happy too."

It’s not a realm I frequent but I think the power of this type of magic is not to be underestimated."

Like, I need to talk sometimes, I just don’t see certain topics as interesting and most people aren’t very good at talking about anything but other people and trends. And I don’t hate people for liking those things, I’m just not about that and I also would rather be alone most of the time. People who don’t understand that personal space is a thing can be annoying but a lot of the time they just want others to be happy and they don’t know how to deal with someone who prefers it when they’re alone."
