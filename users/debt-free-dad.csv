leanfire,ffa5x20,t3_es2fwv,1579728511.0,"The urban/rural problem you set up here is, I think, a black/white logical fallacy. As others have mentioned, there are lots of in-betweens, and everything from critical access hospitals in the middle-of-nowhere to fairly decent-sized hospitals with cardiac catheterization labs in cities of 25,000. Obviously a person should research the access to medical options before they move to a new place. 

Just for another counter-point, wait times in emergency rooms in big cities can be MUCH longer than ER wait times in pop 25,000-50,000 cities. Some small cities even have competition between healthcare companies, with multiple hospitals to choose from as a patient. 

I don't know. This is a non-starter discussion for me, and I think OP is way off base. I plan to retire in a semi(?) rural area with a pop of about 8,000 and there is a hospital there with ER and a cardiology team. Good enough for me."
personalfinance,ff9bgx5,t1_ff98954,1579709161.0,"Well, you could think about getting a small MIDI keyboard to plug into your laptop to satisfy your music itch, and even record some tunes in your hotel room. Just an idea. Or they make travel electric guitars, and 3/4 size guitars. The bodiless headless electrics are quite small. Just something to think about to make your travel life better. Or just buy a “beater” guitar that you won’t care if it gets lost in transit. Or a mandolin, ukulele, smaller instrument.

And yeah, most data I’ve looked at show polls around 80% of Americans hate their job. 

For the rest, there’s always r/frugal, r/leanfire, r/financialindependence, etc

Pulling in $120-130k or thereabouts, little or no debt, and low living expenses, you could reasonably explore early retirement scenarios in the next few years, especially r/leanfire. 

I’m sure you should be able to use your current experience to find a more tolerable, low-stress role. Keep jamming, and start sending out applications today. It’ll take a minute, but if you want the change, you can do it.

Pay off the car ASAP as well while you’re making big money in case you do decide to transition to a lower stress lower pay role.

Edit: Just thinking about the music element more, there are even DAW (digital audio workstation) apps like Garageband you can run on your smartphone or iPad. Some of the MIDI keyboard devices are super small or you can even play piano in some DAWs on a QWERTY keyboard if you travel with laptop. Or buy a small USB condenser mic and make acapella music. You know? I would urge you to think a little outside the box to how you can continue making music while on the road. If Woody could do it with two pennies to his name and hitchhiking across the country, you can definitely find a solution with all the cool music products and technology out there. I just don’t want you to kill that dream while you’re working. Look into some of these things so you can keep your sanity and do some creative work while traveling."

Kant was a tutor for 9 years then a lecturer/professor for 15. Kafka was an insurance salesman. Vonegutt had a string of odd jobs, selling cars, etc

Nabokov, to be fair, was born into a wealthy family. 

Dickens, though - it was his experience as a child chimney sweep that inspired many of his stories and led him to have such a vivid ability to capture the horrors of industrial England...

This isn’t the whole picture of their lives. Many did work industriously and tirelessly at their craft against odds, I suppose is my point. Maybe they would have done even more art and music and literature without the struggle. We don’t know.

I’m not trying to shit on anyone’s day. Just saying that these folks struggled like the rest of us for years, some even for their whole lives.

It’s interesting to compare this to the unemployment rate, which is very low in the U.S., but is calculated with specific parameters, and, as any good statistics professor would tell you, statistics are often presented in particular ways to make particular points.

This is accounting for the entire population, including 65+ retirees, children, wealthy folks, stay-at-home parents, etc.

antiwork,ff1o4hl,t1_fevl51l,1579482437.0,"u/HotPhilly is getting downvoted, but this was an argument that Slavoj Zizek put forth about Trump. Zizek made the claim that Trump could cause enough destabilization/chaos to allow for new forms of thinking and revolution to arise in the political space, or at least cause the US democratic party to re-assess their strategy, which frankly isn't that radical of an idea if anyone's actually read any of the leftist literature. The rest is basically Marx 101 kind of stuff. Historical materialism. Capitalism will have to implode/destroy itself before the next stage can begin. Obviously the theory of historical materialism is debated and so is Marx. But just saying that there are not-totally-wrong reasons to vote for Trump if you're the kind of person who wants to see the world burn (in the name of progress). None of this is my cup of tea, but it's in the literature.

Otherwise your options are limited. You may have to suffer worse under capitalism if you don’t do capitalism well. 

Look at how Zizek sells countless books and charges high fees for his speaking appearances, just for an example of an anti-capitalist playing the system.

That might not be a very prudent financial strategy, though, and it's hard to evaluate the ethics of a company, when there is only so much public information about their practices. And stock-picking is never advised as a long-term financial strategy. 

Yeah. Global capitalism is of course a huge problem for myriad reasons and I didn't touch on any of the political or macro-economic issues with my post on purpose, as most people do not have the agency, time, or resources to do much about it other than vote or advocate for particular concepts like UBI or regionalism or better workers rights, etc., but that's a whole other can of worms, and just my perspective.

YMMV and I’m not saying this is a good idea, but it would be an inexpensive way to FIRE without much capital. Essentially just 10 grand to do this, though you’ll want probably $30k for building maintenance set aside and you’ll have to log some landlord hours at first.

antiwork,fewm64n,t3_eqq3rc,1579414331.0,"For me it’s a combination of mental illness, delayed phase sleep syndrome, absolute lack of energy (I need unhealthy amounts of caffeine just to seem like a normative social person), the dread of deadlines, the desire for freedom, the despair that arises from doing patterned, scheduled things day after day after day.

Then add some tinnitus, chronic back pain, eye floaters, gout, and constant fight against alcoholism into the mix. Social anxiety. I got hooked on opioids for back pain and then got cut off after back surgery. Turned to booze after being sober for 3 years. Mostly sober now but I go on small binges for a few days just to get lost in my head, every few months.

I’ve been very successful in a normative US kind of way. PhD when I was 24. Married. Kids. Dragged myself through high-paying corporate jobs that wrecked my health. I’m a professor, now. But even with the great breaks, and healthcare, and pension plan, I can still feel myself being tugged along by the strings. I don’t want to sit through another department meeting or committee meeting. I don’t have the energy to do it for another 35 years. 

I am 30 and make a good salary, $50k in a low cost of living city, and we’ll probably retire early into a paid-off super cheap house in the rural Midwest, where I will write books, play songs, spend time with my family, cook, watch Ken Burns’s Civil War documentary, and hopefully do something good for the world with all I’ve seen and read and researched. I’m not sure. More than anything I just want to be able to sleep when I want to (when I am able to, which is often at weird hours - I can only sleep in the late night and early morning for reasons no physician can understand). It makes living on a 8-5 business hour schedule incredibly difficult.

Even with $50k though, it doesn’t go very far. Mortgage, kids, wife, food, utilities. Some months we run a deficit if there’s a big emergency, like the sewage backed up into our basement last year. It’s kind of embarrassing to have a PhD and effectively take home $2800/month.

Honestly I don’t think this sub is a good fit for me. I’m more of a r/leanfire kind of guy. I’ve become quite obsessed with finding a way to retire early, because I just don’t fit into society’s schedule. Everyday is a struggle to get through my e-mail inbox, and solve other peoples’ problems, and prop myself up with coffee and chewing tobacco while I slide faster and faster toward death. But through a high savings rate and some luck we’ll probably be done with work in a few years. I’m the kind of person who would rather solve a problem than be defeated by it. So I was attracted to r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence and then r/leanfire because I will probably never make six figures again, it basically ruined several years of my life and health and mental health.

And that might be it, in a nutshell. I know I’m going to die someday. So I’d like to live on my own terms.

Thanks for opening up a space for rant and discussion. Hope you are well and can make good with what you have. Maybe you could look into remote/online positions?

What kind of entertaining do you want to do? I almost made a go at playing music and was doing it semi-professionally, but then work happened. Maybe you can tap back into that to keep yourself going. Art for art’s sake."
Showerthoughts,fdzuhgf,t3_endq3v,1578796087.0,"The Dutch historian Johan Huizinga explores the significance of “play” at depth in his work Homo ludens. Play is widely studied in psychology, evolutionary biology, education, anthropology, and other disciplines. Thinking about play seems to be important and the phenomenon of play seems to be a kind of universal even across many species. 

For those who want to read more, the work of James Paul Gee is fairly well regarded on gamification and education, Jane McGonigal has published extensively on the social significance of games (and video games), and there’s a ton of peer-reviewed literature to read on play, learning, etc. 

Not to mention the long-held philosophical fascination with “the good.” The basis of philosophy going back to the ancient Greeks is basically “how do we live a good life?” which then gravitates toward questions of enjoyment, fun, happiness, motivation, ethics, etc.

Equating play with “good” could be problematic, though, in terms of OP’s post. That’s where we might start a discussion: the Nazi doctors doing live experiments on people were probably activating play-like exploratory circuits in their brains."

I personally wouldn’t do this. Invest your time in something scalable that uses your expertise. 

What do you mean you have $500 to spare? If this is your last $500 in the universe and you don’t have an emergency fund, then NO. Of course not. Don’t do this.

You might need to end up repairing these things, and parts will likely be expensive. 

It’s hard to say and I’m no expert, but I would be surprised if you made back the money in two years. Also consider the labor and time of collecting the change, refilling the machines, repairing them.

I’m not sold on the idea. It’s too small, it sounds risky if you don’t have much spare capital, and these machines seem to be a dying phenomenon that will fade like the payphone.

I think it’s a hard decision to advise upon, without knowing your financial situation. If you have proven income already doing the Instagram work and have tried applying to VA positions and are getting interviews, then you’re probably fine. 

I’ve joked with my students that there are basically only two formulas for retirement, the important one here being: if x > y then R, where x is your passive income and y is your living expenses, and R is retirement or the ability to retire. Put simply, if your passive income exceeds your living expenses, then you’re good to go.

So you can also take this and figure out how to adjust the values of x and y. Can you live more lean, cut your grocery budget, move to a cheaper city, etc? 

Personally, what I am doing is building the passive income first while still employed as a teacher, to minimize risk.

Have you thought about selling online courses through Udemy or Teachable or another LMS? This could be another good stream of income. Build an “Intro to Interior Design” course or something.

Lots of people leave their careers to run businesses, but you should make sure to take a realistic look at your budget, projected income, prepare for contingencies, consider and size up the job market in your area in case you need to return to work...

I would be happy to weigh in further if you post more details. Or consider going over to r/financialindependence or r/personalfinance to have someone take a detailed look at your budget to see if this is possible.

It’s hard to say without knowing more. For example, if you have a spouse who makes $120k and you live on $40k/year of expenses and you have no debt, then of course this is possible, because it wouldn’t matter if you worked at all, financially.

You could start applying to VA jobs this spring and then resign once you have the offer, and use the summer to see if you like it or not."

I think the idea is flawed because academics conduct research very purposefully and also very differently across fields. Usually I am either 1) looking for a specific paper to cite or 2) catching up on new ideas in my field. Unless you have some kind of really cool proprietary algo developed that connects central ideas in respective disciplines. I would like something like that: like something that basically creates a literature review for me. But then again I doubt I would trust an automated process to vet the research.

This is just my two cents, though. I would suggest talking to some people who work with peer-reviewed scientific literature daily and ask what they would want. Again, personally, I wouldn’t use a dedicated  app like this to assist with my research. 

You would also run into some issues probably with paywalls. At least in the US research is a mess, and access to journals is handled by university libraries buying subscriptions to the journals,

My first month of costs was less than $100 for hosting the site, building the courses, running some test ads, experimenting with a free MailChimp account. Now I’m increasing our ad spend and playing with other ideas as we’re growing.

It’s important to make sure you have a good idea before you quit the job and take out a $50,000 personal loan. I’m just echoing your sentiments here. For most people it’s best to start small and bankroll a start-up with disposable income from a full-time job.

I’m thinking about early retirement this summer with a mix of online business income and real estate. But we only spend about $1500/month or less so it frankly isn’t too much work to create that much in monthly income from a couple of sources."
GetMotivated,fcrlxz0,t1_fcqb8jf,1577903540.0,"Keep going strong, friend. Something that really helped me in my 20s was to stop and realize, ""Hey, I AM a musician."" It doesn't matter if you sell 10 albums or 1,000,000. Few people reach astronomical success. So define your own concrete goals and define your own success. Like, ""I want to sell 200 albums this year"" or ""I'm going to design a t-shirt and order 20 of them and try to sell them all by March 1st"" or ""I'm going to build a website for my band this week."" 

I think it also works well to have some long-term goals. Like, ""In 3 years I'm going to book a regional tour with another musician."" 

If you're doing it and you love it then embrace it and roll with it. Play shows. Make weird album art with the free Photoshop app. Upload stuff to Spotify. Ask a friend to take some new promo shots. Make that music, friend.

And honestly I would recommend developing some other longterm career goals to along with all of this because most musicians don't make much money."
GetMotivated,fcp3x9z,t1_fcoiqau,1577849702.0,Send out 100 job applications to different cities you’ve always wanted to live in. Pack up and leave. Declare bankruptcy. Do some Marie Kondo style organizing and minimalizing. Make a new budget. Sell your house and go live in South America and get high and play Mario Kart probably.
GetMotivated,fcp3qyz,t1_fcops1r,1577849550.0,"I like how Jordan Peterson addresses the problem of happiness. He basically says that happiness is not a good goal to have. The psychological literature shows that happiness is fleeting and elusive. So, he says to build a life with meaning and purpose by taking on the responsibility to better yourself, and then your family or community by extension. It goes back to the existentialists, at least, but we see threads of this in Ancient Greek thought, as well. 

Craft your own story or adventure in the world. I also love Joseph Campbell on this topic with his message of “Find your bliss,” which is basically: figure out what the world is calling you forth to do, and do it, and enjoy it.

Naturally all of this takes tons of work and is a lifelong process. I know I’m in the middle of all of it. Five years ago I was a dishwasher, now I’m a professor, we’re building a family now. People die, things change. 

The basic rule of life is that it is full of suffering, and a great way to weather the natural suffering of being human is to build meaning."
Showerthoughts,fco7rnm,t1_fco78vu,1577825710.0,"Gotcha’. Well I hope my comment helped to know that you are far from in an abnormal position. I bet you could get a freelance gig going on Upwork or start a quick website to show off your graphic design skills, or search for remote graphic design positions which are becoming more common. I’ve also known tons of people who work in marketing who started as graphic designers. And on the other side, you’re basically living the dream for many people of not having to slog through corporate life, so, I bet there’s a lot of good that you could do with a little bit more strategizing about how to use your time and talents."
Showerthoughts,fco723y,t1_fco0uoc,1577825319.0,"I got really interested in alternatives to the corporate world in the last few years and I researched a bit, it turns out that about 50% of the total US population does not have a job, if you include kids, stay at home parents, retirees, people who can’t work, etc. - so you are far from alone, about half of all Americans simply do not have a job. Just curious, do you not work or do you mean the job you have is not longterm-career oriented?"
Showerthoughts,fco6ow2,t1_fcnnazv,1577825111.0,"There has been a bit of research on this phenomenon in psychology, where it is called time dilation. Some studies suggested that introducing novelty into your life can in effect slow down time (trying new things, going new places, eating new food, etc). But also there seems to be a general phenomenon that as we get older time seems to speed up, not only because our lives tend to get oriented toward routines that can be extremely prolonged (consider going to work 5 days a week every week for 40 years), but also because we have a longer frame of reference to compare back to - one year when you’re 60 is proportionally less of your life already experienced than when you’re 10."
todayilearned,fcnbzvy,t1_fcnaq7r,1577808409.0,It seems related to me. Trump has been very pro-asbestos and lifted some EPA restrictions on its use. Russia is one of the world’s biggest asbestos producers. There is even a Russian company that prints a Trump face on their asbestos label. It’s so cartoonish it’s hard to believe.
NintendoSwitch,fcl4qhz,t1_fckd0nq,1577739773.0,"Definitely agree. I had fun playing Shield, and fun is pretty much the only metric that matters to me at this point, as well as value.

NintendoSwitch,fcl3brr,t1_fcl1s1m,1577738897.0,"Unfortunately I was just joking. I think Nintendo is likely working on something, though. Or at least a re-release. I don’t think there has been any official news though. Just speculation."

memes,fcl0z27,t1_fckze5o,1577737444.0,"Basically, yeah. To be a human seems to mean that you are subjectively experiencing a current, present state of consciousness. 

Although some of the earlier 20th century philosophers made interesting observations about how what we describe as the present is necessarily constructed by the past. On many scales, of course, even the small scale. Like, when you’re listening to a song and your brain is interpreting a melody, you couldn’t just stop time and pick out any single note as the present. The past and present are coded together by the mind in this instance as you hear the melody from the past mingling with the present. And similarly the human is a planning creature and we often model the future and consider futures, so in this way the present moment is also influenced by the future. And many thinkers from psychology to philosophy have written about the future, for Jung it is almost like our present self is being called forth by future manifestations of our logos. And Derrida distinguished between different types of “future.” And many political philosophers have varied ideas about the future and time. 

I’m not sure what contemporary philosophers and physicists say about time. I think it is still considered a dimension of our reality and then we have some of the Einstein stuff on relativity but I couldn’t tell you what the most widely accepted definitions of time would be."
NintendoSwitch,fckx0d5,t1_fcktr16,1577735006.0,"Oh, and yeah, I think your comment about shorter games having a function was interesting. The industry has certainly changed a lot since I was a kid. A lot of software, even with Nintendo, seems to be following a minimum viable product model and then patching and updates come down the road. But in some ways it seems like smaller games are becoming more normal - I was disappointed with Kirby Star Allies. I just would have liked to see the scale and depth and care put into it like we had with Kirby Super Stars (SNES). Kirby along with the Switch Mario Party and the bad Switch Bomberman release game I think show that Nintendo is missing some of the “X Factor” creativity we saw in BOTW from its other franchises."
NintendoSwitch,fckw80h,t1_fcktr16,1577734529.0,"My wife and I tried the multiplayer on Rayman yesterday, and like DK Tropical Freeze it is perfectly OK and works. There is a similar “rescue mechanic” that triggers if P2 is hit. So if you are playing with a less skilled player you aren’t penalized in any way. You pop their bubble to bring them back, like the balloon in Tropical Freeze. 

With some of the more challenging and faster levels the multiplayer is pretty tough because of the highly timed jumping. It’s not impossible but it makes the game more difficult and confusing I think. Or some people might think it’s easier with multiplayer because I think any player can move the team forward to the next check point, so you could see it as, like 4 different opportunities to clear the area. It’s fun enough, anyway!

The UI and overall set up of the multiplayer is great - if someone wants to join they just pop in. When they’re done they can exit out, right in level, as opposed to having to restart the game or go back to a main menu to reselect 1 player option.

Anyway, yes, multiplayer is fun and worthwhile, but I’ve been mostly doing single player and have been enjoying it immensely. And there’s just the right amount of collectibles, daily and weekly challenges which are fun, and basically two games in one as it contains Rayman Origin in it as well. Definitely worth the sale price!"
memes,fckud3m,t1_fckomu0,1577733382.0,"I would actually be very interested in a technical explanation of the present. Philosophers acknowledge a present, like in the sense that phenomenologists refer to a past, present and future. 

What you’re getting at reminds me of Derrida a bit in his writing about voice, he describes how spoken words die just as quickly as they roll off our tongues as they enter the past. 

Almost any science or humanities field I’m familiar with acknowledges a present. It’s good to question these things but there just doesn’t seem to be any reason to dismiss the idea of the present. It shapes how we experience reality. It literally is reality: consciously existing in a present condition. It is how we experience time as a dimension of our universe.

I guess I just think you’re wrong because most disciplines seem to acknowledge a concept of the present. It’s a defining characteristic of consciousness and how we live. So there is a present and it’s worth thinking about."
NintendoSwitch,fckpy5f,t3_ehmuie,1577730661.0,"Pleasantly Surprised

Rayman Legends: It’s old news but this is my favorite platforming game I played this year, and it’s new to me. I just picked this up on 75% sale and it’s a fantastic platformer. A lot of the levels reminded me of oldschool DKC2 level designs. Lots of fun and nostalgia-inducing for me having grown up with SNES. Challenging but not punishing. Perfect game for me to enjoy over Christmas break. And I’m definitely starting to appreciate more the “pick up and play” kind of games, as we have a 1-year-old who is running around! 

Dragon Quest XI: I probably put 80-90 hours into this, in the fall, and got through to the end. It scratched an itch for traditional RPGs. It just felt really solid all over. I would have liked a little less linearity. I enjoyed the world and characters but didn’t feel like I could stop to enjoy it as much as I wanted to. It’s very much “on to the next cutscene” and there were times where I was definitely getting burned out on the voice acting and long story sections that didn’t have much to do with the plot.

Goose Game: Yes, it’s short, but my wife and I had fun playing this on my birthday. It took us a few sessions to get through it actually. We laughed a lot. The stages are integrated beautifully into a larger world map that runs together seamlessly. There is some replay value, with new objectives unlocked at the end. So I think those people saying it is only 3-4 hours long may have not really given it a chance. Or perhaps we’ll see a longer game from these developers in a sequel.

Pikmin: Playing Pikmin on the Switch was the highlight of the year. Captain Oliver’s controls feel absolutely natural with the touch screen and gyro. Pikmin was my favorite game on the Gamecube and the last console Nintendo game I really got into before taking a big break from gaming during my teens and 20s. All in all, having a Switch is a big nostalgia trip for me, especially after missing out on the Wii and WiiU as I was busy working and getting on with life. So now to come back to Nintendo as a 30-year-old dude with a family is a lot of fun. Either way, Pikmin really stands out here and has a little something for everyone.

Mario Party: The negative reviews are mostly justified: Four maps. But if you can get past that, Mario Party has strong core gameplay and the minigames are a blast. Some strange decisions were made in the creation of this game, but I had a lot of fun with family playing this one. We had the original Mario Party on N64 growing up so this brought back some good memories. I’ll hope Nintendo releases new maps or a New Super Mario Party 2 Deluxe in 2021.

Disappointed: Wargroove. I really enjoyed Advance Wars and was looking forward to Wargroove. Oddly I think the problem was that it seemed too balanced with the AI. Mid-game matches could drag on for hours as you grind through waves of newly generated enemy units as you generate new units... it just didn’t have the same snap crackle pop of Advance Wars."
politics,fc6xx9o,t1_fc608tu,1577492343.0,I don’t think Facebook would have any way to not accept political ads. The ad volume is too high. You couldnt really even have an algo that looks for keywords to deny ads - people would then find a way to get through. I would say there’s no way for FB to accurately automate nor manually operate a process to examine the hundreds of millions of ads they process.
GetMotivated,fc3q1vt,t3_efzmsp,1577395780.0,"This is a good one. Granted, you need to put yourself out there and apply and try if you want to expect to get any life-changing incoming messages.

But for me, this rings true. I was in a lot of debt in my early 20s and slogging it out in a job I hated. I sent out around 100 job applications and managed to land a great gig doing something interesting in a low cost of living state making $80k+. This was a big deal as I was making about $20/hr at the time and had began the year as a dishwasher. And this was after several interviews and phone calls that went nowhere. Eventually everything aligned and worked out. But it wasn’t overnight. 

I met my wife shortly after, paid off all my debt, got into real estate, had kids, bought a nice house, found an even better job, etc. If I hadn’t attempted to make a serious change I’d probably be at that desk right now pulling my hair out.

Life can change rapidly for the better but you have to create the conditions for these types of life-changing opportunities to arrive. It’s a balance, I think, of consistent effort and resiliency and to be fair, quite a bit of luck to go along with it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fbgzeim,t1_fbggksj,1576862080.0,This is good. I often have many Fs in my classes but it’s because students stop showing up and don’t do any of the work. Usually I have lots of As and lots of Fs. We have a high non-traditional student population and we’re starting to think more about retention. But the national trend is that about 50% of college students drop out. So I don’t know if there’s much more I can do to make the courses I teach more accessible. It’s all laid out really well in the syllabus and the folks who do the work and come to class get As and learn a lot. The folks who disappear during the semester and don’t turn in any work... I have to fail them because they effectively didn’t even take the course.
