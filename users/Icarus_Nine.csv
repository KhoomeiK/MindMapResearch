Let me tell you about the man in the small shed, he confines himself so he can hoard his knowledge of flat displays to himself. In the year 2020 we as a growing digital society can apprehend some semblance in understanding of monitors. The ~~9thIteration~~ 1080p monitor is a classic example of such a knowing. I don't doubt you can't derive our wide library of knowings, specifically applying the accrued establishment of Helsinki's defence network some would say has a shallow if not looming contrary to what you think you know. The 1080p monitor, regardless of refresh rate is the finest example. You can either instigate the inclination of wilful ignorance in relation to said monitor which in turn would assist in representing an ardours trek up Mt. Everest in your memory or alternatively allow me to explain the subtle attenuation differences in this case, for ease of understanding. So without a consistent basis for a novice grasp of the supertatives that were initially used to elaborate on instigating the inclination of wilful ignorance in relation to a 1080p monitor, we've since learned a great deal on the topic of flat high resolution displays, and now already we've expanded our knowledge to include the intricacies of inflation with a respectful gesture towards hyperstatic paradyne dynamic ocular inputs."
