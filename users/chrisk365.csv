Currently in a very LCOL area doing front end web development after realizing I HATED most backend development, and have been ecstatic in my current position but from the comments, it sounds like most developers hate UI/UX. Anyone have advice on how long I should stay in a low cost (and low paying) area with a lot of job security to build more experience, and how to branch out and find a new front-end position in a bigger city like Atlanta? Job boards like Monster never gave me much luck after graduating and it seems most are hunting for backend devs anyway."

That was in response to a SELF DRIVING CAR thread. in which someone said “I will take a Ford Fiesta that drives itself over a BMW/Merc/Audi that does not. I have never cared what the car I drive says about me. It's just transportation.”  Someone said ‘I care.’ Then I said Lexus.
todayilearned,fed451x,t1_fed3bl4,1578997900.0,"Dude. First of all I just realized that particular comment you referenced was 96 days ago, so you must’ve done some heavy stalking to uncover that. Second of all, that comment was in response to “what car can I choose that’s most reliable and most durable?” Completely different goal. All they wanted was a more premium version of a corolla. 
A corolla is a terrific car, btw. NO, it’s not a race car. It’s the slowest and poorest handling vehicle in its class, but it holds its value and sips gas like a motherfucker. 
Try and see where people are coming from and realize that everyone has different goals, instead of assuming you know everyone bc you read 150 of their comments in 20 minutes flat. Sorry if I jumped down your throat man."
