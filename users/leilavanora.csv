relationships,ff259tt,t1_ff1dvar,1579494188.0,"I’ve noticed most people don’t know how to respond to trauma victims either. They either try to make a joke or will discredit it without realizing. That’s one of the main reasons why I avoid any topics that might lead to discussing any childhood trauma because people always react oddly. 

Even innocent questions can be triggering. Someone asked once if my mom bought me a lot of presents growing up and it immediately made me remember growing up impoverished and not having anything let alone “lots of presents.” Another time I was telling my husband about how I grew up in poverty and he responded with “you weren’t impoverished. It’s not like you were homeless” which is a super offensive comment to make, but people just don’t know how to respond to things like that. I’ve legit had people try to make light of traumatic events in my childhood and it’s so inappropriate that I just avoid any chance of bringing it up."

The first time I paid for my best friends $50 dance ticket when I was 14 I figured she would pay me back the next day. Took her two years with $1 here and $2 there. Pretty sure she also gave me $5 of stolen gift cards (in the form of 5 gift cards???). It was super annoying.

I had over 100 allergens placed on my back and I couldn’t shower for 5 days. It cost $20 with my insurance and was done by a dermatologist. 

I use sooooooo many random products but that’s obviously stopping now. My husband was so cute last night he was all “so what’s up is all this stuff mine now???” as if he didn’t have full access to my toiletries to begin with. 

I’ve only showered with water since I got my test results and I’m shopping for new products now. They give you a special code with all your allergens to plug into this app and the app tells you what products you can use but it’s all rando brands I’ve never heard because I’m allergenic right most mainstream products.

Edit: Robathol is on the list of products I can use! Hurrah!"

It’s annoying because I have Kaiser and most doctors don’t have reviews. When I book appts for my husband he has amazing insurance where he doesn’t even need a referral and I’m able to find the top 5 star doctor in the city for him but with Kaiser I just have to keep switching doctors until I find the right one for me. 

Finally at almost 30 years old have I finally figured out the referral system and I know I need to make my appts months in advance and message my doctor repeatedly for referrals until they take me seriously."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdkwsrc,t1_fdku4ew,1578512776.0,"Yeah it took me a LONG time to figure out how to get adequate care. I remember I had a terrible full body drug eruption after major surgery and I was SUFFERING. I saw and spoke to six different doctors, was in the ER, etc and it was impossible for me to get the steroids I needed. 

I have Kaiser so you can’t see a specialist without a referral from your primary doctor and she wasn’t available for a week and then it takes like two more weeks to schedule a dermatologist visit. Then I went to the ER in a different hospital and they confirmed I had a drug eruption but wouldn’t prescribe me steroids until I saw their dermatologist 3 days later and this was after waiting in the ER for four hours. 

In the end I literally messaged a doctor I met on tinder (but never in person) who referred me to a dermatologist and they could tell I was in serious pain and prescribed me steroids immediately to my pharmacy over the phone. It took 10 minutes and didn’t cost me anything and I just can’t believe that’s what it freaking took for me to get medical care when multiple professionals in various hospitals told me I was having a drug eruption."

minimalism,fc5olgu,t1_fc5mmrj,1577462714.0,"Well for example we are remodeling and redecorating right now. We have these hideous lamps that needed to go and I found beautiful lamps as a replacement. They were $200 so I wanted to wait and think about it and then my mom asked what we wanted for Christmas and so I sent the link to the lamp and she ordered one. Then she asked what my husband wanted an hour later and he said the lamp so she ordered another one (which is not efficient def should’ve just told her we wanted two to begin with). We def didn’t NEED new lamps so it was fine using our original ones until Christmas. 

Another example is my dog loved these yak cheese treats. I’ve been meaning to replenish her supply but she has sooooo much dog treats already so I’ve been putting it off in order to finish off some of her other treats and yak cheese is pricey compared to other dog treats. We asked my brother in law to buy us some for Christmas and it’s something I’d much rather have than a rando gift I may never use. 

Our goal is to ask for things we are going to buy for ourselves anyways instead of letting people buy us random gifts as my husbands family does one of those crazy gift giving Christmases where we legit spent almost 4 hours unwrapping over 100+ gifts. It’s insane and my husband is currently horrified at the thought of adding more stuff to our home because we’ve done over 20 goodwill runs this year doing mass clean outs of our home during renovations. We still have tons of brand new Christmas gifts we’ve received years ago because they are mainly novelty knick knacks."
