again im not talking about giving them a gold star and say good job, im just saying let them be included in the +, Thats it, LGBTQ+ is for people who think that as humans we have the right to love who we love and be who we love.  
i don't think being an ally is a choice, i think all none queer people are born allies but then people chose to go against us.  
we need to show allies that we respect them and are grateful for their help, i think just agreeing that they have a place with in our group is good enough."

yes they are, like not in the Europe or America but in countries were homosexuality carries a death sentence they have laws that also affect allies to try and discourage support of us, there is literally videos of allies being attacked at pride, at peaceful demonstrations just because they were there, i've even seen my own best friend get the shit kicked out of him because we wore a LGBT pin to school to silently show he supported me.

TrueOffMyChest,fdxc8k8,t1_fdx7vbe,1578767343.0,"we are talking about cows aged 17 to 20, that puts them in their 70s/80s, they have maybe 2 years left and that's with constant care and monitoring that they won't be able to go out and graze, they will be kept in the stall until they die, what life is that? id rather go still being able to stand and take care of my self rather than spend my final days stuck in bed with machines keeping me alive.  
  
crops are far more complicated becase they take up far more land based on their yield and a cows yield, a cow needs maybe 25 m2, were as to prodice the same amount of food you need about a quarter acre and they are 100% dependent on you, a cow can take care of it self, it will keep it self fit, it will eat what it need. and also if i need to move for what ever reason, i can just get a rope and walk the cow to the new place, its a lot more complicated moving a quarter acre of crops.  
  
what should we do instead? release all of the cows and live stock we have? have millions of animals flooding the country side destroying local wild life then them selves dying do to the lack of food that they can eat and survive off, we can't stop because if we did we would cause a mass extinction event.  
they have no consept of being forced or even really of death, if primates some of the smartest animals on the planet struggle to grasp the concept of not knowing something do you really think a cow can understand the idea that is just food and its being well treated then slaughtered?

it acutely doesn't when you factor in how much the customer pays, your typical mass produced steak is around £6, our steaks are £20, we can afford to give them large amounts of land, time and care because people are willing to pay for a cow that has been well cared for because it produces a better cut of meat.  
  
crops are much much harder to grow than you think especially on the scale we are talking, bad weather, diseases, just general low yield. with animals we have far better control over the quantity and quality, we have drugs that can cure many animals illnesses far better than we can a plants, we can breed as many as we are expected we will need plus extra. plus there isn't really a window when its possible to harvest the meat unlike plants.
