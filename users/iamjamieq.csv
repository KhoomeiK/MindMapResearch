Opportunity is getting a break because of specific circumstances. For example, you get a job at the best employer because of a parent or friend who has a connection to someone there. 

Eventually the result will be the same, but those who are given opportunities have to rely less on luck. Yes, they’re lucky to have that opportunity, but then they’re lucky to have the talent as well, and you can’t just say that luck is responsible for everything. Typically those with privilege (be it afforded by their race, wealth, etc) will be afforded opportunity while those without will tend to rely on luck."

IdiotsInCars,fek83j0,t1_fek527d,1579194576.0,"That is a good source. But take a look at this:

>Furthermore, essentially all studies upon which clinicians base their predictions of suicide risk after a suicide attempt contain two fundamental limitations: 1) subjects have not been specifically studied from their first lifetime (index) suicide attempts, but rather from first attempts made within a study period selected for convenience, and 2) first lifetime suicide attempts resulting in the subject’s death (and presentation to the coroner rather than the emergency department) are routinely ignored such that suicide risk for attempters has been systematically underestimated in the psychiatry literature.

>An example of a study that contains both of these limitations is the widely cited 2002 systematic review by Owens and colleagues (15). The authors considered 90 studies published in English after 1970 and restricted to “patients recruited to a study after attending a general hospital as a result of an episode of non-fatal self-harm and reported the proportion who repeated self-harm—fatally or not—for any follow-up period of at least a year.” They found a nonfatal 1-year reattempt rate of 15% and a fatal rate of 0.5%–2.0%, rising to more than 5% after 9 years (15). However, studies were included without specification of whether the presenting suicide attempt was the first, and those who died on first attempts were not included in analyses. Moreover, the systematic review pooled studies without distinction between convenience cohorts, cohorts restricted to particular methods, and cohorts inclusive of all methods. The review also did not distinguish between males and females, combining them into a single group in the analyses.

https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15070854?trendmd-shared=0&

That source very much admits that determining a rate of reattempt is actually incredibly difficult. Ad admittedly, while I found a couple sources citing the 80% number, I haven't found an initial source for it. The best conclusion, it seems, that can be gathered from the data available is that someone who has survived a suicide attempt will be at a vastly lower risk of reattempt if they received mental health care afterwards."

politics,feic70h,t1_feibkr4,1579135089.0,"You keep talking about the problems people face, and representation, but you have completely ignored that the electoral college doesn’t level the playing field at all. It just awards those who have land. What it says is that, even though a million people have the same opinions and beliefs, they don’t count as much as this hundred thousand people here because that million all live close to each other. The opinions and beliefs of the hundred thousand matter ten times more. That’s not fair representation at all, and continuing to say it does doesn’t make it so. The electoral college, by design, is an unfair system."
politics,feibsfu,t1_feiatye,1579134820.0,"Of course we agree on Congress, because it’s spelled out in the Constitution. 

I agree that Presidents have wielded too much executive power. The answer to that is not to continue utilizing an unfair system. It is to reign in executive power. 

I haven’t blown up my argument at all. Gubernatorial elections should be popular vote. Mayoral elections should be popular vote. And likewise, presidential elections should be popular vote. Again, you keep saying “population centers” like those cities don’t contain millions of people. Their votes should matter just as much as everyone else in the country. It doesn’t matter where someone lives, if they’re voting for president then their vote should be equal. But they aren’t. That’s reality. That’s exactly how it is. Your representation argument is bullshit because a) that’s not mentioned at all in the Constitution like it is for Congress, b) the way you think it works is still not equal representation, and c) the founding fathers never intended it to be a representative system at all. They created that system as a compromise because at the time the states were separate colonies, and they didn’t trust each other, so this system allowed states to have greater control. Also, information spread way slower, so people in New York May have never actually heard of a presidential candidate from South Carolina until he appeared on their ballot. 243 years later things are vastly different, and yet we continue to use a system that was thrown together to make sure the country actually got going, and some actually revere it as a good system. It isn’t, and wasn’t intended to be. It’s time for it to go.

politics,feiac7t,t1_fei8ddd,1579133848.0,"If the electoral college is a great system of representation, then why isn’t it used for any other executive office? Why isn’t it used in states when voting for governor? Individual districts could just send one electoral vote based on the popular winner. But no, governors are elected by popular vote. Same with mayors. Of course, by your argument, people who live in apartment buildings should have their vote for mayor count for a third or less than people who live in houses, especially if those houses are in neighborhoods with large lots. That makes no damn sense whatsoever. And it’s the exact same thing with the electoral college and voting for president."
politics,fei9lkj,t1_fei8ddd,1579133357.0,"The Congress is what’s supposed to represent the populace by geography. You keep mentioning representation in the executive, but that’s not the point of the executive. It doesn’t matter how many people live in a population center that all vote the same. They still matter just as much as all the rest of the people in the country. But the electoral college changes that entirely. Hell, even the way states handle electors completely abolishes any rational argument for representation. If a state votes 50.1% for one candidate and 49.9% for the other, the winning candidate gets all their electoral college votes. That’s not representation one bit. It’s a bullshit system that was designed specifically to prevent equal voting. Everything you keep saying ruins your own argument. 

At this point in America’s history, all the electoral college does it heavily weight the votes of people who live in sparsely populated states and heavily discount those who live in cities. And bullshit arguments like your “fair representation” one are what keeps it entrenched in our electoral system."

politics,fei6qbp,t1_fei62zk,1579131513.0,"This is the same tried phrase that right wingers have been using forever. Just because lots of people live in cities and tend to bite one way doesn’t make their votes any less valid. By reducing millions of people to a “population center”, you’ve now destroyed your own argument, because you’ve reduced the amount of representation they have a say in to a fraction of those who live in sparsely populated areas. 

The electoral college effectively favors those who own land. That doesn’t equate to more equal representation at all. But it does absolutely discriminate against tens of millions of people. And that’s part of why it was created. The Constitution was written at a time when the only people who mattered to those like the founding fathers were white, male land owners. We’ve undone the white and male things by enshrining voting rights as amendments. But for some reason this ludicrous “we shouldn’t let population centers decide elections” idea has been able to perpetuate for decades, and so we haven’t undone the land owning thing."
