ContraPoints,fdpunr7,t1_fdpck7f,1578641193.0,"You know, I once (very unsuccessfully) had a conversation adjacent to this topic with a fellow leftie on Facebook.

It started out as a discussion of 1984, where she claimed that the regime depicted was fascist. When I pointed out that said regime was at least in part based on Soviet Russia, she insisted that Soviet Russia was also fascist. So then I asked her what she meant by fascism, and the definition she gave boiled down to “anything authoritarian and repressive” and defined left-wing ideologies as inherently not that.

You’re trying to sell a very different point of view than she was trying to sell, but both of you are wrong to use the word fascism in this way. Authoritarianism is an aspect of fascism, but it is not fascist in and of itself even when it’s repressive. You can say that tankie ideology, were it ever implemented, would be repressive and bad and authoritarian, but it wouldn’t be fascist.

You can’t even call anarchism authoritarian because authoritarianism kind of requires there to be some kind of government that is asserting its authority, which anarchists generally reject. You can say that anarchism would be destructive if put into practice, but it would be neither fascist nor authoritarian.

You can say, if you want, that the strategies used by tankies and anarchists are destructive and violent, and fascists also use destructive and violent tactics, but that doesn’t make anarchists and tankies fascist. You don’t just get to use the word fascist to mean “things that are bad and that I disagree with”—when you do that, you’re just muddying the waters of political discourse.

(For the record, in the Facebook conversation I mentioned: when she gave her definition of fascism, I was a bit snarky and basically told her that if she wanted to debate the meaning of the word fascism in the context of 1984, she should go read Orwell’s essay Politics and the English Language, which, among other things, discusses precisely this kind of misuse of the word fascism. Then I got accused of academic gatekeeping and intellectual elitism. I think me arguing with her at all about her use of the word fascism made her assume that I had to be right-wing, which is very far from the truth indeed.)"

I suspect (but obviously cannot know) that Natalie felt like, after the previous outcry, she *had* to make a video explaining things. It’s not my preferred content either, but I think it was probably something she needed to do. I suspect that after cancelling part 2 (she seemed to be implying a part 2) she’ll go back to making the content she actually wants to make rather than social media drama."
ContraPoints,fdkfy3p,t1_fdkarf4,1578503041.0,"I know this isn’t what you’re saying and that I’m preaching to the choir here, but I think it’s disingenuous to look at that graph and call her following “dwindling”. It seems that there’s downs at the beginning of every month, but the numbers seem to climb back up steadily and overall the numbers seem pretty consistent since May or June or so.

I’d actually wonder whether this cancelling-boom will last. My vague instinct (for which I have absolutely zero evidence beyond vague intuition, so probably wrong lol) is that over the course of the next few months this spike will gradually even out and fall to a new equilibrium, which may well be higher than pre-cancelling patron-ship, but not massively so."

todayilearned,fctuj9f,t1_fctlrhc,1577960239.0,"It's to discredit her. ""Greta Thunberg has FAS, that's why she's so stupid and no-one should be listening to what she says.""

As evidence people take the general shape of her face (which, granted, has some traits that look FAS-like) and her generally straightforward, uncompromising demeanour, which people take as proof that she's aggressive, a well-known possible effect of FAS. From this they extrapolate that she's intellectually disabled, and we shouldn't be listening to her.

I mean, the obvious problem with this is that this is armchair diagnosing at its finest, and pretty damn condescending. But even if these people were correct, it wouldn't actually mean that Greta is \_wrong\_ about anything. Even if she has FAS, and \_even if\_ she is intellectually disabled (for which I see no evidence) her arguments could still be correct. Not to mention that the level of impairment caused by FASDs can vary quite significantly, so even if she did have FASD, that would not necessarily mean that she has any significant intellectual disability. Just like if she's autistic--yes, quite a few autistic people have intellectual disabilities, but many don't.

Of course the trolls might respond to that, ""But she's wrong and stupid, and she's wrong and stupid because she has FAS, obviously,"" which is circular reasoning at its finest. ""She's wrong because she has FAS, and we know she has FAS because she's wrong."""

“For example, Rumford Baking Powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid. With this acid, about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature. It then becomes dormant because an intermediate form of dicalcium phosphate is generated during the initial mixing. Further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140 °F (60 °C).[12]”"

As I said, we usually make mince pies or apple pies, though the apple pies are just made using puréed apples rather than apple slices, or anything like that.

My family is from Britain (hence the mince pies), but we’re Ashkenazi—not that I’ve heard of other Jews with similar recipes.

Edit: I think I've been told that we might have some Lithuanian ancestry, but it would be several generations back. No-one I actually know in the family is from anywhere near Lithuania."

BestOfOutrageCulture,f99l3m8,t1_f97rr7j,1575192272.0,"That’s not *exactly* what you said, though. You simply made a statement that some alleged progressives at the time praised the nazis/hitler because of how their policies were helping German industry (or something like that), from which a naive reader might get the impression that the nazis has legitimately progressive economic policies, which other progressives at the time praised. In fact, I know that that’s the impression one might get, because that was the impression I would have walked away with if mrxulski hadn’t pointed out that what alleged progressives at the time were actually all hot and bothered about was that Marxists were being killed, because they hated Marxists. It’s an important piece of context, and if you leave it out, people can get the wrong impression about history."
