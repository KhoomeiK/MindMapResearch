In the old legacy cannon they had issues cloning force sensitive individuals & having those clones retain sensitivity or force ability. Of course that got ""fixed"" later.

The one thing that really throws everything for a loop is the will of the force. The force does not like being meddeled with and finds a way to self correct it seems. When the dark grows stronger the RNG chance of the light side winning grows lol."

bipolar,fdzxyy3,t3_enc4g6,1578798542.0,Personally I cant stand medication. I find that adding exercise to my health regiment with a focus on strength training and cardio is one of the best things I've done. I take minimal doses of my medications at this point. Exercise will yield results in energy and feelings of well being if you go into it with the intent to train every day to be the best you can be (not overdoing it of course).
bipolar,fdmev2j,t3_em56h3,1578547593.0,"I've never had an issue. I've been in and out for work for years. Always different professions however. I've personally always demonstrated a willingness to work hard and made a point of speaking about my core values in interviews. Doesn't hurt that I'm a fairly charming person however :)  


Seems to work."
