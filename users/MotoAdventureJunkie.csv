depression,ff57ffu,t3_erpod9,1579582418.0,That is hard to process sorry to hear that
BreakUps,fetzxuh,t3_eqmb2m,1579381736.0,I’m 30m and I lost my wife of 5years two months ago. She has fallen out of love for me as well. I have been destroyed since and have gone through all kinds of ups and downs. I broke no contact today because I could not handle it anymore. Obviously nothing changed and now I feel just as devastated as I did before. I knew better but couldn’t keep from putting my hand in the fire. I feel your pain. I don’t know how I will get through this but I hope you do.
lexington,fep9gkn,t3_eq94jo,1579315129.0,I used to a lot. Don’t have one currently. I’m assuming you do?
povertyfinance,feh1wwi,t3_eow8fl,1579107430.0,I appreciate the kind words from everyone. Has given me something more to hold on to. Hopefully there’s a light somewhere in the darkness.
BreakUps,fefkwwi,t3_eowim7,1579058507.0,I feel that. Choose my own exit
NHLHUT,fdyjup8,t1_fdy5d27,1578780589.0,A stat based system doesn’t mean better haha. 95+ skating speed bs 86-91 is a huge difference. That’s what he’s talking about. We all know better cards just have better physics period. That’s what makes it less fun for people who can’t dumb there parents money into packs
BreakUps,fdmllmo,t1_fdme335,1578554567.0,I was verified manually. I sent a second message so maybe that would help. Hope you get in. Message me if not and I’ll make sure it happens.
BreakUps,fdm8ceu,t1_fdm84jw,1578542313.0,Ugh the desires to give up is so strong. It’s been two months for me. We were married 4 years and I fucked it all up. I just want to not hurt anymore.
BreakUps,fdm81qz,t3_em2odj,1578542097.0,Man I’m trying but its hard. Not being able to find a job hasn’t helped me at all :(
lonely,fdjfy0d,t3_elp8gc,1578469117.0,"I turned 30 on dec 11th. 
I spent it 100% alone. 
Didn’t do a thing but sit in a apartment.
My wife and I had separated in November and I moved to a whole new state because I had nowhere else to go. 
I feel you but I hope you find a way to enjoy it in some small way."
depression,fdiz5v0,t3_elmuy3,1578454413.0,"Brother I can understand where your at. I’m 30 as well and life has gotten pretty Bleak for me since my wife wanted to separate about 2 moths ago. I made some pretty stupid decisions between there as well. Drove a thousand miles to a new state to stay with a friend because I had no where else to go (was living with my wife’s father because she was going back to school).  Then a week later drive back to try to figure things out and made things worse while I was there. Had to drive back to my friends place and have been there since. Still unemployed because I haven’t found a job yet and running out of my savings. It’s pretty much a shit sandwich and I’m ready to just kill myself because this just seems all to much. 

Hopefully you find a way out of it for yourself. I wish you strength and luck."
BreakUps,fdfo72a,t1_fdeoaey,1578366238.0,Man I’m not sure where you are finding your strength. I really hope you do make it out of whatever your trying to climb from. You at least have a job. I’m still unemployed and it’s just feeling like treading water and I’m on my last few kicks.
lonely,fdfni5q,t1_fdflr77,1578365785.0,I mean I clinging to hope as stupid as I know it is but I think it’s over for her. No contact and has removed me from all social media. Said hurtful things in last conversation and wants nothing from me or to know me ever again.
lonely,fdflmyo,t3_el4svd,1578364563.0,That’s tuff. I can be this way too. Lost my wife because I’m a idiot and now all I want is her back but I screwed it completely.
BreakUps,fdf6gi2,t3_el2cma,1578354398.0,Right there with you man.
Divorce,fdea4ba,t3_ekmy5k,1578334528.0,So I now live In Kentucky after my separation. Originally from Texas. My friend lives here and I came to stay with him cause I had nowhere else to go. I’ve actually met two people from Reddit that live here in Kentucky since my separation. There really great people and have been helping me a lot. Feel free to message me if you want to talk man.
NoFap,fddg5lm,t3_eksgbb,1578310801.0,Your not missing anything. I honestly wish I never would have had sex early. Or learned about masturbating early. I’ve had a lot of good sex and I was spoiled early too because my first was highly sexual and we were together for a few years. You know what sex and masturbation got me? I’m 30 just got divorced and I’m more pain and loneliness than ever In my life. Be grateful for the position your in. You should go to the gym get ripped as fuck. Work on a career. Save some some fucking money if you do nothing else. Learn to love yourself and then worry about someone who can add to your life. Everything else I’d horse shit and you can’t take any of it when you die anyway.
insomnia,fddc8vc,t3_ekqf4q,1578305236.0,It’s because your using more calories then your body wants to in a given 24hr period and not sleeping isn’t allowing the body the recovery process that happens in sleep. Plus if your diet is bad already then your just compounding negatives.
BreakUps,fdd1s90,t3_ekpxgy,1578291380.0,Been two months for me and I still fight this battle everyday. Sorry my friend
Divorce,fdcjukm,t3_ekmy5k,1578276693.0,Sorry brother a lot of us in the same place. Is the Ky For Kentucky or something else?
lonely,fd6k5ch,t3_ek6jqe,1578192256.0,What are the things you love that people thing are foolish wastes of energy?
lonely,fd6jxau,t3_ek6luw,1578192172.0,I’m sorry that happened to you. While I think good sexual chemistry is great and a healthy sex drive is great. I’m sorry that the people you were with seemed to only want a quick physical dopamine hit and that’s all. I hope you are getting better or have gotten better. Feel free to message me if you ever want to chat. I’ve recently go my divorced from my wife and have been going through a lot myself so conversations can sometimes be helpful. Sending kindness your way.
BreakUps,fd3aes1,t3_ejyk7f,1578156348.0,Thank you. This was really good and resonated with me.
Harley,fd39l47,t3_ejyk9e,1578156049.0,Dude that helmet is sick. Stop conforming to people. If you truly just don’t like it that’s one thing but if someone convinced you that Helmet doesn’t belong on a Harley then maybe consider why you even bought the bike in the first place. If it’s to fill some kind of image factor then your gonna be let down no matter what. Bet proud of who you are always and never do anything unless it’s what you have decided for yourself. Sick bike and sick helmet. Get out there and ride brotha!
BreakUps,fczww6z,t3_ejqbj5,1578110009.0,"Truth. I think it’s partly that human nature wants a tribe for survival instincts. A tribe can easily become just two people when you spend enough time with them. Losing her I feel like I’ve lost my ability to survive in this world. I don’t know if that will ever change, if I’ll find it on my own, or I’ll just find another tribe. I’m pretty lost all together but I’m trying to understand my faults and maybe find a way to get better and move forward with life. It’s hard. It may be hard for the rest of my life idk."
Divorce,fcye4he,t1_fcwr7t3,1578078727.0,Yea I didn’t have this planned for my future at all. Nothing in my life seems to be where it was planned at all. Feeling quite lost. Maybe it’s more about the fact that I never followed through with any of the plans I made. I guess I need to start there and be more honest with myself
Divorce,fcydtw7,t1_fcwo31u,1578078582.0,That’s tuff but yea I get it.
Divorce,fcwf1a7,t1_fcwefc6,1578023960.0,We split in November. Haven’t even spoken about the divorce part yet. We have been no Contact since. It’s really hard and I know it’s going to worse before it gets better. I don’t want to be alone either. I don’t have really any family left and only a few friends but don’t even live around them now.
awakened,fcum02k,t3_ej0lss,1577983908.0,Dreams are just a imaginary movie in your mind that only you get to watch.
NoFap,fctclwv,t3_eit48f,1577939062.0,"Your post doesn’t make sense and contradicts itself. Not sure if you didn’t put the right word in some places or just didn’t have your thought together. 

Anyway good luck with no PMO"
depression,fco611m,t3_ei8f5q,1577824746.0,Will be doing the same. Hope your night is good as well and hope you have a good year.
lonely,fco1au2,t3_ei7vms,1577822280.0,I’m gonna be alone.
lonely,fco11zc,t3_ei7wvn,1577822165.0,I’ll be alone. Don’t know if that’s gonna make me happy but it’s what I got right now.
depression,fc2twe9,t3_efwfmf,1577373915.0,Feel this so much
depression,fbyr8l4,t3_ef7k6a,1577224199.0,Well I’ll be all alone as well here in Kentucky. Wish my situation was different but it’s not. Hope you feel better. I recently got out of a long term relationship and I feel quite lost as well
SuicideWatch,fbt7lv4,t3_eeelht,1577070485.0,I know it does. Welcome to message if you want to chat.
