nfl,feuj8mi,t1_feuaqk5,1579387028.0,"This one annoys me the most. 

Offense doing jack shit. 

Kicker/special teams has scored 4 FGS. 

Defense holds other team to only 2 touchdowns. 

Score is 12-14. 

Game winning FG is missed, but only the kicker is blamed not the offense for doing fuck all."
pathofexile,femhv5a,t1_fem3gda,1579256363.0,Same lol I don’t think I’ve gone past 2 Vaal orbs on any I’ve tried corrupting
subnautica,fej7mkx,t1_feivrtg,1579160310.0,I stopped... and did a 180 and noped the fuck out LOL
pathofexile,fe9q0tq,t1_fe9lh3w,1578940407.0,Just depends on the person. Someone did that for me and it made the game so much fun for me. Gave me more inspiration and made me learn why the gear/build worked the way it did.
nfl,fe6ih1l,t1_fe5m6lq,1578891937.0,"It was the opposite for me. Not a fan but Wanted the Texans to win. Wasn’t planning on watching because no way in hell Texans beat the chiefs. I missed the first quarter  when Texans where up 21-0. Join in and see them kick that field goal and up 24-0. Then all of a sudden it’s half time and it’s 28-24 chiefs l lol 

Anytime when a team has a huge lead they always seem to blow it the moment I start watching. Lol I’m not superstitious but I’m starting to believe it might be lol"
pathofexile,fe08i70,t3_en58wi,1578805958.0,"Yo man love this guide! I copied your passive tree and skill gem setups. Been testing what this build can do. So far i'm using just rares  items and two cold iron daggers and i'm still wrecking face on t15/16 awakaner lvl 7. Love how tanky it is when i slap on a shield!

If you have any other builds you've done in the past i'd love to see them too!"
LivestreamFail,fdztpak,t1_fdyoaah,1578795558.0,This game was truly great for its time
pathofexile,fdnr33m,t1_fdnj2j8,1578591190.0,I encountered my first scammer the other night. I was trying to buy a hyrris ire 6L to complete one of my builds. I knew it was too good to be true when I saw a near perfectly rolled for 2ex cheaper than just a normal 6L And it was when the guy dropped a similar rolled chest with only 4L.
pathofexile,fdehrug,t1_fddn7yi,1578339301.0,My cyclone slayer just drooled lol
pathofexile,fdehn2z,t1_fddilw8,1578339218.0,It’s why I love the guild I’m in. We are a small bunch of noobs (even tho we play a lot lol)  but we help each other out with currency and crafts.
PathOfExileBuilds,fcl8vf7,t1_fchokn4,1577742332.0,"yea i switched to CoC Ice Nova Assassin since i got 1 cospris to drop and bought another one. I melt maps, and hwo that my gem lvls are higher doing better against bosses.

I'll prob revisit Cobra Lash later, its a good league starter, but need to find a way to be more defensive for next time"
PathOfExileBuilds,fcbuvl8,t1_fcbupfs,1577591238.0,"LOL i hate it when he places the cyclone on the stairs.

That fight isn't even good, its just a bunch of bullshit."
PathOfExileBuilds,fcbtvhs,t1_fcbtpaw,1577590918.0,"Yea I can kill stuff pretty fast, but the 1 shots make it very annoying, and i rarely stand long in 1 place."
PathOfExileBuilds,fcbto2g,t1_fcbtk5i,1577590848.0,I might give it a try then.
PathOfExileBuilds,fcbt928,t1_fcbt2nv,1577590716.0,what lvl do you have your Steelskin and CWDT?
pathofexile,fcaslbr,t1_fc7i6xg,1577575794.0,"If you have time, do you mind helping me out with my [cobra lash] (https://pastebin.com/P7EpVgkV) setup?

I do lots of damage, but i feel super squishy and get randomly 1 shot, even tho i try and move around alot and tend to dodge most attacks."
PathOfExileBuilds,fca4xnm,t1_fca4k3m,1577563113.0,Yea I think it’s that fact that bosses/enemies hit harder now.
bipolar,fc8895d,t1_fc6z5ab,1577529085.0,"I took the lowest dosage and nothing happened, took I think like 200mg and felt so great and focused just super tired all the time. Then all Of a sudden I started getting really drained and overheat.

I miss how calm and focused my mind was on seroquel, wish it didn’t cause my body to reject it tho ."
aww,fc0b300,t1_fc0azn2,1577285552.0,"Nothing frustrates me more than a bad teacher. One of my TA's that taught my physics lab was a freaking genius, but was absolutely horrible at explaining things."
aww,fbzezbr,t1_fbzex3v,1577244476.0,Lol exploded/ignited various gasses.
aww,fbzessr,t1_fbyvhfv,1577244303.0,"Not gonna lie my high school chem teacher is what really sparked my interest in science. 

We did so many awesome experiments. We exploded, lit on fire, used acids, mixed so many chemicals with weird/cool effects. 

I’m now finishing my physics degree thx to him."
modernwarfare,fbj0x7a,t1_fbidd5a,1576921701.0,Yea I got called a “camping noob” for defending point B on SnD. Like what do you want me to do? Let you plant the bomb? Lmao
