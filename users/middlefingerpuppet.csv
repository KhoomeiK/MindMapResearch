Her polling numbers were dropping so she decided to take a risky gambit and now it's blowing up in her face. If she had consulted anyone outside of her bubble of precious Masters program yespeople and ex-Clinton advisors, she might have come to realize what an obviously dumb idea it was. 

Politics 101 = shake any and every hand that's extended to you, always, every single time. In fact, compete to make your handshake look more confident than the other guy's. She failed this most basic political task, on TV, in front of millions of viewers in a debate platform designed expressly to tear down Bernie. Wooof. It's not hard to imagine that her inner circle of advisory dweebs all decided ahead of the debate that she should make a show of not shaking Bernie's hand, as a display of Woman Empowerment or whatever internal buzzword they're using. Inescapably bad optics that perfectly encapsulate the whole faux controversy of her claim that Bernie said a woman will never be elected to the WH, despite decades of documentation of Bernie saying the exact opposite. 

I suppose she's very accomplished within the catty, backbiting, cloistered halls of Congress, where all interactions are confined to predictable formats and rules. She probably excels in that environment. As I've gotten to see more of EW in action, though, it scares me to think how she would react to any kind of unscripted conflict with a foreign power, such as China or Russia."
