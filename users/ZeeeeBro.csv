ChoosingBeggars,fefbo8h,t1_feeyxx3,1579052785.0,"I was helping this guy who was with his two children at this wine store I used to work at. Usually if I can get a response from a customers then I can be a bit friendlier back and maybe strike up a small conversations. You know, simple retail stuff. But he didnt respond to the ""hello, hey ya doing?"" or the follow up ""how's your day going"". He didnt say anything, so I assume it's just another non talker. Whatever not a big deal. So I say nothing else besides if he had rewards, his total and the exit comment. As Im loading his 12 bottles of wine into his box he's giving me this kinda mean, rude look. I dont think anything of it really. Honestly I was just kinda day dreaming at this point and in auto pilot mode. As I finish the transaction. He turns to me, gets close to my face and says, ""This is the part where you say THANK YOU."" I snapped outta auto pilot mode cause this was very unusual thing to be said to me. It was quite rude actually. So I just look at him with a confused look and say, ""Uhh have a good day sir."" He rolls his eyes and pushes his cart off.

I think to myself, damn he was rude. About 3 min later my manager blocks off my lane. Uh oh this usually happens if something happened. She told me that guy complained iI was rude and dropping his bottles into the cart like I didnt care and had a rude face on. I was totally confused cause I was liek which guy? The last guy? He was rude to me actually. And she then look confused and I told everything that happened. And Im like if thinks me placing bottles into the box from 6 inches high is haphazardly handling them then he shouldnt find out how they get shipped across the sea. I didnt get in trouble and she apologized.
