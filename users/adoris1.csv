WatchPeopleDieInside,ff7suug,t1_ff7qubr,1579657532.0,"Lmao. A bad call gave us exactly one extra win this year (first Lions game) - while a bad no-call arguably cost us another (Eagles game). It's not like we went 9-7 and squeaked in, we went 13-3 and got a BYE. The idea that we were lucky to make the playoffs is absurd. Strong case we were the 2nd best team in the NFC."
nfl,ff1w80j,t1_ff1vsbt,1579487582.0,"Remember when an r/NFL Vikings game thread was invaded by glib Packers fans, even though the Pack had already been eliminated and lost both H2H matchups in convcing fashion? Me neither.

nfl,fe6l5h8,t1_fe6acp5,1578894547.0,Show me the picture showing he was down behind the sticks. The sticks were slightly BEFORE the 36.
nfl,fe6kw39,t1_fe6cvs5,1578894287.0,"That's not how reviews on ball placement work. You don't challenge inches, you challenge outcomes. The relevant question is: ""Regardless of whether the spot was exactly right, is it true that he passed X line?""

Exhibit A was literally earlier in this same game. Packers challenged a fumble that was ruled down on the field. Replay showed it was in fact a fumble, proving the Packers right that the refs had made a mistake. But because they (laughably) ruled there was no clear recovery, they couldn't swing possession, and therefore *the ruling on the field stood.* The Packers lost a timeout, despite one aspect of the ruling on the field being proven wrong.

Likewise, the refs in this case weren't reviewing whether the spot was exact, only reviewing whether he got the first down. The yellow line's accuracy is extremely relevant to whether he did."
nfl,fe6kgq7,t1_fe68qby,1578893858.0,That wasn't the real line. The only view from the actual orange marker made it look like he got it.
nfl,fe6k88h,t1_fe6dpoj,1578893624.0,But you can't see from where the camera is shooting due to the lack of near side hash marks. It isn't parallel with the opposite field marker.
nfl,fe6bcx9,t1_fe6ax3j,1578886105.0,"The play clock is called the same for every team, just like holding and hard-count free plays. Rodgers + Packers are smart enough to know the exact boundary and strategize accordingly.

Also, Rodgers has been eliminated from the playoffs on three occasions in which he worked late game heroics to tie it up, then lost the OT coin toss and never touched the ball again. His offenses have also put up more points per game in the playoffs than Tom Brady's offenses, only to watch his defense cough up leads. The idea that he has been anything other than extremely unfortunate in the playoffs is blind hater revisionism."
nfl,fe6asf8,t1_fe6ajeo,1578885688.0,"Lmaooooo you're so full of shit. The refs are the reason this game was as close as it was. ""No clear recovery"" my ass.

You got beat by a better team. You honestly reminded me of the Packers a few years back, because no Seahawk besides your QB is impressive."
nfl,fe6ak8n,t1_fe6ae6b,1578885523.0,Thank you
nfl,fe6adey,t1_fe6944u,1578885385.0,"San Fran scares me, but our d-line and box is built for power running games. Clark, Lowry, and the Smiths are tough to push around, and Martinez + Amos are reliable tacklers. Not underestimating you, but let's just say I hope you beat the Chiefs."
nfl,fe68leq,t1_fe67yrn,1578884163.0,"This did not ""decide the game"" lol. It woulda been 4th and inches from the 35. We either kick a fg or go for it. Coulda converted, or coulda gone up 8, when the Seahawks have no timeouts left. A lot woulda had to go wrong for Seahawks to win even if the ruling were overturned.

Whereas, a turnover in their own territory is a massive potential points swing."
nfl,fe68cqq,t1_fe67w2w,1578884015.0,Wut? Neither of those things are true lol. They punted then we went 3 and out and also punted. Cost us an easy fg attempt.
nfl,fe67x2r,t1_fe67q8p,1578883759.0,This isn't set up.
nfl,fe67w34,t1_fe67qbm,1578883743.0,Lol. You realize the refs cost us a turnover right?
nfl,fe67q61,t3_env82r,1578883650.0,The fumble in the first quarter was a much more egregious swing in Seahawks favor.
nfl,fe67nmy,t3_env82r,1578883612.0,"Original spot was generous, but he was within 6 inches of the line. Very close."
nfl,fe67fv0,t3_env82r,1578883484.0,"I think he's like 1 foot short of the yellow line, but idk how accurate that is."
nfl,fe664m9,t1_fe66276,1578882643.0,I think they wanted the 5 yards for the punt.
GreenBayPackers,fe62umx,t3_envf9i,1578880535.0,That was not a confidence-inspiring quarter by the defense. Rodgers might need to win a shootout after all.
nfl,fe5zniq,t1_fe5zbkr,1578878503.0,"No, Packers lost a clear turnover in scoring range, and the only 2 against the Seahawks have been both borderline and much less consequential. I was expecting this game to be close, and it may still be, but they're lucky to only be down 18."

nfl,fe5ysil,t1_fe5yob3,1578877958.0,"No, we were out of timeouts, and woulda got penalized for taking one we didn't have  either way."
nfl,fe5szo2,t1_fe5rkjr,1578874274.0,"True. But ironically, the Packers run game wasn't good that year either until the postseason. Brandon Jackson was  not great. Playoffs is when we discovered James Starks."
nfl,fe5sjhp,t1_fe5rkzw,1578873999.0,"Sadly, it isn't my Daddy's Packer's passing offense either."
nfl,fe5s82h,t1_fe5rnhg,1578873809.0,It deprived us of 50 yards on the punt.
nfl,fe5s6ks,t1_fe5rnj5,1578873786.0,The Seahawks match up much better against them than the Packers do. Rodgers' Achilles heel is teams that can get pressure rushing just four.

nfl,fdd3brl,t1_fdcuq00,1578293068.0,I am pleased to hear you think so and wish I had such confidence.  To me it's a coin flip.
nfl,fdd37k7,t1_fdcb5bo,1578292937.0,"I am firmly convinced that any of this year's playoff teams (besides maybe the Ravens) could easily lose to any other of this year's playoff teams. Pick a matchup, play it 10 times, and rarely would either side win more than 7. There's mega parity behind Baltimore and it makes the whole thing more exciting."
nfl,fdc81j8,t1_fdc1k4l,1578268914.0,"You used a lot of ink to demonstrate something I never contested (he's been just okay this year) and ignored the point I made about it being his first season in a new offense with bad wrs. His mediocrity this season is not necessarily proof that his physical or mental skills have significantly fallen off from, say, 2016-7, when he looked like the best in the league. He's only 36.

But also, imagine dismissing passer rating as arbitrary, and then citing QBR lol. What do you work for ESPN? Yes, passer rating was invented in the 70s. It's stuck around since then since the numbers it spits out by and large match the eye test + intuitive, volume adjusted assessment of a QBs stat line, without the small sample-size, statistically illiterate emphasis on ""big moments"" that QBR overrates.

Anyway...if the Pack get a legit #2 target and a full offseason to work out the kinks, and Rodgers still looks like the 8-15th best QB instead of a top 5 next year, we'll know he's no longer elite, as opposed to just transitioning in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year."

nfl,fdbscaw,t1_fdadvbd,1578261186.0,"I agree he wasn't elite this season (merely above average) but you discredited important indicators for no reason, then provided cherry-picked misleading stats that don't matter as much. Rodgers throws the ball away on purpose to avoid sacks or risky throws more than other qbs (hurting completion percentage, but avoiding interceptions, which is almost always smart) and the yards after catch is directly related to a new offense that emphasizes dumping off to running backs often.  He also has no legit #2 option behind Adams, who missed 4 games this year. 

He's missed some throws, sure, but there's good reason to be optimistic Rodgers will be much better (perhaps returning to elite status) in year 2 of Lafleur's system."

nfl,fd75c5o,t1_fd71kyp,1578199629.0,"I can. And I'm not sure whether to root for it being the Bears or not. 

On one hand, it makes our enemies better, and risks humiliation + more Packers losses. On the other hand, I truly think Brady's on the downslope and would love to watch Zardarius Smith make his life suck while Rodgers and Co. beats him twice a year until he retires.
