Maybe she doesn’t want to go to a burger restaurant with her sisters because it is Tuesday and that is all there is to do?

I think turning 50 can become a huge deal to some people, but especially to females. You are approaching or going through the menopause, and that signifies a huge shift. Mentally and emotionally. Part of your life that defines most of your path in life during that time is over. Kids are grown. Visible ageing accelerates fast. 

The overspending could be depression too. 

Maybe she is just a bitch. But maybe she feels old, invisible and as though her kids and husband no longer see her as a person, but only as a mum and carer. So she wants some fancy boots and to feel fun again. Not to do the same thing she does every year. 

She doesn’t know about the surprises. She thinks no one is making much effort for a special birthday. So you can’t judge her as being ungrateful for stuff she doesn’t know about."

I get home, he grabs a shoe or my coat, makes eye contact and runs off with it! He always runs straight to his bed and leaves it there.

lastimages,fehao27,t1_feh7h1n,1579112645.0,"I’ll be honest. I reached a time in my life - I was in a steady relationship and almost 30, when I wanted two things from him:


To find out why he refused to have contact with us after his divorce, to the extent that he wouldn’t answer my sisters letters or acknowledge birthdays etc


To be as ok as I could be with everything when he died. I didn’t want to wish I’d said something or had a relationship again. 


The second sounds somewhat blunt but I’d had therapy and knew I needed some closure/answers to not forever berate myself. 
You mention this subject and I think it is worth having a serious think about it. I knew I needed to talk to him and put everything in my past. I was very lucky in that he took total responsibility for his shitty behaviour and apologised. It could have gone very differently. I think if I hadn’t made peace AFTER QUESTIONS AND HIM ACKNOWLEDGING FAILINGS then I would have been far more screwed up by his death. 
Had he not had such a positive response to our talk I don’t think I would have made peace and my anger would have been much more problematic. 
Think carefully about stuff. I did it when I was settled and had lots of support. I couldn’t have done it before then."

youseeingthisshit,fdxyy19,t3_en6hv8,1578774301.0,"I know most people read this as him being over precious about his piano, but I wonder if he was actually concerned for the safety of Keys and her baby

He seems exceptionally anxious rather than angry. And whilst that might be because he is worried about his piano being damaged, I would expect to see more irritation or agitation. He claps at the end and seems relieved. But if this was about damage there would be no relief until he had examined the piano. 

His body language reads as a sudden fear response to me. His initial realisation of what she is doing and looking around to confirm that others also see this. 

Then his clapping at the end when, I presume, she was either standing or perhaps seemed in a safer position. 

Prince’s baby son died when he was only six days old. He was born desperately unwell and his parents had to watch him deteriorate and pass. I don’t think that trauma ever leaves you and I can completely imagine that it would instill a heightened anxiety response if he saw a baby or pregnant woman at risk of harm. She climbs onto the piano, probably in heels and risks falling and hurting the baby. 

The cost of the piano was loose change to him. He lived to entertain and was a showman. Would he really be that upset by an friend climbing onto his piano during a performance? Or would he be, more likely, suddenly very worried about her falling and her baby being hurt?"
NoStupidQuestions,fdvx56s,t1_fdt2ec5,1578752706.0,"I agree. Also it does seem ludicrous that they refused to live in their quarters at Kensington Palace because it wasn’t big enough for them. So they had Frogmore Cottage refurbished and totally remodelled at great public expense.

Why should he be brave for his friends?why should he have to use his emotional energy for their good?

And no. He doesn’t need to spend his time doing as many good deeds others as possible. His life is closing. This is HIS time. Not a Hollywood movie or his job to touch others lives being inspirational and kind to others. 

If he wants to sit and eat burgers, watching porn and getting high on painkillers. Let him. Ffs. Indulge him. Make it his best time. 
He should not be having to comfort them or easing the memory of his passing by creating Instagram worthy anecdotes for others to whore out. 

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE BRAVE OR GRACEFUL!

OP:

Try not to shut out your loved ones. They will take comfort in being with you and helping you 

But really, do what you need to get through it as painlessly as possible. I mean that literally and figuratively. 

Having been involved in cancer treatment, end of life nursing and care and palliative medicine, my advice would be to seek out professionals. 

The Teenage Cancer Trust (I’m using them as an example - I don’t think you have cancer) were amazing with young people (up to 25yrs) and helping them deal with emotions and practical issues. 

Hospice care and palliative care teams are actually very helpful. I found the hospice I did some training in to be full of light, love and lots of practical help. 
It might be easier and more helpful to talk to professionals. Then you can say what you want without feeling you have to be considerate of your loved ones feelings and they will have lots of experience dealing with these kind of issues. If you can find a young person specific hospice/team/organisation, I think they will be the most helpful. 

I wish you restful nights and easy days. 
Take care. Look after yourself as much as you want to look after others. And if you can, let them help. Caring and nurturing those in need are important ways to process grief and show love. 

But if someone is sucking the energy and light from your life, ask for help from other friends/family or your medical team in minimising their contact with you. You do not have to cater fore everyone’s feelings. This is your time. We are used to dealing with relatives as much as dealing with our patients. In end of life care we are helping our patient first and foremost, but also their loved ones."
