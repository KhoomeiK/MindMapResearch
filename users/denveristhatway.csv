BlackPeopleTwitter,felb4dc,t1_fela8ch,1579218040.0,You’re missing the point. This isn’t a black culture thing. My best childhood friend was Arab. His parents came over from Jordan. There were so many aunties and Amos that weren’t related in their “family”. I have 3 aunts that are just my moms close friends. My Korean neighbors had the same thing going on. I grew up in a very diverse neighborhood and could go on but I hope you see the point. You just sound like you want to be upset.

Secondly, I find it questionable to eat at a buffet due to the studies I’ve read in regards to cleanliness and sanitary conditions of buffets. It has nothing to do with what you’re eating rather where you’re eating. I will not judge you if you eat at one, but I will never eat at a buffet. Gymnastics? Probably.
