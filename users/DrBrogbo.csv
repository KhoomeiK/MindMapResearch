You might have missed the context there.

They're saying that if that's the worst thing kids do (compared to the horrible shit kids used to do - huffing paint, smoking weed, using ecstasy, drinking booze, popping pills, etc.), it's not as big a deal as people are making it out to be.

It's being realistic about a problem. You can **not** prevent *all* kids from doing anything bad ever, so at least the things they're getting up to aren't all that bad compared to how they used to be. Abstinence-only would be the best option for sure, but let's be real here."

TFA Apple Tart Green - 2.7%

TFA Honeydew - 5%

FA Strawberry (Red Touch) - 1.5%

TFA Strawberry (Ripe) - 3.5%

For pods, I've tried multiplying those percentages by 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2x, but I tend to hover around 1.5-1.75 depending on how I'm feeling. If you have a fairly numb tongue like I do, 1.75 might be your sweet spot, but I'd suggest starting at 1.5 and tweaking from there."

I like my flavors strong, so I found increasing sub-ohm recipes by 50% is a good place to start, but sadly not all recipes work well in pods.

If their goal with the Series X were to push all the bells and whistles to target 1080P/30, then yeah, old consoles would be left in the dust, but personally I'd rather play at a higher resolution and framerate with lesser quality than at a lower resolution and framerate with higher quality.

It took a few attempts to get everyone on-board, but now my friends and family know I don't do things on my birthday. I eat dinner with my parents sometime around my birthday, but the day itself is mine and mine alone. I get some delicious food and watch one of my favorite movies, but otherwise it's just another day.

Unless of course you like celebrating your birthday but just aren't comfortable in certain social situations, in which case ignore me."
Games,fcyjjmk,t3_ehng4m,1578081129.0,"For my list, I focused mostly on the games I enjoy playing the most, even still. Not in any particular order.

* **Terraria** - This is one of my favorite games of all time. I've put over 1,000 hours in to it, and I still enjoy the base game enough to fire it up and play all the way through Moon Lord every once in a while.

* **Super Stardust Ultra** - Yes, this is an update to a PS3 game from 2007, but they added enough new things that I count it as its own game, and it's fantastic. I still play it regularly with friends, and I still try to increase my ranking on the worldwide leaderboard.

* **Dark Souls 1** - Classic game. It sort of falls apart in the latter half, but it's still an amazing game that more or less defined an entire genre. Beautifully-detailed world, with just-punishing-enough gameplay.

* **Dark Souls 3** - An even better whole than the first game, in my opinion. Sort of a Dark Souls Greatest Hits, with much more fluidity thanks to Bloodborne. Speaking of which...

* **Bloodborne** - I was nervous when Miyazaki announced he was stepping away from the Souls formula for the next game, but good LORD did he ever deliver. Brutal, fast-paced combat wrapped in a gorgeously disgusting game world.

* **7 Days to Die** - Yeah, it's a bit janky and they keep changing up the formula, but very few games have been able to suck me in like this one does on a regular basis. I've started play sessions with friends that lasted literally 12 hours, during which time we would take breaks to go pick up food, then come back and play more.

* **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons** - This is NOT a game you can re-play over and over, but no book, show, movie, song, or game has *ever* hit me as hard as this one did. Unbelievably powerful, and I will still vividly remember it on my death bed.

* **Overload** - Descent is one of my favorite childhood games, and Overload is the absolute perfect way to re-imagine it. Spot-on controls, fantastic music, great level/enemy desigh, and it's made by several of the original Descent programmers.

* **Surge 2** - A fairly recent addition, but I loved the Surge 1, and 2 is better in every single way. It's faster, more fluid, has much better level design, and the story is better as well.

* **Last Of Us** - Another emotional masterpiece. This one also hit me hard, and it was often jaw-droppingly beautiful (Remastered version on PS4) and hauntingly sad.

HONORABLE MENTIONS

* **Hexcells Infinite** - Minesweeper perfected. No more stupid guessing, more complex puzzles, and a structured campaign mode as well as infinite generation.

* **Portal 2** - Fantastic single player campaign as well as a fantastic separate co-op campaign. Some frustrating later puzzles, but very clever, and very funny.

* **SOMA** - A sci-fi horror game that tells an astoundingly human story. I was merely enjoying it until the halfway point, when I suddenly couldn't put it down. I'm still pondering the ethical ramifications of some of my decisions, and regretting them (despite feeling they were the right ones at the time). Gorgeous world/sound design as well."
movies,fcyfbnu,t3_ejfthi,1578079210.0,"Pink Panther Strikes Again - The laughing gas scene. Either that or Tom Hanks having a breakdown by the bathtub in The Money Pit.

Both of those scenes crack me up, despite me having seen them dozens of times."
Games,fcy9yfh,t1_fcy9m0p,1578076864.0,"I skipped SFV and Them's Fightin' Herds (not a big fan of fighting games). Grip is actually the one I'm most excited for, since it reminds me of Rollcage Stage II, one of my favorite PS1 games ever.

They did a good job with variety this time around."
Games,fcy80sn,t1_fcy6wrr,1578076081.0,"Seriously. The 2 to skip out on this time are easy to choose, and among the rest, I'm very excited about 4, and the rest look worth a try. 

Even if I weren't grandfathered in, I'd have no issue paying $20 for the big package this month."

I agree, though, I get a burger when I want a burger, I just want burritos more often, so there's more likelihood that that becomes the Presidential food moreso than burgers."
todayilearned,fcxle07,t1_fcxcko4,1578065749.0,"As a big fat American, it always seemed weird to me how McDonald's and the White House were so tightly connected. If I were the President, I would want something like In 'n Out, Smash Burger, Five Guys, or The Habit over McD's. Don't get me wrong, the Big Mac is a good burger, it's just not anywhere near my first choice. Honestly, I'd rather have a big old carne asada burrito over any burger, but that might not go over so well with the more xenophobic of our citizens."

Games,fcvku2k,t1_fcvj2lb,1578004247.0,"Yes, I read the article. As I mentioned to another reply, though, time will tell whether they stick to that or not, or whether some reviewer who would have otherwise given a game a 6.8 decides to just give it a 7 instead because it was *so close*. 

That's the problem with limited scales like whole number 1-10. There can be a huge difference between a 6 and a 7, especially if you rate on a scale like the letter grade system where anything below a 6 is a fail. If they shifted to where anything above a 5 was ""more good than bad"", then fine, but I doubt they will."

Games,fcv7lqu,t3_ej3h9t,1577996312.0,"I've never had an issue with decimal points before. Some games might be better than a 7, but not quite as good as an 8. Not even allowing people to use half-points seems rather limiting, but oh well.

Also, hopefully they stick to a standard rounding system, where something that was a 7.4 before gets rounded down to a 7, and it's not some system where they secretly round everything up to sound better than it is. They're already the outlet that gets joked about the most: ""Terrible optimization, boring gameplay, 8/10 - it has a little something for everyone""."
