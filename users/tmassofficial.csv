anyways. the Worst part is when you see some girl saying they'll ""knock out"" a guy over a game of beer pong is the drunk white knights who instantly want to get involved and get real loud.

wrong again. They get something like 2k in game money for destroying product. That doesn't even cover the ammo they waste to do it. The sales however net you hundreds of thousands for a single sale, so it's a dick move that doesn't benefit the attacker in the slightest. It literally wastes hours of work for another player.
