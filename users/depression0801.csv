depression,fezd3bx,t1_feyky7x,1579456080.0,What about a school counselor/therapist?
depression,fey438e,t1_fey3vvr,1579440574.0,"Yeah, it's like my mind is either too slow or too fast for my body"
witchcraft,fexchuu,t1_fev7wrr,1579428636.0,"Yeah, fortunately I'm changing schools in 1.5 year, I'll quit the classes there. It hurts because my school is strictly anti-gay and anti-pagan, but I guess I'll get through it. Thank you for your tips!"
witchcraft,fexc74f,t1_fev79of,1579428466.0,"Thanks for the idea, I was actually thinking about making a sigil of some sort."
witchcraft,fexc49j,t1_fevtu4z,1579428427.0,"I wouldn't say it's a ""cult"" — rather a small town filled with people, who are afraid of change. It's a place where nothing happens, so when someone declares something that does not fall in the town's definition of ""normal"" everyone grabs onto it like on a piece of meat. Thank you for your tips, they really cheered me up!"
witchcraft,fexb5q0,t1_fevtmsa,1579427994.0,"Yeah, unfortunately. It's even worse, because my school brags about how pagans are ""evil"" and how they ""force their beliefs onto Christians""."

I've been told she's a ""must"" before, but I feel like I'm genuinely gonna like it so yeah. I mean, people reccomend her books for a reason, right?"

SuicideWatch,fdehc18,t1_fdefzlm,1578339031.0,"Never tried online counseling. Support groups (or any groups in general) are not my thing, I can't socialize"
SuicideWatch,fdeer8x,t1_fdee3zl,1578337433.0,"Nope, not possible. I don't really have the courage to get help + I know I'll switch into my maniac phase in 1-2 weeks so my so-said depression won't make any sense when I'm functioning on my highest. (honestly when I think about it, my mom might not take me to the therapist because she thinks I'll ""get better"" while I'm really just constantly switching through depression and mania.)"
SuicideWatch,fdednuu,t1_fded3lw,1578336749.0,"I can't just do it. I know she won't take me to a therapist, she'll just hug me, tell me that it'll be better and offer to watch a movie together. She does that EVERYTIME I'm feeling sad. 

Thank you for your advice, but I don't feel strong enough to get help. I really appreciate your concern, though."
SuicideWatch,fdecx1o,t1_fdebsb2,1578336283.0,"I've actually been to a school therapist a while ago (I know it's not the same but at least I tried to get help) and when I told her I feel overwhelmed by school and I don't feel good about myself, she told me that while depression shouldn't be ignored, it's probably just because I'm lazy or because of my ""iNtRoVeRtEd siDe"". I don't talk to her since then. 

I told my mom that I feel bad about myself, she said ""I'll take you to a therapist, just not now"" and she doesn't mention it anymore. 

I don't think I even have a reason to seek out help, because it's either going to get ignored or people will think I'm overreacting."

SuicideWatch,fde74tg,t3_eki2s0,1578332645.0,"I honestly listen to ""happy"" or ""empowering"" songs just to feel them contrast with my life and feel even shittier."
SuicideWatch,fde63gn,t3_ekwvac,1578331995.0,"Honestly, dude, same. I feel like I kind of fell in love with the idea of falling in love and I crush on literally everyone (men, women, whatever). I help myself with constantly reminding myself that I have time, that love is not worth chasing and some other shit like that. Try not to focus on it too much and next time ask yourself if you really love her or if it's just a crush, because people have crushes."
