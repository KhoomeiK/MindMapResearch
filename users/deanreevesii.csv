She's responsible for 9 of the 11 of the benghazi gates (hence 9/11, you never seen a ratio presented as a fraction before??), but she was obviously aided and abetted by her horde of buttery males. I've heard rumors though that the males weren't even ACTUALLY buttery.

This part's bullshit too, you know? I mean I would think if you had actually did a little research after being corrected about the temperature and consistency of pasteurized eggs you would've picked up in your research that THE EGG IS PASTEURIZED THOROUGHLY AND INTERNALLY. 

Honestly, if you clearly don't know about the subject why you feel it necessary to post about it with an air of authority?
