Horse train every day. 
Start researching everything as soon as you're able and remember to do it everyday. One day you'll be able to craft everything you might need. 
Take everything that you hear or read in area chat with a grain of salt...  there's alot of differing ideas about how to play the game.
Pick up everything and invest in a merchant. 
ESO plus is worth it if you intend on being an every day player. 
Enjoy!! The world is beautiful."
