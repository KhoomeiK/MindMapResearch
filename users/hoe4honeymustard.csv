insaneparents,fe60l5x,t3_enqdd2,1578879104.0,:( reminds me of a story. one time my sister and i got a new (used) car to share. the day we got it i was driving with a friend and someone went through a red light and totalled my car. they t boned us. the front of their car hit my door so my head hit the window pretty fucking hard. when i called my parents they were instantly livid with me. they did not once ask if i was okay. they yelled at me all night and some how convinced me for months that it was my fault. at the scene of the accident i felt fine but as the night went on my head started to hurt more and more. i started throwing up and i couldn't stop. my mom did not want to take me to the hospital. she kept saying it was probably just a migraine. even though i had just been hit by a fucking car. i did end up convincing her to take me. turns out i just had a concussion and it wasn't that bad. but i did need to go to the hospital bc i was throwing up non stop all night and i got super dehydrated and all from that. i am just so glad that i am older now and i can look back on things and know they were wrong. a normal parent would have insisted on taking me to the hospital even before my head started hurting in the first place. a normal parent should get paranoid when shit like that happens to their kids.
holdmyfries,fe3zg7d,t1_fe2nxgh,1578854311.0,hate to say it but i think gf. since she didn't react with any disgust/distaste. in situations like this i assume she could have a fettish. people can be completely normal yet have a weeeeeird ass kink.
