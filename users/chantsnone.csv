benchmade,ffa4stb,t3_esh982,1579727886.0,Nice! I’ve got two bugouts myself and now they just came out with like 3 new ones. I think the minis would be too small for my hands and I still almost pre ordered one. The addiction is very real.
knifeclub,ff9mtdb,t3_ese9uy,1579716287.0,Where’d you get a chronic with a black blade!? I can’t find it anywhere.
knifeclub,ff9mdhk,t1_ff9h6i0,1579716024.0,I’m trying to choose between the Chronic and the Brigand for my groomsmen. The grey and the black chronics are super good looking. Seems like it might be the right choice.
Showerthoughts,ff3thys,t3_erc6bg,1579548509.0,It’s always so funny seeing a twitter screenshot repurposed into a shower thought.
subaruimpreza,ff3pfaw,t3_ergk0i,1579546013.0,You and I have extremely similar cars. I put a roof cage on mine. Pic in profile if you wanna see what yours would look like with one.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff32vyd,t3_er3482,1579532265.0,Pointless debate club actually sounds like a ton of fun. Drinking needs to be involved.

Vaping,ff31aiv,t3_er6kn9,1579531020.0,I bought a backup just in case some bullshit like this happens. Sorry this happened to you. Definitely a day ruiner.

babushkadogs,fet7av0,t3_eqecae,1579372444.0,It’s a support group. All of their sons died in the war.
corgi,fes91fp,t3_eqg48l,1579362714.0,It’s good that you have access to corgis even if you don’t have corgis of your own. Access to corgis is important for mental health.

AskReddit,fei7e28,t3_ep25lu,1579131936.0,I work at the big airplane company that’s in the news a lot lately. I’ve just been telling people I work in aerospace. They all have questions I don’t have answers to.
benchmade,fei6r9w,t1_fei5h67,1579131530.0,Damn that’s like Benchmade website price. I don’t blame you for going with a grip.
knifeclub,fei45pe,t3_ep68t7,1579129882.0,I felt this. My rule is NEVER set you knife down. Hand or pocket. Those are the only two options.
benchmade,fei3z68,t1_fei1ofj,1579129767.0,But... they make a mini crooked river. A grip is another solid choice tho.
ImaginaryTechnology,feert9j,t3_eoks7f,1579039844.0,Another super cool yet terrifying idea
BernieSanders,feeo2vc,t3_eoq5c3,1579037666.0,Feels good right!?

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdwjh89,t3_en683w,1578759344.0,I thought the word was actually “vachina”. For years I thought girls had “vachinas “.
interestingasfuck,fdwf265,t1_fdui5p8,1578758067.0,Yeah it’s still going. I lost interest in it a long time ago but my fiancé still watches it.

interestingasfuck,fdt0ibn,t1_fdss4qk,1578710340.0,I knew I’d seen this before. Is this r/quityourbullshit territory?
knifeclub,fdsthcz,t3_emzny0,1578707729.0,Your other post made irrationally jealous and this one isn’t helping either. I’m not in this picture and I don’t like it.
nostalgia,fdn0ypz,t1_fdmmnwq,1578573906.0,I had to tell a youngling about the five inch ones the other day. Pretty sure I played Oregon trail on them in elementary school.
corgi,fdjsvb1,t1_fdjqxu5,1578486295.0,Haha yeah the only reason we got it is because she has a little corgi figure that comes along with her.

BernieSanders,fdcwgo4,t1_fdcu4ir,1578286319.0,Honestly I think your previous post partly inspired me to donate another $27 today. I hate to admit it but I’m not as brave as your dad. It takes guts to go out there and do what he’s doing. I feel like I’m helping with my donations but I honestly think he’s helping way more than I am. We need as many people like him as we can get.
knives,fdcuy32,t3_ekley9,1578285040.0,I had to stash my mini crooked river in a planter a couple weeks back. It’s all I could think about the entire time I was in there. But there was NO way I would just give it away.
BernieSanders,fdctvx9,t3_ekjxc9,1578284178.0,Your dad is super cool. I saw your other post. I hope you’re showing him all the love he’s getting here. He deserves it.

mildlyinfuriating,fdakww7,t1_fdakbty,1578247210.0,That’s a good point. I didn’t think about that. I will start complaining.
blursedimages,fda39mp,t3_ek8zew,1578241133.0,Did someone glez those sneks?!
corgi,fd9tl5t,t3_ek9kz9,1578237901.0,Is the fur on her head changing color? My little girls head fur changed from black to light brown in about 6 months. At about 3-4 months she looked exactly like this. It was a crazy transformation. You have a very pretty girl there.
corgi,fd77zje,t3_ek3lqs,1578200623.0,I’d love to be haunted by a ghost corg

knifeclub,fcz3iwq,t1_fcz1qh2,1578092931.0,"Pretty sure that’s what’s happening. Even though it’s used, it’s strange that they replaced it with another nice expensive knife."

corgis,fcyplem,t3_ejhraj,1578084504.0,Both of mine do that too. Not sure what to tell you. Just wanted you to know you’re not alone.
knifeclub,fcy1t14,t1_fcy0ulg,1578073578.0,Like are the scales the same size with a smaller blade? Because I’m not on board with that. Are they making they’re own smaller scales? Even that website has no answers.
knifeclub,fcxte6b,t3_ejecsa,1578070150.0,So are they grinding the blades down to that size? I like this I’m just a little confused. I can’t find anything about a mini bugout anywhere but the link you provided.
knifeclub,fcxpppm,t1_fcw4h2y,1578068552.0,I’m guessing that’s a rock scale backspacer too? Pretty sure I have the same one. Looks great.

EDC,fcvt91v,t1_fcvsvvv,1578009585.0,Familiar with BladeHQ? I spend way too much time on that website. Fun to look at but I’m not sure how they compare to store prices. I don’t have a store near me.
EDC,fcvsk57,t1_fcvrfan,1578009145.0,Nothing wrong with that! And I will stay away from your wife. I’ve learned most I know from r/knives and r/knifeclub and also r/Benchmade. I’m only a couple years in so I totally feel you.
EDC,fcvpbyy,t1_fcvmaep,1578007066.0,You know Benchmade provides that for you? You have to send it in to them but they’ll do a full tune up for you. Lifesharp!
EDC,fcvp5pi,t3_ej34db,1578006955.0,We have similar taste. I have the desert tan mini baton and a serrated OD green bugout. I like your style.
AskMen,fcvjsd6,t1_fcv78og,1578003596.0,It’s not your fault. It’s the word “panty”. At least for me.
MadeMeSmile,fcswikv,t3_eimfqb,1577926895.0,I love this video every time it comes up. Reminds me of my shittiest/funnest jobs I’ve ever had due solely to the people I worked with.
sbubby,fcsvme4,t1_fcsc0nv,1577926247.0,That was really hard to sound out and say
knifeclub,fcsqe8n,t1_fcroo9y,1577922467.0,It’s assisted open correct? How do you like it? All my Benchmade s are manual.
politics,fcrbf8s,t1_fcr86gt,1577899525.0,I sang that last line in Tom Jones voice
knifeclub,fcpf6sl,t1_fcowpof,1577861331.0,I didn’t realize that was possible. Not even close to blue now. Super cool.

electronic_cigarette,fcmf8c1,t3_ehuwta,1577773067.0,I’m in Washington and I’ve ordered juice twice and successfully for vapordna.com. Both after the ban. One just a couple weeks ago.
electronic_cigarette,fcme9m9,t3_ehwu4g,1577772109.0,"You put in the effort to make this post. Seems like you probably want to stop smoking. The day doesn’t matter but if it helps making it a resolution then more power to you. Just give it a try, even if you’re very pessimistic. You really don’t have much to lose. I smoked heavily for 16 years and I never thought I’d make the switch. I thought it wouldn’t satisfy me in the same way but I was pleasantly surprised. I stopped smoking a little over a year and cigarettes are absolutely disgusting now. Get something cheap and simple like a caliburn. You don’t have much to lose on an investment like that. And it may pay off for you like it did for me. Way cheaper too. Good luck! If I can do it, there’s no reason you can’t."
