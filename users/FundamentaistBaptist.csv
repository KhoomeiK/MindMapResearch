Part of the problem is many women don't understand how Represenative Democracy works.  If a woman has money and hires a man, she is clearly in a position of authority over the work being done.  But for some reason women think that voting for a man means that men are in charge.

All systems that allow women to vote are biases toward matriarchy.  Men do the work and women reap the benefit. Most every social program (education, food support, health care) leads to more dollars spent on women.  Those employment fields also occupy more women than men.  Men work more hazardous jobs than women.  Women are the privileged class and it is deep immorality that leads then to claim men are in charge.

One of the problems is women will socially assault other women for stepping out of line, so often women's outward statements are out of sync with their voting patterns.

I live in a red state and I was talking to a woman about this same issue.  I pointed out to here that in this state about 75% of women voted for Trump, based on exit polling and other polling and she was shocked, based on her conversation with white women being outwardly anti-Trump.

So I had to man-splain to her how the secret ballot is based on letting people vote for their interest and avoid political violence.

Every modern society is a matriarchy.  The problem is women are as two faced and dishonest as a mother that says ""tell me the truth and I won't get mad."""

As you strive against  this order you wear yourself out mentally and physically, and one reason is because in order to be so stubborn you need to be in denial.  You have to engage in mental gymnastics, hid the truth from you inside your own head.

Just because you want to be in denial of the natural order does not mean you can demand that of others, those that want to be successful and mentally healthy.

Let me take a slight astrological detour about how modern science is a load of crap.  Stars are suppose to change color over millions and hundreds of millions of years.

A popular picture [here](https://slideplayer.com/slide/6259553/21/images/34/What+color+stars+are+hottest+Coldest+Red+Super+Giants.jpg).

Except the only star change that has been reliable observed is the exact opposite direction.  Sirius predominately described before Christ as dark red, and as time went on the descriptions changed to white and blue, but not in a clean and orderly progression.

Despite all the stuff people say they know about stars, there is no settled explanation for this recent color change. But the very same people tat cant decide this will say they see stars forming in nebula.  No they don't, they see hot spots in the nebula and speculate a star is forming.

Most of the paradigms that underpin science are not as consistent as they would have you believe.  The age of the universe sounds like a load of hooey to me.  I don't see any reason to believe the universe is billions of years, and geological history is millions of years.

How is the Bible hateful of women?  Just because men and women have different roles in society and different routes to happiness doens't mean that it hates women.

If you see someone hurting themselves you are not self-harm-phobic.  But modern women hurt themselves with their manly or androgynistic lifestyles.  You point that out so they stop hurting themselves, or neglecting their families.  Do a search into the data on declining women's happiness in the West.  The writers and women are so lacking wisdom that they cannot see how Godless Androgyny is destroying women happiness.  Turns out being a overworked, in-debt harlot doesn't make women happy.

>***homophobic***

The Bible is clearly against being wrathful and fornication.  Sorry to tell you, but most sodomites are wrathful fornicators, or they are permissive to wrathful fornicators.  

If you are not repulsed by Pride Parades you have a long way to go to work on your sanctification.  If your are not brought to rightess anger when you see parents brainwashing their kids into being LGB, or especially T then you have no care for the emotional welling of children.

Much like modern women don't know that being a overworked in-debt harlot doesn't make them happy, most people don't want to consider how terrible the sodomites are to society. Society has become so open minded its brains have fallen out.

Christianity,fczqjlt,t3_ejpxvm,1578106866.0,"Take anything about Bible history from Catholics with a grain of salt.  There is no evidence that Peter was ever in Rome, much less Pope of Rome.  Rome has constantly been usurping power and esteem to itself for almost two thousand years.  Rome was not worth mentioning by name in Revelation and many interpretations of Revelation Symbology have the Catholics on the wrong side.

They were the Old Testament Scriptures, the Epistles, and the various Gospels floating around for a long time before the 37th Pope asked Jerome to compile the Vulgate Bible.  There were about 27 different Vetus Latina floating around before text were decided to be more authentic than others..  Catholics distort that numerous ways for their own esteem.  Most debates around Pre-Bible Christians are based on this faulty catholic understanding of Scripture and gets messed up with all the Catholic distractions.

So not every early Christian had access to a New Testament.  They had access to the Gospels individually and the Old Testament.  I say that is all you need.  You don't need written by Paul, or involves Paul at all to be a good Christian, and that is most of what was complied into the Vulgate and subsequent additions."

https://www.khouse.org/articles/2003/482/

The numbers are encoded and we have some extra zeros. Now, you could argue that some ancient genious figured out a way to hid pi in Genesis through trial, error, and being phenomically obsessed with pi.

But the idea of e wasn't a thing untill the early 1600s.  How do you encode e into John 1:1, which is a very spiritually dense passage, and hid a number that woudn't exist for som 1600 years?

The chances of e being incoded in John 1:1 by random chance to that precision is very low, like 1 in billions low.  So it seems absurd to think that it happens by chance alone.

So some intelligent design hid a number in the Bible, in a very crucial location, in the non-synoptic gospel.  I have never seen someone place such a impossible numbering any gnostic text.  I have not seen it in pseudographia.  Just Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1.

Why all that?  I am not ecumenical in that I believe that all religions lead to salvation, but I do believe they are multiple legitimate ways to God the Father through the Son.  You could see this numbers argument and start to believe in divine inspiration.  You could just read John 1:1 and the rest of the Word and it moves you and you don't even need this curious argument for divine inspiration.

God declares himself the God abundant in Truth and Righteousness in Exodus.  In 2nd Thessalonians it is made clear that Deceit is linked to unrighteousness and a lack of the love of truth.  Look at how that plays out by those that disregard God's law, the social diseases, literal diseases, that come from rejecting God's wisdom is another common route to God.

I can't say to what extent passing judgement on why someone believes in God is common to Christianity, unless it seems grounded in some clear heresy (Prosperity Gospel: Im just here for the blessings, thanks)."

Looking at the above we get into the debate over what is the ""natural use"" of the woman.  Does that involve some kinky stuff?  What is in and what is out?  Is slamming your wife in the rear allowed but buggering some dude not?  If the man has trouble maintaining an erection and oral sex is used to finish off reproductive sex I think most would consider that pragmatic and allowable.

What if your wife is already pregnant, oral sex, buggery, ejaculating on her body all don't prevent you from being fruitful and multiplying, you already took care of that.  Probably should be ruled in if she is game.

Now if you are using anal/oral sex as a way of avoiding pregnancy we get into that grey area."

One of the main things that is a problem is the Bible is very clear you are to motivate people to not sin.  This comes with compassion, but it also comes with rebuke.

1My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke; 12for the LORD disciplines those He loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.

**Hebrews 12:6**

For the Lord disciplines whom He loves, and He scourges every son whom He receives.

To use a military term, ass-chewings are part of Christianity, Old Testament and new.  This watered down, effeminate, rebuke free Christianity is not scripturally founded.

The real difficult thing is to chastise from a place of love and caring, and have the person receiving the rebuke know it is because you care. But what many people don't understand is you don't correct people you have written off.  Not even God does that, according to the Reprobate Doctrine. Reprobates minds get seared with a spiritual hot iron so they can continue to do what is inconvenient.

But thinking that stray lustful thoughts don't exist is dishonest.  They all occur, it just depends on what frequency, what intensity, and how long you let them go on.
