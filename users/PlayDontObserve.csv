LAClippers,ffec2i3,t1_ffebvcx,1579842681.0,Yeah dude. I am so cautiously hyped for the upcoming postseason. No injuries ü§ûüèæ
LAClippers,ffebmwl,t1_ffe4jw6,1579842286.0,It's all good. The article wasn't inflammatory at all. It gives insight into the adjustment when superstars enter the picture.
LAClippers,ffebj51,t1_ffe46x4,1579842191.0,Co-wrote with Sam Ammick
LAClippers,ffebhj6,t1_ffe3opn,1579842150.0,No he didn't.
LAClippers,ffe878r,t1_ffe7sfp,1579839348.0,The question comes from the tweet you just linked to me. They do say that and?  Have you read the article? Do you subscribe to The Athletic?
LAClippers,ffe6y7c,t1_ffe64qt,1579838342.0,That's not out of context. They posed that question in the article and answered it. It's fair to ask that question.
juicyasians,ffe4kma,t3_et4jy2,1579836532.0,üí£üòµ amazing.
LAClippers,ffe49cs,t3_et4bl7,1579836297.0,The actual article didn't say there were chemistry issues but more along the lines that there were chemistry adjustments. It was really well written. The dipshits at Bleacher Report ran with it and sent out their typical out of context hot take notifications an hour after it was published. Then basic bitch sports fans (and Laker fans) started talking nonsense.
