nosleep,ff67feo,t3_er0q0t,1579620920.0,I'm wondering how many innocent people ended up in jail and how many bad guys keep running free if you did your job this fucking poorly for more than 30 years.
facepalm,ff5wsde,t1_ff3uwft,1579612862.0,"Well in regards of OP: I just quickly went through his response history and it seems to me that s/he is quite the opposite than a transphobe. And even in this discussion just defends the opinion that influence and/or encourage sex/geneder development in 2 year olds is quite the dangerous thing and can fuck them up pretty badly. 

For example I also played with my sister's dolls as often as with my cars but I never wanted to be anything else than I am. Now let's say my mum wasn't inteligent woman and tried to encourage my ""difference"" by whatever means. That would probably fuck up my confidence and self-esteem pretty badly."
facepalm,ff2noht,t1_fen9qw8,1579515152.0,"I think this question is more linked to recognition of time line. What was before and after. Usually these questions starts appearing once the child start to attend regularly the daycare/kindergarten. Because it brings the first meeting with time-place-related patern. FE: After breakfest we will go to kindergarten, and after lunch you will go to sleep and after sleep I will come to pick you up. And I really don't thing that there is anything more behind it then simple request about position at specific time. 
But I give you the benefit of the doubt as this definitely seems as existential question and maybe they really are asking if their soul was in heaven, or their conscience was one with the allpower of the universe or if they lived different life in different body."

Read at least something before judging others. Actually even though Killy00013 overly dramatizes his/her points s/he is basically right regarding the neuropsychological/personality developmental stages in 2 yo. Yes of course you probably had only the brightest 2 year olds around you, and they definitely were all aware of their gender, had fully mature personality and usually talked a lot about existential questions and philosophy. 

But generally speaking two year olds have about the same complex personality as cats and are capable of approximately the same level of abstract thinking."
facepalm,femqp9y,t1_femb0pq,1579266818.0,"I would like to have few examples of mentioned existential questions. Kids around two do start to develop a personality, but still usually lack abstract thinking and without that not much of existential questions are asked."
facepalm,femplr4,t1_femn7lu,1579265817.0,"I completely agree with you sir. But making massive sweaping changes isn't the trait of democracy alone. That goes through all kind of regimes. In democracy you can say that majority of people wanted the change. Theoretically.
In practice you see that democracy is the regime where two idiot will outvote one inteligent man. Why do you think that almost everyone in power is trying to make human race stupider generation by generation. Because you can manipulate them to vote for what you want not what is right, maybe?"

Would you please explain how the hell do I do anything racist. (and btw. my country does not have the history of slavery, segregation neither other US inventions :) )

And to make sure we are not speaking about hurt feelings, here is definition of racism:

""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior"""

facepalm,fdn3sfc,t1_fdn2h3e,1578576448.0,"Ok, thanks. 

So hypothetically if in the same sentece I want the to highlight the place where the money was wasted I would have to rephrase the sentence this way?

""...,they're just mad bc they wasted money there."""

Pathfinder2e,fdg8xhr,t1_fddmhfx,1578385073.0,I see our whole party dying on this one.. If there were two of them - armageddon happens.
Pathfinder2e,fdd7kib,t1_fd6348q,1578298351.0,I wouldn't say it is much overpowered when using point-buy system u usually end up with similar stats. It seems to be more variable and bit more (high risk-high reward) scenario. The issue here is that if you have a bad luck with dice you can easily end up with underpowered / unusable char.
Pathfinder2e,fcxd7nu,t1_fcxboy1,1578059770.0,And do I understand it correctly that while standing up it creates AoO?
Pathfinder2e,fcxd48u,t1_fcxc50r,1578059690.0,"yep, it was creature 3lvls above us and even without additional abilities (except one fear effect countered by our bard)  .. it was 2,5 hours of fighting and almost dying :D"
Pathfinder2e,fcxan1j,t1_fcx9l0d,1578057520.0,"Thank you once again .. were kind of test-running three nighter on holidays to get the better grip on the rules so we aren't really grasping all of it possibilities. Thanks for your help to think about additional ways to play out demanding encounters.

PS: Happy cake day !

Edit: Also as you can see we are not native speakers so possibly also slight misunderstandings of descriptions in the rulebook were adding to some of the confusion and misinterpretation."
Pathfinder2e,fcx8ar7,t1_fcx7aql,1578055206.0,"Thanks for advise. 
So in the first case (Flanked+Prone) we were doing it incorrectly. :( on the otherway our GM told us that even if it was not by the book she would have given us additional untyped circumstance bonus as she liked that we were trying another things than just standing around and smashing it to oblivion. 
But at least we did get the 2) and 3) correct :)

Would you have any suggestions for another combat maneuvers insted of tripping the guy which would help and avoid the Flank+Prone stacking. 
Just to clear it out - we weren't trying to overkill it but it had AC that we could hit without any additional bonuses/penalties only in 20-25% and he was hitting our tnak with tower shiled back in 50% and rest of us in 75-95%. So we were just trying everything we could to weaken him."
Pathfinder2e,fcx73gr,t1_fcvgenz,1578053916.0,i would just like to point out that it is not complete houserule.. the corebook specifically has info on rolling for ability scores and even gives preferred method. we tried this multiple time and the rolling method usually come pretty close to poin-buy method..
facepalm,fbttie2,t1_fbtna5k,1577095022.0,Guys I don't know what you are seeing in the post. But I don't see any wires and no high-voltage-line insulation and equipment on the pole either.
