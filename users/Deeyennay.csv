RetroFuturism,fcvdzu8,t1_fcvdf6q,1578000117.0,"No, it was a working prop on the rear end and also the reason it failed:

> One disadvantage of the rail zeppelin was the inherent difficulty of pulling additional wagons to form a train, because of its construction. Furthermore, the vehicle could not use its propeller to climb steep gradients, as the flow would separate when full power was applied. Thus an additional means of propulsion was needed for such circumstances."

AskReddit,fckaxcn,t1_fck9ebl,1577721184.0,Good points. However I think the question is whether there is or should be a war in the first place. One of the many problems with these wars on X is that you can bend and change the definition of X to justify any means. The War on Terror is not about terror. The War on Drugs is not about drugs.

microsoft,fcey15e,t1_fceptx6,1577624788.0,Haha same mode here. I think that the change here might be that non-Outlook aliases (example@yourcompany.com) are now no longer sent as “on behalf of” the Outlook/Hotmail/whatever address. Aliases made through the Outlook web app (example@outlook.com) already had this ‘autonomy’. Please correct me if I’m wrong though.
