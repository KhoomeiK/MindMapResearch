AskReddit,fcp12u7,t1_fcp0jwd,1577847231.0,"I remember having that kind of past myself, but we just kinda had to function. It was part of the exams. Giving presentations in front of perfect strangers that is. Maybe that was a plus for us, when moving on in life, but I still don't really enjoy being with people. The really bad thing is that people like to tell you that you aren't functional if you don't enjoy being with people but I think you are perfectly okay, regardless of that."

SeriousConversation,fcopen3,t3_ei9unu,1577838061.0,"Yeah, what a fucking ripoff that would be. Killing yourself and then learning that there's an eternity of bullshit waiting. Well, in Terry Pratchett's Discworld people get the afterlife they believed in. So maybe it's actually that. Or if there is non, which is essentially what I choose to believe, then there is no need to debate that. But talking to an atheist about heaven is a bit like talking to a Muslim about pink elephants. But from a theological standpoint it varies from religion to religion. Luther placed more emphasis on believe itself, which is why atheists definitely can't in a protestant believe system. Catholics, maybe could believe that atheists go to heaven if they were good people as it's more based on merit."

Everyone who is refusing to fight gets secretly rescued, the rest fights to the death and the winners get shot. This would solve so many problems. But no, Islam is not criticized enough. The problem is that criticism is usually mindless and hateful. It's the new team mentality: You need to be tolerant of child marriage, failure to integrate, rape and honor killings, because otherwise you'd appear to be a fucking nazi biggot. And surely that other guy wouldn't want to acknowledged that there are reasonable people too, who are patriotic and proud of the western nation they live in and twice as pissed off about extremists than you could ever be, because that would imply that not all of them are evil villains who want to destroy western values - that's what libtard cucks would want you to believe. 

It's a clusterfuck and overall, religion needs to die in the same way we almost gotten rid of measles and people believing in the sun god Ra. You know who's not getting enough shit these days? Jews.
