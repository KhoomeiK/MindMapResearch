* Free of student debt
* Healthy ""marriage potential"" relationship
* Being fairly compensated for my expertise (industry-wide issue)
* Having a competent US President with a good cabinet that are all committed to addressing climate change, education, human rights and wealth inequality
* Stop renting and buy a nice, well-built home
* Have my friends and I all live in the same state
* Get a Master's and start working on a Ph.D
* A cat
* Lots of therapy
* A few more long hiking trips with close friends
* Have one of my musical heroes notice my work
* Work through all the cultural battle of the sexes and racial tension that's going on right now, so I don't have to feel that burden all the time

* ~~Getting a job in my field and succeeding at it~~

Imagine being the only gay guy in a small town in Arkansas.  Everyone in town is going to call you a sissy, a faggot, a loser and an idiot.  According to this logic, that means you probably are one.

The work comes a lot easier to you, and everyone resents you for it, because your autism makes you a bit distant and hard to relate to.  You could be the nicest kid ever, but by this logic, you're arrogant, an asshole, a weirdo, a nerd, whatever they throw at you.

Imagine being the only one to speak out against the Communist Party in a rural Chinese town.  You're a disgrace to your family, a lazy son of a bitch, a degenerate.  Or the only woman in your family in India to want to go to college instead of marrying the wonderful, handsome, rich man your parents picked out for you.

offmychest,fdlpaad,t1_fdkxq3k,1578529255.0,"It's not that uncommon to be nice.  Some people take nice behavior the wrong way.  Some people act flirtatious when they're trying to be nice.  Some people act nice when they're trying to be flirtatious.  Some people act mean or aloof when they're trying to be flirtatious.  Some people act mean or aloof when they're trying to be nice because they're worried about coming off as flirtatious.  Some people say no when they mean yes and yes when they mean no.  I have probably made all of the above mistakes in the last year at least once, if not over and over.

The world is rife with misconception.  You may never figure out what their true intentions are.  But you'll never go wrong by respecting other people's boundaries, listening to them, and being honest with yourself about your own intentions."
offmychest,fdloai5,t1_fdlmrr2,1578528576.0,"Yeah.  You can learn the signs or whatever - they're not the same for all people, but it usually involves a certain tone of voice, a thing they do with their eyes, some other body language, whatever.  It's easy to misread, and to be honest it's beside the point.

The only thing that matters when it comes to this sort of thing, as far as right and wrong is concerned, is that you respect boundaries.

I get how all the chatter about male stereotypes and men having to seize every ""opportunity"" like it's a business prospect or something can get in your head and give you a hard time.  But that's an external world of silliness that frankly lands most people in unhappy relationships at best.  And no self-respecting man or woman ought to measure themselves by it.

The wiser of us know that with a bit of common sense, effort, patience, and genuinely good intentions, it'll all work out and you won't miss out on anything important unless like, you get hit by a bus or something crazy like that.  There really isn't all that much to worry about but people often get all worked up about it because... well it's another conversation... but I think Western culture is a bit lacking in the humanities department these days, and many people are uninformed on the basics of being a person."
offmychest,fdlo3gb,t1_fdll3hx,1578528442.0,"Well... to be fair... I think there are plenty of scenarios where they *actually are* attracted to you, which is what might make it so confusing.

And we didn't have any kind of overtly sexual flirting or whatever, because frankly I don't do that and neither do a lot of women, we just had a friendly conversation with a little blushing and some dodgy eye contact.

So.  I think the important part (as always) is just to be kind and respect others' boundaries.  Unless there's some social barrier like they're married to your brother, there's nothing wrong with asking someone out after you've had a friendly conversation.  Just... you know... don't go too far, and if they say no, accept it."

I have always been very talented at most things within certain categories, some of which I haven't put much interest or effort into at all, let alone discipline or dedication, but can still easily outperform most people who try very hard at them.  I was born lucky and have some exceptional spatial reasoning skills.

It's really only now as an adult that I'm confronting the fact that despite being very talented, I still stand to benefit greatly from dedication and hard work.  To me, it seems like the ratio is about 50/50, which is probably a little disappointing for most people.

I worked with a guy who (to his credit, he did train very hard as a competitive cyclist) had never really skied before, but managed to bike all the way to the start of a cross-country ski race, place first by like 8 minutes, and then bike all the way home and go to work the next day.  And he was racing against people who had been practicing and training for decades.  He was just born with the right type of body to kick ass at endurance sports, and also very dedicated on top of that.

As though that's probably been searched before by many, many people... (BTW Google and Microsoft, please change your search algorithm so that it doesn't suggest shit like that anymore, it's creepy)

That one's a tough nut to crack, especially because most people get so angry and disoriented just by talking about the subject.  If you want a pedophilia horror story - from the same podcast authors that OP linked about the GSA - listen to this story  [https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/redhanded/e/65270653?autoplay=true](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/redhanded/e/65270653?autoplay=true) ... and if you want extra creep factor, look up the face of the father.  Holy shitfucking satan that guy is scary.

I believe wholeheartedly that it's very important for the safety of future generations for us to get scientific knowledge about things like pedophilia, violent/sadistic tendencies, domestic abuse, etc... all of those power-oriented criminal abusive behaviors... which I believe come from mental illnesses... and try to get help available to the potential offenders before something happens (or happens again).  I've been shot down so many times for taking that perspective in discussions on Reddit, being mistaken for defending the perpetrators, that I don't bother engaging in it most of the time.

And listening to the story I linked above today, I too felt my blood boil.  I felt myself wanting to intervene, to find that man, or find someone else doing something similar somewhere else, and just kill them or something.  Just unleash that horror and rage and stop it with force.  It's like a human instinct.  So I totally get where most people are coming from when they wish punishments on pedophiles like the death of a thousand cuts or burning them alive or whatever, or even when they just generally dehumanize them and say they should be locked away forever in a dark cell all alone.  Although I don't think any cruel and unusual retribution is necessary or right, I totally agree that those who offend should be punished legally.

That being said, I don't agree with those who view even the most terrifying pedophiles, serial murderers, kidnappers, torturers... the absolute worst and most insane criminals in the world... as inhuman monsters.  Because they *are human*.  The definition of ""human"" has to account for people like that and what the human mind is capable of doing.  Because it's real, it happens, they exist, and they had mothers and fathers just like the rest of us.  We can't hide from the darkest and most shameful sides of humanity.

And that's where I think science comes in.  To help us understand what really causes people to become like that, and maybe how to prevent it.  A relative of mine is a criminal psychologist who actually studies inmates who have committed sex crimes against children, and I distinctly remember asking him once how it's possible for them to come to terms with who they are, and he told me it's not who they are, it's an illness that's taken over their minds."
offmychest,fchlywb,t1_fchjira,1577651669.0,"It's going to be hard for people in society, especially those who hear about these things from a distance via social media etc... not to blame the people involved, to overcome that taboo eliminating/justice seeking mob mentality, and allow it to be studied scientifically and treated clinically.  That's something that came up in the podcast which I really agree with.  The social structure, which came about to protect society from genetic disorders related to incest, is now getting in the way of its upgrade, which would be a structure of scientific knowledge that allows us to actually help people with the condition not have their lives ruined by it.

For now it's like... what do you do?  I know as someone who grew up in a family with different kinds of abuse, the police and the law don't really do much other than blow up people's families and leave them stranded without proper support.  It's a very touchy subject... family things.  And it always seems to lead to some kind of isolation.
