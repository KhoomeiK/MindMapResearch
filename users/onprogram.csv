It can be happening in people in a wide range of body sizes. 

I’m intentionally losing weight in a healthy way while managing my ED so these kinds of comments don’t hurt me. My friend struggling with anorexia however has to deal with a lot of mental bullshit when people make comments about her appearance, even if they mean well.  When my mom was losing weight due to illness it also didn’t feel great for people to comment on her weight loss because it scared her. She was overweight so people assumed it was a good thing (it wasn’t, she died 6 months later).   

saying something like “it’s great to see you” I think is an easy small talk switch that could make a big difference."
fatlogic,fexczlo,t1_fewoc5z,1579428895.0,My mind starts running when I do cardio and it can take me to some intense places but luckily for me I sweat so much that people can’t tell if I get emotional haha
fatlogic,fexctwh,t1_fex2tep,1579428813.0,I’m sorry to hear that your running anxiety was so bad. I’ve definitely had moments in my life where anxiety took something I liked away from me so I can sympathize with how insanely frustrating it can be.
fatlogic,fewlo2b,t1_feuy4vq,1579413810.0,The feelings of cardio can mimic some anxiety symptoms and really make me anxious. Cardio is so good for me though that I refused to give it up. I practice exposure therapy to get through my anxiety and now it rarely gets to a level I can’t handle when working out.

I brought up black people to demonstrate how unjust your thinking is since you’re so biased against trans people hoping it would help. Looks like you just expect everyone to fall in line just because you have a sad story but that’s manipulative and messed up. Be as prejudice as you want, but don’t cry when people call it out. You yourself said you know it’s messed up and illogical."
blursedimages,fd7ot2f,t1_fd7ms3x,1578207765.0,I never said being trans justified what happened to you. I am talking about how messed up it is to blame innocent trans people for things they didn’t do.
blursedimages,fd7o4qo,t1_fd7kcwu,1578207474.0,"Since you edited your post to add a bunch of bullshit I’ll clarify my logic to help you understand: promoting the idea that trans people are a threat because they’re trans is bigotry. People are right to speak out against this prejudice. Is it right for someone to tell innocent black people they need to get it together because some black people were violent? Of course not. That’s cruel. That’s what you did, and it’s fucked up. You said you try to be accountable, so be accountable and realize you’re being a jerk."
blursedimages,fd7m1i8,t1_fd7kcwu,1578206558.0,"I never said you had to do anything. I’m talking about what you choose to promote publicly which is your personal narrative that trans people are a threat and need to “learn” to be better. People are allowed to disagree with your bigotry and point out why it’s harmful. Your mental illness is not an excuse to promote bigotry. Of course violent and abusive people need to do better, but it’s cruel to promote the idea that someone is a threat just because they’re trans."
blursedimages,fd7k04i,t1_fd74cco,1578205701.0,Since you realize that you aren’t thinking straight and are being transphobic based on your bad experiences then I hope you understand why promoting the idea that trans people are a danger to society is wrong. These kinds of beliefs lead to innocence trans people being murdered. Since you know you’re being unjust and illogical you should understand why people disagree with your bigotry.
blursedimages,fd72kvy,t1_fd5vjfn,1578198644.0,Implying that whoever doesn’t fit the binary is literally not human kinda does yeah
blursedimages,fd72591,t1_fd5fglx,1578198505.0,"I never said you’re lying, just pointing out how illogical your statements about trans people as a whole are. They’re based on anecdotes and prejudice. It’s not ok to blame all trans people for the actions of some messed up kids you’ve known. That’s extremely unjust."
blursedimages,fd5dm1y,t1_fd4x8mc,1578176599.0,I hate to break it to you but there are countless violent mentally ill cis people. It’s insane to judge all trans people by your limited experience.
