These accumulated feelings can come to the surface when you are doing spiritual work. You need to let it be and feel it without conditions, it will fade and afterwards new has been made for love!"

antidiet,ferxtvg,t3_eng620,1579359404.0,"Yes, if you visit subreddits like r/wfpb or r/medicalmedium most of the people are dieting because of health and not really because of weight loss. 

You say that dieting is always unhealthy and I disagree with that.  I think that as long as you can restrict wothout blame and guilt it is okay to do so. For some people dieting can be easy to hold on to and after a while it can become so normal that they won't even notice anymore that they are restricting."

medicalmedium,femizao,t1_feag5np,1579258006.0,I think what he means by that is trusting that his diet is healthy and sustainable eventhough science disproves it
medicalmedium,femivqo,t1_fed648u,1579257861.0,Yes these things you stated are good evidence but it is still no proof! I do believe myself but I always have in mind that there is a really small percentage that he is a master manipulatet and he just knows a lot about nutrition and health. But I don't think it really matters. Try out what he says and see for yourself. The most important part is the healing part right?

If they have plans they wouldn't feel pressured to invite you to so you will know they don't do it out of pity if that makes any sense

1. Don't run away fron what you fear (exposure)
2. When fear arises, love and feel it unconditional. This means feeling without wanting it to go away, to change it or understand it. (mindfullness approach)
3. Every second you do this is valid. Slowly you will overcome fear"
