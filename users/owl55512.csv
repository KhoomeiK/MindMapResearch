keto,ffcea2q,t3_eso094,1579797594.0,"The key for me is the process- you MUST blend or use a food processor/immersion blender for it to not taste like cauliflower. For me, a hand masher just doesn‚Äôt cut it."
keto,ffcdde5,t3_esu8j3,1579797027.0,"Many people have mentioned an instant pot but we use our slow cooker basically every day. Dump chicken and a can of salsa / low sugar bbq sauce / soy sauce/ whatever sounds good. Walk away for 6 hours. Client calls and you need to run out? No problem flip that bitch to warm and it will be there for you when you get home. Pulled pork, soups, beef roast... sky is the limit. 
We make an ungodly amount of quesadillas when we have no time with leftover meat + cheese + mission tortillas. 

Takeout? Bunless burgers, wings with ranch, Mexican salads, chipotle, pho with no noodles extra beef. I stay away from Chinese and Thai - too risky and it‚Äôs too hard to resist!"
WaltDisneyWorld,ff70wav,t1_ff6x5eu,1579638903.0,I‚Äôve heard slightly lower but I wouldn‚Äôt be sure. Keep an eye on the wait times and ask every cast member you can. My advice would be to prepare for a busy day no matter what. The worst that happen is you are pleasantly surprised.
WaltDisneyWorld,ff6ymdf,t1_ff6vc3e,1579637572.0,Probably about 7:50? There was a group behind us for sure- I should have taken a picture just for context!
WaltDisneyWorld,ff6nue3,t1_ff6n4qd,1579631173.0,I looked up a copycat last summer just to tide me over!
WaltDisneyWorld,ff5w9e2,t1_ff4rukr,1579612371.0,"Of course! This might be a good question for a cast member when you check in. If it was me, I‚Äôd give myself 30 minutes and walk it üòä"
WaltDisneyWorld,ff46mb7,t3_erh56a,1579556681.0,La Cava Avocado Margarita. Find a spot by the lake. Grin like an idiot that I am at Disney. People watch and find the coolest shirts.
WaltDisneyWorld,ff339cd,t1_ff2zwoa,1579532547.0,Yep! March is a lovely time to go. You're almost there! Enjoy.
WaltDisneyWorld,ff2tgsj,t1_ff1l0r0,1579523467.0,Thank you I was so happy I got it!
WaltDisneyWorld,ff2tg44,t1_ff27479,1579523444.0,Absolutely. We always rope drop MK- so much we can get done in the first two hours. Bonus it‚Äôs cooler outside! Especially this time of year.
WaltDisneyWorld,ff2tcpl,t1_ff1tbzu,1579523329.0,Thank you!
rarepuppers,feelg8u,t1_feelbau,1579036145.0,She had gotten fixed a bit ago and her hair was slow to grown back - good eye!
rarepuppers,feeldq8,t1_feel761,1579036104.0,She‚Äôs the best!
dogs,feela6m,t1_feekbo5,1579036048.0,That‚Äôs weird! Yeah good luck ours will get weird habits or try to ‚Äútest us‚Äù from time to time but we just stay firm and consistent and she does great! Yours is amazing love the coloring!
dogs,feeiodw,t1_fedxjy0,1579034534.0,Our chessie stopped as soon as she lost her baby teeth which was around then! Frozen treats helped a LOT if you haven‚Äôt done those. She‚Äôs 9 mo now and definitely not bite-y anymore (just full blown teenager) haha
dogs,fcnob2t,t3_ei52vw,1577815293.0,Hi! I bring my dog to daycare as well. It‚Äôs such a great community! A gift card would be perfect- from Dunkin or even a local pizza place. My ‚Äúholiday‚Äù gift was a bunch of tennis balls and toys from pet smart- since most of their workers have pups of their own and they had SO many people bring in food. I‚Äôm sure they appreciate it!
stepparents,fc6gn8c,t1_fc6f3gk,1577480124.0,This is definitely a topic of discussion with my SO. We are eagerly awaiting a court date to get this adjusted and hopefully a little financial relief for us so we can start to build up a bit more than the bare minimum.
stepparents,fc6ghmh,t1_fc65l0j,1577480017.0,What!!! How is that possible?
stepparents,fc6gcfi,t1_fc6ezen,1577479918.0,"I appreciate your point of view. I get better each month about taking a deep breath about the petty little things and focusing on what matters. My emotional sanity is worth more than arguing over a 1/2 hour of drop off time / $25 haircut / etc etc. We are responsible for what we can control, no use fretting over the rest.  That is so much money, so crazy! Thanks for taking the time to respond."
stepparents,fc6g5hz,t1_fc6f8iu,1577479789.0,Thanks! Both households typically have a ‚Äúno travelling toys‚Äù rule so fingers crossed these don‚Äôt come over at all. I‚Äôve already discussed with SO about rules for iPads in our home if they show up with them. We both (avid gamers/ lovers of tech ourselves) have strong feelings about screen time- especially at such a young age. Really good point that you bring up though!!
stepparents,fc627e9,t1_fc5ojoc,1577470600.0,Ugh rough. So thankful for this sub and the ability to vent it out.
stepparents,fc60bvq,t1_fc5rh3j,1577469481.0,"Same here, biomom is happy to let us have them a lot of day times and evenings- as long as we drop them off back to her house for bedtime. We literally get them changed into pjs, shower, etc and then drop them off. 
We both love to see them and they love to see us so we are happy to do so but is is a very convoluted schedule. 

Yes, bio mom lives with her new partner and both are gainfully employed."
stepparents,fc6034o,t1_fc5uzwm,1577469353.0,Correct- was just more illustrating that the monthly load is intense due to the combination.
stepparents,fc5offh,t1_fc5njhw,1577462623.0,"Time is for sure documented, we have a verbally agreed upon ‚Äúschedule‚Äù of evening visits, and sometimes when we can‚Äôt or are talking about switching she says ‚Äúno I can‚Äôt have them that night I have something going on.‚Äù Like girl it is your time !!! Then at mediation talks about not bearing to have her kids away from her any more nights than she already ‚Äúgives up.‚Äù Queue eye roll but my fianc√© is still terrified that because we live in a semi conservative state she‚Äôll get preferential treatment due to being the mom."
relationships,fbxwgut,t1_fbxwbdc,1577202301.0,"Makes a little more sense thanks for explaining :) I‚Äôm very sorry you‚Äôre going through this. There are dozens of red flags here, get out! There are plenty of people who won‚Äôt make you feel like you‚Äôre losing your mind and you‚Äôre still young!"
