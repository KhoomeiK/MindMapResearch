AskReddit,ff9gvxg,t1_ff9g7jf,1579712752.0,"I've never heard about that. It's no rule and bacteria can be resistant to multiple things at once. I cannot reject that some people might have made a phage which can ""push out"" resistance plasmids or something similar but I haven't seen it on paper.  
My old job used crispr to cut open specific bacterias dna to remove harmful bacteria in the gut but the reason that worked was due to the healthy bacteria getting an advantage by not being killed.  Bacterial mutations happen fast if there's no competition which I think is one of the bigger issues with phages."
AskReddit,ff9g0tb,t1_ff9frl5,1579712224.0,First comment wasn't mine :) I just wanted to clear up that they have a great future potential but it's not a miracle cure
AskReddit,ff9f9gn,t1_ff9ebz9,1579711758.0,I'm a biotech engineer and had a student job working in a company developing bacteriophage based medicine a couple of years ago.  It  should be on the market soon but the problem is that one bacteriophage cannot cure multiple illnesses and they are not as stable as antibiotics due the fact that it's a borderline living organism and not just a molecule.  It's an exciting field but don't expect it to save everything within the near future.

Sorry for the confusion.  But I still believe that we should find an anti war solution above all else. I'm not 100% understanding of the American system but there must be some deescalating which can be done."

changemyview,fd5cd7y,t3_ejwv22,1578176213.0,Draft dodging is always fair when you're the attacking country. I wouldn't say that this is different for trump specifically except that this specific situation is very poorly masked.
