Once had an issue with an overheating PS3 and they simply sent us a new one in return for our console. My PS2 sill works, my PS3 still works and my PS4 still works.

I'm sure many people have different (worse) experiences with the brand but so far, I am pleased by the console's lifespan as well as the company's assistance when I ran into a problem."
