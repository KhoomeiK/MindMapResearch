LAClippers,ffb0nx2,t3_esn4p6,1579748887.0,I get Trezz was doing good in the first half so that’s why they kept him in but why not play them both it’s like Doc doesn’t want Zu & Trezz on the floor at the same time
Tennesseetitans,ffa26w7,t1_ffa1qcp,1579726398.0,And the whole NBA will say Kawhi was our Brady but if we win let them talk
Tennesseetitans,ffa19a4,t1_ff9zxi6,1579725853.0,"Coming from a long term Clippers fan I would had love to see Blake Griffin win a championship with the Clips but they did what they had to do to become a even better team and now are the best position they ever been to win their first championship

So I understand that would make for a good story but would you trade a possibility of a good story for one of the best chances of ever winning a Super Bowl?"
Tennesseetitans,ff9zsd9,t1_ff9z791,1579724991.0,"Haters gonna hate and let them because teams are supposed to do what they can to win a Super Bowl, We sign Wade on defense and Brady at QB we’ll be the new 15 Broncos lol"

Tennesseetitans,ff9yomb,t3_eshanx,1579724346.0,"I know a lot of them people won’t like this answer but yes, We all hate him because he’s so damn good and to be honest his reviving core keeps getting worst and he never had a back like Henry

I think we can sign Brady cheaper than Tannehill (He has taken pay cuts before and at this time I don’t think he’s really playing for the money) while he’s not a long term fix my faith in Brady getting us a Super Bowl next season will always be higher than Tannehills"

Tennesseetitans,ff6hnhl,t3_erv8mc,1579627404.0,I think with Vrabel being connected with Brady he calls Brady as a friend and ask him where he wants play if Brady ain’t down go ahead and start talking to Tannehill
