Games,fehhlxf,t1_fedrk79,1579116702.0,"Well, Steam doesn't even do regional pricing for my country meaning I have to pay US prices, while for example Metro Exodus was if I remember correctly around 20$."
patientgamers,fe44zih,t1_fe2rtk0,1578855830.0,"That's what it means to have you be able to do everything in one playthrough, naturally it will seem ridiculous, but that is a design choice, not necessarily a flaw."

Which is clearly what Bethesda is going for with what you're saying, you just don't like that direction. That doesn't make it indecisive."
patientgamers,fdygbj3,t1_fdx3ruy,1578779523.0,"To be fair, Bethesda has absolutely decided."

AskReddit,fcyjm1n,t1_fcyizn5,1578081165.0,Can someone summarise this? I'm a bit curious but I can't handle horror.
