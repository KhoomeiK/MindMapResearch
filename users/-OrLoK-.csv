oculus,fehqxrx,t1_fehqit3,1579122106.0,"well, there are only one or two games that really do that once you have found your ""vr feet"" and reviews/info tell you that.

again, any reasinable rewuest will be honoured but one cant expect to do it time and time again.

ive used steams refund policy 3 times in around a decade.

however, ive never felt i was entitled to one, rather that i was fortunate to be granted one."

oculus,fehpyas,t3_ep7vr8,1579121540.0,"like the others, i have to say oculus is correct.

steam, for example, is very lax with their refund system to a limit. but refunds arnt there to test games, rather to allow folk to refund games which dont work. anything else is a billy bonus."
