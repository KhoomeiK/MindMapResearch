Back when I was single, guys would always be surprised that I insisted on splitting the bill every time. That confused me because like, you know, this is the 21st century and all... Women who claim to be feminists but insist the guy pay for everything, or even just dinner the first date and not feminists. I agree that it’s cool for the person who does the asking out to pay the bill but even then, I feel uncomfortable letting people pay for me. I always felt like it was a dent to my self-respect, having people pay for me. After being together for over a year with my bf, only now am I truly comfortable with him paying for something for me without immediately wanting to venmo him my part."

It can hurt to feel like you’re not enough, and to feel like the love you have invested in someone isn’t reciprocated. Having said that, however, no one is worth sacrificing your self respect and dignity over. Distance is good if you’re figuring things out. I’d just ask that you love and appreciate yourself more and analyse this situation from a different perspective. You are enough just the way you are, and if someone doesn’t recognise that, well, it’s not your job to fix that. Know your self worth, and understand that no one is going to be with you more than you so the person who needs to love you more than anyone else in the world has to be you. Take care of yourself."

He had the audacity to be confused at my response, saying he’d spend so much money on me and wouldn’t I find it super hot to fuck on his wife’s bed?
