I, like you, find a surplus of gratitude whenever I find myself traversing the outdoors. Given the frigid and mountainous environment I typically wander, I catch the sight of observing and fleeing wildlife, and relish being in a place unclaimed by a materialistic frame of living.

I once found myself in the top percentile of spiritual enlightenment. Granted, I was assisted by a tray of baked Cannabis goods. In the tumult, the absolutely torrential din of my drug-induced delirium, I was crippled by a sense of satori. This radiant beacon of a realization allowed me to discover this: Enlightenment is withheld to those who spout pseudophilosophy and purple prose online. Thus, I remain humbly within human maudlin.

Water is underrated, I agree. And though I appreciate your calling me an imp, I can only dread what you might be in your own view."
