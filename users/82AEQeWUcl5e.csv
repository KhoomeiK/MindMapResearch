Having worked with several agencies in different states and different levels of government, I have seen the same patterns repeatedly. Furthermore, part of my work often involved researching the behavior of peer organizations to enable the agencies I supported to benchmark their own practices and performance. This gave me perspective and data on many more government agencies than I directly supported. 

I realize the plural of anecdote is not data, but I’ve literally collected data. So I am reasonably confident in this generalization at least as applied to the US. There will be exceptions, but I have yet to encounter one."

slatestarcodex,ffdp6il,t1_ffdfwpj,1579825673.0,"Because eventually the accumulated liabilities for deficit spending have to be paid. Unless your economy is growing very well, which generally is not the case, that means either higher taxes or currency debasement / inflation in the future when debts have to be paid. All of those options penalize people who save compared to those who spend. That disincentivizes saving. Saving is the capital that is used for investment. Investment is what helps your economy grow. So accumulating government debts causes individuals to make fewer pro-growth decisions, all else equal. That means fewer and worse jobs, broadly.

I’ve just realized your actual question relates to proximate effects not long term ones. If you are reducing a deficit you’re cutting spending. Cutting spending means that whoever was paid for XYZ is getting less now. That can mean anything from shittier coffee in the break room to layoffs (or in the case of many government orgs, hiring freezes that keep useless people in their jobs and rob orgs of fresh and much-needed talent). 

The short term impacts of cutting deficit spending are painful. The long-term impacts of not doing it are worse."

It used to be an efficient way to get through security, but sometime in the past few years they started giving it out with certain classes of premium ticket. Even aside from the fact that this makes a mockery of the whole security procedure (to get into this line you either have to get fingerprinted, interviewed, and background checked or...buy a premium ticket???), this results in an influx of people who appear to never have entered an airport before in their lives and have no idea what to do. They massively slow down the line. There’s nothing worse than running close to your flight and then getting stuck behind Gladys who has no goddamn idea what to do with her shoes, laptop, and water.

That’s incredibly irritating because it makes you do things like skip dinner to make it to your gate, only to wait there for no reason - and in some cases has prevented me from booking alternate flights when things are really time sensitive. I think if you know your flight will leave at least one minute after schedule, you tell people your exact delay estimate.

1. You used to study content of some kind and then be a teacher. Now you go to school to lean... special theories about teaching? And you don't get a lot of practical instruction or preparation for the content you'll be teaching. If teaching were taught less like a theory of education and more like learning a specialty + some practical trade school in teaching, things might be better. Eliminate theory classes; any relevant theory can be discussed alongside whatever real thing makes the theory important. 

2. We're trying to scale classrooms because the system believes class sizes of 25-30 can work and they want to save money so they are committed to them working. I think successful classrooms that size are rare and shouldn't be counted on; in my completely subjective experience, the best classes have 12-18ish students.

TheWayWeWere,fdxexqy,t1_fdwgtit,1578768100.0,"Basically what it comes down to is that we aren’t good at measuring real purchasing power, and we don’t have a good grasp of how much standards of living have risen. Asset price inflation is real (houses etc are more expensive relative to wages) and a problem worth talking about, but a lot of the narratives on purchasing power of income are wrong. The average person in the seventies could buy a house more easily, but the goods they used in everyday life were astronomically worse. 

If you think in terms of “what fraction of median income do you need to purchase exactly X” it becomes a different story. For example, dishwashers and microwaves were so expensive as to be inaccessible to many average people. Clothes cost a much higher fraction of average wage, as did food. A “great television” would be small and crappy by today’s standards and cost a higher fraction of median wages. Basically, except for the big stuff like houses, land, and financial assets - which again are worth talking about, but a separate problem caused largely by financialization (banks sell loans on the financial market which does all sorts of price inflating things at scale), globalization (now people from China are also interested in buying American assets), and changes to credit regulations (it used to be a hell of a lot harder to get a loan or credit card), not changes in the labor market or taxes - the median income can buy you a kingly standard of everyday living compared to what it was able to purchase in the past. 

Again, asset price inflation is a separate problem and worth talking about. It’s definitely not an optimal state when most people can’t afford a home even after years of saving. But in terms of their ability to purchase a high quality and quantity of everyday consumer goods, the average person today is very rich compared to the past."

TrueReddit,fdvvhx6,t3_en2ywf,1578751984.0,"A more direct mechanism here is to ban cookies and similar tracking mechanisms outright. That destroys a lot of the web’s advertising infrastructure which is fueling the clickbait/outrage porn half of the problem, as well as the niche targeting half that the author discusses. That’s a much more complete solution to the problem. 

Yes, that may mean we pay for google services and journals (since this destroys their revenue model), but how much is google and these news sources making per person anyway? I would be fascinated to see an analysis of the break even price for the average bundle of web content that an American consumes, if subscriptions had to replace advertising dollars. Then the question becomes, is society willing to say “we were implicitly paying $X/month by buying stuff we didn’t need and wouldn’t have wanted unless the glowing screen suggested it to us [which must be your premise if you’re selling a product and willing to pay to advertise it; if that sale would have happened without the ad why pay for an ad?], but that was destroying our society’s ability to talk about public problems so let’s explicitly choose to pay that same $X in subscription fees instead.” I suspect the answer would be no, but good policy makers would see it’s in the long term best interest of everyone to enact this kind of unpopular policy (like banning cookies and therefore causing subscription model) because discourse nuttiness really is a massive, massive problem in a democratic country. (Of course current politicians can’t be trusted to do anything that’s right and unpopular...)

The net result would probably be that the distribution of who’s paying would shift even if aggregate dollars paid don’t (instead of fewer heavy shoppers paying most of the implicit price via today’s advertising network, everyone pays the same per month). This would probably annoy people and cause folks to drop content they didn’t actually value at its break even price - but that seems like a good thing, but a bad thing. Maybe people will go back to, I dunno, reading books or going outside or playing games with their families or having constructive hobbies again.

TrueReddit,fdvrw72,t1_fdtnynj,1578750845.0,"True that everyone picked their newspaper - but the newspapers themselves were less polarized because they couldn’t target niches effectively. 

In 1950, if you’re running a newspaper, 1. your distribution network maxes out much smaller (takes longer to get stuff places physically and no digital delivery, and newspapers are only good same-day so long distance shipping is out) and 2. even if it wasn’t, your ability to identify people with niche tastes is low (you can’t automatically track what people read; at best you can choose stores or neighborhoods where you’ll advertise or sell your paper). Importantly, factor 2 prevents you not just from selectively excluding or including events for coverage but also from publishing things that will outrage part of your reader base. You can’t prevent part of your reader base from seeing anything, and they will adopt other news sources if you go beyond the pale. 

The outcome of 1 and 2 together is that If you need X people to buy your newspaper per day to stay in business, you used to have to find those X people within a smaller population set (because of 1, you just have a smaller geographic radius from your printing press); now, you have the entire English-speaking world to look for that same X number of people, so you can appeal to weirder tastes. And because you don’t need to worry about losing customers with non-fringe views (because factor 2 is no longer the case), you can publish more extreme views without taking in business risk - in fact it may support your business now given confirmation bias in your consume base.

AskReddit,fdmdk2i,t3_elzbiv,1578546443.0,"There are many kinds of snow. 

Some is small and hard and wet and nearly still rain, like mushy falling ice. That kind is bullshit and nobody likes it. It's heavy to shovel and doesn't have much smell. It's not quite sleet, it's snow, but it's bad snow. 

Some is light and consists of single perfect snowflakes falling individually, so when you catch one on your clothes and it stays for a moment before melting you can see how beautiful it is (like [this stock photo](https://www.alamy.com/stock-image-single-snowflake-on-a-wool-warm-mitten-160824657.html)). 

The best kind, in my opinion, is when it's about 20-25 degrees F and pretty humid for winter and you get big fluffy clusters falling, each about the size of the feathers that might come out of your pillow. When that kind falls, the whole world is hushed (because it's excellent at absorbing sound) and you can almost hear each flake falling. As it piles up, it usually stays fluffy and is excellent for playing in (though terrible for building snowmen or forts, unless it warms up a little in which case it is excellent because it bonds well then) and easy to shovel. 

There's a smell of snow that's similar to petrichor, but with the smell of winter too. Winter smells... a little less, and arid and cold, and a bit spiced like the sensation (but not the flavor) that you get with good cinnamon, and a bit like ice cubes that have been in the freezer for a bit too long but not way too long. Snow is a moister smell than plain old winter, except when you're in conditions that give you those little perfect individual flakes. 

Another thing to mention is the light, which is wonderfully diffused over everything while snow is falling. It's like cloud cover, but with each snowflake both dampening and reflecting light, and everything has a dim glow. And when the snowfall is over and the sun is up on the new fallen snow, it glitters like crystal at the right angle of light. The brightness of a sunlit snow field can be overwhelming. 

One of the other good parts is how it ornaments the trees and plants. On the evergreens and overwintering red berries, the contrast makes their colors seem very bright. And on the deciduous trees it wraps them in cotton, or increases the contrast between blue sky, white snow, and dark brown branches. A thicket of sleeping trees or brush under a new snowfall suddenly looks fascinating as you see all the detail.

boston,fdiahyu,t3_elfx3h,1578438680.0,"Median rent for a studio apartment is $1.4k/ month in Boston so let’s call it $1k conservatively across the state. The average adult spends $435/month on food and $150/month on utilities. That’s all taken care of for au pairs and should be counted as comp. 

So if the prior weekly stipend is $197, and there’s (52/12)=4.3 weeks in the average month, an au pair is monthly making:

(4.3*197=847)+1000 (free rent) + 435 (free food) + 150 (free utilities) = $2,432 a month in value - and remember that’s not using Boston rents, so in Boston this implied wage value is higher. 

MA minimum wage is $12/hr. So unless the au pairs are working more than (2432/12)=200 hours per month, which is (200/4.3)=47 hours a week, they already were making at least minimum wage under the original stipend terms.

“...heritabilities are substantial, often accounting for half of the variance of psychological traits. For example, for general intelligence, heritability estimates are typically about 50% in meta-analyses of older family, twin and adoption studies (Chipuer, Rovine, & Plomin, 1990; Devlin, Daniels, & Roeder, 1997; Loehlin, 1989) as well as newer twin studies (Haworth et al., 2010), with 95% confidence intervals on the order of 45% - 55%. For personality, heritabilities are usually 30% -50%.”

You’d have a portion of your harvest confiscated by the local authorities, and likely very few legal rights. No antibiotics, no modern medicine. And if you’re a woman you’re basically cattle. You probably couldn’t read, since only a small fraction of the population could, and you almost certainly had little to no formal education at all. Life was nasty, brutish, and short. 

Now we in the west are mostly lucky enough to have jobs inside, for about 8 hours a day (only 5 days a week!), and are able to buy modern technology like heat and light and plumbing. All you have to do is follow a few basic principles (train in something that makes enough money to support the lifestyle you want; show up on time; keep your promises; don’t spend money you can’t afford to spend; if you’re bringing a child into the world, do it as an adult with a partner and some modicum of financial security) and you’ll lead a better life than 99% of humans who have ever lived. Even if you fuck most of it up, if you aren’t homeless you’re still massively winning compared to all of human history.

Foodforthought,fcuzofv,t1_fct1s6k,1577991704.0,"It’s super distortive to do it this way though. Just give every native American individual like a million dollars or something. 

I’ve done consulting work for the government before, and there are all these requirements about having a certain percentage of state contracts going to certain minority-owner businesses. Generally that means you (as the prime contractor for the consulting agreement) hire a subcontractor who works for a minority owned business. Since their minority ownership gets them contracts easily, the quality of work is not high. And hilariously, many of the employees of this type of minority owned businesses are white. I’ve had a project where me and my team (from the real consulting company) worked 20-hour says to get stuff done, and the token dude who worked for a minority owned business did nothing for 8 hours a day because he was nice and we liked him but he couldn’t add value if he tried. 

And that’s not even talking about the fact that contracting requirements in the public sector (like making sure contracts go to minority owned businesses) makes it harder to submit a compliant bid for public sector work, which means otherwise qualified firms that could do the actual job are excluded from the bid process, which makes it less competitive, which means more expensive to get public work done. 

I think markets are a pretty efficient way to collectively express preferences and get things done. Correcting historical injustices is a moral imperative, but so is not creating unnecessary deadweight loss in the economy. Just give people money if they deserve compensation, don’t make zillions of little distortive changes to the economy in the hopes that they get money."

First, the study measuring how relaxed toddlers are after giving to charity tells us nothing about human nature and a lot about the values our current toddlers are told. I bet if you gave the same test to children of, say, romans or ancient warlords who value personal nietzschean uberman excellence, they would feel more relaxed after keeping stuff for themselves. Humans are incredibly social and the approval / disapproval of their social network is what will make a toddler sad or happy. 

Second, all the “look how they blow stop signs” stuff is confusing cause and effect. Maybe you get rich by being the kind of person who does things to your own advantage where possible! 

Third, their intro is laughable. Wealth is being able to live off passive income. Real interest rates are about 2-4% in the long run (so call it 3%). A happy but not extravagant life can be had at, say, $200k/year in free post-tax income (so call it 250k/year before tax to be safe, and that’s not accounting for money management fees). If you do the math, 250,000/.03 means you need $8.3M in capital to live an upper middle class quality life on wealth. And given market variability and money management fees, let’s call that $10M. So yeah, the guy with $3.5M net worth is right - he’s got some cash but he’s not wealthy."
