Phone will not at all be sufficient for accurate note taking and you can’t hand the client your phone full of notes when they leave the studio. Your notes can and will become critical to the completion of some projects and should live with the master tapes/hard drives forever-someone Might open these sessions in 10 years to address things they don’t like about the original release, or maybe to re-record songs with different band members (journey did this with all their greatest hits and assistant notes were crucial for recreating some sounds 30 years later.) Also, many clients have commented about being impressed that I’m using a notepad and obsessively taking notes. Pretty certain it got me hired for a few album projects haha

Always always always be available. This project is the top priority for everyone else involved, and it’s expected that you treat it that way as well. You don’t have other shit going on. Period. 

Don’t fart, don’t smell like anything at all, don’t disappear for 10 mins to shit, dont breath loudly, don’t be fidgety, don’t be distracted, don’t look at your phone, don’t be any kind of burden at all. You’re there to learn and help and earn your position. If you can’t be where I need you ALL the time, don’t bother showing up. 

Read manuals to really understand things at their core. Try to understand WHY and not just what or how. Engineering is all concepts and theory. You have to learn WHY a thing was done a certain way. The appropriate method will not be the same the next time you perform the same task-understand why. This is for technical problems, sonic problems, artistic things, creative choices, everything. “He prefers the digital one.” Why? “Oh cuz it doesn’t soften up his transients.” Why? “Oh! Tape compresses and has an eq effect!” Why? “Hmmm guess I need to do some technical reading!” And now you’re on your way to actually being a proper engineer. Do this with all things you have the energy for. Every day, find a thing you don’t fully understand and start with that thing. Understand “why”. 

There’s no such thing as “good enough.” There’s correct, and there’s something that isn’t correct. Period. 

Be neutral. You don’t have an opinion. Even if it’s asked, deflect that shit back. You have no idea what will set a creative persons brain into a spiral that could derail an entire project. 

Pay the closest attention to the tedious shit. Everyone else is focusing on the bigger picture things. Stay detailed af. From the lunch run, to the input list, to keeping track of takes.

Get REALLY good at writing down EVERYTHING. You can be Johnny on the spot on hour 11 when they’re tryna remember which of the 27 guitar takes was the one where he looked up and got really excited. You were there with your notebook watching and listening to everything and writing it all down live with the proper playlist number referenced. “Oh you said BABOOM!!! After take 27 (which is playlist 28 because playlist 00 is for the comp)” and now you’ve saved the day and a ton of headache.  Can’t stress how important note taking is at ALL times. Never rely on memory. Write that shit down. You WILL use the notes.  (This will also protect you if someone remembers something incorrectly and tries to blame you. “It says here, ‘get 7 packets of sugar, 6 sweet and sour, 14 napkins, and no olives.’ I dunno. I wrote what you said, so that’s what I did.” This kinda thing happens a lot and people really appreciate the attention to detail and it builds huge levels of trust.) 

Every single time you walk out of the room, scan for empty cups, bottles, wrappers, trash, etc and clean that shit up. Do this silently and if you’re unsure if someone’s done, gently ask and offer to get another fresher one of whatever. If you see someone else doing a menial task like this, offer to do it for them, and even kind of insist-“hey I got that!” With a smile and take the cup and run off down the hall excited. This also goes for keeping cables tidy and wrapped and out of the way. Constant constant vigilance. But make sure you check with the engineer before you touch anything. “Hey man, when they come in to listen, is it ok to run out there and tidy up that cable right there?” Keep wrapping up the instrument cables during guitar overdubs so it’s all tidy and quick and easy to mess with pedal and guitar and amp changes. Even if it’s just for five minutes. You look good staying busy and everyone appreciates the effort and detail. THIS makes you stand out from the lazy unwashed masses. 

Everything’s easy, all the time /s

Be very observant of habits and preferences. “Oh he likes it THIS way? I will commit 37 murders to make sure it’s legit ALWAYS this way.” This is for literally every single thing imaginable from where he always leaves his guitar pick, to certain colored sharpies being in certain places, to the air temp, etc. These are very fickle people doing a very intense thing and habits and preferences go a REALLY long way to making a smooth session. “Oh that’s the chair Johnny always makes sure he has. I’ll always arrange the room at the end of the night so johnnys chair is sitting in his spot when he comes in so he gets the one he likes.” Yes. I’m not joking. I’ve had to label chairs before haha

No matter what heights you achieve in this industry, remember that unless your name is on the marquee, it’s a SERVICE industry. You are a glorified waiter wether you’re Al Schmidt or joe shmo.  You’re there for other people’s projects and pleasure. 

And remember to try to have fun and appreciate what you’re doing! If it was easy, everyone would be where you are! Good luck! 💪"

Audio engineering is entirely subjective. There aren’t rules. “How should I set this up” is somewhat of a nonsense question, because the eq curve my voice needs and the eq curve yours needs could be entirely different. There are general guidelines and common fixes, but at the end of the day, you gotta use your ears. For this reason, you have to be very specific in asking for help.

fitmeals,fctl2jc,t3_eitq1i,1577947215.0,"Get a crock pot. Start with beef stews. Chicken in salsa verde is pretty fool proof. Use bones in your crock pot. Crock pot chicken and dumplings with tons of herbs and spice. 

Use lotsa spices and seasonings.

Tomato based Beef ragus seared in a pan and deglazed with red wine you pour into the crock pot will make you quit restaurants forever. 

Basic cooking is easy and fun and super rewarding, especially if you have friends or family to share with.

There was a one pan egg sandwich that trended for a while recently where you beat the eggs in the pan and dip the bread in the egg and I’ve been making them every day for a for months now-easy and amazing. I keep it delicious by using curry powder dumped in the butter (all eggs shojld have yellow curry powder) and some horseradish mustard drizzled inside after I flip before I fold. Little things like the mustard or some sautéed kale garlic and tomato in a simple egg and cheese Sammy with good seasoning can go forever. 

Get into seasonings:
Salt
Italian seasoning 
Herbs d’provence (ital season + lavender)
Dried red pepper flakes (like on pizza)
Fresh peppercorn medley
Yellow curry powder 

With these simple dudes, you can make all the super cheap sauces like $1.89 marinara taste like a restaurant (that’s all they’re doing anyway bcuz bulk). Fat (oil/butter) + herbs and spices/salt = cheap magic

Edit: Do wind sprints every 3rd day. One minute sprinting FULL TILT to induce your flight/fight response. It shojld hurt and feel like you’re gonna fall over. Try for a minute, but 30 seconds is enough if you’re still heavy. 
Walk around and catch your breath for twice as long as you sprinted. If you HAVE to sit, resist it and get up ASAP. The staging not-at-rest during breath recovery is part of the stomach fat burning. Stay standing and walking around as you can!! We’re only doing this 3 or 4 times. 
3x one minute FULL TILT PANIC sprints will set your body into a whole day of fat burning and explosive lean muscle growth. The reward of buttered curried eggs with merry cheddar goodness when you get home will make the 20 mins “working out” feel so good. 

Shower. Go to work still energized but feeling it. 

Watch your whole life change.
