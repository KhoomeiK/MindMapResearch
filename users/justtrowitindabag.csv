offmychest,ff9vr3q,t3_esgyq8,1579722566.0,"I literally felt the same way earlier today but I’m on the opposite end of the spectrum: ugly/fat. My “ugly” body is the only thing that matters: it’s what makes me unworthy of respect, attention, or admiration. And society is 100% okay with this. So either you’re looked down on for being fat, or you’re treated like a piece of meat for being a “10”. Sad, really. There’s no winning."
BingeEatingDisorder,ff0b9ol,t1_ff0ax9z,1579467147.0,Thank you for the tip!
BingeEatingDisorder,feyy9ge,t1_feywgfu,1579451938.0,It really is. I feel like MFP will help in letting me see those binges in number form now as opposed to later on the scale. Which is also why I recently bought one; to try and catch myself. I have to ask myself daily: “Is this where I want to be headed?”. I appreciate your kind words and the gentle tips/reminders to just brush it off and move forward. :)

BingeEatingDisorder,feuv2lo,t3_eqdkfs,1579390259.0,"I do the same thing. I think simply telling other people with similar struggles helps. I, for one, was glad to read this for the simple fact that it reinforces that I’m not alone. Honestly, delivery is the devil for those with our affliction. If you’re gonna order delivery, you could order groceries maybe? That way, you can eat something with some nutrition that might be a bit more satisfying and less likely to binge on. That’s something I did the other week when I felt the urge to order food delivery and I felt a lot better about it. Plus, it’s actual different food! Idk about you but I am SO SICK of all the delivery options near me. I’ve exhausted them all lol... also you’re welcome to message/DM me anytime you feel an urge coming on and maybe it will help! Just talking to someone who gets it could help."

Next day: wuh, I’m so gross I can’t believe I ate that entire box of Little Debbies yesterday. I need to stop. Oh? This old bag of SEMISWEET chocolate chips? Gross. *eats half the bag* alright and I’m still a fat piece of sh*t. Where’s some salt? Now I need sweet again. Then you wake up almost hungover after a real bender. It’s literally such a dehumanizing thing that you’re doing to yourself. Ugh. Thank you! I’ve been going a few days now without bingeing and it feels good, it makes me want to keep making healthy choices because my mental and emotional state is improving, making it easier to make better choices."

Do you mind me asking if you’ve been to a dermatologist about them? I’m just wondering how much help they are. I’ve never actually gone to one in my 15 years. Mostly because it just became apparent I need to these last 3 years. I’ve also gained quite a bit of weight in the last 3 years too so I think that has made them worse. Just curious what kind of knowledge and tips I can get from a fellow sufferer. Again I’m so sorry you have to go through this. These are seriously HELL."

loseit,fd2nzqx,t1_fd2msgs,1578149928.0,"Haha so there’s an official name for it but I can’t think of it. I got it from a yoga DVD a decade ago but I’m sure people still do them. So you start with standing at the top of your mat, then get down into push-up/plank position (focusing on proper form), bring your knees in underneath you, and stand up. That’s one, then you repeat. There’s no push-up actually being done, just the movement into that position, over and over again. It’s probably easy for someone who isn’t carrying a lot of extra weight but for me, it’s exhausting. I like that it makes me winded enough to break a sweat, while also allowing me to work on holding my body weight up and working on proper push-up position/plank form."

BingeEatingDisorder,fcmhcl9,t3_ehvf0p,1577775300.0,"I usually wonder the same exact thing after prolonged binging. Like what do I even do with myself? I usually just try and drink water. Simple. I don’t restrict or lie to myself and say I’m gonna eat healthy food. Eventually my body will crave the healthy/nutritious food. It’s just up to me whether or not I’ll give it anything resembling nourishment. Or if I’ll keep punishing. Usually guilt and restriction wind up doing the exact opposite of what I think they’re supposed to do. Sort of a mindf*** it all is, right? I guess... just be kind with yourself. For awhile last year, I’d journal out the emotions I’m feeling before blindly reaching for food. Everyone is different though and I can only speak for myself. But, yeah... water is always a good thing. And it’s fairly simple and easy!"

The article mentions it. She (my doctor) personally used it and has lost 90 pounds so far. She’s got me on the lower dose now.

Mind you, he moved back home and didn’t even have a bedroom. He would’ve rather been there than with me, which hurt. I resented him for that. I also kind of emotionally checked out of the relationship after he showed me his true colors one day. I had an infected tooth and was in a lot of pain. I wanted him to come back home (when we lived together still) and be with me so I wasn’t alone. I needed him. He was back home visiting and on his way to a party, and pretty quickly declined my request, while also cutting me off so he could start drinking with his friends while I was all alone and in pain. It’s not easy for me to ask for help so the fact that I did and made myself vulnerable, only to be rejected was incredibly painful. I don’t regret cheating on him.
