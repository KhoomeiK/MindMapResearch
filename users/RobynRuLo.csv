If both sets of parents have offered to foot the bill, just be mindful and try to shop around to get the best rates on vendors, decor etc, and maybe that will ease your mind, by knowing you made the effort not to over spend.

-If you deliver vaginally, push like you’re going poo, you use the same muscles to push out the baby. 

-Not only will your belly still be big, but if you do deliver vaginally, your whole crotch/butt area might feel gigantic. 

-A stool softener is helpful to make that first BM after delivery, not so scary! 

-Take advantage of the nurses helping you during your stay in the hospital, after baby is born. I was so sore it was hard to even sit up to get the baby to feed her. So I had to page the nurses for help. 

-If you are having a baby girl within the first couple weeks after being home, you might notice a tinge or blood in her pee diaper. That’s normal, it’s basically the last of moms hormones leaving her system. If the pediatrician at the hospital hadn’t told me that, I would have freaked out!"

It’s not so odd that he likes baths, but the fact he thinks he should be soaking in one while you are about to deliver a baby, thats what’s strange. The tubs are called BIRTHING tubs for a reason. I’d have some at the hospital talk to him, if he keeps being adamant about it.  

As far has him joining you in the tub, while delivering, that’s your decision. I don’t even know if they allow that for health reasons?!?
