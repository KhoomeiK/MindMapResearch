AmItheAsshole,fd7rbz3,t1_fd6onio,1578208882.0,"I don't think a name makes you unique as a person. I don't understand naming someone after someone else when billions of people have already held that name. You're not really naming your son after your grandfather. You're naming him after the countless other John's out there because it's such a common name. Cena, Stuart, Kennedy, Wayne... Like, there are so many John's. It would be more meaningful to name them after something else symbolic, not necessarily unique."
awfuleverything,fd6o9ko,t3_ejwsdc,1578193723.0,I was really hoping to come to the comments and see that the video was somehow fake. I'll never be okay again.
Catloaf,fd6nvzv,t1_fcxua3e,1578193593.0,I'm glad you both found each other. ❤️
HumansBeingBros,fd6frut,t1_fd615mb,1578190315.0,"Yeah, that's pretty drastic. At the very least, you can borrow a laptop from a friend. There is no way I could write all of my papers and do all of my research on my phone."

AmItheAsshole,fd53t00,t1_fd3me76,1578173941.0,"I like option number 4. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't understand why people name children after other people who had common names such as ""John"" or ""William."" There have been a billion John's already. I know it's a common practice, but it will never make sense to me. It would make more sense to give the child his own name, something symbolic."

Catloaf,fcwu4uy,t3_ej9jwz,1578037715.0,"That's how I got Yin. She was the neighborhood cat for about a year. I thought she was a stray, and I would feed her every now and then. 

Last August one of our neighbors who also fed her was moving and explained that Yin's (her name wasn't Yin) owner lived in the apartment next to hers, but they abandoned her there. They also explained that she had FIV.

That made me sad. I thought she was happy outside, but she was actually waiting to come home. I had been wanting a cat for a while, and my ex convinced me to adopt her. I caught her and took her to the vet. Life on the street was rough, but turns out she doesn't have FIV!!! I was so happy, not that I would love her any less. 

I've had her since October 27th. We're happy."

offmychest,fct1sa2,t1_fct17rm,1577930648.0,"This is definitely one of those tough days. I spent New Year's (night) alone for the first time. I went out and socialized, and actually talked to some really cool people who welcomed me into their group for conversation and drinks. Everyone was generally awesome. But nothing can replace true, meaningful friendships or relationships. On one hand I had fun last night, but as I sit here reflecting, I just feel empty."
offmychest,fcsz5lr,t3_eik7j7,1577928760.0,"I've tried to fight this feeling for years. In 2019, I spent most of my time trying to learn to be alone and be happy. It kind of worked. I even went on a trip out of state by myself, and I enjoyed it. But something was missing. College was the best time in my life. I met friends I could truly be myself around, and we had so much fun together. I still have those friends, but they all moved to different cities, and the friends who remain don't ever really have time to hang out, or they don't like doing the things I like to do. 

That leaves finding an SO, but dating here absolutely sucks. I'm literally only here to finish my master's at this point. I plan to move in January 2021. I hope to find my soulmate in the new city I move to or at least some great friends. I don't like depending on other's for my happiness, but I am genuinely not happy or fulfilled without others. I have a good job and a nice place to live, but without people to talk to and share with, it all feels a bit tedious and hallow."
MadeMeSmile,fcredti,t3_eihtpw,1577900702.0,I never understand why videos like these get so many upvotes. The comments are clearly slanted against the content.
AmItheAsshole,fcny9hu,t1_fcnwhuw,1577820772.0,"You may be right. OP could be the problem. But either way, the fact remains that they aren't real friends. It would be better for all parties if OP found a friend group that didn't feel the need to lie to her."

CityPorn,fcje9oc,t1_fcgrxut,1577684534.0,That was my first thought. I was hoping someone else noticed.
