AskReddit,fb1pl6k,t3_eaymhi,1576439419.0,"That women can hit me and I can't hit back. It's annoying as fuck and I put a stop to it with my current partner pretty damn quick. The first time she slapped me I dropped whatever we were arguing about and straight up said 'If you hit me again, I'll hit you back harder'.

Never had an issue since except for random strangers in bars n that. But if a women hits me now she'll get exactly the same treatment a man would get, and that's a broken nose."
