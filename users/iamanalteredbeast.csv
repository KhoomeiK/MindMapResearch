AskReddit,ffaexgt,t1_ffaeq04,1579734102.0,"You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head

No love, no pain, and no fear of dread

Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort

And your savoir faire is to kill for sport

You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle

And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle

So crooked and curled is your point of view

There is no other creature more malicious than you


I'm completely satisfied

My other life I will not miss

An altered beast until I die

And I will not give up on this

Never!


True, I went to hell and back

But it was so I could be this

An altered beast until the end

And I will not give up on this

Never!


I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

Altered Beast protect me

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything


You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive

And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive

But the longer you live, and the longer you kill

There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill

The void that you feel within would suggest

That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest

And whatever you do, there's no turning back

You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac


Emptiness inside of me

And hollowness all around me

I cut myself to see it bleed

And now I don't feel anything

Never!

Insincere and trivial

The world is void of all meaning

And God is so less visceral

And now I don't feel anything

Never!

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

Altered Beast protect me

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

Altered Beast protect me

I don't feel heinous

I don't feel no pain

I don't feel nothing

I don't feel anything

The sole thing that will make your void obsolete

Is to find someone new, some sapid, fresh meat

Altered beast, alter me

Altered beast, alter me

I think I see

An Altered Beast

Inside me
