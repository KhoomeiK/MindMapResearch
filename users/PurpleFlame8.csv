TwoXChromosomes,ffaqxeb,t3_eskxr6,1579742403.0,Why don't you bring this up with your father and see what motivated his comment? Could be he is putting all of his money in to his cabin. Or maybe he doesn't like your fiance.
TwoXChromosomes,ffafoe5,t3_esj28y,1579734650.0,"I recall a girl in Afghanistan who had bern raped by a man and was threatening to kill herself if he would not marry her. This stems from the idea that raped girls and women are ""damaged"" and would be undesirable for other men to marry, and in cultures where it is not feasible for these girls and women to support themselves, not being able to marry often dooms them to a life of poverty.

Fuck all of that."

It could be blindness on his part or it could be something like he didn't have any photos of the women or it could be something symbolic like he was thinking of this as a gift from fathers/ggrandfathers to daughters, or it could even symbolize the deterioration of the patriarchy. Like when Queen Elizabeth II became Queen Regina (queen regina is a queen who ascended the throne and holds the power of a king while queen consort is a queen who attained the title of queen through marriage and does not hold the power traditionally ceded to kings)."

TwoXChromosomes,ff9eopd,t3_esebc9,1579711398.0,"Dear, your problem is one of shallowness and hypocrisy.

I used to feel repulsed at the thought of unattractive people being attracted to me but then I realized that I was being shallow and hypocritical and had to face that this repulsion stemmed from my own insecurities. I didn't want to embody those characteristics. An ugly person can judge beauty as well as a beautiful person. I am now flattered regardless of the attractiveness of the person who thinks I am attractive. If you are worried that unattractive people expressing interest in you are doing so because they see you more on their level, thus indicating that you are also not very attractive, well hey, maybe! If you are going to be concerned how others look then you are also going to have to take a look at yourself in the mirror."

BPDlovedones,fep1km8,t3_epqszx,1579310084.0,"I can tell you this because I've dealt with both kinds of people.

People with HPD are drama queens and want to be the center of attention. They frequently lie or embellish for dramatic effect. Interactions with them can feel shallow because, in some sense, they are putting on a show to draw attention to themselves, rather than putting their energy in to forging deeper connections with people.

People with BPD lack a sense of self and feel that their identity is defined by other people. They use people as security blankets. However they experience intense emotions and this often leads to idolization of others, then devaluation when that same person fails to meet expectations. They see tend to see people as all good or all bad, typically have stormy relationships, and can be extremely self destructive because of their inherent feelings of inferiority coupled with their emotional instability and impulsivity. They will also lie but these lies are to cover their own ass or to hurt others.

There are other similarities but they are coming from different places. For reference:

BPD: Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, Kelly Kapoor from ""The Office"", Gaius Baltar from ""Battlestar Galactica: The mini series"".

HPD: Jack from Will and Grace."
