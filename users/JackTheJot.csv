ffxiv,fe6rhoj,t3_enma54,1578901944.0,"So I've been having random black screens popping up. The first time it happened it led to FFXIV and discord and parts of Windows crashing. When I rebooted it was fine, but periodically during gameplay my screen would randomly turn black, sounds would still play for a few seconds, then turn back. It would happen every minute or so until FFXIV finally crashed when I tried changing it from fullscreen to borderless windowed mode. Upon relaunch, I turned of DX11 and switched it to DX9 and it seemed to fix the problem. 

Then when I tried to change it back to DX11, the black screen would happen IN the launcher before the game even launched.

I'm running Windows 10, GPU: 1080ti, CPU: i7-7700k, 16GB of DDR4 RAM. I reinstalled my NVIDIA driver's and have yet to see if that fixed it. I'm also going to do a stress test on my GPU to make sure it's not dying."

-	There was an explosion at the Baghdad International Airport
-	An Iranian military leader General Qassem Soleimani, second only to the Prime Minister of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei, was killed in the explosion
-	Confirmed to be an air strike by the US ordered by Trump; confirmed to be an assassination 
-	Iran says there will be a retaliation against the US sometime on Sunday the 5th of January but no attack has happened as of yet
-	Trump tweets that if Iran strikes back, 52 sites of both high and cultural importance will be attacked by the US which is considered a war crime
-	Iran unfurls (reveals) red flag meaning that they are ready for war
-	Iraqi Parliament votes to expel all US forces from Iraq
-	Irani PM Ayatollah Khamenei says that only US military sites will be targeted and that the problem is the administration and not the American people
-	It is revealed by the Iraqi PM that Trump had called him to mediate between the US and Iran, leading to Soleimani being in Iraq in the first place. (I have to remain impartial but you can connect the dots)
