MakeNewFriendsHere,feoxx21,t3_eq375c,1579307785.0,"I've been seeing this for a long, long time, and it's incredible that it happens in mostly every country because I have had chats with people from around the world. But no matter the place, you always find many that just answer your questions and never return them, that show 0 interest in your comments. In my opinion, there is no advice for them; they are just like that, or it is just that we don't raise an interest in them while other people will do. Who knows; I ghost them as soon as I discover them."
depression,feotoke,t3_eq6emp,1579305310.0,"31 years old and never worked. Too depressed to find a job before, too old to find a job now. Still, they tell me I have hope, I can do courses and get more studies, that I'm young and all that so I'm trying my best. Even so, I wish I had your age and some pressure. My family don't care about me getting a job or not, my mother even thinks I may never get one. Anyway, you are still in time, not all bosses are the same. Perhaps you can do a small course, I don't know how is education in your country or what programs do the government offer, but trust yourself and don't let others put their ideas inside you. You are not worthless nor a leech, that's for sure."
ugly,femx71z,t3_epvcq1,1579271949.0,"Well I'm a black belt and I'm in a good shape, so I know I can crush a lot of pretty people. Lol, I'm joking. I mean, I really am a black belt and all that but I give a fuck about beauty people in the way they don't make me feel inferior. 

In a way it's because I've been in 2 relationships, so if you have the chance, do it. If a person chooses you, it's because what's inside you. Have you checked the internet to search ugly people in relationships? You would be surprised. Personality is what matters and what we are. We live inside a ball of meat and bones that we don't choose. We can edit it to a certain point, but some things are unchangeable. I know it well since I have a face paralysis and strabismus. Yet I have had relationships with all that's included in them, you know. 

So the trick is simple but hard to follow: stop caring about the appearance. In the end, we will all be old and wrinkled and later, corpses. So you rather have to focus on your skills and personality traits. Beautiful and average looking people have problems too, yes, and I mean a lot of them are evil, arrogant, false, unaware of everything except themselves, have mental issues... and a lot of more things. Of course not all of them are like that, and not all ugly people are angels inside, but I think my idea can be understood."
toastme,femk3ig,t3_epy8qu,1579259593.0,"I'm sure you can overcome this situation, you look so young yet!

Needafriend,fejqocq,t3_epf77n,1579183421.0,I hope you find the proper person for her. Perhaps you can check Interpals if you don't know it. It's a good place to search for friends!

Let me know if you want to try to chat!"
introvert,fegjs2n,t3_ep0xiz,1579094906.0,"Yes, I experienced this during my last three courses. I wanted to be alone during the resting time, reading or doing whatever I wanted. Nobody said a thing during the first days cause we were all unknown people, but some started asking me to go with them after a while. I refused most of the times by stating that I preferred to stay alone. I don't care too much about what others can think, to be honest, haha. I accompanied them a few times, but that was only useful to realize that it wasn't my place. They were people I didn't connect with, anyway."
Needafriend,fegbyfh,t3_eosnuh,1579086921.0,"I don't know what happened to you, and it would be good to know more details, but it's sad that you came to that conclusion at such a young age. I can't complaint about that, though, cause I have had similar thoughts. But the need of socializing always pushed me out of mi isolation, sooner or later. However, I evolved with time. I learned to appreciate my time alone; yes. Alone I'm safe, alone I can do whatever I like, alone nobody judges me. Loneliness (or solitude, that sounds better) won't betray you. I learned to see solutide as a warm embrace instead of a curse, and everything went better. I also took a sentence as one of my mottos: ""people come and go"". Think deeply about that: friends, lovers, even family... In the end, the only person that will remain with you forever is yourself.   


On the other hand, I think life is short, so fuck it, I'm not going to hide. That's why I'm always transparent with people I just know, and if they go, I don't care. I'm always conscious about that possibility. It's a nice surprise when someone stays for days, weeks, months and even years, but I don't expect that to always happen. Well, I learned this because I'm an introvert, I have had many deceptions and I guess I'm pretty different from regular people, you know, that mass of similar minds and tendences. 

I hope you can improve yourself in a way or another. Seek help if you need, do whatever you need to feel better, but never hurt yourself cause you are the most valuable person of your life."
Needafriend,fegalne,t3_eoyukk,1579085087.0,"I agree with your nice words. I'm fairly new here but I'm conscious about what friendships are and the time required to find a proper one. I think you find it if you are patient enough and take things in a positive way. Of course it depends on the person: ways of thinking, conversation skills, hobbies, etc. So some will find friendships sooner and some will find them later!"

bullying,fedazft,t3_eojiqf,1579006164.0,"Listen, never ever, nunca (as you are learning Spanish I guess you understand that) jamÃ¡s kill yourself for another person, specially because a rejected love. Forget about her and forget about your promise. Life will forgive you. Look, I started my first relationship when I was 19 years old. Don't feel pressed by your age and what others could think. Things come at their own pace, and this girl ignored you in the end so it's clear that she is not the one for you. You know, sometimes we idealize people and we think things about them that aren't true. I ""fell in love"" many times when I was a teenager, and now that I'm 31 years old I realize I was such a fool cause I never really knew these girls. Don't fall in love just cause a girl is nice to you or because you have some laughs. Falling in love requires weeks or even months of comprehension, sharing ideas and experiences, and what is more important: trust. The thing has to be mutual all the time, like a tennis match and not you playing alone against a wall.   


On the other hand, I recommend you therapy. You seem a very senstive person, but you got obssessed with that girl. I don't want to sound mean, but that's my impression. You can't force other person to love you by giving her/him presents or details, that's no the way love ""works"". You connect or not with the other person, and that's all. Even if sometimes you think you connected with that person, but the person doesn't think the same. Help yourself now, focus only on yourself for a time. Find what you like to do, and your pride. You have a lot to learn before entering a healthy relationship, but I don't know your life so I can't give you better advice. Well, there is something clear: DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE FOR ANYBODY. 

Life isn't a field of flowers and a lot of people is pure shit, but you are still so young and in time of finding your purpose in life or something to keep going for (and it mustn't be related to other person, it must be related to yourself). 

Saludos."

If you are depressed at school, only those who know you will know what's happening and the others don't matter, if you skip school, you have your reasons. If you exist, you still have something to do, if you sleep is because you need and deserve to rest. If you are awake, you have the chance to do things. But if you kill yourself, there is no turning back. 

The others don't matter, people is a too twisted measurement to measure yourself."
depression,fdqfz62,t1_fdq2wij,1578665700.0,"I agree with you, there is always someone that can help. I went to therapy once and found a great professional. I met her once on the street, she was talking with a friend and she stopped to greet me and even ask me how was I doing. Later, I invited her to an event and she said she would consider it, but she called me  later to tell me it wouldn't be proper since she was my therapist. I appreciated the detail of call, thing that some ""friends"" don't do many times.
