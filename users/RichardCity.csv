There's a local brand of higher quality cheese that's sells in these small palm sized squares. Frequently I had people come into the bar looking to sell this cheese they stole, and were taking to all the bars they could in the hopes that someone would buy it. Half the time I was the only one in the bar I so I'd tell them to take their sweaty cheese elsewhere. They brought a lot of weird stuff, like expired sausage, and olivieri tortellini. Management said to tolerate it because the patrons liked it. I hated that job."

Once I asked her what her Mom had thought of her husband (who just to keep things straight was actually the woman who catfished me's husband) and she kind of laughed and said that she knew she had made a mistake. It was really gross realizing she was talking about her husband and not her dad. I could go on about the weird things she did, but I'm bad for oversharing, and I've probably overshared more than enough."

He tells me its cobra sake, and asked me if I wanted some. I was going through a very experimental sort of time in my life so I said absolutely. At the time I kept a pretty long beard, and when I drank the cobra-sake  (there were scorpions, spiders, and a smaller snake in the cobra's mouth, that possibly had a smaller snake in its mouth) some of it got onto my beard on my upper lip. Now, the stuff tasted bad. It smelled worse, and the smell got into my beard. I washed it with soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and it left a smell that would not leave. Cobra-sake should definitely not be drunk."

AskReddit,fdk3n7r,t1_fdja09k,1578495260.0,"Canada signed a treaty that aimed to reduce stateless people. Wikipedia summarizes part of it: ""Absent circumstances of fraudulent application or disloyalty toward the contracting state, deprivations and renunciations of citizenship shall only take effect where a person has or subsequently obtains another nationality in replacement."" 

I think that means that usually a person can't have their citizenship revoked in Canada unless they have a country where they can obtain citizenship. I think when there's another country that they can obtain citizenship in, they're usually deported, but I'm not 100 percent sure. I'm not sure what happens when they've been disloyal, or fraudulent.
