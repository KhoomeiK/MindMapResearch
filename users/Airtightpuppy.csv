ChronicPain,fez7m60,t1_fexcl6b,1579454518.0,"This IS helping our fellow human beings. I support this because it helps those suffering with addiction. What the fuck is wrong with you? Should people continue to be jailed because they're trying to satisfy a craving for a substance? If people want to continue using a drug, even after they've been educated on its consequences and offered a variety of treatment programs, then they should have the fucking choice to use the drug safely. This allows a safe method for them to obtain the substance. It is a way to protect them from street drugs. They are offered programs to give up the drugs completely or go on maintenance medication when enrolled in this too. I really see absolutely nothing wrong with this. This will help stabilize addicts, while also reducing the number of them dying. I really fail to see what you even mean by your message since NOT doing this is cruel negligence of addicts. Why possession of any drug is illegal is beyond me, to be honest."
Fibromyalgia,fex35jv,t3_eqnsd0,1579423532.0,"It never helped me much in regards to anything I suffer with. It made my depression and anxiety worse.i just stay away from it altogether now. I do know people who say it helps them tremendously, so it's worth a try if it's legal for you."
ChronicPain,fevuhe7,t3_eqpffn,1579401663.0,"Wait, what's ridiculous about it. I'm confused because it seems you support it."
Fibromyalgia,fdwpund,t1_fdw0332,1578761231.0,"Fibro is a neurological disorder, so a drug just needs to reach the brain and spinal cord to provide relief, which will automatically happen if it's able to cross the blood brain barrier. Also, a drug can still help even if it is fascial adhesions since the brain is the processing center of the pain coming from them. If the drug can intercept the pain signal leading from the adhesions to the brain, it has helped."
Fibromyalgia,fdwoybh,t3_en6nty,1578760943.0,"No, that's not true. There are a few drugs that have specifically been shown to treat fibro. Cymbalta and Lyrica are the main two, with Lyrica seeming to be the more effective one. There are also plenty of medications that can be used off label to help. Plus, even though there are a few small studies saying opioids don't work, millions of people with fibro take them and benefit from them. The idea that opioids don't work or make fibro worse only started to surface after the opioid epidemic in the U.S. started. If a doctor says medication can't really help fibro, they aren't informed on the disease. Diet changes and exercise can possibly help, but will never cure you, so sometimes medications are necessary. Lyrica is seen kind of the staple of treatment of fibro, but it can have severe side effects for some and, while less than opioids, it is still potentially addictive. The UK is currently noticing a major increase in lyrica abuse, so getting that there may be difficult. Either way, I'd say to consider seeing another doctor."

depression,fdsonng,t1_fds55m9,1578705959.0,"Some people certainly do use it to wallow in pity and that's not healthy, but it doesn't always have to be like that. I personally enjoy ""sad music"" because it helps me process and release my negative thoughts and emotions. It's cathartic and calming and I feel better afterwards. I've listened to what people would call sad music many times because I couldn't stop crying and after listening I wasn't crying and I felt content and ready to get back to my day. I think it's all about how you use it."
depression,fdso07p,t3_emx959,1578705714.0,"I used to be like that too. I grew up in a small town in a religious family. My father and brother knew I was less masculine and more sensitive from a young age and would make fun of me a lot throughout childhood. They were very vocal as I was growing up that they would ""beat the shit out of faggots"", so that made me stay closeted for a long time. I even continued to try to date girls into my first 2 years of college, until I just got so tired of living a double life that I decided I just had to come out, but slowly. I started with just a few close friends, then my mom and they were all very accepting. I started dating and felt somewhat relieved, but I still couldn't be honest about who I was dating with the rest of my family. I finally came out to my entire family following an argument my grandmother picked with me about how the ""gay agenda"" was harming and fooling young adults. I'll be honest, a few family members didn't accept me at first. To my surprise though, my brother and father both said it was no big deal and they just wanted me to have a partner in my life. I still have family members who disagree with me being gay, but they've accepted that I'm out and am going to live my life this way, so we are civil. Sorry for such a huge message, but I wanted to let you know my journey so it could possibly make you feel better. It can definitely improve and coming out is terrifying, but it would surprise you how many people reconsider their negative view on gay people when one of their family members is one. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Hope you're doing okay today. Hang in there:)"
ChronicPain,fdsm59u,t1_fdsfo5r,1578704993.0,"I have actually seen a few sources talking about amphetamines and opioids increasing each other's analgesic properties. I'm actually surprised they haven't made a combination half and half drug of an opioid and amphetamine together. I think it's because each one on its own already has a high potential for abuse, so combining them may increase that risk, but I'm not sure. I do also know that along with what you said, taking an amphetamine with a daily opioid reduces the risk of fatal respiratory depression significantly. And I know, I'm hoping the vyvanse percocet combination works for a long time, but I know it's likely that the combination will lose some effectiveness. But hey, that happens. I've changed many anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants because they lost their effect. It's just a reality for nearly all medications. My doctors have back up plans if that does happen, though, so for now I'm just going to live and try to enjoy my life."
ChronicPain,fdsdywk,t1_fdsaqaq,1578700487.0,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD as well. I think I know the blood pressure medication you're talking about since it's commonly given for PTSD and nightmares. It's called prazosin and I'm on it. I had the problem of nearly passing out several times, but I had my dosage decreased and I'm okay now. Fainting and falling is very common with it, especially when you first start it. Be careful asking about vyvanse or adderall by name since they may assume you're drug seeking, which is stupid but it's what they do. Plus, even though it has helped my anhedonia, mood, and energy levels, it's not prescribed for that reason. So asking for it for those reasons will likely just get you a lecture. If you have ADHD symptoms though, you could possibly get it and benefit from it in several ways."
ChronicPain,fdru71x,t3_emwmr7,1578689760.0,"This seems to be common for chronic pain patients, myself included. It's hard to derive pleasure from anything when you're always suffering from pain. It can be very hard to deal with. For me personally, I was put on vyvanse for ADHD and, surprisingly, it has helped the anhedonia a lot. I'm guessing it's because I'm likely lacking in dopamine due to the constant stress of pain and can't seek reward normally due to the pain as well. Vyvanse acts strongly on both of these areas of the brain and I've noticed I'm more content and can handle the stress of the pain better now. Don't get me wrong, I still take my pain medications, but I'm more mentally able to deal with the good things I miss out on because of pain. Plus, it just greatly reduced feelings of anhedonia for me. I can enjoy things more since I've been on it. I know it wasn't prescribed for that, but I'll take those benefits along with the benefits for ADHD."
Nootropics,fdrr1up,t3_emw0tt,1578688360.0,"I decided to look up research on this a little and I just found something that certainly makes it seem to be the case. ""Based on studies in rodents the stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors generally produces learning impairments by interfering with memory-encoding mechanisms. In contrast, antagonists of 5-HT(1A) receptors facilitate certain types of memory by enhancing hippocampal/cortical cholinergic and/or glutamatergic neurotransmission."" This talks about memory encoding, but since retrieval is all about how a memory was encoded, it's plausible that a 5 HT1a antagonists helps with memory retrieval as well as encoding. This is in rats, though, so nothing conclusive for humans. 
Also, here's the link to the article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18394726/"
Nootropics,fdrq10r,t3_emw0tt,1578688018.0,"Actually, yes it is believed that 5 HT receptors are important for memory function to some extent. There isn't much more specifics on the topic, like if it's specifically 5 HT1a or other ones. Also, it's not known whether the receptors provide a physiological protection of memories or if the method of action is mediated by psychological effects from receptor activation or inhibition. But, I'd say that it's completely possible for trazodone to help long term memory recall since it does affect 5 HT receptors."
ChronicPain,fdrcwel,t3_emuyqr,1578682665.0,"Well, for me, I've dealt with the same level of pain for over 5 years now, so I can't say that I believe I will improve without medication, exercise, and diet. I do think it's possible for chronic pain to remit, but that chance diminishes more and more every year more of pain. I still hope something can change for me someday, but at this point I truly don't even know what lifestyle, behavioral, and medication changes would benefit me. I've tried soooooo many treatments and lifestyle changes over the past 5 years. So I haven't lost all hope, but I've run out of new things to try and frankly I was driving myself crazy looking for some non tested treatment to help me. I've accepted my current circumstances and I manage okay these days."
panicdisorder,fdr3evq,t1_fdr1myt,1578678939.0,"Yeah, I'm on lyrica for nerve pain, but just happened to notice how helpful it was for my anxiety. And of course, you can message me anytime. We have two things in common after all, nerve pain and anxiety so I can understand what you're going through. I don't mind at all Haha. Your sentences seem just fine on here, so you're fine."
depression,fdr2dbk,t3_empvyi,1578678552.0,"I used to say this all the time too. The only reason I don't really think it now is because my depression is mostly in remission. But I still think it's a likely scenario since I know Mental illness dramatically increases that risk, plus past suicide attempts increase the risk even more. I may feel quite a bit better now, but I won't be like this the rest of my life. I know that severe crippling depression will come back at some point. I'm just trying to manage it when I do feel it coming back. Plus, I don't think like that much now because I'm better now and thinking about when I feel worse is completely pointless. It's possible that you improve a good amount at some point too. It took me 9 or 10 years before I improved at all, so it is possible. But I understand how it doesn't seem that way while in a depressive episode."
ChronicPain,fdr1ce7,t1_fdqnvz2,1578678170.0,"There really should only be type 1 pharmacy staff. The only other thing they should do is make sure something isn't some obviously incorrect dosage or they're aren't any dangerous interactions between medications. Other than that, where do they get off being a judge in that setting. I don't care if a staff member thinks opioids are causing society's downfall, they should fill them as long as it's legal and approved by the prescribing doctor."
ChronicPain,fdr0v3o,t3_ems26h,1578677955.0,"God, I've had the same thing happen before, except with norco. I had filled 7.5s 2 and half weeks prior to getting a prescription for 10s. My doctor, like yours, wanted me to hold onto the 7.5s just in case. The pharmacy gave me such a hard time and kept trying to tell me ""you HAVE to bring back the others to get this filled."" My doctor talked to a manager I think and it was eventually filled. I learned after that to move all my meds to a small local pharmacy. They tend to be much more understanding than places like CVS and Walgreens. What really is counterintuitive about pharmacies being so strict with opioids is that it makes people who do get an increase, want to actually keep the old ones because of how hard they are to get. All this hysteria is seriously only doing harm to everyone and causing so much stress for people who need these medications. Besides, reducing opioid prescriptions just led addicts, and even some desperate pain patients, to turn to street opioids and spiked the death rate. I understand that the U.S. did prescribe opioids pretty liberally at one point, but they've gone way too far. You should consider another pharmacy if your current one is like that."
Nootropics,fdqzagj,t1_fdqrc27,1578677265.0,"I haven't found a single article on light wavelengths affecting cognition in humans. If you do know of something, I'm completely open to changing what I believe. I'm just saying that the evidence is lacking, not that it doesn't affect it for sure."
panicdisorder,fdqz0w3,t3_emrdgx,1578677106.0,"When I was having really bad anxiety and panic attacks, I found this happened too. It was really bad for me because I started to avoid all things funny, which just made depressed and empty, plus it didn't help because the panic attacks still happened. I feel for you. I still vividly remember what it was like to having multiple panic attacks a day, every day for months. I'm so thankful that I'm better these days. Panic attacks happen rarely now. But I'm on zoloft and lyrica to help prevent them (the lyrica has been an absolute life changer). I've also been in therapy for years, which helped too. I hope that you can find something that helps you with your panic attacks too. I can't imagine how hard it must be to have had that experience :( If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to message me."
gabagoodness,fdqbzsv,t1_f7zf3p8,1578662526.0,"I'm glad it was low level for you, but it most certainly has not been all in my head, especially because the first few times I quit it cold turkey, I didn't expect withdrawal symptoms. I have never felt so bad in my life as when I have quit high dose lyrica cold turkey. I had no idea why I felt that way, but I truly thought I was going to lose my mind from the myriad of symptoms. I've come off both opioids and benzos in the past and, in my opinion, lyrica was much worse. Oh my god, it was the worst. I'm back on it now and know that when I stop, I have to taper. I also have stopped any abuse of it because that's what mainly got me in trouble. Typically, the people who suffer severe withdrawals are those who take it for more than a year and those who consistently took high doses, way above therapeutic doses. I fall under both of those, which is why it was absolute hell to stop it back then."
ChronicPain,fdq584c,t1_fdpr1hg,1578655398.0,"That's fair enough. I personally don't think tylenol should be in any narcotic medications because research shows it doesn't actually reduce abuse potential, nor does it help pain more. It simply just puts a strain on your liver. But my doctor still thinks percocet is best for me, so I'm grateful for it."
depression,fdq4x5u,t3_emnl5m,1578655006.0,"Not only would people be more understanding about being unwell, but I also used to wish I'd get cancer because I was ready to die but couldn't commit suicide because of family. I even got to the point of a type of jealousy of a family friend who died from cancer a couple years ago. It's terrible but it's how I felt. Surprisingly, I don't wish for cancer anymore. My depression is in remission for the most part. And I'm someone who used to think it was completely impossible for me to improve. Trust me, it can happen, but I understand that feeling."
ChronicPain,fdppe6q,t1_fdpp5hv,1578635552.0,"Oh yeah, I've gotten the disbelief about the amount of medications I take as well. I've actually gone down on them. I used to take 13 different ones every day, several times a day. Now I'm only on 7 a day, several times a day. I still get criticism for that amount, but I don't give a shit. They are helping me and my doctors want me on them. But I do hope they get the message and you're able to do that. You could also ask for percocet in case they're worried about abuse or something with the oxycodone alone. I honestly don't think it matters either way, but I've had doctors give me percocet but deny oxycodone ir because it had ""too much abuse potential"". Percocet works the same, just has a little tylenol with it."
ChronicPain,fdpodt2,t1_fdpo7zf,1578634562.0,"Well, maybe you could just say that to them. It would be cheaper for IR formulary. And that it would be the overall same oxycodone dosage for the day."
ChronicPain,fdpn50c,t1_fdpmj38,1578633407.0,"I'm very lucky because Indiana has something called the Healthy Indiana Plan, which is a division of Medicare but a state specific program for people who aren't eligible for Medicare. Since I'm out of work currently and was denied disability, my monthly payment is $1 and I have $0 copays at doctors, specialists, and all my prescriptions. It's a great program to help those of us who need good health insurance, but have little to no income. You can earn up to $26,000 a year I believe, your monthly payment just goes up, but it never gets that high. But yeah, oxycontin, even though there is a generic now, is still expensive. Honestly. IR oxycodone 4 times a day, 120 a month could be better for you because it's much cheaper than 60 oxycontin, plus like you said it's preferred so it's covered by your insurance. It's the same drug, so nothing would be changing except you'd have to take a pill every 6 hours, but it would give you more consistent relief, at least it did for me. Percocet is the same drug except it has some tylenol too, so I've been where you are. I take 10mg percocet 4 times a day, so I actually take twice the amount of oxycodone you do. It's just something to consider though. I hope you find something that helps you have more consistent pain relief."
Nootropics,fdpkoha,t1_fdpkfut,1578631277.0,"You're right. There is some evidence on blue light from electronics affecting sleep patterns. That's not a direct effect on cognition, but it's true that indirectly it can affect it since interrupted sleep affects cognition. But electronic blue light still doesn't directly affect cognition, there's just evidence of it affecting sleep. But that's also only use of them within an hour or two of bed."
ChronicPain,fdpj1wf,t1_fdpdme5,1578629960.0,"I definitely understand what you're going through. I've been on oxycontin before for my chronic pain and it didn't last 12 hours for me either. I now just take percocet 4 times a day. That seems to work better for me, but I obviously am taking a pill more times throughout my day. It's worth it though. Maybe ask about that or immediate release oxycodone 4 times a day instead of oxycontin. Either way, I feel for you and hope things get better for you."
Nootropics,fdpihjh,t1_fdpi23o,1578629524.0,"I'm aware of light wavelengths affecting many parts of the body. The question here was about how it affects cognition. This page says nothing about cognition. It does talk a little about depression, which I did mention. I'm not saying light has no effect on us, just that evidence for it directly affecting cognition is scarce."
researchchemicals,fdph9ds,t3_eminlo,1578628582.0,"I would say maybe you could replace the benzo with Gabapentin or Pregabalin, if you happen to have one of them. It would probably lessen the cns depression that you'd have with a benzo and mess with the other things less, while still being a pretty calming anticonvulsant that would round it out. But you're right to not want molly while taking SSRIs. Still, SS is a rare occurrence unless one is on high doses of more than one serotonergic medication, plus use substance that increases serotonin as well. Just be careful and watch for any symptoms of SS if your friend does do anything."
ChronicPain,fdpexz9,t3_emiac0,1578626881.0,"To better days for you as well! I still remember my first 3-9 months of dealing with chronic pain. It was hard to deal with, especially the part of getting doctors to believe me. I eventually did find the right pain management doctor and even a good therapist and psychiatrist. It took going through a few different doctors, but was worth it. As someone who has had chronic pain for 5 and half years now, just know that if you have a doctor that doesn't believe you or isn't helpful, not at all doctors are like them. It's much harder to get treated seriously for pain than it was for me in 2014 due to the opioid crisis starting around 2016/2017, but they're still out there. If you are in need of opioids, just know they will be difficult to get and you will get a very low dose when you do get a prescription. If you're not in need of opioids for whatever reason, you'll have an easier time with doctors. If you aren't wanting to get an opioid prescription, tell doctors that right after you talk about the pain so that it makes it more likely for them to tell you about other options, rather than lecture you on how bad opioids are. Just know there is nothing wrong if you do take opioids or feel that you need them to deal with your pain. Be aware of their risks and you'll be fine. Same with other medications like gabapentin and lyrica (which are commonly used for chronic pain, I'm on lyrica personally). I hope you're hanging in there and I'm glad to hear you know you're not alone. Personally, feel free to message me if you need to talk or want advice/information from someone who has been where you are in the past. You will learn to manage it better, I promise."
Nootropics,fdpe32i,t3_emktn1,1578626275.0,"To be honest, there is little evidence at all of it affecting humans, at least in a significant way. There is some new evidence of blue light helping depression somewhat and possibly anxiety. The evidence is pretty limited, though.

ChronicPain,fdp0n0b,t3_emh3x7,1578617188.0,"I have had psychiatrists who grilled me intensely on seeing a pain management doctor and being on opioids. They try to tell me what to take as if they specialize in pain and know more than an actual pain management doctor. They have just said some of the basic things like: ""Have you tried tylenol and ibuprofen?"" ""Have you tried physical therapy"". As if I went straight to opioids when I started having pain. I see a psychiatrist know who understands and is okay with me getting opioids as long as both her and the pain management doctor know what the other is prescribing and I understand the risks of everything I take."
researchchemicals,fcglmw9,t1_fcgkvfb,1577641423.0,"Oh yeah, 600mg is totally fine. I was put on 800mg 3 times a day by my doctor. I was fine when I was at 600-900, but taking 3,200mg a day for over a year is what I can't quit. Now I'm on 400mg lyrica a day, which is close to equivalent, and I can't handle withdrawals. I'm trying to lower very slowly, though. You should definitely be fine if you stay under 1G."

researchchemicals,fcgd6mo,t3_eh78ub,1577638822.0,"The problem with Tofisopam is that it doesn't act as an anticonvulsant. So it can help most parts of both benzo and alcohol withdrawal, but it fails to really help the seizure potential of those withdrawals.

ChronicPain,fc4gcch,t3_eg32kj,1577415849.0,"I agree with the second comment; acupuncture has no scientific evidence for being effective. It's not something that should be suggested since there is no evidence that it helps pain or anything else. Opioids may have little evidence on their effectiveness in chronic pain, but there are mountains of evidence that it directly helps relieve physical pain. And I also agree that suggesting acupuncture for nerve pain is especially stupid. You definitely shouldn't continue seeing that doctor."
