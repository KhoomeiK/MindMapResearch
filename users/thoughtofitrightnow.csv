furry_irl,ffda0m1,t1_ffbv6ls,1579816367.0,Ash hugs and rides his ponyta pretty early on in the series. I think the Pokémon can make it not hurt if they want to.
me_irlgbt,ffd9v5h,t1_ffcl40z,1579816277.0,Saaame. Purses are so fucking helpful omg. I got a smol one a year ago and it’s been filling up lol. Might get a new one soon ^=^
me_irlgbt,ffd5s2s,t1_ffckul1,1579813967.0,"I think it’s okay for a person to gender themselves or their possessions. My coworker at work goes by they but tends to call our work equipment she’s. 

If you want it to be a man-bun, hell yea. But others shouldn’t gender your hair for you. 

Slight tangent but I call my bag a purse, had someone say it’s called a satchel when a man wears it. I was like well i feel like a girl so I’m gonna call it a purse. 

Let the individual have their gender, don’t push it on others."
furry_irl,ffa7bab,t1_ffa227r,1579729281.0,I really like using queer as well. Gets enough across without people needing more info
furry_irl,ffa2129,t1_ff9vxsb,1579726302.0,I’m pan and I agree. My bf identifies as gay and I feel he is valid as well. It’s interesting how he simply does not find women attractive. I’ve asked him about trans too and he said maybe but he’s not sure. While I’m over here like eating the entire buffet.
furry_irl,ffa1nij,t1_ff9vpt6,1579726084.0,"Romantic partner I’d say yeah sit down and try to explain your sexual orientation. I’m pan which is a whole nother can of words to try to explain. I’ve told my bf, he gets it. I’ve told a few friends when it’s come up. But to the general world I just call myself gay. 

It’s a lot easier and I don’t have to explain much. No one needs to know anyways so I’m comfortable w the gay label even though I identify as pan sexual. 

Tangent but wow there was this one gay bar I went to that had a wet underwear contest I entered. The host goes around asking the other contestants what they were. One was gay, everyone cheered and he got to talk a bit. One was straight and they all made jokes about it. They come up to me and I say I’m Pansexual. The host looks at me weird and audience is kinda silent. The host does not ask me any follow up questions and moves on. 

Thinking back that’s probably the main reason I just call myself gay in public. I don’t get why bi and pan get so much side eye from the gay community."
askgaybros,feq2pn4,t1_fepe1i0,1579336716.0,"Dan Savage’s podcast man. It really helped put my perspective into words. I’ve always felt like if you get even 70% of everything from a person that should be more than enough. That’s why you have friends, family, if you’re lucky co-workers. So you can get that extra bit from others. And sexually if you want more or different you should be allowed to get that to. As long as everyone is consenting and communicating. 

Also no one will ever be enough until you’re enough for yourself alone. K I’m hopping off my soapbox now."
askgaybros,fep926t,t1_fep0v2m,1579314869.0,"Maybe open relationship or poly? Sometimes just having the comfort of knowing you can explore is enough. And you can explore w your partner if you like sharing. Or share stories. 

I think long term open relationships can work. I’ve done monogamy, it does feel like I’m missing out. But I’d still only really wanna hook up w someone I have an emotional connection to. But I can have many emotional connections ;)"
askgaybros,fep8qay,t1_feocy9a,1579314655.0,"Hell yeah im glad to hear your experience! I’m in a new relationship, we’re open but it’s my first time being open. It’s fun but we’ve also taken it slow. Like I’ve kissed and held hands w other guys. I’m not in a rush, but it’s nice to know if something pops up I can take it."
askgaybros,fep8gzw,t1_feo7roq,1579314492.0,My current boyfriend loves my transparency. At the end of our first date I asked if I could kiss him. Apparently I was the first person to ask for something rather than just going for it.

furry_irl,feiqy9r,t1_fehvepg,1579144985.0,"I’ve been trying to figure that out myself. 

I think horny instead of slutty. Big but timid. Affectionate. Simple and blunt at times."
askgaybros,feikb75,t3_ep3e43,1579140514.0,"That’s awesome and super cute! I’m glad to hear from someone who is the cuddled vs the cuddler. It’s great that you enjoy it even if you don’t always initiate it. And kudos to you for being aware enough of your relationship dynamic that you started initiating affection! Know that your boyfriend probably gets super excited at the smallest thing you do. 

I’m in a similar boat as you actually. But I’m the cuddler and we are also both 30. We met like 6 months ago and started dating a few months after. It took a bit to learn each other but we both know that I’m the type to start cuddling and cuddle a lot and that he loves to receive it but also needs a little space. We’ve found a great balance of space lately though so much to the point that he’s been starting things with me. It’s great cause I’ve gotten crazy amounts of affection and we both feel valid and loved and safe. The end lol."
askgaybros,feijr5f,t1_fei41mz,1579140139.0,You’d be amazed what a new relationship can do for you. My dad is 50 and became a little schoolgirl when he met his husband a few years ago.
askgaybros,feijef6,t1_fehvotr,1579139902.0,"Same I’m affectionate all the time. In a fairly new relationship and I don’t want to smother him and I know he likes his alone time. But this post makes me feel like that’s how my bf feels. These past few weeks I’ve been giving him a little space and taking care of myself too. And holy shit he’s super into affection and sex is crazy and frequent. Like he’s actually started texting me out of the blue. For months I had always text him first. 

It’s awesome we’ve just really let our guards down. Laid our traumas on the table. Agreed we are committed to ourselves and each other. And now just taking the ride nice and slow knowing we have each other’s backs."
askgaybros,feij061,t1_fei5stx,1579139640.0,And then a few more years and you’re cuddling on the new couch he luckily hasn’t chewed up yet. And he wags his tail when you look at him.
askgaybros,feiiv50,t1_feh1iiy,1579139549.0,"It’s not for everyone. My bf and I are the 30 yo version of this couple in the post above. I initiate cuddle, he likes to receive it. I’ll watch him work from time to time. I’m very affectionate and he loves being the object of it. 

But also sometimes you’re in the middle of work or just not feeling it and that’s okay too. The more space I give him, the more I find him coming back to me. So I get rewarded for letting him do his thing and I get a plethora of cuddles and cute time. 

I’m so glad to hear a post about how much the person receiving the affection likes it. I honestly know we can be too much sometimes."
furry_irl,feiff0o,t1_feibouz,1579137258.0,Thanks for sharing your perspective!  Makes me happy you found comradery like that in the military.
furry_irl,fehzpb3,t1_fegxvf7,1579127150.0,"Yeah I’m a loving wholesome furry that likes being cute and lifting others in my community up. But it’s also a important part of my sexual identity. Sometimes I feel like we get blasted for wanting to get blasted, but it’s no biggie just gotta keep spreading that love."
furry_irl,fehtc0m,t1_fegy3j0,1579123462.0,"I’m very open about being a furry where I work. It’s an art teaching studio with about 150 students. So far everyone has been playful, curious, or know someone else who is also a furry. Even had someone ask me how they could help their younger brother who is a furry and having hard times about it. 

I post one picture to imgur and get told to die. 

The internet is not the general consensus. Of course my own experience is not the general consensus either."
CasualConversation,feftb09,t1_fefncan,1579064552.0,"Aww that’s so sweet. I’m a guy who feels very more on the feminine side, I’ve always gotten along more with female or more gender neutral people. I came out as gay half a year ago and have been acting more myself in public kinda flamboyant. It’s crazy how much more I easily connect with women around me. I love giving compliments and the reaction is always fun. 

It is kinda interesting that being more outwardly gay has had this effect. I’m still finding my balance but I do love to go out and put on a show."
2meirl4meirl,fefhic6,t1_feff7zu,1579056435.0,"I get where you’re coming from, I think. My boyfriend is similar to you, hes a busy dude and life can’t all be about me, nor would I want it to be. 

But I do have the tendency to want validation and want it frequently. The first few months we dated I had anxiety about how little he would text when we were away and how little he said validating things. We talked a little about it, but I took it as a good thing in disguise, like I wanted to be more independent and he would be a good person to be with and also have my own space. 

I also realized a lot of his validation comes non verbally. He knows the way I like my spliffs rolled, remembers little details from my stories, stopped flushing if it’s just pee cause he noticed I dont flush (yellow mellow baby). 

The more I learnt to see his affection style, the more I felt comfort and confident in our love for each other. I started going a few days without texting him, giving him space after we had hung out. And he started texting me. And we do a quick check in, share a meme or two, and go back to life. By giving him his space, and learning to like my time alone, our bond actually got crazy stronger. We recharge and then meet back up and have amazing conversations, sometimes just being entirely goofy with each other. He’s passionate towards me in such a great way. He validates me all the time without even realizing it. 

Tl dr 

If you give people you love space when they ask for it, they’ll love you much much more."

Second one I went after I had known some people on telegram for a while, had gone to a few local meetups, and had my bf there. Honestly so much better, it’s a really social event and having known people beforehand, even just through text, really helped. 

Take some time and energy and put it into a local furry chat, try to find a few people that are chill and then when you go to your next con you have a social safety net. 

But that’s also just my perspective I don’t want to assume yours, do whatever you need to do and know you are valid. ^=^"

I loved it, maybe she wanted more affection, or it felt like another divide coming between us. Honestly after 10 years we kinda stopped cuddling and would sleep at different times. Kinda just fuck and go back to our own thing. Maybe that’s too cynical, who knows. 

Funnily enough been dating this guy for about 6 months and I’m super affectionate and cuddly with him. Wouldn’t want to have separate blankets with him just yet. I’m sure with time the big cuddly phase will pass. And if it becomes long term hopefully I remember the flaws from my past and actively work on improving them."

Great thing about being furry, or sexuality in general, is you can make it as specific as you want. So go ahead and make it niche, find what you do and don’t like, and let it change constantly.
