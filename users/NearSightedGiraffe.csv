changemyview,fef55ym,t1_feey94d,1579048427.0,"'Easily' is an exaggeration. It is harder to read such poorly spelt words- making it more difficult to get the meaning. The more work the reader has to do, the worse the communication is. Further, letter order is a small part of spelling and spelling is a small part of understanding. 

If I use the word aapul in a sentence and you cannot understand that I mean the small red fruit then why wouldn't you work to correct it? 

On a completely different note, standardised spelling also makes it easier to look up words you don't know. Say you were either a younger person or a non native speaker and I used the word 'swashbuckling'. If I spelt it shwachbuklin and you didn't know the actual word you would be unable to look it up. Again, this results in a failure of communication. 

Finally, in formal contexts (rather than informal, like this) it is important not just that the people directly involved understand what is going on, but that any potential audience can agree as to what was meant. For example, when writing a contract or communicating a new discovery. The more ambiguity there is, the more problems it can cause down the track.

On the down side, the fitter you are the more efficient your body gets. So working out to build muscle will  raise how many calories you burn just sitting around. On the flip side, working out on cardio equipment will actually make you gradually burn less when running the same distance at the same speed as you build the right muscles in the right places."

Snow can be light and fluffy, like it looks in the movies, and that is the best stage. It is cold, malleable but holds together well enough makong it great as a kid. As it gets a little older you hit the mushy stage, where instead you are stuck with sludge trending towards mud."
AmItheAsshole,fdmaflu,t1_fdkpmyw,1578543880.0,"Okay, what if I have friends and relatives who live overseas? AITA for holding it in my home town, inviting them but know that they will not be able to justify the expense in coming? 

I think that there should be some accomodation for invited guests- for example dietary requirements should always be accommodated, in almost any circumstance plus ones should be invited (the only plus ones we aren't inviting are either really really recent additions and 1 plus one with a criminal conviction who has made my partner feel uncomfortable in the past)   guests should have something to do if the bride and groom are taking an hour of photos between the ceremony and the reception, don't demand gifts etc from your guests- a registry is fine and while it is generally expected don't bitch if someone doesn't get you something. Also, if parents (or similar) are paying for a significant portion of the wedding I think their wishes should at least be considered And, within reason, accommodated. While on clearly subjective thing, like style, the couple getting married should have the final say, on other elements the people paying should at least be respected for their contribution.

But in general? If the couple asks people to dress up to a certain theme, such as star wars, then sure- it is their day. If they want to be a very small wedding so that only a few close friends and family are invited, sure it is their day. If they want to have an elaborate wedding spending every last cent in their bank account- it is their money and their day. If they want a backyard wedding ceremony between overs of the cricket- then sure, it is their day. 

I think where you get issues on both sides is blanket rules that rush to either extreme. That being said, weddings are allowed to be a bit more self centred than the normal celebration."
AmItheAsshole,fdm93mg,t1_fdm86mr,1578542871.0,"Yeah- overall our org has a long way to go, but at least the conversations are happening. Our senior leadership is a little better than yours- the equivilent of the CEO is a woman, as well as 2/6 Chief level positions. Not equality, but definitely a lot closer than the wider staff base. It gets worse in the next level of positions- as those tens to very rarely be external recruits and are instead stuffed with, predominantly male, employees with a long run in the company. You can't replace 20yrs of experience overnight, and similarly can't undo 20 years of discriminatory hiring in an instant. Hopefully with better recruitment practices, in another 20 years, if not sooner it will be less of an issue though.

As with others in this thread, the big answer will be to love in a country with higher number of days PTO. 

Other options though are to save, and talk to your boss about leave without pay. I have zero knowledge of the US, but I have done that before to get an extra week or so out of a trip. You need to have cash saved up in either case, and ideally someone to look after the house, depending on your loving situation. 

Other than that, you do it by simply going and giving it a go! Best of luck!"
