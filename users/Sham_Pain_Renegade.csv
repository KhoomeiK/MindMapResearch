mastcelldisease,ffamuax,t3_eskpz5,1579739654.0,"I can try to help you with this one. I’m both a tattoo artist and someone who has about 75% of my body tattooed. I just to briefly try to explain my input with this. My doctor is not 100% sure what is going on with me but one of the theories is MCAS. And we think that one of the things making me the sickest is the tattoo ink, because there’s so much of it in/on me. And one of the things that happens to me is all over my body, sometimes in several areas at the same time, all the black ink swells up and gets massively itchy. 

Sometimes people have a similar reaction when they’re outside in the sun but it just happens randomly all over my body, in places that don’t ever see the sun. 

The only things I can recommend is to first find an artist that you’re comfortable working with and express your medical concerns. Some store bought hair dye indicate that if you sensitive skin, to do a patch test with the dye in the crease of your elbow. You can do this with tattoo ink, too. You would request that a small dot of the ink is placed in the crease of your elbow (not tattooed on, just placed on the surface skin.) Try to leave it undisturbed for 24 hours. If you have a reaction to it, you’ll see redness, itchiness, possible hives. Anything out of the ordinary. 

But this can’t always indicate if you would have a reaction when it’s in your skin. You could try to get something really tiny first to see how you do with it. I’m sorry this isn’t completely straight forward as I don’t think there’s much information on what to do for a MCAS reaction to tattoo ink, I haven’t found much."

ChoosingBeggars,ff751u9,t3_erv7r5,1579641269.0,"I see a lot of people bitching about her prices. But there’s a whole lot of things that they’re forgetting that goes into getting a tattoo. All of our supplies are paid out of pocket and that includes: 

Tubes, needles, ink, ink caps, rubber gloves, tattoo machines, power supply, clip cord, foot pedal, clip cord covers, plastic wrap, ointment, spray bottles, madacide, disposable razors, biofilm, tape, lights, arm rest, and a whole lot more minutiae. Which includes things like paying for utilities, insurance, Board Of health certifications. Updating social media, a good computer, printer, thermafax machine,stencil paper. 

And the most important thing, is your paying for the artists years of experience and skill. Ad the majority of places, we don’t get an hourly wage. We make a percentage of what we do. If I come in to the shop for my usual ten hours and no one comes in, I make no money. There’s a reason why we charge what we do. But yeah, go ahead and pay thousands for a purse because it’s “designer” but haggle over something that’s permanently on your body."

You have stress coming at you from every which way and that’s a whole lot to try to take on by yourself.

I was given a fancy diary by a family member when I was 12 and I wrote in there a lot about how much I hated him and bitching about all of his power hungry, controlling ridiculous rules. I also wasn’t allowed to receive or write any notes because they might have something written in there about what was going on in the house. 

Both the diary and any notes were read out loud by him at the dinner table with every single member of my family there. They were read as condescendingly and sarcastically as possible in order to promote as much humiliation as possible. Also, for every part that was about him it would incite a separate argument about how wrong I am and how fucked up I am.

Sorry if this isn’t too helpful, just wanted to share the little bit of information I had about them.

Also, maybe try taking a flashlight and shining it on the floor from different angles to see if it reflects off of it. I’ve found random shiny stones that fell out of jewelry or clothing or once a fake gemstone that got stuck in the bottom of my shoe."
