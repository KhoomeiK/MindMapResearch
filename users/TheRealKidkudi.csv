Every window in his apartment had been smashed from the inside, and there was writing on the walls and ceiling saying things like ""nobody will help you"", ""they're onto you"", and ""I'm listening"". The weirdest one was ""get on the meat, my friends! Get on the meat!"" I heard him shouting at the police ""what, you think I wrote that on my own walls and broke my own windows?"" He had other episodes and the police were familiar with him from similar situations. He was sure things would go ""missing"" from his home, that someone was changing the locks on his door and that's why he kept being locked out, and there were listening devices everywhere. He believed the building owners and the police were working against him and his cell phone was bugged so he couldn't ever find out who kept breaking into his house.

Hopefully the reverse will make it clear, but I don't think this was reversed. I have two cats and one of them does this kind of thing all the time.

I've found it's important to set those boundaries early and maintain them, because once you reply to 2 or 3 messages at 7pm or you say ""no problem, I'll take care of that at home"" it very quickly becomes the expectation.

On their Midsummer Night if you find yourself at a crossroads leading to 4 different churches, elves will show up and try to seduce you with food and gifts and if you give in they steal you away never to be heard from again.

They have the Yule Cat who comes out on Christmas and if you didn't finish making yourself a new sweater by Christmas time, he'll sneak in overnight and eat you.

Yes, correct, so don't say that. Say you left because it wasn't a good fit for your career goals or that you think you outgrew the position or any other reason that sounds even vaguely positive.

> Saying you left because a contract ended or there wasnt room for growth is a lie sure, but they aren't going to check and it wouldn't matter.

No, not correct, because most of they time they *will* check. Unless it's super entry level or part time, they *do* check these things. I have personally passed on candidates because they lied about their last job and I found out with one phone call. I've fired people because it came out later that they lied in their interviews. I've cut off interviews because they were obviously bullshitting. For almost any job that pays a salary, the only way they don't check is if someone didn't do their job especially if it's about your most recent employer.

It goes like this:

""Hi, this is Steve calling from New Job, I was just calling about John Doe. He said he left your place in 2019 when his contract ended. What can you tell me about him?""

""John? Yeah, he quit without notice because he didn't get along with his supervisor. I couldn't tell you much about him, he was only here about a month""

""Great, thanks, that's all I need to know. Have a great one!""

And now you're not hired.

Don't lie, especially about something that is so easy to check. Just give an answer about how your personal goals align better with this new job and use it as an opportunity to sell yourself over the other 10 applicants.

DestinyTheGame,fd5n8ib,t1_fd5mhyv,1578179312.0,"Sure, I'm a primarily PvE player, and I think that was also a poor decision. I don't mind that crucible has exclusive top-tier weapons, but there should also be a comparable counter part in PvE. After all, like Bungie said themselves, we ought to be able to play how we want to play."
DestinyTheGame,fd5kd3x,t1_fd59a5q,1578178473.0,"IMO crucible is the real end game. Not to bash PvE, I personally prefer it, but the only time I really care about my gear is in the crucible. Aside from trying to speed run raids, your gear in PvE is largely irrelevant other than how you enjoy killing adds - I can clear any mission, nightfall, nightmare hunt, whatever with pretty much any guns as long as my light level is appropriate and I don't even have to look at the stats for my armor.

In PvP though, you want to make sure that you have the right weapons for the right maps or to counter the other team's loadout, the stats on your gear can make a big difference, and I'm more thoughtful of my equipment and class abilities as a whole. For a game mode that requires you to thoughtfully prepare your character, why is it the least rewarding in materials that help you do that?

It feels like for someone who wants to focus on PvP you're required to play some PvE to get to where you want to be. Maybe that's by design, but I'd like to think Bungie isn't trying to trick people into playing content they don't want just to enjoy the content they want to play."

When I'm cooking she'll just patiently sit on the counter and I'll let her get a little sniff of each ingredient I'm using. The only time she gives me a hassle is when I forget to let her get a sniff and she bats my hand like ""uh, excuse me, aren't you forgetting something?"""
Chromecast,fd5gns8,t1_fd43iam,1578177420.0,"I'll say I am really enjoying Stadia but you're right - it's totally not worth it to use a mouse and keyboard. I've been having a blast playing games on my phone and laptop and the TV using my controller, but I sat down to play Destiny 2 on my PC and thought I'd try it on Stadia and it was miserable. I played about 5 minutes before I closed it and just played locally on my computer. 

But I will say, with a controller I haven't had any problems with Stadia regarding input lag or poor resolution. The only time I had a resolution problem was when I was on my phone and I had a bad wifi signal to begin with"
funny,fd5d784,t1_fd25ma8,1578176455.0,"I agree that people should be free to choose to have an abortion, but this argument makes no sense.

In your world, who decides who will be a good parent and who is forced to have an abortion instead? I don't know that I trust anyone to make that call.

Beyond that, wouldn't it make more sense to educate people on how to be a better parent than to just ban a portion of the population from having children at all?

And even beyond *that*, there are plenty of children who grow up to be great people from bad parents. And the opposite is true - some people grow up to become awful adults but were raised by great parents.

People should be able to choose abortion, but nobody should ever be forced to get one."

tifu,fcvyf35,t1_fcvc88m,1578012944.0,"I've always heard it as ""don't dip your pen in company ink."" It totally can work out for some people, but it's playing with fire. When relationships end they can become pretty messy. I prefer to keep any personal messes far away from any career messes, and I definitely don't need them mixed up in one big mess.

That's not even to mention the mess you can get into if one of you becomes the other's boss directly or indirectly. That's not a dynamic I'd want to navigate in my relationship.

I don't mean to say you can't be friends with your coworkers because you absolutely should, but you should also be careful about what you say and do in front of coworkers until you know they're your friend first and coworker second."
EliteDangerous,fcvxdm0,t1_fcvvojt,1578012259.0,"My right hand is a joystick with a few utility buttons and my left hand is a throttle with a few buttons by the thumb and on the front where my fingers rest. There's a stick by my pointer finger on the throttle which controls my thrusters horizontally and vertically so normally it's just for landing, but if I click it in (like R3/L3 on a controller) then it's controlling where I'm looking. When I click it again, it snaps back to the default view and switches back to controlling lateral thrusters.

It's easy enough if I'm trying to look at something as I fly by, but for something like core mining where I send out a pulse scan it's easier in VR because I can look around and glance back forward so I don't crash into an asteroid than it is to wiggle around that stick and look back forward. It's definitely not impossible, but that sort of thing is a little easier in VR for me.

Tbh most of the time if I'm looking around it's as I fly into a station and I'm looking for my landing pad, in which case the stick is perfectly acceptable."
MadeMeSmile,fcvtiho,t1_fcv88vo,1578009755.0,"I think there's two reasons for that, both of which are a result of so much more information being so widely available.

First, we learned a lot more about how dangerous things are - the best example is asbestos. Back when we first started using it, we thought it was the most amazing material in the world. It was believed to be relatively harmless but useful in all sorts of applications so they slapped that shit in *everything*. Fast forward to today and we realize it's a serious health hazard and we're still spending tons of money safely removing it from all over the place.

TL;DR we learned a lot about materials and how dangerous they actually are over time

Second, because of the internet it's a lot easier to read about every single incident that happens. Statistically, airplanes are a pretty safe form of transport. However, when something goes wrong and one crashes we hear a lot about it and it can give the impression that it's happening all the time when in reality the frequency of plane crashes has actually gone down over time."
EliteDangerous,fcvpt91,t1_fcvdjet,1578007372.0,"That's the biggest reason I stopped playing Elite in VR. Plus it's a lot easier for me to actually look at my HOTAS to make sure I'm pressing the right button. 

I really love playing in VR because it's a gorgeous world and it's really nice to look around the cockpit while you're flying, but things are a lot blurrier in VR because some of the detail is just too fine to resolve clearly when your eyes are so close to the pixels.

More or less, VR is a mood in Elite - I'll play with my headset on when I'm really feeling it, but most of the time it's easier and looks nicer on my monitor."
GooglePixel,fcuzx11,t1_fcuzmlz,1577991830.0,"Obviously people do want this. I've never had an issue with it being too loud, but I am annoyed that there's no sound at all when a call ends - even a single vibration when a call ends would help.

Recently, for example, I was talking to someone and the call got dropped. I was in the middle of telling a story and I told about half of it before I realized the call was dropped right at the beginning because the other person called back and my phone started buzzing on my face."
