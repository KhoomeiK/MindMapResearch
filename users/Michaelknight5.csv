depression,fde117k,t3_ekrd1u,1578328756.0,Just make sure that when you leave this fucking existence to do so in a manner that won't leave you alive. Imagine being in a coma or alive just enough to regret it....
depression,fddrcs4,t3_ekljfz,1578321961.0,Everytime I called the suicide hotline to vent they Baker acted me. It only made me mistrust them. I wouldn't mention killing myself and they would still lock me up. I would get out the next day and regret asking for help. I don't care if I wake up or not tomorrow. Living longer hasn't made me appreciate life. I wish I would've ended it.

depression,fcnpnvt,t3_ei5diy,1577816073.0,We need to realize that not everyone is meant to enjoy this life obviously. Some of us are better off not experiencing this shit.
depression,fc4g1n4,t3_eflmb0,1577415602.0,I regret not doing it earlier. Living longer isn't always the best option.
depression,fc35qw4,t3_efv1hu,1577382109.0,I know how you feel when it comes to wanting your life to end. I definitely won't say not to do it. How bad could death be if that's what happens to everyone anyway? Just make sure to end it with something that you're pretty sure won't leave you alive in any capacity. Good luck buddy.
