However, we are in the 21st century because centuries are counted from 0. (There was a century zero, basically year 99 and before. If you think there was no century 0, then you can't say we're in the 21's century). Just because the advent of the calendar was on year 1 doesn't mean that decades or centuries or years are measured from 1.

math,fdof81n,t3_emdddo,1578603974.0,"What about infinite composition of logarithms? E.g. ln(ln(ln(...ln(x)...)))

Maybe ln() is the wrong function, but what if you had a function y=f(x) that mapped each complex number x to its phase between -pi/2 and +pi/2 as the complex component of y, and x's radius (Potentially negative since the phase is a range of only pi) to the real component of y.This would map each complex number uniquely to another complex number in a strip running along the real axis.

Applying the function again would map each of those complex numbers on the strip to another unique complex number. The interesting thing is for a number x with radius of magnitude larger than pi/2, applying f(x) gives y which has a phase restricted even further than +-pi/2.

Even if a number x has a radius magnitude of less than pi/2, if it's not on the real number line, then f(x) has an even larger magnitude since both the previous magnitude, and the non-zero phase become components of the current magnitude. Eventually, every number with enough applications of f(x) has its radius increased beyond a magnitude of pi/2 and the phase y starts to become restricted closer and closer to the real axis. Keep in mind that ln(x) of a real number will change the radius, but f(x) doesn't.

&#x200B;

I think  infinitely repeated applications of the function y=f(x) would at its limit map every complex number uniquely to a real number.

I suppose this breaks for 0+0i, but that's the best I've got.

edit: No it doesn't (Necessarily) if you define f(x) to map 0 to 0 with a phase of 0"
