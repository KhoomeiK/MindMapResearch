worldnews,ff8fvfj,t1_ff82tzd,1579676668.0,"Correct, and when I worked for a supplier to Coke and their contractors, they were using 90 percent virgin and 10 percent recycled resin for their new production bottles and molds.


There are few companies who are able to recycle PET to food grade standards, and Coke's sheer massive quantities  and when you try to use a larger percentage of recycled resin you run into problems with intrinsic viscosity, clarity, etc. This causes bottles to be thicker and ends up using even more resin than virgin does. 

Also, when colors are mixed in recycling streams (especially green), there's nothing you can do to get it back to the original color. Also, contaminants like PVC and acetaldehyde once they enter the stream are nearly impossible to remove. That resin now becomes garbage, or best case scenario made into polyester fibers. 


So long as crude oil prices allow it, virgin material is the better bargain and recycled resin is used mainly for optics or to meet a customer's demands.

Example being Niagara waters I believe it was, wanted a 100 percent recycled bottle, and that comes with a lot of financial challenges, especially to first start up."

Now they're part of a club, like the he man woman haters. The smaller the club the better, because only THEY know the TRUTH.

I used to be quite active in places like r/conspiracy, and the more dissident and radical people started flocking there due to the push by American political figures of long discredited, wild conspiracy theories that nobody was looking at in a nuanced objective view, because these guys were so reinforced in their views that they now form a large part of their identity on their contrarian, too cool for school, so and so is the messiah and everyone else is evil type of bullshit they are voting to the top and into actual political positions.

I'm all for freedom of speech and consider myself pretty libertarian, but man, to give these guys safe spaces to espouse shit about how a religion is a disease, the crusades should have finished the job or that shit, an opposing view on political issues is actually a serious mental illness... I mean come on, the trolls start this shit and then people start to actually believe it and repeat it, and the safe space just reinforces it.

So, no, I don't really think that those downvoted into oblivion are tending to see the error of their ways BECAUSE of it being unpopular in general discussion. I wish that were the case..

This is the big thing that it seems most of those in the West don't understand.

All these wars we're fighting in the mideast just for an example...

The coalition is focused on the here and now and what to do to turn the tide and stop the constant bleed of money, soldiers, equipment,... Power... Influence...


They're fighting people that don't care if they die and most in fact are itching to be a martyr.

When life is that fucking rough, you would gladly die so that there's any possibility that your children won't have to... But if need be, they will fight. And they will die. And the cycle continues until one side gets tired.

I'll give you a hint as to which side will tap out first. It's a war of culture, ideology, hard coded love and hatred, generation after generation.



How this relates to the second amendment is this.


If I'm scraping by to feed myself and my family, I'll gladly get hit with a reaper if it means my children won't have to live under the same tyrannical conditions.

We're not quite there. Far from it
