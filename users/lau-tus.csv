explainlikeimfive,fe5voe8,t1_fe5uwl9,1578875981.0,Just wanna add: some crimes are considered so serious as impossible to make reservations. Committing said crimes makes the ICC and ICJ directly competent - as well as other countries' courts - even if the State didn't ratificate the treaties giving them competence and even if the State didn't recognize the competency of the courts. Those crimes are the crimes against humanity. If you want to know more about this you can look up jus cogens law
explainlikeimfive,fe5uwl9,t1_fe5nvdl,1578875498.0,"To give you a precise answer the law that applies to the responsibility of States for war crimes is called humanitarian law, because it originated with 4 conventions impulsed by the red cross. 

the International Court of Justice judges crimes that involve the responsibility of the State. It includes direct orders, active support to the ones who committed the crimes,  even if those don't come from said State (like when the US supported the contras who overthrew the democratic gvt through the CIA), indirect support etc. 

The law that applies to the the responsibility of individuals during war crimes (and other situations) is called international criminal law.
The International Criminal Court judges the individuals who committed war crimes (even in the cases stated above). 
War crimes also include the use of rape as a war tool, torture, crimes against humanity (genocide, ethnic cleansing), etc. 
The ICC can also oversee the crimes that were committed in another country by individuals, including former officials, even outside of war times (former officials cause officials like ministers or diplomats benefit from immunity during their mandate). For example it's the couet competent to decide whether a country must extradite  an individual.

The competency of those courts is submitted to the signature and ratification of their Statute convention, and the conventions they oversee. If the State didn't ratificate the ICC and/or ICJ statue, then it is not competent to oversee those crimes. 
And to be completely precise, states can ratificate the statute convention of the courts with reserves which means that the convention won't apply to some situations. Ex: the US made a reservation on the use of torture in the war against terrorism.

But yeah, ultimately international law doesn't apply to all countries equally because most countries want to keep good business and diplomatic relations with bigger countries, especially when their sovereignty isn't directly at risk. International Criminal law is more applied and respected than international humanitarian law.

TL; DR : the International Court of Justice is competent to judge states who ordered/supported war crimes. The International Criminal Court is competent to judge individuals who committed crimes (war crimes and other crimes committed in another country). Ultimately it often depends on the power of country responsible for the crimes. Studying public international law for 4 years was quite depressing when comparing the law with the reality."

MurderedByWords,fe5c319,t3_enoz9r,1578867543.0,"I read in the sub r/insaneparents something that really resonated with me : ""we are the heroes of our own stories"" also means that we never identify with the bad guys. We always tend to empathize with the hero/victim even when the bad guy displays the exact same behaviour we have.
 The example was: a girl went to see Rapunzel with her very possessive, controlling and toxic mother. She displayed the exact same toxic traits as the evil mother that locks Rapunzel in the tower (minus black magic). So the daughter was afraid to ask what her mother thought of the movie cause it portrayed her behaviour in a very bad way. But at the  end of the movie the mother said she loved the movie and that she identified as the real mother at the end of the movie altho it was blatantly obvious she was like the evil mother.
So what I'm saying here is that it doesn't surprise me that cheating people or incels never seem to see how toxic and damaging their thoughts/behaviours are. 

TL;DR : people don't question their behaviour because they always think of themselves as the good guy even when showed how wrong their behaviour is. They can even call out people who behave like them without seeing they do the same"

The first time we had an appointment she seemed quite doubtful even tho I'd already been diagnosed, questioning the symptoms I described. She literally only see ADHD as only being unable to focus, she doesn't know the next thing about being forgetful, hyperfixation, links with depression, RSD, etc. When I told her I didn't really feel a strong difference between days on and off my treatment, she dismissed it like it confirmed her doubts instead of trying to see whether raising the dosage would help...

What works for me:
1. To remember things I have to do I use a to-do list app. To each their favourite one, I personally use Habitica which also helps with tracking habits, you can put deadlines for tasks as well. I check my to do list every week and then try to tackle at least one task per day (starting with the most important ones. 
2. I put every appointment or commitment (like hanging out with a friend or a call) on my Google calendar with lots of reminders.
3. There is a system which is coupling a boring task with a funnier activity: maybe dance while tidying and cleaning, listen to your favourite podcast while working out, go to tbe coffee shop near your doctor's office everytime you go, etc. Maybe just the satisfaction of getting it done. Maybe find an accountability partner ?
4. I know it sounds cliche but practising mindfulness has helped me lots. It doesn't have to be meditation, there's lots of ways to practice it on a daily basis.
5. Try out different strategies and tools and choose the ones that work best for you. And be kind to yourself, always. 

TL;DR : join the ADHD community, use todolist apps, put reminders for everything, couple boring activities with nicer ones, practice mindfulness, adapt tools, be kind to yourself

People usually like it when you show interest in what they like, maybe even more so if you're not a huge fan yourself because it shows you care enough. This can apply to many topics actually"
socialskills,fdzr0w4,t1_fdylfui,1578793819.0,"1. It can seem obvious to some but while making small talk, show interest in the other person: 
ask them what they do for a living, their hobbies, etc. Let the conversation flow from there: you can ask them whether they like their job, what they do exactly, since when they've taken this or that hobby, etc. 
Don't hesitate to share back as well. It's okay to cut people off, it happens to everyone. If you notice you've just done it, just say ""I'm sorry, go on...""

2. Another tip that I often use: when I already kind of know the answer to the questions, I still ask them. If I've already talked to the person once or twice and I'm not sure whether I've already asked them about a certain topic, I am very genuine about it ""I don't remember whether you've told me this before..."". 
Be more specific about the questions you ask when catching up with someone: instead of ""how are you doing?"" ask them what they've been up to (job, hobbies, etc.), whether they have plans for the near future (any plans for the weekend? Any travel planned? etc.)

3. It's okay to forget someone's name even after talking to them several times. It happens to me a lot because I have some memory trouble. I usually just apologize and ask their name again: ""I'm so sorry but can you remind me your name ?"" 

4. All conversations don't necessarily need to be funny but they can still be interesting. And don't worry about not being funny yourself, when people you talk to are more comfortable during conversations, they will probably find a way to be funny themselves (not to brag but people usually like my sense of humour so I tend to make the other person laugh, especially if I see them struggling during the conversation. If you attempt a joke and it fails laugh it off with ""It sounded funnier in my head"". 

5. I'll share my secret weapon for being effortlessly funny: I have recurring catchphrases that I know will work everytime when said at the right moment:
- when a deep question comes up, I add ""you have four hours"" as in you have four hours to write an essay about it.
- when a very specific topic comes up, with the good timing, replying ""and we never talk about that enough"" can work wonders.
Those are the only 2 I remember but I know I have more. Feel free to use these or create your own signature catchphrases, you can find inspiration in stand up comedy, copy other people, etc.

6. Some people are bad at conversations or just straight up dicks: they don't ask questions back (usually self-centered people), reply with very short answers, don't make any effort and don't show any interest in you. You feel like you have to make incredible efforts to maintain the conversation alive. 
Make up an excuse and walk away ""I'm actually late to x or y"", look at your phone and say ""I didn't notice the time, I have to go home"". If you're in the middle of a gathering and would like to stay but talk to other people ""sorry but I really need to go to the bathroom"" ""I'm gonna grab something to eat"". There's a big chance the other person started another conversation, try to join another conversation yourself ""what are you guys talking about?""

7. If you feel yourself turning red, stuttering, etc. be honest (unless in the above scenario when I'd use the excuse to flee the conversation), most people are nice and understanding and will say something as ""no pressure"". 

 8. Be kind to yourself, having social anxiety is a nightmare. And remember that even people who seem very extroverted and comfortable in conversations can  have social anxiety in specific settings. I personally struggle with starting conversation in big gatherings where I don't know anyone but once I start feeling comfortable I am really extroverted. I hate having to talk on stage or in front of a big group of people, sometimes I can even feel my voice shaking and my heart beating very fast. However when it's a topic I'm passionate about and know lots about, the awkwardness usually lasts for 2 minutes. 

Hope it helps 

TL;DR : most people are understanding, however don't waste your time on the ones who are obvious dicks. Find ways to escape conversations with the latter. Be honest when you don't remember something you've asked before. Show interest in the other person's life (work, hobbies, family, etc.) and dig deeper. Being funny can require some work and it's okay if you're not at first. Some people are comfortable in some settings and anxious in other, even the most extroverted ones. Be kind to yourself, you got this"
