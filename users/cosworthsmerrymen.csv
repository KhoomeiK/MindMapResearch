CowChop,ff7ubap,t1_ff7mg8m,1579658543.0,I need to do that. So many good memories of their earlier content.
tippytaps,fdpmvcw,t1_fdpi4sj,1578633158.0,What?
tippytaps,fdpmsg7,t1_fdphwvz,1578633086.0,"Ok, I understand what you are saying now. However, they are talking about scratching their belly. Not an itchy back due to dry skin or whatever else. My sister's mini Aussie is itchy right now to the weather change and she loves it when I get home because I'll scratch her. She will do it herself by wiggling around on her back to scratch it. She loves it. I don't hold her when I scratch her and she activity comes back to me to scratch her.

I understand what you are saying but I think they are different things that are happening."
tippytaps,fdpglsz,t1_fdp413r,1578628091.0,Wouldn't the animal just move out of the way? Most people don't hold their dogs in a stranglehold while they pet/scratch them so they dog would just move away if they weren't into it.
tippytaps,fdpgejh,t1_fdou51s,1578627945.0,Do you have any sources for that at all?
pussypassdenied,fcys29f,t1_fbfrr37,1578085867.0,Lay off the hot sauce then.
aww,fcajm2t,t3_egwbjd,1577570448.0,I was so worried that some would get spilled on the carpet.
television,fbws2nh,t3_eepkfd,1577157935.0,The main issue I have with the first season is I have to inform all my friends on the timeline as I am the only one who has read the books. It's very confusing and I wish they would have given a time and place for each scene so people who had no idea of the story could still get a grasp on it. Having a couple lines of dialogue in a scene that gives you clues as to when it takes place aren't enough. Especially considering that everything else in the novels takes place consecutively (if I remember correctly).
HumansBeingBros,fbsay7t,t3_ee6oxo,1577052695.0,It's so hard to read things without any punctuation.
