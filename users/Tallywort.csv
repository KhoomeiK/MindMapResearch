Big hot globules of scalding water flying through the air = bad time  
Small spray of scalding but quickly freezing water = cool misty snow effect"
feedthebeast,ff77tpt,t1_ff5w6n2,1579642821.0,"Honestly though, it's hard to think of things that you gain gameplay wise from either hyperbolic or elliptic geometry that you don't already have in euclidean geometry. And even more so, that you won't get from stitched together euclidean volumes."
feedthebeast,ff44az3,t1_ff334mf,1579555227.0,"Really though, it's euclidean. (Euclidean manifold if you want to get technical)

Sure it's topology is somewhat different, but everywhere (with potential exception of the portals themselves) it is geometrically flat."

Minecraft,felmntk,t1_felckdj,1579225830.0,They aren't close to circles with integer radii. Not that much significance to their locations. It's more a rounding thing.

StarWars,fe66gqv,t1_fe66cf6,1578882859.0,It's still canon in my mind. Less sure if it was ever really considered canon though.
StarWars,fe62s0a,t1_fe2d96d,1578880489.0,"Eh, fair, still more enjoyable than the new trilogy though. Far more consistent that this weird JJ vs Rian feud we got."

StarWars,fe5zve3,t1_fe5zmm3,1578878639.0,"Ah man... Yeah...
It was almost as if they purposely wrote Holdo to be the most unlikeable character she could possible be.

And I'm not sure what the thinking was with those Finn scenes."

And it was all the worse because of it. Holy shit did that not turn out well."
StarWars,fe5x9y0,t1_fe332xa,1578876999.0,"That's because TFA wasn't what divided the community.

It was the film that made the fans hopeful for the franchise (despite its flaws)

It wasn't until TLJ that fans got up in arms."

Overwatch,fe38tb9,t1_fe02p2p,1578847042.0,"It's not though, and more specifically: adding kills, deaths, dps, healing etc into the matchmaking rating, **reduces** its accuracy. Increases the chance of people trying to game the ranking. (bet you'll love people ignoring objectives in favour of stats) This is exactly why such things are only added to lower tiers, where the increased precision(not accuracy) does help speed up MMR convergence and people are generally not skilled enough to purposely game their MMRs."

It was made on an unused dead end, not on any part of the rail network that we actually used. It worked perfectly though. Not a single accident from using the crossing."

factorio,fds6kg3,t1_fdruuzn,1578695496.0,"Bidirectional rails have a different rule of thumb: Only use rail signals in places where it is fine for a train to stand still after the signal (like stops, bypasses etc), chain signals everywhere else."
factorio,fdrbvyw,t3_emup4g,1578682290.0,"So basic rule of thumb for signals:

Chain signal going into an intersection, rail signal going out only if there is enough space for a full train to fit in the next block. If there isn't enough space, use a chain signal instead.

Beyond that, plop rail signals around as you please, and two chain signals in a row can generally be replaced by a single chain signal."

saltierthancrait,fd4i4v3,t3_ejvp7e,1578167699.0,"Eh, To me TLJ is and remains the worst sequel film.

The other two are at least enjoyable to watch, and sorta kinda get the feel right to me. (as opposed to the constant gotcha moments and insulting (lack of) plot of TLJ)

TROS was actually a whole lot better than I expected. (low expectations, but still...) Sure it is a mess, sure it had to cram too much into one film because TLJ ignored all plotlines, sure it makes some decisions I disagree with. But overall still enjoyable. Clear best film in the sequel trilogy. (least bad?)"
