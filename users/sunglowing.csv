offmychest,fcpk2kj,t3_eiarwd,1577866096.0,"I feel you absolutely. My parents don’t talk to each other at all but live under the same roof. I fought with my mom one day and I told her why hasn’t she divorced if she’s so unhappy. She told me that they’re still married solely because of me. Both my parents are cheaters and I feel so devastated(?) because I’m the reason why they truly can’t be happy and I’m honestly really ashamed to tell my friends about them. I look at my friends’ parents and they look so happy???? They go out to eat dinners, travel overseas as a family but I can’t have any of that anymore."
