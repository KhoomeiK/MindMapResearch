offmychest,fdkp1x0,t3_elpxn8,1578508180.0,"Everyday my respect for journalists falls... But we must realize that the reason such journalism thrives is because we enjoy it. Its sad that these people think low of people like Earl. Earl, you, me the people that he helps, all know what earl is truly like, and at the end of the day its their Opinion that truly matters. Earl beilves in a ideology, something he is passionate about, something most of those journalists can't say...(Shallow fucking pricks, do anything for clicks ) Don't make fun of people like earl :("
offmychest,fdknwfd,t3_eltqzk,1578507487.0,"I can understand your pain. It sucks that the top 0.1% of the population have all the control on whether countries should go to war. They need to understand that when you declare war on a nation, you not  only declare war on their governments but also declared War on their people! It sucks that the world doesn't give a shit sometimes. That people care more about those own interests than for actual living breathing human beings like themselves. It makes everyone feel like the world is fucked, In the control of the greedy and selfish. BUT REMEMBER the world is in the hands for people like you and me. There will always be positivity in the world as long as we are here and believe that there is. This may all sound very naïve, but I don't like speaking anything but the truth. As long as people like you and me make positive changes in this world, things WILL change. As long as we don't lose hope and strive indefatigably... Those passengers all had dreams and ambitions, and won't be surprise if there was some political motive behind killing them and that saddens me. All I can do to make a difference right now is write this Reddit post, It ain't much but I think I have succeeded if I manage to change even one of the mindset if at least one people reading this. The future is and cannot always be this crap. We are humans, not rats, we can rise above this. Just act like humans, and we will be fine. My heart goes out to the families of the plane crash. Goodbye and do try and make a change, even if it is writing a 500+ worded essay that no one will read on Reddit."

Reading this post was like looking onto a mirror, I too come from a background of achievers and want to persue engineering. All I can say is don't give up, you say your father read an engineer right? Perhaps he has a few connections? Try appliying online. Mabey try for foreign jobs with accommodation. Things look rough but I am sure you will find your dream job. I cannot imagine how depressed you feel. Please stay strong, I sincerely hope you find your dream job..."

Everyone faces such circumstances, and if your sister sombers up then good, if not, then who needs her? Its ok to hate family members lol, don't let her be an influence in your life. Remember you are the more mature person here."
offmychest,fdkjbsh,t3_elvl0c,1578504913.0,"Perhaps you are not ready for a committed relationship and hooking up with his friend is just your way of stalling or rejecting the idea of getting married. But if you are not up for a serious relationship, please don't act out like this, give it time and then when you are ready, move forward with your bf. It is very hard to get someone to love you unconditionally, many people are lucky to receive such partners oce in their lives, don't waste it. Act rationally. But, if being with your bf feels wrong in the slightest, plz break the relationship."
