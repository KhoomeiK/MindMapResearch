CPS,ffeb924,t3_et2jlu,1579841940.0,"First, someone said that cps cannot take
Custody without a signed court order. That is not correct. Cps can take custody of there is imminent harm.  They seek the court order after. I don’t want you to get bad information so I feel it is important to clarify. 

That said, what you have described does not present imminent harm therefore it seems incredibly unlikely a judge would sign such an order. 

If you want to talk further feel free to dm me. 

Take care- I suggest you go to the /parenting sub as they seem a little less tinfoil hat in their responses. 

I don’t think cps is always right, but I also think that some of the suggestions made on this thread are not helpful.

CPS,ffeahvz,t3_et38mh,1579841270.0,"I don’t know anything about the laws in your state, I can only tell you how it is handled in Texas. 

You are permitted to take any legally and medically prescribed drug in Texas. Simply testing positive for a narcotic when it is legally prescribed is not a basis for removal. We work these cases all the time.  The only time I can recall a child being removed in this kind of situation was when there was another issue also present.  This is what your doctor is talking about re: not all the information there.  I know of multiple women who had their children removed while on subutex when they tested positive for multiple drugs (subutex plus heroin etc) or if the parent was for some reason incapable of providing a safe home. By incapable of providing a safe home example I can recall personally removing a child when I made a home visit knowing the mom and child tested positive for subutex. I went to the home and the mother had passed out on top of her infant. She was staying with her friend so the friend told me to go to the mom’s room to talk with her and I walked in and saw that. I had to call 911 and get an ambulance out for the mom and the baby.  The mom overdosed and had to be hospitalized. The baby was checked out and thankfully was ok. So if you look at it, the removal was not because the mom tested positive for subutex, it was because the mom’s condition made it impossible to ensure the safety of the child. 

That said I will repeat that I know nothing of how your state treats these cases. 

If you feel they are looking in that direction then make sure you have all the contact information for a relative (your mom, father, sister or best friend) who will take the child into their home while the investigation runs its course. That will give the investigator time to fully evaluate the home and confirm everything you have stated about the addiction being under control and you being compliant with treatment. Make sure those
Persons who you want to care for your child short term have no criminal history or history or valid cps cases. 

Your case is quite common and I really feel fairly sure this would not even be considered to be a court case, but just in case be prepared. 

Good luck!  My thoughts are with you. Addiction is a beast to overcome and it sounds like you are doing a lot right.  Keep your head up and know your work is making a better life for you and your baby."
CPS,ffdbgcb,t3_esxq3i,1579817286.0,"You sister can leave foster care when she turns 18 years old but as the other commenter mentioned, there are programs to keep kids longer because the children may wish to finish high school, go to college, get life skills (like how to manage money etc) and there are programs to teach those skills.  If a child absolutely does not want to stay in foster care after 18 they can go but the worker will try to make sure they have a safe place to live and some resources.  

If your sister wants to live with you, you are willing to take her, you have the ability to take her and you don’t have cps or violent criminal history you could certainly be studied for placement and that should only take a few weeks (assuming you live in the same state- it takes longer if more than one state is involved). I say violent criminal history because placement would not be  refused because you had tickets for driving, or minor mischief that happened year ago. It is the drugs, violence, etc that will hold up a placement. 

Your sister likely has a guardian ad litem or  attorney at litem. Speak to them!  Speak to the worker. 

Kids your sisters age are not well suited to foster care. The whole almost adult thing makes foster care really hard for them and many kids run from foster care and that is when tragedy can happen. 

I am not from Ohio but I suspect things are fairly similar in these respects. 

Praying for you all."

CPS,ffceuv4,t3_esv4ac,1579797951.0,"If texting is a means of communication established with clients then the caseworker should be responsive.  You can always call her supervisor and say you left messages (texts etc) and ask that you receive word back. I received those calls often as a supervisor and I always had the workers call by close of business that day.  It is worth a try. 

Saturday visits are uncommon so you are lucky to have them. Typically workers have Saturday and Sunday as their time with their own families. It is much needed  time off for them. Workers often have to work late into the evening during the week so weekends are typically off limits.  Of course that does not explain why the worker has failed to make contact with you."

CPS,ff9y54u,t3_es8wn1,1579724028.0,"To answer OP- not much you can do but make sure to be open with the day care, school etc about difficulties with the dad without trashing him. Just a “we have a lot of conflict and co-parenting has been real difficult” . That way they have a feel for what you are working with. Be open with them about any concerns you have with your child and work with them. They are the most likely individuals that cps will call to check up on your child to make sure the kid is ok. 

Seems likely that cps will quickly see that this is a false report and they will shut it down fast.  Those cases were a love/hate when I was a worker-loved them because I loved to see kids doing well and I could close the case rapidly.  Hated them because I hated the intrusion and stress for the parent and child. 

Good luck."
CPS,ff9xqyw,t1_ff9oa63,1579723794.0,"That is very rarely successful... at least in my home state. The judge would only release the information if they could prove up that the allegations were false and were made in malice. That is much harder than you think.  

I know when I worked in a smaller county we had some cases very similar to what you write about- an absent parent making unfounded allegations against the parent with conservatorship.  We found a way to flag those cases and were able to do a little background before initiating an investigation.  It enabled us to not work many further investigations.  The dept has to be really careful because we do not want to assume nothing is wrong just because we see no sign of it so often you have to get to multiple investigations unfounded before this kind of action can take place.  

As for the Judge releasing the complainant name-never seen it happen in 27 years. I have testified in hundreds of cases over the years and seen many lawyers ask for the name’s release I have never seen the judge release it.  A half dozen times I went to the judges chambers with the judge solo to answer to the judge and each time he/she has failed to release. That is not to say it is not ever done, I just don’t want anyone to believe that it is commonplace and spending the kind of money to take that to court will have a high likelihood of success. I suspect it is a region by region thing."
CPS,ff7s7ok,t3_erv3eo,1579657084.0,"If the child is not ready to tell what is happening there is really nothing CPS can do.  The event with the bathtub is certainly serious enough for intervention but it is in the past and the kid was not ready to talk at the time. If a worker goes out on a case and the child says there is no abuse and is free from injuries then the dept has no way to intervene.  

I feel like an old tired record, but the child needs to begin to establish a relationship with a trusted adult, and if that person was at school it might even be better. School, coach etc. she needs to develop trust with someone so that when something happens they will believe her and help her.  In addition they can help the child understand that nothing will change if she protects an abusive parent. Her safety is more important. 

From what you say counseling is out, but that would have been an option and many schools have low cost resources they can refer the family to.

If you wish to talk you can dm me. I work for cps in Texas and I know the ropes."

CPTSD,fezd2dj,t1_fezb2f6,1579456069.0,"I am so sorry. How painful.  Police hold a lot of power and authority. With great power comes great responsibility (wasn’t that In spider man?)  and yes, giving someone that power can certainly give them an outlet to abuse it just like anyone else. Think abusive fathers who beat up on their kids when they are angry at the boss etc.  so yes, there is a fertile field for someone who has issues. 

I am not suggesting your experience is not real, only that the broad brush is not accurate. It’s unfair to paint all cops with the label. The truth is back in the day we romanticized cops and naively believed that they could not possible be bad guys but reality is that some are, and they are the ones that should never have been given the badge to begin with. 

Again, so sorry for what you experienced. The betrayal from a spouse and a protector figure (police) is overwhelmingly complex.   Sending you ((hugs))"

CPTSD,fez1rxf,t1_feyoh9e,1579453099.0,"What stats are you talking about? Ok, there is no peer reviewed statistic that shows that all or nearly all police abuse their children or their spouse. Do they have those social problems in their ranks, sure they do. They are not immune from the social ills that permeate the culture. Is it harder to take that some offend against children or partners? Yes, because they know the law and are sworn to protect people... but in the end they are people, just like the rest of us and some of them should not be carrying a badge and gun. Basically, they are human and some of them will be bad humans and some good.  That said, over 26 years I have worked in conjunction with many police officers and I have known their families. I know countless cops who are wonderful mothers, fathers and partners.  I am not suggesting that no cops out there engage in child abuse and partner abuse but to say that nearly all do is not correct or supported by peer reviewed research. 

And just in case there is confusion, I have never worked for the police. I work for cps.  I’m a social worker, not law enforcement.... 

And for OP, I completely agree with OP, distress. The cop who brushed off the caller was dead wrong. Are there some children who falsely report abuse when they get angry at parents- sure. To make the leap from that to discounting a person simply because they say their parent assaulted them is a huge leap in logic that is not supported by the simple fact that children are abused every day by their parents. Not all children- not all parents.... but we need to find out which ones are in danger and help them rather than making assumptions which leave children at risk of harm in a home that presents real abuse."

The dept seeks to close cases quickly though I agree it does not always happen quick enough. That is more an issue of workload rather than some nefarious desire to seek out dirt on people.

If your question is about what cps could do I would say that what you describe is wickedly dangerous and not likely to be a first time (of radically dangerous behavior). 

The age of the events does make it hard to investigate but situations like these tend to have other events that come out in the investigative stage.  My recommendation is to engage a trusted adult (school teacher, coach etc) and begin to develop a relationship with them. They can help to determine next steps.

CPS,fend1iz,t3_epy0el,1579282077.0,"It’s not a question of whether or not it sticks.... it is a question of whether or not the events that unfolded fit the statutory definition of abuse or neglect where you live. 

My advice is twofold- tell your siblings if someone asks about homelife they be honest and tell what happens. Parents often coach children that what happens in the home stays in the home. That can make it very difficult to investigate a case and often caseworkers strongly feel abuse/neglect is occurring, but without evidence their instinct is meaningless. And second- details, details, details. When the kids talk to cps or if you talk to cps- be prepared to give details.  A kid saying “dad hit me on the back of the head” can mean anything from dad playfully tapping the head as a loving gesture to dad forcefully slapping the back of the head causing the child to lose balance and end up on the ground.  See the difference in details? The worker will probe in the interviews but there is no way for the worker to know exactly what to ask in all situations.  I would always rather spend a lot of time in an interview teasing ourselves details re: non abuse issues and know the child is safe...

CPS,fejyywg,t3_epa32w,1579189031.0,"What you are talking about is fairly common. On a child that age words are not always precise. The dept’s assigned worker will talk to all children in the home and determine if they are safe. If there are no injuries and the child who is allegedly being harmed does
not report being “stomped” or otherwise harmed the dept will likely talk to collaterals who see the children regularly to make sure nothing is missed. That could be the school or pediatrician. 

Many kids say things that are easily cleared up in an interview. Case in point, my adult niece said her father broker her arm when she was maybe 4. A simple talk with the child clarified that her dad was holding her by the hands and spinning her helicopter style. She was having a blast. Her elbow joint moved (nursemaid elbow) and it was easily fixed. But to the child her dad did break her arm. Also clear to the child is that they were playing a game and he was not trying to hurt her. She was not scared of her dad and she adores him, but her factual understanding was that her dad broke her arm.  So even though it was an accident not at all involved in abuse and even though the arm really was never broken, she was telling her truth.  This kind of misunderstanding is easily clarified in an investigation.  

The flip side is that there are some parents who think of children as possessions that they can harm when they are angry or when the kids do something wrong. They have a lack of impulse control or even an excess of anger that leads to true abuse that can have life long repercussions. The only way to know the difference is to investigate. Children are too young and vulnerable to just “hope it is nothing.” 

Anyway, seems like this situation would be cleared up easily and the family will be off the CPS radar quickly. 

Some people say not to talk to cps etc. That is bad advice.  It can result in things getting escalated, especially when the kids are young and lacking outside monitors.  That can lead to bad outcomes for the family in cases that never needed that escalation but it was impossible to make that call without (you guessed it) talking to the family. 

That said, nothing wrong at all with engaging an attorney to walk you through the process. The lawyer will cost you money and likely the process will take a bit longer as you have to coordinate the schedule of the worker, the client and the attorney, but not a bad idea if it makes you feel better about the situation. 

Make sure the attorney you get knows family law and understands CPS cases. I have seen many attorneys who handle non family law issues give really bad advice to families. A family law attorney will know the courts, the laws and they will understand how to navigate the system."
socialwork,fej2jis,t3_epd5if,1579154510.0,"I am so sorry. You are likely overwhelmed with emotions because a person died.

I agree that your sup could have been more supportive in your time of stress. You are not responsible for the the self sabotaging decisions of your client. You do what you can, but in the end they make their own decisions.

CPS and the laws that are the basis for CPS legal intervention understand that sometimes financial problems occur that leave a family vulnerable to
Homelessness and even poverty.  CPS wants to make sure the children are healthy,  safe and protected. That can be achieved in many ways.  When the worker goes out show them where the kids sleep, that they have food and clothing and how the kids are protected from danger.  They may even talk to the school and likely the school would confirm that the kids are well cared for and CPS will move on. They have far more cases than they can manage and do not want to spend time if they know a child is safe.

Habitual use is another story but not relevant here.  It is hard to say if it would show up in a drug test but if no test is run, it is not an issue. 

Yes, they can drug test your child without your knowledge but I have never known medical professionals to do that unless there was a reason - signs of substance use, an admission of use, something about the baby’s health that indicated a problem etc...  see paragraph 1. 

Assuming you have been honest about only one use and no habitual use I would recommend you forget it, not bring it up again and take care of yourself and your baby. Don’t let your stress about this impact you but also don’t create any habits that may well create problems later.  

You got this."

Going to be a while of rolling with the waves and trying to hold space to feel what you are feeling rather than numb it with substances.  Give yourself a little grace and be kind to yourself and for goodness sake,  pat yourself on the back for this first (in a line or many) success."

CPS,fdj9gxv,t3_elhiis,1578462337.0,"If a child does not visit/live there CPS does not have to go there.  Plenty of people have sub-optimal living situations some even live in their cars, etc and as long as the kids are not living in an environment that does not meet their needs it should not be a cps issue. That said the children’s home would need to be safe, clean, with access to full utilities.  
 
An interview at the office should be possible but the fact that you said the dept wanted to review the housing kinds suggests to me that the report may have allegations that the children are living in an unsafe environment so this may well become a problem."
CPS,fdj8rw2,t3_elnr48,1578461724.0,"How things unfold in an investigation is quite complex. No way for me to know what happened without having been there. The same is true for you.   Only your friend and his mom
Know what was said and what evidence was or was not available.  A four year old (sibling) would not typically be a great source of information due to their cognitive functioning level but that is not always true. I also don’t know what factors are relevant for your friend. 

My suggestion would be for the child to develop a relationship with a trusted adult at school or other environment (scouts? Sports? Etc). S/he needs to talk to someone and develop a relationship of trust. That will not only help your friend to talk through some of this but also give your friend access to a person who can see the injuries etc If there is something  actionable they can engage authorities. 

Cases with older teens are really tough but I don’t understand how  the dept failed to see and act on injuries present on one or both children. Not saying it can’t happen- just saying I don’t understand how the worker, the counselor and the police officer saw injuries and failed to get to the bottom of it.  Any CPS worker talks with parents who talk a good game every single day but it is hard to explain away injuries that are consistent with non accidental trauma (abuse).  

I’m sorry your friend is experiencing this. All kids deserve a safe and loving home."
CPS,fdhvcla,t1_fdf974l,1578430813.0,"Well that makes sense. Our records are automated so essentially there is a database but it is not accessible to
Anyone outside the dept. All cases are kept on file until their purge date.  The database with all cases is definitely not the same as the Child Abuse Registry which only tracks validated cases.  I suspect our processes are family similar in that respect. 

Lots of people with investigations are fantastic parents who did not do a thing wrong, but the investigation has to confirm it due to the vulnerability of children. Many parents are good parents and has a momentary lapse of reason that would likely not happen again, and they move forward from their case never to talk to CPS again. The number of truly bad parents that not only abuse their child
but seem incapable of empathizing with their child and finding another way is quite small when you look at total numbers."

CPS,fdcpqir,t3_eknc3d,1578280948.0,"For the most part CPS would get involved in a case such as that only when a doctor or medical practitioner  assessed that the actions of the parent were endangering the child and made the complaint to the dept.  I can’t see a scenario when a family member, friend or other person would call that in and it would investigated without a medical referral from a doctor, hospital etc. There is too much room for abuse by people who feel they know better than the parent therefore it all typically falls into the hands of medical professionals."
CPS,fdchx83,t3_eklr2c,1578275324.0,"In a case like they will do all the interviews and background checks and confirm that the kids were not left alone by you (confirm that the relative actually was there and did fall asleep) and ensure you have a plan for supervision in the future. They should be able to close it out quickly.

Oh, and go ahead and put locks high up on the outside access doors or in some way ensure that your 3yo can not pull another Houdini trick. :)"
CPS,fdc5p70,t3_ek3sfa,1578267614.0,I don’t know what Ontario does but in Texas a case that was not confirmed abuse cannot be on the registry. It only seems logical they would not have it on the registry because why would one notify that no abuse occurred but I cannot speak from any basis of knowledge about Ontario

I also have a tiny little bell that I ring every time I put food out  so they pair the food with the bell. That helps in those cases when it rains hard and their  food goes out a bit later.  

I have yet to have any unwelcome animals. In the coldest parts of winter I put outdoor shelters in the yard.   The catnip does sound like a lovely addition."

CPS,fd42z86,t3_ejwp6v,1578163897.0,"Depending on what is said and how etc it is not likely to be abuse. A lot depends on the age of the child and specifically what is said and how. A parent can be yelling to tell the child to not touch the stove, pick up their possessions, not hit a sibling . it could also be  a situation where the parent is cursing  at the child, calling them worthless  and creating a situation of emotional abuse that could adversely impact the child in such a way as to create an emotionally abusive environment. It is tough to tell.   Perhaps listen and discern if it feels abusive vs jarring (disturbing the peace). 

Thank you for being concerned about the child."

CPTSD,fd3y9vv,t1_fd3uzlr,1578162694.0,"I totally understand where you are coming from, but in six months to increase your contact with people the way you have is great work!  I think it is a slow process and sometimes it is serendipity that puts the right person in your orbit. One of my close friends I have i met (friend of a friend) at lunch about 2 years ago. I only saw her with my friend for lunch at first but over time we started to talk.  I saw she was super stressed and work and asked if I could help. She offered condolences when my dad passed. Over time we started taking walks at lunch or after work and an occasional dinner.  We have become quite close. So... it can happen even to those of us who are slow to let our guard down. 

Hang in there! You are doing some very big work.  ❤️"

CPS,fd3w1yu,t3_ejx566,1578162150.0,"CPS has policies for when contact must be established and measures for determining what actions are appropriate.  I suggest going up the line of supervision. If that does not work see if there is an Ombudsman’s Office or you can even contact you state senator to seek an inquiry. The dept must be responsive within policy and they must ensure the safety of the child. 

I see some suggest you may be attempting to use the dept to intervene in an improper way. I have no way of knowing if that is true for pure intention or for means of manipulation. Regardless, no matter what way you go, the individuals looking at the complaint will look at the case history, the actions taken by the dept and determine if all has been done to ensure safety for the child. Making complaints as a means of pressure only works if the dept’s actions were viewed by the reviewer as insufficient or excessive.  If the actions of the dept are determined to be sufficient there is no harm done other than a bit of inconvenience to the worker and that is just a part of their job. If the actions are not deemed to be insufficient then the complaint process and second set or eyes will generate the actions that should have been taken in the first place."
CPTSD,fd3tvt5,t1_fd3rwkp,1578161613.0,"It is but if we find a job that is personally meaningful it can create a purpose in our life. I have found through the years that we need a purpose be it parenting a  child, doing important work, working for a relationship with a spouse etc. we all must have a purpose that gets us out of bed in the morning and forces us to keep a routine. Not being married or a parent, my job has been that purpose.  After 27 years I have found that it is time for a new purpose so I plan to change my job in mid year if I can figure out what my next calling is... :)"
CPTSD,fd3t6ev,t3_ejxo0u,1578161409.0,"I have never thought that the reason parents fail to provide a supportive, safe and loving home was as relevant as the damage they do.  One cannot compare suffering. All suffering is a true loss for the persons involved  and for society at large as this kind of personal suffering robs the world of actualized, healthy persons.  

I would say my mother was more immature though with a strong narcissistic streak. I did not suffer the way many here have but I have never felt invalidated. Maybe it is because I strongly believe that all suffering is tragic and I would never believe that someone who suffered something objectively worse than I did was more deserving of compassion, support and healing. We all deserved better and comparisons don’t serve the work of healing.
