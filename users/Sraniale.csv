college,feef810,t3_eomjwv,1579032528.0,Honestly I study a lot but that’s because I have no life. So it’s not like I am getting invited to go out. I’ll usually do a full day of reading on the weekends or just a couple hours after school.
college,febtcxu,t1_feagqj6,1578962475.0,"I'm taking Stats I and II in the spring since they don't offer the first one in the winter! Well thank you for your advice, I was asking myself ""do I need this unnecessary stress?"" and that helps with my answer."
college,feadfn1,t3_eo50o7,1578947292.0,"Last semester, my schedule was 9-6. I ended class 5:15 but the bus usually had already left just as I got there or it was late. Honestly, the only thing that kept me going every day was the mandatory attendance for one of my classes but other than that, stay caffeinated and get good sleep. Otherwise, the day will feel super slow. 

Bring a textbook, start studying for a class, or just bring a pair of headphones if you just want to chill and watch Netflix. I feel like I got a lot done while I was on my spare though which is one benefit."
college,feaca0a,t1_fea6q3j,1578946917.0,"I haven't even started the calculus portion yet and I'm already thinking about dropping it. I have until the 17th and it's not a part of my major either, I Just needed another open course lol"
college,fe6izjz,t3_enrdiv,1578892420.0,"Been studying since I have a few tough classes I'd like to get ahead on. Safe to say I am scared to leave accounting and calc 1 to last minute. So far calc is just a pre-cal review, thankfully (I'm just waiting for it to get crazy)."
Botchedsurgeries,fe5sue7,t3_enqdhl,1578874187.0,His face confuses me because he looks old yet young at the same time.

AskReddit,fe3lq02,t1_fe2of7q,1578850453.0,"Most definitely, these people try to act like a friendly, trustworthy, and kind co-worker. In reality, they get to know you only to use it against you.

Learned this the hard way by being naive and eventually said co-worker outed me to another co-worker."
AskWomen,fe35ocs,t3_encl38,1578846139.0,"This thread brightened up my mood reading it, made me feel less lonely tbh."
GetStudying,fe0fqut,t1_fe0cim0,1578812672.0,"You can watch videos about active recall if you’d like. It’s super useful. I would suggest trying Anki or Quizlet. I prefer Quizlet though, it’s very boring at first filling it out and you eventually get sick of it after a week or two of usage. The main benefit is that you really do retain information so well because you’re trying to reach for answers in your head and you memorize it the next time the Flashcard question comes up. Over time, you remember more and the key is repetition. Do your set once a day until the midterm or final comes for a week or so."
college,fe0f8hl,t3_enj55m,1578812392.0,"Last semester felt exactly like that. It went from September to December so quickly. This semester feels like it’s going to move fast as well, I am excited for it to go by fast because I’ll be closer to graduating which means ... money, woohoo."
52book,fdmwvg2,t3_elmkza,1578569479.0,I just started this week! I'm on chapter five right now and I already like it so much. I have an idea of what will happen to Dantes (due to the prologue and an Amazon review) and I'm eager to see how it all unfolds. I wish I got the paperback instead since I like how the penguin classic books look.
books,fdmwj2u,t3_eluaoj,1578569059.0,"It's more self-doubt for me. For example, when I write on r/52book \- I don't want to write an in-depth review because I feel like no one would care enough to read it anyways. Another part of it is that I don't want to write a review and sound stupid."
StardewValley,fdkkoua,t3_elqsh9,1578505587.0,This looks like Ini Miney from Phoenix Wright as well!
UpliftingNews,fdfvpns,t3_el2nnm,1578371480.0,"Really sad to think about when dogs are so loyal, innocent, and sweet. I hope karma serves them real good because this is just beyond selfish, it’s sick. Just thinking about her starving inside a dark suitcase while pregnant just sickens me tbh."
antiMLM,fdfqpcr,t1_fdevz12,1578367896.0,"Me neither. I feel like MLMs are just sketchy all throughout. Anybody with intuition or some financial stability would not even waste their time on this. I think what makes MLMs sad is that it preys on people who are vulnerable. Sometimes not even vulnerable but those who want extra income and don’t actually realize how much they’re spending vs how much they’re actually getting paid. 

It’s just encouraging people to stupidly go into debt. The further you go, the more you’re encouraged to spend such as having your name signed on the lease payments of a car. So what happens if someone can’t meet them? It’s not the MLMs fault if someone isn’t selling product. Just gross that these types of businesses can still exist. So many issues but now I’m just rambling!"

AReadingOfMonteCristo,fdfef0t,t3_ekkjuq,1578359753.0,"I think that Fernand will impulsively do something terrible to Dantès without murdering him. Fernand is so filled with rage that it’s probably going to be so hard to convince himself not to do something. To be honest, I’m pretty eager to see what these three stooges have planned for Dantès."

It seems I'm heading towards reading a lot of non-fiction this year. Just started reading within 6 months ago so I haven't quite figured out what my tastes are just yet!"
52book,fdal7z6,t1_fd9yizt,1578247335.0,"There are conflicting stories that I have read online from her own family, friends, and people who have personally known the family."
52book,fd9uek8,t3_ekcs3z,1578238176.0,"I *finished* one coming into the new year which was **A Quiet Life In The Country** by T. E. Kinsey. I will likely read the rest of the Hardcastle mysteries because they're so light and fun. I enjoyed the main characters a lot and really would like to see how they change throughout the series (I believe there are 7 books in the series).

I *started* **Educated** by Tara Westover. I'm almost finished and wow, this is a frustrating read but as you get to see the process of her breaking out of the abuse she faced, it is satisfying to see. I almost didn't want to finish this book because it was dry at first but it definitely got better after the story on the accident. Very inspiring book and truly makes you think about a world outside your own."
suggestmeabook,fd9dg9o,t1_fd94kfe,1578231897.0,"Second this, it’s a little bit tough at first but it feels much better when you aren’t constantly scrolling through people’s highlights and happy moments."
AskReddit,fd73qql,t3_ek6mky,1578199049.0,Just a guess but I feel like co-operatives as a form of business will rise
nosurf,fcxde2w,t3_ej2o9g,1578059917.0,"Honestly, all the social comparisons made me feel worse so I made the same decision especially with IG and Facebook. So far, it feels like the right thing to do because I don’t have anything I can compare to and I can just focus on reading books or playing videogames."
studytips,fcwluwk,t3_ej70p1,1578029268.0,"You can do both but I had a lot of handouts. If it’s all online then a notebook would be just fine. As for tips, practice as much as you can and someone has already mentioned Khan Academy but I really liked the Organic Chem Tutor on YouTube as well. There’s many resources on YouTube if you are ever stuck on any question."
books,fcvyek3,t3_eixln2,1578012934.0,"Completely agree, I actually recently watched a video with this same topic. To add to all you said, it's also okay to abandon a book you loathe reading. That's something I have to learn to do because I really do want to see things to the end but even a short book can take me too long to finish if I don't click with it."
education,fcn4wx7,t3_ei2o1q,1577803359.0,"I’m in Canada and my province has distance learning which is independently studying the material and sending it in online. It’s quite expensive though and you have one person you can email to help you so basically a tutor/teacher. At our uni, we also had math classes that could be used to fulfill the Pre Cal prerequisite.

I know you said you don’t want to go to school but based on experience I do highly recommend an adult learning school because it’s cheap and easy to earn the credits."

52book,fcn3nbg,t1_fcmyw8m,1577802364.0,"I’m excited, lots of great things to look forward to in the coming year. I will definitely read another Stephen King book and a lot of people seem to enjoy 11/22/63 just like with The Stand. I’m quiet myself so that sounds very assuring and thank you! I read a few books that were short to really meet the goal but I still met it nonetheless!"
52book,fcmtm5i,t3_eh52v9,1577791659.0,"Squeezed in a short book to reach my reading goal by reading **Of Mice and Men** by John Steinbeck. I enjoyed the book and definitely made me go ""oh gosh, oh no."" I also finished **The Alchemist** by Paulo Coelho and it is uplifting for an undergrad feeling completely unsure and lost. 

I started **A Quiet Life In The Country** by T. E. Kinsey. Almost to the halfway point, I think it is such a cosy mystery book that feels fitting to read during my winter break. I really do enjoy reading this because it's just so light and fun."
52book,fcmtbfq,t3_egrbs2,1577791245.0,"Hello Everyone! I'm a Canadian that started reading in the summer of 2019. I'm currently an undergrad student and I am hoping to switch from a general stream into accounting (hoping I don't regret it).

I plan to do 52 books in 2020. I started late in the summer so I'm really excited to read longer books as I read shorter books to fulfil my reading challenge. I'd really like to read more non-fiction. I did finish my reading goal for this year of 20 books and I'm very excited to hopefully read 52 books in 2020.

As for my first book of the year, I really enjoyed Stephen King's writing style on The Stand. I'm thinking about starting the year off with 11/22/63. Right now I'm reading A Quiet Life in the Country by T. E. Kinsey so I'll likely finish the book coming into the new year. My hobbies aside from reading are mainly videogames, I'm currently obsessed with Overwatch."
AskReddit,fcmsmp7,t1_fcmfdk0,1577790276.0,This sounds fun! I haven’t played in the long but I’ll occasionally binge for a week or two and never touch the game again until a year or so later.
GetStudying,fcmdg9k,t3_ehoejf,1577771344.0,"I just hope that all the hard work pays off in the end eventually to make me competent in the workplace. That’s the only thing I want, be the best for myself, have a couple of pups, live and have a decent amount of money to do what I want on my off times."
suggestmeabook,fcmbpzz,t3_ehnubu,1577769782.0,Woah this sounds like a very interesting genre of books. I’ve definitely been into cosy mysteries lately so the suggestions will be so useful coming the new year
antiMLM,fc41ucy,t3_efwg57,1577404413.0,Because being aggressive is going to help change people’s minds! Makes sense that we make fun of idiots who join these MLMs
