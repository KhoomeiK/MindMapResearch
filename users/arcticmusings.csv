writers,ff4ntke,t3_er5hh5,1579568134.0,"I feel like writing falls on a spectrum from chore to flow. On the chore side, it's hard to sit down every day and write. On the flow side, the words fly out of my fingertips, delighting me.  I am a pendulum, moving from chore to flow and back again. If I stop when it feels like a chore, I don't get to swing back to flow. 

When the words won't come, or I hate the words that come, I keep my head down and do the chore. It helps me to have a framework of where my story is going-- not really a solid plot, but just an outline. If I'm writing a story of rebirth, I define my main character, my dark influence, and the way I want my main character to overcome the dark influence. I define the motives for the dark influence, and I usually try to give a couple of extra characters motives that encourage them to make judgments about my main character. 

&#x200B;

Pick one of the seven story archetypes. Sit down, and start outlining that story. 

&#x200B;

With my last story, I picked the Chosen One archetype, but by the end of the story, it had become a story of Rebirth. My main character ended up rejecting the life that I had picked out for her, and she broke away from all the things I wanted her story to be. Instead, she chose a new life for herself, distancing herself from family and her people's society. I didn't mean for it happen like that... it just did. The more I thought about her, the more I realized that the rebellious Chosen One I picked would never accept that mantle. As I wrote her into and out of situations, I realized that her story needed to be different."
storyandstyle,ff3ggpy,t3_erbx0g,1579540535.0,"Do some research on the 7 story archetypes, and then try to read a story of each archetype. I think you'll have a hard time finding any successful author out there who says, ""Don't read."" Then, after reading a story of a given archetype, try writing a different story with the same archetype. That should help with your issue of concept of story.

&#x200B;

It's good to study the craft, but writing without reading is like learning to read music without listening to music. You need examples-- both good and bad-- so when you write, you can know what works for you and what doesn't. 

&#x200B;

As for breaking all the rules... yeah. People who know and understand the basic rules of writing, who have perfect those basic rules, can successfully turn them upside down and twist them. When you have a firm grasp on the basics, you can start executing things that surprise your reader when they still work. 

&#x200B;

When you're learning to write your alphabet, there's a bunch of rules on how each letter is shaped. The letters are plainly shaped without any flourish. Once you get the basics of each letter down, then you can start developing your own script, but that takes years of practice. And, we can all agree that there are people out there who write their letters just like we learned in kindergarten so well that it seems almost like a computer printed the letters. Even the basics can be impressive when well-executed. You're not writing for instagram; don't be afraid to work on perfecting the basics."

We took a boat down the river, then we fished while standing in thigh deep water. There were rules about not being able to fish within so many feet of the shore, so we couldn't fish from land.

writingcritiques,fcmae96,t3_ehxpo5,1577768631.0,"\*Try\* to get rid of all the I sentences. Rewrite them to show the same thing without using the words I/me. Instead of saying I miss you, say what you miss:

Your smile always lights up a room, and \[school, work, etc.\] isn't the same without you. 

Most love letters are about the writer's feelings... that is why we write love letters, but that's also another way that writers come across as self-centered. If you want to improve your love letter, build her up and encourage her. Tell her all the ways she's amazing without you as context. Instead of writing a letter explaining how she fits what YOU need, write her a letter that shows her what goes on inside your head isn't just about you. 

The ""do me a favor"" line absolutely rankled me, which might be my own bias... but don't ask her to do you a favor. Say something else like, ""I remember signing your yearbook to tell you that you're my favorite. You're still the most amazing woman-- strong, smart, and unmatched."" (Yes, I told you get rid of all the I sentences and then suggested that you also use an I sentence. Try to get rid of the I sentences-- it's unlikely that you'll be able to get rid of them all.)

Also, axe every mention of any kind of ex. Period. Don't discuss exes with someone you are not even officially dating yet. 

And finally... get rid of all the mopey bits about ""probably never going to use it... hope you write back."" You've just gone through all this effort to show her that you think she's wonderful and smart, and now you want her to pity you and write you back? Nope. You show her that you believe your opinion of her is high enough that you don't expect her to date you out of pity. Show her that even if she says ""not interested"" that you value her right to that opinion enough to accept it. Say something like, ""If you would like to get coffee and catch up, my cell is (Phone Number). Even if you don't, it's been nice to share fond memories with you.""

Stormlight Archive has plenty of things that are upbeat for me. I've read the whole series 3 times (including Edgedancer), plus some additional readings before all 3 books were released. The thing I dislike about the SA is that all the characters seem to be following the literary archetype of rebirth. Every. Single. Character. Even Jasnah who is supposed to be this super solid, unchanging, firm woman is just what's been reborn after a childhood bout with insanity. I wish there were some characters whose story lines didn't follow the rebirth archetype.  Hoid probably isn't following the rebirth archetype, and that might be why he's one of my favorite characters.

I really like books where the stories are in the same universe, but aren't necessarily following a given story line.
