femalefashionadvice,fcjfn3m,t3_eh7qdt,1577685854.0,iâ€™ve allowed myself to explore different styles and went out of my comfort zone. in the beginning of the year i was wearing like skinny jeans and crop tops like every other girl my age but i started wearing different things that may not seem like a big deal but weâ€™re way out of my comfort zone for me! it felt great and i want to continue exploring things in the next year to find out what i really like
