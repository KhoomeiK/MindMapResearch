unpopularopinion,ffb7wof,t3_esk8v0,1579754394.0,"While I agree that itâ€™s very awful when people do this, Iâ€™d like to just say that not every ESA is untrained, or unnecessary. While they do not have requirements aside from a doctors note, and are not the same as service animals, they still have their place in the world and when legitimate, they are valid. 

Not everyone can afford a service or psychiatric animal."
Dermatillomania,ffb7pnv,t3_eso3ui,1579754184.0,Iâ€™d get a proper evaluation and get the diagnosis before saying you have it

depression,ff68ty3,t3_erqjbv,1579621844.0,"As someone thatâ€™s been there, itâ€™s not that glamorous. In fact it made me more depressed. 

I was in the hospital for a month due to surgery for pancreatic cancer, went in a coma and almost died, and basically had to relearn how to do a lot of daily things like walking. I was on bedrest on a feeding tube for another month, same shit. 

It got really lonely and made me feel more pathetic. Lots of pain, helplessness, and desperation. 

And when that time is up, people stop caring even if you have after effects. And you remember who didnâ€™t visit and feel differently about them because of it. 

Then you sometimes wish you really would have died instead of survived."

also I went to a big bookstore chain a couple days ago and went to the Psych section and the only two books they had relating to BPD were negative views about someone ""escaping"" their ex partner with BPD."

I was in a similar situation a few years ago where I moved in with my long distance (now ex) boyfriend in his grandparents giant house, and they basically kicked me out so I wouldn't kill myself in their million-dollar house 

Turns out moving was the best thing for me, and I do not regret it a single bit.

pancreaticcancer,fe8ye5n,t3_entm2h,1578932344.0,"Have you had a ct scan by any chance? I had side pain at age 19 that led my doctor to give me a CT scan checking for appendicitis, and ended up finding my stage 3 pancreatic tumor on accident. 2 years ago in March though I had my Whipple surgery that removed it, and I'm living life happily now. My aunt passed from pancreatic cancer about 3 years before I found mine, so it definitely scared me, but I feel very lucky.

If that is what it is, it's likely they found it early. You should be fine as long as you don't have jaundice, extreme itching all over, and haven't lost a crazy amount of weight lately. If it is a tumor, and you're a candidate for the whipple surgery, feel free to reach out to me!"
