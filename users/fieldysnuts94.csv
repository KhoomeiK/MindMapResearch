I played it as a kid, it's fine. However, SoT has a vibe that attacts kids, its silly looking. Turning off chats to other crews limits that. Just gotta explaon to the kids about the dangers. My youngest brother plays it and he's a vicious little fucked.

 But to be balanced, I do support the idea that some games should have their age rating respected but despite that, all online games have it written that online interactions are not rated, since it can go beyond the boundaries of the ESRB. so I think with parent supervision on certain games, it can be fine. 

I've seen a lot of people play this game with their kids, so to say under 13 kids shouldn't play is a bit too much. Kids enjoy it, parents love playing with their kids, it's just the matter of other players. That dude was just mad that HE lost the treasure, most kids understand how it works and at generally forgiving (from what I encountered). Long as you're not shouting and cursing at kids, its fair game for everything else."
