That's not currently in the realm of medical possibility. There is no cure for narcolepsy, only the management of symptoms as they change and/or worsen over time. Most of the current medications just mask symptoms and don't even treat them. As more research is done into N and IH, more medications that will have better likelihood of managing symptoms will start to pop up to help us all out.

Narcolepsy,fepf4gt,t1_feotyps,1579318941.0,"> GeneSight and Genomind are two options that can tell you if thereâ€™s other meds you can metabolize better.

This is most likely a cost issue, if the OP is in the US. These tests are not covered under insurance for the most part. I work in medical, particularly insurance, and also have N. Metabolic testing is not considered medically necessary under most insurance plans and would be 100% patient responsibility after it denies. That means that the patient can be billed the full billable amount (higher than the insurance payable amount or the selfpay amount). If someone wanted to go this route, you would most likely have to sink cost into being a selfpay patient or have an amazing insurance plan.  

I say this as someone that is not a candidate for medication at all currently with N due to metabolic processing issues of stimulants (waiting on my next appt in a couple weeks to see if ANYTHING has hopefully changed with the new meds out there and me). I also say this as I said, as someone that has spent 5+ years working in neurology insurance in the US. I'm pretty well-versed in this and genetic testing for metabolic issues is not covered. I still wish I could have it to find out if anything could work for me, as they've just ruled me ""not eligible for medication"" at this point."

I don't have to leash her. She heels on command, comes on command. Stands down (doesn't like other dogs or animals) and she'll return to me rather than attack. She's truly the greatest dog ever. I wouldn't change a thing about adopting her."

todayilearned,fehp2on,t1_feh2x7u,1579121033.0,"True story... My dachshund-mix passed and I was on the hunt for another similar dog. Found one on the shelter website, but when I got there he'd been adopted already. So I wandered and found this GIGANTIC 35lb puppy that was only 4 months old. She wasn't potty trained, but she knew sit, lay down, and stay... and I was completely sold. Training her from there was easy peasy."

brakebills,fehl9w5,t1_fehl1cz,1579118838.0,Thanks! You're the first person to notice the reference. I wish whoever owned ourladyofthetrees was more active.
brakebills,fehkzrf,t1_fehkiut,1579118675.0,Oh they don't recognize and decline prepaid cards like they previously did? That's improvement!

> So, even though you presumably both agreed for him to be a stay-at-home parent, you punish him financially when he doesn't do what you want?

> Let me make this clear, this is abuse, and you're an awful person for doing it, no matter the reason.

Yeah, OP is bragging about financial abuse..."
