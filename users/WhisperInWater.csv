Even if she did trademark Stormi within cosmetics, I’m not sure she can go after her name being used 15+ years before.

I went to school with people who will never have to work a day in their life, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t learn, or have the opportunity to pursue their own careers later on in life. Why shouldn’t Kourtney’s kids have chance to go to college if they want to?

They can still travel on breaks. They can learn BOTH in school and from experiences and other cultures."

Same with other concerns such as acne, dryness etc. 

Of course, telling a other people about products you enjoy and giving recommendations is okay! I don’t have an issue with that, I love seeing others results and experiences with different routines. My problem is with blanket or misleading statements such as “use this to get rid of acne!” to make it sound alike they will work in anyone and get people to spend money, when the product is not going to work on everyone.

Hope I kinda explained my thoughts well"

I disagree about skincare just being trends though, I’d trust someone who focuses on whether a products works and it’s ingredients over what’s new and more often more expensive bc of marketing."
BeautyGuruChatter,fe9xcai,t1_fe9808b,1578942250.0,"I don’t think one has to be a dermatologist to give skincare advice, just as someone doesn’t have to be an architect to critique a building.

I can see how viewers would think if she is critiquing then she must be right. She doesn’t always give the best advice and has strong opinions but states it as fact. Dermatologists will say to keep doing what’s working for your skin, but Susan can’t accept that not everyone needs moisturizer for example. She also has a philosophy towards skincare about more expensive = better ingredients = better skincare bc she has a ton of affiliate links. Just doesn’t come across well."

It would be odd not to include that.

Edit: also we can’t dismiss her cover of Vogue and helping people get released from jail as just small things she did sprinkled in there. These are things Kim loveesssss to emphasize because they’ve made her more legitimate on her own, and have worked to remove her from the “famous from being famous” status the general public knows her by. As it’s been discussed here, it’s probably one of the reasons she announced she was working towards becoming a lawyer.
