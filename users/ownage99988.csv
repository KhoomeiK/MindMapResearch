MovieDetails,ffa4pap,t1_ffa3y4b,1579727831.0,"Well as far as DreamWorks goes they had done antz which iirc was a commercial failure, then back to back Prince of Egypt and then Road to El Dorado which were both great. Then they stumbled again with chicken run, but just based on reception. It was cheap to make and they won at the box office, and it’s another underrated movie imo. Disney was preoccupied with other stuff like the parks And Pixar was the one that was really slaying in those days. They had a string of like 6 or 7 smash hits and then Disney bought them"

WarshipPorn,ff8pklp,t1_ff7kqh8,1579690540.0,"Cutters are actually more or less the same size as destroyers. The new Legend Class boats are i believe like 450~ feet long and the Arleigh Burke is about 485~ or something like that. Also, the USCG ships don't have to carry a huge load of cruise missiles which take up a ton of space, so they probably have even more space than the destroyers.

The angles in this photo make both ships look smaller than they are, [here is a photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Bertholf%2C_Navy_ship_formation_A_110617-G-RS249-003.jpg) with the Legend Class USCGS Bertholf with the USS Lake Erie, a ticonderoga class, and USS Decatur, an Arleigh Burke Class.

Edit: It should be noted that the USCG ship in the original post with the russian ship is a Hamilton Class, not Legend Class. But the Legends are replacing the Hamiltons and fill the same role."
WarshipPorn,ff8p8eq,t1_ff71umr,1579690047.0,"I imagine theyre not even close to the power of the new Legend class cutters though- any other country would consider them full blown destroyers, they're almost as big as the AB Class. Biggest differences in armament between the two is pretty much just that the AB's have guided missiles and much more significant AA."

assholedesign,ff8nb7f,t1_ff8mxhc,1579687142.0,"I think I spoke in reverse earlier- I remembered something about this but I had it backwards after looking it up. Basically, the cord wasn't good enough to use for regular USB purposes so they made it so that you couldn't use it as an extender for other stuff. Along with that, the USBIF at that time wouldn't certify USB's to carry power through an extender because the tech wasn't good enough, but apples keyboard already had a built in USB cable to carry power. But to get around the 'no extenders' rule apple made this, so you could use it one way but not the other, and technically because it's not USB it doesn't have to be accepted by the USBIF and therefore they have no say in if apple can produce it"

assholedesign,ff8mhds,t3_es50m4,1579685864.0,"It's actually not asshole design at all. When this cable was released, probably 10 years ago, other USB's were not rated to be used for charging a laptop from a wall outlet. The cord would have burnt itself out from wall power. So apple made this beefed up version so that you couldn't burn out your other cables accidentally or potentially damage your laptop with a cord that wasnt meant for charging an entire computer. This isn't a normal USB cable, just because it happens to look similar doesn't mean it is. It carries far more power than a standard cable.

I see this posted all the time as proof of how evil apple is, and it's actually quite the opposite. There's plenty other to complain about apple for, this isn't one of them"

AskAnAmerican,ff1vayw,t1_ff1tpxk,1579486978.0,"The motivation and public danger is completely different. In a mass shooting the shooter is likely angry at society or a specific race or gender, for some perceived slight. A gang shooting is motivated by money, Territory, rivalries, whatever and are often explicitly targeted at one or more specific people. I’d say that gang shootings actually have more in common with say like someone who murders their significant other or child- it’s a very emotional action, but not usually premeditated and often have a specific target. mass shooters are more like serial killers. They’re deranged but everything is usually well planned out and they don’t have a specific victim in mind, it’s just whoever is unfortunate enough to be in their cross-hairs at the moment.

Basically, unless you’re in a gang, you’re probably not going to be killed in a gang shooting."
