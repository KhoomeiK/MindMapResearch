houseplants,fff445m,t3_etae0m,1579875190.0,I got one for 80$ locally but it was a rehab plant she disguised as a fully rooted plant.. learnt my lesson-- cheap prices aren't always a deal and plant people can be scam you too 😖

houseplants,ffcb1vu,t1_ffa0ccb,1579795577.0,The smaller one on the left was ordered from an online store and came drenched 😖 but once it put out one leaf its been one new leaf after another and it grew so much! I hope yours grows nice and big as well 🥰
TakeaPlantLeaveaPlant,ffc7mvq,t1_ffb6h7k,1579793406.0,I think thats the same person who wanted me to buy them a plant from an international seller for a pachanoi 😅 I backed out because I didn't feel comfortable paying 130+ on shipping alone 🤭

cactus,few0tge,t1_fev7rdm,1579403859.0,Thank you so much! I can't imagine how upsetting it would be to lose a cactus after 24 years.  I know people have different preferences but I'm hoping I can lessen the pain a little bit by surprising her with new cacti.
houseplants,fesltd4,t3_eqirbi,1579366582.0,Home depot and lowes occassionally has them. I got my monstera deliciosa from amazon awhile back.. ~25$ for 4 plants in one pot. There's also r/takeaplantleaveaplant but you may have to specify you want a rooted plant rather than a fresh cutting.. also always check out your local nurseries!
TakeaPlantLeaveaPlant,fenpppp,t1_felpff8,1579289062.0,Oh so the person who sold me the plant on the left told me it was a grandiflora because she thought the bloom looked similar but she wasn't sure. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/RgKlhrm)  is what it's bloom looks like!! I'm starting to think it may be a bit skinny to be a grandiflora though! (Edit: i think the left is actually a stapelia nobilis! Sorry about that!) And the plant on the right was sold to me as 'similis' from hirts but I haven't seen it bloom yet so i will be able to confirm what it is once it does!

I see how this can be addictive.. I'm hoping my fear will keep me from making impulsive choices but at the moment the feeders scare me more than Ts so I don't know how well that'll go for me 😅

ETA- i just checked you out and you have the cutest lil buddies! 🥰"
houseplants,felxjk8,t1_felf9iq,1579233457.0,Ah you are too generous! I actually have a monstera but I felt I needed to add it to the picture because it's one of the more prolific plants I've noticed in the plant community (and FLFs but I wasn't quite sure how to draw that one😅)
tarantulas,felxa02,t1_felf1sh,1579233260.0,"Yeah, I feel like that might have also been a possibility.. he had around 30 species for sale at the expo so he might have mixed them up too but I know now not to expect another molt for a looong time 😅"
tarantulas,felx6bt,t1_feleres,1579233182.0,When I first heard Ts could regenerate limbs I thought my friend was just teasing me! The more I learn about them the more I fall in love

tarantulas,felekwx,t1_felcpxl,1579220338.0,I was very confused because the seller told me it recently molted with him so I thought it was being a lil bugger for refusing food but it was a very nice surprise! She grew so little the new leg is almost the same size as her others 🤣
houseplants,fel554x,t1_fel4lgj,1579214274.0,Thank you 🥰 I want to fill it up with some more plants but it is so hard to think of plants on the spot 😅
houseplants,fekgcoo,t3_epgkjb,1579199468.0,"I agree with the other redditor, I was so scared getting my[ monstera](https://imgur.com/a/udhqeuL)  because I only have W/NW facing windows but it has grown like a weed! Always popping out new leaves.

Edited to add- if you have less light like I did, you won't get a lot of fenestrations on leaves. Grow lights are very helpful in that case-- especially during the winter.  (you can see all the old leaves with little to no fenestration in the picture, and the newer leaves popping out with some more after adding the additional grow lights)."
houseplants,fekeo7j,t3_epjpes,1579198467.0,I think i have the same [plant~](https://imgur.com/a/aXFNR1B). I think the stretching means it means more light! 🤗

houseplants,fedtotv,t1_fea0zao,1579019672.0,"Thank you so much, this has been very helpful. Just to bother you with one more question.. what kind of growlight do you use? I currently have a couple floor lamps with grow bulbs but I would love to find some I can put on my wall instead of trying to fit multiple lamps in the rooms 😅"
tarantulas,fecrc7w,t1_fecqmhk,1578981714.0,I think it is healthy too so I'm not too worried but I felt it was a bit odd. It is always wandering around/burrowing and running around when I refill its water but it hasn't eaten since I got it. I've been avoiding fruit flies because I've heard they were a pain to deal with but I may have to try to find some. Thank you for your input
houseplants,fe95l8y,t1_fe5lrhh,1578934472.0,Do you know if plant lights will be able to keep them happy? I have NW facing windows so most of my plants are supplemented with growlights throughout the rooms and I hope it will be enough for the gloriosum but am a bit worried
TakeaPlantLeaveaPlant,fe8jcxa,t1_fe8ddc4,1578926767.0,Here are some in my [collection](https://imgur.com/a/ZoALYw1)  that you haven't mentioned.. Most in my collection are from cuttings so they are a bit small. If you want the decaryi you may also have to wait  for it to grow a bit because I've been too afraid to try to propagate it and I'm not sure if the little shoots will make it through shipping 😅

Hedgehog,fe6cofz,t1_fe6a1to,1578887085.0,I just kept it wiggling in front of her in a place she was used to eating snacks. But honestly I have no idea.. she just decided to go for it today and absolutely fell in love. She is 6 though and up until yesterday she huffed and ran away from it the couple times I tried to give it to her so maybe just try in a familiar place when they usually eat (it was around midnight in this video 😅)

houseplants,fe2klaw,t3_ennhd7,1578839550.0,More humidity might help lessen the folds/dark spots but if I am mistaken please correct me ☺️
tarantulas,fdzu2vk,t3_enh8op,1578795810.0,I'm new to tarantulas and what I'm about to say may be really dumb and wrong (and if that is the case please correct me/tell me to shut up😅) but shouldn't you stab ventilation holes from the inside out? It worries me that the sharp plastic may harm the T but again I may be worrying about nothing. I would love to know if I am just over-worrying again
houseplants,fdzpa6n,t3_engmfs,1578792769.0,The number one tip to avoid overwatering is to not follow a set schedule (or at least in my opinion it is). Even within the same species of plants they are all different so go by the soil and weight of the pots! Some plants will even tell you when they need a drink.  You can also get a moisture meter to see when the best time to water will be because sometimes the finger test doesn't work.  You will get used to knowing when to water after having them for awhile and make sure they're in well draining soil and not in a pot that is too big bc that can also cause overwatering. Good luck !
Hedgehog,fdyrnhm,t3_en7tbu,1578782838.0,My girl is 6 and she hasn't gotten a bigger appetite than when I first got her.  Her bowl always has food in it because she stops eating when she is full so it could be growing a little bit at a time but its been pretty consistent how quickly/slowly she is able to finish the whole bowl. She hasn't lost any teeth though so maybe the change in food to accommodate that effects it?
houseplants,fdyk30y,t1_fdy32g3,1578780636.0,Aha it has its ups and downs! The one bad part was when my apartment building was filling with smoke in the lower levels but the alarms didnt go off (student apartments 🤦‍♀️) and I only found out because I was raising a dog at the time and she was going crazy! And death breath... can it really be that bad? 😂
houseplants,fdxy9du,t3_encj2p,1578774152.0,Everyone has different preferences when it comes to house plants and you may end up getting her plants she already owns. Why not take her to a nursery and letting her choose? That way you get to spend the day doing something she enjoys and you are supporting (maybe enabling 😜) her plant obsession. Just throwing that out there~

Aroids,fdvwh5x,t1_fdspc4b,1578752440.0,Im just commenting again because many people left advice on care and I'm not sure if you've seen it yet 😅 ignore me if you have read others' comments already
Hedgehog,fdvt4ro,t1_fdvodgw,1578751188.0,I tried feeding Zelda some mealworms a couple times but she would curl up and huff at it she does love eating/anointing broccoli though.. maybe its the whole being shy thing with a moving mealworm 😅 and hedgies have poor eyesight so we'll just say that was an accident and it thought your finger was a giant tasty worm 😂
Hedgehog,fdvmklm,t1_fdv7s38,1578749074.0,She is my first hedgehog and she was the shy runt of the litter! Her breeder told me that she may not live as long as the other hedgies but Zelda's definitely proven her wrong!
Hedgehog,fdvm8dv,t1_fdv25e6,1578748941.0,when I first got Zelda she would do this with a tp roll but she would slam down on the ground because she would put her paw inside the tubes! I thought it was because she was trying to explore the dark tunnel/trying to burrow (if that makes sense) because they love dark small spaces they can nap in! But then again Zelda might just not be the brightest at her age 😅
houseplants,fdtv8ol,t1_fdtlut7,1578722751.0,I don't have a sense of smell so it is really interesting to learn that ferns are fragrant! I've always thought it was just flowers that smelled

Aroids,fdt6gy6,t1_fdt5488,1578712539.0,"Ah i have been told that they liked being in moist soil and to not let them dry out, i will be sure to wait now so it won't get root rot! My thai constellation came with a bit of root rot and I'd rather not go through all that stress again 😅 thank you!"
Aroids,fdt1f7d,t1_fdszow6,1578710673.0,Thank you so much! I am gaining more confidence and may end up getting the plant after all.  Humidity and the amount of light was the biggest factor I was afraid of (all my windows are west facing so I have growlights to make up for it😅) but it seems it may be okay with the environment i have in my home

dogswithjobs,fdswhma,t1_fdsw1pz,1578708848.0,Thank you! I think being derpy was actually better than having a successful 'puppy eyes' look. That would have made raising her so much more difficult 😅
dogswithjobs,fdsvucd,t1_fdrtoas,1578708601.0,98% of photos i have of her have her mouth open/tongue out 😅 she ends up looking so [derpy](https://imgur.com/a/1ewQgeP)  but I promise you she is smart!
Aroids,fdsou3y,t1_fdso7vd,1578706020.0,Will do! But I can't seem to find that much information about them 😖
Aroids,fdsmser,t1_fdskea9,1578705263.0,I was so worried 60 wouldn't be enough humidity for them! That is good to know thank you. The person I am getting it from has it growing in moss so I may leave it like that until it outgrows its pot and I figure out some more on its care (if I end up getting it 😅)
Hedgehog,fdseltu,t1_fdse1ze,1578700932.0,"Thank you! I honestly did not expect her to live this long when I got her and especially since I recently found out they don't typically live much longer than this... i think it is time to spoil her a little bit more for making it this long 🤗

dogswithjobs,fdrgqt2,t1_fdr6iht,1578684290.0,"It is really a great experience! You start raising them when they are puppies and its honestly surprising how much they can do and how much they can help another person. Of course there are very frustrating/challenging times and it is a lot of responsibility so if you have the time and financially-able, you should definitely do it! 


Adding this one bit here because Pita unexpectedly developed a very sensitive stomach around 5 months. I had to boil chicken for her every morning since regular dog treats didn't sit well with her and she had to take prescription dog kibble which made it more costly.. it was so bad she trained me to wake up in the middle of the night to the sounds of her panting  to get busy outside 😅. Not all dogs are like this and I am in no means trying to deter you from becoming a puppy raiser! It is not all sunshine and rainbows and can be exhausting at times but its honestly such a great experience and I recommend anyone who can put the effort into it to go for it! 💕"
tarantulas,fdr0tmm,t1_fdqzc8i,1578677930.0,I think its because hamoriis are a lot more common and you can't really tell the difference between them until theyre a significant size (which takes FOREVER since theyre so slow 😅) so they just go by hamorii until proven otherwise
tarantulas,fdqyuty,t1_fdqxs7l,1578677004.0,"From my understanding of what I've been told, the annitha became a smithi and the smithi became a hamorii. It really is a bit confusing and frustrating.. i would love to know if anyone knows for sure because I feel like it would be a never ending chain if annitha is a separate species that is getting mixed up again with a different species 😖"
tarantulas,fdqx6li,t3_ems3g8,1578676075.0,When I bought my first tarantulas at the expo I asked the guy the same question and he told me that they were two different species. People have just been mistaking a hamorii for a smithi so most of the Ts that were bought as a smithi are turning out to be hamoriis! He also mentioned that what we thought was a Brachypelma Annitha is a smithi.. but maybe someone more knowledgable on this sub can explain better or correct me because the seller at the expo could have been misinformed as well.
