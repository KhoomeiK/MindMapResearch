memes,ff5x5eg,t1_ff5wupk,1579613188.0,"Honestly, I’m not sure if I remember correctly. I just know he had an accident from his early teens and was told he could never have kids. If they had know there was a chance they would’ve used protection since she was in college and the timing wasn’t the best."
memes,ff5w9p7,t1_ff5qle2,1579612378.0,"My friend is proof of that. Her husband was told he was sterile. 4+years of unprotected sex later and BAM. Little baby boy. He was tested and obviously wasn’t sterile anymore. 

And yes, the kid is very clearly his and now he has a little brother."
memes,fey3l2m,t1_fey26l6,1579440343.0,They said he was negligent. He actually implanted 12 embryos in her. Which is 10 too many. He also f’ed up at least one more patient.
memes,fey0ko1,t1_fexerkt,1579439156.0,Yeah... and the doctor who is responsible for that lost his license.
oddlysatisfying,fewrwam,t1_fewm7ky,1579418574.0,And I get that reference
EverythingFoxes,fewebe6,t3_eqq8vl,1579409165.0,Finnegan is so cute!
aww,fentros,t1_feniqo9,1579290666.0,Yes! Her tricks are so good!
NatureIsFuckingLit,feioozo,t3_ep7h7h,1579143453.0,It’s so cool looking but I’d immediately want to shower
nextfuckinglevel,fein2nk,t1_feic79e,1579142377.0,How did you find this out? You’re the second person I’ve heard that has this
TalesFromYourServer,feimsy4,t1_feibj7s,1579142197.0,"Yes! No one gets this. I don’t care if you’re 16 or 86, no ID = no drink."
memes,fehttw7,t1_fehgpl7,1579123741.0,"Have you looked at how much the cost has gone up for college? Even with the price adjusted to reflect inflation, college tuition has gone up >200%."
AmItheAsshole,fehrjlf,t3_ep1uwm,1579122454.0,"NTA. I had a destination wedding. I had ONE bridesmaid-my sister. I didn’t want to burden anyone else with the costs and let everyone know they were welcome to come but if they couldn’t afford no hard feelings. 

There’s no need to overspend in something that isn’t even for you."
ChoosingBeggars,fehqq83,t1_feh3b5e,1579121985.0,"Yes! I’ve found people who have to tell everyone how good their life is, in social media or otherwise, are never really that happy. People who are happy and content with their lives don’t need to shout it from the rooftops."
AmItheAsshole,fdwqa8w,t1_fdvw78n,1578761353.0,That’ll be a hard pass
AmItheAsshole,fdto7d4,t1_fdsqwsy,1578719633.0,I...I have another dad?

Keep up your PT and stretch!"
aww,fdshze3,t1_fdsekzd,1578703104.0,He definitely only did it to my hand. Didn’t do it to my spouse. He would follow me back and forth in his tank. Probably bc I fed him.
toddlers,fdsb91y,t3_ems3m3,1578698628.0,I have 15 month old twins. My girl has been a great sleeper for a while. Sleep 10-12 hours without a wake up and will nap anywhere. My son still wakes up during most nights and reeeeeeaaally prefers to nap in his crib. Makes it hard to be out and about. Can’t complain too much bc he used to be a much worse sleeper.
aww,fdrmnxb,t1_fdr77j1,1578686711.0,Well this is awkward. My slider used to do this to me...
Awwducational,fdo0g8u,t3_em6hck,1578596565.0,"Nuts! I had to look this up for myself. All (as a rule) mammals have 7 cervical vertebrae. Sloths and manatees are the only to have different. Manatees have 6, 3 toed sloths can have 8-9, and 2 toed can have 5-7. Apparently being slow allowed their necks to evolve without the downfalls that would happen. Huh, learn something new all the time!"
Handwriting,fdnh446,t1_fdnghmf,1578585678.0,I found it easier to draw/ trace anatomical structures with color coding. Then practice doing it again and again and working to not needing a reference.
Handwriting,fdnfm08,t1_fdncvpr,1578584769.0,"I’ve used colored pens, marker, and pencils. I had an anatomy teacher encourage using colored pencils to help differentiate nerves, etc."
Handwriting,fdn3boh,t3_em60mo,1578576050.0,I love the use of different colors. I found that helped me study when I was in school.
EverythingFoxes,fdn18l0,t3_em8jsj,1578574167.0,I’ll always upvote Juniper!
bridezillas,fdm0lck,t1_fdkv5r9,1578536964.0,"I was a bridesmaid for my then bf (now husband) sister.  I’ve also been to weddings where the SIL was a bridesmaid. I’ve seen where they haven’t, but that’s when the groom doesn’t get along with his sister."
AmItheAsshole,fdl09qe,t1_fdkbf3z,1578514769.0,"This!!!!!! 

I was looking to see if anyone mentioned having the baby. I can tell you from experience that having a small child makes everything else take a back seat. It’s easy to forget trivial things that don’t have a bearing on your every day life.

Edit- obviously NTA"
NatureIsFuckingLit,fcy1zqv,t1_fcxzpaj,1578073675.0,"I don’t know if that’s the same story, but that’s awesome. 

The one I know they only found out when they found the mauled bodies with rifles and an axe to cut off the horn. They definitely got what they deserved."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fcxyfpu,t1_fcxs8hz,1578072209.0,I loved the story about the rhino poachers who were killed and eaten by lions.
memes,fcvwcdh,t3_ej2dzz,1578011578.0,Only if they’re an immortal highlander.
memes,fcteg6h,t3_eiro8h,1577940651.0,That’s exactly how I described him to my husband. Superman in a Legolas wig
BadMUAs,fcc1bns,t1_fcauv71,1577593293.0,She should definitely not look 20. But I watched the movie and they definitely didn’t do her any favors.
instantkarma,fc8z5ru,t1_fc8xo08,1577544442.0,"There are strollers with suspension, all terrain tires, really easy to push, and a lot more bells and whistles. You can spend a couple grand on a nice stroller. Not to mention all the accessories."
TalesFromYourServer,fc7glfe,t1_fc7fdeb,1577506811.0,A lawnmower parent is one that “mows” down their kids challenges and struggles. Basically doesn’t want them to ever struggle and learn a lesson themselves.
BadMUAs,fbziwgn,t1_fbzgt4h,1577248211.0,That’s what I was thinking!
Instagramreality,fbz22vh,t3_ef51g8,1577232753.0,It is so bad! At least it’s against a solid background tho.
aww,fbww17q,t3_eeolp1,1577160963.0,"My cat did the same. He was cuddly before, but it was extreme while I was pregnant. He’s great with my toddlers"
BadMUAs,fbmaw47,t3_edw1ij,1576981076.0,The visible line between the lashes and the eyeliner tho
