I found out at like 7 that wasn’t the case and went on a swear word tirade that would make a sailor blush. My parents heard and my pops let me have it. He’s like, “why are you talking like that?!” I told him you don’t go to hell if you swear and he’s like, wtf are you talking about... haha"

cookingforbeginners,fdhr2fp,t3_eld5xo,1578428502.0,"Someone gaining weight needs to be in calorie surplus. If you REALLY want to gain weight, start to track your calories. Track them pretty accurately for the past week or so. Average that out and have that be your “standard” 

As a young person who is naturally thin, you may have to up your calorie amount by 500+ a day. Like people have mentioned, you don’t want this to be an excuse to eat pure trash. But at your age and just knowing your likely body type, having a calorie goal of 3000+ isn’t a bad idea. 

Calories can be tough to gain in that amount, so I suggest high carb foods like white rice, mashed potatoes, etc. That can be made in advanced and heated up. Also, high fat/protein foods are good. 

As for meats, grilled chicken thighs are great. In your position you can also cook up ground beef as well. I used to eat ground beef seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, and onion powder and add that to mashed potatoes. 

An easy way to gain extra calories too would be to wake up and have a protein shake every morning. 1 scoop of protein/12 oz 1% milk would be an easy 300+ calories. 

I was an ex division one/professional athlete, so I am coming at this more from a pure body comp standpoint. But idk if that helps. I would check out bodybuilding.com or other similar sites as well."

KansasCityChiefs,fd2vmk8,t1_fcydlef,1578152074.0,"Yeah, that upsets me too. Kelce is perfect for this team and our offense, just like Kittle is for his offense. Kelce isn’t asked to block as much bc he moves around the field so much and is asked to do a lot, like being in the slot, etc. 

The narrative that Kittle is WAY better is crazy. Kelce is the best tight end for our offense, and he puts up great numbers because of it. Why is he punished for that?"

baseball,fc5z30u,t3_eg7rhu,1577468816.0,"Great guy, Kirby. I never met him myself, but my dad was the GM for the A level twins in the 80s and Kirby was on the team. He was special. 

My dad said his first interaction with him was early in the year, right when they got assigned. He goes us to my dad and the owner and is like, “umm, sir. I need to ask you a question/show you something and hope you can help me out...” my dads all worried, like, what the heck is this guy about to show me. Kirby hands my dad his signing bonus check. 

The twins were notoriously cheap, but they thought highly of Kirby and I think it was their highest signing bonus offer at the time. I think if I remember my dad said it was like 20K, but I don’t remember. 

So, Kirby had been holding his signing bonus check under his mattress bc he didn’t have a bank account and didn’t trust anyone around him to help him out. So he shows my dad and the owner and they take him to a bank to set up a bank account and to deposit his check. 

Kirby was always nice to everyone in my family. Even held my sister when she was a newborn, in his glove on the bus. Idk if they have a photo of that. We still have his old A ball jersey with his name on the inside of the pants. My dad always said he was one of the nicest guys and probably the one guy who could take over a game/series and win it himself."
