dogpictures,fc6qzba,t1_fc6pj7t,1577487252.0,"Thank you!!! Yes, it was just like BANG!  We went in on Christmas night as an emergency, they were draining her heart in minutes.  They kept her over night but her heart and belly just filled right back up.  They stabilized her to go home and she was gone 4pm, less than 24 hours. I'm just in shock; we weren't ready at all and it was both mine and my 15 year old son's first time watching a pup go to sleep on top of it.  Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words :)"

dogpictures,fc5x211,t1_fc5v5kd,1577467697.0,"We brought her home from her overnight stay at the vet; I insisted on stabilizing her so she could fall asleep in the home she loved.  She climbed out of the car and I swear she knew.  She went to the top of her yard and did her last guard, we all came outside and watched and cried.  It was a very intimate, emotional moment indeed kind stranger.  I will share :)"

dogpictures,fc5jh1c,t3_eg5vmp,1577459278.0,"Thank you all so much!!  We lost her to sudden acute symptoms to hemangiosarcoma, she was 8 years old.  Kaya came from a rescue where her previous owner kept her locked in a crate most of the day.  We, along with our other pup, taught her how to be a dog, how to love people, and she loved to do her job and guard her people until the very end.  We will miss all her silly positions she laid in, her love for an open window in the car, her throwing tennis balls around for herself, her floppy skin, and even her bark, her drool and white hair everywhere.  We are crushed and all your responses are truly heartwarming.  <3"
