SuicideWatch,ff3j830,t3_ere7rm,1579542204.0,"let's just get one thing clear... you did NOT make your boyfriend rape you. 

friendships come and go, and sometimes relationships don't work out. that's okay. especially in your first relationship ever, it's okay to not know exactly what you're doing. no one knows exactly what they're doing, some people are just better at making shit up as they go. 

classes become irrelevant eventually, and passing all but one of your classes every single year is doing great!

why do you think your dnd group would still meet up if they're bored with your sessions? that shit is hard, and if you don't like doing it anymore, force (with cookies) someone else to do it. 

go and be glorious darling xx

side note: I really did think you were paraphrasing the intro to mcr's song I'm not okay for a good long while
