samoyeds,fcyumex,t3_ejekad,1578087432.0,"If he's walking, running and playing normally and you can squeeze and move his legs around without any reaction, he's probably fine. You could take him to the vet to be safe, but it doesn't seem like it's an emergency or an issue"
samoyeds,fcyu8jy,t3_ejjua0,1578087194.0,"We tried the yelping in pain thing but she didn't get it. We tried redirecting her to a toy but she didn't get it and it's hard to always have a toy around when she started. What worked for us was walking to another room and ignoring her for a few seconds. If that's not possible, turn around and ignore your pup. Hang in there! When my puppy was teething I worried it would last forever and she would always be biting. But it gets better!"
dogs,fcwrve3,t3_ej73xa,1578035114.0,"Generally a female and male dog is the safest combination, especially for breeds prone to same sex aggression. But it's ultimately up to the individual dog and you know Emma best."
dogs,fcwrls7,t3_ej7v6j,1578034822.0,"As other people have said, you're better off with a good alarm system and guns to deter criminals. Dogs can't be (and shouldn't be) relied on to make decisions on who they can attack based on some sort of magic intuition. And if someone truly meant harm, a dog is useless, they could just shoot it. Most people will be deterred by cameras, an alarm system, barking dog â€“ the vast majority of criminals will find easier houses to target. Aggressive dogs are also a massive liability, require constant management and can take over your life. What if they bite your family or friends? Dogs are a 10+ year commitment. What if you have kids and they're not safe? Or what if your kids can't have friends over? 

You could opt for a professionally trained protection dog... but those cost literally tens of thousands of dollars and are overkill for the vast majority of situations. What most people actually need when they say 'guard dog' is a big intimidating dog that barks a lot when someone first comes over, but is actually friendly. There are lots of trainable and friendly dogs that have ""some sort of initial shock value when you first see it"" like a Newfoundland, St. Bernard, Leonberger and even a black Lab.

You should fill out this sub's breed questionnaire for suggestions based on more detailed factors like how much exercise you can give it, grooming, shedding/barking/drooling tolerance, etc."
dogs,fcpki7q,t3_eidu9c,1577866338.0,"Where do you live? Are kennels popular where you are? I've noticed that many dog owners, young owners in particular, myself included, don't (and would never) use traditional kennels if they need someone to watch their dog. They use apps like Rover or find people in local dog Facebook groups so their dog can live inside someone's home, have free roam and get a lot more social interaction and stimulation. I personally would never use a kennel, I'd find someone with breed experience who is home most of the day and maybe has a playful dog, so my dog can live inside a home, get lots of affection and playtime and be taken to fun places.

Are you passionate about dogs? Do you have extensive experience with dogs?  Are you certified in pet first aid? You don't mention what experience and qualifications you have. What I'm getting from your post is that you're looking at it from basically just a logistics and financial perspective, that's missing some considerations.

 Where would they spend most of the day: in the kennel (cruel) or roaming your property? Because there will likely be damage, digging, pee stains, poop, injured wildlife and etc to contend with. How would you even monitor 5-10 dogs over so many acres? Plus you may not be able to use your property for commercial purposes, at least not legally. In which case, you'd have to unofficially run a kennel for 5-10 dogs, likely without insurance. Like boarding one dog at a time in your home is one thing, but 5-10 simulteanously is a whole other level. Potential customers would probably be really wary especially if there's a lot of competition in your area.

During the day when the dogs should be out, someone would need to be monitoring them constantly in case of injuries and emergencies. You'd have to hire someone or do it yourself. That doesn't sound like a peaceful retirement to me, just another job. How will you ensure that the dogs boarded at the same time are compatible or friendly? Are you familiar with dog language? What if there's a fight?

If you don't have significant dog experience, aren't insured because your property isn't zoned for commercial purposes, aren't going to closely monitor the dogs for at least the whole day (and ideally at night too ju  tin case), etc, then $50/day is too high since customers could just go to legit daycares and kennels.

That's a lot of stress for a retirement. Basically, there are  passive income sources that are a lot less risky and labour intensive."
popheads,fcnmqln,t1_fcncujz,1577814440.0,"What, like Tidal? lol

[When she signed her new record deal, she demanded the label increase their Spotify payments to their other artists](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-universal-republic-deal-spotify-758102/). She fought for both [Apple Music](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33220189) and [Spotify](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-fought-spotify-for-a-huge-win-for-all-musicians.html/) to increase how much they pay artists. She's critical of the industry and advocates for artists owning their work in ways literally the vast majority of celebs either don't have the power or motivation/courage to speak up on. I love Beyonce but she's not as active on these issues. Stop comparing these two successful strong women. No one even brought Beyonce up in this discussion."
dogs,fcjiofi,t3_ehgzmr,1577689086.0,"In one year you never even leashed her? And didn't bother with basic training? Your family failed this dog. And most German Shepherds are so intelligent, handler focused and trainable ):

If you want to keep her, you need to start with the very basics of training. You'd have to be very patient and understanding.  If you can get a professional trainer that would be helpful, but if not, there are positive reinforcement training resources online like [https://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21/videos).

But if your parents really don't want this dog anymore, you will need to rehome. Surrender her to an animal shelter, rescue or even better, a breed specific rescue. You can Google to see if there are any in your area. [Don't just abandon her somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3gvb0l/vent_take_your_unwanted_dog_to_a_shelter_if_you/)."
dogs,fcan2f3,t3_egqv40,1577572515.0,I completed it! Good luck with your thesis (and excellent topic choice) :)
puppy101,fc7fano,t3_egj4sk,1577505698.0,"I agree with the other comments. I'd also add that you need to start teaching your puppy leash loose walking ASAP. Even start inside your house. My current dog is my first dog and I let her get away with pulling as a puppy because I didn't think it was a big deal since she was small (and stopping everytime she pulled was inconvenient)... but now she's big and training her out of pulling is tough. She's better but I'm not sure she'll ever be perfect. It's better to be consistent about how you want them to walk instead of training out bad habits later on.

If you have the time, use your dog's food to train or reinforce the behaviours you want. Or put it in puzzle toys. Basically make them work for their food (the no free lunch philosophy). Tbh I've just been feeding my dog from a bowl lately, but making them look or work for their food mentally stimulates them and keeps them busy. And you don't have to give them as many treats.

I know a border collie x labrador mix... and he's a total maniac with so much pent up energy (he is very sweet and friendly though). Reward and praise your dog when they're calm so they learn being chill is a good thing. Look up capturing calmness. And mental stimulation  tires out your dog way more than physical exercise will. There's a canine enrichment Facebook group that has cheap homemade ideas."
dogs,fc5llyp,t3_egbn40,1577460855.0,"The notion that you can only get a dog if you have $10K in a savings account just for them is very elitist and gatekeepy. But if you don't have that money, it's important to be honest  about the max amount you would spend on them, and consider whether you could pay that amount. And if not, how you would get it: insurance (not worth it in most cases, but it is a gamble), loans, etc.

But people  should have enough for the basics like food and preventive. There are ways to get your dog affordable preventive care in my city ( discounted spay/neuteur programs, shots, microchipping)."
dogs,fc5jru7,t3_egc3kk,1577459506.0,"Huskies would be a bad fit because 'probably' an hour walk may not be enough, they're very unreliable off leash, considered escape artists and have a high prey drive so they would likely go after the rabbits. I don't have any personal experience with Australian Shepherds so won't comment on that.

This is cliche, but a golden or labrador retriever would be a perfect fit. There's a reason they're so popular: good with children, trainable, affectionate and friendly. If you plan on getting a puppy, keep in mind that they're a lot of work, like having a second child. And puppies go through a teething phase where they'll bite you and you need to teach them bite inhibition. IMO 1-2 years old is too young to get a dog. I'd wait at least a few more so you could teach your son how to interact with the dog, where to pet it and when to leave it alone."
