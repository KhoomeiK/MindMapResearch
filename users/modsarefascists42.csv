At least with Medicare for All it would be everyone in the country affected, whereas now it's easy for the average American to ignore the broken VA because they very likely aren't soldiers (that 3% remember). With M4A being for everyone then any problems in it will cause massive backlash.

Every other major country has a government ran version like this, there is a good reason for that. It's far cheaper, by almost half compared to what we have now. Either it's ran by the government or it's ran by profit making companies who will deny you care for no reason other than costs. We spend so much money on the military to what, keep us safe? Well how come we can't spend anything near that keeping us safe from actual dangers like diseases or broken bones. Those are a hell of a lot more dangerous to most of us than any Iraqi ever was."

WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ff20ext,t1_ff03wih,1579490481.0,"The impact of pet cats is actually pretty small, as long as they're spayed or neutered that is. It's feral cats that are a slight problem, but even they aren't a huge issue unless if you live on an island.

There are these little bib looking things if you really want. They prevent cats from killing birds."
funny,ff1z7u3,t3_eqye5o,1579489614.0,Anyone else think this is an ad? The names brand is very very very very very obvious. Maybe I'm being paranoid but I don't think so.
politics,ff1y6l8,t1_ff1oh2g,1579488888.0,Yes because saying sexism exist is the exact thing as being sexist. You're so fucking smart!
bigboye,ff1wnmu,t1_ff10oj9,1579487873.0,"Yep that's a big male, he probably beats the fuck out of any that try to take his spot."
Games,ff1w4wr,t1_fezvk0f,1579487525.0,Lol moonlight game streaming has had much more than that for years. It basically turns your phone into a Nvidia shield and let's you stream games from your computer. Best over WiFi but possible everywhere if your home connection is good. Of course the Nvidia shield can do that too with less set up.
trees,ff1qxoq,t1_feyhoko,1579484223.0,"Hey it's nice looking in some small parts. Long as an alligator doesn't jump up and eat you, or worse a methed-out Floridian jumps out to eat you."
MMORPG,ff1n4sa,t1_feyevf4,1579481941.0,"The people who pvp don't need incentives. They'll do it regardless. If you'd looked into these games you'd know that. The pve people don't have to learn pvp, they can do what they regularly do but group up to provide protection. It's really not that complicated of an idea. If you want a game with no competition, no combat that you can possibly lose, then go play Mario or any other kids game. There's a million of them. Stop trying to ruin every single game that dares to design for what players actually enjoy instead of what crybabies who lost once say."
