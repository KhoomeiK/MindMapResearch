forza,ff9k6b0,t3_es9pib,1579714733.0,It always amazes me how poorly Microsoft programs work on their own OS. I couldn't link my PC Profile to my Microsoft account for three years because of some weird bug that only went away after I reinstalled Windows. Couldn't even install free programs off of the store because of it. You'd think that their games for PC would be well optimized and relatively conflict free in regards to software compatibility.

worldnews,fcup91h,t1_fculzeg,1577985758.0,There's a sweet spot for aircraft where they're old enough for you to know they're reliable and new enough to not be falling apart. A fleet of older reliable choppers that the pilots feel comfortable flying is likely safer than a fleet of brand new choppers with unfamiliar systems.

That was also an article shared on CTV a few weeks ago so I assumed it was the same one when I saw the source. It's still stupid to have a bunch of cameras around your house connected to the internet. Unless you're on top of your cyber security anyone motivated enough will be able to access them. And most people who buy these cameras do absolutely nothing to protect their network. My friend has a CS degree and likes to show us just how easy it is for people to access your devices through your network. Took him about ten seconds to access my neighbours doorbell camera. Do not put this shit in your home, closed circuit cameras are the way to go. Or just don't bother with cameras at all since it's a house and not Fort Knox.

Edit: Fucking autocorrect choosing the wrong words again."
