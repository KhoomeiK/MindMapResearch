hint: including one of my friends WHO WOULD BE DEAD IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE INSURANCE SHE GOT FROM THE ACA

let me repeat, in case i stuttered: **Stop being a naive fanatical purist to the detriment of the people who DIE because of your choice to feel smugly superior**"

technology,feoxzky,t1_feow6xm,1579307827.0,"Because every accusation of wrong doing on the part of the DNC I see turns out to be bullshit.  Take the full emails debacle for example - yeah it showed that a bunch of the internal staffers were annoyed with bernie *after it became mathematically implausible for him to win the nomination* and they suggested bad things.  Guess what? leadership said no to every one of those things.

The DNC reduced superdelegates in response to the criticism on that subject, and are discussing making ways to make participation in the primaries even easier.

The DNC literally cannot rig the primaries as many people contend they did (they don't have the logistical capability)

The reason I can say it with a straight face is because i'm not a political newbie with little to zero knowledge of the process."
