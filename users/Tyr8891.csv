""We collected more than 1.4 million fraud reports, and people said they lost money to the fraud in 25% of those reports. People reported losing $1.48 billion (with a ‘b’) to fraud last year – an increase of 38% over 2017.""

https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/02/top-frauds-2018

""The researchers estimated that the average loss per worker over the course of a year was $2,634, out of total earnings of $17,616. The total annual wage theft from front-line workers in low-wage industries in the three cities approached $3 billion. If these findings in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are generalizable to the rest of the U.S. low-wage workforce of 30 million, wage theft is costing workers more than $50 billion a year.""

You cannot steal your own labor from a business. The business is paying you for your time, your time that you could be spending elsewhere doing literally anything else. If you have a specific task to perform while being paid for your time, if you are not efficient or refuse to perform the agreed upon task, and the employer decides your time is not worth the pay you receive they can then fire you.

To answer your very odd and somewhat aggresive question, no. Men are victims generally at much lower rates than women when it comes to sexual violence. Combined with the stigma that men always enjoy sex no matter the situation, and the fact that there are people who argue men cannot be raped, and you have an issue that can lead to rapes not being taken seriously or not reported. 

So no, it is not easier for one sex to report rape.

worldnews,fdfqf4o,t1_fdfovgt,1578367713.0,"""The NEW STANDARD PRESS is an online news and opinion magazine. It differs from ordinary news media in the following ways. The goal is to publish news analysis articles about topics that lack evidence-based analysis in other news sources. Too often reporters simply don’t have the time or interest to fairly analyze an event, but instead rush to write what are essentially arbitrary opinion pieces.  The NEW STANDARD PRESS is not part of the constant 24-hour news cycle, which feeds itself with quick reactions to trivia, speculation and predictions. Instead, it gives supplementary content that helps to understand what the mainstream media omits.
The NEW STANDARD PRESS is nonpartisan. Contrary to other news analysis magazines, we do not mean to insinuate anything. We reject all code words, “dog whistles,” subliminal messaging, etc. If something is not overtly stated by an author, then the author or NEW STANDARD PRESS do not mean to suggest or imply it. Accordingly, some of our articles show how news commentators misinterpret statements in awful ways by “reading between the lines.” Our authors are welcome to state their views frankly, but are encouraged to focus on evidence and analysis. The views voiced by any one author do not necessarily match the views of the NEW STANDARD PRESS.
Much of the content about Trump and the elections will eventually be part of a book, titled: [The Media Versus the Apprentice](http://www.newstandardpress.com/the-media-versus-the-apprentice/), by Alberto A.
