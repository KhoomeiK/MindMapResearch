funny,ffbghxd,t3_eslr6y,1579764253.0,My soon to be ex-husband never gave a damn about clean towels.. or anything else.. I actually envy this woman.
WhyWomenLiveLonger,ffaolgg,t3_erv0c3,1579740841.0,"Nice lion and all, but damn that man is good looking!"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff7zpnx,t3_es29w1,1579662240.0,"She just doesn't even try to NOT get run over. I mean, I'm a lady in my fifties and you better believe I'd be jumping up on the hood."
YouShouldKnow,ff7wtxx,t3_erx82t,1579660243.0,"Oh great! Another task to try and figure out how to do all by myself. Add to the list of leaking roof, broken porch light, broken kitchen tiles, doorknobs needing replaced, broken shower door, etc etc... Soon to be ex-husband doesn't do anything but ruin everything. Thanks for the information though."
todayilearned,ff7k9df,t3_erwr9l,1579651535.0,That just annoys me. She's no miracle. He must have been ready to make the change. No one's ultimatum is going to save someone. Don't you think others have given him ultimatums before? Anyone out there who thinks they can make someone stop using... don't be fooled.
nextfuckinglevel,ff7j81a,t1_ff67041,1579650828.0,"He could get hurt and then need TWO wheelchairs, though."
Zoomies,ff7i1w3,t3_ervmzm,1579650037.0,She is precious! What a cute personality ❤️Glad to see you have rugs on the floor for her to get traction.

AskReddit,fep4c6h,t3_eq1wzh,1579311844.0,"If I could get enough money to be able to divorce my husband and still keep my house and live.. or sell our house and have enough to get another home and live. I am disabled and have no income. I spent my youth raising our kids, then caring for him when he became sick. He is mentally ill and abusive."
AskReddit,fdi57w0,t3_elbejj,1578435944.0,"""Such is life.""  My MIL says it all the time and it makes me furious.."
AskReddit,fdi3zum,t3_eled64,1578435328.0,"People getting a huge number of downvotes just because they misunderstood a question when it's OBVIOUS that's why their answer was weird. If you can see that they just were confused, give em a break. I mean, their weird response isn't hurting anything."
oddlysatisfying,fdi2tai,t3_elcvg7,1578434720.0,Better hope that outside piece doesn't fall off and clock someone on the head down on the street.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fd0vqj5,t1_fczvj3a,1578124407.0,Happy Cake Day!
Zoomies,fd02ma4,t1_fczy0lh,1578112723.0,Hope that's the case for him. My dog is small and his tooth got stuck in someone's pant leg. They yanked their leg and my dog cried. It sucked.
aww,fd00192,t3_ejq36w,1578111575.0,Please feed him his bottles of milk and never ever eat him!
Zoomies,fczjcm0,t3_ejk57q,1578102511.0,"Oh hey, make sure to show the vet the broken tooth. It's likely that there is still part of it under the gums, which could lead to decay and infection..and pain. That happened to my dog and the vet had to remove the root. He did it while my dog was under anesthesia for something else, so we had his teeth cleaned at the same time. Your dog is ridiculously cute! Glad he's having fun in Mexico!"
