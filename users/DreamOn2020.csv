Scams,ffegyao,t3_et5nqv,1579847593.0,"Did she provide a telephone number in her signature that you can call or do a reverse lookup for? Real recruiters WANT to make it easy for you to get in touch with them so if that doesn’t pan out, it’s a scam. Seems odd to me that since you actually applied for the job, she’s asking what number she can reach you at. I know I always provide that information when applying for jobs so it’s a red flag that she’s not saying something like “can I still reach you at 555-555-5555” or whatever. Or she’s just lazy! The email seems pretty generalized and not really customized to you, except your name.

EDIT: subject line seems iffy as well...wtf is a phone screen invitation?"

Scams,ffafet6,t3_esiebq,1579734464.0,"OP, a rental scam goes something like this: scammer finds an empty house that is in foreclosure, lists it for rent (that is what he’s asking you to do), takes and keeps deposits from potential renters, takes and keeps actual rent from renters, then scammer skedaddles. You don’t get paid and even worse, renters lose their money and are evicted after foreclosure goes into effect. Your IP address may be logged and traceable, as you were the one posting the ad, not the scammer."

Scams,fdlengb,t3_elsv3n,1578522391.0,"A similar thing happened to my elderly mother. One day, not too long ago, she begged me to take her to the bank to withdraw some money but refused to answer any questions, said she had promised someone not to say anything. We were halfway to the bank when I pulled over and demanded she tell me what’s going on. Turns out she had gotten a phone call from someone claiming to be my ex-husband and that he was in jail and needed bail money. It’s a long story but I convinced her it was a scam and of course it was. He was very thankful that my mom was ready to shell out thousands for his release after all these years (we’ve been divorced since 2000). I wasn’t as thrilled lol"

WagWalker,fdih0vl,t3_e82vzf,1578442721.0,I regularly walked a short robust Pomeranian that has a step in harness. On our last walk the harness ended up slipping around the middle of his body and off his rear end...twice. A 20min walk always turns into over 30mins and we don’t get very far! I’ve stopped accepting those walks.

WagWalker,fdic6n3,t1_fdibwed,1578439607.0,It was definitely more of a work out than usual! The beagle was the hardest to control but the chihuahua is small and the other dog is senior so it all balanced out. I tried to keep the leashes from tangling for the first 10 mins then just let it go and it all worked out 😀
