We  just saw the reception as a big party - We had it in the private bar I worked at and just made it open-invitation for anyone we knew.

It was such a lovely, *relaxed* day spent with the people we care about. To this day, I'll get random people who sort of just happened to be there come up to me and tell me what a great evening they had.

 Do you think that it might be better to have a real heart-to-heart with him rather than just laying down the law? Explain to him, no holds barred, how this emotionally affects you. Do you think he might be able to talk to his son about this? Ask the son to make an effort in the coming months followed up with some zero-tolerance rules for being in your home?

It's one thing being in the room during your own daughter's labour but to *expect* any other woman to let you be in there is, frankly, ridiculously selfish and entitled.


Technically, you didn't kick him out. The nurse saw how upset you were and did what she thought best for you. Tell him to take it up with her! :D

I worked in a local for a long time and, here, the good pubs are a community....a sort of family. I know plenty of people who barely even drink, they just go to socialise. Obviously it's not for everyone and if it is, you've still got to find your place, but now you know :)"
