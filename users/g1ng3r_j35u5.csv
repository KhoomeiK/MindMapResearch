NatureIsFuckingLit,ffa394i,t3_esfsjx,1579727007.0,"Ima give a big Thankyou to whoever saved that cutie. Usually their domestication is not at all a good thing considering what they’re used for, and it’s a terrible thing that they kill such beautiful creatures for it. But, in the end, it’s good to see those who care and go out of their way to save these guys from evil people."
ecology,ff2z0by,t3_erbdqg,1579529122.0,"I don’t think that capitalism is the problem as much as the system that runs it. Everybody tries to become something of value by becoming something of success, meanwhile it should be vise versa. While the small few become major successes, everyone looks up to them and worships them, ergo celebrities. People need to start doing what they want to do in life instead of what someone else wants them to do, people should become successful in their own ways and take advantage of the celebrity system by becoming successful through value.

Also, our economy runs heavily on consumerism, which companies care less about how long their product will last and more about its quality, just so people buy it again and again each time after it breaks. We take too much for granted and rely on single-use items far too much like snack wrappers, bottled beverages, plastic pill containers, and especially bags for groceries or snacks. 

Another thing- stop relying on China for offshore manufacturing. It may be cheaper labor, but it eliminates our own middle class while allowing them to topple over the west. China is an extreme oceanic and atmospheric polluter, generating more that 8 million tons of plastic to put into the sea each year. The more power they get, the less power we get. The more power they get? Is more pollution. 

In conclusion, of this new coming generation, we need to change our cultural ways of perceiving the economy and stop living illogically, irrationally, and automatically. We don’t focus on being what we want to be outside of get an education, go to college, get a job, retire and die. All the while eating and eating and eating whatever advertisers feed us. We need to live how we want to live. We are humans, we aren’t cattle being driven to what we want to eat the most, we have come so far yet society has brought us so far back. Let’s change that."
ScienceLaboratory,fewjlob,t1_fet1ly2,1579411952.0,"I completely agree. Meat used to be a once in a while thing in the last couple centuries. People still lived then so why can’t we live like that again? Besides, we could feed another 11 billion people with what we feed livestock."

foxes,fehmm96,t1_feggekf,1579119616.0,"Thanks for being conscientious about the topic, sometimes pictures and videos may seem cute but the situations not at all.  Luckily, a link in one of the comments below reveals that she was a fur farm rescue, and information to her insta account"

Awwducational,fdiqsv8,t1_fdi795o,1578448965.0,"I agree, but at the same time there’s no recovery if they’re being rapidly killed for fur, which is the reality of the situation and the cause of their breeding"

Awwducational,fdi2nnh,t1_fdfcbw4,1578434646.0,"I read it, and i don’t think that 150 chinchillas are worth a stupid coat, nevertheless one."
enviroaction,fd3llr3,t1_fd3ht0i,1578159499.0,That’s why I’m heavily against the fur industry. Most people would probably not be advocates for a business that runs on abusing and torturing other organisms. If only more knew.
enviroaction,fd3cof7,t1_fd2ld7o,1578156920.0,"I still believe we have the same goals here, fashion should be looked down upon at any instance it transgresses against any organism. Fast and disposable clothing is terrible due to material wasting and pollution, and therefore more possibly causing harm. Yet, let us not forget that injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere, and only when we band together to protest the universal betrayal of conscience for profit or appearance, we will all be able to succeed together."
foxes,fd20cj1,t3_ejv7zm,1578139676.0,Now that’s a cute white fluff
enviroaction,fd1xukw,t1_fczpof7,1578138519.0,"I understand that but to me it is a moral issue. It contributes to the carelessness that many have to conscience and the physical, mental, and emotional health of other beings in exchange for money and “fashion”.  Also, even if some places in China are doing humane slaughter, there are still facilities that disobey those laws and treat animals how they wish despite if it is lawful or morally correct. To me, fur is part of the culture of carelessness, robbing the voiceless of their natural rights to life, and should be stopped."
enviroaction,fcyt2zy,t3_ejl8l4,1578086483.0,"I’m not sure if anyone else thinks or feels how strongly I do especially, but fur NEEDS to come down. Apologies if this may be depressing, but Fur “Farms”, suppliers of fur companies, are terrible places. There is no remorse or care for animals whatsoever, as many will be locked in small cages for their entire small lives. most will be mentally emotionally and physically abused, and age has no factor in slaughter dates. If you want proof for yourselves, simply look up fur farms on the internet. TruthAboutFur.org is a website that endorses the trade, yet somewhat openly boasts about how they treat their animals. What they believe is justified and the methods they use to justify them are ironically yet expectedly lies, or downright illogical. Proven  with evidence that can be found on other anti-fur websites such as a large anti-fur organization, OpenCages, or just good old common sense coming from a sane individual."

WolvesAreBigYo,fcn2um5,t3_eht35n,1577801718.0,"I hope that’s at a conservancy or sanctuary or something, and also that it’s not a wolf dog. I’ve been to a wolf sanctuary in Pennsylvania before and they’ve said that wolf dogs aren’t that great mentally and emotionally."
TheBullWins,fckerwz,t3_ehdufy,1577723709.0,"I love to hear all their little screams when their human gets attacked, so ironic when they cheer when the bull gets attacked and killed."
