I'm not too lazy to run numbers. I see it literally every single day. I've ""run the numbers"" more times than you can count. For people in all kinds of situations. 

You think trade versus private sale is 15-20% across the board? You are sorely mistaken. For most who are looking to trade in a car, its a few *hundred*, not thousands difference, especially if you factor in the associated costs, yes, including time. 

I don't know about you, but a few hundred dollars with a car purchase and sale is pretty much nothing to me. I'd rather spend my time doing other things than advertising, meeting with potential buyers (most don't actually buy), etc. It takes significantly more time than you'd think. 

But again, it's all about how *you* value your time and your money."
povertyfinance,fektaou,t1_fekngo8,1579207155.0,"I wasn't talking about getting out of poverty. I was talking in general. It was stated that you didn't know why ""anyone"" would trade in a car, not just people in poverty.

Your second paragraph is very subjective. It may not be worth it to *you* but may be worth it to someone else.

Time is valuable, and it's the one thing you can *never* get back. So depending on your perspective and the value you place on money and time determines whether a trade is a good ""deal"" for you.

Another point made was the risk involved. If you need a newer car relatively quickly, a trade might be worth it to you. 

Unless you have another car already, odds are you will continue to drive the car while it's listed. Depending on how much you drive and how long the car is listed, this will end up costing you, by lowering the value of the car. 

If you get in an accident or something goes wrong, you could be out a car and any potential money from a sale.

Not one of those reasons for preferring a trade says ""lazy person"" to me.

Every decision is made by a cost/risk analysis that is highly personalized."
povertyfinance,feklz4h,t1_fekj9d6,1579202818.0,"Trade in isn't a horrible value, it just depends on what you're looking for.

If you want the most money from your car, sell it yourself. But you have to do all of the work, listing, advertising, cleaning, sitting on it for a while if it doesn't sell fast, possibility of an accident or other damage, etc.

If you don't want that hassle, you take less money but you wash your hands of it after that. You're essentially paying for the dealership to sell it and take on all associated risks, for you.

So not an inherently bad deal, it just depends on what you value (or can afford to value) more: money or ease."

Parenting,fckasd0,t3_eha5hv,1577721089.0,"Most of it is luck, schedule, and outsourcing.

I don't work, but I am a full-time student.

I have an easy, mild mannered toddler.

We run on a flexible but strict schedule. I have x time to complete y task. Doesn't have to be a specific time (usually) but it has to be done.

I stay up late and start my days early. 

When I'm not in school, I plan for when I am. I meal plan months in advance. Order groceries online to save time. Food prep weekly, down to snacks. 

We are considering hiring someone to clean once a week and purchasing a roomba. 

This one took me a long time to get on board with, but if you have help available, take it. I use mine in the form of my inlaws taking my daughter for one day every other week. Unless I have something pressing to do, I won't do any work during this time. No homework, cleaning, nothing. Just relax at home or do something (like go shopping) by myself. 

We also live in an apartment over buying a house for a variety of reasons, but the biggest for us was no maintenance. No yard to take care of or fence that needs fixing. If something breaks, it's not even a phone call. It's two clicks on an app. This save a lot more time than you'd think. 

That being said, I do prioritize other things as well. Going to the zoo with my daughter is more important than dishes or vacuuming. And while on the outside it may seem like everything is in order, it's can be stressful and there's definitely days where I'm exhausted and have no patience at the end of the day.

news,fbur2qs,t1_fbujz7f,1577119009.0,"Yeah, well unfortunately it's becoming less and less common. 

Initially it began as a way to extend physicians in areas with limited resources--rural, low income, etc.

Somewhere down the line midlevels lost sight of their purpose, and began to (incorrectly) believe they were equivalents to physicans. They realized they could make six figures with comparatively very little schooling (some have as little as 500 clinical hours and CRNA and NP programs can be done almost entirely online).

In addition, hospitals and surgical centers (like the one in the article) noted that CRNAs are much cheaper to employ (for good reason--less training) and started hiring more and more as cost cutting measures. 

All of this is culminating in CRNAs and other midlevels, like NPs, to fight for independence from physicians, which was previously a requirement.

Patient care suffers. Physicians, who spend decades pursuing higher education, suffer. And big hospitals and those who skip steps for the sake of money and ease win.

For the record, I am not anti midlevel. They have their place in medicine, but this is not it."
