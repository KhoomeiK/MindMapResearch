If your classroom is disinfected/sanitized properly and your class is washing their hands with soap and water, not wipes or hand sanitizer itâ€™ll decrease your risk of getting sick so often.

I like John lovetts quote, â€˜ A report of a report of a meeting in which thereâ€™s only one thing we know for certain: That two people who met promised not to attack each other out of mutual admiration and sense of common purposeâ€™ talking about the meetings 

Letâ€™s not forget about the Bernie volunteer canvasser script that surfaced smearing Elizabeth Warren. 

We should stop dividing liberals and Democrats if we want a progressive in the White House. We are currently just clearing the way for Biden. I wish Bernie supports had that some common purpose Bernie and EW agreed upon. 

My only hesitation of being all in as a Bernie supporter is how unwelcoming and exclusive his supporters have treated me, at least IRL. I appreciate the civility Iâ€™ve had on this thread and the conversations Iâ€™ve had with you all. But that tone is not something I wanna be associated with and idk how to process that.

Have you had any luck with training a â€˜no barkâ€™ command? Do you think that would be a good idea? If shes already barking Iâ€™m not sure I can get her attention back on me

Dogtraining,fdrelrd,t3_emvh2j,1578683458.0,Walks are challenging where I live because thereâ€™s a bunch of backyard dogs that are also extremely reactive and most dogs we pass on walks are also reactive and lunge toward us. It seems really difficult to have positive dog interactions out on walks. I feel bad that Iâ€™m asking my dog to ignore another dog that is lunging and barking at her. It seems like Iâ€™m asking a lot. We walk around the dog park sometimes and that seems pretty good as thereâ€™s about 50 feet between where we can walk and the dog park.
