It depends and where you are in the country, but private hospitals in the UK aren't nearly as full as the public ones for obvious reasons, so the wait times are much less.

For example, I had a liver infection that caused my spleen to just about double in size. After I recovered, my GP referred me for an ultrasound to check my spleen. I had no actual symptoms, it was purely precautionary. Wait time at an NHS hospital was about two months, and at a private hospital it was less than two weeks.

gifs,feg12v2,t1_fef42wz,1579072402.0,"A lot of it I think is to do with restaurant culture. 

In a nice French restaurant, the waiter will not come to check that you're ok or bother you by asking if you need anything; it's seen as discourteous to interrupt you. Certainly they would never dream of proactively refilling your wine from a bottle that you've bought. And, conversely, it's completely appropriate to raise your voice slightly to say ""s'il-vous plait, Monsieur!"" across a crowded restaurant and they are extremely perceptive and will spot this from across the room and come help you. I even had a French friend I was with raise his hand in the air while trying to get the waiter's attention! Though that was at a slightly more down-market place.

Of course this is completely backwards to the restaurant etiquette I'm used to from English-speaking countries. One must never shout or gesticulate to a waiter across the room, and it's expected that the waiter will check in and proactively fix small problems. So the fact that they don't check, and they don't seem to pick up on subtle cues that you need help, seems like they're ignoring you.


So this means that French waiters come across as extremely rude to Anglophone people."

If you really do need subsets, the simplest thing to do is to have whatever function generates the subset output a list of the resulting data frames. Then you can iterate through that list using lapply.

You may also find the purrr package useful. It has a lot of useful functions for manipulating lists of data frames, and data frames that have columns that are lists of abnormal objects.

Did you know that a data frame can have a column where each element in the column is itself a data frame, or a linear model, or whatever other type of object you want? I didn't til I started using purrr.

It could work this way, but it doesn't, because it suits them to keep you in the dark about pricing. That's why people saying ""people should have choices"" or whatever are wrong. Healthcare is a completely dysfunctional market and your choices are completely opaque.

Finally, this leads to an innocent bystander being killed when nobody, including Batman, solves his riddle. This sends him insane with guilt, and he blames Batman and vows revenge. The Riddler isn't seen again until the end of the movie.

Batman, who hasn't appeared in the movie until this point, realises after the fact that there was a clue planted for the murder, and starts pursuing the Riddler through more and more complex crimes, until they finally meet at the resolution of the film.

Sounded like a cool idea to me."

They suck in steam, cool it down, delete 90% of the heat that they removed from the steam, and then increase their temperature by the remaining 10%. If you use a coolant to cool your steam turbines, and use that coolant in an aquatuner to heat the steam that powers the turbines, they are self-sustaining."

He regularly takes several seconds fighting one person rather than just blasting away at six guys. At the same time, the slower pace is sold in because all the setups and hits are running at full speed, everything seems plausible. The choreography itself demonstrates Wick's character in the way he moves and makes decisions, and you can see that he is making decisions rather than just shooting away.

There are several moments in the Chapter 3 scene where they pause to kill someone far away who is already injured, while they're being charged by a new assailant (who then has to buy time for them to be ready to receive his hit). That's the speed of the scene working against them."

Once my neighbours submitted a bogus complaint saying we had moved the property boundary (total shit since the fence is a straight line between every house on the street), but while the inspector was there he noticed that their shed, which was about 2 inches from the boundary, was too tall and made them tear it down.

I wouldn't even consider the amount of swearing Avarsarala does to be particularly excessive. It's about a par, maybe. Since she is part of the UN, there's no reason to imagine that she is American and shares their sensibilities about swearing."
