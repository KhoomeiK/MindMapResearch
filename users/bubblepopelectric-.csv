I can see why someone would criticize the timing but those people are looking at the wrong thing. She said herself the campaign and growing publicity moved her to go public. Her sharing this story has helped other women feel empowered. Even if it was only one other person now has the courage to come forward, I think this was a net positive. Also, it’s likely this would come out eventually anyway and it’s best that she get ahead of the story and control the narrative instead of having someone else who didn’t live it expose the story."

From the Wikipedia page on the Nazi Party.

“The term ""National Socialism"" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of ""socialism"", as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the ""common good"", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization,[5] which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism.”

Really some interesting stuff.
