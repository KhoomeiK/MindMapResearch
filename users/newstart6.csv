pornfree,ff2s7ev,t3_er38ee,1579521845.0,Lol this made me laugh. Hate isn't too healthy and admitting you like porn is important. We just dislike the effects but we all love porn here. This is an honest approach.
depression,ff2r9bz,t1_fezwvun,1579520530.0,"The way I reason is if you develop a mental illness through a traumatic experience or shitty life you can delete it. It's not hard coded, it's an addition to the hard code in your brain. So you have a chance to reprogram the brain back to default. If it's impossible to change the circumstances I agree. I don't know your situation?"
depression,fewt17r,t3_eqo2bc,1579419060.0,You need counseling maybe?
depression,fewsesa,t3_eqt2ys,1579418786.0,I'm sorry
depression,fewscrh,t3_eqsh1t,1579418763.0,That means they don't view you as a close friend. Close friends don't do that.
depression,fews95o,t3_eqs7g1,1579418718.0,"I'm a few years from 30 and if my life doesn't improve I'll have no party. It's sad, I always thought 30 would be a big birthday when I was younger. Unfortunately life hasn't worked out how I thought it would. I barely have any friends."
depression,fewrttv,t3_eqcju4,1579418545.0,"Yep some people have no idea how suicidal thoughts feel. I've had people tell me they have no idea why people kill themselves. My one friend was like, ""Chester from Linkin Park looked so happy."" At the end of the day they don't know any better. I look happy at times too, doesn't mean I'm not depressed."
depression,fewriwo,t3_eqro33,1579418420.0,You have to get vulnerable with someone irl
depression,fewr9nb,t3_eqmpv7,1579418310.0,"I'm in a place of hating to be alone too long but feel too inadequate in the presence of people. I just don't know what I want, not good with decisions."
depression,fewr128,t3_eqqfz6,1579418204.0,Why did it end and why were you ok cloud 9?
depression,fewqrfs,t3_eqs4h8,1579418090.0,"I believe most people have depression due to trauma or they have circumstantial depression. You may have genetic depression but maybe it's the first two. If it is, you can cure it."
depression,fewqaz1,t3_eqpqzk,1579417886.0,It won't necessarily take depression and anxiety away but it alleviates it. I stopped working out for a few months and got more depressed.
pornfree,femaecc,t3_epl0mh,1579245874.0,How do you feel
Christianity,fe2nzfo,t1_fe27n55,1578841022.0,"I agree,  not the preacher's place to make that claim. My family seems to disagree. I'm not even Christian, but I know God said he is the only one who knows people's hearts"
Christianity,fe20d7y,t1_fe1ywl0,1578833103.0,I think his point was that there are many church goers who are fake or not Christian enough. However my issue is making the assumption of saying the majority are like that. He hasn't spoken to all of them so it is a claim based on no evidence. I just did not like it.
Christianity,fe1x0jd,t1_fe1jabs,1578831876.0,OK so you can judge church goers then. For me just assuming that more than 50 percent of church goers aren't Christians is totally non factual. You can't prove it. How does the preacher know this?  His main point was that there are many fake people in church I guess. I just think it's unfair to make assumptions about people you don't know about. His claim of the majority is not evidence based and didn't add to the point he wanted to make.
Christianity,fe1vr2h,t1_fe19pay,1578831453.0,Yep people always get mad when you disagree lol
Christianity,fe1auau,t1_fe19h5l,1578824454.0,"OK but is it his place to make claims with zero evidence. If he says the ""majority"" of church goers aren't Christians that is more than 50 percent.  Seems like a lot... What function does this statement serve? I guess to talk to those who need to get their heart right. I think he could've worded it differently. Like maybe something along the lines of ""I understand some church goers don't have their heart in the right place. ""
Overall I think his job should be to preach the word and not make claims he has no evidence for."
Christianity,fe19rfo,t1_fe19c2t,1578824140.0,"My opinion is we have no idea whether he is correct. If he says ""the majority"" of church goers aren't Christians he is implying more than 50 percent. That seems like a large amount and his claim is purely based on speculation. Plus, why did he say it?  What utility does this assumption serve? I would say just preaching about the word is his job, not making assumptions or judging."
Christianity,fe18i1y,t1_fe16ioa,1578823777.0,"OK so you agree with my stance then? When I had the debate with my family I was very surprised that they disagreed with me. My argument felt very logical. The preacher did a good job from what I can tell, except for the one thing I mentioned."
Christianity,fe14jow,t1_fe13o54,1578822428.0,Zero to do with my post...
pornfree,fdlre79,t1_fbdf8pv,1578530691.0,"Late reply, my bad. Thank you. My lack of financial stability is the only turn off along with my porn addiction then. I've stopped approaching women because being 28 and not having my own place is embarrassing. Yes my porn addiction made me study forever and I'm still not done.

I should focus on getting something behind my name and a steady career but time is passing by and I'm not interacting with women. Maybe I should just talk to them in the mean time as friends since most probably won't want shit to do with me without a job and apartment. You'll probably know better than me since you're a woman."
aspergers,fc2ccc5,t3_e4apie,1577351816.0,"I wanted to make a similar post but I'll be humble enough to admit you did such a fantastic job I wouldn't have made a post this good. Thank you, unfortunately that is what groups end up doing. Look at atheists and Christians on the Internet. Same story."
pornfree,fbd3p5x,t1_fbacj13,1576745178.0,"You are an amazing person. I read many of your comments and your lack of judgment yet amount of understanding is incredible. I've struggled with this for so long and it destroyed me. Never even had a gf and I'm 28. My dude downstairs hasn't worked since like 16 I shit you not. Reading your story does make me happy that I never hurt a girl by never being in a relationship and a virgin. However I hurt many, many girls who were really interested in me but I didn't even feel good enough to try and set up a date. At this point most women had at least one partner my age and women might not want to be with me considering I'm still a virgin. I'm really behind in many aspects of life and that's the price of addiction. The only way out is breaking free from this and hope some women out there will be ok with an inexperienced guy like me."
