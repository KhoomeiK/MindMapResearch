AmItheAsshole,ff3lrtp,t1_ff1s7oy,1579543759.0,Was there ever an update to that post? I felt so bad for that girl and was dying to hear she told her family to fuck off!
todayilearned,fczfmqe,t1_fcz7a0x,1578100186.0,"Yeah lol so there are a couple stories, and sorry in advance as this got long.  So the first one was that the Barclay bros planted a vineyard all of the island and again employed a bunch of people, presenting it as the ""economic future"" of the island. Part of this vineyard was planted on our business associate's land, and they didn't put a clause in the contract about what would happen if the Barclay bros wanted to remove the vines. Lo and behold, the Barclays threw another childish fit because they somehow expected that they could pressure the chief pleas into making the wine tax-free, but that didn't work. So they decided to rip out all the vines to send a message and again ruin sark's economy. But we came to take over the vines on our associate's land, and they couldnt rip them out. We heard from our business associate and Kevin Delaney that they were super mad that we were not letting them rip out the vines and were pressuring/threatening our associate to try to force him. And of course as I said, my husband caught Kevin hiding in the bushes next to the vineyard and poking his head out to watch us working. 

The second story is that my husband was also trying to start a cannabis breeding company there (he is a plant geneticist) and I think they also saw that as a threat. Sadly that didn't work out, the Seigneur actually loved the idea and fully supported it, but we got some pushback from others in the govt so my husband decided it wasn't worth it (and now has a hemp company in other Channel islands other than sark and was actually the first person in the UK to extract CBD a couple weeks ago :-) ). And the vineyard was a nightmare, lots of hard labor and they had done a super shit job of planting it and planted the vines the wrong distance apart. So that was not enough to keep us in sark either, and we left and sadly never got to actually undermine anything and the Barclays continue to ruin the island, now with an electricity scheme where they tried to force everyone to evacuate the island ðŸ¤¯"

todayilearned,fcw4qwl,t1_fcvm6et,1578017117.0,"Super interesting, how did you get inside and what was it like? I heard people who work there have to sign NDAs and not talk about what goes on there (but if that is true, they must anyway bc I heard a couple entertaining gossipy stories about e.g. them dumping a fortunes worth of Italian marble into the channel bc they bought it, didnâ€™t like it and didnâ€™t want people to know)"
todayilearned,fcvo3jl,t1_fcvlv3p,1578006287.0,"Well, they just want to control the government so they can control the taxation and laws. They don't actually live on Sark, they live on their private island which is almost connected to Sark. And they don't personally visit Sark a lot as far as I am aware, they do all their dealings through Kevin Delaney who does live in Sark. And he is totally nuts, he has a library filled with books about every dictator you can imagine, and releases this weekly newsletter that is just like 10 pages of him ranting about how Sark is like Nazi Germany. Btw there is an interesting documentary about Sark and the Barclay bros (https://youtu.be/xlcgJAseSC8). Note how Kevin Delaney was spying on the journalist....he is known for doing this and at least seemingly did the same thing to my husband and me when we were there, as my husband caught him watching us through the bushes (and we knew he was already unhappy with us as we were there to undermine another of his and the Barclay bros petty revenge schemes on the island)"
todayilearned,fcv9f67,t1_fcv13vq,1577997398.0,"They owned all the hotels on the island, which were the main source of employment on the island. When democracy came in they tried to get their crony Kevin Delaney and some others in the government. They lost the election and in a fit of petulance they closed all the hotels on the island, unemploying most of the population. 

Source: briefly lived on Sark and know the insane character that is Kevin Delaney."
