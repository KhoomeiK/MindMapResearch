facepalm,fe5jem4,t1_fdsaviq,1578870159.0,"nope... I haven't. But I am sure there were others out there that happened. 

Side note, there was also this lady that was in our ""baby swimming"" class (where you blow on the baby's face and can take it underwater... cool instinct babies have... anyways, I digress) ... and this woman had a ROCKIN' BOD!!! NO Way that woman gave birth a month ago. I hated her secretly for that..."

facepalm,fdqsauy,t3_empilw,1578673808.0,"This happened to someone I knew, but not exactly like mentioned above .... she KNEW she was pregnant, but hid it from her parents easily. She was 8 months and barely showed at all! She didn't tell them until 3 weeks before she gave birth. 

I have had two children with my first husband, and I was showing easily at 4 months. I couldn't BELIEVE she barely showed. even at 8 months, all she needed to do was wear a larger sweatshirt and it was hidden completely. 

and she was a skinny girl, btw. I don't know how she did it.

that was 20 years ago... and she kept the child. I don't know what happened to her as I had moved away."
