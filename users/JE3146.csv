polymer80,fewd6tc,t3_eqmbiv,1579408656.0,What color is that? Cobalt?
pdxgunnuts,fet3hqt,t3_eqjlk2,1579371456.0,Oregon rifle works used to carry p80 lowers. Might be worth a call.
ORGuns,fepypbd,t1_fepxtx4,1579334812.0,"Check their reviews and decide for yourself.

It’s not a place I would shop.

NW Armory (either location, though Tigard is mostly a wall of pistols) or Oregon Rifleworks are both solid choices in the area."

Firearms,fdsny05,t3_emvr5y,1578705689.0,"Just added a SOFTT-W and Eleven 10 Rigid case to my shooting belt. 

That plus a trauma kit in my shooting bag. That way in case I dump one in my leg on the action range, I can make it back to my kit."
space,fdqv0f7,t1_fdqqzp8,1578675210.0,Most aerospace regulations are written in blood from things that were never thought to happen.
diabetes,fdlg40d,t3_elv9aw,1578523280.0,"Love seeing stuff like this. 

My girlfriend years back, after we started dating saw I was type 1 and knew next to nothing about it. She asked if there were any books or web sites she could read to know what to do if there was ever an emergency or what to look for. She researched all about it and started carrying fruit snacks with her in her purse. 

17 years later, still together, Married and still carrying fruit snacks for me in her purse."

cats,fd5gcvv,t1_fd5dlg6,1578177311.0,"Maybe. Here’s another one of him.

I saw a previous post of yours. They’re definitely close.  Glad there’s more like him. He’s been the most loving cat I’ve ever met.

cats,fd58bar,t3_ejv6y1,1578175134.0,"This is insanely creepy. My little Maine coon mix looks identical to your cat in fluff and color. He snuggles on my chest, nuzzling my chin and face every night if I lay down. Whether it be my bed or the couch. Oliver is such a snuggle bug and keeps me warm in the winter."
NintendoSwitch,fcz08rd,t1_fcyhfpw,1578091014.0,How many kids under the age of 5 do you have lol?
diabetes,fcpbabd,t3_ei0wd5,1577856970.0,This would skyrocket me. No idea why but protein messes me up just as bad lately.
gaming,fcp8adn,t1_fcnqi4d,1577853821.0,Yup. Did it. No regrets but dear lord did it suck for a few of those.
GunPorn,fcp7iyh,t1_fcoqeyb,1577853070.0,Definitely worth it for the $300 or so I paid with the bushing upgrade. Not sure I’d pay $500. For that cost I’d have just gotten the shadow 2 Orange.
gundeals,fcnyt8b,t3_ei6yea,1577821055.0,"Really wish they had cobalt in stock.

EDIT: Ordered Black... couldn't pass up this deal. I told myself I wasn't going to start so many projects next year... but it isn't the new year yet..."

gundeals,fbvrnyw,t1_fbvpos6,1577135084.0,Aero is pretty good with warranties if you think it might be out of spec. If you have calipers I can measure mine to see if there’s a difference.
