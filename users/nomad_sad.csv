Try to overlap with requirements for other parts, so do bastila, bindo, jka, ahsoka, and old ben. or ezra and kanan, kanan is crappy but ezra sees some usefulness"
todayilearned,fez0qs7,t1_feywc3b,1579452843.0,"One can say ""jeez that's a shit hand you've been dealt"" without being a cunt. Robespierre and the terror proved they were right to want to flee for their lives, and if you can fault someone concern for their own safety then you have no conception of empathy."

ABoringDystopia,fe0bqlc,t1_fdy9zb3,1578808970.0,Ehhhhhh. Guillotines for the holding company of Tim Hortons who has ruined our national treasure sure. Meghan and Harry haven’t done much wrong that no one else has though.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwr12o,t1_fdwco5m,1578761485.0,"I’ve done enough road trips through and to the rural South and midwest, the level of poverty is worse than many countries Americans would think of as “shit hole.”"
worldnews,fdvf5gs,t1_fdtklkp,1578746730.0,"The TSA is also the largest federal ""make work"" program after the military, employing thousands of otherwise completely useless Americans. Only high school required, no customer service skill or other useful skills required."

MyPeopleNeedMe,fc6ft48,t1_fc5q15r,1577479557.0,"I feel bad for octopus like this, and for any factory farmed animal, but fuck do I hate pigs. We had em on the farm when I was a kid and they are mean and vile. They will eat anything, including eachother, regardless of pen size (bigger than recommended for how many we had), feeding (they ate tonnes), or anything. I feel for cattle and care for them, but fuck pigs."
freefolk,fbwmow0,t1_fbwlz9s,1577153961.0,"They definitely shouldn’t be easily able to churn out 10k. The empire took 20~ years with all its resources to build about 250k, and it owned a third of the galaxy. The excuses given of companies willingly working with them through subsidiaries is half assed and baked on to cover JJ’s ass because he wanted to redo ragtag rebels vs big enemy"
freefolk,fbw8u5k,t1_fbu0n51,1577143609.0,"And the second one took three years, they got much better once they figured out the science to it. It's still quite ridiculous, and they really should've set up the Imperial Cult a hell of a lot better (like back in movie 7), but it does make more sense than Urine Killjoy."
