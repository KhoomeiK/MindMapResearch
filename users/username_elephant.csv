You're writing like Russia is covered by trains, rather than roads, when the reality is that a lot of it is covered in nothing. US population is a lot more diffuse, and (historically at least) a lot more agricultural."
space,fe9w2vj,t1_fe9pnqx,1578941941.0,"Well, except for the whole dark matter thing. ""This theory works perfectly in all cases, providing we assume the existence of additional mass where needed.""

Not saying that GR is wrong, just saying that there are certainly open questions, which I believe is the point of the article."

todayilearned,fdq8k48,t1_fdpokt8,1578659274.0,Honestly this is the norm as well. There's good data correlating onset of these laws with big jumps in the sale of plastic trash bags. I've lost track of the source on that but I definitely remember finding it convincing.

funny,fcn5n20,t1_fclcxf1,1577803910.0,"When I was a kid I would close my cat in my room before bed, and my parents would open the door to free him a couple of hours later. However, he was a smart boy and figured out that he could leave whenever he wanted by knocking treasured positions off of my desk. He made it look like an accident too... Just stuff he casually knocked into while exploring.. Despite the fact that if he went there during the rest of the day, he would do so completely silently, without disturbing a thing.

This same cat realized that he could displace whatever other cat you were currently petting by scratching the couch.. And then he could usually hop up onto your lap after you got up to shoo him away and returned to your seat."

AskReddit,fc05oa0,t1_fc0522z,1577279702.0,"Even that depends. Went to Iowa State in Ames, public transportation there was amazingly comprehensive (and free for students).

Now I live in Boston, still don't need/want a car.

Everywhere else I've ever been was tough without a car, but there certainly are exceptions."
