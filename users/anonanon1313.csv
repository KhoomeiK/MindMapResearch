audio,fe7whb6,t3_eo0yq5,1578919962.0,"A lot of subs with internal amplifiers have both ""line level"" and ""speaker level"" inputs. Many passive (unamplified) subs have either dual drivers or a dual wound driver which are made to be run in series or parallel with the main speakers. Another approach is to simply add another amplifier to an unamplified sub, either a ""plate amplifier"" or a small switching (class D) amplifier.

Generally, connectors can be mixed, there's nothing special about connecting wires together. What's important is the characteristics of the signal -- speakers are driven with much higher voltages (and currents) than ""line level"" inputs, and those are higher than phono and microphone input signals. You can easily drop higher voltages to lower with simple resistor circuits, but the opposite is not easily done. The other consideration is noise, lower level signals are more susceptible to picking up electrical noise and so are usually shielded. More rarely, some signals are transmitted ""balanced""  and shouldn't be matched with unbalanced, these are usually identified by special connector styles.

Subwoofers with internal amplifiers are often called ""active"" subs, those without often called ""passive"". Active subs usually have inputs for both line and speaker level inputs.

Amplifiers that have a ""sub out"" connector usually (but not always) limit the output to low frequencies only. Amplified subs often have controls to set the frequency cutoff, so you can run the full frequency signal to them and they'll filter out the highs. Unamplified subs usually have passive ""crossover"" circuits to limit the high frequencies. It can be a little complicated to set up subs with an existing system. Speaker placement and room acoustics are also very important for sub setup -- lots of good online tutorials."

Approximately 84% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, up from 64% in 1950. By 2050, 89% of the U.S. population and 68% of the world population is projected to live in urban areas.1More than 300 urban areas in the U.S. have populations above 100,000; New York City, with 8.4 million inhabitants, is the largest.3,4The rate of urbanization, i.e., the changing of land from forest or agricultural uses to suburban and urban uses, is increasing.5 Between 2000 and 2010, urban land area in the U.S. increased by 15%. Urban land area is 106,386 square miles, or 3% of total land area in the U.S., and is projected to triple from 2000 to 2050.6,7The average population density of the U.S. is 87 people per square mile. The average population density of metropolitan areas (MSA) is 283 people per square mile; in New York City, the population density is 27,012 people per square mile. Guttenberg, New Jersey has the greatest density of housing units (24,195) per square mile of land area.6One study found that low-density development has 2.5 times the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and twice the energy use of high-density development on an annual per capita basis; on a per unit living area basis, low-density development has 1.5 times the annual GHG emissions and the same energy use as the high-density development.8"

These days the stuff in this price range is pretty similar, and $500 buys you a pretty nice system. Speakers like the JBL ( eg 306), Edifiers, Micca (eg MB42x), all have fans, but get similar reviews. Some prefer the old style receiver/amps (eg Yamaha), I prefer the newer ""chip amps"" (class D, I like SMSL brand), I can't really hear any difference.

I stream everything (audio & video), Chromecast into TV HDMI, TV optical out to amp, amp to sub. 

Rule of thumb is to spend more on speakers, many good passives in the <$300/pair range, Kef being only one example. ""Class D"" amplifiers deliver the most bang for buck these days (50W/channel ~$100). You could add the sub later if your budget is tight or you don't need the bump."

AskMen,fd2ljwy,t3_ejryfn,1578148940.0,"Tough question. I've been on both sides. My dad passed not long ago (99, not a tragedy), and my son's been out of school and working for several years now. We're all engineers, if that is relevant. I never was close with my father, not for lack of trying. He liked to pontificate, so I did a lot of listening. He was extremely intelligent, so it wasn't boring, but completely one-sided. With my son I felt it was love at first sight on my part. He became distant during his teen years and has been slow to come around. One thing I realized (belatedly) was that we had conflicting goals in our relationship -- I wanted to mentor him, and he wanted me to recognize him. I wanted to feel needed as a parent and he wanted to be seen as an equal. So I was giving him unsolicited advice and he was showing me things that he had learned that he felt would impress me. Kind of put us at cross purposes. I've tried to modify my behaviour after recognizing this, but it's been hard.

A recent episode illustrates how good intentions can go wrong if you're not paying attention. He and I used to build computers and do gaming. He's tried to get me back into gaming in recent years, probably just so we'd have something to share again. This Xmas he gifted me a completely built, high-spec, gaming computer that he had assembled. He was clearly excited to give it. It was an incredibly generous act -- which is perfectly in character for him, but it made me feel awkward -- it's a reversal of our historical roles. I have to accept his expertise and generosity, thank and compliment him, despite wanting to play the generous expert myself. It feels unnatural, but I'm really trying. I need to put my ego aside. If I don't, he'll feel slighted and our relationship will grow more distant.

So maybe (just spit balling here) you have a similar conflict. If your father is as inflexible as mine was, maybe you'll just have to accept his terms as they are. My dad had a favorite story about a salesman trying to close a big deal. He did it by asking the decision maker to do him a favor on the side. It seems counter-intuitive, but doing favors often predisposes people positively. This is a very long winded suggestion that maybe you find a way to let your father help you with something even if you have to invent it. The whole father-son thing seems to boil down to ego conflict."

One Fuji is set up as a fixed gear, the Schwinn is a backup fixed gear frameset.  The Cannondales are touring geometry frames with steel forks. The others are classic ""sport tourers"".

I've spoken with several custom frame makers in the past, and to a few very tall owners of custom frames. I had the money but wasn't sold on the designs/designers. One of them frankly told me he didn't make enough frames in very large sizes to be confident in performance. Another spoke of the problems getting the tube sets in extra length. None of the owners of tall frames seemed extremely happy with them, handling problems (shimmy, wheelies, etc) were described.

I decided that I wanted longer chain stays than most frame makers would/could provide. That pretty much eliminated Zinn. I also wanted the torsionally stiffest frame I could get. I wanted large diameter tubes for that, which rules out steel -- carbon and aluminum aren't (or weren't) available custom, leaving by elimination Cannondale factory bikes. I managed to get a new 68cm touring frame (for the wheelbase/chain stays, tire clearances) just before they stopped making that size. I liked it so much that I scoured the internet to find another which I've kept in reserve.

I can honestly say that if Cannondale made a larger size I wouldn't want it. My steel bikes are fine, I've ridden 10's of thousands of miles on them. They are flexy though. I've made 60 mph descents on the Cannondale though which I wouldn't have pushed that far on the steel. I've also broken (fatigue) 2 steel frames. Nothing wrong with vintage frames, if you can find them, but I've always wound up discarding all the components, most of the old stuff just wasn't that great."

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_emotional_intelligence

Of course this is a complex, and sometimes divisive topic, and there's hardly consensus on the nurture/nature aspects. However, echoing the central complaint of this (OP's) article from the perspective of my own lived experience and simply limiting it to the cultural dimension (at least my own white/middle class/American one), I think male culture is stunted emotionally -- intentionally. A kind of faux-stoicism is a commonly expressed positive value. Men actually revel in their emotional cluelessness. You don't need academic papers for that, just sit through the commercials in a football game or watch some primetime sitcoms."

Breadit,fc4krfw,t3_eg3km0,1577419556.0,"I've had the 4.5qt ""classic"" since I bought it new in 1983. I've heard the new ones aren't as good, yet America's Test Kitchen seemed to rate them highly in a field of American and European made mixers.

I've used mine primarily for bread. My usual batch size is 1 kg of flour (which yields 2 sandwich loaves, 4 baguettes, or 16 burger rolls). I have no capacity issues with that quantity, but that's close to the limit. I estimate I've made over 1,000 batches over the years, and the only servicing I've performed is replacing the speed controller and the rubber feet (both around $15). I usually make successive batches on days that I'm baking, up to 4 in all. I'm quite happy with the tilt head design, too.

My mixer was $185 in 1983 dollars, which inflates to something like $500, 2019 bucks, for what that's worth. I do sometimes hand knead and sometimes no-knead, but I couldn't possibly have the quantity, variety or frequency of bread making without my mixer."

Even though most boats are made with polyester, I think marine epoxy is the more reliable material for repairs, and cost isn't really an issue with a job this size. In any case, given its toxicity, I prefer to never use the stuff if I don't have to.

As I said, I wouldn't cut and bevel for a hull and hole this size, I'd simply lap it over and rely on the epoxy adhesion to hold the pieces together."

My filling is roughly: 2# sauerkraut (drained, squeezed out), 1/2 a large head of cabbage (finely chopped), a couple of large onions (finely chopped), 1# fresh mushrooms, .1# rehydrated shiitake mushrooms (both finely chopped). Everything sweated (in butter) until soft individually, then combined and cooked to blend favors.

For the dough, I use 1,000g flour (2.2#) and a dozen large eggs. Kneaded, rested and rolled out thinly. About 1tbsp of filling (~2.5"" size) made 120. Frozen on sheet pan, filled 2, 1 gallon ziplock bags.

I use a stand mixer to knead the dough and a roller attachment to make the sheets, then a 6 cavity mold to fill and crimp.

You need to get good bonding (use real marine epoxy, not polyester. Use woven cloth, not mat. Grind down back surface for good bond, use a larger patch for each successive area. Try to rig up some form of clamping, even if you have to drill small bolt holes, pressure will ensure the cloth isn't oversaturated, cover with plastic before clamping for no stick.
