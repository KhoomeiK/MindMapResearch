I found rowing helps me deal with it better than doing the bike though. 
Wishing you a speedy recovery"

learnart,fczvtvl,t3_eje9yj,1578109476.0,"For humans, I find a solid understanding of anatomy essential. It's really one of the fundamentals that will allow you to create poses and draw from imagination. 

For other stuff, I think if you work on the fundamentals like lighting, perspective, and color theory, you will be off to a solid start. That, and as others have said, learning to draw from reference. 

For beginner stuff, I tried to compile my favorite tips into articles: 

*Artist Guides to:* [digital art](https://artres.xyz/post/beginners-guide-to-digital-art/), [traditional art](https://artres.xyz/post/beginners-guide-to-traditional-art/) , and [photography](https://artres.xyz/post/ultimate-guide-to-photography/)  
*Art Fundamentals:* [color theory](https://artres.xyz/post/wonderful-resources-to-master-color-theory/), [anatomy](https://artres.xyz/post/a-round-up-of-anatomy-quick-tips/), [perspective](https://artres.xyz/post/artists-guide-to-perspective/)"
learnart,fczvipu,t3_ejq7gp,1578109325.0,"Love this advice!

I searched reddit and tumblr and my own personal favorites to compile my [top 25 favorite youtube channels for artists!](https://artres.xyz/post/learn-art-today-with-the-most-helpful-art-youtubers/)
