memes,felxc39,t1_felwudi,1579233303.0,"As I already stated, we are both entitled to our own beliefs, anything uncivilized I was referring to was the way that you are bashing other people's. You haven't quoted the Bible at all so I don't see how you have presented anything I've been unable to counter. Furthermore, I don't see how I've proved your point about cognitive bias either, especially considering you have presented any evidence from the Bible, the only point you have made is that God doesn't deserve worship based on your view of Him. I brought the conversation back to His perfect nature to explain to you why I believe He DOES deserve worship."
memes,felvrm2,t1_feluz2t,1579232157.0,"Look, you originally commented that based on your understanding that there is no point to worship God. All I've done is try to point out some reasons why Christians do, but frankly, if you don't believe in His perfection then you're right and there's nothing I'm going to be able to say to change your mind. However, I don't understand why you are actively bashing other people's beliefs. We may be in disagreement, but we can still try to be civilized and get along."
memes,felumwq,t1_feltmwd,1579231350.0,"Well the obvious answer from a Christian viewpoint is that the world had grown full of sin. The Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), in other words, anyone who sins (which is everyone according to Romans 3:23 ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"")  will be punished with death. The second part of Romans 6:23 tells us that the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. At the time, everyone in the world, with the exception of Noah, had been sinning in a manner God determined required a fresh start. As God, who created everything, including all of the people who were sinning, He has the right to enforce the punishment which sin necessitates. Fortunately, believers of today don't have to face the punishment of death through Jesus' sacrifice. I'm happy to answer any other questions, feel free to pm me if you prefer."
memes,feltr7x,t1_felt1ip,1579230725.0,"It's not just God's power we worship Him for, it's all of His characteristics, but to summarize: His perfection. That's why the same relationship wouldn't work with the devil assuming he someone gained power over God. I made a comment earlier on this same post about how no one can seem to accept Christian views and allow us to believe in what we want and think you're proving that quite well. If you don't agree with my religious views, that's ok, let's both move and let each other believe in whatever they want to."
memes,felr70n,t1_felr3v9,1579228948.0,"Could you give me a specific reference? I get what you're saying, but my answer depends on the context."
memes,felig0g,t1_felhvpx,1579222940.0,"Well that's not what I said. What I'm saying is, Christians worship God and not you because we believe He is all-powerful and therefore DESERVES worship not because we are terrified of His power."
memes,feldqcn,t3_epj3nn,1579219774.0,"As a Christian, it's so discouraging to see so many people bashing my religion. Not to call out op specifically, I just saw a lot of this in the comments. If you don't want to believe in Christianity, that's ok with me, just let me believe what I want to believe and don't refer to religious people as ""brainwashed."" We can get along despite our disagreements."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fd3umr6,t3_ejj6zk,1578161743.0,"1. Most Iranians practice Islam.
2. The primary religious text of Islam is the Quran.
3. The Quran commands that the Quran is not to be defiled, insulted, or defaced.
4. We line our tanks with Qurans and they can't shoot us."

Try your best to socialize on the trip, even if it's hard or uncomfortable, and maybe you'll find a friend or two who you can really relate to."
