Escalators are even tested and certified in the factory before being shipped.

Here (UK) the independents can buy and install complete (usually shitty) package mrl lifts (mostly from Spain), so hydro is dying out pretty rapidly for passenger lifts."

Showerthoughts,fel7nns,t1_fel2db9,1579215823.0,"Meh, debatable.

Maybe they met up for a drink or some casual dining, laughed about all the completely unsuitable matches they'd had (some of them didn't even *have* credit cards). Perhaps the drink flowed, and they decided to go back to his server rack and get a bit *non binary*

In all the excitement, he might have forgotten to sanitise his input string before performing his SQL injection, and 9 months later a baby scambot may have arrived. This may have been hard for them as young, professional scambots, but perhaps they made it work. 

Maybe they saw their young scambot through college and held back tears as he moved out onto cloud server of his own. They may have been planning their retirement together, skimming credit cards around the south of France when he suffered a fatal error on line no. 34.
