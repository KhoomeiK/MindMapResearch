popheads,ff984cv,t1_ff92key,1579707043.0,"Honestly. I like Fantano and his reaction to Good News alone shows he has a lot of emotional sensitivity and understands the value of music that provokes feelings. But I just don't think he really appreciates the context and emotional background and subject matter of songs unless you're being slapped in the face with it. Like the age old example of MBDTF. It's an extremely emotional album full of pain and regret and anger and fear. Yet he has always described tracks like Runaway and Lost in the World as cringey and melodramatic. His original MAYA by M.I.A. review, which is imo the worst thing he's ever done, totally ignores the aggressive political messages and feelings to call the album sonically muddled and therefore bad- even in his redux review he only stopped to compliment the sounds on the album after all with no mention of the subject matter. And didn't he go the entirety of his Igor review without talking about the queer themes?? It's just so strange. As someone who loves subject matter, lyrics, and themes in music, it's an aspect of his reviews that is so often lacking. He's far from an annoying r a t i o n a l white guy and genuinely cares about the emotional impact of music but he misses things that seem clear and important to me all the time, in this case how emotionally devastating Swimming is.  
 
He did talk about whether he'd give albums by recently deceased artists higher scores in one video, but I can't remember what he said besides the overall answer being ""no""."
popheads,ff96ol2,t1_ff93zql,1579706114.0,"I reeeeally disagree with that comparison. It wasn't a novelty song, ironic, or just for kids. People genuinely liked it and listened to it because it was a fun song. It was also way way bigger."
muacjdiscussion,ff96ahc,t1_ff90jnt,1579705853.0,Getting samples just doesn't seem to be a big thing in Europe. The only ones I've ever gotten were little foundation samples from MAC and No 7 after having long detailed convos with more polite salespeople about being unsure about my shade. I'd definitely never consider straight up asking for one. That and the ability to return things are two things the US seems to have that we don't. :(
youngpeopleyoutube,ff7jkef,t1_ff7h2or,1579651060.0,Honestly it's a problem I notice too and I think there should be a bigger push for making sure kids do activities that require long term focus like reading books whether that's at school or at home. It kind of effects us too because I'm sure I have a shorter attention span than when I was a kid but at least we tend to be aware it's not a good habit to have and actively try and work past it.
