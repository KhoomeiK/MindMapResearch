tretinoin,fef9ow9,t3_eou3fq,1579051479.0,Not a review but ulta has it on sale this Sunday if you have one near you! $10
college,fedw2f1,t3_eomjwv,1579021105.0,"I try to study everyday. If I’m feeling burnt out I’ll take a Saturday or Friday afternoon off depending on the “burnt ness”. I don’t split up my time per say, I found this to be a very inefficient way of studying. I study by topics and split it up by looking at the syllabus. For example if if we start chapter 1 on Monday and finish it on Wednesday. I study a third of chapter 1 on Monday, then Tuesday, and Wednesday. This method has been working out for me so far, it helps me from falling behind."
CollegeTransfer,fe5xr8z,t1_fe5vece,1578877301.0,"Challenging yourself if definitely something you can do at the university you are currently at. May I ask what major you are? You can take on an internship, part time job, research experience, etc., to add to your resume. If you feel like you can handle upper level courses, I recommend taking some of your “easier” courses over the summer to knock them out so you can move on to harder ones. 
Colleges courses don’t really change in difficulty depending on the school. I’m in health science and have talked to people that have had to retake difficult science courses at a community college and didn’t see a difference in the difficulty of the class. It’s all up to you tho! I listened to my gut when transferring and it’s worked out for me!"
acne,fe5s9t2,t3_enr9n4,1578873838.0, Rosacare Procure? $15 on amazon. I’ve never used it myself but a dermatologist I follow recommended it and it gets good reviews. I’m planning on buying it because I get similar flare ups every once in a while.
CollegeTransfer,fe5qs46,t3_env3kp,1578873174.0,"I’d try to look into why you really don’t like your original school. For example, I transferred schools because my original school did not have the major I wanted (I tried to make it work but realized it was a waste of money to major in something I didn’t like). So, once I transferred this problem was solved! However, if you wanted to transfer due to social reasons, this problem may not be solved at the next school. 
Ask yourself if transferring is going to solve whatever problem you have at your old school first. And second, realize that no one really WANTS to go back to college after break. College can suck and it’s normal to not love it 100% of the time."
tretinoin,fdy0ndw,t3_enav5q,1578774814.0,Pimple patches are amazing on tret! They help keep your fingers off and aren’t too drying. I like the cosrx patches or you can get blister bandages from your drugstore and cut them up because they are made from the same thing (hydrocolloid dressing)
prephysicianassistant,fdvw3wu,t3_en7a8e,1578752293.0,Physical therapy aide (different than physical therapy assistant at least in my state) no cert required for aide
acne,fdl0fj2,t1_fdl08ag,1578514852.0,"The description says “blend of natural ingredients which combine demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, along with inhibiting effects on sebum production.”
It’s called Nicazel Forte if you want to research more"
acne,fdkwn6p,t3_elunvi,1578512685.0,I take a prescription zinc supplement and it has helped tremendously with my cystic acne. I still get “normal” whiteheads but they are nothing compared to the cysts I used to get
acne,fdh04es,t3_elcne1,1578412462.0,THIS is so true! I had the same mindset and once my acne cleared I just found other flaws within myself. Practice self love now!
acne,fd93pkc,t1_fd7lpum,1578227924.0,"Idk if it was being in the sun more or using more sunscreen but I noticed an improvement in the redness of my skin when I religiously wore and reapplied sunscreen.

This could have been because I was repairing my skin barrier by moisturizing or the fact that sunscreen has zinc and some people say that it can improve acne.

 I also didn’t  notice a difference in the severity of my acne in the summer vs winter months. Sorry I can’t give you a straight answer lol I think it was a combination of multiple things that improved my acne."
acne,fd6l31z,t1_fd6kqwq,1578192604.0,No problem and good luck!
acne,fd6jzwi,t1_fd6im3m,1578192200.0,"I was on oral antibiotics for my first month. When I brought up to her that I had problem with cysts before my cycle she gave me doxycycline to take 3-5 days beforehand. Im trying to avoid antibiotics as well so I haven’t had the chance to take them yet.

I’m also on a prescribed multivitamin tho! It’s called Nicazel Forte it’s a zinc supplement. If you want to try to supplement zinc naturally it’s in meat, eggs, dairy, and legumes I believe."
acne,fd6i5s5,t3_ek5qzd,1578191399.0,"I told my derm I was a big makeup user and she recommended bareminerals. I’ve used their blemish remedy powder foundation, blemish remedy concealer, and bareskin pro foundation and haven’t had a problem. You can find some for cheap at tjmaxx or Marshall’s.
I would be wary about primers though, I can’t seem to find one that doesn’t irritate or breakout my skin."
acne,fd6hddf,t1_fd6ek3i,1578191040.0,"Yes! I was actually most surprised by how fast the closed comedones healed. I saw improvements within 2/3 weeks and they were completely gone within 2 months. The cystic acne took a lot longer to heal but I would say around 1 month is when I felt like I had “normal” acne levels and at 2 months I had my first totally clear skin day. My acne was pretty cyclical however, so I still would get 1-3 cysts once a month until i was 10 months into treatment. When I break out now it’s about 1-2 normal whiteheads and they go away very quickly."
acne,fd6dx8z,t1_fd5g4g6,1578189500.0,Thank you!
acne,fd6dbrs,t1_fd6bb3v,1578189232.0,"Thank you and of course! I was fortunate enough to be able to go to a dermatologist. She prescribed me Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (0.1%/2.5%) and Tazarotene Cream 0.1%. 


When I told her I would be in Disney for a week she told me to hold off on the prescription products and just use a cerave cleanser and moisturizer in the meantime (she told me the sun exposure along with the topicals would be too much for my skin to handle) I saw the most drastic difference in my skin at this time. It was less irritated and I had fewer breakouts.


After my vacation, when I started to use my prescribed products, the progress was really slow, but definitely worth it."
acne,fd5gsdr,t3_ek3o9i,1578177466.0,"I’m a pretty private person and my acne may have not been the worst, but I wanted people who are struggling with acne to know that they are not alone! I had super painful cystic acne and TONS of closed comedones all over my face. This is over a year of progress and I still sometimes break out so don’t beat yourself up if you’re still struggling to find your routine!"
acne,fd584ol,t3_ek18xm,1578175074.0,"Yes! The peeling is honestly the worst part. Try moisturizing multiple times a day (cerave cream works well) and putting on petroleum jelly before bed (cerave healing ointment is my fav)

When my peeling got really bad I would take a damp washcloth and GENTLY rub off the flakes so I could go to class without looking like a lizard"
acne,fd573ms,t3_ek2d1z,1578174855.0,"Haven’t been on accutane but I’m on epiduo and tazorac so I’ve experienced super dry skin.

Cerave healing ointment really helped! I put it on my lips, corners of my eyes and nose before I go to bed. (Some people put the ointment on their whole face) 

Vaseline works as well but I’m pretty sure the cerave healing ointment has a higher percentage of petroleum if I’m not mistaken.

I recommend keeping one in your bathroom and one in your purse/backpack/car!"

college,fd2essa,t3_ejnhwy,1578146188.0,I have a commute of 30 minutes and I’m more involved then when I lived on campus. I plan my classes around usual meeting times. It takes some more work when you’re commuting but it’s possible to stay involved.

college,fd2aikj,t3_ejveqg,1578144286.0,"I feel like the college like is overly romanticized. College isn’t fun 100% of the time, it’s hard to make friends, and it can be really lonely. I’m sure you’re going to hear the same advice over and over again to “join clubs” and “put yourself out there”. The truth is, yeah you should try to socialize and join things, but remember college is HARD. If you want a job by the time you graduate in something you like, you have to put a lot of time into school work and internships which can leave something to be desired. This may not be “the best years of your life” but try to make the best out of what you are given by changing your mindset. Don’t expect everyday to be good but try to see the good in everyday."
SkincareAddiction,fcytyf3,t1_fcyshzg,1578087018.0,"Wow! Thank you for showing me this! If you use this product, is amazon a reliable place to get it? I’ve heard some problems with people getting fake or old versions of the products they’ve ordered"
SkincareAddiction,fcyrh6p,t1_fcy4cii,1578085535.0,Thank you! I’ll have to give it a try we have very similar skin types!
SkincareAddiction,fcqjhz1,t3_ei6hsv,1577887103.0,"I like La roche Posay TOLERIANE DOUBLE REPAIR FACIAL MOISTURIZER WITH SPF. I have sensitive, dry skin. It’s lightweight, doesn’t leave a white cast, it may be too oily for some, but I love the “glow” it gives me. (Has an spf of 30)"
SkincareAddiction,fcqijaw,t1_fcpivdt,1577886609.0,"I can second this! My derm gave me the wrong directions and I was using both Epiduo and Tazarotene cream in the AM. The stinging was unbearable. I called her and she cleared up the directions, now I use epiduo in the am and Tazarotene cream in the pm and my skin has never been clearer"
college,fcqi7uv,t3_eii1l4,1577886436.0,"Look into active recall as a way of studying. Learn how to study effectively this will save you time. There’s a bunch of study youtubers out there that can help like Ali Abdaal. Also I know this is cheesy but make time for yourself. Workout, go out with friends, take up a hobby. Remember that college is stressful but it’s temporary, you won’t be stressed like this forever."
acne,fasmmmp,t3_eafrql,1576328944.0,I usually make sure to cleanse my eyebrows (lol) with  micellar water before I double cleanse. This helps get all the sunscreen that may get trapped underneath the hairs
