I have a love for making my own maps for my various OC worlds, including things I'm fandom to. This is just one of them. I use it primarily for roleplay, and story writing.

As for the world, it's inhabited by Gens 1-5, and includes things such as Soul Merging, Delta Pokémon, and some Mega-Evolutions. All of which gradually unlock as time progresses

Each town and village in my world has a professor, because it makes no sense for other locations not to. Allowing a trainer to begin their journey anywhere and explore their region! (Even in rp)

It has key locations such as the TempleOA for a cultish fellowship to take hold (and a way for roleplay partners to start the Arceus quest). The Professors academy (for players) to begin education to be a research assistant or professor themself. As well as the secret dastardly Team Royal that work in the shadows.

My only hangup on doing that (swapping Ordon and Kokiri) is that regular people haven't seemed to be able to traverse through the Kokiri Forest for the most part. There is mention, but little evidence of so, which would block off the southeast flatlands. 

But it is something I will definitely resolve with the next version! Thank you for asking!"
zelda,fcshn3a,t1_fcsebs7,1577916704.0,"Hey, thank you for commenting! These are very valid and I share some of these thoughts too. 

As for the Lost Woods, I agree, it should be re arranged a bit differently and quite possibly closer together. My first thought was swapping Ordon woods and the Kokiri forest; the only hangups would be the Land southeast of the Ordon woods. The Kokiri forest isn't usually something people other than the Kokiri could go, so in this case I put it on it's own, but will look to change it!

Mirror of Twilight I put where it is so it is like a detachment from the rest of the world, an event that the pieces are across Hyrule and ultimately lead to that location, as well as to bring a clan to that section or Hyrule as I wished to spread them the best as I could along the edges. Though I would happily take suggestions where else to drop the mirror.

Lurelin Village! I just need to change the background colours around the village and get rid of the extra green, but yes, thank you! 

As for the castle, I'm not too big a fan of it being in the middle in general, and I'm treating Hyrule like another clan just as the Goron, Zora, Mogma... are. Though I agree the placements could be better

I will definitely come back to your comment when working on the next version!"

I made the very first template background about 1 and a half years ago and didn't touch it, having no idea what to use the map for, and it looked like... [this](https://imgur.com/a/sCjI8mE)

From there it took me a few months and a rereading of some Zelda Fanfic called Counting Stars to spur me into wanting to make my own world, thus, [V1](https://imgur.com/a/5zMGhje) was born. I wanted to make something that had a bit of everything... and my own twist. It was a map before Ganondorf took over.

Then, naturally, I created V2 and V3 to handle the Era of Ganondorf. At that time, each Version was a year. So 3 years of change across Hyrule. Ganondorf reigning for 2 years before his defeat, and each version added new locations as people ""moved around and set up refugee towns"". It also led to [V4](https://imgur.com/a/Knvh93M) which I assumed would be the final version, until...

I posted it on a roleplay forum on reddit and got the attention of what I would say a person who proposed a very different idea, starting at the end of the V3 map and entering V4 (so we start at Ganondorfs defeat)

Some events occur, and I guess I got a bit crazy when i made the next version, dubbing the previous the 'Temporary Golden Age' because it doesn't last. This was now the Era (Version) of great Boss monsters raiding the regions and a Empire at War styled take (or Hyrule Conquest for ya who know it) fight across Hyrule to reclaim the regions... [V5](https://imgur.com/a/VzVGCAq). All because the resurrection destiny was disrupted, que Demise coming to cause a correction.

We won't talk about *that* map. After the Beast Wars, what I truly believed was the final map was [V6](https://imgur.com/a/KDvosrS). Everything peaceful, occasional boss, more drama and politics focused, etc etc. Mind you, that rp is still ongoing. V6 was made roughly 2 months ago. (1 year 4 months from the original background map estimated.). 

However, I started looking at it last night, new years eve, and realizing that it looked... Bad. I knew it looked bad. I was just blinded by pride. Bad shapes, bad sizes, cluttered, tilted text among so many other issues.... I stepped back and from about midnight to 7am I created the newest version, drawing on my newly learned knowledge of my editing app that I'd been slowly getting better at over the years.

Finally, the post is the product of those 7 hours of nonstop working on it this morning. The start of my year.

It's come a long way, and this is what i meant. I am overjoyed with the new look, but will ALWAYS take suggestions. Thank you if you read this!"

Everything from simply citizenry to Sheikah clan, royal knights, Goron Problems all the way to being apart of Ganondorf's forces and such. Snippets of stories throughout time, is best to say.

Story would be a more linear, traditional Zelda plot of the Hero rising from his small town, learning of his destiny, saving the country. I plan on Zelda being the lead of a resistance against Ganondorf on a citizen level under the name Sheik as another callback, and, so she isn't just hanging around until the end (same with the citizens who want their lives back!). Link doing it a divine way as usual, freeing the regions, vanquishing beasts. I would hope it be a grittier story, a story of true struggle and (possible) victory.

A for the post flair itself in regards to you.

While in your title write NB or Nonbinary.

So just say looking for female

A4F (as your flair)

Then in your post title

(Nonbinary for Female) WhateverYourRpTitleIs
(Nb4F) WhateverYourRpTitle

RoleplayPartnerSearch,fcpslem,t3_eigiyk,1577871232.0,"Hey there! The flairs are in regards to who is 'playing' what in an rp or the person themself!

Individually, the letters and meaning;

**M - Male**

**F - Female**

**GM - Game Master (Dungeon Master)**

**A - Anyone**


So, with your example of M4F, it means that a Male (M) is searching for (4) a Female (F) partner to rp with! M4F

Where M4M (Male for Male), F4F (Female for Female). The person posting the search will *Always* be first in these acronyms. 

With A, it can get a bit more tricky. M4A means Male for Anyone --- basically Male for Male or Female! 

However, sometimes people say A and then specify it further. **M4A** is the flair, but they may say in the text M4A playing F. 

That basically means that they are searching for a male or female to play Female, regardless of what they are IRL

---

Finally, GM, is something derived from DnD called a Dungeon Master who is someone who doesn't have a main character, but, plays the most important role of making the story, guiding the player (partner in this case) and typically playing a very wide range of side characters instead of sharing the burden in a typical pairing above.

-

Side Note; 

**Fu - Futa** (Hermaphrodite) may pop up as well

**Tr / Tra - Trans** (Transgender) a lot less likely, not usually.

Though they do not have flairs due to not being popular rp points here, you can write them in your title though and use 'A' for those and specify it!"

TLDR; Learning Curve, toxicity, *sparse* glitches.

Overall, yes, but there are some things to know before that may turn that into a no. Which I'll touch upon because obviously 1.1k is a bit bias, but I'll try and identify some key turn offs.

It takes time to learn, but I dont mean that in a ""you must learn or you'll fail"". Its totally great to experience it blind and learn as you play...

It is and is not like your traditional shooter. There is a lot to learn and at first it is definitely going to seem crazy. Frustrating. And downright ridiculous (still is to me, sometimes). However, same premise, the major challenges are Map learning and Op/Gadget recognition. Which, can be helped with custom games or reading up on it... also, casual play, just seeing them over time and just playing for fun will definitely help. But map learning and shooting is the same as any shooter, the individual operators, their strengths, their weaknesses is what complicates the matter.

We can bring A and B ... but they brought X which means that we need OUR C to counter X who is countering B who assists A. (Bc we dont want to risk a or b)

It can get intricate, but other times the key person (maybe a hard breacher or someone with the defuser) just Leroy Jenkins it and rush in without a care, dies, and makes things a ton more difficult to pull off. But it's always possible. And sometimes those victories are more rewarding... and sometimes no strat is the most fun.

Wide range // gadgetry; Since I started, they doubled the playable roster for both attacking and defending, which means there are more counters and more than 1 solution to a problem. I had the joy of slowly taking it all in... you wouldn't (until the new seasons!). It would all be new, which isn't inherently bad, but will take some time to get used to and definitely be difficult to discern who is what and not only scared of being shot but suddenly you walk through a door and it explodes because of a small box on a doorframe that you hadn't seen (cue frustration) or a window with a bear trap below it for when you jump through. But, after it happens once or twice you'll learn to check. 

The voice chat fanbase can be a bit toxic at times, but, there will be plenty of beautiful moments where you and your teammates will communicate perfectly and win, and you'll feel amazing.

The occasional glitch; this can be funny or enraging, in one example it was a 2 to 2 that means whoever wins the current round would win. My mate and I were weaving toward the objective and we suddenly dropped dead. Only to reveal our enemy had somehow been smushed to the flatness of a pancake and looked terrifying with bulging eyes, and shot us. I laughed at it... my buddy was pissed. We lost. Glitches like that or other things aren't common, please don't think they are, but they can happen. As with any game.

So overall it can keep you on your toes for a very long time, as you never know who they will bring until a round or two in and you can find a pattern (if any!) So if you're fine some linearity, some randomness, and some occasional issue (due to teammates, enemies, or glitches)... you'll do just fine and dandy.

Personally, I love the game. I love the unknown factors of it, where some more namebrand shooters have a class and a small range of guns... you still know what to expect. But this, you can see a wall of shields or a dude swinging a hammer at you, and you wont know until you see them. It's My favourite shooter, but it takes some time to learn. 

I recommend finding ""Your ops"" 2-3 attackers and 2-3 defenders you find *the most fun to play* and focus on them, but, still learn to play a hard breacher or counterer, just incase you need it."
unpopularopinion,fbz26xa,t3_ef48yx,1577232848.0,"Absolutely agree. I've been at least 80 pounds overweight for the past 3 years (5'10', 16-18 yo, 255), and it kills me. I can't look at myself, I wear much bigger clothing, I dont stand in photos (I offer and insist to take them)... I don't want to date anyone so they wouldn't have to be embarrassed or feel my fat. I don't even seem as big as others... but still.

I hate it (myself for getting to that size), i also hate people saying you should he positive or whatever. Sure, love yourself, but recognize your mistakes and try and fix yourself. Not love the mistake.

For a happier note; since I started college 3 months ago I've *lost* 30 pounds to bring me to about 225... so, I'm happier, but I still recognize i have along way to go"

Upbeat song and happiness but the lyrics are about a dancer and a bartender who are madly in love, some ass comes by and starts talking up the dancer, makes the bartender angry and when a fist starts he just shoots the bartender. Killing him, and leaving the dancer a hollow husk who spends the rest of her life clinging to the past in the club where he died."
