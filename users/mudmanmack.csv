If I said ""yeah it woulda been okay if she had shot him to death"" I can't turn around and say ""wellllll she didn't actually do it, so it's not like I said it's okay.""

And I'm not saying the embarrassing moment is what would be harmful to his self image, it's the results of it. For the sake of arguement, let's say that every sexually active person has experience a similar moment. That doesn't mean every sexually active person has gone from going out on a very nice date with someone who clicks well and has a great interest in you to being ghosted because of something that happened which you had little to no control over but is stigmatized. It's harmful, end of story. Suggesting someone should do it is shitty and there's no way around that fact."

It's not a light decision, and when someone does it it's to end what they see as suffering not to end what they see as things they don't wanna do. 

Is living your life in a fuckton of debt from a rigged economy a responsibility?
Is feeling like an isolated outcast who never seems to connect to other people a responsibility?
Is living just so you don't hurt the people around you a responsibility?
Is going through the motions of an endlessly boring and unrewarding life just so you can scrape by another week a responsibility?

The answer is no, to every single on of those.

Boiling it down to trying to avoid responsibility is disgustingly offensive to people who are or have been suicidal.  It also makes it harder to talk to people about being suicidal because only ""cowards"" would even think of it"
AskReddit,fdt70sv,t1_fdt1taw,1578712753.0,"How does that make it worse in the slightest?

nextfuckinglevel,fdsbgq2,t1_fdro13g,1578698769.0,"I'm saying that in a fight, this is useless. Throwing back and forth roundhouse kicks would do about as much damage as a good stiff cross. These kicks aren't for power, they're for speed and reach and therefore shouldnt be seen as anything that would do much damage. 

There's a very good reason that there's a major transition period between point fighting and kickboxing let alone MMA.  Yes you can point spar, my point is that people don't quite understand how it translates to actual fighting. 

Finally, you don't know me, don't act like you know how much I know about the topic. I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I've competed in national tournaments point sparring."
