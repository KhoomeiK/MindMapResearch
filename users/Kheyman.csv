I often mistake people for couples considering how close they are standing next to each other while ""waiting in line"".

I want to say it's slightly better in more affluent settings, but that's not true.

The following is more based on my personal opinion, but queing up has never seem to be part of the Chinese mentality in its millennia long history. Mostly you have to fight and push to the front if you want something. This applies whether you are talking about cultural representations of ancient times, or historical texts documenting the achievements of stories heroes. In Chinese culture, if you want something, you have to seize it. Again though, this paragraph is just my interpretation, so take that with a handful of salt."

Interpretation:

To your regular Chinese, this reads like stupid things that teenage girl say, when they are too caught up in their own world to understand what they are actually conveying."

A lot of the tourists, or clients you find in major Chinese cities, are best classified under the Nouveau Riche category. A derogatory, but fitting, label for the disrespectful Chinese you've come across. The rest of us dislike them as much as any foreigner.

If you meet mainlanders who grew up privileged, you'll find that they are infinitely better at observing proper customs. And if you meet rural farmers, you'll find them to be really down-to-earth people who are genuinely kind to others. China is a pretty big place, and the terrible people you've came across are just a segment of our society."

People that have received legally enforced punishments usually suffer their fate not because of any particular evil committed, but because of their stance against those in charge.

ABoringDystopia,fctt1yw,t1_fcqjldq,1577958031.0,"Forcing children to engage in an activity and punishing them for wanting to quit is horrendous. But it's important to recognize that this viewpoint is heavily influenced by culture. 

My Chinese friend grew up in a similar situation, and had to sacrifice any semblance of a regular childhood for table tennis. He hated it. But now that he's grown up, working as a doctor, and happily married (to another doctor), he is grateful to his parents for never letting him quit. This gratefulness is tied to Chinese' understanding of familial responsibility. From this worldview, he was able to succeed in his life, entirely because his parents ""management"" of his childhood taught him dedication. He succeeded because his parents are responsible.

All that is to say, given that the child in the article is Chinese, she may very well grow up to be a happy functioning adult who appreciates what her parents did for her. It may seem unbelievable from a Western perspective, but that doesn't make it less true."
