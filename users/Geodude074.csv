offmychest,ff73utv,t3_erz2bv,1579640585.0,"Things white people never have to experience:

Walking down the street minding your own business, only to be arrested because you aren’t white and therefore look dangerous.

Enter a store and have management and employees tailgate you while you shop because they think you’re going to steal something.

Fear for your life every time a police officer pulls you over.

Have old white ladies cross the street in fear just to avoid you.

Grow up with and tolerate constant racist jokes, slurs, bullying, social rejection just because you’re not white.

Only have token representation in Hollywood, they’ll never make a main movie starring a male of your race. Only white guys get to be superheros, unless the movie is a mostly black cast or the character is specifically not white to make a racial point.

Have people scream “GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY” even though you were born here.

Have landlords and people selling houses refuse to sell to your parents because they don’t want you in their neighborhood.

Listen to the struggles your parents and grandparents faced in the past 30-60 years just because of their race.

Witness all of this growing up on a near daily basis then go on reddit and see white people say “White privilege doesn’t exist.”"
depression,fepa1dj,t3_eq988w,1579315505.0,"You need out.

When I was 13 I had completely given up on life, I stopped going to school for about 6 months and was incarcerated in “juvenile detention” and put into the state system. That was my ticket out, and it changed my life for the better. Not saying you should do the same thing, but you need out of your family, your school, you need a completely new environment to thrive.

My suggestion is to talk to your school counselor and let them know you don’t feel safe at home and you cannot go back home that same day. Explain why to the best of your ability. They’ll take it from there."

You’ve been through a traumatic experience and it will take time and effort to heal and recover. Things won’t magically work out in a year like you see on TV.

Leaving an abusive relationship was definitely the right call to make, even though you’re going through hell right now. You got out alive. Not everyone is so fortunate.

Your friends and family are shit for not supporting you, I’m sorry.

Tinder is for hookups and causal sex only. It’s the wrong place to be looking for anything meaningful.

Have you tried joining AA? I’ve heard through friends that it’s an amazing support group, a life changer.

And lastly, you are not alone. There are people who are willing and open to listening to you and helping you through your journey. You’ve got friends here."

depression,fep67m2,t3_eq9llo,1579313039.0,"I politely disagree. Saying “I know how you feel” doesn’t invalidate someone’s feelings. Invalidating someone’s feelings is when someone says what you’re feeling isn’t valid, such as “You have no reason to be sad” or “You’re just being dramatic/pessimistic/impatient/immature.”

Saying “I know how you feel” immediately communicates several things. 1. It shows the other person is listening. 2. It shows the other person is emphasizing. 3. It shows that you are not alone. 4. It shows they’re making an effort to help.

Pain is subjective sure, but there are thousands of people on this subreddit alone who suffer from depression. Do you ever go through and read their posts? If you do, you’ll notice a common theme in their symptoms. Thinking that nobody else can relate to how you’re feeling is objectively incorrect.

Also, a lot of people feel better just knowing that someone else can relate. That’s one reason why this subreddit exists. Knowing that other people are experiencing the same thing and that you are not alone is a powerfully comforting feeling. It may not help you but it certainly helps others.

So do say “I know how you feel”, there’s nothing wrong with doing so. For a lot of patients in therapy, just having someone to talk to is therapy in itself, having someone else listen and care and be understanding and accepting. In OP’s case, he needs more than empathy for help, nothing wrong with that either."

lonely,fdm5qgy,t3_elwt5a,1578540448.0,"Some advice for you.

1. Don’t rely on motivation to get things done. Motivation is fleeting and unreliable. Instead, just force yourself to do it even when you don’t want to. The hardest part is starting, once you start doing it, it won’t seem so bad.

2. Going out, meeting people, attempting to make friends... all of it is very anxious and uncomfortable, but you have to force yourself out of your comfort zone. If you can, try to meet people with similar interests as yours and force yourself to talk to them. Just be nice, make small talk, ask them questions about them, and you’ll avoid seeming awkward.

3. Don’t feel bad about returning home from college. It’s better to not go to school and not waste your time and money, if you don’t know what you want to do yet.

4. Don’t compare your life to your sister’s or anyone else’s. All you’ll do is become depressed if you constantly compare your shortcomings to other people’s success. Instead, focus on the improvements you’ve made and your next step in improving."

The dynamic between Abrahamic religions and Buddhism is the polar opposite of each other, it’s really interesting.

When you two first met you revealed you had a crush, and she revealed she did not feel the same way about you. From that moment forward you should have understood and accepted that she only sees you as a friend. Women who only view men as friends always tell them “I wish my bf was more like you” or “Any woman would be lucky to have you”. You are her shoulder to lean on while she sleeps with other men.

It’s a tough lesson to learn, but you still had 5 years of amazing friendship, right? If you value her as a friend, you will continue to be her friend. But if what you want is sex and you’re finally understanding that you’ll never get it from her, then yeah it’s time to move on.

Edit: I misread your post sorry, I thought you said you told her from the beginning you had a crush on her."

lonely,fct9kae,t3_eishlp,1577936541.0,"You did nothing wrong. She used you for cuddles though, sorry bro but it’s the truth. My advice is since you revealed your feelings to her and she told you she’s not interested, just move on. There’s nothing you can do to win her over or change how she feels about you."

SuicideWatch,fcmfq0s,t3_ehyjw4,1577773563.0,"I feel you bro. My family and friends don’t understand my depression either, but that’s expected. They’re normal healthy people and they have no idea what it’s like to wake up and lay there for hours until you find motivation to finally get out of bed. They aren’t trained professionals, so I don’t expect them to understand, I don’t even burden them with my problems anymore.

Every day I fear for my job because I know I’m in a downward spiral. I get no sleep, I’m a fucking zombie on autopilot every day and eventually I’m going to crash and burn.

The only motivation to not kill myself is because I know my suicide will traumatize my family forever, the people who depend on me. I’ve always been their pillar of strength, and for it to collapse would devastate them forever.

So here I am, scouring the internet for people who are just fucked up, depressed, lonely, and suicidal as me. It actually gives me a little comfort knowing I’m not alone.

You’re not alone."
