photography,ff1m62g,t3_er39qp,1579481467.0,"Looking set some of the pics you’ve posted previously, none of them look like they were taken in great light so I don’t think it’s your gear or post processing. You need to recognise scenes that look great in reality, then you have somewhere to start. Getting good light isn’t easy though, you either need to be really persistent, lucky, or preferably both."

photography,fdely3k,t1_fdejk2h,1578341821.0,">	The hard skills needed to paint are the equivalent to knowing how to get a proper exposure on a camera.

Are they though? As a technical person, I found the exposure side of things trivial to learn, as do a lot of other technical people (as in, IT geeks, that type of person). In photography it’s the composition, timing, and light that takes the skill. 

People who can paint don’t seem to fit the technical mould, they just seem like the more creative types. Same with musicians, writers etc. 

I dunno, it just seems photography is different than other arts. Sure there are some genuinely creative photographers that do things I would call artistic, but for most part I don’t think of photographers that way."

photography,fde8dn7,t1_fdd7x7e,1578333424.0,"I guess so, but I’d consider it a small artistic skill. A painter has to compose a scene and paint it, and I’d say 90% of the skill would be in the actual painting rather than composition."
photography,fdd1o2e,t3_ekniwo,1578291251.0,"Nope. Zero artistic talent. I’m not even sure my photographic skills count as artistic. I think I just know what looks pleasing to the eye and can replicate similar things with a camera. But I’m not actually creating anything, just capturing it well."

Unless you’re specially trying to copy someone else’s style (why??) and you think your raw files are as good as the other photographer’s (otherwise you’d be putting lipstick on a pig), then I wouldn’t bother paying."
