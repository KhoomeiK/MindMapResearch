Because close combat + behemoth bash is decently strong neutral coverage, you really only need 1 other coverage move and can run metal burst to give it options against Pokemon it doesn't deal with well. 

I had also considered screens because of its combination of bulk and speed, but forgot that the item slot was being utilized already."

stunfisk,ff4a4vf,t3_era8jm,1579558872.0,"This might be kind of an odd thought, but I think adamant on your dragapult might be nice to have.  Adamant still lets you outspeed other dragapults while giving you more power to break through walls.  

If you want to replace drill (which I agree with since you have toad and cinderace), I would look at something like rotom-mow.  That would give you another volt turn abuser and complete a fire water grass core for your team.  Nasty plot or trick scarf can help you break down defensive teams you claim to struggle with too.

Other team details I'd look at:

If you want throat spray toxtricity, run it with a speed boosting move like shift gear, otherwise specs is prefered.  Run mystical fire on your hatterne and consider calm mind or trick room (if you can find the room for it).  I don't think giga drain is a great option as most water types don't want to mess with hatterne anyway."

stunfisk,feepugm,t1_feekrqw,1579038688.0,"I think you misunderstand my point.  It doesn't need to be countered because so many teams are naturally prepared for it.  There is/was a popular balance core that Clef absolutely destroys, but most teams have a natural answer to it.  

Both rotom-heat and Sylveon are strong independently of Clefable.  Offense pressures clef to the point that it really doesn't do much unless you find a free switch and even then, Excadrill, Toxtricity, Rotom heat, etc can switch in a couple of times in a game.  Band dugtrio actually beats clef somehow according to some viability rankings commentor (this is something I'd like to see for myself), so it has that to worry about too. 

Obviously as a caveat, Clef is great.  If I was ranking threats, it would be above Seismitoad in A+.  It's splashable, it compresses roles to allow a couple of unique builds, it's slightly unpredictable, it keeps two of the more powerful threats in the meta in check and it can be good at pressuring balance.  I just don't think it does any of that at a metagame defining level and its pretty easy to pressure out of being effective."
stunfisk,fednkhr,t1_fecoejx,1579015846.0,"Going down the viability rankings, it just doesn't have enough positive matchups to justify S for me.

stunfisk,fecmzx2,t3_eofqbi,1578977962.0,"So...I know this is an unpopular opinion, but Clefable is overrated.  Clef is really good; I get it, but S is a joke to me.  I feel like that's an overreaction to a very specific build that was popular post Darmanitan in the upper ranks of the ladder.  

The meta has already adapted to this thing and this ranking feels like a late reaction to where Clef was and not where it is.  I bet it falls back to A+ in the very next viability ranking.  It does not feel like it is even all that close to the level of Corviknight to me."

GetMotivated,fdkccqb,t1_fdjn9x0,1578500886.0,"Actually, that was far from my game.  My game is to merely get you to think.  I'm not trying to refute the relationship you set in front of me (as that would take a ton of research that frankly isn't  worth it and likely wouldn't convince you of anything anyway as what you state is more than likely fact).  My game was merely to introduce you to the problem of not having an open mind.

Of course the concept of gravity holds, but the article isn't about the physics but rather the people challenging the physics.  Dr. Eugene Podkletnov was at one point looked down on for his declaration that he had found a way to reduce the effects of gravity, but now his work is fairly well regarded now that it is more understood and may actually further solidfy the gravitational relationship that you describe.

Things like dark matter are also fascinating to look at and may never have been considered if we hadn't questioned why galaxies don't follow our models for gravitational force.  I could be wrong in this instance, but it seems like this further solidifies the gravitational relationship we currently know, but gave us even more insight to the universe.

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to provide a better example, but it's the ability to question what you know that is being pushed by this philosophy not that there is no such thing as fact or even that we don't know what is and isn't true."

As an example: Flat-earthers believe that it is a FACT that the Earth is flat.  Because they have established this ""fact,"" they are not able to accept anything that contradicts that the Earth is flat. 

As a more personal example, I have a difficult time keeping an open mind to the keto diet.  Tons of people swear by it, but it contradicts my understanding nutrition so I have a difficult time accepting that it might be anything more than a fad diet (which it may or may not be I have no clue).  

Heck, most scientific discoveries were made because people challenged ""fact.""  I bet you think the Earth revolves around the sun.  Now, before you roll your eyes, the point the Earth revolves around is very close to the sun, but it actually revolves around the center of mass of the solar system.  Now the day to day understanding of this concept probably doesn't affect much, but this distinction can actually make a difference in the way we perceive our world.  

To be honest, I'm a bit off track at this point, but the point is that I don't perceive the philosophy to be outdated in this instance."

- Tanks prefer HP since that helps cover both physical and special hits

- Walls prefer defensive investment as each individual point of defense matters more for taking hits.  This may not seem important, but you may want to hit certain speed tiers with your walls that may take investment from elsewhere

- High HP mons prefer defensive investment while low HP mons prefer HP investment

- HP should meet certain divisibility requirements, so sometimes you may want to split the investment even if HP is prefered (I'm not a very good authority on what those are, but at level 100, you rarely want to dump your last 4 EVs in HP)

- If you need to be able to take specific hits, it is better to invest in defenses as it won't require as much investment generally speaking

In Pincurchin's case, I would invest in HP"
