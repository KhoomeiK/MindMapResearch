Somehow this throwaway comment has sparked its own little culinary spat. 

The linked comment that this whole post centers on is about NOT using a pressure cooker because you can make soup in a saucepan on the stove in 25 minutes. Yes, I am aware of their existence and benefits, but didn’t see the need to address them. 

In my humble, non-chef opinion, good soups take longer than 25 minutes. I did not intend to address every sort of soup. I’m terribly sorry for saying “Any soup.” Clearly I was being hasty and flippant. Enjoy your miso, zucchini, and any and all quick-cook soups you want."
