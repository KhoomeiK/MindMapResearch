The MB 145 is similar to the Pelikan, really smooth (smoother than the Pelikan in my experience), really wet, but not fine at all when compared to Japanese pens.

Chin ups actually require really open shoulders. If your shoulders don’t have that mobility, the movement has to come from somewhere...either the elbow or the wrist. Sounds like your body is compensating by putting extra strain on your wrist. I would try neutral grip (palms facing in) or rings for the time being, those require less range of motion (rings allow for full ROM, but they rotate with you). While you work that grip, work on opening your shoulders in that range of motion.

To work that mobility, try doing a forearm plank with your forearms totally parallel to each other. If it’s hard for you to keep your forearms parallel (hands want to come in towards each other), that’d be a great thing to work on). You can also do overhead tricep stretches while squeezing a yoga block between your hands/forearms. Lots of stuff online, I imagine if you search yoga block shoulder opening you’ll get a ton of videos."

1. Your pinky and ring finger aren’t as grounded as your other fingers and as a result your outer forearms aren’t engaged and your wrists are taking the force instead.

2. Your elbows are spiraling outward which is making your outer wrists get jammed up. Looking at your wrists you’ll see that painful area wrinkling up because of the compression there. To counter this, spiral your forearms into towards each other, or you can think about spinning the inner eyes of your elbows forward. Like turning your biceps out (external rotation).

Let me know if any of this helps. Good luck."

It’s a long term practice. Learn more and more about yourself and your body every time you get on your mat.

A lot of those “skinny” yoga bodies you see in class started off in a similar place to where you’re at, they just kept showing up and eventually their body adapted to the practice.
