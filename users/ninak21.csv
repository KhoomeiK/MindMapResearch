Anxiety,ff886f7,t3_es6ab4,1579668794.0,"You are not alone my friend. It’s almost 6 am where I live and am browsing this subreddit for the exact reason you just described. I’ve also had this horrible anxiety since Saturday. Trust me though, I’ve had this so many times before and it does always pass and it will pass this time. I know it sucks in the moment but you’re gonna get through this."

interestingasfuck,ff5tvrg,t3_erpgjh,1579610062.0,This hurts my stomach for som reason
socialanxiety,ff2uqo2,t3_erc7p8,1579524938.0,"Thank you so much for this, I really needed to hear that"
lordoftherings,feohs3z,t3_eq4isv,1579300414.0,I have this set too! I just wish they were a tad bigger but they’re stunning regardless
socialanxiety,femm35z,t1_femifwk,1579262124.0,"I can relate so much to everything you said! It’s hard for me too to find people I relate to and the fact that I freeze up around everyone who isn’t my direct family doesn’t help with that at all. It’s weird because I’m introverted but still quite talkative and usually have a lot of thoughts that I want to share with people I’m comfortable with but in any other situation my brain is just empty and it’s like my whole personality with all my memories are gone. Which leads to conversations usually dying after a few sentences. What really made a difference for me in this situation was that the guy I was talking about was quite introverted himself and even a little awkward at times which lowered the pressue of having to be “normal” for me. We also had a lot of common interests and of course the fact that I was with my family helped a lot to feel more safe I guess. If it had been a very loud, outgoing person with less things in common this definitely could’ve gone very differently. So yeah it’s really nice to find people like that once in a while!"
ihavesex,felcm6d,t1_fekypcv,1579219028.0,Also that. But in the context of a hook up it makes at least a little more sense to have a dildo on hand than a pregnancy test.
ihavesex,fek8djl,t3_ep85ld,1579194741.0,This was kind of cute until I saw the pregnancy test
socialanxiety,fedj42x,t3_enr9it,1579012829.0,"Yes, this is basically what turned shyness into social anxiety for me. When I was a kid I’ve had multiple adults tell me off for being rude because I didn’t talk much which only made me more anxious to talk and eventually it turned into a full blown disorder :)"
socialanxiety,fedii5s,t3_eofs15,1579012394.0,Friends????
MaladaptiveDreaming,fe8nemi,t1_fe7i1sz,1578928257.0,"I think you read my reply wrong, he didn’t seem interested in me. I was very interested but he would constantly ignore me or reply days late and whenever we tried to make plans to meet he would kind of just brush if off. At one point I was fed up and I told him I didn’t see the point of talking anymore because of this so then we just stopped. He clearly didn’t care so I feel like by contacting him again I would be disrespecting myself"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fe6yn19,t3_enzjgo,1578907800.0,This has been a huge struggle for me for the past couple of months. And the funny thing is that he wasn’t even my ex but just a guy I talked to for about two months through a dating app before cutting him off because he  didn’t seem all that interested. I just can’t get him out of my head and I keep daydreaming about all kinds of scenarios where we would be together. I can’t listen to love songs anymore because it’ll send me into an hour long daydreaming session about this guy whom I haven’t even met!! It’s beyond annoying but I can’t stop it
dating_advice,fe6wpi6,t3_enxbre,1578906793.0,"This is true. I’ve been on both ends of being the self deprecating person and dating self deprecating people and honestly, it’s a turn off. Plain and simple. 

I’ve talked to guys on dating apps who told me they were boring, awkward, ugly etc. as one of the first things they told me about themselves and it usually puts me off a person more than I’d like to admit because I know this is merely coming from a place of insecurity and it often doesn’t even reflect reality. 

There’s nothing wrong with talking about your insecurities, that’s good even! (though maybe not upon first meeting a person) But there’s a way to do this without putting yourself down."
tolkienfans,fe5xhni,t1_fe3nzgg,1578877132.0,Good point!

socialskills,fdvu11x,t1_fdvmi6r,1578751489.0,I don’t think it’s about shooting every advice down. It’s the patronizing way of giving “advice” OP has that people who suffer from anxiety have to deal with daily already from the people around them. Yes I absolutely believe positive thinking and actively changing your thought patterns is a super important step to overcoming anxiety but it takes a lot of time to rewire your brain especially if you’ve had the thought patterns that are fueling your anxiety for years. “Just stop caring and get over it!” is likely not gonna do anything for most people on here because anxiety recovery is a lot more complicated than that.
socialskills,fdvr2gj,t3_en3c9l,1578750552.0,Wow wish I had thought about this earlier! All those years of crippling social anxiety for nothing! Thanks I’m cured!
YouShouldKnow,fdq8i2j,t3_emlplf,1578659214.0,"I’ve had severe social anxiety since middle school (i’m 21 now) and pretty much all the friends i’ve had from that point on have told me they found me very unapproachable and bitchy at first and they never thought I could be so different once they started to get to know me. It’s upsetting because I want to be social and approachable so bad :( It takes a lot for me to speak up or even say hello to someone but I still make the effort to do it as much as I can. I always smile at people when I say hello but 9/10 times they’ll look at me like a chair just started talking to them and often they don’t even greet me back. I don’t know what about my behavior is making people react to me this way, it’s so frustrating. Maybe they can feel my nervousness and it’s weirding them out or something. That’s my only explanation."
socialskills,fdmwreo,t3_em4b18,1578569340.0,Funny thing is that a lot of people might be thinking the same about you. We have a very different perception of ourselves compared to others and it’s often way more negative in our heads. You might be convinced you’re socially awkward while other people wouldn’t think so at all
socialanxiety,fcvf0lv,t1_fcv1ezp,1578000720.0,Same. I wish there was medication that had the exact effects of alcohol but without the bad stuff like addiction...that would treat the whole problem for me.
dating_advice,fcr64ta,t3_eicfpb,1577897342.0,"Not a man, but I’m currently dating a guy who’s around 5’5 and I’m 5’8 and neither of us care. He actually told me he thinks it’s kinda hot lol"
socialanxiety,fbg69ik,t3_ed2373,1576836593.0,5 minutes? More like 50.
