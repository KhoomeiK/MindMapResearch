I take it you‚Äôve never had any psychedelic or hallucinogenic experiences by how baseless your comment is.

Some of the best trips I‚Äôve had I remember none of other than being in an alternate dimension.

I also recommend therapy. It‚Äôs changed my entire life."
SuicideWatch,fd6siif,t1_fd6qcgi,1578195170.0,"When you‚Äôre unsure what to do, sometimes doing nothing is exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do.

You don‚Äôt expect a new student in foreign language to ace the test without preparation.

Give yourself time to learn the things you‚Äôre good at, the things you‚Äôre okay at, the things you‚Äôre not so good at and then how to line up their priorities.  Once you‚Äôve done that you‚Äôre much better prepared to make a decision on whether to do or not do, or maybe continue doing nothing.  

It‚Äôs not idle time if you‚Äôre investing in being better prepared for your next decision.

Try reading my previous comment from your ex bf perspective, then again reread it from your perspective, then reread it from your moms perspective.  It might astound you how different the answers seem to be.

We are all on different paths, with each one of us learning lessons differently than others.  Allow yourself to human, as you allow others to do.

When someone around me is having a bad day, I give them a break because I have bad days too.  If I denied them the most basic  privilege I give myself am I prohibiting their possibility to surprise me?  They might just teach me something üëåüèº"
SuicideWatch,fd6pwc3,t1_fd6e3ps,1578194277.0,"I‚Äôve found in my life experience that I become (similarly identify) who I spend most of time around.  If it‚Äôs negative people, ergo negative mindset. 

Conversely, if I am alone all of the time and I beat myself up with most of my thoughts, then reason has it I‚Äôll probably feel less than most of the time.
If you‚Äôre your only influence then that can be catastrophic or catalyzing.

In my self-sabotaging days I isolated into what I call a shell of a human being.  I wore masks to fit in with the room I found myself in.   I had no absolute value of who I was deep down to propel me when I making myself the victim.  I learned to not listen to all of the thoughts I was having and focused on becoming someone who might have less of those thoughts.

I cannot think myself into better living, but I CAN live myself into better thinking. 

The person who exiled you might be looking out for their #1, which is themselves.  If that is the case then I have no reason to knock them for being selfish.  At the end of the day I decide who gets a seat at my table.   What are you bringing to my table that justifies yourself a seat?

Am I enough in my own mind to quantify the reasons I deserve a seat at someone else‚Äôs table?  Am I enough in my own mind to deserve a spot at MY TABLE?  

If I don‚Äôt feel I am valuable enough to sit at my own table, then maybe I need to re-evaluate how I am calculating my contributions.  

Am I asking too much of myself and depreciating the assets I do have in turn?  Am I willing to admit I‚Äôm growing and will have growing pains?  Am I strong enough to give myself the okay to be not okay right now?  Am I persistent enough to work towards being-okay with not being-okay until I discover how I can be-okay?  

Are my efforts to seek validation outside of myself intrinsically futile if someone else has an untold standard and expectation I must reach, without them telling me their standards outright? 

If I judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, am I not allowing it live it‚Äôs whole life believing it‚Äôs a failure, because my standards are not properly set??

I must ask myself these questions often.  I hope you will do some asking yourself questions soon.   You might find the answers surprise you, and you might find the rubric is less than ideal."
SuicideWatch,fcwddl4,t3_ej4wzo,1578022811.0,"My best friend decided to kill himself when we were in 12th grade.  I always went over to his house after school.  He had been absent that day, so I went to see him.
I was super close with his family and when I got there I just walked in.  I found him in his room upstairs unconscious with a belt around his neck and pillow over his head.   
I called an ambulance.

He was in a coma for several days as he eaten about $70 worth of rat poison and binge drank.
I found out in the days between that his parents decided to split up earlier that week.  
The day before he made his decision he came home from school to find his mom had decided to take her own life.  He saw an ambulance outside their home driving away when he was pulling home from school.
Their neighbors had to tell him his mom had left a voicemail on their home phone about committing suicide and to tell her kids when they got home.   The neighbors had called the ambulance.
His dad a chronic alcoholic didn‚Äôt go visit him in the hospital and his sister went to visit family in Alabama.  My best friends and I sat in that hospital room every day to hope he got better.  We prayed to a God we didn‚Äôt know existed.  We cried. A lot.
Clayton didn‚Äôt end up dying and went on to volunteer his time for a suicide hotline while he went to college for psychology.  He graduated.  He went to medical school. 
He now works for an organization that helps adolescents who have suicidal thoughts.
I would have never seen the beautiful cycle of life if he had died.  He is the reason I now say, ‚Äúthe rain makes you appreciate the sunshine that much more,‚Äù when people say they hate the rain.
Every time it rains I am grateful that he is still alive and has chosen to help people who are hurting.
Reach out to your friends.  I wish he would have.
I haven‚Äôt talked to him in almost 10 years, but by God I‚Äôll bet we would chat like it was yesterday if we saw each other.
I love you.
I love you broken.
I love you broken and hurting.
I love you broken and hurting no matter what.
I love you broken and hurting no matter what ever happens.
I love you broken and hurting no matter what ever happens I promise."
