For a short period this year was the first time that it seemed like a majority of the people in this sub wanted to rebuild. However, in the last few weeks it seems like it's flipped back to wanting the playoffs and your post is a good example. You say you want to rebuild, but then say you'd be fine with making the playoffs and getting yet another mid-first round pick. 

We got incredibly lucky with Sekou and it's not likely to happen again. It's like how we built the one team in modern NBA history to win a championship without a top-10 player and now this sub thinks you don't need high-end talent to win. Sure it's possible, but it's incredibly unlikely the chances of us building another championship team without superstars or drafting another player with Sekou's potential with mid-first picks is extremely low. This was our one opportunity to get a high draft pick before Gores goes all-in on the playoffs again next year."

Denigrating an entire generation of people based simply on the years they were born is also identity politics. I'm sick of the ""okay boomer"" bullshit of dismissing anything a person born during a certain period of time is not something that a person who's calls themselves a Liberal should be doing. Liberals should be judging people based on their words and actions, not their age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. 

Talk shit about Republicans all you want because they have proven with their words and actions to not give a shit about how much Republicans are destroying our country and world, but there are plenty of people born during those years who are just as Liberal as you are.

When I'm copying notes I'm not processing even a tiny bit of the information. All my concentration is going into the copying individual words part and nothing is going to what the words actually mean in the context. When I'm done copying I can barely tell you any relevant information about what I just copied. I learn best by listening to people explain things and if I'm having to copy notes I'm concentrating on doing that instead of listening to what the person teaching me is saying. Anytime I had a teacher where note taking was mandatory I absolutely hated it and ended up learning less because I couldn't concentrate on what they were saying and copying the notes at the same time. It's actually funny because my sister is a teacher and I just had this conversation with her a couple of days ago.

It's great that you learn well that way, but you can't state for a fact that everyone has to learn best the way you personally do.

Edit: Gotta love people downvoting you because they learn a specific way and assume that everyone else has to be exactly like them. As I mentioned, it's a well known fact that people learn in different ways. That's one thing they certainly didn't learn by taking notes."

We showed the banks after the financial crisis that cheating pays. We have companies that weigh the cost of fixing deadly products against the cost of lawsuits from people's dead family members.

If you want to talk about 18 year olds not being mature enough to make the decision about something that can kill them many years down the line, then I have to assume you are against allowing anyone under 21 into the military where they can be killed before they are even legally able to smoke a cigarette?

It's not about cigarettes being good or bad, it's about the government telling adults what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. I'm not even saying porn, joining the military, or student loans should be illegal (though at least the first two years of college should be free), I'm simply saying it's not the government's place to be telling adults that they can't smoke a cigarette. I'm also complaining about the inconsistencies. 

Alcohol is a different story because it can cause multiple bad things. First it can kill you from a single night of drinking to much. It also causes people to make stupid decisions that can fuck up their life. They might decide to drive and their impaired motor functions can cause deadly accidents. They might do any number of other dangerous things. They might have unprotected sex and get a disease or get pregnant. Add to that the fact that the long-term health affects are terrible.

You're acting like I think 13 year olds should be able to smoke and that's simply not true. I just think that people who our society considers to be adults and can make a whole bunch of other adult decisions should be able to decide for themselves if they want to have a cigarette or not."

In fact I specifically said ""no country"" can trust any other country. I didn't say that the US could be trusted. There's a 100% chance that the US wouldn't give up all of our nukes and I fully support that because I'm not willing to risk our entire national sovereignty on the word of countries like Russia and China."
todayilearned,ff422rf,t1_ff304bk,1579553855.0,"We did have a monopoly for years and the only time we used them was to end a war that Japan started with us. We could have used them for world domination, but we didn't want that. The final casualty count after the two nukes was also far lower than if we would have done a ground invasion of Japan. Not only would a huge number of Americans have died, but way more Japanese citizens.

That all being said, I agree that no country should trust us to dismantle them all either. I 100% guarantee we wouldn't do it even if we said we did. The same goes for most other nuclear armed countries. Nukes work as a deterrent and you have a lot of security when you have the ability to say ""you attack us, we can destroy you."" The fact that there hasn't been a WWIII might actually have a lot to do with the fact that if WWIII were to happen everyone loses because of the nukes. Nuclear powers don't even get into full-blown wars because of the consequences. There have been minor skirmishes and proxy wars, but not direct full-blown wars."

Russia is currently trying to destabilize the world because they think it benefits them. The only reason Ukraine is even a country still is because of us and their other allies, but we'd be useless if Russia was the only country with nukes. They could have the entire world on their knees within hours if they were the only country that had them.

Its honestly insane to me how much faith you have in Putin to do the right thing if he was the only world leader with access to nukes."

Of course the Republicans will be a joke when it comes to Hunter Biden, but that's okay because I don't give a shit about Hunter Biden, I care about making sure Trump is President for another 4 years and the best way to do that is to get people to testify to his crimes. You're advocating for a show trial where zero new evidence comes out and Trump is immediately acquainted by a ""bipartisan"" (with no new evidence they won't get all the Democrats to convict) group of Senators. That's a massive win for Trump and increases his reelection chances. 

Sure Trump almost certainly won't be removed, but we can at least get more damaging information out there. You might say that the Democrats in the House can always keep investigating, but once he's acquitted that would just be horrible optics for the 2020 election. This entire thing is over after the Senate votes and I want as much evidence out there as possible before they do."
todayilearned,ff3z5t2,t1_ff3kx6x,1579552042.0,"Are you really comparing the US government in 1945 to modern day Russian and Chinese governments? You have a lot more trust in the Chinese and Russians governments than I do. The US disarming would be absolutely idiotic. Either one of those countries would be able to make the US government surrender within hours if they had nukes and we didn't. If you are willing to bet the entire US existence on the trusting Russia and China to do the right thing, then that's on you, but I'm not and neither is our government. Hell, even if we agreed to disarming, I guarantee you that the US government would do exactly what other countries would do and that's hide a whole bunch of nukes.

I'm sorry, but believing that we could eliminate all nukes is being incredibly naive to the way the world works."

Moses is a super important figure in Christianity and Islam, but he's the most important person in Judaism. It's not as simple as this, but an easy way to look at it is that Christianity was added on top of Judaism and Islam was added on top of both. In fact while Jesus is a huge figure in Islam, he's nothing special at all in Judaism. Jesus himself was Jewish and never even tried to start a new religion. All he wanted to do was be a good Jewish person. It wasn't until after his death that other people built Christianity on top of Jewish beliefs.

[This article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam) talks about how Muslims view Jesus."

mlb,ff2gcxn,t1_ff2b0k8,1579504959.0,I absolutely hate Trump and Altuve was one of my favorite players in the league because he has a great story and succeeded against the odds for a player his size. I've been extremely critical of all the Astros including him. The only reason he might be getting more attention is because he's their biggest star (at least batter) and won the AL MVP the year they got caught cheating. It has absolutely nothing to do with his race and suggesting so is ridiculous.

If any one country has nukes and the rest don't, then that country is **BY FAR** the most powerful country on Earth and could easily bring the rest of the world to their knees. Nukes are a whole different level of power and the ones they have now are a hell of a lot more powerful than the ones we dropped on Japan. We're talking like 1000 times more powerful."
