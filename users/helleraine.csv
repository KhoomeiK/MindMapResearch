I personally had an issue with the level of anamorphism that allowed OP to continue to allow their dogs to be badgered, have fights, etc. I think most people in that thread felt that way. I *know* I have dominant bitches, and I know that in general Tesla gets to outrank Fiore, and Fiore will, in most cases defer to Tesla. But I also know that they can and will escalate and for that reason, I take steps to mitigate and redirect behaviors instead of being like 'poor Buddy, gets bullied, but really, it's just rough love'. I *know* what their triggers are and I take active steps to avoid them instead of projecting human emotions and whatever else onto them (or do both, at the very least).

There's a difference between acknowledging dynamics in your household and properly managing those, and attributing largely human attributes to things and then not managing those attributes.

Edit: I'll also say that, anecdotally, people who have come through the training facility I teach at, seem to have a far rougher time with behavioral modification, management, etc, when they have strong beliefs regarding their pack's hierarchy. A lot of the time these beliefs translate into emotional attributes that then hinder training."

Um, dogs don't know our emotions, least not in the truest sense of cause and effect like humans think. I would try to avoid you thinking of his responses in that way.

Check into the book mine! which goes over resource guarding. Inter-species can be a little difficult because 'natural' body cues don't always translate. I would play some redirection games with something your dog LOVES. He grows when the cat is near? Call him into your space with something he loves ... a different toy, a treat, whatever he loves. This teaches him that each time the cat comes near his stuff, you'll trade him something better. Otherwise, if you're not there to redirect, I'd keep all things of value away so he can't guard them, or keep the cat/dog separated."

dogs,ff62idg,t3_ervc5u,1579617489.0,"I have a GSD and Belgian Malinois. We had actual *real* fights in my household, like, putting holes in each other, and needing to be physically pried off each other. I had to spend the next six months doing a crate and rotate schedule, which I tied back with an ecollar for separation. Folks can hate on that if they wish, however, their fights were over me as a resource, and me being the separator is gasoline to the fire. The ecollar option was the only way to separate them from each other without me being involved and making it worse. We tied that with a bunch of 'sharing' games that you would use to combat normal resource guarding. We're almost a year into that and we've had no further incidents. Both dogs are sharing properly, and/or walking away to disengage instead of escalating. I'm also better at redirecting when I *feel* things escalating.

I will say this, if the dogs are not fighting then don't stress. Millions of homes have F/F households with zero issues. Breed, temperament, etc all play a big part in how F/F households play out. Give them space, make sure you try to keep your original dog's schedule as much as possible, and encourage neutral behaviors between them."
OpenDogTraining,ff5zrl9,t1_ff5y2w1,1579615381.0,"They're called pattern games, and they're typically done for dogs with anxiety in any direction (fear, or frustration, or excitement). They basically create patterns for the dog to feel comfortable in their environment by giving them a game to default to. Instead of worrying about something in the environment, you've conditioned the 1-2-3 to allow your dog to focus on that particular game. Basically, structure and predictability in the face of FEELINGS. To some extent, you're allowing the dog to direct their own CC/DS. 

You can check out Leslie McDevitt and her work in this area, but lots of trainers use the concept inadvertently as well. People do it pretty well without thinking too - we default to predictable patterns of behavior in the face of something 'weird' in our environment."
OpenDogTraining,ff48ej2,t3_er6rnv,1579557784.0,"Are you sure this is anxiety related? If so, have you considered asking for dynamic behaviors to keep him occupied, and over time slowing those down until you're at that stand still level? For example, cycling through puppy push ups at a pace and over time increasing duration between cues? 

Have you considered playing a game like 1-2-3? Basically, you count to three and deliver a treat on 3. Initially, we move through 1-2-3 pretty quickly, but once the dog understands the game, we can build duration between the 1-2-3, obviously, we want to make it variable, and tie it to something like look at me, or other behavior. 

Again, the goal being to build duration for stillness slowly.

IMO; yes, an ecollar could feasibly correct the vocalization, but if this is anxiety, then all you're doing is correcting the outward expression of the anxiety, and not the anxiety itself."

Low cost clinics typically don't do bloodwork, and some won't do IV cath/fluids during surgery and some will do less monitoring (high volume, quick turn around). I'd be comparing exactly what items you're getting for the price.

> Sorry, what does this mean? I thought any dog could do IPO, Mondio, French Ring, etc.

Mondio will require FCI registration as of 2021. French ring does not, but, you can't compete internationally - that's governed by the French board who require FCI. The American board for FR basically told them to take a hike on the FCI registration. Mondio is a lot closer to their parent body.

So, on the flip side, the fact that there are breeders who purposely pull together traits that the working community would look down upon, whilst still doing health testing and proving their dogs in other avenues ... well, that can only be a good thing to prevent folks from going to BYBers or mills.

For me *personally*, I will stick to breeds that fit my personality and my lifestyle. I won't get a spitz in my lifetime because I would want one bred to standard, but a bred to standard spitz and I are not going to get along.

k9sports,feumx1r,t3_eqkt8l,1579388038.0,"Schutzhund/IGP/IPO are the same thing. I'd expect another name change in two to five years going at their current rate. Also, there's American Schutzhund now too. 

Each sport has it's own guidebook and rules. If you go to their parent body's website you should be able to find these. 

None of them are 'easy'. Bite sports are a lot of work even if you get your miracle unicorn dog who somehow has the exact right balance of drive, arousal, prey/defense/hunt drive, etc. 

How do you decide? You sort of read the rules, and then go to their events and figure out where you fit. I personally wanted nothing to do with tracking, so that dropped the IPO stuff off my radar. I find the PSA crowd to be way to laissez faire, especially given the dog I have who MUST have high levels of control. That left mondio and FR. They're pretty similar exercise wise. Mondio you're fighting to environment to keep your points, FR you're fighting the decoy to keep your points. FR has far more rules about handler cuing, so for me, it made more sense to start there, lest I carry habits over from mondio. But, since the mondio folks are changing their rules to comply with registry requirements, I won't be doing that either.

Your dog was resource guarding something he found valuable. In future, go ahead and let him have it while you get something else that is valuable to him - a super good treat (or toy!) and trade him for the item. This teaches him that by giving up something he wants, he gets another item of value to him. 

He's not dangerous, or a bad dog, you didn't go horribly wrong with him. You just need to do a bit of work trading items with him so he gets the 'game' of resource trading. I like to do this with stuffed kongs that are made up exactly the same way. I give one, then offer the other - once the dog gives up the original, I start adding a 'give' cue, and then swap again.

3. Stop using words like 'no'. The dog doesn't understand English, and frankly, it's just poor ownership (unless someone trained 'no' to = behavior). You need to teach a behavior, and then redirect the dog to the behavior you want. For example, 'place' cues are a great opportunity to redirect to when someone is coming over.

1. If he is not desexed, you'll need to arrange that.
2. He will need a 2 color collar that is able to reflect light - they want red and yellow alternating stripes. 
3. You need to put up a dangerous dog sign on your premises. 
4. You need to muzzle train and ensure your dog is muzzled when outside your home.

If you want more information you can look at the agriculture.vic.gov.au website. This is if the council has declared your dog dangerous. If the council has not, I recommend that you do point four at a bare minimum. You should also find a space where this dog won't be around other animals. 

If you elect to surrender this dog, and/or rehome, you NEED to be clear about the potential for danger here. You don't want folks coming back on you via the civil courts.

Agreed! I'm not opposed to writing off days ... I have bad days too!

> There are two commands that my dog isn't allowed to ""not feel like"" doing. Recall and stay. 

Yup! Mine is just recall, my cued behaviors have inferred stays so, that's a little harder for us. Recall is the only cue that has had an ecollar attached to it.

Um, that's not really how aversives work. You don't think my husband doesn't find it aversive when I go silent and he can tell I'm mad? He 100% does. He'd MUCH rather I yelled at him or similar. No one gets to define what is negative for another mammal, only that entity can do that. The reality is, you are adding something, the dog probably doesn't like, to make it compliant. Most dogs on ecollars who are not conditioned to associate it with reinforcement will show displacement behaviors, which is an indicator that it is aversive. 

> Do you think this is because of the e-collar or would he get the same results with the same level of the training?

Depends on the dog. In general, yes, aversives can get you quicker results. It then comes down to what you want in your dog. I personally prefer enthusiasm for performance over just compliance. You have to remember that Larry's dogs have spent years with him building and fostering a relationship. It's more than just the ecollar getting compliance. He probably put a lot of work into puppy foundations which makes a huge difference. I'm not a fan of his style, I think he's a bit heavy handed and still works off some old theories, but he could be worse. Michael Ellis is far superior IMO.

As for whether he could get similar results without the ecollar ... he'd be a shitty trainer if he couldn't adapt his tools and methods to other dogs and their needs.

> Do you think this use of the e-collar is still inhumane? 

Yes. And no. Here's the deal. It's a tool. It can be abused. It IS abused by a lot of people. People think of an ecollar as a shortcut, and IMO, that's a ridiculous mindset. It *should* be a proofing tool, it's something you bring in AFTER you've taught the cue. Way too many people whack it on their dog and then jack up stim and light their dogs up. Using an ecollar correctly, is a lot of work. I spent a decent chunk of time layering it over known cues to ensure it was properly conditioned for my dog, and she understand how to turn stim on and off. I also don't think it should be used without incorporating R+.

It is my *personal* opinion, that the freedom she gets being offleash improves her quality of life above and beyond using the aversive to allow for that, particularly because the environment is so rewarding for her."

As for frisbee, yesss!! My [mal](https://i.imgur.com/ckcLQMn.jpg) and I compete in UpDog and DiscDog, it's such an awesome community! Definitely start with rollers and mark the 'snatch' when the dog bites and grips the disc. This will ensure you're building the tight grip and don't get the grip drops that a lot of dogs have (where they bite, but don't clamp so they end up dropping the disc, or it bounces it out). Plus, rollers are just fun for dogs! If you intend to compete make sure your dog is doing 'collected' jumps. They're much safer for dogs. Also, play around with discs. I'm actually on a SuperSonic disc right now and love it, but I keep Jawz handy for DiscDog.

Actually completely normal! Fun fact, dogs are one of a handful of allergens that are not equal between breeds, or even between dogs! You can be allergic to one dog, but not it's off spring, one puppy in a litter, some or none, etc. It's why if you have any dog allergies at all, you have to meet the individual dog. Anndd, then of course coat and dander can change between puppyhood and adulthood. 

> How did the shots go for you? Not OP.

Super good! I honestly had pretty big improvement within three months which plateaued out by six months. I just swapped to going fortnightly now, and things are a million times better. This time last year (I started shots midyear), I was literally miserable. I couldn't sleep, my eyes were watering and red all the time, my nose was either completely stuffed or just like a waterfall. I had nasal drip galore. Etc. And that was WITH prescription nasal spray, AND antihistamines twice a day. I also tried Singular because some people had success with it.

Now I rarely take anything except on shot day. Some days are definitely still bad ... mostly when my allergies 'stack' - ie: high pollen days, but I'm much, MUCH happier now. I can't recommend them strongly enough - I know mileage can vary, but my immunologist was convinced that even getting two of my six allergens under control would probably half my bad days (ie: the two dog triggers, or the two grass triggers, or grass and dust, whatever)."

Um, what? I can't think of any studies to support that. [This is an interesting read, and most of the studies cited there are available online with some google foo.](https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/take-your-dog-on-a-sniff) You can also check out research into 'seeking systems' and dopamine. In general though, scent is something that *most* dogs find to be extremely relaxing, it's why we consider it a displacement behavior - dogs do it TO relax when stressed.

I honestly think not letting dogs acclimate to environments is moronic, and scent is a huge part of that process. I *do* think that it needs to be incorporate clearly in training so that dogs know when to turn that part on and off. 

> Was wondering everyone’s thoughts on this as well as how much to let my dog sniff on his walks.

I *personally* let my dogs sniff as much as they want as long as they're keeping up and aren't pulling. I also 'know' what kind of areas interest them and make a very clear decision to stop there and invite them to sniff with a 'go sniff' cue. During this time they're allowed to pull me and I'll follow them for a minute or two (within reason). I then cue a 'lets go' which means we're moving back to our walk.

I really only do 'formal structured heeling' in training and trial. I think it's kind of an asinine thing to ask my dog to do for long ass periods of time like one of our average walks.
