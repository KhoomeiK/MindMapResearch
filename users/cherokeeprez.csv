fatlogic,ffa5vwa,t1_ff942ub,1579728493.0,I think it's more of a not wanting to accept that change is possible. It's hard. Really hard to fix those habits but clearly is possible. People generally want validation and no responsibility. That's why it's all made up BS and excuse after excuse. That's a whole lot easier than taking a good look in the mirror to recognize you are your own problem not the rest of the world.  I would rather spend the rest of my life paying attention to my diet and activity level than being morbidly obese and all the crap that goes with it. Good job on your loss and maintaining it!
fatlogic,ff91tuf,t1_ff8quyv,1579702739.0,"SAME...lost 135 myself and never ever want to go back. The differences are just crazy. The toll being obese created is not worth it. Feeling a million times better, having energy, feeling good in the morning instead of crappy, not stuffing myself into discomfort, not constantly worrying about fitting into chairs or airplane seats, much lower grocery cost, less pain, less illness...it goes on. If that makes me fat phobic...oh well."
WeightLossAdvice,feei3gt,t3_eoou0d,1579034198.0,Can you give an idea of what your daily foods are?
BariatricSurgery,feaxr6r,t3_eoakyy,1578953305.0,"For the first couple weeks hydration is the most important thing. You can do more protien wise once you get to pureed foods. But seriously, hydrate hydrate hydrate."
BariatricSurgery,fddl7m4,t3_ekroe0,1578316521.0,"You may need to research the specific bariatric surgeons yourself. Call their offices and see who they accept for insurance. That in itself will save you some trouble. Also, speak up for yourself. Demand answers to your questions. If they aren't forthcoming with answers you definitely need a different provider. The team I had was good. They helped every step of the way. Approval is a multi-step process. You should also be able to contact your insurance provider for specific details of what is required to have it covered and a list of surgeons they already have approved. Also,when you do get a surgeon you have to follow the rules or they may not do the surgery.  Good luck."

BariatricSurgery,fcey03c,t3_eh5dwa,1577624778.0,"It didn't have much on the lines of apprehension. Mostly because I thought about it and researched it for a long time prior. For me, the benefits outweighed the potential risks and complications. I did my research on every aspect of it including my surgical team, clinic, pre and post op stuff, diet, pros and cons...looked at issues everyone else has. All of it. Had my sleeve done in March of this year. Surgery and recovery were smooth. Followed all the instructions. I'm now down 135lbs and a normal BMI. Not a single complaint. But, you have to make sure you are mentally ready. Prepared to follow every rule. Yes there are risks but most of them can be minimized if people just follow the surgeons rules. In different forums I've seen so many people that hop right back to old habits. Surgery is a tool not a quick easy fix. It can do wonders if you maintain it properly. It will also be a life long battle and you have to be prepared for that...it's not cheating and it's not easy in my opinion well worth it."
BariatricSurgery,fbyo673,t1_fby32f0,1577221927.0,Right. Enjoy not being overstuffed and miserable.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fbuqcnb,t3_eej3tw,1577118678.0,My animals live in my house. If they can't be respectful then they can leave. I don't care what they think.
