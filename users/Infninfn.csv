audiophile,ff9ai58,t1_ff94ygc,1579708554.0,"There’s still a big enough market for it in Japan apparently. Probably much bigger than the US. Plenty of their music cafes/bars in the 70s and 80s were outfitted with expensive JBLs and now that a lot of these have disappeared, the older generation have taken to buying their own.

In fact, just going by his videos alone, part of his customer base seems to be businesses also - cafes, bars and restaurants that are going for the music cafe vibe with retro JBL sound.

Best not to under-estimate the hifi market in Japan - they do have the purchasing power and the obsession for hifi, up to otaku levels too. There are many stories of ordinary Japanese working class joes whose sole passion is hifi and take out huge loans (upwards of 100K USD) to feed the habit.

Their large electronics retailers all have proper hifi equipment sections and their specialist hifi retailers are still going strong. There are plenty of used hifi equipment stores too. I had a lot of fun browsing through some of these stores the last time I visited Tokyo."
audiophile,ff8txrm,t3_eqnbn0,1579695961.0,"My apartment right now has concrete walls and ceilings that are so thin and so resonant that you can hear drilling from 4 floors up (I walked up 4 flights to find renovation in full swing, it was a rather disturbing discovery of how far the sound travels in my building).

I have literally heard coins drop on the floor above and I’m pretty sure that my immediate neighbors can hear when I’m playing music at reasonably loud levels - 50-60dB because I’ve heard the complaint knocks on the floor above before.

So understandably, I won’t play music too loudly at night, and if I ever crank it up I’ll only do it in the afternoon. 

For my next apartment I’m planning on getting soundproof windows and hoping the walls are a bit thicker. We’ll have to see how that goes."

In any case, it’s about market adoption in a world where most of the market expects to be able to stream music for free.

I don’t know if this digital streaming is going to be final but given how convenient it is to immediately listen to your favorite music without having to wait for it to be delivered, never mind unthinkably going to a store to buy it and potentially getting out empty handed if it was out of stock - well, it seems like it’s here to stay.

The other ‘new’ invention that needs to be considered is playlists. Seemingly harmless things that allow you to put all your favourite songs together and not have to suffer through the garbage that is usually the rest of an album. I don’t see people giving these up for the privilege of purchasing a hit and miss album. 

That said, there’s still going to be a market for people who want to support their favourite artists directly and buying vinyl can be a good way to do that.

Maybe a USB key affixed to an album cover in a clever and nice way?"

As for your onboard PC DAC, if you’re already spending money on Tidal Hifi, you will want to spend a bit more on a decent DAC.

audiophile,ff8homq,t3_es7fh2,1579678957.0,"Recorded music is usually close mic’ed. Ie, that singer’s voice track that you hear in all its detail is not even close to how you’d hear it in a live acoustic/non-amplified performance.

For it to be a realistic representation, in a live performance that singer has to be inches from your ears/face/head. 

It only gets worse with all the synthetic instruments in modern music and all the mastering/editing/mixing/modification of the recorded music.

So sound reproduction is always going to be an artistic interpretation of what the definition of ‘real sound’ is. It will differ according to the manufacturer, as well as the subjective preferences of the listener.

What you need to do is find the type of sound that you like and stick with that."

audiophile,ff870ff,t3_es421f,1579667794.0,"There’s a bit of controversy to his business. Allegedly, he’s heavily marking up those old JBLs on account of rebuilding and re-tuning the speakers, a service that his customers apparently appreciate.

The argument is that the rebuild process is just dyeing the paper woofer diaphragms to look newer, polishing up the brass bits and replacing the odd capacitor here and there. The paper woofer cones and rubber woofer surrounds can get replaced too but apparently the service is not cheap - compared to what classic JBL owners can expect in the US.

But on closer inspection, when you do look at the prices on his website they are actually quite reasonable, which leads me believe that those critics are just sore. 

That said, he’s got to be making some money to be able to afford that flashy Ferrari he sometimes drives to customer homes. 

I think what is really happening is that he’s just buying old JBLs at really cheap prices, cleans them up and flips them with a healthy profit. Probably much cheaper if you already had a pair of JBLs and sent them in for servicing."

Carts always come with a stylus attached. But I think what you’re referring to is the headshell - these are not an industry wide standard but commonly feature on Japanese turntables. Some brands sell carts together with headshells but otherwise it’s not necessary to get them unless you’re regularly switching the carts out.

The headshells make it easier to switch carts out for when you’re evaluating carts or feel like having a different sound. If you don’t change the headshell out there’s a bit of fiddling involved to manually remove the cart from the headshell.

You will want to learn about carts that are suitable for your tonearm/turntable. Once decided, you will then want to learn how to install it properly too, as there are some adjustments that are critical for operation and sound quality."

When it really stands out is if it strikes when I’m somewhere I’ve never been before. And it’s always about some mundane detail that has no significance. For example, I’d be sitting down at a table and observing the surroundings, watching the scene at the restaurant and it goes off. I remember this exact moment from a dream that I’d had - sometimes years before.

The memory of the dream from years before usually stands out more when it’s one of those vivid dreams where I wake up and remember what happened, noting how strange the situation was, as I’d dream of an experience only possible if I had a different viewpoint on the world. And sure enough, over the years my world view has changed drastically.

I’d like to have a setup that is easier to carry around and has that full frame quality and dynamic range, with a nice sharp lense. I do know that the king of the hill is the Sony A7R IV which is very tempting but I’m not willing to cough up the cash for it.

audiophile,fe841dj,t3_enudw2,1578922284.0,"Modern amps and DACs are expected to have not more than 0.1% total harmonic distortion. The best ones go down to 0.001% or thereabouts.

Ever notice how speaker manufacturers never mention what their distortion levels can be? That’s because they can be as high as 5% (even more for crappy and cheap speakers) and likely don’t go below 1-2%, even at medium listening volumes.

Given this, where is the most gain in sound fidelity to be had? Going from a 5% THD speaker to a 1% THD speaker or a DAC that has 0.05% THD to a DAC that does 0.005% THD?

The speakers are where the bulk of the system budget should go to. And they can and do sound significantly clearer as you go up the range.

With amps and DACs there are certainly noticeable changes in nuances and subtleties but they’re usually not as drastic as going from one speaker grade to the next."

It’s about finding what you like and prefer and love in sound reproduction. And for me, at least, it’s about doing so in as organized and informed way as possible. 

At some point in the journey as an audiophile, you stop blindly listening to what other people write or say. Experience and learn to evaluate things for yourself - trying everything you can get your hands on, even if it’s something wildly more than you can afford. Going to headfi meets, stopping by at a headphone shop in that city you’re visiting, making it a point to visit av shows when it’s convenient or planning a trip to Denver for RMAF, for example (insert preferred show here). 

Obsessing isn’t good for the wallet, I know, I’ve made my own mistakes and impulse buys. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that being patient and doing the ground work before committing to a purchase gives me a 100% success rate with satisfaction.

If all this doesn’t appeal to the person, then they’re really not that into it. Which is fine. And if you ask me, if they’re spending money on something that they really aren’t that into, it’s their money. It’s not as if they can’t back out of it and recoup some of that money.

It's just a slow industry, where innovation is purely down to headphone designers efforts without the kind of RND backing that the computer/electronics industry has (as well as the size of the market in comparison).

The trickle down effect from high end headphones is happening. Just not at the rate that you're hoping for. For example, the HD650 was Sennheiser's flagship headphone in 2003. 17 years later, it can be had in HD6XX form for a little under $200. It was $500 in 2003, or $700 in today's dollars. That they are still producing the HD650 is just a sad reminder of how slow progress has been, at least with dynamic drivers.

On the contrary, I'm not jaded at all by the state of headphones because I too have 'heard them all' and yet I can discern the character to each headphone. There are nuances and subtleties that have steered me away from dynamic drivers to planar magnetic drivers and I think that is where the state of the art is (aside from electrostatic drivers). I'm happy with my LCD3s because they're not lacking in any way and have given me plenty of enjoyment and satisfaction. I've heard the LCD4 and the Hifiman Susvara, which are a definite step up in clarity and refinement but it hasn't detracted from my enjoyment of the LCD3s whatsoever.

That said, if all I knew was my HD6XX, life wouldn't be that bad either. It's the headphones that I wish were my first serious ones."

todayilearned,fd3uehs,t3_ejbczw,1578161722.0,"When I was in Paris a few years back, I had a baguette from the bakery of one of the previous winners.

It was so good and tasty that you could enjoy it on its own with a bottle of wine and so I did just that. I still remember it till this day and I scorn at the poor excuses for baguettes that I get locally.

And the best thing about it? They're ridiculously cheap for what they are because of the price controls in place for baguettes in France. IIRC, I paid 1.2 euros for it."
headphones,fd3r0ck,t1_fcymxcc,1578160970.0,"In comparison to hifi stereo, of course, not quite headphone systems. The HE1 is almost singular in its statement of a flagship headphone system.

Next is the Hifiman Shangri-la system at $50000.

The next closest is a STAX 009s and its accompanying amp at $10000. Audeze LCD 4 + Audeze The King at $8500.

'Course, for standalone headphones there's the Hifiman Susvara at $6000, Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC at $5000 and a few more around this price range.

Flagship headphone amps are also thereabouts.  Woo Audio WA33 Elite Edition at $8000, for example."

AskReddit,fd3b74n,t1_fd2tn62,1578156521.0,"More Asians going to western countries want to immigrate and thus permanently stay there, than the reverse - Westerners immigrating and settling down in Asian countries. 

Expatriates can be any nationality but they only stay temporarily and eventually return to their home countries. It's not discrimination. 

In my country, for example, there are expats from all over, Westerner and Asian alike. And there are also immigrants who seek legal citizenship, as well as those who entered illegally. OTOH, they call them illegal immigrants when they should really call them illegal expats because they're here to do labour and will eventually return home with their saved up money."

headphones,fctlfte,t1_fctjr0z,1577947659.0,"Yep, I did mention it - the R-1 DAC."
headphones,fctix92,t1_fctct48,1577944857.0,"They’ve been around for more than a decade and have been providing excellent SQ and value with their in-house designs. The amount of circuitry and components that go into their DACs is significantly more than competitors at the same price point - and the SQ shows it. I’ve heard DACs 2-3 times more expensive that they compare favorably to. Discovered them on head-fi.org about 5 years back but you’re right, not many people outside of the headphones community know about them.

Audio-gd for me is one of the reputable Chinese hifi companies like Aurender, Cayin and such - except that they favor function over form and have a 10 year warranty. The website is stuck in the 90s and payment is via email PayPal but again, function over form."
audiophile,fctgkuv,t1_fcso8jf,1577942589.0,"There’s the long running idea that separate preamp and amps are better for SQ due to both stages having individual power regulation and being shielded from each other. Having them separate also allows you to upgrade either component one at a time. In this price range there aren’t a lot decent options new but there are plenty of older amps on the used market. Matching preamps to amps can be a bit of a headache though, if you decide to not go with manufacturer pairs.

Integrated amps are usually cheaper for the same power output and the competing idea is that because the signal path between preamp and amp is shorter, and there is no need for an amp input stage (rca or balanced), things are evened out. Also, there are less pieces of gear to clutter things up because the DAC can be integrated too.

Either way, there are good and bad examples of discrete amp/preamps and integrated amps and it will just come down to your preference.

More important IMO is the amp topology - Class A, AB, D, Tubes, etc. They usually lend different characteristics to the sound and you’ll eventually discover what you like best."
