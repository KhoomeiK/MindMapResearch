hdtgm,femjxmy,t1_femaej7,1579259369.0,"Yes, except this wasn't Carvey taking a risk.  He was already well-established by this time.  This movie was supported by Adam Sandler (an early foray into attempting to make profitable terrible movies).  Carvey once said of this movie (paraphrasing):  I must have been nice to Adam Sandler or something during the years we overlapped at SNL.  We don't know each other that well and he offered me money for a project. 

So I disagree that this was a risk, in the sense you are describing.  If anything, this is an indication that Carvey, who is a brilliant comedian, needs writing partners and people reigning in his weirder impulses.  

It's the same with Mike Myers.  Look at the quality of the jokes from Austin Powers 1 to 2 to 3, as he gains more power and no longer needs minders.  This culminates in the Love Guru."

As a general rule, 99% of the time someone says you are ruining their ""special day"" because you refuse to give them something or doing them a favor, they are simply entitled and an asshole.

AmItheAsshole,fefxxwm,t3_eopogn,1579068929.0,NTA; don't you dare apologize. Being autistic doesn't mean someone should be treated indefinitely with kid gloves.  He had warnings.  You said yourself that he usually is able to understand when told directly that he's missed a social cue.  He persisted nonetheless this time and received the proper social consequence of being yelled and cursed at as a result.  Hopefully he comes away with a slightly better understanding of such situations.

However, what's the point of electing people to make decisions for us for a few years if we constantly second-guess them?  Look at how much of a shitshow things are now with congresspeople constantly running for reelection and making their decisions accordingly."

Dublin,fdnu1i2,t3_embckm,1578592825.0,This is a teaching moment.  A guy who already is offering trash housing and admits he won't fix it because he knows how high demand for housing is not the person to trust with a verbal agreement on such matters.

AmItheAsshole,fdfzt42,t3_ekzjs4,1578374966.0,"YTA, their relationship is none of your business. They raised you and provided for you, and that fact that your all-of-the-sudden not proud of them any more because they don't have a piece of paper from the government is plainly silly.

AmItheAsshole,fdfz7pd,t1_fdfxvw5,1578374428.0,"Well, it is a bit odd that he talked about it as if there were no custody agreement.  Shouldn't he have been able to compel visitation in compliance with the agreement?"

AmItheAsshole,fcye5p1,t1_fcxed12,1578078747.0,So I suppose if the sister tried to force a brother (who hypothetically dresses in stereotypically masculine clothing) to also wear a dress to her wedding because that's what she wants on her special day that the brother should just be comfortable enough with his gender identity to wear whatever costume the sister wants?

AmItheAsshole,fcmd2er,t1_fcm66om,1577770986.0,"I just made it up (but I am sure someone has used it before).  You have the right idea; but replace monster with moron. I was just trying to hammer the point home that this is going to be revealed to this child at some point, and the OP can either be the one to do it or wait until someone does it maliciously, destroying the trust between himself and his brother."
AmItheAsshole,fckn6x3,t3_ehmsme,1577728961.0,"NTA because you were thrust into a shitty situation by terrible people.  

However, you have made a huge mistake not telling your brother in age-appropriate ways what your relationship is.  It may still be he would want to call you mum and dad, but you have basically set a time bomb that could very well alienate him from you.  I have seen multiple situations like this one where a child alienated themselves from well-meaning people after finding out the well-meaning people lied to them about their parentage.  

Do you honestly think he's never going to find out when you have aunts and uncles who are openly disgusted with you?  Someone is going to reveal it to him in a fit of meanness, and it's going to really fuck your shit up for years thereafter.  Get ahead of this before that occurs.  

So, as I said; you're not the asshole, but YWBAFM if you did not fix this before it gets ""fixed"" for you."

AmItheAsshole,fcfof7w,t1_fcbbzjd,1577632245.0,"You may or may not be, but you need to understand that the language you use to describe this person and this situation communicate a strong disdain for this woman and for your son's ""flighty"" ways, whether you mean that or not.  Imagine, now, that you may also be subtly communicating these things to this girlfriend, even if you do not mean to."
AmItheAsshole,fcczf9m,t3_egs4js,1577604484.0,NOOOOOOO!!!! NTA.  I have a friend who comes from a family with a huge pile of money and they just threw away more than a million dollars on her god-awful restaurant idea.  It was sad and depressing and has now created so much strife.  Don't finance her poorly-thought-out whim.  It will destroy your inheritance and your marriage.
