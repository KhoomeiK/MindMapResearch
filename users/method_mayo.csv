It's tough when it's the people close to you. My friends are fully aware that I have terrible anxiety and it feels like they maybe cared at some point to help ease it, but they just seem almost tired of hearing me complain.

offmychest,felvii7,t1_fejvghq,1579231976.0,"I have struggled with anorexia ever since about 5th grade. I thought i was fat even when I was underweight. It's something that only changes once you stop giving as many fucks about how you look. That's when you start smiling at yourself in the mirror instead of sighing.

That's super easy to just say to you, I know, but I'm telling you, that's just the bottom line to keep in mind. *You don't actually look the way you think you do*. NO MATTER WHAT. Nobody does. LSD helped me realize this. Once I looked at myself in th mirror while tripping I saw myself for the first time. Not my reflection, but *ME*. I was surprised how different I looked than I thought I did. 

Not saying you have to take acid to love yourself, I'm just saying that you never know how you look to another person or how you look from any perspective outside of yourself until you see it‚Äì which doesn't happen unless you're on a substance like that. So as a person whose had trouble with eating disorders and has also had this experience, I'm telling you, from the bottom of my heart:
The people around you who tell you that you're not fat or how you think you look‚Äìtheyre not just saying that to make you feel better. I thought that they just said that to make me feel better for the longest time. I was hella wrong."
offmychest,felujpe,t3_epjh3s,1579231287.0,"I'm a man and I'll tell ya I've never even thought about this before. Had no idea such a term even existed. Women look at themselves in the mirror and see everything wrong with themselves. To a fresh set of eyes, those things that they think are the worst parts of themselves (like thigh gaps and these ""hip dips""), aren't even noticable until they talk about how insecure they are about them. 

How do we fix this? Self love. For real

At the end of the day nobody on earth can say they know what they look like to the opposite sex or their sexual counterpart. My girlfriend is beautiful and she thinks she is not. I tell her all the time: ""if only you knew"" ""I wish you could see yourself how I see you"" and she says ""I wish I could"".

It's tough but just have faith that you truly have ZERO idea about what you look like to a person who has never seen you before."

AskReddit,feccmce,t3_eo83cx,1578970798.0,It's really sad that anyone would even begin to think that it's okay to keep it a secret from a partner. That's a potentially scarring moment for the other person. That's selfish. Doesn't matter what society thinks about trans people or if trans people should be able to exist‚Äì it's just simply not okay and a waste of your partners time.
offmychest,feaergp,t3_eo3jcy,1578947815.0,"When you're an alcoholic you don't think you deserve anything because you're always depressed. I'm an addict and I'll tell ya, I'm in the same place you are. Hate life. Doesn't seem like there's any meaning to it. But if it comes down to your addiction being the reason you kill yourself, then there is definitely hope for you. Addictions are things that can be broken, and if you seek help from a professional you can do just that. It takes strength and you have to step up and face reality and that takes more strength than people normally have. That's why people do end up dying through addiction.

Drugs like alcohol aren't programmed into our evolution. They wreak havoc on our brains when dependence is formed. I know what you're going through. It's so hard. You just have to understand that you can be happy again, and if you did pursue AA or another means of getting back your sobriety I promise that you will come to the realization that you truly can have that love for life that you once had, back in your life. 

So many addicts who go through the 12 step program come out of it saying ""I thought it was over. I didn't know I could be this happy ever again, but here I am"". So before you end it all, I'd recommend giving it a shot. You might just learn to really appreciate the one life you're given. You might fall into depression again, but hell, that's just part of life. Alcohol + depression, though, that's a hell of a downer, and that shit makes you want to die."

lildarkie,fdfnnut,t1_fcrstrf,1578365890.0,"I do think Darkie nails that shit better than many many other pop rappers. I wonder if he has anyone helping him with rhyme schemes. No doubt X had people around him giving him advice. 

No shame in having another professional there to help give you a second opinion on lyrical content"
lildarkie,fdfnhi6,t1_fddi45m,1578365773.0,"Honestly bro they're totally different with their narratives so it's not like Darkie is copying him.

If you really think AB it, the only reason you draw that comparison is because X was the first yellrapping artist to get as popular as he did. Now there is plenty of popular yellrapping and I'd say it's in part because of X. 

To say one artist is copying another is a statement that you don't find yourself making forever. I don't mean disrespect but it's just sort of just a question you don't continue asking after hearing enough rap and hip-hop because the human voice is the distinguishing aspect of rap and while people have unique ways of rapping, the reality is: when you sit down and make your own music, it's not coming from you, it's coming from a mix of your current emotions, what music you've been listening to and what flow comes to mind when writing and reciting the lyrics.  And that flow that comes to mind is what I hear people criticize the most in terms of originality or lack thereof. 

When you latch onto a certain artist and fall in love with their work, you listen to it over and over. That embeds the memory of that song in your head. It's psychology.
When you're thinking about what good music sounds like when you're making music, as much as people like to take FULL credit for the shit they create, it's largely based off flows they've been listening to or have listened to a lot in the past.

Tldr: comparing rappers is pointless in general, but comparing Darkie and X doesn't make sense cuz they have entirely different lyrical content so they can totally coexist... as can all rappersü§ô"

TrueOffMyChest,fd72khn,t1_fd68hm5,1578198640.0,"Okay I think there's a lot of people who don't understand what I'm trying to say. 

Rape is an extreme case. But making abortion illegal entirely for the reason that ""life is precious"" implies that rape is no exception. Why is it an exception? Is that life any less precious?


My bottom line and TLDR-sum-up is that if a woman gets pregnant, she should be able to decide what to do with it. 

Doesn't matter how or why she got pregnant, that option should always be available. Even encouraged in some cases if there's any reasonable doubt that the person has what it takes to responsibly raise a child. 

Giving birth should only occur when someone is in a comfortable place in their life with plenty of financial stability to fall back on.

I'm going to delete my initial post because I just can't express these ideas in this format (a short forum post), and Im just not proud of the emotional callus it conveys.

Sorry to offend you, and I want to say that I highly (HIGHLY) respect anyone who has had to go through the emotional suffering of dealing with sexual assault of any kind. I didn't mean to use anybody's trauma or tragedy as a shield, and I didn't realize that what I had said could be taken as an attempt to do that, and I can now recognize why you interpreted it that way.

I don't intend on doing any more replying or back and forth with this forum post cuz I honestly just regret posting it, and I could have done a better job of portraying my ideologies without sounding like a fat dick in the process."

GenderCritical,fd5d17w,t3_ejlgmv,1578176407.0,"Bruh it's so simple how can people just not understand this. They're overthinking it.

Women have the same critical thinking skills as men.
Women even have emotional advantages in some aspects over men.

Men have a physical advantage over women.

That's it. There should be no glass ceiling. That's the bottom line and if you agree with this then you're on the right track.

Anyone who denies any of the above without proper reasoning can consider themself part of the problem."
TrueOffMyChest,fd05l0i,t1_fczueb1,1578113956.0,"Man, the damage to your developmental health caused by growing up around individuals with narcissistic/sociopathic tendencies cannot be accurately stated. It's imperative that you get those people out of your life and it's immensely hard too. But you did it. Be proud of yourself for that.

Also rereading my previous comment, I'd like to add that I'll endorse LSD any day and I even encourage people to try it if they have a proper understanding of the risks that come alongside it's use (which there are *plenty* of, including life-long trauma and psychosis), but it is by no means a solution. It's a means to SEE the solution. It's a spectacle that can instantly allow you to see what you can't normally see. 

Getting into that frame of mind can come about without psychoactive chemicals too. Like you said. Trauma and dealing with some really difficult family shit. That'll put your mind in an abstract place. One where you can pull yourself out of your body and your current situation and see yourself as another person would. It reminds you that you're just a spec of dust in this universe and it's an oddly peaceful and relieving thought. 

Whether you come to self acceptance through the means of or through meditation or through adversity in everyday life, you end up at the same place."
TrueOffMyChest,fcztyzw,t3_ejjvm2,1578108573.0,"I used to have so much fucking social anxiety my entire personality became an attempt to show people I was nornal. I had very little direction and the world intimidated me. When I first took acid I realized that it doesn't matter what strangers think. You are only going to see them probably once in your entire lifetime. Why are you suddenly the one who needs to prove themself to this new face? You aren't. All of those new faces have likely already had that same fear of acting strange around new people and leaving a bad impression, or they have already overcome those feelings by having some enlightening experience. For me that was LSD, and I think that it really does take an experience like that to change you for good. 

Not to say you can't find this same kind of enlightenment elsewhere... You definitely can. But psychedelics can show you what you've already seen and known as reality from outside of yourself and your ego and your personality and everything that defines you. 

With this perspective you can realize that you're just another dude tryna figure out what's going on just like everyone else. Once I thought about this, my mind just took a massive sigh of relief and the following 6-8months I had a brand new appreciation for life and I set out to try to get other people to come to the same realizations I came to but without having a mind bending psychedelic trek accross their minds and memories."

I agree, it's total bullshit that they used it as an excuse.
