I'll be brutally honest with you, I stopped believing in Christianity years ago, and I truly don't plan on going back. Instead, I've picked up something else in its place.

(Minus what can be justified as I think Muslims attacked Christians)

What's funny is this, the religion I follow that started it all, is now a myth, and was willing to change in order to come back.
It might seem strange that I will believe in a myth over Christianity, but it came first and lacks corruption.

Christianity might have ""forgiveness of sin"", but it's just a cover up for what it truly lacks.

I struggle with both sides because I give very neutral opinions and want others to think the same.

3. When a signal (Ligand such as a protein, light, sound, pressure, neurotransmitter, or other signal) binds to the seven transmembrane receptor, it will alter the shape of the receptor ultimately causing the GDP to be replaced with GTP (Not converted — I made that mistake)

4. When GTP binds to the G alpha, the G beta and Gamma subunits will detach and the G alpha will use that energy to release the signal to the rest of the cell via travel.

On a side note, this is what triggers ion channeling, right? Where the neuron has received a stimuli from the G alpha and is going to translate the signal to make it interpretable by other neurons?"
