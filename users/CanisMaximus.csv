AskScienceDiscussion,fcjt0sa,t3_ehhsoa,1577703216.0,"Ok. All this comparative stuff needs some clarification. This is the very rough and very dirty version:  A neutron star is a star which at the apogee of its lifespan was between 10 and 30 or so solar masses. At the end of its life it collapses in a supernova, but not far enough to become a black hole. In effect, it becomes one big neutron. The resulting object left behind is around 20 kilometers or so. The material on that star has that density and resultant massive gravitational field. But that material cannot exist AWAY from that gravity. If you somehow instantaneously transported a ""teaspoon"" of it away from its parent, it would create a huge explosion as soon as it was off the surface. ""Neutronium"" would not be able to exist outside of a neutron star.

Saying that ""a teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as 900 Great Pyramids"" is just a more interesting way to wrap people's heads around the concept of something so dense."
