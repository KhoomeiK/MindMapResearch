Berserk,ffa78zv,t1_ffa3938,1579729246.0,"Doubtful, we are at just under 9 years since the last release of a book in the main series with no news on the next one. Not only that, but with the way the last two were meant to be one book and ended up getting split because of how large it ended up becoming, I’m guessing something similar will end up happening with the next one. And if the current gap is anything to go by, then the next one will be just as long, if not longer."
SubredditDrama,ffa1zkj,t1_ff9zkp9,1579726277.0,"Same way if I had to guess. If you’re the top mod, then you just sell your account and the ownership of the sub goes with that."
SubredditDrama,ff9uray,t1_ff9qgc6,1579721855.0,"It’s probably because it’s easy to do what he’s doing. Actually getting up off your ass when your sole motivation (making money) is gone is hard. If nothing else he’s a great cautionary tale that money, fame, and success doesn’t make you a good person, no matter how many people you’ve brought endless amounts of joy through the product of your labor."
SubredditDrama,ff9otiu,t1_ff980ha,1579717534.0,"He lost all his drive to do anything once he got his billions. It’s sad that his only motivation to make games that people enjoy and do productive things was only because of money. If I got enough to live the rest of my life doing whatever I pleased then last thing I would ever do is talk out of my ass on social media, I’d be so buried deep in hobbies it would be unreal. Get myself a fully loaded wood shop and churn out a whole set of handmade furniture for myself, learn to knit, literally anything but what Notch is doing."
SubredditDrama,ff9of8h,t1_ff9khkx,1579717256.0,"Personally I believe that Dorne and all its characters should have been cut from the show entirely since they did such a half assed job with all of it. That’s where the show really started to start sucking in very obvious ways, and it’s also one of the few weird fillery bits from the books that made it into the show."
SubredditDrama,ff9nz3r,t1_ff9l6xu,1579716974.0,For a brief period it was over the top obviously sarcastic shitpost a about God Emperor Trump.
MovieDetails,ff8hvn8,t1_ff7gu4z,1579679207.0,I can only imagine being a Hunter/gatherer and complaining about not wanting to do it and thinking about changing jobs
PublicFreakout,ff7y51q,t1_ff7qk05,1579661137.0,Not even my family would know if I got it. I would just say that I got a good paying job out of state and move to where they can’t check in on me and see that I’m just fucking around doing hobbies while I sit on the interest
truegaming,ff474k3,t1_ff2mzbx,1579556997.0,"About what I used for Witcher 3, except it was two hours and the opening mission with the griffin bored me so much I couldn’t imagine playing the whole game. Also I absolutely despise Gwent"
truegaming,ff46l7h,t1_ff3w51q,1579556662.0,"I don’t even consider a lot of singleplayer games nowadays simply because I just don’t have time for them. I’m playing through Final Fantasy 15 right now and I’m only able to get maybe 4-5 hours into it every week, and even then the only days I play are on my weekends. The only game I’d ever actually clear my calendar for is Elder Scrolls 6, whenever it actually does release"
todayilearned,ff2isj6,t1_ff2ig2h,1579508001.0,"Never said I hadn’t, my major irrational behavior was overeating for most of my adolescence. I don’t do that anymore, but even then I would rather have just been overweight than been a smoker or a combination of the two. It was fairly easy to put down the soda and start walking, putting down cigarettes is far harder, and for people to do it still is ridiculous."
todayilearned,ff2ggtl,t1_ff2fvqb,1579505090.0,"At this point it’s hard for me to be sympathetic to people who do smoke. I think of all the lectures I had to sit through in school, the pictures of diseased lungs, seeing pictures of my father as a young fit marine and seeing him at the end of his life coughing constantly and having trouble breathing. If after all that I started smoking, I can’t even fathom how ridiculously short sighted and dumb I would be."
SubredditDrama,ff26d4g,t1_ff09za3,1579495076.0,17 year old me did write a short story about an alternate history where Native Americans had the same level of technology as Europeans and were in a long protracted war with England. If I ever get into a position where I’m unable to move around easily I think I’ll try my hand at writing a more fleshed out version of the story.

AskReddit,fed386h,t1_fecf7vw,1578996560.0,"Shit like this is why I’m glad I got rid of mine without ever having really learned to ride it. I bought the damn thing last year for $1k off a friend because he needed the cash and I stupidly thought that I might like riding bikes. Turns out I fucking hate it, every bit of it. Shifting, braking, all the extra gear I have to wear compared to just getting in a car. I even signed up for a class to get my license, and didn’t show up after the first day because I realized how much I hated it once I got there on the bike with the instructors. I felt like shit for a while, not having finished something I started doing, but god damn am I glad I’m not speeding down the highway on some stupid little death trap."

Not a single health issue that I could see, nor that he ever talked about. Hell he is why I try to run everyday the weather permits, and why I want to eventually work my way up to the same level of fitness"
moviescirclejerk,fdtm66z,t1_fdt4jhq,1578718770.0,"I try to keep vids I send for humor purposes to 30 seconds or less. Very few people actually want to sit down and watch YouTube videos for long periods of time, and I don’t think I could ever give a reason as to why any of my friends would watch something longer than 30 sec"
politics,fds53mw,t1_fdr5mgd,1578694550.0,"For y’all it is centered around one guy, just because you despise him doesn’t mean the sub has to be only that. I hate the man too, but having a place where it’s nothing but him on the front page every day is essentially T_D but focused on hating him instead of praise. Like I said, Two Minutes Hate, but spread out so long it’s honestly a little depressing."

history,fdmodur,t1_fdmnwr4,1578557939.0,"No a few years before, from what my grandmother told me his family saw which way the wind was blowing early on and left Germany around the time the Nazis began to take power. I’m not sure on the actual years this all happened because he never really liked to talk about it, and he’s been dead at this point for 14 years. I do know that he preferred to call himself Prussian rather than German after the war because he was from that region and people wouldn’t immediately associate that with Germany."

He was a Jewish boy adopted by a catholic family right before WWII, and there was no tolerance of his old faith in his new family. Without fail, one day of the week, his mother would send him to the market to buy salt cod for dinner. And as soon as he left home, and got married, he told my grandmother that he would never eat another salt cod again."

AskReddit,fcv1cra,t1_fcupjtu,1577992619.0,"That’s why a lot of people hopped on patreon, and merchandising. YouTube is as you put it, a springboard to get to those two end goals. Once you’ve done that, you’re much more secure since you don’t have to rely on a fickle monetization system."

For the whole first year I worked at the store I’m at, I never heard a single peep about facing. Not one single solitary word on how good or bad it was on any particular night. Come last January, when the new manager started, apparently the whole store now looks like shit and everyone has to spend twice the amount of time facing that they used to. There was even a month where they purposefully scheduled a single guy to close the entire store at night, and they still expected him to face like he was a team of 6 working for 3 hours facing. I already know, my last day I’m not touching shit. I’ll make sure nobody else gets caught up in it though, I want all the blame for why my section looks awful"
