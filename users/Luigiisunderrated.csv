>Are you really saying that motivational stories like this need a disclaimer telling people not to drop out if their life is going well just because they might be able to make something of themselves in middle age?

No, I'm not saying they need a disclaimer, but I'm going to write a comment to push back. I'm going to assume you've been to college/university since you're the only one that actually can think in this thread; University is incredibly stressful and difficult for most students. People give up all the time from an aggregate of different reasons. Do I think that a student will browse this thread and quit school because they read OPs feel-good comments? Probably not. That probably won't be the straw that breaks the camel's back, but I don't want them to consume this story without any push back. I don't want them to internalize this ""feel-good"" story in support of giving up, because people here are praising a guy that was too busy ""clubbing, carousing, drinking, and chasing women around"" to finish school. We don't know his situation, his capital, nor his debt.

This is purely conjecture, you don't know this. You're projecting, because this is how you might feel. Students are under a lot of pressure and stress; University is difficult. Reading OPs comment may not be the straw the breaks the camel's back, but it could be internalized in support of wanting to give up. University is hard, and people give up all the time for various reasons. I'm not going to let someone consume that feel-good story without push back.
