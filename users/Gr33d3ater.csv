Frequency hopping was not only known but was in use decades before Ms. Lamarr and Mr. Antheil came up with a different way to do it. Though they were rightly given a patent for an interesting way to do frequency hopping they most certainly were not its inventors. The technologies we use today would be here just as they are now had the inventors never been born.

Jonathan Zenneck's book Wireless Telegraphy (German, 1908, English translation McGraw Hill, 1915) is one of the first public documents mentioning frequency hopping - a full 34 years before Lamarr and Antheil's patent. And it has been written that Germany was using this technology in 1918 against the British (see the EE Times article referenced below.)

Patent #US1869659 describes a frequency hopping invention submitted by Willem Broertjes in 1929 and issued in 1932 (a decade before Lamarr and Antheil's).

Patent #US723188 by none other than Nikolai Tesla in 1903 does not use the phrase ""frequency hopping"" though it describes changing wireless frequencies to avoid interception.

Lastly, here is an article from EE Times noting their accomplishment but demonstrating they did not invent the technology: https://www.eetimes.com/a-short-history-of-spread-spectrum/

>Nikola Tesla, the prolific Serbian-American inventor and radio pioneer, filed a U.S. patent, granted on March 17, 1903 which doesn’t mention the phrase “frequency hopping” directly, but certainly alludes to it.

>Such an interesting idea didn’t escape the military’s attention of course, and by 1915, the Germans were making use of primitive frequency hopping radio to stop the British eavesdropping on their conversations.

>Lamarr, together with co-inventor George Antheil, a pianist and Hollywood composer, came up with a system for radio control of torpedoes. The idea was not new, but Lamarr’s concept of frequency hopping to prevent the intended target from jamming the controller’s transmissions was.
While the concept of frequency hopping is used in spread spectrum communications there is no evidence either inventor had a role in SIGSALY or any other spread spectrum project.

Their patent #US2202387 does not discuss spread spectrum in any way.

Personally, my first exposure to frequency hopping was the RT-1209 military HF radio in 1988. It used frequency hopping to prevent detection, interception, and resistance to jamming. It used a preset set of frequencies to 'hop' between. This sequence was determined using a 'time of day' word that was programmed into the radios wishing to communicate.


WiFi on the other hand did not come into existence until 1998 - more than a decade after the military radio had already been fielded.

Lastly, this is not to diminish Ms. Lamarr - she did much to be proud of and it should be acknowledged. Instead this is meant to diminish the erroneous claims made by others."

If prices jumped to $1.50 or $1.75, that goes to $1.75 every time, even if the MSRP stays $1.25.

>A May 2017 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) found that the retreat of sea ice from the Arctic does indeed lead walruses to engage in mass haul-outs onto crowded beaches more often. And at those crowded haul-outs, the walruses are indeed easily spooked, with an increase in deadly ""disturbance"" events — though tramplings, especially of young calves, are much more common than cliff falls, according to that report.

DTJ before taking office was notorious for hiring small contractors for jobs and not paying them, preying on small firms that couldn’t afford lawsuits against him. In any other world that’s grand larceny and 10 years in federal prison. 

Before that he negotiated the largest tax break in NYC history, aka theft from the NY taxpayers, for over $150M in exchange for renovations on old buildings. This is what you’re most familiar with: the real estate business that made him a billionaire. Unfortunately that didn’t go too well, only really enough to keep by, so he turned to casinos. Anyone who knows casinos at the time knows trump had to be dealing with shady people. In fact he was. After bleeding millions to a professional gambler, trump went and had an Asian game put in the casino to make the money back from him. Over the period of a few weeks trump got every dollar back. *On casino credit.* But, before homeboy there could pay up his tab, the Yakuza slaughtered him. They then called DJT on the phone and told him they’d kill him in 3 months too. Aka, That was Yakuza money and trump wasn’t going to see a penny or he’d be dead. 

We can get into more, his real estate dealings in Russia, his complete breakdown and transition from real estate mogul to nameplate seller. His dealings with the mob and international crime syndicates. His inability to say KJ Il is a baddie. His complete disregard for American/Russian current affairs and tension. A complete disregard for the known fact russia intended and still intends to see America fail and die in a flaming wreck. Complacency for genocide. Complacency for sexual assault of which he’s a perpetrator. Complacency for his marriage and the political offices, appointing his children. His offensive and backwards tweets, his racist now nazi bolstering chickenhawk rhetoric. 

The list could honestly go on for days. With Obama at least I never had to talk about how fucking senile hoppedup on Sudafed and coffee he clearly is. I mean, honestly when you’re that age and you’re just on speeders, you’re not even alive."
