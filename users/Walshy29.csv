AskReddit,ff8qtsa,t3_es53p0,1579692301.0,"I dont think its right to judge anyone as boring. If one finds a person boring it could be that there's a lack of connection and that's okay. Some people bore me, I bore some people, but everyone has talents. I guess the only real bores are fascists and that's the best answer I can give. Pretty much everyone they treats people with respect has something to offer. In depressive stages, I can be boring. When I'm feeling good I'm dope. I think maybe the ability to be introspective subverts any boring part of a person, as it helps one grow beyond it. We all have strengths and weaknesses. It's best to accept them.

Also if you think a lot of people are a chore to be around, I have some news for you."
bipolar,ff6omp6,t3_eruej7,1579631645.0,"Yeah I feel you but I think I try not to hate even if I'm a little envious. I think the important factor here are the coworkers as oppossed to friends or partner. Like I'm not involved in their life and it's hard enough getting respect in the work place as a bipolar person, so that can sting if ones been under the radar while everyone else is more visible. And obviously, no one feels this way with friends because we love them and are proud of them / close with them. In an environment where people are uber competitive / try to play politics, it is hard."

Really fucked with me as I'm struggling w mental health and couldnt handle the fact someone was threatening me over cigarettes and money (that he decided I owed him based on nothing.) Dude was at my door screaming that my gf is a bitch even though hes never met her. Constantly knocked on my door for shit when I was trying to study for finals, and really threw off any semblance of balance I had in my life. He also would breakdown and beg me to confirm that we were friends just so he could continue harassing me for stuff."

bipolar,fcznvbr,t1_fcznaka,1578105335.0,"I'm glad the lamictal helped. I was similar in that I knew something was wrong but also denied how serious it was. Had been diagnosed with ocd and that was a trip so was not about being diagnosed bipolar. Part of it was nice because I knew people wouldn't give me as much shit having a real diagnosis but I also felt fake as hell. Also that's a really good way of putting bipolar problems with taking antidepressants. I feel like if I could have articulated that or heard that thought in high school (while I was on antidepressants) I would have noticed something more. Thought they weren't meant to be a fix, just help -- in reality they are very supportive for people with depression. Not us. Haha. Do you have a good neuro?"

Anyways, we spark up and kid has a huge breakdown. Talking gibberish, moving strangely. It was real sad to watch but also we didnt understand why he wasn't more honest about how much he smoked. I'm bipolar and also have ocd so I know how some med interactions can be, at the time I didnt have the same experience with mental health or medication so it was scary to see / yet I also didnt help the kid out enough due to lack of knowledge."

Most are good but everyone forgets that some are power tripping know it alls that will take away your autonomy so they feel in control. Psych wards are a trip. Just remember anyone judging you is a loser. Which I guess is hypocritical cause I just judged doctors but there are exceptions to everything. Anyways, good luck. I gotta tell you that first cigarette after discharge is unbelievable it's almost worth it. Try to have something to look forward to and read a ton."
bipolar,fczj6j5,t3_ejng4r,1578102407.0,I cant stop thinking about smoking weed. I've always been pretty addicted but my dude hasn't replied all day even though he said he would get it to me. It's more that I dont understand giving false info and it aggravates me as opposed to not being able to smoke. If he had said yesterday he wouldn't be able to help me then i wouldn't be worried about smoking. You know? Pretty tame compared to the awful thoughts I've been getting though.
bipolar,fcziwgc,t3_ejpflf,1578102234.0,"I talked to someone who said they had PTSD, OCD, and bipolar. As a person who has bipolar 1 and OCD I was skeptical but gave the benefit of the doubt.

bipolar,fcmgts8,t3_edllc7,1577774729.0,"So I have ocd in addition to bipolar 1. My doctor's best advice about intrusive and obsessive thoughts is to try to delay thinking about them. Say you have to picture a certain image or scenario in order to get an idea out of your mind. If you usually practice this compulsion immediately, then try to wait 1 minute before obsessing, then 5, and so on. I dealt with some awful obsessions in past but with this technique I drastically reduced them. I slip up sometimes but it's been key. The most difficult part to get over is the severity of each obsessive topic and the feeling that one is helping themselves by constantly reanalyzing them-- when in actuality this intensifies the obsession in degree and frequency."
