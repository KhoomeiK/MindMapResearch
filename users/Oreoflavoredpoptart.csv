dogs,fdicamb,t1_fdiaru9,1578439674.0,"It's the owner. I have many pits. They are just big love balls. Now I agree that a child should never handle a pit, but it is uncharacteristic for that dog to attack. Something is wrong with the dog's owner. Plus if a dogs being abused that should be a big concern. Dogs are living. There is more then one side to the story. That dog needs to be taken away from that owner from the public & the dogs benefit. That dog wouldn't do that is it wasn't previously abused. If that dog was handled properly it wouldn't be a concern. I'm saying it's the who own the dog's fault."
dogs,fdib61v,t1_fdfpmgl,1578439046.0,"This makes sad on both parts. I feel bad for your pups. I also feel bad for the pit, my favorite dog is a pit, they are very friendly dogs, so this dogs aggression is unnatural, this dog is obviously abused. Please find the owner of this dog and try and save this dog. I hope your dogs feel better soon."
