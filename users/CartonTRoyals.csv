WWE is very quickly putting themselves in a corner they may be unable to get out of.  They had the chance in 2018 to build Strowman up to be that next guy in line but they blew it.

Rollins needs a bigger guy not named Roman that he‚Äôll be main eventing with a decade from now. WWE needs another 05-2010 Batista and they need to find him now."
