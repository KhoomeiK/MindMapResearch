relationship_advice,ffat8a9,t3_esgfzl,1579743943.0,"I mean if I had a stalker, I'd tell my boyfriend about it as soon as it started making me uncomfortable. He wouldn't know anything about it but at least he'd be aware of the situation.
Considering you only found out about this ""stalker"" now looking at their messages, I wouldn't trust that she's being honest about it, unfortunately.
Wish you the best dude, I'm sorry you're going through this."

dating_advice,ff8pl2v,t3_es2lbj,1579690559.0,"Just want to say that I too used to be like that with my now fiance. It almost cost our relationship (I'm glad he was very patient with me lol). But in my case, recovery was through therapy and medication. I started taking fluoxitine and it really helped at first, but I kept having nightmares that he was cheating on me and what not. So my psychiatrist made me try lithium as well, and it helped me so much! I have pretty much no thoughts like that nowadays, and even when I do, I know it's my mind tricking me and I tell myself he's loyal (he always was).

I'm not saying everyone who feels this way needs to be on meds, I just want to share my experience. In my case, I had no time to try new hobbies. I'm glad that worked out for you and it's a much healthier way to deal with this rather than going on meds. 

I was in a stage in which I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I was doing terrible in college, couldn't study, I was putting pressure on him and me, and I couldn't even have a break of my own mind when I was sleeping. The paranoid thoughts were 24/7. I can't tell you enough how glad I am that I was able to recover from this, and that he stuck with me through it.

Sometimes our mind does really weird things to us."

Physics,ff1a4ap,t3_er1sfz,1579476750.0,"I don't think it's something unique about physics or sciences. I'm a history major and I feel that same way. It's an interesting concept, but it's frustrating"
studytips,fezq5em,t3_eqz3cn,1579460254.0,"Well, I'm in my last year of college, getting a History degree from a uni that's in the top five best in my country. I have great grades, have done research under supervision of one my professors, have atended many extra courses and volunteered in conferences. I speak 4 languages, two fluently, and I live in the biggest city in Latin America. Yet, I still haven't been able to find an internship. I've been to many interviews but none worked out. Maybe if you're from a small town, it'd be easier -- you'd know the people hiring and they'd know you. But at least in a big city, where you're just a complete stranger, it's a very difficult field to make a living out of.

It's a depressing reality but I don't mean to make you lose interest in it. I'm just letting you know how it is, a few years ago I was asking myself the same you are now, and I wish somebody had made me realize how much of a bad idea it is. 

If you want to get easily employed you should go for Management related degrees, or something to do with Tech. I spent the entire 2019 regretting my decision to study history (I got very depressed, it was very bad) and wishing I had gone for Economy, but now it's too late to change.

Although it's cool to know history, the job itself, wether is teaching or researching, is so exhausting. You never feel like you're reading and writing enough. You never feel like what you're making will be good enough. And teaching, as everyone knows, it's so frustrating -- we think we can make a difference, but really, most of the times we can't. 

Having that in mind, I'd recommend you to study history in your free time, and go to college for something more 'valued' in the job market. Coursera and other MOOC websites have excellent history courses from many different themes, taught by excellent professors. It can be a hobby of yours, and you'll feel much better about it rather then going to college for it and realizing your options have become incredibly limited."
aww,fezl6vw,t3_eqvyyb,1579458517.0,"11 years ago, my doggy was exactly the same. Just letting you know that he'll carry that toy FOR LIFE. Her first toy is to this day her favorite, even though nowadays it's falling apart lol. She's not trained but I can ask for it by make and she'll pick it up, it's really cute.
So if one day you happen to move houses, be careful with that toy because it'll most likely be very special to him :)
Oh and congrats on your sweet handsome boy ❤️❤️"

IWantOut,fdp4a6d,t1_fdote08,1578619653.0,"Hi! Thank you for your comment. I have looked into that:  my ancestors are from Spain and Taraclia (Moldova). But they came to Brazil around the 1930s, so I'm afraid the possibilities of citizenship through decent end with my father. He's interested in it as well, he's tried Spain but the process was complicated, now he thinks it's easier to get Romanian citizenship -- but he wants to do all that after he retires, in about three years.
Ps. My bf's family came from Italy around that same time, I have tried to look up his ancestors and gather the documents needed but his folks are disorganized with documents and don't seem to be interested in helping with that unfortunately."
