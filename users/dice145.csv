ontario,feth48i,t1_fetcywu,1579375399.0,"Man, are you always this combative when you reply to people? He said MP, and I added a comment saying it's MPP, and here you come trying to whip up an argument to make sure everyone agrees with the sentiment of your post. Give it a rest, honestly. Not everyone is well educated in politics (youth, new Canadians, etc) and knowing the difference is useful.

Yes, I find it concerning because I've taken the apparently radical position that if people are going to start engaging with politics, they ought to know what they're saying."
ontario,fess8q1,t1_fesrg1t,1579368486.0,"So, no. That's concerning."
ontario,fes2g95,t1_fere7ls,1579360712.0,Is that a rhetorical question or do you not see the importance of knowing the difference?

From reading your article, there are two primary issues: story structure/form and grammar.

The article is difficult to get through due to spelling errors and its lack of appropriate punctuation ‚Äî commas in particular.  When I started off, I had the same issue. I struggled to understand what constituted ""good writing"". My first ""Ah-Ha!"" moment came from reading [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.ca/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/020530902X/ref=asc_df_020530902X/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312865754052&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11838330860615760890&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000851&hvtargid=pla-405693442765&psc=1) by Strunk and White. This little pocket book guide  ‚Äî seriously, it's tiny  ‚Äî  will provide you with an easy reference to what it identifies as the 21 fundamental rules of good writing. I will note that it is not infallible, but it is a great tool for new writers. 

It is also important to consider how you offer information to your reader. I can see from the first paragraph that this likely isn't a concept that has been clearly presented to you. To get a better understanding of how to properly tell your story for news, I recommend you have a look at the following resources:

* [News Writing, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/25/writing.journalism.news)
* [Newswriting Basics](https://imgur.com/a/PutdlyL)

The resources above will greatly improve the quality of your work. However, we are all prone to simple mistakes, and most of us don't have the luxury of an editor to review our work before publishing. That's why my final recommendation is to use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). It doesn't replace the keen eye and sound wisdom of an editor, but it will stop you from including glaring mistakes in your work.

I hope you find this useful, and best of luck with your writing!"
Journalism,fdm9mj9,t3_eluhpt,1578543266.0,"Hey, thank you for posting this. Actually, you have very good timing. The purpose of this sticky was to avoid cluttering the sub's feed and to maintain a place where people new to journalism could ask common questions at a time when it was awash with the same questions.

Recently, I had been considering the possibility of letting posters use tags. This would allow people to sort and filter the sub to their preference. This is fairly common across reddit.

I'm currently away from my computer for the night, but I'll run this by the rest of the mods to see if they think it's something we could maintain."
Journalism,fdfeatx,t3_ekwj31,1578359677.0,Please keep Rule 1 and 2 in mind.
worldnews,fdcldln,t1_fdci4jk,1578277784.0,"Not true at all, though they frequently deny responsibility, which is a vital distinction. Here is a list of their direct suicide and terror attacks ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah#Alleged\_suicide\_and\_terror\_attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah#Alleged_suicide_and_terror_attacks)).

But putting aside the direct acts (which, really, we shouldn't), here's how they operate: the reality is Hezbollah trains, supplies and coordinates terrorist factions to conduct suicide bombings. They train, supply bombs and weapons, provide strategic military expertise and coordination to:  Islamic Jihad, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and, especially, Tanzim.

**More quick facts:**

* They are the world‚Äôs most heavily armed terrorist organization. 
* In 2016, Hezbollah's annual budget was $1 Billion.
* Iran funds 70% of Hezbollah's budget."
worldnews,fdcfr65,t1_fdcc54r,1578273798.0,Hezbollah has strapped bombs on childrens' chests to take out military personnel they're referring to here. How's that?
worldnews,fdcfin7,t1_fdbray5,1578273634.0,"Both, probably. This is also a great example of strategic messaging. Reading these comments, you might even forget that they have strapped bombs on young girls to take out the military targets they're speaking of here.

They don't give a shit about American civilians, but they know their weak points, and the moral ambiguity of this president and his actions is one of them. This is Hezbollah taking advantage of the situation. They aren't morally superior or taking the high ground. They're a violent, extremist organization. They scarcely concern themselves with human rights.

It's understandable, though, and a byproduct of the digital information age we live in. A lot of people here are young and get their news from half-sentence headlines and the comment section on social media (and that's not a slight at younger generations). Hell, the older generations have worse habits for their news consumption, if anything, but when it comes to analyzing what Hezbollah has just put out here, they are more likely to have context that will help them think critically about it. They'll be less vulnerable to this propaganda because they've been exposed to the atrocities Hezbollah commits."

But I do know that homophobia is prevalent in all communities and it should be talked about. That, to me, would be a legitimate conversation."
todayilearned,fcp1okt,t1_fcp1508,1577847753.0,"Ah, gotcha. I'd be more inclined to believe you can and should approach the issue from various perspectives--culture, community, legislative/government, etc., because each level would need to be addressed to bring about positive change. That would mean looking at each independently at times. But I see what you mean about the Trojan horse tactics. That kind of thing is nefarious and just about everywhere online. It's frustrating because it co-opts legitimate conversations."
todayilearned,fcp0w8r,t1_fcoyz1y,1577847077.0,"From my understanding, they were never in much of an institutional position to do so. But they're clearly not talking about this issue from a legislative standpoint, and it's perplexing why you've done so. They've stated they're talking about the black community."
