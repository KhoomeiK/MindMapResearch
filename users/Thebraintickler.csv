nonononoyes,ffcg9w2,t1_ffcfwdk,1579798817.0,"Weirdly things like pugs and bull dogs are the most surf-inclined surf dogs I have met, one would bark at people until they pushed him into another wave, and wouldn't get off the board (not for fear, but wanted to go again).  I've had a lot of dogs, none of them being super water loving myself, despite me giving them lots of options, so I never pushed them that way, despite them being much more capable in the water.  My malinois I have right now loves the ocean and the surf, but freaks out when she can't really touch, she lots runing out itnto the white water and ""body surfing"" back in, all on her own, she just does't like it when it gets too deep.  So it's definately kind of a dog dependendent thing."

I'm a scientist, this is cool information.  I did my PhD with volcanos, and worked with geologists (I'm a biologist) and it's funny how much you can learn and still blow your mind.  Have an upgoat."

And make friends with someone that skis or snowboards that has a car is really the only option. Flights to mammoth are cheapish, especially from airports like Ontario.  

Bear and summit are closer, and baldy is super close if it has snow, but mammoth is the only real place to ski. It’s like a 5hour drive so flying is worth it in my opinion, especially if you aren’t transporting skis."

I have one of the new ones that came with a kit and I’ve done it before, no real issues, I just prefer the old bevel because I’m scared of change."
