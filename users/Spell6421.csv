AskReddit,ff4wadu,t3_erhu3x,1579573977.0,"You know how in the last 5 seconds of a dream right before you wake up you KNOW that you're in a dream? Well in the real world I had been trying to lucid dream for the past week, and I wasn't having much success with it. I was dreaming that I was in my school standing in front of a vending machine, when those last 5 seconds started. I was about to surrender to my fate and wake up, and then I suddenly remembered that I has been trying to lucid dream. A split second before waking up as the dream started to go black and I began to open my eyes, I managed to wrench myself back into the dream, but it was lucid. For a second I was overwhelmed by the thought that I had managed to get myself into a sandbox dream world where I could control anything. The first thing I did? Just to test my newfound powers, I changed to chips in the vending machine in front of me into ice cream. I took out the ice cream and had a bite. Unfortunately this dream food was enough to push me into wakefulness, and I awoke disappointed that I had just thrown away a lucid dream because of my idiotic desire for ice cream."

>!Many years ago I saw this article about a non-op trans girl who kept being harassed by an annoyingly creepy bloke, who kept sending unsolicited pics of his dick. She didn't even know the guy, and had no idea how he managed to get her phone number.!<

>!She then proceeded to send her own (hard) dick pic. It was fucking glorious, she had such a lean, delicate feminine body and such huge throbbing cock. I went from zero to full mast in a matter of seconds. I guess it's due to the contrast of such a big beautiful dick in a gorgeous, lean and feminine body.!<

>!The harasser got grossed out, and I discovered feminine non-op/pre-op trans women are a blessing. For some reason I'm not so sure, I didn't save the article and it was from a kind of obscure news website, so I never managed to find it again. There was a similar episode that happened this year, but the one that changed me was from years ago and had uncensored pics.!<

>!I love them because there's just something alluring and magical about the contrast between a lean, delicate and feminine body, coupled with a huge and beautiful throbbing dick. As a bisexual man, I usually say it's the best of both worlds.!<

>!I think every dick is beautiful and amazing in their own right, though! No matter the size, shape or different characteristics they may have. Cocks, and especially girlcocks are a blessing and should be loved and appreciated!!<

>!Pussies are also fucking beautiful! I mean, the human body in general is astonishingly beautiful!!<

>!I also respect any and everyone's preferences, identities, attributes and orientations! And if anyone asks to be addressed as a different pronoun/gender/sex, I'll gladly do it!!<

>!One reason for which I'd recomend anyone confused and/or on the fence about dating a trans person: they were some of the most genuine and caring lovers I've ever had. There's this fear they have of never being able to ""find love"", because of all the hate, bigotry and prejudice everywhere – so when they get a chance at love, they make for some of the sweetest partners you could find.!<

>!I just really love to make sure they know they're appreciated, supported, loved and desired. They need and deserve love just as anyone else does, no matter the kind of genitals, identities, preferences or orientations they might have!!<

>!I haven't dated nor hooked-up with anyone in the last 3 years though, because I've lost the love of my life, on the day of our wedding, and I'm still not ready to move on – I still miss her so much.!<"
