hockeycirclejerk,ff9z7n4,t3_esdaik,1579724656.0,If Ovechkin never gets old and retires he could double Gretzky's goal record!
bartenders,ff9yud3,t1_ff9y4v7,1579724440.0,Yeah it also depends on the situation which is why I can't really speak with authority on this particular instance.  OP says they work in a hotel.  Maybe he/she serves mostly guests and management puts pressure on them not to cut them off. Or maybe they're more lenient with flagging people bc they know they're not driving. I know for sure working in NYC the last few yrs that I am wayyy more lenient bc hardly anyone is ever driving.  And this summer I worked in a new hotel on the beach and management was reluctant to piss off big $ customers by cutting then off. I just think people are jumping the gun and crucifying OP. Sounds like they may have had an error in judgment and they have learned from it.

devils,felhkcp,t1_felhagi,1579222337.0,I just mean maybe I'm giving too much weight to it. I like when players show respect for each other's game and here he was given the opportunity to do so and he saying his favorite player is himself.
devils,felg6mt,t1_felfo7j,1579221414.0,Pretty sure it started years ago when I saw one those vids where they ask players who their favorite players at other positions are and he kept saying 'Me' which made me think he was a pompous ass. And I'm not a fan of players with egos. But I'm prob wrong bc everyone else seems to like him. Maybe just left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't really watch Washington so dont see much of him.

devils,fdsjc3v,t1_fdqkubj,1578703856.0,In reality someone should be working with Wood to develop some go-to breakaway moves. Even if he was to take it upon himself to train with someone. He'd be dangerous bc it seems like he gets an opportunity at least once per game. I don't get excited either bc by the time he gets to the goal he just tosses the puck to the goalie. Coaches should be taking advantage of the fact that he gets these chances.
