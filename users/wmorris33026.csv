Their supporters are susceptible to this behavior. The fact that anyone would have their opinions confirmed by seeing their senator playing with a fidget spinner during the impeachment of the president of the United States illuminates how far down the rabbit hole democracy has gone, led by this group of bottom dwellers. They should be ashamed."
