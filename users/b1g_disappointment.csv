Asians don't (naturally) have more than one eye/hair color. Making them a lot less unique from each other. I literally can't tell between the difference between the faces of korean pop stars or most any asians really.

And black/really dark brown eyes are really unattractive as well, because it blends with the pupils and loses definition. Kind of a ""souless"" look if you will. And straight, stiff black hair not only absorbs all colors and look like dead space, but also there's no definition in it.

Granted, here whore doesn't mean the same as breeder, but the word itself carries more power within the system of English language, even though to us, a breeder is someone who's more sinful than a whore.

Instead of accusing someone of ""lacking the mental fortitude"", try and understand what the other person is saying. If you have that mental power, why do you lack the ability to understand my point?

dating_advice,fe77zth,t3_enxbre,1578911155.0,That's just blatantly not true. People **do not** see you as you see yourself.
antinatalism,fe754wz,t1_fe73kjc,1578910161.0,Right but most people don't really care if they saw this. Natalists actively fight for life to be created.

antinatalism,fe74wsa,t3_eo0b76,1578910066.0,Fuck off whore you aren't a saint for doing this.
ForeverAlone,fe6xols,t1_fe612gt,1578907357.0,"People often think I'm racist because I point out all the points where asian men are inferior to white men (height, size, etc). They act if there is no gap just because they are on the lucky side.

What do you mean you don't have to pay for theme parks?"
ForeverAlone,fe6xm40,t1_fe6qn9b,1578907250.0,"HAPAs are usually quite popular in my experience. I had a HAPA friend who went to a restaurant and he didn't have to pay because the girl at the counter thought he was handsome and paid for his lunch.

Out of curiosity, your maternal side is asian right?"
ForeverAlone,fe5j25z,t1_fe5c3em,1578870112.0,I know.
ForeverAlone,fe5dq1i,t1_fe4drs0,1578868181.0,"Yeah I'm kinda ""whitewashed"". It doesn't work to my advantage at all.

First impression from others before I speak is usually that I'll have an asian accent when I don't.

And having this body makes me repulsive to most women."
ForeverAlone,fe5df0h,t1_fe5bwlu,1578868052.0,How did you two meet?
antinatalism,fe52yby,t3_ensb31,1578865197.0,"Who TF cares about lineage. The ‚Äúgreat things‚Äù they did were done with the intentions to improve the future.

That‚Äôs what we are doing. Of all the people they mentioned, none of them did anything that tops what we do to terminate suffering."
ForeverAlone,fe4roy5,t1_fe4r3u8,1578862171.0,"Compared to AMWF, AFWM is much more common. It‚Äôs like the ratio of regular people to albinos."
ForeverAlone,fe4h7zi,t1_fe4ewlw,1578859248.0,"I'm not a girl so I can't give you the answer to that.

But from what I can gather there are three main groups. The weebs, the open-minded, and the ""normies"".

Weebs obviously like k-pop and all that weird shit (for some reason I can't relate) and therefore obsess themselves with asian culture.

The open-minded are the ones who don't care about what race you are, the only kind who might date me for what I am instead of what skin color I have. But they are rare.

And finally the normies are the ones who associate asians with the old asian-american media, where they are very emasculate (which physically, kinda true, we are generally shorter and have smaller penises), therefore not attractive."
antinatalism,fe43ee0,t1_fe251ci,1578855411.0,At this point I'm too weak to want to stay alive. Everything sucks. There is no hope.
ForeverAloneDating,fe3ux1b,t1_fe3sz7j,1578853141.0,"For the lack of a better phrase. ""Common Europeans"" are the ones who show up on media very often, like the Brits, French, Germans, etc."
antinatalism,fe3ujwx,t1_fe3uc79,1578853036.0,How can you be the ancestor of a long line of antinatalists?
