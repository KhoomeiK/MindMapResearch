Everyone who still uses 7 has their reasons, just let them be. Their PC isn't going to go out in a firery blaze of death and stolen credit card info just because they haven't got 10 yet."

That's not what's going to happen. People will still be perfectly safe, until some kind of new exploit come around. How long that will take, nobody knows. But as of right now, everything is fine. 

Don't listen to the people overreacting, it only clouds your own judgement.

Oh, and just in case, get an adblocker and some good security software. It doesn't cover everything, but it helps keep you safe."
