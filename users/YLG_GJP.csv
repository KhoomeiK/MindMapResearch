PokeMoonSun,fdwqocc,t1_fdtu3dp,1578761395.0,"To get Sylveon, the Eevee needs to have at least two hearts of affection. You get affection by using Pokémon Refresh, you need to pet your and feed Pokébeans to your Pokémon. Remember to talk to the coffee shop guys in the Pokécenter to get some extra beans."
PokeMoonSun,fdwp1kv,t3_en31hc,1578760955.0,"You can get Pichu and Cutiefly (Ribombee's pre-ev) in the first island. Pichu is in the route on the right from your house and you can catch Cutiefly short after beating the first Trial. You can find Eevee in route 6 (or 7, I don't remember exactly the name) after beating the Water Trial in the second island, it's in the route that's right between Paniola Ranch and Royal Avenue. I don't remember exactly where Stufful is, but it's also in the second island.
EDIT: Forgot to say it first, you can evolve Pikachu into Raichu after beating the Fire Trial, the story will make you go to the city in the southern area of the Island and there you'll be able to get a Thunder Stone."

PokeMoonSun,fczntvf,t1_fcxlm4x,1578105309.0,"""Trap"", used in a certain context, is a slur for the trans community, specially for trans women. I get people normally don't try to use it like a slur or with the intention of offending trans people and it's usually used just like a ""joke"" term, but like, there are other ways to refer to a ""trap"" that won't offend people."
PokeMoonSun,fczncwv,t1_fcxhr0j,1578104998.0,"I honestly wanna think OP didn't tried to used it like that and just meant like a literal trap and not the trans slur, but I know that ain't the case."
suddenlybi,fcz8csi,t1_fcz5wov,1578095724.0,"Kinda have a different opinion there: I think if someone who is bi is in a relationship, no matter if it's with a guy, a woman or a nb person, it's still a bi relationship. Or, to say it in another way, if a bi guy is dating a gay guy it'd be a bi-gay relationship, not just a bi or gay relationship."
