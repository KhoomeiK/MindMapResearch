fitbit,fehrequ,t3_ep39ec,1579122375.0,"Here is the main problem with what you're trying to do. Smart Lock requires an always on, Classic Bluetooth connection. This would kill the battery in your Fitbit pretty quickly so instead, Fitbit uses a different version of Bluetooth called Bluetooth Smart or Low Energy Bluetooth. It isn't always on and connected. Instead it is on only when you are engaged with the Fitbit app on your phone or periodically in the background to transmit data from the device to the app. Smart Lock doesn't work because until you unlock your phone and open the app, chances are your Fitbit isn't connected via Bluetooth to your phone for Smart Lock to recognize it. 

This is why the notifications usually lag a couple seconds behind from when they appear on your phone. In order to get the notification from the app to the Versa the phone has to quickly re-establish the Bluetooth connection. 

Other devices that are more traditional smart watches have an always on Bluetooth connection. Samsung Wear and Apple Watches for example, but they also need to be charged most every day where the Fitbit does not."
AskReddit,fegkbsu,t3_ep1l2j,1579095372.0,"My oldest son was born about a year before my grandfather passed away. He was a father-figure in my life due to my biological father not being around and my mom and I living with them for a number of years when I was a kid. I confessed to him that I was terrified of being a father because I hadn't had mine around much to model after. He told me the general advice first; that I would be fine, all parents are winging it, trust my instincts, etc. But what he told me at the end was what has stuck with me. He told me when raising children I have to choose whether to prepare the world for my child or my child for the world but that it was impossible to do both. It has been something I have thought about in nearly every major decision I've made in parenting."
fitbit,fegjnzz,t1_fegiy6r,1579094810.0,Fitbit support have been very helpful in replacing trackers that don't function as they should so long as you're within (or at least near) the warranty dates. They give you a year from the purchase date for all of their devices. I have yet to get one that didn't get replaced during the warranty.
fitbit,fef24aj,t3_eot95f,1579046381.0,"They replaced mine when the thing froze, then it did this same thing last week but they said they can't replace a replacement tracker. But they did give me a 40% off code. So I have a Versa 2 coming in the mail later this week."

fitbit,fdhosrl,t3_elfein,1578427161.0,I get less of the awake blips when I am exhausted. But normal sleep I get them a lot.

bulletjournal,fc665dw,t1_fc5uvyu,1577473154.0,Thanks. It's from a Brene Brown book I read recently.
bulletjournal,fbmilcd,t3_eduzqx,1576984317.0,"I had a Hustle Co. journal for 2019. It was good but the binding was starting to fail at the end of the year. I went a little nicer and got a Dingbats journal for 2020. We will see, but the pages feel nice and thick."
