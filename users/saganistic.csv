While I agree with you 100% the pushback on this will always come from two types of people:

1. Those who already have no expenses because they’re either lucky or just refuse to go to the doctor regardless;

2. Those who have so much money that the expenses are trivial, but stand to pay more in taxes. 

And unfortunately, both of those groups turn out to be really vocal and politically active, and they’re always going to come back with a thousand reasons why it’s too expensive and can’t work (even though it isn’t and it can). And apparently that includes some of the media now.

If you’re going to follow this reasoning it would actually be equally relevant whether the **RB** has dark skin/a dark jersey, not just the QB. And if the defense is properly playing an RPO, the backside defender isn’t usually tasked with pursuing the RB to the playside in the first place, and should be ready to commit to the QB regardless. Yeah, there are variations of the option where both run to the playside, but it’s not nearly as relevant a factor as a bunch of other things. 

It’s just a weird comment and it has uncomfortable racial implications attached to it given the historical stereotyping of black players at the position as “running” QBs rather than passers. So I can see why there is some backlash to it.

edit: ffs people I didn’t call the guy racist, I said that it *could* be interpreted as relating to historical stereotyping, hence why it would upset some.

nfl,fcsyidt,t1_fcr2s31,1577928308.0,"“Stretching” is a vague and broad term. There are multiple types of mobility work, each of which has a purpose and appropriate use. The general term “stretching” is typically interpreted to mean the static type, which is useful for improving mobility at the extremes of range of motion when performed with the correct technique. As it has a tendency to decrease force output in the muscles involved for a period of time afterwards, it is generally advised post-training. 

Many people believe that static stretching has to do with forcing tendons and muscles to lengthen; that is actually the opposite of the truth. Properly-executed static stretching—also referred to as Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation, or PNF for short—is focused on moving into a position of tension, forming a mind-muscle connection with the intended muscle group, and then relaxing said muscle in order to move into greater extension. Over time, this teaches the CNS that the muscle is capable of increased extension without injury, and delays or lessens the stretch reflex that causes excessive muscle tension at the limits of mobility. It is very effective when properly programmed and consistently performed in combination with strength training."
nfl,fcro8kk,t1_fcpespe,1577904405.0,"Assuming we’re not talking about things like bruises or abrasions, dynamic stretching prior to activity, followed by PNF stretching afterwards, as well as training the involved muscle groups through a wide range of motion. The human body is incredibly flexible when the CNS is turned off, but far less mobile when it’s engaged. That’s why drunk or unconscious people that rag-doll during accidents can come away with minimal injury. You have to literally train your nervous system to allow your limbs to move beyond a certain range of motion, otherwise the active tissues will refuse to go into extension and that causes the excess force to damage the tissue and/or be transmitted to ligaments and tendons. 

There are certain kinds of movement that will unavoidably damage ligaments—for example, a lateral or medial force to the knee on the coronal plane is going to blow that joint out no matter how mobile you are—but those are pretty extreme and fall under plain old bad luck. If there’s a history of higher-than-average rates of non-catastrophic sports injuries (e.g. hamstring strains/tears, groin pulls, shoulder impingement) then it speaks to a poorly-constructed conditioning program with an insufficient focus on mobility. Additionally, certain exercises can pose a higher risk of soft tissue injury on their own; a program that includes too many of these would contribute to the issue of unusually high injury rates.
