Its good if you want to know more about sachin and his personal life. Also makes you appreciate Sara for the sacrifices she made. The kids are cute and the way Sachin plays with them, you realize he really is a simple family man at heart."

bollywood,ff2vybm,t3_er4rm9,1579526225.0,"Indian 'acting' is based on natyashastra and classical dances in which loud, clear expressions are given importance. Many actors are also involved in stage dramas, where subtlety doesn't work because the audience sits at a distance. Indian audience is used to them and doesn't notice subtlety, and frankly new actresses are simply bad.


As for examples of good Indians actresses, I think the ones you mentioned are talented but they have to do the silly stuff for the masses. They have been subtle when the role demands, like Sridevi in English Vinglish or Madhuri in Mrithyudand. The difference between old and new, I feel, is that old actors put their entire self, specially their eyes and hands. New actors just feel shallow and bland compared to them."

1. The congress doesn't want garib and backwards of the country to progress or prosper so they can keep getting votes on freebies instead of policies and stuff.

2. The intellectuals/social workers don't want them to prosper as well because they take pleasure in helping them. If there are no downtrodden people, how will they find meaning in their life? How will they feel superior, humane and intelligent?"

Right now Diner Dash is one of the top games on play store. I tried it out of curiosity and it is not even enjoyable. The game loads for 5 minutes and makes you click for every round, which lasts maybe 2 minutes and doesn't require any strategy, skill or anything.

All top games on play store are similar. I see 5-12 year olds spending hours playing these games and I'm seriously worried at what its doing to their brains."

I've seen this on facebook too. A few educators I follow are suddenly spreading fake news and fear. They are posting excerpts from books which paint Pakistan as a tolerant society going out of its way to protect the minorities. The surprising thing is that no one is countering them - which I think is either due to them removing such comments or restricting who can comment."
indiadiscussion,fc1zd4d,t3_efkeh8,1577334544.0,"There was a time when I trusted the comments on Reddit, but these days it is two types of comments which get popular - either those pushing products or narratives. Anything critical gets buried or removed.

Even then, that thread is a special type of deluded presentation. Adivasis being pushed into selling lands, where did this happen? Students getting threatened? And oh, speaking as if internet shutdown is an atrocity as bad as genocides and detention centers are same as concentration camps. 

It is obvious these people know nothing of how things are done in other countries. Almost all countries who get large number of refugees/migrants need to set up detention centers and yes, most of them are in terrible state. 

No country treats minorities as special little miracles and each and every one of them places the security and well-being of its citizens first."
