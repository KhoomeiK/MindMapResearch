I am fortunate to have a job which provides me insurance, and I ended up paying about $20/ week. I understand this may be unaffordable. There a lot of other affordable options that offer you someone to talk to without the expensive degree/certification. I would say to look into it and don‚Äôt get discouraged quickly. Also, therapists are like locks and you are a key. You‚Äôre gonna most likely bounce around to find a good match. Best of luck friend, and feel free to PM me about my extensive, dramatic, enlightening experiences over the past 13 years with therapy. Sending good vibes."

Beyond that, there‚Äôs a certain feel to copy pastas. My advice for best practice is if there is a suspicious wall of text, throw it into google to check. You can also read posts in r/copypasta to get a feel for the type of post that is copy pasta‚Äôd. Hope this helps. 

(Copy pasta is an extremely fluid concept. If the correct people get their hands on it, this post itself could be a copy pasta....)

boomershumor,fc221c9,t1_fc1ypl9,1577337299.0,"Not sure who‚Äôs right in this whole thing, but I‚Äôm super interested because, as a Jew, I have been recently considering the fact that I would want to fully celebrate Christmas with my kids when the time comes. I love all of the secular parts of Christmas, I love the Santa story, the magic, the family times, the tree, the decor, the cheesy songs. It‚Äôs my favorite time of year. I acknowledge channukah and light a channukiah, but my family has a big turkey dinner on Christmas. I am not at all interested in the religious aspects of the holiday, as I am committed to my Jewish faith (no matter how little I observe). I have been considering whether other Jews or Christians would be upset at this decision. I understand that most would be ok, but to the argument that it would not be technically celebrating Christmas, I say tough shit - deal with it. People in the US who don‚Äôt celebrate Christmas have had it so bashed into their culture that there‚Äôs almost no choice but to celebrate in some fashion. And it‚Äôs Christmas. If the Christian religion thinks the commercialization of Christmas celebration makes it not Christmas, than millions of Christians who loosely adhere to the religion are not technically celebrating Christmas. We are all celebrating Christmas. I would hope those who don‚Äôt see it that way would be able to just be happy that we all want to celebrate together."
