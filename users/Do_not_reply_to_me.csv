The reason I'm pursuing this is because the word 'chose' is a loaded term which implies agency. Until anyone speaking on this subject can drop the use of the word 'chose' and other similarly loaded words it betrays a lack of acceptance of the randomness of the processes involved.

It might not be significant. /u/AeroStatikk might be totally on board with the unguided nature of evolution but they aren't giving that impression by continuing to use that particular word.

> for reason's that aren't clear, a large motorcycle gang surrounded a black Range Rover on New York City's West Side Highway, forcing the SUV to stop. The SUV's driver, who was reportedly traveling with his wife and five-year-old daughter, runs over two of the bikes and speeds off. The bikes give chase — one of the motorcyclist's helmet cam captures the entire chase — and follow the Range Rover as it eventually exits into Manhattan. At a stoplight, the gang again attempts to get to the driver, pulling open his door, before the SUV drives away. The gang catches up to the SUV at another stoplight, at which point one rider takes off his helmet and smashes in the Range Rover's passenger window. Then the camera cuts off.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff5v4vd,t1_ff5svpo,1579611317.0,"Edit 3: *My understanding of contraceptives is apparently based on outdated information. Reading /u/LilJourney's reply elsewhere in this post gave me pause for thought.*

*Articles like the one below do a good job of nullifying the 'prevents implantation' angle:  
https://rewire.news/article/2008/08/22/much-ado-about-nothing-prolife-misconceptions-about-contraception/*

*I've always found the NHS information pages to be very reliable so I'm not going to remove my comment entirely, it was (is) based on a trusted source*

&nbsp;

That depends on what you call a 'pregnancy'.

The combined pill has multiple effects, one of which is to cause a fertilised egg to be less likely to implant successfully in the lining of the uterus.

If you regard a fertilised egg as being one step along the path of being pregnant, then the pill is 'aborting' that process from continuing.

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/combined-contraceptive-pill/

> The pill prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month (ovulation). It also:
>
> * thickens the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate the womb and reach an egg
>
> * thins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow

'*prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month*' and '*thins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow*"" almost seem contradictory, but there is a chance an egg will be released even when on the pill.

Without knowing exactly which pill /u/Bitchinkitchen1901 is taking, it's hard to say whether all of this applies to her. Regarding the 'uninformed' state of the troll that OP works with, we don't know for sure either. She might know all of this.

Edit: It occurs to me that the pills available in the US may have a different combination of hormones, so my answer may only be accurate for the UK. I'd be interested to hear more about that.

Edit 2: I don't want to give the impression that I'm defending OP's troll workmate. OP should be free to choose whatever contraception she desires and that lady should keep her mouth shut."

This works in many cases. People are fallible and *most* people aren't overtly malicious. She could easily have thought (naively) that she had a protected turn."

I drive a manual car, and have done ever since I got my license 20 years ago. I change gear by pushing the clutch down, moving the stick and bringing the clutch back up. It's a quick process, takes less than half a second if I'm in a hurry.
