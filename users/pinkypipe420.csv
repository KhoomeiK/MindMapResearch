The only thing strange was Onion's actions during the incident (i.e. filming it)  Yeah, the ""deep voice"" part was weird, but then it goes on to say that Onion thought it was the son, until he went into the house to find the son watching tv.  The report actually seemed very thorough.

The best i can do is tell you that you have another person that cares about you. (Well, two, really.) Me, but also the friend you mentioned that asked you to post this. That person obviously cares about you enough to point you to a place where others want to try to help.

In a little bit of harsh truth: don't rely completely on your GF for emotional support. That is too much stress on her, and isn't fair to her. I don't know her, but I'm guessing she wants an equal relationship, and not one where she has to be the rock for both. I'm not saying break up with her, but, I promise if you try and talk to more than one friend, you will start to feel a little better. 

Your friends will start to have a better understanding of what your going through, and they may suprise you. Just look them in the eye and ask ""can you help me?"" Even if it's just to get out of your headspace.

When I find myself spiraling again, I have to force myself to work on a project that requires my concentration. Forcing myself up and at 'em will snap me out of that headspace, most of the time.

I know opening up is hard and vulnerable, when you already feel vulnerable. 

If you find yourself having a hard time talking, there are crisis texting lines where you can text a real person to discuss things with.

Text HOME or MATTERS to 741741 (u.s.).  Canada's is 686868. UK's is 85258. 

If talking to a faceless stranger for anonymity is easier, you can call 1-800-273-TALK. 

Please know you're not alone. There are people who care."
