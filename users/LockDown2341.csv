relationships,ffeb5cr,t1_ffeahz7,1579841848.0,"Except I do actually. Nice false assumption bud. Two and a half years married and a 15 year relationship.

It is her problem. If she is jealous and insecure over a platonic friendship, her issue. If she has do much trouble trudging her spouse that she falsely accuses him of an affair, her issue.

The backbone of a solid and happy marriage is absolute trust. If I were to put myself or my wife into this situation there would be no fighting, no arguments, no yelling, and no stupid false accusations. Because we trust each other.

Now you are right on the team effort part. If there was an issue we would of course talk it out. The only selfish part is being jealous that your spouse spends an inordinate amount of time with a friend.

This ""douchebag"" as you referred to him simply found someone with a common interest. It sounds like it's not an interest many people have and it's certainly not something his wife has. Now OP has gone and ruined that completely. And for what?

Go run off then. It's literally not insane at all whatoever for people to trust each other enough to not feel insecure. I'd say YOU are the one with the shitty marriage if your husband is that insecure over your ""many male partners."""

You were completely out of line doing this with no evidence. Your husband found a good friend with a shared interest and you ruined it.

The endings are determined by how any people you embrace. You didn't embrace her so it doesn't affect the ending.

You don't need the hints anyway. They increase XP when you embrace them. Not embracing them? Then it's pointless outside of a small XP gain.
