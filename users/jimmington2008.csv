I was basing my decisions on the few bad experiences I had heard about of people on biologics, even though that is what I needed. I finally decided that the risks of biologics are nothing compared to the complete misery I was in when I couldn't even walk anymore because my feet were completely taken over by psoriasis and none of the hocus pocus holistic crap I tried had done a damn bit of good. I should have just listened to my dermatologists in the first place and saved myself an additional 3 months of suffering unnecessarily."

AutoImmuneProtocol,ff6fifi,t3_erw2od,1579626076.0,"I've been seeing a naturopath since July and, in my opinion, it's been a waste of time and money. I was already doing AIP before I started seeing her and all she did was tell me to buy some ""cleanse"" for the liver and a bunch of supplements. The liver is a self-cleansing organ so I have never understood this liver cleanse bullshit, but, in an attempt to try everything I could to help my psoriasis, I bought the stupid cleanse and did it for 2 weeks. I bought the digestive enzymes, the castor oil, the dry skin brush, all the crap she told me to buy. From July to October, I had absolutely no change in my psoriasis despite following AIP and following every instruction the naturopath gave me.

Maybe your experience will be different than mine but that was my experience and if I could go back, I would not waste the time and money. Now I'm on a biologic since October and my skin is actually almost completely clear. Sometimes all the ""miracle cures"" that seem too good to be true are exactly that."

I strongly disagree that every doctor is heavily flawed... I've had great experiences with my doctors. I decided to try AIP before biologics just to see if it would help my psoriasis but it didn't so I decided to listen to the three dermatologists who told me that I need to be on a biologic to help my palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. I have had no side effects from the biologic I'm on. 

Keep in mind that thousands of people use biologics and have great results with little to no side effects. You just don't hear about those people as much as the very few people who have bad experiences. It's kinda like how a bad review of a business will spread much faster than a good review."

You should never ""blindly"" trust anybody. If your doctor tells you something and you don't understand or you question its validity, ask questions. Get a second opinion. AIP is a very strict protocol and can be a great tool for helping individuals identify foods that may or may not be triggers for their conditions but it's certainly not for anybody and it is not meant to be followed long-term. It doesn't even guarantee that it will put whatever autoimmune condition you have into remission. I have psoriasis and after close to 3 months of AIP, I had absolutely no improvement in my psoriasis. So then I went on a biologic and now I have my life back. Do not discount ""traditional medicine"" just because there are a bunch of snake oil salesmen trying to tell everybody that scientifically backed treatments and medication will make them sicker."

Psoriasis,feoh91t,t3_epu0su,1579300090.0,"Hi! I have palmoplantar psoriasis which affects the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet.

I found that wearing flip flops really dried my feet out and made them more uncomfortable. I recommend looking for a lightweight, breathable sneaker type of shoe. Also, cotton socks will just soak up the sweat and stay damp, at least in my experience. You might want to try wool socks or athletic socks made from synthetic material which will help wick the sweat away from your feet.

I wash my feet with CeraVe Psoriasis Cleanser which contains salicylic acid and helps dissolve the dead skin and flakes. Then I apply a moisturizer, usually a urea cream or something thick like Aquaphor. I also like to soak my feet most nights for about 30 min in a salt bath (dead sea or epsom salt) before I apply my steroids (I use Enstilar). The descaling guide has some good tips and product recommendations:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/wiki/descaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/wiki/descaling)

It's only like a 5 mile hike out and back but the trail is pretty much completely exposed, very little shade (if any), daytime summer temps are often 90+ degrees. You hike down to the falls and then you have to hike back up to get out. People are rescued from that trail nearly every single day in summer because there is always some genius that thinks it's a good idea to start the hike at noon with one bottle of water for a group of four. This past summer there was a family from NJ who was hiking the trail in the middle of the day and didn't think they could make it back.

I use Enstilar regularly and I'm on Stelara, these are the only things that have actually helped control the flare ups with the pustules but I still get a lot of dead skin on my feet.

Besides Enstilar and Stelara, I follow the tips in the [descaling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/wiki/descaling) in the wiki for this sub. My favorite products are CeraVe Psoriasis Cleanser and PurSources urea cream. I use the 40% urea ceam. I apply the urea in the mornings after showering and washing my feet with the CeraVe cleanser. I often soak my feet in a salt bath in the evening before I apply my Enstilar but some nights I don't get around to the salt bath. I also like Aquaphor for when I just want a thick moisturizer.

Lots of trial and error to find what works best for you but don't give up. I've found that the most important thing is just staying consistent with medications, descaling and keeping your skin moisturized."
