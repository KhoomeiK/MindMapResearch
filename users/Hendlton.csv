worldnews,ffc1ofk,t1_ffbyw8e,1579789290.0,But a water bomber can carry tons of water instead of hundreds of kilograms.
LivestreamFail,ffaduen,t1_felh6zy,1579733245.0,"I stopped at the end of season 4 back when it aired, because it seemed like a good end point and season 5 didn't really interest me. I finished it last year and it was way better than I could have imagined."
space,ff07o1t,t1_fezv714,1579466088.0,I thought it was always Big Falcon Rocket because they can't put Fucking on the reports.
space,fezu0sw,t1_fezsoai,1579461645.0,"Tesla models are S, 3 and X. Their rocket is called the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket). Musk seems to love things like that."

todayilearned,fen08a0,t1_femdjwo,1579274041.0,Could they not announce it a year or so in advance and have the people adjust?
videos,fejtk5o,t1_fejs3v7,1579185513.0,Probably more than a stranger. They were going through the same hell together and one just happened to be luckier than the other.
todayilearned,fehqwq9,t1_fehm0ap,1579122089.0,"I bought my Nike shoes about 6 months ago and they're still as good as the day I bought them. I wore my previous (not Nike) shoes for five years though, so I'll see how these compare."
nottheonion,fegbopp,t1_fefxqwz,1579086567.0,"You don't hold it by the handle, you hold it near the tip. That's why it's so unsanitary, as well as being disgusting to watch."
todayilearned,feae64e,t1_fe9ksxt,1578947517.0,I had a guy open his door to give me the middle finger once. I guess his window wasn't working or something.

news,fe93o5p,t1_fe7zoek,1578933801.0,"Innocent people get executed all the time and even the guilty ones don't always deserve the death penalty IMO. The whole affair is already cruel (plenty of botched ones), morally wrong (two wrongs don't make a right) and unusual, since the US is one of a handful of countries where it's still practiced. It would be at least somewhat improved if the decision had some weight instead of requiring someone to just make up their mind about the defendant being guilty."
news,fe7gf8i,t1_fe6k3ib,1578914305.0,"I've got an idea. Make the jury perform the execution. How many of them would condemn a man to death without being 100% sure, if they had to shoot him themselves?"
news,fe7fpxu,t1_fe5wqmy,1578914032.0,Nazis tried it. AFAIK it was really messy and took way too long. Maybe they improved it at some point.
news,fe7eihf,t1_fe6lplk,1578913533.0,"It's both nitrogen and helium. They're relatively non reactive gasses so they, by themselves, do no harm to the body. That's why it's a painless way to die."
todayilearned,fe7cdot,t1_fe6l2kb,1578912741.0,"I'm pretty sure that was the point. I don't know if this is true, but I remember reading that the US said they were going to drop a nuke every day until Japan surrendered. They only had two nukes, but Japan didn't know that."
worldnews,fe2lldl,t1_fe2h8ri,1578840026.0,"It doesn't matter at that point. They'd never see anything military before the paperwork is done so it doesn't matter that they can technically ""join"" at 15. It's still 16 to start training anyway."
worldnews,fe2lcgw,t1_fe0y7ey,1578839879.0,">Even now, nobody questions why a regular muslim would wake up one morning and decide to go get killed?

worldnews,fdwum9b,t1_fdws87u,1578762446.0,"But if the gun is in a separate case inside your suitcase, are they then not allowed to open the suitcase? I thought in that situation they just couldn't open the gun case."

worldnews,fdwq5ho,t1_fdt8jvf,1578761318.0,"How many people know about the failure rate? I bet if you just went around asking people, most if not all of them would think TSA stops all of the terrorists. After all, there haven't been any major attacks since 9/11, so it must be working, right?"

worldnews,fdm5x1s,t1_fdl7yfs,1578540577.0,"Never going to happen. America would rise up and burn the country down once even the cheapest t-shirts cost 50$. If you're going to pay workers 10$ an hour instead of 1$ an hour, you can't keep product prices the same."
worldnews,fdjohis,t1_fdjmqeq,1578480890.0,"Because they're very accurate and hit exactly where you aim them. 

They get to parade around their cities celebrating the supposed death of dozens of Americans and the alleged destruction of equipment worth millions of dollars, while America can play the bigger man and turn the other cheek."
