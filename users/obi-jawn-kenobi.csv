food,fenqlcq,t1_fenje7m,1579289356.0,"If you ever come to my area, I will show you the vast difference between a hoagie roll and a French roll.  It's more than just texture, it's sandwich logistics or engineering or whatever.  The hoagie roll is more absorbent and is designed to pocket the food in an enclosed way, allowing it to be eaten in transit with minimal drops and drips.  It was essential in tying the cheesesteak to the working class/blue collar lunch identity which is what caused it to be so synonymous with the working-class and immigrant population of South Philadelphia.  

Class division aside, the French roll let's everything spill out.  It forces you to sit over a plate and probably scoop up remains with a fork.  Trying to eat one like a cheesesteak will be a mess.  It's a steak sandwich, a base sandwich where steak is the main ingredient.  A cheesesteak is an entity all its own with similar ingredients but different structure.  For instance, at Panera there is a sandwich with steak, cheese, and arugula that is absolutely a steak sandwich but not a cheesesteak."

They don't want someone they consider an outsider and not ""in the know"" to have a leg up.  They don't want upward mobility because they believe it means downward mobility or stagnation for themselves.

Major corporations and companies that want to remain competitive have had a huge paradigm shift to paid internships over the past 20 years.  You can find them on job boards like LinkedIn or at your college  career center.  Many times, full time employee students can come to an agreement between an advisor and their employer to take on additional duties relevant to the course material so that you don't have to give up hours at a paid job."
YouShouldKnow,fea84nw,t1_fea26zq,1578945480.0,"Yes.  Most major corporations will have paid internships.  They've become more common over the past 20 years.  These days if you don't have a paid internship you are ruining your own credibility and making yourself undesirable to talented college students.

Paid internships breed competition by attracting a larger pool of interview candidates and higher level of talent among them.  Lower paid college internships generate another level of competition among great students who didn't get the better paying internships and other good students vying for a paid internship.

If you have a full time job, can explain why your position is relevant to your coursework, and you can take on additional responsibilities (especially for management or operations tasks), most colleges will allow you to use that as your internship...this you are still getting paid.

These days, if you are getting an unpaid internship then it is because you either don't know where to find a paid one, didn't know your options and how best to pursue them, or didn't fully chase for your worth."
