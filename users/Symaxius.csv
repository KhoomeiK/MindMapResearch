AskReddit,ff70w3v,t3_erv0ao,1579638899.0,"So I'm a bit naive as you'll soon understand. I love reflexology, it's so damn relaxing. Well one day, having got the train from Yorkshire to London for work and after miles and miles of walking, my feet hurt really bad.
So I Googled a massage place that said they did something similar for feet. Perfect, I thought.

Walk in, nice lady who doesn't speak good English takes me downstairs, and asks me to take my clothes off.
I thought it had just been a bit of miscommunication. So I pointed at my feet and took my shoes and socks off. The lady looked really puzzled. But she motioned for me to hop on the table.
Putting a nice pillow behind my head, I thought 'perfect I can chill out now.'
Next thing I know, she starts sucking on my big toe! In total shock, I kick my leg in the air and accidentally hit her in the face!
Apologising, I paid the cash and a little bit more and ran out the door 'sorry sorry sorry, no, but thank you, I'm not here for that, terribly sorry, goodbye' still putting my shoes and socks on outside on the busy street.
Needless to say, my feet still hurt, more so when I realised she actually bit my foot.
Confession over!"

PerilousPlatypus,fdgea71,t3_el9jkk,1578392699.0,Really great story this. Incredible use of a waterborn alien species. Really looking forward to when the humans are off the ship and interacting with the different races here with their â€˜super powersâ€™ haha.

educationalgifs,fd12ifj,t3_eji1vp,1578126889.0,"As someone who is a bit thick, what's actually happening? Is it absorbing and bonding with O2 which makes it heavier? I'm guessing the oxygen becomes some sort of oxide in the wool?"

YouShouldKnow,fbxgfrf,t3_eexaso,1577186156.0,I went online to verify this as it sounded mind blowingly wrong. But then was shocked to read on a number of government run food websites that this is the case! That's crazy! Though I am not giving up cheese.
