I take medication for depression and anxiety and it makes a world of difference for me. Please talk to a doctor, being so anxious that you can't function isn't normal and there are medications out there that can help you."

selfimprovement,fcji4ee,t3_ehcqbp,1577688468.0,"It took me 3 years of therapy and a lot of introspection to realize that the really bossy and controlling part of my personality is all about keeping myself safe. A part of me thinks that if I can control everything and everyone in my environment I can always keep myself safe. This of course isn't really true but just discovering that belief about myself has helped me to chill out. I still struggle sometimes, especially with my kids, but once I realize what I'm doing and why I'm doing it I can usually calm myself down and just go with the flow. It does take work though but you can do it!"
