Whatcouldgowrong,ffe8qgf,t1_ffdzemu,1579839781.0,"Probably got told to get back up and get back to work. Shooting galleries are among the most popular of carnival games and carnies get paid commission generally, not an hourly wage. They do not get sick time and the motto is the same for any entertainment industry in that ""the show must go on"". 

I used to work carnival games in my youth. Customers don't see you as human, bosses barely see you as human, so you get a lot of fucked up injuries from entitled idiotic drunks. You could have 15 signs saying not to shoot until the operator is not in front of you and most people will still pull the trigger, not care, and argue they should have won the largest prize for their idiocy."

talesfromcallcenters,fdmfkgl,t1_fdlxgz4,1578548237.0,"Key word is ""password"". Most companies verify customers through the IVR with PINs, not passwords. A PIN by technical definition only contains numerical values while a password contains alpha/numeric/character values. The exception to the PIN rule is if the PIN is randomly generated by the company and not chosen by the customer. (Footnote 57 of FCC 07-22). If you read the whole document rather than just the fun parts you will come across the phrase ""readily available biographical information"" multiple times throughout the document. This phrase is included because even the FCC recognizes that any verification technique through such information in inadequate for protecting certain parts of the customer's CPNI including call detail information. 

FCC 07-22 is considered the minimum level of protection that a company can offer. Companies are allowed to add protections for customers, such as policies that prevent customers from using readily available biographical information, repeating numbers, or sequential numbers for PINs. Companies are also allowed to require customers to access web portals using a password for information that requires a password for authentication. Just as a company would not want an agent to be able to copy a customer's payment information, they also should not want the agent to have a customer's account password. Also, if your company is international, then you also have to look at SCA and GDPR, both of which offer more stringent guidelines than CPNI or PII under the GSA do.

For some companies, the bare minimum of the law is enough but I stopped working for companies like that long ago. I prefer working for companies that take all security policies into account and not just the rules for CPNI."
