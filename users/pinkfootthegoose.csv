Since from your posts it appears you may be disabled I suggest that you gather what medical records that you can and seek help through school or whatever in obtaining social security disability. It's a long slog but if you are disables you need to get this done ASAP because there is a age cut off for children that were/are disabled before they are adults. Also you should seek to get emancipated before you turn 18 since you live in what appears to be a hostile environment.
