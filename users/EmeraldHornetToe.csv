Elementor's a page builder not a theme, and while there are themes that ""play better"" with Elementor (e.g. OceanWP) most of them will allow you to use it as an optional extra.

So theoretically you can import the site into Wordpress, then all you need to do is install Elementor, let it run in the background and start working on the specific pages you want to use it on.

The biggest issue you're going to have is importing the HTML into WordPress, Elementor aside.

Obviously I don't mean go back to first principles, and don't dumb it down, but seek first to *communicate* and only then to elaborate.

Emulate [any of these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Writing_Award). My own personal favourite people who write about science are Richard Dawkins (his science books rather than his polemics), Dava Sobel, Simon Singh, Jared Diamond, and Simon Winchester. Bill Bryson too, his inaccuracies aside.

As for this author, depending on the audience, I sometimes have to completely rewrite pieces. 

Generally I do a first-pass translation, then unthread each part of the parenthetical information and present it all to myself as a bullet list of nuggets of information. 

I then double-check my translation and reconstruct the nuggets into sentences, each of which provides a single, clear, major point of information. I then follow the info up with supporting detail extracted from the parentheses if required. But often I *strongly* suggest the elimination of frankly irrelevant information that was included in sub-sub-sub parenthetical comments.

The worst one he ever gave me was one paragraph comprising a single sentence that went on for two pages. It ended up as about 20 sentences in 10 paragraphs. 

The Sagan/Feynman idea that academia should seek to be able to explain complex ideas to the uninitiated to further the public understanding of science has not arrived in Italy. In fact the opposite seems to be true for the people I work with: many academics appear to use the most orotund and postmodern bullshit bingo language possible in order to obscure their work and protect their ivory-tower status. Foucault has a lot to answer for.

I am a professional affiliate marketer, SEO, and a professor of digital marketing, but I don't expect you to believe any of that that either. However you can check my post history if you want to see what my major preoccupations are.

That Medium article does the rounds every time AMP comes up and the majority of its complaints are either out of date, gross exaggerations, or simply untrue.

>One of the problems with the Accelerated Mobile Pages concept is that content built utilizing AMP is served up through a cache on Google’s server rather than actually linking to the original page on a publisher’s website. This means that the reader is spending more time on Google’s site and will be seeing Google advertising as opposed to any paid advertising on the content provider’s site. More money for Google, less money for the actual content creator.

In case you were unfamiliar with the mechanism, the AMP page in fact exists on your website and gets scraped by Google then stored in its cache, which gets delivered to the mobile browser cache simultaneously with the search results. When someone clicks an AMP search result the cached version loads into the mobile browser immediately, rather than having to send a request to the webserver. The intention is to provide a) less code per page (responsive sites can produce thousands of lines of code) and b) faster delivery over potentially low bandwidth (e.g. 2G or 3G), c) faster rendering on browsers with limited processing power, and d) greater readability on small screens.

The location of the cached content is irrelevant since Google Analytics (and other analytics tokens) still function on the cached content. Similarly  the code that runs ad networks still function on an AMP page. AMP compatible code exists. It's more like a CDN in that way. Google isn't making any money in this way.

>Although AMP works with Google Analytics, you have to use a different tag, which can be quite time-consuming. If you don’t include the new tag, you miss out on a ton of analytics information.

This is a ridiculous complaint. First, most people using AMP are doing so with a plugin that facilitates AMP page delivery. Secondly ""time consuming"" in a self-coded site simply means reformatting the AMP page base code once. Takes about 10 seconds to do.

>Because AMP is a stripped-down version of your original content, you are at Google’s mercy when it comes to how (and even if) your content is actually displayed. You give up the overall styling of your page in return for a really quick download.

This is almost fair in terms of allowable HTML but absolute nonsense around ""and even if"" - that issue relates to SEO in general (and complaints about Google thereby) and has nothing to do with AMP. Stripped down code and simple design is literally the raison d'être of AMP, and the way AMP pages look is replicated by Responsive site designers - the limitations are the same.

>If your site features a lot of video, AMP would not be that beneficial for you as the download time would pretty much remain the same.

Completely irrelevant.

>Basically, Google is “forking” the web into a version of the internet that looks exactly like Google wants. The amount of tags is very limited, so most AMP pages have a very plain look — an custom web development becomes sort of an unrealistic and unnecessary field.

Partially fair, see my point above about responsive design. It was created to counter [crappy formats](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks) like Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles.

But the ""fork"" is also being used by [Bing](https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2018/Introducing-Bing-AMP-viewer-and-Bing-AMP-cache) too. In fact AMP is being treated like any open source standard.  I suggest that a lot of people are really sore about it because it didn't involve the W3C in its creation - but the same ire does not seem to be being leveled at Microsoft for similar behavior going back 25 years.

>With more and more emphasis being placed on the damaging effects of fake news, AMP makes it even harder for readers to spot these types of stories. Because AMP strips content down to the bare bones and hosts it all within Google’s server, everything starts to look alike. This means that you can have fake articles and phishing clickbait stories appear right beside legitimate news.

Completely and utterly false. The article is *not* delivered up as if from Google: the visible URL is that of your site, you only see the Google URL if you look for it in the address bar. E.g. ""[https://mywebsite.com/myarticle/](https://mywebsite.com/myarticle/)""  is what appears at the top of the browser; if you then reveal the address bar it looks like: ""[google.com/amp/s/mywebsite.com/myarticle/](https://google.com/amp/s/mywebsite.com/myarticle/)"". There is never any ambiguity that the article is coming from Google.

Furthermore you can brand your AMP article however you like;  the logos, graphics, fonts, etc. are all yours to use how you like. An AMP article and a well-designed responsive one do not appear significantly differently in a mobile browser.

>the costs of implementing AMP may just be too high. If you have a well-designed responsive website with optimized images and video, you really don’t need to worry about AMP.

Note the weasel word ""may"". For me it took five minutes and a free AMP plugin for each site I run. A well-designed responsive site will look very similar to the so-called ""limited design"" AMP page, but will take thousands or tens of thousands more lines of CSS, HTML and JS to achieve it.

In short, the article is authoritatively written but with very little of substance to back it up; it also postulates several falsehoods, and is from 2015 when the technology was in its infancy - the author is not obliged to change his opinions but he should at least correct out-of-date information lest people rely on such articles to form their opinions, despite a foundation of factual inaccuracies."

Dude. To decline a regular verb in English you only need to know three endings: infinitive, third-person singular, past participle. 

After that, everything else is constructed in a regular way by adding auxiliary words - and once you know the construction rules it doesn't ever change, no matter what the verb.

To do the same thing in Italian you need to learn 16 suffixes per regular verb. But there are different types of verbs. So that's 48 suffixes!

But where it comes to Italian irregular verbs, with the exception of ""to be"", those in English differ *only* around the past participle and third-person singular. Whereas to learn each Italian irregular verb requires learning the entire gamut of 16 suffixes - for each verb!

No way is Italian easier."

AskReddit,fcrwllt,t1_fcru7wm,1577907619.0,"> Cooked dishes were heavily flavoured with valuable spices such as caraway, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger and pepper. Other commonly used ingredients included cane sugar, almonds, and dried fruits such as dates, figs or raisins. The wealthy treasured these goods which were imported from far away lands, and were hugely expensive. Indeed, there was an ancient department at the Royal court called the 'spicery', which was entirely devoted to spices. Spicy sauces were extremely popular, and entire professional careers were dedicated to saucemaking.

The reason I mentioned WWII is that many Americans when posted in the UK as GIs experienced a Britain whose food culture was absolutely denuded by [rationing and food substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom): root vegetables and processed foods were nearly all that were available without recourse to the black market. Supply lines were cut for all but absolute necessities and ""Dig for Victory"" produced root vegetables and very little else. My dad still talks in emotional terms about the first time he tasted a banana, years after the war ended.

Alas these antediluvian opinions are still trotted out by uninformed idiots like /u/OkayestHistorian (who has deleted his post in shame). Same as tourists still coming to Europe who think they can just throw US$ at the natives in countries with sophisticated economies that have been using the euro for nearly two decades.

Where are you from? What's your favourite food? Pizza? Tacos? Spaghetti? Ramen? Tamales? Sushi?"

Mate, vindaloo and phaal are on the menu of every curry house in the UK, and curry houses are the most popular restaurants in the UK. Since the 90s our national dish has been curry, no longer fish and chips. Every other pub has a Thai restaurant serving gaeng keow waan. Chinese restaurants serve szechuan hotpot in every high street in every town in the UK.

British people are spice *addicts*."
