FuckYouKaren,ffarcnw,t3_esk1zt,1579742694.0,If it was up to Karen everything would be banned. We'd end up living in a soulless almost gray world. No culture anywhere.
mildlyinteresting,ffaau84,t3_esisw1,1579731274.0,No Mr. Peanut can't be gone. He is advertising royalty. We need him.
Cooking,ffaal06,t3_esic8s,1579731125.0,A good idea is to stock up on canned veggies. There is a very wide variety of good canned vegetables. Just check for low sodium or no added salt. I mostly use the frozen. I like to use some pickled vegetables in soups in a small amounts for flavor. The peppers add a nice little bit of heat. I sometimes use a little of the liquid too.
mildlyinteresting,ffa9v9w,t3_eshhys,1579730716.0,I used to love mixing mayo and ketchup and putting on burgers and dipping things like fries and chicken nuggets in it. Unfortunately due to having food poisoning I've developed food sensitivities and mayo is now on my can't eat list. That Kranch stuff sounds gross. I love ranch. Ketchup is good. Mixed together nah.
nextfuckinglevel,ffa8w43,t3_esfti1,1579730163.0,This is great. I loved his jokes.
mildlyinteresting,ff9tm4m,t3_esb217,1579720993.0,I remember seeing those in a bunch of places before they got replaced with the new ones. I like the old style vending machines. I remember this icecream treat vending machine. You open the little door to get your bar or sandwich treat.

AskCulinary,ff9sv9o,t1_ff94dde,1579720517.0,I agree roasting would probably work. It brings out the natural sugars and also gives it a bit of a nice nutty flavor. I'd spray it witj olive oil cooking spray.
mildlyinteresting,ff9sbhv,t1_ff9exuy,1579720142.0,"That is what I do. I take my dirtiest pot, boil some water in it and then put a little Dawn dish soap. Pour over the ants and it also makes cleaning the pot easier. I just wash it like normal. The stuff is easier to clean up."
nextfuckinglevel,ff9ry6x,t3_esfjrb,1579719869.0,This is amazing. Gwendoline is so graceful. Her character was one of my favorites.

FuckYouKaren,ff97etl,t3_esbi5f,1579706586.0,I'm sorry you had to deal with such a well I'm too much of a lady to use the words I'm thinking. I'd honestly start a new charity and call it Lily's Dream after your wonderful friend. She sounds like an amazing person.
FuckYouKaren,ff94jdr,t3_es8t5r,1579704666.0,This is making me rethink my decision to cut my hair really short. I don't want to look like a Karen. I'm not getting highlights or anything. Had to vent about it. Karens are evil.
Makeup,ff7y24o,t3_erwa8t,1579661081.0,If you don't already have it get the app and rewards card. They are always posting sales on the app plus you can build up points toward money off. You can also find out when they are having their big big specials and free gift with purchase specials. I've gotten so many awesome things.
vaxxhappened,ff7xo82,t1_ff7i1j6,1579660813.0,Their souls are reincarnated into the bodies of kids whose parents actually care about them and get them vaccinated. That way they live the happy and healthy lives they were supposed to with smart parents. I mean it wasn't their fault they died because they weren't vaccinated.
vaxxhappened,ff7wyeq,t3_es33c3,1579660326.0,My mom only pays $25 at Walmart pharmacy for her insulin. Many insurance plans especially Medicare offer it for free. Many places here in the US offer free vaccines. Big Pharma knows they get more money treating patients with the diseases these vaccines prevent.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff7wc62,t3_es2od5,1579659910.0,What this woman does is great. Thanks to her there are many healthy happy babies out there as well as grateful parents. This problem benefits many adoptive parents of babies with special medical needs. I mean think about it.
aww,ff7jebf,t3_erwkyc,1579650948.0,Congratulations on the new miracles. I bet mama is tired. Better kitten proof the house quick if you haven't already. The cuties will be getting into everything before you know it.

FuckYouKaren,ff7iu5q,t3_ery6ci,1579650564.0,Bigfoot exists. For a girl my feet are considered huge. Unicorns exist. They are called narwhals. Fairies exist. They are called pretty butterflies.
Cooking,ff4rlwj,t1_ff4r760,1579570766.0,"Yes to both. That is why it is a once every other month treat. I have been trying to find ways to reduce the fat and stuff while keeping flavor. I have been able to reduce a good amount. Ground turkey, fat free refried beans, low fat sour cream, Baked Doritos and low fat cheese have helped. Not a big taste change."
Cooking,ff4qwjc,t1_ff4qoue,1579570283.0,I should have been more specific. You crush the Doritos a little before putting them in your bowl then layer everything you want with chips between layers. Kind of hard to eat with your fingers if you want to get everything in each bite.
Cooking,ff4qi6m,t1_ff4p4xe,1579570011.0,Yeah they were kind of like Nachos but the cheese wasn't melted except when it hit the meat. You also ate them with a fork. Yes a fork. You put everything thing in a bowl. My mouth is now watering thinking about it and now I'm craving them. Time to go to the store and get the stuff for it.
Cooking,ff4knh4,t3_erljl2,1579565919.0,Campfire Tacos. Basically it is taco meat and fixings on Doritos. Sometimes we'd use ground beef or ground turkey. My job as a kid was to put the black olives in a dish and when I got older shred the cheese. My parents and I still make it once in a while. I add low fat refried beans to mine. I don't know why we call them Campfire Tacos. We never made them over a fire.
Makeup,feuweq0,t3_eqlypr,1579390600.0,Wet n Wild Photo Focus foundation. Buildable and feels nice.
Makeup,fekoq68,t1_feiwf2y,1579204457.0,"I have what I call the trifecta of skin. Sensitive, dry patches and oily acne prone areas especially my chin. It works nicely. It is my go to during the summer"
facepalm,feiws37,t3_epd7ry,1579149347.0,"This makes no sense. I see rainbows in a lot of Christian books, toys and other things. When I was a kid there were rainbows when we learned about Noah and other events. Plus the fact that if you put all of the colors together Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet, make up light. Just look at light through a prism. Oh wait they don't believe in science. I capitalized the words because in school we learned to remember this with R.O.Y. G. B.I.V."
Makeup,feivfj1,t3_ep7kol,1579148279.0,"I love Garnier Micellar Water with the blue cap and label for my eye makeup removal. I put it on a cotton pad to remove my waterproof mascara. It works so well. I put it on my eye, count to 5 and wipe gently. It works great and is gentle. I do use Neutrogena Micellar water when I run out of the Garnier Micellar water. That works as well."
Makeup,feio7u3,t3_epbprl,1579143136.0,I like CoverGirl CG Smoothers BB cream. It is lightweight and feels nice.
Cooking,fegqn6k,t3_ep2y4e,1579100249.0,Frozen veggies and fruits are great. There is this frozen cauliflower crust pizza that is actually pretty good. It is called Cauliflowerpower or something like that. If you like crispy crust pizza. Key is cooking it for 3 extra minutes.
aww,feglmew,t3_eovu48,1579096555.0,I beg to differ. That cat is still super cute.
FoodIssues,feaijbg,t1_fea982q,1578949209.0,No problem. I used to love tuna fish sandwiches with mayo and seasonings but I've had to add mayo to my list of foods I can't eat. Had food poisoning last year and I have developed some food sensitivities that affect my digestive system.
Makeup,fe4fs6j,t3_enjvnc,1578858791.0,When I want to go for an easy lightweight but put together look I use a BB cream for my face and concealer when I have breakouts. For my eyes I use tinted eye primer. I use Ulta's tinted eye primer. The price is nice and it comes in nice shades. I use a stick highlighter for a touch of color. I use waterproof mascara for my lashes since my eyes are watery. Lips just need a tinted lip balm.
Makeup,fe4dhuy,t3_enrn8a,1578858108.0,"Wet n Wild Photo Focus primer, setting and refreshing spray, Wet n Wild Photo Focus foundation, concealer, eye primer then eyeshadow unless I'm in a hurry then tinted eye primer, waterproof mascara, stick highlighter and a touch of blush followed by setting spray. I also use a color changing lipstick or other lip color depending on the day. If it is warm out or I know I'll be sweating I'll skip foundation and use CoverGirl CG Smoothers BB cream especially if I'll be outside most of the time. It has SPF in it."

FuckYouKaren,fdm48ly,t1_fdm3rp3,1578539415.0,I just found out Rob Schneider was anti-vaxx as well. I was a big fan of his. Not anymore.
FuckYouKaren,fdlz2c9,t3_elzyej,1578535914.0,I was a fan of Jenny McCarthy way back in the 90s. The moment I found out she was one of the biggest anti-vaxxers out there that changed. Now I can't stand her. She is one of the people who paid for that report that got debunked.
Cooking,fdlynxu,t1_fdln4av,1578535641.0,That is what we have. I made basic country style pork ribs today with the pressure cooker setting. They came out ok. My parents enjoyed them. I have yet to use the air fryer portion yet. Might try quinoa. I definitely want to try making yogurt.
wholesomegifs,fdljhip,t1_fdlip9o,1578525388.0,Hey you are dealing with a rough thing which is a major major major understatement. You have every right in the world to vent. Say what you are feeling. Get it off your chest. It is healing.
vaxxhappened,fdlhw0a,t1_fdksm57,1578524369.0,"Anti-vaxxers don't understand the concepts of empathy, true sympathy, class, common sense and the fact the world doesn't revolve around them. They only listen to themselves. Hopefully someday your cousin will see things differently."
vaxxhappened,fdlgzpl,t3_em04v1,1578523817.0,"Great. This is why anti-vaxxers need to be rounded up, put on their own special island where they can live how they want and their kids secretly vaccinated. Polio was eradicated in our country. Now we have to bring back iron lungs, polio body and leg braces and other things."
wholesomegifs,fdlfzw4,t1_fdle28h,1578523209.0,Yes I do. I'm happy if they get any rain anywhere there. I know it doesn't do much especially if it is a small amount but any relief no matter how small probably feels good. My cousin in California deals with wildfires. Anytime during them even if it rains a little feels good.
aww,fdl0i8q,t3_elxdlb,1578514891.0,"Not affectionate. My cat was a total snuggle baby kitty. Loved being held, cuddled, given kisses on the top of her head, pet, sitting on laps etc. She would head bump, rub up against her people wtc"
vaxxhappened,fdl009v,t1_fdkdil2,1578514625.0,I take it. It help me. I use Melatonin to help sleep since sleeping pills knock me out for 2 days. Helps just enough.

Yes I'm a good puppy who likes to play, eat sleep and snuggle. I'm soft and will grow up to love and protect my family and friends who I consider my family anyway. Ok I'm going to snuggle with my mommy now and maybe take a nap. Also I need to go potty."" 
Most of that is from just the look in the puppy's eyes. Dogs are very blunt when they have to go to the fire hydrant."

Makeup,fdhoql5,t3_elcoj8,1578427125.0,I do on the very edges around the tip of my nose. I use one of those Finishing Touch Flawless Brow things. If I don't and I wear makeup you can see the hairs. The only other place I shave is between my brows. I like how the FTFB makes it easier to get stuff rather than a brow razor.

antiMLM,fdfpihp,t3_el2xjd,1578367108.0,The only thing they are good for is when you are cleaning or doing some kind of super messy chores something you don't want your regular clothes ruined. Of course only if you can get them at a supet low price like under $5.
Makeup,fdd050a,t1_fdczx9h,1578289630.0,"It also depends on what kinds of services the store near you has. The ones near me have lots of different hair, face and even makeup services."
Makeup,fdcyvl6,t3_ekp3wu,1578288440.0,I live in the suburbs and the employees at the Ulta stores near me are great. You can tell they take pride in what they do. They keep up to date with the latest trends and techniques. I've learned some nice tricks and tips. I guess it just depends on where you live and what is on trend in your area.

I've been watching the family's new show and love it. You can totally see how much they truly love animals and the planet as a whole. Robert is almost a clone of his dad.

FoodIssues,fdcnkew,t3_ekllbj,1578279352.0,I don't mind many cold meats if they are made properly. I am not a fan of ham. My parents used to buy this overly salty and processed ham that was rectangular in shape. Put me off cold ham for good. Certain meat products like salami are perfect room temperature but I mostly like my sandwich meats warm. I love a good tuna melt.
mildlyinteresting,fdbvgex,t3_ekepp5,1578262602.0,I saw one of those at a fair way back in the day. I was 4 or 5. My mom told me I asked for a Happy Meal and they didn't have them I was pissed for the rest of the day. Only the cat snuggling up to me made me smile a little.

She doesn't use it whenever possible. Mostly only if she is having a bad day with her health. To her there are people who need these spaces more. She just looks for the closest spot she can find.
FuckYouKaren,fd9avus,t3_ekahq6,1578230884.0,I recently saw someone parked in those lines right next to a disabled parking spot. They had no disability parking tag on their car or a symbol on their license plate.

The people who work there aren't snooty and will actually help you no matter your budget, whether you are a beginner or not and are willing to answer any questions no matter how stupid you may think they are. They offer lots of services including a makeup tutorial that is hands on. When I got back into makeup that is where I went. I also love their free gift with purchase specials. I spent $15 US and got $50 US in free stuff."
mildlyinteresting,fd5h4rc,t1_fd4ws3x,1578177590.0,Yeah but most of them are overly processed cheeses. Especially if they aren't refrigerated.
mildlyinteresting,fd5guf7,t1_fd4w9ri,1578177487.0,I know. The US does have an obesity problem. It stems from many factors. Nutritional education or lack there of. Easy access to low cost fresh vegetables and lean proteins. Too much processed foods. Lack of exercise.
mildlyinteresting,fd4dkse,t1_fd3shdw,1578166625.0,Ok I'll admit I'm a thick girl myself. Still there is such a thing as moderation. Some cheeses are meant to be savored in small bites or thin slices. I'm talking the super intensely flavored cheeses. Happy Cake Day BTW.
facepalm,fd4cgoq,t1_fd0zxcq,1578166373.0,OMG. Hopefully these twins won't be like the ones I knew. They were downright obnoxious about it every time their birthdays came up.
