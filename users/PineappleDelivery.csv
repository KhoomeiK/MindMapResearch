When uploading this data to the GPU to draw, you can send each triangle and it's 3 vertices, and that works fine. But there are going to be a bunch of redundant and duplicate vertices, because each vertex is generally shared by at least two or more triangles.

So to optimize GPU memory usage, you don't send each triangle and its vertices. You unify all the shared/duplicate vertices, and then send only one copy. But then how does the GPU know which triangle uses which shared vertex?

You then have to send an index array. An index array tells the GPU where in this vertex ""buffer"" a triangle's vertices are. 

Indexes are way smaller than vertices, so you end up saving at around 50% on memory space. Each vertex requires at least 24 bytes of data (3 * 32-bit floats), whereas an index pointing to that vertex only requires 4 bytes (32-bit integer). 

The problem is if your index buffer/index list loses a value or gains a value (or the GPU loses track of where it's reading from in the buffer), the indexes don't match to the triangles they are meant to represent, and you get a big jumble of garbage."
