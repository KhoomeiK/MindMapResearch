This meme is joking about farming XP by completing daily / weekly bounties.  Ideally you want to maximize results in minimal time, so to facilitate that you head to an area in game that most easily allows you to knock out multiple bounties at once or in quick succession.

There are many similar spots, but Artifact’s Edge / The Orrery on Nessus is old reliable.  Jammed into this small map area you have a fast travel location, frequent public events, a Forge Saboteur, a HVT, loads of chests + planetary materials, and simple patrols.

Inside the lost sector are waves of slow moving Vex w/easy crit spots. Rinse & Repeat.

— So by just going to this one location for 10-15min  you can generally knock out a slew of Gunsmith, Vanguard, Drifter, Saint-14, Black Armory, Failsafe, and Obelisk bounties.  That results in a lot of XP, as well as completion rewards.  Not to mention it’ll chip away at weapon Catalysts."
