fatlogic,ffbysdu,t1_ffbt5xe,1579787037.0,"Not my case. I freaking snapped like a twig under pressure. Weight became an easy thing to control and a measurable goal. I had some eating disordered behaviors before. It went from just losing a 5 lb weight gain I recently had to full blown ED practically over night. People all complimented the weight loss, even as I was losing while being UW"
fatlogic,ffbyet5,t1_ffbsgy1,1579786725.0,">The comments that were along the lines of you look so good now made me think of how terrible I must've looked before

This. Exactly this. For me, I went from a healthy weight to underweight. The compliments poured in, which confirmed 

1. I looked awful before

2. People like me better smaller

3. People notice my body and its changes

I'm super hung up on it now since I should be gaining weight. Everyone is going to notice me get fatter"
fatlogic,ffbxr1g,t1_ffbnw5e,1579786165.0,"You actually have a pretty good point, but you'd br surprised how many people compliment going from a BMI of 21-22 to 17-18."
EDAnonymous,ff9bapy,t1_ff9ajr7,1579709050.0,"Oh man, I'm glad you know what's going on, but that sounds hard to handle. Sometimes it feels like if I gain the weight back it was all for nothing? Like even though I could improve/alleviate some issues with weight gain I wouldn't have had the issue to begin if I never got to a low weight. ðŸ™ƒ"
EDAnonymous,ff99xg7,t1_ff999jj,1579708195.0,"Oh I don't miss my period. I worry about what it might mean long term though. 

But man that would make me even more terrified to eat normally"
EDAnonymous,ff99pgw,t3_esc425,1579708055.0,"It also drives me nuts that people seem to forget women weight more when they're taller? Like people were always FLOORED when I said my weight when I was in the middle of the healthy range. 

I also hate that I'd have to be 15 BMI to be a double digit weight."
EDAnonymous,ff98m9z,t1_ff9613o,1579707368.0,It's real glamorous ðŸ˜Ž
EDAnonymous,ff98k3w,t1_ff94ke8,1579707327.0,Holy hell. That sounds miserable. I hope it ends soon :(
EDAnonymous,ff98e1e,t1_ff97nmu,1579707218.0,"I wish not having your period didn't mean other things were awry. I don't miss it, but I also don't like thinking about my bones losing calcium :("
EDAnonymous,ff93n41,t1_ff93hl8,1579704044.0,Gawd I've gotten to the point where I can't even imagine being naked im front of another human.
safe_food,ff7y1ld,t3_es5l1b,1579661071.0,I've found lesser evil brand popcorn (usually at least at whole foods) to taste similar and is likely more widespread. Wegmans brand is cheaper though
fuckeatingdisorders,ff60pe8,t1_ff5kicj,1579616127.0,I do/ did #1 with most things. Like combining foods so I can't taste them separately is a sin and should be avoided
EDAnonymous,ff46yud,t3_eriyy3,1579556897.0,"Everyone is different. That said, it would majorly help to make sure you're getting proper nutrition. 
I can't promise you'll grow, but it's the only way it can possibly happen. At 14 you still have plenty of time left to grow- I know women who grew a few inches in college! 

I know it's probably scary, but maybe you can use this as motivation to recover. A dieticians and doctor could help identify nutrients you could improve upon in your diet. 

Even if you dont end up growing taller, your brain is developing and will also need some vital nutrients."

AnorexiaNervosa,fel2jtf,t3_epq2uk,1579212673.0,"Im on 30 mg prozac.... It helps lessen my anxiety and lighten my depression. Idk how or if its affected my ED and b/p behavior. 

I have nothing to compare it to though, it's the only antidepressant I've tried."
fuckeatingdisorders,fegqiio,t1_feg33is,1579100160.0,"Thanks! 

My motivation is more of to NOT be like this for the rest of my life. Honestly I don't care too much about my current self, but I look around and know it can be better. If I'm going to be alive, I should learn how to not be miserable for the rest of my life. 

Try to find something that works for you. Everyone on the other side seems to think it's worth the effort? Hopefully one day we'll agree"
EDAnonymous,fef6djv,t1_fee27kv,1579049249.0,You're right. My brain just goes on fire seeing a big goal that seems so unattainable from where I currently am. But it's a goal and there's in between steps to take
EDAnonymous,fedtr7b,t1_fed4nw0,1579019712.0,It's just hard because eating more makes me likely to give up and bp or just purge. I really just need to accept eating more won't ruin my life first lol
EDAnonymous,fedtmng,t1_fedd9no,1579019635.0,"I'm glad things are getting better for you! Holidays are so rough.

 I guess it's also really scary to state goals that you think you may want because you might be held accountable for them ðŸ˜£"
fuckeatingdisorders,fec0cxz,t3_eo75sh,1578964824.0,"I think almost anyone with an ED has felt this way, myself included. It's the ED's way of surviving. I'm starting recovery and I still feel guilty about taking space that someone who really is struggling could use. However, I've frequented a support group and started a therapy group and it has helped me see that my struggles are similar to those of others seeking treatment.  

Long story short though- as with a lot of things, it's not about how much others are struggling, it's about you wanting better for yourself. These resources are out there to help people at varying stages of need. Just try and be honest with what you're going through and you can get the help you need. 

Also! Getting help early can make your life and recovery process so much better!!"
EDAnonymous,febscrp,t1_febnx9g,1578962150.0,"Thanks! Those are some major goals. I guess reframing the way I see food would be important.

 I guess possible goals here are scary af because they're really hard to imagine myself doing, thus pointless. I also see this part of recovering as the biggest threat to my ED, so it's just hard to accept wanting these things all the time."
progresspics,fe9d54a,t3_eo3rb0,1578936485.0,"Girl, you look amazing and so strong! Fuck the scale and keep celebrating what your body can do!"
fatlogic,fe5t6jd,t1_fe5przf,1578874394.0,"I agree- it should be losing weight can be body positive. 

Yes, a large portion of our population could lose weight, but that doesn't make losing weight intrinsically healthy or positive."
AnorexiaNervosa,fdddth3,t3_ekr9hh,1578307581.0,"I would say it can be normal. Your body will want to up its glycogen stores and hold on to water to help repair itself. If you're not eating a lot, then your digestive system probably doesn't know how to handle more food right now. You could try probiotics, but also trying to normalize your eating a little bit could help level things out"
AnorexiaNervosa,fd6fvcx,t3_ek1yt5,1578190362.0,Gawd. I used to think some people were so skinny and some of them even look kind of fat now? It really makes me question what I actually look like.
EDAnonymous,fcxoem2,t1_fcx2qlh,1578067726.0,"You're not the bad guy! The eating disorder is. I just think it's important to be aware of how you are responding to them, though. Ask them what you can do to help and what they need. 

I'd also like to emphasize we all have different relationships with our parents. My parents were not ever emotionally available, so we never formed a relationship where I felt comfortable going to them for emotional issues. 

In the end, I love my mom, I don't like being angry with her,  and felt she deserved some answers to help put her at peace. I wrote her a letter explaining what I need/ don't need from her and what I've been doing to help myself. 

I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope you can find a way to help your child. Anorexia is a bitch, but with the right resources things can get better."
EDAnonymous,fcqotf1,t3_eifen9,1577889742.0,"I have another week of food torture, but I think the worst is over"
fatlogic,fcm08m8,t1_fcl7nax,1577760853.0,"Thank you, I saw a thread it r/nutrition about new science information for a healthy lifestyle and most of it was about ways to lose weight. I lost TOO much weight (started at a 'healthy' weight and then spiraled into an ED, getting help now). I want to be healthy, but it's hard when everyone seems to think being healthy is all about weight loss. I can't do intermittent fasting or keto while trying to recover, but I want to fuel my body with good foods. 

Yes, some people need to lose weight to be in optimal health, but some people are at a healthy maintenance weight or need to gain. They still can work to keep a healthy diet."
EDAnonymous,fbxy057,t3_ef079e,1577203406.0,Also all the encouragement for the UW nearly UW people on progress pictures
