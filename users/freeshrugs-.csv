pharmacy,fcsus6h,t3_eik59r,1577925636.0,"This was a few months ago when I was working as a grad intern. We were super busy when a customer walked up to pick up. I was on the phone when I acknowledged the customer and let him know I‚Äôd be over in one moment. Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt fast enough. He proceeded to leave a piece of paper on the counter with seven numbers written on it. I tried looking up the patient‚Äôs profile using the numbers provided or searching by Rx number to figure out how to help. He came over while I was in this process. I asked him if he was picking up for someone and he said, ‚ÄúiT DoEsn‚Äôt tAke A tHirD gRadEr‚ÄôS EDucAtion To figUrE tHaT oUt.‚Äù 
BOIIII The pharmacist I was working with that day was having NONE of it. She popped right over and tried to give the guy an opportunity to recover. She said ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs a pretty insulting thing to say to someone.‚Äù He looked me up and down and said, ‚ÄúYea, it is.‚Äù 
The pharmacist then proceeded to let the customer know that if he feels that way he probably doesn‚Äôt want anyone with less than a third grader‚Äôs education filling his prescriptions and canceled all 5 of his prescriptions that were in ready status and told him he‚Äôs going to need to have them transferred somewhere else as he‚Äôs not welcome at our pharmacy. Literally my hero."
