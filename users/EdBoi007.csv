Yes slavery is bad but lets not pretend its the worst thing to ever happened. 

Turkey nearly wiped out an entire culture of people and deny it to this very day. Not to mention Turkey enslaved and massacred Bulgarians for 500 years. 

Gangas Khan and his army massacred millions. Vlad the Impaler and countless others.

To be enslaved then set free and eventually be part of one of the greatest countries in the world (at the time) even if you were treated badly is still a HELL of a lot better than what many MANY groups got throughout history."
