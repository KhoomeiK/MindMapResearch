I urge other readers to learn about the Federalist papers, their context, the status of firearms at the time, the function and definition of a militia, and the reasoning behind the second amendment. 

I also urge these other readers to realize that a thorough understanding of historical context is *only one part* of your responsibility on having a well-reasoned opinion on firearms in the modern era. I do not care what your conclusion is, as long as it is defensible. You must have a thorough understanding of how firearms operate and the context in which they are commonly used in the modern era. You must be able to find and evaluate data sets. You must be able to clearly state and justify your analysis of these data sets.

You must not rely on appeals to emotion. You must not make connections which do not necessarily follow. E.G. Crime as a whole is an *extremely* complicated subject and you would need to look at only *gun* crime if you wanted to have any real ability to see cause and effect in the data. The fellow I was talking to failed to mention that Australia's buyback program saw a *clear* drop in homicides and suicides by firearms that were a part of the program, which is obviously the main purpose of such a program.

unpopularopinion,ffdbpcj,t1_ffd63jr,1579817453.0,">So an Assault Weapon is just a rifle that looks ""scary""? Great thing to know our legislators want to ban things on cosmetic features.

I didn't say that. None of the features I listed are purely cosmetic and if you think they are you don't know much about guns. Many of the features banned don't stop guns from going pew pew, but they do make them less effective military weapons, if only incrementally so.


 >Most ""assault weapons bans"" ban only AR-15s and other rifles that look like it.

The poorly written ones will call out firearms by model, the well written ones will not. Some of the prosed legislation really does get to the heart of the concern with assault weapons, going as far as to require fixed magazines and/or severely limit ammo capacity. I've seen legislation even attempting to ban semi-autos.

>Why the hell should the AR-15 be banned? It's one of the best and most accessible rifles for home defense use. It's not particularly high powered, honestly more damage could be done with common pistols.

Well it's a semi-auto rifle with high potential for use in the most emotionally charged type of crime we have. I'm not going to tell you whether or not I agree, only that to some people banning semi-autos is a logical conclusion based on their priorities.

>This is all assuming gun control politicians care about logic. They don't. Remember, these are the people who think barrel shrouds are ""the shoulder thingies that go up and down"", think that ""Chainsaw Bayonets"" are real and common, and managed to sneakily ban handguns in Chicago for 30 years.

Some do, some don't. Also, you have to remember that laws are passed based on a whole lot of compromise. What can start out as a logical and coherent gun control bill can end up a complete mess after edits that got passed by people with interests in both direction from the original intent of the bill.

>Honestly the biggest gun law thing I can think of is something that no politician has tried to do. Let private sellers use the NCIS database and check records that way. Seriously, no private seller wants their gun to end up in the hands of a criminal. But no, it's much better to them to try and ban private sales entirely (Because abolition and the war on drugs worked out so well amirite), and ban sale to anyone with a ""mental illness"", while being extremely vague about the meaning of that. Is ADHD a mental illness? Autism? Anxiety? Where is the God damn line?

The biggest gun law would be to ban guns. There's that pesky second amendment still floating around, but a strict historical intent and originalist interpretation of the law would lead you to the conclusion that the amendment really *only* protects semi-auto 5.56 rifles, and you could even make the argument that the whole amendment is moot because the militia as an organizational structured as practiced in ~1780 and beyond is effectively dead.


>Sorry for the rant. Gun stuff is like the one political issue that can actually get me passionate. 

You're coming from it with the mindset that guns are good, and if you want to understand why gun control advocates think the way they do, you need to be able to consider what you're perspective would be if you thought they were bad. That's the only way you're going to be able to effectively comminate with someone like that and at least come to respectful disagreement.

If you really want to get an objective look at what we should do with the guns in our country, you need to consider them inheritly neutral and base your policy off usefulness, potential for abuse, and other metrics that can similarly be applied to something like a spear or a bulldozer. You also need to make sure that your justifications on either side of the debate are well-reasoned. I often see both sides of the debate bring out arguments that are poorly reasoned, especially when they're backed into a corner or don't actually know very much about the subject. Think: ""no one has any need for a gun, full stop"" or ""the population needs to be armed to overthrow a tyrannical government."" Both statements tell me the person almost certainly hasn't actually evaluated that statement objectively. I'm passionate too, dude, but that's no excuse to toss your level-head out the window."

unpopularopinion,ffd1itd,t1_ffcpznb,1579811578.0,"Assault weapon is not a meaningless term, it's just politicians often use it broadly especially because definitions vary. Let's start with assault rifle, however.

An assault rifle is a *select fire* rifle in intermediate cartage with a detachable magazine. They also have pistol grips almost always. Select fire means you have the option between one shot per trigger pull, or more than one shot per trigger pull. You *can* buy one in the US, you just need a permit and boatloads of money.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle

An assault *weapon* is defined by US laws; it's usually basically the same thing but semi-auto only. It varies from place to place within the US what fits the local legal definition, but it can include additional things like muzzle devices, bayonet lugs, etc. The definition does not have to be limited to rifles. *In general* however, an assault weapon is essentially an assault rifle in semi-auto only.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon

And I think you'll find that if you want to come up with functional gun control and decide that you don't want people owning [AR-15s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15_style_rifle) because of their capabilities, you're going to be banning [MINI14s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_Mini-14) as well since they're very very similar from a capability and functional standing. I.E. in the eyes of someone who understands firearms and still wants to ban the AR-15, the MINI 14 is coming with. Links for people that don't know these firearms."

Furthermore, defensive gun use doesn't mean the use was justified, just that they took out their gun to take control of a situation that they didn't start. Loads of those cases could have been solved without guns. Finally, we *really* need better data on this. IIRC it was this preliminary study in the 90s that caused Congress to ban the CDC from doing any more work looking into guns at all. The CDC's work cited, as far as I'm aware, was mostly just asking folks if they had ever used a gun defensively, which is basically the least reliable way to get accurate data. I would be extremely skeptical of those numbers (preferring to simply say we don't know) untill we get a better and more recent data set. Definitions are not universal in gun studies, and the ones we have can be really poor data sets."

AskReddit,ffb1xv7,t1_ffax31a,1579749751.0,"One time I was squad leader in an FPS also called Squad. This is a game designed around massive maps, realistic combat sim (mostly), and essential requires a mic for team coordination. The team with the better communication and organization skills usually wins. Loads of fun and the community is usually very nice since the game is geared around working together.

A girl was in our squad one time and the fucking dudes could not stop with the lady jokes. I quickly told them to shut it (you need to keep the chatter down for effective communication in this game, and the jokes got old fast anyway) and one of them wouldn't leave it alone. I gave him an ultimatum that if he didn't shut up I'd boot him from our squad. He immediately says something about vaginas and I kick him out of our group (I didn't have the power to kick him off the team or out of the game). His character dies and is respawed at the base. Fucking half an hour later he comes running in and team kills like half of us. I was impressed he stayed mad that long. I think that got him booted from the game.

Later on in that game I needed someone to basically be a long-range supplies courier and the girl volunteered so I sent her off on an errand. Everyone immediately tried to give me shit for picking the girl who literally volunteered first when no one else volunteered at all. I just pointed out she was the only volunteer and continued giving orders for other tasks.

Literally your source. 

A militia is *organized by the government;* it is not random citizens with guns. The only difference between a militia and the militaries we have now (and some of the ones we raised back then) is that the individuals in the militia were expected to provide their own small arms, where traditional state armies are provided with arms.

You can't point at quotes of people calling the militia everyone and claim it has any basis in reality. It's clearly poetic language, especially because the armies formed back then were decidedly *not* filled with people representative of the nation as a whole, just as it isn't today. The militia was never ever defined as ""fuck it, anyone at any time"" and instead had a clear meaning of government organized fighting group which largely supplied it's own arms.

And boy are you not all all informed about where the National Guard comes from: 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard

>In 1903, with passage of the [Dick Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Act), the predecessor to the modern-day National Guard was formed. It required the states to divide their militias into two sections. The law recommended the title ""National Guard"" for the first section, known as the organized militia, and ""Reserve Militia"" for all others.[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard#cite_note-10)

>During [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), Congress passed the [National Defense Act of 1916](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Act_of_1916), which required the use of the term ""National Guard"" for the state militias and further regulated them. Congress also authorized the states to maintain [Home Guards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Defense_Forces), which were reserve forces outside the National Guards being deployed by the Federal Government.[[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard#cite_note-11)

>In 1933, with passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, Congress finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard and the National Guard of the United States, a newly created federal reserve force. The [National Defense Act of 1947](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Act_of_1947) created the Air Force as a separate branch of the Armed Forces and concurrently created the Air National Guard of the United States as one of its reserve components, mirroring the Army's structure.

And to be clear, my comment was refuting this statement: ""The anti-2A are always on about the well regulated militia. Well there it is, there is your well regulated militia of thousands of Americans armed and dressed for battle."" because random citizens joining together with arms *is not a militia* because the government did not conscript them into service. When anti 2A people point to militias as the underlying justification for the right to own a firearm, they rightfully point out *that we don't use militias anymore* so clearly the justification is moot. (I personally have a different view on firearms ownership than you might think, but it's not relevant here because I want to keep our discussion clear and limited to what is and is not a militia )"

I guess you could say that the whole point of the second amendment was for treason, but it's really aimed more at arming state militaries in rebellion against the federal government, not *the people* against the government. Plus, if the framers were really serious about fending off a tyrannical federal government they would have included provisions in the Constitution that allowed the states to dissolve the republic, similar to what many other countries have in terms of snap elections or votes of no confidence. Instead they just said ""eh, make sure you have guns for defending the nation"" and then in letters *outside the Constitution* said ""hey maybe armed rebellion could be a thing too? 

Anyway the original point was that a functional democracy does not function under threat if violence, which is a perfectly valid claim. Overthrowing the government through violence doesn't restore democracy, it just leaves a power vacuum. What fills the void could be anything, and functional democracy is not guaranteed."

A well-regulated militia was run by a state government and only assembled in mass as necessary, or at least that was the idea. The point was that the *state governments* could retain significant military power in order to oppose the *federal government* should it attempt to assert power it did not have through military means. The civil war and the 14th amendment pretty much said ""tough nuts, federal government rulz.""

Now, the state militias remained after the civil war but were commandeered by the federal government a few decades later. This is what we call the National Guard. In it's wake some states created State Guards, but most of them didn't want to pay for a state army they were never going to use. State Guards today are an absolute joke, and many of them meet once a month looking very similar to that Virginia rally with copious amounts of overweight members. In contrast to the Virginia rally, however, it's not uncommon for State Guards to be completed *unarmed,* making some of the few modern incarnations of we have left not even dependent on the second amendment to justify their existence!

ChoosingBeggars,ff4qnhr,t1_ff4l7sg,1579570112.0,"Lol, maybe if you you want to be saturation diver. With all the union busting codified into law, even skilled manual labor can go for only marginally better wages than unskilled.

As with a 4 year degree, a 2 year degree is a gamble and you still need to take time out of your overworked life to go get an education. It's an opportunity cost investment. With unskilled wages as low as they are, many people *especially people with others dependant on them or those with zero generational wealth to fall back on* simply cannot pass up on working hours to go to school. Low wages force them to maximize time working in order to afford life in general, and there's no wiggle room for anything else.

Look, I went to college and got a 4 year degree in STEM and got a good paying after graduating thanks to a professor of mine and work experience I got based off the recommendation of my father. I got extremely lucky, because most people who go into the workforce with my degree these days start at $30K and work a job you only need a GED for, despite what the hiring manager says. 

I took out loans to pay for college and I worked 20 hours a week at a job that allowed me to do homework in the downtime for something like 25¢ above minimum wage. I also spent my summers doing paid internships where my hourly pay was a little higher and I scored some insane deals on summer housing by living in frat houses when all the bros were gone. My living situation at college was pretty cheap for the area as well, which was a big money saver.

With all that, I pretty much broke even across the four years. I had no dependants, I had no major emergencies, I had no car (which can certainly be necessary for many people, especially when you suggest community college, where campuses are often built around driving to campus and local housing is not an option), I had cheap tastes and cheap hobbies. 

I made it work, but only because I was in the perfect position to do so. If you add in any financial stressor or time-commitment it would have gotten a whole lot worse and much more difficult to ""work"" my way through school. (I put quotes because working didn't pay for school, just licking expenses). Many of my friends were subsidized by their parents; I was not, but I had the luxury of knowing that I *could* ask for money if I needed it. Without that promise of a financial safety net, working my way through college in a relatively cheap area would have been more financial risk than I should be expected to take on. Now, I was 18 so I probably would have given it a go anyway, but that doesn't mean it's reasonable.

Wages for unskilled labor are simply not high enough to provide any amount of financial security whatsoever. If you do not have relatives to lean on, or if you have anyone else you're responsible for, school and unskilled just don't mix. All of your time will be spent trying to keep your head above water and none of it will be spent on getting ahead."

Those are even worse sports from an entertainment and strategy standing than soccer/football. It's not hard to understand that for a sport to become *commercially successful* it has to have *both* accessability and entertainment value. Running has *massive numbers* of participants globally, it's just hard to sell tickets to a race. Soccer is *the* world sport because it's extremely accessable but also mildly entertaining to watch. My point is not that soccer sucks, but that the international version is a poor version of the sport and soccer could be much better than it is.

>And those poorly designed international concept from a sport that, according to you ""not a particularly well designed sport from an entrainment or strategy perspective."" Is choosen as the main source of sports entertainment around the globe.

Internationals became the dominate version because it was popular early on (like 1900s early on) and the kinds of major changes necessary to improve the sport just aren't ever going to happen. It's not like people thought long and hard about what version should be the international version. The English public schools sat down and codified a game they were already playing, and then spread that version around the world. 

It would be impossible to make the kind of major changes to the sport necessary to improve it, even only a few decades after invention, while it was still just another sport. Rugby had a *major* fissure over professionalism and the alternative version is never going to reach the levels union is at simply because of the head start union has.

I'm not saying soccer sucks, I'm saying soccer sucks in comparison to what it could be.

Soccer is the kind of sport that's so boring fan zones have various chants they sing throughout the game just to stay entertained. It's the kind is sport that promises entertainment, and gives you ten minute stretches of ""keep away."" It could be vastly improved, but it's much too late to make any major changes to the game.

I could have an idea for literally the ideal sport, but it's never going to get to soccer levels because soccer is an old entrenched power structure that will defend its capital with might."

Rust is just metal oxides. For iron it's mostly iron oxide Fe203, for copper you'll get more of a mix of oxides when dealing with regular weathering rust. For most rust you're going to encounter on Earth, the oxygen came from the O2 in the air. (The actual atoms might be from water sometimes, but it's not really important for our discussion because the production of rust uses up O2 while generally leaving water alone if the reaction has completed).

In order for metal atoms to rust (become oxides) they have to ""give up"" electrons to the oxygen they're going to bind to. This is quite difficult to do for some metals if it's just metal + O2, the reason has to do with energy transfers and energy barriers to reactions. Water can help pass electrons around, and *salt* water is waaaay better at it than fresh water. With water or salt water in the mix, the iron can more easily give up electrons to the solution and the solution can pass them along to the oxygen. It's like someone on the ground passing an object to someone standing on a ladder. In this analogy the person on the ladder reaches over a wall (energy barrier) and tosses the object down a hill."
