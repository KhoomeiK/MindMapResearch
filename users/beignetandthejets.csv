Do some people regret having kids and wish they could take it all back? For SURE, parenting is hard and often it gets foisted upon people who aren’t ready or never wanted it. I don’t think the majority of parents would undo their kids, though. However, I am speaking this from the position of someone in a stable, happy, long-term relationship that chose when they wanted to have  a child. I know there are many different circumstances that make it harder. Maybe I’m wrong and I’m the outlier."
