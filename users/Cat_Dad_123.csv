It appears you subscribe to, or relate to, Dr. Benjamin Spock. I do not stalk other people‚Äôs profiles but since your argument is based upon your pseudo reasoning, I read those posts. While it is apparent your parenting ideals come from the back pages of Mother Jones, you are in no means a parent. And by the odd ball chance you are, well let‚Äôs hope that doesn‚Äôt happen again.
