insanepeoplefacebook,fehz9gg,t1_fehw7d3,1579126884.0,"So, if I am understanding what you are trying to communicate, the mother should not have physically disciplined her daughter when she attacked the mom? If it were a stranger it would be titled self-defense. Since she was the parent, it’s called discipline. 

It appears you subscribe to, or relate to, Dr. Benjamin Spock. I do not stalk other people’s profiles but since your argument is based upon your pseudo reasoning, I read those posts. While it is apparent your parenting ideals come from the back pages of Mother Jones, you are in no means a parent. And by the odd ball chance you are, well let’s hope that doesn’t happen again.

This will be my last entry no matter if you reply or not. So you get the last word and the feeling of being in control...which I hope will keep you in the house tonight and away from the population as a whole.
