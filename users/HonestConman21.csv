worldnews,ff7fqsd,t1_ff7cphf,1579648514.0,The Iranians and the Chinese have authoritarian governments that forcefully prevent the citizens from voicing their concerns. We elect ours in even when they blatantly tell us to our faces how corrupt they are.  Let’s not skirt the blame here.  You can’t claim America is the epitome of freedom and democracy then blame everything on the government that we elect in.

There is no way what you’re describing is implicit from the instructions.  Not to mention stretching the dough out would still requiring using more toppings...doughs cheap, toppings and cheese aren’t. And if that’s how dominos does their Brooklyn style then there shouldn’t be further instructions required if the Brooklyn style is what’s ordered.

What I did experience too many times to count was people trying to get free shit by leaving notes in the comment section."
woof_irl,ff2ug8m,t1_ff2u5m6,1579524613.0,"Yes I have used vr headsets.  Which is exactly what informs me that it would most likely freak a dog the fuck out.  I can’t wrap my head around the fact that there are so many people arguing that the logical takeaway from all this is we don’t know so go for it, rather than we don’t know, and dogs don’t normally wear vr headsets,  so probably better not to do it.  

That’s not how logic works...that’s the opposite of logic."

Texans,ff21nuh,t1_ff21i3g,1579491394.0,Did you just take the time to write out the equivalent of plugging your ears and saying “la la la I can’t hear you”?

The type that makes empty threats and runs his mouth hoping to god he never has to actually follow through with anything he says.  But when push comes to shove he just moves the goalposts further back and never actually approaches the fact that nothing he says has any value or any real weight behind it.

You spout off these played out tired canned responses and high five yourself for how clever you think you are.  You’ve said the phrase “rent-free” like 3 times so far as if you came up with it.

These dickheads consistently will lose hands then criticize their opponents style of play.  In a game that is a combo of how you play your hand,  bluffing, and pure luck why does it fucking matter if they bet on the turn....it ended up winning didn’t it?  Not to mention it’s gambling...you’re betting on the hope that a card you need will turn up.  

Sore losers desperately trying to justify their losses by blaming the winner for “not playing right” is so annoying,  and poker is full of those people."
