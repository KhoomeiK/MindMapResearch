Barca,fe2j6x1,t3_eni5pw,1578838988.0,"It's a disaster waiting to happen, from getting his managers certification then coaches in a league that frankly until he joined i barely heard of and now to possibly coach against juventus, real madrid, liverpool and bayern...they are waving a magic wand...instead of getting rid of pique(im going to hear a lot of crap for this) ive never liked pique, busquets is a 25 minute man. We need to properly reinforce the team because its not good enough for valverde and it wont be good enough for any other coach, pique is slow and clumsy, think of all the plays we've seen where he has tied himself up into a knot and you think to yourself how simple they look and he managed to f it up. How many times he goes to ground when he doesnt need to, how many times he fouls and attacking player with his back to goal or when he is far from goal. These are mistakes you rarely see van dijk or maguire make. Pique is a huge if not the biggest problem but not the only one. Need a team that presses on defense and this team is too entitles to do that. Has won too much. When was the last time you saw anyone besides griezmann defending inside 30 yards? I know they ""have earned"" that right, if suarez and messi dont defend than at least use 8 players that do and the 3 subs that run live vidal, griezmann and roberto, just my humble opinion...go ahead reddit..."
Barca,fe07b0a,t3_eni5pw,1578804948.0,This isnt good. He has no real experience..
todayilearned,fcfju0h,t1_fccd5vw,1577630661.0,Antigua is nice and that's usually where most tourist start their trips in Guatemala but even though the country is small you will find many other locations that are just as beautiful and waaaay cheaper than Antigua...
todayilearned,fccd5vw,t3_eh15i5,1577597042.0,"Guatemalan here of mayan descent living in god ol' new jersey. Love reading about my country and my people, wish i went back a lot more often than i do but life is waaay too hard there. So much poverty, so much crime, so much government  corruption and the people there are still so well mannered and happy."
Barca,f9kud45,t3_e5cf3g,1575408052.0,"It's sad to imagine the sport without Messi. Ronaldo was only relevant to me when he faced Messi. The best brings out the best and Ronaldo has never done that. He has been all about himself but then we have the pleasure of watching la pulga just absolutely improving everyone around him. Not saying he doesnt have his faults, but i don't care if he doesn't defend or is not a prolific header, to many they are cons we can live with as long as he keeps the other team on their toes. With messi a game almost feels like 11 vs 9. La liga will suffer when its back to 11 vs 11"
