science,ffcbd0f,t1_ffc16rg,1579795774.0,"I've slipped my L4/L5 disc twice.  The first time required surgery, and it took a month to get it.  I've also had kidney stones a few times.  I'd actually say the kidney stone pain and slipped disc were pretty equal in pain levels.  Both were white knuckle, please fucking kill me, pain.

For anyone else unsure, and to add on to /u/donnymccoy, long term nerve pain ***sucks ass.***  I've got small fiber neuropathy from the bottom of my rib cage down (they don't regrow, and this treatment wouldn't help it looks like).  I've had constant pain since it started in early 2006.  It feels like a combination of hundreds of bee stings all at once, all the time, and that stinging you get when a part of your body ""falls asleep"" and wakes back up.  Cold feels like someone sanding the shit out of my skin with a power sander.  Every small pain is drastically amplified.  Something like stubbing your toe feels like you just full on kicked a wall.

It sucks the life out of you.  Constant fatigue, limited activity (the only exercise I can tolerate is swimming or riding a full suspension bike), irritability, memory problems and always feeling sluggish.  You just want the pain to stop, but it won't.  It's always there, chasing you down, relentless.  It's like the terminator.  Every time you think you've lost it, it's right there staring at you, reaching for you, ready to make you it's bitch."

Funny story time!

My mother in law swore up and down that store brand was ""poor people's"" food.  She swore it was nasty.  We all told her that in many/most cases it is exactly the same as name brand, just different packaging.  For thanksgiving, just after the commissary switched over to carrying their store brand, I made two pumpkin pies.  Both with store brand filling, but I made the crust.  She raved over it.  It was then that we all revealed that it was store brand filling.  All of us still jab at her with that from time to time."

They had to be custom made, and at the time costs somewhere north of 150$, and took 6 months to get made.

DMAcademy,fesohkv,t3_eqeu0k,1579367422.0,"Our play group includes 5 kids (my 3 and our friend's 2).  Two of the five almost always play, the other 3 swap in and out.  Oldest is 15, youngest is 12.  We've been playing about 2 years now.  We're a little loose with the rules for them.  We also allow the swap outs.  To me, it's important to allow that so they don't get burnt out.  As much as I love D&D, I can see where it can get boring in spots.  Especially when it's investigating things and there isn't much fighting going on.  When applicable, the swap out kids are kept to level with the main group.

Type of campaign to run.  We started with some stuff out of Yawning Portal (the first thing my son did was jump down the well at the inn, I made a song about it in a campaign I wrote).  We let some of the swap outs play as an NPC baby dragon we managed to recruit.  That way they aren't underpowered and get the ""I can't do anything"" burn out.  

The next campaign, they rolled their own char with everyone else.  By this time, they had seen what the mechanics were and how things kind of worked.  They had also seen some glimpses of how other classes played, and had formed an idea of what/how they wanted to play something of their own.  We heavily guided them on what the class can do, and what direction might be best for sub speccing.

A 9 year old may be a bit different, but by the time the first campaign was over they had started to become vested in the story itself.  They still did some swapping out, but showed more interest.  The fights were what interested them the most, motivation wise, not the treasure or anything else.

Overall, really highlighting the good and downplaying the bad/mess ups is the way to go.  You can show them why something wasn't a good idea, in a constructive way.  DM had my son roll the fall damage to highlight why it wasn't a good idea.  I had taken the platform down and was at the bottom, so I joked I was going to loot his body, but it became a running joke.  Be aware that she might not always be totally on board during the more boring parts, so allow the swap in and outs when needed to avoid burn out."

MMORPG,feomun6,t1_feoe3hh,1579302376.0,"I wonder if you may have a point here.  For me, I enjoy fantasy/medieval much more.  SciFi or futuristic has never really caught me.  Even single player (outside of big stompy mechs).  There are only a handful of scifi games that have kept me.  I loved Mass Effect, and kept through in the 3rd one just to finish the story line.

In TOR, I feel isolated.  Teaming up outside of dungeons is kind of pointless.  Most of the game can be completed solo with your companion.  Even some of the harder dungeons.  The NPCs just huddle in groups until someone comes along, and their detection range is pretty small.  They're so easy to beat outside of elite areas (which are also fairly easy) that it's almost mind numbing.  Some of the areas have some token combat going on, but it doesn't do much to bring the world alive.  

A couple of the class stories are decent, but you end up doing the same side quests from alt to alt.  I didn't feel like my decisions had much sway on the outcome of the overall story either.  I know that one is nitpicking, but if you're going to give me choices, they should at least make some sort of difference.

It wasn't the game mechanics, I liked those.  It was the graphics.  The side and rear view mirrors were so blurry to me that I couldn't really tell what was going on in them.  The rest of the game was very lacking, graphically, as well.  The cars were the only thing that were decent.  You also only really race 1 other car.

GT on the other hand, was much better in VR graphically.  I could tell what was going on in the rear and side view mirrors.  I do agree that DC VR probably pushed GT VR to what it is now.  However, you could tell a bit that the hardware was holding it back as well though.  You are only ever time trialing or racing just one other vehicle, same as DC.  The hardware doesn't have the capability yet to handle more than one other in that game.  I think GT even stated as such.

DC in VR also gives me motion sickness if I play for more than a couple races.  GT takes a couple hours to do so."

It's the sheer amount of misinformation and cherry picking out there.  People take the information out there as gospel (or are just too lazy, don't think to check) and take for ate face value.

An example:

I live near an AF base.  All bases that used a specific type of firefighting foam, which had been in use since the '70's, have inadvertently contaminated ground water in the area with PFOAs.  The local news has commercials for one reporter.  She brings out an interview she did with the base commander.  In the commercial, her clips say that the AF knew for years that the foam was hazardous, and did nothing about the foam.  She's trying to spin the story against both the AF and the local base.  The commander she interviewed had just arrived on base around a year prior.  The DoD did have some knowledge of PFOAs being bad, but the base didn't know (more on that below.)

The real truth:

Yes ""everyone"" knew it was bad, but not until in the early 2000's were some analysis starting to pop up.  Even then, the studies I can find don't seem to completely conclude it is hazardous as the effects on humans isn't well studied or understood yet.  It wasn't until 2012 that places were even required to test ground water for PFOAs.  The EPA had been working with manufacturers to lower their use of PFOAs by 95% by 2016 at the latest.  In 2018, the EPA, the office of management and budget, the top end of the DoD (waaay above base level) and department of health and human services were caught trying to suppress reports which showed the acceptable levels of PFOAs are much higher than they should be.  This is when the media caught it, nationwide, and the shit hit the fan.  The DoD is now working with the local communities to put in filters, and the DoD is funding almost all of it, at least here anyway.  For now, in my area, the water system has been supplemented by the nearest large town, which was unaffected.  Base personnel were also handing out bottled water until the temp solution was in place.  Local bases had no idea what the top end DoD was doing, but took the brunt of the backlash anyway.  A secondary point left out is that a base can't just change what firefighting materials they use.  That has to come both from higher up **and** the replacement has to be certified by the FAA.  Airports had finally been able to do so a few years before this issue, but the military was not (they're still in the process of trying to replace it, but it is a slow process.)

So if people take this at face value, and do no further research, they will conclude from this commercial that the base doesn't care about its community.  That isn't the case at all.  

This type of cherry picked clips or data is happening all over from news media and politicians that are supposed to represent us.  What has me hopeful is that schools seem to be trying to teach skills to weed through this information.  Unfortunately though, this effect is going to take time to disseminate.  The children getting taught these skills still have to deal with adults who dismiss it as ""liberal brainwashing"" and refute, or refuse, the correct information, or to do their own research.

I was in the AF, and stationed at a base housing refueling aircraft (KC-135 r/ts).  One girl we worked with found out she was having an allergic reaction to jet fuel.  They tried moving her all over the base, to different offices, trying to find a spot for her.  They couldn't find a spot where she wasn't having a reaction.  So they did their own testing.  The fumes were found all over the base, even in areas they had thought there would be no fumes present.  JP8 is also [linked to higher rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207633/) of neurological issues.

Airport workers are probably exposed to JP8, and other chemicals, but probably not in the levels that military personnel are.  Working on KC-135s, I'd regularly come home reeking of JP8.  Drogue missions and having to defuel for leaks and many other issues would have me covered in it.  Even in PPE, it gets in your clothes and on your skin on a regular basis.  All this on a state side base, and would be the same in overseas bases (worse sometimes if they are supporting a high ops tempo as corners get cut).

I think we should be testing what the affects are more.  I've got small fiber neuropathy, which started while I was in.  I keep having docs tell me it is likely caused by the JP8 exposure, but I don't have any one report that gives an absolute ""yes"".  Many others are probably in the same situation.

To top it off, I got a letter saying something changed and that they're changing BAH pay rates....and it was made retroactive for all of 2019.  So I owe 250$ because of it.  Gee...thanks."

There are generals and advisors to help with that, even the basic concept parts.  The difference is, the rest of the higher ups all listen when a general or someone chimes in and says ""you can't do that"".  Trump thinks all his decisions are correct, so a chime in of ""you can't do that"" gets ignored."

He's lived his life surrounded by ""yes men"", so he doesn't need feel he needs to think as all his actions are right.  So it really is both.  The only reason he didn't do the same to China or N. Korea is because they actually engage his banter back and forth, and thus draw attention to him.  Middle East hate is also big among the GOP and his followers right now.  As far as he sees it, this is a win win for him."
technology,fd3q7ja,t1_fd2p1o8,1578160738.0,"I got to do the trade while in the military (sort of).  I started my career in the AF as a crew chief (think a racing pit crew, but a bit more advanced) on KC-135s.  Due to a shoulder injury, I was cross trained to information management.  I did nothing but computer repair in that field.

Jet needs a 150k lbs fuel load?  It's 40mph wind and feels like 10F outside?  Well...bundle up, truck will be back to check on you in 30 mins.  2 hours later it does check on you.  There's a fuel leak, and we need to drain the 600lbs of fuel left in the tank at 11pm, and there is no one coming to relieve you?  Well, better get on it.  Rain, snow, bitter cold wind, horribly hot and swamp ass?  None of that matters, because the mission has to go.  Getting soaked in jet fuel was the norm.  Even in full PPE, it gets everywhere.  Hydraulic fluid gets everywhere.  It's almost impossible to get it out of your clothes.  That nice gortex you were issued is now useless for rain protection once hydraulic fluid or jet fuel touches it.

Computer repair was so, so much easier.  Computer needs fixed asap?  I'll take 2 minutes and swap it with a working one.  12 computers all have problems with them?  Line em all up on a switch and reload windows on all 12 at the same time while I head to the snack bar or go fix something else.  I'll be back in 45 mins when it's time for the next step of reloading windows.  The worst I was exposed to was hard water from a water leak onto our local LAN switch during a warm weekend.

I did like the CC job, don't get me wrong, I love to fix things.  However with it came a shit ton of injuries that have left me unable to work at the age of 41 (and the issues started in early '06).  Jet fuel exposure, hydraulic fluid exposure, minor injuries (shoulder, wrist and back) drastically exacerbated by dragging around 50 lb tool boxes and 100 lb fuel hoses.  All that for only 5 years working that job.  Then you're kind of stuck in that field.  The skills you obtain doing aircraft maintenance doesn't really transfer over to anything else outside of more aircraft maintenance or working an aircraft assembly job."

One tray I put in a vacuum seal bag and lightly vacuumed them (not letting it suck all the air out and smushing everything).  They all stuck together.  A second batch was put in my chest freezer on a cookie sheet to freeze individually.  All of them ended up having the wrapping crack."

todayilearned,fcvlwqb,t1_fcv4bs9,1578004918.0,"I think it might be worse to be the parent of the shooter.  If your child is killed, you can at least place the blame somewhere, and even might have the chance to move on from it.  Your child was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It wasn't something that was really in your control, and it was nothing you did wrong.

If your child was the shooter, you always have to wonder if it was your fault.  You always have to wonder where you went wrong (even if it wasn't anything you did).  Was it you?  Was it your spouse?  Was it both of you?  Was it genetic?  Even if your child insists it wasn't your fault, you can never fully know.

If you have other kids, let the over protection or under protection begin.  Was it because you were overprotective?  Better give them more room.  Was it because you didn't watch them enough?  Time to be in every aspect of their life.  Since you never really know, it would probably cause huge swings both ways."

technology,fcazf7l,t1_fca4w2f,1577579643.0,"I think part of this is a little on Ring, though not enough to warrant a lawsuit.  I bought the home security system as well, I replaced my existing ADT with it.  I am fairly tech savvy, but I didn't know there was two factor available.  Nowhere was it mentioned in the instructions (about 8 months ago though).  

The instructions overall for install were lacking a bit.  I think this had more to do with Ring being new in the home security arena though.  Some of the instructions weren't completely clear.  If it wasn't for some familiarity with tech, electronics and maintenance overall, I would have been a bit lost.  Some of the instructions weren't completely clear on what to do, and the steps were not completely clear on order of installation.  

Another oddity was with getting a certificate for monitoring.  Ring just kind of leaves it up to the customer.  That isn't a huge issue, but it took me a few phone calls to figure out if I needed one and where to get it.  My city hall had no clue what the hell I was talking about (which is where Ring says to call).  They passed me to a local fire chief.  He wasn't sure, so he passed me to a local sheriff (contracted from the next city b/c we don't have our own), who passed me to the closest major city.  They were the ones who actually knew what I was talking about, after transferring to the correct department (I didn't need one outside of the one large city's limits if anyone is curious).  I then had to call Ring's contracted call center to let them know I didn't need a certificate (which didn't require any other verification for some reason, just my word over the phone).  

Small stuff like this is what Ring should be taking care of if they want to be serious in the home security front.  You have to streamline this stuff.  If I'm installing it myself, which is pretty simple, all of this stuff needs to be streamlined and the instructions need to be crystal clear on what steps to do, what order to do them in, some things are going to have to be taken care of by Ring and it has to be written for a non tech savvy person."
