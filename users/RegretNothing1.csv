MagicArena,ff9j3to,t1_ff9iifo,1579714096.0,"I get that but what I’m saying is there is no need. When the discard trigger is on the stack and you kill Reggie instantly, the trigger still goes off and makes them discard. No need to set a stop. Any of your opponents allowing it into the main phase aren’t doing it right or they think killing him will prevent the discard."

SquaredCircle,ff8gybi,t3_es8l8j,1579678020.0,"Not Ali, they are done with him. Rico is a strong pick, I think he and Drew have an equal shot at that. Brock is a near lock as is Roman. Seth will be gone, KO will eliminate him. Man that 4th is really tough call. I really think it could be Keith Lee as it’s almost assured they will want an NXT representative. I just wish I could trust them to know how hype a situation that would be. Ciampa would be a fine choice as well but I don’t think it’s happening.

Women no clue. Shayna, Bliss, Banks and Charlotte."

Then after High school I just stopped watching. Flash forward all the way to a few years ago. I had here and there kept up with wwe just through YT clips or random stories I’d see online. Then I’d hear about Kenny and others and check out a big match or YT a segment or AE return here and there. When it was time for mania and the Hardy’s came back I watched the show, I had seen and heard all about the Hardy’s work in TNA. After that I said I’m just gonna start watching raw and Smackdown again and have seen every show since. I also go back and check out past angles or storylines from the last couple decades on YT and watch the incredible wrestling bios YT channel."

It’s tempting to add more to the curve like Pegasus archon, but you really need those cheap creatures to have the mana to protect them or the house of cards crashes down. It’s still a bit too easy to draw the wrong half of the deck, which makes me want just a bit more board presence."

spikes,fevtmhd,t1_feuzq2x,1579401338.0,My problem with Uro in simic is I’ve almost never escaped him in relevent time. You can almost never escape unless you play a cavalier and at that point you are either playing more elementals for insane reef runs or winning the game with nissa krasis finale or mass manip. I’m close to saying Uro is overrated.
spikes,feug6qx,t1_fetzofh,1579386214.0,"You can tell how its generally supposed to play within a few matches. Play bad creatures, hope they survive, pump them full of bad auras, hope you have the right protection for them (you are dead to a single QB), hope you have a clear path to swing for the win with no interaction."

Too many hands of all auras and no action, karametras let me down way too often not being able to protect non enchantments and gods willing would be a million times better."
spikes,fetrgpm,t3_eqesif,1579378922.0,Absolutely god awful. Played 3 matches and got completely crushed or did absolutely nothing hoping 2 shitters without lifelink could go the distance. Any deck with a pulse will crush this to bits.

Touch is good, that’s very flirty. You can still be forward and just say “hey I think you are really cute.”. This will likely embarrass him but in a good way and if he’s into you, or could be, he will say similar back. If you aren’t ready to be that forward, just stick to light convo and grazing touches. Pretend to pick fuzz off his shirt or something. But I really suggest to rip the bandaid and go for either the compliment or the ask out."
AskRedditAfterDark,fee17co,t3_eoocht,1579024258.0,"Very easy, just go up and talk to him, preferably alone so he doesn’t feel like he has to act a certain way around his friends or yours. Strike up a simple conversation, even as simple as “hey hows it going.”. As soon as he is paying attention to you and engaged in the conversation you are ready. You just need to say “hey so I think you are really cool, would you want to go out with me sometime?”. If he is into you at all this will make his day. Don’t be freaked if he starts to reply strangely or mumbly, he’s likely just nervous and unsure how to respond to “seem cool”. Just smile and wait for his response. Unless you are going after real D bags he will enthusiastically say yes and you can exchange numbers, plan etc. Don’t “play hard to get” or any other BS from sitcoms, just be real and straightforward, this blows our minds."
