Undergrad TAs got the same pay as grad TAs, but many of them were hired at 8 hours or less. This made them ineligible for tuition remission. The union argued that this was a way of avoiding the contract's requirements. Arguably the university could *only* hire undergrad TAs at 8 hours instead of any grad student at 10 hours or more.

berkeley,feg1qjx,t1_fef9hn9,1579073167.0,"Not really, GPA is influenced by tutoring, previous experience and familial background. If you have a software engineer for a dad, went to a high school that offers AP CS, and/or can spend money and time on tutoring instead of working part-time you'll probably have a better GPA.

Berkeley as a whole does a pretty good job of admitting students from disadvantaged backgrounds (read lower stats/poor ECs) based on holistic factors. I think they'd be able to figure out admission to CS."
berkeley,feg1099,t1_fefnqem,1579072316.0,"A little besides the point, but it's almost impossible to take the prereqs at CC (I think there's only one that offers 61A and 70). Most transfers take all of their prereqs at Berkeley, although if you've taken data structures you can do a connector course instead of 61B. 

Changing that seems like a good way to cut down on the demand, tbh. Maybe develop connector classes for 61A, 61C, and 70 too, or allow people to test out of them?"

OP and the woman were well-meaning, but both also sucked. OP should've tried harder to make his daughter comfortable by giving her more options. The coworker was out of town but she's probably not the only woman in the city, and maybe his daughter would have preferred to wait a day until she was back. He could've at least given her the option.

Maybe your parents should've given your sister more options too instead of forcing her to shop with her mom. Maybe she would've preferred going with a cousin or something."

OP himself says that he has a female coworker that his daughter is close to, but even if she didn't exist he could get creative. Danny Tanner asked Uncle Jesse's girlfriend to teach his oldest daughter about bras and makeup.

If there aren't any competent women around, OP should probably move unless he's planning to teach his daughter to put in a tampon himself. Plus, something seems to be killing off all the women in his area."
AmItheAsshole,feckzxl,t1_feckrp7,1578976497.0,"No... dad could've said ""I'm glad you told me. Bras might cost more than $50 and I can't send you alone anyway. I can take you, or we can ask (female adult) or (other female adult) or (other female adult) to take you. What would make you most comfortable?""

You know, generally give her some amount of control and choice at a time when she's losing a lot of control over her own body.

If his daughter is old enough to buy bras she's old enough to exercise that level of autonomy. She should be encouraged to speak up for herself and not just forced to go with what's easiest."
AmItheAsshole,fecj4r8,t3_eofyl9,1578975169.0,"ESH. The lady was out of line but if your daughter was *that* embarrassed about it did you really need to push it? You could have found an adult woman somewhere (female relative, neighbor, friend's mom, etc.) to take her. 

Your daughter shouldn't be embarrassed by bras, tampons and other puberty-related things and will eventually stop, but you didn't need to push her on that right now. You could've stressed that it's normal and not embarrassing but you want her to be comfortable and go shopping with someone who makes her feel comfortable.

It's not that dads as a group shouldn't help their daughters out, but that kids going through puberty should be helped out by people that make them feel comfortable. In this particular case that wasn't you.

Edit: Also, if her mom isn't in the picture you should find and establish a female role model for her. She's eventually going to need tampons, shaving stuff, and maybe birth control and will probably not want to ask you for help buying them or learning to use them."
