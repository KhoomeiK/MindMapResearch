depression,fed5631,t3_eofgoa,1578999397.0,"I highly doubt it. I know myself better than anyone and I only tolerate me... Sometimes less. I know that some people like me a little, a few friends, my boyfriend. I've got em all fooled for now."
anxietymemes,fdjc859,t3_elcyw2,1578464987.0,This has been me since last year when I got a customer service job and also started branching out and talking to people at school.

depression,fctiqn1,t3_eil5uo,1577944669.0,"Same. I think I express it as annoyance, but really I do feel guilty and I still sometimes feel like a faker even though I've been put on antidepressants."
me_irl,fcpbwib,t3_eiax6q,1577857607.0,I had to wear a back brace too. It was traumatic.

selfharm,fc505h9,t3_eg4s0n,1577436300.0,"In 2016, I was having a breakdown. I hated myself so much my heart ached. I desperately didn't want to be me. I was 13. Impulsively, I scratched my chest. It drew blood and I instantly began to calm down. I knew I'd crossed a line that night. 

I only started regularly doing it, with tools, in 2018 though. Started off burning, then moved to cutting."

depression,fc4izjk,t3_efwqy4,1577418038.0,"Of course it doesn't have a purpose. I get really annoyed when people say stuff like ""Things happen for a reason"". They don't. It astounds me that all these people have never even thought deeply about life. It's so obviously devoid of inherent meaning."
depression,fc4issw,t3_eg4qv1,1577417882.0,"I have a boyfriend. It doesn't cure depression. In fact being in a relationship makes me more anxious, plus I feel like I don't deserve it."
depression,fc4ikq5,t3_efyc5z,1577417693.0,I'm exactly like this. All of a sudden my emotional state depends on this one person who knows me only as an acquaintance.

depression,fc23gzl,t3_efpxc4,1577338885.0,"I'm in this position, have been for a long time. I just started on medication (fluoxetine), which appears to be the most hopeful looking solution. Maybe consider that."
