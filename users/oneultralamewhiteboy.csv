Psychonaut,ff8675e,t1_ff8403t,1579667112.0,"> can someone explain why psychs aren't yet where molly got to?

What are you talking about? The FDA has given psilocybin breakthrough status not once but twice. It approved esketamine. The FDA loves psychedelics, although not DMT or some of the more obscure ones as much. But the agency also hates cannabis and is doing a pretty shitty job of regulating CBD."

DrugNerds,fezd0g6,t1_fez52bt,1579456051.0,"Hi /u/Borax is this true? This site is astroturfing? It posts a lot of complex psychedelic science stuff and links to sources, but comes at the topic from a different angle than a straight study that I thought could encourage discussion here. Dunno if this site is allowed or not."
