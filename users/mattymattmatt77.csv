geology,fduz8sd,t3_emuqvq,1578741268.0,"The graph he showed you trying to correlate CO2 and temperature is misleading. The time scale is huge, and minute details are lost.

Very interesting how this is used to show how some are trying to show CO2 changes temp. This graph was the basis for a presentation in a climate change class. 

I don’t really know where I stand anymore on it. I’ve decided to just control my own little circle and control the things that I can. I know that sounds apathetic, but with so much bad info and people playing on your emotions (both sides) how can you trust anything other than what you see?"

Maybe the unreasonables from yesterday were millennials, but who knows? I’ve seen millennials who are super cool and trying to do the right thing and I’ve seen, well anyone from any generation acting incongruently to their generations denoted “values”. I’m starting to think of everyone on the internet as staunch opinionites, unwavering in the face of facts or reason. Eager to drop an insult that if argued against only creates exasperation and facepalming, getting the conversation nowhere. All willing to double down on their opinion and who they side with, unable to understand any hypocrisy presented. 

I said let’s create change the right way, like yes! Let’s do it I’m AGREEING with you we do need change and was downvoted. I mean, I did say millennial so I guess others had to stick up for that. You can’t say that about him boomer! Lol what does that say about people? 

I’m tired of being informed, it has only gotten me more frustrated that I can’t do anything about it. Anything I’ve touched, eaten, or communicated with is produced by little poor people somewhere else and all I see is something on the shelf. There’s a huge disconnect and now the disconnect is growing into interpersonal relationships and how we communicate with one another.
