The one I remember the most wasn't spectacular or anything, it was just me walking through a field, my hand touching the long grass around me and a drink in my other. Somehow I knew I was back in time walking through a field in the middle ages. That was it. It was just so damn vivid. The colors, the smells, the feel of the grass. It was simple but the senses were all in overdrive to make it feel real."

It healed wrong and I only found out when I tried to go for my dream of walking across Canada. My foot kept flaring up with intense pain (carrying like 60 lbs and hiking all day everyday). It made me walk funny to alleviate the pain and that made my knee give out. Had to cut it short and only found out it had actually been broken when I got it checked out again to see why it hurt so much. Kinda sucked.

history,ff6hsun,t3_erojdm,1579627494.0,"I know one of the original difficulties was an amphibious assault. Romans were never known for their seamanship and many vessels would be sunk or lost in storms. Also the ""British"" armies would see them coming and follow their fleet with their armies. Any foothold gained on the beaches would be constantly harassed and with ships getting lost logistics were an issue. I think the YouTube channel historia civilis has an episode in Cesears attempts at conquering Britain and why it was so hard."

totalwar,ff3rmgr,t3_er4ffz,1579547357.0,I knew I'd like Warhammer total war because I used to play the old miniature game and also sunk a bunch of hours into that epic LOTR mod for Rome total war. I didn't play it for awhile though because I was tired of total war games. Empire was a snooze fest for me and shogun 2 constantly crashed on my computer so I started giving them a miss. I wish multiplayer was more thought out for Warhammer though. Sooooo much fun but there's no progression or ranking or anything
GetMotivated,ff3p2sm,t3_erbqv2,1579545802.0,I'm sure there are plenty of people who die of old age and never really figured it out. I don't think you're supposed to. As far as I can tell we are the part of the universe that strives to understand itself. It only makes sense that since we can't really do that in its entirety that we also can't really fully know ourselves.
AskReddit,ff3ohzz,t3_er9gj0,1579545449.0,My opinion: why not both? Also throw in wars and untold famine/migrations caused by a rapidly changing climate with a drastically reduced ability to retain healthy ecosystems. The future is bright.
