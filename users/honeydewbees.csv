Assistance,ff9dkes,t1_ff9bbon,1579710671.0,I don’t know how you would feel about it but sometimes posting on fb with a gofundme can help. I would also explicitly shame the place you worked at
relationship_advice,ff9b349,t1_ff99eia,1579708918.0,Yeah um..I’ve met violent people and I had the decency to not let their behavior wash over me because I am accountable for my own actions. He’s not a copy monkey.
AskReddit,ff8ga8x,t3_es59kl,1579677168.0,My friend and i used to ride our bikes to our future middle school and grab sticks to catch the parasites that went down the storm drain. Years later I realized that the parasites were actually dead worms that were washed down after heavy rain!

AmItheAsshole,ff890bi,t3_ery4cl,1579669531.0,I dealt with a very low-key version of this when my mom would buy a bunch of dollartree crap and would ship it to me in a box at college. I lived close to that store and found it weird she would spend money on shipping me little girl hair ties and headbands when i was 22

Employment,ff2ao4c,t3_er8b9l,1579498874.0,Dude i know it sucks but if you dip with only 6months on your belt you will basically be out right back in the position where your colleagues are at. Try to try at least a year and consider moving closer to lower your commute!
AskWomen,feylees,t1_fev7xmg,1579447150.0,Thank you! I’ve tried getting to know some of his friends but most of them are guys. I do enjoy the area though. I live near Irving Park!

Assistance,fenethr,t3_eq303b,1579283155.0,Please reach out to a school counselor for assistance just in case! My friend who had to apply to daca made good friends with her counselors and found ways to receive sponsorship for her application. If you do decide to go home make sure to let your work know your situation so that you may go back and start. I wish i could help financially but im in the negative right now. Good luck!!!

Employment,feihp3k,t3_epaus6,1579138780.0,"I’m putting it to being young and inexperienced but it was not ok to ask a girl out while you were working.  It doesn’t matter if you were shy and non-intimidating, you just can not do that in a job. Therefore, you have learned your lesson here. They might let you have it back or maybe not, but doing that type of thing to a customer is uncomfortable in most situations they are interested in a service and what happened is not what they signed up for."

Advice,fefsd0i,t1_fefpfl2,1579063757.0,"So you think suicide is the answer to making your dad proud? You don’t have to go to school if you don’t want to. Try an apprenticeship, volunteer, do something different than you usually do. Because what is happening right now obviously isn’t making you happy so it seems like you gotta switch something up! I really recommend volunteering because you don’t know how much of a difference you can make unless you try and see!"

jobs,fcutx7d,t1_fcuafmf,1577988414.0,Exactly if someone keeps asking for your mental health records i would feel harrassed
jobs,fctod7m,t1_fctneqy,1577951355.0,"Yo. If a coworker wants to pry about OP’s medical history, then I think it would be close to harassment and off to HR they go. Anyone can say that they were dealing with a chemical imbalance in their brain that required being in the care of family and bedrest. “Nobody knew what was wrong,” is a good enough answer for anyone. Nothing more needs to be said. it’s not like they lied about a degree. Their medical records are not up for review."
jobs,fctmwqd,t1_fctlxzl,1577949464.0,The term illness can be regarded to the mind as well. OP is fine and if they would like to give more details about it they can. People who are depressed seek therapists and even take medication for it.
jobs,fctlsbp,t1_fctlfm3,1577948075.0,Mental illness is definitely something to suffer with. What good is your healthy body if you felt like you couldn’t use it properly?
