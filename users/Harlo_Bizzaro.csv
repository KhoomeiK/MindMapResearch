SubredditAdoption,fdtju81,t3_en1x55,1578717797.0,"R/have will showcase things people have, specifically collectables. You can show the normal/obscure things you collect. 

RULES: 

Rule 1 
Post images of things you have or collect. Anything is accepted. If the thing you collect is NSFW it is accepted, but not necessarily encouraged.

Rule 2
Hoarding is NOT collecting! All items must be of the same category, and not a bunch of crap that you have stored. It is NOT a hoarding support group (Although that is a good idea!). 

Rule 3 
Must be four or more items. 

I will take suggestions from you in the comments, I hope you guys like this idea! What do you collect? Let me know in the replies!"

AskReddit,fcjlske,t3_ehg5ac,1577692942.0,"Not me, but my aunt's mom. (Not really my aunt, my mom's friend, but I call her my aunt.) 
My aunt has three kids, and was driving them all home. Now, my aunts mom is crazy and homeless. It is not her fault, as she had brain damage at an early age. She was riding in the car, and if I'm not mistaken, the whole point of the trip was to bring the homeless mom to come stay with them. 
The car they were riding in had never had any prior problems. They had recently got it, used. Now, my aunt's mom goes ""Can we pull over?"" 
Aunt: ""Why?"" 
""I don't know, the kids aren't safe."" 
""They're fine."" 
AM keeps insisting 
A: ""Okay fine, we'll pull over for a few minutes, and if nothing happens, we'll keep driving."" 
They pull over. 
The car, not only had something wrong with it, but the entire inside of the car caught on fire and the car ignited and exploded. 
Now, this happened on the freeway my dad takes to get home from work, so he just happened to see them and pull over and pick all of them up. 
I don't know how she knew, and if it wasn't for picture evidence, I would think it was fake. It turned out to be something wrong with the heater or something I don't remember. 
TLDR: Brained damaged women's gut feeling saves daughter and grand kids from exploding car"
