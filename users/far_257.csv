A. We'll never know. Dare to dream what could have been?

B. Bossy played in a completely different era and is hard to compare. I also wasn't alive when he played so I'll refrain from commenting. 

Bure is, obviously, and incredibly gifted player and it's a shame how we ran him out of town. His career was cut short by knee injuries and thus a higher proportion of his career is him in his ""prime"". He was also an incredible cherry picker. It wasn't as bad when he played for us, but when he played for the Panthers he would play something like 25-30 minutes a night because he would literally just float up ice and wait for the puck to be broken out to him. Yes he was a fitness beast but also not a very complete player. We love to meme about the Ovechkin disconnected controller thing but stats show he is far from a defensively liability. Lastly, longevity is a factor in how we measure players. This is one of the reasons why Gretzky is still considered the undisputed GOAT even though Lemieux arguably had a higher peak before being taken out by back injuries and cancer."

canucks,febg6fm,t1_feb8bta,1578958493.0,"Not OP but even though Ovi's goal scoring has become less diverse over the last few years, it hasn't really affected his production. Even if you think he's a one-trick, it's a damn good trick since no one seems to be able to spot him.

Yes, Backy is a great playmaker, and the other threats on the Caps, especially on the PP, make Ovi harder to contain.

But there are plenty of snipers. The PP one-timer isn't an Ovi-only thing, and there are plenty of players who take shots from that spot that have potent play makers on the half-boards and feisty net-front presences. Yet Ovi is distinctly successful.

He has also maintained his productivity into his old age. Kovalchuck is just a couple years older than Ovi and his production is obviously no where close to Ovechkins. Yes, he was on inferior teams with inferior supporting casts, but it's not like he was carrying the Kings or even producing like one of their core players. 

Kovalchuk is a fantastic player and it is a shame that he was stuck in ATL for so long, but I think the argument here is less to detract from him as it is to state Ovi has proven himself to truly be a generational player. He is the best goal scorer of the modern era and arguably in the history of the league. 

You bring up several other goal scorers who are greats on their own, but their production simply does not match the great 8. It's raw numbers, and while we'll never know what could have been (remember when we used to meme about Jagr never going to the KHL?), it's unlikely that even a well-supported Kovy would be more productive than Ovechkin simply because no one else is."

I guess the other thing is that there like 13 different workouts on that wiki page alone not counting the variations, and while they're super detailed in telling you WHAT to do, they don't really tell you ""do this workout if you want to achieve ____"".

Fitness,fdk75ws,t3_elqtc0,1578497621.0,"Any tips / resources to recommend for an intermediate rock climber, but beginner weightlifter? I was reading through the wiki page on Strength / Muscle building and to be honest with you I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what most of those acronyms / numbers / exercise names even are. So in that sense, I'm an absolute beginner.

On the other hand, despite my near-zero knowledge of form, what makes a good routine, etc. etc. when it comes to weights, I like to think of myself as at least in above-average shape thanks to my other activities (mostly rock climbing and skiing, but also running, yoga and hockey). 

Anyway, I've got now-recurring finger injury that's going to force me to stay away from the climbing gym / crag for a while and I don't want to lose any more strength than I have to while I recover, which is making me turn to weights. 

My primary goals are:
1) Stay in shape (or even improve) for climbing and skiing 
2) Improve aesthetics (I got sucked into a group 6-pack challenge by some New Year's Resolutioner friends) through a bit of bulk (not too much, i'm still a climber) and less body fat

If it matters I'm male, 5'10"", fluctuate between 155 and 160lbs and, if you believe my bathroom scale (I don't), am a little under 14% body fat."

skiing,fdgxg7r,t1_fdgci1i,1578410714.0,"So I'll state my bias upfront so you can take my opinion with the appropriate amount of salt.:

I grew up in Vancouver and consider Whistler my home mountain. I have skied there more than any other resort. I have been to Telluride once, and it was early season, and I was with a large group. 

Whistler/Blackcomb is MASSIVE and has way more ski-able terrain than Telluride, however, this year is probably one of the worst snow seasons my lifetime for the mountain. I've heard it's been better recently, but when I was there over the holidays they were well, well behind season and the bulk of the alpine was still closed. Obviously by February it could be a completely different story but you should be aware of how the season has started. Nevertheless, I don't know the level of you and your group, but Whistler/Blackcomb is so large that you'll essentially be able to find terrain for anyone if you're willing to look hard enough. The key question is always ""how skied out is it?"" because Whistler is incredibly popular and high traffic. 

I have no insight into Telluride conditions this year, and when I was there the bulk of the mountain was still closed due to it being early season, so I won't really comment on Telluride terrain. 

Now on to the Villages. Whistler Village is more corporate, has more selection of restaurants/bars/food/activities in general, and is ""more lively"" in that there are more people, but frankly I never really meet new people while at Whistler. My experience with Telluride is quite the opposite. The town is basically one long street that resembles ""main street"" from an old American Western movie. In that sense, it's not nearly as grand, but the vibe/ culture is unique. I met a lot of new people despite being there with a group and found locals and tourists alike to be friendly and outgoing.

I guess the other thing to factor in is that Whistler is a short drive from Vancouver should you want to do ""city"" stuff before or after your ski trip, while Telluride is quite the journey from Denver or any major city."

There are buses but they are slow and infrequent. 

That being said, the North Shore has some of the best natural beauty stuff in the region. Depending on the weather this particular spring (and the accompanying snow melt), there may be some pretty awesome hiking you can do with trail heads only a few minutes drive from the city. March is a tad early but we're off to the worst ski season in my lifetime this year so there may not be too much snow anyway.
