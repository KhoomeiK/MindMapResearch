It's hard to find people like that though when you accept so much less for yourself. Try to remember that if being around someone makes you feel bad then that's *their* fault, not yours. Talking to people should help, if it doesn't then they're not the right people.

Food doesn't all taste like cardboard any more but I can be happily munching on something and half way through it'll suddenly make me wretch. 

It makes a massive difference to my mental health when I can eat a reasonable amount in a day. At this point I'm kind of looking at it like medicine, if I can take some vaguely nutritious food at least twice a day then I feel much better. I don't always manage it but I know it's important. Food and sleep are what your brain needs to function.

There are also groups on Facebook that have some really great advice that might be worth checking out. 

As far as street parking goes it depends on how ""stealth"" your van is. If it passes for a normal van then, as long as your sensible, you shouldn't get into any bother. Don't take the piss, make a lot of noise or mess and I think most people will leave you be. Some places might even allow you on their land as extra security, always worth asking politely. 

For internet there are some pretty good deals on wifi dongles that seem to do a pretty good job. 

Just start googling, read blogs, join groups, it's a pretty friendly community and most are happy to share their knowledge. Sorry I can't give you more specific information but there are a lot of variables to take into account. Finding as many sources as possible will give you some good ball park figures. 

Best of luck, dude!"
