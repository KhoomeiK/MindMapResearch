todayilearned,fetg20h,t1_feoorcj,1579375122.0,"Lol no way is 120 remotely normal on reddit, and you ate confusing intelligence with knowledge. The average IQ 200 years ago would have undoubtedly been much higher than it is today, adjusting perhaps for environmental factors. It is likely that paleolithic hunter-gatherers had much great intellect than us. IQ is dropping every year.

Reddit is a collection of communities that by design punish unpopular opinion so it is strange to assume the IQ would be high here.

There are no Forrest Gumpd. The military does not take anyone who scores below the 31st percentile on the ASVAB (except for the Army) and most score higher than half the nation. The average servicemembers is going to be smarter than the average civilian. As for special forces selection, you do not need to be unusually smart -- personality traits are more of a factor."

Suleimani just ordered an attack that killed an American and put our entire embassy at risk. It didn't turn into a Benghazi because we had a President that stood up for our people.
