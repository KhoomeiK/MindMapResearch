Pennsylvania never gained anything from voting blue. So no. They aren't happy with the dems. I live two hours from Pittsburgh. I've been to Philly. I ain't out here taking polls. I can tell you that Biden isn't loved up here. He's hated. Not just on his own merits. Partially because of the history of democrats never really standing up here."

Someone in my family, as a teen hit someone else with a baseball bat and murdered them, then blamed their best friend and watched him go to prison for a long time.

Some people a long time ago lent our last name to some people who were criminals to allow them entry to the country.

My great grandfather worked on the rail road and had a family at every stop.

todayilearned,fep3hyh,t1_fep322c,1579311306.0,You're comparing apples to oranges. Backed by most likely flawed statistics. The reality is that elevators are inherently more dangerous than walking down the street.  Based solely on the fact that the elevator is a machine that without proper  maintenance can breakdown. I can watch where I walk. I can't control gravity.

todayilearned,feowgjc,t1_feovuw3,1579306884.0,"Incorrectly. Getting robbed and being murdered are two very different things, and surely you can die very easily from very benign things. I'm not arguing that this logical conclusion isn't possible. I'm not even arguing that cars are inherently dangerous. I'm merely stating that the Thought experiment mentioned In the earlier post does have some merit and that these straw man arguments against it are little silly."
todayilearned,feovkop,t1_feov04x,1579306347.0,Those arent equivalent and a car doesn't stop strongarm robbery. You can be robbed while you are in a car. I fail to see how being robbed at gun point in your home has anything to do with walking being safer than driving on a highway.

todayilearned,feothut,t1_feoskfe,1579305200.0,"That's silly, because ive already stated the Thought experiment only gives the problem. it doesn't begin to discuss solutions.  Also it wasn't 'Ted's argument.' It was his advisor's thought experiment. As I said previously, i don't agree with the idea that all of technology is inherently bad. I'm not a Unabomber apologist, I don't understand why you would frame your post that way."

Hell I've often heard driving on the highway is more dangerous than flying.  What could be safer than your own two feet? I'm just trying to say that while i don't agree with Mr bomber, this is more of a straw man argument. He never said horses were the solution to the problem, just that the problem exists. Its a thought excercise."

I am a bernie supporter but I like yang too and it saddens me to see such silliness and hostility. Yang isn't about that. I understand that the dnc has upset a lot of yang supporters. ( i supported bernie in 2016, I know how it feels.) Don't lash out randomly! Your backlash needs to be pointed directly at dnc leadership. Don't do what we did in 2016 and make your candidate look bad! Wishing you all the best!"

JoeRogan,fdwk7j5,t1_fdwgmz6,1578759552.0,That's an assumption. Not evidence. If you've never seen a schizo-affected or bi-polar person at their worst then you just can't understand.

YangForPresidentHQ,fdv43x4,t3_emwutu,1578742971.0,I'm a bernie fan and I've watched yang quite a bit too. What I would say is just because a mod on an internet forum not moderated directly by the team is an asshole doesn't mean you should just jump ship. Lol I wouldn't say 'never yang' if I got banned from this sub. Because it doesn't reflect on Andrew personally if I get banned on Reddit. This whole post is a bit silly.  As per your question i believe he has talked about social media in the past. I think joe rogan podcast is one place.
