Edit: Oooh I see by your comment history you're a troll. Carry on then."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,feqaeei,t1_fepmw08,1579339484.0,I'd hope they are talking about the parent/parents as the stupid adult in this situation.
JETProgramme,femka87,t3_epyubf,1579259845.0,"Hey! I'd say my honeymoon period has ended just because it's become just another place, but I'm actually really content. In fact, I was incredibly depressed when I first got here and it's gotten progressively better as I've continued to acclimate.

If that changes though, I'll follow the advice I got at my pre-departure orientation which helped me through the first few months: don't isolate, even if you're tempted. It will compound whatever depression you're already facing."

Coming home is a bit strange though because they slip back into ""taking care of me/coddling/overprotective"" mode really quickly. Once I point it out though they do their best to stop."

JETProgramme,fcxs54n,t3_ejhcyv,1578069637.0,"Heya! I think STEM is such a popular acronym that it will be fine. Writing it out would be akin to writing out ""Automatic Teller Machine"" instead of ATM. If you introduced other acronyms spelled out first and then moved into abbreviations for ease of reading, I don't see why that would be a problem either. Also, just some gentle advice: try to relax until you get the results back. There's literally nothing you can do about it now, so try to occupy yourself with things as much as possible! Easier said than done I know, but I think it will help in the long run. Best!"
