My car goes faster because of the weight I lost when I took out the brakes!"
SweatyPalms,feegy1o,t1_fee2d3t,1579033537.0,It could be as simple as a smooth plastic piece that covers where the rope makes contact with the wall and rounds the corner a bit. It's just so you're not actively fraying your rope as you use it.
madlads,feefv8t,t1_feedhf5,1579032909.0,"I buy into that theory too. I'm very curious what kind of parents the kids coming out of school now are going to be over the next decade or so. Rebelling is used almost entirely negatively, but there's definitely some behaviors or structure/lack of structure in probably all of our parents that if we rebelled against we'd be better for it.

Most of it in the US seems to stem from our abysmal education system, too, so a lot of my hope lies in someone actually getting it working properly. At least give the kids the information and logic so they can figure out their own way if they have to."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feeeecx,t1_feeddiz,1579032040.0,I never thought of it from that angle. Makes sense. I've always just preferred talking to people about what they *like* to do and not what they *have* to do. Maybe it's different if you have some objectively interesting job but I don't know a whole lot of people in that position. Even the interesting jobs eventually break down to some routine.
BlackPeopleTwitter,feee1bb,t1_feeb51x,1579031826.0,"I'm that dick that asks people what makes them happy or what they do with their weekends or what they're really into right now. It seems to get people actually excited about what they're talking about. Sometimes that *is* work, which is fine, but you can usually tell the people who are exasperated from being asked about work, speaking from projection."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feedk3d,t1_fee4eoo,1579031543.0,"Most of Reddit isn't more than a few years out of highschool so it's probably a hard thing for those people to really understand what a 10-20-30yr reunion really is to most people.

Spoiler: It's to get drunk and reminisce. Maybe reconnect with people you fell out of contact with."

madlads,feebd42,t1_fee5d68,1579030263.0,"I'd go even more granular than just highschool. By the Jr/Senior level they should be mostly able to not hang themselves with the rope you give them. They need to learn to not do that at some point, at any rate. Freshmen and a lot of Sophomores are basically just taller middle-schoolers as far as general maturity and responsibility goes.

This would all be a different conversation if more parents actually taught their kids accountability in the US, but they largely don't so that's where that puts us, realistically. I've seen much younger kids be extremely mature but that requires they be raised right and not just stuffed full of entitlement and coddled their entire lives."
