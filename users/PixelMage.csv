I want to be on the giving and receiving end of back scratches and massages. I want to hug someone until I'm satisfied or until five minutes have passed, whichever one comes first.  


I want to be poked and tickled and patted. I want to be hugged from the front, I want to be hugged from the back, I want to be hugged from the side, I want to be hugged from above, I want to be hugged from below, I want to be hugged **to my very soul.**  


I want to be allowed to be clingy, and to be clung upon. I am a black hole of loneliness, and a tornado of open arms. I long to befriend someone with nearly as little personal boundaries as I have.  


So, uh, I wouldn't say I'm exactly ""dealing with it,"" but I have a weighted blanket and a big orca plushie in my bed, and I think they both sort of help. I also occasionally get hugs from friends and family, but nowhere near often enough to quench the skin hunger. There is a manic goblin in my brain, and it needs buttloads of serotonin."

The fact that they now have a kid together does not automatically mean that she will change her initially toxic mindset, either. If she continues trying to control the guy or their son, it'll never truly be a happy end.

Hence, if that is the case, if we were to find the earliest source using this version of the title, we could make a list over subsequent people who were too lazy to translate the title themselves and just stole someone else's incorrect homework.

Just a theory."
