[Per my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/el1ew5/february_morocco_looking_for_a_small_organized/)

I'm hoping to do a desert tour starting from Marrakech February 5 and ending up in Fes 3-4 days later. This route comes highly recommended by people I've talked to, and I'm currently booked on a larger shared tour. Private tours seem to be the way to go for a better experience, but they're expensive and lonely if you're going solo! I'd love to either join a private tour of solo travelers or create our own little group.

My choice of vendors currently are either [Marrakech City Life](https://marrakechcitylife.com/), [Camel Excursions](https://camelexcursions.com/), or [Open Doors Morocco](https://opendoorsmorocco.com/). 

So I'm reaching out to see if there are 1-5 travel companions who would like to come with me starting on Feb 5 from Marrakech to Fes, over 3-4 days, through the desert, on a private tour. I'm hoping we can find a good tour around the $5-600 CAD per person range.

I'm a 30yo male Asian-Canadian, hope to hear from you guys!"
