I would recommend Strange the Dreamer (duology) by Laini Taylor for its beautiful, poetic writing style alone. Added bonus that it comes with a good story and lovable characters. However, be advised that it explores the parent-child relationship in some depth. If you want to steer clear, I completely understand. 

So my backup recommendation - The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. It's a fantasy/heist story following some of the most endearing characters ever created. Scott is a master of dialogue writing, presenting humorous banter between the main characters. The book feels voluminous and the writing style is quirky - You keep jumping back and forth between scenes with interludes to explain how the heros learnt something. But you'll get used to it and fall in love with the friendship and brotherhood. And the lies! Oh, the lies of Locke!"
