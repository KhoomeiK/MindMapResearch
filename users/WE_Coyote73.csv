I also agree that the Dem party has fractured into two parties.  I know it's a hard pill to swallow for many, but our only path to success is to go the way of the GOP and back whoever wins the nom, we have to have a united front if you want to win national elections.  Once our people get in then we can address the larger problems and, hopefully, make it so that the GOP will never again have the kind of power they currently possess to keep fucking up the country and her citizens."

Because the far left of the party are into purity tests, if a particular candidate doesn't meet every single one of their demands then they are the enemy.  I think what we're seeing in the Democratic party is the natural progression of campus radicals getting into politics.  Most of the youth have a ""you're either with me or against me"" mentality, they refuse to see the nuances involved in everything from politics at a national level to how to live life as a responsible citizen (i.e. cancel culture)."

Documentaries,ff3yhlr,t1_ff2z5b4,1579551617.0,"I think the problem with the whole ""fat acceptance"" thing is that the message has been muddied by the radical SJWs and instead of focusing on the actual message the media has focused on the radicals.  When the acceptance movement was started it's mission wasn't to encourage people to be fat, stay fat, get fat but rather to love yourself as you are and to not let your body shape define you.  It's hard to lose weight when you are overweight and think you're nothing, that you don't deserve happiness or a good life BECAUSE you are overweight.  The point of the movement was to encourage people to be happy and self-accepting while educating them about healthy living.  But like most good things, it was co-opted by extremists and the message was muddied."

I learned quickly that I was complaining to the wrong person, my sister-in-law was a Computer Engineering major back in the 70s.  After making fun of me for complaining she pointed out how back in her day finding the mistakes in a program meant going through punch cards for hours or days.
