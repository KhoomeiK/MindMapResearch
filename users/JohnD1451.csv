This is how those “gotcha” magazines can make a celebrity look either foolish or amazing, all depending on the story/narrative they’re pushing. They’ll catch them off the movie sets and will use either poor/no editing to decrease the public’s perception of them. I’m not sure if any of that made sense but you get the point"

ForeverAloneDating,ff21grj,t1_ff1qyhp,1579491247.0,"What this fella said. I’m only 19 years old, so I don’t have much life experience to hold, but I dated a girl that I fell for HARD a few months before graduating high school. I went in knowing I liked her a lotttt more than she liked me, so it was bound to crash. But I was heartbroken, and I felt lost. The best thing you can do for yourself is remove everything you have about that person and keep yourself busy. It helps, seriously.

Last, and most importantly, this will take time. It’s been a year since my breakup and I can only cautiously say I’ve moved on. And even then it’s still tough to talk to her. But do not rush this, please."

LetsTalkMusic,fes58cm,t1_ferywbn,1579361513.0,"He shot himself in the foot by releasing Revival after four years of no albums. That was his chance of showing people he still has the potential to dominate the rap game and put a lot of hype around Revival’s release.   

Revival’s sales speak for itself, it is easily the lowest selling album of his, with Kamikaze already about to overtake it in sales (Revival with 1,180,000 and Kamikaze with 1,030,000). It simply wasn’t a good album. Music (especially rap) has experienced a massive change over the last 20 years, where lyrics aren’t the sole factor in whether a song shines or flops. That’s hard on Eminem, since he is mostly a lyrical rapper. 

Additionally, as the other guy stated, the guy has been riding the wave since 1997. He has absolutely solidified himself as a rap legend for decades to come. There’s nothing wrong with the times changing and the culture shifting to favor other artists with different style. It happens to every artist."

The insanity plea [states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/insanity_defense) that the defendant standing trial was not responsible for his or her actions due to an episodic or persistent psychiatric disease.

HomeworkHelp,fem4uer,t3_epvtr0,1579239809.0,"First, you’re going to want that 28x on the other side of that line. A flat line makes a 180 degree angle, so that 28x will turn into a (180-28x). (It stinks that’s it more complicated, but at least it’s on the right side now). 

Okay, so you’ve got your three interior angles. As we know, the angles making up a triangle will always add to 180 degrees. So, you’ll take those three points and equal them to 180. From that work with the 28x, we now have a 180 and both sides of the equation, so those will cancel out. 

Now you’re just left with (16x-28x+48)=0. 

From there, you’ll just solve for X. I hope this helped."

ReasonableFaith,fdr9x9s,t1_fdr73pk,1578681553.0,"But exactly that’s my point, it’s not evidence + evidence. Kalam only uses a cause and effect argument to gain its conclusion. It states “Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, therefor it has a cause”. There is no direct piece of evidence that states God made our universe. It simply states that it has a cause. 

The concrete definition for evidence states “The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.” There is no physical proof or information that validates His existence.

Although I firmly believe He exists, not I nor anyone else has direct data or evidence that he is in existence.

Also your statement that scientific theories are reliant on arguments is only partially true. A scientific theory has to be an explanation that can be repeatedly tested and verified. From my perspective, that’s not the case with any of the arguments you provided."
