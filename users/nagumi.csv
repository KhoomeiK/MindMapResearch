The dosages aren't set... if you give too much sedative you can cause nasty side effects, but too little and the pet won't be sedated enough for the heart-stopping chemical (pentobarbital generally). The dosages change based on lots of factors, some of which are predictable (weight, sex), some which aren't (general health, cardiac function, blood pressure, etc) and have to be changed on the fly. It's extremely common for a vet to give the sedative and then give some more after 10 minutes, or to give the pental and find that the heart doesn't stop or starts again after a minute (rarer). From what I understand, executioners want a way to attach an IV and then just press a button and walk out of the room. At least in veterinary medicine, it just doesn't work like that. Hell, it's extremely rare but we've even had animals wake up after being euthanized. We're all animal lovers and it's traumatic for everyone."

Important to note is that in our language you indicate the gender of the person you're speaking to. So if I say ""you know what I mean"" then the word ""you"" will be a bit different depending on the gender of the person I'm speaking with. There is no simple way to speak without indicating your own gender as well (you can do it but the wording gets convoluted). Man why did I type all this at 11:30pm."

Put a collar on them, and tighten it (not so tight that it causes discomfort, but not loose). Put a nametag on it with multiple phone numbers. If you don't have an engraved nametag, get some transparent tape (sellotape) like you might use to seal an envelope, about 1cm-1.5cm wide. Get a small strip of paper about 3-5cm long and not as wide as the tape. Write the phone numbers on either side of the paper and place the paper on the sticky side of the tape so that clear tape surrounds the paper. Fold the paper over with the collar ring in the middle so that the paper is laminated. I drew this up for you: **https://imgur.com/a/o8dju3V**

I once read the entire 50 page indictment... it was just a page turner. I'm not even a lawyer, it was just insane reading. My summary:

Well, uh, apparently Waterparks can be risky. Honestly...

Highschool dropout with no formal training is chief designer of world's tallest and fastest waterside.

During testing phase some of the rafts go airborne

They install steel bars holding up netting within the flight path of the rafts

The designer says that he's gonna rewrite the national and international standards that amusement park rides are made with

Dozens of reports from employees come in about problems and concerns and injuries

People are regularly injured due to the airborne rafts. People are told never to lift their arms above their heads because of the steel bars.

People are also injured by the way the rafts are stopped at the end, by slamming into a concrete wall

The only seat belts are velcro. These are never replaced and soon stop to hold people in their seats. 

Man on ride has seat belt fall off, braces himself in the seat, when the ride hits the concrete wall he breaks two toes. While laying on the grass next to the ride, man matching description of ride designer comes over and brags about designing the ride, saying he's gonna build an even bigger one. He doesn't acknowledge or seem to notice the man with broken bones in front of him. This is within minutes of the man breaking his toes on the ride

Many more insane things happen. A bunch of people have spinal damage, whiplash, concussions, et cetera

Because the ride was never maintained, it starts to fall apart within 2 years (6 operational months total).

The slowing brakes fail repeatedly. The ride continues to operate.

Many rafts are held together by duct tape.

Engineer declares the ride should immediately be shut down for repairs. Nope. Brakes stay offline. This is a dew days before... 

10 year old boy is decapitated when his head hits one of the steel bars when the raft (one that specifically had been reported by employees to be consistently going too fast and going airborne) goes airborne. His two riding companions are badly injured. 

Ride designer hides evidence, including thousands of end of shift reports and dozens of incident reports. He coerced employees to rewrite incident reports (this apparently happened regularly over years) 

Designer's attorney goes to whistle blowing lifeguard (a minor) and asks for the police report she gave. Her mother says no. The attorney calls the police detective and tells him that the mother authorized release of the report. Detective says no. While mother is on the phone with detective, mother gets an sms from attorney saying detective authorized her giving attorney the police report. This all happens over like half an hour.

There's more. This was from memory. I got the bones of it though.



EDIT: It looks like litigation is still ongoing. Still unclear what'll happen with the criminal charges."
