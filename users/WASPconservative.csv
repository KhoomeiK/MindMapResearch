facepalm,ff3l1jp,t1_ff3ibiw,1579543312.0,Thank you! I will not let others get to me.  I chose my username to be deliberately inflammatory.  I enjoy reddit because the predominant worldview on here is contrarian to mine. It helps me keep myself honest.
facepalm,ff3kva2,t1_ff3kbuz,1579543205.0,It is also pretty rigorously documented. The article I quoted has over 140 references.
facepalm,ff3hyut,t1_ff3d9ff,1579541432.0,"Again, I beseech you to read what is written not what you want to read.  I didn’t say the fires were normal.  I said the temperature and rainfall are normal.  The fires were not normal.  They were caused by arson. 

The worst Australian wildfires in recorded history happened in 1939.  

The hottest recorded temperature in Australia occurred in 1909

A fool uses fear mongering and emotional reactions to dictate policy.  We as a society should be using data. I am strongly in favor of reducing carbon emissions.  But, the sadness of these fires is not a reason why."

worldnews,ff38g22,t1_ff36hh4,1579536155.0,"I used to be quite flexible.  Have you ever had a prostate check though? If a finger isn’t pleasant, imagine the pain I must be in.  

If you gave 1 million workers a one dollar per hour raise, it would cost 2 billion dollars a year. (40 hours a week X 52 weeks per year X 1,000,000 workers).  Obviously, that number isn’t fully accurate because Walmart has both full time and part time workers, but the principle is that same.  A billion dollars is not a lot of money for a company that size."
facepalm,ff361vd,t1_ff34ug7,1579534538.0,"You’ll notice I didn’t say the wildfires were not incredibly sad.  

“Bushfires in Australia are a widespread and regular occurrence that have contributed significantly to moulding the nature of the continent over millions of years.”

That’s probably from a right wing website right? Nope.  Wikipedia. 

Blaming the wrong thing will get us nowhere. Truth matters.  Climate change exists.  But there is no evidence that it contributed to what happened in Australia."
worldnews,ff32xwl,t1_ff299ci,1579532306.0,You make it sound like these workers are slaves.   They choose to work at Walmart.
facepalm,ff2wb4r,t1_ff2vu61,1579526594.0,"The temperature and rainfall in Australia are at historically normal levels.   Climate change exists, but not every natural disaster can be attributed to it.   It is dangerous to attribute something to climate change without evidence, because it gives climate change deniers credibility."

Just kidding."
facepalm,fev6mjw,t1_feuac1v,1579393710.0,"Looks like around AD 80 is the estimate.  Jesus death was somewhere around AD 33. The disciples were likely in their late teens to early 20s.  Couldn’t they have pretty easily still been alive?

Edit: late teens to early 20s at the start of Jesus ministry"
facepalm,feu6z3v,t3_eqgbr4,1579383749.0,"What am I missing? The gospels were written by first person eye witnesses.

Libertarian,fek9ooa,t1_fejresp,1579195515.0,"This is a reddit first for me.  I appreciate you because it only took me asking you to explain your comment for you to change your claim from saying it is “Not true at all” to admitting there may be some truth to it.  

We both made claims. Mine was that tax cuts generate money by stimulating the economy.  Your claim was that there was no truth to my claim.   If there is a burden based on making a claim, we share it equally. 

When individuals have more of their own money, they spend more of their money which both generates sales tax and increases corporation revenue which is taxed.  When corporations have more money, they create jobs to keep up with growth.  The individuals that work those jobs then pay income tax."
Libertarian,fejkuqh,t1_feirk6p,1579178295.0,That is interesting.  I did not intend that to be a controversial comment. Do tell.

AskReddit,fdp4189,t1_fdoxr54,1578619488.0,I’m wondering if the current democratic candidates will significantly tone done their rhetoric and move toward moderate once the nomination is secure. Lean left to get the nomination then come back toward the middle to catch the masses of Americans who think Trump is a moron but that socialism and taking joy in killing babies is even worse.

science,fcxco1m,t1_fcx01f8,1578059310.0,"Too much data there to be cherry picked.  That is just an article, but they have an entire section on climate change. But yes, the web site does selectively choose topics where the evidence benefits a conservative agenda. 

FYI, I believe in man made climate change and feel we should make changes to address.  Pseudoscientific modeling nonsense drives me crazy though because it gives right winged people ammo to not believe."
