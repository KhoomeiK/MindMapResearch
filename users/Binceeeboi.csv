offmychest,fc4ujgc,t3_efxe7a,1577428970.0,"Totally different but same feels

Me 20F, I like rock music, Marvel comics and films, I often cuss, my wardrobes basically all black but I'm not emo/Gothic/depressed or something (not hatin on anyone here like this), curently my hair is dyed pink and people have told me that I have a RBF, boyish, rough-ish vibe, if that makes sense, and yeahh I don't care sometimes about these stuff but 
when I ask my guy friends whenever I have boy problems (not often) they're defacto advice would always be that
'you should wear more femine clothes,.. wear make up, change how you dress, wear a dress'
HAHAHA and it's just makes me laugh and kinda frustrated.. man I love my guy friends really but imagine if majority of the male population would only think this way.. like fuck dudes

We girls can be as fuckin smart, strong, rough etc. as much as anything that you men prolly  boast about each other in your solidity groups

and AMEN TO YOUR POST!! 
like sometimes other girls feel inferior about these stuff coz maybe they actually enjoy doing girly things and that's not something weak or yeah the term 'girly' at all.. It's just you and that's you, what's wrong about that?  
and the 'exceptional' because we're like not other girls.. this just proves that there really is a one standard that has been naturally conditioned in people's mind when it comes to women"

introvert,fc4ki23,t3_efy60f,1577419330.0,"Oh god, preachhh it.

My cousins already label me as weird and introverted and I proudly claim to be both but it's like they have this 'look' in their eyes or I kinda feel like they don't know how to deal with me or that I'm a killjoy..
I feel guilty at times but I know in myself that that's who I am and that it's not something I can magically change whenever there's a social event/situation that I NEED to be involved in or whatever.
I love my cousins tho, I'm just the type to laugh and hear their stories out whenever we get together not the one with the loud voice that's near exclaiming already.

My approach in situations like this is always to maybe think before I speak, I like to take in as much as what the people/situation is giving me before I make a comment myself or start to voice out myself"

Crushes,fc2mgda,t3_ee32ri,1577367065.0,"I noticed you first because you made the initiative to take charge in arranging our class alphabetically, and I didn't even have a crush on you then I just thought deymm this guy has some balls, it was like the 3rd meeting, we were very new to the class and then boom, you go with your booming voice directing people where to go
and then WE GOT TO BE SEATMATES yeyyy in that class and I froze up the following meetings, I wouldn't even look. at you

My favorite part of you is your English accent (not a native speaker), every damn time you talk in our class wooooo.. *fans myself..
I like how you always bring a water bottle, it's kinda cute  and you refill it too and your eyes even tho they're normal brown, I only got to stare at it when we had that conversation in the library when you wanted to share this informative video about our lesson and that you repeat you're outfits or I guess6you have a preferred day to wear your gray shirt haha

We're not yet close but I'm hoping nxt year , after we come back from break that could change

My favorite Christmas Song is ""Last Christmas"""
offmychest,fc2kz8i,t3_efueyh,1577365385.0,"Heyy, I'm speaking based on my experience and maybe it doesn't really relate to yours but I felt like this, like suddenly starting to feel low when I realized I wasn't appreciated enough, not to be narcissistic but I felt like my efforts, and like my energy wasn't really reciprocated like yeah I have friends before not a lot, that like considered me as responsible and yeah with the 'will to do things' and in the loong run,
I think 'burned out' is the term they used but yeah

like my energy/the environment I'm exerting this effort/passion wasn't bouncing it back to me, basically I felt kinda used in some way but maybe that's just me thinking negatively

I decided to change my outlook a bit and my standards, like I'd say No to stuff (not a lot) that I felt like were heading the same direction as I experienced before and started like exploring myself more, 

like why did I do this in the first place (maybe for you, this could be the hobby that turned into work you talked about), and that once I really thought of this thoroughly like "" Am I doing this for others sake or is there actually a genuine deep purpose for this? ',
stuff like that

Hope this somehow made sense and helped? If not, I hope you find someone you can talk to about this"

Do you have a class with her? 
coz like me, I only have one class with my crush, so sadd

you should strike up a conversation with her..
You said you've observed her rightt? maybe you noticed stuff that could be a potential conversation topic or something

I do this when I try to get to know a person, personally I'm a people watcher myself.."

I asked a friend once cos I knda found a video of his dad preaching and my friend described his dad as a ' cranky pastor' based on the video alone but I always give people the benefit of the doubt and I'm not hatin on pastors really

but Thank youu for ur reply üòä"

Crushes,fbzmdvc,t3_efanwx,1577251672.0,"Hiii, this is cute by the way hehe. 

Ummm idk if this will make sense or help but I went through something similar I suggest you try separate /or not put him on a pedestal (we can't avoid this tho) and like try to see him as an individual like normally.. 

It's the expectations that result in this, like we don't wnna seem weird or maybe let them think we're not cool enough, like trynna impress them and things like that.. 

But the beginning stages, of what you're going through usually settle the more time you interact with him. 

Hope this helpsüòÖ"
Crushes,fbzl306,t1_fbxgy0g,1577250336.0,"Hahahaha me too, 

Oh youu heard her say that? That she doesn like you?

Im personally not so confident too, thats why Im also debatng on trying harder to get close to my crush but its always a risk man.. Its always a risk"

Your nmber 3 suggestion is just wow, I'm kind of an introvert that's why in the in the 1st place I was so intimidated by him..

But Thank youuu for your replyy, appreciate it mate‚ò∫Ô∏è"
