Dupes will always be apart of the game no matter what. No one can change that, ever. It gets you to play more, just what ubi wants."
Rainbow6,ffedw4u,t1_ffednw3,1579844407.0,Then stop replying if you don't agree.
Rainbow6,ffedttg,t1_ffedj0l,1579844343.0,That's why they are rare. So you have to keep playing to get them. Just don't worry about it and play the game or save up renown and buy packs (the better option). So no dupes are fine. The rarity also make some skins very unique such as game face headgear for twitch. You can't sell skins for money like in CSGO so having a very rare chance along with the chance for dupes the is fine.
SuicideWatch,ffebbq2,t1_ffeb8yy,1579842005.0,I used to feel the same way. Best thing to do is to spend a lot of time with people you trust such as close family or friends. Next thing to do would be to remind yourself that your only human and you can't control all elements of your life.
