aspergers,fdon675,t3_em0g35,1578608561.0,"I was the same way. Here are some things I have learned.

Humans are a tribal species. As such we build hierarchies in every group were in. Certain behavior is inherent to high status members and some is for low status people. If people have somehow learned to behave like low status people only they will subconsciously be telling new groups that they're a low status, or weak, person. This is how I see it, though it will be controversial for some.

What I see as high status behavior/traits.:
- Well liked by many
- Owns actions that would otherwise seem stupid, silly etc. Basically not give a fuck. Hard to upset.
- Self sufficiency, non-needy behavior. I'd call it outcome independence
- Not approval seeking
- Proficiency in skill(s)
- Good social skills
- Able to say no without feeling bad
- Sets boundaries

This is just off the top of my head. Consider these points. Low status behavior would be the opposite of them.

Now to answer your question more directly:

I used to be a people pleaser. I would try to please people even if it was at my own expense. I thought this is how you made people like you. It actually did the opposite. If you think of human relations in terms of supply and demand, a person who gives away their resources for free must not have anything of worth. They might also have ulterior motives. I used to do things because I depended on people's positive feedback for validation. This meant that I wasn't actually giving my resources away, I was making a transaction but not disclosing the price. Aka a covert contract.
If you only give your resources away in a quid-quo-pro manner you will gain more respect. This obviously doesn't apply to close friends and such.

I also used to think I was an asshole if I said no to people. I've since learned that being able to is a perfectly fine thing to do, and it will in fact make people (and you yourself) respect you more. This is also a way of setting boundaries. If people feel they can step all over you for no reason, that's bad. This is weakness. It's like a country with no police.

Hope this is of any use."
