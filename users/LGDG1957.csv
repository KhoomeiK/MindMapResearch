Louisiana,feirt61,t3_ep21dj,1579145586.0,There are banks everywhere.  They keep building new banks. You'd swear we were all rich by the banks. Haha!

Louisiana,febrn6m,t3_eo71kl,1578961907.0,"I live in Hammond Louisiana.  We have an excellent university right around the corner from my apartment.  There are lots of sports going on with the university,  Hammond is growing so much. New businesses are being built.  When I moved here in 2009 it was a nice town but in the last 9 years it has so much new business also the medical field is good here too. Lots of fishing places in Independence, Tickfaw & Amite."

90DayFiance,fdnqpvo,t3_em45za,1578591010.0,Out of sight out of mind that's Tania's philosophy.  So she can do whatever with whoever and it doesn't matter.  I think Syngin has morals and Tania doesn't.
90DayFiance,fdk1zuj,t3_elgj8x,1578494085.0,I think Alexy and Loren are one of the only couples who married for love and not a green card. You can tell they truly love each other and their families too.  Alexis family is so sweet. He has a good relationship especially with his younger brother. ‚ù§
90DayFiance,fde2voh,t3_ekrafx,1578329955.0,Don't know what's so special about him. I don't find him attractive at all.
90DayFiance,fdczven,t1_fdbrn6r,1578289371.0,People on Facebook are snarky.
90DayFiance,fd62m0f,t3_ejx7hx,1578184693.0,"My daughter is engaged to someone who isn't a Christian.  I would prefer if he was but I'm ok with it.  We don't talk about it.  I like him, his mom, aunts etc. Don't care for his dad cause he was abusive to them. They are getting married in May.  üòä"
90DayFiance,fd0pzdr,t3_ejqmik,1578122195.0,My ex husband was from Slovenia and he thought when he came to America there were people standing at the airport runway  passing out thousands of dollars to everyone getting off plane.
aww,fd0nfkl,t3_ejpdnc,1578121230.0,You are so lucky

90DayFiance,fctk63u,t3_eio8id,1577946192.0,Syngin and Tania
90DayFiance,fcs8qmg,t3_ehxnkg,1577913037.0,Personally I don't think she's there to learn anything about herbal remedies. She there for vacation and to get away from Syngin. She goes from one idea to another never completing anything she starts. Her mother should have taught her better values and morals.
cats,fcb99g7,t3_egbld0,1577584023.0,He's so cute. Give him some snuggles for me.
cats,fc4v7wv,t3_efv51j,1577429754.0,She looks exactly like my cat we lost in hurricane Katrina.  Even the different colored eyes! I miss Baby.
