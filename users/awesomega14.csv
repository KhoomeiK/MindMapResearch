csMajors,fewe858,t1_fewdr2r,1579409122.0,"> To get into Google, you need to be able to solve leetcode medium-hard.

I think it's a little bit more complicated than that.  Google's acceptance rate is 0.2%. I don't think only 0.2% of people can do leetcode."
csMajors,fevwljy,t1_fevuggg,1579402362.0,"I understand why someone would want to be in such a prestigious company, but I just don't understand why everyone thinks they have a realistic chance. Those companies obviously don't become so glamorous and alluring by just letting anyone in."
csMajors,fevbty1,t1_fev776g,1579395531.0,Applying to 100 and only getting one interview is actually fairly good for a freshman. Most seniors send out even more than that and get fewer interviews.
csMajors,fev0b6w,t1_feuxzx1,1579391730.0,"I mean yeah, leetcode is used in most interviews, but it's also not the sole factor they use to evaluate potential employees. There's also GPA, which university you went to, past job experience, projects, etc. I don't go to a particularly prestigious university, nor do I have an outstanding GPA, so I don't particularly feel competitive among the geniuses from Stanford/MIT/Harvard that I would be competing with for jobs."
csMajors,feuwvqw,t1_feuuqh7,1579390759.0,"Yeah, it's reasonable to want to do as well as possible in your career, but it seems a little naive for everyone to think they can get into such exclusive companies. I go to a relatively un-prestigious state university and yet everyone thinks they have a chance at the most prestigious companies in the country.  My philosophy has just been that if I couldn't get into an Ivy League, then I probably can't get into Google."

EngineeringStudents,fenwegg,t1_fent7yj,1579291843.0,"I mean, exercise is mainly a leisure activity that does not really contribute to anything significantly."
EngineeringStudents,fenpm7b,t1_fenklf8,1579289003.0,Is it productive? I would feel guilty if I spent too much time not focusing on schoolwork like that. I would be concerned about the effects taking part in too many leisure activities like that might have on my GPA.

ExplainMyDownvotes,fe2hy6m,t1_fe2gnv4,1578838498.0,"I mean, it’s cool to disagree with someone, but that doesn’t explain why my comment has more than 80 downvotes. And the reply even agreed with me to an extent (that it’s understandable to have such an opinion if you’re just “working to live” rather than “living to work”)."
college,fe2d4d5,t1_fe0gmo6,1578837066.0,"How do I have unique experiences if I have to spend the rest of my life going to work every day? And I can’t do it now because I’m constantly swamped with work and barely even have time to pass all of my classes.

Are you sure? The modern economy being like it is doesn’t exactly support people who are overly ambitious like that. I think that you, in fact, may be the boomer in this situation."

starterpacks,fd4ju42,t1_fd3zmo5,1578168187.0,I don’t think acknowledging opportunities you had that others may not have is diminishing your own accomplishments at all. It’s merely being humble and respectful of people that are worse off than yourself.

ABoringDystopia,fczgpno,t1_fcz9bg2,1578100868.0,What’s even worse is that people will adamantly defend the system and claim that anything else is Socialism. People would rather pay more money than they have to and get less health coverage as long as the money they’re paying is going to a corporation instead of the government.
DaystromInstitute,fcxigcl,t1_fcwuld7,1578063737.0,"Long ago, a storm was heading for the city of Quin'lat. Everyone took protection within the walls except one man who remained outside. Kahless went to him and asked what he was doing. ""I am not afraid,"" the man said. ""I will not hide my face behind stone and mortar. I will stand before the wind and make it respect me."" Kahless honored his choice and went back inside. The next day, the storm came, and the man was killed. Kahless replied, ""The wind does not respect a fool""."
forwardsfromgrandma,fcxi1z2,t1_fcx1r93,1578063452.0,Americans naturally have a huge fetish for war and combat even when they’ve probably never been in the Military in their lives and would be scared shitless in an actual life-threatening situation. It’s the same reason everyone was threatening to start a civil war if Trump was impeached (which of course never happened).

People have been saying ""Technology can't possibly do this/that"" for centuries. ""Humans will never be able to fly"" or ""We will never be able to send anything into space."" It is going to take a long time, but I don't see why we can't design machines to think like humans. There's a lot of research going into Artificial General Intelligence at the moment."

aggies,fc4bvik,t1_fc47zoc,1577412189.0,"I would probably add previous job experience and projects to that. Most people I’ve heard of who tend to get internships also tend to have a lot of previous relevant job experience and things they’ve worked on. I’m not really certain if grades even matter, it’s just like a higher GPA prevents your resume from being thrown out automatically."
