\>   The modifiable parts won't be computer generated

Irrelevant. You're not understanding what I'm trying to tell you. You need to investigate the costs of outsourcing or running a dedicated server before you begin work.

\>  too early in the project

This is EXACTLY the point in the project you need to investigate and understand the options available to you for hosting. Your game will only work with a dedicated server servicing all your clients. It's not like typical multiplayer games where online servers can be an afterthought and if it doesn't work out, you can do peer to peer. Your game will not function as a peer to peer game, thus you NEED to look into server hosting. Find out how much it will cost you for 1 player vs 1000 vs 10 000 vs 100 000 vs 1 000 000. Find out what your expenses are going to be so you can think about how you're going to monetise this game. If it's free to play, which it sounds like it will be since I cannot see this being successful as a pay to play, you need to consider the server costs of 2 paying players vs 998 freeloaders costing you money. There are studies showing only 2% of F2P players pay any money at all, how will you cope with server costs for 1000 players if you're only receiving a small amount of money from two of them?"
underlords,ffc1g78,t1_ffc0l0q,1579789118.0,"Tusk wouldn't increase the chance by himself. If you had pudge and slardar and THEN you bought Tusk, then you'd increase the chance of warrior items. It'd work using the same system as Ace units. They get an increased chance of appearing based on alliance level. A similar thing would apply to items.

Putting it in a vacuum. Let's say there are only two level 3 items. MoM and Octarine Essence. You will get offered one of them and two tier two items. Say Mask of Madness would be tied to Assassins and Hunters. Octarine Essence would be tied to Mages and Warlocks. At base level, there is a 50% chance for either.

If you're running Assassins, MoM would now have a 60% chance of being offered, conversely Octarine Essence now only has a 40% chance of being offered.

If you're running Warriors, both would still be a 50% chance of being offered.

It's still only a percentile system, like the current one, but weighted in favour of the alliances you are currently running. All this will do is make situations where you're offered MoM as your only T3 item and two mediocre T2 items when you're running Mages less prominent.

Or, for a worse scenario I've personally encountered, Aeon Disk, Dagon, Scythe of Vyse when running 6 hunters. Lessening that situation is the end goal of this proposal."

underlords,ffbxgnw,t1_ffbud5g,1579785915.0,"Look at the evidence:

* He had a bad comp with few complete alliances.
* His comp was mostly upgraded i.e. not likely to improve - selling would lose gold.
* He quit just before he received the defeat message that would drop him to 1 heart.
* He only managed to kill two of my units during the fight
* There were only five players left, most of the rest had two hearts, with two of them on win streaks.

Sure, it is possible it was an unlucky DC - but it's very unlikely. It's far more likely he left the game to start another round rather than sitting out what he must have thought was an inevitable loss the next round.

But bigbrains want to feel smart, and so ""how can you just assume he ragequit"" becomes the mantra.

> when you start attacking people you're gonna lose support

Good joke. I didn't attack anyone, but I've been downvoted to oblivion by people who clearly think I'm dumb for assuming he qqed. I don't believe I have any support here, given the comments. Reddit is well known for mob mentality, where people just follow the general train as though it were correct.

I posted this with the intent of spreading a positive message: Don't give up even if you feel like you're losing badly, you never know how the game is going to go given the amount of RNG inherent to it. But now it's been hijacked into ""lol, don't just assume someone rage quit even though all the evidence leans in favour of this being a ragequit rather than a general DC."""

AskAChristian,ffbl4v6,t3_esqclp,1579770623.0,">How did Catholic Church looked at marriage throughout history?

I can't answer that as it's far too broad a question. Can you specify a time period? We don't know all that much about the church's view on marriage before the 8th/9th century.

>In 1900s when love and affection became the important part of getting married, was the Church satisfied with that?

Love and affection have always been an important aspect of getting married in the western world. You're thinking of the aristocracy who had much stricter arranged marriages, often loveless. Remember, there are very different levels of arranged marriage. Marriages were usually arranged between families that were friends - people you'd know well and generally like. Your childhood sweetheart would very likely to be the one you were arranged for.

Lol what? During this time period of 500-1000 years they had the wealthiest peasants. I don't even know where to begin to unpack this lack of knowledge.

\> It didn't even get cheap for the Dutch

It wasn't cheap, peasants could still splurge for it. You seem to have this view that people lived in the mud and never spent or traded for finer things.

\>  ""colonized""  or ""genocided""

Putting those together is incredibly disingenuous. Coen genocided the population of Banda after a revolt. You can definitely criticise that all you like. The islands had been colonised for over 100 years at that point."

Salt, butter, sweet basil, chives, honey, dill, sage, mustard, parsley, anise, caraway, mint, fennel, vinegar, verjuice, almond milk, nutmeg(imported), and mace(imported) would all be very common spices in any home, even lowly poor farmers.

If you had any means at all, it is very likely you'd be eating imported spices like pepper, galangal, cardamom, long pepper, saffron, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and coriander.

underlords,felzplo,t1_felzimy,1579235177.0,"No, the argument is that druids shouldn't have two tier 1 units. It causes a ridiculous power spike before round 5 that doesn't give you a win streak, but merely ends other win streaks. Not fun for anyone. It'd be better if one of them was tier 2, with stats to match, that could be more impactful. I'd prefer to see enchant's stats go up a bit and be tier 2 than SS though.

Examples: critical strikes, slows on enemies, lifesteal etc.

Negative things should always require skill to avoid, or simply be consistent so a player can learn how to interact with that negative effect.

Examples: Enemies poison on every attack, enemies always deal double damage on second attack, enemies always regenerate life if you block their attack.

In other words: Something beneficial can occur at random, and give a pleasant surprise. Something negative should surprise the player with the first instance, confuse them with the second, and bring understanding with the third."

Here are two example sentences with all the Germanic words in bold.

**I had to give five hundred to the shop to mend the window on my truck.** <- 100% germanic.

**I had to** pay money **to the** repairman **to** repair **the** aperture **on my** car\*\*.\*\* <- 40% latin.

Something like 90% of your spoken English every day is Germanic. THAT is why it's considered Germanic.

Interesting to note, I thought mechanic was germanic as it appears in Afrikaans - it was a trick as it is actually a Greek word, which is why it is present in most European languages."

AskAChristian,fdmxx0z,t3_em7owh,1578570719.0,"The symbolism comes from external source for the most part - not the bible. Obviously there is a source to the symbolism, but it is so old as to not be well recorded why they are associated with those colours. All of this symbolism predates Christianity though. The animals are a bit more obvious.

* Snake - Envy
* Toad - Greed
* Lion - Wrath
* Snail - Sloth
* Goat - Lust
* Pig - Gluttony
* Peacock - Pride

I do not know the origins for the Snake. However, I do know that the dog was also used to represent envy, which is where we get the expression dog in the manger from as dogs frequently display envy and jealousy.

I do not know the origins for the toad, but the toad has almost always been a symbol for greed or wealth.

The lion being associated with wrath probably comes from being associated with strength and physical prowess. Wrath is a fairly obvious lead on from those, as wrath was used to mean killing anger before we softened it.

Snail is obvious.

Goat comes from Greek mythology. Satyrs were half goat-men who were very lustful.

Pig is obvious.

Peacock is obvious."

todayilearned,fdmhg25,t1_fdlxkj3,1578550029.0,"Face, neck and hand tattoos are no good. Anywhere you can't cover the tattoo if needed.

Getting a tattoo is typically a decision you make when you are young and dumb, and even if you have no issues with tattoos - do you really think you're going to like the same stuff you did at 18 as you do at 65?

Most people who get tattoos do it because they want to be ""cool"", ""quirky"", ""rebellious"", or ""fit in"". My parents gave me the best advice ever when I wanted a tattoo. They told me to get one of those sticker tats and wear that for an entire year, replacing it every time it started to wear. If I did that, then I could get the tat. I got bored with it after a month.

Anyone who wants to argue that face tats are good and you should go ahead and get one - imagine you get a DUI and now have to show up to court with your face covered in tats. Do you think the judge is going to look favourably on you? Or do you think they're going to lump you in with ""criminal gang scum""? If you must get a tat, get it on your back, upper arm, or chest. Be sensible."

Hex is read left to right as RR GG BB. It is in base 16 so use a hexadecimal converter to convert them to decimal if you can't read hex.

Edit:

So 808080 is 128 red, 128 green, 128 blue. 128/255 = 50.2%, so it's 50.2% red, 50.2% green, and 50.2% blue. It is grey.

FFFFFF is 255 red, 255 green, 255 blue - or 255/255 = 100%. So it is white.

000000 is black.

FF0000 is red

00FF00 is lime

0000FF is blue.

 62614C is 98, 97, 76 and  50503E is 80, 80, 62.

They racked up something like 70 kills on him before getting knocked out. Unfortunately that player was an idiot and tried to do full bloodbound. If they had done scrappy+BS they probably would have absolutely wrecked face. I think they were knocked out 6th. 8th place dced and 7th place went for an off-meta knights build. But I got all the abbadons and batriders, and assassin's picked up the DKs and Svens so they did not have a good game as they tried to transition to scrappies. I find knights are only viable if you're completely uncontested.

I always picked damage items in this build, given I was massively amplifying damage and knew I was going for troll buff early. Savages player picked up a BKB for their main carry, and scrappies had Pipe of Insight towards the end. Not sure if they were just the best choices they were offered, or if they were that scared of the mage build. I just remember those two because I found it surprising. I think I mentioned in my run down that the assassin's player was running double DK, double moonshards. Double DK moonshard was very effective for dishing out damage."

I had a long argument with another loon about this. The media is comparing the REVISED budget from 2018/2019 with the INITIAL budget from 2019/2020. That's a nono. You need to compare the INITIAL budget from 2018/2019 with the INITIAL budget from 2019/2020 as that is prediction of how much money they will spend that year. As soon as you do that, the entire narrative falls apart - since the budget was increased by 45m.

I'll post my research below.

This is nonsense and needs to stop being spread around.

Go [check](https://www.budget.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/budget-2018-06/Budget_Paper_3-Budget%20Estimates-Budget_201819.pdf) for [yourself](https://www.budget.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/budget-2019-06/Budget_Paper_3-Budget_Estimates-Budget_201920.pdf) and stop listening to MSM spreading their lies. Page 183 for 2018/2019 and page 237 for 2019/2020.

||2017/2018|2018/2019|2019/2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Initial Budget|709,570,000|729,047,000|774,256,000|
|Revised|719,570,000|787,195,000|N/A|
|Projected|729,047,000|774,256,000|N/A|

Follow the train of events.

In 2017/2018 they had a budget of 709m, and they increased it to 719m (10m overspending). They projected the budget for 2018/2019 to be 729m.

In 2018/2019 they had a budget of 729m, and they increased it to 787m (58m overspending). They projected the budget for 2019/2020 to be 774m.

Notice that flipping massive jump there? There was never a cut to the budget. The budget overspent by 58m due to additional asset purchases, and so the conservative government **INCREASED** the budget for the following year by 45m.

But no, we're going to pretend there was a cut to the budget and then lie about it all day on MSM.

Edit:

When you get into the nitty gritty, you'll discover that last year - all fire departments and parklands with potential risk received an absolutely massive amount of additional funds to upgrade their assets and properties. I can post all that info as well if you'd like, or you can just review it yourself on both of the budgets I posted."

todayilearned,fdc5gkv,t1_fd9dr4m,1578267476.0,"CPG does a very disengenious thing here. Copyright before 1911 did not cover all that it does today - it only covered written works. It consisted of two periods of 14 years, with the first period able to be sold.

The original intent of copyright law was to protect the author's earnings whilst they were alive.

The original copyright law (1710) was put into place because people were stealing the works of other authors, causing some to become poor even while their work was popular. The idea behind the 28 year copyright was such that the author had enough time to create their content and enjoy it's earnings whilst they were alive. But it wasn't very effective, and people were stealing works and selling them in other countries.

1842 saw the correction to what I consider the best copyright coverage law. Copyright would last for the author's life + 7 years. If this time would be less than 42 years, then the copyright would persist for 42 years regardless of the death of its author. This is also where copyright became personal property and capable of bequest. This still only covered books. Nothing else.

1911 saw copyright cover life + 50 years. This is where things went off the rails IMO. Since then it has been increased a total of three different times to the ridiculous life+75 years, which is basically 2 lifetimes.

CPG is whinging that ""he's made all his money"" about a VERY successful piece of IP. Not everyone's IP is even remotely as successful as Lucas'. Most people rely on the earnings of their work to sustain them all throughout life, even though it isn't much. Arguing that we should go back to the 28 year copyright is ludicrous. How would you like it if you write a mildly successful book at 20 years of age, then at 48 you stop getting any of that income stream. Even worse, if it suddenly takes off 30 years later, when you're 50, and they make a movie of it. Now you get nothing, and will die poor despite someone else making millions off it.

I do fully agree with his point about benefiting after death, hence my proposal that we turn the time back to the 1842 copyright law which IMO has the fairest time period of all of them."
