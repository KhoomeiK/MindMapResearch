There are a lot of books on trading systems that tell you when to buy and when to not buy, by looking at price charts, but I suggest you skip over, because these are useless and often contradictory and subjective. But if you do want to read a few ""technical trading"" books, you should only think of them as the passage to teach you how to read price charts instead of something you must follow for trading.

After years and years of trading in stocks, forex and options, I can give you the best of my advice: Trading is pure speculation. If you believe the company has good future and that it isn't too overpriced, that you have all the concrete numbers backing you up, it's a good bet. If you buy purely based on guess and creed, trading can quickly become gambling, and this quickly turns to a total disaster financially. Don't trade just to get the losses back, just like you don't add fuel to the burning fire."

Actually, multi instances of something sounds crazy but it is not. A web server will normally spin many processes anyway. With Docker, you're just spinning up multiple instances of different binaries instead one binary. 

If you don't need multiple versions, you can take advantage of Docker for rapid deployments. Docker image is basically a portable version of the program you can just copy and run. There's no dangling libraries installed on the host system. Like now, I have 20 different services on one box. If one service becomes popular and resource intensive, I can just move the docker container to another server in less than 10 mins. If the server dies, I can move all services and the data to a new server in 30 minutes. You don't have to worry about installing the old OS either. Docker containers will run just fine irrespective of your host OS."
selfhosted,fdvoxbu,t3_en5wvl,1578749861.0,"Docker is really easy. Think of Docker container as a running VM instance that is much more efficient than a full blown VM, because a Docker container always shares the host kernel. Docker only isolates storage, networking and environment variables, so basically it's a sandboxed environment for the binaries to run. You can do whatever you want inside a Docker container and it's not going to screw up the host system (mind you, there are always security vulnerabilities that allow malicious code to break out of Docker and even XenServer so try to update Docker package often). 

There's one major difference between Docker and VM. Docker container does not persist any changes to the storage after restarted. You restart a container. It resets the storage back to the original state. However, you can bind or map folders in Docker to folders on the host system, so binaries running in the Docker container can persist data and files between restarts. You can for example map **/var/docker\_data** on host to **/etc/nginx/available-sites** in Docker container, so any changes made to /etc/nginx/available-sites will be saved in /var/docker\_data on host system.

Another major selling point of Docker is network isolation. You can run many different Docker containers, and since networks are isolated, each container can have binaries listening to the same socket ports. The host system doesn't care since ports opened in Docker containers stay inside the containers; however, if you want to, you can map a port on host system to a port in Docker container. You can map port 8080 on host system to port 80 in Docker container. Any incoming traffic to port 8080 on host system will be bridged to port 80 of the Docker container running Apache for example. 

Why all these hassles? Because one application may needs different version of Apache, MariaDB, Node 10 and such, and you have another application that needs an older Apache or perhaps needs to run on Node 8. Traditionally, if you're going to install different version of the daemons on the host system, it's going to be a total nightmare, making sure that there's no conflict. Docker solves this by running Node 10 in a container and running Node 8 inside another container for example. You can have different versions of Python running on the same host system just fine thanks to the isolation. There's never going to be a conflict.

Know you're getting the idea, but you know the most awesome part? It's the docker-compose.yml file that you create to run your service. In this file, you define all the services, binaries and files you're going to need to run your service. In the docker-compose.yml file, you definite what container runs what service. You can have a container running PHP+nginx, another container running MariaDB, and another container running redis or elasticsearch. These containers run isolated BUT by default they share the same bridge network, so the containers defined inside docker-compose.yml file can talk to each other via their hostnames and ports. Since containers are not full blown VMs, you can run hundreds of containers and not really having to size up RAM by much. Docker containers only use the memory to run the few processes and their dependencies."

As the world becomes hotter, some countries see 5 to 10 years of drought, with some countries wiped off the maps by rising oceans. Lakes and rivers dry out. Most crops on wet lands don't fare too well, as the day is too hot. The crops yield barely any fruits at all. Then starts the migration crisis where five billion people start waging wars against the other five billion people for higher or wetter grounds. Countries would wage war for Greenland which was used to be covered with snow but now it's lush and truly green. The UN is overwhelmed by conflicts, too many to count, on the planet. The northern countries would lay mile-wide landmine buffers across their borders to prevent the ghouls, or the thin miserable southern people from coming in.

The oceans are too acidic to support lives. You can tell that because sea water tastes not only salty but sour. They say it's because the oceans absorb too much CO2 from the atmosphere. Some lakes that are already hopelessly dried get refilled with seawater. They would put huge filtration pumps to make it less acidic and there they breed the last of the sea creatures.

In colder months, people would migrate to the forest to hunt animals and they make new log cabins if forest fires didn't destroy them in the year before. When the summer come, people would migrate north to the plains or to the mountains because it's suicidal to stay in the forest in the summer due to raging forest fires. Yet millions choose to stay in their forest because there is no norther when the forest is already in the north pole. They get killed by the fires and the smokes.

But thanks to crop experiments on Mars 200 years ago, we are able to grow some crops in deserts, using close-loop systems that make the temperature just right for the crops to yield fruits. How they water the crops still amaze me. As there's so little fresh water, they water very carefully by dripping water onto the roots, drop by drop. Every drop of water saved is one drop of water available for drinking.
