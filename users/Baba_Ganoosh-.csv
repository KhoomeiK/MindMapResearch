I would pretend to leave but park the car on the next street over and she would sneak me back in. Her room was upstairs next to her sister and parents. So we did the no pants dance when suddenly mom wakes up to go watch tv downstairs. Shit. 30 min later her dad wakes up and joins the mom to watch tv. My life starts flashing before my eyes. I chilled for hours, panicking. Trying to make a plan. I could have her distract them while I slip out the door? Could I make a rope to escape through the damn window? They finally went back to bed 3 hours later. I seized the moment and snuck passed the room and slipped out the door."
