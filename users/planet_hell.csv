Still, it's not like you're (complete) strangers. That's how I tend to interpret things like ""you don't know me anymore"", or ""I am another person"".

I'd say most of us have simply blossomed and evolved as persons, adding on our personalities, which is normal and expected by everyone. Like you added social skills, but you're still an introvert at heart."

I should have listened better.

That being said I am also disgusted with his behavior. That's plain rude and nasty. OP can't wait for a change in his attitude that might or might not come, not while being disrespected this way. Maybe getting the boot is what he needs to start taking a long look at himself."
ForeverAlone,ff6h6i7,t1_ff620m9,1579627114.0,"I would have liked those 9 seconds because I loved her with all my heart, and failing to share that intimate moment is what ultimately broke me. I will regret that moment until I die.

I was too hurt and embarrassed after she eventually left me, and paralyzed with fear and anxiety that it will happen again. Didn't help that I only wanted her and nobody else. So I gave up. And that's my story.

But God Damn, what happened to you is just as brutal. That can traumatize a man. It's what I ran away from. To be honest it's understandable you kinda gave up.

But I wish we could have both dealt with it better. Now at 30 it seems pretty silly that we were so insecure in our early 20's. Many ppl don't know what they are doing at that age. Now at 30+ ... it's different. On the bright side we are still not that old, and still have a chance.

I'm also not a fan of Tinder, most girls there are looking for a night of fun, the fuck can I do with zero experience. I'd just waste their time and make a fool of myself. And like you, I'm more interested in shared interests and romance then sex.

I even bought the book ""She comes first"", that's how desperate I am :)) At least if you can perform good oral sex, you have something going for you. Check it out, haven't read it yet, but I heard it's fantastic. Hope it will improve my confidence a bit.

I want to start trying harder, because it's kinda reaching a point when it's now or never for us ... at least in terms of not completely wasting our youth. I have taken steps, but small ones so far.

Do you have anxiety, self confidence issues, insecurities (I guess these are inevitable in our situation)? Women sense that and it's very unattractive. Also things some men don't always think about, like how your skin or hair smells, teeth hygiene, clothes. I'm putting more emphasis on these things, we'll see how it goes."

I hope you do manage to get over your ex. Or at least move on. I think it's ok for that person to have a place in your heart forever and for you to cherish the memories, as long as it doesn't mess with your life. You seem to have a pretty healthy outlook of the situation. 

  `I always knew it would be this way if we ever didnâ€™t make it.` 

This worries me a bit though, because I remember feeling the exact same way. Ppl were telling me all the classic lines, ""time, other girls, it'll get better, blah blah"", but I was thinking ""no it won't, you don't understand, I gave her all I had, all I was"". I knew.

Good luck!"
BreakUps,ff3oqbu,t1_ff3lvi6,1579545592.0,"Pfff, ok, here goes ...

I just never stopped loving her. Didn't have the will or courage to put myself out there again. It didn't help that I had performance anxiety when we were together ... couldn't keep IT up ... couldn't share that special moment with the girl I loved, couldn't be her first. That crippled me.

Started drinking, anxiety and depression soon followed (i was shy with girls anyway}. I became a ghost and let the years go to waste. Only recently I realized I need to snap out of it. But the feelings for her remain. I'd still run into her arms in a heartbeat if she came calling. I probably miss my youth and that special connection (since it's the only time I had it} as much as I miss her. It's all very pathetic and embarrassing, she forgot about me a loooong time ago.

heartbreak,ff32kc7,t3_erac71,1579532020.0,"This sent chills down my spine. I did not expect to read this here.

I understand. And I can't judge you even if I wanted to ... because I am living with the same never ending heartbreak. It's been 15 years for me. All my youth. I loved her so much and so intensely. I can't bring myself to want anybody else. There's not a moment in my life when I wouldn't have ran back into her arms if she wanted me. 

I don't know what to do anymore. She really, truly broke my heart. Though it wasn't her fault.

Sometimes the pain and longing are just in the back of my mind. But sometimes it feels like it all happened yesterday. And it hurts like it hurt back then. And it lasts for months.

Our situations are in many ways different (mainly because in my case, we are not in contact, she forgot about me a long time ago, I'm nothing but a speck of dust in her youth - which makes me feel absolutely pathetic), but also incredibly similar. There are not many people living with this limerence. It's rare and unlikely to find someone who understands. The classic advice doesn't work for us. Time doesn't heal our wounds.

It's sad, really. I'm sorry you're going through this. If you want someone who doesn't judge, you can talk to me."

depression,fdr600a,t1_fdptm0f,1578679957.0,"Try and do something, I feel so stupid for feeling hopeless at 21, and wasting my 20's instead of trying to get better. I thought girls wouldn't want me because I am broken, but I realize now how silly that was. Everybody is still figuring themselves out at that age. You can still live your youth!!

Granted, I'm sure 40+ year olds would say the same to me. Let's both try and do all we can to get better."

depression,fdp45dj,t1_fdp3q2g,1578619565.0,"That was a good title :). Are you feeling better?

Maybe I'm being smug, but I believe I know exactly why I came to be this way. There was no childhood, but there was teenage trauma. I'm not a therapist though. I'm pretty sure I'll go to one soon, and I'll see then.

Thanks, a kind word is always helpful."

I walked the path you want to walk, so that's why I'm telling you not to make this mistake. I wish you strength in dealing with this bro, I know it's horrible. Please take care of yourself."

heartbreak,fdml1x6,t3_elqjtj,1578553929.0,"I made the same promise more than 10 years ago, and I kept it. Huge mistake. Grieve in your own time, but don't let yourself become a ghost. Otherwise you won't heal right, you're going to end up lonely, and quite possibly still hurting over a relationship from decades ago. I know that you don't care about this now, but in time I hope you allow yourself to love again."
AskMen,fdmjcwl,t1_fdmi7t4,1578552026.0,"just to be clear, by performance anxiety I meant not being able to maintain an erection. It's great that you're so understanding and caring towards him btw. He's lucky. Kudos to you ang good luck"
AskMen,fdmhyhj,t3_em5gzw,1578550546.0,"Try to make sure there's as little pressure as possible on him .... reassure him, take initiative, help him get / stay hard, maybe put on his condom, sit on top. Performance anxiety could be a thing in his situation. He needs to feel safe and to know all will be ok no matter what happens.

But in the end it's up to him. The first three times i was supposed to have sex I had performance anxiety. My then girlfriend acted like the sweetest angel, bless her heart, but there was only so much she could do. We never got to share that intimate moment, sadly. Biggest regret of my life, because I loved her so much."

AskMen,fdmak6r,t3_em47gf,1578543980.0,"Kinda in the same spot, but I see an upgrade in confidence. I realized that improving myself as a person will also improve my quality of life and increase my chances at happiness.

Small steps so far: working out more, getting fitter, eating healthier, reading much more, being kinder to ppl, better hygiene, taking better care of my skin, teeth and so on.

Two books which might help:

Models: Attract Women Through Honesty (Mark Manson)

She Comes First (Ian Kerner)

Haven't read them yet, but they are supposed to be great, I'm excited to see what they will add to my knowledge and behavior."

AskMen,fdldjuc,t3_elzovo,1578521725.0,"I'm gonna be a bit  melodramatic because I actually remember exactly how and when it happened.

For the first few months of our relationship in High school, I was kinda distant. I did like her, but I was trying to play the ""cool guy"". Especially in public I barely showed any affection.

One day I was hanging around with friends, she came up, put her hands around me, and in a half joking - half sad manner asked if I don\`t like her anymore, and if I still want us to be together.

My expected reaction would have been something like ""yo, the guys must think I\`m so smooth"".

But I suddenly found my heart aching for making her feel that way, and got weak in the knees realizing how empty I would feel if I didn\`t have her in my life.

I hugged her so tight, buried my face in her neck and told her she\`s the best thing that ever happened to me. The guys were cracking jokes, but I didn\`t care.

Next break I went and bought her flowers, so everybody could see how much she was cared about.

I knew I loved her right then, and that my heart was now hers. Too bad she broke it half a year later."
