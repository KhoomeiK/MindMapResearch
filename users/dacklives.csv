Your stupid ideas being stupid doesn't make me a child. 

&#x200B;

\> Your blanket refusal to think about what I'm writing is fucking stupid.

If you wrote about the world being flat I would also give that a blanket refusal.  I've seen this stupid idea before and you aren't bringing anything new to the table.  ""Oh we will just train everyone, that'll make people responsible with tanks and nukes."" 

&#x200B;

 \>We have a military, which is made of common people, who have access to these items already.  

&#x200B;

\*\*Some\*\* of them have access to \*\*some\*\* of the hardware.  None of them have full access to it all.   Because even the well trained and informed military personal know that is a fucking stupid thing to do."

PoliticalHumor,ff66m6p,t1_ff65elk,1579620381.0,"Yes the intent of the 2nd amendment when is was written was to protect themselves from a tyrannical government.  But that was before automatic weapons, missiles, fighter jets, tanks, satellites, drones and all kinds of other shit we don't have access to.   So really 2nd amendment wouldn't help us too much at this point.    Do I think we should be able to have weapons? Absolutely.  Do I think it should be regulated?  Absolutely.  And so did the founding fathers.  Which is why the second half of the 2nd amendment is important."

The Quds Force (alternatively spelled Ghods or Qods) (Persian: نیروی قدس‎, translit. Niru-ye Qods, ""Jerusalem Force"") is a special unit of Iran's Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Revolutionary Guard).

The **Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution** (Persian: سپاه پاسداران انقلاب اسلامی‎ / *Sepāh-e Pāsdārān-e Enqelāb-e Eslāmi*, or *Sepāh* for short), often called **Revolutionary Guards**, is a branch of [Iran's military](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran), founded after the Iranian revolution on 5 May 1979.[\[2\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-IISS-1) Whereas the regular military (*artesh*) defends Iran's borders and maintains internal order, according to the Iranian constitution, the Revolutionary Guard (*pasdaran*) is intended to protect the country's Islamic system.[\[3\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-2) The Revolutionary Guards state that their role in protecting the Islamic system is preventing foreign interference as well as coups by the military or ""deviant movements"".[\[4\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-3)[\[5\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-4)

The IRGC has roughly 125,000 military personnel including ground, aerospace and naval forces. Its naval forces are now the primary forces tasked with operational control of the Persian Gulf.[\[6\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-globalbearings1-5) It also controls the paramilitary [Basij](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Basij) militia which has about 90,000 active personnel,[\[7\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-Abrahamian.2C_Ervand_p.175-6-6) and in recent years has developed into a ""multibillion-dollar business empire,""[\[8\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-NYT20090721-7) and is reportedly the ""third-wealthiest organization in Iran"" after the National Iranian Oil Company and the Imam Reza Endowment.[\[9\]](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution#cite_note-rferl-8)
