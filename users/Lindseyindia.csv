A leader, to me, is someone who is meant to guide, inspire and motivate new ideas, rather thanenforce them. They let others think freely and come to their own decisions, but they are possess the alpha energy of confidence that others hope to have in themselves or already have.

A boss, or someone in higher power, is the one who manipulates, in my eyes, as they are doing more of the enforcement of making sure a task is DONE, regardless of how.

Have a great racist day!"
AskReddit,fdo9p9j,t1_fdo9b98,1578601309.0,Okay buddy. Go be racist towards the oppressed outside. Get some air. Maybe stop talking to so many white people for perspective. It's going to be okay. Just breathe. You got this :)
AskReddit,fdo9dzw,t1_fdo8a4i,1578601159.0,"Because it wasn't racist. You don't even know what racism looks like in your own country to be able to define what racism is so I don't take shit you say seriously at all. You've said far more racist things in this thread and I'll be honest, you're getting flamed on my social media for it. So keep going if you want. I really don't respect you and how you treat your own community."
AskReddit,fdo8q9w,t1_fdo8c97,1578600835.0,"You can absolutely be racist towards your own race if the action/verbiage you are using towards them is in an oppressive manner. Example: Uncle Ruckus on The Boondocks.

You sticking up for a bunch of racist white people who are butt hurt they can't say a racial slur when they have a choice of 180,000 words they can say instead tells me that you do not care about the oppressive history of minorities as you are dismissing them to cape for white people using the same oppressive term. That's why I won't keep arguing. The question wasn't even posed to you if you aren't white. So your fake selective outrage and racism apologist attitude doesn't matter to me. That's YOUR own internal battle. You can fight that on your own. I'll step aside lol."
AskReddit,fdo6ogx,t1_fdo6ew2,1578599830.0,"Lmao you want to use the N-word with your heart and soul sooo badly because you’re displeased with the selection of 180,000 words in the English language you can use instead. That is a hell of a dedication to being racist man lol salute to you for that."
AskReddit,fdo67n0,t1_fdo5knf,1578599597.0,"You're not getting karma for replies that get downvoted lmaooooo but okay, waste your own time I guess. I don't mind debating because I work a job that encourages this, so this just helps my paycheck tbh lol.

But truly I reply more with the hopes that you wake up from the Sunken Place at some point. It's okay. Your community will welcome you back. Don't be afraid.

And I don't accept racism of any kind. Instilled misguided hatred and microaggressive comments and undertones isn't a ""different opinion,"" especially when it is rooted in the oppression of people I love. When the N-word no longer negatively impacts people I care about, I'll stop fighting to show people why it's wrong. Until then, I'm going hard for them because they deserve it, and being white, I have a privilege they don't.

But hey, let your people suffer on your watch because you spend more of your energy defending the freedom of the ones who wanted them to suffer. That's your loss."
AskReddit,fdo4ksb,t1_fdo4h73,1578598789.0," Lol okay, have a great racist day"
AskReddit,fdo4iky,t1_fdo43zz,1578598754.0,"Lol my friends are the ones encouraging me to write shit like this because it defends THEM and not the racist ass white people in here that you keep going harder to defend than THEY are to their own comments. Why are you going so hard for them? That's really the psychology I want to understand. Like are you okay? Do you understand your own history with these people?

Meanwhile, they literally wouldn't do any of this for you if reversed. They don't give two fucks about your freedom because it could effect theirs. I honestly don't want to engage anymore because I feel sorry for your way of thinking. I will continue to fight for those you are fighting to continue oppressing. Hope you learn some day. Peace."
AskReddit,fdo3tix,t1_fdo3oah,1578598384.0,"Weird you use songwriting time to cape for oppressors rather than fight for actual equality.

Again, no apology. Not apologizing to someone who capes for racist white people. You apologize to your own people and then we can talk. Otherwise, I have little to no respect for you and don't owe you a damn thing when you also offended my friends :)"
AskReddit,fdo3gqj,t1_fdo30c2,1578598193.0,"Lol okay, have a great racist day"
AskReddit,fdo2vy3,t1_fdo298v,1578597894.0,"That’s YOUR community then. Not everyone else’s and certainly not mine. You don’t experience racism, great foryou. If only the others I fight for didn’t have to so that they could sit on a thread caping for white people who would love to call them the N-word simply because they’re basking in the freedom to be able to. I feel so so sorry that this is how you spent your time today when you could have been in another thread fighting for the fair treatment of YOUR people. Not those who have no hesitation in oppressing you. Like seriously. I truly pray for you and hope you never have to experience what many do daily who look like you."
AskReddit,fdo2ms7,t1_fdo1ymy,1578597758.0,"I didn’t change it. You’re just deflecting from the original point of the post to try and make yourself feel smart. Cool, be smart.
You’re still caping for white people being able to use a racial slur so I don’t have any respect for you."
AskReddit,fdo2dwc,t1_fdo1oho,1578597626.0,You do know journalists travel and have to be IN the fields and offices to investigate stories right? Anyone can be a journalist if it was all done through a screen. You want to cancel my truth so badly that makes your non-experiences more relevant. Just say you don’t experience racism in the same way so you don’t relate. It doesn’t mean it’s not true and not common. Weird you deny your own people’s truths (the things I’ve seen them go through) so hard on a thread for racist white people to answer. (Which is also funny that you even answered since it wasn’t even posed to you so you just fished for bullshit)
