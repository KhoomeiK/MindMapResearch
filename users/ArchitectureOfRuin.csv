politics,fcscyly,t1_fcs1zx5,1577914800.0,"""Free stuff from rich people"" is really just getting back the labor value that was stolen from us in the first place. The working class produce the wealth. At least the wealth that isnt derived from imaginary number speculation and debt interest. 

Also, the working class will contribute to the common funds too. It won't just be the wealthy paying for everything.

The way I see it, between stolen labor value, subsidies, a million tax loopholes and the benefits of corrupt legislation -- the rich are the ones getting all the free stuff.

We just want to take our world back."

>Democratic socialism is what we already have, but stronger support for social programs

This is not remotely true. You're describing Social Democracy, which we also absolutely do not have. Libraries and social security are not Socialism - thats part of the right wing misinformation propaganda that ""Socialism is when the government does stuff"".

Socialism is when the workers control the means of production and private property is abolished, for starters. 

Democratic Socialism is ultimately a redundant phrase that was made necessary by right wing propaganda that Socialism is the opposite of democracy and that somehow Capitalism and democracy are synonymous. Socialism is inherently, fundamentally radically democratic. Moreso even than neoliberal Capitalism as it extends democracy to the workplace and would eliminate corporate control over society and politics which is the major inhibitor of our liberty today.

When Bernie says hes a democratic socialist, I suspect he either genuinely means in in the small-d small-s sense - as in poorly phrased social democracy *or* he really is a radical, is actually a Democratic Socialist, and is just hiding it in a decades long plan to be palatable to red-scared Americans, ultimately to become president and do the most Socialist shit he can get away with. The latter is my hope."

They've been throwing the ""far"" in in one way or another for a couple decades in order to reframe liberals as part of the left, giving the illusion of broader choice than actually exists in American politics.

 And being an identity politics obsessed hysterical weirdo is not a measure of how far left someone is. In fact, its actually a decent measure of how little they really understand of leftist ideologies. All that ""SJW"" stuff *is* important to most leftists, but it is not the central point by any means.

  Leftists look at things through a class-based lens. If, for example, I think people of color should have it better in this country, then I don't necessarily go out looking to pass laws to ensure they get special treatment (anti discrimination laws are good tho), I would fight for the betterment of the entire working class, knowing it would disproportionately help people of color. 

Also, liberals are not leftists. They are moderate-right to center. Leftists would encompass Socialists, Communists and Anarchists of various tendencies. Lots of strictly and extremely idpol focused people are liberals."

movies,fc4aed7,t1_fc3zx5x,1577410995.0,"Yeah but the director and editor should be in close communication with the person doing the score (and vice versa) to ensure the optimal quality of the final product. 

Ive done the score for two little indie short films.
 
 One was a good collaborative experience where we communicated and took just that little extra time to be like 'yeah this part needs to be a little more intense but take longer to peak' or 'the mood needs to be a little more sinister' . Then we went over it again after the final edit to further tweak things and make it fit like a tailored suit. 

 The other was terrible. Basically I submitted the pieces and didn't get any feedback. Shit just got chopped up in weird ways that either could have been made to fit better or didn't work at all, too loud, too quiet, etc. All those things could have been fixed with a little communication and mutual feedback and the film suffered for it. 

 Soundtrack isn't even close to the most important factor overall (maybe top 5 tho), but I think still it gets under appreciated. 

Its their film to fuck up, and its true the composer/musician is an employee. But it's also common sense that an oblivious dictator, or even just an unaware, sloppy filmmaker are going to get suboptimal performances and end results."
