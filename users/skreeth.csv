It’s not exactly about romantic love. It’s about embracing and loving everything in your life, the good and the bad. I love it because it’s unpretentious but beautiful, and it captures that kind of relentless positivity that’s so hard to actually practice. I’ve had a really hard year and I’m trying to remember that all of it is just part of the human experience. Here’s the poem:

When death comes

like the hungry bear in autumn;


when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse


 


to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;


when death comes


like the measle-pox


 
when death comes


like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,


 
I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:


what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?


 
And therefore I look upon everything


as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,


and I look upon time as no more than an idea,


and I consider eternity as another possibility,


 
and I think of each life as a flower, as common


as a field daisy, and as singular,


 
and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,


tending, as all music does, toward silence,


 
and each body a lion of courage, and something


precious to the earth.


 
When it's over, I want to say all my life


I was a bride married to amazement.


I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.


 
When it's over, I don't want to wonder


if I have made of my life something particular, 

and real.


 
I don't want to find myself sighing and 


frightened,


or full of argument.


 
I don't want to end up simply having visited this world


*Mary Oliver*
