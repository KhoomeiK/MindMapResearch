That's why humans have a frontal lobe--to go beyond surface level appearances. Division / segregation on the basis of visible differences between groups is probably the hallmark of great apes, however. A lot of people are brutal and ape-like in practice, but I'd hesitate to call it 'human nature'.

To me, what humanity should strive for is to eschew the lower, more primitive levels of mind and to cultivate the newer regions of the brain. The newer developments of the mind are what give us an evolutionary advantage, and I don't think we're nearly done evolving.

But Lonerism and Innerspeaker dealing in themes of self confidence and reconciling who you are with what the world wants you to be? That’s my shit right there. Been listening to Innerspeaker close to 10 years at this point and it hasn’t lost its luster.

indieheads,ff2jkp6,t1_ff2ham6,1579509053.0,"I think Kevin was certainly clever with his arrangements on Currents--he tapped into a form of nostalgia that was ripe for the picking at the time and it paid off tremendously. The past decade has been earmarked by 80s pastiche with massive, gated Linndrum hits and sparkly poly-synth chords. At the turn of the decade I might even risk saying that it's a bit stale unless otherwise bolstered by exemplary songwriting.

Currents, on the other hand, strikes this particular early 90s nostalgia which is still on its way up in terms of popularity. The analog synths and big drum hits of yore get swapped out for complex, evolving wavetable synths and PCM samples. It's not quite as tacky and brash as 80s instrumentation, nor is it the manicured and glossy sound of today. It's this weird, almost uncanny-valleyish picture of modern music filtered through some gear that isn't necessarily vintage, but old enough to evoke some weird sensations. To me, it kinda sounds like a lot of early 90s new age albums you'd find in bargain bins but repurposed into something immediate and pertinent to the popular interest."

A foundation based on truth. I have certain pre-selection criteria--primarily 'do they have the ability to rear a child'?

Traditionally, these things were self evident (barring infertility). With the advent of medical transitions, this is no longer the case. Thus, it becomes a pertinent question to ask prospective partners. If they're willing to base the entire relationship on lies by omission, then it's not a relationship I want to be in.

It's analogous to catfishing. If you're playing with vague, faulty perceptions of identity to keep a potential partner 'on the hook', then you are in fact playing a game of deception. If you think that giving somebody the full truth of who you are is going to destroy the relationship, then it is deceptive to omit these things to stay together with  the person."

Where'd you get that from? ""Principles of Zen""? Sounds like forms and ideas to me.

I guess it depends on if you want it to be a sub about expressing zen rather than learning about it. I know 'learning' about zen is yet another paradox so spare me on the semantics. In my mind, making it about the expression robs newcomers of gleaning anything worthwhile. If I came here years ago, to a bunch of people doing a performative ""I alone am the world honored one"" routine I would have left then and there.

Personally, I've grown to appreciate his approach. Clearly defined content guidelines are how you keep subreddits from falling apart. The moment you begin to entertain multiple interpretations of something, it becomes an intellectual free for all. Most of my favorite small subreddits of yore became too lax with their content policies, they grew very quickly, and at some point the original community becomes a minority with a completely different set of ideals from the majority.

If this subreddit is the same way it's always been, the primary gripe people have is over a narrow set of topics for discussion. I get that people want to post about zen-adjacent topics, but it's essentially opening pandora's box. You let it slide, and it very quickly becomes difficult to put the lid back on. New people join the sub, they post off-topic stuff because it's allowed. Newer people see the off-topic posts, thinking it's the heart of r/zen, and perpetuate the same kinds of posts and make things even more muddled. I've seen this with a lot of meme subs which formerly had stringent guidelines on formatting and tone.

Most of my favorite artists on spotify top out at \~200-300k streams on their more popular singles. If you're getting 1-2M streams per track on an EP, you're blowing the fuck up. With that kind of attention, you can easily rake in $300-400k from touring and merch.

In other words, if you're only getting a *paltry* (/s) 300k listens over the course of a year, you make...$1200. 300k is still a fuckton, and in the 90-something percentile in terms of popularity on spotify. 

Spotify (and piracy) effectively killed the musician's ability to sell their work. For smaller artists, this is a huge deal. Before, you only had to sell a few thousand physical albums in a year to make a living. This was difficult but doable. Now, you need to sell a few thousand shirts or concert tickets because the music is basically free. This is a much harder proposition to fill."
todayilearned,fdtfgkn,t3_en07vr,1578716002.0,"I feel like all of these 'Spotify pays more' statistics are pretty disingenuous. Make no mistake, precisely 0 of these platforms are paying anything substantial. If you can live off of stream revenue, you're in the 99th percentile. Most working musicians aren't making the bulk of their income from streams.

Streaming platforms along with piracy turned music into a commodity. Where the music itself used to be at the bottom of the consumer funnel eg ""sell the album, make the money"", now it's at the top eg ""give away the music for free to build a fanbase, sell concert tickets and merch to said fanbase"". For all intents and purposes, spotify and youtube are not ways to make money as a musician--they're primarily ways to get your stuff out there and make 1 or 2 cents in the process.

Same goes for youtube in 2020. The adpocalypse made it nigh impossible to live off of monetization and ad revenue alone. Most successful youtubers are selling merch or otherwise diversified their income stream.

tl;dr this is a feel good headline for people who want to feel like they're a patron of the broader music scene. Unless you're going to shows and buying merch, you're only a degree removed from pirates."

I don't care if people are interested for the complete wrong reasons, because they would simply not care otherwise. Just like a few years ago, when people already knew about this epstein stuff and it was still a 'conspiracy theory'.

Could you imagine if there wasn't a single link to trump? The media would have dropped it, and it wouldn't be on reddit to the degree that it is. It's a blessing in disguise. It gives normies a reason to believe."
IAmA,fdmk374,t1_fdmiuyo,1578552835.0,">As long as it doesn't involve bothering people who are minding their own business go for it

I won't know if I'm bothering them until I approach them. If they're not interested in talking, I will apologize and leave. Is that harassment to you?

Otherwise, I'm just making assumptions and limiting my horizons in terms of who I can interact with. The more stock I put into what my inner voice says about things, the more it can use impropriety as an excuse to be fearful and averse.

For the sake of the discussion, it doesn't have to be a park. It could be the common area of my college campus or somewhere where there is some degree of mutual relation. Places where you might want to introduce yourself to somebody."
IAmA,fdmeg1o,t1_fdmdczf,1578547220.0,"Because I'd like to have the freedom to do so if I please, and more importantly I'd like to have dominion over my mind rather than vice versa.

Going further, I'd like to be completely liberated from my attachment to social expectation. The mechanism of organized social control is pernicious and severely limiting. Considering the state of affairs domestically and abroad, I don't know how much stock I put into society being ""correct"". So I try to tune that shit out for my own sake."
IAmA,fdmd13c,t1_fdmafii,1578545994.0,"Public parks are useful for the very reason you bring up. It's open ended--there is no real 'reason' for approaching anyone. My anxiety is totally fine when interactions have clear guidelines and objectives. In other words, I don't have much difficulty talking to cashiers or servers because the entire interaction is transactional and essentially rehearsed. Even in a bar setting there's an expectation of being approached which smooths things over a fair bit. It's precisely when I have a choice in the matter where things become difficult. My ego gets in the way, and gives me reasons to avoid approaching. 'Forced and unnatural' is a big one I run up against.

But this is why cold approach is such a big thing in PUA. It's scary as shit, especially for people who have little to no social skills. It's the social equivalent of being thrown into the deep end. I think so few people have cold approached, for romantic reasons or otherwise, that it's easy to label it as harassment. This is why whenever you get approached by ANYONE in the western world, they preface it with a shit ton of apologies ie ""sorry for bothering you but..."" ""I don't mean to be a hassle but..."" and things of this nature. But how often do these advances *really* bother us? I can't speak for you, but I'm generally happy when somebody goes out of their way to talk to me. Intent matters nonetheless."
IAmA,fdm946n,t1_fdm3w8o,1578542883.0,"There's clearly a gigantic contextual gap between meeting someone at a public park during the day versus a bar at night. If you're gaining all of your social experience from bar hopping, then you'll mainly build experience talking to drunks or being drunk yourself. Not ideal imo.

Doing these things with sober people in plain daylight is helpful to anxiety sufferers in a bigger way. It's essentially immersion therapy. If you only confront your fear in niche ways, then it will still rear its head in other scenarios."
