Interestingly, until the 1700s the annual population growth rate was tiny (~.04%). Its the advances in medical care that have had an exponential effect on the rate of growth (more people living to reproduce, having more children, and those children all living to reproduce, and so forth). However we're reaching diminishing returns on that effect (in developed countries at least), and some countries (Japan for example) have already reached negative population growth."
