**Crush (PSP/3DS)**

Incredibly unique puzzle game where you change perspective from 3D to 2D to move through and around complex maps. 

It’s so hard to explain this without actually seeing it but honestly if you loved how strange the gameplay was in portal I’d assume you’d like this.

Kind of like the lovechild of Portal and mobile game Monument Valley.

-

**Clash of Heroes (Various)**

A new take on the match 3 genre but with a combat element added that makes this an incredible addictive puzzle game.

Has RPG style single player that has hours of gameplay but the real fun is in PvP where the timeless style of gameplay will have you in a constant state of “wanna play one more” with you’re friends.

Uni mates slated this game for a full year before caving and playing with me, ended up having daily tournaments, and my best mate has brought this game on 4 different devices he loves it so much. 

Similar to - Puzzle Quest

-

**Uplink (PC)**

Wanna pretend you’re a super kool hacker, roaming your way around the dark web, stealing information, government secrets, money, and more? Then this is your game.

A really old title but certainly timeless gameplay style, as it’s pretty damn old but I’ve gone back to it occasionally and it’s not felt dated.

Feels almost text based (which it is partly) but requires you to upgrade your ‘Rig’, take jobs, rank up, talk with other hackers, and complete hacks within the time limit based on difficulty.

The jobs require different tasks like finding and decrypting info, and if you don’t complete a high risk job in time, or don’t cover your tracks by erasing logs then after a few in game days you’ll be caught... no slap on the wrist tho, get caught and your in jail and that character is gone forever.

AskUK,fe19lts,t3_enl1qo,1578824074.0,"First London is incredibly multicultural and has been for a long time so people are much more used to mixing.

Secondly really depends where you live, east London is one of the most insanely multicultural places on earth. I was born in Newham, which is about 20% white British, 20% black, 15% Eastern European, 15% Indian, etc... consider the kids like me who grew up there are now in their 30s, with such a diverse population it’s hard to be racist, however not all areas of London are like this at all.

Third London and the rest of the UK are, and I can’t stress this enough, *veeeery* different. I travel the UK a lot of football, and have lived recently in both Sheffield and Birmingham where I am now and things aren’t the same... not that that’s an issue for me, however I am mixed race myself and have experienced more cases of racism in the last year than I had in East London in the last 10. My parents also note that they get more “funny looks” and tho neither of these things are absolutely terrible there is a small but clear contrast.

Finally things have changed a lot in the UK over the last 15 or so years, I remember growing up and having people shout at me to “go back to my own country” even tho I was born here (just because I’m ever so slightly brown lol), luckily things have moved on a lot and despite occasional one of incidents, and a growing anti Muslim rhetoric there still is a lot of progress going on and after just hitting the big 30 I can say I am proud to live in this country.

Its not perfect, I don’t know how it will end up now, but we’re surprisingly progressive vs basically 99% of other countries (maybe Canada tops us? but certainly not many else) - events like the olympics and the World Cup have brought about a fresh sense of national pride and I hopeful if this whole brexit malarkey comes off ok things we get back to how they were in the summer of 2012 and 2018, as they were honestly absolutely magical times"
