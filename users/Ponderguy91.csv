discgolf,ff7rkzp,t3_erdygn,1579656651.0,I really wish I knew what was in his bag. He had a slow turn max distance disc and some shorter quick flip guys.
whowouldwin,ff292so,t1_ff127p8,1579497407.0,"Frieza is probably defeated as soon as he arrives through the rift. There’s an automatic defense system set up around the planet in Marvel that can repel Galactus. After the initial attack is deflected, it gives time travelers enough time to travel back and assemble plans, and it means there are forces prepared to immediately accept Frieza’s surrender. He won’t, and he probably dies"
tax,fev9k7l,t1_fetjiiq,1579394769.0,Lack of clarity of possible impacts related to credit. Financially it doesn’t seem to make much difference. Filing tomorrow probably. I can either get a smaller state return or a larger one

discgolf,fell6fy,t1_felb67p,1579224814.0,Thanks! Makes me feel like I can finally justify some distance drivers in my bag lol
discgolf,fekhl5q,t1_fekf8l4,1579200201.0,Really? Seems like for Paul those are throwing pretty much the same as the destroyer. Hard to tell from just video

discgolf,feauah2,t1_feanfk9,1578952209.0,"Nope, this is wrong. The game needs a family friendly appeal. Children are the heart and soul of how the game survives and grows. Embracing cannabis would make a large number of parents put their kids attention elsewhere. It’s common sense really."

It will dial in the upshot game for sure"

whowouldwin,fdmiukq,t3_em391h,1578551484.0,"There is basically no way I buy Sith Yoda being more powerful than Sith Palpatine. Palpatine was considerably stronger than Yoda. He was able to be face to face with ALL of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy and they couldn’t even tell he was force sensitive. They didn’t even know the Sith existed, and Palpatine was able to manipulate them to do his will. 

Palpatine is and always will be the penultimate Sith. He is the fulfillment of Bane, he is the omega"

EternalCardGame,fdh8v1t,t1_fdfg0ln,1578417901.0,"It’s because of the difficulty of acquiring a collection. The designers are poor at testing their cards. My entire time spent in the game was spent in one of two ways. Building and then deconstructing top decks after they get nerfed. Or trying to build an organic collection by playing 1000 games of gauntlet to draft and not being competitive for months on end 

I was capable of playing the game well. Made top 100 in masters throne each month I cared to play, but at a certain point I realized I wasn’t having any actual fun doing it"

whowouldwin,fchmmz9,t1_fchjj0h,1577651888.0,"So, ignore tangible data because you don’t think so? Lol okay guy"
whowouldwin,fchdw4x,t3_eh8mp4,1577649602.0,"I’m going to say yes. Here’s why:

1. We know the combined power levels of Nappa and Vegeta are [22,000](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Power_Levels) 

2. We know that peak normal human power level is, at most, [150](https://amp.reddit.com/r/dbz/comments/2785zw/hercules_power_level_during_his_prime_id_say/) if we consider ‘peak’ to be ‘non-ki’ such as Hercule in his prime, but a good conservative estimate is more like 20, since that puts him as twice as strong as the average farmer (5 - 10 power level). We will go with an even lower power level of 15 because it helps the opposing argument. 

3. We know that MCU Hulk can rip a car in half, which requires exertion of [11 million pounds of force](https://www.popsci.com/breakdown/article/2008-05/incredible-hulk-curiously-strong/). 

I think it’s safe to assume that Hulk could also squat an equivalent weight (probably much more) of 11 million pounds.

4. We also know that the world squat record is [1,273.2 pounds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)#World_records). I’m going to be incredibly generous here and say that Hercule is roughly four times stronger than that guy, putting his squat level at 5000 pounds. 

5. This means that a likely weakened Hulk against a likely much overestimated Hercule puts Hulk at 2,200 times stronger than peak human (11 million divided by 5,000)

6. So if we take the ultra low estimate of Hercule’s power level of 15, that puts MCU Hulk at a power level of 33,000, still more than enough to beat both Vegeta and Nappa during that Saga. 

So if Tony was able to build a suit that could stalemate the Hulk, or even give him trouble, then the answer is pretty much absolutely yes, he could prepare for the arrival of Vegeta and Nappa to at least cause them significant difficulties."

discgolf,fcansbj,t1_fcanouj,1577572935.0,I’ve heard nothing but good things about the gator. It’s low glide makes me wonder if it overlaps with my zone or not though. Any thoughts there?
discgolf,fcanfj1,t1_fcamjo6,1577572730.0,Thanks for the feedback! Any discs you would prefer in a spot over what I have maybe?
discgolf,fcanb2v,t1_fcamqk6,1577572655.0,"I’m looking to compare what other people prefer in similar spots, if there may be disc options I’ve overlooked for a shot that might work better for me, stuff like that. There’s a lot of different stuff out there and really all that happened is I’m trying to fill out my bag with the Discmania box I got for Xmas. These are literally all the discs I own, so I’m looking to see what discs I might be missing (like the comet suggestion)."

discgolf,fcamk48,t1_fc7uyhc,1577572217.0,"Most pros carry two of the same mold for putting, and I learned from Nate Sexton it’s good to carry a straighter, high glide, low fade putter for C2 tries that won’t hook as early in the flight (he uses a dart, so he also carries at least 3 putting putters)"
discgolf,fcamd68,t1_fc7ku8h,1577572101.0,"Firebird is exclusively for thumbers. It’s very flat, and the doombird is domey, so much better for throwing more traditionally.

The tern is very flippy and the DD is stable. 0/2 vs -3/1 I think

Teebird is in star, so it’s overstable, and the instinct is straight 

As for the second putter... got it for Xmas, and only use it for having two putters for practice and warm up"

discgolf,fc4y6fa,t1_fbww56y,1577433544.0,So some follow up if you don’t mind. Are you saying that the swim move/off arm should actively push backwards (relative to the forward momentum of the body) against the back thigh?

discgolf,fbv6m04,t1_fbv2x54,1577126374.0,"I’m aware the off arm should be tucked, but is it wrong to have the off arm tucked essentially the whole time. 

For instance, figure skaters for quicker rotation often start wide and pull in tight, they are not compact the entire time."
