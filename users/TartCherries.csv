DaDaABC,fdwo2s9,t3_en61z5,1578760722.0,"Here's what I wrote today... 

Dear student,
 Thank you for your hard work in this class!
1. Comprehensive Grade (A+, A, A-, B+); 

A++++ Great effort today!

2. Today we have learnt: (Key words/Phrases/Sentences/Big idea/Short stories/English song);

We learned about animals at the zoo!
You practiced reading and saying words like:
Lion, giraffe, monkey, elephant, panda

We counted the animals and practiced phrases like:
""I see five (5) monkeys.""
""There are two (2) giraffes.""
""The panda is black and white.""
""The elephant is big.""

3. Today you were good at:

Great work repeating after me and reading familiar animal names! You also participated like a star student today! 

4 . Where you need to improve:

You still find it difficult to read unfamiliar words. Try making the sound of the letters in the word to help you read the whole word. We will continue to work on expanding your vocabulary and your speaking skills. 

The way to learn English is to practice speaking it as often as possible. Keep practicing simple words and phrases. 
Hope to see you in next class soon!"

TwoXChromosomes,fd5x0gw,t3_ejyuic,1578182562.0," I want you to know that everything you are going through emotionally is OK. Never discredit your feelings. It's even OK to feel the shame and guilt. That's means you are human and a strong, loving woman who may just not be ready for children right now. And all of this is OK. We love you. I love you, because you shared your story and feelings. And one day when the time is right you will love being pregnant and your baby will love you for waiting. 

I hope I said the right thing to you.
I want to support you because I wish someone would've told me everything was OK and going to work out for the best in the end. And honestly, everything really did work put so I hope it will for you too."
