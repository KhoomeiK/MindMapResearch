Also when folks are this young, it makes sense to explore. Anyone can leave any relationship anytime for any reason. She wasn't ready to settle down. They'd been together since she was a literal teenager. I dunno. If I were still with the person I dated at 18? That would be a whole mess. She did actually kinda do the ex a favor, she wasn't ready to settle down and said so a few times. He deserves to be with someone who's 100% into being with him.

Her actions caused you so much harm, I can see how difficult it would be to get past all of that in order to be in her life. I agree with your assessment that this lackluster apology is too little too late. But it a doesn't matter what I think or what your friends think. It only matters that you've decided having her in your life causes you more harm. 

You should ask your friends to support your decision to not be involved in her life. You've been more than generous to her in this instant. I agree that she can't be held accountable for her actions as a child or for your parents actions- but she still benefits from being their straight kid and she's close to your abusive parents. She is willing to do very little to make amends, in my opinion. You've let her apologize and that was good of you. But you've decided to walk away from a painful past, and you're the one who survived it. You know what will and won't work for you. Ask those who love you to trust that you can make your own decisions. This isn't about forgiveness, precisely. It's about harm. Having her in your life would cause you more harm."

I mean yeah it would be great if she pitched in and helped out but some people just aren't into kids. I did a LOT of the work of raising my siblings and have chosen not to parent as an adult because I was tired of caretaking kids but the time I got to HS. At least the non kid wanting sister knows what she wants? Honestly, she's right. The kid isn't her responsibility. She shouldn't feel pressured or coerced to deal with her and might someday bc an ok aunt once the child is bigger. I mean, she's gotta live with a toddler who isn't hers. That's...a lot. I mean I get you, and in her place I'd have helped way more bc I actually like kids, I just don't want to parent any. But if she doesn't, it's really for the best that she not be forced to babysit. She's made it clear she doesn't want to deal with a little kid. Probably safer for the child to not try to leave her in the care of someone who's expressed that. If a guy did this, I don't think it'd be an actual post. Like maybe a fleeting, ""bro is kind of a jerk"" but not this level of thought. I don't think so anyway."

It's ok to not want to spend all that much time with your partner and his parents. I mean, if he had a group he did any specific activity with regularly it would be similar, right? Like you'd go once or twice to check it out and if it wasn't your thing you'd stop going? 

This is a normal adult thing to do. My wife has a group of friends who enjoy tabletop games. She has a few folks she practices DJing with. I have a queer comic book/graphic novel book group and a crafting buddy. We have different interests and we don't need to be in each other's pockets all the time. Sometimes wife and her elderly mother want to reminisce about things I don't have any experience with, I say, ""that's nice"" then I walk away.

In the past, I've wrestled with some anxiety/guilt about this and I've basically come to the conclusion that sometimes I need a little push and it's not a big deal.

AmItheAsshole,fdyynhl,t3_en96hc,1578784865.0,"ESH yeah that's probably not the best joke to make to a stranger but it seems like she's really doing a lot over what is essentially kinda awkward but harmless joke. The parents who don't drive me (a fantastic aunt but not a parent) up the wall are the parents who would've laughed at this. Like, that's cool, people parent but also toddlers are terrorists and can't we all laugh about that?"
actuallesbians,fdym9mz,t3_enc579,1578781285.0,"So like, to my mind, women who love women genuinely are way more into women than dudes who are just doing what's expected and following the norms. Not that tons of people aren't genuinely hetero, ofc plenty are but they don't have to overcome anything to get there. 

So I feel like wlw genuinely are way more into women than most het guys but get shamed for it bc the only model we have for attraction to women is super-predatory-but-fine-bc-dudes. So when we try to imagine a way to be attracted to women we presume it's like dudes when in fact it's totally different. It's like, ""imagine being so into women you'll overcome all the conditioning that says you can't be"" then, ""now add in you've been targeted by predatory dbags and you don't want to come off that way"" now multiply by, ""but literally you'd die for women bc they're amazing""

All of which is to say that yes the origin of predatory lesbian myth is based in cishet sickness and queerphobia but also women love other women more and better than most dudes ever could. I've tried to be friends with dudes and they'll almost always eventually complain that their GF takes too long to finish or is hard to please in bed and it's always like does not compute. GF wants more of fucking and you're....mad about it? Dudes are a trip."

AmItheAsshole,fdxz2eu,t3_en622s,1578774345.0,"YTA I was told as a kid that Jesus was always watching me so I used to pray asking him to look away so I could pee. I still got up to trouble but I just stayed hella paranoid and was eventually diagnosed with generalized anxiety. Now I'm not saying I have anxiety bc I was raised to believe in an omnipresent sky dude, but it really didn't help. Kids are already trying to make sense of a confusing world. I can see telling them things that are fun or magical like elves or unicorns are real but why would you tell them freaky, scary stuff like this?"

I can see how he was freaked and grasping at straws but again, do you see them patching it up? Cuz I don't. And she had some real shit to deal with that she can't just nope out of like he can. I just don't see a good place for that convo to go. Sure it's abrupt and she could've given him time to backtrack or explain but in the end he'd always be the guy who reacted that way. She was up against a ticking clock, I can see not having time to wait around for him to catch up. I mean, honestly, I'm not invested in someone else's situation that much but I think he showed his ass so thoroughly there's no coming back."

actuallesbians,fds4o9g,t3_emt13x,1578694275.0,"Statistically, straight women have the fewest orgasms and report the lowest satisfaction levels. So to me it's just another, ""oh for the confidence of a mediocre straight cis guy"". Generally these dudes aren't able to please a single woman, let alone more. Also kind of a stereotype but sorta true too about attractive women who date dudes that look like Mr potato head. Someone out there is into it, and God bless them. I think threesomes are overrated generally but if you're gonna do them, they're better with other queers."
