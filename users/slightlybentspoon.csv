Everyone in my life has at least once called me inconsiderate, missing appointments, forgetting to put things back, etc. Which I cannot express how untrue that is. I am a thoughtful caring person,  and I am empathetic. it keeps me up at night if I think I hurt someone's feelings. I finally saw a therapist for other reasons and he referred me to a phycyatrust and I didint even really know why. At first I said no way, got a second opinion and yeah. ADHD.  It all makes sense now too, even thinking back to how  I was as a child."

Advice,fe62hgt,t3_enrf6h,1578880308.0,"Hi! 

I hope your doing okay, i know you are probably very scared.  I think you should tell your parents, they might be upset with you but this is a big thing to go through alone.  You are young, you have alot of learning, alot of places to see and things to do. And alot of time to have babies and do adult things, please enjoy your youth and what time you have left of being your age.. I had an abortion when i was 19, and it was not scary.  Everyone there was so nice, and so welcoming and comforting.  It was the best decision i ever made, and i think it will be yours too.   I wish you the absolute best of luck!"
