pelotoncycle,fep3egp,t1_fefbzco,1579311244.0,I’d suggest watching Christine’s video on adjusting your bike and making sure it’s all set up correctly. Then I would do yoga after.

pelotoncycle,fcobo4f,t1_fco0l4l,1577828308.0,That’s extraordinarily kind. Thank you.
pelotoncycle,fcnryg9,t1_fcnrdcb,1577817290.0,"It’s a turn toward negativity in general. It used to be more of a safe and familial atmosphere, now you’d better be ready to fight."
pelotoncycle,fcnkzph,t1_fcnjm6t,1577813563.0,You’re always welcome at my party.
pelotoncycle,fcnhpjk,t1_fcnfvsh,1577811941.0,"I appreciate this gracious response. Thank you. I’ve deleted a few posts that have spiraled out of control, to save the mods having to jump in. I just hate seeing senseless complaining when there are so many options that this bike provides."
pelotoncycle,fcnhi0o,t1_fcnfwpq,1577811817.0,"Yet, almost everything I’ve posted, I’ve gotten a nasty gram that it should be in the daily discussion thread. I’m not crapping on the mods, there’s just a different vibe. I’ve gotten so much support and information from this group and it just seems to have turned a corner. And it could be me, I’ll own that too."
pelotoncycle,fcndydr,t3_ei1jbi,1577809700.0,I’m feeling a little disconnected from this group and it makes me sad. The tone is turning into OPP :/
pelotoncycle,fcndt9d,t1_fcmuhza,1577809606.0,"I think what we lose in this context is the perspective of what peloton is building. They WANT personality. It’s what makes them unique. It’s part of their brand. Sharing and being open and vulnerable is what the brand breeds. The fact of the matter is, no one can please everyone. This didn’t and doesn’t offend me, because it makes me understand her better and I like that. Good thing there are so many instructors to choose from, some who never delve this deep. It’s all about preference, but I refuse to say she was wrong, just because some people didn’t like it."
pelotoncycle,fcmiasa,t1_fcl5zg1,1577776385.0,"I disagree. I want someone to connect. I want a human being on that bike, showing me that humanity is the goal. She isn’t unprofessional, or inappropriate, simply a person. I don’t want a sanitized autobot."
aww,fcj53hk,t3_ehb706,1577677484.0,This is so wholesome and adorable.
pelotoncycle,fcj4kp9,t3_eheczs,1577677122.0,How dare she be human and share her human experience. The nerve.
UnsentLetters,fc499h8,t3_efv3v2,1577410091.0,This makes me want to be the best mom possible for my kid. I wish I could give you a hug.

funny,fc492vr,t3_eg46w8,1577409945.0,I think I love him.
