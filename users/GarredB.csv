Thanks again for all the advice."
TEFL,ffcfet0,t1_ffcf9sa,1579798289.0,"It depends on your company. Some pay for your medical, others say they'll reimburse you and never will. Very few companies even contribute in your stead as well.

But I'll definitely make sure about the contributions. Apparently tax also increases during your second year?"
TEFL,ffcci31,t1_ffcbvpy,1579796488.0,"Thanks for that. I know Japan works rather differently. I've only been to China and they often don't pay medical insurance, pensions, or anything else for that matter. I was lucky that my company at least helped me with tax, so I want to make sure I'm as good as can be when I'm on my way to Japan.

I won't mind moving on to another company once I'm there, but I do know I'm slightly limited."
TEFL,ffbp4a0,t1_ffb0rqe,1579776668.0,"I have tried r/teachinginjapan but have received no reply yet and I can't wait very long right now. 

It does seem a bit too good to be true, and as per the brochure they say they will pay for communiting, health and other similar expenses, but I'll be paying for my own housing in Tokyo/Osaka. How true this is, is up for debate. 

Anything you can tell me that I should keep a lookout for? I've generally avoided all the companies that have terrible reputations such as NOVA,  but this one I can't really pinpoint given that the only review I've found on glassdoor is a 5 start one and it seems to sing the company's praises too highly. Which is another thing making me skeptical. 

I do know I have to make sure I don't get a dispatch or contractor contract to sign if I make it,  but what will set these contracts apart from the one I'm supposed to get? I doubt such information is readily available on the internet after all.

And thanks for the extra pair of eyes. I appreciate it. I'm used to dealing with Chinese companies,  but not Japanese ones."

I've applied to a number of companies including Interact, British Council, and a few others found on Jobsinjapan and Ohaiyosensei, however, this company was the first company to get back to me, even if I did apply on a whim.

I've looked online, on various reviews websites, and even looked at their website itself, but haven't really found any reviews for them. So, is there anyone that can tell me a bit more about them or what it might be like working for them?

The contract conditions don't exactly seem too bad either. 20-30 hours a week, 5 days a week, around 3000 per hour with health insurance and training. Additionally, if I am able to get the job I'll be teaching ""company executives"".

cscareerquestions,feia7jo,t3_epb0qn,1579133762.0,"One step in front of the other makes a mile. 

Things seems overwhelming, but the way they teach it often makes the entire process seem easy.  You will struggle with things, but continual hard work will lead to the result you want. 

I can only say that to try and speed up the process and ensure you really understand what's going on is: prep for classes by at least partially understanding what your classes will teach,  practice often, and more important than most wish to believe take a break when you need it. 

PS: there is no person that know every language you know perfectly.  Stackoverflow has carried out a study (or some one else based on stackoverflow.  I forget) and even senior programmers only know 5 languages fluently.  Some 6,  but the average is 5.

PPS: when you see opportunities to work with your professors,  or even internships,  apply for them.  You'll learn most of what you'll need during this time, and you'll make the professional connections you'll need for at least your first job. 

edit: added in some extra advice about internships."

digitalnomad,fe0bs3t,t1_fe0axit,1578809014.0,"I agree.  Think of normal application coding as requiring math up to Highschool level.  With more and more specialized fields requiring more math.  

For example machine learning needs probabilities and linear algebra as well as some other statistical formulas to achieve the effect. 

Grame Design,  depending on where you fall,  engine design etc, you'll need more linear math and some times even calculus.  For implementing things like ray tracing you'll need even more math. 

It just depends on the field in the industry you're looking at."

Fedora,fdst507,t1_fdss8ap,1578707603.0,Thanks.  I knew I was missing something there.  I was using Rawhide some time ago but switched to the released Fedora due to the need for more stability at the current juncture. So I probably got them confused there.
Fedora,fdsptid,t1_fdsolp7,1578706382.0,"Fesora is a rolling release - as far as I know and unless things have changed from a  few years ago. What makes Fedora special is that it is entirely based on the ''no proprietary software'' goal for computing. That's why installing non-free software is such a hassle - or at least more difficult than usual. 

This is but one of the things that make it great.  

It's also a curator model.  Up until recently (somewhere late last year)  Fedora was upstream to CentOS and Red Hat's server OS RHEL.  So everything they wanted to implement in that was first tested on Fedora,  then further optimized for CentOS and fed back into Fedora,  and then even further improved and optimized for RHEL.  So the attention it got was understandable.  If you're looking for something more Ubuntu-like, you can always have a look at those versions downstream or which share similar views, such as Mint, Manjaro, and PopOS, I believe?

cpp_questions,fd20h66,t1_fcyno02,1578139729.0,"Most people don't take the time to read licenses.  I was one of them.  Quite a few people I worked with for a while in College had no idea that you can create Qt programs on GPLv3 and still sell it, or charge for it without getting the Commercial Qt License. So many think they need to pay the commercial price to create commercial programs which is incorrect. The GPLv3 has a clause which allows it. 

Another reason is that to create most programs in Qt you'll need either GPLv2 - but this doesn't allow for all the functionality that Qt provides, or GPLv3, which allow most of Qts Libraries.  Sadly, many people don't want to publish their code under GPL at all, since if you use a library that is GPL in your code, you'll need to make yours GPL as well.
