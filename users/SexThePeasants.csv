IdiotsInCars,ff7ldlp,t1_ff6nlof,1579652313.0,"I prefer driving in cities. When people do stupid shit, they at least have a goal. Stupid shit in small towns is caused by then dropping their phone or putting on makeup or brushing their teeth."
trashy,ff6uclh,t1_ff6nn35,1579635056.0,Oh shit. Totally meant to have sex.
facepalm,fezp62n,t1_fezov1v,1579459917.0,"Most definitely. Just a suggestion of a possibility, I don't buy it myself."
facepalm,fezfksz,t1_feyr2rr,1579456841.0,"Maybe it's just a typo. ""I'm a Black"" like ""I'm a Rockefeller"""
BoomersBeingFools,fezeimu,t1_fe53kps,1579456529.0,I wouldn't even know where to start with explaining this. There's some nice graphs out there that spatially demonstrate how impossible that is. But she couldn't read them.
BoomersBeingFools,fezdn02,t3_eoc6to,1579456247.0,Ugh fuck this guy. It's an atrocity that anyone would listen to a damn thing he has to say. Like... The information is so readily available. You have to almost be trying to be naive to miss it.
BoomersBeingFools,fezdaa0,t3_epr8r6,1579456148.0,"Yes, don't utilize the things available to you. Wonder if he knows his parents probably only had one car for the family."
BoomersBeingFools,fezcvn2,t3_eq4pc4,1579456004.0,This is indeed insane. Boomers are literally the world culprits of lower 3 and pollution since trash services became a thing. Definitely living in an idyllic memory that never actually existed.
Whatcouldgowrong,few7ui3,t1_few4nmk,1579406608.0,Don't see the problem. Fix the problem in 9 months? Great. Never solve the problem? Then it's going to take longer than jail.
Mccafferty,few4ls5,t3_elo3xj,1579405280.0,"Yes, sans Hollywood Undead."
tifu,fepnq73,t1_feouvzc,1579325440.0,And those States have the worst problems!
Whatcouldgowrong,fep8b9e,t1_fedyyu7,1579314392.0,Thanks for the clarification. Seems obvious in retrospect.
insanepeoplefacebook,fep8799,t1_feoruhw,1579314321.0,"""Guns don't give hickies, I give hickies"".


The reasoning in the post is silly. But yes, for real don't wildly shoot. Big problem in Florida. As I recall from physics class, it's even worse if it's not directly upwards."
insaneparents,fem1wu9,t3_eppgap,1579237073.0,This is not acceptable for 2020. We've got to collectively stop embracing all the stupid shit that happens to us and by us.
trashy,feeio7b,t1_fee2ns0,1579034531.0,"Most of the terms are horrible. A few weeks ago I came across (and I don't fully recall) ""fat ma""."

AskReddit,fe6bh5c,t1_fe5gtlr,1578886191.0,So many! I don't understand why. My mother gets more people but less creeps giving her their life stories as well.
legaladvice,fe6bcb9,t1_fdh5206,1578886093.0,"Definitely seems like a valid reason. But kind of a shady hook. The people they're insuring often won't be able to make the payments at the point they need the insurance most. Like this example, or any hospitalization."
RedditsMuseumofFilth,fe4hx8i,t1_fe2ric3,1578859514.0,Share some weird morning fascinating stuff!
AskReddit,fe4ga3z,t1_fe42zf5,1578859020.0,"All good, because that statement made us friends."

AskReddit,fe493ez,t3_enpz15,1578856933.0,"Jury is still out if my toe was also broken, but it would have been my big toe when I stepped into the side of a lawnmower. It was summer and I was wearing heavy winter boots for some reason. Which probably saved my toe and/or a large portion of my foot."
AskReddit,fe48g41,t1_fdzu0z5,1578856775.0,"I wasn't either. Joined the GoT game pretty late, with no prior knowledge. Legit didn't sleep. And on a Sunday night!"
AskReddit,fe3r6vi,t1_fe3hnnb,1578852067.0,What States are those? When I was younger I've definitely rocked the occasional road soda but it was certainly illegal. Plus I was underage at the time.
AskReddit,fe3crvm,t3_enlq40,1578848104.0,"Anything tone-deaf to the fact we just met. How many times you got laid in Iceland? Not something to tell me about in the first hour of knowing you. I'm not the audience for that unless we're actually friends.


This happens to me so often. I have a face that makes people want to over-share for some reason."
AskReddit,fe0ioub,t1_fdzslgv,1578814007.0,It's an unpleasant end to a pleasant act.
AskReddit,fe0564m,t1_fdzzdqy,1578803331.0,Wash that damn beer! Were you raised in a barn or something?
AskReddit,fe04540,t1_fdznfxh,1578802613.0,"Definitely. Hell, this should have public service announcements about. And billboards!"
AskReddit,fdzrnx0,t1_fdzb19r,1578794202.0,"Wholeheartedly agree. On the ends of the spectrum, my enthusiasm wanes. But I've never been like""nah, she's gross"" and bailed because of size of those parts."
AskReddit,fdzrikh,t1_fdzkufy,1578794106.0,"Expecting, feeling owed, or optimistic? I'm always optimistic about it (good dates only). But I never feel owed. Very few people in the world ever owe you anything."

HumansBeingBros,fdqhr9p,t1_fdqh4vm,1578666982.0,Who are pretty common in bars in my experience.
HumansBeingBros,fdqhods,t1_fdqfnhf,1578666924.0,"I don't think that would really do much. Go to any heavily trafficked bar area, night club, etc. There's so many people, doing so much weird stuff. No one's going to be able to keep track that of all that."
trashy,fdo4evr,t1_eznfpj8,1578598698.0,More from Chicago checking in. This phrase is unknown to me.

mildlyinfuriating,fdfmh5h,t1_fdeqnog,1578365111.0,"Given the fact that those type of pencils are in use, solid chance it's grade school and whipping out a knife for any reason is gonna get you expelled in this scenario."
worldnews,fdb059d,t1_fdat05r,1578252281.0,Your words won my vote against him. But it was always that way. Just not a good anything.
therewasanattempt,fdakp9t,t1_fd9jqp2,1578247133.0,"Woah woah woah. Definitely NOT as much freshwater. Water molecules, sure. But I'm sure you don't know what freshwater means after that statement."
Iwidkhtr,fd6j658,t1_fd327np,1578191846.0,There's some follow-ups. Way less graphic but really cements the reality of the situation. Can't find them though.
science,fd4kkhy,t1_fd37o5y,1578168396.0,War On Drugs was always and continues to be a failure. No upsides to it other than DEA pensions.
NeckbeardNests,fd43820,t3_ejzkln,1578163976.0,I like that the bathroom has a couple glass bottles. This guy was really treating himself while brushing his teeth or something.
