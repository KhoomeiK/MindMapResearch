stopsmoking,fe5a0fx,t1_fe598rr,1578866936.0,Omg I'm dumb sorry. I didn't see the r/stopsmoking
stopsmoking,fe596xb,t1_fe5895o,1578866735.0,"You wrote ""my girlfriend wants me to quit"" and ""my mother and sister want me to quit"" so what do you mean by quit?"
stopsmoking,fe581lv,t3_enu5tz,1578866441.0,Wtf..They want to see you quit? You mean die? Sorry for asking dumb questions but I'm concerned
socialanxiety,fdscq3y,t1_fds3zhy,1578699629.0,thanks for letting me know
socialanxiety,fdrp1wh,t3_emviph,1578687651.0,Do you wanna talk about it? (Maybe not here tho)
socialanxiety,fdk6kcy,t3_elt7qg,1578497230.0,"Hey, I completely understand you. It's really hard to go to school..And even harder when you miss a lot, I do that too and pretend I'm sick so I can stay home..yeah it doesn't solve anything but at least you avoid it for some time. Everyday in school is a battle..Mind if I ask how long are you missing? And what did you say to your mom?"
socialanxiety,fcwdv6c,t3_ej94vh,1578023142.0,"I just want to not give af about what others think and be myself but it's like everyone already knows you as quiet and it'd be weird to not be like that..i'm tired of it all, I don't want the way others see me to define me. This is not who I'm..I could have friends, we all could but we're so scared and overthink everything. I want people to talk with me but when they do I'm awkward and distance myself, like whyy I know everyone has their own problems and I'm not the center of the universe but I feel like everyone judges me all the time, i'm so embarrased of my life..just leave us alone social anxiety"
socialanxiety,fcw93v5,t3_ej870q,1578019977.0,"Seriously I couldn't go anywhere without phone, not because I'm addicted etc. (Even tho I kinda am lol) but bc I'm always pretending to do something on phone to protect me from awkwardness, and ofc I turn brightness low and basically do nothing bc I fear people will look even tho no one gives af. glad I'm not alone"
socialanxiety,fcw7tsn,t3_ej8for,1578019131.0,"Same, I was in that situation not too long ago and it was uncomfortable af..literally to the point if I knew about it I would do anything to avoid it. Wish I knew how to deal with this but sadly it's not something you can just get rid of, well depends if this happens a lot to you. Then maybe over time you could get used to it somehow..but tbh I don't think (at least for me) it will ever go away. Just remember a lot of people feel this way even if they don't show it and seem fine, it's natural. I know it's very hard but you should be proud of yourself that you handle it, you're stronger than your anxiety!"
