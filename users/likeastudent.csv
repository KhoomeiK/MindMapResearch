nursing,fel66vz,t1_fej4t9r,1579214911.0,Yeah we don't give them a ride they go on their own two legs.
nursing,fel650c,t3_epeulv,1579214880.0,Don't let the door hit you on the way out cause we don't want you back!
chrome,fel50gh,t1_fel21y9,1579214193.0,yep my adblock has crashed twice already and I've cleared cookies yet a couple of sites I can't access unless I am in incognito mode. This is a mess.
depression,fekn7qq,t3_epiyby,1579203556.0,All the time. Especially as I drive. I daydream and fantasize a lot. I'd rather live in my mind than in reality.

nursing,fe6g2qg,t3_enjnqf,1578889824.0,You are all lucky there is nothing good to look at where I work.
PublicFreakout,fdttruw,t3_emwd3r,1578722075.0,Such a huge fucking car.
nursing,fdscyum,t1_fds6jbs,1578699795.0,Exactly I love the science. I love learning about the human body and all the terrible things that can happen to it. I like looking at wounds. I like learning medication names. But the whole having to talk to so many people everyday is overwhelming for an introvert like me who barely likes talking to anyone in her free time.
nursing,fdsc82i,t3_emwmy6,1578699282.0,Hm well I actually would have liked to have become a nurse as soon as I got out of high school knowing what I know now. I would have a nice amount of money saved up in the bank and would probably be a manager/director by now. I would have more than 10 years experience. Having said that the past 3 years of nursing have contained some of the most stressful/anxious moments of my working life and I dread going to work every time but hey I have to do something huh? I am not a talented person and studying is hard for me because my mind constantly wanders.
nursing,fdsbxbx,t1_fds442k,1578699077.0,Oh jeez I wouldn't even know how to check that.

AskReddit,fdfpe80,t3_el2az5,1578367030.0,I am watching 90 day fiance... ugh no thanks they can keep their 600k.
AskReddit,fd6ty20,t1_fd3zhaw,1578195671.0,I don't know what you mean. I work at a hospital and most of the patients have their doors wide open with the exception of those with TB or other airborne diseases. I guess more people would get TB.  In our ER there are no doors you either get a tiny room with a curtain or a stretcher in the hallway.
AskReddit,fd6t93q,t3_ek07fx,1578195425.0,I'd panic.
depression,fd3l62j,t1_fd31xmx,1578159348.0,Lol this is kinda true the few times I have gone to parties I can't wait to fuck off and just stand there looking awkward getting drunk by myself.
depression,fd3kiq1,t3_ejvcf6,1578159142.0,Yeah me neither. I hate when celebs says they never got to be a teenager. Well neither do I and I don't have enough money to retire on when I am still in my twenties! Like cry me a river.
nursing,fczqeyn,t1_fczbpri,1578106795.0,"I have such a terrible concept of them. I really wouldn't mind paying sticker price at this point for a car I want but the thought that I am giving some jerk the satisfaction of ""lol this dumb woman"" and adding to his paycheck drives me crazy so I have been postponing the inevitable as much as I can. I wish their were more female car sales people and car dealership owners."
nursing,fczq0av,t3_ejid5a,1578106578.0,"A car salesman huh? I am looking to buy a car any tips? Also, you are not overreacting he's a jerk."
nursing,fcy8xeg,t1_fcxl0wl,1578076510.0,I mean you when you work a three day week there are ways of scheduling it like that if you put in a couple of pto.
AskReddit,fcshj4h,t1_fcqq5ni,1577916653.0,Basically the bare minimum.
AskReddit,fcqcj97,t3_eic8yl,1577883306.0,No eight years is not long enough. I don't want to go through the past 5 years of nursing school/nursing again.
AskReddit,fcpf3e4,t1_fcogugj,1577861220.0,This reminds me of that one scene in stranger things.
AskReddit,fcc9l2q,t3_egtceb,1577595904.0,I have a lot of chest pain but this is normal for me. A few years back I had the same thing and was told it was just costochondritis/gerd I must be having a flare up.
nursing,fcc67b9,t1_fcbfcs7,1577594869.0,honestly that makes me feel worse.
depression,fc2omti,t3_eftotg,1577369295.0,I know this sounds cliched as hell but living well is the best revenge. Forget about the fucking bullies from your past. I know its hard I still remember the crap they would say about my appearance from time to time but I have learned to love those defects in my looks. You have to look inward and do what you need to do to improve yourself/your life and this is the way to begin loving yourself and forgetting the past.
depression,fc2ncgp,t3_efqogm,1577368008.0,Exactly. Me and my dad are going through this right now. I hate my well paying job and every day that I have to go to it is a struggle for me mentally but it pays my bills and for frivolous things I want. My dad didn't have any work this week because of the holidays. Since they don't get many orders during this time at his restaurant. He's worried and hates not having shifts because it means less money for him and he is a person who lives paycheck to paycheck basically. Life just sucks no matter what.

depression,fbzvskl,t3_ef4960,1577264270.0,I didn't buy a tree this year. Last year I kept my tree till about March because of stupid anxiety. Didn't want to go through that again.
nursing,fbw233w,t1_fbtwwea,1577139453.0,But then you gotta deal with a-hole doctors.
nursing,fbw1sd7,t3_eefjt1,1577139303.0,I mean she could be referring to the doctor. At the end of the day you don't take shit like this personally. Honestly it makes me laugh when they say something like this because they are usually the ones who won't lift a finger to take care of their own family.
nursing,fbtwgc4,t3_eee8uc,1577099547.0,"It's been like that for us but honestly *knocks on wood* I haven't ever been written up. Perhaps cause management is very lax one of the reasons I do not want to quit to move to a ""better"" hospital."
personalfinance,fbtqe0a,t1_fbr5xom,1577090257.0,lol I thought the same thing. Honestly I don't adult in an aspect of my life but at least I don't have an s.o. and don't have kids.
sex,fbnu08n,t3_edvtsv,1577003230.0,Physically attracted it's been years lol. I don't get out much.
nursing,fbkmrsu,t3_edinzm,1576952687.0,Move elsewhere?
nursing,fbkmbuk,t1_fbjvfsb,1576952504.0,Damn. lol
nursing,fbkmat4,t3_edpoob,1576952492.0,"Yeah I don't care for that neither. I understand that some people like to share their sadness and the passing of their loved ones is both hard emotionally and financially, but I personally would not share my personal sadness to anyone at work and I don't. Also, there is a fund set up in my hospital for situations just like those where you can apply and get money for when you are in need of it."
AskReddit,fbkhzgq,t3_edphvy,1576950657.0,Drink.
nursing,fb2icrp,t3_eaq2dx,1576451588.0,I love money ngl I only wished I loved the profession just as much. :/ At this point I don't feel up to studying anything else in another field.
