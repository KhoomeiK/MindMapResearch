If you want to sell to the low-middle class demographic, then I would make your art into mass-produced formats that such people can buy without much hesitation. Etsy artists seem to be doing well nowadays/for the past few years."

However, a man's body may contain more muscle and less body fat, making the masculine body less of a flowing curve, and more of a series of lines, angles, and jutting muscles.

This girl in middle school totally called me her boyfriend whenever she saw me. Unfortunately, we rode the bus together too. And she and her little group of friends would giggle and laugh at me while whispering and watching me on the bus. ""Hiiiii, boyfriend. Omg, he's so cute,"" I remember her saying that to her friends. The girl even wrote me a ""love letter"" in a pink envelope with a heart sticker on it (I threw it out of the window as soon as I got it lol, so I never read it). I ended up moving and switching schools a few weeks later (not because of the bullying, my parents just decided to move). Good for me because I dreaded going to school every morning with those girls.

Well, actually now that I think of it.. was it really bullying? Maybe she really liked me...?! But I don't know. It felt threatening/like bullying at the time though. LOL (btw I'm straight, but I just liked/still like dressing more boyishly sometimes.)

(Edit - I know this is about bullying special needs people, but I just thought my story was a little similar. )"

Now I'm 25, so I'm back to living in my hometown of Disney World. I haven't ridden a roller coaster in this entire time frame that I was gone, but my sister had recently gotten a job that gave her free Disney passes, so we all went to Animal Kingdom.

 We all decided to ride the Everest roller coaster. In my head I thought, ""I used to ride this roller coaster all the time when I was younger, so it's no big deal, I'm not scared."" Well, as soon as we got to the peak (the part where you can literally see all of the park), I covered my eyes and thought to myself, ""I cannot wait for this moment to be over.""It was 2 minutes of absolute hell!

While I was unwrapping them, the paintings ended up sticking to the bubble wrap because I didn't let them cure properly. Good thing I hadn't shipped them yet, crisis avoided. Let them sit for a week or two after you're done painting them.

ArtistLounge,fckqslv,t1_fckhxsc,1577731182.0,"Yeah, I totally get that. I think what I'm trying to say is that in a lot of cases, it wouldn't matter to people whether or not they're genetically predisposed to be good at art. If it's a hobby, then it matters even less because you're doing it for sport, and not necessarily aiming towards skill or mastery or an occupation.

 I also never really a fan of the ""hours"" concept, because when it comes to art, a large part of those hours are spent studying/observing/workshopping/taking notes, and not directly making art. Because of that, it's really hard to log those hours, and I would even cut those hours in half in most artists' cases."
ArtistLounge,fckg0b7,t3_ehnln6,1577724493.0,"I think it depends on if the artist wanted to be independent, or employed by a corporation or company. Since many artists don't necessarily need to possess artistic skill in order to be successful, I would say that it didn't matter.  Matty Mo (""the most famous artist"") is a good example of this. 

But if this concept artist wanted to create work for a corporation, to create concepts of a product/movie/show/car/video game/etc.,then they need to put in the hours, to make a solid portfolio, in order to work at said corporation and be successful."

ArtistLounge,fc64lxs,t1_fc5tqos,1577472151.0,"Yeah, I would totally say digital illustration is a niche! In terms of digital art, there are a lot of different niches - digital collage, digital illustration, digital comics, digital landscape painting, digital portrait, pixel art, etc. And digital illustration is a really growing niche. (Although a lot of people also confuse digital art with graphic design, which is basically for commercial purposes (package design, logo design, marketing design, photo editing, etc). )

I would say that since anime is mostly digital in this day and age, anime is technically it's own niche, since it's filled with so many artistic genre's of it's own (slice of life style, shounen style, shojo style, chibi/kawaii, manga/webtoons, etc). 

However, you can definitely fuse digital illustration with anime art. Actually, since ""real"" anime technically has to come from ethnically Japanese mangaka/animators, it's pretty hard to make authentic anime images unless you're from there.  But a lot of artists draw in the anime style - for example, meyoco, who is an Indonesian artist.

Having a niche is great, because it helps you focus your artwork and art style, and it makes your Instagram and social media pages look 200% better!"
