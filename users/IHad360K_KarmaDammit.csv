comicstriphistory,ffe4ue6,t1_ff9ciqk,1579836735.0,"Accidental Ambassador Gordo is a good book. It's mostly about the strip's cultural impact, but it does reprint some longer storylines."
comicstriphistory,ff7bkg7,t3_es2596,1579645622.0,"Gordo started in 1941, and was written by Gus Arriola. The main character was initially a stereotypically lazy Mexican farmer until Arriola (who was of Mexican descent, but had never actually been to Mexico) realized that his character was literally the only Mexican in pop culture and made him a more sympathetic character.

The strip is often credited with popularizing terms like ""hasta la vista"" and ""adios"" in the US, and also featured recipes that introduced many Mexican dishes to an English-speaking audience.

Also, Charles Schulz, creator of Peanuts, called it ""probably the most beautifully drawn strip in the history of the business."""

Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure the DVD also had a video of the members of Monty Python reading negative reviews of the movie in high-pitched, sarcastic voices."
todayilearned,ff427tf,t3_erjiki,1579553941.0,"This is also the same reason they used the coconuts to make horse sounds. They originally planned to use real horses, but didn't have enough money for them. The coconut sound effects were a common thing in old radio shows, which is where they got the idea."
comicstriphistory,fe61h0i,t1_fe5x3c3,1578879664.0,"It wasn't so much that I found the term ""slave"" racist as that it seemed weird to use it in a context completely unrelated to race. I mean, when I see ""slave"" in a book, the connotation it makes me (and, I would guess, most Americans) think of is the slave system in America before the Civil War. It just seems weird that, in a time when that era would have been within living memory, the word apparently didn't have that connotation.

You're right about some of McCay's work being racist, and that's a real pity, too. This is an absolutely beautiful comic aimed at children, and yet a lot of it is racist enough that you probably shouldn't show it to actual children."
comicstriphistory,fe5rj4x,t1_fe5ouew,1578873582.0,"Google Images. I'm not scanning these myself or anything, I just find them online, mostly from archive.org.

That said, the strips look a lot better at full size in a physical book--the Sunday Press reprint series is supposed to be good, although I haven't had a chance to read them. I've seen a few reprinted in various books on comics history in general that I own, though, and they look way better in print than they do on a screen."
comicstriphistory,fe5d7z6,t3_enuf48,1578867952.0,"The girl Nemo is talking with here is the Princess of Slumberland; the first nine months of the strip revolved around Nemo trying to reach the palace on the orders of the princess because she wanted a friend, only to wake up before finding her each time. At this point in the strip, he had reached the palace, and she had become a regular character. Unlike Nemo, she's used to the dream logic of Slumberland, so many of the things that she sees as normal activities to do with her new friend are bizarre and impossible for him to understand.

I like this strip because it features something I've occasionally had in my own dreams; the promise of something happening (here, it's the acrobats' performance) that's interrupted by my waking up.

Another interesting thing here is that the princess calls the mermaids her ""slaves"". I've seen the word used that way in multiple Little Nemo comics, usually to refer to some magical creature that has been summoned (in the same way that the genie in Aladdin is the ""slave of the lamp""). It's weird that, only about forty years after the Civil War, the word ""slave"" wouldn't have made people think of, you know, literal slaves, especially since there were probably a good number of former slaves still alive in 1906."

comicstriphistory,fd3tilm,t3_ek00fh,1578161504.0," The part at the bottom, Wonder-Land, is a topper strip--although this one is educational, some others were about the technology seen in the more sci-fi storylines. Sometimes, it featured Dr. Chrono (the old man in the first panel) talking about their adventures to a little girl who, according to that ever-reliable source of ""I'm sure I read this somewhere but now I can't find it"", was the daughter of the strip's creator. 

There are a bunch more of these [here](https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search?q=connie), including a storyline where Connie travels to the year 2938 and is immediately put in charge of half the world's military. Interestingly, a comment there from Art Lortie (who is, according to a quick Google search, a writer for The Comics Journal) claims that he once had a website with scans of around eight years of the comic. I don't know if it would have been saved by the Wayback Machine, since the post is from 2007 and he implies the website was older than that.

todayilearned,fcz4crq,t3_ejnir9,1578093411.0,"According to the geographer Pausanias:

>For when he was contending for the wild olive with the last remaining competitor, whoever he was, the latter got a grip first, and held Arrhachion, hugging him with his legs, and at the same time he squeezed his neck with his hands. Arrhachion dislocated his opponent's toe, but expired owing to suffocation; but he who suffocated Arrhachion was forced to give in at the same time because of the pain in his toe. The Eleans crowned and proclaimed victor the corpse of Arrhachion.

According to John Cleese, he was taught this story in school, with the moral being that as long as you don't give up, you can't lose. He thought that was dumb, and made the Black Knight as a parody of Arrichion.

AskReddit,fcz175j,t3_ejmy67,1578091631.0,"Bagpipes. To quote Thomas Pynchon:

Can you imagine how unsettling that may've been? Not as a Wild Creature in the night, for ev'ry Beast must roar, yet draw Breath--whilst this...comes swelling, invisible, resistless.

comicstriphistory,fcyl3da,t3_ejkozd,1578081983.0,"A bit of backstory on what's going on here: Connie and her friends are searching for a lost city in South America. Connie is the blond girl, and the main character of the strip. The old man in the first panel is Dr. Chrono, a scientist--not the ""academic researcher"" sort of scientist, more the ""build a time machine and let his 19-year-old neighbor go to the future for fun"" type. The other guy is Jack, who you'd probably assume is supposed to be Connie's boyfriend or at least a romantic interest, except that they don't really talk to each other and both have the personality of a brick. He seems to hand around purely so that there's a third character.

The bit at the bottom, Wonder-Land, is a topper strip--although this one is educational, some others were about the technology seen in the more sci-fi storylines.
