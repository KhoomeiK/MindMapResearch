AskReddit,ffc6p79,t3_esps5n,1579792799.0,"In all seriousness and this is going to sound insane to some and I am aware of that but hear me out first before you saying anything.

Did you see the movie The Mist? If not let me give you the shortest rundown of it. The government starts doing experiments revolving around other dimensions and guess what they get into things they can't handle. Now that is obviously a movie and not real but the idea of a government messing with otherworldly things is closer to reality.

Aliens are one thing and something we could probably fight off somehow one day. I'm more worried about what would happen if we did make contact with something from a dimension that is higher then ours.

If things like a 4-D (we are apparently in a 3-Dimension) somehow overlap with us or get into ours and we can't see them. What could they do to us?

\-----------

I like to make theories about these things or hypothetical situations. For example: Remove what you think about Biblical anything for a moment whether you believe or do not believe it does not apply to what comes next here.

What could a bunch of humans possibly do to fight off monsters (demons) who outmatch us in strength and numbers?  They are larger, have a higher pain tolerance and thicker skin. What do fleshy humans have against them?

Apply that to what I said above about the 4-D beings. If we can not see them but they can see us what can we do?"

TooAfraidToAsk,ff3lm82,t1_ff3kcmo,1579543665.0,"What I have experienced is a dating culture that seems very based on sexual compatibility. That does matter to a degree but there is more to a relationship then just having sex because if that’s all you have it’s not a good thing. If you look to sex for a big indication in a relationship you may be pushing out a person who really may care for you. 

I’m not repulsed by sex I need to really get to know a person before I try anything with them and have a connection with them. 

I think that in society now that sex is more of a norm it may push people out a little who don’t want it. I also believe there should be more opportunities for people who are on the Asexual and Aromantic scales to meet others like themselves or similar to them.
Even if you don’t believe in using the labels people should be able to find people like themselves.
