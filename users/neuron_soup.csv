math,ff45k7f,t3_er6jum,1579556024.0,"I told this to my math professor for Honors Calculus 3. I was good with proofs and understanding concepts, but when it came time to actually do a triple integral or another problem with moving parts, I’d inevitably mess up. He told me this uncomfortable truth:

“All masters of abstract math first master computational math.”

So that shut me up."

college,fez9qwh,t1_fez6vjm,1579455103.0,"Alright. Then I’d suggest pacing yourself and creating a schedule. How are your study habits? Do you waste time, slack off, etc? If you’re 100% serious about this, you’ll have to make compromises that you won’t like short-term"
college,fez33px,t3_eqnxsc,1579453437.0,"I’m also an NYU freshman. I didn’t exactly have fun my first semester (major depression), so this sentiment is totally normal. Frequent calls to the wellness exchange and whatnot. The way I see it, I think I’m a school as big as this there’s a place for everyone, even me. The city can be isolating and daunting, but I’d recommend giving it one more chance. A lot of people find their niche in second semester. The first semester is generally a transition period.

Also depending on your major, transferring out might not be the best idea. PM me if you have any more questions. You’ll do great!"

math,fe8ldxe,t3_eo1o8e,1578927502.0,"You seem to have fallen into a feedback loop of sorts:

You are “bad” at math, so you avoid doing it because it brings you anxiety. As a result, your skills become rusty, so math becomes even harder for you.

The *idea* that you’re bad at math is probably what’s actually making you bad at math.

Unfortunately, impostor syndrome and math anxiety can pervade for a very long time, and it can exist in people who aren’t even that bad at math. I think a lot of people put way too much stake in how well they perform in school. My suggestion to you is to do math recreationally—read up on certain topics, try out a few problems on your own, and look through worked examples. With the pressure of grades off, I think you’ll find math to be an incredibly rewarding subject to learn."
