The woman holding the gun to my head doesn't look like she has the patience for either, and her eyes tell me she may have an answer already. 

I laughed. What else could you do? I didn't even hear the shot. 

I woke up on a cold, metal slab and squinted in the bright light. 

""Welcome back, unit 9873-alpha. It has been 3 days since your deactivation. Congratulations on your first reactivation. You may feel disoriented, short of breath, or show signs of anxiety. These are normal activation side effects. At your convenience, please access cabinet 12J and retrieve any important belongings. When you exit the room, please head down the hall on your right for debrief."" 

The computerized voice stopped, and I laid there feeling very confused. I closed my eyes against the light and willed my burgeoning headache away. After a few moments I decided I didn't have any better options, and swung my feet out and stood up. The floor was cold. A wave of dizziness hit hard and I staggered into the long row of large metal storage units along the wall. As the dizziness began to clear, I noticed the units were labeled. Feeling my way along the wall, I located 12J and pressed the button. 

The unit's door slid open, up into a recess built into the underside of the unit above and a long, wide slab, not dissimilar to the one I woke up on, slid out. I was not at all prepared to see my own dead body lying there. There was a small hole and powder burns on one side of my skull, and a rather large hole on the other side. The slab I was on was spotless, but there was some blood, backspray from the wall behind me maybe, on the side of my body the big hole was on. I looked into my own dead eyes and grimaced. 

The rest of my body seemed mostly the way I remembered it. I figured I'd just leave the clothes, but I took off my watch and retrieved my wallet. My phone was not there, and my ID was missing. I decided to grab my boots. I loved those boots and they still had a lot of mileage left. Figured there was nothing else to be done here and left the room, obediently making my way down the hall until I came to a room with a sign outside the door that read ""9873-A"". I opened the door and stepped through. It closed behind me.

This room was dark, and warm. I could see something reflective on the far wall, and as my eyes adjusted, I realized it was a mirror. My things clattered to the floor from nerveless hands as I stared at my reflection. I definitely had not been this gender before. And my skin was darker. I began breathing hard, staring at my new form. 

A soothing voice said ""Do not be alarmed. Some dysphoria is normal as your psyche imprints on your new model. These feelings will fade over the next few days."" I jumped at the abrupt voice and whirled around, but I was alone in the room. Intercom, must be. ""For your own safety, you are under observation. We are sending up some food, and if you direct your attention to your left, you will find several outfits of contemporary local fashion compatible with your new model's dimensions. Please select one and dress. Further instructions to follow.""

Has to be Critter Day at the pizza place I worked at as a yout. Hopefully a treat for anyone sorting by new!

I was in the kitchen heading out to the main dining area, when I saw a snake mosey on in to the restaurant, and head towards the kitchen. It was a small danger noodle, just a little garter guy. I brought this situation to the attention of my boss, and he told me in no uncertain terms that it was my job to get rid of it. Enjoying my new raise-free snake wrangler promotion, I returned to snek and ninja steve irwin grabbed him by the back of the head. I removed him from the premises and let him go. He safely slithered away and decided to check out an old drain. 

That would have been weird enough, but then the Squirrel Incident occurred. 

Things returned to normal. Some time passed, all was well. Suddenly, a squirrel appeared. Not just any squirrel, mind. This squirrel had, and I am dead serious here, a pink bow tied around its neck. I was taken aback, safe to say. This time the intruder made it into the kitchen, where it proceeded to more or less make a beeline for my boss. 

It latched on to his leg and started climbing. I distinctly remember his look of puzzlement and confusion mixed with despair. As it climbed ever higher, he kind of hunched over more and more until he looked like some sort of bizzaro-world pirate Quasimodo once it reached his shoulder. He sort of waddled outside like this with me in tow, and once we were outside, insisted I had to get it off him. I remember desperately hoping I'd find a tennis racket in the street or something, but no, just me and my bare fucking hands. 

Well, the ninja grab worked well on snek so I figured it might do on the squirrel as well. All I can really say is thank god for wound up 18 year old reflexes. Somehow, my plan to grab a fucking agitated squirrel by the back of the neck before it could react *actually worked*. However, once my big beefy mitt clamped down on it, its little legs and paws went into squirrel hypervelocity mode. Let me tell you, their little squirrel claws are pretty sharp. Thankfully it couldn't really reach far enough back to get me. 

But I still had a wriggling pound of fury in my hand, so I jogged a couple steps and gently tossed it to the ground. It landed on its feet, turned and looked at me, quivering with indignation. I really, really want to reminder it shaking it's little fist at me but I'm afraid that might be wishful thinking. 

That was Critter Day."
