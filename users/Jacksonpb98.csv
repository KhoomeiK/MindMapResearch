AmItheAsshole,ff2ayd4,t1_ff1h68c,1579499146.0,"I'm not super familiar with the validation rule or ex-rule, why do they bother people so much? I've seen a few posts that seem to just be asking for a second opinion get bashed for being ""validation posts"" and the fuss over it just comes off as people going out of their way to be mad.
Is there a backstory on this subreddit's issue with it that provides more context?
Sorry for all the questions I just don't know where else to ask it."
fatlogic,fezq9tb,t1_fewmt5d,1579460295.0,Yeah. Whatever it is it isnt healthy or normal and needs resolving
fatlogic,fezq3av,t1_fews3u8,1579460234.0,I can see that. I think that even if she lost weight that wouldn't fix her negative association with exercise and body image. She's assuming she and others hate exercise due to being fat but I know fat people who like exercise. Which makes me wonder if seeing active fat people would result in the same negative response.
fatlogic,fev78db,t1_feuy4vq,1579393954.0,It sounds like they have an unresolved panic disorder with an obscure trigger and projecting it onto all fat people.
fatlogic,fejm67p,t1_fejaben,1579179576.0,Most likely binge eating. Restricting for long periods of time but eating a whole lot when they do eat.
AmItheAsshole,fef70sh,t3_eohf5c,1579049686.0,"YTA- not because you don't want to cuddle but because of the way you blew her off for even wanting to ask about it. she's trying to address changed behavior that seems to have come out of nowhere, addressing it is good, communication is important. 

If you used to do it just to make her happy but don't anymore, even though it would still clearly make her happy, of course she's going to feel slighted now that you're not doing it anymore. And maybe it's just the nature of this page but it *doesn't* sound like she makes you happy and she might be noticing that."
fatlogic,fedttp8,t3_eomg76,1579019754.0,"I feel like the restriction aspect of BED is often ignored by both FA and even people in general. Just because someone is fat doesn't mean they don't have issues with restricting food. It just means that when they do eat they consume more calories than they burned.

Relatedly, even if someone is fat and calling themselves anorexic I don't think it should be assumed they just have no issue with restrictive eating to address. They might not be super thin yet but it isn't like extreme weight loss happens over night. Waiting until someone is basically emaciated to address an unreasonably restrictive diet isn't helpful."
AmItheAsshole,fec7kyn,t3_eob7mm,1578968029.0,YTA- I get not liking who your kids date and being concerned about how aspects of the relationship stress them out but being upset they want to come to a family dinner is unreasonable. This girl doesnt sound perfect but not letting her come to dinner just because you dislike her is immature. This could be a great opportunity to get to know who your daughter is dating. It sounds like you only see the unsavory parts but that isnt all a relationship is.
AmItheAsshole,fec4pct,t3_eoakxa,1578966612.0,"YTA- not because you want your son to clean his room but because of the odd punishment that wont do him much good down the line.
That won't teach him responsibility it would just be a waste of money. When he gets older he should think ""I need to do this task because I'm disciplined and it needs to be done"" rather than ""I have to do this or otherwise dad will punish me"" because that won't work when he's independent. 
Try having a conversation with him about the importance of keeping a living space clean and tidy and how it can make his life a lot easier. Tidiness isnt an innate sense were born with we have to be taught its importance 
Also cleaning up a room, especially when it's gotten really bad, can be overwhelming and knowing where to start is the hardest part at least for me it was/is.
Edit: I missed the part where you said you did try to speak with him and he ignored you. If this isn't his usual behavior he could just be going through something, maybe not full blown depression but something. 
 
Good luck!"

fatlogic,fdr992b,t3_emta6s,1578681200.0,"Why are sweets always the go to for examples of a good relationship with food for these people?

AmItheAsshole,fdfx8yb,t3_el44y6,1578372715.0,"NTA. You didn't lie and you didn't trick her. By the wording if this post you disclosed it before you got more ""serious"". If she's concerned about sexual health she (as all responsible sexually active adults should be) should be concerned about that with any guy she has sex with regardless of sexuality because there aren't any guarantees on an individual basis if someone is std free without screening.
If she or your past gf are upset just because you are attracted to men, regardless of if you've even had sex with another man, then I think you're better off without them."
AmItheAsshole,fdbbj8r,t3_ekhfdx,1578255764.0,ESH of course your daughter shouldn't have been stealing and something had to be done about it but also you as the adult should be able to come up with a better solution to the issue. Also I'm no drug expert but if your daughter had hadd a much worse reaction than intended I don't think it would have been worth it just for getting back at her.

starbucks,fcyb02a,t3_ejjqmp,1578077420.0,I would just wait out the 8 days but maybe call the store you're interested in saying you're interested in applying. Maybe even fill out the application but don't submit it until you are 16.
fatlogic,fcxu28t,t3_ej6o9x,1578070489.0,"Even from a body positive stand point this is harmful. For one this it reinforces weight equaling worth instead of weight just  being weight with no inherit morality. 

If a healthcare professional is shaming someone for their weight knowing their *specific* weight will not mitigate that.
Weighing at the beginning of a visit could save time of you need meds and they have to measure your dosage. Sudden drops in a ton of weight, even if you're overweight, can be unhealthy and being weighed regularly can help address that."
