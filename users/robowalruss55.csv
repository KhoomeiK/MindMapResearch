AmItheAsshole,feyxhvs,t3_eqtevd,1579451642.0,I think ESH. She did a horrible thing but she was young and probably didn’t hear about what the consequences were. It doesn’t seem like she had access to the internet or anything so she probably thought you would change. Depending on what religion you are in (I don’t know much about this stuff) she probably just didn’t want you to suffer when you die or something. At this time she is 19 and starting to become her own person and developing her own opinions and realizing she did do stuff wrong which is why she only realized she was wrong now. I grew up in a Christian house hold and didn’t realize until later in life the horrible things people would do to kids at these things laces. Plus when all this happened her parents probably convinced her what they were doing was right. I understand why you wouldn’t want to contact her so don’t feel like you have to you are in the right to not respond but in my personal opinion I think you should at least meet up with her a few times before making a final descision.
