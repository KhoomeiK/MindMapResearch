No matter how many days/weeks/months/years/decades I have left, every day will feel more or less like this; shitty. I'll be just as depressed in 40 years as I am now, so why bother enduring those 40 years?"
depression,ff4q8mf,t1_ff37m8s,1579569827.0,"Yes, this is extremely accurate. There is literally *nothing* to look forward to in (my) life. And when you just take ""one day at a time"" day after day after day after day, and every day is the exact same cold, grey and sad day as the one before and nothing ever gets better, there's no light at the end of the tunnel, no hope and no reward, life feels almost claustrophobic. 

Imagine being put on this fucking planet, and the *only* thing you have to look forward to is dying. Everything feels so meaningless and empty."

depression,ff4p84q,t3_cml6ni,1579569125.0,"I'm just weirdly sad. Nostalgic, sentimental and **sad**. I'm not really sure why, perhaps because it's my birthday. I'm always sad on my birthday, even though this year's bday was better than usual. Even got a text from my ex gf who I haven't spoken to in 6 years. I have no idea what I feel about that. Well, that's a lie, I feel *sad* about it. No idea why. 

I feel like I'm nearing the end of my rope. And there's nothing else to cling to. Say something nice to me and I'll be happy for about an hour before my brain starts to make me doubt the sincerity of the statement. A little while later I'm 100% sure you didn't mean it, and that makes me sad. Then I think some more and get sad and feel guilty for not believing you. And finally, my brain manages to be sad *both* because you didn't mean it *and* because you meant it and I don't believe you, at. The. Same. Time. You'd think the two would cancel each other out, but no no no. Not this brain. 

Idk what to do. Like, with *anything*. I'm awfully good at failing and at making the wrong decisions. Idk why I'm replying to a 5 month old Check in post, either. Maybe I just had to get off my chest that I'm **sad**. Like that's a rare occurance. I'm usually more depressed than sad, tho. Ugh, what a stupid dude this guy writing this is."

WTPH,fd9sfct,t3_ek28bw,1578237499.0,"Well, I can obviously only speak for myself, but you usually need others to put things into perspective for you. When you're really depressed, you get kinda trapped inside your own mind, and you're 100% sure all your thoughts and feelings are correct. No matter what they are. So let me give you a poor example:

So maybe you'll say ""Malta is really funny"". Back when I was at my most depressed, that might mean ""Malta is really funny, Wombat is really boring"". And that would be 100% true for me. And it would make me even more depressed, cuz you just said I was boring, and if you think I'm boring, so does probably everyone else as well. And I'll start to see signs that everyone thinks I'm boring. And soon this becomes a *huge* issue for me. 

If I then talk to someone about it, they might say that it's possible to think that two different people are funny at the same time. In other words, they'll put it into perspective for me. For me, the only possible reason you had for saying Malta was funny, was to let me know that you think I'm boring. Someone else might say that your only reason for saying Malta was funny was to let him know that you think he's funny, which obviously is the most plausible reason. And if this someone gets me to see that there might be another reason for you saying Malta is funny other than to be mean towards me, they've changed my perspective on this. 

When you spend all your waking time inside your own head just thinking, you get locked in all these completely weird and wrong narratives that are really hard to get out of. Malta tells me ""Kys"" all the time, and luckily I'm not depressed enough to think that the only reason he has for saying that is that he really thinks the world would be a better place if I was dead. If I did, I'd probably talk to Jota about it, and he'd put it into perspective for me by showing me that Malta say ""Kys"" to everyone. 

I hope this is at least a tiny bit understandable. And it's obviously not as easy as it might seem from this comment to put things into perspective. And you obviously don't need to be depressed to get the wrong perspective on things. It's just easier when you're depressed. 

Have a nice day!"

WTPH,fcu0r2u,t3_eixpke,1577968559.0,"**Disclaimer:** Drugs are *bad*. The only positive aspects of drugs are that they make you feel great, make you cool, make you ten times as attractive (chicks love bad boys who's always strung out, and dudes love junkie-chicks), make you better at schoolwork, enhances your performance at work and increases the chances of a long healthy life. It makes all your cows produce twice as much milk, makes all your ground more fertile, increases the chance of your offspring being male, makes your parents proud of you, and brings your friends closer. You'll be the natural center of attention in your group of friends. 

Drugs will keep you from going insane, make your semen more potent, fight off any and all infections. The minister in your local church will save the best seats for you and your family for every sermon. He will also do his best to get you into Heaven. Drugs will make your car never break down, and your bike never get a flat tire. They will help you be victorious in every battle, all your meals healthy and nutritious, keep you from being mugged, stop your aging, make all animals your friends, and keep your crops from ever going bad. Drugs will also keep your horse Jethro from going mad if your barn ever burns down. Poor Jethro.
