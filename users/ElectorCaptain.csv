Whether they are single or multi, my miner army just is getting destroyed in war, so I am looking for alt strats. Unfortunatly, miner is the only TH10 strat I know.

Even in the rare time of a Queen Walk (rare because she has been my #1 upgrade priority, and has been upgrading almost the entire time I have been TH10, proud to say she is going to 38) my miner army is getting wrecked.

Please help. I am looking to improve."

I'm not qualified to answer the question, but I would love to hear more about why that particular region of the globe interests you?

todayilearned,fdqvdaa,t1_fdqcjar,1578675423.0,"> Then it goes India, Nigeria, Philippines, and UK as the 4 most populated English speaking countries. You also may be thinking I made a mistake too cause USA should be second but since USA doesn't actually have an official language it's technically not an English speaking country by definition.

While researching about the Anglophone world I came across the cool fact that **The UK does not have English as an Official Language by law**, neither do Australia or New Zealand. 

By leaving the USA out of that list you have defined a list of nations where English is the _de jure_ (as in, the highest form of government has declared a national language by law) official language. In that case you also need to leave out the [UK because English is not the _de jure_ official language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_Kingdom)

If we were to rank the nations where the governement has English as a _de jure_ Official Language then that raking would be: India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Philippines. [According to this list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_entities_where_English_is_an_official_language)"

Personally I was software/embedded, and even with my lack of knowledge, I still felt prepared enough to complete my project. I learned so much about the electrical side (for obvious reasons, my electrical teammate worked closely with me) that I'm now doing more electrical stuff than I ever thought! 

One guy in my group was a Sophomore, and he was vital to my group, everyone was. Anwar won't do much to teach you, it's not like you'll be tested on the stuff he lectures on. But he will be vital for office hours and debugging help.

Oh, and I hoped you liked my project!"
berkeley,fdc7xgv,t1_fdbzmdu,1578268853.0,"Sure thing! [Check out my project's github](https://github.com/et-hicks/PingPongRobot) or just [peek the youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-BNOuoiZrs&feature=youtu.be). We wanted a ping pong robot, but since that is subject to crazy time constraints we were only able to hit a ball out of the air once. We did no ML training, using only OpenCV and a lot of trig/matrix multiplications. 

Impressive projects from my semester: One group made a plane drone with flight controls and a camera, another group (of graduate students) made a six-legged robot (these people got extra funding), another group (associated with a club, plus instead of 4 people they had like 6-8) made a mars rover clone complete with a controllable claw. 

Other projects were: A burrito bowl maker where it would portion out everything to your order, a robot to play air hockey, an electric skateboard. A group from a few years before my group did a rubics cube robot that was able to beat the then-standing solve time. 

Whats your background in robotics? I only ask cause I had literally no background. I did the class as a Data Science Robotics Domain Emphasis course, and the only programming I had was CS61A and E7 (I took both because I was confused as a fresh/sophomore). I also had no ME experience, so I was luck to have people in my group that could Soildworks and 3D print everything."
berkeley,fd8vopf,t3_ejt2dk,1578224088.0,"I really enjoyed taking ME 135!

Lecture attendance wasn't required when I took it with Anwar, but you should always attend lecture because it'll be a time when you can meet with your group for 5-15 mins without needing to schedule a time.

Me: ""Wanna hear something sexy?""

Him: ""What?""

Me: ""International Standard""

He hates moving between Metric and Imperial. Percy's work for international standardization of cauldrons would really help with all the fuss for something like choosing the American polyjuice potion recipe with the American cauldron, or the Bulgarian polyjuice potion recipe with the Bulgarian cauldron. What if the thinner Bulgarian pot needs to simmer longer, while the American pot cooks it at a higher temp, needing less of ingredient xyz? You ever see the phrase ""cook times may vary for different microwaves""? It's exactly the same, only for dangerous magic.

Cauldrons, we need them standardized."

berkeley,fc27zfn,t3_efr8e3,1577344707.0,"Consider replacing Arithmancy 54 for the two course Study of Ancient Runes 16A/B. It'll teach you all what you need to help you succeed in advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and you can take it a little later at hogwarts, allowing you to focus on getting that S on your Defense Against the Dark Arts OWLs.

Though that advice is really only valid of you want to pursue Defense Against the Dark Arts upper divs. If you're leaning more towards Potions and Care of Magical Creatures, dont take Defense Against the Dark Arts 61B or Study of Ancient Runes 16A/B. 

Come to think of it, I'm confused about your direction at Hogwarts. What kind of Ministry of Magic job requires Arithmancy 54, Potions 3A, Charms C8, and Muggle Studies 157AC? Don't these all lead to different career paths?

It was my understanding that what you define as ""sub races"" of Europeans, Africans, etc. were called ""ethnicities"", rather than sub races. That the genetic differences between people drew the ethnic boundaries, defined. So I wanted to ask, what is the different between an ethnicity and sub-race?

Again, amazing post. I've heard of the R1a haplogroup before, but not the H.  Also, I had no idea that it was the R1a that connected the North Indians with the Europeans."

Race is a racist social construct. Racially, Native Americans and Finnish people are Asian (the official term for this race is [""Mongloid""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid). The other two races are [""Caucasoid""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) and [""Negroid""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid)). Other fun race facts: Native Australians are Black, Indians are white, and Russians are Asian.

I really wish I was making this up. This shit is so stupid because it attempts to broadly classify very different cultures and very different people together.
