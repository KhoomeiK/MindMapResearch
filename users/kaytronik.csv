Pea Protein - I'll be honest this stuff is not great tasting but I get the blend from Naked and that was a whole 5 lb tub of powder for $55 after taxes. There are 60 servings and each serving has 140kcal 25g protein.

Tempeh - a soy based option that I perso ally prefer over tofu. Where I live I can get 8oz for $2.50 (so $5/lb). 3oz nets 160kcal and 18g protein. I don't believe this is a complete protein source, however I can't remember off the top of my head.

Dry pinto beans - Others have mentioned this already, not much else to unpack. Absolutely great food all around if you're okay with carbs.

Seitan (vital wheat gluten) - Sometimes called wheat meat. Absolutely not an option if you are gluten sensitive or celiac. But this stuff is magic, calorie for calorie its about as efficient as chicken in terms of protein. It's expensive pre-made, but with some practice it's pretty easy to make yourself and is extremely cheap (where I live, one bag is $6 and makes 2 weeks worth of 180kcal/25p servings). This is the stuff that a lot of companies use to make meat substitutes. This is also a complete protein (like I said, magic)."

You can't look at the product but ignore the process behind making that product, making it physically available to a market, marketing the product to those people, etc. 

The fact is Coca Cola is an enterprise, and there are risks to running enterprises that must be mitigated otherwise they threaten the very existence of the enterprise.

We spend more than the next 10 countries combined, most of which are allies. And your funding argument still leaves us with one of the worst public education systems in the developed world. Perhaps we could make that more of a priority for our politicians instead of relaxed EPA regulations and lower corporate taxes? 

Increasing tax revenue reduces our budget deficit and gives us more money for things that make society better, like accessible education and healthcare (another thing we, the individuals, are overpaying and receiving lower quality for than most of the developed world).

If you had read what I said. I said if paying your fair share in taxes and increasing IRS funding makes you less wealthy than you are part of the problem. And that is undeniably true, everyone should pay their fair share, including corporations. I'm not sure why you feel so attacked by these ideas but your bias is showing.

I'm not personally sure how someone who makes 300,000 per year is the same as someone who makes 7 or 8 figures a year. They are two different people and are in two different tax brackets. 300,000 a year would not be touched by the kinds of tax increases Warren and Sanders advocate for.

Increasing corporate taxes does not affect the employee, that is a flat out lie and shows that you don't understand business or economics. It affects shareholders. Corporations don't use their tax cuts for employee salaries, otherwise we would be seeing an increase in middle class salaries since the 70s. We have not seen such an increase.

Lastly I will say that ""bad for business growth"" is not a compelling argument for why corporations should continue to amass more and more of the world's wealth. Growth is meaningless when most people can't participate in it, despite the fact that these corporations you're lauding like deities wouldn't be able to grow like they do without HUMAN CAPITAL."

You can look at quite a number of sources to see that our public education is abysmal compared to much of the developed world.

Reversing the corporate tax cuts that Trump rolled out is a first clear first step. Pulling back our deficits (something conservatives love to talk about when a Democrat is in office then through right out the window when a republican is in) is another great first step. 

Redefining how we measure economic health is another first step. The price of the DOW is meaningless for 95% of Americans, it cannot possibly be the only indicator for how the economy is doing. We know that wages have stagnated since 1970. 50 years of ""growth"" and the average American is no better off.

We can do away with the word redistribution, I'm with you on that. Let's just call it what the fuck it is: taxes. If you rake in millions upon millions, or billions, of dollars off the back of your workforce, you absolutely should pay up. Taxing capital gains higher than labor is just sound economics. Increasing funding to the irs and cracking down on tax havens is another example of sound economics. If that shit makes you less wealthy than you are part of the problem anyway and can go get fucked

Edit: People should keep in mind that most of the proposed increased taxes would only affect corporations that suck the value from their labor force. Hard working Americans who have built up their wealth will largely be unaffected. You would need to be earning millions *per year* for most wealth taxes that are talked about to affect you. If you are making millions a year and need more, you are a pathetic disgrace and should be ashamed at how bad you are at living."

Economics,fdoq1x4,t1_fdnrjqt,1578610303.0,"There's science to support this too. Studies have already shown that if you are born poor, it's a good predictor of being poor in adulthood. The opposite is true if you are born wealthy."
Economics,fdopvru,t1_fdob7ex,1578610200.0,"No, but they can certainly store wealth in the form of stocks and other assets. And going back to reaganomics. The idea that was sold to people is that lowering taxes on corporations would result in them having more money to pay their laborers. What instead happened is executive salaries and compensation packages (largely based on company stock options) have sky rocketed. Meanwhile middle class wages have stagnated and the wealthy have assumed a much larger proportion of wealth since the 70s."
Economics,fdonoet,t1_fdol0bs,1578608865.0,"Sure, but that doesn't change the fact that taxation happens whenever money is changing hands. Frankly, I don't think you should get THAT much of an advantage simply because your parents were highly successful. Sure, as a parent you should be able to give a fair amount of what you leave behind to your kids without penalty. But past a certain point the government should absolutely be able to tax it again. You didn't contribute anything to the economy for your parents wealth, so past a certain point you shouldn't be any more entitled to it than the society that helped your parents earn it.

As someone else mentioned, taxes don't exist only to generate revenue. They also exist to incentivize or disincentive certain behaviors. In the case of an inheritance tax, it's to prevent wealth hoarding and economic monarchies.

Edit: Another thought about parents who earn a lot to leave behind for their kids and changing the incentive system in this area. Say there was a really high inheritance tax. That doesn't mean you couldn't, say, buy you kids a new house or car or pay off their debt or put your grandchildren through school. This only applies to the money you leave behind in death. You can still absolutely transfer vast sums of wealth to your family without paying an inheritance tax."
collapse,fdojzum,t1_fdoikcq,1578606686.0,"Sure, all of us have a part to play in making the world a better place, people and corporations. The average consumer is probably too lazy and not engaged enough with the problems facing our world. 

Though that doesn't change the fact that corporations are the ones actually producing more greenhouse emissions and other pollutants like plastic. And it also doesn't mean we can't still impose heavier restrictions on how much impact a corporation is permitted to have on the natural world and its resources (talking gas, coal, oil, trees, water, etc)."
collapse,fdofnki,t1_fdodrn2,1578604182.0,"They are oil and coal firms as you have mentioned. And China of course. I don't see how this changes anything, however, as the point still stands.

collapse,fdobpyn,t1_fdnc83u,1578602290.0,"No. The grand majority of greenhouse gasses are caused by like 10 corporations. There can't be more than one grand majority of something.

The ""pie"" I'm talking about is growth. Billionaires have gotten richer than ever from the comeback of the recession. Meanwhile literally almost everyone else is effectively less wealthy because middle class and below wages haven't changed, meaning we've lost to inflation.

Again, the majority of net new wealth created (growth) goes to a fraction of a percent of the population, despite All economic participants (capital owners and laborers) contributing to that growth. It simply doesn't balance out."
collapse,fdob9v6,t1_fdn92wx,1578602076.0,"So I get where you're going with the different idea of wealth, and sure you aren't wrong. No one is arguing that quality of life has gone up over the last 100 years. But frankly I don't see that as being particularly meaningful in thus particular discussion. The 100 years before that were also an improvement from the previous century, without the crazy wealth divide and lopsided tax structure.

Personally, a higher quality of life and lower levels of poverty should be the bare minimum of expectations for any developed society. I see this as being both a moral obligation and also an economic one. The healthier and more educated a society is, and the more access to monetary wealth more people have, the better our economy does.

My central argument is that the billionaire class and wealthy elite have a *disproportionate* share of the new growth. As I mentioned in a previous comment, all economic participants (capital owners and laborers) are responsible for the economic growth which has improved the quality of life for society, therefore all people are entitled to a share of growth. In the 12 years since the global recession, billionaires got richer than ever yet everyone else (almost *literally* everyone else) stagnated. Which means purchasing power went DOWN. Frankly it doesn't matter how accessible iPhone and entertainment is, that is not a balanced distributions of the growth we've seen.

All this to say and we haven't even touched on whether giving so much to so few is sustainable in the long, long term (100+ years, multi generational). But I'm assuming youre aware of that problem. Otherwise you wouldn't be in /r/collapse."
collapse,fdn6x5k,t1_fdmlq9p,1578578954.0,"What I'm not seeing here is what is your underlying point? You're not wrong exactly, of course there are trade offs for a more globalized economy and better technology. But how does that justify the wildly increased divide between the wealthy and the middle class since the 70s? All economic players - capital owners and laborers - were responsible for the increased growth. Shouldn't there be a more balanced distribution of that growth? If we look at the last 50 years, far more than half of all new wealth created has gone to a smaller and smaller proportion of the population. How does what you're saying account for that? And why is that something we shouldn't be looking to correct?"
collapse,fdn6lis,t1_fdn0too,1578578700.0,"Because it doesn't boil down to that at all. It boils down to, rich people don't need such a disproportionate slice of the entire pie, so much so that it is detrimental to not only billions of people but the entire planet. Remember, only a handful of corporations are responsible for 75% of global greenhouse emissions. One tench of a percent of rich people control as much wealth as 4 billion people. 

Its not ""taking"" from the rich. The rich are taking from the rest of the world."

Sure, people will look older, they'll start doing things that you normally associate with ""adults,"" but they won't actually have developed past the mind of a young, naive, ignorant high school teenager. In fact, I believe coming to this realization is part of what we refer to as ""growing up."" it's kind of like when you realize your parents aren't superheros.

If you are going to advertise how much you care by sharing your terrible, egocentric, complacent beliefs, you had best be prepared for people who have lost their patience to come along and shit all over them.

Futurology,fc3ssrr,t1_fc2xmrq,1577397714.0,"This is true, most people would need at least a few million to retire. But relatively speaking the people who have 3 or 4 million sitting in investment accounts, even those who are much younger like 30s or 40s, are basically in the same group as upper and middle classes.

I know I've seen this idea pop up on reddit before. But it can't be said enough. One single billion dollars is *one thousand* millions. If the average millionaire were worth three million, the top 5 wealthiest humans (Bezos, Gates, Buffet, Zuckerberg, Ellison) would control the equivalent of over *116,000* of them. Apple Inc alone would account for over 416,000 average millionaires.

The problem is the billionaire class and more importantly it's the corporatacracy. It's money in politics that allows companies and individuals like these to skirt so much in taxes and regulations to the detriment of our society and humans."
