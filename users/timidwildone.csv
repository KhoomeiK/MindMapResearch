RedditDayOf,ff8a1r1,t3_es79ku,1579670493.0,"I just want to note that as a Detroit hockey fan, we get the corniest of the corny commercials during breaks & intermissions. Little Caesars always leans into the weird, and this is the best of their bunch IMO. Doesn’t help they play the same commercial at least 10 times per game.

My #1, though. is a classic commercial for an Amherstburg, ON Chrysler dealership called Racicot Chrysler. I can’t find the one I wanted to post (Great Save! No, great savings...) but here’s a more recent example: https://youtu.be/Zp9M1hJo4K8 
I’m not so secretly hoping someone will see this and have a link to the one I am searching for.

And honorable mention goes to Belle Tire (“What kind of attire?”), another one I’ve seen a million times but is sadly missing from YT."
XFiles,ff4oco7,t1_ff4o5w9,1579568509.0,"The other character (her son) did. I hope it’s intentional, too - seems like such a specific word choice for it not to be ha"
XFiles,ff4nqzh,t3_ermv29,1579568082.0,Screencap from S1E8 of Sex Education on Netflix :) Couldn’t help but laugh when I heard this.
callmebyyourname,ff4gn63,t3_erjybi,1579563145.0,I see you found the meme you were looking for 🤣
callmebyyourname,ff1gqf4,t1_ff1e2x4,1579478967.0,"I would love to read a version annotated with your personal thoughts on how Elio is being stupid haha 

I added notes to mine, all in pencil. Mostly underlined favorite lines, translations of non-English text, and names of works that are referenced only by author. 

My Kindle version, however, is highlighted like crazy."
callmebyyourname,few9fyt,t1_fesuqjd,1579407131.0,"In a way, I resented hearing it there. It just felt so out of place."
callmebyyourname,few7bog,t3_eqp6vm,1579406375.0,"While it’s true that neither ever explicitly said “I love you,” what they did say to one another is no less beautiful, and no less meaningful.

Elio to Oliver:
>You are the only person I’d like to say goodbye to when I die, because only then will this thing I call my life make any sense.

And Oliver to Elio:
>*Cor cordium*, heart of hearts, I’ve never said anything truer in my life to anyone.

On this subject, I tend to lean into Aciman’s opinion on the matter: [don’t spell it out](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/42195/1/call-me-by-your-name-andre-aciman-love-story-lessons-enigma-variations-novel), because in storytelling, I find it’s so much richer when a writer fosters interpretation via the characters’ actions, rather than using the words outright."
movies,feptw2z,t1_f2i5osq,1579331124.0,"There was a moment he was walking away from the camera shirtless and I recognized the issue with his left shoulder/collarbone. It looks a LOT like my husband, who has had multiple minor shoulder separations (from hockey) culminating in a grade IV separation (motorcycle accident). 

Husband had surgery to help correct it, but his clavicle is still quite a bit more prominent on that side. Have a feeling Phoenix has had separation(s) and/or dislocation(s), as well."
RedditDayOf,fepot1o,t3_eqa6ts,1579326381.0,"I know it’s not an original flavor, but Faygo cola is legit, too."
hockey,fenpg0x,t1_fen1o9n,1579288900.0,Yeah this whole self-deprecation angle is a much better look than his previous response.
madmen,femqwlt,t1_fem50f8,1579266999.0,I don’t think it’s her character. I recently saw Brooklyn (Saoirse Ronan film) and she played the main character’s manager at a dept store. Her acting was delayed and wooden. It was really disappointing and took you out of the story.
IAmA,febq7c7,t1_feaizl3,1578961510.0,"I will never forget this as long as I live, because it’s sadly so true:
“If ISIS had a streaming service you would be calling your agents.”"
television,fe6f0z1,t1_fe6b0gi,1578888952.0,I was a wreck when it STARTED. That opening montage with her daughter shattered my heart.

NetflixBestOf,fe5ak8h,t1_fe4ynfk,1578867057.0,"Yeah I would definitely start here and work backwards through his library of works. That’s what I did and it’s been a hell of a ride. The sets grow less sprawling, but that same sense of intimacy and unsettled-ness is a thread throughout his works."
femalefashionadvice,fe59oqg,t1_fe45dbg,1578866884.0,"As a fellow shortie, I love how ankle slacks (BR Sloan) look with flats AND heels. My ankle jeans also look great with my Chucks, Docs and booties - I don’t have to roll them, they just hit right where they are supposed to."
LadyBoners,fe3o9sb,t1_fe3nvki,1578851245.0,Agreed!
LadyBoners,fe37fkb,t1_fe2bgaz,1578846664.0,"I would assume the answer here is Jackman, but Fassbender holds his own haha. No shade to McAvoy 😘"
LadyBoners,fe36h8s,t3_enfz5o,1578846458.0,"Are there any Reddit tool kits available to allow users to filter content in their own view? If so, maybe requiring tags on posts so people can filter out that content would help. I use this a lot on tumblr but I dunno if that’s possible on here, tho."
nottheonion,fdpdyt8,t1_fdnu7lu,1578626192.0,Ditto. Upvoting every comment in this thread because they make me smile so much. Also very bittersweet.

spaceporn,fdj9cib,t1_fdj1s5g,1578462231.0,I was really struck by how QUIET it was there. Such a surreal experience.
hockey,fdj7jop,t1_fdj1v4i,1578460674.0,"Same and you are spot on. But lots of Wings fans around me sang the anthem, too. Always a treat to see a game against a Canadian team. It’s a beautiful anthem :)"
hockey,fdj7edg,t1_fdiwvpv,1578460552.0,It was a pretty even 50/50 split from what I could tell. Had a hearty Let’s Go Red Wings/Go Habs Go Call & answer going during the 3rd. I loved it! My BIL is a Habs fan so it was fun for us all to take part in that.
hockey,fdj7816,t1_fdirsee,1578460407.0,My first game of the year tonight and it was so cool to be a part of. Loved the grace of it ❤️
television,fdddczy,t1_fdd3889,1578306907.0,I don’t think season 3 of the Crown was eligible at the last Emmys.
movies,fdctpca,t1_fdct8k4,1578284028.0,She also starred as Mary Austin in Bohemian Rhapsody.

television,fdcpsr5,t1_fdclzcv,1578280993.0,Fingers crossed he hits up an after-party. It just doesn’t feel like awards season without a new Timmy look.
television,fdclpbj,t1_fdcl16t,1578278016.0,"Aw man. Episode 4 is really the turning point. I recommend giving it another go. The 4th wall remains broken, but you really begin to understand her after that ep."
television,fdckzpf,t1_fdcks7a,1578277510.0,"I was thinking that too, but I think she’s at the Netflix table for The Crown. Divided loyalties and all that."
television,fdckweo,t1_fdcksmz,1578277444.0,How far did you make it? I’m genuinely curious. It’s definitely one that rewards a committed watcher.
callmebyyourname,fdcaesd,t1_fdcabe0,1578270300.0,Oooof. That’s a lot of pain.
callmebyyourname,fdbz3h0,t1_fdb0jsj,1578264084.0,Definitely Atonement. And on a Keira Knightley (and equally gut-wrenching) note: Never Let Me Go ([slightly spoilery trailer here](https://youtu.be/sXiRZhDEo8A)).
todayilearned,fcqsz31,t1_fcocg3y,1577891737.0,"They used to be better, but have certainly declined. I have seven bras from their now-defunct Showstopper line that have held up to regular wear for probably ten years (wash on gentle cycle, hang to dry only!). Someone will have to pry those from my cold, dead hands, because I sadly haven’t found a better fit at VS—or anywhere else—since."
Detroit,fcqjcqe,t1_fcprnzu,1577887026.0,"This is so true. I listened to them pretty obsessively for a while and then I just...stopped. Turned the show on recently after a long while and now can’t remember what was ever redeeming about it. They just take all of their stories from Reddit. Combine that with their long-running jokes, and everything just feels constantly rehashed in a way that just isn’t interesting. 

It also took some distance to realize just how misogynistic their humor is. One can only listen to a man complain about his wife so much, and the whole “legion” thing...ugh I don’t even want to start on that."
Sufjan,fcnr3ee,t3_ei6eyl,1577816844.0,I’ve always wondered about this myself. Will be watching this space with curiosity.
todayilearned,fclxywl,t1_fclws1t,1577759211.0,"I understand that the burn led to swelling, which led to asphyxiation. My wondering is more along the lines of whether he burned himself so badly because he had problems with swallowing. I’m not trying to solve a mystery or make a diagnosis here. The stroke is just a curious fact to mention in the article, and I’d be interested to know whether it was considered to be a factor in the post-mortem. Seems odd to mention it if it wasn’t somehow relevant."
todayilearned,fcls4ts,t1_fclc341,1577755132.0,">...the 51-year-old, who had allegedly suffered a stroke seven years earlier...

Wonder if this was at play at all. Strokes can affect a person’s ability to swallow properly."
Michigan,fc4rely,t1_fc45q66,1577425648.0,My Dutch irises are sprouting. Makes me sad because they likely won’t do so again in the ACTUAL spring 😞
Sufjan,fc2sbma,t1_fc2s443,1577372597.0,"That is true and I agree. I honestly think it’s unfair to speculate on his sexuality at all. I get that people want to understand and relate, but saying it’s one way or another (as has been done by OP even) isn’t going to get at the truth."
Sufjan,fc2q9om,t1_fc2q0kk,1577370817.0,"Unless you know him personally, you’ll never really know.  Even then, it’s up to him to define this, not anyone else. He’s clearly a very private person, so not sure that will happen."
