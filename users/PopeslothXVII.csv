nextfuckinglevel,ff744y8,t1_ff6mj49,1579640743.0,The 30mm Canon on the apache is not very accurate. It was never designed for that purpose. So by the time you finally hit the track you have already caused a lot of damage that is not the bulldozer. And there is nothing really special about tank and general armored vehicle tracks that would make them stronger than bulldozer tracks.

nextfuckinglevel,ff6hggw,t1_ff6gs5n,1579627286.0,Ball park guess of 100-200mm effective thickness of RHA
nextfuckinglevel,ff6gw84,t1_ff6gity,1579626937.0,I was typing that before you made the edit so I never saw it. But chances are any missile made in the last several decades would demolish the thing. Especially since Concrete is only something like half to a quarter as effective if not even less effective compared to steel at stopping penetration depending on type of round.
nextfuckinglevel,ff6g533,t1_ff6f34n,1579626468.0,"Doubt a 50 cal could penetrate it without firing a large volume of them at it. you need about 150 rounds of 50 cal per foot of concrete at 100m. And the HEDP shells on the apache only have ~25mm of pen of solid steel. Off hand I don't know the thickness of the steel on the bulldozer but there is about 310mm of concrete. And that also doesn't come with the issues of angles that the shells would hit the vehicle at which adds even more thickness.

nextfuckinglevel,ff6dds6,t1_ff6b4tx,1579624751.0,Their main cannon is not really ment to take out armored vehicles. It's primarily for infantry and unarmored vehicles. The have hellfire and TOW missiles for heavy stuff.
