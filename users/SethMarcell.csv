TheDragonPrince,fdqhguj,t3_emkjh1,1578666774.0,"I hated the frame rate season one.  It bothered me so much I nearly quit the show.  But the characters pulled me along.  

So glad they fixed it for the other seasons, I love this show. 

&#x200B;

Weirdly, when they do ""previously on,"" they use the original frame rate for things from season one.  Very jarring.  I guess they did not want to spend the money on inbetweeing those scenes."

movies,fdjth8w,t3_elgsup,1578486919.0,"I wish that Hollywood would get with current technology and start filming at high frame rate. 24p is a stupid format. We all have 60hz monitors, some even higher.  Start filming at 300fps and get a lifelike asthetic that you enjoy and make that the new state of the art. 

This isn't 1940."
