aww,ff04ai6,t1_feyocb8,1579465045.0,"I had a cat when I was younger that would follow me to the corner store and chill outside until I was done, she was the only cat that ever did that with me so I'm not sure if it's just a trait thing or not..

As for your cat being a dick, I get it. One of my cats (around 5 yrs) is and always was an asshole, she swats and scratches you if you pet her in the wrong place, and runs if you try to snuggle. Shes been slowly (and I mean *slowly*) warming up to us but is still a little jerk. It might just be your cats personality and all you can do is hope that one day it'll let you get more than 10 secs. of petting lol

Edit: she doesn't have a bad past or anything, she's just a dick, my other cat that was a rescued feral kitten is an absolute **slut** for pets and snuggles."

She starts off tense but melts into your hand after a bit, she's around 3 yrs but is barely starting to open up to cuddling, she was adopted as a kitten from a good home so she doesn't have an excuse for being so standoffy, she's just a little asshole cx"

AskReddit,fbwqj38,t3_eetf7i,1577156773.0,"I killed a Guinea pig when I was like 4(?)
So my mother bought me a Guinea pig from petco when I was little, they had told us it was a boy but maybe a couple weeks or so after having it, I went into my room to see a bunch of hairless little guinea pig babies. Me being a little kid freaked out because I didn't know what they were. Eventually those guinea pigs had babies and then *those* guinea pigs had babies, and so on until we had like 5 cages of guinea pig babies. One day I remember playing with one of the little babies(it was a little big, kinda like dwarf hamster size) and I guess I held the poor thing too tight in my meaty kid hand and squished it to death. Since I was a little kid and didn't want to get in trouble I threw it away in the trashcan and never told anyone until a couple years ago.
 RIP nameless guinea pig ;-;"
