The reason it is getting so many retweets is probably quite abit to do with her being an attractive woman being shitty. She's still shitty of course but I'm certain it gets 30%+ more popularity because of the love of finding evil twitch thots out.

The biggest twitch sub livestreamfails is 90% about streamers doing shitty things and 70% of that is shitty female streamers.

Like I say I didn't realise he was actually defending it just making a point about the popularity. I mean the popularity is actually useful for the shitty female streamers.

Then compare the decent ones to the shitty ones in terms of views and people posting and talking about them and you will realise being shitty is good publicity unless you've got genuine talent in making content. Which is considerably more difficult than being shitty and decent looking.

You may not want to hear this but if she had no content and was just normal do you think she's top page and a million view YouTube video about her? No.

'Prediction is very difficult,” the old chestnut goes, “especially about the future.” And for years, social science agreed. Numerous studies detailed the forecasting failures of even so-called experts. Predicting the future is just too hard, the thinking went; HBR even published an article about how the art of forecasting wasn’t really about prediction at all.

(Key sentence here)
That’s changing, thanks to new research.

We know far more about prediction than we used to, including the fact that some of us are better at it than others. But prediction is also a learned skill, at least in part — it’s something that we can all become better at with practice. And that’s good news for businesses, which have tremendous incentives to predict a myriad of things.'

That's the opening. That they thought it was futile and the new research suggests otherwise, your article is disproving your theory.

Some more exerts from your article 

' Domain expertise helps, too. Forecasters who scored better on a test of political knowledge tended to make better predictions. If that sounds obvious, remember that Tetlock’s earlier research found little evidence that expertise matters. But while fancy appointments and credentials might not have correlated with good prediction in earlier research, genuine domain expertise does seem to.

Practice improves accuracy. The top-performing “super forecasters” were consistently more accurate, and only became more so over time. A big part of that seems to be that they practiced more, making more predictions and participating more in the tournament’s forums.'"

And thundercloud spike accounts for a massive amount my kills.

Sometimes when I'm at like 140 offstage and someone is at 20 and goes for an edgeguard haha"

The other day at 6.1mill (I know mediocre no brag) some Mario was just literally spamming up smash and dair. I was so surprised it actually beat me. But the next t
Two matches if he wasn't gonna approach I just treated him to fake out approaches and a T-jolt. I know I'm rambling but isn't it weird sometimes someone gets so many wins with a basic ass gimmick."

The US does what it wants to these nations because they are strong and wankers. Not much you can do to stop them. Sure you could trade sanction them but they aren't going to over this.

Edit. Oh I don't mean the US as a whole tbf. I more mean their foreign policy my apologies if I am unclear"

I don't think I need much more than that personally. It's not like discovering a new particle or anything. Though I suppose you never know what you can learn till you look. I'll put it in my 80% chance category or more likely never really think about it ever again."

In one 2014 study, a sample of women were asked to go to the loo prior to sexual activity and then undertake ultrasound scans to prove their bladders were empty. After the women became sexually excited they were given a second ultrasound, which showed their bladders had re-filled significantly. Finally, a third scan after they’d squirted revealed empty bladders again, suggesting the liquid they’d released came from this source and was likely to be pee (or at least partly so).

“Squirting probably originates from the bladder, as there isn’t any other structure within that area of the female anatomy that’s able to hold that much liquid, or propel it with that much strength,” asserts pharmacist Abbas Kanani. “During orgasm, the muscles relax and make it difficult to hold in urine, so it’s released via the urethra.”

Fucking redditors man, spend an eternity arguing about what Google can do in a few seconds."

Only supporting evidence it's more than that from this wiki page is that they were involved in an armed robbery, they sell handguns and were charged with 1st and not 2nd degree murder. Though I guess it'd be pretty rich giving someone killing an informant for any reason 2nd degree.

Actually something to support your side. They were fired from a job, the implication being they aren't organised enough for full time salary."

AnimalsBeingBros,fe1od5z,t1_fe03q0p,1578829027.0,"With all due respect to everyone with birds already, unless it is a rescue personally I think it isn't a good thing to have a bird as a pet.

You are asking it to give up way too many natural behaviours. I'm sure some bird owners give them a good run, but they have to be willing to make the bird a huge priority in their life. I'm thinking free fly commitment levels. Again I don't mean to throw mud at my fellow redditors but some owners among you are doubtless less good than you think.

Of course I'm not an expert or anything, but it seems wrong to me. Especially those that have to live in a cage often."
