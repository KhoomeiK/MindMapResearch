thats the point. 100 (or 1000? and so on..) years ago people believed completely different things. today shows they were wrong. if we are now sure about what we think we know, then we havent learned anything. 

> It’s been determined 

from your subjective view, not even the existence of any other observer perspective is determined, as that goes beyond your individual possibilities. 

believing anything like that is kinda naive. logically, there isnt any reason to ever **feel** pain at all, because if its a signal to cause a certain action, all of that could function without making a passive observer suffer from it. 

you seem to struggle doubting your fundamental beliefs, which is a pretty natalist thing.."

1. its displayed as such, but its a pseudo normality they fall for. its nothing like breathing and eating, because we cant escape those. stopping breathing and eating kills us and threatens with pain. procreating is not a fundamental need for the survival of the individuals body.
2. believing in such is the same naivety. 
3. sounds like 1. and the more critically one can think, the more obvious the pseudo normality of procreation becomes and then rejecting an alleged majoritys opinion (the subject can even know if that majority isnt just 1 opposing instance) is not a challenge.

of course we are, still possible that we are on a massive ride atm. 

i consider it dangerous to be too convinced of one perception, because the more you believe in one, the harder it will be to accept a different one in case we were wrong. but i guess we arent so far from each other regarding that aspect; maybe youre just like 51% on the one side, while im 51% on the other side. :D

well ofc reality is not the trip; one is reality and one is the trip, it just seems like you struggle to doubt your current tendency. because you say that:
