I could never get into any sweeteners except erythritol (and even that I don't love).  Here is what I buy now:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LDNBAC4/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LDNBAC4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  

One of my faves is whipped cream with berries and toasted pecans. 

Ingredients for two servings: 10 berries (raspberries and blueberries are my fave), 1/4 c heavy cream, 1/2 Tbsp of sweetener, 1/2 cup raw unsalted pecans, 1 Tbs butter

Instructions: 1) Toast the pecans and butter on the stove on low heat until they smell good (be careful, it's easy to burn them). Add salt as desired to the pecans. 1) Whip the cream with the sweetener.  3) Toss the berries in the whipped cream and top with the pecans. Should be about 3.5 net carbs each or 7 net carbs for the whole batch.

Also, peruse r/ketorecipes \- there are a lot of them out there."
