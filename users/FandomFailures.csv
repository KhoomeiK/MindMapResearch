CountryHumans,fex4cvc,t3_eqpb6v,1579424116.0,"It IS uh... *interesting* actually, Germany and Russia’s relationship over time, we always thought that Russians established communism, but it was actually a German that made up the idea of communism . And so far no one has actually achieved the communism Marx was talking about, because there was always someone of a higher power. 

I never really saw ReichxUSSR as a good ship, but then again they shouldn’t be shipped with anyone anyway, because in that time period nothing between the two was actually significantly bonding for us to necessarily ship them, GermanyxRussia, despite not shipping it, has some logical proof behind it, but ReichxUSSR was them making a pact, killing people and then killing each other. 

So the question is, when did we start shipping it?"
