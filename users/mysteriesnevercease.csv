I guess they didn't realize the reality of it because that lasted like a month or two and then they were just tired of it and me. After we broke up they immediately started dating someone who goes on all these physical adventures with them. It stings but my illness also has guided me towards non-monogamy. I haven't practiced it yet really but I love the idea that you can accept each person as they are. If someone is asexual that's okay because if you want a sexual relationship elsewhere that's fine. If someone has physical limitations, you can accept them as they are and do the more physical activities you want with another person. Monogamy is trying to make one person everything so people try to change you or become resentful of what you can't do whereas polyamory/non-monogamy you can just accept someone for exactly as they are. They don't have to be everything."

I don't hit on anyone that looks like they're 19-20 unless there's an indicator of their age. Its wild sometimes 23 year old women look 17 and 17 year old girls look 20. I have to be careful because of my age and my attraction to women.  But ultimately you just don't do anything unless you know their age.

I'm still fat because losing takes time to lose but my appetite is so different. I had a date last night and ordered curry. I poured half of it out like I always have. I couldn't even finish all of that. Usually I would've gone home and finished the Thai curry but I had an apple and went to bed. It's now noon and I still haven't been hungry, not even for curry (my usual worst temptation). 

All it took was pretty much only eating produce for a month straight. I've lost about 8 pounds now and I'm not calorie counting. I feel like my mindset and my life is changed. I got pizza on a date a couple weeks ago and had two pieces, after she left there was half a pizza left so I gave it to my neighbor. I've done kind of a ""junk food is a social thing"" mindset."
