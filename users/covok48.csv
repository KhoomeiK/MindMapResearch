First midterm elections were right after 9/11. Americans knew Democrats were weak on tough foreign policy and voted R. Nothing to do with W.

Democrats had an extra week to vote in 2018. Widespread voter fraud. You know it and we know it.

CA has been losing R’s since 1998. Fewer R’s captured because fewer still in CAa to vote.

Orange County got fucked by voter fraud. That’s why your crap state should have a real ID act. Easy to bus in voters with an extra week to vote with ballot harvesting.

Texas and GA have many CA transplants shitting up those state because they vote the same way they left.
