aspd,ffdrmu2,t1_ffdr283,1579827232.0,"I don’t know if my lack of being motivated for DBT is holding me back. It was such a fast, fucked up situation that I never had time to process what was happening. I usually push away from “sudden” events in life and being switched to DBT is definitely one of them."
aspd,ffdrdxk,t1_ffdqz4l,1579827066.0,"I do get random episodes of intense emotions like anger, but I’m not sure if it’s depression related. Even when I was experiencing extremely anger and anxiety they didn’t start DBT. Still kept me on Behavioral. Once this stupid incident happened where I happened to be lacking emotion at the time, they were so quick to put me with a DBT therapist. They didn’t even introduce me to the person or explain what was happening. Just told me I need emotional regulation and threw a binder at me. I had never been so confused in my life. I would rather they focus on the more extreme things in my life rather than what I’m lacking."
aspd,ffdqn91,t1_ffdqfuf,1579826597.0,Also it’s a team. 3 different therapists and 1 Psych.
aspd,ffdqlhu,t1_ffdqcp0,1579826567.0,"Emotions. Unfortunately I was 5150 and sent to a psych unit because of a aituation where emotions and impulse control would have been in my favor but seeing as I don’t have either, I fucked around and scared half the facility I get therapy at. They immediately switched me to DBT from Behavioral therapy when I got out. I still have some of the worksheets o was given but it feels like it’s going nowhere sometimes."
aspd,ffdq5ca,t1_ffdpvu3,1579826283.0,I’ve been doing it for a year and I used to do the assigned work up until they switched my therapist who believes that “traditional DBT” is useless so she’s been using a children’s version of DBT for about 4 months now. I’m not sure how other places work but my therapists get these big add binders called DBT manuals and they are supposed to use those and then print out a bunch of documents for me to complete or utilize but nope. Got switched to children’s DBT. Neither have worked though. I’m not sure what to do.

petsmart,ffc64q1,t1_ffc5zty,1579792424.0,Yeah everyone at my job is too scared. We DID report my boss and then the store lead (core store part) put one of our seniors who told on leave instead. She has not come back yet and it’s been 1 month.
petsmart,ffc19xx,t1_ffc142u,1579788988.0,I actually texted all the employees and I cuddled the screenshots in the complaint but I also put VERY descriptive situations in the complaint as well. The shit my boss has done 100% is not okay and she should be fired. I usually do not care about my coworkers because they’re just coworkers but I am so heated about the last situation involving a mother. I really hope caresmart takes notice.

Gang involved, several charges of robbery, assaults, etc. he did a lot of time in prison when I was growing up. I won’t go into much detail because he can be found online and I don’t want people finding out my family stuff but he is a serial rapist as well as being on trial right now for attempted murder using a metal bat. I witnessed the attempted murder and gave my statement. I have a restraining order on my father for personal reasons. Growing up with him was horrible honestly. I got beat everyday and only praised when I did bad shit. Mother got beat, constantly bailing him out of jail. Etc. My mom kicked him out pretty early in my life (age 11) but he left a mark on me. I sometimes feel I might be like my father because I’m clinically diagnosed with ASPD but I feel that I’m much better than him in every way, shape and form."

AskReddit,fctrv74,t3_eipzwh,1577956260.0,"When I was younger I constantly would here my parents tell me to do shit like wash dishes or get the garbage. Really normal chores. But there were times where I would hear specific things like “[my name] can you get me the [random item] out of the fridge” and so I would go get it and hand it to whoever I heard. Turns out that for about 5+ years I was actually NEVER hearing them. They NEVER told me to do anything but somehow I still heard them ask me to do whatever task they wanted me to do. For example, my mom once got home and I heard her ask me to go grab the celery from our second fridge so I did and handed it to her and she was so confused because she never told me to go get it nor was I aware that she was using celery in the meal she was making but I somehow just heard them.

Everyone knew this bitch was crazy. EVERYONE. But no one would listen to us when we told them she was capable of killing again. It makes me more upset that my mom has to go through it.
