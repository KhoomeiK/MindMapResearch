socialanxiety,ff9j9d1,t3_esasd5,1579714188.0,This filter is honestly what anxious energy feels like. It’s a perfect description ahha
socialanxiety,ff7yu09,t3_es2pso,1579661621.0,Weirdly if I don’t have enough sleep I feel far more anxious. But I feel like this is the more general outcome for most people?
socialanxiety,ff7yozd,t3_es42g8,1579661525.0,"Yes this used to be me. And it is hard to distinguish social anxiety from panaoia. I’m still not sure what it was myself. However I’m over the paranoia feeling now, so you’ll get there!"
edmproduction,fen1gwf,t1_femjjqs,1579274851.0,I agree 100% about people having differnt taste. But it was just a shock to everyone in this comp that I’ve spoken to with the top 3 prize winners. No one called them haha. But ah well is what it is.
edmproduction,fen19ac,t1_fem4sr0,1579274716.0,Well easily man. If you’ve had a few releases on trap nation and it has t really caused any traction for you. That’s fine. But if you’ve built a big fan base then it’s not fair imo. As these competitions are there to help with that
edmproduction,fen0w44,t1_fem4qxx,1579274479.0,"Here u go ahha https://youtu.be/AxL2K4y1ulE

The exact remix released 3 months ago on the 3rd of October. The results were decided on 10th December. There’s your proof hahaha. So deffo a predetermined decision haah"
edmproduction,fen0cvi,t1_fem3kdc,1579274126.0,"Yeha proximity chose the prize winners and they like that commercial shit haha. For me these were my fave entries and they were much better songs. 


https://skiomusic.com/r/rZW  (this one was my fave of all the entries but it didn’t even rank in the top 20! Which is crazy to me. I was sure it was gonna win. But I guess it didn’t as it’s not technically future bass) 

https://skiomusic.com/r/6pb (this one got top rank but no prizes) 


https://skiomusic.com/r/bxC (this one came like 10th) 


https://skiomusic.com/r/Uug  (this is my entry also if u wanna check that. Came 15th)"
edmproduction,felobyl,t1_felnw5n,1579226974.0,Facts. Yeha I used the wrong word. But I’m not sure who’s marking it as imo there were many better entries. The top three shocked me as they weren’t at all what I expected. I was more talking about how the positions of the rankings didn’t reflect with the points. Like someone had 80 points but was 8th and I had 81 points but was 15. So it was confusing to me and seemed they just did it at random or something ahah.
edmproduction,felmzcu,t1_felm9rm,1579226049.0,I just feel skio should be for totally unknown producers trying to make it. Not producers who have already had a taste for success. As much as I love Nurko. This comeption wouldn’t do much for him in terms of fave etc. As he’s already got a platform. Where it would do a lot for other producers without one
edmproduction,felmw82,t1_felm9rm,1579225989.0,My mistake about the tour thing. Just compared to most of your average producers he’s doing pretty well ahah. A tour with dabin ain’t bad. Yes I agree his remix was the best one. But it sees led predetermined to me as the chainsmokers already asked him to personally remix their song on trap nation beofre the compeption even started.
edmproduction,felm8zf,t1_fellduj,1579225545.0,Nurko is pretty successful in that every song he puts out it will instantly go to trap nation or proximity etc. He's built a good fanbase. I'm not annoyed that he won because his remix is the best. What I'm annoyed about is the fact that it was most likely a predetermined decision and there was no point in the other producers putting in the effort because this remix is a remix the chainsmokers already asked Nurko to do for them personally before the competition even started. So it was bound to win before anyone else could even try if u get me. Thanks for responding!
socialanxiety,feits6x,t1_fehll12,1579147011.0,"ahhaha oh well bro, happens"
socialanxiety,fegm0aj,t1_feflqbj,1579096859.0,I’m sure. It just never feels that way shsh
socialanxiety,fefhnxi,t1_fefftz7,1579056526.0,Hahaha crazy story man. Thanks for sharing. Never had such an in depth reply. But Yeha I never think they think I’m stealing. But I do get the impression to people who don’t have anxiety that people with anxiety give off a ‘shady’ vibe
dubstep,fedvoha,t3_eond6a,1579020874.0,Great tune man. Really love it
AfterEffects,fedss2t,t3_eoit47,1579019116.0,Thanks man. But I’m looking for templates!
socialanxiety,fdx39du,t1_fdx2v80,1578764841.0,Thanks I’ll try a walk tonight maybe. It’s a weird think of liking to be alone but also hating it. Dunno if that makes any sense ahha. Sometimes I like to be alone as it helps the anxiety go away. But I also hate being alone as it’s lonely ahha
socialanxiety,fdsmsmy,t3_emzx8m,1578705265.0,Awww sucks. Sorry to hear. But bully’s are always getting bullied themselves so they are just taking their own insecurities out on others
socialanxiety,fdsmbne,t3_emzpyo,1578705066.0,Congrats! I hope I lead by your example
DarK,fds7ms1,t1_fds7kua,1578696188.0,Still cool regardless. Thanks tho
DarK,fds75jl,t1_fds7274,1578695875.0,But I can still go in the Forrest and surrounding areas of the power plant and get the feel for it right?
socialanxiety,fds6y8q,t1_fdoavwr,1578695743.0,Propranolol does nothing for me. Just feels like placebo
socialanxiety,fds492w,t3_emsgqq,1578694038.0,"I take propranolol yeah. Personally, I find it completely useless and a placebo. But hey maybe that’s just me. It’s a lot weaker then anti depressants etc. So maybe that’s why"
socialanxiety,fds2fo9,t3_emvw0r,1578693282.0,I’d say your mum doesn’t love you any less it’s just anxiety is more complicated. With OCD it’s out there in the open and people can see the behaviours. Anxiety is more of an internal thing so speak to your mum and let her know how u feel! Don’t suffer in silence. U got this bro. My anxiety is similar to yours and I’m not doing so well atm. But u got this!
socialanxiety,fds215k,t3_emvoyh,1578693124.0,Congrats that you even go to work! I’m too scared to apply for a job even atm
DarK,fdrk2j4,t1_fdqutj5,1578685629.0,This is amazing thanks haha
DarK,fdri3fo,t1_fdr7muk,1578684811.0,Hahaha amazing thanks so much
DarK,fdqu7nk,t1_fdpjmo5,1578674970.0,Ok thanks
DarK,fdqu67u,t1_fdp4jx4,1578674945.0,Yeha that would be genius. Why not haha
DarK,fdo1fu6,t1_fdns7u9,1578597124.0,Hmmm yeah fair play.
DarK,fdncof9,t1_fdmx423,1578582953.0,There you to people. Don’t be doubting haha. That’s confirmation enough for me
DarK,fdlm16k,t1_fdllzmo,1578527068.0,Hahaha facts
socialanxiety,fdlbiww,t1_fdlat4d,1578520503.0,But yes good advise. Maybe hobbies etc will fill my days more
socialanxiety,fdlbhnf,t1_fdlat4d,1578520481.0,It does to an extent as I make the beats and then collab with singers etc.
socialanxiety,fdl9h1f,t1_fdl9byg,1578519318.0,Yeha I have lots of Intrested and my main intrest is music production. But that unfortunately means a lot of time spent at home inside!
DarK,fdl93jj,t1_fdl90ak,1578519130.0,First person to agree with me haha. Thanks
socialanxiety,fdkvb16,t1_fdkmxn3,1578511896.0,Amazing response and theres nothing worse for someone with social anxiety to hear then that their prescene makes people uncomfortable as that feeds into the issue. so congrats on staying strong on that
socialanxiety,fdkv3oq,t1_fdkqxy2,1578511775.0,huh? I dont understand
DarK,fdkkuge,t1_fdkb77b,1578505662.0,Ah fair play in the article it said it is confirmed. Maybe not tho
DarK,fdkayr0,t1_fdka8tm,1578500036.0,Fair play. Well I thought I’d share it anyway. As you never know. It might be right
DarK,fdk8g0w,t1_fdk6e2i,1578498449.0,Tbf there are hundreds or articles all saying that that’s the release date
DarK,fdk8e26,t1_fdk7id5,1578498415.0,I’m not saying it is true but there are like hundreds of websites and articles all saying the same thing.
socialanxiety,fdk3u4m,t1_fdk2j5c,1578495393.0,I have been in that headspace of not caring before but I slip back. I feel mentally I actually don’t think I care but my body overheates and I go red randomly and that’s what triggers the mental side of things. I hardly leave the house unless for essentials as I don’t see the point. If I don’t have plans with friends I’m not gonna just wonder around aimlessly. Would rather stay at home and be productive that way. Thanks for the advise tho. I just think it’s gonna be a scary progression. As I haven’t worked in a while and have been spending a lot of time at home
socialanxiety,fdk06mj,t3_efh2gs,1578492753.0,I’ve found what I found kinda makes sense if u think about it haha. Your all good
DarK,fdjzcua,t1_fdjz7p4,1578492106.0,Not sure. Just what google said. But I’m sure it’s right as it says it’s been confirmed
bestofnetflix,fdjdzrc,t1_fdj6y0z,1578466869.0,I actually watched it in English dubbed and found the dub to be pretty great. There’s so much going on that I wanted to not have to concentrate too much on the subs and just watch
socialanxiety,fdicoqf,t1_fdibz8z,1578439908.0,swear down I just grab random crap whenever im in a store just to get out ahha. Honestly. When im with someone tho im always fine. its just the being alone that triggers it always
socialanxiety,fdic8i3,t1_fdibz8z,1578439640.0,glad people can relate tho
socialanxiety,fdic7pq,t1_fdibz8z,1578439626.0,this is 100% me ahha. I dont actually feel anxious in my mind. feel fine. then my body reacts with me sweating and overheating and going red and then my mind reacts accordingly. And then I start to spiral into thinking everyone is judging me for being red and thinks theres something wrong with me. fucking sucks
socialanxiety,fdgzh5j,t1_fdgyzsp,1578412051.0,"Just doesn’t make sense how I can go from being to totally fine. Socialising and not feeling socially anxious on a skiing holiday with thousands of people. But then I come back and go into a shop and do some easy tasks and feel a panic attack and convinced everyone knows etc as no one else is looking like me. 

You ever had something similar? Where uoube been great on holiday where it’s busy af and then come back and something easy freaks u. I don’t even ask my body to react this way anymore like my mind doesn’t feel anxious and then I suddenly start going red and hot sweats randomly and then that ofc Inevitably triggers my anxiety. Sucks so bad"
trapproduction,fdfdos4,t3_ekz2s0,1578359264.0,Step one. Your head should form an equilateral triangle with your monitors. Other then that nice setup! Haha
bestofnetflix,fdebuf2,t1_fdebrt1,1578335612.0,So watch it in German with English subs ahha. That’s how it’s meant to be watched
NeedVocals,fcxsc5m,t1_fcxropq,1578069719.0,Drop me a dm if u wanna hear the others and see if u can vibe with them
NeedVocals,fcxs829,t1_fcxropq,1578069651.0,This is the first time I’ve properly tried trap haha. So glad it’s popular
NeedVocals,fcxrsd4,t1_fcxropq,1578069578.0,Appreciate it bro. Glad u like it. I got more of your Intrested
edmproduction,fcmthfp,t1_fcm2215,1577791479.0,Ofc. No plan for the track yet but will keep u posted
edmproduction,fcm1sz1,t1_fcly2a0,1577762006.0,love chelsea so much. good advice thanks
trapproduction,fcm1rum,t1_fckrwd2,1577761983.0,i read the rules now but its a production page and im asking a questions about production just seems weird.
socialanxiety,fcm1pws,t1_fckez93,1577761944.0,good advice thanks
socialanxiety,fcket4h,t1_fckepjc,1577723730.0,Your good at this ahha. You should do therapy ahha
socialanxiety,fckdq8k,t1_fckdj8a,1577723030.0,Na with skiing it wasn’t about falling over. I was just able to talk and chat with others and not be anxious. But sometijt small like this I wasn’t able to not be anxious. Jjst seems weird
socialanxiety,fckd3np,t1_fckcqhu,1577722632.0,Great advice thanks. Still weird that a small thing like that would be an issue when I’ve been doing much bigger things like skiing with literally thousands of people tho
trapproduction,fck5fc4,t1_fcizwe8,1577717106.0,But why would u not be allowed to post this? Stupid rule. What’s the point of this group. I’m asking a production related question aren’t I?
trapproduction,fck5cer,t1_fcizwe8,1577717041.0,Sorry
edmproduction,fck5bjy,t1_fcisb6m,1577717021.0,I’ve got that pack and it sucks imo haha. Fake sounding horrible vocals. But thanks aha. I’m gonna probs just chop up real vocals
edmproduction,fck56ue,t1_fcid9he,1577716917.0,Yeha very true. Got any good acapellas in mind?
trapproduction,fci7yh5,t3_ehc744,1577658822.0,There are loads on splice
socialanxiety,fci6t1m,t1_fcg8k1d,1577658418.0,Yeha everyone makes comments about everyone who falls on chairlifts tho. Just know it’s not specifically targeted at you. Even tho I know it feels like it
socialanxiety,fcg2t94,t1_fcg2gbe,1577635950.0,Why’s that bit so difficult?
socialanxiety,fcd5adh,t1_fccv2zc,1577606530.0,I mean if your a rapper u can 😂
socialanxiety,fcd58df,t1_fccmkqx,1577606510.0,Hahaha happens to the best of us
socialanxiety,fcciwbk,t1_fccihbi,1577598909.0,Yeha true. But I find the goggles and mask protect me and I can hide insecurities haa
socialanxiety,fccirim,t1_fccihbi,1577598862.0,I find the chairlifts fine as u don’t have to stare at them. The bubbles are more awkward as your sitting across from people. But even then the anxiety doesn’t hit too bad as I just focus on the people I’m with that I know ahsh
photoshop,fc556o9,t1_fc54aqx,1577443744.0,It has free options but ofc they aren’t as accurate. As they in order of how accurate they are to the official font?
photoshop,fc54jis,t1_fc54aqx,1577442785.0,Holy shit this found it! That’s so sick. It’s $32 tho 😂
photoshop,fc547md,t1_fc53dha,1577442294.0,Yeha already reached out to them also. Nothing back yet
MusicInTheMaking,fc3uekz,t3_efwx8b,1577398887.0,Sent you a dm
