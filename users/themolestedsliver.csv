You said a *Historical fact* sounded like nazi propaganda which I refuted in several ways only to take my humorous example of how ridiculous you are sounding as some sort of argument point.

....yeah, and if you read **any** history text book you would see this to be the case. The world isn't black and white mate yet you are trying to force it to be the case in this argument as if Nazi's did **everything** wrong which historical just wasn't the case. The nazi's were also *famously* anti smoking, so are you trying to say me not wanting to get cancer is also nazi related? 

The humiliation at the hands of the Treaty of Versailles made Germany a great breeding ground for such hyper nationalism because it was so blatantly unfair to Germany I could imagine it being hard to argue in Germany at the time. Ignoring this bit of history and acting as if hitler magically rose to power is just objective ignorance though this can be remedied by some simple research that for me happened in middle school. 

>>they suffered hyper inflation because the government didnt know how else to pay their MASSIVE debts

>90% of reparation obligation was dropped by the time the 1930's rolled around you fuckwit.

So...what? Does that magically mean the hyper inflation didn't happen? Like i will admit you had a point about how Germany *did* have a golden age, but COMPLETELY ignoring how fucked they were right after the war in order to argue about what happened later is just petty as fuck and this comment all but proves that was your intention.

>In the early beginning on the 20's they had hyper inflation for a period but (guess what) hyper inflation isn't a death wish. The 20's were even known as The Golden Twenties at the time. It wasn't this horrible poverty. Economic disaster came from the great depression which destroyed foreign investment in Germany and cut away their income from exports.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Twenties


Dude, in the *very* link you give me it literally says this

>Before this period, the Weimar Republic had **experienced record-breaking levels of inflation of one trillion percent between January 1919 and November 1923.** The inflation was so severe that printed currency was often used as domestic fuel, and everyday requirements such as food, soap and electricity cost a wheelbarrow full of banknotes. It was only after radical economic reform measures initiated by the Weimar Republic, such as introduction of a new currency, the Rentenmark, tighter fiscal control and a reduction in bureaucratic hurdles led to an environment of economic stability and prosperity in Germany.

You should read more and spend less time trying to ""school"" people on reddit because you seem to willing to disregard historical facts in order to say someones wrong in an obtuse way. It is super obvious you didn't even proofread the link you sent because it actually supports my argument far better but i am sure you are going to ignore that as well.

The magnitude of the war was because imperialism made nations have HUGE egos and inflated militaries which (along with complicated inter political marriages and alliances) made it so a feud with 2 nations became a world war. 

Germany is not innocent but ignoring what I just said to put blame on Germany is straight up ignorance which is why text books specify the treaty was unfairly harsh to Germany because it frankly was.

It's not about language though since it is in the whole tone and point of you comment.

I don't mean to be rude, but **factually speaking** the ""child"" isn't a child at the time of most abortions. I don't care if  you were using this as justification for how **you** live **your** life but trying to dismiss facts as *just* opinions will always be flawed.

Being the king of the moon sounds cool, but me telling people i am king of the moon doesn't magically make a lunar crown appear before my head just as you *saying* abortion is killing doesn't magically give full human sentience to a bundle of cells.

>And arbitrarily deciding that a persons life would be bad as justification is pretty weak...

uhh do you know what arbitrary means? I gave a very realistic reason that people deal with every day so i am unsure exactly why you feel the need to say that the reason was ""arbitrary"" when it cannot be any less so. 

Also *it is a bundle of cells at the time of most abortions*. Just because YOU think of it in a more spiritual sense doesn't magically change the biology behind fetus development. You aren't ending someone's life just as someone getting an amputation isn't ending someone's life. 

>I think it’s literally killing.

Ok and you are entitled to thinking that way *except* when using it in an argument like this. 

If you never want to get/let your partner get an abortion I don't care but the way you are framing this suggests you want to die on the hill of making this illegal which i just cannot stand for.

God i hate this argument. Im sorry but a homeless person and a fetus at the time most abortions take place **could not** be anything different. One of this is a fully fledged human who fell on hard times and the other is a bundle of cells which requires a womb to grow and mature and isn't there mentally in the same way a human is.

Sorry but ""The Patriarchy"" is a complete myth invented by feminists to blame men for the troubles they face whilst preventing from male related issues from the seeing the public eye unless specifically curated by them in the form of slurs. (see ""toxic masculinity"" and ""fragile masculinity"")  

>Criminal sentencing rates are also a poor metric to support your point, men commit more crimes which is also probably resulting in part from patriarchal roles with boys being taught that it's in their nature to be violent and rambunctious, as well as that they are the ones that must provide for the family (often leading to crime).

How does men committing more crime justify a women getting less jail time than a male for the same exact crime or of lesser severity? 

I agree with society predisposing boys into aggressive and bread winner mindsets but further blaming men on this (the patriarchy) doesn't seek to fix this problem at all. 

Why are women accepted to be the victims when they experience sexism in society, but men are *further* ridiculed to the point where they refuse to call it sexism due to personal bias? 

> I don't think it's a case of women systematically getting away with a ton of crimes that the police system just happens to turn a blind eye towards.

When did I ever say or allude to this in ANY capacity?

Oh right because a lot of feminist institutions keep spreading myths that men live some privileged existence just for having a penis and people circle jerk that notion around like fact in order to seem ""woke""."

...what? Who honestly thinks plane crashes are more common than car crashes? 

>However they are rare.

Sorry but you can't say this definitively which is my whole issue with this since it belittles those effected by false rape accusations despite how common they are if you paid attention to them in the news.

>According to the US department of justice 1 in 10 rape allegations are fake. Despite 90% of them being real, only less than 1% end in a conviction.

Yeah rape is a crime that sadly is hard to prove for the most part but i am unsure how that means those who want to make the accusation are 100% truthful. 

1/10 rape accusations being false is quite a lot i'd say given the extent of the crime and the ""women lie about what the had for dinner, not rape"" mindset that is not uncommon. 

Also ""90% of them being real"" fails to consider personal differences for what rape is called. I knew a girl who thought a sexual assault (groping, etc) was rape which adds another layer of complication.

> So even if every time a rape allegation was proven fake or ended with a guilty verdict was reported in the news paper you’d still read 10 times more stories about fake rape allegations than guilty verdicts, making it seem like a rape allegation is 10 times more likely to be fake than real, when it’s actually the opposite.

Do you have a source if you are going to keep focusing on this one statistic? I still think it is hard to say anything definitive when there are stats that say ""90% of rape is unreported"" but i will like to see what your basis is still. 

>Now 1 in 10 being fake is a huge problem still. That’s a lot of fake allegations. That is something that we need to try to find a solution for.

Belittling false rape accusations and ""#believe women"" doesn't sound like anyone wants to find a solution. 

> But in the meantime the much bigger danger is that over 99% of the time that a rapist rapes someone and the victim comes forward, the rapist gets away with a completely clean record.

Let me preface with rape is a horrible crime and those who have done it deserve the most horrible death possible. *But* that shouldn't say we need to blank check punish men purely because they *could* be a rapist. 

A lot of rape accusations happen years after it happen which makes it fall in the realm of hearsay which is why it is so hard to prove. I don't blame those women but at the same time we shouldn't ignore that as a factor in what you are saying. It is not like **every** judge is like ""but how long was your skirt"". 

>That’s unacceptable. And even scarier is how much more often someone is raped and is too scared to say anything about it at all.

I think a guy being imprisoned as a rapist despite being innocent is also unacceptable. There is no easy solution to this problem but i find dismissing a side due to vague statistics isn't a healthy way to broach this topic."

jokes aside, when the term using ""masculinity"" AND the context in which people use it to shame and belittle men it becomes rather obvious.

Oh, and the fact that those against this post are INSTANTLY labelled ""fragile"" proves the catch 22 nature of this sexist slur.

Sorry but your opinion doesn't over rule facts. not how reality works.

>There’s no inescapable circumstance because of contradictory conditions.

Uhhh what? 

The ""inescapable circumstance"" is that if you are a guy and you were offended by the phrase ""fragile masculinity"" you are in turn called ""fragile"" which has happened an ungodly amount of times on this thread and from a mod themselves so i am unsure how you can dispute something so clearly established.

>There’s just an opinion whose labeling you don’t like. That’s not the same.

Nah i explained pretty clearly why it is a catch 22. Just because you can't accept that fact doesn't mean i am wrong for repeating it. 

>Besides, your premise is a strawman; calling something fragile masculinity does not imply that all men exhibit it, nor does it imply that women can’t act out similarly.

For 1, that isn't a strawman because you are disregarding swaths of my argument (which hypocritical as fuck at this point) 

And 2, By using terms such as ""fragile **masculinity**"" you are **inherently** taking about men *in general* not to mention the fact women don't have identical terms. 

Considering those aspects means that ""fragile"" and ""toxic"" masculinity are divisive and harmful which is what i was trying to say. 

>It’s simply pointing out a trait that’s more prevalent in men, and can be attributed to conditions that pertain more to men (testosterone, traditional masculinity not being conducive to opening up and sharing your emotions, leading to repressed feelings etc.).

Sorry but no. Being upset and destroying things *isn't* ""a male trait"" and arguing it is all but proves you are to clouded by bias to realize this. 

Also, i find it *hilarious* how you are saying ""traditional masculinity not being conducive to opening up and sharing your emotions"" on a post that mocks men for being ""fragile"". You could not be more tone deaf.
