college,ffaa1w8,t1_ffa4t1b,1579730822.0,">I have been smoking/drinking pretty consistently every weekend during college. I never drink during the week.

This is *(relatively)* low risk as long as you aren't binge drinking. If you are going to be smoking/drinking then the most appropriate time is the weekend when you don't have classes.

>This semester I have started to smoke everyday. It helps me sleep and it’s just fun.

If you were in my chapter, I would suggest that you have your fun on the weekend and explore other options for the sleep part (so you don't drag it into the weekdays). CBD is something that might work for you personally as a sleep aid, I would suggest it if you haven't tried it.

>Right now I have a 4.0 so I don’t expect that to continue, weed or not. My goal is to do better than a 3.5 every semester. With that context, how would my experience line up with what you’ve seen in the past?

I have seen a lot of different GPA outcomes and there's a pretty broad range. I don't meet a lot of (or any, honestly) 4.0 students that drink/smoke heavily, though. You can take it as a compliment if you want, you have certainly managed it better than most.

I know people that drink/smoke with something like a 2.3 and others that do it with a 3.4, a lot of it depends on how the person balances it and how difficult their courses are. I wouldn't bet on a meaningful GPA drop if you kept to your current smoking/drinking pattern, seeing that you clearly managed it in previous semesters. Weekend partying is not a pressing issue in my mind: a lot of successful students partake without it negatively affecting other stuff. You are clearly in that bunch of people.

However... expanding the pattern into regular daily use might result in a higher GPA drop than you are expecting or comfortable with. With expanding it to daily use, I would be concerned about coursework consistency/quality and how it would potentially be a conflict with studying and your general weekday routine. Additionally, if you are planning to continue it through college, I would ask how you plan to stop (or roll it back, realistically) once you get a full time job and more structured responsibilities. Sometimes it is very hard to cut back once you've been doing it five times a week for two years.

A 3.5 for the remaining semesters is absolutely fine unless you are trying to enter graduate school for a program with high GPA requirements. It will bring your GPA down but your final cumulative might be something like a 3.75 in that case (depends if you exceed the 3.5 by a bit and how many credits you have left). A 3.75 vs a 3.95 is not going to make your career vastly different. Almost all employers prefer experience over grades, though a higher GPA often helps a lot as a tie-breaker for intro positions (and after one or two jobs, GPA isn't really important at all)."

Drugs and alcohol themselves were not the issue, the issue was how certain people used them. Only one person I was monitoring academically ever dropped out due to alcohol/drug caused issues, but I would say for 50-60% of students I watched partaking in either: their grades would have been better if they were substance free. By better, I mean like a 2.9 vs 3.2 difference. A very meaningful difference for a lot of students. The other half of the pool that had partaken in it was mature and responsible: they only drank/smoked on weekends and for the most part, their grades weren't negatively impacted at any meaningful level.

I can typically tell which category the student falls into pretty quickly. The way you phrased your question would definitely be a red flag for me but I would want to know how you maintained a good GPA up until this point. 

Are you asking if it would be worse if you smoked more than you do? Typically, the point I would intervene with people had been when their grades started to worsen. If your grades aren't suffering then you are most likely being reasonable with your current usage. I would caution against using more because it's pretty easy for people to cross the line fast and basically firebomb the semester. I wouldn't smoke more. If you feel like you need to smoke more, then you need to find out what is fueling the root of the desire. If it's stress, there are better ways to mitigate it."

Not in all cases. It really depends on the loan. I would personally do it with maybe 5k if it was a delayed interest loan that I could pay off without interest/fees two years later if it didn't end up being forgiven. This type of loan might not be easy to obtain for everyone, though.

Police have to abide by certain standards when detaining someone or taking them into their custody: reasonable suspicion and probable cause, respectively. The dean's conversation is likely hearsay. In my opinion, in the US this wouldn't be enough for them to take OP into their custody.

>What matters is that the *doctor* is correct

There had been no doctor up until the point of OP being detained. The police cannot detain a person in hopes of figuring out the justification of detaining them at a later time. They need to have it before they detain them.

> It can and does happen-- quite frequently actually. It sucks for the person forced into it, but it is perfectly legal. 

For a person trying to jump off a bridge or ram their car into something, this makes complete sense because they are doing something that give the police a reason to detain them and the reasonable suspicion required to.

Harassing is used much more as the verbage, I rarely hear the word bullying. In college, examples might be verbal harassment (sometimes against the university policy) or spreading rumors and lies (it's often libel because you're 18 now). There's a lot of different levels of harassment: both personal and organizational.

Most students are mature enough not to do stuff like this. It's not like high school where you can get away with it. If you do this stuff in college, you can get into serious (legal) trouble, lose respect, lose friends, and lose your career (if you carry it out on social media)."

I do think that there's threshold where money can affect how happy a person is. Specifically, research shows that a persons happiness in life increases as their income goes up until it hits the point where they aren't worried about money (the study says that 80k is the number in the US for the avg person). 80k is the cap for most people's happiness by increasing income. So a person making 30k vs. 80k has a bigger difference in happiness and stress than a person making 80k vs. 200k

So in general I think a major where you have a high chance of employment is the top consideration. It obviously doesn't have to have high starting pay but making that 80k average later in life certainly does help with quality of living and less stress."

Though most of these students will regret it later when they are in debt and either not working in their field or making very little money in it. You can say you are fine living on 25k a year all you want but actually doing it feels so much different.

We certainly don't pay into it expecting people to buy luxury goods.

Eliminating refunds will put more people through college who would otherwise be unable to do so.

Broccoli, spinach, carrots, bokchoy, kimchi (in the jar), chobani greek yogurt, 1% cottage cheese, eggs, chicken breast, lean pork chops, bear naked granola, hummus, unsweetened almond or cashew milk (plain or chocolate), tom yum soup broth, and plain chicken or beef broth.

Buy some spices and seasonings too so you aren't stuck with plain food: olive oil, garlic, ginger, basil, thyme, curry paste, lemon or lime juice, tumeric, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and whatever other flavors you like. This also enables a lot more food choices. You can probably make a dozen different kinds of meals you would like easily with just the chicken and some vegetables if you have a good number of spices: kung pao chicken, roast chicken, lemon thyme chicken, etc.

Everything on my shopping list is affordable and healthy. Walmart typically rings up the cheapest for this grocery list. For an 1,800 calorie diet with these nice foods you are looking at about $70 a week ($280/mo) which is in-line with an average grocery budget.

They might reject it at first but there's no way they would be that strict with you all the time and not send you to college as per the plan. College seems like something your parents expect from you and view as a requirement.
