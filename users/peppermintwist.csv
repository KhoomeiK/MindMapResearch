MakeNewFriendsHere,ff2vjhm,t3_er0ud9,1579525796.0,I do this and it still doesn't work out. I've even started using emojis and being positive.
GamerPals,ff2usmj,t3_er7x0r,1579524998.0,"Girl, those are my favourite foods omg"

quittingsmoking,fcvw0mf,t1_fcvu5en,1578011365.0,I'm not even hungry. Just so bored and restless.
quittingsmoking,fcvsc1d,t3_ej6209,1578008998.0,I think when people want to quit they will. I feel like I'm not having the worst time since I can have an occasional cigarette and not be hooked again.
depression,fcvq6ry,t1_fcvbly5,1578007614.0,Thank you. Best of luck to you as well
depression,fcvq5bk,t1_fcv0kmg,1578007587.0,"Thanks mate, appreciate it üôå"
depression,fcvq3jh,t1_fcvosvl,1578007556.0,"As I have depression, I will always deal with it, but I'm not about to feed it constantly anymore."
quittingsmoking,fcvg1xd,t3_ej2yhg,1578001336.0,I'm also eating a lot of junk üòÇ
quittingsmoking,fcuqqze,t1_fcumcmo,1577986593.0,I've vented way too much. I just want to put a cap in it because nothing's going to change. I hope time can lessen things at the very least.
quittingsmoking,fcuqgiw,t1_fcupttp,1577986428.0,"It doesn't help that I don't want to quit, but I have to so I'm in the same boat no matter what. You'll do it, mate. Good luck üëç"
quittingsmoking,fculzl7,t1_fcui0ap,1577983900.0,"I'm happy that works for you. I'm agnostic, but have nothing against people's beliefs."
loneliness,fctxiod,t3_einosv,1577964536.0,"I've had it for awhile recently, but it's going away. I fed my loneliness and depression and really have no one to blame except myself. I find focusing on other things and trying to be your own friend until someone comes along to be a good idea. The pain will pass, mate."
jackrussellterrier,fctxaek,t3_eirg1a,1577964219.0,What a beautiful boy!
depression,fcrabg9,t3_eihb2v,1577899060.0,Same.
depression,fcr8dms,t3_doqwow,1577898276.0,"I really agree. People start talking to me and then just stop. In that moment of depression I feel like we're friends, but I guess not."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcomlph,t3_ei9kge,1577836025.0,Yeah. People just call them internet friends. Like they still people. I don't think anyone wants to have connections to anyone anymore or if they do it seems weird.
DecidingToBeBetter,fcomeon,t3_ei9x3g,1577835886.0,I don't want to think about any of the horrible things I've done. I don't think I can be around anyone that reminds me of those times. I don't even want to remember myself. I'd just like to be someone completely different.
depression,fco4bzq,t1_fco499b,1577823829.0,It's really sad. I hope the next one's better.
depression,fcnuwjl,t3_cml6ni,1577818906.0,"I look around, everyone's happy and partying and I'm just having the worst depression. I feel heartbroken and I think I broke my own heart."
quittingsmoking,fcne0bz,t3_eg5bly,1577809734.0,I honestly don't feel like myself at all either.
depression,fcmzvuw,t1_fcmzs47,1577799082.0,"Well, if I don't stop it's the end of my relationship. I'll probably die from it, not like I have any problems with that, but it makes me do and say stupid things which I have a problem with and it's expensive. I miss the cigarettes more anyway."
depression,fcmzp6y,t1_fcmznur,1577798903.0,It doesn't feel great if that's what you mean.
depression,fcmzm94,t1_fcmzkmh,1577798823.0,"Well, I am trying to be sober."
depression,fcmzjdu,t1_fcmzi5p,1577798744.0,I wish I was. üòÇ
depression,fcmy9yg,t3_ei0bz1,1577797439.0,"I understand completely. I felt really average, but lately I feel very unattractive because of how my personality is and that it makes everyone run for the hills. I just look like a zombie. People don't really fall for looks though, so we're just in the boat of how to get out of depression and become ""interesting"" again. I wish you luck."
2meirl4meirl,fcmuxak,t3_ehzz2r,1577793451.0,Who would want to quit?

MakeNewFriendsHere,fcjxvjk,t3_ehcw8k,1577709813.0,"I definitely agree. I think a lot of people aren't in the right head space to make friends, myself included. I'm always hoping to have a friend while I start to feel better, but that's not very likely."
depression,fcb28bg,t3_cml6ni,1577581315.0,I looked in the mirror finally and saw the ugliest person staring back at me.
depression,fc9236s,t3_egpdqp,1577545782.0,"We get trapped in this cycle. I see we're all here, on this same pageof I'll just kill myself. There's still time to change even though it's the hardest thing and we're just fighting against ourselves  I always thought if someone loved me, I'd be happy, but it's not that easy. It will get better. You just have to make it through."
depression,fc8mln4,t3_egdm43,1577538021.0,"If you tell yourself that's all you are, that's all you're ever going to be."

depression,fc3i7sk,t3_efv2fo,1577390364.0,"Don't we all? I want someone to love me more than I ever could love myself, but no one will ever do that for you and they can't so we just have to love ourselves. Someone will love you. But before that you have to love yourself because otherwise you'll just fall in love with every distraction. Wishing the best for you."
depression,fc37uj8,t3_efukvu,1577383568.0,It's a coping mechanism. I feel I laugh and smile way too much for anyone to believe I have crippling depression.
selfie,fc2xo0i,t1_fc2w76w,1577376775.0,"Thank you. I think they're ugly, so nice to see I'm wrong."
