bipolar,ferv5pa,t3_eqgibd,1579358627.0,So sorry you’re having a bad time.  I’ve found texting to not be very reliable.  Maybe a call.  But its been two days and I’d hate for this to progress further.  The hospital could get something in your system to get this under control safely/quickly and is my recommendation.
ColorBlind,ferqu8e,t3_emgw8t,1579357295.0,I recommend that you make a few pleasing and safe color choices on their behalf and then work from there.  Paint colors are pretty frightening decisions for most colorblind people to make.  My house has a lot of different colors most are somewhat saturated...I find them nice.  The house was move in ready so I didn’t have to make decisions...I did have someone assure me that they aren’t crazy.

Now I have a house and the front door has been fine (USA suburb).

DHL typically requires a signature...that’s usually an international delivery.  One web vender (B&H Photo) requires a signature.

There are some very smart people and orgs with unlimited resources that are already on it.  If they want something bad enough, they will get it...we may not be made aware how or that they even did a crack.  They will then simply find another or create another avenue that will provide a plausible source of the recovered  info through means that won’t reveal the compromise.  “Just good old cop work”. 

Yes, I’m really that pessimistic and I also think my suspicions are right. Ok, just for fun I’ll agree that it may take a bit of work...but really, we don’t have the rights nor resources when secret or higher tools are brought to bear.  I’m still interested in the phone but it’s use needs to be kept in context of the true surveillance power our government has at its disposal.

I guess I thought it was maybe a bit brownish?...it’s quite difficult to explain because I simply don’t have a valid point of reference.  But like most things, it never occurred to me to assign a formal color.  I know I’m not seeing a full spectrum, but I also don’t have an idea of what I’m missing. Trying to compare/match doesn’t work.  I liked her hair but the novel characteristic was lost to me.  I wish I knew now what made me ask her.  

For example...the singer “Pink”...it never occurred to me that her hair was that color...I just thought it was really whitish.  Someone mentioned it or something.  I’ve never seen the color pink...it’s just not in my palette.  

Apparently my bicycle is a hot purple...I thought it was blue (bought that on my own).  I always have a female accompany me when I shop for clothes.  I can get into trouble pretty easily."

bipolar,feh5ih7,t1_feh2k53,1579109567.0,"It’s the red/green thing...It was the strawberry part that made things complicated.  I took a lot of geology in college (double major, ran out of time  so I finished a business management degree) anyway, I couldn’t go by color, so any mineral identification had to be done using mechanical properties and crystal structure alone.  There are minerals that I just couldn’t see if they were embedded a matrix.  My entire career has been in petrophysics, fortunately it hasn’t proven to be a big problem.  I’m between jobs right now, but I had trained everyone to not color code if I was going to be involved.  Even so, data plots are very-very difficult to read.  I have a fantastic software tool that was coded by a colorblind specifically for fellow colorblinds."
