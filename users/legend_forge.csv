CurseofStrahd,ff9ti88,t3_es54hl,1579720925.0,"Im chaining those adventures together as well!

My approach was to have the vistani ride through phandalin and set up camp.  They start a bonfire and are generally disruptive, leading the players to either act or be asked to intervene.

If the players choose to be violent have a short battle with Arrigal and he leads them on a chase into the woods, where the mists overtake them.

If the players are benevolent have the vistani invite them to continue the revelry down the road.  If the players decline, the vistani continue to be a problem for phandalin unless escorted away.

After the eating and the songs have a tale of Barovia told by an elder.  Maybe how they once saved the king of a far away realm.  When the players awake, they are surrounded by unfamiliar trees and the old svalich road."

Fight lasted like 15-20 rounds.  Made lots of use of his lair action to close all doors (separate the party) and go through walls (pick off lone members).

Counterspell critical.  Slow was also a good choice.

I did one weird trick where strahd turned into a bad the same round his bat swarms arrived,  so he could hide in the clouds of bats filling the room to recover a bit of hp and land a good sneak attack."

dndnext,fen4phg,t1_fen45uc,1579276913.0,"I really like it.  The first half dozen or so episodes are a little linear and they are clearly still getting used to their characters.  Phil in particular was embarrassed by his turn times in the first few fights.  Matt talks about it during the campaign diaries.  They do make an effort to improve, and it pays off quickly.

It turns gradually into a open world kind of game, with factions and missions and politics and decent mix of fights.  The megadungeon is a layer on top of that.

The first episode was like an opening cutscene (all these people are game designers and writers so that sort of tracks).  Roleplay is part of it but not like in CR, more getting down to business and working out courses of action."

dndnext,fel8j5h,t3_epoorp,1579216376.0,"I have a bi weekly game I am paid to run, so I can offer insight into why *I think* people pay to play.

Some of my players know how to play and run their own games, but some of the members have never played before.  This group pays because they want to play in a game but don't have anyone they know who can fit it into their schedule.  I also think they wanted to be on the same side of the screen to introduce their friends.  Its like a weekly game night nobody has to prep for or spend effort on outside of actual play.  This is a very informal setting and the only rules are the ones I set when we started.  They pay 80 bucks a session and never seemed to feel cheated.  Its like a night at the movies as far as cost goes.

I also ran games at a local bar in exchange for free food.  The players paid cover and paid for their meals.  There were a lot more rules here set by the establishment.  These players were all new, and wanted someone to teach them to play.  They came to the bar because they knew the bar was vetting us as well as all the other players, so there was an expectation of behavior.

Both have been great experiences for me as well as my players.  Everybody walks away happy."

The webdm guys tell a story of trying to kill orcus permanently that sort of applies here.  

First they stole the want of orcus, and ejected it into the positive energy plane.  They then made a deal with mind flayers (and a undeath cursed elder brain) for passage to the far realm.  Once there they travelled back in time, and killed the mortal who would eventually become orcus using blackrazor.
