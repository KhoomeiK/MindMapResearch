Custody issues require a change of circumstances at a detriment to the child/children in order to  readdress custody.(situations like one parent failing a drug test/ arrests/new living situations for custodial parent are major qualifiers.) Even though you are now clean, that isn’t *necessarily* enough to have the case presented in front of a judge; unless explicitly stated by the family court judge who originally  limited visitation. 

The bad issue is: paying a lawyer to fight a case they know you won’t win but takes it on because it’s easy billable hours for minimal work.

Your best bet is to set up multiple consultations with lawyers, hear their POV on the case at hand, and going from there. Make sure to ask them for reference and/or specific cases that they’ve won that relate to your circumstances."

HobbyDrama,fdoyj19,t3_emdr7o,1578615800.0,">	“Teachers should teach for the love of teaching”

Ahh I see they’ve been taking communication tips from the Oklahoma State Government!

Absolutely not! This is some Chooseybegger behavior if I’ve ever seen it. Of course they were happy “donating” their time when the event wasn’t raking in the dough or they’d have never participated but, as the net profits grew so should have the compensation. A sandwich voucher (which they probably received a discount for buying in bulk) and a discount from other vendors (it’s not as if that money is being pulled from their revenues) ain’t it. 

Also, speaking of vendors, how much have their fees increased in relation to growth of the event?

As for whether or not the org cares if the teachers refuse their terms... if the classes are the big draw for the event it and all the sought after teachers refuse to participate it wont be long until the entire thing collapses without them. It sounds like the org is playing hardball hoping that everyone continues to tow the line knowing full well without them their “fundraiser” goes up in smoke."

I became a mom at 20 and wore very little make up for 10 years, started watching YouTube to get the latest trends and figured out very quickly that the majority don’t translate to everyday *normal* use; all the *advised ways* aged me tremendously. I love watching because I still pick up useful techniques but the majority of the stuff uploaded is regurgitated info that is only useful under *yeisss guurrr* ring lightning; not actual sunlight and office lights. 

I often wonder watching these channels how much a “normal” person could make if they showed actual everyday use for “normal” people. *If they ever got popular enough that os*"
