I didn't say that. You misunderstood me (go figure), I said that I'm amazed that you see all the changes that the English language has gone through and think THIS (as in, recent slang, and the post above) is the final straw. 

Two things - the evolution of language is not a conscious effort by a group of people, it is a slow and constant process as new words are invented and old ones fall out of favor. This is not controllable. Ideas and morals change, borders disappear and cultures merge. 

Secondly - I do not have to be an etymologist nor do I have to understand Olde English in order to argue FOR the evolution of language. You don't have an argument, you just want me to say ""I can't read that"". Okay, so what? I can't. I don't need to. My career doesn't involve Olde English, nor does my day to day life. If it did, I would learn it. Just how people still learn Latin, Ancient Egyptian, etc. etc.

Society is not bound by the state of culture in the past. Not only is it impossible, it's ridiculous to suggest that we should neuter our societal advancement just because we need to be able to read old copies of bibles from a thousand years ago. Translators and interpreters exist. I can pull out my phone and instantly translate a sign on the road in hundreds of languages. People can study Shakespearean English in college if they want to understand the full nuance behind his work. It's not one or the other - we can advance our culture and retain knowledge of how it used to be in the past. I sincerely hope you're just young and ignorant because otherwise it's fucking pitiful to imagine you're an adult who really needed all this just explained to them."

Oh? Are you trans? Because from what I understand, the strong factors are the literal feeling that your genitalia are the wrong ones. 

>	If gender roles made a difference in what gender you wanted to identify with, wouldn't you be supporting those gender roles by changing gender? If you were a man who liked dolls, and you changed into a woman, wouldn't you be further supporting the idea that only women like to play with dolls?

No? Like I said, is it not possible to think that liking dolls is *traditionally* a thing girls like while also thinking its okay if boys do it too?


>	So you're accepting gender roles by changing your gender, so that other people can rebel against gender roles? That makes no sense. Just be a man who likes dolls. That's how you break gender roles.

>	No, I feel like trans people will not be as prevalent if society breaks gender roles. This is because the factors won't even exist. Transgenderism affects so many people right now because of gender roles.

The problem here is that you’re basing your argument on the idea that gender roles are the main cause for people to not feel like they’re their biological gender. You’d benefit from talking to someone who’s actually trans because that’s just not true. That’s not what body dysmorphia is. I paint my nails on occasion. I know I’m not trans, because I paint my nails but also am fine with having a cock & balls. Someone who’s trans may paint their nails and on top of that also feel like their dick doesn’t belong there. 
 
Your whole premise is flawed because PLENTY of MtF trans people will transition into a female who you could call “butch”. The point is for everyone to do whatever they please. I get the point you’re trying to make but your entire argument is based on the assumption that the only basis for transitioning is based on gender roles."
NoStupidQuestions,feh63yw,t1_feh5c1v,1579109926.0,"You're still misunderstanding my point. There's no getting around the fact that some things were traditionally indicative of a gender, people realize that. No one is out here figuring out they were trans just because they liked painting their nails or playing with dolls. It's a factor, but it is not the deciding factor. You can realistically admit that traditional gender roles played a part in helping you figure out that you didn't feel comfortable as the gender you were born as while simultaneously wanting people to more comfortable breaking these gender roles without feeling like they have to be trans. It's not one or the other. I expect as society deviates away even more from this kind of ""gender norm"" thinking, more and more trans people will stop stating that it was a factor in realizing how they felt. You're witnessing people becoming trans in an era where these norms are still forced upon kids, it's not a surprise that people will come out with those stories."
NoStupidQuestions,feh4zak,t1_feh4gio,1579109253.0,"Once again, the argument is not that certain roles and actions can be indicative of a gender; it's that those roles and actions shouldn't be CONFINED to just that gender. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who thinks wearing makeup and painting their nails isn't a traditionally girly thing, they're just arguing for it to also be okay when men do it. Not sure why you're generalizing an entire community either, but that's pretty par for the course for these anti-trans arguments. Understand that like most groups of people, opinions and viewpoints differ even within the community."
NoStupidQuestions,feh43qy,t1_feh3n84,1579108736.0,I think you misunderstand the whole “gender roles” argument. People just want to abolish the idea that certain things are ONLY for one gender. No one is saying that if you’re a man you can’t do traditionally “manly” things.
