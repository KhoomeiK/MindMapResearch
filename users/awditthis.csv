Mattress,feiu78q,t3_ehn1vc,1579147325.0,"Some poor soul found this on Google today.

I'm in a very similar situation! Just recently purchased a sleeopnlatex medium firm mattress. 

I adjusted the slats on my frame, however to be about 2.5 inches apart and while that helps, I can tell the slats are just not up to snuff. They flex in the middle far too much to be reliable over time.

Can you link the replacement slats your ordered?"
Mattress,feij8mw,t1_fehen5c,1579139797.0,"Well that's relieving to know. I've heard the same thing about the plywood solution and am cautious to take that approach.

But yeah, I am considering ordering the Box Spring and calling it a day because I wouldn't mind the extra 5"" of height to the bed.

But the price tag at $275.00 has me hesitant. I may go out to home depot and grab some 1 or 2 by's and give myself the peace of mind of distance between slats - and strength."

No matter how great the homes the pups go to may be, you don't know what the result of that ownership is going to be. If they don't spay and neuter, it is literally a probability tree unfolding.

When I say I had to euthanize *thousands of dogs*, that is no exaggeration, dude. It's heartbreaking. Not a job anyone wants to do.

If just one person you got the puppies to doesn't fix them, statiscally speaking you're going to have more dogs. Where do they go at that point? It's no longer in your hands, but it is preventable by your hands. So on and so on. The problem perpetuates. It sucks. But the resources and facts are available to educate yourself.

This is the nature of these posts. People post about their dogs having puppies and people reach out, sometimes very harshly to educate. At the end of the day, that is what all of these posters want you to know. Some of them much more dickish than others.

If you look at any of my posts to this thread, I'm not insulting you. I have no interest in insulting you over something you may be ignorant about. I want to do my part to tell you what you should know."

I mean I get it, you don't have to prove shit to us about where or how you homed the dogs, or if you're a breeder or anything like that.

But people need to spay and neuter. I had to euthanize *thousands* of puppies, cats, and dogs because people thought the shelter would find the pups a home. Well when everyone thinks that, you reach max capacity. And if rescues are full and people aren't adopting, you're left with a grim option.

You can pull up article after article about how people rove Craigslist and Facebook for puppies to mame and torture. Do you know the homes the dogs went to? Do you know if **they** will spay and neuter? Or will they perpetuate the issue?

The commenter is brash, but fuck man they are 100% right."

I asked them what's the biggest difference they had seen from their homelands VS the US. Without hesitation the British gal says, ""The way you all treat poor people.""

That has stuck with me. It wasn't acknowledging that they're homeless. It was acknowledging they have less. I guess it had never really resonated with me, and just her unrestrained and honest input was her honest observation.

I live in a fairly large city with an average amount of homelessness and notice myself all the time ignoring people or just thinking they are a nuisance. It's not that I'm a bad person for being that way, it's that there is a systemic issue that *no one can do fuck all about with the way the US government is designed to suppress lower classes*."
