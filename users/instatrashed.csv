SandersForPresident,fehcyd5,t1_fegvva1,1579113992.0,"And when you use quotation marks, it's important to actually quote what the person said... I never said ""he's on the left only."" Thats not the issue. Im talking about him being a bad choice for Democrats, not because he is a Democrat. He leans too far politically to capture a majority vote. This has already been proven once."
SandersForPresident,feh9oho,t1_fegvva1,1579112050.0,"One example - Wanting to get rid of existing health plans instead of allowing Americans to choose if they want to be on a private plan instead of free universal is out of touch. There are a lot of people that have existing health insurance coverage that do not want to jump ship for a new, untested program like Bernie is proposing. While universal healthcare is an excellent idea, there is no reason why private companies and networks can't or shouldn't coexist."
SandersForPresident,fegv7h8,t1_fegu02p,1579103274.0,"I never said I was the voice of anyone. Bernie Sanders is 78 years old. How can you argue he is in touch with the youth? While Bernie might be in touch with what the farther left leaning youth want policy-wise, his politics are too far on that end of the political spectrum to swing any votes that may be on the fence. If we want a candidate to win, they need to be someone that is not only going to get votes from people in their party, but also from voters who are on the other side and having doubts."

SandersForPresident,fegni88,t1_fegn85m,1579098024.0,"No... he is not in tune with the majority of young people, only a very small subset. He wasn't good enough to win last time and he is again a waste of a vote if you want Trump out of office."
