This is incorrect. You can have a physical dependence without any desire. For example, I once suffered from caffeine withdrawal (intense headaches), simply because I forgot of taking it (i.e lack of desire).

[See wikipedia for a correct definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence)

>Physical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance-forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms.
