unitedkingdom,fexgdr2,t1_feqxh66,1579430549.0,"Extraordinary! Reminds me of this....
""The Nazis were aware that education would create loyal Nazis by the time they reached adulthood. The Hitler Youth had been created for post-school activities and schools were to play a critical part in developing a loyal following for Hitler – indoctrination and the use of propaganda were to be a common practice in Nazi schools and the education system.
Enforcing a Nazi curriculum on schools depended on the teachers delivering it. All teachers had to be vetted by local Nazi officials. Any teacher considered disloyal was sacked. Many attended classes during school holidays in which the Nazi curriculum was spelled out and 97% of all teachers joined the Nazi Teachers’ Association. All teachers had to be careful about what they said as children were encouraged to inform the authorities if a teacher said something that did not fit in with the Nazi’s curriculum for schools. 
Subjects underwent a major change in schools. Some of the most affected were History and Biology. 

History was based on the glory of Germany – a nationalistic approach was compulsory. The German defeat in 1918 was explained as the work of Jewish and Marxist spies who had weakened the system from within; the Treaty of Versailles was the work of nations jealous of Germany’s might and power; the hyperinflation of 1923 was the work of Jewish saboteurs; the national resurgence which started under the leadership of Hitler etc.""   https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/nazi-germany/nazi-education/"

Quite apart from the obvious sex trafficking and child prostitution there is the whole care industry which can be very lucrative and is largely privately run, there are the legal professionals who work in the endless legal problems such children get in into, and so on. Whole professional edifices are created to supposedly deal with the problem of child abuse that somehow do not actually help or at best have little success in stopping the cycle of resultant drug abuse, violence and crime and prison. Its perhaps an odd way of looking at it all but there is a lot of money to be made from such children as they go through their damaged lives and a lot of it is from State funded sources."
