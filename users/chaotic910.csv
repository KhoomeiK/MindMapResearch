They wrote of the colosseum, and we can see there is *a* colosseum, but that doesn't automatically make the stories of it true. We draw a conclusion that the building they spoke of is the physical building in the style of the pictures they drew. 



They also spoke of gods and mythical creatures, but there's no physical thing to conclude with, so our best guess is that it's fantasy. A big difference is that no one looks at the Roman Empire and uses it as a hard guide for how we *should be required to live* as if it's an irrefutable fact given by divine beings.

Can win you the game if you mill out. You could also run cards that shuffle your graveyard into your library, but as others have said it's better to just throw down go on the offensive.

magicTCG,fe8s297,t1_fe8mabz,1578930063.0,"The stack can become pretty intense, but there's a LOT of tricks! If you already don't, I would highly recommend playing Arena. I learned a ton about the stack and things you can do with it just by seeing what people do to me lol. Another pretty big tenant that arena drilled into me is *when* to cast or use abilities. For example, you can use [[Unsummon]] before you declare attackers, before they declare blockers, after they pump an attacker, or at the beginning of thier end step (which I personally love because then they don't have the option to resummon even with mana)."
magicTCG,fe8hh1u,t3_eo4kmw,1578926180.0,"As others have said, it's when you say you're attacking with him that Drakuseth gets to deal his ability's damage. Anything that says ""when attacks"" happens when you say they're attacking, and before you're opponent gets to choose blockers. For example, if he had two 3/3s with flying you could attack with the dragon, kill the two fliers with the damage, then he wouldn't have anything to block with because he wouldn't choose them until *after* the ability resolves.


Magic is super literal with its wording, but that doesn't make it easy to comprehend all the time even for experienced players. One thing we constantly run into is spell copies. If someone has an effect that copies a spell ""when cast"", it gets copied the instant you say you're casting it. They can counter the original spell, but you've already gotten a copy on the stack, so they would need to use 2 counter spells to prevent it entirely. I just had this happen, I had 2 [[Unbound flourishing]] on the board, and cast [[Mind Grind]] with X being 11. As soon as I put it on the stack, I get 2 more copies of Mind Grind, then my opponents get a chance to counter it. My buddy tried to use [[Mana Tithe]] to stop all 3, but he would still need to discard until 22 lands came up instead of 33. 



He had 2 more counters in his hand, so he was able to fully prevent it, but point being that the wording of when something happens is insanely literal. [[Robber of the Rich]] is another 'when attacks' effect. When you declare them attacking, and before they choose blockers, if you have less cards in hand they exile the top card and you can cast it, even if they [[Shock]] the robber in response."
magicTCG,fe8cs8v,t1_fe6syz5,1578924838.0,"I would definitely buy singles. Deckbuilders toolkits aren't terrible to get your feet wet, and opening packs is fun, but if you know what kind of deck you're going for 9 times out of 10 you're better off just buying what you need. $20 for 1100 cards sounds good, but for that same $20 you could have just gotten a large part of a deck, especially if it's a win condition that flows with the rest. Bulk is fine to get a base collection going, but there's definitely a difference in having 4 of the same card vs 4 that are ""mostly"" similar. 



Also, be sure to really focus your decks at least at first. If you're going red aggro, keep it 99% red aggro. Trying to mix too many things into one deck will make it inconsistent, and your wins will be more luck than anything else. As an example, if you're building a mill deck, practically every card should be something that makes an opponent get rid of cards. You still want some creatures, but try to pick ones that further your goal, like [[Merfolk Secretkeeper]] or [[Vantress Gargoyle]], they provide mill while giving you some good defending creatures. 



Personally, might not be great meta advice, I try to always have some form of removal. I have a hydra deck that takes advantage of [[Unbound Flourishing]] and ramp mana like crazy to get huge X-cost creatures on the board. I have [[Voracious Hydra]] to help remove creatures, and [[Steelbane hydra]] for artifact/enchantment removal in lieu of an instant it sorcery. There are cheaper mana costed removals, such as [[Return to Nature]], but using a creature with a slightly higher cost of removal allows me to use it whether I need to remove something or not. Since my mana ramp allows me to splash into other colors, I also run [[Mind Grind]] to mill out my opponents, but I only run 1-2 as an ""if it happens"" scenario. 



As others have said, I would definitely hit up YouTube to see some cheap decks that can turn it wins, and check out certain keywords on gatherer.wizards.com and scryfall. Wanna build a wizards deck? See what every wizard is and how you can combine them"

On blizzards end, custom games are pretty much just a playpen, and it would be a nightmare for them to verify EVERY game to make sure players aren't getting scammed by creators.
