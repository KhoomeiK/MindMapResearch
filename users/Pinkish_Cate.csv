AskReddit,ff7s1je,t3_es4pt3,1579656967.0,I used the jeans twice then it’s off to laundry.
AskReddit,ff6b5h9,t3_erwjyc,1579623338.0,"Coz sometimes, it’s easier to hand wash than a real shirt?"
relationship_advice,ff6awn7,t3_erwkm3,1579623182.0,"I think you need to take a trip and clear your mind first. Then ask him again about his intentions. If his answer is not what you want to hear, then it’s time to cut him off from your life. The ROI is simply not gaining momentum on your part. Focus on other things so you can forget about it albeit gradually."
cats,ff69mvb,t3_erwi9g,1579622362.0,Upvote because I love his position and the expression. Priceless😍
phr4r,ff68ht5,t1_ff68bhr,1579621626.0,Merong mura sa labas ng Garin Farm sa San Joaquin. Kaso medyo malayo from Iloilo City. Medyo scarce ang souvenir shops sa Iloilo kasi urbanized na.
phr4r,ff67sbr,t3_erw3ut,1579621160.0,Gusto ko sana kaso mas bata ka sa akin. Haha!
phr4r,ff67otu,t3_erw4bh,1579621093.0,"Try Breakthrough Restaurant. The best ang seafood nila. For souvenirs, meron sa Molo Mansion pero medyo pricey."
AskReddit,ff674r0,t3_erw2tg,1579620719.0,"It’s not really major but still, I wanna share it. There was this guy at the coffee shop who approached me and my sister saying that his contracted driver ditched him. He asked money (Php1,500) for his fare back to his province which is like four hours away. So I gave him money not expecting him to return it but he said he cannot sleep at night if he wouldn’t pay for it. So I just let it be since he was damn insisting. Turned out it was a scam because he kept rejecting my sister’s call when she tried reaching out to know if he arrived safely. Btw, he claimed he was half Spanish half Filipino and that his mother abandoned him when he was 3 years old and he was looking for her thru Jessica Soho TV show. Still, you can’t blame me if I fell for it. I have a soft spot for lost creatures."

CasualPH,ff0vc9l,t1_feyjugv,1579472646.0,You’re welcome. 🙂
CasualPH,feyj9x6,t1_feyhlvi,1579446214.0,"Okay lang yun. Basta para mas madali ang thesis, dapat interesado ka sa topic mo and not just because you think the topic is cool. Nagbibigay naman ng pointers ang thesis adviser kung anong dapat gawin. Ready mo lang yung topic mo, laptop, printer, perang pambili ng pagkain pag burnout na ang utak (haha!) at syempre, isang drum ng confidence during thesis proposal presentation. Kami kasi merong ganun. Saan ka nag-i-MA? If you don’t mind me asking?"
CasualPH,feyiqbc,t3_eqqx0i,1579445988.0,My officemate convinced me to sign up for Reddit just for phr4r. She asked me if I was cultured shock over the posts. I said no but I was fascinated that there are A LOT of horny people out there. Some were even veterans when it comes to hook ups regardless of gender. Not being judgmental but it makes me wonder what happened at one point in their lives that they ended up what they are right now. It’s just my random musings. I don’t mean to offend people.
CasualPH,feyh2zp,t3_eqwvdt,1579445461.0,"Ano bang MA mo? It depends kasi sa area of interest mo din ang pipiliin mong thesis topic. Pero for me, it’s still early. Enjoy mo muna yung mga times na di ka pa busy. Besides, need mo pa ipasa ang compre before ka makapag-thesis. Well, ganun kasi sa school namin. Anyway, ako nga, until now, di ko pa nire-revise yung thesis ko. Haha!"
AskReddit,feva4lk,t3_eqp11v,1579394988.0,"I was so nervous I drank the brewed coffee without eating a meal prior. After 30 minutes, my stomach hurts like hell. That went on for two weeks plus I cannot eat food that would trigger my stomachache."

memes,fev95om,t3_eqp1az,1579394606.0,Asian too. I took the second place in our class and my parents were not happy about it. Shouldn’t have said that. Really.
AskReddit,fev8wtf,t3_eqp1bj,1579394506.0,Maybe they have a fetish.
cats,fev7rg4,t3_eqp1xa,1579394194.0,So adorable. I don’t mind waking up to this. And that pink nose. 😍

CasualPH,fesug3x,t3_eqflkz,1579369110.0,"Same here. My friends told me I have a strong personality. Like I say anything that first comes to my mind. I think I have offended a lot of people. But I guess if you’re doing it to every person you meet, then that’s you having a strong personality. If there are certain types of people lang, that’s being a bitch."
AsianBeauty,fesqm3d,t3_epdznl,1579367993.0,"Philippines, anyone?"
dating,feso5f4,t3_eptv2z,1579367320.0,"The exact thing my friends and colleagues told me. I graduated from a top uni and working in the public sector. I’m currently working on my graduate thesis. I travel every quarter. They said my credentials are too intimidating plus the way I carry myself. So, long story short, no one wants to date me. Haha!"
dating,fesmn5e,t3_eq3odv,1579366843.0,"It depends. I wear two rings on my left ring finger. The first one I bought served as a promise ring to myself. The second one was given to me by my mom.

If you like a girl, you can just compliment her ring and maybe ask her where did her husband buy it? If she’s single and she likes you, maybe she’ll be honest about it. If she’s single but you’re not her type, she will lie about it.

If she answered your question in positive, then thank her. Off to next prospect, please."
femalefashionadvice,feseib6,t3_eqhwv9,1579364373.0,I always use Pinterest for my fashion inspiration. I always get compliments from people to the point that they look forward what I’m going to wear. I guess it just depends on words you use to search.
phr4r,feqiqyc,t1_feqgu7x,1579342347.0,Ano name ng place? Thanks!
phr4r,fepr19c,t3_eqcnxu,1579328385.0,Happy Birthday! Get well soon din.

AskReddit,feporhf,t3_eq1wzh,1579326343.0,If the guy I like will ask me on a real date and not just hook up.

UnsentLetters,fep4bhu,t1_feovck5,1579311832.0,Because there are things better left unsaid.
UnsentLetters,fep44br,t3_epyr7a,1579311703.0,"I can literally feel the emotions of the letter. I’m crying silently in my bed. Yes. We are selfish creatures. If we have a slice of cake, we want another slice. But you deserve better. You deserve someone who will love you more and do things that will make you smile silly even the smallest things."
UnsentLetters,fep3byi,t1_fenr5i2,1579311199.0,"I agree. You can be wasted in front of your guy friends and they wouldn’t do anything harmful to you. They would just make sure you got home safe. Also, I’m sorry that your first boyfriend raped you. Can’t imagine there are these kinds of people in the world. I hope you’re coping up."
literature,fep1n4f,t3_eo22ng,1579310128.0,I haven’t read any Henry Miller simply because I cannot find his works in bookstores near me. I don’t like ordering online because I hate the waiting game. But I have always associated him with Anäis Nin.
AsianBeauty,fep14pw,t3_eq5trq,1579309804.0,I like Luxe Organix Power Glow Serum.
ThriftStoreHauls,femzbo3,t3_epya6j,1579273427.0,This is a steal. Love it! 😍
AsianBeauty,femj81p,t1_femhj68,1579258356.0,Thanks! Will check it out. 🙂
AsianBeauty,femg9bv,t1_femfxni,1579253935.0,Oh I see. Where can I buy the SomeByMi Toner?
AsianBeauty,feme8iw,t1_femdf8h,1579250944.0,"I didn’t know that Luxe Organix has soothing lotion? Yes! Love their mists. I’m only using HN essential oils. Their other products are not effective for me. The Thayer’s, I admit it doesn’t necessarily remove dirt from face like Eskinol but it doesn’t make me break out so it’s fine until I see another toner."
AsianBeauty,fegwk93,t3_eo2k45,1579104133.0,"I’m following a Korean routine but I’m not necessarily using Korean products. 

Mornings:

Toner - Thayer’s Rose petals
Serum - Luxe Organix Power Glow
Moisturizer - Celeteque with Triple moisturizing system or Luxe Organix Aloe Vera Gel
Sunblock - Face Republic Gel SPF 50+

Nights:

Oil Cleanser - Human Nature Sunflower Oil
Cleanser - I tried Safeguard Detox but didn’t do much with my pimples so I changed to Dr. Wong’s Sulfur Soap. (Truth is I’ve yet to found the perfect cleanser for me.)
Toner - Thayer’s Rose Petal or Human Nature Balancing Toner with Elemi
Serum - Luxe Organix Miracle Serum (for blemishes)
Moisturizer- Luxe Organix Aloe Vera Gel

I exfoliate twice a week using exfoliating brush.

Hope this helps you."
Philippines,fegv3qm,t3_eozk5e,1579103207.0,Goal yung mga ganito. Chill chill lang.
