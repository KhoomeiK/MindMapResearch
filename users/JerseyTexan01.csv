MGTOW,fdthbny,t1_fdtd6qx,1578716762.0,"I think I know exactly where you’re coming from. I think our only disagreement is this: does going into a situation cause fault. Of course, I think it doesn’t. 

Here’s a hypothetical: Let’s say you would want to go shopping. So you go to a popular shopping center because it’s the only place around that has a shop you want to go to. However, since its popular, it means more traffic (which means more of a chance for an accident). So you’re on the road and you’re crossing an intersection and you have a green light when suddenly, you get t-boned by a guy who was speeding and distracted whole running a red (basically, there was nothing you could’ve done at the moment). Would the accident be your fault. I think any sane person would say it was the other person’s fault. The only way to have prevented this was by not going shopping that day, but of course, you wanted to go shopping. Even though you knew the risk and inserted yourself into a more dangerous situation (the shopping center), it’s still not your fault because you did not directly cause the accident (in terms of the hit rather than the situation). Now there is cause and effect in this to a degree, but none of it’s your fault because you did not want or do the accident, the other person did. 

I believe this can be easily compared with rape at a frat party. It could’ve been prevented by not being at the party, but she had every right to be at the party (unless it was illegal, but that’s something else). She deserves to have fun and being at a party is part of that for her. Being at a party doesn’t make it her fault. She didn’t do anything that directly caused her to be raped (in terms of the action of it happening). She did not consent to it. It didn’t matter what signals she gave away or what she was wearing: if she did not clearly consent to having sex, it’s not her fault. If she did consent, it’s not rape. 

Sorry for the essay of a response. I’m just trying to cover as much ground as I can. This’ll also probably be the last time I respond regarding my stance as these discussions can be exhausting. I also am about to be really busy as I have to pack for college and all. I did enjoy our discussion as it’s good to listen to what other people have to say. I hope you have a good weekend."
MGTOW,fdtczw5,t1_fdt4rgo,1578715004.0,"I mean, it’s true. When people have thoughts of raping another person, they’re viewing them as an object of their personal pleasure more than as a human being with the same amount of rights and have the capability to feel pain. This can happen regardless of a situation or clothing somebody is wearing. It’s still wrong, even if they don’t set themselves up for success. We shouldn’t put any blame on a victim simply because they didn’t consent and the other person disregards that and still carries on against the victim’s will, no matter how the person was dressed or acting prior. 

Now, we can still teach people (guys and girls) how to create situations that help prevent instances of rape (buddy systems, protecting passed out people at parties, being careful about signals, etc). There’s still no guarantee as like you said, a lot of rape tends to happen between at least acquaintances rather than strangers at a party.  We all know that certain situations (like frat parties) can more often lead to rape, but we shouldn’t blame a woman for going or for getting black out drunk."
MGTOW,fdt3uc8,t1_fdsjji5,1578711564.0,"Agreed. I believe we should set ourselves up for success. However, it’s not her fault for something she can’t control. No one has the right to rape someone no matter what the victim is wearing or doing (being at a party). To say that her being at a bad party makes it partially her fault is like saying it’s a person’s fault for getting into an accident because they drove on that street. It could’ve been prevented if they didn’t drive down that street, but it’s not their fault somebody ran a red and t-boned them. It’s the same thing with the party thing. The rape could’ve been prevented if she wasn’t at the party or if she came with a backup plan, but that doesn’t make it her fault that somebody decided it was appropriate to violate her against her informed consent. I see where you’re coming from though. We just have to make sure we’re not victim blaming. 

And if there was a very rare circumstance where somehow the rape was the woman’s fault (I couldn’t even think of such a situation), it shouldn’t be reflected on every other rape case."

I’ve seen my own mother protect me countless times, whether it was immediate danger or not. Whenever my dad got laid off (happened a few times), we had to depend on my mom just to get by (she doesn’t have a college degree due to a medical issue at the time and makes almost 6 figures). She would make sure the street was clear before my 6 year old self would run across it. She’s not perfect either. She had a terrible childhood that hindered the way she know how to be a mother, but she swore to be better than her mother. It’s been a blessing having someone like her to look up to.
