insanepeoplefacebook,fecgrsi,t1_fecfj8f,1578973545.0,"* Cynthia Osborne, who is on the UT-Austin faculty along with Regnerus, argued the study was unable to show ""whether same-sex parenting causes the observed differences."" She also said that ""Children of lesbian mothers might have lived in many different family structures, and it is impossible to isolate the effects of living with a lesbian mother from experiencing divorce, remarriage or living with a single parent."" Similarly, Gary Gates of the Williams Institute argued that the study's comparison of children of lesbian mothers was a less fair comparison than, for instance, comparing ""children of heterosexual or same-sex couples who were raised in similar homes""


* In July 2012, over 150 scientists wrote a letter to the editor of Social Science Research criticizing the study and raising concerns about the journal's peer review process

* The audit concluded that the peer-review process failed in these instances because of “both ideology and inattention” by the reviewers; he added that of the six reviewers, three of them were on record as opposing same-sex marriage.

* Becker and others expressed suspicion on the fact that Regnerus' study had taken only six weeks to be published after it was first submitted, while other papers in the same issue took an entire year.

* relied on paid consultants to review the paper and failed to disclose this when the study was first published.

* Two subsequent studies published in Social Science Research and Sociological Science claimed that when methodological flaws were removed from data used in Regnerus study, the conclusions were opposite.
