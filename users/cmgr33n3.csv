You mean, your point, right? Because the problem of evil is claiming that all of the premises can't be true if the conclusion is true which means that any one of the premises would need to be changed (God doesn't exist, God isn't benevolent, God isn't all powerful, etc.) for the conclusion to be coherent. So the problem of evil and be introduced to claim any of those things.

I would think it makes it easier to prepare an argument if you already know what the likely response will be. Though I would expect that feeling too assured about what I thought a response would be would likely make me overlook other weaknesses my own argument."
todayilearned,feeu1nt,t1_feepixz,1579041205.0,"I'm an atheist who doesn't understand who hasn't been expressing his own beliefs about religion in a conversation about reason and doesn't understand why you felt the need to, twice, preach your beliefs about religion in a conversation about reason. For the third time, your stance on religion was clear before you explained it (both times). I guess it was important to you to distinguish between different types of religion because you apparently have different beliefs about different religions, so okay. But again, not one is asking for your stance on religion(s) and I only repeat that they bring nothing to the actual topic of whether the problem of evil is a logical fallacy or not.

&#x200B;

Hmm. Maybe this all devolved from the fact that you seem to be partial to using fallacy simply to mean wrong when in logic it has a much more precise meaning  and in fact there are many types of fallacies. So when CountSudoku used it in response to rdevaughn's restatement of the problem of evil, you understood CountSudoku's response to be him just claiming rdevaughn was simply ""wrong"" about God not existing and I took CountSudoku to be claiming the problem of evil is a logical fallacy (which doesn't pass judgement one way or the other on whether God exist but just whether rdevaughn's argument is valid or not, i.e. that the idea of God is not impossible in a word where evil exists)."

todayilearned,febodec,t1_febm2r7,1578961021.0,"The problem of evil is a logical argument refuting the existence of God. It includes the premise that God exists because it is intending to show that that premise is contradictory with the existence of evil. The whole point of presenting the problem is to point out the contradiction. If you agree with that then you agree with the conclusion of the problem itself.

Resolutions to the problem of evil are the arguments attempting to show the flaws in the problem. 

Yes, if you just state you believe God doesn't exist then you can avoid going any further. But then all you've done is state your belief and that is no more powerful or useful than anyone else's beliefs."

&#x200B;

If you think the core issue is with the premise that God exists in the first place then you would seem to be more in favor of the conclusion of the problem (evil and God can't co-exist, evil certainly exists, thus God does not) rather than any of the resolutions (the arguments attempting to ""resolve"" the problem of evil for those attempting to hold that God exists)."

&#x200B;

The unnamed fallacy claim in CountSudoku's post is, likely, the ""false dilemma."" A false dilemma is a case in which someone claims two statements are contradictory to argue that a position that relies on both is incoherent. The accusation that such an argument is a ""false dilemma"" is itself a claim that the two statements are not contradictory (regardless of whether either statement is itself true or ""proven"") and thus defends a position that holds both statements to be true as not incoherent for doing so (regardless of whether the position is incoherent in other ways or in fact true in itself).  The two statements, in this case, would be that God is benevolent (here likely meaning ""perfectly good"" or ""perfectly merciful"") and that evils exists in the world (or perhaps more precisely, ""is allowed to exist in the world by God"")."

personalfinance,fdf3cx7,t1_fdf1f6w,1578352372.0,"Politicians write the tax laws. They take money from corporations. Corporations have a HUGE financial interest in both keeping the tax code incredibly advantageous for themselves and keeping it complex and opaque to the ordinary citizen. This makes it so even citizens with the most ordinary tax profiles would rather 1) pay for someone (or software) to do their taxes but also 2) feel simultaneously burdened and mistrustful of the tax system itself so they are more easily convinced into opposing tax changes that would actually improve things for citizens by just calling such changes ""big government"" or ""class warfare"" or ""wealth redistribution.""

At the same time, parasitical companies like Intuit (the makers of the most popular, for profit, tax assistance software in the US) are seen by their customers as relieving the burden of filling taxes, when they are actually a primary actor in keeping the filling of taxes burdensome by lobbying politicians against changes that would make it easier and in favor of laws that keep the government from providing their own assistance to citizens."
