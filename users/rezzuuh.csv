battlestations,fekceo7,t3_ep60op,1579197122.0,Excellent........booming speakers....headphone set up.....4 monitors with a microphone. Madness of the highest quality and purity.
battlestations,fekc7va,t3_epjq4t,1579197009.0,You ought to add another monitor or two - you have the space.
battlestations,fekc670,t3_epjwb4,1579196982.0,Now THIS is a battle station.

I like it for what it is. It's not a battle station. Maybe an unpopular opinion."

I'm not defending religion, but lets not lambast the concept and ignore its potential to inspire, create, and progress."

jobs,feh8oq2,t1_feh5xou,1579111448.0,HEAVEN FORBID that employers hire someone based on their disability and that potential employees don't apply to such places that do that.
battlestations,feh11ih,t3_ep05n0,1579106900.0,"I love how some set-ups don't get the pass but this ""battle station"" (not even a battle station) gets passed.

jobs,feh0uqn,t1_fegx99c,1579106788.0,"""\[If someone isn't perfect\], they shouldn't go for a full time job"". 

Right...........remember that when you are sick. Batha\_poodoo was making a hyperbolic statement about someone's health preventing them from working. The person who calls in sick 3 days a week could have those issues which may resolve themselves in due time. That shouldn't prevent them from applying to full time jobs and securing their futures."
