ChronicPain,ff6ggcf,t1_ff6eere,1579626663.0,"So I can really only speak to the clinic I'm going to right now,  and the closest thing they ever did to an appointment was tell you to be there at 5o clock in the morning,  and that it would take at least 3 hours the first time... if you're asking me if you could go to a pain management clinic while going to a clinic for methadone at the same time  I'm not sure how you could since they do random drug testing at both sites. Basically what you would have to do would be to A. Convince the pain management clinic that you were in the methadone clinic purly for the pain managing properties of methadone,  (which actually as I write this, I'm thinking that it was pretty easy when I told my neurologist.  I honestly wasn't going to tell them first,  but they too did drug testing so...)  and if you have a documented condition that causes pain then you could bring that to back it up.  Option B would be to wean off the methadone before you get into the poison management clinic,  but that's extremely hard to do,  and they don't make it easy on you either!  I hope that answered your question,  and Good luck!"
ChronicPain,ff67lcy,t1_ff67apl,1579621029.0,"Yeah and the thing with kraykray, lol is that no one has ever od'd solely from this plant. They tried and contribute like four deaths to it, but when they did autopsies/ tox screens on the bodies,  the people literally had a combo of around 7 other hardcore street drugs in their systems.

ChronicPain,ff66rfp,t3_errubc,1579620476.0,"You would think that a ""pain specialist"" would actually care about helping you get out of pain?

May I ask why you said that any post with that word will end up in the spam filter?  Quite frankly until they stupidly banned it in my state (there's only 3 now.  Tennessee's got lifted about a year back)  I used this every day not only for my chronic pain but also for my anxiety.  I've seen every prescription painkiller in the book spoken about on here,  but a plant goes into the spam filter?  Please don't think I'm being snarky.  I honestly just don't understand that reasoning.  Help me out here?  Lol"
ChronicPain,ff64j0p,t1_ff61pls,1579618938.0,"I'm glad to know it helped.  I just cannot even imagine letting someone who is already in so much pain go blindly into that,  but I know they do! Just this morning, i had to get ready and go to the clinic ( I do it before my husband goes to work so I don't have to take my babies with me)  and I was waiting outside the clinic in 23 degrees. I already haslve arthritis in my low back,  so that was killing me,  and everything else was aching like you wouldn't believe.  But if I waited,  they only dose until 10 in the morning sto either way my morning is fucked up.  Like I said thru don't tell the people all these little details.  I guess they want them to figure or the hard way, and by then they're hooked.  I have considered so many times just not going,  but I swear to you,  those dts put me on my knees!"

St the very least I finally got some damn Medicaid that pays for some stuff, but I told my neurologist not to every again prescribed me this damn greylisse shit. Supposed to be an extended release form if gabapentin. When I looked at the cash price for once months bottle I quite literally nearly shit I'm my pants.  1,005$. You would have thought when you opened the bottle jesus christ himself woulda come outta there and served it to you with some of his miracle wine.  That didn't happen, and it really didn't work any better that neurontin! I told her flat out don't give me anything that I could not go hock a tv at a pawn shop and afford! They seem to think bc we can afford to be there seeing them we must have money right?  Grrrrrr!"
ChronicPain,ff54gol,t1_ff3majd,1579579966.0,"You know it's doctors like him that were the reason I'm now 35 and have been dealing with chronic pain since before I was 20 because I've just now found a neurologist who listened to me when I said I'd been dealing with it for going on 20 years.  She actually put forth some effort to try and figure out what was going on, and yeah.  Three+ pinched nerves I'm just my legs alone,  plus 3 bulging discs in my back.  She hasn't even discussed a plan for fixing it yet , BBC she's pretty sure she's going to find more when she does the nerve conduction studies in my arms.  Yet I actually said I was a pill addict just so I could go to a methadone clinic and get methadone for the pain.  I'm about a month away from being done with that....WORST IDEA EVER! I know that for active opioid addicts they say it's awesome for them,  but in my case,  I felt it was sort of akin to saying, "" hey I have a scratch on my arm. QUICK SOMEONE GRAB THE CHAINSAW!!!!! "" but that stuff turned me into an addict in about 3 months."
ChronicPain,ff53to4,t1_ff3majd,1579579467.0,"Yeah.  That's the same so-called doctor who claimed the plant kratom was as ""dangerous as cocaine and as addictive as heroine"". I lost my respect for that man a long time ago."
ChronicPain,ff3ki7s,t3_erbpq8,1579542984.0,"Hey sailor sun bear! Can I suggest something? I'm not sure if you have ever heard of it before, actually 2 things:  first kratom. I don't know where you live,  but barring being on the bumfuck  hickass state of Alabama where I'm at, you should be able to find out at ant gas station that it's not a chain store (like marathon or kangaroo). One of the liquid forms is the original viva zens, which basically look like black and red five hour energy shots.  Now what this stuff does, is it is a plant, and it comes in many different strains and several different colors. The viva zens are just your basic liquid kratom. When you drink it,  in about 15 to 20 minutes,  you will start feeling an energy burst,  plus  a slight opioid buzz! Also, it helps with anxiety.  I am not kidding you when I say I used this plant to help with chronic back pain for around 8 years before they banned it in Alabama,  claiming some bullshit that it was "" as dangerous as cocaine and more addictive than heroine. "" now I'll be the first to tell you some very basic facts about this plant.   If you look st the news stories they did on it, they claimed that there have been multiple deaths resulting from an overdose of kratom.  What they fail to mention in the title or first paragraph of these stories is that more often than not, the person who died was on multiple other drugs including but not limited to opioids,  benzos and cocaine.  If you ho to any article speaking out against kratom, make it a point to read the comments.  Usually it's people who have had a serious pain problem, and they ordered kratom to kick their pain killer habit,  which leads you to the real reason it was banned.  Big pharma was losing money bc people were starting to get off their pain pills using kratom. I have found a vape shop just over the Tennessee border where I can buy a7 oz's bag of powder for 40$. Get you something in the red color.  Red Bali is awesome for pain,  and white Maeng Dae is great for mental and physical energy.  Also, you CANNOT overdose on this stuff. Believe me,  I and some of my friends have tried. Lol whether knowingly or not we won't go into detail.  Either way, if you take too much,  you will get nuaseated and possibly throw up.  That's it.  Nothing more. 
The other thing I'll tell you is a little bit riskier, for the simple fact that it cam be habit forming.  If you've seen in the gas stations a black bottle of pills called TIANAA, they are made of something called tianeptine.  This stuff is not regulated in the US, and only in Canada do you actually need a script to buy it. It is quite pricey,  with a bottle of 15 pills running close to 30$. Now they price it like this bc they claim you're only supposed to take 1 or 2 at a time, with no more than 3 in a twenty four hour period.  Listen to those instructions.  That's all I'll say about that. However, they work awesomely.  Not only physically,  but they give your mind a boost of mental energy like you wouldn't believe! Try one of  these 2 things.  I promise you. They'll make a huge difference!  Hope it helps!"
aww,ff3i00w,t3_ercfak,1579541452.0,Absolutely love the names!!!
depression,ff2vkbh,t3_er2si8,1579525820.0,"I don't know if this will help any of you guys or not,  but after finding out that I have type 2 bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder AND PTSD AND Generalized anxiety disorder and, that I'm now prediabetic,  I had a breakdown yesterday bc I have been told to either cut out all carbs and sugars or become full blown diabetic. How does this pertain to your plight you ask?  Well I'll tell you....I lived the first ten years of my adult life out of a bottle of vodka.  People, including socall3d friends as well as family,  wrote me off as an alcoholic, even though that was not at all true. I drank vodka, and maybe you guys can somewhat relate to this,  because it was the only thing in my life that did exactly what it promised to do. Unlike my family who hurt and abused me,  my husband who broke my heart and abandoned me,  my friends who literally left me in a lurch,  the vodka never lied and was always there when I needed it.  And yes, I know there's going to be at least one person who pops up with ""well doesn't that mean you're an alcoholic? "" no.  It doesn't.  It means I was hurting in my heart and soul in a way that other people couldn't even begin to understand, and if you cannot understand my disease,  how the hell can you begin to fathom my cure? 
I drifted along like that for a very long time, watching everyone else find love, happiness, success, and I remember thinking why the hell am I so defective that I can't be like them? What is it about me that is so ugly and misshapen that people look through me to see the person behind me?! I drank to numb my broken heart,  I drank to pretend I didn't care, but most of all I drank because at the end of the day,  the alcohol never lied to me as did everyone in my life.  
Now I don't know where you're at in your life.  I know that from your writing,  there's an underlying anger towards yourself, as though maybe your mad that you're not ""normal""like everyone else?  Well here's the thing about that..... you are you,  and the longer you refuse to accept that,  the more unhappy you will be, and the more unhappy you are, the Angrier you will be with yourself... so you're stuck in this very viscous cycle.  I don't come at this from a ""well I studied psychology in college and have a degree "" or ""well my therapist said this....."". I'm telling you from the experience of someone who grew up in an atmosphere that well..yeah ok a therapist did say this.... that the environment that my sisters and I grew up in ""was conducive to raising serial killers"" and that my adopted parents had used techniques that were used by north Korea on their prisoners of war on us.  We were raised believing that we were pieces of shit,  that whatever God was up there hated us because we were so horribly sinful (not sure how when they kept us socially isolated by homeschooling us,  and we went from Sunday to Sunday without talking to a single person outside the house). When I reached adulthood,  I was literally thrown to the proverbial wolves, and yeah.  When my first husband abandoned me,  it was shortly after that I tried to off myself.  
Just from reading your post,  I can sense anger at yourself,  which tells me that you're not ready to give up.  You expected more from yourself, from life,  and something has caused you to become very disillusioned with it all.  So can you take some advice from someone who has walked through a little bit of hell herself?  First,  Forgive yourself for not meeting all your expectations.  We can plan our lives down to the minute,  and nine times out of ten, shit still will not go down like we planned it.  Always have a plan A, B, and 47 and 1/3. Lol second,  stop comparing your life with those that you consider ""normal"". Every minute you waste wishing you were like them is a minute you could be spending discovering who you really are. Third, open your self up to change. You have to be willing to let life lead you where it will,  and that my friend can be very scary and very exhilarating all at the same time.  Start learning new things. Even if you struggle with it.  Learn a new language.  Learn sudoku.  Something that I have found that helps me on my worst days,  when I have a depressive episode from hell (type 2 bipolar disorder it's where I don't get the hyperactive episodes.  I just get the lovely hyper depressive episodes that last for weeks on end.  Lol leave it to me to pick the right one yeah? ) is just to put something beautiful in the world.  No matter how small it is,  just make something beautiful that wasn't there before.  You'll be surprised at what it will do for your soul. My friend, you're not ready to give up on life.  You know how I know that? Because if you were,  you never would have posted on here.  And your post wouldn't have head such an undertone of personal anger towards you.  At the end of the day,  we have to play the cards we're dealt,  and man,  some days that absolutely SUCKS!  It is so easy for me to sit here and tell you not to compare your life to others,  and yet that is the problem with which I struggle the absolute hardest! That and playing the ""what if""game.  ""What if I'd been born rich? "" ""what if my parents had encouraged my music when I told them I wanted to play classical piano? "" It's a waste of gray matter pure and simple bc it's not going to change one damn thing! So here ends my sermon, that by the end of my writing it, ends up being just as much  if not more so for me than you.  Be kind to yourself my friend, forgive yourself,  and start believing that you deserve to be happy.  Because barring you throwing a baby out the window,  you truly, truly do. Toodles! 🤪😋😃"

I'm just glad I finally literally stumbled over one who seems to actually care?  Lol but before this year, I was becoming very depressed about my future.

Isa line I said before just not knowing what you have is so mentally draining in and off itself, BBC you starting wondering if it's in your head or something! The first thing I'll tell you is this; find a different provider.  The moment that nurse started taking as though you weren't there,  she stopped seeing you as a person or a patient.  Since this neurologist,  it just amazed me how many times I saw a doctor or nurse practitioner who pretty much treated me as though I were an inferior being.  If you realize your provider is lacking in compassion,  and i realize that it's hard,  you probably want to find another one!  What state are you in? I know when I injured my back that last time, the first time I went to the ER I wad literally laying in the floor crying.  The security guard tried to make me get up.

After that, they wanted to do 4 nerve conduction studies on me, which all ran 498$apiece.  Only bright side of a divorce,  I was able to get on Medicaid.

ChronicPain,feh1ugk,t1_fegrmdf,1579107391.0,"I will keep that in mind! At this point I'm not going to lie,  I don't know exactly where to attribute all my pain over the last 15 years.  The psychiatrist said she thought a good bit of it came from the depression and bipolar disorder,  and the neurologist says a lot if it for sure came from the bulging DISCS/ pinched nerves.  All I know is it had gotten to a point where I literally felt like one walking ache with just sharper degrees of pain in other places. Lol that's one of the things that annoys me so damn much about how the doctors treated me,  is that they left me with no explanation to the point where I just began to believe that everyone hurt like this all the time.  It honestly wasn't until I met my present husband that he began to see how much pain I was in all the time. Also, after the fact of the first doctor accusing me of being an alcoholic, in sort of a self fulfilling prophecy, I began to drink heavily, not only to numb myself physically but also mentally.  Coming out of that after ten years was quite a shock, as again, didn't really appreciate just how much of my body was hurting all the time.  So I guess what I'm saying is while my pain is chronic,  it's not chronic pain syndrome.  Does that make sense?  I don't want anyone to think I'm trying to mimic anyone's diagnosis for sympathy or anything.  It's honestly just been so long since a doctor actually tried to help me,  that I really have no clue where which pain is coming from! My left front thigh is also partially numb from that last back injury that I wrote about that had me down for 3 weeks,  and that was close to 2 years ago! I have just taught myself to downplay all pain symptoms for my own sanity,  otherwise I just got treated like an addict.  I'm  kind of having to learn how to rethink here.  Lol"

So when he popped off ""well what weather exactly do you like?!"" I just got out of the car and went into the doctor's office.  I am also a pianist, and recently graduated college with a degree in piano. When I performed in recitals, I had trouble with sweat dripping in my eyes while playing.  People would never know the absolute humiliation I would feel, when I would stand up in class,  turn to gather my things, and stare in horror at the sweaty assprint that was left in my chair!!! Thus began the ritual of pause, slide forward, slide back, slide forward and hope i didn't miss any of the sweat that I left over!  Yes my friend, it is a big thing, it is an uncomfortable thing, and i totally and without question feel your pain. I can only hope that one day I find something that can help me hey control as some if the others have.  Until then,  at least know you're not alone."

ChronicPain,feeditz,t3_eh8w23,1579031523.0," going to pop in here... first time ever posting in this sub,  but after reading a lot of the comments I'm here,  I'm feeling less and less alone!   I have had chronic back pain coupled with clinical depression,  plus bipolar disorder child with borderline personality disorder (the therapist lovingly carried me a border bipolar bear.  Lol hey you have to laugh or you'll cry and get depressed and go manic and then it just all goes to shit) . The back pain spawned from a severe case of scoliosis where one of my legs is quite shorter than the other,  and on any given day if I move just one way wrong,  some muscles get tweaked and I'm in severe pain for weeks.  Now that it's on top of the body ache pain that comes from the depression.  However, when I first hit adult years,  and began to seek medical help for my pain,  the first thing the doctor did was tell me to lose weight.  I was 5'9 and weighed 220. Now while that might strike everyone as heavy,  I have always weighed more than anyone would guess, and if I did weigh what my so-called target weight is supposed to be, I'd look skeletal.  After that,  the same doctor refused to prescribe me anything for inflammation,  only recommending otc products stick as tylenol or aleve. I learned later on from glancing at his notes that due to one comment I had made about a birthday party o had recently thrown where me sister and I had drank together,  he had written me off as an alcoholic,  and therefore refused to prescribe me anything!!! I changed doctors needless to say, but continued to have problems because of the so-called ""opioid epidemic"" where everyone and their aunt's cat suddenly began having ""back pain"". (And you all know I'm not referring to any of you. People who don't know chronic pain really don't know chronic pain! ) long story short,  for the next decade or so, any medical help I sought out resulted in the same thing; a doctor telling me that I needed to lose weight.  When I told them I couldn't exercise because aside from the pain in my back,  my entire body ached all the time,  their next answer was to put me on antidepressants which would all end up the same way.  I would end up a zombie within three weeks. Up until this last year,  I have had no solid answers my health problems. It was to the point where I had almost given up on thinking there was any kind of a solution.  My back problems almost prevented me from graduating college with my piano degree,  because an injury my last semester was so severe that I was literally flat on my back for 3 weeks.  
I began to take counseling in college for several issues stemming from childhood abuse, and due to talking to the counselor, was advised to seek out more professional mental help at a state run facility.  I did,  and within the first appointment was given a diagnosis the bipolar/ borderline personality disorder with clinical depression, PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder.  At first I was embarrassed, almost ashamed of the diagnosis,  but upon realizing that I had fought with something that was a genuine mental illness,  one that my biological mother had (I was adapted at a very young age) and that I had dealt with this alone for a very, very long time.  Also, I was advised to go and see a neurologist concerning some other problems.  Lo and behold,  the doctor upon seeing that I had dealt with my back pain for going on 20 years,  actually listened to everything I told her,  and as of today,  I learned I have at least 3 severely pinched nerves along with 4 bulging discs.  That, along with the body ache from the depression is something that has plagued me literally for 15 years now. Because of the snideness of doctors,  the judgemental attitude of people who don't have chronic pain,  and people who use terms like ""bipolar"" and ""depressed"" as insults, or treat you as though you deserve to hurt for some sort of divine punishment,  I had almost lost hope of ever finding any kind of help for this problem.  But even just knowing that there are pinched nerves in my back,  bulging discs,  I almost cried in relief,  knowing that it wasn't all just in my head!  When you are in pain,  you are in pain.  Don't let anyone tell toy it's something you deserve, or that you're over exaggerating,  bc until they're in you're body,  they'll never know!"

I've suffered from chronic depression/ pain All my life, and my solution for the first 10 years of my adult life was to drink at least a pint of vodka a day, or a half gallon bottle every 2 days,  whichever happened first.  I finally had to make peace with myself before anything else could fall into line.  We're live in an age where we're judged by how many Facebook friends we have, or how social we are. But for those of us who don't feel like being social all the time,  we tend to turn on ourselves and think something is wrong with us bc we cannot be like others.  Well I'm 34 now,  and only in the last 6 years made peace with the fact that I'm never going to be like others my age,  and I'm never going to be ""happy""by their standards.  When I finally accepted that. And started finding healthier ways to cope with my depression and anxiety,  then things changed.  I found my soulmate, and we've been married 5 years and have 2 little girls.  Please don't think I'm trying to rub my life in your face, or tell you to be like me,  I'm just telling you I know how you feel, and when I started being more compassionate and understanding with myself,  things started looking up.  I have also finally accepted the fact that something is chemically wrong with me, and have finally accepted the fact that I'm not only bipolar and suffering from several different forms of PTSD, but my bipolar disorder overlaps with my borderline personality disorder,  and I fall somewhere right in the middle between the two.  So this is the year momma is taking meds.  Go easy on yourself hun. You may not think you're all that and a bag of chips, but there may even now be someone in your world who waits to see you every day, who watches the clock to see your smile.

Ok well since the link didn't work...So someone posted on Facebook a picture of the hallway of shoes in the holocaust museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know what this is,  it's one of the most heartbreaking rooms of the museum.  It has one path cleared down the middle of the room, and on either side are piles upon piles of shoes , adult sized and child sized.  These were the shoes they found in the anteroom just before the gas chamber at a concentration camp.  The people were made to take off their clothes and shoes,  oft times told that they were fixing to be released,  that that only had to be disinfected once more.  They were then lead to their death in the gas chambers.  The photo was accompanied by the following text: 
""To all the kids who walked out of school to protest guns. These are the shoes of Jews who gave up their firearms to Hitler. They were then led into gas chambers, murdered and buried in mass graves. Pick up a history book and you'll realize what happens when you give up freedoms and why we have them.""
So just for starters,  with the sentence ""these are the shoes of Jews who gave up their firearms to Hitler--"" they basically just blamed the Jews for their own demise.  Now I don't know about anyone else,  but I never read anything about Jews surrendering firearms to Hitler. Also, to the kids who walked out of school to protest GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS? You should all be commended for your courage and willingness to do something to encourage change, especially when you guys were some of the ones MOST EFFECTED by the school shootings. As to the original poster of this crock of absolute crap--- unless you happen to be one of the few who survived a concentration camp,  you should probably shut your mouth because you obviously haven't picked up a history book since the end of World War 11. So to all who see this post, I ask you: is this more ignorant, or more insulting?  There is an entire generation of children right now who have to cope with the very real threat of school shootings almost every day.  Gone are the days of fire drills,  now they do emergency drills in case of a shooter. How many of the kids who survived one of these traumatic events went on to be so affected by survivors guilt that they took their own lives?  I know of at least one.  I'm proud of the children who protested, and I hope with all my heart that their courage helps us to see a solution in this devastating and all- too- common occurrence.  I want to know what other redditors think about this.  Even if you disagree that's cool.... please no insults... we are all adults here.  Just want to know I'm not alone when it comes to this one!"

It just amazes me that this man would actually start a World War 111 before he would actually accept responsibility for the entire scandal that brought about his WELL DESERVED impeachment! How many feel like this is what happens when people stopped paying attention to his 136+ tweets over the holidays? Just wondering....."
depression,fd2nyqz,t3_ejnao7,1578149917.0,"Yep! It's all part of the lovely depression package! Yet another reason why people who don't have it have no clue how to deal with it,  because they see what you just wrote and say ""oh you're just feeling sorry for yourself! "" but the fact is you actually lack empathy for yourself bc you see yourself as someone undeserving of the time and advice of others! So much of depression stems from lack of self love as well as confidence.  If someone else had wrote your post,  would you not have replied to them with kindness and compassion,  because you sincerely felt their pain and understand what they're dealing with?  I think all of us who post here can say we understand at least a couple of the same aspects of depression if not more!  So all that to say this.... give yourself a break.  I know it's hard some times, especially on a very down day.  But when all else fails,  put yourself in the shoes of someone else,  and read what you wrote as though it were someone else's post.  See if you're not far more capable of analyzing when you yourself need a moment of compression from no one else other than you!  And just so you don't feel alone, I've felt everything you've just described on more than a few occasions!"
worldpolitics,fcsykp6,t1_fcojx3z,1577928354.0,"I just have to say...even when someone is speaking from the heart, by all means, mock and ridicule, b.c. at the end of the day,  it's easier to ridicule anyone who actually FEELS SOMETHING.  . Than it is to feel something yourself... oh I'm so sorry I yelled at you..... forgot about CAPS LOCK."
worldpolitics,fcoqot6,t1_fcoqfu8,1577838998.0,"Not really yelling at anyone.... just very frustrated with this fighting that the politicians love so much.  As long as we're fighting,  they win because we're are distracted. Since I posted this,  not one word of statement, just a lot of ridicule. Guess that's the age we live in now."
worldpolitics,fco01jm,t1_fcnyk9m,1577821645.0,"Oh yeah.  You again! Sarcasm doesn't translate well over text.  Ridiculous, but enough that you had to comment."
worldpolitics,fcnxqqd,t1_fcnxmrx,1577820502.0,Wow. Good comeback.
worldpolitics,fcnw9zp,t1_fcnvbep,1577819713.0,"It is so amazing to me that not one person can simply say ""hey you have a point"". I am not calling for ANY TYPE OF WAR. I simply said if we would remember the reason why America was made in the first place then maybe we could find our common ground, instead of allowing the 1% to con us into fighting against each other!!! And now that I write that out,  maybe it looks like class war, but all I was saying is we need to get back to our basic common denominator! And 1 paragraph wouldn't have helped me as cathartically as did this.  Lol"
worldpolitics,fcnsjo4,t1_fcnser3,1577817598.0,"Please tell me youweren't being sarcastic?  I literally cannot tell anymore, and I don't know why anyone would be attacking this.  It's common sense and what made the USA to begin with.  I just cannot tell I'm sorry."
worldpolitics,fcnsd7z,t1_fcnsa30,1577817501.0,Wow.  You are literally what's wrong with us.  Swallow your tongue please.
worldpolitics,fcnsal6,t1_fcnrzqu,1577817462.0,Figured it out... help me please? I'm crying after I wrote this... please help me get it out!
worldpolitics,fcns1i0,t1_fcnrzqu,1577817333.0,I'm not gonna lie...I don't know what that means....
worldpolitics,fcnqszn,t3_ei05bb,1577816688.0,"No no no.  This is not the way it is in the USA. WE THE PEOPLE,  GUYS,  REMEMBER WE THE PEOPLE?!! WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, INDEPENDENT,  WHATEVER,  THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE!!  If people would stop worrying about what party, what state,  listen if nothing more, to simply this:  WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT IMMIGRATION,  STRICTER GUN LAWS,  FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE PRESS,  CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO BACK TO THE BASICS?!
WE CAME HERE  BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT A KING!  WE DIDN'T WANT A DICTATOR!  WE WANTED A FREE COUNTRY WHERE THE PEOPLE.... LET ME REPEAT,  THE PEOPLE DECIDED!  

SO TO ALL US DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS,  INDEPENDENTS,  CHRISTIANS ATHEISTS,  WHOEVER YOU ARE AND WHOEVER YOU BELIEVE IN,  CAN WE JUST AGREE ON ONE POINT?? IF I COULD PUT THIS IN BIGGER CAPS I WOULD......

AS LONG AS WE THE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS IN CONTROL!!! AS LONG AS WE,  THE POOR, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE UPPER CLASS, WHATEVER OR WHOEVER YOU WOULD CALL YOURSELF, AS LONG AS WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER,  WHOEVER IS IN CONTROL, WHOEVER HAS THE MONEY,  WHOEVER WANTS TO KEEP THEMSELVES OVER THIS COUNTRY,  AS LONG AS WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER, THEY WIN!!!

AT THIS POINT,  IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO IS IN CHARGE..... IF I CONSIDER MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR , WHO HAPPENS TO BE A REPUBLICAN, MY MORTAL ENEMY,  THEN WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHO IS IN CHARGE BC WE ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER!!!! STOP LOOKING AT THEIR RELIGION, THEIR PARTY, WHATEVER ELSE WE SEE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE ALL AMERICANS!!!!! WHEN WE PLAY INTO TRUMP'S HANDS, OR THE DEMOCRATS HANDS OR THE WHITE NATIONALIST,  IT BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO WE ARE, AND FOR WHAT WE STAND! WE STAND FOR LIBERTY,  FREEDOM. AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS,  AND THE MOMENT WE FORGOT ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAD IN COMMON WITH OUR NEIGHBOR,  WE ALLOWED THE USA TO FRACTURE!!!
THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS OR THE PRESIDENT, OR WHO WILL WIN NEXT YEAR..... THIS IS ABOUT ME, YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR NEIGHBORS EVERYONE THAT LIVES IN THE USA.... OPEN YOUR EYES!! WE HAVE BEEN SET AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST SIX, SEVEN, HOWEVER MANY YEARS!  AS LONG AS WE ARE FIGHTING, AS LONG AS WE THE PEOPLE NO LONGER RECOGNIZE WHO WE ARE,  THE STRENGTH OF OUR UNITY AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR VOICE, AS LONG AS WE NO LONGER ACT WORTHY OF THESE LIBERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR SO DAMN HARD, then we the people will fade, and those that would control us, that would make this country something for their personal profit, they will rise.  And that is exactly what they're counting on! They are playing to our prejudices, our fears, our weaknesses, they are counting in us to destroy ourselves, so they can sweep in and""save us""!
LET'S REFUSE TO GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE!!! WHATEVER YOUR RACE, RELIGION, COLOR,  THE LEGACY OF THE UNITED STATES IS THAT WE ARE ABOVE THAT! WE ARE ABOVE FIGHTING OUR NEIGHBOR BECAUSE HE BELIEVES DIFFERENT FROM US, WE ARE ABOVE DENIGRATING OUR BROTHER BECAUSE HIS SKIN ISN'T THE SAME AS OUR SKIN! WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE THAT OUR FOREFATHERS HAD IN MIND....
WE THE PEOPLE! 
WE THE PEOPLE! 
WE THE PEOPLE! 
THAT DIDN'T SAY WE THE RICH,  WE THE WHITE, WE THE BLACK, WE THE ARISTOCRATS, WE THE HIGH SOCIETY....
WE THE PEOPLE! 
SIMPLY THE PEOPLE! IF WE COULD JUST GRASP THAT, GET BACK TO THAT ONE VERY BASIC CONCEPT, THAT WE'RE ALL PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WANT TO BE FREE! NO RACISM, NO CLASSES, NO POLITICS... SIMPLY WE THE PEOPLE.
We are all, white, African American, Latinos,  Asians, whoever else, Christian, Muslim, Atheists, Buddhist it DOES NOT MATTER!!! IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR RACE, YOUR CREED, YOUR STANDING IN SOCIETY, WHERE YOU WERE BORN, WHERE YOU LIVE, BECAUSE WE ARE THE PEOPLE  , and the day we forgot that fact,  the day we allowed ourselves to be divided , that was the day that the United states began to fracture. Because we the People, forgot we had a voice,  we the people, forgot we had a will.  We the people forgot that our love of liberty trumped skin color, race,  financial standing,  and any other dividing factor, because we the people simply wanted to live free. Please, my Christian sister,  my Muslim brother,  my latino mother and my African American father, please let us remember who we are,  because at the end of the day,  what worked when we  first settled this land, and it will work again,  when this country is at the brink of being torn apart.  We the people are not the president,  we are not the rich,  we are not the elite.  We are simply THE PEOPLE. PLEASE LET'S REMEMBER WHO WE ARE!!!"

worldpolitics,fclnj8p,t1_fclmviy,1577751973.0,Not at all. Especially when none of those were my words. And it's incredibly telling how mone of his followers can defend him... just attack those who tell the truth regarding him.
politics,fclfl1e,t1_fcl6pua,1577746644.0,"Is it just me, or has the GOP changed in the last 20 years or so from being just solidly conservative to being just downright obstinate and in denial on things like climate change,  homosexuality,  religious freedoms ect.  It seems like now they're determined to remake America in their image, and that  Is a very VERY SCARY image.  Like ""a handmaid's tale"" scary! I agree with you on the not making a lifetime pledge,  but I just see more acknowledgement of a need for change with our planet and our society."
worldpolitics,fckt830,t1_fckgxeg,1577732677.0,"My lines? Oh no honey,  those are straight from the mouth of the stable genius which you guys seem to love. You can also look up where at his rally he spoke about the ""sock rocket"" which was supposed to be the ""stock market"" or where he was attempting to talk about peace in the middle east and couldn't even finish the statement ""and goth bleth the unithed shtates of amererer"".  Also couldn't say the word ""origins"" to save his life. lmao kept saying""oringes"" I don't have to make up lines to show how ridiculous he is.  He does a good job of that all on his own!"
