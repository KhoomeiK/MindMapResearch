And it's not as if the Spanish were alone, they had thousands of Tlaxcala warriors that hated the Aztec, without them Cortes could never have won.

I'm not trying to defend the Spanish, but history is very rarely black and white. The true victims are the innocent people that just want to mind their own business, but this is true of the entire world. The native people of the Americas were just as warlike as Europeans (or at least some of them, yes there were peoples that lived in harmony because they had no need for war), and it's not like they were completely defenceless. Unfortunately for them, Europeans were more advanced in terms of warfare (more guns, more steel, more people). 

What happened to the native populations was indeed a tragedy of humanity, but it's a tragedy that has happened all around the globe ever since man has fought itself."
