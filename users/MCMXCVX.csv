I can imagine Trump Blaming his Loss on his Bone Spurs. We’d all pay like $10 to watch the Match and that would go toward helping the budget or helping the poor or people in need or cancel student loans...or maybe the Medicare for All. Just imagine All US Citizens and like a Billion Foreigners paying like $10 to watch the Match. Would make a nice Budget for whatever the Winner proposes like Medicare for all or canceling student loans...

AskReddit,ffc4bby,t3_esi1iu,1579791197.0,"I’m kinda interested in Asking this Question to my Friend at Bose since they Announced Last Week that they’re Closing All US Stores. 


A lot of Department Stores Closed in the DC/Maryland/Virginia (DMV) Areas. Even big designer stores. It’s just not sustainable anymore when people can just buy stuff online and some people would just go to the stores just to see what something looks like in person so they can buy it online later or decide not to. A lot of stores can’t keep up with paying Rent, and paying for the property and all the taxes that come with it. 

My Local Walmart Superstore got Rid of all Cashiers Last Year and turned all lanes into Self-Checkout, so now there are about 50 Self Checkout Lanes/Cashiers and Two Employees that help people that have any issues with the items that they’re trying to Scan. Most of their Employees were from Third World Countries and could barely speak English and I always struggled asking for something or about something. One time I spent Five minutes asking where I can find Cat Food and the Employee had trouble understand what Cat Food even meant so I might have Meowed or Showed him a Picture of my Cat with a little bit of Charades. Thank God no one saw me. 

Malls are soon gonna be obsolete. There are already a lot of Abandoned Malls in many states around the US. They’re like Ghost Malls. Even Holidays like Black Friday, don’t have the Kind of Deals and Discounts like they did 10 years ago. And Less people are starting to line up and camp around Stores. 

I suspect that Best Buy would be Closing Sometime within the Next 5-10 Years. They live off of TVs, but Amazon and other places are Already eating up their business. Someone remind me in 10 years and let’s see if I’m right."

news,fdz31ux,t3_enc0tc,1578786173.0,"They should treat this at least as Filing a False Police Report. Law Enforcement Laws should work both ways on the Police and on regular people/civilians. Its only fair that way. They should figure out a way to charge the police with something like Filing a False Police Report, even though he technically did not, but that has a Prison Punishment of Two Years up to Seven Years and Even 20 if its Terrorism related (one could argue that the cop Terrorized the Victim, which lead him to Commit Suicide). I know some Lawyers that could have a Field day with this. Can’t Charge the Cop with Killing the Victim, because it wasn’t possible for him to know that the victim’s conscience would eat him up and that the Ruse would back fire. Its Only Fair, if the Officer is held accountable for his actions rather than just a Slap on the Wrist and Suspension without pay. The Police did not Follow Protocol and uphold his Duty as a Law Enforcement Officer, when he himself broke a Law or failed to uphold one. Good Cop Bad Cop only works in movies and that cop shouldn’t have tried doing that because the consequences of a lie could be devastating. You don’t know what people are going through or feeling and some people have mental health issues like Depression or Anxiety, which could lead them to doing what the Guy in the Article did, but some even Breakdown and start killing people instead because they already took a life. Taking a life is one of the most devastating things ever if you have a conscience. It could eat you up from inside and it could break you and lead you to going insane. Anyway Don’t lie to people about serious life changing events and Never assume people’s Mental Health and possible consequences. Out of all people, a Cop Should NEVER Assume anything, because if a Cop assumes something, you will end up dead somehow such as if a Cop assumes that you had a weapon or was reaching for one when in fact you were just doing what you were instructed. If a cop assumes that you broke into your house, you will most likely end up dead especially if you were of Color. Cops should be treated fairly and tried the same as any other person. Why are Cops above the Law when they’re just supposed to uphold and Enforce the Law? Some cops are worse than Serial Killers and have no remorse too. We pay them out of our Hard Earned Tax money only to end up Catching people going 6 miles over or pulling over Colored people because they assume that they have a tiny quantity of Weed. Either that or Shooting too many people unnecessarily when a Tazer should’ve have worked better in most scenarios. Why do they always Shoot to kill instead of Shoot to disarm or injure the suspect. What is the Point of Even having Cops at this Point if we worry about Cops more than Criminals and Drug Dealers?"
