I'm already doing 50+ in a 45 but I can tell the car coming-up behind me is on a mission. Its immed on my tail, hi-beams, etc. I pull over. Then...sigh (embarrassed to say I chase. Blood is boiling. I'm gonna get that tag # On my motorcycle I don't behave like this. He gets through the light & I see him pull right into where I work.. Gone by the time I park. Prob for the best.
