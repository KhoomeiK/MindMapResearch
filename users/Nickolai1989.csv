If you think it is important to stay up to date with modern trends, stay up to date with modern trends. If you're afraid of not staying up to date with them, that's time and energy you could be using to stay up to date.

In my first job I was at a company that had a lot of both old and modern tech. I ended up on a team whose codebase was mostly FORTRAN77 (this is 2012 timeframe). I focused on learning the stack, learning the product, and doing my best to improve it, and I learned a lot in the process."
ExperiencedDevs,fewcxz9,t3_eqgd3o,1579408560.0,"When I come in first thing I try to do is build whatever main project they have. The build process will be a daily thing so the faster I can get set up with it, the better.

After that I like to try to find some sort of low priority thing that's a nice-to-have and let's me explore the codebase and implement it, like upgrading from python 2 to 3 to take an example (although these days that's a more urgent thing). Some project where the final impact on the product is likely to be small, but the impact on the dev workflow would be nice. People usually appreciate that, and it helps you get the lay of the land.

From there it starts to depend on project specifics and what they want/need me to do.

One other thing, I try to ask a million questions when I first start. Whenever somebody says anything I don't understand in the slightest, I interrupt them and say ""what's that?"". Like, somebody will say something in a meeting like ""so I uploaded the logs to cortana"" and I'll be like ""what's cortana?"". The thing is, after 3 months, you can't do that anymore."

I understand with dilution that they do nothing, but that kind of makes sense because like you say it's inevitable, and it also hits everyone equally, but untimely approval of an equity grant does not hit everyone equally and is not inevitable.

Sorry you had a bad experience at a startup. On the whole things are pretty positive here, and my salary is higher than it's ever been - enough to cover the case of equity going to 0 (not without some loss of opportunity cost, but that's just the deal you gotta take when you go to a startup)."

The need for a tool to automate builds is clear.

It used to be just assembly, but then we got C, and gcc, and gdb. 

I think cmake itself is not a great choice, because it's a new language and needs new tools. I prefer SCons because it's in Python so you can just learn Python and use pdb. 

But unfortunately cmake is the dominant C/C++ build system, and I have to use it at work (it's too deeply engrained with the project to replace it with something else), so I've taken a 'if you can't beat em, join em' approach. If we can make better tools for CMake, maybe we can centralize around it and consolidate efforts, instead of having the current situation where we have all sorts of tools that try to be better than CMake in some way."
