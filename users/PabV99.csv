What did you buy when you bought Shadowkeep? Did you buy a DLC? Cause this certainly isn't looking like it. Content that goes away after 3 months, a huge in game store despite releasing paid content every 3 months, I might be retarded, but that looks more like a subscription more than a DLC. 

Don't know about you, but I think nearly nobody paid for Shadowkeep + 3 season passes thinking we'd have to be grinding our asses off for content we already paid for (the 100 ranks you have to get within 3 months) and be on the edge because we'll have to grind for it unless we want to lose all those items.

The problem with nicotine is that it's readily available nearly everywhere, so you're much more likely to get your second, third and subsequent ""shots"" and THEN get addicted to it.

Hell, there's even a channel on YouTube called DrugsLab, which is paid for by the Netherlands' government (and sadly stopped uploading content a couple of weeks ago after 3 years), where three people try out every week some drug to explain people what they do and what precautions you should have when taking them. None of them got hooked up by any of the drugs for taking them once.

TL;DR: The problem is in the availability of tobacco, not on it's ability to create an addiction."

If I pay $60 in advance of the content, I should be able to play that content whenever I want to, not whenever Bungie wants to give me some good ol' FOMO. It's not even working because it makes me avoid playing the game even more, I didn't even play the Garden of Salvation raid once, a first for this entire saga (even having the ""no-raid DLC"" in House of Wolves was more enjoyable because there was some real campaign). 

I recently got RDR2 on PC, got a Switch... Why would I want to play this game that only asks me to grind till boredom for nothing (or even worse, for things that I HAVE to get within an amount of time)? If someone understands the purpose of holding on to (more like trying to, because it's not working) players so much, I sincerely ask you to explain it to me, cause I'm not getting it? Is it because they have more chances of getting revenue from Eververse? If it is, I'd say that's an extremely scummy tactic. I don't like paying Bungie money for them t ""force"" me to play snd maybe even buy some stupid macrotransactions.
I highly, *HIGHLY* doubt I'll buy the next yearly expansion or whatever BS we get next year, because now I know what it can become. It really boggles me that a company that last year made Forsaken and the greatly valued Annual Pass, made this ""DLC"" on the next year.
