JUSTNOMIL,ffdabao,t3_erxwnl,1579816543.0,"I just read your update and then came here to read the original and I wanted to point this out. You say a couple paragraphs in:
   ""She doesn't hold it over people, but she will not let it go.""
Then while giving us examples of this behavior you say
   ""Held over everyone's head like I was a freaking winning lottery ticket.""

I think that deep down you see these behaviors for what they are, you know this stuff is way worse than it seems. But on the surface and consciously you've been taught, and so believe, that they aren't thaaaaaat bad. Don't second guess yourself. You made the first step toward really separating yourself from the JN behavior. She's going to push back soon, try to re-establish the boundaries SHE wants, and you're gonna start to see the surface crack a bit as you start seeing more and more red flags you didn't see before. Trust yourself when this happens. You've got this. We're all here to help."

My father wasn't in the picture (his choice, but he would call and promise to visit, so those are fun things to unpack as an adult) and my mom remarried when I was a teen. By then I was a ""bad kid"" and being mildly abused regularly by my mom. Once he joined the picture it got 10x worse and he wanted to be my authoritarian and I had never had a dad before, so this wasn't working for me. It always ended badly for me, no matter how I acted, because I was a ""bad kid."" I have a hard time, now, with dads. I can handle my boss being a man and telling me what to do but I can't handle a dad of my partner/friend telling me what to do in any authoritative capacity. I can't. It makes me rage inside. I hide it, but it's there. It's a me problem, I'm trying to fix it, I work around my feelings, and I TCB but I always have that moment of ""awwww hell nawww."""

Now I'M the mom and I WILL protect my kids from any and all abuse. 

I had a lot of dates not like that I wasn't close to my family. That's fine. They don't have to like it, they just have to accept it and respect it. My ex has a wonderful family but he believed and accepted me when I didn't. My husband has a shit family, too.

We did have someone break into our yard and while I threw on clothes and ran downstairs to let the dogs out he was talking in his sleep. I come back into the house and he's still naked carrying a shot gun. In his half asleep state he decided no one is going to attack a naked man with a gun. (gun wasn't loaded, ammo is kept in a separate lock box with a separate key). So that's what I have done in that situation, and that's what my husband has done. 2 answers for the price of one!"

Our yard had a playhouse, backyard swing set with a slide, picnic table, it was set up for a family with kids to enjoy. It was the best yard in town. It took a couple weeks to get the fence repaired but in that time the neighbor kid had a birthday party (that we were not invited to) and we came home to them using the now ""joint"" backyard to have this party. Kids all over breaking our toys, running through our garden and destroying it, leaving cake plates everywhere. It was a disaster and the parents never helped clean nor said a word to my parents. 

Keep the fence."

JUSTNOMIL,fe3gx43,t1_fe3c1f7,1578849140.0,"She. Asked. For. Her. Baby. Back. Full stop.
OP is the mother and she asked for her baby back.  MIL should have handed him over ASAP. And have you ever dealt with an overtired baby?! I'm assuming yes, being a gma yourself. So you should know that an overtired baby is so difficult to calm and soothe. If MIL has the baby for 10 min then that's 10 min of baby working himself into a frenzy. And furthermore, MIL isn't the one who is going to clean up this mess she's making worse. MIL isn't going to be the one trying to calm and nurse a baby who is crying and screaming and arching his back. She won't be in the restaurant or car with him, cramped, uncomfortable, trying to calm him down. Every moment that passes is a moment it gets worse. Tired babies need sleep and only assholes keep them up for their own amusement. 

 If he's anything like my baby was, this could take hours. She would be so hungry from freaking out but would not latch. We would sit in a dim room with the sound machine on and I'd try not to cry as my baby was inconsolable. I let it happen twice and then never again. I don't care who wants to hold my baby, if that's the result and they don't care then they're not someone who should be trusted with my baby because they obviously don't care much about her if they're willing to put her through that for a few minutes of snuggles."

 My ex is a big car guy; buys, sells, builds. We used to build together and then there would be a photo shoot with some hot, tiny, scantily clad chick and it never bothered me. I don't have the body for that (broad shoulders, wide hips, and what my friend refers to as ""farm girl legs,"" thick and sturdy am I). And I never cared. Shoot day was fun! 

But then when I was about 7.5-8 months pregnant one of his older cars got it's 15 minutes and this GORGEOUS, tiny, curvy in all the right ways gal comes over for the shoot and my pregnant brain couldn't handle it. I was fat, ugly, I waddled and randomly peed myself and sometimes couldn't get off the couch without help and here she is, climbing on top of the hood of our car, being all sleek and sexy in her tiny shorts and jacket without a shirt under and I.  Couldn't. Handle. It. 

I sat in the house and cried and cried and hid from the crew so they wouldn't see because I KNEW I was being irrational but I couldn't help it. I KNEW he was super into her and not me (no, he wasn't, not even near his type, he needs a girl who could help pull an engine and looks good with grease on her face, that's me) and CLEARLY he was gonna leave me for her, or the photog, or the models friend because there were sooooo beautiful and I was sooooo hideous. At the end of the day I felt really silly but still felt hurt, like when you wake up from a dream that your SO cheated but IRL you know they haven't but you still feel that slight ache.

I also called him at work and yelled at him for drinking the rest of the OJ, even saying through my heaving sobs that I knew I was being irrational but I couldn't stop feeling like the end of the world over this. Pregnancy hormones are real."
