AmItheAsshole,ff4imgc,t1_ff3zmgh,1579564507.0,"NTA - cancel everything,  get your money back, and grieve.  Your family are major AHs for even asking you to do this."
funny,ff3qz1b,t3_eret17,1579546957.0,I cannot stop watching and laughing. My 11 month old is looking at me like I‚Äôm crazy üòù
entitledparents,ff222tz,t3_eqzqxc,1579491708.0,This sounds a lot like another story I read on here a few months ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff14sl9,t3_er0kt3,1579475175.0,This is so sad. How can parents really not support their kids in what they want to do. It‚Äôs not like what he wanted to do was something that‚Äôs dangerous and would hurt him.
AmItheAsshole,fez1nt8,t3_eqp8bc,1579453089.0,"YTA - at a job you are required to wear the uniform. If you don‚Äôt like the uniform, then quit."
AmItheAsshole,feywr8a,t3_eqnyem,1579451493.0,NTA at all. She‚Äôs an adult. She can save up the money for her own wedding like every other person I know.
AmItheAsshole,fevma8t,t3_eqlbl1,1579399033.0,"Omg you are NTA at all!!  Your husband is a major AH tho. Reading this made me SO angry!  He should always have your back, but *especially* at such a stressful and vulnerable time."
AmItheAsshole,fevl1e6,t3_eqflib,1579398681.0,NTA. It‚Äôs not your responsibility to pay for someone else‚Äôs medical bills.
AskAnAmerican,fetc2vf,t3_eq9v93,1579373764.0,Can confirm PA hates Jersey
insaneparents,fet5e42,t3_eqftnx,1579371970.0,I was forced to go to church while I was in catholic school. Now I‚Äôm atheist and raising my kids without religion.  Would never do that to my kids.
science,fepfqid,t3_eq5nw1,1579319369.0,Finally a concrete study to show all the dumbasses on my pregnancy app that smoking weed isn‚Äôt safe during pregnancy.
AskReddit,fep3i1g,t3_eq1wzh,1579311308.0,Lots of money. I‚Äôm tired of being in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.  I want my own house in the suburbs.  My city is getting more dangerous and it‚Äôs stressful.
MakeupAddiction,fep35yk,t3_eq6rp8,1579311092.0,This is a super cute setup!!  You did good!
AmItheAsshole,fen85q2,t3_eptwhh,1579279073.0,"Seriously?!  YTA.  Do that family a favor and leave your boyfriend. If you can‚Äôt stand or don‚Äôt want kids, you don‚Äôt date someone who has kids."
AmItheAsshole,fedw1o5,t1_fecc3pj,1579021093.0,"If she‚Äôs ‚Äòalmost‚Äô 3 months, she may very well have gotten pregnant right before the accident & her hcg wasn‚Äôt high enough for a positive.

I was in the ER once and they tested me for pregnancy to see if they needed to give me certain medication.  It came back negative, but I got a positive test like a week later."
AmItheAsshole,fedvhxt,t3_eoeslw,1579020767.0,"YTA - She went through a traumatic experience where she lost her husband & now you‚Äôre asking her to go through with a pregnancy, while she‚Äôs still grieving, that she feels she can‚Äôt handle?  Are you fucking serious?  Do you really think she wants to go through the trauma of growing and birthing her dead husband‚Äôs child only to hand it off? You should have never asked. It‚Äôs not your business to suggest that."
AmItheAsshole,fe90r2p,t3_enuzuk,1578932923.0,NTA - she deserves not a damn thing.
AmItheAsshole,fdw3qmd,t1_fdrd79g,1578754766.0,Exactly. I‚Äôve been cpr certified through my job for 12 years now. It is only good for 2 years. What I first learned 12 years ago is different from what I learned when I was last certified in 2018.

spaceporn,fdsejh3,t3_empid0,1578700885.0,I was quickly scrolling and thought this was an infected wound at first. Can you tell I work in healthcare?
AmItheAsshole,fdse3fm,t3_emr755,1578700574.0,"YTA because you acted like a child.  Your ex understandably questioned paternity because *two* forms of birth control failed, which is kinda rare.  You‚Äôre allowed to feel hurt by this, I would feel that way as well, but the answer isn‚Äôt to tell him that he doesn‚Äôt get a say and to ghost him."
insaneparents,fdsd5xa,t3_ems1r8,1578699930.0,That‚Äôs fucking disgusting and totally unsanitary!
AskAnAmerican,fdqnz6f,t1_fdpsz1g,1578671124.0,Omg definitely a typo!
AskAnAmerican,fdpp3pl,t3_em1boz,1578635258.0,"I‚Äôd prefer no more than 30 minutes, but would do up to 45-60 minutes of it was an amazing opportunity that paid very well."

AskAnAmerican,fdpo5da,t3_emg3ov,1578634340.0,"I grew up in the suburbs of a major city and currently live in said major city. I love living in the city, but since I‚Äôve started my family, I long for a bigger house with an actual yard.  Row home living isn‚Äôt the greatest with kids."
AskAnAmerican,fdpo1gp,t3_emh2s5,1578634239.0,I live paycheck to paycheck. I usually have $100-$200 left by the time next pay day comes around.
aww,fdpn5xu,t1_fdp1o0l,1578633431.0,Thanks for letting me know this sub exists.
relationship_advice,fdpgmbn,t1_fdnli90,1578628102.0,You are stunting her growth by only allowing her to socialize with siblings and family friends.

AmItheAsshole,fdh3gqf,t3_el32ez,1578414564.0,"YTA - you couldn‚Äôt listen to her simple instruction of something from the fridge/freezer & just took something from somewhere else. And then how you reacted to her being upset makes you an even bigger AH. To *you* it‚Äôs just lasagna. To *her* it was the last meal she had from her dead grandmother, who she clearly had a close relationship with. You better start your groveling now..."
AmItheAsshole,fdfljn3,t3_ekvuna,1578364504.0,"INFO - What is your relationship with him like now?  Do you see or speak him at all?  If so, how often do you either see or speak to him?"
offmychest,fddwde0,t3_eki8ru,1578325599.0,Congrats my friend!
AmItheAsshole,fdduxco,t1_fdd7mcx,1578324593.0,Depends on insurance. I paid $30 for a twin pack for my husband.
AmItheAsshole,fdduqge,t1_fddagdk,1578324457.0,It depends on your insurance and the area you live in. I‚Äôve heard of people paying hundreds for them. I got my husband‚Äôs epipens (comes in a 2 pack) from Walgreens and they were $30 with insurance.
AmItheAsshole,fdcmxis,t3_ekgn97,1578278895.0,NTA - I‚Äôve been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and at times it‚Äôs been pretty damn bad. I would never leave someone like that. I mean the least she could have done is sent you a text from the bathroom if she was having a panic attack or something and had to leave.
AmItheAsshole,fdcmire,t3_ekctsn,1578278604.0,YTA - you cut a teenager who was dealing with a mental illness out of your life. Do you know how shitty that sounds?  She was likely still trying to navigate and accept her diagnosis.  I‚Äôm surprised she even wants you there.
AmItheAsshole,fdc3v0y,t3_ek45lg,1578266583.0,NTA - Sign away your rights ASAP if you haven‚Äôt already & cut off contact with him.
AmItheAsshole,fdc2pn4,t3_ek8tg4,1578265924.0,"NTA - They totally overstepped their boundaries.  It‚Äôs up to you and your husband if y‚Äôall want to bless or baptize your child.  They are the grandparents, not the parents."
AmItheAsshole,fdc0yrb,t3_ekb6tr,1578264990.0,"NTA - I mean you‚Äôre not wrong!!  I do a similar thing with my residents. They want to refuse medication as a threat and I simply tell them, hey you‚Äôre only hurting yourself.  I don‚Äôt get in trouble if you don‚Äôt take it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
AmItheAsshole,fd5y48s,t3_ejwzzu,1578182965.0,"YTA - scrambled eggs literally takes less than 5 minutes to make and you *really* couldn‚Äôt be bothered to make it?  I get not wanting to make something new at the last minute, but this was literally scrambled eggs.  No wonder they didn‚Äôt come."
AmItheAsshole,fd5wol5,t3_ejxs47,1578182445.0,"NTA - that *is* disgusting. Yea whatever office gossiping isn‚Äôt the best, but that‚Äôs a health hazard.  If I was your coworker, I‚Äôd appreciate the information."
AmItheAsshole,fd48525,t1_fcz1qyk,1578165262.0,"It‚Äôs good you‚Äôre going to change it, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already ruined the relationship with your BIL & SIL."
AmItheAsshole,fcznmul,t3_eji1h3,1578105175.0,"YTA - the fact that you‚Äôre a PA isn‚Äôt even relevant here because you are not *HER* doctor.  As someone in the medical field, you should know better.  You do not know her medical history, what her bloodwork looks like, not what any of her infertility tests say.  She doesn‚Äôt need you to give her any kind of medical facts, she needs a friend.  Be one."
AmItheAsshole,fcxkr40,t1_fcwq886,1578065320.0,Thank you so much for this. My daughter was born this past February and I have another one on the way that will be too young for the flu shot next season. I am terrified one of them will get it. The flu can be deadly in babies & toddlers.
AmItheAsshole,fcwmzpo,t3_ej4jca,1578030252.0,"YTA - i see your update that you are getting the shot, but you are not protected immediately. It takes 2 weeks to build immunity."
AmItheAsshole,fcvialq,t3_ej0j5b,1578002676.0,"NAH - you both have the right to express how you want to go about marriage and raising kids.  It sounds like this is a dealbreaker for both of you, so you might want to reflect on if you want to continue the relationship."
AmItheAsshole,fcvhzuf,t3_eiy1rf,1578002492.0,NTA - Highly unlikely they will last.
AmItheAsshole,fcvfe59,t3_eizz56,1578000943.0,"YTA - you‚Äôre the one changing the plans. It‚Äôs your wedding.  Grow a pair and stand up to your in-laws.  Also it‚Äôs really shitty you are talking bad about a child with a mental illness, something he can‚Äôt help.  Like honestly, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
aww,fcn8xwe,t3_ei0l80,1577806316.0,OMG this is precious
AmItheAsshole,fciypkr,t1_fcikwmo,1577673016.0,Who the hell cares.
ChoosingBeggars,fciy06w,t3_ehcyiz,1577672526.0,"I‚Äôll never understand people who do this. Put out the money for a good artist. Their time is worth it, as is their work.  If you get a cheap artist, you‚Äôll have a shitty looking tattoo.  If you can‚Äôt afford it, you don‚Äôt need it."
MurderedByWords,fcaxh7f,t3_egwoc3,1577578551.0,"As someone who went to catholic school and is now atheist, I laughed way to hard at this. This is exactly what this sub is for."
AmItheAsshole,fc30gsi,t3_efo54d,1577378640.0,Holy shit YTA.  Why do you think it‚Äôs okay to exclude a child (your *daughter* no less) from a family photo?!
AmItheAsshole,fbvx0i1,t1_fbvcag8,1577137312.0,This research is absolutely NOT suggesting that kids don‚Äôt go to bed at a decent hour.  You are misconstruing research to fit your narrative.
