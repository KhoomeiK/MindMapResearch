Paladins,ff73kdg,t3_eru03g,1579640420.0,"I really liked that you worked as a team with different classes that complemented each other and we're all unique. It was also very easy to learn yet it had the potential to get very complicated. I struggled to find a groove at first and just sort of got lucky back when champions used to be severely unbalanced in the beta. Over time, I got more and more dedicated and became interested in the different interactions you could have with characters like using illuminate against a Skye or resilience against Ash so you don't get knocked back as far. I learned about AoE and CC and eventually I could point out what champions were using and how to counter them. I started to make loadouts for characters and got WAY better overall. At that point I was really hooked. I wanted to test out all of the different combinations of cards and abilities against people, and soon got into ranked matches. I learned about metas and different strategies until it became second nature. No other game gave me the satisfaction of being able to learn everything easily and becoming a veteran with years under my belt. Barik became my main and I finally found the play styles that suit me. I've also had the pleasure of relating to others in the community and being able to say that I'm actually a good player. üòÇ And I don't regret spending all that time on the game either. I'm loving the memes, the debates, the new characters, and constant changes (except the VGS one lul). I even got deep into the lore and I love the stories behind each champion and the realm's history entirely."

Paladins,fdmcmi3,t1_fdmcdd8,1578545649.0,Also removing so many voice lines makes the characters feel lifeless now. It's all strict and tactical. No personality.
Paladins,fdmcdd8,t3_elv2vg,1578545438.0,True. It's even worse on console. I have to raptor claw my left index finger to use the d pad otherwise I'd have to stand still to use vgs. Before I could move as much as I wanted and use vgs lightning fast. Now it really is super clunky and shitty.

Paladins,fd0b7tl,t3_ejff0y,1578116354.0,I don't find CC to be a problem. I only avoid picking Raum when the other team picks a Tyra.
