todayilearned,fearhco,t1_fe854js,1578951586.0,"I had a friend who was, but he got help, I was scared for him, heck I was depressed, because of it, I got like one hour of sleep a night tops each night for a week, every time he didn‚Äôt text me back I worried, he denied being suicidal for a while, and then I found out he was cutting himself. I couldn‚Äôt take it, it made me feel sick, he was and still is such a wonderful person, he couldn‚Äôt see it, and I would send him everything I could find from people who had survived to make him feel better. He already new I thought it was selfish, he agreed. The bloody mental effect is terrible for the depressed person, but it can effect others as well, and what it comes down to is irrationality, unless you have a decent reason (not very often there is) you‚Äôre causing more harm, my friend thought he was a burden on everybody, I spent days telling him how everyone he met loved him, he‚Äôs better now. You can see though how this false narrative in his head was causing him to shut people out and cause his close friends pain and me pain, so while yes the mental condition causes terrible strain, it can be for no reason that‚Äôs just the nature of it, I know I would 100% have become suicidal if he had done it, what good would that have done, killing yourself because you‚Äôre a burden it would have caused more pain than you could ever do if you tried."
