todayilearned,femhk7i,t1_felp3y2,1579255902.0,"Yes. There is precedent for taking into account medical considerations. But only if the defence can prove that it is imminent. And there is nothing in the article that says he bribed his way out. This would mean that the the judge benefitted in some way for giving him a light sentence. You might find it hard to believe but bribery in Singapore gets you extremely harsh punishments to the point that people don't even attempt to do it. Come on, if you're coming from the West where the legal system benefits the rich, I can understand your distrust in the legal system. But as a Singaporean, corruption is not a problem I find myself dealing with on a daily basis.

There are a whole host of problems with the political and legal systems. Nepotism, inequality being the main ones most would highlight. But corruption and bribery would not be one. If it were so rampant, these people wouldn't have been caught or sentenced (though ridiculously light). If a similar situation were to happen in another country, you wouldn't even be prosecuted. You might be distrustful of what I say but that's your opinion. All I'm doing is letting you know how it is from our perspective. Whether you'd take it is a different issue altogether."
todayilearned,felykb6,t1_fely7v6,1579234243.0,Kinda agree that the sentence was really dumb and stupid.
todayilearned,felsi2c,t1_felpsnr,1579229840.0,"I could go on and on about how things are more nuanced and complex. But if you gonna be comparing Singapore and North Korea, then okay boomer."
todayilearned,felktcs,t1_felkl15,1579224571.0,Yes. But you'd most likely get caught and not get the transplant anyway. You might also see from the article that I linked was that he tried to buy one from someone in Indonesia and not in Singapore. There are pretty strict vetting processes in Singapore. It's easy to enforce and implement due to the small size of my city state compared to other countries in general.
todayilearned,felk8t2,t1_felidpd,1579224181.0,"You'd see that what I pointed out was a case of inequality of the rich tryna buy an organ rather than bribing their way up the transplant list which are two different things. I wouldn't be so bold to say that absolutely no corruption exists but it's not a problem where I have to walk out of my house and go, ""damn, who am I gonna have to bribe today to make my life easier.""

So while systemic inequality is a thing, corruption is not."
todayilearned,felex01,t1_fekz2ve,1579220563.0,"Yea. We call that corruption and we don't do that here. You'd probably be jailed and fined heavily if you try to bribe your way especially into organ transplants. We did have a few high profile cases where a businessman was jailed for a day and fined S$17,000 for lying about receiving a voluntary donation. Knowing reddit where people don't read, his jail sentence was short due to the number of medical conditions that he had and there were concerns that he might die in prison.

todayilearned,feleid8,t3_eppa70,1579220291.0,"Just like to say, they do inform you of your right to opt out. I received a mail from the government informing me of HOTA when I reached the age of 21 and what I can do about it should I wish to opt out."
