flightsim,ffbi62b,t1_ffbhoh4,1579766415.0,Itâ€™s x mapper tng a freeware ! However to get the orange lines and other features you will need to pay 3~4â‚¬
flightsim,ffbh9ux,t1_ffamwq7,1579765238.0,I meant joystick sensitivity settings my bad
flightsim,ffacmyz,t1_ffacjbj,1579732398.0,I wish ðŸ˜­
flightsim,ffaaqaz,t1_ffa82uv,1579731210.0,Not too bad tbh ! I know what you mean but what are your sensibility settings in the sim ?
Xplane,fej7n1l,t1_fei3hx5,1579160325.0,Thatâ€™s a good option but doesnâ€™t work :(
Xplane,fej7m3g,t1_fei40mc,1579160292.0,"Is it a different frequency ? When Iâ€™m tuning the one that is on the official chart it doesnâ€™t work, and when I look at all the frequencies at this airport (via the ATC menu) itâ€™s not showing up. I was wondering if WED could add it or editing a file"
xplane11,fedzga8,t3_eoobj0,1579023138.0,"Thereâ€™s a lia script on the org that enhances the heat wave. It might solve your problem [here ](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/54770-better-heat-effect-behind-the-engines-lua-script/)
And for the weather i found it [here ](https://images.app.goo.gl/rg6ysxQ5eHZWZKF48)"
flightsim,fecvb9z,t1_febuqjq,1578986050.0,So the problem is not xplane if everything was changed to default. You may reset your nvidia settings to default and see if itâ€™s still happening
flightsim,feapcd2,t3_eoakrl,1578951026.0,[here you go](https://youtu.be/SGjtstpYA1U)
flightsim,fe7swc5,t1_fe7sou7,1578918902.0,"Yes, so it will see that a folder is missing. If youâ€™re unsure just cut it and paste it on your desktop so that you can still have it if it does not work out. Once done check if the shader folder is in place"
flightsim,fe7sgh0,t1_fe7s9md,1578918729.0,Go to your library (on steam) then right click on xplane then properties and click on verify integrity of game files
flightsim,fe7qdl1,t1_fe7pki0,1578917937.0,"If you delete it you can run the installer so it will fix it totally. But running the installer will change everything in the xplane folder to default. So I encourage you to backup everything that you have changes, run the installer and then put back in your modifications one by one. Also are you on steam or you bought it from the xplane store"
flightsim,fe6ovyk,t3_eo04bh,1578898656.0,Did you modify any settings/folder or have a FWL script that can affect it
flightsim,fe6n9ao,t1_fe6movg,1578896795.0,"Itâ€™s a 737-8 the normal one, I just added custom engines available on the org(doesnt affect performance, just visuals)"
flightsim,fe5r29c,t1_fe4c8ae,1578873339.0,"Youâ€™re very welcome, I hope youâ€™ll love it !"
flightsim,fe5qrqo,t1_fe4t6uu,1578873168.0,"Well thereâ€™s setting called synthetic GA, but Iâ€™m not sure they did but itâ€™s on development anyway"
flightsim,fe3ngjt,t1_fe3j8a3,1578850987.0,"Well I was hesitating because of the price for more than 3 weeks and I was hopping for a sale during the xmas season. But then I decided to buy it anyway because its the best traffic plugin on the market and xplane without AI is really boring. The impact on fps is inexistent, it starts automatically so you donâ€™t need to enter your FLP (it actually improves immersion) and itâ€™s really well made (radar tool, schedule board, textures...) Iâ€™ve been using xlife for months costing me 15-20 fps but this is truly the solution. There is a real team behind it so they make really good and efficient updates. There are few minor things to fix but itâ€™s not noticeable in the cockpit. When you do some planespotting you can see that planes are too low on final but other than that itâ€™s pretty amazing"
Xplane,fdvffx2,t3_en6zyv,1578746850.0,Press the ctr button on the efis
GetMotivated,fdsvfnb,t1_fdsutes,1578708454.0,Nice one ! I was waiting for it haha
GetMotivated,fdsneri,t1_fdshrpw,1578705487.0,In Australia they do it upside down
GetMotivated,fdsio8c,t1_fdsga0o,1578703487.0,In france they do it with baguettes
flightsim,fdsaanm,t3_emys6m,1578697981.0,Stunning shot !
flightsim,fds779b,t1_fds6qr6,1578695907.0,Sounds like a personal problem
Xplane,fdrlh78,t1_fdrl3u2,1578686282.0,Enjoying the work is the most important part :) I wish you the best !
Xplane,fdrkppl,t3_emw55b,1578685834.0,Looks really promising ! Thanks for your hard work
aviation,fdrgz04,t3_emv6sh,1578684424.0,It looks like an airbus a320 with the new aer lingus livery
flightsim,fdnzdaz,t1_fdnyx3y,1578595933.0,Thank you ! Itâ€™s really good I would love to fly it manually
flightsim,fdnpw2g,t1_fdnh7uc,1578590620.0,Oh yh I forgot that ! Are they not verified ?
flightsim,fdnh5bj,t1_fdngszi,1578585699.0,"It was from simbrief, maybe a bug from Zibo.But yeah I could simplify the departure by going straight to PSP after PSP176 but I wanted to enjoy the manual turns over the city"
flightsim,fdmpoh8,t1_fdmpkue,1578559652.0,I would say xplane 11 with ortho scenery
flightsim,fdmp8lk,t3_em2jle,1578559061.0,What plugins are you using (including all the scripts in fly with lua) ? Also did you tweak the setting file ? Or any file in the xplane folder
flightsim,fdmi66w,t1_fdlynmb,1578550773.0,It only works when the weather is really bad
flightsim,fdlakz5,t1_fdl906k,1578519943.0,MFS2020 has enter the chat
flightsim,fdl5hut,t1_fdl02j6,1578517388.0,"Thanks ! It really does, I love rainy departures"
flightsim,fdl5f6v,t1_fdkyscs,1578517350.0,Yeah :( You need a good amount of precipitation then it works fine
flightsim,fdklpxw,t1_fdkjzat,1578506156.0,Take my upvote !
flightsim,fdit94p,t1_fdit4ly,1578450528.0,Yes I think that everything will be simulated:)
xplane11,fdiltzq,t1_fdilg6h,1578445781.0,Go in the tablet and make sure that yaw is selected on the hardware setting
flightsim,fdiilai,t3_elkj3p,1578443728.0,"Last time I used the save flight feature, I loaded it and my aircraft was shut down. So i think it saves the actual location and speed but not the state of the plane"
xplane11,fdig9zm,t3_elk6pp,1578442232.0,Is it happening with all the aircrafts ?
flightsim,fde340t,t1_fde1xs0,1578330108.0,Yeah do ! Flightsim is a really good community tbh. Youâ€™re welcome man have a good one :)
flightsim,fde2zor,t1_fde23xa,1578330028.0,Being cleared for takeoff is the best feeling
flightsim,fde1mv9,t1_fde1ecn,1578329149.0,"Hi ! The game is streamed so the scenery is loaded thanks to your internet connection that can allow you to spend less on the hardware. The required specs are not revealed yet but i suggest i5/i7, 16gb of ram and a nvidia video card of 4gb or amd equivalent"
flightsim,fddl0i9,t1_fddkyhq,1578316320.0,Thank you ! And yeah it is :( the only negative point of traffic global (without mentioning the price )
flightsim,fddgvz7,t1_fddguyc,1578311736.0,I know that I meant for touching the buttons.
flightsim,fdd7fac,t1_fdd6x5b,1578298159.0,I would say fsx
flightsim,fdd6rfi,t1_fdd6fi3,1578297285.0,I think it looks as realistic as real life ! Landmarks everything :)
flightsim,fdd31lg,t1_fdczrk5,1578292754.0,Thank you iâ€™ll check it out !!
interestingasfuck,fdci1pf,t1_fdcfm0k,1578275416.0,All landings are done manually ! Itâ€™s actually the best part ! You only use the auto pilot for landing when the visibility is really low
interestingasfuck,fdchx3e,t1_fdcgb8p,1578275321.0,"This is manual, auto land is mostly used with dense fog, also the auto land has a maximum wind limit"
interestingasfuck,fdchs06,t1_fdch3a1,1578275221.0,You canâ€™t judge unless youâ€™re flying it
flightsim,fdc7n1y,t1_fdc5kwi,1578268689.0,Make your dream come true !
flightsim,fdbuqyh,t1_fdaoa99,1578262270.0,I rather go to flight school with it
flightsim,fdbuhl6,t1_fdbsz73,1578262205.0,Vr would be the cheapest way to do that but itâ€™s still not the same thing
flightsim,fdbf5x2,t1_fdbejd5,1578256796.0,I just wanted to buy the MCP part so i can add it to my setup but it cost 1.2K :/
flightsim,fdbe6pw,t1_fdbdpt5,1578256541.0,Beautiful story !! Yeah flight sims at home are so close to reality and helpful
flightsim,fdb2i10,t1_fdb2a3a,1578253015.0,Lucky 100% That must be amazing !!
flightsim,fdb1s77,t1_fdazzyt,1578252733.0,Niceeeee
flightsim,fdaylxu,t1_fdaygbo,1578251845.0,Waw ! What flight did you do ?
flightsim,fdax7ek,t1_fdax2gr,1578251445.0,I would buy my own 737 bbj ;)
flightsim,fdao05i,t1_fdanbz6,1578248237.0,Thatâ€™s the question I forgot to ask ! Tbh I saw that it wasnâ€™t xp11/fsx/p3d. Maybe itâ€™s a total different thing or an older version. But flying the zibo mod in xp11 helped me a lot ! The flight models are really really close to this one too
flightsim,fdaimhz,t1_fdah8i6,1578246519.0,"Itâ€™s way different ! Actually you should try it, itâ€™s really something else. VR is not really good in xplane (for the performance) and I dont really like the controller..."
flightsim,fdabr7x,t1_fda4ws7,1578244254.0,"I did it in AFTA a flight training academy in Cork, Ireland, real students/pilots use it for training !
If you know mentour pilot, his latest video was in it"
flightsim,fdabh6n,t1_fda5ooo,1578244131.0,It really is !!
flightsim,fdabg4g,t1_fdaazo5,1578244119.0,So true ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that was shortest hour of my life
flightsim,fd9ta92,t1_fd9sieo,1578237757.0,Yes :( imagine the new mfs on it though !
flightsim,fcxjq7m,t1_fcxg5ma,1578064625.0,Yes !!!
flightsim,fcv3e2j,t1_fcuv2q2,1577993820.0,It truly is !
flightsim,fcuwogg,t1_fcus5nq,1577990046.0,Happy new year !! I wish you the best
flightsim,fcuhkbj,t1_fcuh7d3,1577981125.0,Thank you ! I hope youâ€™re doing great too ! :))
flightsim,fcuhhik,t1_fctd3ay,1577981071.0,Hahahaha i feel you
flightsim,fcuhfvs,t1_fctqdhu,1577981040.0,Itâ€™s majestic
flightsim,fcuhf95,t1_fctrdbv,1577981028.0,Hahaha
flightsim,fcuhbh1,t1_fcttb2o,1577980960.0,I think they will ! I noticed that too tbh but Itâ€™s still a work in progress so they will fix few things
flightsim,fcuh9gm,t1_fcu12q7,1577980922.0,Exactly !! Canâ€™t wait for future announcements
flightsim,fcuh8b0,t1_fcu41j5,1577980900.0,2020 is starting really well
flightsim,fcuh737,t1_fcuepiy,1577980877.0,Same !!!!
flightsim,fcuh6pt,t1_fcugw23,1577980870.0,"Me too, me too :("
flightsim,fcste39,t1_fcst3s4,1577924623.0,"Exactly !! I totally agree and thatâ€™s why they are getting close to the first place even without releasing it ! This is default and it looks perfect. 
So many addons company work on it too so if they donâ€™t have your airbus Iâ€™m pretty sure a third party will do it"
flightsim,fcsrq75,t1_fcsrkyg,1577923428.0,I was so shocked when I saw that
flightsim,fcsria9,t1_fcrxav2,1577923269.0,Yesssss
flightsim,fcsrf4w,t1_fcs8vv0,1577923207.0,Same !!! I want tech alfa 2 so bad
flightsim,fcsrdsa,t1_fcsiqxy,1577923180.0,Thatâ€™s really amazing
flightsim,fcsrbq1,t1_fcskz7w,1577923138.0,Haha they have the power to amaze everyone
flightsim,fcsr76x,t1_fcsnipb,1577923048.0,"If you take the time to read my comment properly youâ€™ll see that there is nothing negative in it. Swearing wasnâ€™t needed.  If you have something to say, use correct words and donâ€™t be so childish just to get my attention"
flightsim,fcs4jfp,t1_fcs09xt,1577911363.0,"Yeah thatâ€™s true ! But when you see the effort made by the team, the research over the years, The servers needed for the satellite imagery...etc, For me it can justify a price that is 5 times more expensive than xplane"
flightsim,fcrz4uh,t1_fcrt5gk,1577908742.0,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
flightsim,fcrwr5a,t1_fcrvlv0,1577907680.0,That would be awesome !!! How do you know ?
flightsim,fcrsfib,t1_fcrqgf2,1577906004.0,You might get away because everything is streamed so it depends of your internet connection
flightsim,fcrs6bk,t1_fcrrzfe,1577905901.0,I think itâ€™s made by asobo studios
flightsim,fcrrrto,t1_fcrqhbk,1577905742.0,I think that everything that you mentioned will be simulated
flightsim,fcrq7p9,t1_fcrq558,1577905154.0,What are your specs !?
flightsim,fcrq3qm,t1_fcrpo7k,1577905108.0,"I would say the minimum requirements for xplane would be enough. Get an i5 @3.5 
16 gigs of ram, (you wonâ€™t need a lot of storage so 500gb is enoughÂ ) and at least 4gb of vram"
flightsim,fcroipr,t1_fcroda5,1577904511.0,You made my day ! Thank you
flightsim,fcro63q,t1_fcrnh87,1577904378.0,Me too ! The price is the only factor that can make me stay on xplane
flightsim,fcro3gj,t1_fcrnvk3,1577904351.0,Is it not 15$
flightsim,fcrnkej,t1_fcrmwza,1577904152.0,Itâ€™s really amazing to see how they can tease us for a year
flightsim,fcrng4d,t1_fcrmz3m,1577904106.0,I guess the xplane team will dislike it
flightsim,fcrnc27,t1_fcrlrr9,1577904064.0,That sounds beautiful !
flightsim,fcrn0af,t1_fcrlv94,1577903940.0,Canâ€™t wait to test it !!
