Could be mistaken but I thought Southwest did that too. Basically every airline has it. If you're basic economy you have to pay extra, if you're economy they usually only charge if you want a premium seat. I know Spirit charges like 12 for the cheapest seat and around 30 for the premium leg room seats.

edit: seriously, who downvotes a post about seat flight choices? how about replying with your opinion instead?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffdhcms,t1_ffcd1vu,1579820884.0,what do you mean? the better airlines usually let you pick your seats for free unless you want the front or extra leg room. spirit or southwest charges you an additional $12 to $30 to choose any seat.
