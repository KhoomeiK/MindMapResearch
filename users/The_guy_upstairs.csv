PvZGardenWarfare,fcvg0me,t1_fcvfujf,1578001315.0,Prey to god that they will do it it the mean time before that happens (if it ever will lol) ill go with the good one instead hello gw2
PvZGardenWarfare,fcvfrtn,t1_fcvby7d,1578001170.0,I totally agree with you but i wouldnt be so mad if they would rework the whole upgrade thing so it has more variety to it so every character isnt just a character you know
selfimprovement,fcmzs60,t1_fcmcpa1,1577798985.0,"Just leaving wont do anything, if its clear that she does it on purpose then dont even bother speaking with her, if shes not then it probably isnt that shes like evil lol shes probably doing so to protect you, if you think that its like dragging you down i would suggest a few things

1) try talking to her about it (if its the second case dont even bother)

2) ask her about her past (especially if shes the only parent) so you could get a better view if she has a mental illeness (depression etc if so try to convince her to go to a doctor ASAP)

3) this is easier said than done but try to just ignore her like ignore what she thinks for you or your family or whatever

4) (especially if theres a father/grand parents/girlfriend in the town) try moving out maybe to a friend or an uncle or if you have time to spare on your own like in a rent withing like the town. 

I hope this helps either i just wouldnt suggest that you leave the entire town or state for a toxic parent, its basically leaving your life and starting a new one from the beginning is really easier said than done."
selfimprovement,fcmyh08,t3_ehu2xt,1577797645.0,"Isnt it pretty obvious lol if you arent happy with your life you wont look happy and if you pretend that you are you will just feel worse, try to figure out whats bothering you with your life as right now and after you have found the problem. think of potential solutions/fixes, it doesnt matter if it wont work or it tame multiple attempts (ex. You want a better job you should look out for a better job until you find it) you should try improving your life towards what you think is the life you want and therefore you will look happy, for me it worked and i hope it works for you aswell"
pcgaming,fclffsl,t1_fck68br,1577746550.0,Honestly its doesnt matter if you are new the 2 downsides of the game is that its pay2win and its major exploits which wildcard wont fix (thats coming from a 2++k hours ps4 player) i would suggest that you buy it from eneba.com they have it like 9 euros for pc tho i wouldnt buy it if i would play by myself
pcgaming,fcleiv8,t3_ehm1c0,1577745952.0,"Right now probably 4 games lol

1) Rust  mainly cause im a huge survival game fan and rust is no doubt the best survival game in my opinion 

2) 7 days to die  (pc version) cause i think its way under rated zombie game in general i find it super fun to play even solo 

3) art of conquest on mobile for some reason i really liked everything about that game not too grindy but not too short either and money doesnt win you the game lol

4) cuisine royale because i think its by far the best BR someone can play and very underrated in general, its mechanics are really cool and creative in my opinion tge only real downsite i see in that game is its monitization i think its pay2win and pay2lose at the same time"
selfimprovement,fcld84y,t3_ehrit2,1577745104.0,Mine is probably happiness / money / health / releationships / religion
selfimprovement,fcgh83a,t3_egzkdy,1577640000.0,"I just think im just worse / unlucky than everybody else mainly due too my home country , im feeling like i will never be rich or happy EVER and like lets say a project would take a european guy like 1 month for me it would take like triple the time in pretty much anything , my family environment is bad my father is fighting with depression and cancer , my mother is fighting with cancer too , and for the record its a matter of time before i will get diagnosed with cancer aswell ,  at this point im seriusly thinking about suiceding , im pretty shy and really dont have many friends and now its really late to start making any, i just really cant get the  inspiration to live from anywhere"
