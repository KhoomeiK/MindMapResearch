Honestly the biggest reason workers get exploited in a lot of creative industries, including being a cook, or a designer, is because even if they don't like their bosses, or the workload, or their team maybe, they love the work.  Pretty much no-one goes into those fields who isn't already fully invested in doing the job no matter what.

Which in a tragic turn of events means their general passion undercuts their ability to organize or bargain for better treatment.

Also there are a lot of spare people in the the workforce looking for those jobs.  Creative fields where this isn't true, or have a steeper cost of entry (ex: architectural design in some regions) still work way more hours, but they get paid a lot better."

I know a carcinogen is ""a chemical that can cause cancer in living tissue"" but that doesn't mean weed gives you cancer. It means some of the chemicals in weed, when isolated, can cause cancer at certain exposures.

The point though is to either smoke less weed without having to roll a super thin joint, to help keep your joint lit, and to consume nicotine.  Nicotine has its own super rushy high which I don't like, but some people like the combo."

A saying is anything someone says often even to be a saying so I won't quibble about it being ""real"", but to say it finishes that way does imply it's part of the original saying and not an edition hundreds of years later.  Jack of All Trades was both a compliment and an insult (really just depended on how you meant it) all the way back in the 16th century, but the last can't be found until much more recently. 

Technically the saying is just, Jack of All Trades.  The diminutive addition ""master of none"" was an edition to make the distain (probably from actual master guildsmen) more obvious. It gained more popularity for reasons I'm not entirely sure of, but I'm assuming educated people of the day who could read and write would have preferred real mastery over a generalist, considering it was they who supported the guild system.  That's just a guess.  The third line seems to have just been added to regain the original first lines potential positive meaning.

Ah the alt-right playbook.  The only things that count as ""facts"" are things you already agree with.  All others, like actual expert analysis of data, or even a cursory explanation of why your position is based on a fallacy can be safely ignored as ""irrelevant"" as it does not confirm your biases.

Ask yourself seriously, can you even imagine yourself being swayed from the position that the public (liberal obviously) perception of police aggression against minorities is overblown?  Or do you know so strongly that it's just a liberal delusion against innocent police, that you'd never shift your opinion?  Be honest with yourself. Because if you can see that changing... well there is a mountain of evidence you might want to take a look at that you may have, totally coincidentally, never been exposed to by conservative news media.

If not, stop arguing about things you don't want to really consider a different opinion on, because you're wasting people's time and promoting propaganda.

I mean I already know the liberal media position is exaggerated for it's own political purposes, that's about as obvious as the fact that it's also a real and legitimate problem supported by strong statistical data & expert opinion (including former and current police), that we're doing nothing about.  It's as obvious as the conservative media's apologism and demonization of civil-rights activists is a propaganda campaign sponsored by special interests to divide Americans on what should be a very simple issue, and prevent reform.

But throw the News out on both sides and you still end up with a mountain of evidence of a very real, very provable problem with well understood causes that one side is fighting very hard to see not resolved.  It's not about guns rights, respecting police, or minority rights. It's just about accountability.  Just that one thing.

food,fe7hkzq,t1_fe6pm2i,1578914574.0,"Well of course they do.  People eat ""chili"" everywhere, even over seas, and they out number the people who make it in the tradional way.  They don't want to hear someone form Texas tell them their moms ""chili"" that is essentially a tomato and bean stew isn't chili. I don't blame them, and their stew is fine.  I eat it at Wendy's, it's totally fine.  Hell you find tomato and bean chili all over Texas too, there's nothing wrong with it besides that it's actually not the same dish. 

But when you say something like ""chili is a Midwest thing"" and ""maybe cumin"" like... fucking hell have some respect for history. I don't know, fuck.

Traditional chili isn't a soup, it's not a stew, it is meat preperation, like a curry.  Actually it's really similar to curry now that I think about it.  What OP has is a stew.  They are as a like as a salad and a sandwich which is why traditionalists get defensive about it.  It's actually just not the same dish. 

The reality, the actual think-about-it-for-just-a-damn- second here truth is that it can't be the same dish and be 70% different ingredients that is also eaten differently.

One contains 0 tomatoes or beans, meanwhile OPs prep is like 70% tomatoes and beans.  Traditional chili is a bowl of beef covered in liquified chilis and onions. It's about 40% by volume just chili peppers, and 50% meat.  Chili is a way to cook beef, which is why it's called Chili Con Carne.  Beef, with chilli. Texas chili makes almost no major changes to the original Mexican (which Texas was part of at the time) recipe so it's not like there isn't a leg to stand on here with tradition.

But if you called the OP ""beef with chillis"" you would be stretching the hell out of that statement because its a tomato, bean, and beef stew seasoned with some chili pepper.

Can a dish be the same but also be 3/5 of it different ingredients by volume, and is now an entirely different kind of dish, eaten differently, but the same?  I guess. Actually, no, but if you want to say so I won't call you a liar, but really, no."

Shrimp cooks at  the boil in about 2 minutes, or more if you need to bring the temp back up.  But no more than 5.  They are then done, and only become worse the more you cook them.  They don't even slow cook well because you do not want to break down any connective tissue in a shrimp, and as shrimp cook they begin to taste a lot more like ammonia.

I think it's almost entirely cognitive dissonance when people come to these gendered sex role conclusions, and the rest is essentially hold over from the neo-victortianism of the 50's where they hammered bad ideas about sex roles into people.  Those ideas have slowly died off as that generation had kids, and then they had kids, but they still inform our general idea of the way the genders behave. Those ideas have a lot to do with selfishness of men, and the non-participation of women.  But that's not normal, historically accurate, or healthy.  It's really a pathology of an anti-sex society that was glorified by post war America, and in a lot of ways disseminated globally.

People are, by in large, people.  They are a spread of selfish and selfless, and selfish people pretty much do the bare minimum, man or woman. I can see a world where this ends up meaning the average of selfish women put out less effort than the average of selfish men due to less pressure to perform... but probably not.  Pressure is only important if you are not selfish.   And the reasons for assuming women would be selfish, out of just laziness, is so steeped in confirmation bias (that doesn't make you sexist don't worry) that you should be completely untrusting of that conclusion.  Even if sounds right.  Even if your anecdotes seem to make it right in your experience.  It's still bad evidence.

Because there are selfless women too, and selfish men find those women and take advantage of them. That's the way of selfish people.

Now do lazy women get laid more? Which is a different question.  I think Occams razor can be safely employed here.  Probably.  I think some men are also bitter about this, and see it as unfair... I don't know what to say expect grow up to that one.  Life ain't fair."

The word you are looking for is ""obligate herbivore"" or ""obligate carnivore"", they are the animals who are required to eat only vegetation or meat.  And they are actually fairly rare on average. Many cats are obligate carnivores, but most dogs aren't.

Most other carnivores eat non-meat selectively when they find it because it's free calories. Same with herbivores. Some animals only do so when they have nutritional issues.  Both must eat vegetation or meat as their primary food source, but they can supplement it, and do not require the other to survive normally.

Omnivores are the animals that survive eating either or exclusively, or both, and can live of any combination there in, like a bear, or a pig, or a person. A wolf unlike an omnivore cannot live off a vegetarian diet, but they do still eat and get nutrition from plant matter.

If you have a sealed vessel containing air, it would take time for a notable percentage of the oxygen atoms to diffuse into the liquid and react with the organic compounds, like you said.  I would expect those atoms would react almost immediately, or within minutes, when becoming dissolved into the solution however, as atoms are much more compact in a liquid and it is full of organic compounds.

Injecting CO2 displaces air, so it should displace the free O2 in the tank via a valve of some kind, right?  This might be where I'm getting it wrong.  I always assumed it was vented some to purge the air that was originally in there.

At that point I would think oxidation would stop, as there should be almost no oxygen in the air (should be mostly CO2) and free oxygen in the solution should have already reacted.  I would think.

Sounds like small biz software devs to me /s.  Don't shoot me dev's I'm joking, I've been thoroughly impressed by numerous tiny devs and their enormous brains. But it is insane the level of ""oh, yeh that's supposed to be broken"" or ""that is impossible to fix"" or ""that's a Windows issue"" I, as a all in one small biz IT consultant, have heard from small developers.  Particularly those who designed CMS' for small niche markets like hair salons or route planning, back before HTML5 and CSS blew all their UI'less, insecure, unupdated since 2004 apps out of the water for a fraction of the cost and no arduous setup.

The programs they charged $8k a year licenses for + support agreements, are often apps you can get on your phone for free now or $10/mo per seat from 8 different web apps."

Though forcing a fight can be great drama if the investment is there, and the reasons for it being unavoidable are satisfying.  Someone needs them ""out of the way"" or ambushes they did not forsee.  But if you think about shows you enjoyed you'll probably see a lot more talking than fighting."

Unfortunately it does detract from the message. We as people should be competent enough to go ""Well that's one person"", but confirmation bias is real bitch.

What's even weirder is the lack of understanding from outside their bubble promotes their radicalism, in another odd form of confirmation bias, be it fat acceptance or any other political ideology.  It's one reason why it's rational to distance yourself from these people, overtly, because if you don't the outside ideology will conform you regardless of how dumb their ideas are.  What's worse is they probably will even if you distance yourself.  But we feel so strapped for political allies that we (meaning all people, or more accurately \*enough\* people in whatever group) support insane people because the message is... sort of right... ish?  Better than nothing anyway."

Even without social behavior you can see why an animal would seek out things that make them feel good, protected, and well fed.  They may not have the same level of affection, but the appreciation is probably there."

And it integrates with on-prem windows systems.  Still supports powershell, same features and functions.  It's quite a bit easier to admin on top of that."
