bipolar,fdhe085,t1_fdhdcj3,1578420675.0,"Thanks! and yeah it‚Äôs one of my new year‚Äôs resolutions that when i‚Äôm feeling low, i have to to do just anything at all, even if its just doodling a little picture, painting or cooking some meal."
bipolar,fddojnd,t1_fddl88u,1578319627.0,"I've experienced this so many times, just if i say anything relating food / body / weight, it's always ""oH yOu onLy ThiNk tHiS bEcAUsE oF yOuR eAtiNg diSoRdEr"", and that's the reason why i really dislike talking to anyone irl about anything relating to my mental health, cause then i just sometimes feel people forget you're human too and all they see in you is an illness."

bipolar,fcsompj,t3_eikn72,1577921210.0,Aw so cute and Happy Birthday to him! üíïüéâ
bipolar,fch2kms,t3_eh9jas,1577646703.0,"Unfortunately, yes, it is a part of the disorder, i twice didn't brush my hair for 2 or 3 months, because i had absolutely no motivation or reason to care for myself."
bipolar,fc56q8g,t1_fc4lhyd,1577446047.0,"Well, honestly at this point i don't know, i mean i have to go every week once or twice to outpatient eating disorder clinic to meet my psychologist and both she and my parents and closest people say i do have an eating disorder but i'm still in denial, and believe that my eating habits are normal."
bipolar,fc3zgdf,t3_eg2jvh,1577402626.0,"Hi, my personal favorite is Daylio, cause you can track and personalize your moods and activities, and you can also have goals and stuff like that, so yeah i recommend this one the most. There's also another good one called eMoods, where you can track kind of level of how much you're feeling manic, depressed and anxious and you can track psychotic symptoms and other."
bipolar,fc2z830,t1_fc2ypp1,1577377841.0,"I've been on it so far for only a week, and other than weight gain i only noticed i'm tired all the time, but yeah, i'll ask my psychologist for maybe something else, but i don't think she will agree since it's been only a week and thanks for the reply."
selfharm,f6w5jq2,t3_dtdvc3,1573217155.0,"Pretty sure if you tell a school counselor something and they‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre in danger (eg. self harm thoughts and suicide related), then they have to tell your parents about it, (but they won‚Äôt tell other proffessors about it, unless you want to), but I‚Äôm not sure how it works in college. If you think it will help talking to them or a good therapist, then yes, please do so when you get a chance, because it‚Äôs very important in recovery. stay strong ‚ô°"
