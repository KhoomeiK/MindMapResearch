stopdrinking,feeaps0,t3_eohyna,1579029883.0," Didnâ€™t get to sleep until seven this morning. Feeling awful, ashamed, and embarrassed for going on a bender. A few more days and these feelings will lessen, but for now they are great reminders of what I donâ€™t want my life to become. Iâ€™m not drinking today!"
stopdrinking,fecudnh,t3_eogjcq,1578984984.0,"Iâ€™m in the same boat sister! Iâ€™ve had a similar cycle of good times, and horrific events as a result to my drinking. Iâ€™m very fortunate I havenâ€™t killed my self or anyone else. I blacked out a few nights ago and drove home. My partner is extremely ashamed to be with me, probably wonâ€™t for much longer. I canâ€™t honestly promise him that I will stop for good... forever is a long time.
Iâ€™m thankful that this round of sobriety hasnâ€™t come with the insomnia and night sweats, but the overload of guilt. Iâ€™ve been drinking kava tea and try to breathe. Just remember to breathe. The goal is to not drink, make it to bed with that goal and you have been successful for the day. As you progress, your thoughts will too."
stopdrinking,fectvwh,t3_eofh46,1578984427.0,Iâ€™m in the same boat as you. Blacked out the other night in front of my SO family and acted like a fool. Then decided to drive home ðŸ¤¯I wish I had your confidence that this time will stick.

blunderyears,fe6e30n,t3_enuynj,1578888188.0,God. My aunt permed my hair in the early nineties and I looked like Kenny g. Then most of my hair broke off due to the chemicals. I had a curly mullet thing for a while. I wonder if that whole perm fad will return.

They couldnâ€™t fit in our neighbors house, so they were gifted to us. It was signed Man Ray. It is huge and beautiful, but not 100% authenticated. One lady said it was real, another person said is was not. I love it regardless."
