illnessfakersgonewild,ff7uj6k,t1_ff7ubb8,1579658690.0,I kind of the get those vibes from people with ED because they want to be frail and childlike. Not sure what’s happening here though. Maybe like that Peter Pan syndrome where adults never want to grow up and do things like kids
illnessfakersgonewild,ff7u1qa,t3_es40pq,1579658360.0,This makes me wildly uncomfortable and there’s a blatant lack of social norms that hints at mental illness almost. It’s one thing to fake a wheelchair but to act like a toddler? On the floor?

 I know a UTI can cause kidney damage is that also irreversible?"
illnessfakersgonewild,fel2sh7,t1_fekmkcc,1579212823.0,Wait wait sorry this a random question- dehydration causes kidney damage? And also I had no idea that kidney damage was irreversible why is that? I thought that over time kidneys can repair themselves like other organs.
Vindicta,fel1wvz,t1_fek9ey2,1579212277.0,Wait I have a question! How did you go about changing your name? I thought about doing it before college but now I’m here and I feel like most people know my name and it’d be weird to just ask them to use something different. How did you start going by a different name?

Vindicta,fefzubo,t3_eox38e,1579070982.0,I’d be really interested in a post about what hair styles look good with different faces. Like for some reason when I had my hair short I got way more compliments than when it was long. I wonder if my face shape is a lot different
FemaleLifeStrategy,fefv7wt,t1_feftr1b,1579066271.0,Honestly kind of what I’m worried about as well. I think as time ticks on people get scared that they will be alone and start dismissing behaviors of men and also feel like they’ve more or less have to deal with “what’s been dealt to them”
FemaleLifeStrategy,fefs0jm,t3_eovaw9,1579063482.0,"I feel like this is very hard because for some reason fds and the lifestyle is very extreme and I’ve seen a lot of people let things slide. The way that I go about it is that it’s really easy for me to make friends but I always am careful and watch how they interact with others and how they interact and talk about men. I’ve definitely dropped a lot of people but I have some very deep connections with others so it makes up for it.

I tend to find that especially in my age group which is college that a lot of women are more pickmes but the older they get the different the outcome"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fefiym7,t1_fefirt7,1579057304.0,We have really good communication honestly it’s refreshing so I feel like we do set up boundaries and since this is the first time I’m inclined to believe it’s more of a normal human fuck up

FemaleDatingStrategy,fefirfz,t1_fefgmxw,1579057183.0,He responded well and made me feel validated instead of gas lighted which most guys do which is nice! I didn’t even ask for him to but he did say I had a right to feel the way I did and that he’s sorry
FemaleDatingStrategy,fefioc7,t1_fefid4n,1579057130.0,That’s exactly my idea- except I did bring up what happened today which honestly in the grand scheme of things is pretty minor.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fef3wd1,t3_eorftc,1579047575.0,I think the only time I’d be okay with that is if his mother was ill or somehow couldn’t really take care of herself so he was stepping in to look after her. It sounds like this is not the case and it sounds like this man is 32 living at home- gross
FemaleDatingStrategy,fef3q6y,t1_feerq15,1579047459.0,Honestly most people who don’t have a personality seem to make up for it by idolizing celebrities. I’ve seen it so many times
lawofattraction,feeax92,t3_eopagi,1579030005.0,I kind of did this. I just decided I no longer liked the taste of alcohol and that it would cause me to not feel good.

No but for real have heard people say this, like Holden was an awful whiny baby character and is almost insufferable why would you want to be him?"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fec8822,t1_fec4i5x,1578968355.0,It can initially be hard because people can be kind of dependent on their friends but I realized I’d rather be alone then fill my time with people I wouldn’t want to be in real life. That’s how I kind of look at people now- are they inspiring? Do they motivate me to be better? Are they someone I would want to be in terms of personality and such?

Vindicta,fearccj,t3_eoasc9,1578951545.0,"I didn’t really notice it until someone pointed it out but men will openly stare at you, make eye contact and hold it for a while or stare at you as pass them by on the street. 

Easiest way is to walk into a crowded room and see how many people stare and how long they stare. Some people will do it on instinct but if they find you beautiful they’re more likely to stare for longer"

Vindicta,fe9sh00,t3_eo5b5b,1578941063.0,I think it’s unfair to claim the actors are really that pretty. They have a team of people picking their outfits and a team to touch up every bit of makeup. On top of that they have optimal lighting and are able to take breaks in between shooting. I’ve never seen someone in real life who looks like that even if they are the people. If you look up paparazzi photos it shows how they really look and I’m not saying they aren’t gorgeous but it is a difference

Vindicta,fe68yat,t3_enxy7b,1578884394.0,"Overall I think most lip fillers and fillers in general age a person so much. I mean look at Kylie, when she’s not highly editing her photos she looks really old. I’ve seen a few people get fillers and initially they make look good but they quickly start to look fake and make people look aged as hell. 

There are some lip plumping gloss things you could try they work pretty well!"
