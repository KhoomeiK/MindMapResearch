ireland,ff3fevp,t1_ff2z3a6,1579539949.0,Mary Lou IS NOT in the running for Taoiseach.
ireland,ff2hlm9,t1_ff2gs53,1579506480.0,That's fantastic. Thank you.
ireland,ff2gkjo,t1_ff07252,1579505218.0,Why all the down votes? All of the established parties have said they will not go into government with SF. You might not like it. But it's the truth. Zero chance of making up the next government.
todayilearned,ff2dm2j,t1_ff1kc7e,1579501847.0,Maybe in the US. But not in Europe.
todayilearned,ff2dj4o,t1_ff1iv1x,1579501761.0,Thanks. I couldn't find any of that stuff.
todayilearned,ff2dgit,t1_ff1lreo,1579501683.0,Never heard of it.

 Apparent from articles about how he squatted in AOL for two months.

Does Claco still exist?"
todayilearned,ff2dc1m,t1_ff1xh8r,1579501551.0,What is doing now? And what does his company do?
todayilearned,ff2da2e,t3_eqyy93,1579501494.0,"I cannot find any reference online to his statup Claco. Other then mentions in articles about how he squatted in AOL. 

Im not believing a word of this story."
ireland,ff1zyrc,t1_ff1wvbp,1579490156.0,Wtf?
ireland,ff1oryj,t1_ff1m94w,1579482836.0,"Ok. I'm a little bit confused. 
I genuinely had no clue what name people before profit where going under.

They have gone by a few different names the AAA - PBP, The United Left Alliance and other names. I can't keep track of it. Its nice to know you can.

I don't get where your attitude is coming from."
ireland,fezyenh,t3_er01ln,1579463242.0,Most people I would imagine.
ireland,fezxnx4,t1_few676f,1579463043.0,What is there actual name?
ireland,fezxc1x,t1_fesm6ft,1579462904.0,Down vote me all you want. But we all know it's going to be Martin or Varadkar that becomes PM.
ireland,fesm6ft,t1_fesdbq8,1579366694.0,"They are bigger parties.
And there leader is going to be PM.

It's just the reality of it. They will dictate what's going to happen.

I mean do you think Brendan Howlin or Eammon Ryan will be PM in a months time. Honestly Mary Lou probably has a better chance of being PM. While we are at it. Let's not forget Mary Lou is Ex FF.

 We all know how it will go.

FG will stay with middle right. Fiscally conservative pro bussiness  , socially liberal. Bussiness trump's liberal values.

FF will just do what ever that think will suit them best.
I can see them siding with the farmers on Carbon tax they are that desperate for votes."
ireland,fes7202,t1_fes6ou7,1579362066.0,"I don't think it's RTE keeping it that way. Realistically it's going to be the leader of FG or FF running the next government.

The other parties haven't got the numbers to do it.


The other parties need to run more candidates."
ireland,fes6pin,t1_fes56ty,1579361980.0,"I think the Greens are going to take a lot of the votes the smaller Left parties have been getting.

I also think the Labour are going to lose a lot of votes to the Soc Dems in the areas that they are running against each other."

startrek,fee25nj,t1_fee0er8,1579024832.0,"No. This was something I.noticed when the shows aired originally
The only reason I brought up High Def was to discount it before someone brought it up as a reason."
startrek,fedzcnk,t1_fedz4wa,1579023077.0,"That's what in was thinking.

They also seem to use a softer camera focus."
startrek,fedz4r7,t1_fedypgq,1579022947.0,"Thanks. I understand that. But it does not account for why the Enterprise sets look so different in DS9s pilot.

The lighting in general on the show looks more soap opera with a softer camera focus.

The runabouts are Federation tech. So the Cardi architecture and lighting dosent explain why scenes taking place in them looks so different."

Grabs popcorn"
ireland,fdid7fk,t3_elhb8j,1578440241.0,"Terry McMahon is a dick. He is one of the people who talked Gemma O Doherty into running in the last presidential election.

I think he might even of been her director of elections.

Let's also remember his since deleted pre MeToo post on Broadsheet.ie. Where he proudly boasted about groping a member of Fair City's cast groin during his first Fair City audition. 
He did it without first consulting with the actor before hand and did not apologise afterwards.

A poser and a creep. Best ignored."
ireland,fcxe9ts,t1_fcx127g,1578060623.0,"""All the answers I've heard to that question have never been answered for people over the age of 18 voting*

What? I don't understand what you are trying to say here. Would you mind being a little clearer.

Sorry off that come off rude. I appreciate that English might not be your first language.

IT just not very clear what your trying to say."
ireland,fcxdy8i,t1_fcx127g,1578060370.0,"No, I'd like to know your arguments for lowering it."
startrek,fcvc4hf,t1_fcv6bsp,1577998995.0,I thought the two included B4.

ireland,fcv320p,t1_fcu99k5,1577993620.0,"Maybe reread his post.

Why do you think we should lower the voting age?"
ireland,fcv1v1p,t3_eixb2x,1577992905.0,I believe something similar happened in Drogheda. Fisherman's rescue and the Boyne River Rescue. Some animosity between the two groups or at least there was for a while. No idea why.
ireland,fcv0mpe,t3_ej1iu3,1577992229.0,I don't know if it's just me. But I do not find these guys funny at all. Every week someone uploads a sketch and it gets tons of upvotes. And here is me struggling to figure out why.

startrek,fchd40m,t1_fcdq42y,1577649390.0,Wasn't it only after the Traveller took Picard aside and told him of Wesleys potential. That Picard made Wes an acting bridge officer as well as giving him free reign on the Enterprise. Wesley even created a new species and got away with it.
ireland,fcanvbz,t1_fc7bhge,1577572986.0,"I think he did do time in South Africa.

Edit: Sorry my mistake. Just a fine."

Little tip for you Mark Thatcher lives down the road.
I can't remember if he is still in jail or not. So he might not live their anymore.

Some bold boys offered him a lift in their plane. They told him they had to stop off in Equitorial Guinea before they could drop him home."
