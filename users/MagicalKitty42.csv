furry,ff5wrw2,t3_erso61,1579612849.0,"For physical traits, think of one of your favorite animals or even a hybrid. You can be as realistic or crazy as you want when it comes to colors and patterns, so do as you wish with that.

For personality, take inspiration from traits you like about yourself and/or others or traits you strive to achieve for yourself. Add a few quirks to add some flare to your fursona's personality. For example, say you have a green wolf who likes baking, and loves sharing his creations, yet he is very shy and has a hard time sharing since social situations aren't their strong suit. Another interesting quirk about this character is that they hate sticky things getting in their fur, so they always wear protective gear while mixing dough.

I came up with that on the fly, so it's not super detailed, but I hope it gives you a basic idea of where to start!"

DungeonsAndDragons,fedhw4g,t3_eofse5,1579011943.0,"Personally, I would say having everyone together in person is ideal. Depending on why schedules are conflicting, see if you or the other players could try and reschedule things to make it work. Taking time to have fun is very important, so remind them of that as well.

I know from experience that scheduling D&D can be very difficult. What you need to do is keep trying. You will need to be very flexible, as D&D is based around DM actions and  player responses. This also applies to scheduling. You will likely need to move some things around on your schedule (if you can) to make time for D&D.

I wish you the best, and keep trying."

furry,fd3ws62,t3_ejwyyg,1578162293.0,"I'd say you should tell him, but also mention why furries aren't bad. If he doesn't listen or decides to leave you, then he's the problem. If he truly cares about you, he will accept your differences and continue to care about you. I personally don't have experience with romance, but I can tell you that sometimes the truth hurts. Sometimes, people don't want to hear it. Regardless, do what you think is right, and don't make a big deal out of being a furry. It's a hobby and community, and there are lots of good people here who will stand beside you during hard times.

Stay strong, friend."
