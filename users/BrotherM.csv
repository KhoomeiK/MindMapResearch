freemasonry,fenqo0a,t3_eo871b,1579289400.0,"We did the opposite. We successfully moved our meal from after the meeting to before the meeting and I have no idea why we ever had it after (though almost every Lodge here does it after, and as we all know, many people are fans of cookie-cutter Lodges that all do everything the same way) in the first place!  


If it's after, most young members with jobs and families to support need to leave at the closing of Lodge, as they need to be up for work the next morning. If it's before, then they can generally get there without issue (maybe a couple minutes late) and enjoy the fellowship. Having a drink or two *before* Lodge rather than after is also much safer driving-wise (time for the alcohol to be processed) and just seems to be nicer (and there's no law against having additional drinks *afterwards).*  


If one is married, then one's wife probably doesn't \*want\* her husband to be out ""all night"".  


It is also healthier to eat before Lodge (nobody should be eating a meal at 9:30 at night), AND it makes it a whole lot easier for the Junior Warden and Stewards to prepare everything. They know *exactly when* the food must be done/cooked/ready-to-go. This is generally not possible if doing the meal afterwards as different discussions can take longer or shorter. Other benefits include that it is easier to tell prospective candidates to ""join us for our Festive Board at 18:30"" rather than ""Come by some time around nine and start waiting, maybe for an hour, we don't know"".  


I'd keep it before the Lodge meeting...but if you are *dead set* on attempting to change it, I can give you some advice:  


1. You must have the Master and Wardens on board. If a Master or JW (or whoever else is the designated food-preparer for you guys) is totally opposed...this isn't going to work.
2. DO NOT say it is a permanent change. You need to suggest a one year trial. It needs to be, ideally, a year. Long enough for people to get used to it, but not so long that it seems like forever and people won't want to change it. I would recommend you have the Master and JW introduce this ""trial"" as a part of their year in office, e.g. ""For my year, we are going to do something different: we are having the festive board before/after. If it works out, we can keep it, if it doesn't, then we will have tried something that may have bettered our Lodge and it didn't work out...my successor can change it back""....people like going with the ideas of the Master ;-). Basically, use that masonic tool known as the wedge: it is made use of by operative Masons to split mountains that they might be crafted into rough ashlars, but we as speculative Masons use it for the noble/glorious purpose of advancing our desires by inserting the thin edge of it into people's minds, then gently tapping away at it with our gavels"" ;-P.
3. Sell it.
4. Provide some good justifications for it (these are difficult to do in your situation though, as festive-boards-after seem generally to be a shitty idea unless everybody has to work at 9 or 11 the next day). 
5. If your Lodge has grumpy, aged Brethren who may oppose it, get some GL guy to agree with you that it is a good idea to try. Use the old ""appeal to authority"" tactic. Old people lapp that right up; hell, some would jump off a bridge of the GM said it was a good idea.

That being said...you aren't going to find much help in becoming rich by joining a Lodge (which indeed, costs you money that could be invested elsewhere instead, if your goal is to become rich). If you are looking to become rich, then I would recommend earning more, living below your means, and investing the difference (the ""get rich slowly"" programme mentioned by another user on here). If you are looking to learn from people who are doing well, then I recommend that you join a group that is focused on that, rather than a Masonic Lodge. Perhaps Rotary? They exist for business purposes and sport plenty of well-off members.  


As Masons, we are taught that one of our goals is to cultivate ""*dis*interested friendship"", i.e. not friendship with some sort of pecuniary interest involved.
