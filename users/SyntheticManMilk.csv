worldnews,fdercc1,t1_fdeishj,1578344997.0,"Okay let’s assume I go to the hospital with a broken hand because someone threw a brick at it while I was in a protest/riot.  I drive there and tell the doc “I tripped in my garage and broke my hand on a brick”.  I guarantee you $100 it won’t raise any red flags.

If for some bizarre/absurd reason the insurance company suspects you are lying about breaking your hand in your garage and you were involved in a riot/protest (which your insurance company doesn’t cover), what the fuck are they going to do?  

Are they going to investigate who was at the riot and mail out your picture to people who were there asking “was this man at the riot?”

Are they going to go around asking businesses around the area to take their security camera footage (which they can be denied), and spend time reviewing the footage looking for you!?

Are they going to get a warrant for your phone’s location data?

Are they going to spend company time, money, and resources investigating how you *really* broke your hand even though it would cost the company more money to find out as opposed to just paying for your damn hand?

The answer is no.  They can suspect all they want (even though they wouldn’t in the first place for this type of case), but they don’t have shit on you and your story.

The hardcore investigations you’re talking about are mostly for cases involving medical care that costs significant amounts of money.  It’s for these big money cases when the insurance companies are going to do heavy investigations to make sure customers aren’t lying or trying to game the system.

If do you get seriously hurt at a riot/protest and require the kind of medical attention that costs a ton of money, then I could see an investigation, but I still advocate lying and saying your weren’t there.  If your insurance company doesn’t cover protest, then there’s no risk to lying about your whereabouts (unless you were picked up in an ambulance).  If you tell the truth, they won’t cover you, but if you lie, there’s still a good chance they can’t prove you were there.  If they can’t prove shit, they can’t prove shit!"
