Gunners,fejze7e,t3_epkubq,1579189298.0,Makes sense to get an experienced LB opposed to playing an 18 year old out of position. Last thing we need is destroying Saka’s confidence by playing somewhere he shouldn’t be playing.
Gunners,feia6yy,t3_ep8p5l,1579133752.0,He might actually be in better condition than the rest of the squad after training with bielsa

Gunners,fehj8cg,t1_fehj1zl,1579117655.0,"A faster, better dribbling Xhaka is basically the ideal CM next to Lucas"
Gunners,fehj36w,t1_fehcgnd,1579117571.0,"Could be a bit of both. He could shift the side of emphasis from left to right when we have Tierney and Hector, but to me it solves a lot of the issues we face when starting players who have high attacking ability but aren’t the best defensively like an Ozil or Pepe."
Gunners,fehiuhg,t1_fehdcvr,1579117429.0,"I don’t know much about him but it wouldn’t make a ton of sense for us to sign him if we are keeping Lucas. Casemiro is a brilliant defensive mid but needs more creative players around him, have both Lucas and Bruno would make us solid but blunt in attack, if this description is true."

Gunners,feh8vki,t3_ep31eg,1579111562.0,"The shitty part is that people don’t understand how difficult these things can be for players. Especially an injury that causes one leg to atrophy to where it looks like you’ve never used that leg before. That muscular imbalance takes months and months to rectify on top of the mental strain it puts on you. It’s different for the average person we jus need to be able to get to work and home, but Rob. Hector, and Calum literally make a living from the strength of their legs. That imbalance can greatly upset their ability to perform."

soccer,fedjzqe,t1_fed5bv7,1579013449.0,"This is why I think people are wrong about him moving deeper into midfield as his career goes on. As brilliant as he is, his style of movement won’t work as a mid in the mordernos game. Teams will work to press messi in the midfield and as his acceleration decreases with age he’ll become a liability. You’re better off playing him as a false 9 where technique on the attack can still be utilized"

Gunners,fdvna2i,t1_fdvm7d4,1578749356.0,"I thought so as well, plus palace pushed up which means we will get a little more space on the counter so it looks like we will try draw them into overcommitting"
Gunners,fdvn3oh,t3_en7awn,1578749287.0,Also we are forgetting that this is the first time since the Bournemouth match that the opposition is really sitting deep against us. Actually even Bournemouth don’t tend to sit deep. We need to take advantage of palace pushing up
Gunners,fdvmuu8,t1_fdvlpis,1578749192.0,I think most people are pleased but not satisfied right now. We dominated the first 25 minutes and should have created more chances.
Gunners,fdvmijh,t1_fdvlpg1,1578749051.0,Unless we are up 2-0 I don’t think Guendo would be a good idea. Xhaka and Lucas aren’t getting a lot of time on the ball so they have to play it a bit safe. Papa and Luiz are getting more space so they will have to play the balls over the top
Gunners,fdvlyxr,t3_en7awn,1578748831.0,"We need to create more chances but I’m not surprised palace got back into the match. They made the game scrappy so we are gonna have to steel ourselves a bit and use their aggression against them

Also Papa needs to be willing pull trigger on the long ball"

soccer,fdtlcrk,t1_fdtkumx,1578718426.0,"That’s the nature of high possession football though, you will be at risk of counter attacks if you don’t implement a good structure and have some crafty defenders. Barca are jus getting old in the spine and playing that sort of high pressure style of football isn’t gonna happen till you have that generational turn over."
soccer,fdtjj4t,t1_fdtiy0h,1578717669.0,"That doesn’t really prove your point, Barca gave up 36 goals in the league which isn’t awful but it’s not nearly as good as 23 goals."
soccer,fdtik3f,t1_fdt70wb,1578717265.0,"Mate even with a world class keeper you can’t be terrible defensively and only concede 23 goals in a full season. They were still the best defense around, even peps defense last season was statistically better than Klopps liverpool."

Gunners,fdr640z,t1_fdr13xi,1578680011.0,"I will say his perception of arteta at Everton is a bit naive, arteta would have been the non-English speaking, foreigner who was pretty young when he played against Carra. So it makes sense he would be well behind the English speaking players who were more experienced than him  when it comes to leadership."

You have people on her saying the most ridiculous shit, like they are entering a banter era. You can see how these things can rub people the wrong way."

soccer,fdptk94,t3_emhpvz,1578639928.0,I really want Milan to keep Piatek and build their midfield and wide positions to provide some service to the guy. If I recall he was extremely clinical last season and it was inevitable a young striker would hit a down turn in form that would expose the lack of service. If they can build their attack around him I think he can get back on track and Milan can move forward.

Gunners,fdgr8wu,t1_fdgqwhv,1578406247.0,The emphasis of play must also be accounted for. If you aren’t used to doing the amount of short sprints and mental grinding that goes into a coherent pressing system then you will lack the fitness and in turn the stamina for it early on.
Gunners,fdgqrac,t1_fdgq2k6,1578405869.0,"You’re splitting hairs on this one. As the players acclimate to the pressing system their stamina will improve. We didn’t press nearly this well or as often under emery, so it’s no surprise that the players aren’t able to keep it up for a full 90."
