If they aren't motivated to send you the shipping label after you made multiple calls to potentially involved parties like Amazon and your bank, don't stress about it. If they do try to charge you or your mother for unwanted goods, file a criminal complaint against them. They know you never ordered it and it's up to them to retrieve their goods.

Also, it's a major corporation, not a mom and pop gas station. They didn't tell you to keep it for fun, and you tried to get a return shipping label anyway. Don't worry about it and if they don't want their item back then in a couple of months just accept their decision to write it off as an accidental loss. Which is what it looks like they want to do. Maybe it isn't sellable as new anymore, maybe letting it go protects someone's job, kinda impossible for you to know.

-it's highly illegal to ship unwanted things to people and then take money from them after the fact, and shipping errors are a fact of life that businesses have their own way of addressing."
