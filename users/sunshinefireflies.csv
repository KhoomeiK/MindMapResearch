I personally would accept some similar-level stuff from someone else.. and the whole 'for the right person it won't matter'. But I'd also probably leave it til the 3rd date or so to mention it if you can.. I guess the 'first impressions matter' thing too. Kinda don't want that to be the focus of the first date. But I think I'm projecting my fears too - honestly, if you click, it really shouldn't matter <3 if you can engage well, and talk about it openly without shame or fear, I'd assume you're dealing with it well :)"

GetMotivated,fcvj96j,t1_fcva7sv,1578003267.0,"Hey.. I'm sorry to hear you feel so clumsy. And so unconnected too. Do you have ANY connections? Parents? Workmates? Anyone you talk to regularly?
Tbh any starting point is a good one. Try being friendlier to your bus driver. Or your local shop assistant. (Choose people the same gender as you so it's not misinterpreted as hitting on them - that adds a massive extra layer of complexity. (If you're gay this could get confusing.. I've got no experience there sorry)).

Toastmasters is a common way people learn to engage better I think (not entirely sure if it's also for non-formal speaking, but I reckon it'd be a good place to start). Def ask for advice - if people get that you know you're awkward but you want to change I'm sure they'd mostly help..? (if you choose nice ones, lol). Just ask for help understanding one specific situation initially, (rather than take you on as a project), and see how that goes. Ask about situations external to that person, not one with them (unless you know them very well). 

DEF don't try hit on people who you're asking help from btw. (In case that needs saying). That's a really bad look - it comes across as taking advantage of someone's kindness to try get in their pants.

Very best of luck..! I'm glad you're thinking about it, and know you can make progress if you work at it :) don't compare yourself with others - comparison is the thief of joy. Ask yourself what ten-years-from-now you would want you to do :) the progress you can make in even a short time (comparatively), is huge.

Best of luck :) :)"

GetMotivated,fcv8jm9,t1_fcv47pv,1577996873.0,"Ooh, good question. .. I was kinda rambling I guess.. don't know that I meant 'wrong' exactly..  I guess I meant:

.. It hurts to acknowledge we might not be good at something. Especially when that something is about connecting with others. And often the reason we're not good at connecting is 'cause we've been hurt / not given what we needed emotionally, growing up, so we've got a sore spot that we try to protect. So to uncover that sore spot and actually try to genuinely connect with people, but not succeed at it initially' cause we're still learning, is really threatening. 'Cause connectedness is ultimately so valuable, that it's easier to decide we're not going to try, than to try and not succeed. Rejection hurts more than chosen isolation perhaps (in the short term anyway - obviously long-term it's way worse,' cause if you're actually trying to learn, you'll get better and not be isolated). 

.. I guess' get it wrong' might mean any type of social behaviour that didn't have the intended outcome / didn't come across as intended. So like, you try to be genuine, but you end up oversharing (being genuine but saying too much for the context).. or actually saying you're interested in a connection with someone (a good thing rather than avoiding), but saying it in a clumsy or too-strong way, so it comes across as forceful or clingy. 

Social behaviour is nuanced and complex, so it pays to get advice from others who are better at it (or just external to you and the situation), to help you understand and learn. Getting it wrong is part of the process - same as anything - it just feels scary 'cause a) connectedness is a big deal, and b) we feel like we should be good at it naturally, and like everyone else already us, but actually lots of us aren't. 

Does that make it any clearer? Sorry, big ramble.."
Tinder,fcv77dl,t1_fcuj5xv,1577996072.0,"What is it that you think they might like to get out of a relationship with you? Why might they date you? 

If you have good traits, like maybe you're kind, or genuine, or hardworking, maybe you could try highlight those. 

The biggest thing seems to be though that if you don't have any interests or joy it's hard to think why they would like to spend time with you..?
I feel like it might be a good idea to try work on being happy yourself, and figuring out what makes you happy, creating a life that you're happy with, before trying to attract someone else.
Much love, all the best"
GetMotivated,fcutcgp,t1_fcumi5v,1577988100.0,"Because it feels too vulnerable to get it wrong, and they're not willing / prepared to feel vulnerable. Emotional intelligence requires vulnerability - intrinsically - you need it in order to genuinely connect - and lots of people are (understandably, but not helpfully) afraid of that. Particularly people whose self-esteem is tied up in their intelligence."

newzealand,fcgz1zj,t1_fc7zdyj,1577645511.0,"Yep. This. All of this. 

I would have thought CADS would have access to psychiatrists though?

It def sounds like CADS is the first step, and try push for a Psychiatrist appt through them. If no luck, after multiple attempts, you might choose to pay privately. 

(If sexual abuse is the origin of the CPTSD ACC may cover treatment under its sensitive claims branch. Def check this out if so.) 

The approach excellently suggested above is right: be kind but firm. This will get you places more than any other approach. Also take names and document who said what at what point, as you will likely get different answers from different organisations about whose responsibility things are, which can be confusing. The truth is there are large cracks. Our system is overburdened and there are not resources available for everyone who needs them, so most agencies just focus on the one field they can handle (which they've somewhat defined for themselves over time, and may or may not line up with what they are supposed to be covering, until the point is pushed).  That's my feel for it anyway. So if you're not getting the right answer, or you're being given the runaround, it's not you: it's the system. The people in it are trying their best, but they've often reached, and passed, burnout for caring for people they can't help, so they're saving their energies for those they can. 

So yes, tautoko-ing everything said above. Take those steps and you will start to see more of the path in front of you. 

Best of luck to you both."
newzealand,fcgtc4b,t1_fcfs3wx,1577643822.0,"Yep, either that or just don't want to seem too interested in another dude's missus. The old school kiwi attitude seems to be 'men are men and women are women, and they only need to converse when needed, else they're trying to create a relationship'. So you wouldn't wanna tread on another guy's turf. Kinda thing. 

It's changed over time a bit, like dudes and chicks can chat fine now, except if one is taken and the other isn't, it's still an issue. But also I guess that attitude of 'men talk to men, women to women.. why would I talk to her / it would be weird if I talked to her / what would I say..?' 

Hard to explain, when you try put it into words. But I get what you're saying. It won't be the same in all circles."
