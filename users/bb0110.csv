> 

Wages or opportunities in your sector may not be increasing or better but I would argue that there are significantly more job opportunities than before overall. The whole reason I moved to Grand Rapids a few years ago was due to the abundance of good jobs in comparison to other areas of Michigan. That is the same for pretty much everyone I know that has moved here. Even 10 years ago that would not have been the case and I would have not moved here."

assholedesign,ff91qlg,t1_ff8jsod,1579702672.0,"I was this way. I hated Apple. Didn’t understand the allure at all. I then was gifted a MacBook Pro and I can honestly say it was the best laptop I ever owned. I used some nice windows laptops during that time as well for work but the MacBook was quite a bit better overall. I had that thing for 10 damn years before I finally decided a new one was probably warranted. It was either buy a new battery or get a new computer, so I went with a new one. In that time my work also got me an iPhone and I was 100% team android and against iPhones but after using it for a while I ended up liking it. I’m still not fully aboard apples philosophy, but I at least can understand people’s perspective about how they like them now. They are expensive and even though I like them I still don’t recommend them to people unless they have a decent amount of disposable income, because there are good alternative that are cheaper."

AskReddit,fep22rh,t1_feoy8j7,1579310400.0,"The fact that you think there is no middle ground is all I need to know of your mindset. Why do you think that it is either only the mindset of buying the complete necessities  or having completely unlimited spending?  This is the false dilemma fallacy, where one extreme or the other must be true but there is no middle ground. Is 10 million enough to get every single thing I've ever wanted? No, but it doesn't have to be. Having indulgences here and there is great to have, which you wouldn't get if you bought only needs. Going on that $15k vacation is nice to do occasionally. Going to that nice steakhouse occasionally is nice to do too. Just because you like to do some nice things occasionally doesn't mean that you now want to get anything and everything. Even if we continued on with your ""Get what you need"" mindset only and someone only spends 1/3 of that, having a 10 million cushion is still better than having 3.3 million because of the extra leeway given if something does happen that you can't predict. If you have 3.3 million you don't have very much room for error if you want the consistent 3-4% withdrawal rate that you get from that and there does happen to be some catastrophic event."
AskReddit,feovihh,t1_feouxvp,1579306310.0,"I don't understand how you are not grasping this. The question isn't ""how much could you live on if necessary"" and I don't know why you keep coming back to that.  These aren't necessary expenses, this isn't an argument about needs, it is quite literally a *fairy tale* question about how much you would like to make you completely at ease and not have to really think about money much and do whatever you want for the most part. What you are responding to is someone saying that he would be able to pursue everything he would want to do without money holding him back, so why do you keep circling back to necessary expenses which is irrelevant to this?"
AskReddit,feomp9y,t1_feocu0u,1579302292.0,"Just because you have that much doesn't mean you need to spend that arbitrary 3% number. Having a large cushion helps with peace of mind. 

But lets assume that is the amount. It is much easier to spend that much than you would think, especially if you have a family which drastically increases prices if you are living a slightly nicer life. You literally said yourself it goes very fast if you aren't holding back, so I'm not entirely sure how you can't conceive of a monthly budget that adds up to $25k.  You also aren't working so you have more time to actually spend your money. First though, is this magical number put into your 401k? Or into your bank account? If it was invested in your 401k you now need to pay taxes to take it out so that 25k a month now is drastically less. Even if you  magically had the number in your bank account you will invest it and when you take it out you will have capital gains which will decrease what you have to spend each month. If the market completely crashes you also now have less since you are taking out the 3%, which can be a significant amount depending on the bear market. You may not have a $10 million house, but you could very well spending a decent amount on your mortgage, insurance, taxes. You may not buy a Ferrari, but you could also very well be spending a decent amount on a nice SUV. A nice, but not overly extravagant vacation to Europe could easily be $15k for a nice 2 week trip if you have kids once you factor everything in, which you could be doing fairly often since you aren't working. A nice meal at a steakhouse for a family can approach $1k, and that is just one night. My point is things add up. 


&nbsp;

I'm not saying that $300k a year isn't a nice life, it is.

With that number he's not buying a bunch of exotic cars and a jet, but he can travel, eat at nice restaurants do normal things and do it comfortably. That number would be different for everyone obviously, some people want more than others.
