And I think it's interesting that a mathematician who valued himself by his success in that field rather than social connections, and who hated the technology that seemed to be pushing his kind into irrelevance, might also lash out at young people in romantic relationships. There are a couple of sketches of the Zodiac that look quite similar to Kaczynski at the time, and the Zodiac killings seem to line up with the problems he was having at university. Unsolved Mysteries did a couple of segments on the Zodiac, the Unibomber, and the potential connections. Really interesting stuff."

Sanders is unbelievably dangerous to people who are owned by giant corporations and his FANTASTIC popularity is scaring the hell out a lot of people. 

Unfortunately (and CNN is banking on this) a lot of casual followers at home are going to buy this ridiculous anti-women narrative.

EDIT: Not sure if it was the moderator or the woman journalist because that's right when I tuned in and I was making dinner. But CNN clearly has an anti-Bern bent.

I use these to record but I can't mix or master with them because the low end is too weak. I have some JBL LSR305s at home and I like them for mixing, but I find I squash things far too much if I master on them. I'm on the road at the moment and I realized my stuff was just squashed to death from mastering on the 305s. Sounds strange on my iPhone and I figure that's probably the most common listening hardware in the world. So I started a fresh master and now it will probably sound terrible on my 305s. 

I've gotten to the point where I've given up on trying to mix and master as separate processes, primarily because I blew a bunch of money sending a bad mix (that I thought sounded good) to a pro mastering engineer. I don't know what a pre-master mix should sound like, apparently. So I do everything together. I am getting very close on the final product, I think. I wonder if I'm just trying to push too hard."
