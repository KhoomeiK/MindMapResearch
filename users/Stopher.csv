Cruise,ff6467h,t1_ff601il,1579618687.0,"I think the price difference can depend on the room level and the sailing. I was looking at a 10 day balcony and the difference was 200 dollars. So 341 for 1 (I'm soloing.)  but I'm also getting all the other perks. Dining. Internet. etc. plus picking a room. So that seems great.
I have seen times where it was a much bigger difference though so you really have to compare it to the current sail-away rate on the trip you're looking at."
Cruise,ff5el15,t1_ff4wzt4,1579589544.0,"That said, if they are planning on getting the drink package it will be cheaper to not take the sail away rate and get it as a perk rather than paying for it as an add on."

Cruise,fdj739z,t3_elkvg3,1578460300.0,"The only thing I‚Äôve heard that makes sense to do that is that you can buy cruise cash with NCL card points. So some people do their purchases through the year on the NCL credit card and then use the points on the cruise. I don‚Äôt know why you wouldn‚Äôt just use that balance to pay for the cruise. Maybe they paid the cruise balance earlier. I‚Äôm not sure if they give you 3% on cruise cash purchases. I think that‚Äôs what they give for cruises but how many of those do you buy a year? 

Personally, the NCL card has a pretty lousy program. You can do a lot better with other cash back cards."
