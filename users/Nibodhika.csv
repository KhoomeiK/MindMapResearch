That being said Ubuntu is a good distro, and your next choice should be which DE to use, you can install several and try them out to figure which you like best.

Face it, Wayland is still not at a stage people should be using it on day-to-day, and that goes for all cards. I know your rebuttal will be that you or someone else does, but you're still using XWayland, and that's the same as saying Linux is at a good stage because wine works well."

And what do you mean they refuse to upstream their drivers? They have a closed source driver and have contributed to nouveau in the past.

Nvidia is a shitty company for other reasons, but their Linux support has been long established, whereas AMD used to be a pain in the ass and a complete and utter shit GPU on Linux until a few years back. AMD's new support for Linux is great, and my next card will likely be an AMD because of it, but let's not mix things up, nVidia has a stellar record of Linux support, while AMD has a history of fucking over, hopefully it changed now but that's no reason to bite the hand that fed us for decades."

In our society gender roles are still very present, and a lot of people would feel offended if you said they're too manly/womanly. But even if we lived in a society where gender roles were extinguished transgenders would still exist, although I don't think they would be looked any different than someone who does a nose or boob job or even paint their hair.

Just think about it, imagine our language used different pronouns for people depending on hair color, and they were expected to perform different roles in our society. Someone growing up in that society might consider someone dying their hair something weird, and say stuff like ""but your document says you're a burnette"" or ""you're biologically blond, so why should I call you like a burnette just because you painted your hair"". The reason we look very casually at painting one's hair is because we as a society see no difference between people with different hair color. 

Hopefully in the future we might be able to achieve a society in which gender roles are extinguished, but even in then some people might not feel comfortable with their bodies, and would perform surgery to fix their appearance with the internal image they have of themselves.

Just like this I could cherry pick different stuff to counter every other point made in regards of setting, there were Nazi Brujah before, and neo-nazi and skinheads bare a lot of semblance with the core idea of the philosophical warrior stereotype of the Brujah.

WhiteWolfRPG,fdlwspb,t1_fdluo46,1578534378.0,"Because there's no such thing as magic, there's paradigms.

The order of reason (original name for the Technocracy) realized that if they could convince people that their paradigm was the correct it would be easier to push it forward. So today people think that science is so different from magic that they cannot see them as two faces of the same coin, one is real and concrete, the other is imaginary and abstract. Mages are people who are so firm in their beliefs that they can change the world around them, a mage can believe that if he focuses his be he can release a blast of energy, but because people are less likely to believe a Kamehameha than a blaster pistol one of them produces paradox and the other doesn't, meaning that mages while very powerful suffer a drawback from what people believe is possible.

See, the World of Darkness is not ""real"" in the sense you and I understand it, how reality works depends on how people expect it to work. A long while ago (during dark ages) a group of mages realized that it wasn't a very good idea to let reality be so malleable, and so created a group of beliefs that they could push slowly to people in order to force everyone to believe in the same thing and thus create order in the world. These mages are collectively called the Technocracy and the group of beliefs they created is called science. Obviously they have been hunting everything that doesn't fit their narrative of how the world should run, vampires are relatively low in their list because they hide themselves from the crowd, mages on the other hand want humans to know magick exists, but doing so carries the weight of the Technocracy going after you.

Their compulsion (which might trigger on a bestial failure) is that they must punish, by drinking their blood, of someone who transgressed their personal creed. Not doing so implies in dice penalties.

So, if you roll a bestial failure, and roll the clan compulsion, and another vampire acts against your personal Creed you can choose to suffer dice penalties or feed on them, but if you feed you'll trigger the clan bane and be forced to make a frenzy test to prevent drinking them dry. If you succeed on that test and thus only drank a little, then you would be 1 step blood bound to that person, but do notice that until 3 drinks the blood bond is relatively weak."

A blessing because it allows them to survive in the modern world, and a curse because it takes away their power and makes them more ""mortal"".

A true fae would certainly die if he faced the modern world (because he has no human skin to protect him from the Banality), which is why if one came out of the deep dreaming it would probably do so with its own pocket reality, akin to Marauders that change the world around them, and inside that reality he would be as powerful as ever (because it doesn't really matter how much Banality is in the world, his powers are from the Dreaming and he has no mortal part to disbelief in himself)"

What you played is a video game based on a table top RPG (I will suppose you're familiar with TTRPGs, but in case you aren't you should look into it it's very fun). The book that was the current version when Bloodlines was released was revised edition which you can find [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/647), that is also the edition I recommend you read since it has the most lore and it's a classic that introduced most of us into the world of darkness.

The 20th year edition is a compilation of a lot of stuff, but doesn't have that much lore, so you probably shouldn't start with it, but it's very complete if you want to play the game.

5th edition (the current one) changed a lot of stuff from the rules, and brought the lore to the 21st century. But it's relatively new and doesn't have many supplements to give you more lore, but if you want to actually play a vampire game I would strongly recommend you go with this edition. Since this is the current edition you can find physical copies of it in your local game store or buy it online.


Also a sidenote, in the same universe there are also Werewolves, mages, fairies, demons, spirits, mummies, etc. Each with their own books and lore, since that's what you like you will probably enjoy them too.

Sidenote2 a couple of years back (before 5th edition) there was a reboot of the universe that's now called Chronicles of Darkness, which has another line for Vampires (the Requiem), Werewolves, etc so you might want to check that one too to see what you like best.

The three main lines have something that they fight internally that takes away their control, Vampires fight with an internal Beast that pushes them to kill, Werewolves have so much Rage it can explode at any minute, and Mages have Paradox from bending reality always waiting to hit back.

However Demons are completely rational creatures, they choose to be evil or good without any sort of supernatural pushing. While I agree that the more similar thing would be torment, if I were to write Demon I would give them Faith Dice that work opposite of Hunger/Rage/Paradox dice. So for example a faith die could cost less to re-roll, could have a lower target number, or could count as a 10 on 9-10. Meaning that a Demon would have a very good reason to seek always more Faith besides fueling their powers.

In V5 Celerity is very different, they changed a lot of how those physical disciplines worked, IMO for the better, but there are a lot of people pissed off because they ""nerfed"" vampires."

In revised Celerity gives extra actions at the cost of one bp. So in your example the vampire can roll 5 dice and attack once, or spend 1 blood point and attack up to three times with a pool of 5 each time, he gets no bonus to dexterity rolls, and gains all extra actions for a single blood point.

Personally I like V20 rules better, so it might be the case that your group is using V20 rules even if otherwise you play revised."

Also combat is not THAT important in VtM. I've seen plenty of GMs who've only narrated D&D in the past try to make VtM a game about encounters and fights. If that's what you and your group want, go ahead, but most of my main advices will be to distance yourself from that.

For example, put a mugger to try to rob your players, they might just attack him out of instinct in D&D, but what do they do with the body now? Did they feed on him? The prince might want heads rolling if a body without blood is found.

Another example would be put the sheriff or a similarly powerful vampire to antagonize the players, the moment they try to attack him they'll realize that trying to fight a vampire head-on is basically a suicide mission. Maybe he stakes all of the players in a couple of turns without breaking a sweat just to showcase that you shouldn't mess with him.

Since you're running revised, put emphasis on the humanity, make your players roll it and feel it slipping away from their fingers. Put some emphasis on the hunt, the blood points should not be like Mana points that get replenished easily, each blood point is about a liter of blood, that has to come from someone, who is/was that person, how did they crossed paths, etc are all very interesting narrative hooks in Vampire.

Same for M20, so I think it's safe to assume W20 will be an all-you-can-GM book.

That being said while they are rule and factions heavy, they don't have a lot of setting. Meaning you won't get NPCs for your cities, or city stories or that sort of stuff that you would get from the city books, e.g. Chicago by night. For me that is perfect, because I like to create my own cities and NPCs anyways, but some might prefer to use a book for that.

At the end of the day if you're looking for one book to rule them all and you already know the game, W20 is the way to go. On a side note if you were just now starting with WoD I would recommend revised instead of W20, because it has more setting and is less rule heavy (at least that's what I would say for vampire and mage, so I think it's safe to assume it also applies to Werewolf)"

Even if a sleeper saw you cast a Harry potteresque spell and a gun jam he would think it was a coincidence, but surely if a sleeper could see you rewind time it would be Vulgar. For the same reason it seems that if a sleeper saw you rip a tear in space and pull a gun it should also be vulgar. The backpack shielding the view doesn't seem that different than the sleeper not realizing time went back because he went together, so if the HAB can be outside of time to see you rewind time, why is it so difficult for him to see inside a backpack?

At the end of the day I know I'm in the wrong according to official rules, is just that I feel this particular rule is not very in line with everything else, and it seems more like a leftover from first edition where only the result mattered.

So it feels that even if they didn't saw anything out of the ordinary it would still be against their consensus reality. Otherwise why make it stop at correspondence 2? David Copperfield has made very large objects appear and disapear. And in the same way that I can pull a gun from a backpack and it's not disrupting anyone's reality because I could have had a gun in there, I could drive a car out of a garage (where there was no car before) and it shouldn't disrupt anyone's reality because there could have been a car there.

But you're making a compelling argument, the more I think about the stage magic example the more it seems that it would be acceptable, and I can see how it is exactly the same as the gun example.

WhiteWolfRPG,fclr8z1,t3_eht386,1577754529.0,"Hello there, first of all I would agree with everyone that hunger, bestial failures (and compulsions), and messy criticals are a must because they will be involved in every single roll. Besides that it really depends on your campaign and players, but I think that humanity (humanity/stains/touchstones/tenets) is a very important system, and combat (both physical and social) might be important depending on your group.

You don't need the Camarilla or Anarch books, but they can help you if you want a campaign focused on one of these groups. Banu Haquim and Ministry basic rules are in the Camarilla and Anarch books respectively, so there's not much information about them on the core book, and if you want to incorporate them you should probably buy the correspondent book or read the old ones and adapt the clan to the new setting and system. But you can just as simply not put Vampires from those clan in your game.

As for the setting I personally recommend you try to think of it in your own city, it's a lot easier for everyone to imagine, and for you to think where would a given vampire live, etc. That is if you live in a relatively big city, since vampires tend to concentrate where there's high population density because it's easier to feed without arising suspicion. You don't need to follow the universe story if you want something different, e.g. if you want that London be a stable city that has never had any trouble or dissonance that's great.

For me it's a simple question, if I do it in front of someone is it vulgar? In the case of teleporting/creating a gun I think we agree it is, so why doing it inside a backpack makes it coincidental? What about pulling a gun from my backs? I could have one sucked in my belt, is that coincidental too?"

Which is my point, there's no way you can make a gun appear in your backpack coincidentally. Opening a pocket size hole through reality should be very much vulgar.

I'm a hobby magician, I know about stage magic, and that's exactly it, magic like Penn & Teller at a general rule could fool HAB, but not what I'm describing (although certain effects can because they're independent of angle of view).

The thing to me is not that the average observer misses things, but that he doesn't know them. E.g. a random person could look at every notch from a gun and still believe that it jammed for natural causes, he could inspect the ladder thuroughly and still believe it when it breaks, but if he looked at the backpack he wouldn't believe it when you pull a gun from it.

I agree with you that there is no wrong fun, if you and your group are having fun then that is all that matters, and if your group likes to play superheros with fangs by all means play that. However VtM is a game designed for personal horror, and if you're playing this sort of game you're withdrawing the theme, some mechanics and a lot of what makes VtM the game it is. It would be the same as playing D&D without ever fighting, you would be playing it wrong in the sense that that's not how it's intended to be played.
