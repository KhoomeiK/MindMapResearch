One point of clarification: strictly speaking we're not concerned about a MITM, but about connecting to a malicious host, right?

If we fail to check fingerprints, we don't know which host we've connected to, but even if we connect to a malicious host, it can't then connect through to the true destination host because we haven't revealed our client private key, right?"

Thankfully, with the major cloud computing providers, it *is* possible to retrieve the expected fingerprints before firing up ssh on the client side.

On Amazon EC2, it's possible to retrieve the fingerprints of new instances, using the web dashboard. It's not convenient, but it works. (The fingerprints are buried in the 'system log' recorded when the instance is first started. They are not retained by EC2 if you shut down the instance and later start it back up. Pretty clunky!)"

Right. Amazon EC2 makes this possible; you can retrieve the fingerprints securely using the web dashboard. It's not very convenient, but that's another matter.

I'm afraid I don't get you. Installing what kind of thing, on which machine?

I don't think so, as, at least according to [this other answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptography/comments/eg4smr/amazon_ec2_linux_instances_hold_only_the_ssh/fc4icmx/), I had missed that SSH fingerprints are actually for proving that the host is in possession of the *host private key*, from a different keypair than the one used to authenticate the SSH client.

Fingerprints are for authenticating the *host*, after all. If a malicious host could impersonate a given host fingerprint without even needing to be in possession of any secret, fingerprints would be worthless.

> to pull off this attack maliciously, attacker would needs compromise your DNS, if that's the case, you have bigger problems.

We don't accept that kind of thinking for online banking, so we insist on CAs. I want equivalent assurances when dealing with SSH.

In my case they'd actually need to do one better: they'd need to intercept traffic destined for the true host IP, and reroute it to a malicious host. (I have little reason to point SSH at a network name, I just point it straight to the public IP reported by AWS.)"

Strictly speaking it's possible to require both private key *and* password to authenticate a user with SSH.

But yes, the gist of what you say is what I meant: the authorized keys file lists the public key associated with the client's private key.


The crux of what I was missing was that the server has a private key at all. I'd read Amazon's writeup to mean the only private key involved was the client private key, but as you say, the server has its own private key too, which we can confirm by checking the fingerprint to ensure no man-in-the-middle."

And of course, subsequent connections simply check that the fingerprint hasn't changed.

[From](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=193768#351597) what [I](https://jumpnowtek.com/security/SSH-Hostkey-Fingerprints.html) can [gather](https://www.jscape.com/blog/ssh-key-fingerprint) from [various](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/126781/) online [sources](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html), the way to do it is to compare SSH fingerprints.

If I understand correctly, this is really just a way of ensuring the host has the expected *public* key. But if that's the way we ensure we're connecting to the expected host, surely we have to be protective of that 'public' key, no?

If an attacker got a copy of that public key, they could impersonate my host, and they'd show the same fingerprint. When I connect using my private key, surely the impersonation would be indistinguishable, no?

> You might need to keep the original key for paid support? not sure

I don't think there's any need to - the page says that Amazon don't keep a copy of the corresponding private key.
