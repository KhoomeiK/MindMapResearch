To me, not having many long-term friends and having a poor relationship with their parents (unless they are abusive) is a red flag. It suggests that they'll burn bridges with anybody and are just professional victims, basically people you don't want in your life which I found out the hard way.

I think the reason that they think you have an attitude problem is because they're used to you taking their orders and now you're not, they're trying to get you back under their control. Also I find a lot of people have formed an image of you and your personality once they've known you for a while, if you try and change your personality unless its for their good, they don't tend to like it. If you're already an assertive person you can get away with it, but if you're submissive then its easier to accuse you of having an attitude problem.

That being said, I know some very submissive people that had literally no assertiveness skills that tried to be 'assertive', they went from one extreme to another, ""I'll listen and do"" to ""I'm the boss now, do as I say"" without realising there is a middle ground, ""I see your point, but still disagree.""

He actually used to be a bit of a class clown at my primary school and in the first few years of secondary school and even had a few friends, but then he suddenly went quiet when we were all in Year 9 (school year for 13-14 years old in the UK). I don't know if he had any mental health problems or something was going on at home, all I just know is he was an only child. He wouldn't speak in class unless spoken to, and even when he was called upon to speak, he tried to mumble so the teacher wouldn't pick him again. Yet before, he'd add comments that made the class laugh. Literally it was class clown to a very quiet and reserved individual almost overnight.

Nobody really knew him as he was very secretive and just didn't engage with anybody, and eventually everybody just presumed that he preferred his own company. My year group finished Year 13 and secondary education in the summer of 2016, and since then literally nobody's heard from him in the last three and a half years, we don't even know if he's gone off to university.

To answer your last point, I think its a generational thing, to think about respect and society. Even when my grandparents' generation was young (1950s-1960s), their elders said that society was declining morally and discipline wise, and that the youth were running wild thanks to rock and roll.

Looking back I think I had a nice middle ground and its still the same in adulthood, I seem to be the middle man that everybody gets along with in social situations."

AskReddit,ferqixr,t3_eq939i,1579357199.0,"Depending on how bad it was in terms of violence and sex, I wasn't allowed to see some 18 rated movies until I actually turned 18 (my parents were otherwise really chill). Whilst I now understand as an adult why my parents enforced those rules and I see where they were coming from, in a way it backfired, as I was quite a curious teenager in general and it only made me want to watch the movie. I still believe that if you make something forbidden fruit, it only makes it more desirable.

I remember putting on a DVD of Pulp Fiction when my parents went out for a day. I was really paying attention to the movie and all, but was also waiting to see if my parents got back early so I could eject the DVD from the player, which they didn't. I really enjoyed it, and to this day its my favourite movie of all time. Turns out its my parent's favourite movie too, and once I confessed to them I watched it, they slightly disappointed I broke their rules, but also pleased too. We then spent 10-15 minutes joking about all the characters and yelling ""English motherfucker, do you speak it?""."

Especially if it is a woman or a child speaking, it is very easy to mishear what they are saying because they tend to have higher pitched voices. I'm guessing you can hear people, but can't understand sometimes what is being said. Go to an audiologist and get your hearing checked."
