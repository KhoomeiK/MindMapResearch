TalesFromRetail,ffe41hi,t3_et2py5,1579836135.0,I have to assume that the online system you're using requires payment by credit card; if it allows payment from a bank card or paypal and the like its feasible someone might not even have a credit card and then I'm a bit on the side of the customer here (except for the repetition lol)
news,feyyati,t1_feywd6y,1579451954.0,"Generally speaking workers comp would prevent that, the higher liability risk would be injuries to others.

I'm not a library, you know how to Google. And I got better things to do. 

Oh and 'off premises' actually increases the risk to the company significantly as the insurance company will immediately wash their hands and start crying loophole, so the company becomes directly liable instead of a possible insurance payout."
news,feysi34,t1_feyk0nl,1579450068.0,"The legal term you're looking for is 'respondeat superior' under which employers may be legally liable for actions of employees, even without proof of wrongdoing of the employer. And possibly the supervisor allowing her to leave against standing rules/policies could be construed that way.

Damages to the employee herself would be protected/limited under workers comp but still damaging to the company.

I'm not saying anyone should have been fired, I'm just saying the firings had nothing to do with the fact that she gave someone $20."
news,fexk57p,t3_eqqz5d,1579432305.0,This is probably the best possible way this story could have ended and still end up on the news. No one should have been fired and this story wouldn't exist - any other story around this situation ends much darker.

Who told her 'yeah, sure, go do this potentially dangerous thing that the company will definately fire you over' except without warning her (or being ignorant of reality)?"
news,fex10qc,t1_fewzu02,1579422576.0,"See, that's how the clickbait title wants you to see it to spark your outrage. 'Employee and supervisor fired for putting employee at risk and exposing company to possible litigation' is something that happens probably hundreds of times each day and won't get you to click on the link and feed those sweet ad revenues. 

There is very little story here. Yes, they did a good deed but broke a bunch of rules to do so and got fired. Maybe they didn't need to be fired since nothing bad actually happened but we dont know enough about these employees to say if it's an overreaction or not."
news,fewyn89,t1_feww8xt,1579421502.0,"Wow, no. Have fun running a company where the employees don't have to listen to supervisors and can ignore any rules they don't agree with. That's not mindless it's just basic structure. 

This is actually a perfect example of why a policy might exist, so a supervisor *doesn't* accidentally tell an employee to go do something that puts the company at risk. 

These firings had absolutely nothing to do with her giving money to someone in need. I dont work for US bank, so cant know specifics, but she left work during work hours, possibly accessed personal information beyond the scope of her job, possibly violated any number of culpability protections the bank has in place regarding treating cases with equality. And because of her, we also have thousands of people who know this guy was in a tight spot financially (breach of client privacy). And her supervisor okayed this possibly because of a similar attitude."
news,fewvu0o,t1_fewo7x3,1579420284.0,"Eh, to be fair the manager's firing *is* probably overkill if it's just about this solitary incident (and we don't really know the backstory there). 

I guess what I meant is it seems to be *more correct* that the blame is on the supervisor here who has a responsibility to know (or check) these sorts of policies before allowing an employee to leave during/for work."
news,fewu3u2,t1_fewt9py,1579419515.0,"She was meeting a client of her company, during her regular work hours, with her supervisor's permission. The company is absolutely liable if something bad had happened to her.

Remember, it's a bank, they don't care about what she does, they care about if they can be sued or not :s"

news,fewpmgh,t1_fewo41t,1579417603.0,"If an employee goes to their supervisor and asks if they can do something (no matter what it is) and are told 'no you can't do that' and they do it anyways, yeah, IMO that gives the company justification to fire someone. Not saying they should always be fired (obv depends on circumstance) just pointing out the difference from this situation.

Here, the employee asked permission to do something and *was granted it*, and then got fired for doing it. IMO not a firing offence, more of a retraining and or education- onus is on the supervisor who okayed it."
news,fewjy0m,t1_fewano0,1579412215.0,"The firings have nothing to do with her giving him the money, it's the bunch of company policies and rules she broke to do so that potentially could have exposed the company to liability claims that caused then to freak out."
news,fewjq23,t1_fewj4f6,1579412039.0,"Yeah, if she had asked and was told it was against company policies and did it anyways she should/could have been fired. As it was, the manager was correctly fired for allowing her to do it, but she shouldn't have been penalized imo as she was given permission."
facepalm,fevfq06,t1_fepdio3,1579396889.0,"Manager was and should have been fired but it should have stopped at that. Employee should have had (re)training. Supervisor should never have allowed the breach in policy, and imo the permission from that supervisor should have protected the employee."

Not only is the message garbled beyond understanding (did the meth addict force his daughter to become a prostitute or is his daughter the addict?), I'm pretty sure the idea is offensive to women, addicts, prostitutes and their families all on it's own.

Gotta love the placement next to the 'oops we called our food drugs' sign tho."

A wheelchair can get you and your party through security and to your gate much faster at some airports.

Strangely the opposite is true too. My dad was recovering from surgery and required a wheelchair when we had a connecting flight through Heathrow. We called ahead to arrange the chair as we disembarked and we were basically taken for a tour of the airport back alleys with 'waiting areas' where we were stopped for 10-15 minutes for no apparent reason. We even had to leave the terminal and go for a freaking bus ride at one point. I asked one of the staff about it and she told us they deliberately made the accessible travel take longer than just walking would have taken to discourage travelers from using accessible services. We made our connecting flight but not by much."

Also don't forget the TTD effects - TTD is better used to inflict status effects than actually using it to kill things - blind guys with guns and crippled melee enemies aren't much of a threat.

I haven't found myself usually taking much damage when playing at range, mostly enemies die too quick to fire back much, but I also tend to pick off stragglers from stealth first so the groups usually aren't too big."
