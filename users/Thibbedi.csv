Foodforthought,fc9k5xe,t1_fc9iyha,1577553867.0,I'm only talking about this case. Of course it's f-ing alarming if they continue to renew their contract with the U.S. government after the news about what ICE and the Trump administration are doing. What other contractual partners do they have that do horrible things with the information Palantir delivers?
Foodforthought,fc9817r,t1_fc96sp7,1577548507.0,"No, you asked if I was okay with you hacking my devices and you opting out of any responsibility after the act. Please read your own question again. Why would Amazon be responsible for your criminal act? 

How Palantir gathers their information is not what we are arguing here. I've already said that it's another question and that I'm probably not ok with how they are doing it.

Maybe you should spend some time reading what has already been written in the discussion to understand what we are discussing before you throw attempted insults at me. Or if there is some kind of point to your weird argument that has anything to do with the discussion at hand, please help us to understand it. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who doesn't understand in that case."
Foodforthought,fc94fvt,t1_fc9327v,1577546872.0,"No that would not be alright at all with me. That's what I'm saying, the crime that you're commiting in this scenario does not make Amazon guilty of your crimes. Of course I would hold you responsible since you committed the crime. 
Just like what the ICE is doing doesn't make Palantir accountable for the actions of ICE."

Foodforthought,fc8t1or,t1_fc8rph6,1577541459.0,"It kinda worries me that you can't see how easy it is to make this argument after the fact, yes. 
Is the company/companies that sold the manure to Breivik complicit in his bombing in Oslo? Selling information to the government isn't being complicit to whatever they may or may not do with the information afterwards.
When the act/actions have been committed, yes there should be a legal way for them to opt. out of the contract without any legal/financial repercussions. But you can still not blame them for what the government has done. 
Of course a business deal should never be above the human rights. Do you really believe that the contract between Palantir and the government had any kind of detail or mention about how they were going to deal with possible illegals? How they would treat them?"
Foodforthought,fc8qc6l,t1_fc8parq,1577540060.0,"It seriously worries me that you don't see how easy it is to make your argument after the fact. All I'm saying is that as long as they are legally bound to a contract you can't blame them for not breaking it. You can't say that all this with ICE is Palantir's fault. On the other hand, if they renew the contract, then yes of course they should get some blame.
And obviously if any company enters a contract with any government that later on commits genocide based on the service/information the company provides, that company should do everything in their power to exit the contract or else breach it. But that still doesn't mean you can blame the Genocide on that company."
Foodforthought,fc8ohrg,t1_fc8gkh7,1577539072.0,"I wouldn't say complicit, they provide a service. They can't be held responsible if the government for instance would commit genocide after the information has been provided. They've entered a legally binding contract. As I said, they should do everything they legally can to demonstrate that what the government/ICE is doing isn't okay. Ofc they can turn to other clients as soon as legally possible, that is one way to demonstrate that they don't approve of what is going on.
All I'm saying, you can't put the blame on them and their product/services. They're not the one commiting these horrible acts, and I bet there is no mentions of these acts in the contract they've signed."
Foodforthought,fc8brwh,t3_egliog,1577531352.0,"Uhm... Why argue to put the blame on Palantir in this scenario? Sure I'm probably not entirely ok with how they gather some of the information but that is another question. 
In this scenario the only thing they should do is put some pressure on the administration to not treat people like crap. But there is nothing wrong in helping the government to find people who are there illegally.
Sure one could argue that the moral thing would be to stop when you find out about what happens to the people getting caught. But is it better to breach the contract and put lots of legal citizens out of a job? Shouldn't Palantir instead go for renegotiations of the contract (if contractually possible), publicly stand against the governments practices (if contractually possible) and urge their workers to do the same (if legally/contractually possible)?"

YouShouldKnow,fc2mkll,t1_fc2l0r5,1577367190.0,Doesn't really work like that. It's published by one publisher that might own local publishing companies or sells the local publishing rights for certain regions. The money always goes through the main/head publishing company which in this case is based in NYC.
