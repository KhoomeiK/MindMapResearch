Popular for those will need modularity in variable terrain, but as always, a multiool does many things adequately but none of them expertly.

canoeing,fddofik,t3_ekubbi,1578319524.0,"It's a pretty basic item. Ask the age and history. Check that the hull isn't brittle or damaged by exposure to elements or UV (although depends on material: aluminum? fibreglass? plastic?), particularly look for any dents and scrapes, and wear or reinforcement work along the centreline of the keel, anything that might suggest being dragged over or impacted into rocks.

Then check that things are in generally good condition otherwise - bolts and screws are tight, seats are steady, gunwhales are attached firmly, carry handles and yokes and any other connection points are good, no signs of mould, and so on.

Finally, look for small serial number plates on the hull, these are more common on newer canoes and can be used to trace an owner. If you can spot where one was removed, ask about it - it might indicate a stolen canoe. Receipts and paperwork are always nice but may no longer exist for an older canoe."

Thank you for this, it was hilarious.

Ah, I love it when ""everyone knows"" a thing; however, I'm not sure law is predicated upon things ""everyone knows"" but rather things that specific people or agencies know. And can unequivocally prove."
canoeing,fcvjq9d,t1_fcvid6o,1578003559.0,"Don't knock it until you've tried it! But seriously, it works fine with the seats (you use them to support your butt in kneeling pose, right?) and with four people, you can have your weak paddlers to the opposite side to counterbalance those doing the edging.

canoeing,fcvbjl7,t1_fcv7jot,1577998651.0,"Since you summoned me, I'd like to ask if you and  u/LongBlueVeil are aware of the technique of *edging* whereby you don't sit in the center of the canoe, but rather at the angle between the bottom and side. The whole canoe will be at something closer to a 35 or 40 degree angle, and as a paddler you'll be lower down, closer to the water, and won't bash your knuckles. Edit: [rather like this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZ81dlkFI4M/maxresdefault.jpg)

If you are about to ask how you alternate sides for paddling in a straight line, the answer is that *you don't*. I'd like to introduce you to the [J-stroke](https://ckcanoe.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/jstroke.jpg?w=584), a powerful basic stroke which lets you paddle on one side for as long as you like, and maintain a straight course, with the curl of the J being a course correction using the power face of the blade. I switch sides maybe every half an hour in normal paddling."

I'm starting to think so. It depends on the cost though; I'm willing to pay for repairs, but if it comes close to the cost of a new pair, then I'll probably just get a new pair. Any reason to hang onto older boots?

> Even so, getting a decade out of a pair of boots is pretty impressive, congrats.

Thanks! I was taught early on to always clean them (never leave them muddy). And to care for anything that separates you from the ground - tyres, shoes and boots, beds, chairs. It seems to be paying off."
