Codependency,ffad9sr,t1_ffaapt2,1579732831.0,"Thank you so much for the resources! I wasn't at all abused as a child but I lost my dad at a young age so it's been a battle of being clingy and feeling like I'm never enough. I've been doing much better at it now that I'm an adult but I find this idealization with my ex a bit difficult to get over, especially since I'm fully aware that he's not that person. It's very frustrating. I honestly feel like seeing someone new would make me feel better about this particular issue but I'm just not ready to date again yet. I am enjoying being single right now, so I need some other way to cope with these strange nightmares.

I'm happy that my ex is very sweet though, he does talk about my insecurities with me when I need it and encourages me to feel better about myself. He is a good man with amazing qualities, but I know he's not the man for me."
Codependency,ff9pket,t1_ff9og2k,1579718081.0,Thank you. Honestly it mostly bothers me at night. It's been a while since the breakup and I don't miss the relationship. It just helps to know that I'm not crazy
fatlogic,ff6gnbz,t1_ff6gjkn,1579626784.0,"Thank you! It's been a hell of a journey though. And like I said, unfortunately I'm just skinny fat now haha. Its certainly not over yet"
dragonage,ff5jmsw,t1_feuem8i,1579595990.0,"I remember playing all of Fable 3 and being super into it and the moment I finished the game I just sat there and thought ""Wow... That game wasn't very good"""

relationships,ff5iyyz,t1_ff5ij3b,1579595060.0,"I've definitely seen people fix much worse haha. It wasn't crazy deep stuff, just a bunch of whiteheads from being a nasty teenager. 

I assumed guys just ""didn't like nice girls"" in middleschool but I finally realized it was actually because my face was gross, I was 200lbs as a 5'2 girl, and I had a garbage personality. It's been an ongoing process to fix it all but I'm happy with my progress"
relationships,ff5ibhf,t1_ff5hwdb,1579594177.0,Well that explains a lot. I used to have a lot of milk growing up and I had terrible acne. Now I mostly drink almond milk due to the lower calories in it and my skin is way clearer. It could also have to do with age and better hygiene in general though. I was a gross kid
relationships,ff5al6e,t1_ff59w6i,1579585322.0,"There are plenty of amazing, easy and cheap recipes out there! Especially if you go vegetarian because veggies cost next to nothing and by skipping on the meat you can save a bunch of money.

I ended up going pretty much fully vegetarian in the last year purely for cost effectiveness."
fatlogic,ff59l3r,t1_ff58fkl,1579584371.0,"That's awesome! I'm so glad it's working out for you! I've had a few friends offer to go to the gym with me but we're still working out the kinks. I definitely want to check out some more fun things, but unfortunately it's winter in Canada. When I was fat-fat I had no issues with the cold but now I'm honestly missing the extra insulation haha. I can barely leave my house for work let alone to go to the gym"
fatlogic,ff57cut,t1_ff579jf,1579582356.0,I've been considering pole dancing for a while! It looks so fun and I think it would give me a much needed confidence boost. Even with the weight loss I have a very plain face so it would be nice to feel sexy.
fatlogic,ff54cke,t1_ff540xb,1579579875.0,"Oh you know what I'm an idiot. I don't know why I read that as less than a 20lb drop for you and thought you were saying it was unlikely that someone even 500lbs could lose 20 in a month. That was purely my own poor reading comprehension, my bad"
fatlogic,ff53z7n,t1_ff531vl,1579579586.0,285 is a big leap from 500 though
fatlogic,ff53ubm,t1_ff4wmts,1579579480.0,"I mean it would work for me. I actually might start wearing my bathing suit more often to remind myself to get to the gym! I'm down 90lbs but, unfortunately, I went from obese to skinny-fat. If I just try eating 1200 calories a day now I end up fainting quite a bit so I have no choice but exercise."
relationships,ff51vcf,t1_ff3zaj2,1579577968.0,"If that's the case it could be that she's simply feeling unappreciated. Have you done anything for her recently? I know when I reached my 2 year anniversary with my now ex I wanted him to take me out on dates more. Real dates. He considered going to Canadian Tire together to pick something up for him a date. 

If she was totally fine before and all of a sudden isn't it could be a lack of communication about her needs. If you can, take her out somewhere nice as a surprise (if she likes surprises that is). Or bring her home some flowers. If you can't afford that you should just sit her down and talk to her. Don't accuse her of anything or get defensive, just ask her if something is up and why she feels the sudden change is necessary. I'd bet that she just wants some good old fashioned romance."
aww,ff4djdc,t3_erft7p,1579561059.0,"This dog is so sweet and polite! My dog only cares about boundaries with his owners. 

I had a friend come over and we were eating pizza and I guess Benji (my dog) assumed he had hierarchy over him and just took the slice right from his hand and walked off like he'd done nothing wrong. My poor friend just sat there in shock watching him eat his pizza."
trashy,ff4d1ca,t1_ff4caj6,1579560731.0,"That really sucks. I'm lucky enough to live in a pretty liberal part of Canada so everyone here is pretty accommodating towards vegan/vegetarians. Occasionally you get the whole ""What? No bacon?"" but it's clearly a light hearted joke and I've never had anyone push the matter.

That being said though I'm more of a flexible pescitarian so it's a bit easier to accommodate me. I eat fish and eggs but avoid dairy and other meats. If I'm at a cool restaurant and they have something with meat or dairy that I've never tried before I'd consider it but so far I've never felt compelled to have the meat dishes. I just don't like the texture of meat and eating it makes me feel dirty. To each their own. I definitely wouldn't judge or hate on someone for eating meat because that's not my business."

wownoob,fefrwj3,t1_fefrp2d,1579063393.0,"No worries! You're a lifesaver right now haha ask away.

She's been playing a few days so she already has a toon, so we've done that. She's on Lightbringer but I don't even have the option to join her server with a new toon since it's also not on my realmlist. It's like we have two completely different lists."

dating_advice,fdykd38,t1_fdyfufn,1578780666.0,"This is the worst advice I've ever heard.

What would the ideal out come of that be? You tell her she's a shallow bitch for not wanting to fuck you and what...? She apologizes? Decides that you're the love of her life?

Or will she more likely tell you to go fuck yourself and block you on everything. 

Just leave the girl alone. You catfished her. Even if she did like your personality at some point there is no trust there anymore, and therefore no relationship of any sort."
My600lbLife,fdo1wc6,t3_em2s72,1578597373.0,"My roommate normally hates it but he loved the episode from this season with Lennie and his brother. 

He honestly thought I just hated fat people (which is ridiculous since I was myself fat just last year) but I genuinely enjoy seeing them do better for themselves."
dating_advice,fdnmmwb,t1_fdnmeh0,1578588962.0,"Don't stress so much! I'm 20 and I get called both and I'm definitely not offended. It's unlikely she'd be offended by either term, but female has some pretty rough connotations now with the Nice Guy/Incel communities taking it and using it to make it seem like women aren't actual people. Plus it's just a bit too formal. 

Seriously though, she sounds like she's into you and I am genuinely happy for you."
dating_advice,fdnmcrv,t1_fdmmwxu,1578588797.0,"Depends on the age demographic too. I know in highschool I would have much rather been called ""cute"", me and my girlfriends talked about that topic a lot actually. Beautiful was just a little bit too much. 

That being said now that I'm in my 20's I'd be down to be called beautiful once in a while."
dating_advice,fdnm1tb,t3_em437p,1578588618.0,"Congrats dude! You've done the hardest part!

One little pointer though, try getting out of the habit of calling women ""females"". It's become a bit of a red flag nowadays. I doubt you meant it in any shitty way but it can be seen as dehumanizing. Not every girl will be offended by it of course but it's best to dodge any potential issues before you get to that point."
relationships,fdkwo0x,t1_fdkvaou,1578512699.0,"Yeah this was honestly my first though too. Of course I wouldn't write off that it could be a bad sign but talking like adults seems like the best decision. It seriously could have been an innocent ""I want to check up on you because you've been having a hard time"". Since he has a drug problem and she's a caring person it could just be genuine concern for his wellbeing"
unwantedsexts,fdjb59o,t1_fdizcv3,1578463909.0,It's a couple years old now. A friend just posted it on Facebook and it came up as a memory
relationships,fdj76yd,t1_fdizmw9,1578460384.0,"Yup, this is such a terrible feeling too. 

I started dating my now ex when we were only 17 and we dated for about 3 years (we took a few months gap at some point) and while he wasn't abusive or a narcissist or anything he was terrible at giving me affection by the end. I begged him to plan something for our 2 year anniversary and on the day of I gave him this photo album with all of our childhood photos and our photos together as a couple with the intention of filling it out more over the years. It was damn cute. 

He... Got angry. He was upset and took it out on me because he didn't do anything at all for our anniversary. A few months later though he bought me flowers for valentine's day. He didn't get my favourite kind, or even a card, but because I'd gotten nothing from him in about a year I cried and thought our relationship was saved. Obviously, it was not. 

We're still good friends, he's a great guy, we just started dating when we were too young. In the end I'm much happier being single and enjoying my early 20's by working on myself."
fatlogic,fdg4c0b,t1_fdg2kls,1578379512.0,"Yeah, it's all going good now! I'm working on learning how to eat ""like a skinny person"" naturally now. Healthy foods, smaller portions, just generally making better decisions.

Also I'm a 5'1 woman. I'm pretty short and don't have any muscle to speak of really so 105lbs is in a healthy BMI for me. That being said if I'm happy with the results sooner then I'll gladly go into maintenance. I mostly want to find where I'm happiest though. If I can get to 105lbs but maintaining that is hell then I'll just allow myself to go back to 110lbs-120lbs and maintain that"
fatlogic,fdg2002,t1_fdfjfwq,1578377081.0,"It sucks because while I never really fell into the same ideology, I fully understand why someone would. I used to make a bunch of excuses for myself. ""I'm not that big"" and ""I was just born like this"". It was all bullshit but it made me feel better and allowed me to not take responsibility for my shitty eating habits. 

Thank you for the congratulations. I still have a bit of a ways to go, I went through a rough breakup and put back on 10 pounds over about 4 months but I'm back on track to get myself down from 130lbs to 105lbs hopefully by the summer!"
fatlogic,fdec6es,t1_fde3eea,1578335823.0,"It's a lot of effort, especially if you've never been thin since it's such a learning curve, but it's beyond worth it. 

I feel healthier, genuinely. I can do more, people respect me more and, while I've been a bit resentful of it lately, I do get a lot more positive attention than I used to. The best part though is that I can look at myself in the mirror and like what I see, which is a new thing for me."
fatlogic,fde2tdm,t1_fddwxhm,1578329914.0,"I was always a fat girl. I just grew up in a household of poor diet choices, granted I excuse my mom for that due to her situation, but it still meant I'd never really been thin. Ever. So I genuinely didn't know what healthy felt like and I thought I was healthy! 

I've lost 80lbs now, give or take since I've stopped caring for the holidays, and am in a normal BMI range and man did I NOT feel healthy before. I just didn't know any better."

AskReddit,fcc9rxa,t3_egwusn,1577595961.0,"In most cases, there isn't much you can say.

I lost my dad when I was 11 and all I wanted was for someone to hear me. I acted out a lot and then when I got negative reactions for that went quiet for a long time. All I wanted was for someone to pay attention to me. Just someone making a point to say that I could cry and talk about it to them would have been immensely helpful, and thankfully I got that but not until I made some great friends in my late teens.

Also not quite the same but after my first serious breakup (which is a losing a loved one, just in a different context) all I needed was a hug. Physical contact can go a long way when helping someone through grieving. I remember being all alone the day after and I was so desperate for comfort from another human being that I walked around my neighborhood in tears just hoping that someone would notice me. No one did, but it would have made the process much less painful.

My roommate is one of my best friends and I know that if I ever need a hug or someone to just listen, he's there for me. Even if I don't take him up on it, just knowing that I can is enough."
fatlogic,fbyxmkc,t1_fbyuhmi,1577229120.0,"Yeah, fat shaming made me feel way worse about myself. If people were going to call me a whale, I'd just see myself as that and then why would I bother putting effort into myself if I'm just a whale anyways?

I actually started dating a sweet guy who convinced me that I was beautiful without having to lose weight and that just made me realize that losing weight would do nothing but improve my gradually growing self esteem! Now I'm down from over 200lbs to 120lbs and I've never felt better. I'm a short woman, 5'2, so I still haven't quite made it to my goal weight of 105lbs but I know that I can do that so I'm not at all worried about it. The relationship with him ended but due to all the support he gave me over the years I still consider him to be my best friend. He's seriously an amazing dude."
relationships,fbrmvph,t3_ee5cfs,1577044367.0,"I had this experience with my mom one year. I got a few small things (which was to be expected, my mom and her fiance combined have 6 kids) but they all seemed so... Not me. It was dissapointing and it felt like they hardly knew me. 

That being said when she confronted me later and asked if I was okay I explained to her calmly that I just didn't understand why she thought I would like that specific thing. I didn't tell her I hated them, but genuinely asked what the thought process was and she told me. Honestly hearing how she came to the conclusion to get those specific items for me made me grow to love them because it showed that even if they didn't make sense on the surface level, they did have me in mind when getting them.

It's hard to do without coming off as offensive but try practising in the mirror, maybe be a little manipulative about it and pretend to be happy with the gift and just ask where the ""inspiration"" came from. 

Some people are just not good gift givers and even I dislike buying from a wish list because it comes off as less personal. The list might actually be detrimental because I know that I at least will read that list and decide that they're all too obvious and avoid getting those things at all cost. 

Some people are going to say to get a divorce over this, I disagree. If there are other areas in your relationship that are equally as dissapointing though couple's counselling may be able to help dig out the root of the issue."
