I chose SLA this week cos i need a Kookie prism. But I'm gonna be so pissed if he comes to me from the shop.  If he comes to me like that, then all this effort would be for nothing. Cos SLA is a being an asshole for some reason. It's suddenly difficult to 3 star. Normally the ratio is 8:10. During this event, it's 2:10. 

Dalcom is making me work for it. I coulda chose an easier album and got some nice LE themes instead."

Then I found a tutorial on strategy alongside the games release of prism only card packs, and I became obsessed with collecting all high level cards. At the same time we had a crafting event. It was soul crushing to complete as a beginner but I got through it. 

It was a good thing too cos soon after SOTW was introduced.

BTSWorld,fdpdzwx,t3_emjkpt,1578626214.0,"‚Ä¢ As everyone said above, Netlify calculator. 

‚Ä¢ There is also a cheat sheet for affinity. Use it to get the best hearts from interactions (texts, incoming calls, card social media stuff). The higher the affinity, the further you go with AS (Another Story) 

‚Ä¢If you wanna complete the photo album, you can use the lock function to lock down the *(duplicates)* that are needed so you don't accidentally exchange them. You need duplicated for the albums. You have to own the card first and then have spares. 

---We, on the sub, recently discovered a hidden album that hasn't been released yet. You can look for the cards needed for this specific photo album in the inventory and manually lock them when you actually own them. 

‚Ä¢ But also, maximise your use of wings. Don't let the meter max for too long. You will lose out on free wings. 

Make sure you kinda track how much exp you have left till user level up. 

Because, when you level, your wings meter will max. And you wanna be at 0 before you level up. So that you can get as many wings as you possible can.   
  Did what I say make sense? In my head it doesn't lol. 


Basically. When you see you are about to level up. Try and use the auto - clear function, to use up ALL of your wings. That way, when they refill, you get the most. 

But say you have 28 wings and max is 30. And you level up. Then you only get an additional 2 wings. Whereas if you were at 0, you get additional 30 wings.

‚Ä¢ The further you go up in chapters for the main story, the better. You get more value for you wings when clearing high stages. Meaning, you get more blossoms. I'm pretty sure the stats are on here somewhere. 

‚Ä¢ Affinity/priority task. If gaining affinity is important to you to progress in Another Story, then you might need to refresh the agency schedule every hour until you get one. I used to set an alarm for this. Some days you'll get loads, other days you might not get any. But always be prepared for it. Make sure you have enough snacks for the boys so that they are not Red/hungry/angry."
