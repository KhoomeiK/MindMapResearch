AskWomen,fc6stnq,t3_eg7srq,1577488590.0,"I lost over 60 lbs a few years ago, and at the urging of family and friends, I purchased some age appropriate (i'm 37) and career appropriate clothing and shoes at the beginning of last year and changed up my wardrobe. So I went from looking like an extremely obese, overgrown angsty teen in 2015, to looking like a chubby, badass chick who has her life somewhat together in 2019.

Sadly, the biggest difference has been how much I get catcalled on the street. It increased drastically and it's super annoying. 

Another change is some of my guy friends became a little less comfortable around me. Like all of a sudden they realized that I wasn't ACTUALLY just one of the guys. I'm ok with this cuz it's less stinky this way. 

All the positive changes in the ways I'm treated I attribute to being in therapy and me being more confident in myself and presenting myself as someone who is worth being treated decently as opposed to the idea that people treat me better now because I'm prettier than I used to be.

AskReddit,fc3a0h0,t3_efvwzs,1577385075.0,"These aren't things that you conquer. These are things you learn how to manage and live with. Conquer makes it sound like someone can heal themselves through sheer force of will, and it just doesn't happen like that. 

Here is what has helped me manage mine:

- Regular visits with my therapist. 
- Taking my meds as prescribed and not letting them completely run out before getting them refilled.

- Make sure that my vitamin D levels aren't too low and that my thyroid hormones and blood sugar/A1C are in a normal range. All of which fuck with mood, especially the vitamin D (for me, at least).

- Try to stay on a somewhat normal sleep schedule and get at least 5 hours a night during the week.

- When struggling with anxious thoughts and OCD, I force myself to find the actual, hard evidence truth of the situation and shove aside the irrational, catastrophic, and intrusive thoughts. This took a lot of practice and time with my therapist (like over a year) before I was able to get to a spot where I could successfully do it by myself to get unstuck from a crazy ""anxiety loop"" in my brain. It's still faster when I have another person to help talk through it though and my mom and my best friend are really good at helping me sort out situations and divide between what's true, and what is clouded or distorted by my anxiety and OCD."

Bulldogs can get carried away pretty quickly when playing because they get easily fixated on things, like he did with her hair scrunchie. And when a bullie gets fixated on something, it can take a lot of effort to get them to leave it alone again. 

In defense of the girl on the floor, I play with my dogs by booping them on the nose or tapping their feet. My old bulldog knew that it was time to wrestle and would get riled up in a playful way when I start with the paw taps.
