So I've definitely gotten our money out of it. It used to be a $250 model here before they dropped the price to $130 (which is why I bought it lol).

Rolled over on bed aaand my water actually broke. I let out a few swearwords under my breath before alerting family we needed to enact plan baby.

Delivery was so fast that I had our second child out before he got to the airport at his end.

Did not want to go into labour without him at all but our baby boy decided to be as type a as I am and be early. If I could have kept that baby in place so my husband could have been there I would have. Instead I got my mother who stressed me the f out. C'est la vie."

Top tip: Any parents reading this.. tell your teacher to add books to their scholastic wishlist. Parents can see the list and buy the books. We're using our money (should we qualify) to buy the books off our son's teacher's list. The books go right to her and count towards her teacher's bonus points with scholastic.

This way Lapdog Lecce and his master (bator) Ford will be supporting the teachers one way or another."

If I'm going it's for medical help and advice and with the intention to listen to him.
