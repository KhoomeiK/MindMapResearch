Yes, the Zyrtec helped. 
We tried the Apoquel shot when it 1st came out at $99- but it didn't help at all. I wouldn't throw your $$ away on it, I would just try one Zyrtec daily. I get mine at Sam's Club and it runs $18 for over a years worth of pills, but I take and now my new pup Jack takes it too right now.  I found out that he's allergic to chicken and white potatoes.  Two of the main foods that dogs are allergic to.  I had Abbie and now him on Zignature Kangaroo and he's doing better.  Its just going to take another week before the chicken and potatoes get out of his system.

I know because I had mine tested for allergies. The allergist told me to try to find a Kangaroo based food and I found Zignature Kangaroo at couple of local stores and Chewy has it too. 
They have been on it for quite awhile and I've had no problems. 
For the grass allergy,  I give them Zyrtec daily and my yard man keeps the grass cut at the lowest level on his mower. 
If you can't find the Kangaroo,  I would go with a Lamb based food but be sure you check out the back label to make sure that it doesn't have chicken or white potatoes in it.
Also a good bath with a Hypoallergenic doggie soap would be good too. Your vet might tell you weekly until the pup heals up.
Another thing, cheap, bad dog food can do this too and maybe fleas.

Alzheimers,fdydaej,t3_en47lw,1578778533.0,"10th year for me. 
My husband was diagnosed in Oct 2009. 
He's been on Hospice care since July of this year. 
Bedridden since middle of Sept.  
He's at end of life with the Alzheimer's.  
In September,  they gave him 6mos..
Most of the time he doesn't know me, I know he doesn't know the kids or grandkids. He doesn't know where he is or anything. He's at a point where he sleeps most of the time so that's the easy part but the worst is when he just talks to people that aren't there. 
Mostly during the late afternoon and at night until about 1:30or 2:30a.m.. 
That's what I've been told is ""Sundowners Syndrome"". 
He can hardly turn over for me to change him 4-5 times a day and will barely open his mouth to eat or drink now. I have to give his pills to him with applesauce because he won't open his mouth. 
He's my 2nd husband so there are adult stepchildren involved. 
It's hard on me, my previous husband died of cancer. He was gone in 5 months. We were married 13yrs. 
With Sam, we've been married 22-1/2 yrs.. This disease is depressing, it's frustrating, it's confining for the caregiver.  Our livelihood has been cut in half. We just can't leave the house and go shopping, go see a movie, go get the oil changed in the car, go on vacation, somebody has to be here. 
To be relieved for 2hrs every 2wks is not enough. To have the patient go to Respite Care every 60 days is not enough.  It needs to be every month but Medicare won't pay for it.
It's just really worn me out, personally,  and I'll be glad when it's over cause I know that Sam would not want to live his life like this. 
Sorry, I ran on and on, but sometimes I just need to let it out and get all the frustration over with !!!!
I hate this disease!!!!"

u_jacksmom2019,fds7rar,t1_fdpen2u,1578696271.0,"The problem was that she was Auto Immune from almost dying from the Trifecxis flea pill that he gave her along with her yearly vaccinations in April 2013.  
Trifecxis killed a lot of dogs back in 2012 and 2013 until they took it off the market for awhile.  
There were several lawsuits. 
He gave her a Sulfur drug for a yeast infection. 
With the Auto Immune Disease she was prone to yeast infections and she was also allergic to grass. The grass wasn't a problem because my yard man kept it cut as short as possible. And she was on Zyrtec. 
He had never prescribed it before. 
She had a reaction in the first 48hrs and that's when I had to rush her back to the clinic. He wasn't there but one of the other vets where and he said that he never should have given her that with the disease. She had been in remission since 2014. We had to go to the emergency clinic for 4 days and nights.  Her Pac Cell count was 12.  They gave her a transfusion and that made it go to 18. Thursday morning we where dismissed with meds and to go to her regular doctor for monitoring. 
Thursday night they let me take her home and bring back for monitoring on Friday.  We go home Friday night and return on Saturday morning for monitoring.  Still holding.  So he thought she didn't need to be checked again until Tuesday.  So we got to come back home on Saturday and she crashed Sunday morning at 6:30am.
I sued him for negligence,  wrongful death and malpractice and we just settled in October.  I still cry over losing my baby, she was truly a mommy's baby and the love of my life."
puppy101,fds3xdp,t1_fdqyr8d,1578693869.0,"That sounds more reasonable to me. 
Don't give your puppy the heartworm pill or flea drops/pill until 2 weeks after he has the vaccines. This happened to my Abbie and it caused her to go into Auto Immune Hemolytic Anemia -4- days later due to too much poison going into her system. We almost lost her. She had to have a transfusion and then we had to take her to the emergency clinic and she had to stay a week.  I was glad I had just retired and could stay with her. It costs us $4500, but she was my baby.
With Jack now he got his vaccines one week and 2 weeks later I gave him his heartguard pill. Then 2 weeks after that,  I gave him his flea drops.
I still do this now every month. 
1- week heartguard,  2 weeks later, flea drops. I mark it on my calendar to keep up with it. He's now 13 months old.  This year when he goes for his check up, I will only get him what is necessary.  
I don't board him since he goes with me on vacation and I don't believe in ""over vaccination"".  Alot of that goes on now. Some vets want to give them everything,  they don't need all that."

Come to find out,  alot of dogs are allergic to chicken and white potatoes and grass. I have my yard guy cut the grass as short as possible on his mower and the allergist recommended that I feed them Zignature Kangaroo as it is good for allergic dogs.  I've done this since 2015 and have had no problems. 
I would take them completely off the chicken and check the back of the bag to see it it's got white potatoes in it too.

Then my brother and I had to set up another account in our names.
We  would then transfer his social security check monthly into our account and pay bills from it.
We didn't bother with changing the check to come to our checking. 
That would have been too much of a  government holdup in getting it done.

I really think that would be your best bet. All the bank will need is a copy of your POA.

He outlived my mom by 8yrs.
We had another brother that was taking advantage of him before we set up the separate accounts .
He would take dad to the bank and have him withdraw cash and that's why we would transfer money each month.
We didn't have to worry about it from there on because he had 7 strokes before he passed away. 
That's how I paid the nursing staff that sit with him while I still worked. 
That year in Aug.  2011, we had just moved him in with me and my husband because he had a serious kidney infection so we could care for him, his eyesight got bad, he wasn't eating properly and was afraid to drive after dark."
