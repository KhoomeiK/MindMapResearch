aww,ff8drh8,t3_es37jt,1579674259.0,Well this is it. I'm not eating chicken anymore either. Really running out of foods here.

houseplants,ff7a05y,t1_ff71jkn,1579644247.0,You should be good then!
houseplants,ff70gee,t3_erj8tx,1579638644.0,I don't think so:/ I looked this up and seems like too much light could also make the blooms green. But sounds like you're not doing that either.
houseplants,ff703sl,t1_ff6xhz2,1579638441.0,"Yeah you can definitely see it, but of course don't let it die from dehydration :)"
IndoorGarden,ff5khys,t3_er5km2,1579597235.0,Omg I just bought one today too and am so anxious. I already touched the soil like seventeen times to make sure it's not dry lmao
houseplants,ff5k18g,t3_ermy2x,1579596558.0,Mine does best in an east facing window. I only water her when she starts to look droopy. Hope this helps.
houseplants,ff5jvce,t3_eriapy,1579596331.0,"Do you water thoroughly? This might be because it needs to be watered more often, or more thoroughly. Don't miss any spots on the soil!"
houseplants,ff5jsqd,t3_erj8tx,1579596228.0,Are you talking about the flowers? They usually turn green if you over-fertilize.

plantclinic,ff5844b,t3_ermwbk,1579583024.0,"These plants are so sensitive to everything, at least for me. Mines' tips get like that when I let the soil dry too much between waterings. Also make sure to use only half strength fertilizer because overuse of fertilizer burns their tips too."

houseplants,fewmaol,t1_fevu319,1579414467.0,"It was definitely jade when I got it but idk about before that. I've heard that jade pothos is like the ""mother"" of all variegated types, and that's why when variegated ones don't get enough light they go back to jade. Mine gets a lot of light so maybe that's what's causing the variegation?"
