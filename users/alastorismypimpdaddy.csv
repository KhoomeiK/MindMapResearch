OnisionIsMassiveCuck,fel2o6w,t1_fekxdh5,1579212748.0,"You’re right as well. We are wasting our time and we aren’t getting paid, but, unlike media outlets, we have proof and evidence and our distaste for Greg is very justified. I could be doing something else right now, but keeping up to date with the investigation is just what I want to do. Greg won’t sway us, and comparing this to politics wont change our opinions.

I can tell he tried.

Whether or not somebody likes trump (personally, I’m not a fan) shouldn’t be a factor on how we see Greg. Any functioning adult (or really ANYBODY with a mature enough brain) can see that what Greg is doing is wrong, and how pathetic he looks. Politics nor the environment have anything to do with pedophilia, molestation, rape, sexual abuse, etc. and that’s that. 

These 13 year old, on the other hand, probably don’t even know what *pathetic* is, most of them don’t see the red flags. They’ve never experienced it before and they don’t get “the talk” about it, so they don’t know what’s wrong and what’s right. I just HATE how Greg thought it to be okay to manipulate this innocence of a child. I’m still a child (16F) but I’m smart enough to know that having sex with, sexting or making sexual remarks towards 12 and 13 year olds is absolutely fucking disgusting."
OnisionIsMassiveCuck,fekuups,t1_feku5bo,1579208069.0,"Something I didn’t mention before- he is also hiding behind current news such as the Australian wild fires, and saying that they are more important and need to be talked about, while he is completely taking the focus away from his accusations (he didn’t mention them at all). 

Not saying that the forest fires don’t deserve attention, they do, but he’s hiding behind them"
OnisionIsMassiveCuck,fekul3w,t1_feku5bo,1579207912.0,"Also, I think it’s good to look more into the situation. Trump is president so media from America, Canada, Mexico, Britain, France, Russia and everywhere else on this world have probably reported on Trump. Trump gets reported on and spoken about by EVERY media sight, or at least most.

Greg, on the other hand, doesn’t at all get as much media attention as Trump. He just gets YouTube, Reddit, Insta, and a few other sights of media. And he complains and compares his goddamn situation to the presidents? I just don’t understand what went through his mind. I honestly have to rewatch it.

And I 100% believe Greg was hiding behind some politics to gain support and sympathy from like the 3 people who still like him."
OnisionIsMassiveCuck,fekt5q0,t1_fekskwg,1579207072.0,"I listened to about half of his [hi](https://youtu.be/5teGUQcPTlQ) video and about 5 minutes of his [hi again](https://youtu.be/dVXcYacFHJY) video. And that is exactly what he does.

He is making himself seem innocent. I believe in his hi again video, he tries and fails to compare himself to president trump. Basically, to sum it up, he says that Trump doesn’t like media because the media lies, and media is victimizing himself like what the media does to Trump.

The next bit is a major IMO: 

I say that he failed to compare himself and his situation to Trump because the evidence against Greg is all right there, and we aren’t bending the evidence to make him look bad. IMO Greg just wanted some sympathy from his fans and he wants them to hate the people who see him for who he is. He brought in politics for show, and make himself sound smarter than he is. You should watch the video it’s pretty pathetic."

OnisionIsMassiveCuck,feffo12,t3_eovu5f,1579055335.0,"1. Greg created disgusting videos even 5 years ago, such as *[Why Do I Have Vaginal Discharge](https://youtu.be/fHzjfl_WafM), [How To Give A Hickey](https://youtu.be/VRZNBVPgleI), [How Fat Is Too Fat](https://youtu.be/R9dOcwjBLiw) and [Problems Growing Up Thick](https://youtu.be/1thNPW3iSSM). Firstly, all of those titles are absolutely massive red flags that can’t be ignored. He always knew that his audience was a bunch of young kids, so why would he make a video about vaginal discharge? 

There were so many red flags that we ignored. This could have been stopped years ago but none of us recognized the red flags. I think that we should be on the look out for shady and mysterious activity so that no other YouTuber can be able to do this in the future. 

2. All of his most popular videos spanned from 2013 - 2015, which is arguably the height of his YouTube career. Once the shit with his wife started at around late 2015 to early 2016, his videos got less and less popular. I remember leaving Greg’s fanbase at around 2016 (I was 13). I’m glad I did.
