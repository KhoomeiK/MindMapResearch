I realized I couldn’t outrun it, but thought maybe I could stun it long enough to get away. So I ducked behind a shelf, grabbed the biggest book I could reach, and smacked the damn bird right in its stupid beak. 

Well back in the real world, I had apparently just backhanded my wife in the face. Hard enough that my hand hurt. She was not at all amused, and my groggy ”I’m sorry... I thought you were an ostrich” did not help matters much."
