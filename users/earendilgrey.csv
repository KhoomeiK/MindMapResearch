My handwriting has never been amazing but after getting a bone cyst removed from my account writing hand a few years ago I have been on an ever evolving journey to get it back to were it was.

Cloververse,fdrqw05,t3_emk28f,1578688263.0,The trailers always gave me a Leviathan/Abyss/Deep Star Six vibes at first.  I wonder if this was meant to be a Clover prequel and the flop that Paradox was had them changing it to generic monster flick in a bid to move away from the hate Paradox got.
