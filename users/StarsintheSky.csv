LV426,ffakhnm,t3_escz5a,1579737995.0,Well this is coming along nicely!
TerrainBuilding,febzg1f,t3_eo6zqb,1578964555.0,I like your craft but I looooove your depth of field! Nice choice on the flocking; springy and exciting.
HelpMeFind,fe7ms8f,t1_fe4xn00,1578916641.0,Thanks for the sagulator link. I didn't know I needed this wizard until today.
witcher,fe4hgoh,t1_fe3z7oy,1578859354.0,"Even my darling ashen-haired daughter! But, apparently, there's a dialogue option with Ciri where she says that her face scar was so distracting that she started leaving her shirt open another button so people would have something else to look at."
TerrainBuilding,fe4ebf7,t1_fe44y4r,1578858394.0,That's what I thought of first. I suppose these wouldn't be as tough as pasta.
AskMen,fdfv0kh,t1_fddv13v,1578370942.0,"That's reserved for youth pastors who can play a handful of chords on their guitar and tuck their plaid Sunday shirts into too-tight, straight-leg, unfaded jeans."
TerrainBuilding,fd7cjmu,t3_ejygbu,1578202375.0,"Oh I love it! I want a whole board of terrain in this verdant, dripping palette of mosses and undergrowth! Forget rocky steppes, forget winter wastelands, this is the setting I was meant to play in!"
witcher,fczj154,t1_fcx6spf,1578102314.0,This was bothering me until I remembered: [Ivana Baquero in the Shannara Chronicles](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051220/mediaviewer/rm4177338368)!
witcher,fcziisn,t1_fcy76b4,1578101997.0,"Also, as assassination goes, that skillset would be handy against monsters like Dopplers and Higher Vampires where burliness is not necessarily required if one can navigate social circles and humanoid cities and towns. While she might be toast in a bare fist brawl, who better to infiltrate a vampire's harem and strike in a moment of weakness?"
LV426,fczfruz,t1_fcysgln,1578100277.0,Rad is absolutely the right word! That's wild!
UnethicalLifeProTips,fcxyaj5,t1_fcxxnak,1578072123.0,Roger that. Thanks for explaining.
AskMen,fcxy1vt,t1_fcxx01o,1578072080.0,Front pocket! I've worked hard to keep my wallet as thin as possible so that this is possible.
AskReddit,fcxxdr7,t1_fcxubni,1578071780.0,"I put this through Google translate and what came out is very broken and hard to understand. So, a very accurate translation of the source material. :)"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fcxwifs,t1_fcxqiyz,1578071467.0,"Be careful with this one. My understanding has always been that you need a documented record of your religious convictions that would clearly define you as a conscientious objector. At least, that's how it was explained to me in 2005. I was encouraged to write some reflections describing my opposition to violence and to keep these on file with my church where leaders who had worked with me could vouch for their truth. It never sounded like I could just check the box that said ""\[ X \] Non-combat, please""."
LV426,fcxviu6,t1_fcxv22n,1578071111.0,Do you have any sort of mounting or diorama planned for the figure? Some intentional lighting? Using translucent Sculpey for the top layer sounds fantastic. I admit I've never seen the stuff in use before but I can imagine how it would create the perfect effect! I hope you keep us updated!
LV426,fcxu34o,t3_ejgmnb,1578070503.0,"This looks like about 4"" tall, is that right? Excellent start!"
witcher,fcxod33,t1_fcxnqih,1578067698.0,"Story, of course! I'm in the ""wrapping up"" stage of my playthrough so it's lots of monster nests and bandit camps so very combat heavy."
witcher,fcwcmdl,t1_fcvyd9e,1578022303.0,"At level 83 NG+ I absolutely still avoid wolf packs as I'm traveling. There was a thread on a DnD subreddit recently about how this dungeon master likes to run ""gritty realism"" campaigns and thinks that, to the genericly medieval character, a pack of wolves should be terrifying and highly lethal. Must be a Witcher fan!"
witcher,fcwa433,t1_fcw86kw,1578020646.0,"This is a huge game. I'm something of a completionist and my first playthrough was close to 200 hours. **However!** the pacing of the main quest lines is often very high intensity and I would imagine it's more like a 20-60 hour game if you stay focused on them and don't explore too much. In fact, I found it difficult to stray from the main quests because the story is so gripping and urgent that I didn't really feel right exploring and taking it easy until I had reached some milestones in them."
witcher,fcw9ct6,t3_ej03w3,1578020142.0,I'd love if we could get a cosmetic armor slot. There are so many sweet Relic pieces but I need my Witcher school bonuses!
witcher,fcw996a,t1_fctmnpr,1578020074.0,When they start talking about Sodden that changed the whole atmosphere for me. I couldn't remember quite what happened in the books but I knew >!that a lot of people were about to die horrifically!< and all I could do was hang on to something.
witcher,fcw90gh,t1_fcrjgqk,1578019913.0,"""The Tax Man Cometh"" quest asked some very uncomfortable questions of me like: ""Have you ever stolen anything?"" Well, it's hard to say exactly whether all those barrels and crates were owned by anyone in particular, right?"
witcher,fcw8qnz,t1_fculhg2,1578019731.0,"Mine isn't planning to play because she doesn't really do games, but after we finished the Netflix series she expressed that she is **eagerly awaiting** the second season which was pretty surprising to me as she has been totally uninterested in Game of Thrones. Another point for the WiedÅºmin!"
witcher,fcw71g2,t3_eili2k,1578018619.0,"I thought I was about 90% done with quests and I left the last 20-30 for Skellige and Touissant. When I fast traveled to Skellige to ""wrap up"" I zoomed out on the map and saw that, no, I have multiple new (!)Quests to start and (?)POIs all over the map, still. I second your suggestion that Skellige feels like a major expansion not just another region!"
witcher,fcw43y0,t1_fcw11sj,1578016699.0,"It's called ""Whirl"" and it's a light attack unlock on the skill tree. I played a vicious toxicity build that relies on stacking decoctions to boost damage output per toxicity level then hit super hard with Rend on individuals and Whirl for crowds. This was a nice changeup after my first playthrough on a signs-heavy build."
witcher,fcw3p4y,t1_fcvfmn4,1578016427.0,Playing Deathmarch I turned off all the enemy meta-info because it became largely unimportant. That improved my experience quite a bit because it cut down on my meta-gaming. Follow the level guidelines for the quests and just expect everything to one/two-shot you and you'll be fine.
AskReddit,fcvzl2q,t1_fcvefai,1578013711.0,I put off my first shave for a realllly long time because of this myth!
todayilearned,fcvzcz0,t1_fcvleee,1578013563.0,"Don't forget the Amish Mafia!
I looked up ""Amish Hauntings"" and nearly died reading the tagline: ""Chilling ghost stories from the Amish community guaranteed to drive one buggy."""
todayilearned,fcvz4j0,t1_fcvi72d,1578013408.0,I think you may have misunderstood my intent with the original comment. These were false understandings of the Amish tradition that I overheard from a third party. I'm suggesting that the general public has a mythical understanding of that community not that their own traditions are things of mythology.
minipainting,fcvdbay,t1_fcv9fu0,1577999710.0,"Liquitex has one, Golden has one. You can get these from Amazon. It looks like Hobby Lobby and Michaels both have a generic gloss acrylic medium. Mine is from Golden and it was a promotional size tube which you might struggle to find. I would have a hard time using a whole 8oz bottle but who knows what all you might be able to use it on?"
minipainting,fcv8iwg,t1_fcv4dea,1577996861.0,"Cheers for the masking! That can be a pretty heroic venture on a complex model. Here's a pro-tip: I have a small bottle of ""gloss medium"" (just like matte medium) that I use for exactly this. Dullcoat the whole mini then recoat with gloss medium with a brush just where you want it."
todayilearned,fcv4kfq,t1_fcv1nx1,1577994513.0,"I live in Amish country. The other day I overheard some very interesting revelations about their customs! /s

Allegedly, Rumspringa happens every year for every one in the Amish community and they are not allowed to have dolls with faces because the dolls will steal their souls.

I think it's interesting how this community has entered the realm of myth in so many ways."
minipainting,fcv2lgj,t3_ej08w3,1577993346.0,I like the satin/gloss. Are you planning to keep it that way? What part did you struggle with the most?
TerrainBuilding,fcv223q,t3_eizyov,1577993023.0,Woah. How did you get it to grow with each step? ;) Looks great!
TerrainBuilding,fcuvaeh,t1_fcut010,1577989259.0,I'm a little weary of all the winter and grimdark terrain so I've personally been working hard to keep my terrain verdant and lush. Examples like yours are good encouragement!
mycology,fcuqpio,t3_eizs3o,1577986570.0,This is very spooky. Makes my imagination run! Thanks for sharing!
TerrainBuilding,fcukpd4,t3_eiyn4q,1577983159.0,This is great! What are you using for flocking? The yellow is not what I'm used to but it's growing on me.
minipainting,fcsv6s9,t1_fcrcnfd,1577925933.0,"I had great success painting undiluted Mod Podge onto 3D-printed stone columns to fill in the layer lines. On a small, highly detailed object this would have muddied the detail but for a 3"" stone column it worked quite well."
collapse,fcr0hgi,t3_eiiadk,1577894964.0,"I'm struggling to understand the scale of all this. I've seen some videos from on the ground, I've seen maps of fire locations, but reading descriptions like this it feels like the whole country is burning to the ground. Do you have a ""Safe Zone"" where everyone can go? Is there normal life still going on somewhere near you?"
Plumbing,fcpg68t,t1_fcp3qsj,1577862544.0,Even the water supply to the toilet!
Cyberpunk,fcn626y,t3_ehyr53,1577804223.0,"This is like Jin Roh Wolf Brigade goes Gobi Desert. Excellent characters, superb realization. I'd love to see more of these guys!"
TerrainBuilding,fcapp77,t1_fcaoxmb,1577574101.0,I had dreams once of adding thin sheet steel below roofs and under slopes so that minis with magnets in their bases could stick to any angle/slope but so far I can't be bothered.
TerrainBuilding,fcaoj8e,t3_egx5g6,1577573395.0,Block construction is sooo tedious but the results are often excellent. I like the details on the posts at the ends of the bridge. Is the rise of the bridge shallow enough for models to stand on the slope?
Calligraphy,fcans34,t1_fcallvd,1577572931.0,"My wife was a prolific walnut ink maker last winter. (Don't make the mistake of waiting til the snow is on the ground to go hunting for nuts!) She simmered the hulls in a secondhand slow cooker then strained and concentrated the juice. She found the oven to work fairly well for dehydrating the concentrate. Then she ground the flakes and reconstituted with water and gum arabic. She also found that dollar store loose eye shadow powder (mica-based) makes a lovely rich gold-brown ink. Happy ink-making! And I hope you like the smell of walnuts if you have to stew them inside. :)

EDIT: freeze drying the concentrate had a really cool effect that made the resulting powder extremely hydrophilic. We found this out after forgetting a batch in the freezer for 6 months."
Calligraphy,fcakobv,t3_eglyd3,1577571091.0,Where did you get the ink? Did you make it? The lettering looks great.
AskReddit,fca2gxx,t1_fc9j20h,1577562073.0,"You should check out ""Rosin Eating Zombies from Outerspace"". There's a lovely bar where the strings all saw vigorously on the G strings on the wrong side of the bridge. Here is a YouTube link: [Alfred Music Orchestra, 1:30 in](https://youtu.be/dWYR7eP98_4?t=90) Hold your breath for the 1:37 mark :)"
minipainting,fc206fh,t1_fc0tzr2,1577335359.0,"I saw the rack of 40K assassins in my local game shop recently listing for $25 each! A single, standard sized humanoid mini with no bonus parts for $25 is crazy! I bought a Culexus mini in pewter 15 years ago and I'm sure I didn't pay more than $9."
nextfuckinglevel,fc1woxd,t3_efmjif,1577332036.0,"My wife just asked me the other day whether Rick Rolling was still a thing. Can confirm: yes, and also, her tablet happily read the QR code through my monitor. Thanks for sharing and keeping the dream alive!"
TerrainBuilding,fbyy3l6,t3_ef2fh0,1577229496.0,"Pro-tip: I don't have a hot wire cutter because it's a luxury/hobby tool. I do, however, have a table saw because I've needed it for quite a few home renovation projects. I don't know if you're in that part of the DIY circle, but it works quite well for me. The mess that ripping the foam boards makes is nearly apocalyptic but it makes a nice smooth cut without melting the faces. Maybe you've got a friend with a table saw and you could rip a bunch of material to common sizes?"
