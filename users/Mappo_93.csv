relationships,feqruhd,t3_eq81ow,1579345300.0,"Not an overreaction whatsoever. I went through something recently and when I reached out to a friend for help, they blew me off even though I had helped them through their problems and they said they would help me no matter what. It put things in perspective for me in where I stand with that person.

This should put things in perspective. You needed your boyfriend. You asked for comfort and he not only blew you off, he ignored you while you were in distress. Will he always do this if you need him? You deserve much, much better."

AmItheAsshole,fem80oz,t3_epnbxq,1579243087.0,"NAH, I can understand the conflicted feelings. Honestly the update though, give them time and send a message just to say you want to support them and you weren't trying to be rude, but the reason you weren't enthusiastic was because you are sad that your gf's father is gone, not because you couldn't go to the wedding."
AmItheAsshole,fejw5jm,t3_epirbk,1579187231.0,"YTA. You came on here to basically get a group of online strangers to gang up on your girlfriend because she's upset YOU strong armed her into an abortion. Your comments are defensive as hell and you telling HER parents she was pregnant crossed the line, you did it to try and strong arm her into the abortion, stop the bullshit saying otherwise. That should have been her choice to tell her parents. 

You seem to think abortion is a magical cure all, it takes a toll and clearly your girlfriend hasn't had the support since."
BeautyGuruChatter,fej9r0z,t1_fej1hw0,1579163127.0,I mean JS said the same about KVD being a brand w***e as well. I think the biggest problem is trying to get through to these sort of people because they take it as a personal attack rather than people for pointing out how these items are made.
HumansBeingBros,fei367d,t1_fefupbr,1579129258.0,"Australian here, pretty much every state has a recycling policy for bottles and cans. While the plastic bottles are an issue, in a bushfire emergency where people literally only have the clothes on their backs left, plastic bottles are the only ones they have."
TrueOffMyChest,fei1umh,t3_ep2zdf,1579128445.0,"When it's someone you care about, time won't erase the loss or the sadness, it only gives you better ways to cope and handle it. I lost my Nan to cancer and my Grandad to a heart attack when I was young (10 and 13) and I still cry sometimes over it. 

It's good to let the grief out sometimes. Bottling it up does harm to ourselves."
JUSTNOMIL,fei1ff1,t3_ep449w,1579128189.0,"Remember, you don't need to justify your decision to ANYONE if you don't want to. I know in a lot of these situations people try to push for gossip. If you don't want to add to it, don't feel pressured to.

AmItheAsshole,fduus1b,t3_en26md,1578739162.0,"NTA, 10-2 is middle of the day, not early whatsoever and you let her know you had to leave by 9:30, her time management isn't your problem and she needs to realise not everyone can run on a flexible schedule. 

I also hate this but to add on to it, when they say they are leaving soon, when is soon? Is it within 30 minutes? Or when it's a open ended time frame. Just give a time frame of between these set hours for fucks sake."

When I was 18, a person I knew of died in a car accident, the car behind them blinded them and he crashed head on into a tree. Just because you're safe, doesn't mean anyone else is. If that driver was doing the right thing, that guy would be here today.

That could have been your daughter. The lack of concern from her mother is alarming."
AskReddit,fdt06og,t1_fdsl4f8,1578710222.0,"I was sure some of the animals were taken out of the zoo, not sure if it was all. I spoke with a girl who knew some of the keepers there and it hit pretty close to home for her. Maybe I misread it though."
AskReddit,fdszw88,t1_fdspohu,1578710110.0,"Holy shit, hit the nail on the head! Although it may have been oysters because we couldn't get all the shell out. My mum always said to never swim under the bridge for that reason but I was with dad and typical dad was like 'yeah go ahead'. Cue me swimming under the bridge and when I finally got out of the water, I saw the trail of blood and wailed. Mum immediately knew what happened and now I have a sort of feather shaped scar on my right knee. 

I loved the book store and pottery store. I was a bookworm growing up and would read anything I put my hands on. I kind of feel empty now its gone. I haven't been back in a while, but Batemans Bay and Mogo have always felt like home to me.

Have you heard anything about Mogo primary school? We haven't seen or heard if it's still standing. That and I think it's the trading post? That was the store that I always thought was the fairy store. My friend and I used to go in there all the time!"

relationship_advice,fds8uxy,t3_emu16i,1578696999.0,"I empathise with you, I broke my hymen myself with a toy when I was in my early 20s and honestly I count that as my first time because I was able to control what happened. If I didn't like something, I could try new ways to fix it. But my first experience with a guy? Very disappointing and somewhat painful. I bled after. After sex he actually played 'I just had sex'. Not joking. We were both in our 20s. 

If you want to try again with this guy, it's time to communicate, tell him how hurt you felt that he declared you not a virgin, and how it makes it seem that was your only worth to him. If you decide to try having sex again, take a bit of time. Explore each other and learn what each other likes. A woman's first time shouldn't be painful but it happens. Being more turned on will help you enjoy it more. Either that or have a check with a gyno or a doctor. There are reasons you could be in pain during sex but I don't want you to panic or self diagnose. Try finding what you like and if you still find there's pain, definitely speak to someone.

Good luck OP, and it will be okay."

AskReddit,fds23qr,t3_emvveb,1578693167.0,"I used to live in Batemans Bay and Mogo as a child. On New Years Eve and New Years Day, I spent the whole day crying or in a rage. Watching the place I loved burn devastated me. I have trouble remembering bits of my childhood, but I'll always remember living only 5 minutes away from the most beautiful beaches, a bridge I once swam under and now have the permanent scar as a reminder, our local fish and chips shop where I always picked out the ring lolly. There was this shop I called the fairy shop (keep in mind these coastal areas were quite tourist-y) and I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's gone now. At least the Mogo zoo was evacuated.

I'm tired and I'm scared and I'm safe but I know so many others aren't. I'm angry because the bare minimum was not done by state or federal parliament and we've lost so much. Children growing up without their Dads, elderly dying because they couldn't escape, a father and son caught in the blaze, animals dying by the hundreds of millions if not billions and a prime minister who has the nerve to smirk in his people's faces when they are trying to convey their grief. 

I'm sorry for the rambling, just been so angry and upset.

Edit to add: I have comments on other threads if anyone else is interested in donating to help our wildlife caught in the fires, or should I say fire. It's merged into one. Fuck."

Australia Zoo is also taking in injured wildlife, I'm not sure if you 'adopt' them, but they are a good one to donate to, they also have a system if you're donating overseas and a dedicated wildlife hospital.

Another is a lady who runs the page my sister's keeper who is raising money to buy the proper respirators for firefighters. She delivers 99% of them herself and has videos showing her doing it if you're concerned where the money is going (heaps of scams going around unfortunately)
