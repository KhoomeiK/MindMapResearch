insaneparents,fec6kaz,t1_fec5mtb,1578967499.0,"Fuck that. I definitely wouldn't make my teenage, high school attending, kid pay to live at home (where there supposed to fucking live). I was giving half my paycheck to him. But here's the kicker....he's barely worked a day in his life. He can't read or write, he dropped out in 8th grade and my great Granmda paid for everything he ever had and any bills he had. My grandparents raised me and paid for my upbringing. He was too busy getting fucked up all the time when I was younger. So basically I was just giving him free money."

I quit after a month because he expected me to pay rent. I was 16 and worked part time at Bojangles. I went to work, quit, and got a ride back to my grandparents (they lived behind him). My grandpa was a little mad that I quit my job until I told him the situation. His response ""Well, I've had to raise you and buy everything for you since birth so why stop now (he was joking with me and we laughed about it). My dad made a comment later on in front of my grandpa about being pissed I quit. My grandpa shut him down with the quickness."

I was forced to live with my bio-mom for a couple of years. I moved back home in High School and lots of people were surprised to see me. Apparently everyone thought I had died, even though I still had like two childhood friends I would see sometimes when I visited my Dad's on the weekends those couple of years. Coincidentally one of my friends from the middle school I attended, which was over an hour away, ended up in my hometown/high school....so that was cool"
