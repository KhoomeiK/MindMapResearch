A tomahawk cruise missile is $1.5m, a remote launch system/platform could probably be had for $0.5m, which would leave you with $1m profit.  Or you could get a half dozen hellfire missiles for $0.7m and launch them simultaneously from different sites.  Hard to take down that many guided warheads in a populated urban setting.

$3m gets you a lot of serious ordinance."

A bracketed tax system, like we already have, would enact a wealth tax something like the following:

1% tax on wealth over $1,000,000

2% tax on wealth over $10,000,000

3% tax on wealth over $100,000,000

4% tax on wealth over $1,000,000,000

5% tax on wealth over $10,000,000,000

6% tax on wealth over $100,000,000,000
