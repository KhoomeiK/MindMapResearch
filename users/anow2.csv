Bro, this isn't Walmart. These are Research and Development departments of giant companies. Why would they hire employees in the first place if they weren't going to be able to use it? How do you think we would progress through technology at all if it wasn't for some type of model for funding?  


Are you suggesting these scientists should quit their jobs, quit making money, quit learning, quit growing their professional fame, just because ""hey man, if I make something with someone elses resources I should keep it""  


Just curious, how old are you? Seems like the opinion of a idealistic teen."

Hate to burst your bubble, but Elon has more experience and knowledge than likely any of those kids, or professors will ever attain.  


Not exactly the best sample to base your opinion off of. This is coming from someone who went to business school - where a good percentage are people who just don't know what they want to do in their life, and many of which have no real talent - they are just preparing for a lifetime of desk work drudgery."

Regardless, man is funny, hard working, and doing way more than you'll ever do to improve the Quality of Life for millions - if not eventually billions.

I'm sorry his ex-wife is upset that her billionaire husband moved on - does he not have the right to live his own life?  I'm sorry he gets a little bit of an ego - who wouldn't after 18 hour days and being critiqued for trying to help (You know he won that court case, btw, right?).Would you not have an ego if you cut the cost of space travel by tenfold? Would you not have an ego if you were the first person to start up a new successful automobile company in decades? Would you not have an ego if you literally paved the way for ecommerce and online payments?

As for being upset at him for being born rich - what is wrong with you? Was he supposed to curl up in a hole and die? Do you want rich people to stop contributing to the world? What kind of bottom of the barrel ad-hominem bullshit are you trying to pull off?

There are people to critique for being born rich, but a man who dedicated his life to his work? Come on."

Musk cannot take credit, and must forfeit all profits to said employees.
