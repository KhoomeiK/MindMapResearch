AskReddit,fekzkv7,t3_epj100,1579210887.0,"Dominions 5 is notable to me because it's this weird turn based strategy game that plays like this crazy 4x Dungeons and Dragons title with 3 ages, dozens of distinct civilizations, hundreds of gods, spells, units, and items. You set up your armies in fairly basic formations at the start of the game, typically swordsmen in front, archers behind, and cavalry scripted to attack the enemy rear. All actions are scripted before battle. 

Later on instead of blood and steel you summon world ending undead, nigh-invulnerable angels, powerful Djinn, demons, devils, and all manner of creatures. Mages sling fireballs and lightning bolts while the greatest of them emit apocalypse level destruction on the battlefield, killing hundreds or thousands within mere minutes.

I currently resided in a house with multiple HoH for benefits purposes. This is not related to filing taxes. This is not related to filing for FAFSA. This is soley for SNAP - which is separate.


Now to clarify, I do not 100% know what they would do to verify the information but I imagine looking at your taxes is the first thing they would do. Now does that make what I said accurate? No idea. But in exchange for a $72,000 education, missing out on $2000 in taxes seems worth it."

AskReddit,fecq8gs,t1_fecp395,1578980655.0,"Ooof for awhile I thought I gave some incorrect information but than I kinda realized why this works. 

You are not using traditional financial aid routes. You are working through SNAP, as SNAP has it's own dedicated education program set up to get people the hell OFF snap.

That's where the grants come from. I think about $12000 a year comes from a grant specific to this program and more comes out of my PELL and a few cooperative college funds. I have to look at the financial aid package again. I tried to make sense of it a bunch but the college isn't the best at disclosure sometimes. (for me it's 3 semesters of $8000 over 3 years, so $24000/year using the college/SNAP grant, SNAP, PELL, etc. all combined)

You don't really work with FASA as you, as a 21 year old, are a default dependent even if you have dirt bag parents (not your mom, just as an example) so the government doesn't really care there.

The government cares if you're on SNAP, and it's easier to beat or ""qualify"" for SNAP than it is for financial aid.

PM me your state and city and I could dive into where you would get started. Than it's about convincing mom about the tax issue. And why I suggested not being classified as a dependent. If you were just going to college and applying for financial aid normally you wouldn't qualify. 

Come April if a new law passes you'll need a 20/hr a week job to meet new SNAP requirements, but honestly it's still worth it for a $44,000-64,000 education.

Being an active college student, probably not much my advice will do. But for anyone not started, I could probably give them enough advice to get into a program as long as I knew their city and state."

When the kid hits 18, don't claim him on your taxes. He is no longer a dependent. Why would you pass up up to $2000 on taxes? Because now he's his own person, an independent adult. One who can now apply for benefits. There ARE government programs to put you through school for free. Many of these are, as previously mentioned, being abused by rich kids whose parents definitely have the means to put them through school. They are aware of the system, and how to play it to their advantage. Something the middle and lower class don't like to do, and even feel ashamed of doing. Don't.

Now that the 18 year old is eligible for benefits, he can apply for SNAP ($200/month for food) as well as gain full eligibility to PELL grant among others. SNAP itself is the real prize, because SNAP programs typically have college placement for degree eligible courses.

I am currently pursuing an associates in human services, fully paid for by the government. I don't owe a dime. 

If you want more information or to actively pursue obtaining a government paid for education, I would be happy to go into detail with you sometime over how to exactly manage this. (or you know, ask the coworker and I would give you an email they could hit me up at).




Edit: This is getting a lil popular and here's some points to clarify.

This has nothing to do with FAFSA. Anyone under 24 is considered a dependent as far as the government is concerned with students. This is SNAP - and SNAP has it's own education programs that once you are enrolled in will cover expenses. A lot more people qualify for SNAP than realize it, and for a lot of people under the age of 24 can still qualify for SNAP and work through THEM for financial aid, FAFSA be damned. (you still fill one out and go through hoops but the program takes all expenses it can from traditional routes and plugs the rest with program funds).

Check your social services website.

That's it with my replies for a bit, as I have to go to school tomorrow. Again, not everyone can use this. Mostly for low income and older workforce, but the reason I even mentioned it in this thread to begin with was because of the rich kids I also see in this program who have no right to be here. So I figured telling people to look into it wouldn't hurt. Good luck to everyone - SNAP does in fact have many educational opportunities."

Absolutely, 100% true. However most of the time you're probably not even asking that. You're asking why people didn't vote for Hillary. Then conflating those reasons to say a group of people are pro-Trump, who never have been and never will. 

Where it comes down to the Democratic party, Debbie WS and her lackeys did everything they could to sabotage Bernie, then expected democrats to be happy about that turn of events and to support her and Hillary. They were snakes through and through. But Hillary supporters can't seem to grasp the concept that people won't bend over backwards to support that woman.

It's not that I'm not down to share, it's the idea of the item disappearing and me having to come to terms it's gone after having thought about it. That sucks. That, and having a brand new never opened item you just bought and the next time you see it, it's opened. At least let *me* be the first to tap it, come on."

That was your chance right there to troll some people, subvert expectations, but also possibly set up a halfway decent story too.
