But these days I'm a little stronger. Except today, I had a meltdown. Primarily because I was feeling guilt for the consequences he's currently facing, because I made the phone call.

BUT, he made his choices. I made mine. I'm not sure what the lesser of two evils is. I do know I don't deserve that life. Neither does he, but he's not ready to change. And I can't force him to."

stopdrinking,femzov4,t3_epqk1x,1579273681.0,"I see a few comments on here. And my heart hurts for both of you. I've been sober almost 2 and a half years. My now ex, unfortunately didn't want that life.

He hurt me....actually I allowed him to hurt me. Because I didn't want to abandon him. I wanted him to see everything I saw in him. I love him very much & know I did not deserve any of what he put me through. But ya know what? Even on the days, I wish he'd understand my pain & that the choices I made were out of love, and tell me he's sorry. You know what's most important to me?

His sobriety, him finding peace & healing from all the things that hurt him. All the things that haunt him. Forgiveness for himself. He deserves it. 

Because I can only imagine the amount of pain he's in to drown out the world & hurts others the way he does. And that hurts me to know he suffers, but I had to walk. 

We all have done fucked up things, due to unhealed wounds, that we didn't want to address. 
It is our responsibility to take accountability of those things & figure out why we did them.

Darlin, you might not feel like it, but let that shame/guilt/pain give you your power back toward living a better life. You DO NOT have to pay for your mistakes the rest of your life, BUT you DO have to address/acknowledge all the uncomfortable feelings of the things that you've done & the root cause of those things. 

You deserve peace too. IWNDWYT"

You do not have to apologize. My Q used to tell me all the time he hadn't been drinking.....when he was obviously intoxicated.

He just hid the bottles in new/better spots. Part of his journey of sobriety should include acknowledging his own behaviors that created the environment. This is a wonderful alcoholic behavior of ""I don't have the problem, you do""

He's still manipulating."

The highlight reels I post are generally about my anxiety, the struggle with sobriety, and some of my past that haunts me, not the pretty bits. 
Sometimes I am wearing leggings, they're comfy when my stomach is bloated, though. 

I got stuck in the comparison game bad during my first year sober when I was cheated on. 

Now I'm more accepting of myself. And others, but if I get a faint whiff of fake juju, I don't associate with that person. Not outta judgment, but we're on different paths."

And I could have made the choice to drink. And it would have 100% been my choice. 

When we seek permission for certain things, essentially we're asking to elevate guilt associated with our actions. And then we don't have to carry the burden & drown ourselves more, because guess what?! They said it was ok.

AlAnon,fdpfprs,t3_eml0pl,1578627438.0,"I'm sorry darlin. I want to hug you. Towards the last few months, I would have to leave my Qs son with him, while I went to work. 

I always explained to him (Qs son) tell daddy if someone comes to the door, because I was never sure if he'd be passed out. 

Or the night he came in the room to wake me up, because his dad was choking on his vomit. I started telling him to turn daddy's head a certain way if it happened again. He just turned 5 last month. 

I was accused of trying to have his son taken away from him. He'd get on me about how I parent my 2. But then I realized it's projections of his own insecurities & fears. 

It's tiring. You deserve safety & to feel like your child is safe when you aren't there."

AlAnon,fdn86sl,t3_em5l41,1578579899.0,"This is gaslighting. 
Also, at 5, she is way more aware of what's going on then he thinks. My (ex) Qs son just started noticing dad's behavior is not normal, before he turned 5 this Dec. My kids 7 & 11 are also aware it's not normal behavior.

This maybe an unpopular opinion, but I myself am in recovery, & do not believe relapse is part of the process. If I relapse, it's because I choose too & also, means I have not or am not truly working on my triggers.

My dad has also been sober 31 years this coming February. No relapses. 

I can think all day long, maybe I can go back to drinking or have a few, but the risks outweigh the temporary pleasure."

Not drinking, being honest with yourself, with others, processing those uncomfortable/shitty feelings.

And guess what your daughter will grow up with a great present dad in her life.

I hope you, your ex wife, and daughter heal. Divorce is so fuckin tough, but what you're doing takes a significant amount of strength. Even on those days you're on your knees.

And yes you will feel guilty, because you are intertwined & care for him. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's just draining & not fair to yourself or your child. 
I would suggest, maybe if you have family nearby,  AND when/if you're ready, see if you can stay with them. Or at least be open with them about what's going on, so that you have a safe haven. Especially, with a little one. Our kids unfortunately pick up on more than we assume.
