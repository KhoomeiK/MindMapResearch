Server admins have access to the steamID and they can implement a trigger like that, but they don't push it to battlemetrics, so public users can't access it. Also doubt they ever will since it will basically mean we could stalk someone with great ease (they are against that), aiding in stream sniping and so on. I know with this feature we kinda want the same, but for now has its limitations.

I'll add you discord so we can chat up, maybe you can help in testing aswell, don't have an ETA for that feature (hoping next week) since this is more like a fun side project (outside of work) so i can learn a bit more node.js and so something cool with rust."
