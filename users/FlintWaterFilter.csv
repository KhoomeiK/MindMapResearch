Edit 2: the quote ""“The next day we drove to Baton Rouge, and of course, she came with us. After we got offstage, she came up to me and said, ‘I have something to tell you. My father’s the chief of police and the entire state of Louisiana is looking for me because I’ve gone missing. Oh, and besides that, I’m only fourteen.’ I wasn’t incredibly scared, because in my somewhat deluded mind, I knew that if she told the chief of police she was in love with me, he wasn’t going to have me taken out to a field and shot, but I did want to get her the hell back home right away. So we had sex one more time.”

Is only the first part of my comment. Its true, they don't pay enough for Americans to want to do the job, but the gap between where it is now and where it should be in order for Americans to want to do the work is a much larger margin than youre envisioning.

If it paid minimum wage... Not enough. You can do literally anything for minimum wage... Why would you do hard manual labor in the sun? In order to make agriculture a job Americans want to do, you're going to have to get much closer to median income.

Furthermore its not a viable job for student because the harvest time is after the start of school in the US, so you have to use adults."

In Canada, the wineries I've been to, are able to use Canadian citizens to harvest grapes, and it appears to be a pretty decent job.
