Wellthatsucks,fedfa7i,t1_fecvoxz,1579009934.0,"I thought it was absolutely awful. I like musicals as much as the next guy, and I love Jane Levy and Lauren Graham but eeeesh. They probably bought shares in autotune at this point with the amount used. Why hire extras who can't sing, in a musical? And make them sing?

Most of them can barely hold a note (Alex Newell being the exception). That Peter Gallagher ""true colors"" solo was just...so...horrendous. I don't remember ever hearing someone on national TV singing without any voice AND the ability to follow a melody. 

The plot is flimsy and the songs are really ham-fisted and it comes off annoying to me. It's a pass."

Plus side (pun intended) since universal studios are good guys, they gave us fast pass for 2 other rides."
Wellthatsucks,fe7a0iy,t3_ensnzs,1578911965.0,"What's with Americans not wearing pants?

Everytime I go to the US it baffles me to see people in January when it's like 10 degrees in shorts and sometimes flip flops at the mall. It's freezing, there's snow on the ground, I got my tuque and puffer jacket on, AND YOU'RE IN SHORTS!? WTF?"

PlasticSurgery,fdx43sy,t3_emlneo,1578765113.0,"I'll go with the family on that one. My first thought was ""you don't need absolutely anything"" and when people mentioned lip filler it's the ONLY thing that could be reasonable to do but everything else is perfect. I also would only do the top lip, bottom one's fine."
