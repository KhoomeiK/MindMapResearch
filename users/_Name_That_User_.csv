That is INCREDIBLY brave considering you were also his victim. Anyone who calls themself your family wouldn‚Äôt set out to hurt you and the people you love. Without your intervention, it eventually may have escalated past a hospital visit. He was endangering everyone in that house and you stepped up and stopped him from hurting your real family anymore. You‚Äôre completely right in what you did and everyone here is on your side in this. He‚Äôs only upset and lashing out with nasty words because he‚Äôs being held accountable for his horrid actions and can‚Äôt hurt you physically anymore."
