bingbongtheorem,ff42lkd,t1_ff3fe26,1579554176.0,This is reddit. You’ll obviously get downvotes for asking for upvotes so come back when you aren’t begging for karma
whatisthisthing,fdvb9p4,t1_fdtho4s,1578745565.0,I don’t think it’s impossible as many Muslims memorise the whole Quran from memory and is even encouraged by their religion to do so
lotrmemes,fdorj5d,t1_fdnzd1s,1578611282.0,Well it’s the same this I listed above but I think there’s no 3 month wait
lotrmemes,fdnz4ye,t1_fdnbem2,1578595797.0,Not really as she’s breaking a bunch of rules such as a 3 month period between marriages and being a prostitute and thinking you can trick god

facepalm,fcxay9j,t1_fcv4qi1,1578057807.0,You do know it was a joke right. A kid would have to have 0 IQ to be able to strangle themselves with headphones
Showerthoughts,fctvin8,t1_fct0fri,1577961683.0,Mercury and mars are the same mears. And we don’t say Eears on earth so why use this system on these planets
facepalm,fctv7fz,t1_fcreghc,1577961234.0,10 in base 2 is 2 in base 10 but you mentioned 3 types so it should be 11
facepalm,fctuzh6,t1_fcsuf23,1577960912.0,It’s because people don’t realise that more dead children lowers life expectancy and that it’s just an average. For example if we had someone who died at 60 and some who died at 2 the life expectancy between these two would be 31 but it doesn’t mean a 3rd person will die at 31
therewasanattempt,fctu3cz,t1_fcqwo77,1577959585.0,Seems people think XY chromosome means that a person is a pig when a homo sapien cannot be a pig as they are not the same thing. And why only men as female pigs exist too so all humans are pigs even though it makes no scientific sense. So by that logic I’m a dinosaur and I’m not a human and I say you are a dragon because words are facts

HumansBeingBros,fcn1uib,t1_fcn0vs7,1577800869.0,The mother died when the baby was 3 months and then when she was older someone decided to use a more recent photo and put them together in the painting
facepalm,fckbw22,t1_fck21bu,1577721835.0,"it's a joke.

The actual answer is 180"
AskReddit,fckbsx9,t1_fck33tc,1577721777.0,"But the main problem is herd immunity. 
The disease is more likely to spread to immunocompromised people who can't get vaccines so it's better to get vaccines so they can't get it from you instead of waiting for natural immunity risking others to actually die"
AskReddit,fcjx6tq,t1_fcjvzcb,1577708969.0,It is a thing which is why they say you can’t get chicken pox twice however antivaxxers treat diseases like polio and measles as chicken pox thinking that vaccines aren’t needed as you will naturally gain immunity however they are more likely to die than gain immunity to these
OldSchoolCool,fcjsyts,t1_fcjsofj,1577703134.0,"How dare you assume gender, the poster is obviously an alien, not female or male."
wholesomegreentext,fcjstjh,t1_fcjr8ey,1577702925.0,Well it seems she didn’t care about anon as she wanted to have fun at New Years while her boyfriend was very stressed. It seems like she doesn’t love him enough to sacrifice a bit of fun that she can have next year to stay and support anon so she is more likely to cheat if she doesn’t truly love him
facepalm,fcjrkyw,t1_fcii23x,1577701102.0,That’s an easy one obviously 999999999
Showerthoughts,fbzzixj,t1_fbzv3m8,1577270367.0,That was mentioned in Dr.Stone
