I consider what you have to be a rare gift that I wouldn't even seek out, but rather consider it as a bonus if it were to be there. On the flip side, if someone is perhaps not that into it, it may well still be overshadowed by everything else good you have on offer - and thus not matter too much either way.

Good luck and stay strong."
