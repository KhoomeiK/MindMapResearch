SuicideWatch,fd96dbk,t3_ek71e9,1578229132.0,"It's just like people who always say ""It will get better!"". Like, when exactly? I've been like this since I was 11 years old. Now I'm 24 and it only got worse. Because on top of depression I also have responsibilities. I have no friends, I never had a romantic relationship, suffer from terrible social anxiety, noone gives a fucking shit about me and if I were to die right now noone would notice. It won't get better. I have nothing to live for. Nothing gives me joy. Every day I wake up and I'm on the verge of tears because I remember who I am.

I wish there was a way to simply reset my life, start all over and not make the same mistakes again. I can't change who I am now."
socialanxiety,fcngzfh,t1_fcn7x1y,1577811508.0,"Thanks, I think I'll go and if it's to overwhelming I just tell them I promised other people to show up and leave or something. Easier than cancelling the invitation now 2 hours in advance."
socialanxiety,fcn1id9,t1_fcmytcf,1577800573.0,I wanted to go because I thought it's a small party with 5-6 people and now my friends (or more like acquaintances) told me that it's a huuuuge party with tons of people I don't know. I almost threw up thinking about going there. And it's a themed party so I would have to wear some weird 1920s costume which I neither posses nor would I be willing to wear one because I'm to scared of being overdressed or underdressed.
socialanxiety,fcmymlx,t3_ei2ly6,1577797808.0,I absolutely understand what you're going through. I'm in the exact same situation and I think I'll end up staying by myself instead. I Hope you don't do the same thing and have a good time.

SuicideWatch,fc6accq,t3_egejba,1577475931.0,"I was looking at your post history and saw you are only 15. I absolutely believe you that you have problems. May I ask what kind of problems you have? People here might be able to give you advice. You are 15 years old, you have all the possibilities to fix your life right now. From experience I can tell you that it gets harder to do that once you're an adult because of all the responsibilities. 

Let us know whats wrong if you want to."
SuicideWatch,fc69oxo,t1_fc5dj17,1577475498.0,"That sounds horrible and I can only imagine how you feel. I wish I could help you, I wish I could help everyone on the planet."
SuicideWatch,fc69azn,t3_egdj4t,1577475239.0,"I understand what you are going through. I don't have any friends at the moment, not even ""regular friends"" and lost the only friend I could share my feelings with because I told her that I have feelings for her. I completely understand that you want someone to talk about your problems, who supports you and helps you. It's terrible and noone should have to go through this. And yet here we are.

I wish I could help you but can only hope that everything gets better for you!"
SuicideWatch,fc5cvs6,t1_fc5b7xt,1577453662.0,">And this will most likely piss you off as well but from where I sit your situation is a major upgrade

It doesn't piss me off it's just something I can't believe because I can't imagine that there is a way to feel worse right now. My friends also moved on and I'm only 24. We did so much together but they have their lifes together. I was bullied so much in school it affects my entire life. I have such bad social anxiety from that, that I'm unable to have any meaningful social interactions. There's nothing I can do to fix that. It not only affects my private life but also how I perform in jobs etc. And the people who did that to me have normal lifes. I looked them up, they have girlfriends, jobs, are good looking and have a loving family. I have none of that but at least in 6 months I have a university degree that allows me to work for the rest of my life in a career I don't even want to pursue anymore, isn't that great?

>Was with her from 15 to 27 but we grew apart. We have always remained great friends though. 

At least you made these experiences. You used your youth and I wasted it. I can never get that back.

&#x200B;

> If you want to know ask and I'll discuss any and all my issues. 

If you want do it. I can't do anything else other than listen though. I don't have advice because I can't even fix my own life."
