In this case b is the term z+1 and a is z^2.

You can either recognize it immediately, or try multiplying the two terms together and simplifying to get the same result. 

Remember when multiplying polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by every term in the second."

Yesterday I mentioned how empty it is and how it's usually always packed at my barber shop (it usually is). This prompted him to talk about his work schedule, then school schedule and I found out the dude is going part time to flight school to learn to be a pilot. He mentioned he learns about how the engines work and how they're similar to car engines, now boom we're discussing the horrors of the pre-owned auto market and financing newer cars to avoid recurring maintenance problems.

I think for you the main objective would be to not fall back into the daily smoking habit. Take a tbreak, even just for 48h or so - I think all of 2020 is a bit too unrealistic, at least at this time. After that, I would maybe do like a light smoke and then try to ride that the rest of the day. Do your absolute best to moderate your use. If you really are going into the daily routine again, something else that helps me if I'm unable to take a tbreak is to at least wait til the evening for my first smoke.

Also, as counterintuitive as it sounds, maybe focus on how much better it will feel after a tbreak than if you keep smoking all day every day. (Maybe this isn't too healthy but it's something I think about when I'm struggling to not smoke)"
explainlikeimfive,fcavd9y,t3_egv65j,1577577352.0,"So the idea of ""breaking the seal"" is a myth. The only thing going on basically is your body is just filling your bladder quickly (i.e. you can hold it just as well regardless of if you've already went), the only catch is it takes a few hours from your first drink for this to take effect, which is why it seems it's the first pee that triggers it.

That being said, your kidneys are responsible for regulating how much water is in your blood. It does this by checking your blood osmolality - that is, how much solid vs liquid is in your blood. Alcohol is recognized by your kidneys as a liquid, and therefore thinks you're overly hydrated and tries to flush the excess water out, thereby filling your bladder. 

Furthermore, alcohol, being a diuretic, inhibits the release of a chemical called ADH which typically signals to your body to stop flushing water. If this is inhibited then your body will continually flush water by filling your bladder.

One final factor is that lots of alcohol may be carbonated, which can cause pressure inside your stomach which may also affect the bladder, making you WANT to pee more, even if the bladder isn't entirely filled.

Edit: a comma"
Petioles,fcatg1e,t1_fcaslhv,1577576273.0,"Ah damn, that's pretty rough. I relate to that in that I always make excuses as to why I can or should smoke, and if theres weed around, I can't help myself. If a friend left some over and I was out, I would probably justify smoking some, too, even if I intended to get him back later.

Based on your response, I'm guessing your tbreaks are during times you were completely out and didnt have access to it?

That's pretty much me atm. I cant take tbreaks even if I wanted to, I just give in by the end of the day or on day 2. However, I'm currently overseas visiting family for the holidays and have now been smoke-free since..... the 3 dabs I took before leaving for the airport a week ago.

The first few days I had cold sweats like mad and I even threw up on the plane after about 20 hours from those dabs (we had a looong flight with 2 layovers so maybe it was from exhaustion/being on a plane too long). A week later and im still having some cold sweats and trouble sleeping (although 7 hour jetlag might do that haha)"
Petioles,fcaqp8x,t3_egwv7p,1577574697.0,"Why do you consider yourself 100% addicted?

To me it seems you have a healthy ability to quit for weeks at a time, demonstrating a good amount of self control. That paired with your lack of withdrawal symptoms leads me to ask that.

I too believe im addicted to weed, I go through an oz about every 2 weeks, so a quarter only lasts about 3-4 days for me, and I definitely cant take a tbreak like you can. I try and even a day is too difficult and I usually give in to cure my headache/grogginess/anxiety.
