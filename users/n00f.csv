conspiracy,ff35cow,t1_ff2gqn5,1579534058.0,"So you can't even tell me anything Trump has done? That's why people who aren't Trump fans don't think highly of his supporters. If someone asks you what do you like about the person you think of so highly, you need to have a couple answers right at the top of your head. Liking the bully because he makes fun of people you dont like seems to be the only think y'all do like about him. Also, assuming that because I don't like him, I'm the demographic that gets bullied the most by him, makes you come off as extremely narrow minded.

The one thing I like about Trump, he helped stopped a lot of rapists from accessing kids on sites like Craigslist. But that was before the whole Epstein thing, so now I'm thinking it was to save face.

Now your turn. What is something Trump has done that makes you think he is a good/worthy President/person?"
