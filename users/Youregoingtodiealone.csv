youseeingthisshit,fd7i55q,t1_fd5tr3b,1578204901.0,"How the fuck else are you going to drop pretend parachute man except through pretend plane equipped to drop pretend parachute man?  It's not a parachute man unless his ass is dropping from something else, all while having an attached parachute.  Franky, I'm more impressed by being able to steer parachute man into a real man grasp than I would be a paraglider parachute man of sorts under his own propulsion.  The bottom line is it is the lack of control parachute man has from being dropped from a plane that makes remote control words and words and wow you're still reading."

politics,fczri06,t1_fcyokyj,1578107380.0,"So you're saying Kissenger was bad, so Soleimani isn't culpable?  Was Soleimani a combatant on the field?  You're telling me Iran and Iraq haven't fought a war before?  On the one hand, you argue that ""every other country in the Middle East - keep some brutal, hard people like Soleimani around.""  And I suppose you fairly note that ""war is an unavoidable reality.""

Is it?  You think this will be war?  America invaded Iraq and supplanted the government.  We recently found an Iranian general in Iraq.  We bombed him.  In Iraq.  

I don't think this is war.  Call it finding a spy.  You think spies caught quietly don't get killed just the same?"
politics,fczlugc,t3_ejlbyn,1578104052.0,"Why was one of Iran's top generals in Iraq?  Was he handing out cookies?  Good vibes?  Or perhaps seeding an insurgency?  

I guess we'll never know because he wasn't careful and we bombed him.  Probably shouldn't be inciting insurrection in your neighbor who is allied with the United States and not be careful about your travels.

I'm as liberal as they come.  I hate Donald Trump.  Fuck that asshole.

But what was this guy doing in Iraq?  When you think about the answer objectively, you'll realize why he's dead.

Some things aren't politics.  Some things are not allowing your enemies to get comfortable and plot on your soldiers, citizens, friends and allies.

This fuck was no martyr.  He was an enemy operative caught in our allies territory.

Democratic friends, I know it's been awhile, but national security isn't politics.   Trump didn't pull this guy's name from a hat.  This was America's security apparatus - that Trumps stupid ass has denigrated and disparaged - coming to him with actionable intelligence.  Some Four Star brought the President an action plan based on hundreds of American intelligence and military operatives knowledge and expertise.  Trump didn't plan this.  Our brave men and women did, our soldiers and government working every day to keep my daughter safe.

 This person, a highly ranked general of our sworn enemy, exposing himself in a foreign neighbor while up to no good, wanted to kill Americans.  He already has.  He would have again. 

Don't let the world forget.  Presidents in our country get 8 years max.  But the USA will Never run out of time, money, or people. Or bombs, technology, or wherewithal. American weaponry isn't Democrat or Republican.  It has our flag on it because it represents our people and interests.

This wasn't a good guy.  If you don't like to see the sausage get made, don't look.  But this man was in Iraq, who is not an ally of Iran, to kill Americans.  Heads down Iran.  We don't miss."
