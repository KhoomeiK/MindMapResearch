Tinder,ffeod7c,t1_ffdtnv8,1579857216.0,Those ones always freak me out.
todayilearned,ff71od5,t1_ff6kpa0,1579639356.0,That movie hit me a lot harder after growing up and seeing a bit of shit.  I have a hard time watching it all the way through now.
Tinder,ff6lzi0,t1_ff3syn1,1579630045.0,Funny how that works huh?
Tinder,ff6lynv,t1_ff3pkb8,1579630031.0,"That’s a fair point, but I know a fair number of both."
Tinder,ff6lw0w,t1_ff35yms,1579629986.0,"Very true, but there are a lot of genuinely humble successful/famous people.  At least from what I see in my work/life experiences."
Republican,ff6ltnv,t1_ff1k6l9,1579629945.0,"I think we agree on that, there are times which I’d be more okay with intervention, but not everywhere all the time.  Generally I think our military should be for defensive purposes."
Tinder,ff34wpw,t1_ff2zr0w,1579533754.0,"Yeah but there’s the rehearsals, and multiple services, church gigs can be rough!"
Tinder,ff34ua1,t1_ff34i28,1579533705.0,"Some people just have something about them that screams musician without being a douchebag, people seem to know it without them yelling that they’re a musician all the time, but this guy screams “will never leave my hometown”. Or possibly “will move to LA/Nashville/Austin/New York and leave after a few months."
Tinder,ff34oje,t1_ff2vay3,1579533595.0,"Honestly from my experience, I see a lot more egos with people who are not famous than people who are."
Republican,ff1j8z5,t1_fecf8hm,1579480081.0,I definitely agree that peace is better.  I’m not as sure about the rest of it!  But I guess I’ll have to look into it.
todayilearned,ff1j2xu,t1_fetw97q,1579480008.0,"Ohhh okay, yeah that makes more sense."
todayilearned,fetu7yp,t1_fets7ae,1579380129.0,Few days??
todayilearned,feiaufn,t1_fehr3gm,1579134186.0,"Yeah I really think it was this, and probably them thinking “if a black guy made it, it can’t work”"
politics,fecexe9,t1_fe3j8lo,1578972292.0,"I really don’t agree with that, but maybe we watch different media.  Most of the stuff my more liberal family and friends watch is all making him out to be the devil, fear mongering, and scare tactics.  And of course there is some white washing on the fox side, but also a lot of extended clips that seem pretty different than how they’re portrayed."
Republican,fecer0w,t1_fe60fdx,1578972172.0,"Well obviously, we have the worlds largest and most funded military by extremely large margins, and Iran is a shitty country that would be on their own, other than maybe some help from some other little middle eastern countries."
Republican,fecen1g,t1_fe5lu74,1578972098.0,"Of course they can’t, they’d get obliterated.  It’s just weird seeing how the liberals have been framing things."
Republican,fe5lqpc,t1_fe3nejd,1578871020.0,"It’s weird seeing this, and then on all the main political subreddits, it’s all about how majorly he messed up and how we’re all mad and we don’t feel safe anymore."
politics,fe3d2mk,t1_fdxhhe3,1578848197.0,"Y’all are acting like every president in our life time hasn’t sold out to the saudis for their oil and access to military bases there.

I’m not saying it’s good, but it’s sure not anything new."
politics,fe3cvqh,t1_fdxuxzp,1578848136.0,Seriously?  All I see on the news is how trump is an evil mastermind?  What news are you watching?
politics,fe37d1f,t1_fdxoyud,1578846634.0,"I think both parties pray on the weak and uneducated.  They both have some truth to what they say they want to do, and I’m sure a lot of them really do have good intentions, but our politicians are awful."
entertainment,fe0y2b1,t1_fdwd5yl,1578820130.0,Do you really believe that?
GetMotivated,fdrzfe6,t1_fdopgjq,1578691993.0,"Personally I love his stuff, particularly when viewed in the context of his peers in the mainstream realm.  Is he my favorite?  No, but compared to most of the current crop of mainstream country singers, particularly headliners, he’s significantly more country, and in my opinion, significantly better than most of his peers."
GetMotivated,fdreu15,t1_fdodh9q,1578683593.0,"I personally love Garth. But I do think that if it hadn’t been for him, country as a whole might be better today.  Once that kind of money is on the table, there’s no going back.  It’s seems to me that there are two different trends popping up that bode well for better country music, one Is the alternative country/Americans scene, and the other is just a more country sound in the mainstream.  Hopefully things get better."
GetMotivated,fdrdyih,t1_fdp1ejg,1578683070.0,"I love the stew drivers!  I did mean his solo success, because I don’t believe they had that side of an impact.  Still, his stuff with them is probably my favorite of all his work."
Republican,fdrd971,t1_fdn4b39,1578682870.0,"Well that’s pretty interesting.  I was pretty young then, and didn’t know that!"
GetMotivated,fdrb197,t1_fcp6e1u,1578681976.0,Actually those are great tips!  Every time I do that it turns out way better for me...  I just need to do it more often!
GetMotivated,fdo5bob,t1_fdnv2gn,1578599159.0,That’s nothing compared to some other acts stories.  Have you heard Midlands supposed “backstory”?
GetMotivated,fdo54u7,t1_fdo2jfx,1578599066.0,"As someone with a bit of industry insight, he definitely has been at the helm of a very major change in mainstream country music, along with acts like Cody Johnson, who’s blazing the way for other Texas country acts to John the mainstream, and Jon Pardi, who’s been able to put out a very country record, WITH the support of his label.

I’m sure in some ways this could all be tied back to Chris Stapleton and his success, but Luke is definitely the biggest thing out there right now, and he’s been pushing things back to a much more country sound, (more Brooks and Dunn than a new  George Strait Willie, or Waylon)."
Republican,fdlps21,t1_fdkcnoe,1578529586.0,When was that??
relationship_advice,fcmx9rs,t1_f9s9yhu,1577796340.0,"I live in a city fairly well known for partying, and I see this kind of thing pretty often, or more often, just someone going out and getting drunk and hooking up, while in a relationship, or even engaged/married whatever.  It’s a really quick way for me to lose all respect for someone."
GetMotivated,fcmjfya,t1_fckf2fl,1577777744.0,"Yeah I go out alone pretty often, I never thought it was a confidence boost, when I was young, it was weird going out  alone, but that hasn’t been a concern for a very long time."
todayilearned,fcmigzx,t1_fclqf4j,1577776591.0,Perfect.
GetMotivated,fcm9vbg,t3_ehdy5f,1577768185.0,"I may be too late for this one, but I need to make some lifestyle changes, I go out too much, and drink too much, and that leads to spending too much.  Overall I’m pretty healthy, and I’m fairly happy, although somewhat lonely.  Going out and networking is important for my work, but I don’t want to be over extending myself.

Any help, advice or relevant stories from others lives would be appreciated!"
AskReddit,fcm92ei,t1_fckloeu,1577767520.0,"Yeah, I just try to eat a balanced diet and not too many carbs or a crazy amount of fat.  I don’t really think about what I eat that often, and I’ve lost a ton of weight."
r4r,fcm2u27,t3_ehsbf3,1577762778.0,"Hi!  I live in the south, and used to live in California, you sound like a cool person to me, And I currently have a lot more free time than normal, so I’d love to talk!"
AskReddit,eq1kkp2,t3_bwy02i,1559711934.0,"I guess it’s not really a part of my life anymore.  But I once was the other man to a woman who was in a relationship.  It lasted a bit over a year.  I always thought she was going to leave him, and I was in love with her, I’m talking I would have married her with no questions or thoughts.  I really thought we were meant for each other.  Eventually I realized she wasn’t leaving, and so I left.  When I finally came to that realization, part of me wanted to tell him about us, the only thing that had kept my guilt from crushing me was the fact that I really had myself convinced we were meant for each other.   We haven’t spoken since then, and I’m not sure if they’re together anymore, but I still think about her."
