DeepRockGalactic,fdkfgki,t3_elv6zi,1578502745.0,"Get to 1 star rank so you can activate Machine events and do deep dives for your overclocks.

stick with has 3 till you have most of your upgrades for your weapons tool and armor,  then move to haz 4. many green beards just dont have enough of them to survive 1 swarm on haz4

the best universal perks for survival are vampire, beserker and iron will then the other perk slits could be used for what you want, i prefer weekend athlete for the movement speed which can greatly help you out run all bugs and repositions for better shooting.

shoot weak spots to maxmize ammo to killing. 

conserve flairs on solo runs for when you need them in swarm situations.

Do not get surrounded or stuck on dead ends ever its just a death wish, run away kite keep them at safe distance. 

Dig to everything to dont need a tool for to save zips plats and fuel for when you need them.

Always salute your teammates and if they dont salute back shun them."
