Oh, yea ok. Well in that case you can argue all day long that it was an Orange. Who cares what you or anyone says if they cant prove the validity of their opinions, especially when they go against the EXPERTS who DIRECTLY observed the incident.

> Yeah but maybe not. Multiple witnesses have said it would be unusual but admit its possible.

Of course. I dont have a 100% confidence that its out of this world. That number is perhaps 80% for me. I feel a lot of resistance in believing that possibility because it is naturally scary. But lets forget about little green men and just focus on the facts e.g. if it was an object, if humans possess or can possess this technology etc. Lets just look at the facts.

> Lol ok ""you dont have the same view as me so you're weak"" really? That's your argument. I think we're done. I wish I'd have read your whole diatribe before coming this far.

Giving up that easily? Stay here, debate and prove that your viewpoint is valid.

> And as I pointed out, the US military doesnt have to ability to forsee the future (that we no of 😂). Thry had no way to know what a big story this would turn into.

Ok well thats your opinion then.

> All I'm saying is it's possible this event MAY not be what it appears to be. It's not unreasonable.

Of course. I think you wont find anyone with a 100% confidence that its out of this world.

> Interesting. The underwater claims have been disputed elsewhere by Fravor. I dont claim to all the answers.

Interesting? So you didnt even know the underwater situation happened? How can you contradict these experts when you havent even studied what the whole situation was? You're going to look at 5% of what was reported and then draw your own conclusions, that go AGAINST what they're saying, that these were REAL objects and nothing spoofed or illusiionary in nature? 

What do you think, how credible do you look right now?

So far you have provided no evidence that supports your belief of 90% confidence that this is man-made so I have nothing to say for that.

This was a link on Youtube given by somoene with your views that it was man-made: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28729/docs-show-navy-got-ufo-patent-granted-by-warning-of-similar-chinese-tech-advances

However these are all just patents. It doesnt mean the object actually exists. However thats the link you should have given me if you had any idea of what you were talking about, if you had any search, but no you just go with what you BELIEVE, you dont care about facts and what can be backed up.

The bottomline is, that these were actual objects, not something illusionary. The experts said these were actual OBJECTS. You have no technical or scientific authority to contradict what they said.  They are NOT spoof tech - you provided ZERO proof for your claims that this was spoof tech and you still have 60% confidence in that.

The questions for you should be: Were these real objects and if not, what were they, and what evidence do you have to support those claims?

Whether they were man-made or not is a different question.

What the origin of these objects is, no one knows but we can make guesses. No one said we couldnt do that."
news,ff9rot7,t3_esa9fg,1579719666.0,I don't know what to say. How does that even happen
ufo,ff9k9ck,t1_ff8x12p,1579714781.0,"You have a few big problems here, basically: (1) Proving that you have the technical and scientific authority to contradict these military experts with 100's of years of combined experience, their eye witness accounts and their advanced instruments (2) Prove that the object did not go under water as they mentioned here: https://youtu.be/PRgoisHRmUE?t=1296 - Because no spoof tech can go under water and travel at 500 knots under water. It was confirmed that the object went under water.

Those are the two main things you have to deal with.

""multimodal spoof tech"" ? What exactly is that, or could it be?

> Also, it may surprise you to learn that you are also some guy on the internet.

Yea of course, me and you are both just some guys on the internet. But its your word **against** military people with 100's of years of combined experience and advanced instruments. When they said these were actual objects and not any kind of illusions or holograms, **you don't have the technical or professional background or authority to contradict what they saw.** And that is the core issue here for any claim you make. If you are going to say anything at all that goes against what they saw or said, **you need to provide your credentials and the proof that you have the authority to say that.** You cant just link to a hologram patent or paper and say ""yea, thats what it was"" because anyone on the internet can do that, and they should not be expected to be believed.

> That claim is dubious. It is much less documented.
 
What is dubious in what way? Did you see the video? Here's the link with the timestamp of 22:36 where this issue of the objects entering the water is mentioned: https://youtu.be/PRgoisHRmUE?t=1296 - are you saying the object did not go under water and what is your authority for saying that?

So again, what technical and scientific authority do you have, to refute what these experts and users of advanced instruments observed? The objects were observed entering water and traveling at 500 knots and it was confirmed using radar. How can you place 90% confidence into your claim that this was a hologram or spoof tech or something else man-made?

I'm not saying here there were little green men in those things. We have to know what we know, and we also need to know what we dont know. There's a lot of things we dont know about these objects. But there are things that we do know and all of those things come from the direct observations of these military experts and their advanced instruments.

> Yet again, it holograms. Also, an illusionary image can travel at any speed as its not limited by constraints to physical objects.

No Earthly hologram or spoof tech can do ALL these things: be 40 feet long, travel at such high speeds in the air **and water** and maintain the visual clarity that was observed by some of these military experts and their instruments, and then also shoot into the sky at 80k feet and beyond, disappearing into space. No Earthly source is able to provide the power to create such a hologram or ""multi modal spoof tech"" and make it move around like that. They observed a white object, not a hologram. A hologram cant appear with such visual clarity in broad daylight. 

And as I pointed out, if the US military made these objects, they would do everything for them to not be discovered by people who would then later go on to give multiple interviews. They would never let the objects just fly at 100 knots at 28k feet while being detected by radar, in an area that is KNOWN to be regularly used for military exercises. They would be sure to play with these objects very far away from other military groups.  So there are a lot of problems with that scenario in which you have 90% of confidence that this was man-made.

You belong to a large portion of society that is unable to tolerate uncertainty which in my view is a sign of weakness. There are lots of things written about that character trait.

You are a nobody, you are some anonymous person on the internet just like me, as I said. Prove your authority on this subject **if you are going to say anything that contradicts** these military experts with 100's of years of combined experience, their eyewitness accounts and their advanced instruments."

Along other questions, what is your own probability for the two options? Is it 100/0? That means 100% probability that it's man made.

I think most people here dont believe its man-made.

There are lots of options we have to consider and rule out what doesnt make sense. In those 3 options, lets add: What kind of object was it; Hologram or an actual physical object.

Also these objects went under water and that's mentioned at 22:00 traveling at 500 knots under water. No hologram can show that behavior.

Holograms also can't travel 40 miles in 30 seconds.

Multiple military people with 100's of years of combined experience saw these objects with their own eyes and instruments. They did not say they could have been holograms. All of these suggested that these were real objects and you're someone on the internet suggesting that they didnt know what they were looking it.

As I said there are multiple problems with options 2 and 3 that I gave you before. I can give more detail on them later and tell you what those problems are."
ufo,ff84d7m,t1_ff830gd,1579665663.0,"> If you read the patent that is what it describes. It can spoof both.

It cant fool the eyes. David Fravor was at 28k feet and saw this white object darting about at high speeds in broad daylight:

> _A few seconds later, they noticed an unusual object hovering with erratic movements about 50 feet (15 m) above the churning water. Both Fravor[16] and Slaight later described the object as a large bright white Tic Tac, 30 to 46 feet_

A hologram cant appear like an actual object. The object later also shot up to 80k feet and above as it disappeared. There's no human technology that can create a hologram like that. Human tech in this field has never made any kinds of huge jumps like that in a short amount of time. This is a 40 feet wide object, visible from miles.

And also radar was jammed. A hologram cant jam radar.

It is all of these together.

> We learn the Hawkeye data bricks were confiscated and that the Hawkeye had the tech to get the most comprehensive data collection on the tic tac. Everyone on the Hawkeye signed an NDA and was debriefed by airforce.

There are 3 possible options:

(1) The object was out of this world. Data was confiscated because high level govt officials knew this was a serious incident and maybe they can learn secrets from the data so the US govt can learn from it and boost their own security. They want to make sure no other country has access to the data. That is the view of mostly everyone who is taking this incident seriously.

(2) It was a earthly object (made by the US military). They did an exercise but made a mistake of having this exercise being discovered unintentionally by another branch of the military whose members would directly witness the exercise and later go on to give multiple interviews about it.

(3) Earthly object, exercise didn't have any mistakes and they actually wanted the other US military branch to discover the exercise and have all these officials give interviews and the video leaked out.

What scenario was it, in your opinion?

For options 2 and 3, there are a lot of things that dont make sense."
ufo,ff81aj6,t1_ff38mt1,1579663376.0,"But this thing was detected on radar in two different modes, IR and TV. I dont think a Hologram can do that?

And if the US military was the cause, why would they do this exercise in front of their own people who would then go on to report about it and give multiple interviews etc? And these objects did not care about being discovered and that really says that it couldnt have been the US military creating or manipulating these objects."
ufo,ff808fz,t1_ff3lu5k,1579662617.0,"Testimony and Radar - dont forget the radar and what they were observing on their instruments. And the fact that multiple people reported the same thing: a 40 feet long object dropping out of the sky from 28k feet to 50 feet in 0.78 seconds, recorded on their camera, and multiple eyewitness accounts of all this happening multiple times. It is all of that together, not just one thing.

Yes evidence could be better, no doubt. Now that everyone has phones that can take 1080p videos, there might be something that is recorded in clear view but for now all we have are these confirmed encounters from multiple people in the military and radar recordings. I believe what they say was real.

I think these other life forms (whatever it is that was commanding these Nimitz objects), do not care to go into cities usually. They stay far away.

A lot of people are saying that this Nimitz encounter is the best most credible one we have for now. Maybe one day we'll get something on 1080p video and 30 frames per second.

The ability to tolerate uncertainty and be ok with it is a good thing. We dont know everything but we know it was something. As to what it was, we dont have clear answers for now.

Thats 24,000 mph.

I think the only thing I can do is forget about it but for now I'm watching all the interviews. I think I need to find a local UFO group and talk to them to share what I'm feeling. It will help me out. Thats all I can do."
