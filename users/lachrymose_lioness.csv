i am a healthy weight though (slightly on the higher side, bmi 23) so thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s easier for me."

SuicideWatch,fdr3c6o,t3_emn1g9,1578678896.0,"Cutting is an awful way to go, it will be very painful and not the highest success rate. If you are successful, it will be horrific for whoever finds you. You will traumatise them most likely.

Please reach out to someone, tell a close friend or your GP about this. You can message me and rant if youâ€™d like, Iâ€™d be happy to listen and try to give you some advice. Get rid of the blades, and all you have. Also, get some antibacterial cream and some proper bandages so you donâ€™t get an infection in your current cuts.

Obviously I canâ€™t stop you if youâ€™re really set on doing this, but do your research. Maybe change the date to a little further away, give yourself time for things to change and for you to seek help. If things donâ€™t get better and you really donâ€™t see anyway out then maybe consider it as your final option.

Iâ€™m here to talk if you need, stay safe <3"
SuicideWatch,fdr1hsj,t3_emrlo5,1578678247.0,"Look, Iâ€™m just going to be straight here. You committed a crime against a child, you may have ruined their life and caused them trauma they will never recover from. Of course, I donâ€™t know the details, but people under 16 CANNOT consent. Or 18 or whatever the age of consent is. I was groomed by a pedophile when I was 13 and I have to live with the trauma. Everytime someone touches my thighs I flinch. I never want to have a man touch me again because of this person. You did the same, you â€˜made a mistakeâ€™ but you willingly did this, and you are disgusting for that. 

Five years is not enough for a lifetime of pain you may have caused someone.
Iâ€™m not saying you deserve to die. You can change. But I swear to god if you ever touch a child again I will hunt you down and rip your ballsack off. That includes talking to minors online.

You need help, there is therapy that can help you cope with both your suicidal thoughts and being a pedophile, and you need to reach out. 
Iâ€™m sorry for being harsh but it makes me extremely angry. I really hope you do change and realise how fucked up and disgusting what you did is, and never do anything like that again. I also hope you can find the strength to reach out and get help."
