It looks at the shift from propaganda to mold public opinion, more to neutralizing the public into inaction by polarizing them with conflicting information or misinformation (patently false information) so that ***NO*** consensus can be reached. Both achieve the same goal of allowing the power elite to carry out the policies they wish while reducing the influence of an ostensibly democratic public which, in conjunction with more and more police state-like authoritarian measures making them more compliant, can no longer tell what is truth and what is misinformation. The public descends into arguing amongst themselves as opposed with those in power.

todayilearned,fcuhw70,t1_fcszm97,1577981347.0,"What caused the instability at the time was Nicolas Biddle's (central bank president) response to Jackson's declaration to shut down the bank. Biddle's response was to shut off the country's  money supply initiating a game of public opinion ""chicken"" with Jackson as to who was hurting the country. Jackson did not flinch and began depositing U.S. receipts in state banks essentially bypassing the U.S. central bank. Money began filtering back into the economy."

One of Jackson's main issues with the Second Bank of The United States was that it was partially owned by European interests. He thought this to be as dangerous as a standing foreign army on U.S. soil.  

His veto message against rechartering the bank is a very interesting read;
