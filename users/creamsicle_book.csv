I found a great cork to put a stop to my my what if's, I hope it is valuable for you as well:

Instead of asking ""what if"", ask ""we'll see if""

And then I throw every other persistent and unanswerable thought into quick bullet points in my journal, like a brain dump so it's out of my system and tell myself I'll get to it again later if it's that important.

ADHD,ff0oj9w,t3_er0g1a,1579470811.0,"I am high sensory and little pleasures are so important for me. This is what works for me:

I set my alarm to impressionist piano classics because anything else feels too harsh and makes me want to stay in bed.

Invest in an amazing showerhead.
I got one for $15 on Amazon recently and it creates mists, like the most amazing sauna experience ever.

Invest in a toothbrush that you enjoy. I use a silicone-bristle toothbrush from BOIE for $15 (you use them longer) because I like how it feels and I hate standard toothbrushes. I also use CVS coupons to splurge on really good toothpaste because I need to enjoy the process.

I also get shampoos that I really like.

It took me a bit, but I got into the habit of making my bed every morning because a clean bed quiets the chaos and overwhelm in my mind. I saw that there were tips and tricks to making your bed quickly with minimal effort. I feel the reward of feeling good about a clean bed is worth it.

I definitely have a hard time remembering to put my liners back in my mouth even though I'm supposed to wear them for 22hrs a day. There seems to be no way around this one because I don't enjoy wearing my liners. So I just set the dates on my account to an extra day longer for some grace to be myself. 

I hope this makes your experience a bit more rewarding."
