gundeals,fdon2ov,t1_fdohupa,1578608502.0,"CMMG is making a PCCs that have LRBHO, barrels that are long enough to exploit the rounds potential without being into diminishing returns territory, and a rotating bolt.

Most PCCs are straight blowback, the banshee bolt is a little different. An ar15 has a rotating bolt that is unlocked from gas pressure coming into the gas key, opening the bolt and utilizing the residual pressure to cycle the bcg. The banshee uses chamfering on the bolt lugs, that when pushed against the barrel lugs, from being fired, unlock the bolt and allow the bolt to cycle.

I'm no expert, this is just how I think it works."
news,fdn4pud,t1_fdn2gdk,1578577215.0,"From the article:

> A mass shooting is an incident involving multiple victims of firearm violence. There is no widely accepted definition of the term mass shooting. The United States' FBI defines a ""mass murder"" as ""four or more murdered during an event with no ""cooling-off period"" between the murders."" Based on this, it is generally agreed that a mass shooting is whenever four or more people are shot (injured or killed), not including the shooter(s).> 

I'm interested in how Canada's authorities define it, not how news outlets get clicks."
