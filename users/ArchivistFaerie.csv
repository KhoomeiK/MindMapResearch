suggestmeabook,feso7ld,t1_fervr9c,1579367339.0,I had a similar experience. I went through an abusive relationship in early high school and sex was a big part of the abuse and control and then I listened to it at work and had a massive anxiety attack after that scene and I can't deal with them anymore

AmItheAsshole,fcno0na,t1_fcn9rpp,1577815128.0,I had a group of friends who were like this for a decade and I didn't see it. They wanted me around just enough to make me doubt all the times they used and ignored me. It sucks but it happens pretty frequently

You seem like a really sweet man, and I'm so sorry you are hurting, I know that that's like. But I want to tell you, as someone who has been there, that you are getting help and that is the most important thing. You got out of bed today, you did your hair, and those are no small accomplishments.  Always remember that sometimes the smallest things like getting out of bed are what matter the most. If you ever need to talk I am here, and I have been through a similar thing."
