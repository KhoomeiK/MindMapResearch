>(ngl I assumed most of it was a fetish and trauma taken to the extreme)

Your vague assumption, mostly developed from being on the outskirts of it and getting what leaks out... aka the loudest thing, is due to people who are non-dysphoric saying you don't need dysphoria to be trans, and that you can be trans as a fetish (people literally say and believe this), for trauma (again, the same), or just because you feel like it. So yeah that's a major fucking problem.

It didn't used to be this way, this has been in the past 10 years alone that it's gotten like this. Nonbinary people have existed for a long time, but it was seen as a way to express gender roles (or rejection thereof), and not being trans within itself (though nb could still be trans if they experienced dysphoria.) Rejection of gender roles is something separate from being medically trans. 

The nonbinary community has had its several decade old history rewritten as well, by people co-opting it in the past 10 years. NB isn't supposed to be on the same level of trans, it's supposed to be a modifier. You can be NB and trans. You can be NB and cis. All cis means is that you don't experience dysphoria for your physical body. You can still be gender non-conforming or non-binary.

Now there's been a lot of co-opting of non-dysphoric people (aka... cis people) who have basically, in under a decade, re-written decades worth of activism and definitions in order to be considered trans for some... reason... you're free to speculate those reasons. If we say them outloud, we're labeled transphobes. Y'know. The trans people with dysphoria.... transphobes."

Some people just process things sexually. People who are trans for a fetish absolutely exist but I personally have never felt like I could single them out for who is who, because once upon a time there were people accusing me of being a 'fujoshi' and that the entire reason why I was trans was because I wanted to 'live out yaoi fantasies' or some shit. When in reality I'm just... a bi man who looked at gay porn as a teen because it was less dysphoria inducing that straight porn at the time.

 I however have personally known cis girls who catfished as men online and aren't trans at all for the exact thing I was being accused of, which is possibly the female equivalent of sissys."

honesttransgender,fey7jyv,t1_fey6r8w,1579441802.0,"Because what I'm talking about with my autistic nb peers has been a struggle with empathizing & relating to societal norms, often on their own rather than absorbed third hand from places like tumblr. And many of them seem to experience asymmetrical dysphoria of some sort, not enough to transition fully but enough to experience discomfort from sex characteristics.

It's just. Not simple is what i'm saying. The autistic experience is weird, you basically start off with none of the tools that your non-autistic peers have with regards to innately understanding social structure and empathizing and have to learn it manually by observation (and not all do, resulting in the awkward aspie stereotypes). I used to resemble a cringe autistic stereotype in my teens before I was able to better learn how to function and pass as non-autistic and have a better concept of what society expected from me. But along the way I had a lot of weird gender bumbling and that's why I'm more empathetic towards the autistic experience when it comes to understanding this shit.

If this makes. Remotely any sense whatsoever.

I hold my same criticisms of NB towards them that I do anyone but I tend to also take them more seriously because for them it stems from a genuine inner turmoil that is a part of the autistic experience, when non-autistic non-dysphoric NB people tend to honestly just be attention whores."
honesttransgender,fey6kki,t1_evfpgmy,1579441379.0,"I am like 5 months late to your question but the entire reason to cycle the hormones (estrogen / progesterone) like that is for metabolism and sex drive. Having it either one or the other 100% of the time isn't exactly desirable as you can fool the body into thinking you're pregnant (yes, even without a uterus) which results in the metabolism doing... weird shit it shouldn't, like retaining more calories than it needs. Also on a purely estrogen cycle, trans women experience very little to no sex drive. This can result in mood swings though, but for some people this simulated pms is worth the other benefits it gives. Also IIRC having a natural-mimic cycle promotes more breast growth and fat redistribution.

Anyway, when I first started T, I thought I didn't have bottom dysphoria. But a few months after it hit -- hard. And dysphoria more or less began to pile up. I had asked other trans dudes about their experiences, and it was more or less the same. My reasoning is that once you begin to transition, and your body begins to experience changes, the gendered differences in your body that you were once able to comfortably numb out now become highlighted and/or magnified.

Ultimately, what you choose to do is up to you. It's your transition, and your journey ends where you want it to end. People tell me I pass now (and I do) and I don't even have top surgery. I could just opt... to never get top surgery. I'm going to, because that's what I want for myself.

truscum,fexl0qw,t3_equwim,1579432718.0,"Social dysphoria isn't... terribly important, when it comes to being transsex. You don't get medical hormones and surgery because you experiance social dysphoria alone -- you get it because physical dysphoria.

Social dysphoria is a byproduct of gender-roles, aka what is expected culturally of men and women. These aren't based in biology or medicine even remotely whatsoever, and they have changed often throughout history. Both men and women in ancient egypt wore makeup, blue was originally a color for baby girls, and high heels were invented as a male shoe.

 No matter the changes that happen to gender roles, physical dysphoria would remain. You don't have to align with gender roles in order to experience physical, medical dysphoria.

Anyway, as for your gender identity, that's up to you I guess? There are GNC (gender non-conforming) and NB trans folks who experience gender dysphoria and transition medically to relieve said dysphoria. You do what's best for you.

If you're experiencing this level of questioning, it's probably safer to err on questioning and experimenting for a bit before doing anything rash like starting hormones or persuing surgery, though. Hormones cause permanent side effects, and surgery is, well, surgery. Experimenting is free. Transition will still be there when you've made up your mind."

I know that female socialization can kind of feel like an overwhelming death sentence at first but you were taught how to act female, you can teach yourself how to act male.

There's.... not really much more to it than that, really. Observe cis guys and imitate. Monkey see, monkey do. Masculine means a lot of different things to a lot of different people in different regions around the world, so it's best to use your judgement for what you want your version of masculinity to be, rather than doing what people tell you to online. If you're into youtube, maybe find a cis male vlogger that you give a shit enough about to watch regularly to see what he's up to to get an idea of the average cis male life (though keep in mind, 'influencers' often make their lives seem a lot more luxurious and effortless than it really is). And start your voice training now, you don't need to be on T yet to start voice training -- and voice training isn't entirely about making your voice sound deeper, T will do most of that.

Voice training is mostly about learning male mannerisms in vocal patterns, tone and cadence, how to speak from the chest, etc. This will alone will do a world of difference for making you seem more masculine, even if you like feminine things. Finding a podcast or youtube series with a lot of content where a guy speaks naturally (rather than in a hyped up, actor-y voice) is good for vocal training, because when we spend time around someone more we start to absorb their speaking patterns.

honesttransgender,fevcv8n,t3_eqok1v,1579395851.0,"The person who made me realize I was trans, back when I was 16 (i'm 28 now), detransitioned after being on T and receiving top surgery. She said she realized it was because she had hated women, and thus herself, and genuinely thought going on T would make her lose weight and help her actually like herself. I realized all the markers were there as i knew her over the years that she consistently had severe body issues and was misogynistic. 

This made me anxious and question myself as well, despite being older than her i had yet to gain access to transition, and i dealt with self hate and weight issues as well. But the thing that struck me as different is that I had never thought that transitioning would make me skinny or make me love myself. I only expected it to make me male. In fact, I often fantasized about how when i was finally male, maybe i'd finally have enough motivation to take care of my body, since I knew the source of my depression was a disconnect with my body, and not really recognizing it in its current state as mine.

So despite it, I decided to transition. And it turns out I was right. As my body has become more male, I give way more of a shit about it and have lost weight, my self esteem has improved, and I'm less depressed. While i never outright hated women like my friend, i found my relationship with them has become less strained, as they treat me as male.

This is a long winded way of saying, if the only thing you expect out of transition is becoming the opposite sex, then you're likely fine. All of the detransitioners i've seen expected something really unhealthy or unrealistic from transition, like ""finally being happy"", ""not being fat"", ""being attractive"", etc."

But the entire point of transitioning (for binary trans folk, anyway) is to transition to the other sex. And a large obstacle that binary trans people face is the general reluctance to accept us as what we say we are. I'm not transitioning to some third gender. I'm transitioning to male.

Alright. Claiming bisexuality excludes nonbinary people is inherently biphobic because that's not at all what bisexual means. If you think that, you must also believe that of literally every other sexuality. Bi means two because of two *sexes*, not two genders, because it was coined long before we had the movement of multiple genders outside the binary so gender was thought to be synonymous with sex at the time. But that doesn't mean we need a New Term to overwrite it with.

It is not More Transphobic to imply nonbinary people should be lumped under male and female, no one is fucking saying that, you are making an issue where none exists. The nonbinary community literally makes up new terms for neogenders and pronouns all the time, it shouldn't be too difficult to make up terms for new sexualities that doesn't group them in with binary men and women. 

Pansexuality is throwing an entire half of the trans community under the bus for the comfort of a group that needs a lot less activism than the other half. Y'know, the one currently struggling with the media, medical organizations, insurance companies, health care etc. While the other has no prerequisites and just identifies differently and isn't expected to change much other than that, but for some reason awards itself equal (and at times even more) leverage in trans communities, politics and activism.


Yes, nonbinary people face challenges of people not taking them and their identities seriously but these are notably separate isses from the challenges binary trans people have, which are far more involved, have far more risks (to life, health and safety), and need far more activism, focus and support. Pansexuality actively works against the end goal of having trans men and women accepted as trans men and women by putting them in arbitrary categories aside cis men and women which acts as a social wall that is essentially being put in place by a group that is only tangentially related to binary trans people.

honesttransgender,ferkqmn,t1_ferkan0,1579355161.0,"Like I said if it was kept simple I'd have been fine with it, like I was originally was, but unfortunately from witnessing the behaviors of pansexuals over the years I have seem them repeatedly lump binary trans men and women into what counts for pansexuality. It's not just for nonbinary people. They project pansexuality onto those who are involved with binary trans people, no matter if they are gay, straight or bisexual."
honesttransgender,ferjiei,t1_ferjamh,1579354688.0,I take issue with pansexuality because their actions have become synonymous with pansexuality itself and their actions actively hurt binary trans people in a way that is tangibly damaging for the acceptance of binary trans people. When a term has become synonymous with actions it becomes impossible to just ignore them. And those actions are separating binary trans people from being seen as men and women.
honesttransgender,fericsu,t1_fergq8o,1579354248.0,"You say that but that does not reflect the behavior I've seen over the years, which has largely been focused on projection and proselytizing people who do not ID as pansexual to ID as pansexual if they are interested in trans people, binary or non, as well to accuse bisexuals of being transphobic due to word etymology alone.

If it was merely that definition I'd be completely down with pansexuality, as I mentioned in my post I originally was! But unfortunately, over the years, my opinion has changed due to the behavior I have seen over and over and over again. A definition on paper doesn't mean much if people aren't willing to follow that definition, actions speak louder than words."

SapphoAndHerFriend,fdin3ee,t3_elirp0,1578446594.0,"Egyptians buried their dead with the intent of how they will live in their second life (afterlife). The believed that after death, life just... continued. They also believed that creating an object as a representation is as powerful/potent as the real thing, thus why they were buried with treasure and with murals that depicted how they wanted to live in the next life. If this mummy was buried as female, and the wrappings were made to make them look female (breasts etc) then the intent seems to me that the desire was to live as female in the next life.

So, yes, it's very likely. We'll never know for sure, but the likelihood within the context of what the egyptians believed about the afterlife, it's a good chance they were trans, or at the very least desired to change it up for some reason or another in the next life. alternative reasons could be religious reasons (possibly tied to the desire to be female) or even political reasons, it's very difficult to compare literal ancient egypt to modern day gender stuff. however the intent to live after death as female is very clear.

edit: someone mentioned more research was done on this mummy.
