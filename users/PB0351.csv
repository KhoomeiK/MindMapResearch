FinancialPlanning,ff4nyqc,t3_ergfk3,1579568234.0,"Two biggest pieces of advice I have for you are:
1- Don't panic. A mortgage might seem insurmountable right now, in the current context, with everything falling apart around you. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But the worst thing you can do is sell your house out of panic. Take a deep breath, back up, and do the math. If picking up a second job will cover the difference, do it. Don't sell the house unless you have to. There's nothing wrong with Ramen Noodles and wearing a sweatshirt around the house during the winter to save money. Taking a ~23% loss on a house is a killer. Spending half of your 20's living with your mom- while fine if it's necessary- isn't ideal either.  So stay calm, and make informed, intentional decisions. 

2- Get a lawyer. Now. The worst lawyer will mop the floor with the best non lawyer in the world. It's better to get a mediocre deal now than the fucking awful one you'll get down the road if you don't take care of this now."

Just because money isn't in a retirement account (401(k), Roth, etc.) doesn't mean it's not for their retirement.

So defining ""retirement account"" becomes very difficult, and quite possibly unfairly detrimental to the middle class.

changemyview,fehvah7,t1_fegxfvv,1579124571.0,"Let's a say a person bought a house in the 80's and it's paid off. Maybe worth $600,000 now. Now let's say this person is in their 50's, and has saved $1 million. This person is making $50k/year. This person has a net worth of $1.6 million. Fining this person based on net worth is a huge issue. This is a middle class human, who was responsible, and is setting themselves up for retirement. Now they're going to be fined as a millionaire. 

I'm not saying there's a perfect solution, but fining a flat or income based fee is a better (not perfect) solution to this problem. Sometimes there isn't a feasible perfect solution, so we need to find the best available solution.  Basing a fine on income, or having a flat fine doesn't punish the rich, but it protects the middle class. 


When it comes to a flat fine versus an income based, I prefer a flat fine. Fines should exist because breaking law X causes Y amount of damage to society. Whether a rich or poor person commits a crime, it causes the same amount of damage to society. Also, as mentioned above, fining people based on income creates an incentive to give out $100,000 fines for illegal parking instead of trying to stop violent crimes, which are not typically (obviously there are exceptions) committed by rich people, but are much more harmful to society than aforementioned illegal parking.

 All that being said, I do understand the attitude that a fine should be a deterrent. I just think the cons outweigh the pros, and we should be shooting for the best result, not necessarily the best intentions."

The free (ish) market works fine for car, home, renters', and life insurance. Why would health insurance be any different? I think health insurance should work more like other types of insurance. It shouldn't be tied to your employer, and it should be a freer market. I also don't think you should be able to be denied due to pre existing conditions. I'm not an ancap. But tying health insurance to employers takes away the individuals' right to choice in the marketplace. It especially doesn't work in a world where there are more and more gig workers. 

I think we need to fundamentally change how we look at healthcare in this country. Instead of paying $300+/month for health insurance that I'll almost never use, why can't I just have it cover catastrophic situations, and pay $50/month for something I'll almost never use? I don't use my car insurance for an oil change, and I don't use my homeowner's insurance to replace a leaky faucet. Why should I have to use health insurance for a routine check up? This takes away most of the inefficiencies of almost anything the federal government has ever run, and provides better, customized, quality care for individuals.

I think health insurance and the way we pay for healthcare needs to be rethought entirely. We should have health insurance for catastrophic injuries and diseases. I should be paying out of pocket for a physical. And as a 27 year old man, I shouldn't be forced to pay for health insurance that covers pregnancy and childbirth.

If government does something people don't like, they arrest people who don't do as they're told."

In fact, they came of age in one of the strongest economic markets in history, and rode one of the best 12 year stretches in history until the dotcom bubble burst. Also, boomers made up over 30% of the population in 1989."

Economics,fdxo0fn,t1_fdwtz00,1578771088.0,"It's important to include benefits in wage growth in some respect. Healthcare, for example, is far more expensive for employers to provide than it used to be, so that eats into what would otherwise be absolute wage growth. Obviously benefits aren't the same as dollars in employees' pockets, but they are dollars out of employers' pockets. A conversation about potential solutions will take more nuance and depth than I'm willing to type out on my phone, but when people just point to absolute wage growth compared to inflation, it only tells part of the story. We run into the same issue when measuring inflation itself as well. It's incredibly hard to quantitatively measure the increased quality of some goods compared to their cost (think a 1970 base level car vs a 2020 base level car). It's also hard to measure inflation when certain items that are all but a necessity in the modern world didn't even exist until the last 15 or so years, such as smart phones."

MurderedByWords,fdtmy7l,t1_fdtlpd1,1578719101.0,"Thank you for giving an answer!  To me it seems like there's legitimate vitriol towards the people who do want kids though.  I generally preach a live and let live attitude, so when people get upset over something that doesn't affect their daily lives, I'm curious as to why. Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, but just as I wouldn't judge someone for wanting kids, I don't think I should be judged for being pumped to be a dad.

Also, I'm a fair bit drunk, so it's more than likely I'm just being sensitive."
