Defeatism is only a factor if I'm wrong, I'm not. Ironically fact immunity is a fact you can be immune to.

For here I'll just say you're conflating a position refinement with a position change. I can get people to refine a position if I understand their core emotional belief. 

For example, waking up a greenie about nuclear power is possible because nuclear is actually better for conservationism than they think. But that's not actually a new position, they are still a conservationist.

I won't reply further here. If you don't want a full reply, that's cool, but I'm not gonna write essay length here, and trying to spoon feed and piece meal will only distort my position."

educationalgifs,fea2kk6,t1_fe6wqgp,1578943749.0,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I think they mean that lead, being matter, can be mathematically thought of as a given amount of energy (e=mc\^2), and that the energy density of the magnetar's field exceeds that energy value.

Like, if you converted lead directly into energy in the form of magnetism you'd still only have a field 1/10,000th as strong as a magnetar. To reach the right value you'd need something 10,000x more dense than lead?

All I can say is that the intensity of the thing blows my mind.

Here's another quote from the same link:

>As described in the February 2003 [*Scientific American*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American) cover story, remarkable things happen within a magnetic field of magnetar strength.
