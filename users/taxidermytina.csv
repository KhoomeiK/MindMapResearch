AskMen,ffeb7g5,t3_esruuu,1579841901.0,My husband is a cable lineman and never wears his. Degloving injuries are just too nasty to worry about it.  We both have Qalos in addition to our wedding bands and we wear those sometimes.  Mostly we skip it though.  It really is symbolic to everyone else but not to us. We are simple folks though so take it for what it's worth.

With the right antiretrovirals and proper preventative treatments you can have a very low chance of spreading the disease to a non-infected partner. The steps that we've made in the past 20 years are absolutely astounding.  Your statement was correct back in the eighties, there was almost nothing you could do and you would go from HIV positive to full-blown AIDS and there was little to be done.  It's remarkable how it has gone from a death sentence to basically a manageable chronic condition at this point."

AskReddit,fe3qvbj,t1_fe3niw4,1578852005.0,"I'm so sorry you had to go through that. That kind of loss is so traumatic and I know there's nothing I can say that can help ease that pain. We lost my husband's grandfather from a really sudden heart attack and it was horrible. I know that's not the same but that kind of loss sticks with you. 

I just want to say I really commend you for taking care of yourself and staying focused. It's really easy to lose your way and go down a rabbit hole of depression and self-destruction when you lose a loved one.  particularly at that age when you're still trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do. It sounds like you're turning into a wonderful young person who is living life to the fullest.  I'm sure he would be so proud of you!"
medizzy,fe3pexu,t1_fe2v7p5,1578851627.0,I didn't want to edit my other comment as what I said was pure speculation and I don't want to correct that and look like I changed my mind.  I did go ahead and read the case. She was in Guatemala and had the tumor for 7 years. At first she just looked very pregnant it said.  Sounds like she went to the doctor and they wanted to remove it earlier but she refused surgery initially due to personal and cultural reasons.
medizzy,fe3p0dm,t1_fe2v7p5,1578851492.0,"I suppose a lack of access to medical resources and/or the finances to help cover it. My guess is that this was going for years and this poor woman probably thought she was just overweight.

This is pure speculation on my part but maybe she was ashamed of her weight and that kept her from going to the doctor and demanding answers. When you're highly overweight you have lots of aches and pains and problems that you chalk up to just being heavy.  I could be way off base too, maybe that's just my personal experience speaking."

youseeingthisshit,fe3g7et,t1_fe2hfc1,1578849002.0,Also fair. I hate the baby talk so it's funny that this bit of linguistics doesn't bother me.

She spent the first six months of life at my house living in my kitchen cabinets, she would only come out to eat once I was in my bedroom. I used to sit in there and listen to her eat and wonder how bad her life was before she came to me. After 8 years with me she blossomed into the most friendly cat. She was sweet, she loved my dogs, and she was the biggest snuggle bug you've ever seen.  She was diagnosed with a mammary tumor about 2 years ago and the vet told me she likely wouldn't survive surgery. We opted to not have the surgery because I didn't want her last days to be painful.
