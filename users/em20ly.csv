relationship_advice,fey8vqm,t1_fey8jv5,1579442256.0,Thank you so much! And thanks for the advice
relationship_advice,fey8k0b,t1_fexhp0p,1579442114.0,Thank you for your advice anyway. I’m going to speak with her today and talk through some things
relationship_advice,fey8cjq,t1_fexlzub,1579441997.0,You both make really good points. My church definitely is a little on the crazy side and I didn’t realize that until talking about the sermons we’ve had with other people. I do want to try another church. Hopefully with an open mind and a blank slate
relationship_advice,fey7rs0,t1_fexj3dj,1579441896.0,"You make a good point. If I do decide it’s just something I can’t do, I’ll talk to her about it"
relationship_advice,fey7kg9,t1_fexuwi6,1579441807.0,"That’s a really good point. I’m going to talk to her about understanding the way I’ve been brought up and how how even though there are things I want to feel and believe with religion, it’s been hard and it probably always will be"
relationship_advice,fey7an2,t1_fexz0nh,1579441704.0,I’ve thought about that a little. I’m not entirely sure how I’ll feel about it. But I know our kids won’t be forced into anything religious like I was. I won’t let it happen
TrueOffMyChest,fcw3njd,t3_ej2mi5,1578016397.0,"Sorry for your loss. You may not have met him face to face, but you knew him, and that’s what counts more than anything. Wishing you the best man"
running,fcvm8ol,t3_eiybyc,1578005123.0,Pain management. I rotated a disc in my back a little over 3 months ago. The chiropractor didn’t help too much. I picked up jogging to get in shape and found it’s a great way to manage my back pain!
quit_vaping,fckwcfa,t1_fckqx2u,1577734604.0,Thank you!
depression,fc6d16f,t1_fc5j4pl,1577477694.0,"Same for me. I didn’t have a hard time with my memory until probably the last year and a half. I’ve had a considerable amount of life changes in that time and didn’t know if that had anything to do with it, but I’ve also had some of my worst depressive episodes in the past 2ish years."
depression,fc6cvtm,t1_fc5v0w5,1577477596.0,I’m almost the opposite. When i attempt to forget something I seem to remember it more. I personally wish i remembered more of school because it’s where I’ve made most of my good memories.
depression,fc6cr0v,t1_fc5kw67,1577477510.0,I definitely can relate to that. I don’t have too many traumatic memories as I’ve had a pretty good childhood aside from my mom going kinda crazy and being a helicopter in the past few years. When something bad happens I immediately begin to forget about it and have forgotten details within a few minutes. I’ve gotten in a few arguments with my girlfriend before and have forgotten things she’s said within 10 minutes of saying them.
getting_over_it,fc4y2w8,t3_eg5z0v,1577433412.0,Wishing you you the best. I don’t remember where i found it but i will pm it to you if i’m able to stumble across it again. It was a list of fast food restaurants that offer free or discounted meals to young children. I’m not sure how old your babies are but this could benefit them in the future if not now. Good luck and god bless!
depression,f25iw5l,t3_dc1uud,1569975681.0,"""A worthy one"" I like that. You're a trooper."
