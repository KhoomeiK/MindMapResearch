toddlers,feoal77,t3_eppii1,1579297362.0,"Oh hugs that is a really hard thing to go through.   


My MIL, and our only local family, went through Chemo when our oldest was a baby and got really sick at one point when he was still a toddler. It was really hard on her not getting to see him (she was used to taking care of him one day a week and also spending lots of time with him) when she was sick. We had to take her to the ER and she could only facetime him for a while. He doesn't remember her being sick. And now she's in remission and doing great and they have lots of play time together. 

My youngest, the toddler, seems to understand Facetime the more we use it (my 4yo expects facetime with all calls at this point due to family not living nearby). It's not easy now for you but know that your girl will love you no matter what. You just need to try to focus on getting healthy.

I hope you get better soon and I'm sure that keeping her routine as normal as possible (otherwise) will continue to help. Just focus on getting well."

Lots of good recommendations here. But mainly, learn to talk about what your feelings are at the moment infront of them so you can be the example. Its not easy to give them the words but that's how they learn.  


Also read more childrens books on kindergarten to your little one. That's a big change, and maybe she's feeling unsure and alone about it which is why all the accidents happened (per what I read in the thread).

AskHistory,feahnh4,t3_eo8el4,1578948911.0,"According to [this article](https://www.edweek.org/ew/projects/how-history-class-divides-us.html) there are 3 publishers of history text books in the US. ( In a survey by the Education Week Research Center, principals named 34 different core texts for high school U.S. History, though most came from just three publishers. ) 

BUT each state has it's own idea of what students need to be taught, benchmarks that need to be met, and there's a board that decides that. And each teacher will teach as they want within their own district's bounds. I live in Texas now and that same article mentions:  

""Take the original alternative fact in U.S. history: the Lost Cause, and [how its mythology led to the ruinous teaching of the Civil War](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/02/07/how-is-slavery-taught-in-us-schools.html) and the Reconstruction for more than a century.  Texas’ 2010 standards misrepresented the causes of the conflict, listing sectionalism, states’ rights, and tariffs alongside slavery—even though the historical evidence is indisputable that slavery was the cause animating all the others. (The state school board has given preliminary approval to revise that language.) ""

I went to school in Indiana many years ago and had varied levels of education on US and World history, comparative to the states around me. I was taught that the civil war happened because of the divisions in this country over Slavery.

Thankfully my history classes ignited a spark of curiosity and I read up on it on my own time now that I'm an adult."
