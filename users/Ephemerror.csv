The normies have simply gotten institutionalized to their life of slavery through decades of continuous forced conditioning in the school systems since the start of their lives, and have now been thoroughly broken into a tax generating working animal."

Anthropology,fewx99m,t1_fewr5hp,1579420894.0,"The ponds are the traps/holding pen, the landscape itself has been converted into a system of fish traps, allowing water from streams to be brought into ponds then cut off, similar to an irrigation channel, trapping fish in them; it is the same mechanism as the tidal fish traps which uses the tide to bring in water and fish.

The animals harvested are wild and there is no rearing process involved, so i don't think it can be considered to be a form of aquaculture, which by definition is ""the rearing of aquatic animals or the cultivation of aquatic plants for food""."
