steelseries,fexyuzy,t1_fexidj2,1579438495.0,"The main issue is that this has occurred 5-10 times or so while I have owned the headset for years, so it's hard to reproduce this issue, and as it happens quite rarely so using the headset with another device isn't really helping me."

StarWars,feg5zlf,t3_eoxh47,1579078536.0,"This is the way! - I was just about to say this haha, but seriously this drawing has a very nice atmosphere, it reminds me of the artworks shown at the end of the Mandalorian episodes, they're usually looking very interesting and surpasses the finished episodes, it seems hard to capture the same emotion/style when the camera rolls."
