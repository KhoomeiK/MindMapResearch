running,fesknzk,t1_ferj2il,1579366213.0,I’ve not began my running yet but I think my problem would be I can’t pass by dogs without a pet. It’s literally my worst habit that my other half mostly (begrudgingly) deals with. Need to avoid the routes with dog walkers 😂
AmItheAsshole,fe9y3f6,t3_eo33vy,1578942483.0,NTA. This is absolutely the most rank thing I have ever read in my life. If someone had to do that to my kettle I’d be demanding a new one!! Your girlfriend is an arsehole for thinking it’s alright!
aww,fdlgah0,t3_elxvtw,1578523391.0,So cute 😍 very well done on the training!
AmItheAsshole,fcx7j3l,t3_ej7yr5,1578054389.0,"I’m finding it hard to judge this. Mostly because I have autistic children and I would want them to be there if I got married but I know how hard it is for my kids to be in certain social situation and how it affects them. 

The thing is you say melt downs aren’t that long “only 30 mins” which to me is pretty long. To be that stressed out, overwhelmed and unable to cope. Honestly, you have to ask yourself if that seem fair on your sister. And if it’s loud noises and crowds is there at any point where that’s not going to be a thing and your sister will get reprieve from being in that state? 

I do agree that it’s important to have her involved so why not keep your wedding attire and get her a nice dress which goes with your wedding theme and have separate photos done just the three of you (or the wedding party -groom side and bride side) and get photos done. Even have a special wedding thing like a necklace someone said above with a dinner. 

But NTA for wanting her involved. Just maybe have to rethink it a little

Good luck and congrats 🙂"

AmItheAsshole,fcq8ew6,t3_eif98x,1577880920.0,"YTA. As someone who’s been going to all different kid of gigs since the age of 13 it would seem obvious not to stand in the middle of the room but you stated she doesn’t like the same music as you and she’s never been to a gig before meaning she had absolutely no idea and you didn’t have the foresight to warn her. 

The first time I found myself in a pit I was absolutely petrified and thankfully came out unharmed but your - probably now ex girlfriend - was hurt and if that was me in her shoes I’d have been pissed to. 

 As for the whole “ultimate buzz” is people pitting. The ultimate buzz is people enjoying the music and walking away unharmed looking forward to the next show. I’ve been on the side of the stage you’ve been on and I have friends from bigger bands and smaller ones and anytime there’s a fast and heavy song there’s always a warning of some sort even if it’s a “our next song is a fast and heavy one. Perfect for pitting, so open it up or clear out” and with that those who aren’t wanting to be in that situation hits the sides. 

It’s not just about your girlfriend either in this because that could have been anyone that was a fan and they are hurt. As everyone else said the bigger bands have been known to stop and check on their fans, wait till their safe and has even has said things like “if you see someone struggling look out for each other” which is something you forgot to do for her."
aww,fcnx20b,t3_ehygcw,1577820146.0,He’s so proud of him 😍😍 I love this so much!
AmItheAsshole,fb27cca,t3_eb34e9,1576446443.0,"Ok so I get how she feels in some senses. I do get it I’m a dog owner of 3 doggos and I love them more than anything in the world and I won’t part with my dogs ever. To me they are family and a dog isn’t just for Christmas and all that jazz but there is degrees of separation needed. 

My dogs are in a different room to sleep and eat. I regularly go out without them (work)  because I don’t and never have wanted them to have separation anxiety, they should be able to cope being alone. 

Yep, dogs can get jealous and I was worried about that when I moved in with my partner and my step kids but they see it as another wee person to love them and that’s what kids grow up to be, sometimes even being their favourite human. 

I think how she is with her dog is unhealthy..And that’s coming from the crazy dog lady who can not pass a dog without clapping it and getting kisses and love from them 😂

I’d have chosen to reword how you said it but NTA over wanting her to give boundaries from the dog."
