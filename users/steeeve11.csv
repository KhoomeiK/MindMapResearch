If it gets out of my control or becomes too scary I can say “no” and it pauses then changes. I almost always base them on what I’ve been watching/reading most recently.

I busted him chewing on one of those foam earplugs and there was a packet of them on the floor that he’d pulled off the bedside table. I took it away and tossed it since it was ruined and put the packet in a draw. I thought that would be the end of it.

Cut to the next day. We’re out on our morning walk and he’s having a little trouble pooping. He keeps squatting and straining while walking in circles but nothing is happening. Then suddenly an earplug pops out followed by his poop. The little stinker had corked himself from the inside XD

He was fine after that btw."

The thing about Australia is that it has a lot of small and unique ecosystems that only thrive in certain locations. If these locations are completely wiped out by the fires then that little bit of uniqueness is gone forever.
ImaginaryAstronauts,fe0ai3f,t1_fdzdm6a,1578807775.0,">!So basically Mark Watney is stuck on Mars, he’s trying to get to this other base site that’s miles and miles away and he’s puttering along in this space truck (can’t remember what’s it’s called). The people back at mission control (MC) are tracking him with satellites but they have no way of communicating with him. They can see on their screen that he’s heading into a dust storm but he has no idea. The problem is that his truck thing is solar powered and the dust will block the sun. The thing about dust storms on Mars is that because of the gravity and atmosphere they move very slowly and sometimes you don’t notice that you’re walking into one. They can also be super wide. So at first Watney has no idea that he’s puttering along to his doom and MC just has to sit back and watch it. Eventually he realises that his solar panels aren’t getting as much of a charge as usual and figures it out and comes up with a plan. Basically, he figures out which direction the storm is going and travels in the opposite direction to get through it quicker. My nightmare scenario is that he didn’t escape. That he got stuck in the middle of the storm, unable to see past his own helmet, totally lost until he runs out of food, water, heat or air and dies all alone with MC watching from afar.!<"

Mum was older and couldn’t always handle the steeper hills so I’d have to carry her up some of them. She was a little hefty but I didn’t mind.

Then Little Bro hurt his leg. He was lighter so I didn’t mind carrying him for the walk and letting him down to sniff and pee on things when he showed interest.

This worked. Except for the steep hills.

So I had to carry two Shih Tzus while walking another one that also wanted to be carried because she was now feeling left out.
