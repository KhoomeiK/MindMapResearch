kittens,ff7us3j,t3_ery8k5,1579658857.0,This little guy is older than 4 weeks; his eyes have already changed colour. Probably more like 7-8 weeks. Very cute regardless of his age though!
asktransgender,ff7jabm,t3_es2637,1579650872.0,"On an institutional level, no. But I think in an abstract sense, yes. I'd be interested in exploring the concept of transmisandry more, but the term 'misandry' has been so tarred by MRA-types that I feel like it's difficult to do."
FTMMen,ff7imvn,t3_es2urm,1579650428.0,"Yes, I get so itchy! Not in the same way you do with the hot flashes, but my scalp is so itchy, and so is my skin. Idk if it's the acne, or what. It's annoying though."
FTMMen,ff2eye5,t1_ff2es97,1579503325.0,I get my levels monitored every few months; they're well within male ranges and my E levels are also good. I'm on as high of a dose as I can handle; any more gives me migraines. I guess it's just a time thing.
plantclinic,feock1p,t1_feo57ee,1579298194.0,"I ended up googling it, and I'm pretty sure they're pumpkin sprouts. That's so weird! I got it from a very large nursery though, so I guess it's fully possible some pumpkin seeds fell in there somehow... they probably grew because I finally watered the plant again."
plantclinic,feo3a73,t3_eq6cbs,1579294583.0,"First off: I know the plant isn't looking so hot. I need to pull it out of the nursery pot and remove some leaves. I actually went to go check on it tonight because of that, only to find two of these bean sprout looking things popping out of it?

I googled snake plant flowers, and none of them look like this... though at the same time, I can't really think of what else they could be. They're so weird. Also they weren't there yesterday! They sprang out of the earth in 24 hours.

plantclinic,fel7qij,t1_fel6zcn,1579215873.0,"Yeah, the info out there varies from 'might make them throw up' to 'can kill them'... good to know in your case it was nothing too serious!"
plantclinic,fel6e5d,t3_eppufg,1579215037.0,"Others have covered plant care, but sansevierias are quite toxic to kitties. I'm not sure if they've consumed any or just ripped it apart, but I would keep an eye on them just in case."
BeautyGuruChatter,feco1sk,t1_fecmmpd,1578978783.0,And your authority on that subject is?
BeautyGuruChatter,fecifbn,t1_fecenkf,1578974680.0,Love that delicious transphobia in a post lifting up a trans woman. Are you even trans yourself?
BeautyGuruChatter,fec9g8f,t1_febzjdy,1578969019.0,"'Trans' just means that you don't identify with your assigned sex. Non-binary people don't; therefore they are trans. There are however some NB people who choose not to identify with the trans label, but that's their own choice."

oddlysatisfying,fdzvzsq,t1_fdyx9be,1578797121.0,"Marzipan is an acquired taste. My brother loves it but I think it tastes awful. If you like amaretto, you'll probably like it."
asktransgender,fdztw1q,t3_engxf1,1578795680.0,"I'm still relearning, and my voice is still actively changing, so it's an adjustment. However, it's been fun. There are songs I can't sing anymore, but there are new songs I *can* sing that I didn't used to be able to sing. Just keep singing throughout!"
plantclinic,fdys7qp,t1_fdyroxr,1578783026.0,My city's tap water is reaaaally hard and also chlorinated. Minerals do build up in the soil eventually but I just flush it and it's okay.
aww,fdyr7du,t1_fdy981l,1578782776.0,"Just be warned that they do show clips from the videos. Not the actual killing, but the aftermath, yes. I had to look away from it."
plantclinic,fdyqjeb,t1_fdyeqzi,1578782526.0,"I see this, but I water all of my plants with tap water and they all seem to be fine. Isn't it just certain fussy plants that need to be watered with distilled water, like calatheas and peace lilies?"
Catswhoyell,fdogz6r,t3_em9yc5,1578604948.0,Oh my god this sounds exactly like my cat every time we have to put her in the car. Hell even just the carrier. Her wails can be heard for miles and they never stop. This is hilarious.
KneadyCats,fdlfp3r,t1_fdkib3c,1578523025.0,"Yes! It's disgusting but I can't be mad, it's so cute. She's actually on my lap doing it right now lol."

asktransgender,fd5u9d8,t3_ek4kcs,1578181577.0,Don't want children. Have never wanted children. Gonna get my reproductive organs yeeted ASAP.
asktransgender,fd5m649,t3_ek1era,1578178971.0,"Lack of support from my parents, and a psychiatrist who laughed at me and told me I couldn't possibly be trans because I wore dresses when I was a child. 

After that I suppressed it hard, because if everyone around me, including professionals, told me I couldn't be trans, then obviously I wasn't."
ftm,fd5bf6b,t1_fd4xfo7,1578175974.0,for me it's the thought of there being something inside my veins for that long that freaks me the heck out
asktransgender,fcrmh2n,t3_eiln4i,1577903735.0,"Only until after I started to physically transition tbh. Even then it took me 4-5 months for it to stop completely. Sometimes I still stumble over calling myself my cat's dad instead of mom. 

I think part of it had to do with me thinking I didn't 'deserve' the right pronouns, even in my own head. But it's a huge change; you've been thinking of yourself one way for your entire life, of course it's gonna take some time to get used to something new. Nothing to worry about imo. : )"
dataisbeautiful,fcrm0e7,t1_fcr3dbo,1577903566.0,I've pooped only once every 2-3 days since I was a toddler. Neither my RN mom nor my doctor who I've been seeing my entire life have ever seen it as an issue. Everyone is different indeed.
aww,fcofhf5,t1_fcobkhc,1577830970.0,"My cat is so weird when it comes to this. I bought her a fountain, but she refused to drink from it. She will only drink from her dish, and she drinks a lot. The other cats I've had like to drink from fountains, but not her. Dish only. Well, that and bathtub water."
asktransgender,fcjkdqu,t3_ehgzbq,1577691133.0,"I have been feeling a little bit of this lately and it worries me. I feel guilty about it. I don't regret anything and I'm much happier but I do miss parts of my life pre-transition. I miss my longer hair. I miss being able to be 'pretty'. I miss not having to worry about my laugh or my voice and I really miss boots and leggings, lol. Oh well."
asktransgender,fcjk1i3,t1_fcjhr4e,1577690714.0,"agreed. it's always seemed odd to me that it's okay and encouraged to discuss the effects of female socialization on trans men, but the opposite is shut down sight unseen"
asktransgender,fcjjvwj,t1_fciyqa1,1577690523.0,"especially since it seems so common and accepted to discuss how many trans men have absorbed female socialization (and I don't even think this shouldn't be discussed or isn't true; it's the case for me)

it's a touchy subject, and one marred by TERFs and reactionaries, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be discussed imo

obviously not all trans people have experienced socialization in the same way but I don't think completely shutting down the discussion is a good thing"
asktransgender,fcjjmek,t1_fcj0zz1,1577690199.0,"it's 100% the same sad, angry trans dude that makes new accounts every week to post the same sad, angry shit, and then pretend that he has 0 idea why he's getting banned for ban evasion."
ftm,fcjjgka,t3_eha374,1577690002.0,for me it's not so much about the childhood as it is the adolescence/young adulthood. not sure if I'll ever get over that tbh. feel like I've missed out on too much life that I'll never get back.
asktransgender,fcgsp0z,t1_fcgestr,1577643619.0,"> It doesnt matter if you hate your job, TRUST ME hating your job beats poverty and no insurance every day!

god, this is dismal"
FTMMen,fcdapts,t3_eh1q29,1577608306.0,"I've had a massive inferiority complex with my older brother since before I even knew I was trans. Fortunately almost none of it has to do with appearances. My brother is 5'10"" (I am 5'5"") and decently muscular but the only thing I've ever been physically jealous of is his eyebrows lol. I just have classic 'younger sibling of a genius' issues. 

Now, next to some of my friends? Dang the dysphoria and jealousy is real."
FTMMen,fccs87x,t3_egya75,1577602018.0,I did personally have a little bit of growth within the first couple of weeks and it unfortunately seems to have capped off at 2 months. I didn't get that much...but maybe I'll be lucky and it'll grow again some more later. I'm only at around 10 months.
kittens,fc9xxp5,t3_egly7y,1577559861.0,"She looks so, so soft. What a sweet little girl."
FTMMen,fc7v1jd,t3_eglgv8,1577519377.0,"Yeah, this happened to me too, but most of it is on my shoulders. It's gnarly. Hoping it goes away soon. I've been washing my shoulders/chest with my SA face wash and it's helped a bit."
FTMMen,fc6q44l,t3_eghr3p,1577486644.0,Wet wipes! They were a life saver for the first week after surgery when I couldn't shower. Ask your parents if you can have a step stool or something to rest your feet on in the bathroom; it helps to more comfortably relieve yourself after surgery. Otherwise try and stock up on pillows to more comfortably prop yourself up/keep yourself from rolling over in your sleep.
FTMMen,fc4sfd4,t3_eg2wno,1577426676.0,"My grafts were a little bit gnarly for about 4 weeks. I was paranoid about them too. They kept weeping (I went to the doctor and he said it was normal, just 'serosang') for about 3 weeks, but I think that was because I kept applying bandages with Polysporin. As soon as I stopped doing that and just let them hang out for the hour I was allowed to take my post-op binder off (and then just put dry bandages on afterwards) they cleared up quicker. The scabs faded from red to just white skin and I was terrified that meant it was going to fall off, but it was just the dead skin. I was able to carefully remove it (no pulling, just peeling it without any force) and it was okay. 

As long as it doesn't hurt/isn't infected (like another poster said, oozing, hot, painful, bad smell, or a fever) it's probably okay, but if you're really worried, it doesn't hurt to go to the doctor. That's what I did when I was worried."
FTMMen,fc3lwnc,t3_ef94a1,1577392808.0,"Are you in pain or just really uncomfortable? I wasn't in much pain after surgery but I was sooo uncomfortable, so I feel you. It was really hard to get a good sleep because I was a side sleeper, and the post-op binder was so bothersome, just in terms of the sensation and the pressure. But by 2 weeks everything was much better. I was allowed to sleep on my side by then (actually they gave me the clear 1 week post-op but I still found it too uncomfortable) and could have regular bandages instead of the puffy dressings underneath the binder. It was really rough, but it will get better!

And like other posters have said, if you're truly in a lot of pain, definitely consult your surgeon or a doctor. That shouldn't be the case.

Good luck man, you've got this! Also if you feel like you need to cry, just go for it. I'd feel a lot better after a good sob lol."
aww,fc3kz2x,t1_fc30vmf,1577392153.0,"I think it's true that they're majority male, but I wouldn't say 'almost always'. I've met a lot of female orange tabbies, including my own. It's not like calicos where there's an infinitesimal chance of having a male one."
FTMMen,fbygse1,t3_ef1npn,1577216511.0,honestly I just trim with scissors. Nothing fancy. Wish it was easier to get the ass hair though
