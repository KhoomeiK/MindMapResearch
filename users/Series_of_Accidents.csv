He had problems walking when he was older, and he would pee while he walked because his bladder control was failing him at the end. But he was our protector. So every night, he would struggle to walk up the steps (big German Shepherd, not carrying weight) and stand guard over our rooms. He would walk to a door, stay in front of it for a half hour or so, and move to the next. Around midnight or so, he'd move to the top of the stairs and spend the rest of the night guarding the only access point to his humans. I miss him so much. We don't deserve dogs. But we're so lucky to have them."

>Incest between adults is a felony, punishable by five years’ to life imprisonment, depending on state law. Incest against children is punished just as severely, if not more so, as other cases of child sexual abuse, usually by lengthy prison terms or life in prison.

It really took everyone in the car by shock. 

The two nuances I missed were a) we weren't cut off, my mom let them in and b) my Gramma was in the car. Don't swear in front of Gramma. I didn't swear again until I was maybe ten. At that point, I asked permission to swear, which I'm sure was just adorable."

In every class we had papers (all of the psych classes and probably four of the stats classes), tests, and projects. During my second year, I did a qualifying project (to qualify for candidacy). It took three months of running a data simulation and writing essentially a Master's thesis. I did get my PhD at an R1, so maybe it's just a rigor difference, but I'm surprised you didn't have papers, projects, or tests. I mean, I did for my Master's as well, and it definitely wasn't at an R1. What field are you in?"

Hell, I was visiting a friend and had a stomach ache. I told his 4 year old that I felt crummy. He did a little happy dance when I started feeling better because even kids that young understand healthy people are happier and more likely to play with you.

If you are being seen at a crisis pregnancy center, they could be targeting you as a source for a baby. That is a common practice and they make big money on targeting vulnerable young women. 

I still think adoption sounds like the best option for you, but please understand how limited your rights are once the adoption is finalized. And be wary of those crisis pregnancy centers. They aren't there to help you, they serve the future parents who pay big bucks, and they will not hesitate to lie to you.

It took a while before I finally asked the first uncut guy I'd been with if he just had really loose penis skin, or if he was uncircumcised. Depending on your age, a large percentage of those women might have never seen an actual uncut penis in person. When it's hard, it's similar enough that you notice it's a little different, but not as different as you expected for an uncut dick. So you just don't say anything.

Regardless, uncut cocks for the win. Parents, don't mutilate your kid's genitals. Some women prefer cut, others don't. But *everyone* should prefer consent, and babies can't consent to cosmetic surgery."

relationship_advice,fcc4ih4,t3_egsehb,1577594321.0,"I wanted to comment on your concerns about schizophrenia and your mental health. Detailed, visual hallucinations are incredibly rare in people with schizophrenia. The most common hallucinations are auditory. 

Hynogogic hallucinations (hallucinations in the time just before falling asleep or just after waking) are a possibility, but they're also not super detailed. 

I think you need to find an adult you trust and talk to them. Your best friend's mom or dad, a pastor, a teacher, a neighbor. Just some adult who you know is on your side. Try not to go to an adult who you know is friends with your mom or dad. Trying to catch your dad in the act again could take a long time. He's just been caught, so he'll probably take some time off. Might even dispose of some evidence in the meantime. Your best bet is to talk to a trusted adult ASAP.

I'm really sorry you're going through this. Sometimes the people we're supposed to be able to trust the most just do not stand up to even the most basic standards of decency. You deserve much, much better."
