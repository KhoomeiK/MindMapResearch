RagenChastain,ff5n34v,t3_ers25z,1579601168.0,I just want to highlight that she describes “a short walk” has made her recognize that she is vastly out of shape.
AmItheAsshole,fer52y3,t1_feppyhh,1579349960.0,"Yeah, I can see how that might happen. With my clients, we discuss the purpose of having the person in session and what we hope to accomplish. Depending on the client, I might reiterate that this is not couples therapy, or that I’m not doing therapy with the other person. 

Usually having someone else in session is for the purpose of education or because someone wants support while discussing a certain topic."
AmItheAsshole,fepg0pg,t1_feod8ag,1579319566.0,"Lmao you are inferring a lot of information based on that statue; there is nothing in there that says a session including partners/family members is unethical. 

It would only be unethical/illegal under privacy laws if the OP did not agree... Which isn’t in question here at all.

Also, as a LICSW, my clients are welcome to bring whomever they want into a session. I won’t allow it consistently because it interferes with their treatment, but it can be helpful or productive."
illnessfakers,fejxslw,t1_fejtszj,1579188287.0,"Yes, that’s accurate. I’m a (psycho)therapist - licensed independent clinical social worker - but anyone and everyone uses the term therapist, including physical therapists, massage therapists, and respiratory therapists. Kind of annoying since I have to specify what “kind” of therapy I do because so many people throw out the term without a qualifier or any real qualifications."

todayilearned,fd6i9fm,t1_fd5xvyc,1578191446.0,"Pretty messed up. My Explorer program made sure that our uniforms were different from real uniforms and had “EXPLORER” written on the back. They did this for liability and also our safety.

We still had a few explorers who got in trouble for impersonating cops!"
fatlogic,fcgg5en,t1_fceydv6,1577639637.0,Thanks so much!!!
fatlogic,fceq9n3,t1_fccdr7i,1577622827.0,"You’re so sweet, thank you!"
fatlogic,fcbh2tn,t3_egrqt2,1577586779.0,Today I ran the furthest I’ve ever run before: 10 miles. Maybe a half marathon isn’t that lofty of a goal?! I’m very excited about my running journey since being hospitalized in May/June. Progress!
truechildfree,fc7919o,t3_egiy76,1577500734.0,This is exactly how I feel about my one dog. I get irritated so easily and hate the routine and necessity when caring for a dog. It’s also harder to make travel plans and I feel guilty leaving him home alone all day. It’s these simple things that make me sit back and think that I can’t - and don’t want to - handle everything that comes with having a kid.
RagenChastain,fbc7i22,t1_fbbgle0,1576717518.0,"All of this. Mostly I’m just amazed by the lack of effort and thought in each of her blog posts: they’re always so short and simply touch on each topic at the surface-level. 

I have the same thoughts. What, exactly, does she do with all of her free time? What does she contribute to society at an individual or systemic level? Absolutely nothing."
