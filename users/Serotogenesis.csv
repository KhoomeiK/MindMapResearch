You wear magic underwear.

do bizarre temple ceremonies that used to include getting naked other than a poncho, getting touched all over with oil, and miming slitting your stomach/throat while promising to get revenge for Joe Smitty. 

you don't drink coffee, tea, or alcohol which is a reinterpretation from when you used to not drink hot chocolate/soup/hot drinks but were fine with beer/wine. 

You have secret handshakes that you need to get into heaven in combination with a ""new name"" password that until a couple years ago was based on the calendar date you went through the temple (can't wait for the sum of humanity in heaven to have about 31 names per gender total).

You're convinced lgbt people have a disease. Your previous leaders claimed masturbation made you gay. Speaking of which, you think jerking off and pre-marital sex are some of the most horrible sins that can be committed next to murder which is fucked in its own way. You used to electrocute gay people in the basement of byu to try to turn them straight.

You must give 10% of your income to the corporation or else you don't get to go do your weird ass temple ceremonies to get saved.

You require all men go on a 2 year mission designed to indoctrinate missionaries further and convince young men that it's them vs the world when in reality it's just that people know how weird and creepy your cult is.

You show up whenever you get brought up on reddit and have to act like you're just misunderstood and the world is persecuting you when people are just aware of all the above.

You put off this used car salesman type of niceness while being mean as fuck to anyone who's left your cult. Few ever return and that's something that you rationalize as Satan grabbing people whereas in reality it's just that there's so much obvious historical evidence that you belong to a cult and willfully peddle bullshit that it becomes obvious to anyone who escapes to not come back.

You think oil and prayers have magic powers when they clearly don't have a success rate above the usual population/modern medicine.

Nearly all of you vote republican and believe Jesus was white. You think that native americans are dark because god cursed them with a skin of blackness after the ""white and pure"" members of america began to sin.

Uh, so most of my life issues are built around growing up mormon and all the weirdness that's caused. Had my fair share of other mental issues growing up involving depression, anxiety, and mood swings.

At a fundamental level, tripping temporarily removes a lot of the connections you've made between different concepts/ideas/real life things and lets you reexamine them from a new perspective. A lot of people talk about how tripping makes them feel like a kid or gives them new thoughts and perspectives. This can go a little too far where something that seems profound while tripping isn't that profound.

As far as activities, you're going to find nearly anything entertaining or amusing during it. But I'd have a selection of albums to check out, movies to watch that have good vibes to them, nature to explore, lights/sounds to play with, and other activities you enjoy while not tripping available. First few times you won't be comfortable around people or in public and that's ok. As you get better at doing it, straight up going to museums or the movies becomes possible. 

There's a lot more I could get into but it's hard to explain it all. I highly recommend using the site erowid.org or reddit to search for ""trip reports"" and read about the good ones, the bad ones, and everything in-between (I'd try to focus on the good ones mostly though).

Tripping taught me to forgive myself for a lot of past mistakes and forgive a lot of people in my life who inadvertently caused me pain. It showed me how beautiful the world and life is with things I used to take for granted. It shows you that common place things are still magical and shows you just how malleable our life and experiences are. I truly think if everyone in this world tried lsd or mushrooms at least once and mdma (molly, ecstasy if you go by the straight mdma definition), the world would be a much better place where everyone respects one another."

1- it won't work if you're on SSRIs or you'll need a very high dose

2- mindset and setting are the two biggest things with tripping that you'll want to have some semblance of control over. Be able to stay in or go outside as you please, don't trip around assholes, and mentally prepare for the trip as best you can

3- related to the previous point, I recommend you do a lot of reading on different experiences before tripping to prepare. Doesn't hurt to have benzos on hand to chill you out if shit gets hairy

4- you'll see a lot of people saying to not trip if you're depressed or anxious. This isn't 100% true but it does mean you should be more careful and make sure you've got someone you trust to trip sit along with some activities planned

Seriously though, there are few things as powerfully life changing as a psychedelic experience. I wouldn't be the person I am today without them in my life. Cured a hell of a lot of trauma I dealt with."
