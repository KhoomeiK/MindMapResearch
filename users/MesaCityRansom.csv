There have been incidents, but they were always explained after the fact. Like the time I was a kid and was absolutely certain I heard someone getting murdered outside and it turned out to be an asshole fox screaming.

The closest thing I've ever had happen was one day when I had to get up super early, so I had saved leftovers from the night before to eat for breakfast to get psyched up. I got up and the plate was in the fridge, but was empty. My wife swears she didn't eat it and I know I didn't eat it, but I also know she ate it."

AskReddit,ff99omi,t1_ff95koy,1579708040.0,"Talking/asking about how the day has been going is usually a good start for more casual conversation, and if you look for them there are normally many talking points that never get picked up. ""Yeah it's been fine, had a rough customer earlier though"" -> ""oh no, that sucks! What did they do? / oh yeah i feel that, used to work in retail myself"". From that example, there are many ways to go down.

And I don't think many people would take offense to that. Just make sure to keep it light until you've talked for a bit and feel like you're getting a good response."

To be fair, I've been playing Magic since like 2001 and every single standard rotation I've heard people complain that they can't use their decks anymore. So while not factually wrong, it's a very old issue and one there isn't really anything to do about if you want to play standard. Rotation is not a bug of the format, it's a feature.

Edit: also, it's been ""cool"" to complain about Magic forever. Ever heard the saying that if Wizards put 20-dollar bills in boosters, people would complain that they were folded wrong? I heard that the first time over ten years ago."

worldnews,fef78tj,t1_feexde0,1579049835.0,"I'll try to offer some hope. I'm from southern Sweden, and around a year ago the leading politicians in our city said that they wanted to sell our city-owned power plant/company to a private actor. This caused a massive uproar, with local activists organizing a massive protest campaign. They managed to drum up such a storm that the sale was put up to a public vote, with a promise that if at least 51% of the total population of eligible city inhabitants voted against the sale, it wouldn't happen. That's an absurdly high number for a local public vote, by the way, they rarely hit over 30%.

But the activists rose to the challenge and kicked their information campaign into overdrive, with hundreds of volunteers helping out. The vote was this Sunday, and ""no sale"" got 96,4% of the vote. 96,4%! And participation turned out to be 50,06% - absolutely astonishing but just shy of the targetted 51%. But luckily, the politicians still listened and declared the next day that the sale would be aborted.

I know it's not the same at all but I just wanted to share because I'm really proud of my community and it's also proof that not all hope is lost. People can be stirred into action."

Documentaries,fdnyh36,t1_fdns4it,1578595414.0,"No, /u/h2man said ""bullies have usually been bullied"". That's what I was commenting on. My wife's dad was abused, so he became abusive to her. Then she became abusive (not towards me specifically, in general) until she actively decided she didn't want to go down that path. Even then, with active strenuous effort she stills slips back sometimes. She didn't ""start"" anything, her part of the cycle started with her as a victim. A lot of bullies, but not all of them, I know, have the same experience.

Unless I completely misunderstood you in which case I'm sorry."
