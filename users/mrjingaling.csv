So here are your two options, one: give up on her and reverse what you made a ""mistake"" on. Two: give it a chance and see what happens. Attraction doesn't always occur overnight or instantly, sometimes it takes time. This is my last tidbit n I'll leave you alone."
dating_advice,ff72xq8,t1_ff72i7z,1579640060.0,"Well when I mean shitty, I mean uninterested, I should've clarified, but than again it's not like she'll spread rumors or you're gonna date her friends. If you're like me, I would say, ""you know what, you're cool n all, but I'm not really that interested."" Then drop her like bad habit. That's me though... I have my reasons. How old are you? You in high school?"
dating_advice,ff729ro,t3_es07gx,1579639679.0,"Well, if you just plainly said you liked her with no context, give it time, she may make a move and then you say you ""like her AS FRIENDS, sorry I should've been clear"". If not, just be a shitty ""bf"" and after a week she may just move on. Just ""suck at being a bf"". You're in a tough spot my friend."

dating_advice,ff3ephs,t3_erf7vr,1579539556.0,"First off, I wish people would stop overthinking this shit. You need to embrace your heart and what you enjoy! Follow the path! Stick with him and communicate. If he wants to wait a little, fine, you can wait if you really want him. Keep in mind how much interest you receive from this guy, too, because it'll determine how much the wait is worth. Otherwise, y'all embrace each other! You dont realize how lucky you are to connect with someone! I wish I were that lucky."
amiugly,ff3dxjo,t3_erflij,1579539142.0,"5, average for now. Alright, from one man to another, start going to the gym 5 times a week or more. Get cut n lean. You'll pull that look off a little better with a solid physique. I get the feeling you're into rock, so the hair would be hard to part with. So, without cutting your hair, I'd say smooth out the stray hairs a little. It's hard to keep it that way, I know, but with good maintenance, you'll pull it off. I'd keep the beard trimmed. It's too thin to be long, but you can pull of more than a stubble, too. Find a happy medium. Skincare would be a good investment. It can help with whatever blemishes you got. I didn't see a smile, but white teeth is a must. Next time you go to a dentist, get their whitening stuff, it's much better than over counter stuff. If you cut your hair, donate it, get a 2 or 3 on the sides and keep the top longer. Trim with scissors. Get a good man's cut. Cutting your hair also, means going clean shaven, too. So, gym, skincare, oralcare, will help you pull off either look with the right combination of hair and facial hair."

Just educate yourself and put in effort. You'll be surprised what you could do and how gullible people are when the don't know your not experienced at something.

Next time you're with your friends, kiss each other in front of them. That will send the message. If your friends get weird about, well y'all just be up front with them.

I went on to say, ""I do mini road trips often around your area and else where, so I have no problem stopping by."" Truth is, I do do mini road trips.

dating_advice,fe6q0ro,t3_eo0pew,1578900048.0,"Alright pal, get your heart in the right place, mind in the right place. Dont overthink. You are a man! You go for what you want! You're a result of what you do! If she rejects you, you walk away with your pride. If she says yes, you honor your request. Talk her some, just find an opportunity. Head high with relaxed demeanor. Tell her you thinks cute at some point in the convo. Ask her she'd like to hang out or something after school. You're kids so there isnt much y'all can do. A movie would be good for you two. If a dance is coming up, you ask her to that. I don't care if you cant dance. Ask her to that dance and yall make a memory. Plus you learn to dance. Good luck.

dating_advice,fe6pi97,t3_enzwdh,1578899405.0,"Hahaha, the paranoia. If a woman is asking you to comment on her look, I'm not sure its interest, but it sure odd and an outlier. Follow the trail. Now, if you answer, dont be a bitch and take a pee-on approach and say ""you look great!"" If she asks you on a day she ain't looking like she dont feel good, "" you don't look good, you okay?"" If she looks like shit, ""you look like crap, you fall off your bed?"" If she looks happy, ""sure, smiles, you look spunky today. I don't appreciate you infecting me with your uncontrollable happy stuff, haha."" Be honest and play with her. If she's asking you to rate her, you got an opportunity to tease her a little and be honest. Chances are, if you do this and there wasn't any interest before, you start getting her interested."

Then you won't question yourself. If they say ""anything"", you play what you want and keep it low, break the silence a little. While y'all are jamming out in your heads, y'all find time flies by and eventually when someone say something, it wont feel awkward because of silence. Me, I usually dont give a flying fuck.

amiugly,fe6nam8,t3_enz8v9,1578896834.0,"5, average. Alright pal, rule of thumb, if you can't grow a full beard clean it up. Stay clean shaven. If your eyebrows are a little bushy, just trim(very, very little) from the edges to shape them. I have to and I'm 22, not even an old man. Basically, stay groomed. Next, skincare, clean your face up. You'll be relieved. I'm getting some stuff when I get my money. Next, good teeth, next time you go to your dentist, ask em for whitening stuff. The dentist stuff works better. Just keep a clean mouth for your smiles. The hair is fine to me. If you want to look more your age and more like a man, trim you hair a bit. Experiment with a good 2 or 3 buzz on the sides and just trim the top. After that, dress good. Work out if you want. No sweat, you're okay dude, but you can improve. Now as far as being stared at, bud, it's just gonna get worse. Get used to it. You're a tall monster, so you intrigue the ladies and intimidate the guys. When you update your aesthetics for a mature look and look like you give damn, you will most likely get more attention. Probably from the ladies for sure. Hope this helps"
dating_advice,fdxxpky,t1_fdxrcio,1578773957.0,"He's lucky to have you. Most women would've probably dropped him. He is a grown ass man though. Just be stern. Y'all have been in a relationship for quite awhile. This is good experience if y'all plan on sticking with each other for the long haul. Face the problem head on. Don't avoid confrontation too long because it will eventually find you. You got a really good heart, but sometimes a good heart won't help all things. Caring what other people think is a liability; caring for and about others is an asset. If you wait around because you're worried about what he will think or feel, you're assuming and the problem is not fixed. Frame it this way. You care about his health. So talk to him about his oral hygiene. You want him to have a healthy mouth. He seems interested in hygiene the way you put it. Add this to his routine. Think about it. If someone told you that you stink or something, you'd be hurt yeah, but you're gonna want to change. I'm just giving scenarios. I was also raised with tough love, so the stern and harsh approach is what I know best. It's effective."
dating_advice,fdxpfmr,t3_enbwww,1578771531.0,"You need to be straight. ""Your damn breath and oral hygiene is bad! I adore you and enjoy you and it is not a major dealbreaker, but you got to clean that mouth. You don't, no more kisses!"" Draw the line! Be hard on him now if you've already brought it up. That'll get him thinking and panicking a little to put the fright into action. It would do it for me. If he gets sad, lift him up and reassure him, but be stern and get him to clean his mouth. If nothing, I'm not sure what else. He could be lazy. You could tell him about the confidence boost of having a top notch mouth!"

dating_advice,fdgrebe,t3_elbprv,1578406361.0,"You need to man up! Don't tell yourself that you have no chance. You are worrying about what she thinks without actually talking and figuring out what makes her tick. Attraction is game and it is a bitch. Stand up for yourself and worry about what you can do for her. I'm sure you have attributes that she might like; use them. Caring about what others think is a liability; caring for and about others is an asset. You are stuck in victim, selfish, excuse territory due to negative thinking you're not controlling. This psyches you out of trying to approach. It's as simple as saying hey, (followed by something that can start a convo), befriend her a little bit, then make your intentions known early on. Be creative because young women for some reason value this. I think it's dumb, but attraction is a game after all. I can't help in detail. Figure out what WORKS FOR YOU! You got this. You are wired to win. You're winning at talking yourself down. Turn it around, talk yourself up and win at approaching the pretty girl. Someone should've told me this kind of thinking, so I tell you now."

Someone should've told me that, so I tell you. Attracting women is competition; beat the other guys! You're a result of what you do, so bust your butt and make shit happen. That can be workout some more, testing techniques, and other things that you think WORK FOR YOU. I can't  , and nobody, can really give you the answers. In the end, though, it really does take running into a woman who is interested back (the right girl), so figure out when women are interested in you."

dating_advice,fcwrw7t,t1_fcwqedt,1578035141.0,"Fuck if I know. I'll give you a brief list and let y'all nit pick. One, I'm 22, have baby face, apparently look angry(my straight face)... idk why, I'm 5ft7-8in, wavy hair, average looks, I got a strong, deep texan accent(enough to where I sound 30 and it doesnt match my body), I'm 150lbs(skinny fat). I plan to build muscle since I've lost weight. I play guitar like nobodies business, but not in front of others cuz I dont know where to do that. I work alot, don't get out much(mainly cuz I'm broke at the moment) otherwise, I go to a bar n grills, check out what's new at the malls, read some books at the bookstore, hang with a pal when available, I've been thinking of getting back into fishing and hiking again. Generally, I do my own thing unapologetically. When I meet a lady I like, if I'm lucky, I can get beyond the shitty small talk into a cool convo. I guess, I cant believe a lady would want to hang out with me and I'm blown away if I make something work, so I hesitate to get numbers, but when I do via online or irl, idk what the fuck is going on half the time. They show barely any interest and i lose my drive to put in effort. When i do try to flirt and Express myself to them, the go cold or withdraw. Whatever, I say. When that happens, I withdraw, too. Recently, I havent been trying, just hanging out at home recently cuz I got lazy this past week cuz I'm tired as hell(manual labor job). Idk, maybe im not attractive enough, maybe it's the way I talk, maybe I'm weird, maybe im clueless, maybe im not interesting... I'm baffled. I should probably mention that I'm always the initiator and I usually go into it blind cuz I have yet to see a woman look at me interested since... high school... I guess... scratch that, more like I've just never seen a woman interested in me. I'm no recluse or awkward tho. Every woman I speak to, they smile, or stay cordial  depending on what I'm talking about, and I'll shoot the shit and possibly get a laugh occasionally. Anyways, I'm not sure what to change. I've already overcome my depression, most of my negativity, I ditched the glasses, I'm beginning to work out, new wardrobe, hanging with buddies here n there. I figure I just got to be even more attractive, but I ain't too sure 'bout that. I guess I come off standoffish, or overconfident sometimes cuz I just dont give a fuck. You either love me or hate me... take your motherfuckin' pick n get.

Ugh, long post, sorry. It sucks though cuz I dont know what I'm doing wrong. I might get coach or some shit. I used to get so down on this because ""I'm single...waaaaa"". Since I'm more content about it, I'm doing better. At the end of the day, it aint no sweat off my nuts. One day it should work out."

One side of my jaw is more sculpted than the other, but barely noticeable, like your bite. Once you get it fixed like you said, facial products to help with blemishes, light makeup, not too much makeup because I know you might be into makeup. General maintenance of course.

dating_advice,fcboloj,t3_egx61y,1577589250.0,"Pal, I've been lonely and emotionally distraught, too. I have no luck with women whatsoever, but I'm not sure if I'm oblivious or I dont attract any woman. Dating apps are practically junk. I can't explain it. People try to rationalize it, but dating apps are fleeting, it'll either work or not. It's just like love man. Love is fleeting. It does not last. I'm having my strains with family and stuff, too. My advice, get some self help books. Like, Unfuck Yourself, by mr. Bishop, or I Used to be Miserable Fuck, by John Kim. I like those books. Compile everything you have learned from psychology, faith, motivationals and derive a plan to work on your helpless mindset, then ditch the victim mentality, as I call it. You are not your thoughts, your memories, past! You are a result of what you do! I love by this now and it helped me get out of my head and forget my heartaches. Now here's the deal. You want to give up? I dont think so. You need encouragement! Learn what you failed at, learn about women and dating or whatever bullshit can help you. Most of it is trash, but there's hidden gems here n there. Get a good mindset and radiate the positivity. It will help you. Make some friends n connections. That victim mentality, btw, is a cause of the ""me"" statements. ""I think someone can help me"". That statement is true, but the framing is bad. Instead find someone you like. What can you do for them? In turn what can they add to you? Get the idea? It's hard to explain, but shift the framing a bit n you'll get result. Caring about what people think is a liability; caring about others is an asset. Lastly, do not give up man. You'll want it even more and then you're really desperate. Trust me I know. Stay open and watchful. Sometimes, timing is a bitch. One thing, though, get out of your house. The isolation is detrimental. Workout, go to bars where the games are playing, walk, shop, go to events. Refuel your happiness. While you're helping yourself rejuvenate, you're also out n about, increasing the chance of finding a lady that'll catch your eye. Two birds, one stone!"
AccuratelyRateMe,fc26r9u,t3_dyyxmj,1577342971.0,I have read all rules located on the sidebar and the following guides: https://www.reddit.com/r/AccuratelyRateMe/wiki
dating_advice,fc26f7v,t3_efqt8u,1577342513.0,"Y'know I admire your willingness to pursue a little. I'm a guy if you wonder. I think the username is self explanatory. My advice, try to not over think this. I fuck up all the time when I try to think how to talk to women. Then I overthink and then nothing happens. Don't wait around, you have to obtain what you want. This goes for guys and girls. So let's use an example. You're in college. So am I. If i wanted a women to get my attention, this is what would do it. Make eye contact, make a slight facial expression, raise an eyebrow or something. That would get me curious. Look again, smile if you want or something. Make sure he sees you. Now, don't look for awhile. Now get closer. Try to be just a little sneaky, find a reason to get near him. Hell, just walk up to him. He's probably wondering why the hell you looked at him. I would. I wonder why I'm stared at some days and ignored the next. Chances are he's oblivious. I am. Who knows? You said you spoke some. Bring up something that may have been interesting before hand. Start there. Escalate the convo, not sexually or anything, just actual communication. Compliment him or something, try and joke around all flirty like and see what happens. If you can just get his curiosity and interest in a convo, you're already there. Just find a way to be flirty with the guy. Probe him to see what makes him tick or laugh or whatever. I like a woman who actually does not fear talking to me and is very direct. If she can be a good conversationalist and genuinely take interest in me and keeps coming back for more, then I'm led to believe she may just like me enough for me to ask her out . That's me though. It's tricky, but I'm also a dude, so I'm not too sure what attracts a dude hahah, but I know what would catch my attention, so you can try this. Think outside the box, y'know? If this garbage advice... disregard."

That being said, I'd trim the scruff just a bit. Keep it a little short, not a stubble, just short so that the facial compliments your haircut better. Overall, this does make ya look like an older dude, so I'd say your on point if you want to look mature."
offmychest,fbzlv34,t3_ef0dva,1577251124.0,"I'm gonna tell you something that I wish I knew earlier when I was down. I told my mom and dad and many people I knew that I was depressed. I was always told, ""things will work out"", ""no, you're not depressed, i know the signs of depression"", ""you're just sad, cheer up"", ""get a gf"", ""love yourself"". Bullshit... all of it. It didn't sink into to my parents minds until they caught me crying alone... often. I'd try to hide cuz it was weak. After several years, I told my mom I had a blade to my throat once, I've intentionally driven recklessly on back roads, I've thought killing myself often, the whole nine yards. My dad was on the phone with me when I had a melt down screaming in frustration and anger with myself and life. Yet, in the end they didn't help me. They did, but didn't put effort into finding someone who could help me get out of my head. You know who did help me? I went to a counselor one day at my school. Talked to her for awhile throughout the month and vented, but she didn't really help me overcome much. She recommended I get real help. I called the suicide hotline one day when I was really hurting, and it's a fucking joke. Nobody talks to you, they set you up with hospitals or places with psychological help. I checked in with those places anyway and come to find out, my insurance does not cover it and I cannot afford it. I prayed for help after so long without faith. I looked up reddit, quora, psychologytoday, self help forums, people who could  potentially relate to me. I felt worse, but I took notes on what helped others. I started getting helpless, then I spearheaded everything hoping to outlast this shit finally after years of no confidence, hate, ugh too many words. I failed. Notice a theme here? I then started taking shit into my hands, I focused on work, I started to improve the things that depressed me in my life. I started having success. Long story short, things started to click. Out of no where my mindset got positive enough to really help myself. I started reading books of the self help nature. I put in a plan derived from all the knowledge I gained on how to combat depression. It all started to work out. As time went on, I no longer had negativity as bad as I did. Now that I think about, the suicidal shit went away, too! The theme? I, me, myself. I...I... I was the one who got me help, cuz nobody can truly understand what is bothering you. Not even me or fellow depressed people. We can relate, but we do not know what truly hurts you. It took me to take so many alternatives and compile them to help me truly figure out what was up with me. Now I am trying to move forward. I wish you well. Do not disregard professional help if you truly need it. I didnt do it because I couldn't afford it. I might get therapy or something later on myself to put the nail in the coffin of my sorrows that bother me."

Something has clearly happened. You reek of depression. Snap out of it!! It's in your head! Life is bullshit, I won't lie, but eating yourself alive on the inside will only make it worse for you. If you really hate life that much, you wouldn't be on reddit venting. You'd probably act on your troubled thoughts. You are not your thoughts!! What I see is a cry for help. Maybe a sought after ""figurative"" swift kick in the ass to help you snap out of it."
