IWantToLearn,ff63ush,t1_ff5mhyq,1579618463.0,You are in for an absolutely amazing book.  Oathbringer is easily the best in the series so far.
IWantToLearn,ff4a8w1,t1_ff2vy5h,1579558943.0,Easily one of my favorite books.  The Way of Kings was quite literally life changing.  You have excellent taste.
IWantToLearn,ff49yh7,t3_eraraq,1579558759.0,"I am in the middle of learning Japanese and have been using iTalki religiously.  You can get a tutor or find friends on the site incredibly easily.  They offer lessons from 5$ an hour if you're wanting a professional or you can reach out to the English speaking community.  I'd be more than happy to speak with you personally if you have questions about the language or just want to chat.

I wish you the best and am beyond impressed by people learning English, it is insanely difficult."

BadChoicesGoodStories,fenfb9s,t3_epfesy,1579283459.0,Super common in Japan and based off of the signs around him being in hiragana / kanji that's where I'd place this.  We saw this every day in Tokyo.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fehn7ww,t3_ep25vk,1579119963.0,The last time I got a stomache virus it was because of my niece and nephew. I used to have a really bad phobia of it and it kept me away from them for years. Grateful af for therapy.

LearnJapanese,fe9q1r6,t3_enucz0,1578940416.0,Use Kanji Study. It has both and its amazing.
SpeakJapanese,fe9nkxe,t1_fe9n5qc,1578939788.0,"Mmk.

Just as an edit, because clearly I'm the dick head here, I know 1900 Kanji and have been studying for 9 months soooooo. Yeah."

AskMen,fe5t60g,t3_enlczz,1578874385.0,"I had to examine myself and figure out why I couldn't have her.  I'm not religious anymore, I hate rock climbing and she wanted kids. Ultimately, my life with the person I thought I wanted wasn't what I would have wanted at all. I loved her to death but it never would have worked at in any semblance of a healthy relationship."

nonononoyes,fdn3kx1,t3_em5dpn,1578576271.0,"Whatever you are failing at right now is a direct allegory for this video. I'm learning Japanese and when I started 9 months ago I was frustrated and knew nothing. After smashing my face against grammar and Kanji, I'm up to 1807 memorized, about 400 left for reading fluency, and I can speak to my tutors relatively easily.

Keep going. You'll get it eventually. The difference between a student and a master is the 10,000 failures it takes to learn it all."

AskReddit,fd3beaj,t3_ejubhh,1578156597.0,I will be moving to Japan in the next few years but stayed there for a while recently. The work life is crushing unless you are able to do your own thing or you find a company with your values. You either fall in line or burn out super fast. That being said I love teaching and love 日本語 I can't wait to move.
