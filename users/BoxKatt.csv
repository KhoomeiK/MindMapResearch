What the weightloss comes down to is also just that you eat less than you burn. You can in theory never leave your apartment and still lose weight. It won't be fun, but it's doable.   


Read the quickstart guide that's here to the right on this sub and it should give you the basics on how to lose the weight."

loseit,ff00dsi,t3_er18m1,1579463804.0,"You might as well get into the habit now of counting your calories, weighing your food etc.  


You see, the reason why Keto works for many people is that it kinda artificially removes things that it's easy to eat too much calories of. That's why people lose weight with it, because they find eating with Keto an easy way to reduce their caloric intake.  


With that said, many people, including myself, never did something like that. We just eat less than our body needs to stay the same weight.   


So, one advice could be to already get into the habit of not just measuring what keto wants you to measure, but instead also measure your calories.   


One thing that will happen when you quit Keto is that your body starts putting on a bit of water again, but don't be discouraged by the initial watergain."

If you've just recently begun working out your body will store more water than normal, so don't be too discouraged by that.  


Are you weighing your food? It's basically impossible to accuretly determine everything you're eating if you're eyeballing it, even when you're good at it you could be a few hundred calories off per day.  


If you're not seeing the *trend* go downwards in couple of weeks from now on too, try to see where it could be wrong. Maybe you're measuring something by serving, not thinking how big a serving is. Maybe your overestimating your calorie burn.
