GalaxyWatch,ff9lxg4,t1_ff9lizz,1579715763.0,"Thank you,

I did search the web, and I found that the SMS permission is needed for the weather to work. Unfortunately we cannot remove the permission. It's a restriction from samsung."
GalaxyWatch,ff9ks21,t1_ff9kmav,1579715088.0,"Hi there, could you please send us a screenshot of the message where we ask for access to messages?

The watch face shouldn't have access to that.

You can send us an email at jhwatchfaces@outlook.com"
GalaxyWatch,ff9fb43,t3_es3ip9,1579711787.0,That's expensive though
GalaxyWatch,ff974so,t1_ff96r6n,1579706407.0,"Thank you for the suggestion, will add that in another watch face."
GalaxyWatch,ff8m3af,t1_ff8lzji,1579685257.0,It pulls the data from OpenWeatheeAPI
GalaxyWatch,ff8f70e,t3_es71ls,1579675872.0,Yes this is completely normal
GalaxyWatch,ff8evb8,t1_ff88xms,1579675497.0,It does indeed save some battery life compared to other watch faces.
GalaxyWatch,ff8etxz,t1_ff7vzes,1579675452.0,"Hi, please try to manually refresh the weather, by tapping on the too of the watch face."

GalaxyWatch,fex7ts4,t1_fewb316,1579426419.0,It is possible though. You can select it in the tap action menu.
GalaxyWatch,fej3tez,t3_epf6v5,1579155853.0,"In my opinion it isn't much better.

 - You still cannot sort on specific things such as; step counter, multiple colors, minimalistic etc. 

It would we awesome if we could enable those search terms when searching for a watch face so you don't have to scroll down till you are dead.

 - The store is still not 'good' on non Samsung phones, it is still a pain to enable a coupon code, and when you entered a coupon code you cannot click on the coupon code (or app name) to quickly go to the app.

I'm not a native English speaker. So my apologies for grammar mistakes."

GalaxyWatch,fed1yhz,t1_fed1xjc,1578994656.0,Did you put everything in folders.
GalaxyWatch,fed1bfc,t1_fecz63o,1578993704.0,"I used the bitmap font option for the custom weather icon, named with the ID's of the weather type.

I also created a free OpenWeatherAPI account and I created a API and pasted it in GWD.

If you need more help feel free to ask :)"

GalaxyWatch,fdqmlqp,t1_fdqmdfx,1578670248.0,"Thank you :) Just needs some tweaks here and there.

Still need some beta testers, will post an post about it next week.

Things that need to be tested:
  - accuracy of the forecast icon
  - language support
  - overall look when using another language than English
  - unknown bugs"
GalaxyWatch,fdqluj2,t1_fdnytf5,1578669756.0,I think I'm going for [this](https://i.imgur.com/dAEC6In.jpg) design
GalaxyWatch,fdqld72,t1_fdp8x44,1578669445.0,"Hi, I have the free plan, so max 60 calls per minute. I think that is enough though, you can manually update the data if you tap on the weather forecast icon.

I am not going to pay for a paid plan, I want to keep my watch faces free for everyone."
GalaxyWatch,fdq90zm,t1_fdq119k,1578659755.0,"Thanks for your interest in this watch face, it will be available for free within 3 weeks.
I will switch the seconds with the date/weather info."
GalaxyWatch,fdptr2a,t1_fdpsurg,1578640136.0,"That also is a nice watch face, I used that one for a while too.

Unfortunately it wouldn't look nice without the seconds in AOD because it looks like it is missing something."
GalaxyWatch,fdps1oj,t1_fdprsie,1578638280.0,"Thank you, unfortunately it is not possible to ""just dim the whole thing down"" because the seconds cannot be displayed in AOD ~~made~~ mode.

I think most people prefer to only see the weather in AOD. Because it doesn't drain your battery that much compared to when you have all the info still shown.

I really appreciate your suggestion, maybe I will add something like that in another watch face :)"

GalaxyWatch,fdo7xz1,t1_fdo7sou,1578600451.0,Unfortunately it is not possible to add steps (and many other things) when you have weather info shown. This is a limitation of Galaxy Watch Designer.

EDIT: Because some months (like May and June) don't have many letters in it and it will look ""empty"" in the middle of the screen. I also think that some languages have longer words for some months, so it will be chopped off. But thanks for the suggestion :)"
GalaxyWatch,fdnxdpi,t1_fdnx88l,1578594777.0,">Maybe left justify the day and month to the 12 degrees.

What exactly do you mean by that?"
GalaxyWatch,fdnwjge,t1_fdnvbaw,1578594290.0,Something like [this?](https://i.imgur.com/ofCduqc.jpg)
GalaxyWatch,fdnwczq,t1_fdnvgw4,1578594187.0,I will also make another watch face with weather info included. This one will have the big seconds because some people prefer this.
GalaxyWatch,fdnv3zx,t1_fdnv1af,1578593456.0,The seconds.
GalaxyWatch,fdnv28k,t1_fdnuy6p,1578593427.0,Its not available yet. It will be within the next three weeks :)

GalaxyWatch,fdgz9bg,t3_elcsoy,1578411913.0,"I'm working on a ""weather only"" watch face.

You can change the color by double-tapping on the seconds.
