Dropped the size of the box, changed the properties of what needed to be added to it, and affected the number of batches to be mixed for the cakes. Because they changed the size just a little, and their recipe at the same time, it resulted in less stable cakes. Very expensive to relearn how to make cakes when their batter no longer supported the same weight.
