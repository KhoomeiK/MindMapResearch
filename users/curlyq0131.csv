Christian,fep9k6n,t3_eqaade,1579315193.0,"I had read an article a couple months ago that compared modesty between men and women and how it is easy to point fingers at women for their  clothing being immodest but men can wear things that are oversexualizing (tight shirts, tight pants). The article then flipped it that modesty is those things but also how flashy are you being, are you wearing something that you want to scream ""look at my tight biceps"" ""look at my cleavage"" or just wearing a shirt. So it was an interesting perspective because I know sometimes I've worn shirts or shorts because I wanted the attention from the outfit so I wasn't being modest because I was being flashy so to speak."

My mom would just randomly decide to read my journal, so something that my therapist told me to use for some therapeutic purpose was now being used against me.

So I eventually would bring my journal in my backpack but then quit writing altogether. Both things made me lose trust in my parents though. 

 (Mormon dates arent like we are bf/gf in HS sometimes but not all the time because they do not like pairing off and prefer you date multiple people to find someone you would like to marry after HS so this wasnt anything serious, especially since they teach girls to not say no when someone asks you on a date)"

AskReddit,fciw4gl,t1_fcihf8z,1577671230.0,"My nephew got seizures from the final dose of mmrm, the pediatrician hasn't given my oldest his final dose because he doesn't want him to end up with seizures and I dont either. To me that's a big side effect, he has a medical support dog to help when he gets a seizure so my kids both arent going to do the final dose. I'm fully vaxed based on the standards when I went to school and my 4yr old has already passed me in the quantity of vaccines he has received versus the quantity I received. So are all adults walking contaminates for the diseases we didnt get vaxed against? Just a question I've been wondering recently"

Parenting,fcaq9mr,t1_fcagsr1,1577574441.0,"I HAVE to do this my son doesn't ever stop talking, we ask him to be quiet for a minute or so and he gets upset saying he likes talking. He just loves hearing himself chatter about nothing important. Once in the car he said "" I can't hear myself talk"" because I turned the music up loader to tune him out. Its hard but he can't just talk constantly and I'm an introvert and he is very extroverted and feeds off social interaction while I love personal alone time. Good luck to you and your chatty little one"

LCMS,fbyh6gr,t3_ef0ywd,1577216793.0,"So....I've been LCMS for 2 or 3 yrs and was previously raised mormon

1. I think abortions are bad, but I'm not going to stand in the way of someone else doing it. I do think if they're going to go through with that there should be available resources that show that they have other options besides abortion.
2. I'm still friends with gays, everyone is a sinner, we all just sin differently 🤷‍♀️ Jesus was friends/talked to everyone 
3. This is probably wrong but I think God's time is way different than our time so 6 days idk if it is necessarily SIX DAYS or some godly time that I cant wrap my head around. 
The other parts I don't have answers to but I am a liberal voter and still go to church at my LCMS church that is in a very liberal town and I've never felt any conflicts from it. I get along with those in my church and have made friends. I'd keep going and find out if it's the right fit for you"
Adoption,fbyfnk1,t3_ef1eb0,1577215708.0,"My grandpa was adopted and he didnt like that his mom would be bias in the story about his birth father. Say he was rotten, liar, etc.. he wished it was more unbiased and factual even though he did cheat on his mom so he was those things but still..unfortunately (while they're little) it's still their dad till they're old enough to realize oh they are a slimy person 

 With my son I plan to be honest about his bio father but with facts, because he was a product of rape as well. And I've already started some of the talk that his dad (my now husband) about how he didnt help make him but loves him like he does his younger brother. 

Be honest with her or have your parents be honest with her. You were young, the father took advantage of you and signed his rights away so he wouldnt get in more trouble for what he did. You love her and your parents were better fit to raise her than you could. (If this is how you feel based on reading other comments I've created this written statement) good luck, it's a hard conversation but be honest to her."
