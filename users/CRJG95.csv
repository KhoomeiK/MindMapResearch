YouShouldKnow,ff5pia7,t3_ernqtd,1579604776.0,"I used to work in a call centre and loved hearing people who didn’t know these just making up their own. Like “my postcode is P for Paul, O for ostrich 7, 4, R for raincoat D for dog”. The problem then is it’s hard to distinguish the actual words, was that F for Fred or S for Said, are you saying D for Dad or B for Bad??"
YouShouldKnow,ff5pbr6,t1_ff4vfss,1579604514.0,I worked in a call centre and do the same.

secretsanta,fdrojvf,t1_fdrndnf,1578687384.0,"But why? Other people getting expensive gifts doesn’t hurt you, and the chance of being one of the lucky people to get matched with Bill Gates or Google or whoever is a good incentive to sign up next year."
secretsanta,fdrn7rc,t1_fdrjbs7,1578686823.0,"There’s supposed to be a minimum spend of £20 or so, so everyone should get something of at least that value (and if they don’t then you can give your gifter a bad rating). Some people get lucky and encounter a particularly generous Santa, it seems kind of mean spirited to want to prevent people from giving generously. Other people going above and beyond with their gifts is a nice thing and doesn’t hurt anyone."
truechildfree,fdbxh88,t1_fd9ohyb,1578263478.0,"When my boyfriend and I met we were friends at first and he was dating someone else. One of the main reasons they split up was that she insisted that he would have to change his mind and agree to have kids with her if he wanted the relationship to continue.  He did not. 

So luckily I went into our relationship fully aware of how much the child issue was a dealbreaker for him, so no unpleasant surprises ahead."
LifeProTips,fd4fnvq,t3_ejxwbb,1578167089.0,"My little sister was an extra in GoT and had scenes with white walkers, they had all the child extras sit in on the makeup session with one of them so they would see that all the scary ice zombies were just regular guys wearing make up and wouldn’t be afraid of them."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcyl62i,t1_fcy66uz,1578082024.0,"Dogs are easier to train than toddlers, so I feel like any area with a leash law for dogs should also have it for kids under 5."
ChoosingBeggars,fcmu7y8,t1_fcmlxze,1577792498.0,"I don’t know about the US, but it happens reasonably often in the UK, though the more common issue is tenants just refusing to leave at the end of their lease."
AmItheAsshole,fcmt0uu,t1_fclyyfe,1577790833.0,"I wouldn’t let these people stress you out too much about the kid asking if you love her, that’s pretty normal toddler stuff. They don’t really understand what love is and they’re trying to figure out how relationships work so they ask all kinds of seemingly ridiculous questions. My baby sister at 3 learned what death was and asked everyone constantly about when they were going to die and when she was going to die and if she was bad would she die. It was a bit morbid but nothing to stress about."
HumansBeingBros,fclprcn,t1_fckes37,1577753495.0,The exact same reaction my cat has after trying to blind me while I free his claw from being stuck in the carpet.
ZeroWaste,fckkmsh,t1_fckkhzj,1577727391.0,There’s an option on the website about applying for a collection point in your area if it’s something you think people around you would be up for!
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fck5e91,t1_fchyvj5,1577717082.0,"When I was 12 I got an iPod nano for my birthday, I left it where the puppy could reach by accident and she chewed it to pieces. I was devastated and my dad was very sympathetic, but he still didn’t buy me another one. I saved up and got a much cheaper replacement about 6 months later and learned a valuable lesson about keeping things I care about safe, I’ve still got the one I bought 12 years later in perfect condition."
AmItheAsshole,fcju284,t1_fcjsnyf,1577704734.0,"You can accept that 99% of people like to murder kittens (or you know, pigs, cows lambs and chickens to be more accurate) but still not want to pay for those animals to be murdered at your wedding. It’s very difficult to convince people to stop eating meat in their own lives, but that doesn’t mean you have to contribute financially to the industry, which is what you would be doing by paying a caterer to serve meat at your event."
ChoosingBeggars,fcjsvm2,t1_fciqj1t,1577703010.0,The fact that the lady in the OP is getting a cover up implies that she should already know this.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fcjs5hz,t1_fcjr4pb,1577701943.0,"My sister had 3 hospital worthy head injuries in the space of 6 months when she was a toddler, all completely accidental and unpredictable (she just really liked smashing her head into things). My parents were terrified social services would come and rate her away after the third incident, but the hospital were pretty clear that they could see it was all normal toddler stuff and there were no signs of abuse."
Tinder,fchl7n4,t1_fchjhlc,1577651518.0,If there are only two genders are you arguing that “women” isn’t one of them?
ZeroWaste,fcaqemq,t1_fcannmr,1577574526.0,"TSS is much, much less likely with a cup, partly because tampons dry out the vagina and can cause small tears and irritation, whereas a cup will not do that. A cup can also comfortably go 12 hours between changes (depending on flow) and is much harder to forget up there and lose because it’s bigger, and you normally only have one or two of them."
fatlogic,fcapwkp,t1_fcapewq,1577574225.0,"I can imagine if I was completely sedentary, like didn’t walk anywhere or exercise at all I could probably maintain at that level, but I would literally have to be sat on my arse for 23 hours a day !"
fatlogic,fcap2cc,t1_fcahs3v,1577573722.0,"I’m 5’2, female, 50kgs and my maintenance is about 1500 calls with moderate exercise (probably 30 minutes walking per day and an hour at the gym once a week)"

hisdarkmaterials,fc5grbv,t1_fbymcm6,1577457145.0,"To be fair boys generally go through puberty a bit later than girls anyway, so with a 2 or 3 year age gap they could still be going through it together. Puberty is also a long process and it seems to vary exactly when daemons settle in each person. People don’t really finish puberty until 18-22 so I’m willing to believe a 15 year old still has a changing daemon, and it seems worth it for the benefits that using and older actor brings."
