antiMLM,ffarlm1,t1_ff9tn9c,1579742857.0,"Honestly, I'm super mega anti-MLM... But I love Mary Kay. Their timewise skincare line is honestly amazing."
peopleofwalmart,ff2slpe,t1_ff2pt90,1579522374.0,"Wow, you're a dick. I have also worked for Walmart, but you know who I don't take my frustrations out on? The innocent door greeter just trying to do their job."
peopleofwalmart,ff2sfpl,t1_ff23qnu,1579522155.0,"It's literally only when you have something not bagged. Like large items or anything under your cart. It's not really to deter stealing, it's to make sure you didn't forget to scan and pay for something. If I have everything bagged, they don't stop me. If I have any large items not bagged, like a case of water, I know to stop and hand them my receipt."
namenerds,ff104ua,t1_ff0xpd5,1579473962.0,"It is!! And she's a huge fan of her namesake. She's only 7 but she's watched documentaries, and has a picture book and a plush doll of him. And she'll correct anyone that asks if she's named after the band or the car! Lol"
namenerds,ff0slw7,t3_eqw1db,1579471915.0,"Oddly enough, Alora is the name I'm sad I'll never get to use. I have 4 little girls- Layla, Tesla, Julia, and Ophelia. I had wanted to use Alora for Julia and Ophelia but DH wasn't a fan. 

Also, Quest was the name we would have used for a boy, but this baby factory is closed! !"
quityourbullshit,fezpxrk,t1_feyuvqs,1579460184.0,"I don't even see OP's comment, but I'm just chiming in to say I have had 4 babies, zero vomit. Lots of nausea, but I never actually puked at all."
Youniqueamua,feibubb,t1_fe9mvbf,1579134855.0,I still feel like I need to apologize to everyone that came within 10 feet of me in 1998. I MARINATED in that stuff.
curlyhair,fedi4q2,t1_fedi25b,1579012118.0,And  he probably smells amazing because he was handsome AF. Stupid boys.
curlyhair,fedh42x,t1_fed91ld,1579011361.0,"The accuracy. Not just curly hair either. I have dreadlocks and there was a guy that posted on the dreadlocks subreddit with PERFECT dreads, so I asked him what shampoo he was using. DAWN DISH SOAP."

aww,fe2ce6q,t1_fe27hle,1578836813.0,"I'm planning to get her one as soon as I can afford it! (Tight budget at the moment) No, the loud begging was cute and funny at first but between that and her thinking she's entitled to another wet food every couple hours, she's just a mouthy butthole. That, and actively trying to trip me toward the cat food."
aww,fe23wzf,t1_fe1x531,1578834202.0,"My cat is one of those animals. Won't drink from her water bowl but as soon as she hears a faucet, she comes running. She'll also sit by the sink and yell at me to turn it on."
JUSTNOMIL,fe1jxln,t1_fdz1k2c,1578827492.0,"As a mom to a toddler with cystic fibrosis, fuck that bitch. Something as small as a cold can be dangerous for my child."

blunderyears,fdvbosg,t3_emu6fy,1578745751.0,90's me would have had a crush on guy on the bottom right. I was a sucker for the bowl cut.
delusionalartists,fdvbc8u,t3_en1vyd,1578745596.0,"I actually kinda like it... Paired with different shoes, I think it could be cute. I like that its actually not a dress, but a top and a skirt. I think the issue is the way its being styled. With a flower crown and some cute sandals, I think it would be adorable."
muacirclejerk,fdv8o9w,t1_fdsqwog,1578744703.0,"She could have easily posted at r/prettyaltgirls or r/bigtiddygothgf or idk, a dozen other sub's that are more appropriate"
JUSTNOMIL,fdraf2c,t1_fdr9slw,1578681631.0,"I had a really beautiful spaghetti strap prom gown too, and my mom made me wear a stupid bolero over it to make it modest. I took it off as soon as I got there and when it wasn't on me in my pictures she had a hernia."
JUSTNOMIL,fdr9nn3,t1_fdr9gkb,1578681438.0,"Mormon bridesmaid dresses are literally so hideous. They're all the same shapeless, boring sacks. Square necklines, cap sleeves, a-line, ankle length. Blehhh."
JUSTNOMIL,fdr97pi,t1_fdqc0ve,1578681177.0,"First one was a bust. The wedding was a wildly expensive fiasco covered in pink, rhinestones, and glitter. You'd think she would want to be a little more low key for wedding number two but nooooo. Should be an interesting spectacle to witness. At least I don't have to wear hot pink this time!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdq4hmk,t1_fdpd3ki,1578654436.0,"I could have written this. Mormon weddings are a nightmare. Mine was, my sisters was, and she's about to have a second one."

Dreadlocks,fdgutqn,t1_fdgsvhr,1578408878.0,"Not everyone wants ""perfect"" dreads. Some like to embrace the messiness (myself included). Why does she need to adhere to YOUR standard of ""cute?"" I personally think she looks adorable. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all!"
muacirclejerk,fdg3eo7,t1_fdf56qd,1578378531.0,"It's on the Wish app too and I see ""drippin clam"" every time lol"
Youniqueamua,fdeqryy,t1_fdeqgwf,1578344659.0,I'm baffled by it too. I'm 35 and don't have a lot of lines or wrinkles yet but I still have to be conscious of how I smile in pictures so as not to have forehead lines. The maniacal smile and cakey yellow foundation isn't doing this hun any favors.
Youniqueamua,fddquwa,t1_fddf40j,1578321569.0,Right?! I feel like her forehead lines probably aren't as bad as they look but that foundation emphasized them sooooo hard.
Youniqueamua,fdcg2d5,t1_fdcfy52,1578274018.0,"I actually erased and redid them a few times, I'm a tad OCD lol"
Youniqueamua,fdc54y9,t3_ek7pme,1578267297.0,The worst part is that she actually filmed a full length tutorial for this look.
JUSTNOMIL,fdb9yb7,t1_fd9avvn,1578255309.0,"Was going to say almost exactly this. I don't remember a time when I didn't know. And I NEVER would have told my parents ""they weren't my real parents."" They are my real parents! Biology doesn't make a difference. I am so grateful my parents were always open and honest with me. And as far as the birth parents go- when I was in my twenties, I did find mine, with my adoptive parents blessing. And they never felt replaced or offended."
blunderyears,fd2cq31,t1_fczd9ym,1578145323.0,Class of '02 here and I also would have been totally smitten.

Dreadlocks,fcvtys9,t1_fcvtp0m,1578010047.0,"Yes!! I literally have a bag of hair in my closet. Some of it is extension hair from a shop, some of it is my friends dreads, etc. I have so many different people's hair in my head at this point! I even started pulling my daughters' hair out of their hairbrushes to add to my weak spots. I'm like a calico cat at this point. Lol"
Dreadlocks,fcvsswh,t1_fcvs9s2,1578009298.0,Yup! My dreads literally weren't growing at all and I was sick of waiting. My friend had recently cut all her dreads off so I just attached hers to mine!

blunderyears,fcuyc7c,t1_fctxtqw,1577990968.0,"I loved girls camp as a teenager. I no longer consider myself Mormon, but as a teen that struggled to fit in, the feeling of friendship and unity and acceptance was something I looked forward to every summer."
blunderyears,fcuy170,t3_eiv4h0,1577990794.0,"Is this camp or EFY? 

As a FoMo, I chuckled. I once snuck generic cola into girls camp and felt like a total badass."

Youniqueamua,fclq3k2,t3_ehlzfg,1577753730.0,That's also not her makeup. It's one of the makeup filters you can choose on BeautyPlus.
muacirclejerk,fclnyv2,t1_fckzj5i,1577752270.0,I think the rhinestone studded owls are from the dollar tree... My daughters have them but without the rhinestones.

namenerds,fchvf2x,t1_fcgz2o9,1577654607.0,Blanche really is a terrible name. It just reminds me of vegetables.
Bedbugs,fc6po6k,t1_fc6j29v,1577486330.0,My husband busted one trying to crawl down the drain of our bathroom sink. Bedbugs are weird.
muacirclejerk,fc54uf0,t1_fc4bn96,1577443233.0,I feel attacked.
JUSTNOMIL,fc54ecr,t1_fc44tzz,1577442571.0,This. I actually rarely chime in on these posts but overnights are a hard no for me with ANYONE until my children are fully verbal.
breakingmom,fc53w9k,t1_fc4kclk,1577441813.0,"No, they denied it because they said they had already reversed an overdraft for me as a courtesy this year. :("
breakingmom,fc3cwae,t1_fc3bndb,1577387003.0,"I have PNC. I usually try to keep some money in my savings or reserve so I don't overdraft but we've been pretty broke lately and Christmas put us over the limit, unfortunately. :(  I've never had them reimburse any ATM fees, I'll have to look into that."
breakingmom,fc33lpz,t1_fc329s4,1577380640.0,"I actually did call and spoke to several people and they initially denied it because they've waived an overdraft for me once before. They said they'll review my account and get back to me today so I'm hoping they'll waive the fees and put my account at zero. $189 might not seem like a lot but that's more than half of my husband's paycheck. Not to mention we don't even have gas money for the next week to get him to and from work, and we have his Grandma's funeral tomorrow."
breakingmom,fc31y0e,t1_fc307yx,1577379581.0,"I probably do! I try to be so careful but my husband and I struggle so hard. We definitely aren't ""spendy"" but he doesn't watch our budget as closely as I do."
breakingmom,fc31rwd,t1_fc2wtb8,1577379476.0,Thank you. Its just felt like a never-ending struggle. And I actually have 4 little girls that I feel like I'm constantly letting down. I just wanted to give them a great Christmas and I fucked up so bad. :(
breakingmom,fc2kt6w,t1_fc2ixnl,1577365182.0,Thank you <3

namenerds,fbxpaa6,t1_fbwowog,1577196607.0,Honestly Equinox would make a badass name IMO.
TheHandmaidsTale,fbuc8ox,t3_eeh64l,1577111828.0,This is almost as bad as the Handmaids Tale themed maternity photoshoot I saw on Facebook last month.
