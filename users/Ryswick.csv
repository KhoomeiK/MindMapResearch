They had removed mana regen on support items for a bit which made laning atrocious.

Now that we have it back, AND they're giving her a fat 15% movement speed on E at rank 1, it's pretty nuts.

I play a pretty early/mid-game focused Sona with lots of roaming, and that movement speed buff is going to feel so good."

If it means anything, I'm 99% sure she'll regret leaving you.

There's so much comfort you develop in a LTR that I took for granted. I don't know how old you two are, but she probably regrets not having a 'wild phase'. 'Finding yourself' is synonymous with 'experimenting'.

'Wild phases' aren't all they're cracked up to be.

My perspective on life shifted so much when I left my relationship. I used to frame everything in context of 'us'. That would be a fun movie for 'us' to see. 'We' should try that burger place out. I hope I get this day off so 'we' get more time together.

I lost a lot of motivation to do anything. I don't care to try a new restaurant by myself. I don't care to go out anywhere. I don't care to even get out of bed.

Standard league is more popular. People like going fast. People like doing more damage.

They just kept going along with the power creep, and the only way to make anything dangerous in a game where players 1-shot entire screens, is to make the enemies 1-shot players too.

A simple solution in my opinion, would be to have both town portals and logging out have a interruptable channel.

There's no instant get-out-of-jail free card, you can force players to fight out sticky situations when they're running out of flask charges, so you can focus fights on multiple smaller mistakes over time rather than one singular 'fuck you' instance."

For instance, mid-laners picked as support for more kill potential. Mid laners picked as an adc for earlier dominance as a trade-off for late-game potential. Adc top lane high-risk, high-reward lane.

Some odd picks that actually became meta were things like adc ahri, adc sona, mid taric(with jungle yi), Garen/Yuumi bot."

leagueoflegends,fcts2xi,t3_eisvor,1577956576.0,"I feel like 6 items would benefit hyper carries way too hard.

Maybe a budget that lets you buy around 3-4 items depending on their cost.

So about 10k?

Maybe still have some minor objectives/buildings scattered around to give some strategic depth beyond 'which team comp is better at killing champs'.

Instead of waiting for certain objectives to be complete, maybe the game could end after a certain time limit. Fifteen minutes total, objectives give buffs/points. Kills give points. Every 10 minions gives a point, towers give points. The towers also respawn 30 seconds after they die, but they get stronger. Respawn timers are super short, but the map is still decently sized. Bigger than TT, smaller than SR.

Just spit-balling here. Builds are still important, you can't buy everything. You still gain gold so you can adapt as the game progresses. Multiple ways to score points lets different strats shine, also letting more champs be viable in different ways. I would make the 'Baron' of the map give a ton of points, something to focus on grouping up for big teamfights rather than spending all their time assassinating each other. Map still decently large so things like TF ult or Ryze ult aren't useless."

sonamains,fcj37x2,t1_fciy4ag,1577676153.0,"It's definitely a 'consistency' thing for me.

I used to focus everything on laning, max Q first, never buy boots, rush athenes for the AP, etc.

I think I could still find success doing that, but it feels less consistent. Maybe my adc is ass, and there's no getting ahead in lane. I'd regret not rushing mobis and being able to attend skirmishes across the map.

Maybe we just get camped by the enemy jungle and we fall to far behind and I'm stuck with Q max in a lane where we lose trades. I'd prefer to have more points in heal to keep us healthier/safer in a losing lane.

And same goes for mid-late game, some comps just aren't easy to get damage on. Assassins, burst mages, or even just tanks with CC can end Sona. But if I maxed Q, and built Lich Bane, I'm going to feel obligated to try to maximize my damage output as much as possible and sometimes it's just not safe to do so. With heal max and support items, I can always be safely spamming heals to my team regardless if we're ahead or behind.

It's just less risky for me overall, I will say that when I win lane hard, I'll put more points into Q and maybe buy a sheen. But I always default to a healing build."

sonamains,fch0cgo,t3_eh83nl,1577645944.0,"I think I have a different playstyle than most, you can find success in building full support and maxing heal first after 2 or 3 points in Q.

I usually focus on debuffing the enemy as optimally as possible. I use mobi's with purple power chord to catch enemies out, or green power chord if a fight is about to happen.

I rarely use blue power chord outside of laning. Her heal is pretty bad early, I'd avoid using it as much as possible until you get a few points into it and buy a few mana regen items. During laning just focus on safely getting your sightstone/manaflow band. 

A lot of people will focus on damage as Sona, but I go the opposite way with Ardent, Athene's, Redemption, Crucible, etc.

You'll be dropping fat heals all over the place, and might even force them to spend money on executioners. I like focusing on her heals over damage because generally mid-late game it's hard to keep up in damage with everyone else, especially if laning didn't go well. It's easier to stay alive if you only dip in for debuffs then focus on buffing teammates. 

I think people underestimate being able to spam heals constantly on teammates who will always let you near them over trying to spam Q's and power chords on opponent who will either run away or try to fight back. While focusing on healing, you'll have a huge advantage in longer engagements like sieges or around objectives. She really hits her stride mid-game with ardent and mobis, being able to rack up assists all over the map."
