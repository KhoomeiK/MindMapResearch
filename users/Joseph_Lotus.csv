Fortnite is a good game. Congratulations, if you're reading this part, you've officially attempted reading two sentences before downvoting me into oblivion. Now if you enjoy reading this crap, I'll go on. Fortnite isn't a bad *game*, it's just that its following happens to appeal to a younger generation of self-imposed gamers. Its popularity is the only reason that it's become what it is. Now I'll go off on a limb and say that peer pressure is literally why I hopped down this rabbit hole. I'm a JoJo fan anxiously waiting for JoJolion's coloration to be further completed, and if that doesn't say how suceptible to peer pressure I am, I don't know what will.

Now I'll proceed why to explain why people find Fortnite so unbelievably abysmal. Well, I've come up with three reasons, with only one that I actually agree with; It keeps trying to preserve dead memes. Epic is just always late to hop on the bandwagon. Remember Howard the Alien? That meme started around June of 2018. And Epic released the Extraterrestrial into the item shop at about June of 2019. Kinda late for the meme, if I say so myself.

Now on the other hand, the other issue people have with the game are squeakers; children, toddlers, brats that are trying to figure out the game that plauge the 99 player matches. But this is more of an issue someone would have if they just heard about tidbits of the game on online chats, rather than give the game an actual game a chance. No, the people that play the game aren't that bad. It might be that I only play on Switch, but I'm yet to meet anyone who's really that annoying on Squads match. I think this is mostly due to the **actual** demographic for the game. If you hop into a duos game with fill on, the chance of you getting a teammate around the ages of 6-8 are miniscule compared to the chances of getting a 11-13 year old that knows perfectly what they're doing. The only reason you think someone that young would be on Xbox Live at 6 in the afternoon playing Fortnite would be a six year old is because they're more vocal in their interest in videogames. I still remember getting bullied in 6th grade for being vocal about my love for Pok√©mon. When something that you like starts to get shamed by everyone, you get the message that sharing your positive opinion will get you shamed. Fortnite is aimed towards teens and younger gamers that are interested in the competitive scene. And that's exactly what mist of its playerbase is comprised of. This also leads me to my next point.

Now tell me, what makes Fortnite a bad ***game***? Fortnite is massive success that, functionally, is exactly what a developer wants their game to be. It's a widely appealing competitive game with balanced combat and a fair playing field with an intricate, game-changing mechanic (Building, in this case). What other games out there has ever, **ever** filled that quota? Off the top of my head, all I can really think of is the Super Smash Bros. franchise. But not even Smash can say that it's competitive scene is pushing hand-eye coordination far past its own limits. Fortnite's building is insane in how linear and functional it is. Fortnite as a game is a rocket made of popsicle sticks and duct tape and its building is like the rocket fuel that's going to send that shit to Pluto.

Okay, but Fortnite can't just be hated for its outdated memes and young playerbase. It has great gameplay that sends player capability of the scale. Then why do we hate it so much. Well, tell me if you can spot the similarity between everything in this short list: Homestuck, Undertale, Fortnite, Eddsworld, Hazbin, and Five Nights at Freddy's. Did you catch it? Every single one of these are high-effort pieces of art that were (""Is,"" in Hazbin's case) killed by their own appeal and fanbases. Albeit, all of these but Eddsworld are still alive, but their appeal is now very rocky. We've started associating stories by the people who read them rather than the stories themselves."

Little of these people could ever say that they did nearly as much as Soleimani did for that entire country.

The United States is a bizarre, bizarre place where we despise the people ruling over us and stick to our art. Iran has the great misunderstanding that America, as a country, is attacking them.
