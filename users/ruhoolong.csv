I seldom order tea when out - coffee is more likely to be of an ok enough standard.

Some studios were banging these things out, and popular religious scenes, like factories.

It is worth bearing in mind the motivations for having these portraits done - it had little to do with having a nice picture of oneself or one's wife to hang in one's living quarters, and more to do with a display of power or wealth or piety (in the context of having oneself painted into a religious scene, though this too was for political reasons) or to mark dynastic marriages that were little different to commercial mergers today. For high status women in Renaissance Italy, being wealthy and powerful enough to form a marriage with someone similar would have been deemed far more important than being beautiful, and being able to make such marriages *without* being physically desirable was a mark of her worth as a political player.

At least one method of lighting the stove in the Kelly, and if you don't want to carry water with you, then some way to filter the water from streams.

If the Kelly is too expensive or you don't want to have to carry it upright, then an aluminium camping bottle and a pocket stove, plus a second metal mug to heat the water in (which later becomes the pitcher). Thermos flask if you'll be in areas where using flame would be risky."

My ordering has been thrown all out of kilter due to logistic-related issues of my own just as I was close to settling into a pattern, so can't give you much info on my habits, other than that I like to have ~2 staples that I don't really need to think about, plus occasional latitudinal explorations of mid-range stuff within styles on the side - mostly with a view to selecting up to 3 for when I want something special/different to the staples.

I'd put them a smidge above Twinings, with a bigger range, but overpriced for the quality. Before the internet gave people easier access to specialist vendors, high street chains like Whittards were pretty useful. They also sell coffees, hot chocolate, and equipment.

If you will be pouring it out, some form of strainer would be useful, but if you can't afford one just now, a fork or the edge of a saucer should work well enough to keep the tealeaves from getting poured as well.

I don't mind the latter at all, as it keeps costs down, and though it does mean a longer chain of trust, arguably a bulk importer is easier to have faith in than a sole operator, who could just really really like tea but be pretty clueless when it comes to the rest of the business.

Oolongs are kinda famous for tasting like an array of fruits, blossoms and other botanical things, but a vendor might find it easier to label as ""almond oolong"" or ""white grape oolong"" for marketing purposes, and a lot of oolong names in Chinese refer to the most prominent flavour in each anyhow."

Anyhow, instead of rules, a similar regulatory effect was created by making one feel utterly wrong-in-the-head for wanting to do a given thing or liking some thing/person/place/idea, and then one or two very over-the-top threats of physical intervention if certain (admittedly unhealthy) behaviours ever arose in the distant future. I was an adult before stuff like toddlers or teenagers sulking or having a hissy fit stopped confusing me.

Typed out that all sounds quite strange, but it was quite relaxed because I was just well-behaved always and things weren't very regimented."

fragrance,fdmsa8t,t3_ely7ge,1578563283.0,"About 30 years ago, I was an unaccompanied minor on a shorthaul Aer Lingus flight and the cabin crew gave me a small bottle as a gift. No notion why - they made it seem like a friendly gesture that they regularly just do, haha. It is lovely stuff."

So I'm really feeling like the most uncultured swine now - I have a hole poked in a half-spent tealight that sits on a soapdish, use old tweezers to rescue the end before the hot tip reaches the wax, then lay that across the ashes that fell onto the soapdish so the last few millimetres of the stick get enough air to burn."

So a political photo!

Many subreddits have topic flairs so users can filter submissions according to their preferences. You've posed your query to an automated post that explains this."

~~If you scroll down past the first paragraph [here](https://philofaxy.blogspot.com/2016/11/il-bisonte-agenda-insider.html) there is an image of a collection of items that have barely darkened, followed by a second image showing the sorts of colours they can go.~~

notebooks,fdlxyb4,t3_eltj44,1578535155.0,Maybe ask over at r/Hobonichi if anyone in the opposite position to you would be willing to sell you their book for the later half of the year?
hobonichi,fdlst18,t3_elpcuf,1578531652.0,"Mine has a smell, which is more noticeable than notebooks usually have, and which is absent in the Hobonichi A6 notebook which I got at the same time and which has been opened less. The smell is much stronger in at the spine. It isn't impacting me the way yours is, but I'm not pregnant.

I'd try airing yours out a bunch more, possibly clipped up by the covers so air can circulate around the pages.

That said, I'd think it is unlikely that it could harm you or your baby, so it's just a matter of seeing if you can get it to a point where it is comfortable enough to use."
Incense,fdkhuzg,t3_elnp2i,1578504177.0,"Yeah, that study is looking at the effect on the levels of airborne *pathogens* in rooms fumigated with incense smoke.

It says nothing at all about the effect of incense smoke on *humans* (and other mammals).

The most you can take from it is that using incense to fumigate public spaces may have a role in reducing the spread of some infections. It doesn't mean that spending time in spaces as they are being fumigated is safe for human health. You can probably use tobacco smoke to kill pathogens also, but we know that exposure to tobacco smoke is bad for human health. 

And until relatively recently, smoking tobacco was believed to be medicinal. Traditional doesn't equate to safety."
