getdisciplined,fcxpl1b,t1_fcxac6e,1578068471.0,Yea I'm studying for the LSAT and like to do a few hours a day. When I start school in a week or so I be in class from 9am - 2pm with extra curriculars starting around 5-7 and lasting most of the night. So I don't see myself wanting to study after class. I'd like to wake up early and get my studying done before class. Seems like the moral of the story is go to bed earlier
getdisciplined,fcx8xxt,t3_ejd57p,1578055869.0,This is amazing! How do you get yourself up so early? Whenever I try to wake up that early (well never that early but 6ish) I either turn my alarm off and go back to bed or lay in bed doing nothing for a while. One of my 2020 goals is to get into a morning routine like this
LetsNotMeet,fcup677,t1_f5l4552,1577985712.0,What was the purpose of including that you're a white woman?
LSAT,fcsudvn,t1_fcss2y9,1577925349.0,Okay it seems like it's worth buying. And I agree with you about PS. I think that's one of my biggest hurdles in studying for the LSAT. I'm the kind of person who needs to understand the whole concept
LSAT,fcrz57l,t1_fcrxmmv,1577908748.0,Thank you! What do you consider the basics? Does it cover conditional linkage?
productivity,fcmibsu,t3_ehv1x7,1577776418.0,"I use the Flora app. You basically set an amount of time for yourself and the app acts as a timer. Each time you start it you 'plant a seed' and if you don't leave the app you grow something like a tree or flower. Each thing you grow appears in your garden. You can also have your 'seeds' turned into an actual tree in a developing country for a small fee. I believe there's an Android app that's basically the same thing but does the real tree thing for free. If you break the timer instead of appearing in your garden your feed will say ""[Name] killed a tree!] or something like that. I find that it incentivises me to stay focused.

Also, it helps a lot if you have one space for one purpose. I'm not sure what 'home' means for you but when I want to study in my house I make sure to leave my bedroom and study at the dining room table. If I'm in my dorm room I sit at my desk or go to a study room. I find that if I try to study in my bedroom or in bed it's too easy for me get distracted and so something else. By sitting at the dining room table or my desk, which I don't really do for any other purpose, it kind of solidifies in my brain that we're in ""study mode""."
DecidingToBeBetter,fclghar,t1_fckvo0l,1577747232.0,"Do you have any concrete ways to improve in this? I struggle with discipline in doing the things that I know are good for me but don't want to do, and I believe a large part of the problem comes down to self love. I know that I need to love and respect myself enough to know that I deserve those things and owe it to myself to them but how do I learn to love and respect myself more?"
suggestmeabook,fcksiax,t3_ehnubu,1577732236.0,"Literally any V.C. Andrews series. You've probably already heard of Flowers in the Attic but if you read the whole series it gets really twisted in terms of family, inheritance and parentage. Also the Casteel series (books: Heaven, Dark Angel, Fallen Hearts, Gates of Paradise and Web of Dreams) and the Cutler series (books: Dawn, Secrets of the Morning, Twilight's Child, Midnight Whispers, and Darkest Hour) are really good too."
getdisciplined,fc3s3x6,t3_efwncg,1577397222.0,"I’m currently studying intensely for the LSAT and here’s what I do. I’m not sure what you’re studying for or how transferable this info is, but here goes. To start, I have a plan. A long term plan that spans from now until my test date and that I’ve broken down into monthly and weekly goals or things to know by the end of that period. At the start of the week I give myself daily “assignments” which can be actual problems to do or just sections of my prep books to read. For the day to day studying, I start early when I have the most motivation, around 8 am. I like to work in intervals as I find that it keeps me motivated and prevents burnout. Even when I get to that point where I don’t want to read anymore, the knowledge that I only have x amount of minutes left of this interval helps me push through. Separate each interval with a timed break. I do 35 minute intervals because that’s the length of each section of the LSAT with ten minute breaks because it’s a good amount of time for me to sufficiently wind down without getting too relaxed. The biggest thing that I think helps me is I celebrate my wins, no matter how small. If I learned a new concept or answered a tough question or anything that I think pushes me further toward my goal score, I celebrate it with a song, a snack or whatever during my next break. It sounds kind of silly but I think it keeps me from feeling helpless in the shadow of this daunting exam. I hope this helped. Good luck on your exam!"
lawschooladmissions,fbs7kfh,t1_fbs5s35,1577051342.0,"This was so helpful, thanks so much!! Since the end of sophomore year my primary focus has been raising my GPA. I was able to bring it from a 3.2 to where it is now at 3.45. If I achieve straight As next semester which I think is feasible I'll finish my junior year with a 3.54. I may also take two summer classes. From these responses I'm seeing that maybe April isn't the best idea, but Im going to prep as if Im taking it in April and take it as I go. I may end up doing June or July instead. I definitely plan on taking it twice. For college apps I took the SAT twice and went up 70 points!! Not saying it's the same but it's worth a shot.

Thanks for explaining the safety/target/reach thing! 
It helps a lot."
