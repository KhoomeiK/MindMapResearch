fatlogic,ffdb3e1,t3_esucfr,1579817043.0,"Tom Kerridge is doing another weight loss show on the BBC. 

I really like his recipes, he does a good job of putting flavour in and taking calories out, and he believes in good large portion sizes. 

He, of course, has a book out to go with the series, but there's some freebie recipes on the BBC site. Enjoy.

fatlogic,ffbxvzj,t1_ffbkk1q,1579786280.0,"I'd recommend Pembrokeshire, it's beautiful. The National Trust have some lovely holiday cottages on Stackpole head about half a mile from a beautiful beach, Barafundle Bay. Highly recommended. Solva is pretty too."
fatlogic,ffa92n8,t1_ffa1qlo,1579730264.0,Good luck!
fatlogic,ff9pv18,t1_ff9lx7q,1579718290.0,"Quite. 

I'd take a really good burger and a SMALL portion of really good triple cooked chips over that any day.

Tom Kerridge is great at really good healthy burgers and some of his recipes are huge and come in at under 500 cals a pop including a well chosen bun. I'd take that with a decent portion of triple cooked chips over that sad salad any day."
fatlogic,ff9pe79,t1_ff9gy4p,1579717955.0,:D They were £12.50 a pop. M&S is surprisingly affordable for basics that I will wear and wear :)
fatlogic,ff9gurl,t1_ff9ggqu,1579712732.0,M&S super plain elasticated trousers are my jam as a shorty in the UK. Not trendy or sexy but covers my bits and cheap.
fatlogic,ff9gm5y,t1_ff9g4vx,1579712585.0,":D

True, still eww, soggy lettuce (tbf the salad in question is a bit more... structurally sound looking at evidence elsewhere on the thread than lettuce :), I'd still ditch the soggy onion things, I reckon the rest could be salvaged)"
fatlogic,ff9gffa,t1_ff9fzfp,1579712469.0,"Maybe set a percentage aside for something you would like to do, a holiday, an experience, something? That's a major habit to kick. Anywhere you'd really like to go on holiday? Somewhere epic you'd like to eat? Racetrack experience? IDK :)"
fatlogic,ff9g6ui,t1_ff9fzuh,1579712327.0,"I screamed when I clicked on that link.

Fuck me. I could find so many nicer ways to spend over 2000 calories.

I still reckon people will sadly pick that as the healthy choice though. And that's the saddest thing."
fatlogic,ff9fk1n,t1_ff9erds,1579711940.0,"That sounds amazing! There's only two of us and my partner is only home two out of 7 nights each week or I would buy a lot more whole stock in that way - I just can't get through it so order a box or two from local farmers. Most of the beef that isn't roast comes from that. I did 12 portions of stew from 900g chuck a couple of months ago. I reckon you will know this but for anyone watching, stew gets better reheated and umami raising ingredients (mushrooms, tomato puree, anchovies etc) help a ton. Also you will make awesome bone broth / stock. Welcome to stew and cottage pie country :)"
fatlogic,ff9f1l2,t1_ff9et3i,1579711621.0,"To add to the debate I am on team the top two need more protein for me to consider them a meal, and maybe some fat (I personally find fat very satiating and a low fat diet makes me very unhappy). The other two if the macros are good look fine meal replacements to me. Maybe not every meal, but perfectly sustainable in the context of a healthy diet."
fatlogic,ff9et3i,t3_escalz,1579711474.0,"I'm curious OP. Explain the context for this a bit more? (Don't dox anyone obvs, but I am genuinely curious as to how this graphic came about)"
fatlogic,ff9ei7g,t1_ff90xxu,1579711284.0,I never roast a chicken without making a stock / chicken strip thing from the gravy and chicken leftovers. Ramen? Yep. Chicken and sweetcorn soup? Yep. Chicken tagine / curry / chili? Yep. Add the starch and spice components of your choice. I made 10 portions of an epic goose tagine out of the goose leftovers from Christmas (and that was salvaging the sandwich meat beforehand). Meat can just be used as a seasoning. A little if good flavour goes a heck of a long way :)
fatlogic,ff9e5m4,t1_ff976j0,1579711060.0,This little wholesome exchange is why I like this sub :)
fatlogic,ff9dya5,t1_ff96133,1579710929.0,Eww. Soggy lettuce :)
fatlogic,ff9dwj0,t1_ff93s53,1579710895.0,"I'll trust you because that was very small print but what the actual fuck do you do to a salad to make that happen? (Yes, I know, it's probably bacon, cheese, croutons and ranch dressing, but shush). What's heartbreaking is someone will pick that instead of the burger thinking it's the healthy option. (although I think they have a lower calorie range too? I don't Cheesecake Factory, wrong country, I am familiar with them from living in Japan a while ago)."
fatlogic,ff9c4d0,t1_ff8xpwg,1579709601.0,£15 a day is impressive in an aghast sort of a way (and I say that as a fat fucker :) ). Congrats on kicking that. Have you got a plan for the money you are saving?
fatlogic,ff6nl1h,t1_ff6hio1,1579631016.0,"Everyone got auto enrolled?

Nope. Nopety nope nope nope nopetopus.

Opt in with minimal peer pressure to take part, I guess. What on earth were they thinking?"
loseit,ff3fz9j,t3_er67ar,1579540264.0,Really nicely written :)
fatlogic,fezv8wv,t1_fezuwpc,1579462100.0,"I should add since I see you're not in the US, I just use boring old tomato puree as the base!"
fatlogic,fezuwpc,t1_feromha,1579461976.0,"Her diet plan is vast tracts of woo, but I find some of Haylie Pomroy's recipes useful. I make a similar tomato ketchup to this but I don't bother with the stevia since I prefer it less sweet. Hope it helps!

Nerd Fitness has some easy starter bodyweight exercises, too, which are well explained (you can buy a one off sub for more exercise programmes but you really don't need to to start off with).

(I have an estranged parent who never parented properly also, and having minimal contact has been one of the best things for my mental health I've ever done. So that's my bias :) )"
