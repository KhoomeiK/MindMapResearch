I did my Ambassador tour at their facility, Mr. Samuels came up and introduced himself which he certainly didn't need to do, but it was an amazingly warm welcome to sign in and have the owner walk up and introduce himself. All that did was make me like them more. People love to talk bad about it in here because well, I guess because it's not a rare find and it might not meet their desires in bourbon. 

I also think OGD BiB is not so great, but the overwhelming thought on it in here is that's people love it. 

**But, the best thing about bourbon is that there are so many out there that if you don't like one, you can easily find another that you do enjoy.** I can do without the downvotes or bashing on one's favorite simply because others don't agree. It's almost like we have our own opinions, that doesn't make any of us wrong though.

So yeah, a jar of coins at the time was maybe a couple hundred bucks (a lot at the time) and during the recession people would rather his their stash than potentially lose it.

Gold Confiscation of 1933

What Was the 1933 Gold Confiscation?

Amidst the Great Depression, the United States government decided to remove itself from the gold standard. Many individuals and foreign governments had started converting their currency to gold, which restricted the American supply of circulated currency. So, on April 5, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102. This forbade “the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates” by American citizens.

Did Roosevelt Confiscate All Gold?

US citizens were given until May 1 of 1933 to turn in their gold. In exchange, they would be compensated $20.67 per ounce. The penalties for refusing to turn in gold were set by an amendment of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and were set as a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to ten years.
