eldertrees,ffaprry,t3_esim1y,1579741628.0,"I live in a legal state, and prefer edibles over smoking. I enjoy 1, 10 mg candy once a week or so, but will occasionally curl up in bed with a movie, and take 2, so 20mg. I don't really like going much more than that, because I still have a nice time with a smaller amount. 

One of my favorite routines is to get food prepped while I'm waiting for the edible to kick in, then enjoy a delicious dinner right when I'm feeling tingly, then take a shower (I've been known to keep the lights off and enjoy it like a sensory experience) brush my teeth, and curl up in fresh pajamas to watch some beautiful, make something interesting, or listen to some music. Be safe, and enjoy!"

solotravel,ff5c946,t3_erkut0,1579586994.0,"I think what's most important is to realize that your experience traveling will be *yours.* Two people on a trip might walk into a restaurant and have completely different opinions; one might find it rustic, and the other might find it dated. Your travel experiences and offering you a glimpse of the world in a new place, and however you interact with those places is valid. I tend to enjoy bus tours as a part of visiting a new place, typically day 1; if I arrived fairly early, it's a great way to see things and relax, unwinding after a day of travel.  This gives me a chance make sure that I see the highlights, know why a certain place is important, and then I'll have an idea of where I want to spend my week.

Your experiences and your memories are just that- yours. See what's important to you, be open to trying some new things now and again, but embrace what you're passionate about."

SuicideWatch,fej6mwf,t1_fej5d0a,1579159062.0,"Thanks! I'm smitten. :) At this point in time, I think I'd like my next holiday to be to the UK. I was in the Netherlands (Amsterdam) in November, and Australia in August, but before that I was in Ireland, and London and Paris before that, and I really loved it.

I think I try and go places that are new, because I know how much of a privilege it is to be able to see the world, even in a fairly moderate way. 

About half of my travels happened by sheer good luck and accommodation... My aunt and uncle were taking a family trip with their son, and they'd scored a great deal on a flight and hotel package. They were a family of three, and the deal was for four people, so they offered to let me tag along for the price of 80 percent of my ticket, $500. We spent 9 days in Ireland on a road trip in a tiny car driving on the wrong side of the road, and dealing with an engine that shuts off when the brake is pressed. It was wonderful, and kind of panicky, and the chance was kind of miraculously affordable. I paid for my food, and everything else was included; for a millennial working at a retail shop, it was the world. 

Anyway, I know what a privilege it is to see the world a little bit, as it really is.

Plan a trip out here! October is absolutely lovely."

Queer Eye

Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse

[Here's a favorite](https://youtu.be/CueqWS68SBY).

My best friend is a former ICU nurse, who also has a chronic illness which has hospitalized her multiple times. She's shared through her own experiences and working with many terminally ill patients that you reach a level of openness about your body and experiences after significant hospital stays. 

One patient and his family in particular was loved by their staff, and he and his mom specifically encouraged a culture of laughter, joy and life in his hospital room, and through his passing. She wanted people to take pictures with him, and to have the chance to remember beautiful times with her son, despite the circumstances. He was here, he was my son, and I loved him throughout his entire life. After his passing, the entire ICU staff was invited to his funeral, and the hospital got coverage so that the nurses who worked with him could attend. The patient's mom wrote a blog about her experiences and the real life journey of watching her son battle and eventually succumb to his illness - which is also why I'm able to share the story, because it's not a violation of privacy. 

Baasically, I'd guess that this was a long time coming, that hospital life has become somewhat normal, and OP is celebrating his marriage and the love he's had for his life, but sharing a little bit of her with us."

This is a way to remember, to mark the passage of time, the significance of loving someone till death, and sharing the joy which comes from having final moments together at all.

I went on a trip a couple months ago, and period wasn’t due until a few days out and I forgot my cup. Picked up some tampons and forgot how frequently you have to change them!!"
AmItheAsshole,fdpw6v5,t1_fdpu8v7,1578643036.0,"Menstrual cup FTW, friend. ;)"
AmItheAsshole,fdpw2i6,t3_emimf3,1578642889.0,"Aww! NTA. I think this is super sweet, and that you were being considerate and kind. Periods are a regular occurrence and perfectly normal; shame and stigma regarding menstruation helps no one."
DuggarsSnark,fdpu5zk,t1_fdptiud,1578640612.0,"I’m suuuuper grateful that my parents are pretty progressive, and genuinely homeschooled me and my brother for academic reasons and not with the primary objective of sheltering us. There was always a “we can stop this and go to a traditional school” mentality, and we took it year by year. My personal transition was a breeze, but my cousins were raised pretty fundamentalist, and I had some friends who were beyond Duggar level conservative and knowing them was an experience in and of itself."
DuggarsSnark,fdpt7bt,t1_fdpt24c,1578639527.0,"Aww, thank you! I was homeschooled for most of my life, and had some very close connections with fundamentalists, many of whom have walked away now; it was an interesting journey and I have a lot of empathy for the kids who have been raised in these systems."
DuggarsSnark,fdps23o,t1_fdp8qqt,1578638292.0,"I messaged her on Instagram, but never heard back- which is fine. Basically just said that she had a friend if she needed to talk. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

AskReddit,fdmh8o1,t1_fdme3qk,1578549827.0,"That’s some really decent parenting, for both you and your son’s mom. I’m sure that he’ll appreciate it at some point."
AskReddit,fdmghzx,t3_elzbiv,1578549107.0,"There are so many kinds of snow that you can get! The experience in general is cold, and occasionally icy, but sometimes it can be really fine and powdery, sometimes it’s heavy and wet, sometimes it’s right in between, which is good for  building things."
Documentaries,fdmgd0u,t1_fdmg58u,1578548977.0,"PBS spoiled me for pretty much any other network. Interesting content about the world and your community... like NPR, but with painting classes. My parents refused to get cable, and I’m really grateful for that, now."
television,fdm9tpu,t1_fdlvai1,1578543416.0,"He really would be a great host. I was chatting about this with my family the other day, and mentioned that I really, desperately hope that they don’t hire just another performer or entertainer to be the host. Whomever is next up should be whip smart and calm."
Documentaries,fdm94w9,t1_fdl30td,1578542897.0,"I also grew up watching his show, and have continued to love it as an adult. He combines tourist highlights with actual history and significance, while remaining respectful of the other county. He doesn’t try to hide being s guest, but takes it as a chance to appreciate something new, and I can respect the hell out of that."

FundieSnark,fdm2cfd,t3_em13q9,1578538145.0,"My parents waited a few years before having kids, and I’m grateful, because they were ready, prepared, and stable. Here’s hoping more people in the community will adopt that mindset."
FundieSnark,fdjo73n,t3_elk0zp,1578480487.0,"I know that this isn't the point, but her part about how basically God withholds knowledge from us so that we'll be dependent upon them is so abusive, shitty, and also not in line with a lot of actual teaching from Jesus."
