starwarsmemes,fecpnek,t1_fecnomg,1578980132.0,"Having Feige involved in both doesn’t mean the work is homogenized - good storytellers can craft in either universe.  Favreau’s lived in both and has been able to deliver distinct work with a distinct voice in both franchises.  

And I wouldn’t mistake Marvel’s consistency for lack of distinct vision either.  For example, look at the sizable divide between Thor Ragnorok and Black Panther in terms of tone and aesthetic.  Those movies were released within 4 months of each other. 

Lastly - the Feige/Favreau team up is the collaboration that gave us Iron Man."
