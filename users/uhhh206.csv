EDAnonymous,fer4uui,t1_fepnpuq,1579349834.0,"That's how it was for me, and it was so easy! It wasn't even a conscious effort; everything was about what felt healthy (with some treats thrown in), and gaining pregnancy weight didn't bother me at all. I gained a healthy amount (didn't ""let myself go"", but also didn't restrict) and lost it easily afterwards.

I know that's not how it is for everyone, of course, but for me, it really did go down just like you said. Baby came first, and it didn't occur to me to have a problem with that. Crazy to think back to the following decade of being functionally cured of my ED, all thanks to an experience that many women with EDs find traumatizing."

It's another insidious way colorism is pushed as a beauty standard, and because it doesn't pit two different women against each other, people don't call it out as such.

If it ""isn't that deep"" then I guess I'm in the kiddy pool with you, because this sort of thing really bothers me."
fatlogic,fehfktc,t1_fehc0mf,1579115515.0,"Does it read as threatening the animal with death? I read it the same as a ""someone call CPS"" comment about shitty parenting. Like, saying animal control should take the animal away from an abusive owner (since this definitely puts the animal's life and health in danger, which I think most people would say constitutes abuse), akin to how CPS taking a kid away means putting them in foster care, not killing them. From the title and other responses, it wouldn't have occurred to me that OP was suggesting euthanizing the animal."

It's a shame that even with the progress that we have made in getting rape culture more acknowledged, a lot of people still shrug off -- if not outright laugh at -- the ways that rape culture victimizes boys and men. Not to mention the body shaming that society tolerates when it's men being mocked (eg: small dick jokes).

I'm a woman, so I'm able to call these things out without it being turned around as an accusation that I take offense because I'm taking it personally. Everyone should do that, since a lot of people will reflexively attack when criticized by the opposite sex."

Even setting week-long goals is a great idea with successes worth celebrating.

The fact that you point this out, and phrase it this way, suggests that part of the reason you accept this behavior from a partner is that you're used to abuse (either verbal or otherwise, either from family or former partners). 

You deserve better than this, because *everyone* deserves better than this. Sounds like you know what you need to do, and I hope typing it out and thinking about how it looks to an objective outsider helps you find the strength to actually do it and end this relationship."

EDAnonymous,fcmegih,t1_fclmjl8,1577772294.0,"Honestly, I do kinda get that vibe sometimes. No shade at all to anyone in the sub, but it's got to be painful to be overweight from BED (or recovery from restrictive EDs, or any other reason they're overweight) and see people shrug off shockingly low weights as not that thin -- especially if it feels like a humblebrag about how sick they are. Again, totally not trying to shame or shade anyone for being honest about their weight or their BDD (I'd be a hypocrite of so, since I am flared as UW), but I feel badly for people seeing that and being insecure or feeling invalidated."

Even a deviation due to high muscle mass is not sufficient so that a BMI into the category past overweight, past obese, straight on into morbid obesity without also having an additional excess of body fat.

Jason Momoa has a BMI of 28.2, which is overweight but not obese. Are you seriously going to argue that someone can be 50 lbs heavier than him and such pure muscle that they wouldn't also have a surplus of body fat? Come on."
dataisbeautiful,fcj5hk6,t1_fcj51m0,1577677759.0,"BMI tends to list people as a healthy weight when they are over-fat; the number of people who are a healthy body fat percentage but overweight by BMI are far, far fewer.

Lots of people want to think they're an exception and they aren't fat in spite of objective measurements saying they are. So few people are a healthy weight these days that being overweight isn't recognized as such. It's just normal.

If you're a man with a waist over 40"", or a woman with a waist over 35"", or either sex with a waist > half of your height measurement, then you're almost certainly an unhealthy amount fat. The same is true if you have a BMI in the obese category or worse."

EDAnonymous,fc3ylkx,t1_fc1wly6,1577401983.0,"He knows about your eating disorder and still said something like that... and you've convinced yourself you're being overly sensitive? That breaks my heart to read.

You aren't being overly sensitive; this was an extremely hurtful thing for him to say. Whether he was trying to hurt your feelings or not, it shows a toxic disregard for your physical and emotional well-being.

It makes me so sad to see the behavior that people here tolerate from their partners while convinced that it would be unreasonable to expect better. I know how hard it is to let go of someone you're reliant on, and how easy it is to focus on the good while telling yourself the bad isn't a big deal, but this is not okay. I think if you were able to see your relationship as an outsider, you'd realize a lot of other behavior from him that is sabotaging your ability to feel good about yourself.

If you're going to stay with him, please at very least accept that this is NOT okay. You deserve better than this, and if you think you don't, it is your eating disorder lying to you. You deserve love and support, and I hope you can believe that and, in time, come to a place where you accept nothing less. ❤️"
EDAnonymous,fc3x6rh,t3_eg0qz4,1577400932.0,"Having the same BMI could make one person bigger than the other in objective terms, but the fact that you wear the same size in spite of being taller than her means that you're proportionately smaller, not bigger.

Your parents are dumb and if you have lost weight to get to the size you are now, they're probably thinking of what you used to look like and not really registering the difference in how your appearance has changed.
