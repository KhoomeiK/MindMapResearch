I think you're partly right in saying his scummy business dealing are about him making money but in this case, his racist view of black people was that they are bad tenants and don't pay their rent. So part of it was his racist viewpoints that to him impacted his bottom line, but it was also a general negative view of black people. He also apparently said that people wouldn't want to live with black people or something like that.

He was also sued again in 1978 for continuing to refuse to rent to black tenants and for violating the terms of the initial settlement.

An argument could be made that the airlines should implement the training themselves since they should know about the system (and airlines in the US I believe did do this), which I would agree with, but I still think the FAA should issue some kind of ""training might be required"" message, or something along those lines.
