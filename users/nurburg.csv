I'm going to have to find a book that focuses on the technical aspects of his designs. The movie seemed to capture all the political fuckery really well but it's not intended for an engineering audience

Also according to the film the reason he abandoned H3 was that he realized that he could not compensate for the turning motion of the ship. So every turn / course correction accrued errors to the measurement. I don't know if that's true, just repeating the movie."

You have no idea what you're talking about. This mentality is a lot more prevalent than you think. It's just the price of doing business. Of course they don't LIKE jail but it's just an acceptable risk. Even a rite of passage or a point of pride for many.

programming,fegxpb6,t3_eoj3je,1579104854.0,"Wow this brings me back, I had a similar project back in the early 2000s. I was learning a lot about opengl and Ray Trace rendering. There was a very optimized set pixel function written in assembly that was used in a book I had. I'll try to find out what book it was (edit: I'm pretty sure it was from this book by Abrash, and it was great because he focused on the nitty-gritty details under the hood of rasterization, http://www.phatcode.net/res/224/files/html/index.html) 

So using this plot pixel function I was able to code up the kind of accepted best algorithms for drawing a line and drawing a flat filled triangle (probably bresenham). Then I was able to expand it to enable gouraud  and phong shading. I created a simplified  OpenGL API of my own that used the software rasterization lib I had created to do the actual drawing. It could do lighting, z-buffering, simple textures, and other things I can't remember. My function calls mapped directly to the ones in opengl so you could just change the prefixes and call the real opengl with very little hassle (it was also very useful for testing). I was then going to write a simple 3D engine on top of that but ended up using actual OpenGL since my software implementation was just too slow). I guess it was a bit like the 3D graphics version of NANDtoTetris in spirit haha. 

Obviously I had the internet and books available but this info was not quite as easy to find 15-20 years ago as it is today. It was a great project and I learned a lot about how things MIGHT work at a lower level. Hope you had a similar experience."

ehhh, I'm not so sure about football being ""safer"". I mean, the term safe can be interpreted very broadly but in terms of brain health I was under the impression that MMA was quite a bit safer. Also by the time guys into the NFL too they've likely been playing nearly a decade or more and who knows many sub-concussive hits they've taken in that time.
