We need to help you find a way to make tomorrow better.  I’m all for getting a small animal. People always claim dogs know when something is going on but I’m a cat person and my cat does a remarkable job of identifying when I’m in trouble and she turns into a purring machine who won’t leave my side.

First things first. 
You are in trouble
You need help
Please call or text

National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:  800-273-TALK (8255)
Crisis TEXT Line: Text HOME to 741741

Talk to them. Give them the chance to listen. Let them help you develop a plan for tomorrow
Please."

Your body didn’t get that way overnight so it’s going to take some time to heal. Fwiw - get tested for food sensitivities if you’re thinking about going non-carnivore. I had no idea but I tested positive for tomatoes, corn, peppers, potatoes, wheat, aspartame, paprika and a few other foods that were causing inflammation.  I still can’t believe anyone can’t eat mashed potatoes but when I do, my joints ache rye next day,"

What is your plan to get the help you need?
C’mon. We can help you figure something out. 
Let us know what’s going on."
depression,fct620j,t3_cml6ni,1577933813.0,"Still sucks. A year ago, I figured out I was in the middle of a psychotic delusion. It took a couple of days but I managed to pull myself out of it. Spent much of that time muttering, “This isn’t real, someone needs to take me to a doctor,” and crawling into bed. A couple of months later, after realizing this has been going on for years (and it explains why I’ve often lost days) I finally got up the courage to tell 3 responsible family members and 2 of their wives, gave them a power of attorney and asked them for help.  To date, they’ve given me a phone number and sent me 2 text messages. They didn’t bother to check in with me for any of the holidays; I doubt they even know what state I’m in,  I can’t do this alone but that’s what I am. Alone.  In a city where I only know one person - a nice old guy but I’ve never met anyone who has so many conspiracy theories about the government.  In tears again today. I’m not really crying or all that upset but tears have been running down my face most of the day - kinda makes it hard to see or do anything,  They were supposed to help,  obviously, I can’t count on them but who else would be willing to help me.  It’s hopeless.  I can’t dig myself out of this hole without some kind of support."
