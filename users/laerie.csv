AskReddit,ffa2vfe,t3_esc8vq,1579726787.0,"Tell her to not be such a bitch and spend more time with her brother before he dies. Don't date RP because he's abusive. Have some fun with other guys in HS and college, but go on match.com in April of 2007 to meet your future husband. Be good to him, he's a catch. Don't get the tattoos, you won't like them in 10 years. Ask Holly and Kiley to be in your wedding party, not Emily, Maria, Laura, and Lisa. Fuck those bitches. Keep your head down and mouth shut when you get your first job. You can't trust the people from a small town not to talk. Get to know Christy better as soon as you meet her because she's seriously cool as fuck and a true friend. And once the baby is born, spend as much time with Tobe as you can, because you have to unexpectedly put him down 3 weeks after she's born and it's a huge blow. Get up and moving, don‚Äôt let yourself get fat."

toptalent,ff3wy7t,t1_ff3pvxh,1579550658.0,Well this is wholesome as fuck.

aww,ff3w77t,t3_eri0cb,1579550188.0,"This makes me so happy. I love that his fur is so white now. It reminds me of my boy Toby. He had a white chest and belly and he was just so pretty and his fur was always clean after we rescued him, just like this kitty. I love you and I will miss you forever, Tobe. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
interestingasfuck,ff2y44k,t1_ff2bngv,1579528322.0,So then he has to do that every time he changes the bulb...? That sucks.
interestingasfuck,ff20uz9,t1_ff1zxk7,1579490804.0,"Yea, damn... OP, how do you get the bulb inside?!"

aww,ferla55,t3_eqgcd6,1579355376.0,The cat on the left looks EXACTLY like my boy Asher.
oddlysatisfying,femjvok,t1_femhii2,1579259296.0,"I‚Äôm happy for you. This may be a dumb question, but does this mean you all are in the clear if the fires get put out? I know there will be lots of rebuilding and rehab for injured animals and whatnot, but hopefully this stops the fires and the air quality will return to normal?

Edit: now I'm sad again"
aww,feepbio,t3_eor6fo,1579038386.0,I absolutely love this.
Damnthatsinteresting,fe3a1mv,t3_enp7ap,1578847366.0,I wonder what the j looks like in relation to an i.
aww,fdz41z0,t3_enetfm,1578786422.0,"Thanks, I hate it."
Eyebleach,fdy5eqe,t3_encqyf,1578776278.0,I love her.
breastfeedingsupport,fdwp2t0,t1_fduh8mu,1578760969.0,"God, triple feeding sounds like absolute hell. It's probably worth it to try though. I've been nursing then giving her a bottle if she's still hungry, but only pumping once or twice a day. Pumping makes the D-MER way worse than nursing, but my supply is not at all where it should be for her right now."
breastfeedingsupport,fdvcq89,t1_fdtppct,1578746037.0,"That's really excellent advice, thank you. My friend told me it was always harder on her right side because she's right handed and was using her left hand to hold her boob. Makes a ton of sense to just keep baby in a working position!"
breastfeedingsupport,fdvbfvk,t1_fdrq3gr,1578745642.0,"Thank you, I'll look into that. I was using a Medela one."
breastfeedingsupport,fdt6lr5,t1_fdq620b,1578712590.0,My husband's cousin told me breathing really helps with nipple pain too so I'm definitely going to try that. Thank you.
breastfeedingsupport,fdt6gs6,t1_fdq631y,1578712537.0,I am combo feeding now. Breastfeeding as much as I can and supplementing with formula since my supply is still too low for her.  I think you‚Äôre right about it being worse at different times. I‚Äôm gonna try to get as much pumping done before 7pm as I can.
breastfeedingsupport,fdt62yk,t1_fdq7k32,1578712399.0,I did find letting them air out helps a lot. But if they accidentally rub on something OMG üò©
breastfeedingsupport,fdt5wv3,t1_fdq9y5z,1578712333.0,I hope mine goes away. üò©
breastfeedingsupport,fdt5v50,t1_fdqc4la,1578712315.0,Omg that sounds awful üò©
breastfeedingsupport,fdt5t5u,t1_fdqd76j,1578712294.0,Thank you. You are so sweet. Feels good to know I have someone I can talk to. So many women have told me it gets better so I'm gonna stick it out. After I got some sleep I felt so much better. Sometimes I just can't deal with life when I haven't gotten enough sleep.
breastfeedingsupport,fdroeln,t1_fdqed31,1578687297.0,I will try the coconut oil while feeding. I was using it while pumping but didn't think to try it before latching her. Thank you.
breastfeedingsupport,fdrnwkn,t1_fdqfaov,1578687221.0,"Thank you. You're right. I would definitely not tell someone feeling that way to power through. We really are too hard on ourselves. I told myself I wouldn't be like this, but everything changed when she came along."
breastfeedingsupport,fdrno9a,t1_fdqt6oe,1578687095.0,"Yes, I used a shield in the hospital and the first week home because of the latching difficulty. She won't latch anymore with the shield. It's too big for her mouth I think...and probably too big for my nipple."
MurderedByWords,fdnj772,t1_fdnfhbv,1578586931.0,She clearly takes no shit. Don't know she'd be fun to 25 eight year olds.
interestingasfuck,fdn97un,t3_ema1fo,1578580641.0,"Thanks, I hate it."
WatchAnimalsDieInside,fdmy90o,t1_fd06cie,1578571095.0,I do agree we missed the best part but I'm also happy that the guy probably ran to help his kitty at moment.
AskReddit,fdmsxio,t1_fdmg2r3,1578564208.0,Adorable. A little family picnic‚ù§Ô∏è
AskReddit,fdmsfp8,t1_fdmbnv8,1578563499.0,Damn that's smart parenting. Only works if you have a responsible life though.
AskReddit,fdmsc8h,t1_fdm6dow,1578563363.0,I think that's seriously adorable. That's a really sweet way to get a child to not hate bedtime and promotes family bonding. Sounds like some awesome parenting.
Chonkers,fd5gnhj,t3_ejye2g,1578177417.0,"He looks great, good for you!!"
Chonkers,fd5gekd,t1_fd4p18k,1578177328.0,I do this with my two boys cats just for funsies. It's really cute. The female chonker does not partake hahaha
todayilearned,fd3gcch,t1_fd2nnd3,1578158079.0,Or get paid more so you can hire someone to clean out the gutters for you.
todayilearned,fcq807b,t1_fcphsra,1577880682.0,"I had never seen that. Awesome, thank you."
aww,fb7hx48,t1_fb7esc7,1576590552.0,I was amazed at how their head markings are exactly the same! So cute.
