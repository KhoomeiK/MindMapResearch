AfterTheEndFanFork,feifv1x,t3_ep233n,1579137558.0,"I just looked into it for a while, and it seems a bit more complex than I thought. You have to change a lot more than the religions file. Also, you can't just copy files without messing up the religions added in 0.5. I think it'd take a couple of steps.

* Look through all your files in 0.5 (or whatever future version you'll be playing) and find all the files where ""rust\_cultist"", ""chrome\_cultist"", and another pagan religion like ""norse"" are mentioned, and then find those files' counterparts in 0.4
* Remove all coding referencing ""chrome\_cultist."" I'm not 100% sure, but I think reformed religions are unable to have another heresy, and I doubt you care much about the Chrome Cultists anyways.
* Then, I would go through all references to ""rust\_cultist."" A lot of them, you should be able to change to ""rust\_cultist\_reformed."" Check the other reformed pagan religions to make sure they have the same code. If so, just change the name of the religion. If not, check the file in 0.4 and see if it's present there for the reformed Rust Cultists. Again, if it is, just change the name.  Otherwise, delete the code.
* However, for things like provinces and characters, they should be left as ""rust\_cultist"" since you're going to want them to be unreformed at the start of the game.
* Go through the references of another pagan religion like ""norse"" or ""revelationist"". If there is any code that is repeated for all pagan religions, make one for ""rust\_cultist"" as well. Cross-reference with the equivalent files from 0.4 if necessary.
* Add the Rust Cultist reformation doctrine from 0.4 to common\\religion\_features\\00\_features.txt, making sure it's following the formatting of the other unique pagan doctrines. 
* If you did all of this, you should have done things like changed the religion of their head and holy order, changed the secret societies (and removed the Chrome Cultist one), and made them reformable. Remember that in 00\_religions.txt, the reformed religion needs to go before the unreformed one.
* In 0.5, they changed the Rust high god from the Omnissiah to Father Ford. You can pick whichever your preference is, but if you choose the Omnissiah you'll have to re-add him to the localisation. Other than that, if there are any differences in flavor between 0.4 and 0.5, it's up to you. 

If that doesn't work, you might just need to delete all references and re-create the rust cult from scratch. Maybe copy over all of the files that reference them from 0.4, delete all of the code in those that don't relate to them, and just add them as separate new files."

SequelMemes,fcgl1ks,t1_fcf6tqy,1577641298.0,"Yeah, one problem I‚Äôve had with most of the new films that seems nitpicky but says a lot about the mindset of the makers is the aliens. The prequels did a good job of, while they added some new ones, keeping some of the same alien species from the Original Trilogy for new background characters, making it seem like there are consistent aliens in the galaxy. And the shows, both the Mandalorian and the animated ones, have worked with this, but most of the new films just have a bunch of completely new ones we‚Äôve never seen before in any other kind of media, and the apparently common alien species like Twi‚Äôleks or Rodians just don‚Äôt go to any of the places the new protagonists visit. It‚Äôs more of the character design team just wanting to make their own new designs, rather than working with established lore, but it takes you out of it when apparently humans outnumber every other species a thousand to one."
