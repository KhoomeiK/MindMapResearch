My university has their own counselors as well as their own health insurance, meaning therapy is actually affordable ( like 25$ per session). We also have a disability resource center where you can go when register if you need extra accomodations, like exceptions or notetakers. I know I'm registering so I can get exempt from living in my sorority house. You can sometimes also get flexible attendence. They will help you out. 
As for social issues what I do is ignore most social situations by taking 22 credits so I physically don't have time to deal with people o don't want to deal with. Sorority helped me find people I genuinely liked."

Okay hear me out here. 
I totally get his side. She is displaying that she doesn't trust him and I completely understand that is extremely hurtful (trust me, I've been in that position)
BUT she is pregnant. I am not saying that gives her any excuses to be an asshole. I can, however, understand that she doesn't want to be compared all the time, or have her husband lose interest because she is not as attractive as the nanny that is always there. Add onto the fact that postpartum depression is a bitch and pregnancy really fucks with your body... Is it a bit unreasonable? Very much so.

Since there's a lot of people who are asking who BTK is here's a quick lowdown:
He was a serial killer who went uncaught for 30 years, starting when he murdered 4 family members by strangulation and suffocation (he had tried to strangle but underestimated the strength it takes, so he resorted to suffocation) The youngest daughter was hung in the basement while he molested her/masturbated (I forget which to be honest but I do know there was a sexual aspect).
Over the next 20 or so years he would go to kill a grand total of 10 people, leaning towards women. He would bind them and strangle them typically. Sometimes, he would take post mortem pictures of the women tied up in heavy bdsm poses. He would also steal their lingerie so he could wear it and take weird BDSM pictures of himself too. 
After he was no longer active, like the dumbass attention whore Dennis Rader is, he decided to leave packaged to be found so he could gain notoriety and fame from the media. He got caught in like 2006 like this: he left a package that ended in a note saying to reply ""all is well, Rex"" in the newspaper if the police cannot track the origins of floppy disks. Well they replied that but of course it was a lie so they were led straight to Rader, who was using his real name on the computer of the church he was president of."
