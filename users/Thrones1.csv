Also the New Atheist movement is incredibly islamiphobic and OP has no clue what the fuck they’re talking about. I’ve been subbed to r/atheism on different accounts for over ten years. The movement can be pretty hateful. Despite being an atheist I proudly support interfaith communities and it’s always disappointing to see atheists be prejudiced against other religious views."

I think it’s important to remember that the news is always being spread by people who seek to profit and they write everything to hook viewers into consuming as much as possible. The news is definitely more alarming right now than it ever has been and taking time out to find uplifting or relaxing news is important. Or you could just tune out altogether if you don’t mind the moral implications of willing ignorance.

The sex drive thing is real and you’re not alone. Depression kills your drive and the meds that fix depression also lower sex drive. I think wondering if you’re asexual is normal for depressed people. I’m glad at least if my venting made you feel less alone.

I would think I’m ace but I do find a lot of things attractive and I do jerk off. Depression doesn’t really get in the way of self indulgence. But when depression is really hitting me it feels impossible to be physically intimate with another person. Forcing myself to be intimate to keep my relationship healthy just feels well, depressing. I have a huge mess of emotions and marital anxieties but I won’t get into that here."

I think our illnesses are different. I have been diagnosed with depression and not a sleep disorder. The physical exhaustion I’m pretty sure is just a symptom of a low serotonin production. I’m pretty sure that I have BPD after doing some research on it but have yet to speak to a professional. The treatments for it are near identical to depression though so it doesn’t matter too much if I just keep doing my routine of depression relief."
