>there isn't a single person who doesn't apply deception and masks

I agree with that, as well, although I wouldn't word it like that. The ability to filter (""mask"") your thoughts, words, and actions according to context and audience is an essential social skill for neurotypical people. The trick is to find a balance between three things: functioning in society, being true to ourselves, and following the golden rule. I don't personally agree that *using tact* is the same thing as *deception* on the basis of connotation, but I acknowledge the connection between them and it's okay if you prefer to assert that they're essentially two sides of the same coin.

If you force yourself to function in society at the expense of *yourself* — at the expense of living in a way that makes you feel *wrong* or *loathsome* of your own identity — that's not good. If you're true to yourself but in doing so you break the golden rule — you're unnecessarily disrespectful or hurtful to others — that's not good.

OkCupid,fcvxs24,t1_fcvmz6v,1578012523.0,">Why not tell her that her aging has become noticeable and that at the same time you're working with new hires who are younger, more attractive and sweet towards you? 

I don't know what the end goal of saying this to a loved one is. Are you interested in leaving her for one of your subordinates? If yes, definitely tell her. It will probably be extraordinarily hurtful, but—again—it will be in the end anyway, so you might as well rip off the bandage.

If not, then first think about the matter of aging. How does she feel about her body showing signs of aging? Is she at peace with it, or is she insecure about it? It's usually better to be compassionate about your loved ones' insecurities. Do you love her any less for her body aging? Does *she* know whether or not you love her the same in spite of it? If she's at peace with her body and trusts that you love her, there shouldn't be anything wrong with acknowledging the progression of age.

How does she feel about you working with more youthful women? Is she comfortable with it, or does she feel insecure about it? Again, it's good to be compassionate about insecurities. If she's insecure, do you know *why* she's insecure? Have you ever given her reason to feel insecure about the youthful women around you, and if not, is there something else going on at the root of that anxiety?

Again, is she interested in your fantasies about other women? If yes, telling your partner about the things you find enticing may be a positive experience. It may even be an avenue to role-playing, if you realize you have a boss-employee fetish.

**^(Side note:)** ^(don't try to fuck a new subordinate. In general, don't try to fuck anybody over whom you have direct power.

>Why not tell her everything you think of every member of her family that you're forced to meet at every family gathering? 

How important is your partner's family to her? If she's apathetic about family, or if she even dislikes most of her family, you may be totally in the clear. Heck, if she doesn't like them, she might enjoy your unfiltered commentary.

Is it essential to her that you mesh well with her family, or is she okay with it if you only engage with some/all of them out of obligation? Are there certain people she needs you to get along well with—like a sister she sees every weekend, or a mother who she wants to help raise your kids some day—while others are less important to her life? How does *she* feel about her family? 

Are the things you're saying constructive, or at least witty, or are they just hateful? It's one thing to have pet peeves about people, or to find in-laws frustrating; it's another thing to just be a dick spewing vitriol about people your partner loves. The former is human; the latter is inconsiderate and hurtful.

If you're involved with someone to whom family is extraordinarily important, choose your path thoughtfully. If you get along great, then things are smooth sailing! If you absolutely dislike all (or most) of her family, you either need to be up front about that sooner rather than later so the two of you can contend with it, or you need to make peace with the idea of being civil with them on a regular basis for all of the foreseeable future with your partner. The best solution may be somewhere in between those two options; make important frustrations known to your partner so she can be sensitive to them in the future, but recognize that having her family around is important to your partner and look for ways to get along with them.

OkCupid,fcvxrbp,t1_fcvmz6v,1578012509.0,"I'm not confident that you've asked those questions in good faith, but I actually think it's a really good idea to know the answers to those questions when you're talking about a lifelong (or, at least, long-term) intimate partner like a spouse, so I'm going to try to answer them in good faith.

The vast majority of them hinge on the individual woman you've married, your unique relationship, and the values that are important to you and her. There are no sweeping, universal answers here.

&#x200B;

> Why not tell your wife that today your coworker bent over and all you could think was to take her? 

How do you and your wife feel about fantasies? Do you agree that it's okay to be turned on by other people as long as you can trust each other not to stray outside of the terms of your relationship? Have you ever talked to your wife about whether she'd like to hear about your fantasies — or you, hers — or which fantasies she'd like to hear about (perhaps only the ones that aren't about people you actually know)? Some people find that they're actually very turned on to hear about their lovers' fantasies. Some people are even open to letting outside parties into their sex lives. But all of that hinges upon having trust and communication about the boundaries in the first place.

There are also a lot of people who appreciate that humans have involuntary urges and desires, but are uncomfortable with confronting their lovers' attraction to other people and are simply happier if they don't have to hear about it. Would telling your wife about this accomplish anything valuable, or would it just be hurtful and uncomfortable for no reason? If so, there may be no good reason to share — at least, not in any kind of detail.

There are also people who believe any attraction of any kind to any outside party is a betrayal of trust. Are you sure you feel good about being married to someone who holds you at trial for thoughts and feelings — not actions, *thoughts* — that are a natural part of human instinct for most people? You are as deserving of emotional support and respect from your spouse as she is.

There's also the matter of wording here; without context, the way you worded this fantasy seems pretty objectifying. How does your wife feel about objectification? How does she feel about the dynamics of consent in your sex life? If she has a problem with you telling her this fantasy, is she off-put by the fact that you *have* a fantasy, or is she off-put because you're talking about sex like it's conquest? Would she receive the information better if you said the scene left you feeling really aroused, or that you fantasized about sex in that position, rather than saying you wanted to *take her* when she bent over? Maybe your wife would be pissed either way, maybe she wouldn't care either way, maybe she would be into it one way but disgusted the other. 

The point is, if you married a woman, it's probably a good to know these things about her. At the very least it would be good for your sex life.

&#x200B;

>Why not tell her all of your political and philosophical thoughts that you know she probably disagrees with? 

Are those thoughts important to you, or fleeting? Are they important to her, or does she not really care about politics very much? If they're important to one or both of you, it may be important to share. Sometimes political beliefs can reflect people's most core, deeply-held values, and it's a good idea to be on the same page about whether those values line up with your life partner's. If they don't, you either have to be okay with that, or you should find out sooner rather than later.

Does your wife *know* you tend to disagree about those topics? Is she okay with you not agreeing? Is she ambivalent about whether you share those opinions? If so, share whatever you feel like sharing, and don't share what you don't. 

Is she fine with disagreeing, but prefers not to have to hear about it? Are *you* okay with that arrangement? If so, there's probably nothing to be gained by sharing and it will only be corrosive to your relationship. 

When the two of you talk about politics or philosophy, are you collectively capable of having respectful discussion with open minds? Are both of you willing and able to listen to the thoughts of the other and assume good faith? When you talk about these things, is it a constructive exchange of ideas or does it just devolve into one or both of you trying to talk over the other? Discussions about things like ethics and politics can be pretty caustic when conduct isn't positive. If one or both of you handles these subjects poorly, you may be better off avoiding them except where they're essential.

&#x200B;

> Why not tell her of all the times you couldn't stand her or she annoyed you? 

Are you just being nasty and nit-picking her, or are you giving her compassionate feedback about your needs? It's reasonable and, arguably, important for someone—you—in a long-term relationship to be able to acknowledge behaviors you find upsetting. Your needs in the relationship, and the way you like to be treated, deserve to be valued just like hers do. 

Things like that, however, tend to be about balance. Are you expressing your needs and frustrations when they really matter to you, or are you being critical of her every little human flaw? Are you expecting her to be perfect, or are you open and willing to love her as a complicated and fallible person? When you express these frustrations, is it with patience and love or is it with malice and judgement? When you accidentally cross the line into nasty behavior—as most of us do now and then—are you willing to apologize for going too far, or do you righteously double down about how *right* you are?

How does your partner take this kind of feedback? Does she listen when you tell her your needs, or does she shut down at the slightest criticism even once she's given time and space to think about it? (Some people have a hard time taking criticism right away, but will come around in their own time.) Do you feel like your partner cares about your needs? Are you okay with the way your spouse takes feedback?"

My observation has been that millennial and gen Z frustration with America's wealth imbalances is only getting more intense. Golf course management is an institution that makes huge chunks of (sometimes high-demand) land private, locks access behind a paywall, often demands a dress code, and requires you to rent or own very specialized equipment just to play—golf courses are basically giant monuments to elitism. I imagine it would take a lot of changes to the core logistics of the institution to overcome that perception.

OkCupid,fcv94r1,t1_fcv7jyq,1577997222.0,"When two people are involved in intimacy of any kind, you should *both* do your best to maintain a healthy, open, and honest dialogue. 

But you're only in control of *your* choices. Her failure to communicate well doesn't excuse you from deliberately failing to communicate.

Continuing to have sex with someone who you think would *stop* having sex with you if she understood the truth *is bad.* If you think it's okay to be intimately involved with someone under willfully false pretenses, please don't get intimate with anyone at all.

Honestly man, ceasing to have sex with someone who doesn't want to bang you anymore is ""a bummer,"" not ""suffering."" Just do it yourself until you find a new, consenting partner."
OkCupid,fcv643d,t1_fcv4f80,1577995423.0,"There's an incentive to cut it off?  I'm not sure I follow.

Are you asking ""When I think my partner is getting attached but I am not, why would I initiate a conversation that might mean I stop getting sex \[because we stop seeing each other\]?"" If so, the answer is: ""because it's a kind and respectful way to treat that person, which is more important than getting laid.""

If you're trying to ask something different, can you clarify?"
OkCupid,fcv488e,t1_fcv1hkp,1577994315.0,"This can go both ways, I think.

Physical intimacy isn't mutually inclusive with emotional intimacy or commitment, and the latter should never be considered a foregone conclusion just because of the former. With that said, it's pretty darn normal for them to go hand in hand; physical and emotional intimacy are, to some degree, linked for a *lot* of people. 

People who assume emotional commitments have been made just because there were physical encounters are bad communicators. Likewise, people who are willfully oblivious about the link between the two are also probably bad communicators. If you think your partner may be in a different emotional place than you are, fuckin' talk about it."

Essentially, the fact that Bill Cosby is a monster of a person and should be remembered as such doesn't change the way that his show demonstrated healthy black fatherhood, nevermind the ability of a black man to be a wholesome celebrity figure, to an entire generation. Maybe it's okay to acknowledge the good thing a person did without forgiving him for his horrible sins."

Your eyelids stick open and your eyes develop a scale-like exterior surface which keeps them moisturized and protected. You are unable to blink for the duration of this effect and lose 5ft of eyesight. When the effect is over, you shed your eye scale and regain use of your eyelids.

Your lateral incisors develop into vicious, needle-sharp fangs and your pupils morph into vertical, snake-like slits.
