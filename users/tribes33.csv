it's difficult to talk someone out of wanting to do it, if you're wondering about dying I'd say try to make an effort not to think that it's a solution because it really isn't, it's more like an out for these extreme feelings you have right now, and you'd be surprised how resilient people can be, I od'd on three different drugs and I still survived, I know it's stupid to say but try to talk to talk to someone about how you really feel and dont filter yourself to just get it all out, cause it really does help, a lot of people here offer themselves to talk to others and I'm no different so if you need to get something off your mind you can hit me up"
depression,fdffi6l,t3_el3qrz,1578360487.0,"I suppose it depends on how you go about it, because when I attempted it by overdose, it seemed like I was kind of slipping away, almost like falling asleep but it feels more like there's assurance that this will be the last time you close your eyes and it's for good, I don't think I felt anything physically, my heart was going really fast and all of a sudden it just crashed on me.

When I finally closed my eyes I started getting an out of body experience, it wasn't a dream or anything, I was just slowly hovering above myself but it had that like dreamy faintness to it that you see it in great detail but at the same time it's hard to remember, I just recall seeing myself with my eyes shut and I was slowly going up higher and higher until I reached the ceiling and then it felt like I either had the choice to stay or keep going, it didn't even feel like I had time to think, it seemed like a nanosecond and then it was this weird feeling where I pulled myself in and I woke up just feeling really shitty."
depression,fdfescf,t3_ekwbox,1578360000.0,"Its like theres this dark twisted feeling in my subconscious that I just want things to get worse so I end myself, as much as that sucks to say.

Either that or I'm fearing change because I'd rather be in the miserable but in comfort that it's going to stay that way rather than, well you never know what can happen, often enough when I try to get better it backfires for me like I'm just the devils plaything and hes just fucking with me for entertainment"
Gamingcirclejerk,fdf9sam,t1_fddyjfk,1578356637.0,"I used to follow the MGTOW movement very early on, like maybe it had like 10k members on here and back then it was actually a really nice community, people that just felt that they didn't have a need for dating or relationships and just focus on their own careers, which is not a bad thing, its just a lifestyle choice, but then over time as it became bigger and bigger the incels just took over, it felt like labeling yourself as MGTOW masks the fact youre basically a fucking incel but youre not able to admit it, because honestly if you look at a good bit of the posts without looking what group it's on, that's what it looks like."

these are the ones you should be changing, I dont exactly remember why but I have H set to 1684 and W set to 1263, I think it gave me almost 1:1 ratio on pixel to game resolution when I checked back when I used my Oculus Rift, I think the game res was set way too low or way too high when it came out so it wasn't even rendering in full resolution for people
