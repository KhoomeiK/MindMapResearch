One thing I noticed was, that he only (until now) shows statistics of occurrences or frequencies of events. Which is flawed in itself (how often do you measure?)

For the record high temperatures, it would mean that, assuming a normal environment without global warming (and measurements in the same frequency), that the amount of measured record high temperatures would have to go down (if it's the same or goes up, it's warming up).   
But you can't really see anything in that graphic, because it doesn't say anything about temperature.  
A little peak could mean +3K or +0.1K.
Doesn't make sense to use it to prove a point.

It seems that they measured every hour in 1934 and 1936 and basically measured more than ever, almost every hour. For a whole year.
