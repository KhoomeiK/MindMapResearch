AmItheAsshole,fc6rb9l,t1_fc6q69n,1577487490.0,">""Excuse me sir, where can I find the contract that says that?""

OP asking that doesn't make him an asshole. The teacher could have said ""I don't have access to them, you can speak with your school if you want to verify."" To my knowledge your parents cannot sign contracts for you in the states and for things they did sign as your legal guardian (school enrollment, for instance) you are not obligated to fulfill once you reach 18. You can just leave school - there are no legal ramifications. So OP, at 18, was not beholden to anything they did not personally sign. And they aren't beholden to anything they signed before the age of 18 that their parents did not consent to UNLESS he was falsely presenting himself as 18 or older and entered into a contract, at which point a judge would rule on whether said contract was binding. Considering OP supposedly signed this contract at a school where their birthdate is on record, the latter is not a possibility. But again, OP is not an asshole for inquiring where they might find a supposed contract that the teacher cited."
AmItheAsshole,fc6o0fo,t3_eggsyb,1577485149.0,"NAH. There is nothing wrong with not inviting them because you want a small ceremony and then inviting them to the reception - or not if you don't feel close to them. It is your wedding. Invite those who will make the day special to you.

But on a small hand, your mom is right. Don't take not being allowed to their ceremonies personally. Their faith is important to them and that is what their faith dictates. They included you in aspects of their wedding that they were able. I've missed ceremonies that were incredibly important to me for this same reason - my best friend was married in the temple and I couldn't go because I'm an atheist. Life is too short to hold resentment like that and it will just wear you down."
AmItheAsshole,fc6n1sz,t1_fc6jj9f,1577484470.0,"Naaaaaah, they are 18. They no longer require parent guardianship. Also, OP said they never saw a contract and any contract signed by a minor for non-essentials (Food, medicine, medical services) are not valid without parent approval. So they could probably ask their parents if they approved him signing the contract and if not, it's void. Further, if the school won't produce the contract for the students then they may have a case to not follow it until it is provided. It's typical of both parties to have copies of contracts for this very reason. So, either the contract doesn't exist or it does but under shady circumstances plus the the 'teacher' is an asshole. OP asked to see a document THEY supposedly signed and the teacher said that he essentially has no right to ask to see it? No. OP is NTA."

AskReddit,fc60h4b,t1_fc5z81y,1577469557.0,"And it's because they have to push it because most people aren't interested. That was, I guess, the one advantage my family had with Avon. It was such a big name in the 90s where I grew up that they didn't have to push it, people came to them. But that's not the case anymore. And it really is more beneficial if you actually take a little time and create. I know this guy who works full time and hand crafts functional long bows and sells them for boatloads of cash and then I know a girl who makes healthy dog treats and sells them at local community markets. My favorite is this guy who figured out how to make biodegradeable shiny water - he collects old glass bottles, fills them up and corks them and he is huge in the Northwest fair circuit (USA). They are super cool. His name is Dr. Vortex and he sells them for anywhere from $10-$30 bucks depending on the size and intracacy of the bottle.

Anyway, these people who buy into thesemulti-level marketing things wouldn't have to push so hard if they had desireable product and their friends new they were getting the total of the profits. And this is me, exitting my soapbox."

As Christians you are meant to follow in the footsteps of Christ and if you have read any part of the new testament you would see that Jesus does not exhibit this kind of behavior. Jesus embodied love and acceptance. Your family is going against everything Jesus taught. This crap is precisely why I became an atheist. An entire childhood of my bible school teacher telling me what I'm telling you and then turning her back on anyone she didn't agree with or couldn't relate too.
