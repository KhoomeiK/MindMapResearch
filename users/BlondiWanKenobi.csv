Narcolepsy,ffd2esa,t3_estw3r,1579812075.0,"Def have incredibly vivid, wild dreams... mostly my “nightmares” are more or less frustration dreams, like trying to eat an apple but my teeth are all wiggly, or running away/toward something and it feels like quicksand. Sometimes I do have “scarier” nightmares, but in these I tend to be aware that I’m dreaming and it gets to a point that I want out of the dream, so I give up and let the monster catch up haha. (Even in my dreams, I get tired easily apparently)

I often have recurring dreams involving either a house (same but different everytime, and sometimes I discover new rooms), or involving water (being on a boat, swimming, rafting, etc). These are closer to frustration dreams, as I feel like I am looking for something specific but can’t quite grasp it. 

I also sometimes have “nightmares” that leave me feeling the emotional ripples all day... a death or breakup or some other tragic event in my dream will literally cause me to wake up crying, and then I just feel almost like this sense of doom all day.

I love dreaming though, and I’m very often aware of when I’m in a dream... so even in my not-so-happy dreams I still want to experience it and try to “solve” it... like a movie I want to see through to the end."

But no one can tell you how you’re “supposed to” grieve, so just do whatever feels “right” and natural for you in your process.

I have found that remembering all the good moments helps me, as well as the reassurance that our loved ones are no longer suffering. Talk about the good times, even if they bring tears, and don’t be afraid to shed those tears - they are healing. 

Take comfort that you gave this sweet girl an amazing life, and that your lives were made better by her presence. She will always be in your hearts. Talk to her if you want (I still talk to my babies who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge) - I choose to believe they can hear us. 

Take care, OP, and when you’re ready, the universe will bring you another friend in need of your loving care. But above all, be honest with your feelings and know that you are not alone.

Foodforthought,fdcy4yf,t1_fdclqio,1578287776.0,"Especially considering that these tests are designed to be blanket assessments of skills with no consideration of the individual backgrounds and needs of students... my job is, in part, dependent on how well my students perform on state assessments, which in ELA generally revolve around being able to do the following:
- identify a main idea in a reading passage and support with details
- identify authors use of a specific literary device/element/technique to develop a central idea
- define complex vocabulary through context 
- identify and analyze myriad literary elements in a variety of fiction, non-fiction, and poetic texts

Ok, easy peasy right? High school students should be able to do all these things. It involves critical thinking, which I am all about. 

But, can someone explain to me, how ONE state mandated test, in the course of all four years of high school, determines students’ ability in these areas? Especially when the state provides texts that are not only complex, but beyond the frustration level of comprehension for many students? And are often 3-4 hours long?

I absolutely agree that we should be challenging our older students and holding them to high expectations, but we need to remember that not all kids learn the same way, and not all kids express their learning in the same ways. As a high school teacher, I see a lot of test anxiety, general dislike of learning/reading/writing, lack of academic confidence, distrust of school system, avoidance techniques, etc, etc...

And I also see so much untapped potential in these kids. I see them challenge themselves and each other over the course of my classes. However, I don’t see the majority of their skills recognized by that single, solitary exam that is mandated to determine “mastery”. I understand the value of data, I just think we are collecting the majority of our data through arbitrary testing that doesn’t authentically measure students’ abilities. And it leads to issues all the way up the educational food chain as more and more emphasis is placed on these solitary test scores."

These strategies have continued to help, but as we got older and added on more responsibilities (he opened up his own shop a few years ago), I noticed that his symptoms were escalating hard. I finally convinced him to go back to his specialist and he is now on medication (which helps, but it’s not an end-all-be-all solution). 

On my end, I’m used to keeping up with our erratic conversations that jump across a million diff topics lol, and I’m used to the fact that tasks take way longer than they “should” to complete.

I have suffered symptoms most of my life, but come from one of those hard-grit families where unless you’re dying or bleeding profusely you don’t need a doctor (only half joking lol). Because of my sleep attacks over the years, people have had different perceptions of me, ranging from nearing a mental breakdown (struggling to stay awake in class while juggling full time school and work) to problems with alcohol (falling asleep mid conversation after 2 beers)... and it’s frustrating to say the least. 

I mentioned things here and there with my GP but wasn’t taken seriously. Maybe 2-3 years ago, my husband and I started noticing  these “more than tired” commercials on tv, and he finally convinced me to *really* talk to my doctor. So I laid it on her at my next appointment - my whole life history/struggle with the ongoing Sleep vs. Wake battle... it was really the part where I started talking about the auditory hallucinations I sometimes experience that she looked at me like I was batshit and started writing furiously in her notepad. 

Me: “Are you ever aware of that moment when you’re about to fall asleep? I love that feeling. But sometimes, it’s like a misfire in my brain, and while my body is falling asleep my brain doesn’t coordinate, and I hear these loud Bang!s and/or static white noise - super annoying...”

GP: “huh...” *increases writing intensity* “so... does your husband ever hear these things?”

Me: “No... I know it’s in my brain, and not something external. It’s not a “real” noise, hence why it’s an auditory hallucination. I feel like there are times when my brain and body don’t fall asleep together”

GP: *psychoanalytic eyebrow raise* “So.. no one else here’s this?” *forehead furrowing and furious writing intensifies*

Finally she refers me to “one of the best” sleep specialists in my area for suspected “insomnia” (even though the whole appt I was talking about sleeping *too* much during the day/night) where it took over a year and a multitude of headaches to find out what I really already knew (Narcolepsy... no cataplexy but some cataplectic tendencies, so technically type 2 I guess?)

I answered and she was in immediate hysterics. She had accidentally overdosed on Humulog (quick acting insulin) when she meant to take her Lantus (long acting insulin).  So we’re talking about 40 units of the quick stuff, enough to kill her. I immediately ran out the door and stayed on the phone with her to try to keep her calm and keep her awake until I could get her to the nearest hospital. It ended in an overnight ER visit with multiple glucose crashes, but they were able to just keep pumping her with sugars to keep her from crashing too low until all the insulin had a chance to go through her system. 

She told me the next day that at first she didn’t think anything about it, just was doing her normal bedtime routine that she’d been doing most of her life. She had actually gone to bed and then had that feeling that something wasn’t right. Looked on her nightstand and saw the wrong insulin pen, and then panic set it. If she hadn’t gotten up bc of that feeling, and if I hadn’t answered the phone bc of that same feeling, this story would have had a much more different outcome."

The sound bar I use is great *if it works - I share a room with another teacher, and it’s paired to both of our laptops, but the damn sound bar always wants to pair to his *even if his computer isn’t in the room*!

We have these “fancy” laptop/tablet combo things, but they make guided annotations a nightmare (have to convert all files to a format that allows me to “write” on them, doesn’t automatically save annotations, and my stupid palm wipes them all away willy nilly)

Narcolepsy,fc7m7nt,t1_fc7l229,1577512025.0,"I feel like I get good, deep sleep... my sleep studies show a pattern of early onset sleep, early onset REM, and extended periods of deep sleep/lengthened sleep cycles. The best way I can explain it is that my brain loooooves sleep and wants to stay there. I have incredibly vivid, often lucid dreams, and even “nightmares” (frustration dreams like moving through quicksand lol) I want to stay in... it’s an overwhelming urge/need to try to “solve” the dream and see it through til the end, even if there is no clear ending (not sure if that makes any sense, but I don’t know how else to describe it lol I often lose details upon fully waking, even if residual scenes/images/feelings remain). 

I fully enjoy sleep, and - thankfully - don’t suffer from periodic insomnia like I know many others with N can experience. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, exactly, and I struggle sometimes with how to precisely articulate all of my symptoms during appts (often feel rushed).  I am prescribed modafinil (not working as well as I hoped?), but she makes it seem like my script is dependent on my adhering to “the treatment plan”, which includes naps. I don’t want to lie to my doctor, of course, but I also don’t want to come across as “drug seeking”? :/

Thank you, really, for your kind words... while I reasonably “know” I’m not the only one struggling, it’s really reassuring to know others understand what I’m going through - thank you :)"

I’m newer to seeking treatment for N (officially diagnosed about a year ago), so I’m not really sure what to expect/anticipate from my dr and treatment plan, I just know I haven’t been able to make this current plan work for me so far. Thank you for this reassurance! I’m collecting a list of concerns/questions to being up at my next appt in addition to my sleep journal/notes"
Narcolepsy,fc7jhbk,t1_fc7j1qs,1577509384.0,"Honestly, thank you for this reassurance. I work in alternative education at the high school level and have weird hours (11-6:30), so it is really difficult for me to schedule naps during my work day. I find that if I try to take a short nap during my break, I’m just in a brain fog the rest of the day, which really isn’t fair to my students. If I fall asleep after work, I’m generally done for the night, regardless of all the “extra work” teaching entails outside of the classroom."
Narcolepsy,fc7iojj,t1_fc5wqbi,1577508642.0,"I usually get a good, solid 7-8 hours sleep a night, don’t usually wake up during the night, and feel great upon waking in the morning. I try to keep to a regular bedtime/wake-time and generally fall asleep right away. While I generally feel great in the mornings when I wake up (usually around 8), within 2 hours I’m starting to feel tired again, which is where the first cup of coffee comes in as I need to get to work. I usually make another cup after my first class and then another after my last 4 for my drive home. (I make it iced coffee - no sugar/cream/anything - to “prolong the magic”). So I guess my excessive all-day coffee drinking really “only” equates to 3-4 cups a day (I know, still not good, but could be worse?). 

My doctor agrees that my sleep hygiene is “pretty good” considering, but there’s no denying that I’m still really struggling with levels of wakefulness throughout the day. Hence the “prescribed” naps... but those don’t seem to work either at the moment"

I have another check-in with my sleep dr next month, so I will reiterate that naps still aren’t working for me, and the modafinil isn’t really helping in the I-need-to-stay-awake-more-than-8-hours-a-day realm of reality. If she still brushes me off, I may try to find a diff dr (although there aren’t a whole lot of “sleep specialists” in my area)"

Narcolepsy,fc7gtg5,t1_fc5kecg,1577507003.0,"I do wonder if the excessive caffeine ends up having an “opposite effect” - although I know I have too much caffeine most days, I still feel super tired lol. 

I work 6.5 days a week 10 months out of the year, and I honestly love what I do. I teach English in an alternative high school full time, work my restaurant job Sunday mornings, and try to reserve Saturdays as grading/planning-in-my-pjs day. I am fine while I’m up and working (which I’ve been thinking I - in part - chose these professions because it allows me to be up and moving n grooving... I don’t think I could do an office job in front of a computer most of the day tbh). 

So I usually feel great while working, but once my work day is over and I’m driving home, I feel almost like a “click” in my brain and I’m immediately exhausted. Get home and I am beyond exhausted... like brain doesn’t want to function. I’ve been prescribed modafinil (100 mg twice a day), but it honestly doesn’t help the after work crash... at all... even if I take one near the end/after work. This is usually the time I set aside for intermittent grading/planning during the week (do as not to bog myself down too much on Saturdays), but it’s tough...

I try to follow the recommendations of my dr and take a short nap after work when I feel that “click” happen. Sometimes it works well, but more often than not I feel “off” and/or more tired upon waking (if I do in fact wake up and not just sleep through 12-15 hours through the night)."

news,fc5ikct,t1_fc5i4rv,1577458576.0,"Yes states and counties can adopt their own laws, that isn’t in question. And once the US federal government mandates new laws, individual states and counties will need to follow said mandates in order to avoid consequences (mostly financial). 

My point here is that Native Reservations are not regulated by the federal government - they are essentially sovereign lands within the US. So currently, even though many counties in NY adopted these new regulations ahead of federal passage of this law, it does not apply to Native designated lands, and will not unless and until they, as a Nation, decide to adopt such policy.

Edit: PS “federal lands” refers to any land the US government has control over, i.e., individual states and counties, NOT Native Reservation land... as you stated, that land is sovereign"

I often joke that I have a “goldfish memory” (although not really joking lol), so I’ve learned to write things down that I need to remember - I always keep a pen and small notebook handy, and I think I could possibly be responsible for keeping Post-It in business haha. But really, writing important things down helps A LOT. 

I also try to remember to take time to be fully present in life moments (doesn’t always work, but does help to solidify certain memories)... I’ll focus on breathing, the feel of sunshine, smells around me, etc and try to take a moment to just take it all in and snap a mental picture."

This may very well change as various county officials engage in talks with the Reservations, but perhaps they should have thought of this first? As of now they have not yet adopted the 21+ law for tobacco.
