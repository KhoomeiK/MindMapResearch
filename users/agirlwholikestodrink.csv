AskReddit,fek97aw,t3_epfjje,1579195228.0,Almost died from blood clots in both lungs and in my right calf in March 2018. Spent 2 days thinking I hurt my calf and after taking ibuprofen and a nap I woke up pouring sweat with chest pain and the no ability to stand. First time in my life I’ve had tunnel vision and waves in my ears. Literally couldn’t even stand long enough to walk to the car without damn near blacking out. The next most painful part was all the needles every 4 hours (in the same 3 spots!) and the nurse trying FIVE TIMES to find an artery in my wrist? I cried every time and apologized every time lol; happy to be coming up on 2 years of kicking clots ass :)

I had to fart, except obviously it wasn’t a fart. I shit myself in the Walmart parking lot. I don’t even remember if I was alone in the car (waiting for mom) or had a friend. I do remember I had some puppy pee pads in the car and I poorly attempted to clean myself up with them. Let me tell you, that was a RIDE home. I remember the damn walk into the apartment. I can’t remember how old I was but I pray I was closer to 13 than 16. I’ve since learned to not trust a fart, ever :)"
