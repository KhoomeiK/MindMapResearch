Frugal,ffantgg,t1_ffa6bxg,1579740313.0,Original old 10/30 oil in an older car yes it is true.  Get a newer car and uses a lighter synthetic oil it lasts longer.  My tacoma takes 0/20 and lasts 5k miles.  I used ams oil once and it says 10k.  Had 12k miles on it and was in the truck for a year and was barely turning color.  Wanted to get it tested to see if it was holding up but I never did.
