2. I want to ask how much of the Bible you’ve read, and how much of it you’ve really thought about. 

Surely you’ve read about the flood, and how god committed mass genocide? Did you read about the time he sent bears to eat some children because they made fun of a prophet for being bald? What about the time he said he was fine with people beating slaves? Have you ever thought about how immoral it is to give infinite punishment for a finite crime?


I can give you the verses if you want, or more examples, if that’s not enough.

.

3. Now this is a major point which is often confused. Atheists do not say that there is no god. We just don’t see sufficient reason to believe in one. The burden of proof is on you.

.

4. “Theramin Trees” is a great youtuber with a very soothing voice who talks about psychology, focusing on abusive relationship dynamics. He is not an “Atheist Youtuber” but he has talked about the various narcissistic and abusive qualities of gods and religions. 

Watch (or listen) to some of his stuff about Islam if you don’t want to dive headfirst into anti-christian stuff.

Alternatively, “Cosmic Skeptic” is a Atheist Youtuber who doesn’t bash Christians, but makes many reasoned and logical critiques of religious creators.

Also, “The Atheist Experience” or “Talk Heathen” are great TV shows that air on Youtube on Sundays and are watchable afterwards. They take calls, so you can call in with any questions you might have that you feel the internet won’t answer. If you do, “Talk Heathen has generally nicer hosts."
