Needafriend,fcl7lh2,t3_ehp6t3,1577741539.0,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 14F that will be 15 in May. I know there is at 10 year gap but we are both girls so I don‚Äôt think it should matter too much. Of course if you want someone more mature then you would probably prefer someone older. I also have depression, I was diagnosed by a family doctor and therapist. So we can relate to each other on that. It would be cool for you to give me advice and all that since you are older than me. Some girls my age are terrible and it is nice to have an older girl friend. I also love Tim Burton movies, I love his animation and drawing style. I can set up a discord and send you the link to talk."

Btw you are a total warrior for having to go through all of that. Just remember that you will always be valid and beautiful no matter what. Try to find ways to enjoy your life the most, whatever that should be. You deserve happiness and you deserve to nourish yourself with whatever you want at all times. Eating disorders never really go away, but just remember that there will always be people struggling with similar things and you are not alone."

But seriously, I have never heard of it before. Wouldn‚Äôt botox tighten it up? I don‚Äôt know too much about Botox but I think that it would do that. Also I get that ‚Äòunbalanced‚Äô feeling and a side that feels just straight up wrong quite often as well."
