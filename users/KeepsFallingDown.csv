I was also on gabapentin briefly pre-N diagnoses when I was younger and dont recall much benefit, but Xyrem has drastically improved my reaction to many other meds in the past.

MensLib,fdb3dki,t3_ejf06q,1578253249.0,"When we got married, my (33 cis f) husband (32 cis m) expressed interest in taking my name and I immediately worried it could cause him trouble professionally. It took a day or two, then I realized I was perpetuating the exact situation I feared! 

We're very left leaning, open minded people and I spent years working in the automotive & salvage industry before switching to IT, all traditionally male dominated. I also have a disability, narcolepsy, and need to take naps on my breaks at work to control my symptoms. I've dealt with a ton of closed minded people telling me I didn't belong & treating me like I'm weak for needing minor  accommodations. I was so dismayed that my knee-jerk reaction was to act like his choice was a weakness and blame it on 'other people judging'. I don't want to live in that world and I told him such and apologized. I know I internalize fear that femininity is weak, but I also need to call myself out when I notice it and support my partner for being the change I want to see! 

I think that if you mention how you feel about these jokes/comments to friends and partners, they owe you the respect to reassess their comments. Having support of those close to you is vital to weathering the bullshit the world will throw at you.

Also, my husband is 6ft and likes a clean shaven traditional masculine look, but he also has a tighter fitting bright pink planned parenthood tshirt, a rainbow of cute socks and a hat with cat ears and whiskers that my mom got him for xmas. I think he looks amazing and interesting when he sports his more feminine looks because it does more justice to the complex, fascinating person I love."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fcsp1qc,t1_fcsfz9b,1577921508.0,"The first link I posted opens to a still of migrants sleeping on concrete. It is literally the first thing you see on the page.

Also, the bulk of the wait time is vetting the sponsors taking custody of minors who already live in the US. According to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/migrant-children-detention.html), the issue is additional red tape for sponsors put in place by the current administration. Considering they already rolled back some of these changes because they bottlenecked the process too much, I think they should return to the established sponsor screening pre-2016."
