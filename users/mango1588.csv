AmItheAsshole,ff9qbud,t3_esfrpv,1579718615.0,"NTA. You are protecting yourself from continual accusations of abuse. Beyond that, it is not your job to subsidize your parents' finances. You need to protect yourself first since your parents won't."
AmItheAsshole,ff9q5gn,t1_ff9o38g,1579718489.0,"That's stupid to blame OP for any of this.

OP: Talks to parents.
Parents: Refuse to make any changes because its hard to parent.
OP: Moves out to protect himself from continual accusations of abuse.
You: How dare you, they need your money!

These parents are doing a shitty job by OP and the fact that they rely that heavily on the income from their kid who has barely crossed the line into adulthood says that they need to work on their finances rather than holding their kid back. It's not OP's job to subsidize their finances. You'd think if it mattered so much, they would be more respectful of his needs as well."
AmItheAsshole,ff9kp4u,t3_es0ltx,1579715040.0,"NTA. Just wanted to say- her choice to go ahead and buy DOES NOT obligate you to buy her car from her! She can sell it to someone else.

She sounds really manipulative and selfish. And the fact that you are worried that she has plenty of ways to make her displeasure known also says a lot about her behavior. If you can at all avoid this, don't let her stick you with this cost."
AmItheAsshole,ff9jx06,t3_esb9vh,1579714580.0,"NTA. Choosing not to invite her is totally your call. I would, however, suggest telling her that she isn't invited. Not because she deserves to know, but rather because I think it may head off some issues for you. If she isn't invited but you don't specifically say so, it's possible that she will hear about it from another family member and turn up anyway. Even if you're willing to kick her out in front of others (which is something manipulative people rely on- you being too polite to cause a scene), it's going to be a stain on a day when you shouldn't have to give her any mental space. Regardless of which way you choose to go with this, you're not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,ff9hl3h,t3_esasdr,1579713178.0,"NTA. If your aunt abandoned her family because she didn't get free stuff from you, that says a lot more about HER than about you. It's reasonable to ask and it's reasonable to say no. You weren't comfortable with it. That's fine. She and your mom become the assholes by pushing and guilting. That's really crappy behavior on their part.

I'm sorry their selfishness pushed you away from something you enjoyed and I hope you're able to get past it, if possible. That's a great skill to have, even if you only use it for personal enjoyment!"
AmItheAsshole,ff7mlnm,t1_ff7kv6x,1579653161.0,"Interesting. I hadn’t heard of that before. Basically a pre-wedding fundraiser? Eh, if it works, cool. It still sounds like your bf isn’t thinking through the costs and consequences of being in this wedding. Unfortunately it sounds like he’s willing to take away from the needs of his family (you and baby) for his own selfish wants. I hope you’ll take into consideration whether this is a one-off or a continuous pattern with him. One can be forgiven and possibly made up for. The other is going to make your life hell."
AmItheAsshole,ff6ynps,t1_ff6y9t0,1579637593.0,"I was wondering that too. At first I thought it was part of the bachelor party (like splitting hotel and alcohol and whatever), but this seems like a separate ""listing."""
relationship_advice,ff3namz,t3_erf6ny,1579544708.0,"Oof, I'm so sorry for what you're dealing with. And what a jackass he was to contact you simply to hurt you with that information. I was cheated on multiple times over the course of my first relationship, so I understand some of what you're going through. I was soooo mad. At him, at her, at myself. Could I have stopped it in some way? Why did they decide to do that? For quite awhile afterwards, I was nearly dizzy at times with my own anger. I can tell you now, that it will fade over time. It will become duller and you will be able to see clearly that you are much better off without him and his bullshit. What I can suggest is throwing yourself whole heartedly into something you enjoy. A hobby, a sport, working out, reading more, simply spending time with friends, whatever. Having something to occupy your mind and time will help. At first, you'll be aware that you're doing it to get your mind off things. Then you'll slowly start to realize that you are going longer and longer without thinking of him. Eventually you're not going to think about him except once in great while because you're no longer *allowing* him to have any mental real estate. Throwing yourself into other things is going to speed up this process and give you the benefit of improving yourself in some way. You are going to meet someone better, though it may be hard to believe that now."

You did the right thing by trying the food, realizing it wouldn't work for you, and choosing to eat something on the down-low afterwards. Staying after to help clean up was also the right thing to do. The fact that the rest of the family didn't even bring you food or check in with you (to make sure you ate since that was allegedly the issue) after they stormed out says worlds about their actual intentions."

The question that you have to answer (and I think you already have, if you're being honest with yourself) is whether you can deal with this being the rest of your life. She not only doesn't want to change or see any reason to change, she's actively getting angry that you dare to do anything else. I don't know if kids are something you guys have considered, but quite frankly I would break ties now before you had to worry about any of the complications that would bring up.

Your mom is inhibiting your ability to work toward independence and that is NOT acceptable. You did not choose to have this baby, you did not choose to take on care of it and your parents are being crazy irresponsible to push off care of it onto a teenager. Quite frankly, I would see about getting CPS involved. Not necessarily to get the child taken away (though if you are really truly the ONLY option for childcare, then maybe it would be in the kids best interest), but rather to ask for resources to help care for this kid, including childcare."
AmItheAsshole,fdqwt3k,t3_emjcdo,1578676007.0,"YTA. This is really something you guys should've hashed out prior to 6 months pregnant. But no, it is not reasonable to force your husband to stay home when he doesn't want to. It takes a lot of work to be a stay at home parent and not everyone is cut out for it, teacher or no. If neither of the parents want to stay home, there are some other options than just daycare. You could see if you have any friends or relatives that would be able to act as nanny (please pay them a reasonable rate!), one or both of you could see about working from home part time, or you could do a mix of these plus daycare. But yes, you would be TA if you force your husband out of his career for several years just because you make more money."

You are the one going through a major medical operation. You know what will stress you out and extra stress at that isn't safe for you or the baby.

You and husband know best how your inlaws will respond, but I'd consider setting some boundaries with them now. Staying with you for TWO WEEKS after giving birth is neither normal, nor (based on your description of them) helpful. I'd see if they can get a hotel or Airbnb. Otherwise you may be in for a rough two weeks. Are they likely to help around the house? Pick up after themselves? Give you privacy to bond with your new baby? Or will they be hogging the baby, making demands, and expecting you to wait on them? The standard you allow them to set now is going to continue."

This is one example where it would be absolutely appropriate to choose a partner over a child who refuses to take responsibility for themselves. Otherwise the parent is just an enabler or a doormat."

I totally understand that someone that you see once or twice a year aren't going to be on the same level as a finance or close friends just because you ""share blood."" I'm sorry that your family is giving you shit over such a small thing. Personally, I would suggest making this your standard choice when visiting. They may not like it, but they'll get used to it. When asked, you can be honest or, if you're uncomfortable with that, just say something along the lines of needing some extra personal space when in big groups for multiple days. Perhaps looking a little earlier next year, you can find a closer hotel (or Airbnb), if it's the distance thing that has them worked up."

It drives her nuts. I’ve thought about that as a good rule of thumb, but never been able to say it as succinctly as that!"
