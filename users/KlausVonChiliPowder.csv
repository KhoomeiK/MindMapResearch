Guns + poverty is a much bigger problem. It's sad this isn't even the motive for change. It's the relatively uncommon, easier to sell stories.

news,feru0d5,t1_fep4rbq,1579358319.0,"Oh jeez guys. Who would've thought it was just that easy. Vote in good politicians.

Okay well first, we'd have to go to every district in most every state and convince the majority of the population to vote against 1 to 2 generations of conditioned ignorance. And even more difficult, in many instances we will have to argue concepts like moral and social responsibility. I'm sure the construction worker who makes just enough to get his family through until the next year's tax return will totally listen to why they should support an increased tax for something they don't believe will ever affect them.

I'd be surprised if we even got that far. Few progressives today seem to be able to even say the president's name without devolving the conversation into an emotional mess. Very few have the capacity to actually engage these people with positive results.

Assuming that could ever happen, we'd now have to battle the millions/billions that will start being funneled into misinformation campaigns and extensive efforts to protect the current insurance and medical industry giants. And in the end, they'd still have a huge hand in whatever we're *given*.

It's been a 15-20 year ride trying to get a decent public transport plan into action in my city. And we still have nothing. I get things are so much better in <insert utopian European country/Canada/Elsewhere>, and we're all lazy monsters in the US. But you guys don't seem to realize how easy it was for you in comparison. You were all mostly born into your progressive beliefs, with many of these systems already in place. Try doing it in a country with 327 million people, everyone with different motivations, cultural and social backgrounds, religious and philosophical ideas. A country almost completely controlled by billion dollar special interests."
news,ferltzv,t1_feoamc0,1579355587.0,"How can that not be true though? More people are covered, so more people will be willing to visit a doctor vs. just waiting it out when they know the bill would fuck them over. Meaning understaffed/overworked offices, longer wait times, potentially less efficient care. Is that not what happens? Speaking on the subject before with Reddit Brits, they seemed to have confirmed at least the wait times and overworked physicians tend to be an issue.

Unless something is built into the law that corrects this, all of this seems a logical connection to make."
