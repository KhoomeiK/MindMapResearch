I'm not okay with giving homeless people money to do vice. I've sat down and had a real conversation with many beggars around my town and they don't want to get out of that life. A lot of them have chosen to live that way. 

I once met one that has children that are doing really well and he doesn't let his children know he's living on the streets. When he goes to meet his children (now over 30+ years old) he finds some clean clothes, takes a shower and shows up like he doesn't live in the streets. Then after that? He goes right back at the street. He does no hard drugs and his only vice is alcohol. He says he could find a job if he wanted to but he doesn't want to because then he'd have to pay taxes and would have responsibilities. After his children grew up he just threw everything away and started living with zero responsibilities. 

Now I realize that this is only ONE guy out of millions but he cannot be the only who have chosen this life. I'm sure there are people out there who have been really dealt a bad hand at life but a lot of these folks have had karma fall down on them.

So yeah, I don't give beggars money because they MIGHT use it to buy drugs and I don't feel I'd be doing them any favors by helping them fund drug cartels."

So my guess is that the owner was trying to save a few bucks by buying it himself from the manufacturer and there was no mention of installation.

Right now I don't game as much because responsibilities keep racking up. So my advice is play to your hearts content because when you become an adult it will go away. 

  
It also wouldn't hurt if you gave your parents some perspective. I assume they have hobbies? How much time do they spend on such hobbies, chances are they spend as much time with some activity.
