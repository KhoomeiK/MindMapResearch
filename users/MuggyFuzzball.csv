The FAA which was in charge of airport security before the TSA didn't have the same procedures, numbers, or the budget to do what TSA does now. They didn't even have penetration testing teams like the Red team that is responsible for that misleading 90% we're talking about.

There are lots of ""oops I forgot my gun in my luggage"" stories before TSA, including my own father in the early 90's who forgot his firearm attached to hip on one flight. That's unheard of now and definitely wouldn't still be possible.

TSA enacted a 100% screening law on all people and baggage. That didn't happen before TSA. Not every passenger or every bag was screened before them.

Airport security back then also didn't have the same body scanners or explosive detection equipment that TSA had now.

It's not like they leave those security holes open to be exploited after they're discovered lol...

This 90% is an accumulation over time with a different technique every time. They can't  just go to an airport and try every process that contributed to that percentage and get 90% now. They'd only pass the latest tests, so it would be more like 3% or less.

TSA's job isn't to catch a terrorist. It's to deter people from trying or making it easy to commit an act.

Once those holes are discovered, they're patched to be included into the standard procedures.  Security procedures aren't bullet proof from the beginning, they're learned from experience. It's better that a special team finds those holes instead of a terrorist..."

That 90% number is from a special team whose job it is to find ways to sneak something past security outside of the TSA's standard screening processes so that those processes can later be implemented to cover those holes. If they aren't getting high numbers, they aren't doing their jobs right."

It is not my intention to undermine the travesty and devastation that has been occurring in Australia but to instead show Redditors what to realistically expect.

No, all of Australia isn't burning like a hellish landscape from Dante's Inferno (although the heat may make it feel as such). However, the affected areas are still vast. The fires that are visible from space span multiple kilometers.

The areas displayed in red are the hottest areas ""down under"", with the bright red specs being the actual fires themselves (Note that many less visible fires are still burning at smaller scales). The blue and green regions are the coolest, mostly obscured by cloud/storm coverage - many large fires may be hidden by this.

As you can see, the map shows Australia's current biggest fires are mostly isolated to certain regions of the continent, which presents a much different picture than some misleading [images making their rounds across the web](https://i.imgur.com/Ge5nSoS.jpg) - [actually an artist's rendering].

Still, this picture only shows the latest available satellite imagery, not what has already been devastated and extinguished throughout the existing season by brave volunteers and rainfall. Many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of animals have been killed or chased from their habitats. The real imagery should be scary enough without some people faking data and images, as these fires have occurred on an unprecedented scale, and will only continue until winter.
