insaneparents,ff9uunk,t1_ff9ujv4,1579721931.0,That makes sense.
insaneparents,ff9u2pq,t1_ff9t6do,1579721317.0,No it's not. When an embryo or fetus is inside of the mother it's called in-utero or some people say pre-natal. Conception is the moment an egg is fertilized by a sperm. Chromosomes are determined by the egg and the sperm.
insaneparents,ff8zgpl,t1_ff8qzms,1579700903.0,"Not only before the child is born, it occurs at conception."
IAmA,ff69yt5,t1_ff5wmhc,1579622578.0,"I can totally understand how hard that would be! I'm a NICU nurse. I have, unfortunately, taken care of one or 2 babies that are carriers - it's rare, but they can still have milder symptoms of CF. It doesn't make sense to me, but it's possible. I hope your baby is doing well!"
IAmA,ff5u871,t1_ff54muv,1579610420.0,"I couldn't agree more. It saddens me to know people abort DS fetuses just because. Their loss, really."
IAmA,ff5twkn,t1_ff5pw62,1579610087.0,Why is it tough? If she's a carrier she shouldn't have many (if any) symptoms of CF.
creepy,ff5qwen,t1_ff5qret,1579606656.0,Why not? They do where I live. It's a learning experience.
creepy,ff5qj1l,t1_ff5hhf8,1579606170.0,Kids go to museums all the time.
InfertilityBabies,ff3qzqw,t1_ff3ms0d,1579546970.0,Dates supposedly help induce labor.
Parenting,ff2yv06,t1_ff2uigq,1579528994.0,"Fuck you. I formula fed my son (because I fuckin felt like it) and I'm damn proud. I'm a NICU nurse and I've seen what mom's go through to breast feed. It's all hype. My son is perfectly healthy, vaccinated, and happy. He's only been sick twice in his 15 months. I'm not lazy - breastfeeding sucked so I spent less time pumping and more time bonding with my son."
Parenting,ff2ymqd,t1_ff2m0ew,1579528786.0,"I've always used tap for my son. Depending on where you live, it's perfectly safe unless your baby is premature or has other immune system problems."
namenerds,feycey8,t1_fex0j3l,1579443706.0,"Oh, God, please don't!"
beyondthebump,fexxoq0,t1_fewkmu3,1579438036.0,It's labeled baby because aquaphor specifically makes the 3 in 1 cream for babies. There isn't an adult version of that one.
beyondthebump,fevex1b,t3_eqoway,1579396580.0,"I think we did yogurt around 7 months. My son absolutely loves it! He can't tolerate cows milk, but he can eat cows milk yogurt."
InfertilityBabies,fetvlac,t1_fenguns,1579380517.0,This is my second IVF pregnancy - in always short of breath starting around 8 weeks. It didn't get much better for me ðŸ˜’ I hope yours does!
infertility,fetsyqs,t1_fetogze,1579379701.0,"There are a lot of sad stories and the treatments don't work for everyone. They do work for the majority of people, though. Don't let that deter you. People come here for support and are not allowed to discuss success because it can be very triggering to people struggling with infertility. So it seems very skewed towards negative outcomes. For success stories, you could check out r/infertilitybabies."
infertility,fes3xv1,t1_fepslx5,1579361137.0,That's a lot to deal with. Good luck moving forward! Infertility is a bitch. I did IUI 3 times without success and moved on to IVF.
infertility,feohxdo,t1_fenl93m,1579300443.0,That really sucks! How do the doctors know that?
AskReddit,felfjcn,t1_felc9ju,1579220976.0,I don't think that's right.
insaneparents,fehhxwm,t1_feh5avm,1579116897.0,"True, but they were dumb to not follow the recommendation to get a flu shot every fall. It could have prevented her from going blind."
insaneparents,feh1h9z,t1_fegvlj4,1579107168.0,"Sorry, that's ridiculous."
insaneparents,feh1fbp,t1_fegvdfr,1579107135.0,The parents didn't get her a flu shot for this season - she had one last season.
insaneparents,feh17xf,t1_fegs0j8,1579107009.0,The news reported that she received the shot in early 2019 - at the end of last year's flu. She should have gotten another flu shot in the fall.
aww,feez4o9,t1_feer984,1579044414.0,"I've been there. I've had doctors say that, but there are medications, IUI, and IVF, that can help. Doctors don't know everything and sometimes people conceive spontaneously when they've been told it's impossible. Hormones can change and life finds a way."
aww,feeckuc,t1_fee38up,1579030972.0,You obviously know nothing about fertility.
aww,fee2py2,t1_fedplfl,1579025168.0,What makes you think that? Sometimes sex actually works...
aww,fee2lv6,t1_fedzq4d,1579025101.0,It's way more than that.
namenerds,fedchmv,t1_fecrvkp,1579007560.0,My mother in law and both her sisters' names are on your list!
Parenting,fe9xcw7,t1_fe9wu7t,1578942253.0,"The concern is more that if they roll to their sides, they could potentially suffocate in the sheet that's over the pool noodle."
Parenting,fe9szok,t1_fe9spp8,1578941222.0,I am also a NICU nurse and I have a lot of patients that can roll onto their sides swaddled.
Parenting,fe9s89z,t1_fe8rtdj,1578940987.0,My son rolled from belly to back at 2 weeks old. Their heads are large and they CAN roll. Your advice is not safe.
Rabbits,fe9qdny,t3_eo6ab8,1578940531.0,That's what I get for Floyd and he loves it!
WTF,fe5axv8,t1_fe3l6lp,1578867189.0,I don't know if some hospitals do it that way. I'm not sure why an NG would need sterile water when a PEG is fine with tap.
WTF,fdzryja,t1_fdv7soh,1578794394.0,"You can use tap water for either NG or PEG tubes. It all goes to your stomach and makes no difference. Also, saline is not the same as sterile water. They're completely different. Please check your sources."
namenerds,fdozmmi,t3_emgfs6,1578616517.0,I prefer Cora. It's simple and pretty. Emery feels too much like a little kid trying to pronounce Emily or something.
namenerds,fdo5stz,t3_emcalr,1578599403.0,"My name is similar and my nicknames growing up were Hilda, Hildy, and Hiddy Bitty. I think it's a bit outdated but lots of old names are coming back!"
nursing,fdn7hrn,t1_fdlzdkf,1578579387.0,That sounds horrific.
InfertilityBabies,fdhvhic,t1_fdhp2jp,1578430886.0,"This happened to me last week. I got a bad cold at 9 weeks and at 10 weeks had blood gushing, 1 inch clots and cramping. It was so much blood I was sure the baby was gone. My ultrasound the next day showed a healthy baby. I'm still freaked out because the SCH is still there so I'm still cramping a bit, but no bleeding right now. SCHs are very common for IVF pregnancies. I know it's scary. I hope you have a good outcome. Fingers crossed."
beyondthebump,fdhtggt,t3_el42az,1578429856.0,"I agree that it might be teething and/or transitioning to one nap. My son is 15 months and just started the exact same thing. From 4 months until now he's been sleep trained and goes to sleep without a peep. The screaming is new and so frustrating! We just transitioned to one nap but it's still happening. If I know all his needs are met, I let him cry it out until he falls asleep."
beyondthebump,fdeir61,t1_fdea3fq,1578339897.0,You're in the wrong thread. This thread is about not being perfect and being ok with that.
InfertilityBabies,fdby4hk,t1_fdbfl8n,1578263667.0,A lot of people are getting the flu even though they had the shot this year.
InfertilityBabies,fc8iqx2,t1_fc6z8c5,1577535787.0,Those are all great points!
InfertilityBabies,fc5w63q,t1_fc44xca,1577467176.0,"Many OB's say they require you to pre-pay - legally, they can't force you to pay for something that hasn't taken place yet. I refused to pre-pay and waited for the bill after the birth. It was less than they were trying to get me to pre-pay. Just know your rights!"
beyondthebump,fc5eero,t1_fc5604r,1577455121.0,Some people prefer to use their hands.
beyondthebump,fc3odw1,t3_efytml,1577394582.0,"You could use those toys during close supervision. Some of the toys I got say 3 years and up, but are completely appropriate. Others that had small parts can still be used if you're paying close attention. Don't get too hung up on the number."
beyondthebump,fc3o46o,t3_efzqie,1577394387.0,Nail polish is not going to harm your baby.
AskReddit,fbm3z37,t1_fbm3gux,1576977770.0,My baby ate table food before he had teeth. Their gums are very hard.
