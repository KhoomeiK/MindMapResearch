Parenting,ff5pcng,t3_errt57,1579604550.0,"I’d like to offer you some reassurance on the speech issues. I studied linguistics and sign language in an immersion environment in university. 

[here is a link](https://astrid.care/speech-sound-development-chart/)  to a chart which shows what sounds your child should be able to produce. The start of the bars is the earliest possible occurrence of the sound, and the end of the bar is the last possible time they should have mastered it by to still be in normal range. 

By age one, your child should only have 1-2 words that can produce consistently. And they may be generalizations, like calling both mum and dad the same name. Or every furry creature with four legs is a “doggy.” Additionally, there’s a three month window after word milestones to still be considered within normal parameters.

I wouldn’t be overly concerned with speech just yet. I actually wouldn’t worry overly about the speech until 18 months. At 18 months they should have about 20 words. And even then, I would wait until 21 months to really push for a speech language assessment if they’re behind on words AND consonants they can produce from the chart. 

At this point in their development, if you saw a speech language pathologist, they would tell you to narrate everything you do, to read more books and talk about the pictures, and to sing more songs. You could also babble at then with the “next” sound they should be learning to produce. You could do this by saying words that start with that sound or just making the sound repeatedly. There’s not a lot that can be done in terms of intervention at 10 months, and most SLPs won’t see a child this young. Just give them more linguistic input, that’s all you can do at this point. 

On the sign language, my experience with people trying to teach baby signs is that it never works if it is done inconsistently. You have to be saying the word and showing the sign EVERY time for a hearing child to pick it up. You haven’t given any details there, so I can only tell you the most common problem I’ve seen. 

Good on you for championing for your kid! Keep pushing, get a second opinion if you can. It’s a tough road to be an advocate when something is wrong, but if you feel something isn’t right don’t give up."

Your brain is used to a certain pattern of behaviour that is comfortable and familiar. You get SOMETHING out of living in the past, because living with uncertainty in the present is hard, but reliving the past? You know exactly what’s there and can spin on it. 

But now you went and decided to change things, and your brain went along with it for a few days before it went “oh wait, you’re serious about this? NOOOOOOO!!!” And tried to get you to go back to the comfortable rut you were in.

I find when I get like this that it’s helpful to pull out my inner Vulcan to assess what’s going on. “It appears that your brain is having an extinction burst. This behaviour is expected, and will worsen before it improves and is then eliminated. Recommended course of action is to continue as planned with exercise, nutritional food intake and meditation.”

At lunch you realize that you’ve forgotten yours at home, and it’s the day before payday so you don’t have any cash to spare. Or you forgot to pack casual clothes to change into to go to a friends house after work. 

Well, getting ready the night before means that you know your clothes are clean, that you don’t have to worry about finding socks or matching up an outfit. It means your lunch is packed and ready to go, that your phone is charging and your keys are by the door. 

You will spend so much less time racing around in the morning that it will feel like a breeze. And that will set the tone for the rest of your day. Having a solid start means putting in a little work the night before, but it means that you have a much higher chance of having a good day."

Lunges and squats will also help your knees, but a great exercise/stretch is knee circles. Stand with feet together, knees slightly bent.

If the internet and overeating are because you’re bored - is there something you’ve always wanted to learn? Coding, a language, an instrument or knitting?

Or, could you make plans with friends that are active? Like geocaching or hiking. Try to avoid food based activities like going for coffee. 

If the overeating is to soothe your feelings, could you pick up a hobby like drawing or painting? “Drawing your feelings” can be effective for some people in feeling less overwhelmed by how they are feeling.

Edit: you knew what, here’s a [link](https://astrid.care/speech-sound-development-chart/)  to a chart that shows what ages they should acquire each sound.

AskReddit,fddnnfg,t3_eks8pw,1578318838.0,"I don’t think of myself as racist, but I definitely saw that some stereotypes can be accurate while working retail. 

Specifically Desi stereotypes. I worked custom retail, which is more expensive and more variable in pricing based on what options are selected.

Desi people show up to make a large purchase in groups so that they can tag team the person they are buying from and try to haggle.  I NEVER served a single Desi customer one on one. They always came with at least four other people and they were the absolute worst customers to deal with. They were always rude, and always twisted my words. They talked over each other and bickered over options (“but I like this better!”) when the person doing the actual purchasing should have had complete choice autonomy. I never had a “good” encounter with a Desi family while working retail. 

It didn’t change the level of service I provided or my friendliness. I treat everyone with dignity and respect, but I will admit that when I saw a Desi family at my counter, my heart would sink. I knew that I would be in for a long, drawn out and headache producing encounter that would take four times longer than my other transactions. I know this because I timed it several times because I wondered if the job was making me prejudiced.

After I left that job, I’ve had a few Desi coworkers and they have been a joy to work with. They were hardworking, conscientious and I loved chatting with them. Some of the best coworkers I’ve had, and some of the best people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. The level of care they show those in their social circles is exemplary. I didn’t let my previous negative experiences colour how I treated them, because I knew that we were in a totally different social dynamic than before. 

I know it’s cultural to haggle, and I know that Desi families are more enmeshed than Western families. In some ways, it’s really good! There is a much better support structure for families, especially new immigrants. I think in some ways, westerners need to redevelop some of that enmeshment and maybe we’d lower our rates of mental illness. We’re all too isolated.

AskReddit,fddlgdt,t3_ekt5mo,1578316771.0,"I work in the buying department for a retailer. We choose what items will end up on the shelves.

Analysis - sales, competition, shelf space efficiency, turns(how long it takes to rotate our inventory), how advertised sales events performed, if the packaging quantities make sense for how much product we are moving, return rates

Planning - new items, which items should be discontinued, pricing strategies, what items will go in flyers, how to market products so that customers can make the right product choice for their application (goal is that they don’t have to return it because it doesn’t do what they thought)

Social - negotiating terms and pricing with suppliers, getting other departments on board with our plans because we need them to do something more labour intensive than normal or that requires the development of new procedures

But really, a lot of my day is solving problems my products and suppliers cause for other people and departments. Supplier isn’t delivering on time? I’m the one contacting them to find out when we will see our products. Product safety issue? I’m the one organizing a recall. Stores tell us that the product comes too many in a box so they’re gathering dust on the shelf? I’m the one making arrangements with the supplier for smaller boxes.  Stores/customers tell us that they don’t understand which item they should be choosing or recommending?

Here’s my experience. I gained about 22 pounds by 38 weeks, and then another 5-6 of water weight in the three weeks after that. A week postpartum, I was back down to just three pounds over my prepregnancy weight. Which is not the norm. 

I did this by counting calories. Im already overweight and quite intentionally made sure to not overgain during my pregnancy. The average extra consumption for the baby is about 200-300 calories. That’s not a lot, it’s the equivalent of one extra snack a day. But that’s really all baby needs. 

Unrelated and unsolicited pregnancy advice: start doing knee and ankle rehab exercises now. In the third trimester when your body makes your hips and pelvis separate, it doesn’t just target those areas. It targets ALL connective tissues, and your knees and ankles suffer the most for it because you’re putting extra weight on those joints. Doing exercises intended for sprained ankles and knees will strengthen them and you will have less joint pain in month 9 when most women are desperately uncomfortable. 

Good luck!"
