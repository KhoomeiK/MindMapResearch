NatureIsFuckingLit,ff40y4j,t1_ff3potb,1579553155.0,"Yep that's fair. As a border state I wouldn't say it has nothing to do with Vermont but it is equality important to note the origins of the policy aren't based on Vermont's values. To me it's more about recognizing and accepting these aspects of our government/society and also thinking about what power we have as local citizens to mitigate those aspects.

For example I'm from Boston. There's not much for me to do in the 2020 election besides vote for a democratic primary that I enjoy but ultimately Arizona, Maine, Colorado, and North Carolina have a more important vote than me. Therefor, it's my job to understand how Boston, Ma plays a role in systemic racism (our schools) and dedicating my available time to research those issues so I know which local elections and town hall protests matter most. 

I only add the last part to communicate that I don't mean to judge Vermont. This is more about me wanting people to be aware of the history and Vermont's (well the United State's) current state of existence to inform what actions they can do if they aren't happy with the state.

I always see us on Reddit (when the Aussies are asleep) talking about the big things happening all over the country and I always see the Aussies and other people on the outside telling us to do something. I'm tired of people saying there's nothing we can do. When it comes to federal issues sure, but we should all have some understanding of how our local policies play a larger role in the systemic issues all Americans face in the background. To me, it's all about being part of your local politics. End rant."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff3cm5m,t1_ff38ntc,1579538483.0,">I don’t know how much less racist New England could really become besides having forced re-education camps or something extreme like that, otherwise you’re always going to have a minority of bad people and as long as it’s frowned upon by society like it is now, that’s really the best we can do.

But it isn't totally frowned upon by society. Maybe in your perspective it is, but not from what I and others have experienced. While violent acts are frowned upon, racism is only frowned upon as it's understood; meaning if you don't realize something is racist you can't 'frown upon' it. The racism that makes up New England is systemic, not societal. It is subtle and cannot be seen from a singe interaction, rather it is a collection of populations being shoved to one area while another population is shoved to a different area. Then that divide increases as we get into conversations surrounding transportation, education, job outlooks, housing, and social services. Having the ability and resources to move to Vermont is a privilege for those wealthier than others, the privilege is choice. That wealth, being distributed the way it is today, is inequitable and thus a form of gatekeeping. The lack of transport, education, and sustainable jobs for low wage workers, while it's mostly classism, is also systemic racism. In order to prosper in New England one would have to assimilate to the way New England society works, which is the gatekeeper. 

&#x200B;

>Individuals will be racist, it doesn’t detract from the quality of a place or region until it becomes a societal norm of that area.

This is the only part I disagree with, really (above is a friendly debate). Individuals who make up even a small pocket of society are impossible to ignore and just because the majority tells them to fuck off that does not lessen their existence or will. They are still part of the overall community."

relationship_advice,feyd5gv,t1_feyb3tr,1579443998.0,"Well hold on now don't take her actions to your fault. You did NOT make the wife behave in any way whatsoever. While what I said above is something I think that needed to be shared you also don't need to be putting the extra burden on yourself. 

You did fuck up. For not reflecting on your feelings, or not establishing better boundaries. And she fucked up, I would say 1000x worse than you if that means anything. She betrayed her vowes, she decided to cheat, she had already gotten into her own head and yours by asking you about what feelings you may have had for her. Being honest when she asked was okay. 

The wife needed to have the ""Am I worth it"" conversation months ago; that conversation is no longer possible because she has shown what the relationship is worth to her. There is nothing left to save. 

More so, if the wife KNEW she wasn't happy and she was venting to you then she should've fucking had her own stupid boundaries after kissing you. She is the primary fucker upper who brought you into the mess. You chose to jump in hole but she's the one with the shovel.

Seriously, don't waste time here. You won't be satisfied with the wife - How could you be? She has only shown you red flags. She runs away when she's afraid, she scouts for emotional support when her partner is unavailable, she can't make sense of her emotions before making a decision, she cheats when she's unhappy.. These are not the traits of someone you want to be with... And you have some of these characteristics now!

Leave both your friend and the wife. Focus on yourself. Understand what boundaries you have in life, what you will and won't and want to do. Take what you want in the right way by knowing what you are willing to do take it. You aren't the type of person who wants to cheat their way into a relationship and it sounds like you know that. What else is there you haven't figured out about yourself that is worth knowing? 

You're not scum, dude. You just did something scummy. You did something bad but you're also capable of doing something good. Yet, you aren't ever going to be a good or bad person, just a person who can do good and bad things. So don't consider your scum."
relationship_advice,fey7ov9,t1_fey5m30,1579441862.0,"Dude 4 months is not a lot of time to get over someone. You have to try harder if you want distance to work. Besides, the distance and time don't change anything, it's what you do with that time that matters. You're the tar pit and moving won't change what you are. It doesn't matter how different you think your story is it's not. You and someone else disrespected the boundaries established by her and and her husbands, your friend's partnership, more so someone you've known since you were 13. I'm 24 and have had friends for just as long I know what that shit means. You betrayed him, her, and yourself.

If you were capable of even being with someone in a situation like this you'd have realized in your time away how to communicate your feelings in the moment of sexual tension. You didn't reflect on that. If you had you would've had a conversation after your kiss, an honest and respectful decision could have been made for the betterment of all 3 of you. If Poly is an option that was the time to suggest it, if getting a divorce is best that was the time to bring it up. But no, you and her pounded the fuck out of each other while your 'FRIEND' OF 10 YEARS was at work.

You missed your chance to make it something better. Now you have to live with distance, truth, or miracle. My advice to own up to your mistake with the wife and write a long ass hand written letter of apology to the 10 year ex-friend then move on with your life.

I'm sorry if this is rough but fuck you and fuck the wife. You two are scum and you SHOULD feel bad. Go a hold of your own feelings before you trample someone else's.

Go get distance and figure out what makes you happy and go pursue that the hardest you can. This life with this wife is long gone. You need to make your story, your life about you."

AnimalsBeingBros,fe8rv72,t1_fe8lvtj,1578929955.0,"INT is usually used for a players ability to breakdown concepts. So a low INT player might make an assumption on a game mechanic and fail to break it down to it's core features whereas a high INT character will be more successful at communicating complex processes. 

I find INT behaves a lot like Charisma but it uses research and knowledge convince others instead of charm, persuade, and intimidate. 

INT also seems to effect how fast a player can grasp a new concept. If anything it's much like that sub-game Fallout where higher INT leads to a faster gain in XP. In our game higher INT leads to faster skill learning. 

So if you wanna blow through the game using INT remember that it's mostly a buffer for other skill trees like Charisma or ranking up a blacksmith skill tree."

I want someone who can do a sumo smash and shockwave enemies as their special ability. A great tactical would be blowing enemies back like a force weapon (no damage) and their passive could be the ability to sprint at doors to break them. (Offense)

I want someone who can break down unwanted items and convert them into med kits and shied cells as their tactical. Tactical ability could be automatic ammo conversion for whatever gun they have equipped and their passive might be something like having 2 extra inventory slots all the time or maybe a 3rd weapon slot for only a pistol.

I'd also like to see a legend who has the ability to drop jump towers as their special. Not a line that goes up to the sky, rather one of those launchers from the Mirage train game mode.

The US destabilized central America. My mother came to America from El Salvador from a war the US backed. Today the US (under Trump) continues to do through its immigration policy and lack of cooperation with other countries.

>After several decades of this practice they have left their country to drug cartels that rape and pillage anywhere they want.

Mexican leadership usually kill drug dealers, addicts, and general users. At the same time, drug dealers use bribery to operate without the police chasing after them. Much of this corruption comes from the lack of educated drug regulation along with US corruption to protect political figures who may profit from allowing drug dealers into the US. Popular in the 80s, probably still popular today.

You should revisit the past 100 years of history. Actually start with WWI and how the British invaded the Ottoman Empire and then... ACTUALLY NO! Start in the 1800s when the US made certain drugs illegal to tame competitors in other countries! Modern day example: US doesn't want to import sugar or MSG so we make all our sweets out of corn syrup. In the 1800s the US wanted people on pepsin or coke for medicine, not marijuana... Marijuana was one of Mexico's exports and it wasn't just for medical consumption. 

Knowing about current events is useless unless you know how we got here."

iran,fddxuye,t1_fdcubrm,1578326616.0,"We're not gonna have a draft in the US. A draft mobiles the public to got to war (which we don't want) so not having a draft is politically more convenient for Trump. 

The reason it is politically convenient is because Trump would rather have you feel anxiety and uncertainty towards your future to distract you from Impeachment and the 2020 elections. Vote for your president, vote for your senator, vote for your representatives.

The reason I believe a draft won't happen and that this is all a malice political stunt is that

A) Trump said Obama was going to do this exact thing on Twitter years ago, and;

B) Nixon already did the same thing during Vietnam as he contemplated eliminating the draft to discourage young voters from voting because the 'high stakes' were taken off of them. By creating a draft Trump would activate more young voters. By enticing fear into your mind on this subject, Trump hopes to distract you from what is already happening in 2020 and that is the election."

\>I was saying the US was being terrorists.

\>Just In a way that explained the argument to those who will be far to offended by the very idea to just accept it with.

Why is the idea of the US President operating as a terrorist explained in a way that is meant to cater those whose perceptions aren't grounded in reality? You need to outright say it. \*\*The US government is operating as terrorists\*\* I fear if it isn't directly stated people will continue to justify, beat around the bush, and ultimately judge the US differently than ""real"" terrorists."
