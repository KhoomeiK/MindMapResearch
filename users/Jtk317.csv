MurderedByWords,ffba1u4,t1_ffb9li9,1579756868.0,"Cheapest BSc of Geology in the country is Utah Valley university and costs about $8200 yearly for in state tuition. You either get a bunch of scholarships/grants, have a separate career allowing you to pay, are prior/current military, or have another way to pay tuition to graduate with a 4 year degree for 15K. Either that or you graduated quiet a while ago when tuition was considerably cheaper."

MurderedByWords,ffb8len,t1_ffb6fkx,1579755115.0,"In state tuition of state universities in PA when I got my first degree was 12-14K per year. That was in 2004-2008. Tuition increased slightly each year. My next time around I worked full time through a 2 year program for a new degree and still wound up with 35K in loan debt. I was a 30 year old with an 8 year positive work history, mortgage, no other debt outside of the 6K I had left on my school loans, and credit above 700. I got turned down for private loans ""due to being a risk"". I never was given a reason why that was justified. Might have had a few late payments but never went to default, collections, etc. None of of my schooling was at private universities. Maybe a liberal arts degree at a CC can be had for under 20K, but anything else will incur other costs in money and time.

People get the government loans because the interest rates are affordable and current minimum wage is not appropriate for cost of living in the US. Most community colleges do not have certification in some higher paying fields so the major utilization of them is in getting gen ed courses done relatively cheaply. They know this and therefore increase prices to make money off of those courses. Same for the schools providing the in major courses for whatever degree is being sought.

You cannot make minimum wage in the US and pay for college in a reasonable time period. As opposed to 50 years ago when working a few hundred hours paid for a degree. Now it costs thousands of your work hours to pay for a degree. Wages did not maintain pace with inflation but costs sure did. People get these loans to try to get ahead EVENTUALLY."

physicianassistant,fetg47q,t3_eq9xko,1579375135.0,"I basically went through this myself in my first position in a large ICU (multispecialty and the PAs/NPS rotated through different wards).

You will be ok. Critical care in general is a lot to handle in both practice and theory. You are going to feel like a failure for a bit but do not let that be what you take away. It was a big swing, you tried, and you found out you need more experience before something like that. I would look at urgent cares and internal medicine/family practice offices in your area and if your healthcare network has a transfer policy, see what avenues might be open for getting into a different specialty with the same employer.

I was in that ICU for 5 months total, made good corrections toward the end and was told about that by attendings, but they had recently needed to do extended trainings for 2 providers that ended up not staying and were unwilling to see if my trend would continue improving. It is what it is. I work a mix of urgent care and community medicine now. The hours are more family friendly for me, I still see some things that are likely outside what urgent care should and find ways to help those patients, and I get to learn things daily that improve my practice. I also have recognized some things early that may have been missed if I hadn't spent time in a critical care environment previously. 

Again, you will be ok. Look into the transfer option and do your best to have a plan for acquiring skills/knowledge in whatever position you expect. You know you weren't prepared for memorizing order sets, med routes/dosages, etc so make sure you have an idea of what is expected in your new field prior to getting there. Talk to attendings and senior PAs in that field to find what they are looking for in both general and somewhat detailed terms.

Good luck! And again, YOU WILL BE OK!"

I've worked in 4 different parts of medicine over the last 12 years and ended up having to turn down a med school acceptance in my early 20s due to other situations in life. Being jaded is one thing, being a pessimist is another. I agree the system we have needs an overhaul, I also think you knew how much it would cost, at least financially, when you started taking loans out. If you want things to be better, then finish your training, kill it in residency and fellowships, and get into a position to do some good regarding changes in the healthcare schooling, training, and employment landscape. Push for better teaching, training, and financial options and don't keep the idea that future generations should need to go through what you did to ""prove themselves"" as many residents go through with some attendings once they match.

FYI, some NPs can get online degrees in some states. PAs cannot anywhere. I have met some of both who were better in their fields than attendings. Do not bash people that want to help others, would gladly help you once you're in a clinical environment (provided you don't bring a huge dickish ego with you), and who do so at a distinct pay cut from you.
