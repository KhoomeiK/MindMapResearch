socialskills,feay3og,t1_fe5vkf0,1578953415.0,I see! Do you have any suggestions for any good questions to ask? Or how to think of any on the spot?
socialskills,fe5pzps,t3_ent281,1578872898.0,"Yeah, I feel that, even among groups of friends where I feel like they're closer with each other than with me.

It can be hard, and I still struggle with it too, but I just try to make conversation with the people around me. It helps me stay a bit more in the present moment, because I know I worry a lot about how I fit in the big picture."

socialskills,fe2x67t,t3_eb7g2r,1578843845.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you've had those experiences. I know that can make things difficult.

I'm personally not a very direct person, but I can actually appreciate when someone is direct when it's important. I'd feel bad if something was bothering someone or causing an issue and they weren't comfortable mentioning it.

I don't usually see directness as manipulative, unless it's done specifically to get things from people, like taking advantage of someone and knowing that they're vulnerable. And then that tends to border more on passive-aggressiveness.

I think it sounds like you're really making the effort to be empathetic. I would say that's the most important thing."
pokemon,fdyq006,t1_fdwbw2z,1578782418.0,"This. I mentioned this in another thread, but in the case of the double-release times, if you just wait until the sequel comes out or only buy the initial game, you'll only spend for one game. Yeah, third full-price games are a scam, but at least the first game released was a full game. That's $40 for a full game, versus $90 for a kinda full game with its kinda helpful DLC."

pokemon,fdppac0,t3_emb347,1578635444.0,"I'm not against the idea of paid DLC in games but I am against it being a sort of crutch for the original game. From what I hear, Sword and Shield's base game is just as lacking content-wise as Sun and Moon and XY. I don't know that for sure since I've played UM and Y, but not SwSh, so if I'm wrong, fair enough - this is just based on what I've heard and seen.

Going off of Diamond and Pearl as an example, I got a lot of enjoyment out of gen 4. Like, at least 50-100 hours before I beat the game. Compare that to Y and UM, where I beat each of them in <20 hours. Time isn't everything, I know, and gen 4 is a slow game, but I have fonder memories and time with gen 4 than gen 6 and 7 combined. Even after replaying it and being exposed to all its flaws again.

That doesn't excuse Platinum being a barely changed re-release of the game. But at the very least, the original games, Diamond and Pearl, were sufficient on their own. XY and SM are not sufficient on their own. I've *heard* SwSh is not sufficient on its own. If this is true, I take issue with this because I think paid DLC should come as a continued addition to a complete game, not one that barely has any value on its own.

Basically, especially in this day and age where you can see reviews of games and see if they're pretty much almost the same as the previous games \*cough\* Ultra Sun Ultra moon \*cough\* I'd much rather prefer a case like gen 4 where I enjoyed the base game and got slapped with a re-release than to get a less-than-satisfactory base game with DLC. I would buy the original game and withhold my money for the re-release, as opposed to being in the case of SwSh where I don't feel inclined to buy the game at all."
Anxiety,fdlwkd3,t1_fdlnj07,1578534221.0,"I see. I'm sorry for being insensitive, I didn't mean to generalize your experience with anxiety. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I've been trying to get rid of all anxiety that I experience, if that makes sense. I guess I've only recently been able to believe that some anxiety can be good. But I can understand that the disorder aspect of anxiety can be really detrimental and difficult to deal with. I wish you the best of luck."

overcoming,fdir4ui,t3_eliqg9,1578449179.0,"I feel for a lot of this. Seeing a therapist can be rough when it's not that frequent, and living in that sort of environment can be very harsh.

I'm glad to hear that your friends are still reaching out to you. Maybe that means that they value you as a person. I just thought I'd mention that, because I don't think you're a burden.

It's hard, so I don't blame you that the motivation is hard to reach. I feel that too - motivation can be very flippant and hard to grasp a lot of the time. It's hard when you're feeling this way.

I have my fingers crossed that you can find a way to reach out. I'm rooting for you!

Also lemme know what games you're playing, I'm curious too!"
overcoming,fdenv3z,t3_ekwbf5,1578342954.0,"I feel that, I'm in a similar boat. Senior in college here. I felt similarly in high school (including with having an Asian family focusing on getting As and Bs) and even up until now, really. It's a tough rut to get out of, to be honest.

What I find helpful is setting specific goals for the day that I can follow through with. Some more important than others, of course. I'm trying to get into the habit of scheduling work for my days because that sort of structure really helps me have something to focus on.

I also try to schedule in down time. I find if I try to pack all kinds of work in a short span of time, it feels good in the moment, but I burn out fast.

Making these goals usually helps me feel satisfied with what I did during the day, even if I don't meet all of them - as long as I made the effort and did the important ones.

Also, I just want to say that finding motivation is really, really tough and abstract. I've still yet to find a real driving force to keep going besides wanting to experience more in life. Don't be too hard on yourself, it's a real thing to feel burnt out on working hard, especially if you don't like the work that you're doing. It might help to explore some new things in life to find new things that interest you."
