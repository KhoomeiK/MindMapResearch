A racist is someone who says or does racist things, yes?  If doing or saying racist things doesn't make someone a racist, what does?

As such, when you claim that someone is doing or saying racist things, you are also accusing them of being a racist.  You can't hide behind semantics and claim that you aren't accusing someone of being racist because you never use the word 'racist' - the same way that saying, 'certain ethnicities perform poorly on IQ tests...' and claiming nothing racist was said is hiding behind semantics."

Carpal tunnel is *usually* a repetitive stress injury - doing the same motion over and over and over again.  If anything, climbing will help to strengthen the forearm muscles and ligaments, which will make those tissues more resilient against injury and inflammation.

Absolutely.  Something like a motorcycle is an absolute weight - it doesn't matter if you can bench press a car or can't lift a box of kleenex - the motorcycle is the same amount of resistance.

Climbing isn't like that.  If you aren't a very large person - guess what?  You don't need to be very strong!  You only need to be strong enough for your body size.  Furthermore, if you're capable of climbing a set of stairs, you're capable of climbing.  

I'm not saying that you'll be swinging from the rooftops 5 minutes in.  There's a lot of technique involved in climbing, and a lot of people who are new at climbing compensate for having no technique by just brute-forcing through things.  

Something that I really recommend to new climbers is to watch how skilled women climb.  Men are particularly prone to brute-forcing their way thorugh things, but for most women, even at the elite level, that isn't an option.  So, instead, they learn to apply what strength they have in the most effective way possible.  So watch how they move, how they shift their weight, how they orient their hips and shoulders, and climb like a girl!

Plus, the more you do it, the stronger you'll get.  Chances are, the first few times you try climbing, you'll get real tired real quick - mostly because the muscles you're using aren't used to being used in that way.  But, as your muscle coordination rapidly improves over the first few weeks, you'll find yourself seemingly magically getting stronger than you thought possible, and it just gets better from there!"

Say there are two cops arresting someone.  One of the cops starts just beating the arrestee and winds up beating the arrestee to death.  The other cop doesn't stop him, but tells their supervisor what happened.  Do you have one bad cop - the one who was beating the arrestee? Or two bad cops - the one who did the beating and the one who watched it happen and didn't stop it?

The 'its just a few bad apples' point of view is that the only cop who was bad was the one directly involved in beating the guy to death.  However, the vast majority of people in this country would agree that the cop who stood by and watched it happen is also a bad cop - so you have two bad cops. Basically, a cop who stands by and allows other cops to do bad things is themselves a bad cop.

Every time one of these incidents occur, there are a lot of cops who effectively 'stand by' and allow it to happen.  Supervisors that don't review reports/body cams, internal affairs investigators that don't follow up with witnesses, chiefs who refuse to enact meaningful punishment, and every cop in the union that fights against accountability.  Because they facilitate the activities of bad cops, they themselves are bad cops, just the same as the cop who stands by while his partner beats someone to death.  

As such, the vast majority of police are bad cops."

Get yourself a buddy and some peyote.  Find the nearest desert arid space, take that peyote with your buddy, have a deep conversation with the Universal Tortoise about the nature of reality and self-fulfillment, drink some water, have a good nap, and see how the next day is."

todayilearned,fefe5wj,t1_fefciqz,1579054399.0,"So I'm getting a PhD, and one of the things my lab studies is altitude. 

Boukreev is right.  The whole time he isn't using oxygen while in the death zone, his body is trying to compensate for the hypoxia.  Ultimately, it cant, hence 'death zone', but it's trying.  His body is producing and releasing more hemoglobin and  reducing blood plasma levels to help increase the amou t of oxygen delivered per unit of blood.  But the person on oxygen? They aren't.  They're body isn't trying to compensate for as severe a level of hypoxia. So, when that oxygen runs out, it's like you're dropping them halfway up the mountain from sea level - they cant function.

Plus, even with oxygen, you're still dealing with all the problems of hypobaria, *and* you're carrying around an oxygen tank!"
