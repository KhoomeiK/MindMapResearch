I couldn't agree more and have been touting this for over a decade now.  I've run for State Congress in Texas 3 times and always focused on that as a reality.  Unfortunately, there just aren't that many people who are pushing for it (or really who even understand the issue).  We've really become a country of people who are just entirely apathetic UNTIL it happens to us.  But we can't operate that way and expect any kind of success.

People need to force that issue into the political system, make it a real talking point, and then act on it.  But until that happens, you're right - there is simply no economic reason or financially punitive measure for it stopping."
PublicFreakout,ff7ba5v,t1_ff77oqw,1579645359.0,"I agree that most of the SC go about this the wrong way and it usually doesn't play out very well to the camera.  But the reason they feel they need to is because the average person will submit to any kind of authority regardless of the legality of it and can't be bothered even filing a followup complaint.  Apathy is unfortunately a rampant problem in the United States and it's led to terrible actions and consequences (which of course we all complain about while simultaneously not doing anything about).

I mean, the system that we have requires people of authority to act in a certain way.  There is a video posted to Reddit at least once per week of some LEO entirely ignoring even the most basic decorum and civility - even when the person they're talking to is being polite, respectful, and not in any way a threat to them.

So it's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't sort of situation.  Until regular people start holding LEOs responsible when they step over the line and demand they be held accountable for reckless and needlessly aggressive behaviors, I'm not really sure what we're supposed to do since people shit all over the SCs too."

For one, they did them in the most HIV-laden parts of the world where hygiene and basic medical care is essentially non-existent.  But more importantly is that they'll frequently describe the percentages in terms of doubling or tripling or what not.

But what they don't usually tell you is what the starting statistic is when they double or triple it.  It's like if someone told you they just made an investment where they doubled or tripled their money.  It might be true, but it doesn't mean they really made any money if they only were allowed to invest a nickel at the onset.  So when the percentage of the control is say 0.02% and it doubles or triples, the inherent risk is still pretty negligible on the population as a whole."

Politicians do the same thing.  Of course they've made up a whole vocabulary of bullshit words to call it something else and \[most of\] the country has joyfully gone along with it - much like a young virgin can blow a whole football team and she's still okay just so long as she doesn't have sex, god forbid - literally (or apparently anyways).

There are so many mountains out there that you can climb and the trekking in general is heaps of fun. There are, btw, a handful of mountains that you’re not permitted to climb since they are considered sacred to the Buddhists, the government had restricted them for safety, or both. 

Another curiosity about being out there is that the mountains really don’t look that big. In part because they’re spread out and so the further off ones just naturally look not as tall. But more so because you’re already at such elevation when you’re looking at them that they look similar to big mountain ranges in many parts of the world. You really have to keep it in perspective that you’re seeing an entire mountain in front of you while ALREADY being at, say 4,000 or something. It’s wild."

todayilearned,fevzgic,t1_fevy0fn,1579403425.0,"Ah, you're welcome.  Definitely read it that way.

To be clear, Nepal is an *extremely* impoverished country.  Many of the Sherpa are equally very, very poor and live in very basic conditions.  I am friends with some of these Sherpa too, but of course they tend to be less fluent in English and my Nepali isn't particularly good (beyond greetings and price negotiation and such).  The friends I have made over the years tend to come from the slightly wealthier families who own a lot of land, have run successful businesses, and now are giant runners of tourism.  So there's a large gap in income, education, living conditions, and general way of life (just wanted to make sure you didn't think all of them have western experiences as many - quite likely most - do not).

There's also a rather large difference in religion throughout Nepal.  A lot of Nepal is a Hindu nation, but the Sherpas practice a form of Tibetan Buddhism and so even that is very different.  There is, of course, a lot of overlap between Hinduism and Buddhism, but there are also a lot of differences and you can see these as you go towards the mountains in the Solukhumbu District (where Everest is).

The Sherpa were also under threat of ethnic cleansing by the Maoists just 20 years ago.  You can look it up, but I know several Sherpas who were deemed important in their village (for one reason or another - school teachers, mayors, etc) and so they fled their country in the late 90s/early 00s - mostly to the United States.  Some of them never came back to Nepal, but those who did only did so in the past several years."

todayilearned,fevwifb,t1_fevuqto,1579402326.0,"For sure - I've seen packages and read about trekkers spending that kind of money, but you definitely don't need to spend anything like that.  There are a lot of comforts you can find in Nepal for the right price, but you can also have a much simpler experience and spend far less than that.  Admittedly, it's not especially cheap climbing Everest any way you look at it.  BUT, if it's a dream of yours and something you're only going to do once, it's certainly not unobtainable either.  People spend far more money on far stupider things.

todayilearned,fevvx15,t1_fevu75f,1579402100.0,"Well you definitely have to be capable of acclimatizing to the altitude - no doubt about that.  When we take people, we usually stay in Kathmandu for a few days and then slowly make our way out to the mountains.  So generally about 5,000 feet for 3 days, then about 8,000 feet for 2 days, then we slowly start ascending.

Endurance is the biggest thing.  A few years ago I went when I was out of shape and it was pretty awful.  I mean, I made the treks, but damn was I hurting.  This last trip I took people on I'd been running every other day for about 6 months and so my endurance was really great.  I'd also spent a month living in Petra (Jordan) just before heading to Nepal and was hiking those mountains 4-5 times per week.

The hardest thing is the steepness by a long shot.  Having extremely good endurance helps tremendously, but you really have to be able to walk up thousands and thousands of steps in a given day to make those treks comfortably.

Anything under about 45 degrees the Sherpas will joke is flat.  But they're not really far off because the mountain treks are incredibly taxing on the climbing muscles of your body."

PublicFreakout,fett5w3,t1_fetoz6e,1579379773.0,"Dude, I'm not going to argue it.  Balance Fallacy has nothing to do with saying there are a statistically balanced number of voters.  It has to do with arriving at a logical conclusion by assuming and/or incorrectly deducing that the answer to a question must fall somewhere between A and B.  I'm not making ANY statements or conclusions about what the woman said or her beliefs or anything in between.  I'm merely saying that by the numbers, we have a statistically normalized curve of crazy people in the country (more or less).  That is to say, insanity doesn't favor one political side or the other.  There are not more crazy people who side with the left or more crazy people who side with the right.  They're, nominally anyways, the same on a statistical curve.  That's it.  So again, those numbers balance out in the end - strictly in a tabulating sense.  I'm sorry, but that's simply not Balance Fallacy.

The very link you included provides a simple example (as all logical fallacies can be broken down into something similar): ""There is a choice to make between doing ***X*** or doing ***Y***. Therefore, the answer is somewhere between ***X*** and ***Y***.""

So again, I'm not making any kind of statement where this sort of thing would be applicable.  I'm only looking at the numbers.  We know that the country is almost evenly split on politics.  It's about 50/50.  So unless there is some unique data that illustrates how crazy people favor one political side over another, the distribution of ""crazy"" is equally split across the population."

PublicFreakout,feqvo0g,t1_fepnuop,1579346604.0,"> This is patently and demonstrably false, and is a prime example of the Balance Fallacy.

So two quick points:

1) I am quite familiar with the Balance Fallacy (as well as the many other logical fallacies that have similarly coined named attached to them)

2) While I appreciate your effort and thinking here, this fallacy does not apply at all.  In fact no logical fallacy applies.  I'm not suggesting that the woman's ideas are correct or incorrect.  If I were suggesting something about her ideas by asserting that we're somewhere in between actual reality and her shall we say, ""unique"" way of thinking, then yes, you could say that I'm logically incorrect because of the Balance Fallacy.  But that's not what I was saying.

This is a statistical problem, not a logical gate of any kind.  Sadly, and while I fight rather vehemently to change this, there are only two sides of politics in the United States (left vs. right / liberal vs. conservative / Democrats vs. Republicans / blue vs. red / or however you want to phrase it).

The previous comment read: ""Yup. And her vote counts exactly as much as yours does.""

The statement I made in response to that was simply that it doesn't matter to me that she gets to vote since there is ""lunacy on all sides [2 sides in this case] and so it balances out"".  In other words, for as many crazy people out there that will vote for the Republicans, there are just as many crazy people out there that will vote for the Democrats and so in the end, the numbers are more or less a wash (which incidentally only matters if you think such people don't deserve the right to vote in the first place or something similar to that, which I don't think that, but that was what the previous commenter implied and what I was responding to).

I'm sure you could drill down and find some nominal statistical difference leaning one side or the other, but within reason, it's statistically balanced and so it doesn't matter to me that she gets to vote even though she appears unstable (as the previous comment was suggesting that I perhaps should care about this).  That's all. 

So again, it's not **her** logic I'm disputing and thus is not a logical problem, but rather **his** statistics that I'm commenting on and thus a mathematical problem."

What I mean is, we're the richest country in the world.  We've had a century of automation and industrialization.  We started miles ahead of virtually every other nation in the world, and yet for some reason we still have these huge swaths of our workforce who work jobs that can evidently be outsourced to some of the poorest developing nations on the planet.  Why do we not ever discuss the obvious root problem here?

I mean, if you live in the United States and your core competency of skill or labor has you competing against a person who grew up on a dirt floor with no running water, isn't there some hugely wrong with the system here?  Why are we trying to hold on to this way of life here?  It makes no sense.

It seems to me that the lowest working class of people in the US should STILL be working as low-level engineers or something that at least requires education and technical proficiency to master even if it's miles away from our most distinguished professions.

Anyway, I'm just always confused why we have these rancorous debates about outsourcing jobs while simultaneously ignoring the reality that our system is SUCH a failure that we STILL have people whose top skill level is performing a skill that we developed over a century ago!

I'm not faulting those people, necessarily, but just asking why we never discuss this failure in an honest fashion.  In short, there is always going to be a significant discrepancy between the most distinguished and least distinguished profession in any given market.

PublicFreakout,felituu,t1_felhh05,1579223210.0,"\> just because I give something away doesn’t mean it doesn’t have monetary worth

I'm not a lawyer either, but it's just as easy to argue it the other way too using equally lay thinking.  Everything tangible like that has a perceived value.  And the fact is that the perceived values of such goods is minuscule by comparison of what they might actually retail for - for the simple fact that nobody is willing to pay good money for the item that 1,000 people before him have touched.

I agree it's stupid, but so is recklessly trashing a store.  So I'd imagine a good lawyer could pretty easily convince a judge or jury that he was only destroying things that have the smallest value (open items on display) thus reducing his charges.

On the other hand, if you break enough small dollar items, it doesn't really matter that they're not expensive as it'll still add up.

I had a business partner once who wanted us to award him (equitably) for contributing $10,000 of computers to our business venture.  We looked at him stunned.  He had picked up those computers from his brother in law for $250 each (maybe $1,500 in total) which is why we agreed to let him buy them in the first place.  He tried to argue that he gets what the computers are valued at.  But that's not how it works - and the law (tax law even) is pretty black and white about that.  Had they been offered to us at their full price, we wouldn't have agreed to purchase them in the first place so their cost to our business was indeed $250 each and thus that's what he was credited.  Needless to say, we credited him $1,500, not $10k.  This would, in a way, be similar."
videos,feksptm,t1_fejdety,1579206811.0,"I have many friends in the Middle East and yes, I do travel their rather frequently.  I'm not associated with any particular group, but the area presents many interests to me personally.  The friends I have are generally well-educated, higher classed, wealthier, etc.  Certainly not rich by any stretch, but not impoverished either.

In any geopolitical conversation I've ever had with any of them, they will routinely point to the fact that both the US government AND the government of Russia have systematically destabilized,  impoverished, and destroyed large swaths of the region.

What's more is that it doesn't happen in a vacuum.  Jordan, for example, hasn't been involved in a war in many decades.  It is a peaceful, mixed-race, mixed-religion nation that has been relatively stable for a long time now.  It is, however, still a developing nation.  When the US (and Russia) intervene in countries like Syria, Iraq, and etc., the overwhelming force and power that these nations are able to bring is SO much greater than anything those countries can do on their own, that people are forced to flee their homes.  They simple haven't the infrastructure in place to withstand the continued bombardment of their homeland - even if one can make the argument that such bombardment serves a purpose (which, incidentally, neither I nor any of my friends would actually make, but let's just assume it is good - or noble and with purpose).

When people are forced to flee, the economic toll that this takes on surrounding countries is SO high, that it absolutely devastates the country thus ensuring that they can not possibly rise up and break away from their titular status of ""developing nation"".  It is simply impossible that they can sustain their own country while also providing humanitarian aid to the literal millions of people who flee.

Using Jordan as an example again, the population there has massively swelled from just a few million people to over ten million people in less than 20 years.  Imagine if the US rose from say 300 million to a billion people in that time period.  It would distort our societies beyond recognizable repair.  Hell, the GOP is attempting to make that same exact argument because of just a very small percentage in ""illegals"".  They make claims about how this destroys the job market, unfairly taxes the population, requires more hospitals, doctors, and general social infrastructure.

I don't agree with that in the US given the US has more money than anyone and the additional Mexican population is rather minuscule in comparison to the US population.  But in a country like Jordan, where the population has swelled several hundred percent and they don't even have the resources to help their OWN population, what do you think the outcome is?

So yes, the US is almost single handedly responsible for creating these devastating situations for people in the region.  It goes so far beyond just war, bombardments, and military strikes.  It is a far-reaching problem that has truly destroyed the lives of countless millions of people in the region and I would encourage you to reach out to such people in the area and ask them what changes they've seen to their country with this kind of US involvement.  Those changes are not good.  They're certainly not proportionally better than the problems that the US is claiming they are fixing and/or eradicating.  In other words, what good is it attempting to eradicate a terrorist group that occupies a very small portion of the region if it means destroying an area many, many times greater than that group's stronghold?  Yes, the people who were subjected to the brutality of such a regime are possibly in a better position, but that population is almost 0% by comparison to the size of the population that is now suffering as result of those US policies (not to mention there is no real evidence that the initial terrorist problems have actually been concluded as a result of US involvement)."

It effectively makes your muscles not work properly namely because of the nerves not functioning properly.  She has always described it as having the pins and needles.  You know, like when you sleep on your arm or cross your leg for too long or something like that - that very uncomfortable feeling you have and have to shake off.  She gets that all of the time in random appendages only it doesn't just go away.

It also means that her balance is often really messed up.  She'll fall for seemingly no reason.  Unfortunately as she is getting older it's getting worse and worse - I'm not sure if it's because the disease is progressing (I don't actually think so) or if she is just naturally weakening as she ages and since she is already at risk, it's just a nasty recipe for her not to be strong enough to combat it any longer.

It's often triggered by stress-like events.  For example, when I went off to college long ago (I'm into my 40s now), she went blind in one eye for a couple of weeks.  I am the eldest and therefore the first of her children to have left the house.  Obviously this is a big deal for most any parent, but if you have MS, that sort of emotional change can trigger an attack and sure enough it did.  Same thing as when her parents died, when we've had big changes in our family life, and things like that.

It's a really unpleasant disease and despite there being races and charities dedicated to it, we really don't know a great deal about it still.

She gets her brain scanned every so often to see the progress of it.  They look for lesions on your brain using an MRI (or maybe a CT; I forget).  They will also occasionally do a spinal tap and examine the ""soup"" in her spine to check for progressive damage.  There isn't some kind of binary test that we have to diagnose it either.  You can't just get your blood tested and find out, ""yep, I have MS"" - so instead they look at a number of factors and make the educated opinion that you have it.

There are 4 stages of it (1-4) with 1 being the lowest.  She has stage 2 and it is unlikely to progress further.  I can't remember the exact statistic, but I think it's that women develop it 4x more than men do, but WHEN men develop it, it's generally 4x worse - or something like that.  Basically you're much less likely to have it as a man, but if you ARE diagnosed with it, you're likely to have stage 3 or 4 whereas women are much more likely to have stage 1 or 2.

Anyway, that's some of the reality of living with it.  I feel bad for her, but there's little we can do other than try to help her when she has an attack (which if I wasn't clear above, it's not like an asthma attack where it goes away almost as suddenly as it comes on -- rather it can last quite awhile when there is an attack -- days or weeks or maybe longer, I'm not entirely sure)."

It's a pretty complicated topic, but I do agree that they have some questionable things like that they've done in the past few decades.  Certainly things that, IMO, run rather contrary to the type of Buddhism that they practice.  I would also agree that there is more of a tribalistic mentality to the country.  Not to say it's tribal at all (to anyone reading who might not know the country), but rather that the attitudes of people are tribal (perhaps nationalistic is a better word).

That all said, I think the somewhat objective reality right now is that Nepal is NOT doing a good job with certain types of tourism.  It's been pretty widespread news for the past year or two, but I've certainly spoken with people in Nepal about it also.  It doesn't really affect me very much given I don't participate in the Everest tourism (as I'd mentioned), but does seem to be a pretty big deal right now.  Many argue that the government is simply happy to collect all of the money without actually putting in the infrastructure to support the realities of having so many tourists.

The short of that equation is that Target (and most all big box stores like this) want nothing more than to make the experience as simple for you as possible.  They will literally do everything for you - so long as you keep spending more and more money there.  I'm pretty positive that they are MORE than happy for you to leave your cart next to your car when you're done shopping.  You did what they wanted you to do - you spent more money, so I don't think they're asking for you to do anything else for them.

So in the few chains I visit, it seems like there are always people whose entire job is just to keep getting the carts back into the front of the store.  And sure, everyone could make it a little easier for them, but why?  I mean, it's not really the responsibility of the customer to make sure their store is clean and tidy.  I actually DO return my carts, but I also stack my dishes at a restaurant and wipe down the table with a napkin too.  I figure it saves them a little effort, but it's sure as hell not my job.

So I guess as I write this, maybe I DONT understand the complaint.  Is the complaint that the next person to enter the parking lot might have to drive a space or two further because a cart is in the better spot?  ...or is it that they're trying to help out the people who inevitably go around bringing all of the carts in?

I spend a fair bit of time in both Nepal and Bhutan.  I've traveled all across Bhutan, but have mostly focused on the Solukhumbu Region of Nepal (and of course the greater KTM area).  I am going to assume you're familiar with the very strict and rigid rules for tourism in Bhutan (the daily fees, the required guides, and etc)?  While I support Bhutan doing anything it feels is in its interest, my personal opinion is that it is not a good system.  It restricts tourism to especially wealthy travelers (often who are much older) and almost has the feeling as if one is being babysat by their guide while in the country.  It's beautiful, but it's ridiculously restrictive IMO.  Because of this, I generally much prefer to spend my time in Nepal instead of Bhutan; I wish I felt as if I could travel both equally.

On the other hand, Nepal has been taking a lot of criticism for their tourism industry as of late.  Granted most of this is focused on Everest trekkers, but it seems to be widening into other arenas. The criticisms have focused on unsafe practices, deaths, trash and debris, and other unpleasantries.  I have no interest in hiking Mt. Everest, but I do love hiking in the Solukhumbu Region and it's unfortunate to me that its getting this reputation (I was actually just back in Nepal in October and November).

Do you have any thoughts comparing and contrasting the approaches from both countries?  Do you like what Bhutan is doing with their strict tourism rules?  Do you think this is something Nepal should strive for?  Do you think the rules they have imposed are (a) fair to tourists and (b) fair to locals who might otherwise benefit from engaging in tourism themselves, but essentially cannot?  What direction, at all, do you think Nepal should go in to address some of the wider criticisms?  Is there perhaps a happy middle ground between the Nepali tourist industry and the Bhutanese tourist industry that perhaps both countries should shoot for?

Thanks in advance for any answers!"

Plus if you're Canadian then ""I'm sorry"" is just the lingua franca.  As a side note, I've traveled pretty extensively through almost every province and even flew to Calgary to watch The Hip's farewell tour.  So I do really love Canada. 

But I'm pretty certain me missing a single word made the post confusing.  The entire thread is about population and everyone else who responded (which there were quite a few) seemed to get it.  Plus, the ""size"" reference I wrote about the statistic not being surprising was this:

\>There are almost 8 billion people on the planet. The countries that natively speak English aren't especially large.

So I think population was pretty solidly implied there.  Also, and in defense of feelings being hurt, you literally opened up your first reply to me with ""uhh"" - suggesting that I'M unaware of the data or something.  Specifically you wrote:

\>Uhh the second and third largest countries in the world speak English. Dunno where you got the idea that native English speaking countries are small

So to be fair, I entirely gave you the benefit of the doubt and assumed that you must be talking about India.  I had the impression for a long time that a reasonable number of Indians speak English; many of my friends held that belief too.  It turns out to be entirely not true (statistically speaking anyways).

So then you corrected me and told me that India had nothing to do with it and you were referring to Canada, which again I cherish as a culture, but it has a pretty paltry population - especially for the geography of it.  But if at any point in this discussion you honestly thought that I was referencing geographical size for some reason, then I'm really sorry, but as I noted above, every other person who responded to the thread understood clearly that I was referring to population.  I would imagine they understood that because the entire Reddit post is about population and not geography.  So when you write this:

\>It was an honest misunderstanding but please don't treat me like I'm an idiot who misunderstood your words when you clearly left out a word that would have properly reflected what your were trying to convey. 

...I wouldn't have written anything back to it except for the fact that you yourself were suggesting that I just didn't know (or perhaps was too lazy to lookup the fact) that Canada is the 2nd largest land mass.  So I didn't really ""miss a word"" in my response.  I wrote it exactly as I meant to.  As there was only one topic being discussed, ""largest"" should have pretty clearly conveyed as largest in terms of population.

And then when I chime in you jump on me for using the word ""hot"" and later tell me you thought I was talking about temperature and that I should have specified between temperature and level of spice.  If the entire thread were about spice, then hot = spicy unless otherwise stated.  Context matters.

\>You had already realized that I wasn't arguing the point you thought originally but merely interpreted you original statement differently than you intended.

No, I didn't.  You went on to tell me how Canada and the US are the 2nd and 3rd largest land masses and both have English speakers.  So to be perfectly honest, I STILL thought you were stuck on the idea that geographical size had something to do with the conversation.  If I hadn't, I wouldn't have written that I just did a gentle head slap.

\> Just figured that since there was already one kerfuffle of understanding why not double down and misconstrue another of your statements on purpose lol.

And if you're wondering why I might have thought you were still misinterpreting it, well I guess that locks up WHY I might have thought that.

Shit just got a little looney, eh?"
todayilearned,fds1yc1,t1_fdrswoh,1578693077.0,"> Who said anything about India dude. Canada and united states are the 2nd and 3rd largest countries in the world and both have a majority English speaking population.

I just did a gentle head slap.  There was another thread in here where somebody responded similarly and I just kind of shrugged it off, but since this is actually part of a discussion I'm personally in, I'll talk it out with you.

You realize that the original question is talking about the NUMBER of people who speak English, right?  Therefore the geographical size of a nation has absolutely, 100%, NOTHING to do with this conversation.  The country is ONLY relevant at all because it houses certain customs - like the language most commonly learned/spoken.  And with that, the population of the country is what is relevant which is why I wrote the original comment that I wrote.

Yes, Canada is a huge country - geographically - who cares?  It only has 38 million people.  The three largest countries in the realm of population are China, India, and the USA.  That being said, America only has about 4.5% of the world's population whereas China and India collectively have 36% of the world's population.  An absolutely massive difference.

There are almost 8 billion people in the world.  Right off the bat 36% of them do NOT learn English as their native language.  They do, however, have educated people who learn English as a second language.  But JUST from those two countries we have a really huge chunk of the world's population that would learn English as a second language - not natively.

So in my head I was factoring the obvious countries that natively learn English as a first language.  Those countries are: the USA, the UK, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and about a dozen small island nations.  As a side note, some percentage of Canadians and South Africans don't even learn English as their first language, but we'll just ignore that.

Those populations are roughly (and respectively): 330m, 67m, 58m,  37m, 25m, 5m, and let's generously give 5m to those island nations.  That's about 527 million people in total - or not even 7% of the world's population.

So hopefully you can see that when only about 7% of the world natively learns English and yet the majority of the world's educated population learns English as a secondary language, it's pretty obvious to assume that way more people would learn English as a second language than would natively speak it.

*Edit: after going through that exercise, I searched Google and discovered that it's actually even way less than I calculated above.  I was using each country's entire population (which I knew offhand would be high, but it's much lower than I even calculated).  According to Babbel, only about 360 million people on the planet natively speak English.  So yea, it's a very small percentage of the world.  They go on to say that about 1.5 billion speak English.  So as you can see, it's not even close which is why I said in the first place that it's a pretty obvious statistic.

So yea, pushing 8bil."
todayilearned,fdrb4jf,t1_fdqdvaf,1578682008.0,"Yea, that's not true at all.  I kind of want to make fun of you, but if I'm being super honest, I thought a little differently too until I actually traveled across India and realized I could talk with almost NOBODY.  So yea, I realize you think that because telemarketers, and customer service companies, and television in general has led you to believe that Indians speak English, but only about 10% of the country has actually even learned English.  You can look that up real quick, but I assure you it's correct.

But moreover, and much more to the point of the OP, it's certainly not their native language.  They might learn English in addition to Hindi or Bengali or whatever, but Wiki shows that only 0.02% of the population (or about 250,000 Indians) learn English natively.  So, even with that 10% that does know English, it's not their first language.

Here's some data for you: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages\_of\_India#2011\_Census\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India#2011_Census_India)"
todayilearned,fdq68kt,t1_fdpzscy,1578656673.0,"That's true, but US comprises about 4.5% of the world's population and the next two countries above the US comprise a total of 36% of the world's population (about 18% each).  So.... that 8-9 fold different is pretty significant in terms of overall population."

Nothing like signing up for a job that we all know has a statistically non-zero chance of a drunk person doing something bad to your property, then picking up one of those extremely drunk people, that bad thing happening, and then just screaming at the top of your lungs.  It sucks, but hard to feel sorry for a person when that's their response."
PublicFreakout,fdpsqxh,t1_fdnmdn3,1578639031.0,"Are you serious?  Did we watch the same video?  I actually saw this video a week ago, but it didn't have the aftermath attached to it.  This is absolutely horrible.  This dude is in serious trouble.  Those aren't minor burns on him.  You can literally see layers of his skin have been charred away.  He is shaking rather violently.  Maybe you didn't read the RN post that somebody linked to up above, but I would advise reading it.  ...ideally to learn how serious this kind of thing is, but if nothing else it's still a very interesting read:
