But my healthy eating gets kind of waylaid during that time because I‚Äôm burning so many calories during that time so i know i can ‚Äúget away with it‚Äù or ‚Äúoutrun a bad diet‚Äù 40-60 miles per week is a lot of calories you can eat back 
And no i don‚Äôt have McDonald‚Äôs every other day but i do have it sometimes on the day of a long run especially the 20+ milers.  My run coach is a huge fan of Taco Bell and he has that nearly every day but you don‚Äôt see it on him because he runs like 100 miles per week. 

No need to get snarky and sarcastic, I‚Äôve done 6 NYC marathons so I‚Äôm just sharing that sometimes you can indeed outrun a bad diet. As my fellow runners say if the furnace is hot enough, it can burn anything..."

fatlogic,fezc2gv,t1_fez56f8,1579455814.0,Yeah that ‚Äú vast majority‚Äù declaration is not based on anything.
fatlogic,fezbyw6,t3_eqyzqn,1579455779.0,I don‚Äôt think this is fat logic necessarily. This is valid but doesn‚Äôt negate the idea that someone still might need to lose weight. But yeah i think many people don‚Äôt do it for the right reason.

I‚Äôm not even a beacon of health i mean marathon training burns so many calories it‚Äôs easy for my eating to get a little waylaid because i know the furnace is hot so i can eat junk food without too much consequence.

Who‚Äôs healthier ? I would say my mom because my dads diet is like a 5 year old too much candy lmao but he never eats past fullness. My mom emotionally eats in front of the tv and eats when she‚Äôs not hungry. However the content of her diet is miles healthier than my dads. We have to force my dad to touch a vegetable. 

To be fair - hypertension runs in my dads family. They‚Äôre mostly thin. I‚Äôm also thin and my blood pressure is super low inherited from my mom. For now. I‚Äôm addicted to salt so... I‚Äôm trying to watch that.
