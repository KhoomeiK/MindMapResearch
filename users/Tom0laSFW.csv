sheffield,femy2nf,t1_femuhn2,1579272570.0,"Not sure how that works given that there are multiple people living there.

sheffield,femodo5,t3_epsety,1579264633.0,One thing to be aware of for non students; if you move into a student house then you will be liable for the *full* council tax on the house despite being only one person; students are exempt but that is linked to the person not the property.

My understanding is that I should rest at least a week and then start some gentle active recovery; small light squeezing exercises for the finger moving to gentle low intensity climbing etc. Is there anything else I can do in the meantime, and does anyone have any suggestions for general strength training I can do which won't stress my fingers? I get most of my exercise from climbing so I don't wanna just turn into a potato while I recover. So far I've got push ups on my fists but not much else in terms of resistance training?"
sex,fejn0ua,t3_epitv4,1579180363.0,"It *can* help to familiarise yourself with them away from sex. Like, if you have bad associations with them then you can slowly wear them down and replace them with positive ones, but it's tough when you only try that during sex, as its easy to just keep building up the negative associations. My suggestions are: 
1: find an appropriately sized condom. Buy a bunch of sizes and try them all on. I'm pretty average, but I found larger ones much more comfortable for me. It might take some experimentation but it's worth it if it means you can have sex! Shape is just as important as size; some brands are just shaped narrower or wider or w/e. I liked magnums fwiw
2: Practice with them *away* from sex; when you jerk off, do it with a condom on. It's hassle and a bit wierd but you *can* get used to wearing them, and if you're on your own time just taking it easy, it doesn't *matter* if your erection goes away. Take your time, get nice and turned on, get hard and then put the condom on and carry on. Try not to pressure yourself because what you're trying to do is build positive associations and avoid the negative ones, so stressing about it isn't really going to help. Find your favourite porn, get really worked up and go from there. If you go soft, just relax and maybe try again in a bit. 
3: Cock rings really help too, just normal squishy silicone ones will do, something with a bit of thickness so it squeezes you properly. Do try this out in general but it's probably going to be more effective after you've done steps 1 and 2. 

Edit: oh, and the advice to put some lube *inside* the condom is good advice too

I know it's tough dude I struggle with them too. You can make it better though so don't be disheartened. Good luck. Also the obligatory comment of, can you do other stuff aside from PIV that satisfies you both? You could use this time to both get really good at oral, for example, or you could get a sleeve like a Fleshlight or something and have her use that on you, which can be super hot. Whatever you do I hope you have some fun experiences"

There's the wider point of things like CPI not really being representative of price increases in the real economy too, as well as increasing pension ages etc.

I guess my general point is that I would ideally not be solely reliant for my retirement on anything that's linked to pension law or financial instruments or measures out of my direct control; sure a large part of my retirement will be this way but I'd prefer to have a healthy S&S ISA in addition, as opposed to say chucking my spare cash in a SIPP.

Fitness,fc2njy5,t1_fc2m0v1,1577368222.0,"Brosplit is your typical weekly routine that looks something like ‚Äúchest & tris, back & bis, leg day, shoulders, core‚Äù or something. I.e. doing a certain set of muscle groups per workout, working them to death and then resting them for a week. The newer consensus appears to be that it‚Äôs probably more effective to increase workout frequency while lowering the overall intensity per workout, for a given muscle group. It‚Äôs my understanding that for the first six months or so, most people make decent progress doing a three times a week full body workout with some big compound lifts for all the major muscle groups. After six months or so of consistent effort a lot of people can continue to progress to an upper body / lower body split, or maybe a ‚Äúpush, pull, legs‚Äù split. The difference compared to the older brosplit is that even on PPL you‚Äôre hitting most groups twice a week (approximately; more like twice every 8 days in reality), whereas on brosplit you‚Äôll do each one only once per period. The difference in any given workout is that you‚Äôll be doing multiple sets of big compound lifts as opposed to starting with a big compound or two and then moving into targeted isolation exercises. It takes a lot out of you and you need to consider your overall energy, fitness, and recovery capacity and tailor your routine to that limit, but you get strong and fit.

Anecdotally I was in the best shape and the fittest I‚Äôve ever been when I was doing full body three times a week. My routine was pull ups, push ups, lunges, inverted rows / upright rows, overhead press and leg press. It kicked my ass and I needed lots of food and sleep to keep it up but I was strong and in great shape."
