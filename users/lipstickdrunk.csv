AmItheAsshole,ffaie0v,t3_esfxc0,1579736455.0,NTA. No way. You stuck it out when they didn‚Äôt have the funds but now that they can afford it they aren‚Äôt willing to give you even minimum wage? Sounds like they don‚Äôt have their priorities straight at all so they‚Äôre going to be right back where they started soon enough.
AmItheAsshole,ff9401d,t1_ff8qwn6,1579704298.0,"Right, there are so many people who have nothing and no one to go to when they hit hard times. OP has a roof over her head and more than a lot of other people on the world. 

If I had to move back in with my mom and got pregnant, she would *literally* kick my ass."
AmItheAsshole,ff92qk4,t1_ff91rxy,1579703404.0,"Mom is allowed to be happy for her son. She doesn‚Äôt need to walk on eggshells in her own home. If OP doesn‚Äôt like it, she can start looking for another place to live."
AmItheAsshole,ff8rfic,t1_ff6ewdw,1579693080.0,"Daughter is a grown woman with a husband and child, living under mom‚Äôs roof for four years now...mom is the farthest thing from TA!"
AmItheAsshole,ff8rczd,t1_ff6cnjs,1579692989.0,She‚Äôs a grown woman with a family living in her mom‚Äôs house. Her mom doesn‚Äôt need to take a step back in her own home.
AmItheAsshole,ff8r3t2,t1_ff85njh,1579692664.0,"This. I get that fertility issues make it less likely for it to happen but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs entirely impossible. If I was living in my mom‚Äôs basement dealing with financial fallout, I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt be cavalier about birth control. I get wanting kids but taking a break until life is back on track won‚Äôt be the end of the world. Seems pretty selfish of OP not to be mindful of that."
Makeup,ff7k6op,t1_ff79d1o,1579651483.0,"Sephora: it‚Äôs fine if our customers get herpes, just don‚Äôt embarrass them"
Makeup,ff7jwn8,t3_erwffy,1579651291.0,"All I can say is YUCK and this is why the only testing I do is like a teeny tiny drop of foundation/face makeup so I can tell if it matches my skin tone. If there‚Äôs a palette you can test, I don‚Äôt put it on my eyes. I might put it on my hand to look at it but I don‚Äôt want any germs in my eyes. Who knows how many people have touched those and what they touched before then? Lip products are completely out of the question. I‚Äôd rather take a chance and hate how a color looks on me than to catch herpes. 

I don‚Äôt think Sephora should have test products besides things like fragrance or nail polish. Or, like mentioned, the employees hang on to samples and are able to distribute them without people contaminating them. People are super gross."
AmItheAsshole,ff7ijhk,t3_erxd7g,1579650364.0,"YTA- dispatchers usually have to follow a certain script and questions when receiving calls. They don‚Äôt just dispatch someone without any information. The police are the ones who can help in this instance anyway, not emergency services."
AmItheAsshole,ff7hj5x,t3_erx09x,1579649690.0,"YTA- I totally get feeling jealous and bummed that life sort of took a crappy turn, but expecting your mom to tiptoe around the subject of your brother is pretty lame. It‚Äôs not his fault that your life went the way it did, nor is it your mom‚Äôs or brother‚Äôs. He‚Äôs her child too and she‚Äôs happy for him. Let her be. I‚Äôm not trying to place blame on you, but you say you tried for a child for a few years and the timing seems like you were actively trying during the period of joblessness and living with your parents? I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôd want a child in the midst of that. You could have stopped unprotected sex and taken a break. That‚Äôs entirely on you. Stop focusing so much of your energy on your brother‚Äôs life and focus more on yours. There are people *way* worse off than you and I really think you should try to be grateful for what you do have instead of focusing on what you don‚Äôt.

Edit to add: people are saying mom is TA here for not respecting feelings but it‚Äôs *her* home. OP has been living under her parents roof with a husband for four years, and added a child to the mix two years ago, but mom is the villain because she thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous she has to stay quiet about her son that she‚Äôs proud of?"

I don‚Äôt know if they were on drugs or what, but it was 3 am and someone screamed so loud I *literally* thought someone was being murdered. Like butcher knife horror movie murdered. Woke me up out of a dead sleep. I ran outside and this girl is walking down the sidewalk screaming for someone to call 911 so I do. All the way at my house I can hear this guy inside smashing dishes and just going totally crazy. Her friend shows up and she says he tried to kill her, he choked her, beat her up, etc. so I call 911 back because I‚Äôm thinking this guy is dangerous and her life is in jeopardy. The cops come, she gets in the car with her friend and leaves, cops drive away and literally nothing happened."

B. Society doesn‚Äôt really give ‚Äúendless‚Äù support to rape victims. We have rapists that end up with a slap on the wrist and probation, which is not a suitable punishment for a violent sexual crime. 

C. I agree that sexual assault of men needs to be taken way more seriously than it is. Men can and do get raped and need help and resources, not mockery."

thisisus,feljqad,t1_fehmjuy,1579223831.0,Do you remember a while back when Malik was talking to that kinda shady guy at the garage like he wanted to get into some sort of unsavory business? I wonder if the intruder is tied to that at all. I mean Malik *and* his parents both know where Randall and the family lives. And Malik‚Äôs mom had it out for Deja and Beth.
antiMLM,feldqsk,t1_fel8h0t,1579219783.0,Honestly? I think the pitches and ‚Äúpromises‚Äù of this great income sound so good to people that they ignore common sense. MLMs like to prey on people and play into their deepest desires.

antiMLM,fejldlj,t3_epbt9o,1579178819.0,"Taking back my sentiments to OP. This looks like something that has been shared a bunch, the date doesn‚Äôt add up,  and the cavalier attitude towards everyone‚Äôs sincere condolences and concern is really telling. 

I lost both my parents to cancer. It was long and excruciating. Watching them waste away from chemo, going through painful surgeries, being sick and scared. To use that pain for some fucking karma and gems is reprehensible."
antiMLM,fejl2v9,t1_fejjwjz,1579178523.0,"I thought it was fishy that they were asking for Reddit ‚Äúgems‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt want to assume anything.

antiMLM,feiz295,t1_feipzpk,1579151273.0,Seriously I was thinking the same. MLM just needs to be criminal. All it does is dupe people out of money and turn them into opportunistic vultures like this character.

antiMLM,fe98py4,t1_fe981a5,1578935414.0,Agree to disagree. Ethics and medicine go hand in hand and any physician that would approve shilling snake oils to vulnerable patients goes against their oath to care for the sick.
