They make more just from maintaining the prison than from the slavery. So the slavery isn't really a big deal, because it's not as profitable.

Now, some medications have lethal side effects, it happens. But at least as a physician you can say the drug has been thoroughly tested, and was given in as safe a manner as possible. Not so here. I'd argue it's unethical to give untested medications regardless of the disease process. There is such a thing as 'compassionate use', but this doesn't fall under that, likely."

OverwatchUniversity,fekuszg,t1_fekn2xn,1579208041.0,"I'm actually saying that having someone instalock and not communicate is worse when it's ball than with any other tank.

I truly would rather have a less mechanically skilled tank that at least attempts to work with the team, rather than someone who ""can do everything they need to do without support from the team""."
OverwatchUniversity,feknsdm,t1_fekn1x0,1579203899.0,"See you keep saying the same thing, that you can play ball without your team. That seems to be the exact mindset that's the issue. You can play effectively without your team. That doesn't mean that you are being effective within the context of the game.

And I'm not flaming balls in my matches, I'm talking about people complaining here on Reddit. I ask balls to switch when it's not working with the team, I also ask other roles to switch if I see a need, and I switch myself if what I'm doing isn't working. I don't flame people for playing a specific hero."
OverwatchUniversity,fekddus,t1_fek1zas,1579197696.0,"Sombra Orisa combo requires two people to coordinate. Ball requires the entire team to coordinate to be effective. I can agree that making the enemies use their cooldowns is a good way to make space, and distracting the enemy is useful, and causing chaos creates space, but you seem to be missing the point. Just like most ball players I see at low ranks.

Ball can play the game perfectly at low ranks, and he's still the wrong choice of tank.

If your team is not effective at using the space ball creates, then he is ineffective, even if played perfectly. It is easier to get your team to follow a front line into a team fight, than to know that a ball is diving their back line, and to use that chaos to their advantage.

Some teams will use it, some won't. You still fall into the trap of thinking that if you play ball effectively, the team should be able to step it up. You're saying if the team has gamesense, ball should work great. You're right. Unfortunately , it's rare to have a team at Plat and lower with good gamesense and the ability to coordinate.

Me asking a ball to go something that works with the team is far different than a ball asking the rest of the team to follow him in, you see that, right? And you talk about how much balls don't to rely on their team at the same time. It really doesn't work that way.

Eventually your argument ends up at an unhelpful place, ""what if he's a one trick, what if he can't play anything else?"" Well sucks for everybody to deal with one tricks that aren't effective at the level they're playing at. ""Maybe they just want to play ball."" Sure, but I'm not arguing against people who just want to play what they play, I'm arguing against balls who think they doing great, but get mad when people think they aren't helping. They remind me of moiras bragging about gold medals. Maybe, despite 'feeling' effective, you aren't playing in a way that works with your team.

Playing with balls who instalock and don't communicate and don't switch when it isn't working is frustrating, and is very common in gold. And it is generally more frustrating than having a bad tank that plays with the team. I'd honestly rather have a new tank player who isn't that good but plays with the team, than a good ball that feels like they can carry alone without support."
OverwatchUniversity,fei3m6v,t1_fehv8z0,1579129539.0,"I think you're wrong about it not requiring more coordination than other combos. I also think that you misinterpret what I'm saying, I know to engage when ball engages (not follow him, follow his lead), I know what creating space is, I just also know that the team is less likely to use that space at lower ranks.

You guys keep saying things like, yea the enemy chase's me around all the time. Which is great, I'm sure that why you win some. But many games the enemy is playing more or less together, and shooting the ball as he goes through, and the ball leaves fairly quickly, the rest of the team heals up and faces front again. I don't care how many times you do that as ball, unless the team follows it up, it's just feeding ult.

No doubt ball can be a force of destruction and chaos. But I think ball's just overestimate their usefulness at lower ranks. ""They chased me for a full minute"" isn't the same as being effective regardless of whether you think it should be or not. How many times have you gotten a huge grav or shatter and thought, ""that should be a team fight win"", but it isn't, because your team didn't take advantage. It happens all the time. And those are far easier to follow up on than balls slamming and running away.

9 out of 10 times i see ball tanks, they don't die much, but they feed ult and get a pick or two, that doesn't effect any real change in the game. Balls at low ranks with low coordination are the same as flanking hogs in my experience.

You say players just need game sense. And you're probably right. But instead of playing a tank where the whole rest of team has to get better to be able to play with you effectively, why not play something simpler that works with the rest of your team. That's my problem with the ball mindset. ""If everyone on my team was better at this game, it would work great"". Doesn't Jayne have a thing about picking what helps the rest of your team perform to their fullest?"
OverwatchUniversity,fehzzf4,t1_fehk0rc,1579127317.0,"I think you're underestimating the need for coordination at lower ranks. Distracting a few enemies at lower ranks means nothing if the timing isn't right. The same as pushing forward and taking space as rein. If your team doesn't follow it up, it doesn't mean much. At lower ranks, the team taking advantage of short periods of chaos in the back lines is unlikely. Way more effective to push as a unit, than to try and coordinate multiple angles of attack. It's not that the balls are ""bad"" at low ranks, but they can be very ineffective, even if they feel like they're doing everything right."
OverwatchUniversity,fehbzlr,t1_fegziqb,1579113433.0,"Fair enough, I was inarticulate. I can't play an offtank when the other tank picks ball because ball is not a front line. I'm sure that he works better at higher levels of play, but in gold, he requires 5 other players to do exactly what he is doing and they rarely communicate what they are doing.

Jumping in and distracting 3 players is great for the 3 seconds he's doing it, but if they have a shield tank, that time is likely wasted.

If I push forward to take space when the ball goes in, then I get left out on a limb after the ball loses all his health and has to run.

I'm not suggesting ball can't work, I'm just saying that at my level, ball gets instapicked, regardless of comp, never switches and never communicates. And it's impossible for me to combo with, because he really requires the whole team to coordinate with him."

Ball can be great with the right team, but usually needs the right comp and coordination to reach his potential. What I know I can count on from a ball is 5v6s and no support from my off tank. Sometimes it goes great, most of the time it doesn't. I hate having to decide what MT to be when the other guy is ball."

AdviceAnimals,fe9e9a2,t1_fe94j92,1578936787.0,"There are serious issues with both of those articles. The second, doesn't discuss over what time periods active funds outperformed index, and again this matters because because over longer periods of time, index funds outperform almost all actively managed funds. And in the first they say they looked at 15 years, but really looked at 24 separate time periods and found that index funds outperformed an average of 60% across those periods. They didn't discuss the performance over 15 years. Which S&P reports show index outperforms a very large percentage of firms. If you beat 60% of actively managed funds every year, over long periods of time as those funds do better or worse than index, index outperforms more and more actively managed funds.

That's BECAUSE actively managed funds are more volatile. They sometimes beat the index, but on average over time, don't.

Not to mention neither of those studies addressed the fact that the expense ratios of actively managed funds make them a far riskier investment than low expense ratio index funds, which is shown by the article I posted above.

I can agree that actively managed may outperform index funds in a bear market (which is different than a volatile market). This makes sense because of what an index fund is, but think about it this way. In a bear market, in which by definition the market is receding and most stocks are declining, and index fund tied to the value of all stocks still outperformed 30-40% of actively managed funds. And has a fraction of the expense ratio.

There may be people who are able to choose actively managed funds that usually outperform the index, but actively managed funds are FAR more volatile than index funds, and cost FAR more as well whether they're outperforming the index or not. The average person is wayyyyy better off with index funds.

Edit: In fact, thinking a little more, I would bet everything that actively managed funds actually outperform index in less volatile markets. In a very predictably moving bear market, actively managed funds should easily outperform index. It just rarely happens."

AdviceAnimals,fe6ob3v,t1_fe6joxo,1578897970.0," Not sure what you mean. Actively managed funds are more volatile year to year, so I'm not sure what you mean by index funds having larger standard deviation. And based on S&P  reports, the majority of actively managed funds trail behind index funds, and over longer periods of time (15 years) 92% of large cap actively managed funds trail behind index funds.

On top of all that, the difference in expense ratios puts index funds way ahead.

But my god, for a series in which gender differences and similarities play a major role in the story, the guy could not help but write all his women as petty, vain bitches.
