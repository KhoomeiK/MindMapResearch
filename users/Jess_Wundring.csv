Keep away from the dog's face and the top of its head until its comfortable with you.

Talk in a friendly voice to the dog and call it by name but don't try to pet it until its comfortable with you.

Don't stare at the dog or try to gaze into its eyes, it doesn't love you and so it might take you looking at it as a reason to fear you.

It won't be comfortable with you the first time it meets you. It'll take at the very least a second meeting and possibly a third or fourth before you should even consider touching the dog. Let it come to you and offer itself to be petted. Don't confuse sniffing to check you out and learn your smell as an offer to be petted. Let it sniff you. That's how it'll come to recognize you as you.

You can wait until you yourself are comfortable with the idea of petting it. That's fine. Start talking to it before you reach out to pet it, so that its attention is on you (you won't surprise it) and it can tell by your steady, friendly voice that you mean it no harm."
dogs,feloznz,t3_epswpl,1579227426.0,"Dogs will not show pain if they can possibly help it. My guess is that your dog is attached to you and is bewildered or in pain but gains fortitude from having you near by because she knows she's going to be okay as long as you're within touching distance. 

Oh God, I know how hard it is, but you really need to consider when it will be time to let her go. I waited too long for my Jocko because I kept moving the bar, and I hope to never repeat that mistake."
dogs,feln4v3,t1_fele4ph,1579226154.0,"If there are numerous irritants like foxtail and thorns in his environment, be glad that he's getting a nosebleed when something gets up his nose. The bleeding is what his body does to dislodge the irritant when simply flooding the cavity with mucus doesn't work. Once the irritant is gone, the bleeding stops. A long nosebleed means a stubborn irritant. As long as his nosebleeds are not a usual occurrence, visiting the vet is necessary only if you can't accept that the nosebleeds are a sign that his body is working effectively."

good doog. Oh look, a palindrome."
dogs,feeqoim,t3_eonlls,1579039170.0,"Whatever dog you get, you might consider getting it a companion. Dogs really don't like being alone, ever. With your frequent absences (since you're single and working), it will have a greater quality of life and better mental health if it has a buddy to share everything with. I mean, do you really want to be its everything and then leave it alone for so much of its life?

And don't get a puppy. It will quickly become neurotic being alone. Adult/older rescues are usually resigned to being alone much of the time but will appreciate (and even blossom) having the constant presence of a buddy as well."

2 is assistance, using or requiring teamwork."
