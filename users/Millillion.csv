We came up with the idea of species and started separating things into them a long time before we knew about evolution. The idea of definitively separate species is pretty firmly rooted in our minds, but that's just not how the world works.  

There's even some disagreement on what to call our own species due to how closely related we are to Neanderthals and Denisovans and how much our groups interbred."

How would we go about getting the cables from inside the frame of the wall to the attic space if we can't get to most of it to drill a hole? All of the guides I've seen involve being directly above the wall you're working on.  

Actually I just checked, and there's insulation between the joists as far as I can see. There's also central air ducting running between the floors, so that might slightly impact the usage of that space for running cables also.  

There's no carpet, but the baseboard idea is certainly less invasive than running cable concealers all over the place. It would probably need to be used in conjunction with cable concealers, but it's an improvement and a slight cost reduction if we can use the pre-existing baseboards."
