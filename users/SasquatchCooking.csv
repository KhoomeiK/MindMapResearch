Games,ff2jmwp,t1_fezc6pm,1579509134.0,"If you complete the game in the most empathetic way, you unlock a secret ending that allows you to see pretty much the entire game in a completely different light. I highly recommend using a 100% guide to complete the game, you'll see a lot of awesome stuff you probably missed out on.

That ending and how it affected and culminated on the transhumanism themes in the games made Prey one of my favorite games of the last few years."

If you had a dog, you'd understand this wonderful animal is just playing and having a good time."
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff2hvf2,t1_ff2hlgf,1579506821.0,"Absolutely not. There are so many immoral laws. Legality and morality have nothing to do with each other, never have, and never will. Slavery was legal, and I shouldn't need to go on."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feungxj,t1_fetgt4a,1579388243.0,Where did I say that I hate dogs?
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fet9btd,t1_feo43lu,1579372919.0,"There is no degrading happening. Dogs are just dumb. In fact, by pretending they can speak like a human, the exact opposite of degradation is occuring."
Deltarune,fet381v,t1_fes7csi,1579371367.0,You dont have to interact with the fanbase at all to enjoy the game
unpopularopinion,feo1i2u,t1_fenjerd,1579293850.0,"No. I don't think ignoring homeless people is the solution to homelessness. There is enough untaxed wealth sitting in offshore accounts at this moment to provide for every single homeless American.

The ""owners"" of that wealth will literally never have the time to use it in their lifetimes, even if they started blowing $1,000,000 a day right now.

The issue is not that too many people are giving to the homeless. The problem is that the wrong people are giving to the homeless."

worldpolitics,feheq1v,t1_fegn272,1579115015.0,"I agree. Just because abortion is illegal in some places doesnt mean women shouldn't be getting them anyway.

The more fetuses we kill the better. The lizard left needs harvested baby organs to survive.

I get my girlfriend pregnant every month and eat the remains after a week. It's our little version of date night :)"

LifeProTips,fdtho1f,t1_fdtgai7,1578716904.0,"You clearly missed the part where the cat lost 3 pounds because it wasnt eating, and this was the only way to fix the problem. Do you realize that's the equivalent of near 100lbs of weight loss on a human? 

You should shut up, and probably not own pets."
