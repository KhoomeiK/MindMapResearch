facepalm,ffepnne,t3_esxmjb,1579859177.0,How was this halfwit ever a DA or judge?  Also wasn't she one of those talking heads during the OJ saga basically saying he was the killer etc.
soccer,ff8hue9,t1_ff7izym,1579679161.0,"Oh no question ginger Kev is miles better, it just I mentioned my missing comment about Ozil wasn't a joke, but going by the media you'd think he was the worst player ever."
soccer,ff7hly1,t3_es15ur,1579649741.0,"I know De Bruyne has this record and the quickest to reach 50 assists, but doesn't Ozil still have the higher amount of career assists overall by quite a bit, I know he's older, still that's pretty decent considering he's been missing for a couple of years."
ACMilan,ff7glux,t3_erw9tl,1579649079.0,That's a bit of a left field move.
politics,ff7gboy,t3_erx2bg,1579648894.0,"I can't believe the nerve of this woman, after she ""won"" the nomination he went out to bat for her on numerous occasions, even though she was so toxic to some people.  

Now we finally have a chance to right a wrong and somehow her petty mentality towards someone who is slightly left of centre means he'll be out on his own against the GOP, at least they no matter how much they hate each other back their man."
todayilearned,ff7ebmd,t3_ery2yg,1579647576.0,"Yeah there's misscarriage's of justice but don't worry capital punishment is a great deterrent, not, what's a few dead innocents if we can murder the murderer's, because that's what it's about, this ancient eye for an eye nonsense masquerading as justice."
facepalm,fe76ta1,t3_env2nj,1578910752.0,"That's not the first time I saw that, if I remember rightly we were 3rd year Uni getting taught this new fangled language called Java after doing tonnes of C++.  

Anyway after seeing an ad for a job asking for a 6 year experience in said language we were about to moan at our lecturer saying this ain't new, til he pointed out it was only released in '96 this was '99 btw so the only folk who would have 6+ years experience of it was the inventor of Java."

JusticeServed,fe6y4vl,t3_enqyv8,1578907669.0,"Justice somewhat served as all he lost was his eyebrows, as he is supposedly ill so went to a mental hospital instead of jail.  

Should've said he voted Labour or some Muslim stereotype."
ACMilan,fdl9mic,t3_elr7mz,1578519396.0,"I'm sorry but where the fek was Armani when Silvio was selling up, but now he's interested because a rival is too, we could've saved ourselves a lot of mediocre football this last decade.

Come on m8 you're 85 with no kids, you'll probably pop your clogs before the deal is done, I'll take Arnault everyday of the week over him as Armani may be rich but Arnault has fuck you money."
