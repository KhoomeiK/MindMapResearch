AskWomenOver30,ff5i8yb,t3_ernhkt,1579594087.0,I know this suggestion is laughed at.. but hot yoga has saved my life. I also cope with acute anxiety by dropping everything I’m doing and taking a long hot shower.
bipolar,ff5b6d6,t3_ero5eq,1579585898.0,This isn’t even an exaggeration.

BipolarReddit,fem5dsi,t3_eptyid,1579240346.0,Risperidone messed me up. It made me suicidal for two months. Worst time of my life. I am terrified of going back to that head space again.
AskWomenOver30,fej114t,t3_epd7bj,1579153059.0,Get therapy. Stay far away from men.
Rateme,feimf8p,t1_fecjya3,1579141941.0,I love the darker eyebrow light hair look..
AskReddit,feifqd6,t1_fei9xnn,1579137469.0,"Same. I thought people were making them up until I was about 40 comments in and realized that people were commenting on each other’s posts about how they’ve seen the same video. 

I’ve stumbled across some Mexican cartel videos but I don’t have the heart or stomach to ever actually watch them."
AskWomenOver30,fehtuu3,t3_ep5nqj,1579123757.0,I have 3-4 semesters left in my marriage and family studies degree :) I’m 31.

bipolar,feb4opr,t1_feb1s9i,1578955365.0,Downloading it now!
bipolar,feaxsbv,t1_feahrfe,1578953315.0,Your talk of sleep is making me realize I’m not alone in this! I have also discovered that I need at least 8 hours a night - more so than a lot of people I know. It’s better when I get 9-10. It’s so important to me that I have called into work late just to make sure I hit that 8 hours. The fall out from small amounts of sleep is just not worth it. It gets really stressful when mania kicks in and you CANT sleep even though you know you need it.
bipolar,fe9ulxk,t1_fe9rgks,1578941600.0,"I’ve been wanting to lower my sugar intake. This ones a hard one, because I think I have an almost life time sugar addiction and I’m not even sure where to start. I would really like to try it and see what it does for my mental (and physical) health. Also, I know people make fun of people like me for saying this, but hot yoga. Something about sweating and exhausting my body and learning to breath etc has been SO helpful with managing my bipolar disorder."

bipolar,fe9q6aq,t1_fe9ges5,1578940459.0,"Yeah, If I consume either one of these things, I feel my mental health crumble around me. Both substances always kick me into a manic or hypomanic state. I had a Vegas trip last week and consumed alcohol for the first time in a long time. It wasn’t even that much considering I was in Vegas, but it definitely did
damage and I’m suffering consequences. I definitely recommend sobriety for all people with bipolar."
AskReddit,fe9oq1c,t1_fe92oqt,1578940077.0,I’ve driven through Camden and this was not my experience at all... it seemed totally fine. However I remember driving through neighborhoods in New Orleans that were exactly like this.
bipolar,fe8wrr7,t1_fe7c8bo,1578931930.0,I totally agree with the sleep thing. That’s my main way of combatting mania. I’m also going to make sure alcohol and coffee are not in my diet at all.
