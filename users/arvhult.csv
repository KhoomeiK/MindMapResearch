I was frustrated with my rescue's needs when we got him. I am the BF in my relationship and at first I was a little flustered at how much exercise he needed.

One thing i realized is that they don't really need to exercise their body, but more their brain.

If you both work during the day, it would be good for you to find some sort of daycare solution. Your dog is still young and new to your household, and the socialization might be very important to your dog learning when to unleash his energy.  It may also make them much less reactive if they can learn from other dogs. There are people that do dog daycares by taking them outside all day every day. We have one of those now and he couldn't be happier!

TwoXChromosomes,ff9a7pq,t1_ff8ulit,1579708372.0,"you sure it's not because they can lose their serving permit? That's basically what would happen here (Sweden). Our laws are strict. If the police end up with a drunk person doing something bad or getting themselves hurt, the police will take that drunk back to where they came from to find the bartender responsible for over-serving them. By law they cannot serve someone who is already drunk basically.

I used to work at our student bar in college, and one night was particularly popular, and people were bringing in their own drinks concealed, got wasted and ended up in a big pile by the emergency exit.

It is very seldom that the authorities do rounds of those student bars, I had worked every party in that bar the last 4 or so years without any visit, but THIS was the night they decided to drop by for the first time in many years.

They came, they saw, they wrote up a warning. Consequence was basically that everyone entering any bar at the entire college campus must be a +1 guest of one student belonging to the student section managing that bar, named on a list, else we'd lose the license to serve alcohol"

reactivedogs,ff99hnw,t3_esb3ws,1579707921.0,"Our rescue barked a lot the first year or so. Our local dog daycares advised using those non-hurting collars that make a sound and a light vibration, to startle him when he barked. We tried for a couple of months but I cannot tell if it worked but I assume it did not work very well, he kinda seemed to be more anxious when wearing it. Then we turned to just doing the hard training. We've had him for soon 2 years and he barks much less now, we've mostly trained him to point and notify us instead of barking at things, or seek eye contact with us. He still barks on occasion, but we can't completely avoid that.  


Try filming the dog while you leave the house to see how he behaves, we had the same concern and realized he does absolutely nothing when we're not at home - YOU are the reason they bark after all, to warn you, so if you're not at home the chance is pretty large that he's not barking.  


Whenever he barks at our door I walk over there and look outside and then tell him that the danger is gone."

DnD,ff8mfkp,t1_ff89z7r,1579685787.0,"I was hoping there was some backstory to the name Nail.  


My wood elf ranger is named Ditch. Illegitimately born, his parents cared little for him so they dumped him in a ditch to be picked up by a band of roving goblins. He was raised by them and learned much about living in nature, and most about tracking humanoids, but he was poorly raised by those goblins with much beating, so they became is preferred enemy. He was used for thievery due to his dark complex and nimbleness, so he learned dexterity. He also learned how to brew goblin liquor and became an alcoholic early in life. In his teens when his foster parents died of old age he found himself yet again in a ditch, passed out drunk on goblin booze. There he was picked up by traveling craftsmen, who got good use of him in Neverwinter as a woodcarver with his dextrous hands.  


He is incredibly unintelligent, and elves hate him because of it, but also because his rough goblin accent. Due to all abuse he is afraid of authority and father figures, and he doesn't hesitate to kill any goblin he chances upon with his longbow."
