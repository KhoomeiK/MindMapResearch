dogs,fdq5dei,t3_emoezg,1578655588.0,"I'd start a bland diet if you haven't already. Boiled chicken or boiled hamburger with white rice. Do that for the next few days until the stool is back to normal. Then gradually work her regular food back in over a few days. 

It wouldn't hurt to drop off a fecal sample at your vet's office if you haven't recently just to make sure she doesn't have any lingering fecal parasites from puppyhood. 

Definitely bring her to be seen if the diarrhea is getting worse or doesn't improve with the bland diet; if she becomes lethargic, her appetite decreases, she begins vomiting, or you see blood."

We can't possibly know more than your vet if your dog is fit for anesthesia right now.

Every cardiologist I've spoken to regarding this is in agreement with the findings, and many veterinarians have been saying for years to stay away from ""fad"" ""boutique"" diets for pets. Grain allergies are incredibly rare in dogs. The need for these diets was solely from people hearing buzzwords and deciding that it's somehow healthy. I don't think we'll see the full scope of this for years. I see a new dog diagnosed almost every day. 

Anyway, get an echocardiogram done and you'll know for sure the state of your dog's heart right now, and whether or not you need to be worried."

I don't know this pet. I don't have the medical history or labwork or anything. But if she's wasting away and not eating despite being treated to the best of the vet's ability, it's likely time to think about what's best for the dog. And that may be euthanasia."

Fair warning - they're expensive, too. BUT at first you give them monthly, and then ideally you can wean them down to every 6-8 weeks or even longer depending on how they do. They work really well, so it's really worth a shot.

Have you done allergy testing? I usually don't recommend them because allergies are often manageable without ever knowing exactly what the trigger is - diet trials, environmental controls, etc. But if you're doing all that already, it wouldn't hurt to know if there's something causing it that you can control. 

Final recommendation - a consult with a dermatologist (maybe prioritize this before going through allergy testing). They have a lot of tricks up their sleeves for skin issues. You might be surprised at some solutions available that your vet hasn't thought of."

Yes :) I'm assuming his scar is on his penis, not his scrotum. So, you're feeling a lump on his penis, correct? That's not where testicles go. It's likely his bulbourtethral gland ( [https://www.arlnow.com/2018/03/08/healthy-paws-boy-dog-bumps-the-mysterious-bulbus-glandis/](https://www.arlnow.com/2018/03/08/healthy-paws-boy-dog-bumps-the-mysterious-bulbus-glandis/) ) if that's where you're referring to. 

If there is a lump or swelling on his actual scrotum where his testicles used to be, he should be checked out at his vet. A  common complication after a neuter is for the scrotum to fill with fluid."
