DunderMifflin,ffer4ta,t1_ffdzjt0,1579861393.0,Toby is the real Scranton strangler.
DunderMifflin,ffer47o,t1_ffe7r9i,1579861370.0,"I have a working theory that the reason George Howard Scub tried to strangle Toby, is because when Toby went to visit him in prison, Toby actually secretly confessed that HE was the real scranton strangler and that he had set Scub up, got on the jury to poison the other jurors and Scub, who was clearly not all there in the brain- snapped during Toby's confession and tried to kill him for ruining his life. This was Toby's plan all along. Now no one would ever think he was the real Scranton Strangler."

relationship_advice,ff5mwel,t3_erod4b,1579600883.0,"Hey OP. I was just left for almost all of these reasons after a 9 year relationship. When he finally pulled the trigger, I was shocked and devastated. BUT. It helped me to grow up finally (Im 37F). I was so used to be taken care of, I kind of had given up. Now, after 4 months, I've lost weight, gotten into a rewarding career, gotten promoted 3 times, finished my degree, got my own apartment and just feel as a whole a lot better. You need to do what makes you happy, and even tho it will be really hard on you both- breaking up will most likely be for the best. You guys are both still young and have plenty of time to sort life out. I wish my ex had spoken to me more about the things that were bothering him as I had no idea, I like to think I would have started making some moves sooner but it is what it is. He's been struggling since our split with guilt and finally started going to therapy. Like I said, it will be hard for you both. Good luck OP."

I am from a north east town known for our trash mouths and outside of work I use ""adult words"" in almost every sentence (as does every other adult I know). The kids in my class are pretty good about swear words but every now and then we get a ""shit"" or a ""fuck"" and one 4 year old told me I was a ""cock smuggling gremlin"" which was pretty hard to not laugh at. he also could have said cock guzzling gremlin.. but I didn't ask him to clarify.

A customer tried to return a 5 year old broken and heavily used and very expensive air compressor with no receipt, no proof of purchase, no item number (we hadn’t even carried the brand for 4 years). I told him he could not return it. He called me a cunt, tried to punch me, and demanded to see the manager who told him the same thing as I had.

Your dad knows you love him. He knew it this morning and will always know. It’s so easy to sit and say, try not to worry when you don’t know yet but just try to think positive. Good luck to you and your family."

DunderMifflin,fe7ex4o,t1_fe7eask,1578913673.0,"I agree Pam and Jim should have had smaller problems all along. When I watched it live, I was so confused and upset with both Pam and Jim’s behavior tho now with time and having rewatched it so many times I get what the show was trying to do- it just feels so unnatural and forced."
DunderMifflin,fe78x22,t3_eo1n4z,1578911599.0,"I agree with you for the most part. I love season 8 and while Michael being gone is a huge void in the show, Robert California, Andy and Dwight still make season 8 awesome. Season 9- what they did to Andy’s character was almost unforgivable. However- the last 2 episodes of the season bring it back full circle and it ends perfectly. 

Brian, the boom guy was a throw away plot, however- Pam and Jim’s relationship does kind of get annoying after a while and it was nice to see them having real problems. Jim, Pam, And Andy all act out of character in season 9. Jim really does become an asshole. Pam does too and Andy is like king asshole of asshole kingdom. I rewatch the office often- but struggle to get through most of season 9 every time. I admit I sometimes skip episodes just to get to the finale."
