If yours speaking of London in particular then you have to realise that the train  to mainland europe (which I take regularly) is very quick and convenient.

Ancient astronomers would not likely have bundled the sun and the moon into the same category of object as the stars. We know because the tracking of sun and moon cycles feature on ancient calendars, whereas the the movement of the planets are recorded in far more subtle and less immediately useful ways. The position of the sun in the sky can tell you the time of day and the time of year. The position of the moon can tell you the tides. These are important enough to base an entire time convention on. The 7 heavenly objects are a coincidence still fixated upon as late as the 16th century."
