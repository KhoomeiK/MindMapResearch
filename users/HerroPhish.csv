I have 2 fucked up toes myself from breaking them in high school than deciding I could play a full season of football by just taping them until I couldn’t feel the pain.

tretinoin,ffbh3ib,t3_esm2qu,1579765007.0,"I was about to post a thread with this.

Been using Tret for like 8 months now. I would cleanse only at night. My skin just wasn’t doing so well. I was still breaking out and I was getting frustrated and wanted to quit Tret.

I stopped cleansing. I wash my face with water morning and evening. Morning I just moisturize and put on sunscreen. Night I was with water, moisturize, wait 15 min and put on Tret. 1 day a week I use azaelic acid as it helps get off all the dead skin and exfoliated my skin really nicely (my skin loved azaelic acid. My skin is looking amazing. I haven’t gotten any new acne and my face doesn’t feel dry at all. It actually feels well balanced. I think just letting the Tret do its work is key and not over drying your skin."
tretinoin,ffbgynn,t1_ffaz5zj,1579764839.0,Same. I only get acne outside my beard areas. My beard is really dense so I can’t get the Tret through to it. I just do every part outside of it.

PublicFreakout,ffabirt,t1_ffa469j,1579731669.0,"And What I meant on the companion for years comment, is it’s not so crazy to think that people buy specific dogs with a specific temperament when talking about a pet that will be living with you for years. It’s not a small decision to make."
PublicFreakout,ffa9pt4,t1_ffa469j,1579730628.0,"So it depends. And I am not against getting a dog from a shelter at all. I have my own issues with pitbulls, but that’s neither here nor there.  

Honestly for my next dog I will probably get a greyhound. Or adopt an older dog depending on what’s out there. Puppies kinda suck and they were a lot of energy. 

Here’s the thing for me, and I’ll lay it out on why I bought a dog from a breeder. I’m 28, single, active, and I live in a highly dog populated area. My apartment complex has its own dog park. I can bring my dog to work. I am slightly allergic to dog’s and I was never bothered by dogs with hair instead of fur. Putting all this together I came fo the conclusion that a standard poodle would fit me well. Having the dog as a puppy would give me the opportunity to socialize the dog with other dogs, bring the dog to work w me so it got used to it. It felt like a safer option. Rescue dogs can come with their own issues and I didn’t know if I had the time or energy to really deal with that. 

Don’t get me wrong, my dog is not perfect. She’s an amazing dog and is totally used to my schedule nowadays. She loves dog parks and playing with dogs. She’s just a good companion. Very even tempered like her parents were and she’s just fun to be around. I took her on a hike this past weekends, we walked 45 minutes to the beach. She’s kind of exactly what I wanted in a dog. She can hangout when I need her to, be very active when I need. She is a little vocal in my apartment which can be very annoying sometimes but she’s quieted a ton in the last 2 months, she’s still very young. Overall though she’s very well behaved. Most people are shocked when I tell them she’s like 10 months old. 

I don’t believe that getting dogs from reputable breeders puts another dog in a shelter. There are tons of shady breeders out there that have bad practices that can definitely lead to more dogs in shelters. But breeders doing the right thing leads to dogs going to good homes. 

No matter what getting a dog is a risk, you don’t know what the dog will be like as it gets older. Rescuing a dog can be a beautiful, fulfilling thing - but it just seemed to be more risky and I didn’t want to do that. 

All I’m saying is people spend money on dogs for a reason and it could be that they wanted a specific dog. And if they went through the right channels and breeder for that dog, that is totally not a bad thing,"
PublicFreakout,ff9xxvt,t1_ff9okac,1579723908.0,"Honestly, there are many many reasons why people do this. 

I’ll name a few. Getting a dog that fits your needs. Meaning a breed of dog that works well with your lifestyle. Getting a dog as a puppy also allows you to socialize the dog how you want to. Also, genetics. You meet the parents of the dog and they’re well behaved and don’t have mental or physical issues. This gives you a higher chance that your dog will mature into a good adult dog. 

I have no issues if people are buying dogs from reputable breeders. It’s a companion you will have for years."
PublicFreakout,ff9xirw,t3_esawu9,1579723658.0,I wonder if this is related to the DCM thing and dog food.

They allllll are very aware that pitbulls are dog aggressive and they should be managed as such. They all understand the risks and keep their dogs out of dog parks and playing with dogs. There’s no bullshit about it. I believe anyone that wants a pitbull or owns a pitbull should listen to experienced dogmen and pitbull breeders. Who knows the breed better? They were bred as fighting dogs and they should be handled as such.

They don’t downplay their genetics. If people just respected pitbulls like these people I honestly don’t really have an issue with them.

dogs,fef2ft7,t3_eomdyx,1579046591.0,"So reading your ideal dog thing - it describes my poodle with 1 caveat. Only thing is, she can be vocal. She’s never vocal outside of my apartment. She literally just doesn’t bark in public ever. But inside, she can get vocal. She’s aloof with strangers, doesn’t really care for them. If she gets to know you she loves you if you’re nice to her. Some people can be overbearing and she seems to remember who is. 

She’s always up for long walks and adventures. Athletic as fuck. Loves other dogs and is extremely dog friendly. Very lovable and for sure velcro to me. She follows me everywhere including the bathroom.  She’s also super goofy and lovable to me. My spoo is going to be 50lbs fully grown which I like. Some spoos are like 65-70 so you have to make sure the line is more on the average size.

I definitely think with the right breeder you can get a poodle who would love sports and stuff. Mine currently loves playing and I bet she would enjoy agility which I have to try with her when I get some money together."

They’re possibly prone to dog/animal aggression, this is a fact you should research more into this to see if you’re okay with that. Huskys can be a lot. Belgium Malinois are way too much dog for me. After watching videos on them and stuff I think I would lose my mind with a dog with that much energy personally. It seems like a very serious commitment. 

I wanted a medium/large dog that was energetic and something I can take anywhere. I didn’t want to deal with shedding so I got a standard poodle. If I was okay with shedding I would personally 100% get a Golden retriever or a Lab. Loving dogs that are energetic and good companions. Greyhounds are awesome also and seem very low maintenance. 

My standard poodle does good in an apt. She’s 50lbs and athletic. I take her for long walks daily and I let her run in the park when I can. She’s usually very okay with that and tired by the end of the day. I believe I could get away with 3 30 minute walks a day.

It scared the shit out of me and I was walking her around today in a public area and was really cautious about the dogs she meets (I really hate and try to avoid meeting random dogs I don’t know out in public).
dogs,fdyqlbw,t3_en8fej,1578782551.0,"I think they just care about their dogs. If it’s a reputable breeder they put time and effort into your puppy and they want the dog to have a healthy/happy life. 

As long as your dog is well groomed, healthy weight, and loved, I am sure they will be happy."

BanPitBulls,fduoaer,t3_emzgbz,1578736192.0,"I think they should be banned being off leash end of story.

I also think there should be a movement pushing other breeds of dogs and euthanizing the pitbulls that are in shelters. There’s absolutely no reason pitbulls need to exist. Why is there a need for a dog that kills other dogs and humans...There are so many breeds of dogs available. They should be phased out. I don’t think killing other people’s pets is the correct move, but there just shouldn’t be anymore of them being available for anyone to go get from a shelter"
dogs,fdu41ac,t3_emnqy7,1578727156.0,"Lol I call my dog “Senator Moira”

Her name is Mila and she’s a brown standard poodle. She’s a little sassy and very bossy in our apartment. If we move furniture or something she has to “approve”. She’s just the boss of my apartment. She’s like a little old lady and a  puppy all in one. Don’t get me wrong she’s extremely playful and funny, but at times I call her the Senator of my apartment. I came up with Moira because it sounded like Mila and it’s an older lady like name. So she’s Senator Moira."
doggrooming,fdu2bik,t1_fdt6sls,1578726267.0,Really? Slicker does nothing? I have a poodle. She doesn’t get matted much from what I can see but I use the slicker mainly. She’s also not in a long cut. I use the comb occasionally and on her head a lot.

Mainly though you want to see clean lines and shading also"
