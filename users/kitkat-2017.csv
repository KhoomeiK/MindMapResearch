But I think it's important to have something that indicates an alternate path the son could've taken, some small ray of hope. I mean if you're just going for the super sad ending with no way out, that's fine, but if you want it to have a real message, this is a good opportunity for it. Suicide is a rough topic either way, so be careful with it."

On the other hand, I also have a couple siblings who would probably be relieved not to have to acknowledge my existence. Same with my parents. When I came out as trans, it was pretty much as if I'd already died anyway. Last time I saw my dad, he pretended I didn't exist. Last time I talked to my mom, she told me she was sick of my negativity. Last time I tried to hang out with my best friend, he forgot about me and made other plans. I'm not important to anyone. I think there would probably be a few ""omg rip"" posts on my facebook page, and that's how I'd pass.

I think far more often about which name they'd put on my gravestone, if I even got one. I think more likely I'd end up in a crematorium and no one would bother collecting my ashes."

MissTilley,fe94x71,t3_eo6lkv,1578934279.0,"Within the hour, Beks found himself in a sitting room, planted in a comfortable chair that sat in a circle of others like it. They were occupied by the American President, Jack Davis; Czar Vladimir Kierev; Chinese Premiere Wong Hae Soon; and the Chancellor of the European Union, Luuk Janseen, who made very little effort to hide his distaste for the presence of the czar. Beks glanced up to see a buxom woman in a maid’s outfit offer him a glass of wine, which he gratefully accepted and drained half of it in one breath. He crossed his legs as he looked at all the faces in front of him. These were a collection of the most powerful people in the world, and yet he felt like he was in a meeting back in his lab. 

“So?” he asked impatiently. “What’s this about a planet, and why don’t I know about it?”

Kierev spoke first, as President Davis still seemed like he was going to blow an oversized blood vessel on his neck.

“Mr Mendelsohn, you must—”

“Please,” Beks muttered with a sigh, interrupting the czar. “I’m not a politician, I’m a scientist. Call me Beks.”

The Russian tried to hide his irritation at having been interrupted, merely nodding in acquiescence. “Very well. Beks. You must understand that what I tell you is a secret of the Russki-American Alliance that has been kept well over a century.”

“A secret none of these people have a right to,” Jack growled, but was forestalled further comment by a hand from Vladimir. Beks withheld a smirk; it was clear who wore the pants in *this* relationship. It was never sad to see an American put in his place.

“In 2094, my grandfather, at that time President of Russia, renewed the nation’s space exploration program. We had given up, ceding such efforts to the Americans after they beat us to Mars in the 2050s.. Recognizing the American talent for developing interstellar technology, we decided to collaborate. Telescopes had identified a planet very similar to earth some thirty years prior, and my grandfather was extremely curious what it was and whether it was somewhere humans could live.”

Beks thought back to the scholarly histories he’d read of that period, and what Vladimir said sparked a memory of a footnote of such a planet. It was deemed to be too far off to investigate at the time, and as far as the European scientific community was concerned, it was little more than an interesting picture in a coffee table photo book. Mars was of much more interest, as the Americans had landed a research team there and identified tangible evidence that it had once been inhabited.

“Go on,” he motioned, draining the rest of his glass and glancing around for the beautiful hostess. He groaned when he couldn’t find her. Of course she would’ve been shown out before the conversation started.

Vladimir cleared his throat. “Together, we developed a probe and sent it off to that planet. It was much like a time capsule, something buried and forgotten until the time comes to dig it back up. It wasn’t expected to send signals back for at least another fifty years. However, in 2129, our space station received a series of images in a transmission along with the chemical readings from the air and soil on that planet.”

Beks sat up in his chair, staring intently at the czar. Not only had they successfully gotten a probe to this planet, but they’d received *data* already? And that long ago?

“To be blunt, with very slight variations, the analysis on those samples answered our questions. The planet was inhabitable. The air, at the time of the reading, was roughly 40 degrees celsius, so a bit hotter than what we’re used to except closer to the equator.”

Beks eased back slowly, not realizing how tightly his hands were gripping the arms of the chair. He felt shell-shocked. He barely heard his Chancellor demanding to know why this had been kept from the rest of the world, on top of Mr. Soon asking the same thing in his high-pitched voice. Around him, the room devolved into anger and argument, but a ringing in his ears seemed to drain them all out until it was a muffled cacophony.

When his research began to indicate how close to the end of life on earth we had come, Beks had diverted most of his efforts to developing terraforming technology. It was pure science fiction, but he thought it could be done, and Mars was a good candidate. All he had was a poor semblance of a prototype, but now, that was less than necessary. The scientist’s mind began to fragment, part of it wondering about cryogenic freezing during space travel to overcome the 35 years it had taken the drone to respond, part of it curious if the planet was inhabited, part of it going a thousand other places at once.

Suddenly he realized the arguing had died down and all eyes were on him. Beks relaxed his grip on the arm, fingers tingling as blood returned to the tips, and eased the tension in his shoulders.

“What else?” he asked simply. This time, Jack replied.

“The probe went quiet. That one transmission was all we received. President Baker halted the Mars exploration program as soon as we received the data from Vladimir’s father, and we poured money into research and development. NASA received more money from the budget than they had since the Apollo expedition of the 1960s.”

Vladimir took over from there. “We built a research facility in Alaska, staffed by both Russians and Americans, and we have since developed a method of space travel that - while it is yet untested - may allow us to reach this distant planet. It is yet incomplete, but with the news you shared today, Beks, we can move up some deadlines.”

Chancellor Janseen sighed and dropped his face into his hands. “That’s why your father finally decided to seize Ukraine by force… they wanted our research.”

Beks nodded absently. The EU had a facility in Ukraine that had been developing a means of traveling to Mars en masse, but they’d lost that research and technology before he was born when Vladimir’s father had invaded Ukraine and declared Russia to once again be an empire. It was perhaps the single biggest world event of the 22nd century, and had the United States along with Canada not suddenly sided with Russia, it may have erupted into world war three. Instead, to avoid more bloodshed, the High Chancellor of that time had merely ceded the Ukrainian nation, which then ceased to exist. That decision had led to his assassination at the hands of Ukrainian rebels, who had branded him a defector to Russian imperialism.

Beks shook his head. The politics of fifty years ago didn’t concern him. “We need to get testing underway on that as soon as possible,” he said to President Davis, who merely nodded. He turned his attention to the czar. “In that transmission from your probe, was there *any* indication that the planet may be inhabited already?”

Vladimir spread his hands with a shrug. “I can’t say for certain. We can only speculate that it stopped transmitting because it was found and destroyed by some indigenous race. The data itself shows no indication of intelligent life.”

Frowning, Beks clasped his hands together and twiddled his thumbs for moment. That wasn’t much to go on. Even a sixty-year-old data set was suspect on its own, but what choice did they have? Finally, he stood.

“Thank you for your time, gentlemen. I need to get on the next flight to Berlin, but please, keep me informed of developments in Alaska. Chancellor, would you please walk with me?” Beks asked, motioning the older man to join him.

Wong stood as well. “What are you going to do?” he asked. Beks glanced at him.

“I’m going to save the fucking human race,” he replied, and followed Luuk out of the room."

In which case I would stick to the basics of what differentiates them - variations in height, skin color, hair color, etc. Then, when the POV character meets them on a more individual basis, you can describe them in a bit more detail. But you're right, a full page of character descriptions would bog down the story and lose the reader, so stick to what's important.

She fought just hard enough to keep them from being overwhelmed; her offensive magic was not as strong as Brakus’, not by a long shot, but it was enough. Kaylan went down first, a rusted sword sticking out of his side. Then went Nathaniel, as a spear found the crack in his armor. Only a few skeletons remained.

Starr really was an accomplished archer. He would destroy the rest on his own. The man bellowed for K’tahni to see to their comrades, but just as the last arrow left his bow, K’tahni struck with a blast of air-based magic that snapped the bowstave in two. He stared, one part held in his hand as the other hung by the bow string, his mouth hanging open.

And then he turned. Brakus had crawled towards K’tahni, and feebly slashed out with a dagger, but she nonchalantly kicked him across the face. Nathaniel’s and Kaylan’s sweaty faces stared at her in consternation, hands held to their wounds, as she idly walked over to brush bloody hair from Carter’s dead face.

“You all should really learn how to be kind to your healers,” she mused, her voice too sweet.

“You bitch…” Starr growled. He flicked his arm and a knife came out of his sleeve, but before he could throw it, she lashed out with air again, and his forearm snapped. His scream echoed through the cavern for what seemed like hours. The bard dropped to his knees, clutching the useless arm to his chest.

“I wasn’t finished,” she said, wagging a finger at him. “Your arrogance would have gotten this poor boy killed, just as it has nearly killed me time, and time, and time again.” She kissed the boy’s bloody cheek and went back to petting his hair as she turned her glance on the man in broken armor. “Nathaniel, how many times have I brought you back from the brink? Hmm? I’m listening, Nathaniel.”

The warrior spat, refusing to answer. K’tahni tsked. “Now now, Nathaniel. Manners. Since the cat seems to have gotten your tongue, I’ll remind you. Too many to count. And the majority could have been avoided if you didn’t fight like a rabid puppy.”

She turned her attention on Kaylan. The man must’ve lost a lot of blood; his face was pale, and his eyelids were beginning to droop. She crafted a small healing spell; she would not have the man pass out on her before she had her say.

“And you, master dragoon. Tell me, does your order teach you to completely ignore your healer, disregard incoming attacks, and leave yourself open just so you can have the optimum angle to leap from? Hmm? I’m sure they don’t, but you just always have to be the hero, landing the killing blow even if it does distract me from healing someone else just to keep your dumb ass alive.”

K’tahni glanced at Starr, and sighed. “You wouldn’t understand anything I say even if I took my clothes off to make you listen.” She continued petting the dead boy’s hair, making a show of cooing comfortingly into his ears. Brakus reached for her with his dagger again, and she kicked him one more time, completely unhinging his jaw this time. Blood seeped from his mouth onto the ground as he lay helplessly, struggling to stare up at her.

“Now. You have ignored my strategies, my warnings, and even when I keep you all alive against all odds, you ignore my efforts. So don’t blame me now as I ignore your screams.”

With that, she released another net of earth-based magic she’d been holding from the beginning. The ceiling above the party began to cave in, a little at a time. Nathaniel was the first to scream. Or maybe it was Brakus; she wouldn’t have heard him anyway. She laughed as she walked away.

K’tahni idly walked past the slumbering forms of her former party, pausing to admire her handiwork with their new healer for a moment before continuing in the direction from which they’d come. As she went, she heard the clattering of bones coming closer, drawn by the noise she’d made.

With a deep breath, she let her smile slip into a look of feigned horror. It really didn’t matter if it was convincing or not, but she deftly wove a net of healing magic that would undo her sleeping spell.

“What the hell…?” Nathaniel groaned as he pushed himself to his hands and knees.

“Nathaniel! Oh thank the spirits, you’re okay! When I saw…” she trailed off, staring at Carter as her eyes brimmed with tears.

“K’tahni?” Brakus asked numbly, unsteadily clambering to his feet. “What are you doing here?” His eyes fell on Carter’s lifeless body, the rock still jutting from his chest. “Fuck…” he muttered.

“I… I followed you. I wanted to prove myself, but then the ceiling caved in, and - “ she choked on a sob. She shook her head vigorously as if trying to gather her emotions. “Hurry, there’s something coming!”

Nathaniel picked his axe up from where it had fallen as Starr nocked an arrow to his bow. “You’ll have to do,” the warrior growled. “Try not to fuck it up this time.”

All of them turned their attention toward the curve in the tunnel, from which the clattering of shambling corpses was growing louder. K’tahni couldn’t stop the smile that spread across her face. Once again, Starr made no effort to support them with his magic. Brakus’ hands began to glow with orange flames, and Kaylan crouched, spear held at the ready. Nathaniel’s armor was still cracked.

*Idiots,* K’tahni thought. Her heart was pounding with excitement. As she’d expected when she chose this spot, the skeletons saw them before they saw the skeletons. A scattered hail of arrows flew through the air towards the men. Kaylan and Nathaniel both knocked a few away, Starr nimbly dodged a few, but Brakus cried out in pain as one took him in the thigh.

He turned and looked at K’tahni. Her smile widened even as her brows drew down, and Brakus’ eyes grew to the size of teacups. He opened his mouth, but even as he screamed in warning, the others heard nothing. Her spell of silence enveloped the mage, simultaneously blocking his own spells and preventing him from warning the party of her treachery.

K’tahni put a finger to her lips and winked. He tried to make a dash for Starr, the closest man to him, but his injured leg buckled.

Fortunately, the men had decided to actually fetch the healer, but then they spent the remainder of her money on booze. She was evicted from her room that night, unable to pay, and spent the next several hiding in the stable’s hayloft, hoping the stablemaster wouldn’t find her and kick her out into the rain.

Brakus finally came out of his room on the second day. The side of his neck bore the scars of his burns. K’tahni sat in a corner of the common room, still without the money to order anything, listening as her former party interviewed another healer for their next foray into the caverns outside the village. There had been raids by groups of undead, and none had found the source.

She kept her hood up. Surely one of them had noticed her, but as usual, she was of no import. When they struck a deal with a young blonde man in white robes, she smirked. An easy target. That night, while they were still preparing to depart, K’tahni slipped into the cave entrance alone. The main level had been cleared out of all creatures, though there was still the chance a few of the shambling skeletons had come up from the depths, so she kept to the shadows. 

The white mage went down. She bypassed the cavern where they had fought that giant beast, ignoring the smell of its rotting carcass. This had been a mine, once, and old broken rails criss-crossed through various downward-sloping tunnels.

Her preparations went quickly, and a small, wry smile crossed her lips when she heard the now-familiar clinking of bones in a chamber just up the tunnel from her. As expected, she heard Starr’s voice first. The man was boisterous, and was engaging their new healer - she learned his name was Carter - in a raucous tale of when Starr had accidentally slept with his woman’s twin sister.

When they came around the corner, she struck. Inverting her spell so only she could see it, she wrapped flows of magic around a few stalactites. Her earth-based magic melded with the salt veins in the rock and she heaved. With a loud crack, the stalactites came free, and her old party did not have time to react. Carter was crushed immediately, impaled by sharp rocks that propped him up on bloody stands of stone.

No turning back now. Had she gone mad? Her smile never so much as twitched as she crafted another spell and laid it across the party. So what if she was? It didn’t matter. These fools would learn who she was once and for all, and if they wanted to tell her she was a useless, sorry excuse for a healer, then perhaps they would appreciate her power as an agent of death.

*It’s so cold. Why is it so cold?*

“She’s waking up.”

“It’s about damn time.”

K’tahni’s eyes slowly fluttered open, and she realized she was lying in a bed. She could smell… meat? And bread. It was the room she’d rented at *The Dancing Mage*, and the smell of food cooking had wafted up the stairs, permeating each room.

“What… happened?” she groaned, and couldn’t stop the wince. She must have at least two or three broken ribs. Why hadn’t she been healed? Suddenly memory flooded back, and she barely resisted the urge to sit bolt upright. “Brakus?” she asked quickly.

Starr’s face filled her vision, staring down at her. His unsightly curled mustaches twitched in disapproval. “He lives. Barely. No thanks to you. The town healer was able to stabilize him, but he’s still recovering. He’ll always bear the scars.”

K’tahni sighed. “And my injuries? Why haven’t I been healed?”

She didn’t see Starr’s slap coming, and it *hurt.* Ears ringing, she touched her face where he’d hit her and stared at him in shock, eyes brimming with tears.

“You don’t deserve it. If you can’t keep us alive, we’re not going to waste money on healing services for you. You’re a sorry excuse for a healer,” he spat. K’tahni turned her head, still holding her hand to her cheek, and saw Nathaniel and Kaylan there as well. Nathaniel merely glared, but Kaylan went so far as to spit on her blanket.

“We barely made it out of there alive. You’ve failed us for the last time. Try your hand at whoring, even you should be capable of lying on your back without screwing it up,” Kaylan growled.

K’tahni let her hand fall to her side, and was surprised to realize that her shock and fear were rising into white hot rage, building in her chest and waiting to explode. She let out a long, painful breath as she tried to reign in her emotions. She was in no condition to fight these men she’d thought were her friends. “Please… take my money, in my bag, and bring the healer. It hurts. I’m sorry, I… I tried.”

She thought it was a convincing plea. The rage still burned. These… these *idiots!* Kaylan ignored her warnings, Nathaniel exposed himself in an effort to do more damage, and Brakus was too busy focusing on his own spells to avoid a simple stream of fire! Not to mention Starr’s refusal to even take a few seconds to use his own magic to weave protective barriers. There was a reason they’d put together such a well-rounded party, but the fools had no concept of battle strategy. It was *always* the damn healer’s fault.

No more. K’tahni had had enough, and as the men left her there, she let her rage fester, seething under her blankets as ideas began to formulate."

*It’s so cold. Why is it so cold?*

“She’s waking up.”

“It’s about damn time.”

K’tahni’s eyes slowly fluttered open, and she realized she was lying in a bed. She could smell… meat? And bread. It was the room she’d rented at *The Dancing Mage*, and the smell of food cooking had wafted up the stairs, permeating each room.

“What… happened?” she groaned, and couldn’t stop the wince. She must have at least two or three broken ribs. Why hadn’t she been healed? Suddenly memory flooded back, and she barely resisted the urge to sit bolt upright. “Brakus?” she asked quickly.

Starr’s face filled her vision, staring down at her. His unsightly curled mustaches twitched in disapproval. “He lives. Barely. No thanks to you. The town healer was able to stabilize him, but he’s still recovering. He’ll always bear the scars.”

K’tahni sighed. “And my injuries? Why haven’t I been healed?”

She didn’t see Starr’s slap coming, and it *hurt.* Ears ringing, she touched her face where he’d hit her and stared at him in shock, eyes brimming with tears.

“You don’t deserve it. If you can’t keep us alive, we’re not going to waste money on healing services for you. You’re a sorry excuse for a healer,” he spat.

K’tahni cried out in warning as the beast flung out its staff, pointing at Kaylan. The dragoon ignored her, crouching as he prepared to lunge at the creature with his spear, but it was too late. Blue flame enveloped him, and K’tahni hurriedly began weaving her most potent healing spell for him.

Even as she did so, the beast flung out his free hand, and K’tahni had to dive to the side as a figure in black armor flew towards her. Nathaniel smashed into the cavern wall behind her, his great axe clattering to the ground as he slid down, head slumped to the side. Tears streamed down her face, and she deftly wove a second spell right alongside the first.

“K’tahni, the hell are you doing?” a man’s voice cried out from the other side of the cavern. She had no time for him, looking back and forth between Kaylan and Nathaniel, trying to keep both of them alive. She was dimly aware of lightning striking the beast from thin air, of arrows flying from the mouth of the cave, and both the mage and the bard were yelling at her to stop dawdling and heal the other two.

A soft white glow began to pulse around both men. Her heart pounded in her ears, deafening, and she had to wipe sweat from her eyes - so she didn’t see the giant staff coming towards her. It took her in the stomach, and her eyes bulged. Time seemed to slow as her breath rushed out and she clattered across the floor. She coughed; blood splattered in the dirt. Arms shaking, K’tahni tried to push herself up even as the flames flew from the staff toward Brakus, the mage. Surely Starr had woven him a shield… no. Of course not. Brakus’ cloak caught fire and he screamed as his skin crackled underneath it. She had to… had to…

“Get up, you stupid girl! Help him!” Starr yelled, firing his bow for all he was worth. Tears streamed down K’tahni’s face as she weakly got to her knees. The healing had taken on both Kaylan and Nathaniel, and they charged forward together, despite Nathaniel’s ruined breastplate.

She could see blackness encroaching on her vision, as if she was looking down a long tunnel. She reached for her magic, for the source of life that allowed her to knit wounds and purge poisons, but it evaded her. K’tahni watched helplessly as Brakus dropped to his knees, his screams filling the cavern.

And then everything went black. She didn’t remember falling forward."

*John instinctively covered his head with his hands as dirt rained down on him from the laser blast. ""They have us pinned down!"" he shouted at the man beside him. Together they hunched against their feeble cover like cornered rabbits dodging a wolf's snapping jaws. His own rifle felt like a toy in his hands, and was little more use. He couldn't put his head up long enough to aim a shot without risking it being blown off.*

*His comrade-in-arms, a taciturn older fellow named Phillip, stared at him, his face grim. ""At this point,"" he began, his voice like boots on gravel, ""what do we have to lose but our lives?"" He nodded toward a small copse of trees perhaps a hundred paces from their protective ridge. ""We get there, we can have enough cover to make a strategic withdrawal to the south. Ready?""*

*John stared at the trees for a moment, his hands shaking. Fear sweat soaked his shirt, and he wiped it from his eyes before nodding quickly. ""I'll cover you,"" he said, surprised at how steady his voice was. In war, a man could only rely on himself and the man at his side, and if they were going to survive, they had work to do.* 

*Phillip checked the energy core on his rifle, and nodded. With that he let out a scream of defiance as he dove, rolling under a hail of red lasers that threw up sod from where they hit the ground around him. At the same time, John stuck his rifle atop the ridge and pulled the trigger as fast as he could without looking at his aim. The oncoming fire seemed to slow, and John continued to shoot back as Phillip pumped his legs for all he was worth, ducking and diving as he crossed the exposed kill zone between John and the small group of trees.*

Description of movement, rather than statements of specific moves, is more effective in prose to paint a scene, and including the emotions and reactions of the characters is imperative to pull the reader into the scene. I hope this example was somewhat effective for you, I kinda pulled it out of my butt. I write fantasy and don't have guns in my stories, but the same principles apply whether it's sword fight or a gun fight."

WritingPrompts,fd9tat1,t3_ekdjpt,1578237765.0,"*Mark Anderson.* The constant, harrowing reminder of the car accident I'd caused when driving on my permit when I was 16. He was the first.

*Jessica Marx.* A girl I knew in high school. My reminder that popularity is not more important than kindness; just as her name decorated my left arm, the suicide note she'd written after I blew her off senior year was kept neatly tucked away in my top drawer.

*Brian Thompson.* My cousin. I had convinced him to go with me to the recruiter, and he didn't make it home from his first deployment. Meanwhile, I hadn't even made the cut in basic training...

The three names repeated themselves every morning. Mark, emblazoned across my right forearm. Jessica, on the left. Brian, on my ribs. All had mysteriously appeared the moment they died, and while Mark's had sent me into a panic, by the time I was told Jessica had hung herself, I'd figured it out. Their deaths were my fault, and the tattoos - such as they were - were not just reminders, but lessons.

It had been six years since Brian was taken by an IED in Kandahar, and no other names had appeared. I never went above the speed limit, stopped at yellow lights, and answered every call for help no matter how trivial it seemed. After Jessica, I'd abandoned my dreams of becoming a social worker - that was *much* too volatile a career for someone with my affliction - and became a freelance accountant. I was the *perfect* boring citizen.

So this morning, when I woke up and got in the shower, the appearance of a new tattoo was an absolute shock. It was right across my chest, as if screaming at me ""How could you?""

*Angela Barton.*

How could I what? Who was Angela Barton? I stared in horror in the mirror at those black letters that had appeared splayed across my chest. Frantically, my mind darted hither and yon, searching for any indication of who this woman was. None of my clients, no one from my book club, no relatives... who?

I darted from the bathroom in my little studio apartment without so much as a glance at my towel. My hands shook as I dialed the number of a potential new client, whom I was supposed to meet with in just over an hour. As it rang, tears streaked down my face and I cleared my throat just as the line clicked open.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Carson. I'm going to have to postpone our meeting, a personal emergency has come up this morning,"" I stated, somewhat proud of how steady my voice was. It only croaked once.

The client seemed to hear it, though. He agreed to reschedule for tomorrow. I breathed a long sigh of relief, thanked him, and barely remembered to hang up before dashing to my laptop.

*Google knows everyone,* I thought, and typed the name in the search. No obituaries, at least not in the last 24 hours. Of course not, that would be too fast, since she would've just died last night. The names always appeared at the moment of their death, or near enough not to matter as far as I could tell.

Frustrated, I searched every social media site I knew, and though there were some Angela Bartons on Facebook, they all seemed alive and well. Again, probably too soon to tell based on that. I slammed the lid of my laptop shut and hugged my knees to my chest. I struggled to breathe, choking on my sobs as I struggled to imagine who this mystery woman was that I had inadvertently killed.

*Angela Barton.*

*Angela Barton.*

Suddenly, a horrifying thought occurred to me. It was a stretch, but... slowly I opened my laptop again and navigated to my support group's website. My saved login information stared at me, though I knew it wouldn't work. I had deleted the profile in a fit of self denial the night before and then cried myself to sleep. The username was Angela\_Zalinski - my real last name with a first name I'd chosen.

*Angela Barton.*

With that screen open, I glanced at my phone as it rang. It was my partner. Jack Barton. As realization dawned on me, the tears started flowing again, and I let the call go to voicemail. In deleting my profile, I had made a much larger decision. And in a manner of speaking... I had killed my future self."

That aside, using italics for accents is a little odd. So only the words that are said with an accent are italicized? By its nature, an accent affects every part of a person's speech, so would you just have characters where all of their dialogue is italicized? Seems a little much. I'd echo the others that have said word choice and sentence structure are a better approach to accents.

Oh sure, people said they liked my old stuff, but I didn't, and that's what really matters, because if you don't like your work that will reflect itself in the writing, and other people will see that too. 

Point is, don't give up. You have plenty of time, and even if you just have to finish up high school and maybe college before you can really apply yourself to your writing, it's not the worst thing. Besides, that just gives you more time to practice and hone your craft. Just like a painter has to spend years going through awful sketches to master their skill, so do we as writers.
