I understand that each group is different, but I would start with finding space in your schedule, then figuring out what you can do within that time block. Getting a gym membership won't mean much if you only have 20 minutes in your day to work out.  


 

* **6:30 a.m.** Wake up, pray, exercise, and do other preparation for the day.
* **7:30 a.m.** Breakfast.
* **8:00 a.m.** Personal study: [the Book of Mormon](https://www.mormonmissionprep.com/becoming-an-effective-missionary/the-book-of-mormon/), other scriptures, chapters from [Preach My Gospel](https://www.mormonmissionprep.com/recommended-reading/preach-my-gospel/), etc. with an emphasis on the doctrines of the missionary lessons.
* **9:00 a.m**. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, and confirm plans for the day.
* **10:00 a.m.** Language study for 30 to 60 minutes, if necessary and approved by your mission president.
* **10:00 a.m.** Begin proselyting: teaching appointments, finding people to teach, [open your mouth](https://www.mormonmissionprep.com/becoming-an-effective-missionary/open-your-mouth/), etc.
* **Lunch and Dinner:** You may take an hour for lunch and an hour for dinner at times that fit best with proselyting. Normally, dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m.
* **9:00 – 9:30 p.m.** Return to the apartment and plan the next day’s activities. Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray.
* **10:30 p.m.** Go to bed.

""So, why does the Devil not want you to know about these things (and any more) regarding the Book of Mormon?  Well, the almost inescapable conclusion is that if these things are true, then:

1. Joseph Smith did indeed translate the Book of Mormon from ancient records through the “gift and power of God”, and therefore,
2. He was a true prophet of God, and therefore,
3. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is indeed a restoration of Christ’s New Testament Church, and the way to find salvation and true eternal happiness.

And the Devil does not want you to know that."""

and these same folks would have you believe that God wants us all to multiply... but refuse to see arousal as a holy gift. I would figure that mormons would be absolute sex fiends, but therein lies the doublethink: you commodify the sex, make it something that has to be done exactly right or God Is Mad, but also God is the one who gave us the ability to be aroused, so you can't even be that mad that you want it. But it's definitely on you to work through the arousal that God gave you, but not by yourself, even though God also made the hands on your body too.

2.  tip hips forward so that you're angling forward, rather than down. Practice in the shower and try to hit a specific hole in the drain to get your aim right.
3. The first few times you do it in public, wait until you have to pee REALLY bad. The strength of the stream makes it easier to actually make it to the bowl. If you only have to kinda go, forcing your pelvic muscles to push hard can feel weird (AHH I'M GONNA POOP) but you're fine. Wait until you're more versed to do that one too.
