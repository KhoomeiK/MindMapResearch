gunnerkrigg,fdp6hrp,t1_fdk8h67,1578621135.0,Lol... PS you've got me thinking about how many times Kat has changed her look while they've been dating and Paz has....been Paz.
gorillaz,fdp5sgi,t1_fdluuyc,1578620662.0,Yeah mang! There should be a club where a certain level of Gorillaz body art gets you a ticket for a show of your choice each tour cycle! I have spoken :)
gorillaz,fdlul37,t1_fdltaiw,1578532851.0,Neato! More Quality Content‚Ñ¢!
gorillaz,fdlqokt,t3_elymid,1578530203.0,Sooo cool. Do you think you'd add more when there's future phases?

TheOA,fc9nnyf,t1_fc97hxz,1577555421.0,Good bot! I will gladly accept :D
TheOA,fc9ngsq,t1_fc9fhq9,1577555335.0,"Yeah it's kind of a double edged sword because I'm sure they don't want to compromise their vision, but it does seem the ambition + taking as long as they needed to potentially worked against them. Extra bummer if they were working under the assumption they were ""safe"" with Netflix ... Though anyone that's spent any time in the industry knows better, so I guess I'm just rambling now...haha. On a positive note I'm looking forward to whatever they do next!"

MadeMeSmile,fc98ajd,t1_fc8v90y,1577548623.0,F-f-f-f-frick yeah!
TheOA,fc97hot,t1_fc77w63,1577548260.0,"Since they were pitching it everywhere as a 5 season arc, knowing that Netflix would only give them two would probably have meant them going elsewhere. Which makes it extra terrible if Netflix planned that from the beginning.

Meanwhile, they're pooping out a 4th season of 13 reasons why, a show that definitely didn't need more than one. :("

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fbr5e1p,t1_fbqr973,1577039363.0,I know exactly what you mean- because I get nervous about posting my own art for that reason! Something I'm going to work on as the days get longer... :)
