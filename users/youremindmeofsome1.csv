amiugly,ffe0a1j,t3_eswnea,1579833375.0,You don’t even have a square jaw. It’s looks perfectly round/feminine. You’re cute.
amiugly,ffbq2a1,t3_eskpnj,1579778023.0,"Shave the stache. Something is looking very 80s in these pics. The hairstyle, facial hair and jacket are screaming 1983, but maybe that’s popular again. You’re not ugly though. You have a sweet face."
amiugly,ffbpz26,t3_esky5o,1579777900.0,"You’re fine as hell. If I wasn’t married, would love to be your sugar momma."
amiugly,ffbptt4,t3_esm7dq,1579777700.0,"I think you’re really handsome, but I would have guessed you were 16/17. This is coming from a 33F so take it with a grain of salt. I think I’ve forgotten what early 20s looks like. You’re certainly attractive enough to get a girlfriend."
amiugly,ffbprdx,t3_esmmea,1579777603.0,"You have really nice eyes. Your hair is a little ridiculous, but you’re 16 so you get a pass. Not ugly at all imo."
amiugly,ffbpnxk,t3_espaji,1579777464.0,You’re cute. Definitely not ugly.
amiugly,ffbpmza,t1_ffbosg2,1579777427.0,"This is the most fucked up and BS thread I’ve read in a while. There are attractive people of every ethnicity. If you haven’t seen one, it’s because you don’t know enough people of that ethnicity. 

Also OP, you’re not ugly but you need therapy. 

I grew up in a very racially mixed neighborhood in NYC and, believe me, there are absolutely gorgeous black, brown and Asian women."

Documentaries,ff4b25c,t1_ff490rg,1579559456.0,"I’ll admit that I don’t have the most sensitive nose. Plus, for surgery/dissection you should be wearing a mask. I genuinely don’t notice too much of a difference between obese patients vs normal weight patients during dissection in terms of odor. I’m trying to think back to when I first entered a cadaver lab. I guess the smell is pretty astounding when you first start, but still it’s mostly formaldehyde and you should acclimate pretty quickly to the smell."
Documentaries,ff486l2,t1_ff31gyh,1579557645.0,"The fat makes dissection a little more difficult, but I don’t think it smells like anything. I just recently proctored an anatomy lab maybe a month ago and it’s really tough to smell anything over the smell of the formaldehyde. Plus they have the air in the lab circulating every 3 minutes or something. 

I do surgery on live patients and fat can complicate surgery, but there’s no smell associated with it. Blood tends to stink up an OR much worse especially if there’s a hemorrhage."
Rateme,ff44jbz,t3_er21a2,1579555375.0,You’re totally adorable!
amiugly,ff43kil,t3_erjn8x,1579554777.0,I don’t like giving ratings. You’re very young and you’re not ugly. You have a lot of potential. You have a cute face!

science,feybomn,t1_fex80om,1579443365.0,"In my own life I’ve known women who regretted having an abortion and women who didn’t care. That’s just anecdotal evidence, but those women exist. It’s a huge statement to say “all”."

amiugly,feugmwn,t1_feu7sxg,1579386374.0,Maybe mascara then to darken your eyelashes. I know that sounds nuts but I think it would make a huge difference.
amiugly,feu7rnr,t3_eql7ae,1579383926.0,Lol you’re beautiful! Not ugly at all.
amiugly,feu79pl,t3_eqm8tz,1579383804.0,"I feel like you’d look great if you dyed your hair and eyebrows light brown. You have a nice face, but you’re super blond."

thick,feque95,t3_eqb3b1,1579346083.0,She’s so skinny now. It’s crazy because she looked amazing! Those curves were no joke.
unpopularopinion,fepe6s2,t3_eq2knz,1579318298.0,"Eh. I’m super anti-smoking. That being said, I’m a surgeon and many limbs are lost to smoking, especially amongst the homeless. They don’t seem to believe that smoking causes peripheral arterial disease. Why would I want to help someone lose their legs?

And with booze, obviously liver disease. Neither is a good way to die. 

I’ve found over the years that it’s almost impossible to help homeless drug addicts. Believe me I’ve tried. When I was in my my early twenties, I used to let a few homeless dudes sleep in my apartment when it rained or was really cold. I gave them toothbrushes and let them shower. Sometimes I even crashed on the couch with them. In the end I got burned a few times. One of them was actually really nice though, but profoundly schizophrenic and off treatment so I couldn’t keep helping him because he was occasionally dangerous."
Justfuckmyshitup,femjnhp,t3_eptsf9,1579258973.0,"Honestly, this makes me pretty sad. This man can never really have a stable job because of his appearance.  He has eyelid tattoos."

news,fejgcvx,t3_ep5sbj,1579172939.0,"I have a friend who is huge into conspiracy theories and my brother was talking to him and he said, “I think we can finally agree on something. Who do you think killed Jeffrey Epstein?” And he said, “You think Jeffrey Epstein’s dead?”. I just died laughing, but I hadn’t thought about it. How convenient is that he’s dead and can allude trial? Maybe he’s still alive! I always feel like I can never properly think outside of the box."
wholesomememes,fejg7gd,t3_epa68l,1579172730.0,This is sad on so many levels. Trying not to cry.
relationship_advice,fegbgnf,t1_feeu7vv,1579086267.0,"Yeah, but no one should be making fun of anyone. His family is terrible. I remember when my mother told me that my current husband (then boyfriend) was too short. We’re both 5’6”. I told her that I was appalled that she was so superficial and to f*ck off because I make decisions about who I date, not her. OP’s boyfriend needs to set some boundaries with his family ASAP. My family knows that I don’t tolerate that kind of talk."
amiugly,fe41d5s,t3_enrcpk,1578854843.0,You’re beautiful!

amiugly,fdixqw2,t3_ellq4x,1578453445.0,Not even remotely ugly.
unpopularopinion,fdgg510,t3_el2zao,1578395277.0,"God, people make such a fuss about ethnicity and culture. Just let people think and feel and identify with whatever they want. Who gives a fuck? 

For a little perspective, I’m American of Hispanic descent. My parents are immigrants to the US. My father left Colombia to make money and my mother left Cuba to escape communism. Their cultural identities are very important to them and they love to share their culture with me. It would be weird for me to renounce their culture and say I’m American and not even mention that my parents are foreign. That’s why Americans usually say “I’m a quarter this and half that”, etc. it’s a country of immigrants! 

If African Americans want to identify with Black Panther, let them! Why do you care?"

childfree,fck7oaz,t1_fcjx7w0,1577718867.0,"I’m child free, but this is just an awful comment. I know many moms who are in great shape even after they’ve given birth. People are fat with stretch marks and diabetes without ever getting pregnant. May as well get a baby out of it! 

I know many women who truly enjoyed being pregnant and said they’ve never felt better. I also know women who said they hated it. Pregnancy is just like anything else, individual, and results will vary. 

That being said, pregnancy is definitely a stress on the body and pelvic floor physical therapy should be standard of care after a natural birth to prevent incontinence."
