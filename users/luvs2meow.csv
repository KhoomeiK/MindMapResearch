teaching,ff1bewi,t1_feys0ai,1579477133.0,"Hmm. I think it depends on how you define disrespect. I’ve never had a parent come at me like this, but I’ve had parents tell their children that they don’t care if they get in trouble in my class, and others question my management and duties (like it’s my job to help their child find things they lost at school, etc). I definitely had way more overbearing parents when I worked at a private school. People feel like they’re paying you so you should bend over backwards for them (ironically, I left bc I made half what I do in public school)."
socialanxiety,fesl9iy,t3_eq9aem,1579366405.0,"I’m an elementary teacher w social anxiety so I have a few thoughts on this. 

One is that most teachers are outgoing. This is actually something I struggle with AS a teacher because my colleagues who are super outgoing are usually touted as “great teachers!”  I actually just commented on the teacher sub reddit about how I’ve been feeling inadequate lately because one of my close colleagues is just so outgoing and confident and brags about what she does, so everyone thinks she’s amazing.  I personally think I’m an equally good (if not better) teacher as she is, but I doubt I’ll ever be recognized as such since I am quiet and not as confident. Regardless, my primary point here is that most teachers have never experienced anxiety about speaking so they just don’t get it or realize the level of stress they’re putting on kids (not that it makes it OK). 

Second, is that speaking is actually a part of our learning standards in the US. I have to grade kids on reading, writing, speaking, and listening (those are all literacy skills).  I think since I have social anxiety myself I’m probably a bit more easy going about this. Once you build the relationships even the quiet kids will talk to you. I try to teach social skills and make speaking to one another a normal thing from the very first day of school so that the shy kids can feel comfortable and confident performing basic social behaviors (in teaching we call this scaffolding.. building upon skills by giving them the tools they need to grow). For example, every morning we go around the circle and say hello to one another. Then we go around and share one thing, like what our favorite ice cream is. In the beginning the shy kids sometimes don’t want to share but as the year goes on this activity becomes low risk and they do it.  I don’t do this to be a mean teacher catering to the outgoing kids, I do this to help build the skills in kids like myself. Its structured and low risk. I wish I would’ve had teachers who taught and developed social skills.  So exposure therapy can work, if done right I think. Throwing a kid into the fire is going to traumatize them. Giving a child the tools they need to feel confident enough to speak should be the goal."
Teachers,fep0a6u,t3_eq06et,1579309266.0,"Anyone else have social anxiety as a teacher?? 

My first three years were in a tiny parochial school where people loved me immediately just because. For the first time in my life I felt like I truly belonged and was accepted. 

I left for more money and it’s been so difficult. I miss my coworkers. My new coworkers are nice for the most part but I just find myself judging them or worrying that they’re judging me.  Like they’re nice, but they aren’t as nice as my old coworkers. I feel like it’s a competition and people brag a lot. One girl actually said, “Well, realistically I’m the best teacher here.” Who the hell says something like that?! 

At my old school I was such a respected and loved teacher. I didn’t have to brag about what I did in my classroom because parents heard from their kids and my principal just knew and really supported me. Now I feel like I have to prove myself. My coworker is a first year teacher but is so outgoing and always sharing what she’s doing and that’s just not my personality, but people are always saying how great she is. I get nauseas before lunch everyday because I eat in the lounge to be social but she’s always there and just makes me feel so inadequate. And I don’t truly feel she’s better than me as a teacher, I think she’s just more vocal and confident which makes her seem better. 

I guess I’m just feeling really insecure. Changing schools has been much more challenging than I expected and I miss my old community. I miss feeling confident in my job."
Teachers,feoddvz,t1_fenvmnl,1579298646.0,"As a kid who did this myself and still sometimes kneel on my chairs as an adult, it’s just more comfortable to me.  I also think it’s unsafe when kids do it but I remember just not enjoying or feeling comfortable sitting on my tush. I think it’s an energy thing. Like I have to constantly be moving my legs, whether I’m bouncing them, sitting on them, or crossing them. I just can’t sit still."
Teachers,feod2v3,t3_eq4icj,1579298463.0,"I have parents texting ME through class dojo about their first graders. 

One mom messages me and my coteacher literally once a week saying, “She had a really rough morning. How’s she doing now?”  Or yesterday, which was crazy AF, she texted, “She really didn’t want to come to school today. How’s she doing now?? I’m really worried about her.” 

What the fuck?? My coteacher will respond but if it’s just me I wait until the end of the day and say, “Sorry I did not get a change to message you earlier, it’s difficult for me to do with students in the room. She seemed fine the entire time I had her.”  I just don’t get it."
ZeroWaste,feo7x2m,t1_fenqto5,1579296326.0,"Right. Like they easily could’ve collected them in large containers and donated to a school or women’s shelter so the products could actually be used once they were done w the demonstration. 🙄 I get what they’re doing but I’m shocked that no one out of all the people involved in this didn’t think “hmmm maybe we shouldn’t make thousands of perfectly good tampons unusable.”

It actually makes me wonder if this all comes back to the root issue... consumerism. They’re a company. They want people to buy their product. Giving the tampons away would be like giving out free product and promoting their competitors, the tampon companies."

ClimateOffensive,feigau7,t1_fehy6oo,1579137853.0,"I got into a huge fight with my stepdad about this last weekend.  He got super triggered that I assumed his only sources were from the Drudge Report and as a result began saying I know nothing if I think he gets his science news from the Drudge Report????

He literally said, “Australian fires aren’t because of climate change. The Walruses killing themselves in Our Planet isn’t because of climate change. I get climate change and it’s not man made. It’s NATURAL. I totally understand the science.”  I was like the fact that you don’t understand how climate change contributes to the spread of wildfires just proves how little you understand the science behind it.  

When I asked him what his sources were since apparently not the Drudge Report (which used to be his homepage) he said “google.”  He asked me what mine were and I was like, “well, google, books, documentaries...” He said, “Oh google books and documentaries, so basically nothing.”  Umm... ok. 

There literally is just not even reasoning with these people.  He ended up saying I know nothing because I was an education major and he has an MBA that he did nothing with and is alas much smarter than me."

Anticonsumption,feif605,t1_feh7w47,1579137091.0,"One of my friends from high school (now in our mid twenties, not super close) recently made a comment about how I have a lot of clothes.  Which is sort of true, but it’s also that my clothes are OLD.  Many of my clothes are 10 years old+. I have Ugg boots from the 8th grade.  I have hoodies and tank tops from middle school and high school still in my rotation. They’re not super nice, I mostly wear those things around the house or running errands, but alas, they still make up a significant part of my wardrobe.  Whereas I think many people might not have as many clothes but their clothes are 2-3 years old, if that.  

How have those clothes lasted so long?? Probably because I’m gross and wear the same things over and over until they smell or look dirty, at which point I’ll finally wash them.  I’ve always been into the grunge look anyways so holes and shit never bothered me. 

On the other hand, I’m now an elementary teacher and despite my “professional clothes” being only 2-4 years old, I could really update them because they look baaaad. Everything just looks terrible. I get sneezed or coughed on at least once a week and sit on the floor, so my work clothes are typically washed after one or two wears, so they just haven’t held up as well as my wardrobe from middle and high school. Also maybe the quality in clothes then and now perhaps."

Teachers,fef5rim,t1_fedxgbn,1579048834.0,"My school doesn’t have phones in classrooms, only peoples offices, like the admin and psychologists.  So if I want to call I have to use theirs and I just feel awkward discussing student issues in front of people like that. So I rarely call. If they signed up for dojo I’ll message them and if not I write a note. A surprising number of parents at my school don’t have emails."
Teachers,fef5e1l,t1_feemcy3,1579048577.0,"That always drove me nuts. When I had my own class I’d send out a weekly email with reminders and learning objectives. If a parent didn’t have email I’d print it in a newsletter. Every kid also had a calendar of important dates in their folder. Yet parents would say, “When is such and such??”  One parent did it at least once a week until I finally got to the point where I’d just respond “Please see my weekly email that I sent Monday.”  Don’t waste my time because you’re too lazy to read an email."
Teachers,fef4vwh,t1_feetzv6,1579048240.0,"This is my first year at my school and in the first month of school I had to call parents to invite them to a program. We also don’t have phones in our classrooms so I bounced around offices (like the psych room, admin offices) and was super awkward on the first voicemail when I realized I didn’t have a direct number. So I said, “Please give me a call back at... um, the main office number and leave a message with the secretary, and I will call you back.”  

I honestly hate it because I don’t like people listening to me on phone calls. Not that I’m saying anything inappropriate, it just makes me nervous and I tend to be an awkward person so I really don’t want more adults hearing me. 

At this point I just don’t call parents.  I send a dojo message if they’ve signed up or I write a note.  I don’t know why there aren’t phones in each room, it’s very odd to me."

I thought it was a great episode. It was a very icky case though. I didn’t find the Toy Box killer to be an awful episode because I was already very familiar with the case but this one made my stomach churn a bit.

Like he basically says good leaders are people who are always happy and putting in the extra effort like being involved in extras and shit... ok, great, but being a “good leader” doesn’t make me more money, so how about no. That’s just my take on it, but I’m also salty AF that I have to read a stupid book on top of everything else I have to do for work.  He offers very few solutions to actual issues.

socialskills,feanmen,t1_fe9n9eg,1578950619.0,"I 100% agree.  I was just telling a friend (who’s equally awkward to me) that I constantly feel like certain coworkers don’t like me and I can’t figure out why. My only guess is that I’m trying so hard to be normal and not awkward, or maybe I’m still awkward despite trying to be normal and they just don’t know how to respond to me?? But I’m just trying to be friendly and build relationships.

Everyone was like, “but they’re paid through Patreon so they should do better.”  Which, sure, but no one HAS to pay them through Patreon. If it bothers you that much then stop paying for content.

ZeroWaste,fdt5o2x,t1_fdslwms,1578712240.0,"I can definitely get behind this. 

I’m personally all for buying zero waste items if it means you’ll use them.  And, in cases like this, sometimes it is more practical. 

For example, when people use mason jars for to go coffee or “water bottles” it makes me so nervous. First of all, heavy. Second, I had a reusable glass water bottle that was gifted to me by my boss the first week of work... we all got them. I’m a teacher. I purposely kept it behind my desk so it wouldn’t get knocked over. Regardless, I hadn’t yet specified to my first graders that they weren’t allowed behind my desk and a kid went behind my desk the FIRST week of school and knocked it off my shelf and it shattered. Unsafe. Distracting. And ultimately created more waste. Now I stick with metal everything. The more practical the better IMO."
Teachers,fdrsv8d,t1_fdqq8n4,1578689213.0,"I was just thinking about this the other day. I always had computer classes as a kid (now 26). I went to a high school with 1-1 tablet PCs so we were expected to utilize all the tools and took IT classes.  Now I teach in the same district I attended as a child and we don’t have any computer classes.  I teach K-1 and the kids use chrome books and they always try to touch the screen to press things because they’re not used to the mouse. I get overwhelmed though because we’re supposed to use the chrome books for various programs and I feel like my kids have no skills on the computers so they’re essentially just there for games, unless I also teach computer skills which is just more work and planning."
Teachers,fdrrual,t3_emqq63,1578688819.0,"I’m struggling with end of the day so much. This is my fourth year teaching first grade but I’m at a new school with a new schedule and a way bigger class and it’s just so challenging. We have specials towards the end of the day so we have 45 minutes left until dismissal. The room is usually a mess but I find having them all clean is too chaotic so they have jobs to clean. It’s a weird amount of time for first graders. Like not enough to do an actual activity and still have time to clean up and pack up, but also too much time so that when they do get packed up I have just fifteen minutes and it’s like I’ll do a read aloud or sometimes a game but it always feels awkward and just depends. 

Any other primary teachers with recommendations for that weird amount of time?? They’re so chatty, I feel like it’s impossible to actually get work done. I had originally bought them each notebooks and had planned to do interactive science and social studies notebooks at the end of the day but they’re just too talkative and none of the call and responses or points work. Some just blatantly ignore me. It also doesn’t help that I actually share the class, so I don’t have them in the AM and didn’t set up the room so things don’t feel as natural to me and I struggle to simplify procedures by modifying the space if that makes sense."

We were able to do almost all of universal in one day and there was only one ride we couldn’t use the fast pass on.  At Disney our tickets only came with 3 fast passes and you had to sign up ahead of time and possibly lost out if you signed up too late. At Hollywood studios it’d only let us use one fast pass for the major rides, so we didn’t even use one of our passes and still had to wait over an hour for rock n rollercoaster. And on top of that since you have to schedule your fast pass times we’d have to plan our day around it and sometimes walk back to parts we’d been to or just kill time.  At universal we just walked right into each one as we pleased. We didn’t get to do them again, no, but we were trying to hit as many rides as we could in one day so we didn’t mind. 

I thought it was expensive but totally worth it.  Disney’s fast pass was basically useless to us. I’d have been willing to pay what we did for universal to get the same type of fast pass at Disney."

Disney was so packed that I had my foot run over by either a stroller or an old lady in a cart but couldn’t determine who because there were so many people around me. The walkways would be literally gridlocked. Many of the rides are just “meh” and the fast pass service sucked.  Granted my SO purchased our tickets so I’m not familiar with the options, but we only got 3 fast passes per day and at Hollywood Studios we were only allowed to use it on one of the big rides. So we didn’t even use all 3 because what the actual fuck??

At Universal there was only one ride we couldn’t use it on (Hagrids motorbike) because it was brand new and the employees were telling us “Hey if you’re OK to ride separate, single rider is a way shorter wait.” So we did and it was fucking awesome. 

The food at Universal was also better imo, however we didn’t go to Epcot or Animal Kingdom at Disney and I’ve heard they have really good food. But universal is way better than magic kingdom and Hollywood studios.

Teachers,fcydyio,t1_fcx9g89,1578078626.0,"I taught first for 3 years in a catholic school and did a ton of STEM because I had control over everything I taught and my boss genuinely believed I was the expert of my grade level. My kids left first grade knowing what a hypothesis is and how to make one. 

I started at a public school this year and when I asked if there was a science or sostud curriculum I was informed they didn’t teach it in K-3 really.  All the focus is on reading and then basic math. But literally over half the day is reading, probably 75-80% of instructional time. However, like another commenter said, we spend SO MUCH TIME on emotional and social learning. They aren’t born knowing how to sit in a seat, line up quietly, line up at all really, raise their hand, etc. much less how to control their emotions and actions.  We have to teach them how to control their bodies and voices when they are confused, sad, angry, excited.  That eats up a lot of our instructional time. 

Personally, based on my experience in catholic school, I think that teaching science and STEM lends itself to engaging hands on experiences that young children need, and it is very motivating. I also think ELA instruction can easily be incorporated into STEM instruction.  But I really don’t teach science now because I don’t have time in my schedule. The 30 minutes I have at the end of the day that I’d planned to do STEM related activities is usually spent dealing with behaviors and trying to keep them calm."

I am not trolling, just curious. I’m also a K teacher who spent 3 years in private school. Looking at your profile I feel like you’re my spirit animal haha. 

Fuck those people dude. Teaching K is serious business!! You’re doing awesome!"
TrueOffMyChest,fcw0lyq,t1_fcvcle9,1578014390.0,"Nah.  I worked at a catholic school. I worked at a low to middle class catholic school where over half our student population received vouchers for free tuition from our state government.  Every teacher there was still required to have a degree and license.  Many even had masters. 

I now teach at a public school that’s low income and the majority of my families now are quite similar to those I experienced at the catholic school."
TrueOffMyChest,fcw0cyq,t1_fcusbou,1578014225.0,"Why would teaching kindergarten have anything to do with OP not being “a reliable source on anything”?

Editing because I’m getting impatient waiting for a response but, if my kindergarten teacher brain is comprehending this correctly, you’re insinuating that kindergarten teachers cannot be a reliable source on anything because... they’re kindergarten teachers? And what, they must be simple minded folk as a result?? 

Because let me tell you, I am a kindergarten teacher and I have more formal education than most people I know. I read for my job on my own time more than most people I know. Despite having a masters degree, I’m still expected to continuously educate myself on research and methods in my field.  Kindergarten teachers are a major fucking reliable source on a lot of fucking shit.  My friends who studied finance get paid more than me and are never talked down to the way I am because I’m “just a kindergarten teacher.”  Yet, I invested more money into my education so that I could get a masters, took licensure exams that I paid for, and have multiple teaching licenses that again, I PAID FOR so I could be a professional in my field. I currently have four textbooks on my desk that I am expected to read for my job this year alone, despite having four years of teaching experience under my belt and said degrees. Teachers, of any age group, are expected to be lifelong learners dedicated to continuous professional growth. We work our tails off assessing, analyzing data, and restructuring our methods and lesson plans to meet the needs of all of our students, ESPECIALLY in kindergarten. My job is to figure out WHY kids can’t read, why they can’t spell their name, why they can’t recognize any letter of the alphabet, and THEN use effective strategies to teach them the foundational skills required so they can be reading full sentences by the time they leave my class.  That’s right, they come to me not knowing a letter and it’s my job to make them a reader.  Which I do, because I am well educated on the pedagogical methods, theories, and content knowledge required to teach a child who’s a struggling reader how to read. 

So, before you ever try to diminish a kindergarten teacher’s intelligence or qualifications BECAUSE they’re a kindergarten teacher, check yourself you fucking dunce.

Editing again to add that you really shouldn’t be inserting your opinion so much on a profession that you clearly have no respect for.  I personally was willing to see your perspective in this argument up until you made the kindergarten teacher comment. Now I see everything you said as the ideas of someone who clearly had no respect for teachers and the work they do. So seriously, fuck off."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvz6j1,t1_fcu8z3q,1578013445.0,"Teacher here. I totally get that. However, like OP, I get super frustrated when people send their kids to school sick, despite knowing it’s because they can’t miss work. 

Here’s why: I’ve missed 6 days of work myself in the last 3 months because I had two colds that became laryngitis and a case of strep.  If this pattern continues I’ll end the year having used up all my sick days and then some, thus losing money myself.  I am 99.9% certain I contracted those illnesses from my students who came to school sick.  I’ve had kids throw up on my shoes, cough in my face and directly on my coffee mug, and sneeze on me. I’ve even had kids rub their damn noses on me.  Kids aren’t like adults. They don’t have the self awareness to even try to contain their germs. 

So even if you are “just surviving,” I’m sorry but it’s your responsibility as a parent to have a plan in place so that when your child is ill they will not have to go to school.  Teachers have to survive too. And like OP said, so do SO many other families."
ZeroWaste,fct81q9,t1_fct6njj,1577935333.0,I’ve read just washing in the shower and using a washcloth to rub what you can?? Something like that. But the feeling of water in my ears after a shower drives me nuts which is why I use swabs.
ZeroWaste,fct7ypn,t1_fct6hsi,1577935269.0,"But you only need one of these for your whole life unless you lose or break it!! Whereas if you keep buying cotton swabs, even if you compost them, they have to keep using resources to be produced. 

I wonder how the resources used and CO2 produced for one of these swabs versus regular swabs used over a lifetime would compare."
ZeroWaste,fcrsruo,t1_fcp5p7s,1577906132.0,"I used to use straws very frequently because I was super sensitive about the skin surrounding my mouth due to acne, so I immediately hopped on the metal straw bandwagon, but personally I don’t love them. 

First of all, washing is a bit of a pain. Second, they’re hard and I don’t like the feeling in my teeth. Third, I just don’t use straws often anymore because my skin cleared up.  I also rarely think to bring them places and just say, “No straw” instead of replacing a plastic straw with one of these and having to carry it around. They are fun looking in cocktails though. 

If you’re a frequent straw user I think the silicone ones are probably a little bit more “comfortable.”"
PublicFreakout,fcoix1r,t1_fcnb2pj,1577833351.0,"Once when I worked at Bdubs I’d gotten slammed, like full section and double sat. I stopped at this table after probably 10 minutes had gone by to ask if they’d like refills because they appeared to be done eating. This dude starts going on and on about how awful his pulled pork sandwich was (despite eating the whole thing). He spent two or three minutes bitching about it, the whole time I was nodding and apologizing and had even said, “I’m so sorry, I’ll let the kitchen know!” But that didn’t stop him, he just kept going on about it. So me, being an impatient idiot who was sick of his bitching and worried about my other tables, blurted out, “I don’t cook the food dude.”  He was pissed... so my manager comped his food. 

Two weeks later he came back, and even though he wasn’t in my section I was asked to run food to his table. He bitched about his Mac n cheese immediately after I set it down. Some people just bitch about everything."
PublicFreakout,fcohnwp,t1_fcnbn0h,1577832461.0,"I mostly agree with this. However, when I was a server at Bdubs our food came out so slow, like fucking every regularly busy night ticket times would be up to 45minutes. Expo couldn’t tray fast enough and I’d often be handed trays of cold wings and sides or ones that were kept warm but were obviously sitting there for 20 minutes.  Usually the expo worker was an overwhelmed sassy person who’d bitch at me if I even paused after getting handed a tray. Actually, I’m pretty positive I was told more than once to “serve it” when I said the food looked like crap.  And I always felt terrible but it was literally out of my hands, unless people complained and I’d have to go back and have it remade (which was often). 

10/10 do not recommend Bdubs for anything. Place fucking sucks. I just got $400 in a settlement from them though for not paying tipped employees actual minimum wage for untipped labor so that was nice."

relationship_advice,fckyycl,t3_ehkitr,1577736196.0,"I had a “best friend” exactly like this. So boy obsessed, as young as 5th grade she’d ditch me in the halls mid conversation to go talk to a boy. 

The last straw for me was when my brother died and she called me two weeks later (after making very little effort to support me in that time) to tell me her latest boy drama.  I realized she wasn’t really my friend and boys would always come first. Even when my world was collapsing around me she couldn’t stop worrying about herself and the guys she was trying to fuck. 

After that I stopped making an effort at all and was minimally responsive to her. By the time we graduated high school we weren’t friends at all.  I’ve kept up with her on social media though and since then she’s had, I don’t know, 30 boyfriends and 6 “best friends?” Shes depressed too, probably because no one wants to be friends with someone who is constantly ditching them for their newest boy toy. 
 
Point is, she never changed and this girl sounds identical. It took me a long time to realize she’d never prioritize me over her own issue of needing a guy and I wasn’t willing to deal with it anymore. 

Good for you for being upfront with her. I don’t think you’re a dick at all. Perhaps she’ll change since you called her out. But I wouldn’t blame you at all for taking a step back from the relationship. Make sure you’re cultivating other friendships instead of worrying about someone who isn’t making the same effort you are."

AskReddit,fcjehwi,t1_fcirzdi,1577684745.0,"This year I have found Christmas in general to be a waste of money and time.  Christmas is supposed to be about spending time with loved ones but it’s all about spending money and gifting and I hate it. Stop wasting money on shit people don’t want.  I’m in my mid twenties. I told my family very specific gifts or money, and said I didn’t want anything else, nothing, not even candy.  Did they listen? No. I came home with a bunch of crap I had to haul into my apartment and have no use or space for. And I feel bad because I make better money than nearly everyone else in my family so I don’t want them spending money on me. 

And then you have work gift exchanges and friend white elephants... I just wish it’d all stop.  It’s too much. It makes Christmas stressful, feeling like you need to buy buy buy for everyone, even people you don’t know well. And don’t even get me started on the trash and packaging and waste of it all."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fc73miq,t1_fc5r581,1577496644.0,"But why would they need something else as well? 

This may be an off topic rant but we have a pretty crazy culture if someone asks for a gift that costs hundreds of dollars and should still get something else just because it’s a washing machine.  New washing machines are cool AF and usually more efficient. 

My SO hasn’t bought me a physical gift in years and it doesn’t bother me at all. If we go on a trip near a holiday or birthday we consider that the gift.  I just think this mindset makes Christmas about the presents. Or did we not learn from the grinch?"

AmItheAsshole,fc4b7dw,t3_efvcg9,1577411644.0,"OP - I have mixed feelings so I’m gonna go with ESH. 

As a teacher myself it sounds like your approach may have been a bit entitled. Most teachers put in so much effort to make their classrooms a place that is conducive to everyone and I am not lying when I say I make hundreds of decisions a day.  If a parent has an issue with one of my methods I will happily do what I can to accommodate, but I prefer a parent discuss it with me in a way that recognizes that I am a professional and a partner in their child’s education, not someone who should do just whatever the parent wants  because that’s what they think is best for their child... I have a degree and license for a reason and your child isn’t the only one who’s well being I consider.   That being said, her teachers should have been open to discuss the issue with you and provide an accommodation, especially since this one seems pretty simple. You’re not asking for a lot really. 

However OP - it sounds like your daughter may have social anxiety and I recommend seeing a psychiatrist or asking her school psychologist or counselor about any resources they may have.  I was much like your daughter. I had difficulty making friends and was always the odd one out. Classmates would ask my siblings if I ever talked at home because I was painfully quiet.  It took me a long time to realize I wasn’t just “shy.”  I have an actual mental health condition that prevents me from functioning in social situations. Even as an adult I find myself nauseous and lightheaded before social events, and in high school it was so much worse.  In college I ended up seeing a therapist and it helped me immensely.  Like I said, I still struggle, and honestly I felt like therapy made me feel worse before it got better, but it did help. My therapist taught me coping skills to deal with my anxiety.   Perhaps look into books on addressing social anxiety. 

Obviously I don’t know your daughter and can’t diagnose her, BUT I wanted to point it out as a possibility. I noticed a lot of comments suggesting signing her up for activities, but that may just make her feel more isolated if she fails to make friends in those groups as well.  You won’t be able to hold her hand in college and the real world when someone isn’t nice to her or a professor makes people pick partners for a group. I think it’d be very valuable to help her find strategies for navigating these situations now rather than later!"

Some I added twine around, or used bows I’d saved.

I am (sort of) coteaching first grade this year and despite discussing the routines and expectations a zillion times, my coteacher and I have very different ideas of how things should actually be (as in my coworker doesn’t mind a messy class whereas I find it extremely distracting).
