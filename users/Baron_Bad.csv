literature,fdgluwc,t1_fddreb0,1578401684.0,"Asian man chiming in here. 

You self-admittedly fetishize Asians. Your perception is already skewed by your fixation and yet you tried to list it as some sort of credential. As if your romanticization should make you more qualified to evaluate racism when your own fetish makes you more susceptible to being influenced by said racism.

I just talked to all the other Asians and we agreed to not let you use our ancient secret magics."
todayilearned,fcse7wx,t1_fcpfygd,1577915287.0,"Cool, and where did that get you, 18 hours later? It gave you the chance to shit on someone? So was it worth it?"
aww,fcp7p5j,t1_fcos968,1577853240.0,Thanks! This was really helpful!
aww,fcp7nxm,t1_fcot4cb,1577853206.0,You're also the first person to come close with even a hypothetical explanation so thank you!
todayilearned,fcp7m6a,t1_fcp04o9,1577853159.0,"Exactly, some knowledge is inherently political and yet nobody wants to talk about it. Factually, science backs up the idea that climate change is caused by humans and will fundamentally alter the planet into a severely less habitable planet. And yet, politically, people insist that such information is false."
aww,fcp7ivp,t1_fcp053x,1577853067.0,"Oh wow, I haven't heard that song in so long. Thank you for reminding me, kind redditor!"

Clearly they would only eat at Chick-Fil-A where every sandwich comes with some free homophobia!"
aww,fcogwx6,t1_fcogto7,1577831952.0,Alleles... I kind of know that word!

I am still in 2019 though so that actually means something."

Watch his casino fold Donald, fails at his goals Donald

I hate the new Donald, racist twitter mood Donald

The always rude Donald, spaz in the news Donald

I miss the sweet Donald, has the orange feets Donald

I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Donald

But the alt-right re-invented Donald, it wasn't any Donalds

And now I look and look around and there's so many Donalds

I used to love Donald, I used to love Donald

I even had the fake hair, I thought I was Donald

What if Donald made a song about Donald

Called ""I Miss The Old Donald, "" man that would be so Donald

That's all it was Donald, nobody loves Donald

Only one that loves Donald is gotta be Donald, hahaha"
mildlyinteresting,fcof8n2,t3_ei9ec2,1577830801.0,Even the fucking Nike's... This makes me uncomfortable. Like the idea that every person has a physical doppelganger that looks exactly like them in every way? This is like that but different.
todayilearned,fcoes3l,t1_fcoenni,1577830484.0,"Look, I totally agree with you. But I've seen them ban things less political than this. I think it fucking sucks, I really do. This subreddit sucks. LGBT+ issues deserve a spotlight and I think what the TIL mods do is wrong."
funny,fcoejb7,t1_fcod7ia,1577830310.0,"I work in IT and I would get so mad when people would call me a ""computer guru"" because that implies there is any mysticism behind what I do. Motherfucker, if you just learned how to attach a pdf file to an email then what I did wouldn't look so much like magic."
todayilearned,fcoefgb,t3_ei90bm,1577830235.0,"Now watch the fucking mods ban this for being ""too political"".

EDIT: [Why are you booing me? I'm right!](https://i.imgur.com/ixVepyT.png) I wish I wasn't but I've seen the mods ban things that were much less political. I disagree with what they're doing but they still do it."

aww,fcoe4gs,t3_ei8u4j,1577830021.0,Can anyone tell me what can cause something like this? This is so interesting and distinct and I want to know where I can find more information.
