offmychest,ff4kj3z,t3_erhisj,1579565833.0,"I would say cheating is not socially acceptable. Cheating is arguably a biological imperative or instinct, though (hence it being so common). I mean, are you attracted to just one person? I'm not. I'm attracted to many people. Doesn't mean I will cheat, but the temptation is there because that's human nature.

Consensual non-monogamy is a thing these days (swinging, open relationships, threesomes etc). But that's separate from cheating because there is honesty, communication and consent. Personally, I think it's refreshing - let's not kid ourselves and pretend we only want to have sex with one person the rest of our lives (lots of people will claim they could never possibly want anyone else but I think they're lying)"
truechildfree,ff42bvv,t3_ereumu,1579554011.0,"I think taking the decision not to bring another child into this vastly overpopulated world is an act of love in itself! Really, these people need to consider what they're actually advocating. At which point will we stop popping out kids with thoughtless abandon? I notice people are almost always talking about biological kids rather than adoptive ones when they make these statements. Speaks volumes."

offmychest,fekvmj0,t3_epndfj,1579208527.0,"""If you no longer want to create pain for yourself, if you no longer want to add to the past pain that still lives in you, then don't create any time, or at least no more time than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects of your life. How do you stop creating time? Realise deeply that the present moment is all you ever will have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life... What could be more futile, more insane, than to resist what already is?

The pain wants to survive, and it can only survive if it gets you to identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, 'become you' and live through you... Once the pain has taken over you, you want more pain. You become the victim or the perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. Of course, you will claim vehmently that you do not want pain, but look closely and you will find that your thinking and behaviour are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others... (pain's) survival depends on your identification with it, as well as your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. If you don't face it, you will be forced to relive it again and again... It may seem like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you it's an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of presence""

I know it might sound a bit airy-fairy and strange, but this book is changing my outlook on life. It has been helping me through a very dark and depressive time, and I'd encourage anyone to give it a chance. I also enjoy his YouTube channel."

dating_advice,fcs8p1k,t3_eii7pe,1577913018.0,"Female here. I've been in your situation - invited to a gathering and then ignored while he spoke to everyone else in the room - really hurtful, actually.

In your case, she most likely sees you as a boost to her ego. From what you've said, it sounds like she's playing a game and enjoys your attention - but only when it's convenient to her. If this is how this person behaves in the early stages, imagine them in a relationship. I think you're right - she doesn't sound ready or emotionally mature enough to date."

AnxiousAttachment,fcf3zx0,t3_eh5c3f,1577626385.0,"This is why we have to do some intensive and hard healing work before going anywhere near a romantic relationship, in my opinion. We can change our attachment habits - it just takes time, research, therapy and effort! I have heard psychologists say it's like a grieving process - letting go of the ""old you"" and your habituated patterns, and allowing yourself to develop new ones. Change is not easy, but possible."
running,fcetgz0,t3_eh2yoy,1577623601.0,"Either a phone app that allows you to set goals and better yourself or running as part of a group of supportive people :) I find seeing my time improve or distance increase and keeping a record of that on an app very uplifting. Being around other people is great for moral support and encourages you to actually get out of the house, even when you don't feel like it.

Also - realising that running is free and I'm not forking out for a gym/swim membership is quite motivating!"

AnxiousAttachment,fc9sl8k,t3_eggpme,1577557592.0,"I believe anxious attachment develops in childhood when parents are inconsistent with their kids - they're present and nurturing sometimes - but other times they're not. They're ***emotionally*** inconsistent and this creates a lot of confusion for the child. Perhaps the parent is frequently distracted, extremely busy, depressed or struggling with substance addiction and unable to engage with the child properly, for example. 

The child, therefore, learns they must fight for the attention of their parent(s) - they don't have a strong sense of self and security. They may subconsciously feel something is wrong or lacking within themselves, that they are not good enough and they need to 'prove' themselves to other people for their emotional needs to be met. This pattern often repeats in dating, as an adult, where the person becomes dependent on the ""other"" for emotional validation - even if the object of their affection is unavailable or disinterested. It's like you abandon yourself and lose yourself in the pursuit of someone else - if that makes any sense. For example, you might ignore blatant red flags in the other person - in doing so, abandoning yourself and your own needs, because you just want so much for that person to love and validate you.

From what I understand, to remedy this, you're supposed to develop a stronger sense of self and learn to meet your own needs. It requires understanding who you are and what you need. Realising you're an adult and therefore don't need to depend heavily on others for validation is a critical part of the process. I believe this can take a long time but it's important work. Working with a therapist and studying self-soothing and affirmation techniques has been helpful for me. CBT techniques also useful.

However, I'm not a therapist myself or qualified in any way - this is just what I've learned from studying the subject and going through therapy myself. So could you talk to a therapist or counsellor about this for clarification in your situation?"
family,fc682e3,t3_egejns,1577474424.0,"You're an adult. Separating from your parents and making your own decisions is vital for your own mental health. What they're doing sounds controlling - they're trying to make you feel guilty, you say. 

You could literally pack your bags and leave right now. Why don't you? You are the captain of your own ship."
sex,fbicnjg,t3_edk1py,1576897173.0,"Personally, it'd be a dealbreaker for me. Of course, people go through phases where they don't have a lot of sex - that's ok. For example, life can get stressful and people just aren't in the mood. But if you're consistently not on the same page sexually it might be time to reconsider whether you're actually compatible in the long run."
