BeautyBoxes,fevm4rd,t3_eqm4bz,1579398975.0,I’m really regretting not buying one of these now. Looks awesome!

MandelaEffect,fdbuf3t,t1_fdaxjio,1578262180.0,"Same. I vividly remember learning the word cornucopia in grade school around Thanksgiving time, and remember later seeing that logo and understanding that what was pictured was a cornucopia. So weird."
cats,fcrhur1,t1_fcrhcan,1577902018.0,Thank you. He is definitely very pampered and has my female cat as his best friend. Never a dull moment at my place
cats,fcrfun4,t1_fcq9wxj,1577901275.0,100% agreed. I say this all the time because my boyfriend and I ended up with a fluffy orange boi that was abandoned at our apartment complex. Every day I look at him and can’t fathom how someone could view him as disposable
cats,fcreku1,t3_eijdii,1577900780.0,What a darling little kitty!
childfree,fcofli3,t3_ei6fq8,1577831049.0,This is so spot on. Single people pay so much more taxes only to get less help than anyone. I experienced this myself before as well. I don’t have any kids and owed almost $500 in taxes last year while the other two women in my office got thousands back for a refund just because they have kids. Even though we all make similar incomes. It was infuriating
AsianBeauty,fckrtyx,t1_fckejk0,1577731821.0,Oh definitely. I love mugwort. Holika holika has a nice facial cleanser with mugwort. Got a sample of it and was hooked
AsianBeauty,fckrqsp,t1_fckr8my,1577731768.0,Same here! Would only use them if I was going swimming and I’d always feel so gross afterwards and would have to exfoliate to feel normal again
AsianBeauty,fcknwbd,t3_ehibig,1577729403.0,"Dr Jart ceramidin cream. I got some in a set I ordered and oh my goodness, it really helps with moisture on cold, windy days"
AsianBeauty,fcknsid,t1_fckhmn8,1577729336.0,Completely agreed. I never realized how far the western world is behind in the sunscreen game until I tried Korean sunscreens.
NeckbeardNests,fckm5ct,t3_efjsmm,1577728328.0,Great job!
NeckbeardNests,fcklswm,t3_egfn9j,1577728116.0,I’m feeling sick today and was bummed about not feeling up to cleaning. I stumbled upon this subreddit and I’m no longer bummed. Thanks reddit.
funkopop,fckjbr8,t1_fckj7rk,1577726585.0,You’re very welcome
funkopop,fckisqr,t3_ehnbaz,1577726257.0,"Oh my, this is amazing"
blackcats,fcikegr,t3_eh6t7l,1577664034.0,Pretty kitty!
AmItheAsshole,fcfaop7,t3_eh3i79,1577628114.0,NTA. I wouldn’t tell anyone either if I inherited money because every person I know would be asking for some.
kbeauty,fc5asl5,t3_eg95qk,1577451417.0,The beauty breakdown. I think her real name is Morgan Stewart.
MandelaEffect,fc4ec55,t3_eg4tnx,1577414205.0,I remember the reflection also
MUAontheCheap,fc0h9uc,t1_fbzp3iq,1577290813.0,"Thank you, you seem very kind. I should have known mentioning Jeffree would cause a stir, wasn’t thinking tbh. Oh well, I will still comment and enjoy this sub regardless. Have a Merry Christmas!"
MUAontheCheap,fbzadeb,t3_ef71u8,1577240129.0,Just used this towards the jeffree star morphe palette. Thank you!
Catswithjobs,fbye90p,t1_fbydma4,1577214699.0,HAHA
AmItheAsshole,fbu104c,t1_fbtovqe,1577104944.0,"Totally confused as to why this is being downvoted. You are absolutely right. In many countries, it is not a choice and if they refuse can be punished for it."
