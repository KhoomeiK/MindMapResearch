What's in question is mutual recognition. Essentially, the EU recognises Canadian and Japanese safety and quality standards and allows Canadian and Japanese bodies to certify goods heading for the EU.

This should be trivial to do for the UK as the existing regulatory framework is the EU's own regulatory framework. 

However, since the UK has specifically stated that it would like to leave said regulatory framework we can really only offer a deal where EU institutions double check if UK goods are up to code, until such a time where the UK has established its own regulations and we're satisfied that these are on an acceptable level. 

We know what Canadian regulations look like. We know what Japanese regulations look like and we still have clauses in place that force them, and force us to maintain our very high standards. If the UK was able to agree that they would not be lowering it's standards, this would be a non issue, but they can't agree to that, because lowering standards is a likely part of a UK-US trade deal. 

Why does this make the title misleading? Because it's not a worse deal. It's a different deal. If the UK could agree to higher standards and still didn't get mutual recognition, that's a worse deal, seeing as the UK isn't, what they're getting is a fair compromise. They can sell their goods, but need EU bodies to certify them under EU standards.

There's a somewhat reasonable fear that a lot of GDP growth in the last decades is based on consumers going into debt, effectively subsidizing the economy. As long as people keep spending, everything is fine. If however, people were to stop spending and start saving, the gap between that day and the day they could actually afford the goods they are now buying on credit would severely hurt every industry dealing in non essential goods and services. 

However, if we ever get to a point where people have more debt than they can afford to pay back, we get the Housing bubble except on a much, much larger scale.

Games Workshop frequently screws any semblance of balance. The rules are fiddly and unintuitive. Turns are long, terrain is crucial for an interesting battle but is super hard to do in a way that's not unfair to certain factions or if it's symmetrical, to certain deployment areas, and worst of all, by virtue of being a turn based game, the first mover advantage is real. 

Since both armies start with the same point values and should theoretically be balanced, the side that shoots first is at a massive advantage as they're facing less firepower when it's the other side's turn. While this is a part of the game and the rolles can be flipped via good placement and game modes can mitigate the advantage, I've seen all to many games be over on turn 1 followed by 3 to 4 turns of cleanup.

europe,fe8r28c,t1_fe8h26w,1578929628.0,"The issue is complex.

Having the backing of the US obviously makes us safer. However it also makes us reliant on the US which is bad as it gives them negotiating power disproportionate to their economic influence, which is already considerable.

It also currently makes us less safe because if there's a chance that the US might not use it's assets to protect us (regardless of the actual outcome) other hostile power might decide this was a good time to take advantage of that. Mind you, even if they're wrong and the US rolls in and they lose the war, there was still a war and it was still fought on European soil. 

Furthermore, it has become clear, especially after the end of the cold war, that the US is using it's EUropean assets not as a defensive force, but rather as a base of operations with the goal of projecting power in the middle east. 

However, should we get our own military, one proportional to our gdp and size, we run into some issues as well.

First, money. Not having to spend it on defense is nice. Yes, one can argue that spending it on defence is more akin to wasting it on defense given the position of relative safety we've been in, but it's always nice to know that we do in fact have a massive war machine, on a scale byond anything that ever existed in the history of humanity, that's on our side, when deciding defense is a safe line item to cut.

Second. Having a massive military means being tempted to use it. It's nice to imagine that we're now peaceful by nature, but the simple fact is that every European country that has a relevant military is using it offensively, except for those directly under threat by larger powers (Greece and Poland) When we do build a serious military, it's all but guaranteed that we'll end up using it for things other than defence.

Finally, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If we build a serious military, Russia will have to react, Turkey will likely feel pressured to react, China and India will take notice and most dangerously of all, the US will find it self in a position where it's still the strongest military power, but now is no longer unassailable. It now has an army in the same league of it's own both to the West and to the East. Essentially, we're back to playing the game of great powers.

If the rest of the world think the EU and US are close, everyone else has to make an immediate decision. Ether they accept Western hegemony for the foreseeable future or they band together in opposition. If the world thinks the EU and US are at odds, suddenly we might be looking at a multipolar world with a web of alliances, with factions trying to get a favorable position against each other. 

But then, if we don't properly arm ourselves, those same things might still happen, but with us as the prize, very much like what happened during the Cold war."

Everyone knew London was the spider in the middle of the web of a web of tax havens, but the Panama Papers spelt it out. Law firms, accounting firms and banks, all from the City are behind the tax evasion in the Caymans, the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, the Isle of Man, the Bahamas, the Bermudas and are also working closely with Hong Kong and Singapore.

The Virgin Island alone hosted over 100,000 of Mossack Fonseca's (the Panama law firm in the center of the scandal)  clients and over 30,000 were in the UK proper.
