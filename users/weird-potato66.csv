But my weekend wasn't so good, and now this week I made exercise only 1 time, my work productivity went down and I got drunk everyday... Bad week here, dont have will even to get out of bad so working has been hard as hell. I come just cause I don't wanna get fired.  
It happens. High and low all the time, sometimes we just can't do what we want. Just gotta fight this and make tiny steps forward until we get on our feet again."

I was in his place too and I say it's not easy if he is in love with you. The only cure is a time off to think and put his feelings in the right place, then start over the friendship again."

depression,fdqkdht,t1_fdpza70,1578668780.0,"Buddy, may I ask you how older are you?  
It's normal in our condition to think you're not welcome, but if they invited you it's because they wanted you there. It was just a coincidence maybe that there wasn't enough places for everytone to sit together.

Another thing, you gotta put yourself in sometimes too. No one will keep calling and taking care of you all the time. Be yourself man, don't keep holding yourself all the time. If you're there, do your thing, be yourself.  
I have social anxiety, I know it's pretty hard, there's a lot of shame and bad thoughts, but just be yourself.  
It's ok not to say anything too if you don't.

And go back to therapy. Can be very helpful. Don't be ashamed to ask your parents to go back there. It's pretty normal having mental issues, it's not that different to have a physical disease."

Your advices are really a good idea, I can't say I actually have thought about it, discover new things and all, by myself. I am always depending on people to do things or make me happy. Definetely not a good idea for a lonely person.

I am trying hard to believe the part of being someone's true love, but you know, seems impossible right now.

I was told by my therapist to go see a doctor in 2018 but I didn't go there yet... Maybe it's really a good idea..

I didn't overcome this totally yet, but I think its kinda under control right now, bc I don't give my best efforts to it, I am just obliged cause I want a better body, beer gave me a fat belly.

Yea, I am planing to wait a bit to tell her, at least after new year and stuff. Try to gatter more information too, maybe discover if she has feelings as I do too... And to see if I will keep loving her.  My only fear is to wait too much and things get too cold for us.

You have a point, maybe its better risk than to suffer for something that doesn't exist. I gota create the better timing, or it will never come.

 I think about saying it in person, but it can ruin completely the day for us. And if not, I think would be wrong to kiss her if she's still not single, and declaring without getting these physical contact seems very frustrating too. So idk..."

I want to dig some more information first, trying to discover if  she feels the same way or if there's any chance her current relationship is in a bad shape, having any chance she is becoming single soon.

About the itch metaphor, you're absolutely right. I passed throught this one time already, thank you for remind me of these, I gotta pay more attetion not to fall to this again. As u said, I really like her company and all but I stopped being 100% happy about it when started to think about the feelings.

I don't know her for so long, but nowdays relationships tend not to last for so long, and I gattered some info from her that they have some important uncompatible ideas, but I have these ideas as same as she does, like not having children, same hobbies to spend time together, etc. So waiting a few months to see if I still feel the same and declare myself may be an option, but not for long.

Life surely isn't even a little bit fair. But at least 1 thing I know: she really likes me as a friend. Not sure if can or has scalate to more than that, tho.

Thanks again."

She passed me the impression of being loyal to him, I don't think she's a cheater, but sometimes she kinda let it out some really sweet words and acts too when I saw her in person, so I started to suspect a little that she might have a secret crush on me too. 

But of course, I can't ask her to leave him, I plan to do as you said if I decide to tell her about my feelings.

I am glad things  ended well for you. I know I can't consider this the end of world, but in the last few years almost everything is the end of the world. I am really tired of being sad and depressed all the time. Now I found some relieve and affection from her, I don't wanna lose that."
relationship_advice,fbapohc,t1_fban5zz,1576684009.0,"I see. Thanks for sharing. I am sorry for you that things didn't go so well initially.

 I must say that I can relate to that. Already happened something like this to me, was exactly the motive which made me want not to have feelings. 2 years investing on her, than almost a year without any contact to really forget the girl (not the girl I mentioned in the post, an earlier one).  
Only now I met this new girl who is really compatible and nice to me, and now I see I could be moving into the vicious cycle again.. I know her for less than 6 months, tho.  
I'll consider all your advices. I hope I can manage not to suffer for years in this one."
