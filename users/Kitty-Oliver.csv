bipolar,fddunyj,t3_ekr6eu,1578324409.0,Medication can help make episodes less frequent and less sever but they still might come. I’m on abilify but I still get episodes. Today I woke up feeling like life is not worth living but here I am at work tending to my responsibilities anyway. Hope you feel better. Maybe talk to your psychiatrist and let them know that you’re still having symptoms.
bipolar,fcxjj3m,t3_ejcx3c,1578064488.0,It’s happened to me on a few mixed episodes where I’ll be so damn happy and excited about everything that I can’t contain myself but also sobbing at the same time because I just want to die
bipolar,fcxizb8,t1_fcxh12a,1578064108.0,That’s the last thing I would want
bipolar,fcrmlnh,t3_eijo68,1577903783.0,Perfect timing! Just finished watching alias grace so I’m glad to have a new show to watch :)
bipolar,fc5d11q,t1_fc4npvu,1577453807.0,I really don’t know yet :( I’ll probably go out untill 11
bipolar,fc3ii81,t1_fc3hqeg,1577390543.0,It’s very uncomfortable
bipolar,fc3c76u,t1_fc3b3kf,1577386569.0,"That’s cool that you’re willing to go out by yourself, use that opportunity to make friends too! 

I have the same issue with NYE. My fiancé is working till 11pm that day and I really wanna go out and do something fun instead of going to my parents house to fall asleep on their couch. I wanna go out and do something fun and exciting but I also feel obligated to wait at home for him to have the midnight kiss. And he doesn’t want to go out afterwards he just wants to hang out at his parents house which is not what I am interested in. So I’m at a loss of what to do too."
bipolar,fc38jo8,t3_efpw8m,1577384047.0,If I’m starting to get racing thoughts I know that I’m in trouble
bipolar,fbxt2ud,t3_eeyq0c,1577199766.0,My parents are the same. They are skeptical of doctors and think I am making it all up. My mom blames my depression on a “unhealthy diet” and try’s to force feed me supplements to “cure me”. It can be really frustrating but at the end of the day what they think is not what matters. What matters is that you are doing what you need to do to Lead the best life possible.
bipolar,fbc6uql,t1_fbc315t,1576717085.0,I almost associate this to racing thoughts
