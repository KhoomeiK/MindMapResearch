AskMen,fekfg3q,t1_fek7ozd,1579198926.0,"Its more in the realm of self improvement, there is always something to improve on, and it just becomes so much easier when you're with someone you love, you push harder and further, and you get a second perspective.

of course its still important to love them for who they are and not for who they can become, but we should still seek to improve ourselves, and significant others help a lot with that."

depression,fdn7v3s,t1_fdm9day,1578579662.0,"I feel like that is part of depression though, like it tells you nothing is ever anything you want to complete start to finish, at-least when you look at the bigger picture, the goals you're trying to reach, just seeming so far away."

depression,fd7vm0s,t1_fd7nibf,1578210816.0,"It holds emotional weight, because it just does, we're not in control of our emotions, we can only control how we act on it, but it still fucking hurts to know you're best-friend didn't even take into consideration your feelings before making a move, they don't have to, but its respectful and a nice thing to do, since we all know it takes time to heal from a break up.

Its not Important for friends to not fuck exes, its important for friends to be considerate and respectful to each other, and that goes for everything in a friendship."
depression,fd7mqb0,t1_fd76tb7,1578206857.0,"Its called communicating, and respect.

You don't ask if you can fuck them or not, you just ask them if its OK with them, and what will happen with the friendship if they do pursue the ex.

It's not restricting anybody unless they explicitly say so, its just letting people know how they feel and what possible consequences can happen."
depression,fd7m24s,t1_fd76sim,1578206566.0,"Exactly, I've got nothing against friends dating exes n stuff, but do the honorable thing and ask them first, or atleast wait til they're out of the hospital.

The friend sounds like someone who would help a future GF cheat on you given the chance, its best to really reevaluate the friendship, maybe it was really a mistake, or the guy knew they hadn't broken up, or maybe just didn't care, best to talk to him about tbh."

depression,fcsnbzz,t1_fcsi5g9,1577920289.0,"There is truth in your words, but I've been like this my whole life, I've never fit the mold, I've always been an outcast of society, either I'm killing myself at 25 or I'm disappearing into the forest trying to live like a hunter gatherer like I dreamed of as a kid.

Also when it comes to love it would be unfair to her if she wanted a stable and loving family when she was older, I believe I'm loving, but I'm just not stable, letting a girl fall in love with me would seem unfair to her, robbing her of a possible better future without ever knowing me.

Even if I wasn't depressed, I know I'm not fit for the modern world, I can't study through college, get a career, have a family, then die, it just isn't me, I'd love a wife and child, but the cost of that seems to be sacrificing myself.

I'm just destined to be like this, I'll never fit in society."

SuicideWatch,fc0caa6,t1_fbzqkvl,1577286670.0,"I kinda agree with OP, maybe not as harshly, but its difficult to enjoy stuff when Anhedonia kicks in and you've got no future to look forwards to.

I think the problem really is that, we don't want to live, life has been and seemingly will always be shit, so why bother if you've never known anything else and you're hopeless? At most we just don't want to die, so we're just stuck in this miserable limbo with no energy to get out of it."
depression,fbvpmu6,t1_fbvhjj5,1577134244.0,">I feel like my classmates and ""friends"" are the reasons why I'm depressed. I can't think of a pleasant memory I had in high school :/

I feel you, the only positive memory I have from school is this one random girl who stood up for me when my brother and his friends was calling me a weirdo for ripping of the sides of my bologna sandwich so it would be fully square.

That was in like 3rd grade though lol.

My worst memory was being publicly rejected by a crush infront of the entire class, I can still hear their laughter, I don't resent her though, I was too socially anxious to actually talk with her so eventually she had enough of me staring at her like a total creep, it was kinda harsh but deserved tbh."
