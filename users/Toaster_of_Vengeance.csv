Libertarian,fcwzvhh,t1_fcwtsl4,1578044900.0,"Did you just imply that all abortions are from rape victims? I think you'll find, if you actually research it, that rape makes up an almost negligible percentage of abortions. It is ALWAYS up to woman to have sex, and therefore risk having a child. To imply otherwise removed all agency from women. 

And holy shit, the cumming in a sock is genocide argument. Think about that for two seconds. If I leave my semen in my balls, will it turn into a baby? If a women didnt have her period, would her eggs turn into a baby? No? Then how on earth is that any kind of a rational argument?

You consent to the possibility of having a child when you have sex. You know where babies come from. You know the risks. You have a choice. If you cant handle the risks, dont engage in risky behavior. I'm sorry that you cant live your hedonistic life without consequences or repercussions of any kind, but we live in reality.

todayilearned,fcsrxwu,t1_fcrjtdn,1577923583.0,"You've made several assumptions about what I do and what I believe. I never mentioned a soul, and honestly, if you can't tell that I'm not religious from my original comment, you didnt read what I said. 

It is however curious that you say ""chance of life"" and then also say ""chance of a cure"". I'm curious why you think that one ""chance"" is more important than another especially considering one is an extension of life already lived, and another is a life just beginning. 

Here's the thing though. Consciousness is not the arbiter of life. A tree is alive, but does it have a consciousness? But obviously a tree is not a living human being, while an unborn child is. It exhibits all the characteristics of the literal definition of life. And even more damning, it is genetically separate from the mother. It has unique DNA. It has from conception. You know what doesnt have unique DNA, or the ability to, if left alone, develop into a full formed human being that even you cant deny deserves rights? That ""load you blown into a napkin"", but good try. 

Never heard of an abortion past 6 months being called stillbirth, pretty sure you made that up. 

Also not sure why you think that ""viability"" is any kind of indicator. Does that mean that personhood has slowly, over the centuries of medical advances, began earlier and earlier? That's so cool, maybe some day we can get to viability at conception. 

Gosh, you just say so many terrible things... some pregnancies ending prematurely is somehow justification for ending more? Please change fetus in that thought to baby. Imagine being mad that someone is against the Nazis performing medical experiments on prisoners because ""think of the people it could help"". You're sick.

Finally, I love the ""you're only pro birth, not pro life"" argument. No, I'm against all murder. I'm against you being murdered. I'm against people I've never met being murdered. If you're a person, I dont want you to be murdered."
