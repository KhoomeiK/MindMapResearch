AlAnon,fbwhdfa,t3_eesbn7,1577149967.0,"My husband is in recovery - he's 60 days sober after 60 days in an intensive outpatient program. The counselors in the program STRONGLY advise no alcohol in the house and no drinking from me in the home or outside of it, at least during early recovery.

My husband and I have agreed to that, with the exception that if I'm out with a friend for lunch or something, it's okay to have a drink or two, as long as I'm not coming home intoxicated with alcohol on my breath. It's a fine line, so I haven't had a drink in three weeks, as much as I would like to pop out and have a glass of wine at a nearby pub.

I'm supporting my husband, and I know how difficult this is for him. I'm not interested in making it harder. As time goes on, he will have to learn how to navigate environments where there is drinking, but that's for when he has more sober time under his belt.

It's like if he had a peanut allergy. I love peanut butter, but I'm not going to have it in the house knowing it could kill him."
