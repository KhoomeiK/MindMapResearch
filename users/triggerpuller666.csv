I challenge anyone reading this to actually read through it and tell me if utilized properly that the physical training outlined in that manual is ineffective. There's weight training in there. Climbing drills. Core exercises. It's already gospel, the Army just didn't make any believers. The harsh reality is that certain things are needed if you follow that manual to a T, and seeing how literally not a single unit follows it properly across the Army, I can only assume that it will remain the official FM for PT until the brass figure out how to put out a training regimen the entire force can and will get on board with. It really does say a lot that it has been roundly ignored for almost a decade, yet a lot of what is actually in there was studied and based off science and data. *shrugs*"
