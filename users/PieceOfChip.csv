gaming,ff41uv5,t1_ff3gvef,1579553720.0,"This is the most immersive way of playing Skyrim. May favorite play through by far.

1. Turn off the HUD
2. Put it on Easy Mode
3. Go around as stealth archer.
4. Do not wear armor. But dress up in fine clothing. Makes it more difficult on (Easy Mode).
5. Make it realistic with a few arrows instead of hundreds into one bandit.
6. Use the map to coordinate where locations are and know locations by heart.

This is the best way I have played Skyrim out of how many playthroughs.

You should try this out. Especially if you smoke pot."

No one wants a war, but when you attack the American people, you are getting what you deserved. It's like standing up to a bully. Whatever these people are telling you, ignore them. Trump is serious about his country and his people. He is not going to try to attack innocent people. He wants to get rid of the evil that has been corrupting your country for so long. Why do you think y'all are in a bunch of shit for 40 years? Iran, Iraq used to be a westernized, educated region of the middle east until the assholes showed up to ruin the whole thing. If you are so scared, come to America legally and we will take care of you."
