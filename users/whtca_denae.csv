Your basic school shooter video that you've watched since middle school, maybe high school. But like you never if your body will freeze up. If you'll get a boost of adrenaline. It doesn't matter how many times I've watched that video, I could probably quote it at this point, being in that situation is a very different feeling than watching a video on it. 

It's one of the things that keeps me up at night when I let my mind wander from thought to thought, situation to situation. I knew the likelihood of it happening is high, but it's still that tiny chance that someone will try to commit that heinous crime."
walmart,felyoc5,t3_epjs87,1579234332.0,"??? At my store, maybe this is because we've quite a few people being fired and quiting, our csms are allowed to move to be department heads or move teams and that stuff. Maybe after the initial move for some of ours then itll be the culling? Honestly at this point I have no idea what's going on and it probably shows"
kpop,fefseod,t3_eot1z5,1579063795.0,"These people are why I hate stan culture. Stuff like this is almost normalized from the amount of articles we see and how often the 'fans' are able to get away with it (take pinky who is a 'fan' of SVT's joshua). These people have no regard for personal space and are too far up their own ass and in lalala land trying plan a fictional wedding or building their creepyass shine that they refuse to see the utter disgust and fear in their 'faves' eye.

Remember kids, do not be obsessive or possessive bc you may end up like these sasaengs"

worldnews,fd0j3tw,t3_ejlpqn,1578119548.0,It's gotten to the point where when I saw this headline I didnt flinch. I wasnt surprised. Just went 'huh I guess we are at that point.'
college,fd0g1ts,t3_ejeuio,1578118271.0,"I was scared.

I was scared to start a new chapter. I scared of the debt, moving away and living in a different city. So I took a gap year, calmed my nerves and thought about applying, but I still had money in the back of my brain. So I applied to a nearby uni, I'm still in the major I want, even learning a couple new things that i wasnt expecting to.

I just kinda let reality sink in and if I really wanted to go to my dream school, I can always transfer or and a big ass or if I have enough money I'll go there and get a masters"
college,fczvpyb,t1_fcwqjk4,1578109423.0,"Yep. I havent got a meal plan in a minute but I'll try to explain ours the best I can.

So our meal plans are basically rounding your foods up to 7 dollars (drink, entree and a snack or two). The meal plan itself would be a specific amount of this deal for the entire semester, 25 or 40 or 50 so on and so forth. And anything over that 7 dollar amount you would just pay out of pocket for that bit, unless you had uni cash and just used that. 
For on campus students I knew, a lot of them got a 3 or 2 meal per day plan (but this left them with a lot of points at the end of semester they had to use in the college bookstore or just offer to buy random people some food)"
college,fcwjvf5,t3_ej3dps,1578027610.0,"If youre a commuter, no. But I think if you live on campus its required. It doesn't matter if you get the cheapest or most expensive tho, they just want you to buy a plan
