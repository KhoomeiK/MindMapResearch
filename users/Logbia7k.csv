WeightLossAdvice,fdnzsaj,t3_em3iv3,1578596175.0,"1. Keto = bad. Off course you burn a lot of fat, but it's not healthy at all, it's an extreme diet that kinda makes your body sick by not providing what it needs (carbs), so that the body is forced to use other sources. These sickness signs are a warning signal of your body to start eating normally again. Carbs are NOT bad, only the simple ones like cookies and candies. It's not bad to eat a little less carbs, but just don't take it into the extreme as with keto.
2. healthy snacks are: Some whole grain food like muesli without too much added sugar (look on the box), fruits and maybe nuts (not too many).
3. That's totally up to what you like. Don't force yourself into something you don't like.
4. It doesn't really matter, most important is to find a good balanced diet and one that you can stick too. All diets come down to one thing only: Eat less in general. How you do that, is different for everyone. 1000 calories is too low really, Females should at least 1500 each day to keep their body functioning. Probably some more if you feel low energy.
5. Weight loss is usually around 0.5-1Kg each week. That is healthy. You could lose a hell lot more in the first week if you eat less carbs, but then you mostly lose water, not fat, because fiber binds towards water in your body. it will eventually flat out and your weight loss will slow down."
