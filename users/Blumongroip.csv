Fallout,ff7twen,t1_ff7tn0d,1579658257.0,"They're trying to find a livable vault, so they go to one they know about, find it uninhabitable, trudge through it looking for more information on other vaults, and if they have the time, save the world or something. P.S. I have never planned a campaign, so take everything I say with a large grain of salt"
Fallout,ff7tg9r,t1_ff7t5r5,1579657947.0,"Well, from the timeline of the vault, its most likely they left sometime around 20-30 years after being sealed in. Maybe they could be looking for another vault to take them in? It would also be a great was to add more vaults in as dungeons, making them explore them for the location of other vaults."

Fallout,ff7rp5w,t3_erxl05,1579656732.0,"I used to file with about 5 or so ideas, but they were on my old computer that died. The only one I remember it one I dubbed ""the fire vault"". 

In the pre-war times, it was designed to test the effects of fire in enclosed spaces on the dwellers. The gas lines where prone to leaking, the wiring was sub stander, most of the vault had no functioning fire supervision systems, the fireproofing was shoddily done or outright ""forgotten"" and he vault Mr. Handy was bugged to use its flamer in any situation it found. 

Shortly after the vault closed and the new dwellers started to settle in, a massive fire started after the Mr. Handy was instructed to help with the wash. Overseer Arthur order a diagnostic of the Mr. Handy, a complete inspection of the vault infrastructure and an inventory on the damage done by the fire.

 When the reports came back they realized the that vault-tec lied to them, and this vault was never intended to house life long term. Without access to the outside world nor the proper materials to properly fix everything, overseer Arthur ordered that the most structurally sound parts of the vault to be reinforced with parts salvaged from the unburned parts of the vault. During deconstruction three more fires broke out, resulting in major loss of material and personal. After managing to secure a safe section of the vault overseer Arthur declared to seal off the burned sections of the vault, hopping to prevent any more disasters. However the burned sections soon became breeding grounds for mole rats, which then invaded the secure section of the vault, looking for food and spreading disease. 

With everything crumbling down around him, Arthur concluded that the only hope of escape wat to try and override the vaults timed locks and leave forever. By this time, only a handful of dweller remained, and none of them had the expertise to attempt to hack some of the highest security in the vault. With all options now gone, the vault held a vote and decided to reactivate the Mr. Handy that started it all to try and activate  the door. The Mr. Handy had undergone some homemade software updates before the head engineer perished in one of the fires, and the remaining survivors agreed it was the best bet for escape. And so, the Mr. Handy was active, lead to the vault door and instructed the attempt a manual override on the controls. Did they make it out?... well, I'll leave that up to you."
