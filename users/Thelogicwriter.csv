lgbt,ff6u22g,t1_ff6tyil,1579634883.0,They really did. Me and my friends were so happy to hear her say these things.
socialanxiety,fdinn28,t3_eljob3,1578446942.0,Same with me. I ask my dad to go to a school dance with one of my friends. Once we got their i immediately went to the bleachers and sat behind them. I did scare a lot of people like that because they didn't expect to see someone back there. a guy asked me out but i said no.

learntodraw,fd02g8y,t1_fczy4cs,1578112653.0,Thanks.
socialanxiety,fcwjsxd,t3_ej9svi,1578027554.0,You look pretty cute with those glass and this is coming from an asexual who doesn't think any one is cute in general.
mentalillness,fcmdpsq,t1_fcm8ywb,1577771592.0,I don't. After taking a quiz a research the mental disorder to see if it actually applies to me. I would love to get help but my dad doesn't think i have a mental disorder. I want to talk to a teacher but I'm afraid of what they will say to my dad and how he will react.
mentalillness,fcm1gbv,t1_fcm13uh,1577761750.0,I don't. Every time i see i might have a strong indication of a mental disorder i always do my research and see if it appeals to me.  And i can't see a therapist because i don't really have any one to take me or get me checked out. I tried looking for online therapy but haven't found much luck.
mentalillness,fclvjaf,t1_fclu6mb,1577757498.0,The fact is if you actually researched these types of things instead of going of your own opinion you would know that it's not a mental illness.
mentalillness,fclp2ef,t1_fclmrgx,1577753017.0,They aren't mentally ill your just ignorant
fantasywriters,fc8rxn1,t1_fc8r4pq,1577540902.0,At first i was trying to be nice now i just see your a pathetic loser who probably haves issues and instead of actually being smart you choose to cry like a little bitch over these people. By the way have you ever thought that people may have fucking issues in their own lives and need to let it out. People also have mental problems which cause them to do these things. Stop trying to a hard ass because small to you can be a huge deal to someone else. Just cause it's not your problem doesn't mean someone can't get angry over.
podcast,fc64i87,t1_fc64cse,1577472084.0,Sorry
fantasywriters,fc5eh3e,t1_exku2ok,1577455179.0,Because somethings people find offensive while others don't. You need to be more aware of these things.

socialanxiety,fc4jasp,t3_eg35dx,1577418303.0,The thing is this happens to me more then most people would think and it's ducking depressing.
socialanxiety,fc4g8gi,t3_efz305,1577415759.0,Same with me. I just always would rather text.
socialanxiety,fc45nzo,t3_efz7yr,1577407285.0,This is so me. And once again it's ducking depressing.
unpopularopinion,f96xaje,t1_eu77h5n,1575154228.0,That's not a good compliment coming from a stranger
