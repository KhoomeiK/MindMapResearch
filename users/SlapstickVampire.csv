He and his team looked specifically at sugar, carbs, and wheat. He might benefit from this sort of analysis if the research at the time needed funding and his belief that calls for more research might have gotten him more funding because his base research might have some ability to  counter traditional understandings of the food pyramid.

Once people *actually* consider multiple options, they stop assuming and start thinking. Well, some do. And that's enough for me.

They're kids (or emotionally equivalent to) so just getting a reaction, any reaction is funny. (Temple grandin talked a little about something like this in her Thinking in pictures book, she couldn't understand social interaction, but she understood practical jokes (or something similar), so that's what she did to interact with people.

They think these horrible thoughts for real and think it makes them smart. Upbringing, cult philosophy, or just feeling lonely and getting in with the wrong crowd. 

They think they're horrible and no one will love them so they make it a self fulfilling prophesy and make sure that people hate them. It's satisfying because at least they keep their world view even if it's a painful worldview.

HealthyFood,fbzt14y,t3_efdm61,1577259993.0,"A healthy diet is complicated, but pretty much all research shows that the best thing you can do to be healthy is cut out refined sugar. 

It helps to take it one step at a time and build up slowly. So, to start, the best advice for everyone is don't eat empty calories. So ditch sodas and sports drinks, if you're drinking them, and replace them with anything else, smart water, zero calorie sweet drinks, cafinated or herbal tea, fruit juice, prepackaged sweet coffee.

Just by replacing those with even slightly more nutritious food, you will be taking a step in the right direction.

Then the next step is cut out added sugar as much as you need to. Some people go need to go cold turkey, some people can step down slowly.

r/sugarfree can help."

gatekeeping,fbx84un,t1_fbx3k3j,1577173655.0,"It's because ""it"" in this case is a ""word of euphony"", a word that makes a sentence sound better.

If i were to write it, I would say ""every girlfriend I've had *loved that* we could do these things together"" 

(Writing from memory bc on mobile)

When he said ""loved it"" We think that that would be the end of the written sentence. So when the sentence kept going we often trip, I did."

It saves you from the pain of shallow relationships, just make sure you're combatting your own shallowness, and you'll be fine in relationships."
