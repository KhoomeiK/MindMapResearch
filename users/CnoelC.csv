politics,fdpk6su,t1_fdnm9rt,1578630875.0,"When did the argument become about then vs. now? 

The point is the system needs to change At the same pac society has. 

In the 50’s, no one would have cared if I hit the woman either.  Society has changed in that regard and I believe all basic human rights are equal."
politics,fdpjv5c,t1_fdnmggw,1578630611.0,"K so you haven’t read anything on the topic.  
It’s a popular economics topic that has been covered back to front.  Research should be easy.  

I guess you’re right about the ...umm.  rape... system..? being lopsided toward men.  

Women being more vulnerable to rape doesn’t seem like very good justification for women having better human rights."

politics,fdn60io,t1_fdlu9ax,1578578251.0,We live in Canada so the benefits are limited.  Regardless - Even if I was in a monogamous relationship I wouldn’t be inclined to sign a contract mortgaging half of all my stuff so I can save a bit of money on my taxes.
politics,fdn5ti7,t1_fdlv2uw,1578578100.0,"Good call. 

The OP you replied to was speaking specifically about the legal system.  The school system also Favors women.  The only system that doesn’t favour women is the biological system where they want to have babies and take time off of work to raise their kids.  If you look into the research you will find that this is the only thing currently holding women back from dominating every facet of society."
politics,fdn5irl,t1_fdlzfzx,1578577863.0,"Good question. 
No I do not do it just for the economic benefit.  There are social benefits as well - every guy that sees us together is baffled and thinks I’m some type of god.  It gains sweeping respect among my brethren 100% of the time.  I also find that I am much less complacent than I have found myself becoming in monogamous relationships.  Keeps me on my toes.  It’s a huge confidence boost to feel like you’re doing something that 99% of men don’t think they could ever pull off. 

Explaining the financial justification is just the best way to communicate one of the many advantages to people that cannot understand it at all.  
As I said in another reply, I was raised by women.  And all of the women who raised me were appalled by my lifestyle.  They thought I was manipulating the ladies.  I needed to find a way to get it through to them that this is not like a religious thing."
politics,fdn4z5g,t1_fdlv5f3,1578577427.0,"Well like i said if I did half the shit my ex did then I would be in jail and never allowed around my kids. 
For her because she is a woman - court will likely end with having split custody.  

She once assaulted a doctor at the hospital while drunk and disorderly after a fight at a club... she got a slap on the wrist.  I would still be in jail."

This isn’t a partisan issue.  

Women had the short end of the stick for a long time, now it’s swung too far in the opposite direction. 

I am confident it will balance out with time.  I don’t think men should have more rights than women, just like I don’t think the opposite should be true either.  I’m all for equality."
politics,fdluo04,t1_fdlsjab,1578532905.0,"I’m saying if I’m arrested for anything, I’m going to wish I was a woman. 

My ex always gets into drunken fights, has assaulted me several times, government fraud, drunk in public, and is just an all around horrible person.  
Yet she has not served any time in jail and somehow actually has a fighters chance in custody court.  

The only reason - she’s a beautiful woman. 
I would have been locked away a long time ago if I did even 1 of those things."
politics,fdlueod,t1_fdls5xc,1578532730.0,"You’re right for the most part.  

Some of the stuff is funny, but honestly I’m considering unsubbing just because of how everyone automatically assumes they have you all figured out once they see that. 

Just so everyone knows, I’m not bitter at all and I fucking love women.  The system needs to be fixed though."
politics,fdltxda,t1_fdlfmil,1578532407.0,"2 sons from a previous relationship of mine.  
Neither of the ladies have kids of their own (yet) but they love my sons like they were their own. 

I pay the bills under my name, but they transfer me their pitch at the beginning of each month.  

At this point I am the only one saving/investing, but a big reason why I can save as much as I do is because of their pitch.  

We all bring very different strengths to the table.  It’s surprisingly balanced and harmonious.  

I’m a man that likes his alone time, so it’s really a relief to have someone there for each of them when they just wanna chat and stuff."

She’s trying to use the 2 ladies thing against me, which if it works will be absolutely criminal because she has serious mental health issues and has put the kids in some very dangerous situations.  The whole reason we are in court is because of my extreme safety concerns.  

Like.. sorry my kids have triple the love here, while they’re often in mortal danger due to their mothers poor decisions in who she brings into her/their lives."
politics,fdlrp00,t1_fdlhhlb,1578530895.0,"Meh.  I’ve been hurt by women, I’ve hurt women (not physically).  

No doubt that place can be fucked up, but a man can dislike the extreme feminist culture while still loving the company of women. 

My ladies actually like that I’m an independent free thinker.  We do not agree on everything, but they like that I have my own hobbies and do not rely on them for emotional stability.  
It frees me up to be the rock."
