I believe asexual is just a preference and don't think it belongs in the lgb spectrum. I'm not a very sexual person and I've had people ask if I was asexual. I like women and attracted to them therefore I'm straight, 

does it need further classification or is it just a preference? Are you romantically drawn to either gender? If so why don't you identify accordingly and just mention you don't want to have sex when you meet the person? 

Sorry if I sound like a dick I'm just giving you my points so you can combat them to where I can understand better"
TrueOffMyChest,ffejia8,t3_et5f4s,1579850584.0,"LGB should be on the spectrum

Transgender isn't a sexuality and shouldn't be lumped with them. Although they need help and rights their needs aren't the same as those of that group.

Also people need to stop making preferences sexualities. LGB. Or even more accurately GB since gay means homosexual. 

I can see my opinion getting shit on but it is what it is"

I'm sorry your gf had an encounter with a scum of the Earth person. Thing is, 99% of cops are there to stop things like that from happening more frequently. If there were no cops, people would be killing eachother on the street way more than now, robbing way more than now. 

Youre pretty bad at putting objectivity over personal experiences but your experience has no bearing over the actuality that cops help the nation. Cops have died to save people from having that same experience. If we can judge all cops based on the actions of the bad ones then we can judge them all based on the actions of the good ones. Which in turn would make them great because the majority of cops are good people. But we can't. Some people are garbage human beings like the one out of the 700,000 cops in America that did that shit to your gf. Cops can't bomb people.

That being said I'm really sorry she had such an encounter and hope you guys can heal through that."

These are all just guestimates

Yeah some bad people do some bad things with their authority. And yeah you're probably right that if we're talking about overall negativity from cops it's more than one percent (I was contesting ops point with that), but hundreds of thousands of cops that have absolutely nothing to do with the less than half of the bad ones actions shouldn't be held accountable.

My point still stands that most cops deserve respect. Even if your statistic is actually factual and even 45% of cops abuse their power (which isn't the case) that's still less than half and the ones that do risk their lives more than make up for it.

If we're allowed to shit on the police force the the wrong doings of less than half of them, then we should also consider all the good done by the majority of them.

While I don't believe judging a whole set of people based on the actions of some, if that's what we're doing, the good cops do still outweighs the bad. Therefore they deserve respect. Even by your own logic"
unpopularopinion,ffabrwe,t1_ffab5fw,1579731821.0,"🙄🙄 I can see that perspective, but it's the same shit my racist family members say. ""Not all black are bad, but the ones that are bring down the whole community""

No they don't. They got nothing to do with eachother. As well as alot of cops who commit hate crimes are persecuted in some manner and have personal relationships with the cops defending them so of course the cops in those instances are going to react poorly. They're filled with emotion.

But outside of the less than 1% of cops that do bad things that I mentioned, the other 99 probably have nothing to do with them, don't even know eachother. A cop in California doesn't deserve any hate for a cop in some shitty racist backwards towns actions.

The overwhelming majority of cops are good people. A few bad ones got nothing to do with the rest and the only reason people are scared is cuz of fear mongering. 

It's in their job description to de escalate a situation without using violence as much as possible."
unpopularopinion,ffa9f9t,t1_ffa6s9s,1579730460.0,Thank God Reddit doesn't represent the country well. I love police officers wtf.
unpopularopinion,ffa9b4a,t3_esfwtw,1579730396.0,"Completely wrong, your tiny little personal experience doesn't define cops around the country. Who cares what color you are. I'm afraid to be pulled over by cops and I'm white. If people are scared of cops because their skin color they've been fear mongered to the max. Less than .1% of cops have done anything racist and no those ones don't deserve any respect and should be kicked off the force if not sent to jail themselves.

The majority of cops are good people. Most people the join the police force are there cuz they want to make a difference, make the world just a little more safe. So someone joining the force and being a police officer deserves respect until proven otherwise.

The state of being a cop deserves more respect that most people I see on the streets cuz they're actually doing something to keep me safe. Simple as that.

Yeah some are bad. The overwhelming majority are not. 

>I would even go as far as to say that a majority of them are bad cops.

You'd be completely fucking wrong. This is a democracy if most cops were bad we'd be able to change that. But scaring an entire population and making them hate the police force based on the actions of almost 0% of them is what's bad.

>Maybe if police departments started proactively weeding out the bad ones when they do bad shit the population would start to begin to trust them.

It's crazy that most departments do do that and you're just so misinformed that you decide to call people who risk their lives to save others daily bad people.

If your hopes are all up and you take soemone on a date and it turns out they're not attracted to your sex, you should be told before the first date so you don't look like a clown on what they consider a hang out session.

If someone looks 18 but is actually 16 or soemthing, they should tell you before you try to take them on a date or anything so it doesn't end up becoming soemthing it doesn't need to.

If soemones a guy and you should be informed before you take them on a date because you're not attracted to guys.

Trans people are lucky to live in 1st world countries because we don't go beheading people we disagree with like in 3rd world countries. They're safe here in America so tell the person you're flirting with so it doesn't become a problem and if it is a problem avoid the first date. Easy

Taking a date can be a risky thing with any of the factors I mentioned being disclosed but you still have to disclose them otherwise it's not gonna work out so why even go?
