All I'm trying to say is his suspension is justifiable because he picked it up in the first place. Without that, his suspension is 8 games, or maybe even less."
CollegeBasketball,ffb50o5,t1_ffax3z8,1579751963.0,"Exactly, whether he swung the chair, it was taken from him, or in the heat of the moment he realized it wasn't a smart idea, and decided to drop it. 

Fact of the matter is, he still picked up a stool in an aggressive motion as if he was going to swing it or throw it towards someone. No matter how you want to look at it, it's a terrible look for KU and for the NCAA as a whole.

Who started it, who finished it, whether he drops it on his own.. None of it matters, he picked up a stool and held it above his head as if to use it as a weapon. He doesn't do that, and he probably only gets 8 games. 

It absolutely is a pointless argument."

No thx, I stand by my statement. They didn't need to leave a snarky comment either, but they chose to anyway.

Not only would I have been paying attention if I did own a cheeky cat, but I would have noticed when the cat wasn't around when I was walking away, instead of negligently leaving it in there for over 30+ mins. Never once in my life has something so trivial had such a high cost. The slightest amount of awareness could have prevented this, but I'm sure this person had better things on their mind, like binge watching netflix and stuffing their face with more mcdonalds.

So, thanks for your useless and needlessly pointless comment over 24 hours later."

CatastrophicFailure,fdxr3mw,t3_en7xl9,1578772083.0,"Mobile cranes are extremely dangerous when out of their load capacity. Which it seems wasn't the case until the wrecked truck's structural integrity started to give way, which caused a shift in the load that the out-riggers could not overcome.

I had to get a mobile crane license for a job I had in an aluminum rolling plant about 10 years ago. I'm sure it's expired by now unfortunately, because I didn't keep it up. Really wish I would have because the training I had to go through to get it was extensive, including a separate training course on just rigging the load that had to be completely beforehand."
