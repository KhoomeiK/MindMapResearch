Cebu,ff96eny,t3_es930p,1579705931.0,"This is subjective to what suits your taste but if your budget is 299 per head. I would recommend Han Pork on mango or the kbbq place in J centre. Both are unli but preparation of their side dishes and meat would be lacking to some. Not trying to be a snob. From my experience 299 unli in Cebu is what it is.  

If you got money to spend Kaya. Alot of their side dishes gave me flash back to my mother's cooking. Their meat is of high quality... would absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience real Korean taste. Downside is the price...  but if 2 people are eating and let's say 600 pesos together. You may order 2 meats.. and all the side dishes it would come with, I would say worth it. I would say their pork steak tastes even better than the samgyupsal but yeah, I digress."
digitalnomad,ff934ce,t3_es11th,1579703676.0,"That is a good question. To me I thought a digital nomad was working online abroad while making at home rates. 

But I imagine some are jealous. Maybe some nomads do things that reflect negatively towards the community? I am unsure since I am new at this idea."
Veterans,ff8wuy9,t1_ff8no0n,1579698717.0,Ok thank you.
StackAdvice,ff8wtmv,t1_ff8ogew,1579698684.0,Best advice so far. I was thinking something like that as well. Ty
Veterans,ff8nyu7,t1_ff8jq96,1579688149.0,Yeah I am looking for a copy because that initial packet is long gone.
Veterans,ff8nkmy,t1_ff8kdyb,1579687545.0,Does the long version have any additional information that would be useful? If so how do I proceed in getting another letter?
Veterans,ff8efoj,t1_ff8cvhm,1579675002.0,I was able to find a summary letter but not the long version.
Veterans,ff85z6v,t1_ff7cr7l,1579666933.0,How would one find a copy of the letter?
Philippines,ff31fok,t1_ff2pzp3,1579531135.0,Yeah it is sad how there are better opportunities else where. At the end the truly innocent are the ones punished..

Philippines,fexfnq5,t3_eqrjea,1579430215.0,I always wanted to go to Siquijor. But my partner believes in magic hahaha.
Philippines,fewku0y,t3_eqmi2j,1579412980.0,Looks good! Keep up the strong work!
Philippines,fewjvty,t1_few5oo2,1579412169.0,I would do the same. I want to teach him the right way. To not fall into the same negative tendencies and to see through all the social construct. To become a man's man if you know what I am saying.
Philippines,fewjrrh,t1_fetrp5j,1579412074.0,Depends. Ultimately that is your choice but I have met some really good Filipinos and some really bad. In this world where internet and social media rules (especially facebook here hahaha). Gotta remove those negativities and make/build a circle that enriches your life..
Philippines,fewjmcm,t1_fes444l,1579411966.0,You are not alone. Growing up in different countries have different issues but I know you can rise up and be the best version of you!
Philippines,fewjhet,t1_fesq175,1579411870.0,"Even as a foreigner somethings I say are or do are judged in a gender stereotype way. Like when I say ""whatever"" playfully I get called gay right away lol even though it is obvious I am not. The overwhelming females I see doing a certain course because it fits their gender. It is crazy, but at the same time it is refreshing for some types of things."
Philippines,fewj9ys,t1_fevxsn7,1579411725.0,"You realize your mistakes. Your family gave you the love and support you needed so you can crawl, walk, run to a better life. You deserve it."

Cebu,feg4myb,t1_fefzhhb,1579076712.0,"Yeah that is truly the best option. Since ISP have their pros and cons in areas. I still feel like PLDT fibr is best so far, but I lived at fuente when I was using them. Now I live in Mandaue and have sky fiber and they suck."
Cebu,fefmxby,t3_eow868,1579059808.0,I had pldt fibr before and that was the best service I had. I am currently using sky fiber and I can tell you it sucks.
ChronicPain,fects3n,t3_eo62c1,1578984310.0,I must be more alive than the average person. But somehow less productive in many ways due to it. How to measure?
AskReddit,fe957jk,t3_eo3q9l,1578934313.0,I am in my living room so I would be fine.. until my partner's niece walks out of her bedroom and my partner freaks out. Hahaha
solotravel,fe1gjab,t1_fe0iqx7,1578826302.0,Maybe it was cold so they wanted to keep you warm.

Cebu,fe0fgfl,t3_eng86i,1578812515.0,Thanks! For someone who is trying to avoid the rush this Sinulog this is helpful.
Cebu,fe0azsc,t1_fdx6g09,1578808239.0,Yeah. Totally agree.. that is why I dont drive here and just use grab/taxi. Although it is sometimes scary in a taxi since they drive recklessly at times.
Cebu,fdwroq8,t1_fdw4eyx,1578761710.0,What about it drives you insane?
Cebu,fdvmb13,t1_fdv7aju,1578748971.0,Thanks for the plug.

Philippines,fdt9l1v,t3_emzd0m,1578713706.0,It is more fun in the Philippines! Hahaha
Cebu,fdt8xsp,t1_fdt2nvs,1578713466.0,Yeah. I just paid 7.2k for a monthly prescription. That colon option would be nice if I am ever in the area. The mercury drugs at fuente was out of stock yesterday so I they recommended me the one next to cebu doc. There they told me ayala also carries it but would like to find more pharmacies in my area. Thank you.
Cebu,fdt8m8z,t1_fdrsjh1,1578713354.0,Fantastic. I will try those areas next time. Haha yesterday it took me almost 2 hours from Mandaue to Fuente and that is such a mood kill!

Cebu,fdqbqtx,t1_fdq74v8,1578662305.0,Ah okay thanks for the suggestion. Kind of feels like this medication can only be found near pharmacy's that are near major hospitals. I would like to be proven wrong since it is a far trip for me.

Cebu,fczsu5z,t1_fczkor3,1578108025.0,Alright. I will check out that option. The other option a redditor advised would be 10k to ship it. So I believe this is the most affordable option.
Cebu,fczjwy3,t1_fcx8e1i,1578102858.0,Okay thanks for the info.

TrueOffMyChest,fcmy32u,t3_ei0f1c,1577797230.0,As someone who takes pride in grooming himself. High five bro. It is great to take care of yourself. It is nice that someone else noticed your efforts.
AskMen,fcjzo7h,t1_fci7zqh,1577711866.0,I can relate. Hope you are doing better.
inlaws,fcjpch1,t3_ehh8p7,1577697876.0,"In a way your inlaws seem to want some control. They want you to follow whatever non sense rules they want. This time, it is about xmas and the gift exchange. Next time it will be some other situation, where their priorities are higher than yours. 

There will always be ""reasons"" to be angry. Most important thing our family's should know is to understand/respect each other. Not ridiculing them when they find a ""reason."" 

I am currently going through a similiar situation as yours. Where my inlaws get angry and gossip about my partner and I. It is petty at times, but I do show my respect to them. 

I really want to go NC with them but my partner says we do not have a choice since it is her family. I feel stuck at times because I feel she does not have my back, all information is funneled through her. I really don't want that family drama. Yet it seems to sneak into our household somehow."
ChronicPain,fc8h8s9,t3_egj1d7,1577534863.0,"Whoever you are. You are brave. Going through chronic pain sucks. It sucks even more when there are tools out there to help us, but we are not able to access them. 

If it ever becomes too hard of a burden. Seeking help from others is not weakness during your dark times. There are other ways in helping yourself, if doctors are not willing."

digitalnomad,fc2q4hd,t1_fc2o1km,1577370687.0,"Hey! I am unsure if it will be indefinite. 3k a month unfortunately wouldn't be enough at the moment since my son came into the picture. Although that was the original plan when I was single. Hahaha! 

Yeah was thinking of an online degree, but unsure in what. I am interested in the DN life and would like to make USD while being overseas. 

This xmas it hit me really hard. No one was really here for us this holiday. It made me realize there is no one really there for us. Although my current income (not stable) is okay to live on. I would like to offer more to my family in the future. I would like to make more streams/stable income. 

This is what made me found you guys. So I am currently formulating a plan of action to take to solidify our future."
