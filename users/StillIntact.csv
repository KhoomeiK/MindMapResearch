prozac,fetsak9,t1_fes75ty,1579379445.0,"I started on 10mg and was on it for about 2 months. My doctor told me of all the side effects and she said she usually starts her patients on 10mg until they get stablize, then she talked about increasing the dose if needed.

I found that 10mg was working for me so I stuck with it. Then I had a low for about a week where my symptoms of depression came back so I upped my dose to 20mg. Starting on 10mg really helped ease me into handling the side effects. Are you able to ask your doctor to prescribe you a 10mg dose first?"
prozac,feqg189,t3_eq693f,1579341391.0,"What DionRifkin said. When I first started Prozac, I remember feeling drunk and staying drunk for a few hours after 1-2 cups of wine. Also, if you find that Prozac makes you more awake, take it in the morning. If you find that it makes you drowsy, take it at night. It takes 2-4 weeks to adjust to the side effects and 6-8 weeks to feel the full benefits. If you're upping your dosage for whatever reason, be aware that the side effects may return (just not as bad as the first time around). Never stop taking it without consulting with your doctor, and don't be afraid of taking it because it truly does wonders for some. Hope all goes well!

Edit: I also suggest taking notes on how you feel the first 2 weeks of starting so you can track how your side effects are changing. I felt euphoric when I took my first dose but slowly had lots of insomnia and loss of appetite. Eventually, it all evened out."

depression,fc9hz3q,t3_egptaw,1577552947.0,"This is my number one issue. I'm always tired no matter how much sleep I get and my fatigue prevents me from doing everything that I want or need to do. I also have what I call ""mental fatigue"" where cognitive tasks are too tiring so I avoid them too."
mentalillness,fc9gl92,t3_egrwi1,1577552375.0,Best of luck. There is hope. You got this.
mentalhealth,fc6eoxp,t3_egedjq,1577478800.0,"I sometimes get these thoughts too and have had them since I was a teen. I'm now in my late 20's and still get them from time to time. I would never act on any of these thoughts, just as you wouldn't, but I'm not sure how or why they occur. I just try to remember that it's only a thought and I let it pass. Thoughts and emotions are temporary and always fluctuating and sometimes fleeting."

NoStupidQuestions,fc6dial,t3_egdqda,1577478009.0,"Think of your body as a chamber of fluid. When you're moving, the fluid circulates within you. When you stop for an extended period of time, the fluid settles. So, given this analogy, when you're laying down in a flat position while sleeping, the fluid in your body levels out because of gravity and your sleeping position. Sometimes you may notice that you look ""swollen"" in the face, eyelids, etc upon waking up in the morning. When you start your day and get the body moving, the fluid equalizes in your body, and the ""swelling"" goes away."
prozac,fbj77l3,t3_ed4lgz,1576926557.0,"Hello! I was in the same position as you when I started Prozac, 10mg earlier this year. I know it's a bit scary to start medication, especially ones related to mental health. Before starting Prozac, I was fearful and resistant because meds were my last resort. However, I can say that Prozac has helped me a lot. It has completely eliminated my anxiety and has helped with my depressive symptoms. 

The thing that sucks is that it takes 2-3 weeks for most people to feel the positive effects (stability, ability to handle stress easier, motivation, energy, etc.). And during those 2-3 weeks, there are quite a few side effects, but everyone reacts differently and experiences different side effects. It's up to you what you think will be most beneficial and manageable at this time. Prozac and therapy are both great in their own ways.

I wish you the best."
