AskReddit,fdhk0gj,t3_elaebq,1578424278.0,"(For what it's worth, I am actually a teacher but I was babysitting in this case)

I was asked to babysit a 9 year old girl and a 3 year old boy a few weekends ago. I'd never met the kids, but I figured the 9 year old and I will just hang out with the mutual understanding that she doesn't need me there, and the 3 year old might need some redirection and to just be kept occupied. Boy was I fucking wrong. The 9 year old was a straight up manipulative bully. 

She gave the boy ""jobs"" to do when playing playdoh and then tore him up telling him how bad he was at every job she gave him. 

She chased him around the house with a sharpened pencil. 

She roughhoused with him until he got hurt and ran upstairs crying, and then she chased after him laughing going ""aww I'm really sorry"". 

She stole the tv remote out of my hand and hid it when I tried to find a movie to put on. 

She tried to tell me that his bedtime wasn't actually when the kids' mom told me it was and got him up to play trucks. Then when I was finally getting him to go to sleep with a story, she came in the room and told me that it was way past his bedtime and he's not allowed any more books.

I'd never met a child so starved for control, but I really question where this is coming from because 1.) I gave her nothing to push back against. If she was being controlling because I was treating her like a child, I would have understood. But I wasn't. and 2.) It was clear her parents weren't extremely strict with her on a normal basis.

Anyway, my first clue should have been when the parents offered me a higher pay per hour than I asked for. Even with the chance to make $100 in one night, I'm never going back."

When I dealt with grief this past summer, the first week or so I couldn't bear to talk about it. All I wanted was to stop thinking about it. As time went on, I eventually was able to talk and share some good memories, but I needed to get to that point on my own. When people tried to talk about it before that point, I would just break down sobbing and wouldn't be able to get the horrible memories out of my mind.

Also, out of all the heartfelt inspirational poems or w/e, the best card I received during that time was one that simply said ""This Sucks"" in big letters on the front."
