Stupid, backwards laws are implemented based on ridiculous fairy tale nonsense. People discriminate against one another because a book told them to. People are fired, disowned, beaten and killed because of your god. Scientific and social progress is staunchly opposed by you and your ilk. Gullible, indoctrinated people like you are taken advantage of, paying tithes that only end up in the pocket of some priest or pastor that doesn't really give a single fuck about your god, who are only interested in adding a third yacht to their collection. And on and on, the problems are endless. So why wouldn't we be concerned with such a major issue in our world? And yes, your god is constantly punishing people. Your god is supposedly the source of everything, and everything goes according to his plan, right? Then he is the cause of all the suffering and evil in the world. Even if your god was real, he would not be worthy of our worship."

Who are you to decide that? Why does your baseless opinion get to dictate reality? Who cares if you disagree? Humans are a species of ape. You, right now, are an ape. That is a fact. You can dislike it all you want, it doesn't change anything."
athiesm,fcbel4h,t1_fca6535,1577585908.0,">If we evolved from apes why are there still apes today?

If Americans came from Europeans, why do Europeans still exist today? Not every single ape in existence evolved into modern day humans. One individual ape, in one specific group, got a mutation. If that mutation was beneficial to survival, his descendants would have that mutation and have a much higher chance of survival than the other apes in the group. Eventually, the apes with the mutation would outnumber the apes that don’t have the mutation and it would become the norm for that particular group. That is how evolution works. We are not descended from every single ape that existed back in prehistoric times; we are descended from one individual ape.

>Why aren’t there any species that are in between the process of evolution.

There are. 

>We are said to evolve from chimpanzees as they are our closest DNA match, wouldn’t other monkeys also have evolved over time and would that have created different species of humans?

There were different species of humans in the past, like [homo neanderthalensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal) and [homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus). 

>Why hasn’t any other animals evolved to (self aware - may be wrong term to use but I think everyone will get my point) beings

Why would they? Every evolutionary path is different. Different species face different issues, so they evolve in different ways."
