umanitoba,ffaxgos,t3_esmfol,1579746751.0,"Looking back, I wish I would have attended a more undergrad focused/teaching oriented university. I get that most profs are there to do research, but the amount of profs I've had that clearly did not give a shit or want to be there was really disheartening.

Also, the food here is overpriced and disgusting."
umanitoba,fekn7x6,t3_ep5k3u,1579203559.0,ENGL 0930 was one of the easiest courses I've taken in my life. You also learn a lot of things that will come in handy in the future (how to write a university-level paper). I'd recommend taking it.
college,fearcyz,t3_eoaecf,1578951550.0,"I feel your pain, I dropped $350 on a textbook and an access code the other day. The textbook I'll at least be able to resell and make some money back, but access codes are the bane of my existence."
college,feaqfte,t3_eoajky,1578951352.0,"If you had issues with mental health, I would absolutely get in contact with disability services if you haven't already, or  even student advocacy if that's a service avalible at your school. They'd be able to give you a better answer than anyone on here probably could, and could likely direct you towards disputing the grade if possible. 

Having dealt with disability services and student advocacy at my school, my advice to you is to contact them ASAP. The sooner you get things moving the better and more likely they will be able to help you."
college,feap0x1,t1_feakltc,1578950949.0,"For lunches, I would just pack it in a lunch bag as usual. For dinners I would usually bring something frozen/microwavable that could sit all day without getting gross, like a calzone or a frozen burrito. For snacks I'd usually bring fruits and veggies, or sometimes chips or crackers. 

I did have the luxury of being able to pack my lunch/dinner with a freezer pack so it kept cold for longer, but I understand that's not really an option for everyone."
college,fe9n6op,t3_eo50o7,1578939652.0,"My school is really bad about offering enough sections, so almost every year I've been forced into an evening class. This semester I'm on campus every Monday from 8:30 AM until 9:45 PM (RIP). 

My advice: 

* Pack lots of food and water. I was packing lunch, dinner, and multiple snacks to get me through the day, along with a water bottle. Occasionally I would treat myself to dinner out, but not too often. 
* Bring some textbooks and get some studying done in your down time. This might just be me, but I'm much more productive at school than at home, so I didn't really mind this. 
* Have a break and take some time to yourself. For me, I would go to the university pool, meet up with a friend for a bit, or even watch some Netflix. It made the day much more bearable. 
* Get some exercise throughout the day. Doesn't have to be a super hard gym workout if that's not your thing, but walking on the track, going swimming, or even taking a walk around campus is helpful to get up and get your blood flowing. I feel much better after getting some exercise opposed to sitting at a table or desk for the entire day."
umanitoba,fdqiphv,t3_emnepv,1578667645.0,"I took FILM 1290 (Art of Film) my freshman year. It was ok, some of the films we watched were pretty boring though. Basically the course was watching a movie on Tuesday, and having discussion/lecture on Thursday. Be warned, since the film department is technically part of the English department, there is a lot of writing/essays involved in these courses."
college,fdh1zmk,t3_el9c0l,1578413647.0,"The best professor I've ever had in my university career had a 2.7 rating on rate my prof because she was seen as a tough marker. And one of the worst had a 4.5 because his class was seen as a GPA booster. It's not always accurate, but it is a useful tool to gauge what the class will be like. 

That being said, I've definitely had a couple of profs who've lived up to their sub 2.0 scores. I wouldn't put too much stock into a few negative reviews, but if almost every review is saying the class is brutal or the prof sucks (I'm talking like a rating below 2) I would generally avoid them."
memes,fbhj81f,t1_fbhauq4,1576874955.0,"You've hit the nail on the head, people on AITA are so focused on what you're obligated and not obligated to do, that sometimes they completely ignore social conventions and etiquette. 

Too many times I'll be reading all the comments saying ""NTA, you're not obligated to...."" and find my self thinking, ""sure, you don't **have** to do that, but it would be the polite/nice thing to do"""
