BasicBulletJournals,ff3hn1q,t1_ff36ycq,1579541230.0,"I also recommend the Bay Area Discovery Museum on the north side of the bridge (Sausalito).  Geared more for under-10s, but great views and good hiking over on that side, too.  Look for reciprocal membership rates."
BasicBulletJournals,ff3hd6u,t1_ff36ycq,1579541059.0,We go to Lovejoy’s in Redwood City for birthdays and whatnot!  Have you been to SF before?  The Cliff House is lovely and is where we went the night my husband proposed (at the GG Bridge).

MensLib,fej58jr,t3_ep35pu,1579157403.0,"If you take up cycling or swimming, no one will bat an eye.  Back in my triathlete days I encountered tons of shaved-legged guys, and frankly I (female) find it incredibly attractive. 

It also seems to me that plenty of heterosexual men get manicures, at least in the more urban areas I’ve lived."
menwritingwomen,fej3fwk,t1_fej2u1n,1579155448.0,"Made prehistory interesting to a teenager like me, though.  I pretended to be Ayla whenever we went camping, slinging rocks around with a sock and what-have-you."

konmari,fe6k644,t1_fe6jhp8,1578893566.0,"I don’t like fake plants on principle, but I cannot keep mine alive.  Even with a skylight I think they just don’t get enough light.  These look so nice I may have to forget my principles."
Parenting,fe3qx0g,t1_fe22arc,1578852017.0,This is so good.  I wish I could sew better.
Parenting,fe3ohnm,t1_fdz2ks3,1578851337.0,"Uh oh, maybe this isn’t the sub for me!  My three girls are planning to share a bedroom when they no longer want to also share it with their brother!  (Glad to know it works for you though.)"

wokekids,fdjd1ui,t1_fdifsz3,1578465839.0,"Chopsticks are like an extension of your fingers, though.  So for anything that you’d like to eat with fingers, but can’t for mess or decorum reasons (like Cheetos) they are great."

scienceofdeduction,fccfkzc,t3_egy6me,1577597824.0,"I bet you get straight A’s.  You have a curious mind - the reference books are wide-ranging, from outer space to animals to World Records.  Plus you yourself enjoy mysteries - The Mysterious Benedict Society, the big book (I think) on detectives, the huge Hitchcock one.  It looks like a whole row of yellow Nancy Drews but I’m not sure.  Are you also a writer?  And if so, I don’t know how you find the time.  You have a LOT going on."
todayilearned,fc37s7k,t1_fc35cqg,1577383523.0,Thank you for choosing your field.  It must be incredibly delicate and emotionally hard to be surrounded by suffering people (families as much as patients) and to know going in that your objective isn’t to ‘cure.’  I hope it is satisfying that you can provide everyone some comfort and peace.
