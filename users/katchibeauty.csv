bipolar,ffar38r,t1_ffal0o7,1579742514.0,"Why do you feel that if you do a career change now it’ll be years wasted? It’s hard to find a company so loving and accommodating. It’ll be hard to find something like that again. But just because you change jobs doesn’t mean you wasted your time. It feels like that, trust me I get it more than I’d like to admit, but things happen in life and thats okay."
bipolar,ffajuzy,t1_ffaig0e,1579737537.0,"My fiancé is the same. It sucks because I always made more money, I always worked more. Needing to rely on him when he’s still learning to be independent is hard. 

I’m going to a conference next month to hopefully get some resources and network. I loved the work I did, but I’m not ready for that job. But I don’t want to get lost going down a path I won’t like either. It’s all a balancing act. Which is next to impossible when you’re bipolar.... Do you know what you want to do career wise? Maybe do some research."
bipolar,ffaakai,t3_escguo,1579731114.0,"I also just lost my job...again. In hindsight I was looking at my job with rose tinted glasses, ignoring all the red flags because I enjoyed the work I did. 

Try to use this time to rest, recover, and bounce back stronger. I did my makeup today for no reason other than to do it. Small steps will help you climb a mountain"
funny,ff47l67,t1_ff4604w,1579557281.0,"They’re incredibly easy to make if you want to try. It takes a good amount of time in a day to do it, but you freezer the rest. Lumpia is my version of a frozen pizza. I make almost 5 lbs of it at a time and freeze for months. 

I’m running out of lumpia soon...."

PanPorn,fez2ok2,t1_fe6sj1r,1579453301.0,"I have this now and I ADORE it. I don’t have the pilling issue but it could be more hydrating. But I’m in Chicago, using a birth control that has dried my skin, changed my birth control and epiduo forte. Pairing it up with hydrating serums help a lot and the results are so worth it."
PanPorn,feyw8us,t1_fekhj0y,1579451240.0,"I really liked the makeup forever self setting concealer. I always set my under eyes but I think you could go without it. 

I have the Laura Mercier one now and I would say it has better coverage."
selfhelp,feoz32i,t3_eq6oiz,1579308513.0,"I lost my job yesterday. I knew taking it would be a risk because it was high stress. But I was desperate for money, and it was my dream opportunity. 

However I was depressed. I’ve reflected and I was looking at things with rose tinted glasses to ignore my own debilitating pain. I need to heal before I can grow."
accidentalswastika,fdznqbg,t1_fdkkor5,1578792123.0,"The swastika is originally a holy symbol. You’ll see it all over Asia, Hitler changed it slightly and it became the Nazi propaganda. 

Hitler ruined the swastika."
BipolarReddit,fdx895y,t1_fdwlmqt,1578766296.0,"It’s so so so so hard. I’m always trying to keep myself at peak performance as much as possible. But it’s draining and difficult and I crash so hard. But the mania makes me amazing at my career. I can hyper focus. I can analyze situations. I can do so many things that most “normal people” couldn’t do under the best of circumstances. 

I want my greatest weakness to become my greatest strength. My journey is going to be a long and painful one, may as well make it worth it."
BipolarReddit,fdtebyt,t3_en08od,1578715542.0,"As someone who is rapid cycling I feel this so hard. I’m either amazingly brilliant or I’m a hot mess. I’m trying to hardness the amazingly brilliant part, but the hot mess keeps attacking me."
MakeupRehab,fdpl9uz,t1_fdpchpf,1578631770.0,"I actually love my velour puffs and use them frequently. I keep a bunch on hand because I’m acne prone and change them out a lot. I ended up getting the Laura Mercier one for free, and I notice no difference if I use that one or the ones off amazon. 

If you need powder to really set your foundation for 12 hour long day wear then using a puff helps a lot. But you don’t need a rly expensive one."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmbp60,t3_em0xs0,1578544886.0,"It’s not your responsibility to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm. Moving in with her will not help anything right now. They say not to make any major decisions during painful times in life for a reason. It’s never really followed through with much thought. 

Do what you need to do to take care of yourself. You can’t do that while living with someone who causes you pain."
MakeupRehab,fdmapzx,t3_elueri,1578544105.0,"So needed this. I ran out of my hourglass stick foundation that I use almost everyday for work. I rly rly rly don’t want to be shelling out $46 for it, but I use it almost every day because it makes doing my makeup so quick."

PanPorn,fcuttyk,t1_fcu41zq,1577988363.0,"It’s so expensive lol (RIP my wallet) but so worth it. I love how it acts as a skincare barrier for makeup. My makeup goes on really well and my skin did show improvement as I kept using this. 

Mine lasted about a year so I think it’s worth the investment."
PanPorn,fct2afq,t1_fcsm0zv,1577931019.0,Thank you! I love this color so much. Happy New Years as well!
PanPorn,fcsd26l,t3_eio4pl,1577914837.0,"Products: 

-Estee Lauder Pure Color Blush in Sensuous Rose. It was nice. It’s also super old. The color doesn’t really last past an hour and it’s time to move on. WNRP. 

-Estee Lauder Pure Color Lipgloss in Garnet Desire. Really sticky lipgloss. Loved the pearly finish. Color was gorgeous. Also super old. 4/5 but WNRP. 

-Tatcha Silk Canvas primer. I love this. I know the ELF is supposed to be a dupe but this doesn’t break me out (It’s hard to find things that don’t) and I use the matching Tatcha sunscreen. Already RP. 

-Bobbi Brown Vitamin C face base. Waaayyyy too old. Used this up as a neck moisturizer. More of a moisturizer than a primer. Smells amazing, but did nothing for the price. WNRP. 

-Lancôme Big Mascara mini. Love it. Works really well. Makes my Asian lashes look amazing. Very similar to the KUSH, but I think I prefer the brush on the KUSH mascara. WRP. 

-Anastasia Dipbrow Gel mini. This was nice but too pigmented for what I like. Overall worked very well. Trying the benefit one and I prefer that instead. Still great product and would recommend but I WNRP because it doesn’t fit my needs.  

-Makeup Forever Ultra HD concealer. I really loved this concealer but it wasn’t as pigmented as I would’ve hoped. More of a natural coverage. Went through it pretty quickly. Didn’t cause any creasing which was great. Would recommend but WNRP."
SkincareAddiction,fcgosvj,t1_fcgfgd2,1577642427.0,"NOT OP. But for me it’s cause they’re really into fermentation ingredients which my skin absolutely despises. Yeasts and algae’s. 

You just have to be very ingredient conscious with Korean skincare because it’s their thing. Skincare is a much bigger thing there than in the US."
PanPorn,fcgns4w,t1_fcedyvi,1577642185.0,You just gave me a great way to finish up my blushes! Touch up when I get home.
mildlyinteresting,fc6bvsm,t1_fc6bhry,1577476957.0,I’ll still take 11% over nothing. Hell even 1% is better than 0%.
bipolar,fc6bcqy,t1_fc63xl6,1577476610.0,"No ones perfect. Even the best role models are flawed. Martin Luther King cheated on his wife continuously. Abraham Lincoln freed slaves but by no means did he see black people as equal to whites. 

Overcoming drugs is an extremely painful process. It’s not easy and sobriety is even harder."
PanPorn,fc65mjh,t3_eg66xn,1577472814.0,"I guess I’m the odd one out? I really loved this and repurchased. I also use their sunscreen and the combo together works great. I can’t use everything in the Tatcha line but the stuff I can I really like. 

I’m rly hesitant to try the elf one. I break out from almost anything, I also already repurchased the Tatcha one so...idk. I also rly hate returning stuff."
legaladvice,fc6450x,t1_fc62jhd,1577471844.0,"I think eventually I will. I think just timing right now isn’t best. In my ideal world I’d like to wait a year before having to disclose anything. In my perfect world it’d be my dark secret no one knew about, but that’s just not quite doable yet."
legaladvice,fc63y69,t1_fc62hyf,1577471721.0,Do I need to disclose my disability? I’d like to limit the amount of information I need to share. To be honest I’m still terrified to disclose it at work; I only want to do things on an as need basis.
bipolar,fc5urb4,t3_eex92a,1577466344.0,"Sort of late to this thread. I’ve been in treatment for 10 years. Hospitalizations. Therapy. Medications. All of it. 

For the amount of pain I go through I’ve told myself I want to turn my bipolar into my greatest weapon. Not only will I get better, not only will I overcome it, I will use my disability to my advantage to make me stronger than everyone around me. It’s a hard and painful journey, but if I’m going to suffer as it is I may as well make it damn worth it."
bipolar,fc5t6gm,t1_fc5mhj7,1577465317.0,Same. SOS.
MakeupRehab,fc5sej7,t3_egd24a,1577464814.0,"Do you have any eye lid primer? If you use a bit under your concealer it helps. You could technically use any primer that works with the skin type under your eyes (that area has very little oil glands compared to the rest of your face). 

Also make sure you set with a rly good fine milled powder. I like using powder puffs to set my face because it pulls out excess oil for a longer lasting finish. Could also do this by pulling apart 2-ply toilet paper (making it 1 ply) and using it like a oil blotting sheet and set with powder after."
trichotillomania,fc2nw5d,t1_fc21p60,1577368570.0,"I’m not an eyelash puller, but I do have pretty pathetic Asian lashes. 

I wear makeup daily. And even with my lashes at its best if I’m wearing eyeliner you can barely notice they exist. Most people aren’t looking at your eyelashes, they will barely even notice it."
bipolar,fc2loja,t3_efuq23,1577366208.0,"Relationships aren’t easy. Relationships where someone suffers from a mental disability are even harder. However no matter what relationships are never fluid. There’s always ups and downs. 

In these situations I always ask myself the questions “why?”. Is it because I’m depressed? Did they do something that isn’t okay but I can work on forgiving? Is there possibly something else at play that can contribute to why I’m feeling this way? 

Talking through these types of situations with a therapist has always helped. Don’t set your relationship on fire for a momentary lapse in time."
AnimalsBeingBros,fc11g7a,t1_fc117ly,1577305528.0,There’s an article in the comments. Coyote was hit by a car and was injured. It definitely needed help.

This brand is actually known for their eyelash growth serum. I use the serum and it’s been amazing for my lashes."
