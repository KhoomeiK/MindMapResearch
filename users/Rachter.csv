woodburning,fdzpoh1,t1_fdzp3r5,1578792977.0,"Dude. Wood burning is drawing in slow motion. 

Constantly. Like the literal definition of the word. I rush pieces. It’s like you can see what it will be and you want it to be that faster! If there is anything I can say is this...(but know that there is more I can say because I like talking about things I like :P). Take your time with this brand of art. With paintings you can go over areas that didn’t turn out how you wanted. With burning you have to sand the bit down to get what you want if you mess up."
woodburning,fdzogjn,t1_fdzlsr6,1578792445.0,"If I could give you a suggestion it would be the following.

Not one of the following points but something to always have. Instrumental music. Have some music you enjoy playing that doesn’t have any words. Something chill is always good. But you don’t want to get distracted by lyrics. 

1. Get tracing paper and transfer paper (like carbon paper)
2. Get a light box. Something you can use to trace an existing image.
3. You can use your own art or some other art that you find powerful. The goal is use the light box to trace the image you want to burn. Trace the main lines you’re going to burn, don’t worry about filling in all the black parts.
4. Sand down the wood you want to use. Start with low grain(60 or 120) and slowly work to higher grain (400) until you can run your hand over the piece with your eyes closed. If you feel something that is slightly off then sand a bit more with the grain sandpaper you’re currently using. The goal is to make it smooth to the touch for your burning area.
5. Take the transfer paper and tape it down to the piece, then put the tracing paper over top of the transfer paper and trace again.
6. When you start burning focus on the line work only. 
7. Take a break. It’s easy to want to do the whole piece at once which you totally can do, my suggestion is to take 30 minutes. Just walk away from the piece. Let your hand and eyes rest. 
8. Do the shading and try to shade what you see from the original art. Take your time. If your tool has a variable temperature then try to do passes at different temperatures to get the shading result you want. 
9. Feel free to do multiple shading passes if you’d like specific sections to be darker.
10. Take your time!"
