We're all stuck in not wanting to change, as you're stuck with the thought of OP's will to avoid change.

Seriously tho, the topic is about the ethics of OP's therapist, maybe that's the main reason you got downvoted so badly. Just open a thread about your topic so we can discuss about it somewhere else."

TalkTherapy,fedu3m3,t3_eoceie,1579019921.0,"I think it depends on the boundaries your therapist sets. 

I know mine has trouble setting them and our relationship isn't what you'd define a ""healthy relationship"".

We have nicknames we call eachother with, we text a lot about random stuff and so on... but we still get our therapy work done.

We haven't crossed boundaries to the point of having a romantic relationship tho.

(I've talked a lot about this in my other posts and had many people tell me to stop seeing him, I'm still grateful to them for being so kind with me. I swear I went no-contact with him for a while but he texted me sweetly and I failed again, so I guess you could say you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped)

If you have any questions or things you want to talk about, please feel free to message me."

Anyway I find it funny when people self-diagnose as bipolars without even knowing what it actually means to be bipolar.

And yet I'm here doubting the bipolar 2 diagnosis my therapist gave me..."

I had anxiety too related to how much we'd text, so I asked him multiple times if I could text him a ""Hey what's up?"" from time to time and he's fine with that!

Also he said he's happy when I share things of my everyday life because that's what people do and it means I care about him.

We text almost everyday, even during holidays. I made him promise he'd tell me if I ever texted too much or if he wasn't in the mood to talk, so I'm mostly fine now... even tho I have BPD so I need to be reassured a lot.

(Anyway I'm aware that he lacks boundaries so much it's unhealthy... but believe me, I can't stop seeing him... I just can't...)"
