TrueFilm,ffbjv6a,t3_es4ymu,1579768747.0," THE ELITIST NARCISSIST

Elitist narcissists are self-assured, haughty, energetic and intimidating. Their false façade amplifies an already superior self-image rather than compensating for feelings of inferiority. They do not fear being inadequate, but ordinary. “Ill-suited to subordinate positions among the rank and file”, they gravitate to roles that demand “a swollen, aggressive courage”. They revel in displays of power and flaunt symbols of their status and achievement.  Most idolise recognition and engage heavily in self-promotion, bragging about their accomplishments (real or fraudulent) and elevating all their deeds to appear wonderful and impressive. Unrivalled in the pursuit of being the best, they cannot help making comparisons and turn personal relationships into public contests. Extreme examples fancy themselves as demigods, competing for victory on the world stage with only a handful of worthy adversaries. Some hold the common person in such contempt that they resemble the sadist. Their boasting often exposes the gap between their grand claims and reality, but rather feeling shamed by poor responses, they double-down. They may present grandiose exaggerations about their abilities and compete foolishly when they are already well beaten. Such behaviour frequently alienates others and further deprives them of the admiration they need so desperately, thus deepening their troubles.

Example:  Patrick Bateman, *American Psycho*"
TrueFilm,ff8rc4i,t3_es4ymu,1579692959.0,"THE RISK-TAKING ANTISOCIAL

*Risk-taking antisocials, who combine antisocial and histrionic traits, wish others to see them as undaunted by what almost anyone else would experience as dangerous or frightening.  While others shrink in fear, they are unfazed by gambling with death or serious harm.  Risk is its own reward, a way of feeling stimulated and alive.  Others see their hyperactive search for hazardous challenges as foolhardy, if not stupid. They are thrill seekers infatuated by the opportunity to test their mettle by performing for the attention, applause, and amazement of an audience.  Without their intrepid adventures they would feel trapped by the responsibility and boredom of everyday life.  As they pursue ever more daring challenges, they fail to consider the consequences for their own life and the lives of others.*

InfiniteJest,fejqm26,t1_fej4cp8,1579183372.0,"This is speculation but I suspect that what happens with most writers is that the book comes first, and only later is it possible to articulate the philosophy behind it, which likely emerges during the process of writing itself.  Getting all the interconnected elements to slot together seamlessly is so damn hard that there is very little scope for complex a priori concepts.  So J.K. Rowling thinks, hey I'll blend a school and magic, and the rest evolves organically and largely through the unconscious vagaries of imagination.  So too I presume with DFW - he put his heart and soul into Infinite Jest and unsurprisingly it came out with exactly the settings and themes that grabbed him most because they came from his own life - tennis, addiction, entertainment - and with characters that he knew as real people, just tweaked a little.  The Incandenzas seem so much like his own family.  He is obviously Hal.  And pretty much everyone in the book speaks a little like Hal.  So too the 3rd person narrator.  He has obviously been to heaps of AA meetings and mined those for sayings and characters too.  Then what happens as the story evolves is the author's worldview naturally infuses the pages and in the end the philosophy behind the novel does shine through, for people like us to dissect and debate, but I'm certain he didn't sit down with a blank page and say, right, how do I express 'new sincerity' or 'a potential way out of Postmodern irony and nihilism'?  Far more likely that he had a collection of shiny ideas and images that he wanted to get down and began to explore them and weave them together.  Especially since IJ progresses through a series of very vivid set pieces and people: Eschaton, Orin's Joelle / football epiphany, the girl with fatal beauty, the medical attache and the Entertainment, the wheelchair assassins, the rocky outcrop, the cross-dressing journalist, the guy waiting for his weed, etc. etc.  I'm certain those ideas came fully-formed from a blend of experience and imagination and hit him randomly and he scribbled them down.  Other elements like standardised time or O.N.A.N / separatism etc. strike me as a little more contrived and may have been more 'top-down', i.e. more consciously reasoned out.  I've gone on a bit of a tangent here but those are my wildly speculative instincts."

InfiniteJest,fei6m7g,t1_fegqi04,1579131439.0,"I agree with what you're saying re. Gately but on the whole I don't think being realistic is much of a priority for DFW in Infinite Jest, especially when it comes to the language of the characters.  The tennis kids are absurdly eloquent, insightful and witty for their age.  We can excuse that from Hal because he's a prodigy but the others are also coming up with zingers all the time.  Orin would have to be the most eloquent NFL player of all time.  Unrealistic ability is all through the book.  I remember an essay in school where I wrote something along the lines that the character Richard II was highly deep thinking and articulate and the teacher just wrote 'is that Richard II, or Shakespeare?'  So the same goes here - DFW is making the characters' thoughts and dialogue as sparkling as possible, and so what if that isn't realistic, it's cool to read.  I think it's a danger to read too much into that - if it reflects their status as orphans of postmodernism, that's a happy accident because DFW just wants to show off his skills and otherwise the whole book would be on the level of the Clenette / Wardine section and nowhere as good.  So in the end the characters sounds unrealistically intelligent because they are really different flavours of DFW's own high-level thinking."

It's simultaneously high-brow and low-brow.  He shows off his word play and knowledge then throws in 'like' in the same sentence.  You can go back to Joyce with Ulysses for the first example of this but the difference there is that Joyce's low-brow was always in the stream of consciousness of the character, never in the prose descriptions.  I haven't read much Pynchon but apparently he was a big influence on DFW so you might find more of it there too.  But now that style is everywhere, even in TV shows where characters will say something extremely eloquent and well-crafted but speckled with swearing and street lingo too."
