Hillary and people who support her still refuse to take accountability for the fact that she ran a shitty campaign because my best guess is she thought she had it in the bad. The DNC completely botched the primaries. If you can’t acknowledge that then you lack reason and logic. 

I have no idea why you would even respond with an argument about congressional elections when the person you responded to is talking about a presidential election. Your entire argument is in bad faith imo and not even worth debating because it’s basically pointless."

Honestly it’s great so many Americans now have health insurance that needed it but most people I know still go without it. I stopped paying for mine when I realized it barely covered anything and costs me $240 a month.
