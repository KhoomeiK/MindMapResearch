I can pick up south Florida in most pictures because I’m from there and it’s unmistakable but this is impressive. It’s just a snow covered neighborhood block."

todayilearned,fdfohcl,t1_fdf929j,1578366426.0,"This is definitely the one he was talking about. I couldn’t remember the title thank you!

Edit: maybe I’m thinking of a different one but wasn’t there a similar type of video with no commentary but before the collapse?"
gifs,fdc3opu,t1_fdb4zkv,1578266488.0,"I think about that, but with a kangaroo. Can you imagine seeing this massive creature hopping thru your backyard or across the road like we see deer? Crazy to me. Not sure why it’s so different in my head"

videos,fcztkaq,t1_fczi9nt,1578108372.0,That’s crazy lol how did your dog vomiting make you feel that it ended up ruining your trip? I’m intrigued..  I remember something small and stupid like that could turn the whole trip upside down. Something normally mundane takes on a whole new meaning on acid

No way I could sit through that whole thing on acid"
UrbanHell,fcn5eqn,t1_fcn5897,1577803735.0,"my fault. I didn’t think anyone was actually still attempting to run a store in that “building” or what’s left of it.

But I guess that’s what the poster was trying to point out. I’m a dummy lol sorry"

mobilerepair,fclnned,t1_fcixlr9,1577752053.0,"I still play but mainly my acoustic but I’ve got about 8 guitars total. Most are just wall decorations at this point lol

10 Years was pretty big back in 05-06 when I first heard them and I’ve been a fan ever since. They toured NC a lot back then being that we’re the next state over from where they’re from, TN. 

I met Jesse and a few of the guys after a small show they did.

You can check out my OLDDDD covers on YouTube of a lot of their songs if you search for “optemoz” on YouTube lol warning tho, that was about 9-10 years ago now haha so recording quality wasn’t the best, but I’ve got a few 10 years songs up there!"
mobilerepair,fcipf2n,t1_fcijrpz,1577666697.0,"Absolutely! 

I actually uploaded a guitar instrumental back in like 08 of So Long Goodbye and had a few people contact me and ask to sing over it lol I was flattered but I was just screwing around and the timing was slightly off. Should have uploaded a better one for them to sing on. But yeah the regular and rock versions of that song are among my favs from them!"
mobilerepair,fcigcsz,t1_fciduza,1577662117.0,"That’s awesome! Where did you hear the snippets? IG? I’d love to hear them!

Division is absolutely my favorite too, and Autumn Effect next. I liked Feeding The Wolves too but the machine one and ghosts I didn’t seem to like at all. Just didn’t have that heavy melodic sound from them I love so much.

Here’s hoping the next one does! And autumn is my favorite season too!"
mobilerepair,fcbfnlj,t1_fcbekbf,1577586279.0,"That was such a dope album.. I loved their first and second albums so much.. their 3rd had MOSTLY good songs, but I couldn’t enjoy anything after that 😔

What’s your opinion? Do you like any of their newer stuff?"

mobilerepair,fc5f2bq,t1_fc5egxv,1577455709.0,"I actually started doing this for people back in 2015 because I saw so many getting ripped off. I tell them I’ll check it as if I was buying it.

I caught only 1 at the shop doing this but it felt awesome lol the guy claimed he worked for Samsung. Had a pretty legit looking fake S5 and I just so happened to have a real one and his story quickly changed lol all the sudden he didn’t work for Samsung and it was his “brothers phone”. I told him to get the fuck outta my shop."
mobilerepair,fc3w7z4,t3_efzysq,1577400217.0,"over the last 10 years of having my shop, Ive had to tell at least 7-8 people the bad news that they purchased a fake phone. it always sucks :( especially since none of them went out seeking a knock-off.. 

All of them purchased it by accident on craigslist. feelsbadman"
