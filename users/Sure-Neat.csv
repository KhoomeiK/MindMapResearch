selfimprovement,ff3w2v4,t3_er4be7,1579550114.0,Now I understand that no matter how succesful you're you still need to struggle. But your mindset has changed and it makes me think that I can also change mine!
DecidingToBeBetter,ff05k7y,t3_eqq5an,1579465408.0,I'm happy that you overcame these difficulties! Only when you reached the bottom you started to move towards the surface. And this made you strong! I think each person experiences dark times in his life. The important thing is either you'll fight for yourself or will be defeated. You're the hero not only for yourself but also for those who experience something similllar. Keep it up!

I wanna try it to, really. In fact, I felt it to be so, but I didn't try. Ever. And interestingly, but right before reading your post I was writing about this ripple effect too! )))Coincidence??? Who knows."
getdisciplined,fee8exx,t3_eoocr8,1579028528.0,Thanks for recommendations! I especially liked the tip 8 and 9 maybe because I'm doing it right now. It's a pleasure to be in such a community and know that people improve themselves.
selfimprovement,fe6sa68,t3_eno12m,1578903018.0,"Hi! I don't know if you are a man or a woman, but there's one book I totally recommend for women:""The women who Run with wolves"". It containes a lot of story talles from all over the world, and the author explaines the implicit meanings of these stories. The book helps to understand our nature, listen to our intuition, come back to the ""wild woman"" that is hidded in all the women. It opened my inner world even though sometimes I made myself reading it. Coz it's rather difficult. But it gives the unswers to many questions. Try it!!!"
getdisciplined,fdo1vx6,t3_ema2hu,1578597367.0,"The work on yourself is one of the hardest. While getting rid of my limited expectations I felt this resistance of the body. And got ill. But it's necessary to do,really."

selfimprovement,fdb2y4i,t1_fdb0789,1578253186.0,"I'm sorry for you, really! I think you're still in shock. But we all here on the Earth for something bigger, than we are. Our task is to trust the Universe and yourself. So you have to choose either to think ""why"" or try to do something to become better, to play your role here, on the Earth.
I've been practicing meditation for about half a year and now I relate to the events not like ""positive"" or ""negative"", but like ""what lesson does it give to me? “,"" how can I grow from it? “
I wish you good luck! Everything Will be ok, if you decide it to be so!!!"
selfimprovement,fdaz1vd,t3_ekbj2l,1578251995.0,"The best moment to change yourself is now. Even if you made a mistake, you can change it. We can change everything while we're alive. Today I understood this. 
My husband had a heavy car accident. But everything is ok with him. I thank the Universe that my husband didn't take me and our kid with him. But we asked him. All right side of the car is crashed. And I'm at home...putting our baby to sleep. No one knows how much time is messured for us. So the best moment to change yourself is now."
selfimprovement,fd3xq7y,t3_ejwdlc,1578162543.0,"Thanks for this post! You reminded me to praise myself for the succesful steps towards self-improvement. It took time for me to get rid of   blasting myself for every misstep. Honestly, this bad habit comes back sometimes, but I know what to do."
selfimprovement,fcts2vw,t3_eim6ks,1577956574.0,"You'll certainly do it, if your intention is strong! I did it. My Last year was the one that changed my mindset and my habits. Looking back I only think how I made it possible?)) This is is gonna be even better, because I want it to be so!!! Good luck!"
