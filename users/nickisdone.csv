danplan,ff57e2a,t1_ff53taa,1579582386.0,I know it's not about the money but it's about the principle of the matter I wish there was just something. But maybe stopping the flow of money to his channel into his business. But I just see in our world today he's going to be some corporate man getting tons of money and prays for his past work. This is the way our entire world is going. And I'm sick of being apart of it.
danplan,ff40hg4,t3_ergj9y,1579552864.0,I'm hoping there's some way to sue dam for at least minimum wage but I doubt it. He's probably covered his corporate tracks well it's despicable

AskReddit,few8zir,t1_few8eka,1579406993.0,I actually hadn't noticed that. Is using a speech-to-text app I have a broken screen so I can only read so much. And I had never heard of that drug but I'm sure it made for a hilarious read
coolguides,few4omw,t1_few4g1l,1579405314.0,Yes you can I have everything from goats cattle and even some pet rats the rats need like the 27 gauge needles goats and larger animals can get away with 16 to 18 gauge needles but kind of depends on their page as well and what you're injecting them with. I don't know why so many people hate my comment it's true you can get these needles in any color they're just butt hurt

unpopularopinion,few49r6,t1_few3wvl,1579405155.0,Like I said you believe that I wish you luck never run into cops treat them like vampires because they're trained to only see the bad in to seek it out. They are not required to truly know the law for the truly abide by it. They can arrest you and charge you with something that may not be right and it can take you months and years to deal with I hope you never have to. Believe what you want that's why there are few times when I find people who have gone through the same thing I feel so touched because they want you to believe what you believe and there's no way for us to prove otherwise. Good luck and I beg that you heed what I've said and be very cautious you don't have to believe me but no one deserves this.
AskReddit,few307c,t1_few2m5m,1579404734.0,Everybody treats me like I'm a liar because I didn't get unemployment and because I didn't get to sue them for Millions. What you said it's actually touching. Everyone treats it like if you don't win Millions than you're not right.
unpopularopinion,few2hat,t1_few0lmt,1579404560.0,"See that's the thing as you believe that. And the laws are written in such ways and have such subsections that it can technically be true. But the way it's practice and what really happens it is not. 98% of all charges end in plea agreements 2% ever go to trial! If you have the right to a trial do you really think 98% of people would be signing pelea agreements?

The court will require that you have a retained a lawyer for the trial meaning that you would have had to pay the retainer up front for the lawyer in many cases. They will also ask that you catch up and all your preliminary-round court fees which can be thousands of dollars and it keeps going up each month the preliminary rounds go on. So yes you have to pay before you can go to trial. It doesn't look like it technically because you're not paying for the trial necessarily up front and I guess I did misspeak there. Then if you are found not guilty at the trial you can file for reimbursement. But you will not get reimbursement on your lawyer whatsoever.

I don't know how to explain to you how you cannot defend yourself when you're being charged with any kind of criminal charge. I don't know why this is the case I have just seen it happen. If I wasn't waiting for my charges to be dismissed next month I would tell you the county the state the judges name and who she is a laugh out of the courtroom and on what dates. They are required to have proper representation and if you do not have a license to practice law you are not allowed to provide your own legal representation in the preliminary rounds. And even if you are in the courtroom the District Attorney's office will not speak with you because you're not a lawyer. They will tell you that time and time again. They will want your lawyer number and want to look up the case you're representing. You can scream and holler and say how wrong it is all you want you can even post it on social media and ask for help you can even call all the beneficial legal programs that are out there and you will not get the help you need because so many people are calling in and they have to take what they can and your chances of getting in are very slim. If you don't have the money to fight for your right you don't have them. 

I don't expect you to believe me I'm used to this by now because this is what the system does. To be honest I would rather be dead than go back to that Courthouse even though I know the next time I go everything is going to be dismissed and wiped completely away and clean. I have tried suicide three times been hospitalized once because of it. I don't really say that to get attention just I feel like a fool. I used to help people I would take them up to the courthouse and help them apply for jobs and tell them to just keep trying and say the same things you do that they can get a public attorney that they can file this paperwork. Now I know how much of a lie it is. I know how everybody tells you the same things that don't work. I know how you can't prove anything to anybody. I know how it becomes numbing and you don't even want to try to fight it anymore. The world has proven it's not worth it and that you're not rich enough to be worth their concern. I don't know how to prove it to you I really don't.

I wish I could prove it to everyone because I think everybody would want it changed. But then look at what Snowden did and yet nothing changed look at the way Amazon is treating employees and nothing is changing. Look at the way our Healthcare System even is even if everything should still be private why in our country are the markup so much higher than other countries why is it so much cheaper to travel to another country for a week and receive Healthcare there without any insurance in that country than it is to receive that same Healthcare in our own. I wish I could prove it to you I wish you could have been there with me but at the same time I'm glad you don't know. These laws are perverted and twisted to benefit them."
AskReddit,few0lr7,t1_few00gx,1579403770.0,"Funny thing about this termination. I was having a lot of issues with an employer that particular store I work for. At one point I was even being sexually harassed and I had stopped coming to work and we were going to try to work something out and I was waiting for the response on Tuesday. They file that I had quit my job and I was fired for reporting sexual harassment I had to go to the parent company and wait months for me to finally have a job offered back because honestly I believe I was blacklisted. It was hard enough for me to get jobs in those times but I mean normal jobs that you don't have to put any background for even if you're 50 so long as you're decent no hire you. I couldn't get hired during this time. But I was hired back for a few months all for them waiting for the tiniest customer complaint to fire me over.


Edit: oh and unemployment is a complete joke and almost impossible to really fire file and prove if you've got an employer that is really trying to cut you out. It's disturbing. I had proof that that even altered my time cards at periods of time had text messages and everything even contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity people and pretty much because mine wasn't that important and wasn't such a huge violation and wasn't a giant monetary amount or anyting they were just a little too preoccupied with higher priorities"
AskReddit,fevz4np,t1_fevy4g1,1579403297.0,I was explaining to someone my own issues with the legal system and they want me to prove citations and sources but the thing is a lot of times we can't because the law might say one thing and reality and we might expect one thing but in the way that is practiced and what really happens is something completely different. Like I would seriously rather suffocate then go into that courtroom again or you can go up the steps to that Courthouse or even drive by the police station right next to it to find a parking spot.
AskReddit,fevygy2,t3_eqqutm,1579403152.0,"Your right to an attorney and if you cannot afford one one will be provided to you is a lie. In the state of Oklahoma if anyone pays your bond and bails you out you are considered able to afford an attorney.

 If your bond is set at $2,000 and your mom pays $200 to a bondsman to go to the jail house and bail you out ,you are considered able to afford an attorney that may cost anywhere from $250 to $350 an hour. It doesn't matter what your years income was it doesn't matter if you have a job you have to get to the next day it doesn't matter if they end up dismissing the charges after dragging it on. 

If anyone bails you out you were considered able to afford an attorney. It doesn't matter if your homeless it doesn't matter what your tax returns were it doesn't matter in any other way we are made to prove our income or apply for benefits in any other form.

Just to be clear you can file for a poppers affidavit however it is the judge that decides whether or not you afford a lawyer and I have personally seen a judge laugh people of the courtroom and tell them that they should have thought about that before bailing out. If I wasn't waiting for charges to be dismissed next month I would even tell you what the judges name was what county and what day she left that man out of the courtroom."
unpopularopinion,fevxd6g,t1_fevvm1u,1579402691.0,That's the fucking thing is unless you're going through the system you don't see these things and you don't know these things. The law says one thing but what they do and how they manipulate it and how they charge you is something completely different! I'm sorry to burst your little bubble and I don't expect you to believe me but I've been there I know what it's like and I seen many others and we are looked down upon by people like you because you do exactly what you're doing right now. And we don't have the answers and we can't prove and fight for our rights in court. We just don't have the money to pay for a lawyer to set there and show the proof we have. We may not have the money to file Every Little Bit Of Proof we have. It's a disgusting system where poor people are destroyed and the super wealthy it's nothing to them. I don't know how to prove it to you I can go around looking up some of the post I've gotten in support from other people who've gone through very similar situations I could even point you to Adam ruins everything I know he did a whole thing about prisons but it doesn't really cover a lot of it and I think he focuses on private prisons which aren't as prominent as they used to be. But I also know he talks about lawyers and how you do not have the right to one. You believe you do and I hope to God you never go through what I have been through. Not the same time I hope you go through something just so you know a little bit of it but it's wrong in so many ways.
unpopularopinion,fevu6xt,t1_fevtbsd,1579401555.0,"You obviously haven't ever had anything more than a traffic ticket or maybe you don't live in the United States? Because if 98% of all charges end in plea agreements there something wrong! When a district attorney can up your charges two felonies without having provided proof for any evidence there's something wrong with that! When people can be held in jail houses in the limbo of preliminary rounds for years all for it to be dismissed there is something wrong! You shouldn't have to spend eight years in a jailhouse just for them to finally dismiss your charges because you don't want to sign a plea agreement! And my state if you want to go to trial you have to pay upfront afford $10,000 beforehand. There's something wrong with that! They will hold you in contempt of court. Whatever you believe our rights to be an utter farce in a lie. You're right to an attorney is a lie you do not have the right to defend yourself and you do not have the right to a trial. The Constitution may say that but they've changed those laws and made so many amendments you don't stand a chance unless you have I'd say 15 to $20,000 sitting in savings. And that's just for a 1 misdemeanor charge up the charges to two felonies you might want to throw an extra five to $10,000 on there. The fact that these lawyers become judges and they all live in the same little communities and the fact that many places will require you to get a local lawyer... Well I say require I'm sorry it's not on paper but you can try to get lawyers outside of the area and a lot of times and left there are high-end lawyer that you are paying hundreds of thousands on they won't even bother. This is because all the lawyers know the judges and no other lawyers that deal in that area. Their kids go to the same school most of them went to the same colleges. It's disgusting how much they know each other. Even if they are the criminal defense lawyers. How tight they are with their tight little community in their cops and their entire little legal system they're not there for you. I wouldn't say it's necessarily just the lawyers fault but all the people that go to law school and continue to run the system like this and continue to profit off of it yeah it's their problem and them destroying our society."
unpopularopinion,fevslkd,t1_fevr9s5,1579400955.0,A lot of what this person is saying is a little moot. And what you're saying is moot too. Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is a complete lie when 98% of all charges in the United States end in plea agreements. This is because they can trap you in something called the preliminary rounds where you do not have the right to a speedy trial. And during this time anything you've been charged with is placed on your record as if you are convicted!! The district attorney can up your charges two felonies keeping you out of job keeping you broke and locking you down in a shit life for years until you just sign a plea agreement for the misdemeanor they originally charged you with.
unpopularopinion,fevsd2a,t3_eqqber,1579400869.0,It's not just the lawyers it's the way the whole court system is set up. The moment you are charged with a crime you come up as convicted on every background check. The district attorney can up your charges two felonies without any real cause. You pay for your innocence because the court systems I want you to pay their fees and we'll negotiate better with your lawyer if you can pay those fees. On top of that there's the bond and bail system. Each State's a little bit different but you're right to a lawyer is laughable you have no right to a lawyer. I seen homeless people get denied the right to a lawyer and still having to pay and take out loans and debt or getting thrown back in the jail house in just left there to rot through the years worth of preliminary rounds while they get lost in the system because the district attorney and the judges don't want to look at their case. It's not just the lawyers it's the fact that a cop can arrest you and wrongfully charged you because they're not expected to really know the law and it can take you years to deal with it and thousands of dollars.
unpopularopinion,fevqlww,t1_fevq7tb,1579400327.0,Okay stalker🤣
unpopularopinion,fevpgl5,t1_fevmknl,1579399983.0,"I don't know if they're illegal in the UK but you're right. It's nothing more than blackmail and you paying them off. Thousands of dollars in the tiniest of little fees.

How it starts out as you're arrested you're thrown in the back of the vehicle you're taking to the courthouse and forced to strip down usually given one size of flip flop in males and one size and females that way you're uncomfortable.

They make you sign a paper stating everything they took off of you and if you have cash on you well good luck getting that back. If you don't sign those papers they can't finish their paperwork and you can't get bailed out or even given a bed. And just so you know bail is essentially if you want to leave the jailhouse they want some of your money in order to assure that you will come to your court date. I started off with a misdemeanor with a $2,000 Bond. If I could I could have paid it in my own money and then after showing up consistently the court dates receive all my money back. But it's not setup to be easy for people in the United States. It's set up so that you have to go through a professional bondsman pay them 10% which would be $200 sometimes 15%. Then the bondsman will pay the jail house in the jail house almost won't do business with you unless you're a bondsman that they're familiar with. Anyway you never get your money back from the bondsman that's how they make their money because they're putting up a lot of money hoping you'll show up to your court date. But they also do credit checks and things of that nature.

Am I state it doesn't matter if it's your mother or whoever if anybody pays for you to get bonded out even through a bondsman you are considered able to afford an attorney yourself. An attorney can cost anywhere from $250 to $350 an hour. Most won a $5,000 retainer which is $5,000 up front before they will really start doing work on your case.

And if you show up to court without representation you are considered in contempt of court that whole you can represent yourself his BS and only really counts in civil low Money Matters. They want you to pay the local lawyers they want you to deal with the district attorney that's used to those lawyers all of them live in the same neighborhoods their kids all go to the same schools. It's a right tight-knit community.

Also the district attorney thankfully my mother bailed me out that same day because the next day the district attorney had looked at my case and decided to up the charges to two felony counts. This would have increased my bond to $10,000 and my mom would have had to pay $1,000 to bail me out. If my mother could not have bailed me out I would have sat in that jailhouse for these past three years sleeping on what I can't even described as a plastic mattress that might have been used for child wrestling 50 years ago. It's decrepit and stabs into you from all the cracks in it. You're lucky if you actually get toilet paper I didn't.

And here's another kicker it's all hidden up in court fees and expenses but everyday you spend in that jailhouse it adds on anywhere from $65 to $100 on to your bill at the end of it all. And you can bet that the more of a fee rack up the more they're going to want you to pay for it because if they dismiss it then they're accepting that charge. They also feed you just a bologna sandwich there's no ketchup no mayonnaise no nothing. And they will drag your case on for months on in it took me over a year and a half before I finally signed a plea agreement stating that I was guilty for the misdemeanor and would go on a two-year probation and owed $5,000 to the court systems after paying my attorney 5,000. I was only able to afford that because my grandmother died.

I hate my lawyer and can't change them because they're the ones that get to step down from being my lawyer or whatever and if I owe them money they won't step down. And she considered me already owing her $5,000 at the very beginning when she wasn't doing anything. I've lost everything and any ounce of wanting to try anymore. I can't even log in to accounts anymore without feeling extremely drain from just filling out those linksquares. I've done so many urine test that came back clean but as soon as that background test came back no communication.


 I went without a job for so long I've tried to kill myself so many times because of it. I've lost my will to want to try. I've lost who believe in the system that I even once had. Everyone will tell you you have the right to an attorney and that you're lying I've even been kicked off of subreddits for asking for advice and stating these things.

The only good thing I can say that came out of this is I've learned my lesson and I've learned how to tell what friends are true friends and what aren't and I've learned to never help another human being. It's not worth it life isn't worth it and they're forcing you to be a part of it so why do anything to help them. It'll just hurt worse. All the people I ever helped some of the friends who still owed me more than $6,000 who put me into that because of them. They refused to pay me back they refused even to help me. I ended up losing every friend I've ever had and cutting myself off from society because I couldn't find the strength to even open my door and go outside. But I've learned my lesson once it's over I won't ever look back I don't care who's calling for help just keep going forward and get as far away from it as you can. It's more than traumatizing and it's not the physicality of it all it's just you do what's right and what you've been told your entire life and you try and you file and you will obey the rules and it doesn't matter in the end if you're not rich you don't matter. If I wanted to go to trial I would have had to have $15,000 paid beforehand"
unpopularopinion,fevlwpm,t1_fevkeat,1579398896.0,"But you're not innocent until proven guilty. The moment you are charged with something even if it's dismissed and found to be a wrongful charges against you as soon as you are charged for something it shows up on your background report as if you have been convicted! I know from personal experience. I have lost my job that was making a decent wage to working a job that barely pays minimum wage and has completely removed days and hours of my work I've had to screenshot it to catch people in the act. And even when I reported getting sexually harassed I was fired for it. It took me three years of fighting it but everything is going to be dismissed and dropped finally after 3 years and you want to know what their biggest tank up was they wanted me to pay thousands of dollars in court fees $1,000 of which is just for the district attorney looking at your charges. 98% of all charges in the United States and in a plea agreement. Because they can hold you in the preliminary Round 4 years and each month your case drags on more and more court fees occur which you will be responsible for most of the time. They can also just up your charges whenever they want I went from one wrongful charge of a misdemeanor to the next day having two felony charges against me with no proof and no justification as to why."

I mean that low labor cost from manufacturers in China a lot of them technology-wise are switching to Africa and starting to sit up factories there. Or even local funds may be going to start up factories for outsourcing later etcetera. But I'm just saying that the United States and other countries that have high minimum wages always take advantage of other countries that offer cheap goods for low minimum wage. Don't get me wrong I think the country should kind of Step Up for their rights and things of that nature and get a more equal share at least to help stimulate their economy or social programs. But it's just like people take advantage of anything they can in life not necessarily always in a bad and menacing way just the normal flow of things and how things change.

The titles are usually the same they usually just look like a different cover because they are there paperback cover is not hard back.
antinatalism,feu9i2b,t3_eqmmqv,1579384451.0,"It's not about low fertility it's about women using protection. It's about women putting off relationships. And if you look at people who have money versus people who don't you'll still find birth rates are higher among the poor populations. I think it's all interesting to but you can also look into the behavioral sink experiments that have been done though granted most of them start from very homogeneous bloodlines that are very heavily inbred and don't provide them environmental stimulation but there's a certain point where it seems like animals just stop wanting to thrive and stop wanting to attract the opposite sex. Don't know what really causes it though.

Kind of like how in captivity homosexuality in animals greatly increases. But it could also be the fact that sex food water sleep are all very basic things and when you trap things in a small environment with very little choices they just go with what they got. Some scientists speculate about the entire behavioral sink and if it has to do with the overabundance of resources like food and water and habitat essentially meaning that animals don't have to fight or compete or if it has to do with overpopulation and a set area."

Sometimes the chapters are moved around a bit but usually your school library will have a copy that you can look at and see what the differences are. Also if you have end of chapter assignments which I have only ever had one Professor ever do that with me. Sometimes those will be switched around or completely different questions. They'll be paperback but just to give you an idea I was going to spend about $500 on a chemistry book but I found an international Edition and had it shipped to my house for 80 bucks and it was there in 2 weeks mean while the $500 chemistry book would have taken 4 weeks to ship to me and was about $600 at the school. They're written in English and what the rest of the world uses. The United States and Canada tend to use the overpriced us ones
todayilearned,feu3ixh,t1_fetztcf,1579382751.0,"If you've ever dealt with the legal system with anything more than a traffic ticket you'll find these kind of stories to be overwhelming and all over the place. I don't know what the legalities are behind it. Just like I don't know all the technical legalities as to why I was considered able to afford my own attorney. Another man was the last out of the courtroom for someone paying bail for him. Bail can be 10% of the entire Bond. You pay it to a bondsman and they bail you out for the rest. The bondsman makes that profit whenever you show up for your court date. 

You don't have the right to an attorney in the United States they will charge you for it. They will not supply you with an attorney will give you a list to start calling but you better find one that going to come up to your court date in the next few days while they have you locked down in the jailhouse. You can try to file a pauper's affidavit to get financial assistance but that all depends on what the judges will grant. Hence you getting laughed out of the courtroom for applying for 1. You're not allowed to record or film anything in their Court rooms yet they're allowed to record and film you all the time. It's disgusting. 

If you don't have the money to fight for your rights you don't have them. What makes it even more sad is everybody believe that you have the right to a trial and that you have the right to an attorney. So nobody believes you. They think you're lying just to get money out of them. I don't know what to tell you other than 98% of all charges ended plea agreement only 2% ever going to trial and that's mainly for death penalties. 98% of all charges in the United States end in plea agreements! They don't go to trial. It's very disgusting and disturbing and I don't expect you to believe me.



 I don't expect anyone to believe me anymore when close friends for years have turned on you because they think it's all in your head. When you have given other people thousands of dollars and nobody helps you in return when you can't get a job all because as soon as you are charged whether or not you are found guilty and whether or not they even have any evidence against you if you have any charges filed in the court paperwork it shows up on your background check as if you are convicted and guilty. I will never again help another human being that is dying I will never again give a damn about another person because they don't give a damn about me. 


I have been abused mistreated yelled at and told I am nothing but a liar meanwhile I don't want to mention it but I am highly suicidal and should have just ended it. I should have ended it before any of these Court things ever came to mine. Life isn't worth it, paying into the system and paying for those cops wages along with the lawyers and the judge is not if it's worth it. It's not worth bringing a child into either. I'm disgusted by people more than what I ought to be and I can't help it no amount of therapy or medication or treatment has worked. I wish lobotomies were legal because at least I could have one and be a husk of a person for everybody that wants me around that doesn't really give it to him.


 I once had a decent job that I was actually fairly happy at but ever since these charges have been placed against me I've had to get the bare minimum jobs that are getting away with the racing hours and entire work days from your schedule. I start taking screenshots and caught them in it reported someone else for sexually harassing me by spraying a die down my pants they actually had to pull up my shirt to do this. I was fired. Sure there's all sorts of free legal help you can get if they have enough room for you. There's tons of people begging for help and needing help that don't get it because there's not enough of it out there. They're lined up on years worth of waiting list and maybe they can get to you."

The support I get whenever I mention this is unnerving in a quick way. The sad thing is I paid off all my fines weeks after I signed the plea agreement. My grandmother had died and made sure that out of her money that my court fees in my lawyer would be paid off. I never got an inheritance from her was a sense of her wanting to help me with my freedom. I don't know why they're still dragging out the probation I'm supposed to turn in medical records that I'm still on medication I don't know why that had anything to do with any of it but I've always suffered from some depression this is only made it much worse. But I called up and tried to see if there were any gaps if I needed people to write letters to cover those gaps or get doctors notes or something just to find out no one's been keeping track of any of the paperwork I've been turning in. Not the court clerk not the county clerk not the probation office because I was on unsupervised probation so it was a little bit cheaper...  I am so terrified about going up to that Courthouse and seeing that fucking lawyer of mine and the way she treated me and was able to get away with it and still suck money out of me. I just don't want to see any of them again I don't want to walk in that Courthouse. I live at the edge of the town and I have driven 40 minutes out of my way to avoid going into that town because when I do I find that I'm overly aggressive and upset for no reason. I would have never believed that how much it could have affected someone mentally before. Now I feel ashamed about all the times when I took people up to court and I was trying to be supportive stuff them. How naive was I when I said some of those things and how hurtful it must have been for them because they're the same words that are repeated over and over. The same things that don't work that everybody tells you.

But it'll all be dismiss after 2 years of being on probation which everyone thought was completely asinine. But I just wanted it to go away. Tried killing myself three times. It still hasn't been worth it nor do I think it ever will be. It's not meant for people to fight and it destroys me but at least I know I'm not the only one getting screwed over.

Like have they not seen all the creepy weird shit he's done and all the crap his kids have been arrested for or kicked out of the military for. They've had multiple drug issues and don't tell me a rich family that has a good support system and kids that are raised up well are going to be relapsing on crack multiple times. It's been shown that drug abuse is linked with trauma and other sorts of issues.

 Plus Biden in the way he creepily touches women all the time. That's no one we need to be putting up against Trump. We need a clean slate and someone who actually cares about people. Although Bernie wants a system more like Canada's Healthcare System I think we would be better off first restricting and limiting a lot of the prices Pharmaceuticals can charge. For example the hepatitis cure and America that is the most effective can cost you about $30,000 whereas you go over to Egypt and it'll cost you about 80 bucks. It shouldn't be cheaper to take a vacation somewhere for a week and receive medication or a treatment then it is in the United States.

 I mean personally I'm saving up money to get my dental done overseas. Following a whole bunch of people got a lot of advice and a lot of good news. Seems like the dentist or even better than the ones in the United States because you know they actually have to work on a large amount of people and a large amount of different circumstances not just who has insurance. And I think it would be better if we had maybe a Healthcare System more like France. But that is a very small country but I still like its Healthcare System a lot! The Canadian ones alright but I think we could do better with you know every other developed country having Universal Health Care. We can look at every other country pros and cons population and health issues and make one that's better for our country but I don't think any of its going to be affordable if they're still prices like the hepatitis C cure being $30,000 and hospitals able to charge $2,000 for a $2 pill.

But your vote doesn't matter for the presidential vote unless you're voting for The preliminaries. I still think you should vote that way at Tally's up what people actually want. But they don't do this for local elections where your vote actually matters or where it affects you more. At this point it politicians against people.

That'll give you real estimates of how bad the world is. Also you should look into criminal issues...

Just to give you an idea I thought I knew how messed up the system was. I would take people to their Court appointments and be their moral support. I would help them apply for jobs and all sorts of thanks. I would tell them to just keep trying but they just need to apply to just one more job.

That was until I was wrongfully arrested and charged. I was arrested at gunpoint with attack dogs. I showed no resistance I didn't know it was going on. All they did was yell at me Heckle me and threatened to impound my car and do a whole bunch of other things saying that I had fake my IDs and that my tag was a fake as well screaming and yelling at me from four different officers and my face with their attack dog right next to me waiting for them to just slack up on the leash while I had my hands cuffed and shoved into a vehicle right next to that attack dog.

All in all everything was dismissed but that was after the cops charged me with a misdemeanor and my mom bailed me out for $200. That $200 that my mom used to pay a bondsman to bail me out was seen as me being able to afford an attorney that cost $300 an hour and if I did not provide an attorney by my next court date then I would be held in contempt of court more charges filed in pressed against me and arrested again. A man was left out of the courthouse when he asked for a pauper's affidavit so that way he could file for an appointed lawyer because he spent his savings on the bond.

If you pay in a cashier's check or money order for a bond you get that money back if you pay the entire Bond. If you pay the bondsman you pay 10% of the bond and you don't get the money back the bondsman puts up cost the risk and the money.

Well apparently the district attorney after taking one look at my case but not being there not talking with me not talking with anyone up to me to two felony charges rather than one misdemeanor. This also increases how much a lawyer is going to charge you. Oh and here's another kicker they can keep you on What's called the preliminary rounds which can last for years and has no limitation and you have no right to a Swift and speedy trial. 98% of all charges and then plea agreements they will keep you in their court systems that charge you monthly just because you're still pending they act on your background report as if you've already been convicted so keep you out of jobs and keep you down.

 Meanwhile they want you to sign a plea agreement. They want you to say you're guilty that way you have to pay all the court expenses and they don't just dismiss your charge at their cost.

 The district attorney charges $1,000 just for looking at your case which is their fucking job!"

I didn't even spend an hour in the jail house before my mother bailed me out. She bailed me out for $200 you paid to a bondsman in my state that's considered able to afford an attorney at $300 an hour. 

And my attorney wouldn't progressed my case until I paid her $5,000 for a retainer. Oh and that's all for one charge when the charges were up to two charges and a felony charges overnight just because the district attorney had just looked at my file it increases the cost of your attorney. And if you think you can just get another attorney all willy-nilly well good luck with that too. I learned to never help another human being even if they're choking to never drive anywhere unless you absolutely have to to charge people before you give them anything and that no matter how many piss test you pass and physicals you do that you can apply for hundreds of jobs and just because something is pending as a charge and you're not convicted nor are you seen as guilty by the legal system you can be denied a job just because you're dealing with the legal system and they don't know when you're going to be put away. 

I will never again look at a cop a judge or a lawyer the same. They're nothing more than the mafia.

rant,fesca2f,t3_eqhewm,1579363796.0,I don't know man saying woman to address someone or talk about someone rather than just saying that gal or girl or female around my area is seen as very crude as most people in the sixties inside would just yell at their wife or the woman in the house and just yell woman like that's all you are is your sex. It's kind of like calling a Native American woman a Squaw when you're not a Native American and you don't know her. When female terminology has been used in a negative light for so long it almost becomes a cuss word in certain areas. Just like the N word. Quite frankly I think the N word is just someone trying to say negro but they're too stupid to read and have too much of a backwoods accent and started being words existence but that's probably not true just my interpretation on it.

But I mean everyone still using China as a manufacturing point. So it doesn't matter what name you've got on your glasses or how much you paid for them they all came from the same place

Considering they own about 80% of the world's eye Market I'm pretty sure our glasses all come from the same Chinese manufacturer and the lenses are just popped in and whatever country they want to say the glasses were made in. Zenni opticals a great site

I make snide comments after every class about teacher being too lazy to grade anything or can't even work their own computer to grade it for free instead they have to charge us hundreds of dollars to make them feel like they're worth anything. I've also written letters to the school do I know that doesn't do anything. But Pearson anytime you can hack anything on there or destroy anything of theirs do it! Also if you don't need to pay for that dumbass online class order an international copy!

unpopularopinion,fes69uz,t1_fes57pw,1579361889.0,Yes just how gay rights and people being gay was seen as completely different than straight people a few decades ago. I remember growing up and not thinking gay was a real thing. Like it was just for movies and sitcoms. It took having a gay friend and time for me to realize that wasn't the case. People are just attracted to certain things. People aren't just sexual monsters that will screw anything as much as we would like to believe that. There are some people that are like that yes but majority of people have certain preferences even if it's among the same race of people there are certain facial features or smells or what have you that people tend to prefer and may not even notice on. It's really not that different. You're basing things off of being a pansexual liking someone for who they are and being sexually attracted to that. Most people are not like that! Most people tend to follow into the more General stereotypes of straight or gay meaning they are sexually attracted to gender first and foremost. It would be like saying someone who doesn't want to date black women is racist it's like saying gay people are sexist. It's just a preference just like everybody prefers driving different types of cars Etc
unpopularopinion,fes5q6k,t1_fes4t2c,1579361698.0,Yeah they want to hook people on their crap and it seems like everyone's trying to make their own private streaming service nowadays because YouTube
unpopularopinion,fes5mto,t1_fes4e1f,1579361664.0,Lol spending $5 through YouTube to watch a movie every time you want to watch it as a little ass a mine. Lots of people just pirated or stream it off of other online venues. I don't think I paid to see movies that are released in theaters for years at least five. Let alone anything I want to watch repeatedly it. At first it can be hard to get into to find the quality a videos but once you've been in it it's really not that hard. But it's also like I wouldn't watch any of those movies if I had to pay $5 each time to watch them. They're not that good they're the same old tropes over and over again same old kind of lots. Some of them have good ways of telling their story but in general I find it all very mundane
unpopularopinion,fes4t3x,t1_fes3ib0,1579361435.0,That's like saying gay people aren't gay unless they've met every straight person in the world that have decided that every single straight person in the world doesn't meet their wants.

rant,fefjel1,t1_fefj5iv,1579057574.0,Not near as much as what people would think but I'm sure they have some. It's oysters clams mussels and mollusks that don't have any central nervous system or pain receptors. Fish don't tend to have many either
rant,fefjcsp,t3_eow0mi,1579057544.0,I hope you realize that they're insects and oftentimes eat their own babies. Your point is invalid. Might be a little bit better if you're talkin about pigs and their intelligence and the way that we systematically raise them in tiny little containers. But you're complaining about crabs and lobsters. You're not even complaining about impacts on the environment or the aquaculture issues that might be facing them know you're complaining about pre killing them before boiling them
chemistry,fefj6ad,t3_eow10a,1579057434.0,"Lol yes most of its ingredients are not lubricants at all. Lots of people just use WD-40 but don't realize that first and probably be best to clean off any rust with something harsh and maybe a little bit of abrasive. Then apply the WD-40 it's really good at repelling water and can be good at removing a good amount of rest. And then you should follow it up with the lubricant. Now WD40 has a lubricant version as well. But the basic WD-40 yeah just look up the MSDS. You can literally Google it.

Just to give you an idea a lot of times what companies try to hide or make as a secret formula is a very small percentage of the actual contents of the container. Or even the active ingredients are actually a very small amount inside the container. But kerosene and gasoline have often been used to displace water. Usually diesel.

What we would do when repairing machines we would clean a lot of their parts in diesel gas 8 degrees is a lot cleans a lot and repels any water. Kerosene is also very good very popular"
antinatalism,febfpjv,t1_feba868,1578958323.0,"Oh dear what do you mean it's quite rare I mean I know it's hard for predators to be able to get there till about 1 and every 10 Hunts on average. But they are there are a lot of animals such as chickens and quails that wouldn't live very long anyways and still have very high mortality rates and intestinal parasites Etc. Granite it is survival of the fittest and those with higher immune systems Etc will live longer but gassing pigs is with CO2 it is actually the most humane way to go other than Maybe nembutal. And the reason we've been gassing them is to prevent possible breakouts of diseases like mad cow disease prions are primarily in the central nervous system.


Eventually all animals die from disease or Predator they don't just slip away peacefully from old age. Usually they get hurt or weak or starve. But very many of them do get hunted down. Or left behind and then setup on while they're alive. Quite a few starve to death and it's a very long process.

And yet since you say plants are capable of suffering or communicating that is actually quite wrong they just aren't capable of doing it on a level we quite understand. Just like when people personalized animals too much. Primarily reptiles and things of that nature. But when people project too much they can either insert emotions and feelings into things that may not have them. Such as animals or plants that argument can go either way.

When it comes to pain trust me gassing doesn't have pain the biggest issue is mainly commercializing in the commercialization of the butchering process not necessarily the killing or the animals death. But as for pain that they feel like must say we do the least amount when butchering. You could try to consider things such as how we raise them and enrichment but enrichment is primarily for mental stimulation an expression of natural behaviors whereas how they are raised has a more vast issue. You could talk about when their butchered you can talk about whether or not they're raised with their mothers such as incubating a bunch of chicken eggs rather than letting the chicken go broody herself etcetera

Now the way we butcher chickens I can't say I'm fond of. We should also gas chickens I don't see the slit of the throat being as painless. They do lose Consciousness very fast but even 10 seconds with that deep of a cut and the way blood loss feels and how flush you get and you still feel the oxygen deprivation that you feel whenever suffocating. But also the way they're hung upside down while they're bleeding out and just going down the line and get dunked into water yes all of that is awful and terrible. But they do pass out completely from blood loss and 5 to 10 seconds if not less. Also some places do have requirements to stun the animals meaning their unconscious but you have to do that before you butcher them. It does greatly vary depending on where you live. Hell you could butcher a chicken with a broomstick. I'm not even kidding you you could do it with your bare hands technically though to."
antinatalism,feaj0h2,t1_feag071,1578949469.0,Yes but if they literally don't have the brain cells to cognitively interpret pain. There's a difference between sensing pain or sensing a change in the environment versus cognitively interpreting pain. I e mussels clams oysters can move and react to stress has physically put on them or pain. Yep they have no higher cognition or anything it is literally just a response to their body can move out of Harm's Way in a natural environment. And for Animals such as fish there are many fish species that yes we can say for sure exactly where they feel pain and how much they would feel. There've actually been neural mesh Nets put on rats and fish brains and Fishes were originally where we started off studying some neurology once we had the proper Imaging tools because fish have such fewer neurons than we do firing at any given point so we can more precisely see certain areas of the brain activity. Most commonly used are zebrafish. After that then you go into a lot of times the farming fish. They've extensively study pain receptors and those as well. When we start getting up at the cows and pigs and geese and things of that nature then you have more of an argument. And considering certain places pork is very valued for its in the US it's mainly the bacon it seems. But then again you also have to argue about is it better to just kill them all like we kill three million dogs every year and not use them whatsoever and just throw them into a pit. People cherish dogs in the United States yet the way they're treated all in all does not reflect that. There are many shelters in my surrounding areas that put down 400 dogs every month. That's how much people are producing them and it's not purebreds or puppy mills like you would think in my state anyway. Most of it says backyard breeders and people too poor to pay to get their dogs fixed. While I understand the endocrine issues there is ovarian saving surgeries that can still fix your female dog remove the uterus but leaving the ovaries for hormonal treatment and to prevent endocrine issues

unpopularopinion,fe9wnil,t1_fe9175a,1578942121.0,"I refuse tips from people that try to hand me tips. Most people where I have served when I bring them their receipt if I see them riding a tip I told him that's not necessary. I'm actually very unpopular among my fellow servers because I let people know I don't accept tips. Sometimes when I bring out their meal I let them know I'll be happy to serve them I am paid an hourly wage and they are not required to tip me and that I discourage tipping. I generally also let people know that if you're going to tip on card you might as well just throw the money away. If you're going to tip and try to help people out you might as well just give them the cash that way it can go under the table and not reported.

Well yes some people do get through and I occasionally get the tips bonus I do not rely on it and like I said I tell people I discourage tipping. Especially card tipping. A lot of people try to tip more once I tell them I don't support tipping and don't think that they should be paying extra for me to serve them unless they make a mess that is asinine. I've even made a point to them when they pointed out will sweetie you don't make much I pointed out to them that the dishwasher and back who doesn't serve tables is constantly working right next to the kitchen in the Heat and wet and doesn't get tips.

And whatever servers you know probably aren't working enough hours or getting a shit ton of money in tips. It is illegal for any company that is using you as a server to allow you to make less than minimum wage an hour. Now if you make more in tips they can drop the state minimum wage or the federal minimum wage to a lower server minimum wage but that's because the rest is made up in tips. The saving the company more and proving my point that no people shouldn't be paying tips it is the employer's responsibility to make sure you get that minimum wage of at least $7.25 an hour by federal law each state has different and may have higher minimum wage requirements. That whole I only made $100 in 2 weeks is total lie and bullshit and only from people who get a shit ton of tips or who don't work but maybe 10 hours in 2 weeks."

todayilearned,fe9ses6,t1_fe9i7rp,1578941044.0,"It is extremely toxic to Aquatic ecosystems. The reason why is because a lot of times it just sits right on your skin. Overtime zinc oxide and titanium that's usually used in the beauty industry if at a certain Micron can slowly embed themselves slightly in the uppermost layers of your epidermal skin giving you an away a slight sunscreen protectant. But that's only after days of application three times a day and we don't know how long it takes for your skin to push it out as that directly had not been studied.

The reason these metals are bad for aquatic ecosystems is because when you go swimming with them on you may not know but a little particles come off every time these are tiny microscopic particles of metal and a lot of these corals and sponges and filter feeders suck them up and it kills them."

antinatalism,fe9q8t7,t1_fe9md28,1578940484.0,"Some animals feel pain. Also there are certain animals that feel pain different ways. And how quickly the pain can be alleviated through butchering or through a Slaughter process. I can't see any difference in a plant and a human being personally. But that's the way I was raised your raised knowing that your life is because many others have died and continue to die so you may live not just for a day but for one meal.

Generally animals that have less brain power or certain parts of the brain aren't nearly as developed Evolution wise they don't feel as much pain. Like fish fish don't have very many pain receptors. Mollusk clams etc those don't even have a central nervous system just like jellyfish. If you're really scientific the line becomes very blurred really quickly. Kind of like the whole debate on whether or not viruses are alive or not we tell people they're not because they don't sell all of the requirements for the textbook description we have on life. However if you really watch it and you are really into varo ology and the fact that 7% of our human DNA has viral Footprints meeting at some point a virus that was not harmful to us worked its way into our genome as an entire human race. 

Also if you're clearly going off pain then it might help you to know that a lot of domesticated animals have reduced brain sizes including farmed salmon. The reduced brain size actually is a reduction in a lot of their sensory areas they've lost a lot of the things that would make something more panicky in nature. Maybe they don't see as well maybe they're not as reactive to the environment maybe they don't feel a sense of urgency maybe they don't get stressed out near as much because maybe they don't produce cortisol like normal animals to stress them out to a point of reaction. And then you also got to go off of how they died in the wild how they live in the wild how many of them even make it past infancy. I consider all of those things but I also kill my own meat. Well not all the time there are times where I get pizzas when I'm hanging out with other people and let's face it sometimes the break rooms are just full of pizzas and that's all you get while you're at work that day."
antinatalism,fe9lfyk,t3_eo7md9,1578939099.0,"Life is all about consumption. It has been from the very beginning. We hate the way businesses are treating people and running them into the ground they're doing it more systematically the nature ever did though. Trust me raising them and slaughtering them is more Humane than the way they would die in nature. So I don't like the way we were raised them or agree with the way a lot of places slaughter them. But the world's about consumption and if you were to ask me whether I'd rather be shot in the head or die from a parasite infestation or be taken down by lions and slowly chewed on as I bleed out to unconsciousness then I'm going to choose the bullet. Just saying I know yeah they have a chance at least in nature but realistically from the moment they are born to adulthood generally only about 10% of animals make it past their first breeding year. And that's a very general vague estimate but in general you can expect one-tenth of The Offspring to even make it past the first breeding here. A lot die off early in infancy then again right when they separate from their mother generally and then there's a high die off right around the reproductive cycle. I'm guessing it's malnourished females that are pregnant and such. They might be able to burp their babies and then both the parent and the babies die off shortly after maybe within a few days.

I mean I'm not saying it's necessarily a reason but there's no reason for anything to be living or existing. We just happen to Value animals and others perceptions it's not necessarily that they value ours. It's about us it's a human thing has nothing to do with nature reproductivity nihilism Auntie nihilism. That would be like why don't we just kill all the carnivores that way there's no more killing but then they're still parasites and diseases and then overgrazing Etc.

Honestly there's a part of me that thinks that are legalizing of sex workers has been a ploy this whole time to make all sexual acts seem like they need to be purchased and prostituted out so that way all the acts are illegal and if someone's being a pedophile you won't report them or some shit. I mean technically you're both doing illegal things and the United States that's why a lot of crime is reported say some girl was smoking pot or drinking underage and got raped the drinking is a little more acceptable but generally charges and everything would be filed against the victim as well.
