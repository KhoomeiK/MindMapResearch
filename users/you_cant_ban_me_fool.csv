nfl,ff9ke1q,t1_ff904lb,1579714858.0,"yeah but he's been in the league as a top WR for a long time now and he's never been in the headlines like he has the last year. I follow football and I really knew nothing about him other than the fact that he put up crazy Fantasy numbers. Ever since he decided he didn't want to be on the Steelers, he's been in the news like once a week, like he flipped that switch to turn into TO or OchoCinco. Maybe that's what happens when elite WRs feel their ability start slipping, they start crying out to stay in relevance, but as far as we know AB hadn't even started declining when he started doing bizarre shit. 

It's really bizarre behavior, it's just hard to believe that the AB we have seen this last year is the same one who didn't make any bad headlines for years at time since joining the league. This guy we're seeing seems like the type that would be in the headlines once a month for one thing or another."

I think that hit, combined with all the other large hits he's sustained in his long football career, really caused some serious brain changes and damage.

But there is players like Randy Johnson who doesn’t have PEDs associated with his name and he didn’t hit his prime until 37-38 but he’s a pitcher. Ichiro didn’t decline until 35-36, so it’s really impossible to predict with any confidence."

nfl,ff1zveb,t1_ff1xd1f,1579490089.0,I certainly started getting a little spooked when they kept scoring while the niners kept going 3 and out there for a little bit.
nfl,ff1zs1i,t3_er6rp2,1579490022.0,"
The Niners defense is really good and you need a really good defense to win big games with your running game because you can’t rely on rushing if your team goes down 2-3 scores. 

However, I don’t think it’s good enough to win the SuperBowl with the offense strictly rushing like the Niners did tonight and last week.

Jimmy G didn’t have to work the last two games but he’s going to have to make the big plays in the SuperBowl and the game is going to be much more on his shoulders than it has lately and that’s going to make this SuperBowl really exciting because he’s capable and so is Mchomie.

These teams are pretty evenly matched and I think the game is going to come down to the last possession. Either Jimbo or McHolmes is going to be in a situation where they can win the game on the last drive, that’s my prediction. It will be interesting to see who clutches it."

AutoDetailing,fej3fib,t1_fehaokp,1579155435.0,"Another problem is Amazon doesn’t check the legitimacy of the titles or claims sellers make about products. 

One very large example of this that I ran into was when I was trying to buy a headlamp. Mind you the most powerful headlamps probably come in around 1000 lumens, if that, but it’s like clickbait with videos, once one person does it and gets more views because of it then everyone does it and they keep upping the insanity.

So, in the headlamps section you’ll see all these headlamps being claimed to output 5,000 lumens then you’ll see 6,000, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k!!! For $30. All of these headlamps have 1000lms tops. I bought a decent pair that took 18650 batteries for 20-30 dollars, an actually very solid buy but I had to give it 1 star because it claimed 6k lumens. 

I actually have some knowledge of lumens because a few years ago I was in the market for the most powerful flashlight I could get for under $100 and after some research I ended up buying the Thorfire S70, which I still have today and is an amazing flashlight. It cost $70 and has a max output of 3,000 lumens and that thing is super super bright. Way brighter than my “6,000” lumen $25 headlamp.

The problem is the average person doesn’t know anything about lumens, so they select whatever the brightest is, get the headlamp and see it’s a good and decently bright headlamp and give it 5 stars.


Amazon needs to do some serious cracking down on the products on their site because right now they have a virtual monopoly and this issue of lies and poorly made products seems to be opening a hole in the market for another entity to come in and capitalize. I could see a company take advantage of this and decide to sell a lot less products but only sell quality, accurately described products and people would probably be willing to spend more if they knew they were getting that."

AutoDetailing,fegpsqt,t1_fegnq4o,1579099663.0,"yeah, I've gotten good at deciphering fake reviews and it's no secret that tons of products have lots of fake reviews, if a product has less than 50 reviews I’ll go through the accounts of the reviewers to see what else they reviewed and their wording etc, but I guess there’s websites that do that now. I've seen products where the company responsible for the fake reviews messed up and the product review page had 100s of reviews describing completely different products in each review. As another commenter pointed out, these reviews seem to be legit, I think anytime the reviews get into the 1000s you can rely on them but who knows anymore."

Now, should one only have the right to complain about fraud if they made sure to purchase the more expensive option? 

Should Honda owners not be able to complain if their airbags are filled with Whoopie Cushions because they bought the car because it cost less than a BMW?

I def think alcohol contributes because I haven't gotten an episode since stopping drinking. 




It took awhile to learn but there's only one way out of an episode, you can't panic, you can't try to wake up or move or scream 'mom!'(I always wondered if I actually yelled mom out loud when I would try to during an episode) but you need to just let it take you. You need to relax and try to go back to sleep, then you can wake yourself up.

todayilearned,fc60j0n,t1_fc5rn1e,1577469586.0,"is it AWD too? I'm surprised I've missed that car, AWD is a must for me as my 2WD Accord gets stuck in literally to smallest amount of mud."
todayilearned,fc606p8,t1_fc5s733,1577469407.0,"It's really hard for the first month, at least getting moving consistently and quickly from a stop was for me, once moving everything is super easy, I'm not sure why they didn't make a manual that couldn't stall in first and would just idle like an auto, that would actually be really nice because you could chill in traffic and still have a fun manual everywhere else, but while not difficult in traffic once you get it down, it's still constant work and having to stay aware. I find it fun now but I can see it getting annoying if you commute in traffic every day, I couldn't do that."
todayilearned,fc5zwtj,t1_fc5q1y6,1577469258.0,"With autos it just so easy to put the pedal down and speed up 30-50 mph, with the manual I might put the pedal down but I rarely keep it down after I have to shift, I still speed more in the WRX but that's only because I've only had super old slow cars before."
todayilearned,fc5zml5,t1_fc5lcnp,1577469111.0,"What are the other models? I've been a fan of WRXs since the blob eye was the most recent model because it was a 'good handling sports car', AWD and could be purchased for around 20k with less than 70k miles. I would have been a fan of any car that fit near those requirements, but there simply wasn't any other cars that I could take off roading and still have fun in the winding roads. There should be a bigger market for this type of car, but it seems to be unique."
todayilearned,fc5yf28,t1_fc5v9ap,1577468458.0,"I'm almost 30 and I've never sped on the highways, only back roads sometime and I've never gotten a speeding ticket. I've had the WRX for 2 months and I can already tell I'll be getting my first speeding ticket sometime in the next year. The car is just so fun considering it's 25k new, I mean you could get a Honda Accord for that, which I have and this car is so much better aside from commuting in traffic, this would suck for that. I'm getting beefier sways and coilovers because the stock suspension has a little bit to much roll for me, but once I get those installed I already know it's going to be insane in the membrane."
todayilearned,fc5xzlt,t1_fc5nh12,1577468234.0,"Lol I just recently got a WRX and I've never noticed how many people own Subarus, it's insane, I've owned Toyotas and Hondas but I never noticed nearly as many in my area.

Almost every non-WRX is a young just had kids type couple in their 30s-40s or someone in their 60s. For WRXs, I haven't seen anyone under 25 driving one."
todayilearned,fc5xmat,t3_egb6ru,1577468023.0,"I'm almost 30 and I have a WRX and I've never seen someone older than me driving a WRX. Amazingly fun car for the price tho, really can't beat it. Put 3k into suspension and maybe a tune and you got yourself a car on par with 40K+ sport cars."
