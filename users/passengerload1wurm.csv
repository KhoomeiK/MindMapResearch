piercing,ff5p1h6,t3_erf1jg,1579604103.0,My piercer told me 6 weeks for my nipples. There's no harm in going back to your piercer any time and asking them to assess whether or not your piercings are ready to downsize

AskReddit,feelutx,t3_eodtd1,1579036381.0,"A guy I know that fucked up his long term relationship due to problems with alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. He put his ex into $60k of debt and after he committed to changing multiple times she'd finally had enough and left him. She's flourishing while he wants nothing more than to have her back but never put the effort to keep her while they were together. I don't think he'll ever change"
piercing,fdmtlls,t3_elyoxv,1578565163.0,Looks like you're got a bit of room under your first lobe. Maybe a stacked lobe piercing? Always loved the look but don't really have the room for one myself. Either that or a forward helix (triple?)
piercing,fdmtd3e,t3_em79hi,1578564837.0,What exactly is the problem? I'm not sure I fully understand your issue. Is it the divot under the too ball you're worried about? Because if so it may just be from swelling and if your piercer says not to worry about it then I'm sure it's perfectly fine
piercing,fdmouq1,t3_em6kp8,1578558545.0,"1. Do your research, find a piercer and a shop that you trust. You're not in any hurry to get it done so put in the time to find a good place with sterile procedures
2. Follow aftercare instructions to the letter, you won't get an infection if you take care of it properly
3. If you do end up with an infection DO NOT REMOVE THE JEWELLERY, it will cause more problems than it solves. If you're concerned, visit your piercer and get their advice on how to proceed
4. Prepare to not be able to remove the jewellery and keep it out for quite some time. Depending on what type of ear piercing you want/get, it could take up to 12 months to heal fully and even longer before you can take your earrings out for extended periods of time. It will be hard to keep them a secret so if you're adamant that you don't want people to find out you have piercings, get them in a more discreet place. E.g. septum (circular barbells can be hidden relatively easily, CBRs can not), nipples, navel

Hope this helps! Good luck on your piercing journey"

abusiverelationships,fdjrlve,t3_elqxjw,1578484892.0,"I've been there. It can be really overwhelming to hear an outsider's perspective on your experience because I believe we get really good at downplaying what we went through (that was my experience anyway). I've found it helpful to repeat the positive words my therapist used to describe me, such as survivor rather than victim. She once told me that she thought I was so full of wisdom and that I was really thriving. That memory still pulls me out of troublesome thoughts. It'll get better, I'm sure :)
Take care of yourself OP"

I've forgotten how people just enjoy being in water. My case isn't too severe so I can still bathe with only mild discomfort but getting sweaty, or being caught out in the rain really sucks in a way that it didn't used to. I also can't get water in my eyes anymore without them getting very itchy and red, that's a more recent development"

Seriously though that's really harsh. I'm a middle child so I've experienced my fair share of the parentals not giving a fuck about me but this is extreme. It seems to me they don't see what they've done wrong either, which is just plain bad parenting. NTA"
