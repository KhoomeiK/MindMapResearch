JustNoSO,feux2ce,t1_feuw2sx,1579390816.0,"So I’m fully aware this is none of my business, but you’re being pretty cruel right now. I’m sure you’re not a bad person — I think we could all just stand to be a little kinder to people. This might be a good opportunity for that?"
JustNoSO,feuh701,t1_feu0hsn,1579386552.0,"It’s all of our responsibilities to work on the problems we have and to try and be better, regardless what the source of those problems are. We all have to take responsibility for our lives and our actions. 

That being said, it seems like OP’s partner was doing a lot more to traumatize the child in this situation. I’m only going off what OP said, and of course there are two sides to every story, but it seems to me witnessing someone standing over a stove crying wouldn’t be as traumatizing as witnessing physical violence."
JustNoSO,fetns81,t3_eqhwuq,1579377338.0,"It absolutely was not your fault. I have OCD myself, and trust me when I say the right person will work with you. They won’t make you feel guilty or crazy. 

I’m sorry this happened to you."
AskReddit,fekdgjv,t1_fej32rn,1579197740.0,It worked! Thanks so much!
AskReddit,fej218r,t1_feir671,1579154017.0,Can you try the link to your Pandora station again? It’s not working for me and I’d really like to have a listen.

Thisismylifemeow,fe3ahth,t1_fdyyw65,1578847513.0,I have an identical picture of me and my Maine coon! I wonder what it is that makes them want to sleep on our chests.
tuckedinkitties,fe37d68,t1_fe0a45i,1578846636.0,"You seem like a wonderful person and I can feel the love you have for your wife and Ti from this post. 

I also want to say thank you for being there for your wife. I have MS, and you wouldn’t believe the stories I’ve heard about spouses abandoning their partners after things started getting rough. You’re both clearly strong people to be where you are now. I’ll be sending good vibes to all three of you. Best of luck."
mentalhealth,fdyndbr,t3_enea94,1578781672.0,"This is a hard one, and definitely shares similarities to how I was feeling when I was at my lowest point. For me, I knew there was never going to be some “catch all” that would fix everything, but there are some things that I did to help chip away at those feelings. 

As dumb as it sounds, getting a hamster was a huge help for me. It wasn’t the hamster in and of itself, but it gave me sense of purpose. Some days, knowing that I needed to feed and play with my hamster was the only thing that got me out of bed. The point is, if he can find a sense of purpose (no matter how small) maybe he can start chipping away at those feelings."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdg0g2a,t1_fdfrpop,1578375556.0,I’m confused about why this makes you so angry.
AmItheAsshole,fddt5jh,t1_fdcy1lc,1578323324.0,"I’m with you on this. I have a severe tree nut allergy and I don’t take an epipen with me everywhere, for a few reasons. 

1. I am very cautious with what I eat and always check packaging/ask chefs if there is even a question. 

2. The cost, as you mentioned. That shit is expensive and they expire quickly. 

3. As you and others have mentioned, you have to go to the hospital anyway after injection. Unless your throat is going to be completely closed in seconds, just go to the ER (which will still be a hefty bill). 

Point is, I agree with what you’ve said and I think people are being too hard on you."
TrollCoping,fdc7c2b,t1_fdc2qb8,1578268525.0,"Girl all of that rings so true to me! Even if you brought your meds, I doubt they would’ve let you take them. I had all mine with me in my purse and they didn’t give me any of them. Cue me going in to serious withdrawals and getting serotonin syndrome - I felt like I was dying and they wouldn’t call me doctor to get the okay to give me my meds even when I was pleading with them. 

I’m sorry you went through that. Sometimes I think the hoops they make is jump through are just boxes they can check to say they’ve tried. If the system wasn’t stretched so thin and if half of these people actually cared about us, you can be damn sure we’d be treated differently.

I’m just blessed that I found a doctor that cared and helped me, he saved my life. And it only took six years of treatment to find him (; 

PS. I’m also immunocompromised and I would have lost it. I can’t imagine how that felt for you, what a horrible experience."
TrollCoping,fdatics,t1_fdasahe,1578249938.0,"Yup. They took my phone (which I know is normal) BUT told me that I had to correct my behavior in order to get the privileges to earn their phone (that “behavior” was me getting pissed when they pulled out a permanent dermal piercing). When I did, it was still only 20 minutes a day and most times I was conveniently in group during phone time. 

I asked multiple times to call my psychiatrist and family, and asked them to call my psychiatrist, again to no avail. 

The kicker? THERE WAS NO DOCTOR ON-SITE. I had a fucking ten minute Skype session every day with a doctor in a different state. It was nuts. 

I was three days in and in the thralls of serotonin syndrome before my psychiatrist was even told what happened."
TrollCoping,fdaec9p,t3_ekdtj3,1578245165.0,"Hi all, I’d like to share a cautionary tale...

While it is always important to answer these questions honestly with your doctor, beware that answering “yes” to the question of suicidal/homicidal thoughts while in an emergency room will likely be a one-way ticket to the psych hospital. 

Once I was having a panic attack that would not stop, so I went to the ER. They were asking me all the usual questions and I answered “yes” to suicidal/homicidal thoughts (because I have OCD and these thoughts are daily, even though I have zero intent). I tried to explain I had no intent, but it was to no avail. 

Next thing I know, they’re telling me they’re “transferring me to another hospital”, I’m forcibly strapped down, all my belongings are taken, and I’m thrown in an ambulance and not allowed to contact anyone I know. 

As you can imagine, my panic attack was GREAT after that ordeal."
bipolar,fczdhwr,t1_fcxvgp1,1578098756.0,"Good for you! I’m glad you stood up for yourself. I hope they realize they were in the wrong and correct their behavior. Or, that you can find a new group that treats you right."
bipolar,fczd4a1,t1_fcyt9ol,1578098528.0,"Okay I really need to read up on this because this sounds very familiar... 

When I first got diagnosed my periods of mania and depression were very distinct. However, the last few weeks I’ve been exhibiting symptomology of both, so I’ve been very confused. Thanks for the info."
bipolar,fczciuy,t1_fcz80aw,1578098176.0,That’s what I’ve been saying all day. Let’s just smoke out Supreme Leader Khamenei and I’m sure we can work this out.
bipolar,fcyqejj,t1_fcx3m9b,1578084950.0,"Hold up now - someone explain to me about mixed episodes. You can be manic and depressed at the same time? 

If so, that explains a lot..."
bipolar,fcxrlrg,t1_fcxln96,1578069490.0,"Have you expressed these feelings to them? 

It could be something simple like: “I appreciate the offer to go out, but it hurt my feelings that you didn’t acknowledge me on my birthday.” 

It doesn’t have to be some big, dramatic blow up, but imo they need to know that they’ve hurt you."
mentalhealth,fcwk5oo,t1_fcwjtdr,1578027844.0,"You right. 

My thing is, idk what I’m gonna do with all the life ahead of me? The last ten years have been plagued by mental illness and a bunch of garbage and thinking about continuing to exist in “this” is exhausting and scary."
mentalhealth,fcwjdze,t3_eja8in,1578027219.0,"I just turned 25 and definitely had a full-blown existential crisis thinking about “being old”. 

But hey, everything is relative. We aren’t that old yet, and we have plenty of time to fulfill everything we want in life."
bipolar,fcwiwzd,t3_ej8dv6,1578026848.0,See if your doc will prescribe you Zofran - it’s a big help.

I’m really sorry this happened. I hope you can take a day soon to pamper yourself and give yourself a do-over birthday. Good luck."

Good luck, friend."
mentalhealth,fcwhp7j,t3_ej8qg5,1578025905.0,Could it be dissociation?
mentalhealth,fcuoend,t3_eizlqk,1577985281.0,"I just remind myself that my thoughts, feelings, and actions are three separate entities. Just because I have the bad thoughts, doesn’t mean I will carry them out. Thoughts and actions don’t have to be fused - they can coexist on their own."
gatekeeping,fcovjft,t3_ehz1wt,1577842735.0,"I have multiple different mental illnesses and making jokes is one of my main ways of coping 🤷🏼‍♀️ Everyone handles things differently.
