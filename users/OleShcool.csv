povertyfinance,ff3ajtm,t1_ff2r9sz,1579537441.0,Definitely. If you can save up enough to buy the car outright then it can make sense though. No monthly payments and you can just run it until it dies without putting money into it. Buttt if the transmission goes out a few months later then you’re out your entire investment! I’d still say cheap lease.

Because if you’re making payments, I’m not convinced finding a cheap lease for a new car isn’t a better option for poor people. General maintenance on an old car is expensive and adds up quickly. A few years ago I leased a new Toyota Corolla for like 79 bucks a month and obv all maintenance was free. Now I’m paying 200 bucks a month for an old Subaru and with the money I’ve put into plus what still needs to be done, it’s put me in a much worse financial situation."

Did you skim over when I said the numbers are skewed? And also the part where I said a lot of the education system needs to be reformed? If you use numbers with actual context, we wouldn’t be as high as your links say.

NoStupidQuestions,few9otk,t1_fevx8v4,1579407238.0,"Those links do not dispute what the person you’re replying to said, and is receiving downvotes for. *Most* teachers *are* underpaid in the US. It’s great that our average is top 5 and around 50-65k a year. But that’s being heavily swayed by high paying districts and high COL areas. Anecdotally if I were to get lucky enough and find a teaching position in Long Island, I’d be making 100k+. Where I currently live, starting salary is around 40k. 

There are many places, specifically in the Midwest I know of, that are severally underpaid and you will see teachers with 15 years experience still making 30k with no raises in sight. The education system needs a lot of reform, including minimum teachers salary."
