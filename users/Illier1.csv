40kLore,ff8n3f0,t3_erm8vs,1579686811.0,"Well it wasnt originally meant to be this way. Big E and Dorn were planning on restoring the planet and make it a gorgeous palace world for all of humanity.

But not only was the planet already hot ass to begin with but 10,000 of poor planning and urban sprawl has taken its toll."

40kLore,ff8j0re,t1_ff81omp,1579680717.0,"Ollanius Pius wore a crucifix around his neck and Catheric is pretty obviously just an aged version of the word Catholic.

Theres no doubt some small sects of christianity or other old world faiths out there."
40kLore,ff8ix32,t1_ff80ur9,1579680579.0,Odds are the Imperium wouldn't exterminate them outright. Its pretty easy to incorporate the current Imperial Faith into christian ideals. Just say Big E was God and Sanguinius his son.
40kLore,ff8itnq,t1_ff87cyf,1579680452.0,"Most souls cast into the Immaterium after death will be consumed in the sheer force of the chaos, if you survive that odds are some Daemon will. Only the mightiest souls like Primarchs and Big E can endure."

FunnyandSad,ff8fgk1,t1_ff7b7s5,1579676178.0,"Yeah especially in the first half of the year I'm looking at jobs sites and there are tons of positions opening in the last few days. The issue is for a lot of new entries is they all get out at the same time and money dries up for companies so they stop hiring.

I've been through it all, it sucks, but sometimes they gotta accept if they cant find a job in their hometown or dream location they need to look elsewhere."
FunnyandSad,ff8fbew,t1_ff6oca4,1579676013.0,"What defines ""sane""?

Neither of those fields were ever there for average people. You need to be damn good at that you do if you want to make any headway into the arts or philosophy."
FunnyandSad,ff8eza7,t1_ff7zez3,1579675622.0,"CS is high in demand because literally everyone needs computer nerds.

Not everyone needs journalists, artists, and academics. Those are niche positions, as well as many that are kind of on the decline."
FunnyandSad,ff8evjm,t1_ff6m8ob,1579675505.0,"Lots of kids dropped out, couldn't find a job, or are in a job the dispise and flee to reddit.

me_irl,ff8eals,t1_ff875ee,1579674842.0,"14 year olds at Chick-fil-A are barely allowed to be there. I think they cant work more than 3 hours a day and can only work on specific days depending on state work laws. They also can't work any kitchen equipment or other machinery so they're basically wiping tables and working a register.

It's pretty rare for them to hire 14 year olds and only so so with special exceptions."
relationships,ff8790i,t1_ff7z793,1579667995.0,"I mean the relationship wasnt functioning before.

Him having a non-sexual friend isnt an issue. Shes just mad she has to remember her humiliation. Hell she probably thinks hes going to cheat on her because that's what she thinks she would do in this situation."
WTF,ff838ol,t1_ff81vue,1579664810.0,"The basic idea of religion is establishing rules and ideas to explain the unknown or mysterious. Pretty much all religions at their core were made not to dominate, but to make symbols to represent a society's culture and values.

The big problem lies when people completely put their trust in religious heads when almost every mythology and faith are pretty adamant that you shouldn't do so."
WTF,ff82vxz,t1_ff6fd87,1579664549.0,That's more Broly
news,ff82cwq,t1_ff800l6,1579664162.0,"It's not even CEOs. Our government is completely behind in this.

A part of me thinks it's a mix of old politicians who have no idea how advanced the internet has gotten other than as a propaganda machine and current intelligence organizations refusing to change because it's a skillset completely outside their traditional methods."
news,ff7z3g1,t1_ff755fz,1579661806.0,As wealthy as he is you bet hes probably talking to heads of state and other key figures on a semi-regular basis. You never know what the rich and famous talk about.

40kLore,ff7r7w1,t1_ff7ofx3,1579656396.0,"We've also only seen Sanguinius once...

Primarch spirits endure far longer than normal souls. Magnus is still around after being essentially shattered. And the Emperor called forth Manus' spirit from somewhere. It's no far stretch to assume Sanguinius and potentially other dead Primarchs are floating around in the Warp.

Except Horus who was basically deleted from all realms by Big E."

40kLore,ff5xr4e,t3_erqaqc,1579613715.0,They're extinct in the galaxy as is. There are some claims they might gave fled outside the galaxy but its doubtful.
40kLore,ff5xlk1,t1_ff5t4lg,1579613581.0,"Primarchs are more than just flesh and blood though. We know Primarchs are hiding out in the Immaterium and perhaps if they die their souls are far too powerful to just be cast into the storm.

I dont think Sanguinius will ever come back in a physical form, but hes always watching over his Blood Angels."
40kLore,ff5roie,t1_ff5q1f2,1579607617.0,"Sanguinius is basically a spooky Ghost in the Warp now who guides the lost souls of Astartes when they are near death. He bailed out Dante from dying on Baal.

Hes not back, hes always been there watching his sons."

GodofWar,ff5loxo,t1_ff5jbe5,1579599018.0,"Nah you're forgetting about the 3rd antagonist, Freya. She wants Kratos to know the pain shes endured. Eye for an eye, son for a son. Hes going to be trapped on Midgard while Freya and Odin warp Atreus into Loki, a vengeful Jotunn who will go down the same path Kratos did with the Olympians.

Kratos wont die to Thor, that would be too easy. Kratos will stay where they think he cant get to them."
GodofWar,ff5ejqb,t1_ff53t3j,1579589502.0,"My bet is Thor kidnaps him and Odin will torture him to the point where hes so angry and full of vengeance he will unleash Ragnarok with the remaining (or returning) Giants.

God of War 2 will probably be about Kratos having to find Atreus and become strong enough/succumb to his anger to defeat Thor, only to find out hes too late."
movies,ff595km,t1_ff57kg9,1579583976.0,He said actually acting was a good outlet for him and it really helped him vent when he got back into civilian life. I think he even has an organization that sets up little sketches and plays that military personnel act in as a form of self expression which isnt exactly a luxury in the military.

funny,ff4ucds,t1_ff4tfxi,1579572643.0,"Pretty much all of media portrays drinking as a fine thing to do, but only in moderation. Those who take it too far are usually considered either bad people, lacking in self control, or deeply troubled.

But forgive me, I dont think you really look deep into any statements on society given it's kind of obvious you dont get out often."

fakehistoryporn,ff47mvr,t1_ff3se5r,1579557310.0,"All land was conquered at some point. Plenty of land in the US was ""bought"" dispite it already belonging to other people.

creepy,ff2x9vg,t1_ff2wyjc,1579527542.0,"Well because his father was about to die and he was going to have to...take care of them.

creepy,ff2wsuf,t1_ff1oope,1579527081.0,The Honored Ancestors ending isnt quite like that. She became so traumatized by what she saw in the room her mind basically shattered.

Either they starved off after running out of thralls or fundamental changes in the Warp caused them to die off."

Pretty much all the problems you're trying to counter will also occur thousands of years after the Emperor was interred on the Throne and no longer has much say in what goes on. The shit going on in the Imperium today was never in the vision of the Emperor or his loyal sons."
