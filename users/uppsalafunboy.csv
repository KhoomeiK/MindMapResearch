bipolar,fdmyxeg,t3_em44y3,1578571848.0,"I know just how you feel, my little Moo dog has gotten me through the hardest times, when I was tapering off of Klonopin, his forever love and those dog walks kept me from killing myself. Now I'm tapering off of trileptal, thankfully he's still here for me. Tonight at the Largo theater in Los Angeles, I just saw the comedian Gary Gilman. Gulman has really struggled with depression and thought of suicide, his show the Great Depresh is on HBO. At the meet & greet after the show, I thanked him for not giving up and for giving me hope to go on and not give up, he gave me a really big hug which was such a heart warming surprise. while leaving I said I knew i Just needed to get my brain chemicals right & he said ""yes! It's not your fault! :) Before I left I Just wanted to thank you for being there for your pets. I started microdosing with marijuana again and looked at taking 400mg of SAM-e instead of 200 (I had been skipping my doses). Although my sleeping hours are bad (4am-130pm) I'm not super depressed like I was, the holidays get me down and it feels like a big weight has lifted. I'm sorry for sharing so much, just wanted to let you know that I care and I hope you feel better soon. Feeling better seems like a state of mind which will never return to us when we feel so low. thank you for being there for them so they can be there for you. Hope your new year improves soon. Wishing you all the best!! (Sorry for writing a lot)"

I took my sister there for tea in the bar area for her birthday and Lionel Ritchie was there going to the restaurant Scarpa. It was magical!
I could hear the song ""all night long"" in my head, I wish I had said hi. The restaurant host said he's the nicest guy and they were chatting really friendly before Ritchie and his lady went inside."
