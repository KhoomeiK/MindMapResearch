Calgary,fdo2ksb,t1_fdny18y,1578597728.0,"I’m dumbfounded! Thanks for sharing you/your daughters experience at the school, I can happily, in good conscience recommend WPS to my elementary students. If it was still the same place it was when I was there I would’ve said to stay away, but it seems like an awesome school now. :)"
Calgary,fdmomsl,t1_fdmal81,1578558255.0,"Wow I’m really envious of your daughters experience! The humanities classes were great for at WPS there’s no doubt, though social didn’t go much beyond current events (in my classes) . My main beef I found is with the STEM classes/options- and the complete lack testing and science related field trips at the time (other than the bow river rafting trip). Dr.Robertson essentially “banned” dissections, strangely. 
In math, I could get away with not participating in class as long as I volunteered to “tidy the classroom” which I milked for as long I could- I still got 4s in my class every year, somehow.

But I’m honestly relieved to hear that the school has really stepped up its game, and I wish I was there when these changes were made. It’s a great school, it just forces students to work a lot harder and more independently I found in the math/science departments once in high school (to catch up on the grade 8&9 level things we should have known). 

But again, It’s great to hear they’ve changed a lot over the years :)"
Calgary,fdm2w7r,t1_fdlkm6p,1578538516.0,"This is really interesting! Thanks for responding. It has been a number of years since I attended the school, I was there between 2012-2016. Im happy to hear there are unit tests now for each unit! That is a huge change from when I was there, or maybe it was because of the teachers I had?

Some of it could have to do with the arson that happened within that time, in addition to the assistant principle changing. But I wonder if the administration has to do with the extremely varying experiences at the school as well? All said and done I’m pretty happy about the inclusion of tests now because the “no tests” rule was extremely backward in my opinion- thanks for sharing!"
Calgary,fdm20gj,t1_fdllctm,1578537919.0,"Really interesting. That’s extreme malpractice for sure, I’m not aware if WPS did anything similar but we were pushed to prep for the PATs when they came around, despite not doing anything of the sort all year. I’m surprised that more parents haven’t come out to speak on these things- there must not be enough backlash to bring this issue into light..."

Calgary,fdla81c,t1_fdl3l1e,1578519734.0,Me and all my friends got As/4s by volunteering to do interpretive dances as our project “medium” every time. High school really sat us on our asses lol
Calgary,fdl9wfk,t1_fdl2ar3,1578519544.0,"I think the willow park method of teaching was alright but it was solely based on creativity and not actual smarts. We were not tested on anything, im serious. We were rewarded highly for “being creative” and we weren’t required have to have any knowledge on anything to pass. Dancers and drama kids thrived there.

Here’s a real example: A kid who made JUST a windmill in Minecraft for a renwable energy research project got a higher mark than me even though I had a PowerPoint presentation. When I confronted the teacher as to why I didn’t perform well despite it being a research project she lowered my grade for complaining and I’ll never forget that. I don’t think Willow park did any monitoring on grades or progress- they made us believe that as long as what you’re doing is creative you’ll get a good grade which is very very not the case in high school. 

I would also be highly interested in knowing how many willow park kids were successful after high school lol."
Calgary,fdl79af,t1_fdkw9kc,1578518237.0,That definitely rings true to my experience as well. Interpretive dances were acceptable presentations for any subject. I remember writing one test in the entire time I was there and the class did so terribly we were all exempt from it. I just don’t know how these schools aren’t investigated for their poor PAT performances?

japan,fdggoem,t3_el6n1p,1578395978.0,"My family is Japanese, hanakotoba would roughly translate into English as “flower words”. To send a message through the flower, each flower has its own meaning. It’s like combining a bouquet of multiple flowers (meanings) to send someone you love or care about a message. It would be considered an art because you would have to be knowledgeable in the kinds of flowers you have and articulate your message through the flowers :) hope it helps. 

Japanese are extremely detailed, the previous person who said you were overthinking is wrong. We really are that meticulous of a culture"
