Then the conclusion about not actually retiring. Although it was clear that you‚Äôre really not is odd to me.

Take a stand. Crying about other people‚Äôs children is great and all. What happens when either parents lose their children or vice versa.
Their world is shook and one is left wondering what could have been done differently. Gear down. Relax. Watch AMD and Intel from the sidelines as the rest of us peasants. We choose not to go to the moon. Period. Nothing up there but cheese. And it stinks.

Does a murderer stop thinking about murdering. Or a fish stop thinking about swimming. No. Okay, silly references. That gives the impression that you should continue teching - which you could or begin playing tournaments in badminton and become a world champion one day. I‚Äôll reach out to Peter Gade for you."

Brits are the shits. 

Great music on the stereo /s .. appears to be one of the newer generation that is unaware that all new music is produced by people with Down's - except the music I like.

I have nothing against british people but would like to see them take more action in accepting that they are being overrun by thugs like Sweden is."

Aalborg,fe8bpm1,t3_eo31lu,1578924584.0,"Der er ogs√• nogle stykker herovre i 9400 som er Aalborg Nord og l√¶ngere nord p√•. F.eks er der en R√∏de Kors og Bl√• Kors p√• Torvet i N√∏rresundby.

Yderligere er der en Genbrugs butik i Skr√•gade i g√•rden bag ved Fakta og t√¶t p√• biblioteket. Modsat B√∏ger&Papir.

Der er noget forskelligt ogs√• t√∏j - men lamper?! - Det tror jeg faktisk at der er en del af i netop den i Skr√•gade.

Jeg kan tage nogle f√• billeder derfra i l√∏bet af dagen i morgen skulle det ha' interesse?! Sidst jeg var derinde var der t√¶pper og t√∏j - herre og dame. Og sko.

Gandrup har s√• vidt vides stadig en genbrugsbutik uden kendskab til hvilken gren de h√∏rer under.

Jeg afleverede selv en hulens masse herre t√∏j i Bl√• Kors p√• Torvet i N√∏rresundby for en uge tilbage godt og vel. Large og XL t-shirts som nok var krympet til en Large med tiden. Og herreskjorter ogs√•.

En bus 17 tager dig til direkte til Torvet i 9400 hvis du k√∏rer den rigtige vej p√• - du skulle n√∏digt ende ude p√• Saltumvej. En bus 12(alle varianter) og 13 g√∏r ogs√• - her g√¶lder de samme regler. Disse stopper dog ikke direkte p√• Torvet men der er ikke langt.

Bus 1 k√∏rer n√¶sten direkte ind og holder ved Fakta og Super Brugsen i N√∏rresundby. Der er ej heller s√¶rligt langt til nogle af butikkerne n√¶vnt. Centrum af N√∏rresundby er slet ikke s√• stort heller.

Pr√∏v ogs√•, at g√• ind i g√•gaden herovre i N√∏rresundby og kig i Handelshj√∏rnet og butikken lige over for. Der er lamper og andre sjove sager. Dog nok ikke til genbrugspris men ej heller noget der g√∏r nas."

I believe I have labelled it all correctly version wise.

There aren‚Äôt that many themes for High Sierra that has the appearance of older themes like those for Tiger. Some on MacRumors but it really has died off a little. Making your own for High Sierra can be done with ThemeEngine

Aalborg,fdk3est,t3_ek8a95,1578495097.0,"Disclaimer: Some things mentioned might not be fully useful but that's just what I felt like writing.

I wish you a good stay here in Aalborg. I must say that I recognise the hardship in making friends - despite the duration of the exchange. 6 months or 60 years(some exchange, huh)

Try being 41 and having to do that which you're about to. I'm an actual dane and I can't even get with anyone new.

I wouldn't last a day in Korea.

I would like to tell you that I think that there's a fascination of East-Asians - Koreans, Japanese and such. 

I for one am one of them. I love the mystique surrounding this region. If that's not in your interest to leverage on that just a little then that's okay. Not that you have to go all - abracadabra on us northerners. Example;  I've cleared all your winter paleness with some swirling arm and leg motion.

Giving advice to anyone from outside our country is as hard for me to give advice to anyone coming over from Copenhagen on what to do and see here and how to be. In general my advice to those from Copenhagen would to be a little less arm and leg swirling motion and be a little more introvert. \*Shakes fist\* \*calm down\*

And also to lessen that terrible dialect, haha.  

Danes(or an Aalborg-genser) being hard as a coconut - tough to crack and then sweet on the inside is, IMO, a bad example. Cocounut flesh and juice is bad for you in large quantities.

I'm selling my dane-ness very poorly.... but if you march in, on your first day of your studies, with full Korean national outfit on. Nobody will mess with you and you'll get acceptance right away. ""Bold move, what a brave woman. I need to get to know her ASAP"" High-pitched female voice:  ""Heeyyyyyyy, wanna sit here with us?"" :D

There's no wrong way as such to approach a Dane. Here there's a saying ""There aren't any stupid questions, only stupid answers/responses""

If you approach whomever you want to engage with then there's only try. Ackward at first but perhaps rewarding in the long run.

Geez, I should apply all these things to my own situation. \*facepalm\*"

todayilearned,fdg73ax,t1_fdg4uqu,1578382715.0,"Absolutely. I liked that movie too. I'll look for his Netflix special. 
I have my favorites though and I don't know if new comics can get a laugh out of me like Dave Chappelle, Tom Segura, Anthony Jeselnik, Bill Burr and dare I say Louis C.K. That mullet-man Theo Von (what?) doesn't do anything.
Female comics I don't see as being a thing ever. Ali Wong is perhaps the only one that's bold enough and on par with the male comics. I can't believe anything Tig Notaro says (she can't be that out of touch with current living popular media figures - she's part of this herself so she must be a complete shut-in if she has a show where she has amnesia constantly)

The classic comedians like, David Space and Adam Sandler has their place too. These just doesn't experience as much anymore and this shows in their act. I like their view on things more than anything - because it's often out on a tangent which I can very much relate to."
