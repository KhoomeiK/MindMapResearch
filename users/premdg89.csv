Meditation,fen838k,t3_eq1hm3,1579279031.0,"What ever was the monks goal, or desire, maybe even his sadhana hadn't given him the result that he seemed.  It instead created doubt, worry and anxiety. Often times when we have a dream or desire or goal we go off seeking its fulfillment.  But the answer lies within.  Good is our own consciousness and thoughts have the ability to create.  We meditate to still the questioning rational logical mind.  So that we can guide and control our thoughts.  An example is > how will it happen, when will it happen?  To > I have faith that it will happen, and at the right time.  I an that which I want to be.  

So this monk has this doubt and has questions.  Ktishnamurti shows him that his fluster and struggle (in essence a suffering because it keeps you anxious) is a result of him thinking that it will not work out. But it is him thinking this with an uncontrolled mind.   Ther new room that they ate saying is symbolic of him changing to new thoughts.  Thinking from a perspective that all is well.  Hope this helps the understanding to go in a positive direction."
djimavicmini,fen5qtn,t3_eq1tdj,1579277573.0,Awesome!!!! Such a perfect shot of that temple and trishul.  Om Har Har Mahadev! üôèüèΩ  can't wait to get my mavic mini!!

nevillegoddardsp,feaenb0,t1_fea9thq,1578947774.0,"Definitely.  I feel the same way too honestly. I was in a relationship but it didnt serve me and unfortunately neither did my partner.  It was hard letting it go at first especially when I had so many y goals with my sp, but I realized that I wanted to live my life a certain way with or without my sp.  After moving forward, I had awesome experiences and I still do but I know that it'll fall into place.  I never stress it now,  but I see many of my friends stressing it.  The ones who enjoy their relationship are at ease with their life.   You'll get the sp you want and deserve.  You won't have to feel forced to accept them or change them, and they'll keep themselves for you."
nevillegoddardsp,fe9y4gw,t3_eo6ohs,1578942493.0,"You care more about your sp then you. Like u said if u stop talking itll hurt ur sp.  Nobody here in your 4p story really cares about how u feel.  Until you atleast learn to put yourself first, it wont change.  The concept of NG is that YOU are God.  How, read his stuff and find out.  But if you're God, why would you put a sp before yourself.  I may sound harsh, but if you're not in this and having fun, cut them all out and get better ppl.  Put yourself first, including your feelings.  You could create a life with good wealth, health and freedom and a fulfilling monogamous relationship rather then feel hurt over nonsensical ppl that dont prioritize you.  Good luck."

NevilleGoddard,fdm8668,t3_em25yt,1578542187.0,"Its interesting in many of Nevilles later lecture he talks about kundalini from his perceptions aswell. So idk this post.  The talk of his in ny, called the blue flame on the forehead he is talking about it there and in subsequent talks aswell. Discussing how Abdullah his mystic teacher is one who initiated him, along with all these teachings like slamming the door.  Either way Neville is great."

It's not about zodiacs, but rather self worth.  These are just words from a random stranger in reddit, but I'd say this to anyone.  I got no commenta for the tattoo thing, bit to each their own."
