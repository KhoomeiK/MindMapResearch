>	Critics

>Critics of mandatory detention, including human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, and church groups, have argued that the policy is discriminatory in its application. People who enter as tourists or visitors and overstay their visas and lodge refugee claims are issued bridging visas, enabling them to remain at liberty while their claims are assessed, whereas boat people are detained throughout the process. They argue that the harshness of detention compounds the distress suffered by already traumatised and desperate people, making their eventual integration into the community more difficult.

>Coalitions of refugee support and church and community groups have formed to lobby against the detention of asylum seekers.(15) They argue that the harshness of Australia's treatment of boat people is destroying our reputation overseas as a welcoming, tolerant and 'civilised' country.(16) As indicated, some claim that detention contravenes Australia's international treaty obligations, including those relating to the rights of children. According to former Human Rights Commissioner Chris Sidoti:

>The (Australian Human Rights) Commission has repeatedly advised the government that its policy of mandatory detention violates voluntarily accepted international obligations. It is disproportionate and inhumane. When it is prolonged it is a gross abuse of human rights.(17)

>Some have even described Australia's detention policy as a reversion to our earlier White Australia policy mentality, as indicative of the nation's deep-seated racism and 'fear of the other', and as appealing to prejudice and fostering xenophobia in the broader community.
