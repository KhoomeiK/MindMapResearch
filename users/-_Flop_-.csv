We dont care how you spend your money.  Spend it on blow and hookers for all we care.

The problem is these predatory loot box mechanics prey on kids and promote gambling.  Studies have been shown that kids who play games with these aggressive loot box offerings exhibit the same tendencies that gambling addicts do.

In addition, when publishers see how much money these generate, they feel obligated to include them in their games.  What ends up happening is we, the consumer, get shipped a product with features locked behind a gambling paywall.  These same features used to be included in the base game.

So now that we, the consumer, have proven that we will allow loot boxes to remain in games due to our purchasing habits, newer games will continue to push the envelope and monetize everything they can.

Before you know it, we are buying full priced games with less and less base content every year.

That's why we care."

jobs,ffa122g,t3_esgv6a,1579725737.0,"You're on the right track with creating various resumes that you can send out to different employers.  It's a tedious process to constantly tweak your resume every time you apply.

Are you tracking who and what you've been applying for?  If not, start doing that.  Create a spreadsheet with date, time, company name, site you applied on, what resume you used, what time of day you applied and whether or not you got a response.  This might help break up the monotony of the process and could give you valuable insight for the future.  It will also help prevent you from applying to the same place and wasting time.

Make sure you set time aside to do things for yourself.  People often say that looking for a job should be a full time job, as in you spend hours every day doing nothing but scouring job boards for new listings.  I disagree with this as it will quickly cause burnout.

Instead, I'd advise allotting small blocks of time for searching and applying.  No more than an hour at a time.  This allows you to reboot and take a break from the tedious and draining process of applying for jobs."

One, how much did you smoke and how often.  People who use regularly (daily) will possibly have detectable amounts in urine tests for about a month after their last use.

Two, your body composition comes into play.  Fatter people will have a harder time ridding their body of THC as opposed to lean people, as it's fat-soluble and therefore can stay in the body longer if you have more fat to store it.

Lastly, the type of test matters.  Saliva test, you're fine.  Urine test, you're probably fine as well.  Not many places will do a hair sample test, so I wouldn't worry about that.

It's none of your business.

If you feel you deserve more, you can ask for more, but be ready to justify why.  ""Working more hours than the job posting listed"" is not a valid reason.

However, if you're going above and beyond and believe you deserve more, you should ask for more."

There are a plethora of jobs that require very little experience and don't require more than a CPR certification or basic coursework.

Patient transport is one.  The pay is about $15/hr and it's a low stress job.  Many hospitals will bring on temp or part-time help in departments like this.

If it's not beneath you, EVS (janitorial) at a hospital is another with about the same base pay."

For the record, I never ask, because it doesn't matter to me.  If I'm interviewing someone, I know what I can pay them, and the only time I ask about salary is if I suspect they may have been lead to believe the pay is much higher or lower than they expect.

I ask what their salary expectations are, rather than what they currently make, because that's actually important.

However, employers will still ask it, regardless of laws in place."

AskReddit,fde6oex,t1_fde1l9l,1578332362.0,"Yeah that's the truth.

I work in a hospital, and if you feel like you have a cold, go ahead and come on in.  Wear a mask and wash your hands.

Most hospital staff don't get the flu very often due to vaccination guidelines, so I don't get the ""I have the 24 hr flu"" call outs often.

Of course, if you're actually sick, and not just a little achy or hungover, stay home."

I get that you're young and want to party on a Friday night.  But to say, ""I refuse to work Friday nights because I want to go out"" is a bit childish.

If you have a legit scheduling conflict, that's one thing.  If you get asked to work a Friday night every now and again, just do it.

Unfortunately, that's how things work when you become an adult and get a job.  You don't always get the schedule you want, and sometimes you have to come in early or stay late.  Sometimes you have to cover for someone or work a day you don't want to."
