BattlefieldV,ff5fcey,t1_ff3j9f5,1579590425.0,"> It was such a drastic change in gameplay in such a short period of time that the community got a little blindsided.

Not really. I remember us playing together and nothing had changed. We were still always on top of the leaderboard. Some ppl were crying about the ttk and trying out weapons and specialisations to check which weapons are viable and many have changed their main weapons since. 

> Personally, a full revert to 5.0 would be a good start, then they would  address the over or underperforming weapons individually so as to not  fundamentally change the whole TTK. I say this because I firmly believe  5.0 was a better staging ground for balance. 

Thats exactly the reason they made these huge changes. To bringe a completely new layer to the game which. Because now they can actually make good changes do individual weapons. Which before was not really that possible.

> Some players believe that devs are at their beck and call and should just drop down and give blowjobs on a whim  , and it's unfortunate that some of the people on this sub believe that.  

haha, fuck you. I am probably one of the older generation who enjoy getting content delivered and are happy about figuring out what the devs have provided us with without making any predetermened judgement. But sadly the majority of ppl, especially those with lower skill levels need wasy more time to figure these things out, which is probably the reason they are always that salty. And need to bitch about everything.

> On the other hand, while I respect DICE for wanting to try something  different, but in a live service game that's meant to last a long time,  they have to acknowledge the community in terms of what they want and  how they feel.  It can't be one-sided, it has to come from both sides.  

why?

99% of the community have no idea what they are talking about! Just because they are not developers. The goals of the developer and the players are not the same.

> A team Balancer would also mean new players don't get absolutely railed, especially when clans mass invade a server ;). 

this coming from someone who instantly switches back into the winning team where his 10-15 teammebers are as soon as he gets auto balanced or he lands on the other side when joining the server ;) ( probably flaming dice in the process )"

BattlefieldV,ff3gih2,t3_er614m,1579540563.0,"> But that's not the  truth, because games like Rainbow Six Siege have slowly gained players,  even with a steep learning curve and brutal TTK. 

You cannot say without actually having access to the data.  Correlation does not imply causation! Especially if your correlation is JUST a feeling.

>A team balancer and better anti-cheat would have fixed these issues or  at least helped, but DICE didn't do that. No, they changed the TTK  again. 

No it would not. Using resources on anti-cheat is a waste of resources. There will always be a way to cheat without detection.

In my opinion the patch seemed to have hit the correct spots where it was intended. OP weapons got nerved and the soso weapons stayed where they were. While the bad ones got more viable. And thats exactly the reason why most of the ppl are complaining.... because their ""beloved"" main weapon got nerved even though it was way too much OP and was way too versitily, beeing able to use it in every situation. The range dmg drop has stopped that and put a skill cap on weapons. Now you again need to choose your battles depending on your equipment, something which has always been unique to battlefield. As a result TTK went up cause ppl needed more bullets on range while having the same on close range. 

Now for player ballance, this has mixed in many of the good and experienced players into a lower skill bracked while the top skilled players ( you know of which players of our platoon I speak ;) ) have a bigger advantage just because they have more time to kill the enemy who now needs more bullets unless you can hit properly (which most ppl aren´t).

This update was well thought through and I think it has reached its goal of balancing out weapons. They are probably able to tell by the percentage of kills a weapon has in the overall combat since the patch. I´d love to see the raw data though to analyze it.

They will not revert the patch as this seemes to be a complete new system which they wouldn´t have brought live otherweise. They seem to have wanted this range specific differences in the weapons. Probably to be able to better tweak the weapons indvidually.

In the end I always find it strange that players who play a game think they are somehow entitled to an opinion that matters or that their casual feeling about what they think about specifics in the game have to be listened by by the developers. Its the game creaters who give us the experience they want us to have. If you don´t like it, p!ss off and play counterstrike or some shit like that. Its for reasons like these fucking debates and all these fucking toxic youtuber that we have lost contact to almost all the game devs as they cannot handle the constant abuse of casual nn´s and kiddies. So they just quit their social media and we lose contact with them. And then we are left with community managers and PR teams and cannot  influence anything any more or get awesome insights. And then you wonder why its always about the money for them...."
