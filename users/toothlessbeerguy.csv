VancouverCraftBeer,feoeav8,t1_fen689q,1579298979.0,"Incorrect. The Lonely Planet article mentions the fact that Penticton has a large number of breweries given its population, but if you read the article, it’s FAR from the only reason why they are calling it Canada’s craft beer capital."
VancouverCraftBeer,fen60ux,t1_fen539y,1579277747.0,"Port Moody didn’t have any breweries 6 years ago, meanwhile craft beer has  been such a huge part of Penticton culture over the past 25 years, and Fest of Ale is a big part of that. It’s a way of life there. That’s what makes it a superior beer town."

VancouverCraftBeer,felzn7x,t3_epuse5,1579235122.0,"Really. Penticton has been ahead of the curve on craft beer for 25 years. Soon to be 7 breweries, Fest of Ale is one of the biggest beer festivals in BC, and the city is a vacation destination in its own right. [Lonely Planet isn’t the only one that’s recognizing this either](https://www.expedia.ca/travelblog/best-beer-towns-canada/)

No other town in BC has that level of beer culture, and certainly not as long as Penticton has."

AmItheAsshole,feb08tx,t3_eo5ugm,1578954122.0,"NTA If my wife had the opportunity to fulfill a lifelong goal and visit Antarctica I would be STOKED for her. And also totally jealous, but still totally happy for her and supportive, obviously. Solo parenting is not that big a deal, I do it literally all the time. If she’s not comfortable being on her own, maybe organize a relative like your grandma or mom to help while you’re gone.

I think you need to stress to your wife that this is a bucket list opportunity or you, and ask her what are some things she would like to do, and work to make those happen. Maybe start with your honeymoon and get the ball rolling on that at least.

But your happiness is important, and it’s unfortunate your wife isn’t supportive of you fulfilling your goals. Her actions seem pretty selfish, which is understandable to a certain extent, but nonetheless disappointing.

If you had won this trip in a contest, do you think she would she feel the same way?"
unpopularopinion,feaqzfo,t1_fe8ae3j,1578951432.0,Same here in Canada. It’s total chaos but damn it’s good to get out of the house and feel like a normal human again. I totally agree that kids under 2 shouldn’t be at regular screenings though.

All I was trying to say was that the consensus of Canadian Iranians may not be representative of the attitudes of Iranians in Iran. But I don’t doubt that the many are afraid to voice their opposition as you say. Given the consequences for doing so, I don’t blame them."
PublicFreakout,fe0cu42,t1_fdz7lps,1578810130.0,"Most of Canada’s Iranian population fled after the fall of the Shah, so they’re obviously not super supportive of the current regime. Many of them don’t even refer to themselves as Iranian, but identify as Persian instead. So I’m not sure if their attitude is necessarily representative of what’s happening back in Iran. But they do have influence."
