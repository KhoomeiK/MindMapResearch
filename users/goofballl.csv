ELATeachers,ff61eve,t3_errvzh,1579616668.0,"/r/TEFL might also have some answers for you. ELA is somewhat related to ESL, but kinda sorta not really. 

You might explain to the parents that any time spent working on English skills is time not spent on math, so they really need to prioritize what they want out of sessions with you. Also that you're not really trained in ESL, although I imagine a lot of parents probably believe that just getting lessons in English is somehow effective. 

Plus people skilled enough to effectively integrate wildly disparate fields like ESL and math are probably charging a lot more than you are for services. And even then they need prep time to properly integrate vocab into lesson material rather than being able to teach concepts for any word on the spot.

They're really asking a lot of you, and if I were in your shoes it wouldn't be worth my time. I'd tell the parents I'm there for math tutoring only. If their English skills are bad enough that they're struggling in math it probably extends to all subjects, so they most likely need a dedicated ESL tutor anyway."

I get why you need the pacing to be slower on console because you can't have the accuracy of mouse and keyboard, but it was frustrating to see all the money going to those shooters for so long.

Teachers,fdsxyjc,t1_fdrkmow,1578709396.0,"> they don't know things they have no need to know in their young world.

I agree with most of what you (and others in this thread are saying), but I think typing is still a useful skill that's fallen off. Do students write papers on smartphones? I honestly don't know. Do they use swype or voice to text, or do lots of them just go at it with 2 thumbs? 

Plus smartphone stuff is still limited compared to computers (iphone even moreso over android). Less storage and worse hardware for the cost, not as many or as good games, etc. I get why people don't take the time to deal with computers these days, but to me it always feels like ""I don't want to learn that skill, so I'll just accept a worse experience."" If literally all you do is social media then of course it doesn't matter, but otherwise it just seems like they're shooting themselves in the foot. Even just focusing on games (which I assume are still important to lots of kids), it's way harder to get cheap (or pirated) games on smartphones. 

It almost feels comparable to ""I don't want to learn to read fluently so I'll just ignore everything books have to offer except for what I absolutely have to struggle through."" You mentioned cars, which I know nothing about (apart from tire changes and such), but I definitely feel like it'd be a useful skill to have every time I shell out cash to have them fixed.
