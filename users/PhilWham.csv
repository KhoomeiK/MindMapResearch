Career,ffawka8,t3_eslcky,1579746153.0,"""Hi,

Do you have a 30 minute opening in your schedule sometime next week? If you have availability I'd love to take you to lunch and learn a little bit more about what you do. 

I have a deep interest in [insert your industry] and  would gain a lot from hearing about your background, experience, and insights.

Let me know if there is a good time that works for you. Thank you!

-Your Name""

People love to be flattered and talk about their successes and insights so request it in a way that taps into that. People are also busy so suggest a time frame and do it over lunch so it's not interrupting their day to day. 

Keep it brief and you can mention your predicament as you introduce yourself in person something like ""I love the industry and company but unfortunately my contract is ending.. I would love to hear about your career path... Keep me in mind if you have any insights for someone in my situation etc."" If he wants to/has power to help you he will offer it. Straight up asking for help or a favor or about other openings may be too straightforward and may come off the wrong way."

Sometimes it really does  take seeing a success story that they can relate to for hope (whether it's similar race, age, background, community, hobby, physical condition, etc). 

Whether it connects with every kid or not can be debated like in your personal example. 

But regardless of perceived intention, I always give kudos to those that are trying to do good. One example is Lebron and his school he built+funds that peeps literally bag on him bc he's ""just doing it for social media"" I don't agree with all he says but it irks me that with so much negativity in the world people still find ways to be unnecessarily skeptical and negative about the intentions of people doing things that help others."

a) the consequences of caretaker malpractice, the scrutiny itself would uncover that her mother is illegal 

b) as a direct link to his death (wrongful injection regardless of who takes blame), the inheritance would be much easier to dispute by the family as opposed to his plan to pin it on suicide alone.

An example of what this means:
In the business school you can apply to 3 programs. Usually students choose their top choice then 1-2  ""easier/general"" ones as back up just in case they don't get in. 

This leads all prospective strategy, acc, finance, HR, etc. students to have entrepreneurship/marketing as backups due to these not having additional specific pre-reqs.

My advice still stands- volunteer supporting events where you are. The more different types of events the better. Also arm yourself with the skills that are ""bonus"" skills for the specific industry, dept, role that you may be interning in.

What type of internship are you looking to apply to if you don't mind me asking?"
