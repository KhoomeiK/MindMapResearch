KindVoice,fdbva1x,t3_ekjlme,1578262509.0,"We all question our decisions at some point. Here's the good news: You're on a path. A lot of people don't even get that far. It's a long path, and it's not going to the same destination as the path others have taken. Maybe you weren't ready to start at the same time as the others. What's important is that you continue until you get to a destination. It might not even be where you thought you would end up. Just please don't stop when you're feeling lost and alone. Keep moving until you get through it and then you can figure out where you are. You can do this."

With the flame lengths you have, there isn't much that boots on the ground can do. Sometimes, it just takes a weather event."

AmItheAsshole,fc5cdw5,t3_egaloc,1577453156.0,"Both of our cats, periodically, vomit after eating. We have switched food, separated their eating areas, and reduced the amount of food we give them to several small servings. Still, periodically, they puke immediately after eating. I bring this up to our vets every time we visit, but, since they are maintaining healthy weight, they have not seemed worried. If you get an answer, please post it or dm me to let me know. Good luck."

(This isn't really what he was talking about, but to me, it means don't judge other people's decisions based on what you THINK you would do in a similar situation. You don't know what you will do until you actually have to live with the consequences of that decision.)"
