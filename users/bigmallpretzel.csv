I think everything she said about it was an excuse, trust me nobody calls their creepy stalker pet names (love, angel, etc) she didn’t even have to be messaging him back in the first place.

sex,fdae78f,t1_fdadvoo,1578245112.0,"thanks for the reply, i’m just asking if it’s just as effective, because i know some people use both the pill AND condom, if i’m in a committed relationship i just wanted to know if there’s no need for both, sorry for any confusion, it does seem like a dumb question at first haha"
sex,fdads9d,t1_fdadcei,1578244942.0,"Yeah there’s definitely multiple benefits of the pill! also apparently it helps acne and lighter periods! if i’m in a committed relationship and we don’t want a condom on we shouldn’t have to have a condom if there’s a pill, thanks for the reply, i also have a question if you don’t mind, how do you clean up after coming inside? i suppose just a shower would work instead of it just dripping out, if this is TMI you don’t have to answer i’m just curious how to react in the future"

Crushes,fd5yp25,t3_ejyrwk,1578183175.0,"it’s really brave that you confessed, also i think it’s better for her to wait rather than go into a new relationship still hung up on an ex, it would be healthier for the both of you long term if she moves on before starting something new! i’m really proud of you, don’t lose all hope yet"
Crushes,fd5y7wq,t3_ek35ej,1578183002.0,"speaking from experience of receiving DMs over instagram, i almost 100% always ignore or block if someone says something to me who is a stranger, you still could have a chance if you be yourself, i know you are shy, but it would help a ton and come off looking better, how often do you talk in person?"
Crushes,fd5xm3m,t3_ek1pfn,1578182784.0,i think some of the best and longest lasting relationships come from starting as best friends
