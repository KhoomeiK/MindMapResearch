offmychest,fewko84,t3_eqjoxa,1579412825.0,"Congratulations!! You will meet your kid in due time; alive, healthy, and well.
Here's to you and your soon to be perfect family and to both you and your wife being amazing parents!!  
Good Luck."
AskReddit,feut9qn,t3_eqfgfg,1579389677.0,I watched marriage story. Not usually a fan of love stories or tragedies. But man was this movie beautiful. Raw and realistic. So amazing!!
AmItheAsshole,fes9pak,t1_fes9988,1579362969.0,I live with my parents. And I have been trying to find a job without any luck. I freelance however but that isn't as rewarding as having a full time job.
AskReddit,fer0a3a,t3_eqacbx,1579348090.0,Someone singing a song incorrectly.
self,feqzz14,t1_feqtgk2,1579347957.0,Thank you. I have missed him and the fact that we used to share what's going on in our lives. I feel very happy. xX
relationships,feoefjy,t3_eq6sj1,1579299056.0,He is an ass and not one person deserves to have this kind of a dick in their lives. Dump him and run.
CasualConversation,femd1rw,t1_fem14vu,1579249288.0,My mom used to empty pen containers of which the ink had dried out and stick the pencils in there.
thisisus,femcyz2,t3_epr1e9,1579249187.0,"I have liked Miguel since the beginning and still don't get why he receives so much hate. All he wants is to be there for her wife and when he said that Randall was being too Randall, I felt that."
offmychest,fejgu7f,t3_eph3e2,1579173607.0,Someone has probably already told you this but you need to get therapy. It must not be affordable in your country (it isn't in mine either) but you can probably work for it if you are asking for advice here. That night mean that you want to be better.
self,fejab9q,t3_ep9t0w,1579163919.0,It does work!!! Sometimes you are at your best when you procrastinate.
GossipGirl,fej6lmz,t3_epcqg6,1579159019.0,"Oh my God yes. This show has privileged asses all around yet the person I hate the most, even more than Chuck, (I am only on season 2) is Jenny. 

She has such supportive family, yet she chooses to be a bitch to her dad."
thisisus,fej03dq,t1_fehz6nc,1579152184.0,I read it somewhere around on the internet. I don't remember it now. Probably on this subreddit.
thisisus,fej025j,t1_fei1fgq,1579152152.0,He totally did!!
thisisus,fehyjzt,t1_fehmub7,1579126460.0,This is true. He just wants to have a story like his parents'. Poor guy.
thisisus,fehygsj,t1_fehoi5b,1579126406.0,"I really hope. Since Dan fogelman said we have already met the fiance.

 Tho I was just watching the scene where Kate Kevin and Madison are shopping for Toby's birthday and it struck me that it could be Madison too. Is she single?? I can't recall."
thisisus,fehew8u,t1_feh4skz,1579115117.0,True. But that's still a shitty move to pull.
thisisus,fegzv7f,t1_fegutxs,1579106192.0,Kate has been acting really weird since this season started and Toby deserves a break from her attitude for real.
relationships,fe76510,t3_enzl7o,1578910585.0,"Noooo. Don't do it. You sound like someone from South Asian background. And tbh sometimes your family drags you down. Stand your ground. Don't let your aunt stay there in any case. If they want you to stay with them so bad, they be the one to pay for what you spent on your new place. 

You are doing the right thing. It maybe okay for your parents to think that you owe them financial support, but  it's not okay for them to think that you don't need your own space and want to be independent. 

You go do what you want. Tell them firmly. And good luck !!"
relationships,fe4uxbp,t3_enp4s5,1578863040.0,Cut this friend out of your life. And I have learned this from experience that you need to tell the person why you are cutting them off. Otherwise it's an endless series of bullshit
offmychest,fdye06k,t1_fdyd7uv,1578778698.0,"Same team. It was a done deal until the fucking CEO interviewed me and offered me an internship instead of the job and acted like he was doing me a favor because it'd be a good ""learning opportunity"""
self,fdyc6b6,t3_enaq4r,1578778219.0,"Heyyy. Kudos to you. I hope life only gets better for you from here. Good luck!!
You worked so hard for this and it paid. Good for you bro."
offmychest,fdyasmo,t1_fduiv1r,1578777811.0,"My school and his school are not like Wharton vs state school. It's like if his is 1st, mine would be like 4th I guess. 

A background: it was a marketing/sales job at a software house. You need to have some basic knowledge about AI to get it. Both of us didn't. Both of us submitted a sales pitch with extensive research. 

Here is the thing tho, he and I had same skill set, no experience, same communication skills but different schools and I guess that's really discriminatory to be rejected just on the basis of my school when I went through the same procedure and surpassed every other candidate."
relationships,fdy982z,t3_ena2pl,1578777339.0,"Sorry but your sister is acting kinda crazy. If she is your best friend, she must know that you love your hair and you shouldn't be subjected by anyone to change it, let alone your sister."
offmychest,fcy2asg,t3_ejdc6m,1578073831.0,"What you went through was horrible and the fact that you are alive and establishing an identity after it is so applaudable. 

I am in awe of you whoever you are. And I wish you well on your journey. And I hope that you are fully able to look past your trauma and accept and love yourself. You aren't dirty. You are strong and powerful.

And I also pray that your abusers rot in hell. Amen."
relationships,fcv3ym5,t1_fcv324i,1577994155.0,"But what if she sees this as invading her space? We have always been able to talk to each other without hesitation. Lately though she doesn't open up much and it's frustrating. It's not like the relationship is abusive but whenever there is a difference of opinion between them, she always gives in. And I want to tell her to stop doing this but I cannot because I don't know the full story."
offmychest,fcv31e5,t3_ej0ww8,1577993609.0,"Literally pure wholesomeness of parents and kids appreciating each other. 
Haven't seen this in a long time. :')"
StockImages,fcksqce,t1_fcirnct,1577732372.0,Oops. Sorry. I didn't know that. I am only 4 days old.   Thanks for letting me know.

sales,fc7l21p,t1_fc6vr5m,1577510888.0,"I have tried this and I feel like this is the way to go but my storywriting skills are really bland. Do I need to introduce more characters? It's only a 7 slides presentation, I don't have to write a report with it so I have constraints with that as well."
