InsanePeopleQuora,ff33oey,t1_ff31qwm,1579532867.0,"I worked in a shopping mall and I can guarantee you that most ARE indeed like this. 

I have heard all stupid questions,  I have seen people smoking in no smoking areas where kids play not understanding what is wrong. 

I have seen many many people wearing their umbrellas in a I door mall not realizing they are i side. I've seen tons of people push doors that say pull. 

I have seen fights breaking out by the hundreds in the 7 years I worked there for the absolute stupidest reasons. 

I've seen people starting to sing opera that think they are funny but they are not. They are annoying to everybody in the mall besides the people who see it for the first time. And when they get removed by security, security gets yelled at because the women was only singing. But those people don't realise we had these people every, single, day. 

Not to start on the amount of 7 year old children that get kicked out of the house because mommy has to fuck her new boyfriend and so they get ‚Ç¨2 and hang around in the mall the entire day 7 days a week. It's not a few. I know at least 20 of those children.  

There are entire families that wait till the doors unlock to spend their entire days in a shopping mall. With their babies. Not one or two. Its 10/15 families each day neglecting their children. Laughing and yelling until they have to pick up their kids from school for lunch and they put their quarters together to buy a wonder bread and a pot of chocolate paste. The laughter is gone when their children  eat in silence with a already numbed out face staring in front of them like they already know this is going to be their life. Meanwhile the parents sit on their newest I phones dressed I  all brands while their kids have broken shoes.

Parents who go I  stores and tell 3 year old  kids to wait outside. Then come out 40 minutes later panicking because they lost the kid. 8 kids a day on average......that's how many calls security got for lost kids every single day. 

I wish It was like how you say. But it's not. 

2 out of 10  people probably have a brain. Which isn't that crazy I mean smart people are just more rare statistically.

xboxone,ff320qv,t3_erdbie,1579531600.0,"A have never ever had a playstation just because I hate the controllers and sony's way of marketing overall. 

This is the first time I am doubting because I am a cod player and a hypocrite,  which means I do hate Sony's marketing but it's just more profitable to play cod on a playstation with all the exclusives. 

Microsoft is just a bit arrogant at this point in saying we don't need this and we don't need that. Like exclusives wedont need that, vr? We don't need that. 

But I like vr and most of all the vr is what makes me think switching to playstation  next year. I want vr. 

I was doubtful because of the controller but the Hori is a pretty good replacement to be honest. 

In my country I can only use my xbox for playing games and all the extra features like watching tv (besides netflix) I can't use anyway. And even if I could I buy a console for gaming and nothing else. 

At this point the only reason I am doubting is that the controller is not the exact same even if I choose the HORI. And also because I have the turtle beach 800 elite  which has cost me ‚Ç¨300 and is only for xbox. There is another version for playstation. 

I know there is a way to connect controller to ps but it doesn't work great  

So all I need is a way to use the same headset on ps and some practice with the Hori controller and I am gone."

In¬†Ancient Egypt, large forks were used as cooking utensils.[2]
In the¬†Roman Empire,¬†bronze¬†and silver forks were used, many surviving examples of which are displayed in museums around Europe.[3][4]¬†Use varied according to local customs, social class, and the type of food, but in earlier periods forks were mostly used as cooking and serving utensils.

No you just tell him it's a fork. Later when he is older about right after hitting age 1. 

I should have used the word baby instead of toddlers which is my mistake yes.

But the point still stands. Because the ""baby"" will develope a brain. The flatearther already has a developed brain. Explaining to him why earth isn't flat..........just read that sentence dude. You just don't explain why earth is flat.

If a adult person comes up to you draws a circle and tells you it's a square you don't explain why it's not a circle. Tou get out the euthanizing equipment and end it, or you just walk away.

Might be a knock off.

I have no read about 5 different sentences  read that are all said by larry. They all are slightly different but most I read only describe dressing up balloo as a girl. Not about the coconut bra. So that is enough for me to discard. 

However I did find video images of baloo dancing with the ape in euro Disney park paris. And indeed he has a coconut bra. So that's weird. 

But could also he the reason for people remembering it like this. Personally I remember the bra. I've seen the movie about 50 times since I have 2 little daughters  thing is I only remember the bra the first time seeing it years ago when I was little. So sure when I watch the movie 20plus years later I can have a false memories about it. 

And many people having the same memory might just be that there in fact are Disney movies where they use nature stuff as bra. For example Ariel's shells. Also we link Hawaiian skirts with coconut bra's for ages and it's not hard to see a Hawaiian skirt and think of a coconut bra.

Like when I say video recorder, we all think about VHS tapes.

It might be far fetched but not as far fetched as having different dimensions and that we noticed that by trivial things. There is actually one single mandela effect that is not trivial and that is the mandela death itself. Only the mandela death is already linked to another person that indeed died earlier and could he confused with mandela and also was on the news.

Now the second cop also grabs his gun and points it at the guy who is already in pain on the ground. Now the third cop comes along and thinks....""let me grab my gun and also point it at the guy on the ground"". But that's not it. The fourth fucking cop also does the same lmfao. 

Now I don't disapprove this but are these people trained? Not on single cop checks the environment to see if maybe, just maybe there is a chance that this person is not alone lol lol. They almost are hypnotized and need to obey their urge to get the guns out when a person is on the ground. 

It's almost a sketch."

I also was very afraid because their was an accident in that time with a sheep that was thrown overboard after slaughtering it and it floated to the shore followed by sharks. 3 people were injured. It turned out that happened about a year before 2013, could be 2 years in the time you went there. 

Horrible experience overall. I had 2 guards in the hotel with guns and if it was busy they switched to ak74's.

Whatcouldgowrong,fes57ul,t3_eqgfbo,1579361507.0,"Is this like a vacation tour? I don't trust those.

I once went snorkeling with a tour in Egypt. 

So me and the group swam and my wife who is a race swimmer(?) I don't know how you call it she did swimming competitions. Anyway she raced with the tour guide who didn't believe she would beat him. She did but by the time she did they were in the distance and half of the tour people were drowning around me lol. They clamped to that life circle thing the tour guide tossed in the water and thatis when I asked myself:

How professional is this guy. 

He left all of us for a race and we just looked into a big giant black ocean when going underwater. I only could think of sharks and the only person with experience is fucking miles away. 

When he came back he decided that my wife took half of the people and he took the other half. I thi k he realised everybody already was tired as fuck and ready to just let go of life and sink to the bottom. I remember the feeling and with the sharks in my mind and how I felt I was already dead inside my head. I learned it is very hard to swim in the ocean. Not compared to a swimming pool. 

Then we saw 3fishes the tour guide pointed out. All what he called ""lovefishes"". It were those moonfishfucks with points that paralyze your entire body when you touch them. I saw that I  a CSI episode some days earlier. It didn't comforted me at all. 

Then the guide on the boat with a binoculars waved and whistled to the guide in the water and started yelling Arabic.

Tpurgyid in the water now laughing nervous and telling us to swim back very fast to the boat. I was like fuck its sharks. Binocular guy saw a shark. 
And that waterguide was swimming way ahead leaving us all behind and yelling come on people hurry up, still smiling nervously.  But we couldn't. We were tired as hell. So my wife tells us to hold the life thing and she grabbed the rope. She swam us to the boat. One senior citizen was in total panic and I asked the guide what the fuck that shit was about. 

And he just responded like ""nothing what do you mean the tour is over"". Like we were the idiots.

After the lady stopped panicking he asked how we liked it and had the nerve to pass a long a tipping jar lol. 

So when we got back to the resort and I immediately called the travel guide and he came visit me. I explained the situation and he told me this:

Due to economics the bums you should never go on tour with are now allowed to enter the resorts. This is since yesterday so now we have a list of people you can go on tours with and your guys are not on it. 

I stayed on the resort for the rest of the vacation. No more tours. To this day I believe I almost got eaten by a shark in Egypt.

Anyway even If this post is not a tour it made me think of this story and I thought id share."

Unexpected,fes027n,t1_fery77m,1579360095.0,"I think the responses are a bit the same. 

They did some tests in a program I saw recently to see how people reacting a fire. And we are fucking morons. 

They had a classroom with people and have them fill in some bogus form. 
People didn't respond as long as nobody responded even when the smoke already was blown from under the door. They just looked at each other and back down to their forms. 

There was one actor and he had instructions on how to act. After a while the room was filled with smoke and one woman finally stood up and said: ""this is not normal right?"". And the actor just sad ""it's nothing gi back to your place"". 

And the women went fucking back to here seat filling in the form with the room full of smoke.

So at least one of these people should have reacted not this panicky imo. 

(I have no source it was a program on tv so please don't ask.)"

I think he needs a suit with his real head hidden and the fake one on top of it like it's his head. He them needs to look around for minutes like nothing is wrong. Or be a statue. Only after a couple of minutes he should briefly remove his head in this way and float it around as a surprise act. I think then it would work like a charm.
