If any substantive evidence is actually submitted to suggest that the president actually abused his power, my mind will most likely change."
Conservative,fei4c1d,t3_ep72a5,1579129993.0,"Some people are here saying that this is not a fair comparison. I can agree with that. a debate is not meant to have thousands and thousands of people there.

 What is accurate is the town halls that some of these candidates hold. They are in venues that can hold a few thousand people, and they have 150 people show up. Meanwhile president trump holds a rally in a football stadium and there are 5000 people waiting outside because it is already at capacity. That would have been a more accurate representation."

facepalm,fegpr9e,t3_ep0tk4,1579099634.0,Even if you only look at climate change predictions they have been wrong for the past 30 years. In the 1980s they thought the world would end by 1995. In the 90s they predicted the ice caps would be melted by 2000. In 2000 they thought the average temperature increase on Earth would be 5ﾟCelsius. And it keeps going. And they expect us to freak out at each prediction.

Warren bypasses Congress = altruism

Hurray for double standards."
