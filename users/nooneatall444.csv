You could just say 'no attacking each other before x era' as well. It just helps to have some rules along those lines because a civ game takes a long time and if someone gets knocked out on turn 30 they get excluded from the fun for a few days. One thing I would note is that civ games are less fun with only 3 players because ultimately someone gets ganged up on- if you do paly with 3 players either have AIs or play on pangaea, because otherwise someone gets a contintent to themselves and it's both boring and a free win"
