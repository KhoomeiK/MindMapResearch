YouShouldKnow,fdzqoxz,t3_en8r0a,1578793594.0,"Is there anything the Discount Tire *does* charge money for? I have bought new wheels (rims with tires on them already) twice in the past 5 years and I bring them to DT to have them swapped out on my car and they never charge me for it. I also use their drive-up tire pressure check thingy where they fill up your tires for free if they're low. Like, what do they charge for?"

mildlypenis,fcrexcz,t1_fcrdxzg,1577900916.0,"The title doesn't imply anything. I assumed the potato quality was from her screenshotting an already poor quality image on her iPhone from the stone age rather than just saving it, which is a mom thing to do. I kinda thought anyone familiar with the internet and/or moms would have gotten that, but you're the only person who seems to be tripped up about this. 

I can't imagine what it must be like to think you're a hot shit super sleuth for calling out a screen shot with like 4 upvotes on a dick pic sub. 

Happy new year."

Interview: ""Thanks for your reply! I love your work! What's your hourly rate?""

I don't go to the Maserati dealership with Kia money and pretend I managed not to see the price tags 3 times, why do clients act like this?"

cats,fc37pig,t1_fc2f2l6,1577383470.0,"That kind of reminds me of another volunteer at my shelter who does fospice; ""foster+hospice"", where they take home cats who are on their deathbeds so that they can die comfortably in a dignified manner in a warm home instead of in a shelter. It seems her heart for those cats is greater than the pain of constantly watching them die. Plenty of people ask me how I can be ""strong"" enough to volunteer, but what she does is the Ironman of cat care."
cats,fc37du8,t1_fc23cts,1577383244.0,"Almost all shelters will accept volunteers! Check out the websites of your local shelters and see if they have a volunteer program. Signing up to foster can make a huge difference as well, if you have the right setup for it."

cats,fc36t1o,t1_fc2n8hk,1577382843.0,You'd be surprised how quickly you adapt! Knowing that you are making a difference in hundreds of lives every month begins to overtake the need to bring one home.
cats,fc36jf1,t1_fc1xh13,1577382660.0,"Six years ago I lost my 8 year old best friend because I was not educated enough in cat/pet care and he had an undiagnosed illness that eventually pulled him quite suddenly from his life long before his time, and long before I was ready to let him go. Even after all this time, the pain of his death still haunts me, even to tears at times. I know there is no way I could ever go through that pain again so I never adopted another cat, but I don't want my fear of loss to be the reason I don't bring some form of comfort and security to the lives of other cats. So my solution was to volunteer at the local shelter. It's a form of penance/redemption for being the cause of my cat's untimely death, and a promise to do better for all the other cats who cross my path from here on out."
