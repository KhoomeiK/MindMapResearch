selfimprovement,fe9exd0,t3_eo05yr,1578937013.0,"Try scheduling something for yourself immediately after work. If I go home first, it's over. I stay at home doing nothing. But if I go straight to the gym after work, I feel a million times better."

selfimprovement,fe8xt3i,t1_fe6ipxr,1578932158.0,"I started taking French my sophomore year of high school, I think I was 14ish. Took that for three years, then took two years in community college. Was planning on being a French and English teacher. Then I transferred to a university and read Gulliver’s Travels the summer before I moved. Decided I wanted to learn more languages so I could have adventures like Gulliver, so I signed up for Spanish and Arabic. My second semester I studied abroad in France for 6 months. I had studied French for 5 years at this point, so the study abroad really took me to the next level as I had a solid foundation in grammar and linguistics. When I returned to home, I continued taking all three languages simultaneously for four years. At the end of my university, I studied abroad in Egypt for six weeks. It was incredible. Definitely had adventures like Gulliver had, except without the giants and the tiny civilisations. I was very invested and self-motivated so I studied A LOT, but it was very helpful to have the formal instruction so I could learn the rules of the languages and get real-time feedback. Language classes are held every day, unlike other disciplines where you go twice a week. I now run a Middle Eastern restaurant where I use all my languages from time to time with guests and employees. As part of my employment, I get to take a trip abroad each year to get new recipe ideas. Last year I went to Morocco and it was fabulous! I was supposed to go to Turkey this year, but I got injured and have to recover from surgery.

My study advice: 
- Study for 30-60 minutes at least every day. Take one or two days off each week to let your brain rest.
- Create a specific environment when you study. Learning French? Put on French music or talk radio in the background, have a certain smell available that connects you to the language (coffee, sweets, a candle or incense,etc). This helps trigger your memory.
- Since I was learning multiple languages, I color coded my folders, notebooks and highlighters. Everything Arabic was purple, French was orange, and Spanish was green. Helped my brain switch gears.
- Find a way to ask questions to native speakers. Face to face is even better.
- I'm a hands-on learner, so I recommend writing everything down by hand. Typing is faster, but hand writing really cements it in your brain. You think about it more, and you always learn better from experience. Autocorrect, even in the target language, will handicap you by making you rely on it. Only rely on your brain. Write vocab words repeatedly. Use them in full sentences that you write down. Have an instructor check your work, then rewrite your mistakes as full sentences.

That's all I can think of for now, but I'm happy to answer other questions! Bonne chance!"

AskWomen,fe32z71,t3_encl38,1578845420.0,"I go to nice restaurants alone and sit at the bar. Most times I end up chatting with the bartender or other people sitting at the bar. I bring a book just in case there's no one to talk to. Being out among people is nice, even if I'm not with anyone. Plus I love trying new food and drinks.

I also love cooking and organizing my house. I listen to podcasts which makes me feel connected to the world."
UnsentLetters,fdxsdgd,t3_en8pl4,1578772447.0,"God I hate judgy people at the gym!!! You're right- it's already hard for a woman to be there, period. If it's not looks and unsolicited advice from men, it's snarky people like this. They're in that stage of internalized misogyny where girls are the enemy. I hope they grow out of it and see that there's a better way to live. Us ladies should stick together, not tear each other down!

I'm proud of you for weight lifting- it's so badass!! I have to start lifting later this year once I recover from my shoulder surgery. Do you have any tips? I need motivation when it gets hard, and a way to keep it fun."

 Three months ago I severely dislocated my right shoulder, which messed up my neck and upper back. I'm doing physical therapy and will have surgery this month. This is the exercise my physical therapists have me do every two hours. I'm a restaurant manager who usually spends a lot of time bending over a low bar sink. It hurts a lot to do that work now and I'm on restricted capabilities, but these exercises are helping when I do too much and get sore. I plan to continue to do these exercises even after I've recovered from surgery. 
I don't know if this will help with whiplash specifically, but I've seen good results when using it to combat bartending fatigue. 
Are you doing heat pads or ice packs to relieve pain? CBD salve? Hot baths? Treat yo self!
Hope this helps!"

BarOwners,fdirfha,t3_eljyum,1578449368.0,"A nice quiet cocktail bar in my city plays vinyl. It’s really chill, not a DJ scene. The sound quality isn’t great and sometimes the record gets stuck on a loop for long stretches before the staff notice. It’s quaint and novel. They have modern records like Beyoncé’s Lemonade which is awesome to hear beginning to end in a bar."

legaladvice,fcubzdk,t3_eiwcw3,1577977422.0,"I just want to gently say that your ex will be under a lot of anxiety and stress knowing that you are so close by. Even if you no longer pose a threat to her, you've caused some emotional trauma that doesn't go away for a long time, sometimes never. I'm so glad you've turned your life around, but understand this will be harder for her. She was in fear of you, hadn't seen you in a while, then suddenly you pop up at her home where she should feel safe. I have no legal advice, but I want to offer empathetic support."
