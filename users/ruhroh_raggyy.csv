The next I’m thinking of ways I could go that would put the least amount of stress on my family. I know that I have so much to look forward to in life and I’m even scared of death but it seems that more often than not, I do want to die"
DoesAnybodyElse,fffawp3,t3_et9ug2,1579879924.0,"yes!! this happens to me very often and usually it’s completely random. sometimes my ears will get so hot that it’ll feel like i’m sitting directly next to a fire and i’ll have to use an ice pack to alleviate some of the pain. i talked to my doctor about this but she just shrugged it off like i was joking so i’m guessing it’s not anything serious, it is really annoying though. i honestly thought i was the only one who experienced this, i’ve asked so many people if they experience this and they all acted like i was crazy"

DoesAnybodyElse,fericiu,t3_eqd1dk,1579354244.0,"i have to force myself to make eye contact with people when i’m talking to them, even my boyfriend or my friends. making eye contact immediately makes me want to tear up and start crying and i’ve never known why. sometimes my boyfriend will say “look at me” (never in a mean way) when we’re talking and i’ll look him in the eye and i can barely keep myself from bursting into tears"
DoesAnybodyElse,ferhqus,t3_eqdq6w,1579354033.0,"i’m not like this but my sister is. she’s extremely worried about getting locked in a store or restaurant after closing. she’s also like this when we go to see marvel movies if they happen to be late at night. she won’t want to stay for the after-credits scenes and gets very nervous and tries to make us leave when she sees the theater attendants starting to clean up the theater. i’ve only ever felt like this once or twice, when i had my first job in a warehouse hardware store. i always had closing shifts and would often be the last to clean up/get my stuff from my locker. for a while i worried that everyone else would forget that i was still there and lock me up in the store"

aww,fens7ox,t1_fenoazb,1579290037.0,"This cow is a Hereford. They’re naturally pretty large, hefty cattle, my family used to raise them along with black Angus. She’s a little fat but not morbidly overweight. A lot of cattle will fluctuate throughout the year in terms of weight, she may be pregnant or just eating well. Hereford cattle are raised for meat, so she was probably being fed a lot of grain (most likely in a feedlot) before being taken into this sanctuary."

DoesAnybodyElse,fdk052r,t3_elkjjm,1578492720.0,"i absolutely despise mirrors, especially at night. i’ve never had a mirror in my bedroom because of my fear of them. if i get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night i’ll refuse to look in the mirror and end up freaking myself out by the thought of accidentally looking into it and seeing something or someone behind me or something else in place of my reflection. i also worry that i’ll look into the mirror and see my reflection and my reflection will move on its own or smile back at me. sometimes i’ll even put my hand up beside my eyes as a sort of “blinder” to keep myself from catching my reflection"

DoesAnybodyElse,fdjz533,t3_elsoi5,1578491939.0,"that makes sense to me, your dog has been with you for a long time and has become a source of comfort for you. i do this with my cat, sometimes i’ll even just stick my nose into her fur when i’m holding her to make myself feel better. lots of people have scents that are comforting to them and yours just happens to be the scent of your dog"
DoesAnybodyElse,fdjyxd7,t3_elsu7i,1578491771.0,i’ve always been bad at receiving compliments because of the way i’ve always viewed myself in a negative way. i’m slowly but surely teaching myself to accept compliments and that i am worth receiving compliments. one thing that helps me is saying thank you and then immediately complimenting the person who complimented me. it helps me express my gratitude easier and makes me feel even better knowing that i’ve made someone happy by complimenting them

DoesAnybodyElse,fd60wub,t3_ejwrxq,1578183978.0,i have to force myself to eat when i’m sad and even then i can’t get much down. it’s like my body forgets that i need to eat and i won’t feel hungry. i had a bad breakup at the beginning of last year and lost 20 pounds in a single month by just not eating because i was too sad to. i’ve found that drinking chocolate milk keeps me full without making me feel the sickness i feel when i make myself eat during these times.
DoesAnybodyElse,fd608bu,t3_ek4vie,1578183734.0,"i do this a lot, especially when i’m out shopping. mainly it’s if i go to pick up an item and see that it’s damaged, i refuse to put it back on the shelf and get a better one because, in my mind, i’ve given that object the hope of being purchased so therefore i must buy it. this applies to anything, food items, clothing, etc."

Sometimes it won’t even be a landscape that will bring this feeling on. Oftentimes it’s random places like a corner of an unknown street or it could be a small cafe setting or a photo of an old gas station that will bring this feeling of longing and a homesickness for a place I’ve never been or seen or for a place that might not even exist."
