mentalillness,ff9gpda,t1_ff9gd56,1579712640.0,He viewed the message and now he's trying to call me. I really hope he gives up on that and messages me back
mentalillness,ff9gd56,t1_ff9g6em,1579712431.0,I'm trying to write a message as straight forward as possible so he can understand that I really need them. I'll definitely talk about suicidal thoughts. Thanks for the advice
Whatcouldgowrong,ff763mp,t1_ff75q06,1579641860.0,Good point
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6zz1g,t1_ff3z73m,1579638364.0,"It's tearing but yeah, definitely not a piercing"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6zwf0,t1_ff4wtcv,1579638321.0,That's a lot of time. How do you become so patient?
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6zs31,t1_ff3wcrj,1579638250.0,It's cool when done right.
Stretched,ff3p162,t3_erb3u5,1579545774.0,The fact that they only made one pair makes me think that they're just going to skip every size and force it through. Like everything else wasn't bad enough
toptalent,ferznvg,t1_fejgci0,1579359946.0,Dancers' feet do look like Gargoyle dicks but they do the job
toptalent,ferzb9c,t3_epclx6,1579359892.0,That looks like something Jordan Matter would photograph
Stretched,ferhs7g,t3_eqb1j5,1579354048.0,"I would go for something simple. See what color is ""dominant"" in your earrings and go for that. For example blue and pink. I'd also decide based on my skin undertone or my hair color, but I always overthink everything and there's no need for that"
Stretched,fergvx1,t3_eqf14i,1579353692.0, I usually don't like dangly earrings with stretched ears but those look so pretty
Stretched,fehtxgf,t3_ep2p7b,1579123798.0,"I actually regret not throwing in a pair of opalite plugs with my order since it's my favourite stone. Oh well, I'll most likely buy from them again anyway"
MurderedByWords,fee6dl8,t3_eon3m8,1579027334.0,Boom. Roasted
AmItheAsshole,fee5z40,t3_eonwna,1579027094.0,NAH. It's not your fault and your friend will understand if you explain it to him
Stretched,fee59uz,t1_fee55qu,1579026676.0,Oh cool. How long did it take to heal?
mildlyinteresting,fee50gd,t3_eooq5a,1579026522.0,"There's a person on tiktok (I don't know his username, I know about them through YouTube) that paints calculators. You should look it up, they might have done it lol"
Stretched,fee4lpi,t3_enwcgv,1579026281.0,Have you stretched your conch or punched it?
AmItheAsshole,fee43qq,t3_eoou9w,1579025987.0,"NTA. People do weird shit when they're scared and it's none of your fault. If someone has to be blamed, it's your aunt's for letting it out or not closing the gate properly (I don't think it's anyone's fault though)"
AmItheAsshole,fee33bf,t3_eonr2s,1579025388.0,"YTA. I agree with everyone in the comments. One think is if she laughs about it, one thing is if it's being made fun of by someone else. Her laughing about it could also be a coping mechanism"
asexuality,fedz65s,t1_fedz0b6,1579022970.0,You're right. I have time to discover
asexuality,fedyu3k,t1_fedyku3,1579022773.0,Thank you
AmItheAsshole,fedyrp2,t3_eoo84b,1579022732.0,Absolutely NTA. I can't imagine trusting someone after they did something like that. The fact that it's your mother changes nothing
twentyonepilots,fedygf7,t3_eoo8cq,1579022545.0,When the fan-made version is better than the original. I love Tydy but what was he thinking when he wrote Doubt?
mentalhealth,fedujxt,t1_fed6w0o,1579020198.0,Still a lot of stigma eh?
mentalhealth,fe5p0js,t3_env9nw,1578872450.0,I always regretted it but the addiction was stronger than the regret.

u_Imbred-,fdo7420,t3_bcmuy9,1578600040.0,"Too hard for me but I'll spread the word

Edit: I read the comments and I agree with almost everything they said. By ignoring constructive criticism (because this isn't hate at all) you're just making yourself look bad. I'm not going to say that you need to improve because you've heard it enough but at least stop being so defensive and understand that just because it's art it can't have flaws. Style doesn't exclude technique and vice versa"
socialanxiety,fdnmsa7,t3_ema5fc,1578589050.0,That was totally me on the first day of high school. I was one of the first ones to get called and I couldn't prepare what I was going to say so I was panicking. I ended up saying the stupidest thing
Stretched,fdnjimu,t3_elly0y,1578587123.0,At first I didn't see his lobes were so small and it was a joke and I was getting triggered because of the taper part lol
Stretched,fdniyrf,t3_embff8,1578586792.0,Yeah I'd say dead stretching is the best. I haven't got personal experience with taping but I've heard that the tape sticks to the lobes sometimes
Stretched,fdnikgh,t3_emb3jr,1578586552.0,Is it weird that the only thing that seems strange is the transversal lobe piercing?
socialanxiety,fdnc84v,t1_fdhj17n,1578582662.0,"To be honest, I don't know. I went to school yesterday and I had my first anxiety attack (it was the most intense and prolonged anxiety I've ever felt) and I skipped today as well. But other than that, I'm pretty happy."
socialanxiety,fdk1tm1,t3_elqzow,1578493956.0,"Honestly, not avoiding them is the best way. I get more and more comfortable as I do more. Also, be very prepared in a lot of different areas that correlate to the topic you're presenting, so you don't freak out when getting a question. And, if you don't know the answer to that question, try to calm down and work around it."
socialanxiety,fdg5bf1,t1_fdftppt,1578380612.0,I had a panic attack and I couldn't go. Great
socialanxiety,fdf2yjk,t3_ekz8hz,1578352113.0,I hate hearing my voice so I basically assume everyone else does. So I almost never do that
socialanxiety,fdf2si2,t1_fdf2ht2,1578352005.0,For what?
Stretched,fdf2qhw,t1_fdctvui,1578351968.0,The other one is  perfectly centered
bodymods,fdf2ocg,t3_ekr4me,1578351930.0,I wish I could get a split tounge but I have the vein thing and I can't get a piercing so I doubt that I'll be able to get it split unfortunately
Stretched,fd9ey0y,t1_fd8yhbt,1578232484.0,"Thank you. I'll definitely go slow, I don't want to rip my ear un half lol"
Stretched,fcymena,t1_fcyln7s,1578082710.0,I thought it would be fine since at that stage the sizes have less than half a millimeter increments and there's much bigger jumps (0g to 00g for example)
Stretched,fcylm0o,t1_fcylczj,1578082273.0,I'll tape until the 8g then
Stretched,fcylg08,t3_eji5sh,1578082182.0,I also bought my first pair of glass plugs from Arctic Buffalo! I ordered them just a few hours ago and I'm so excited to finally start stretching properly
Stretched,fcx7bkq,t3_eitunx,1578054163.0,"I chose 00g because it's as big as it can possibly get while still being able to shrink back. I might go over that because I think it's really pretty, however finding jobs might be difficult (I don't live in America and I don't know how accepting my small city is), school etc."
Stretched,fclnrw4,t1_fclnomf,1577752137.0,Sorry I misunderstood. Good luck with your next project!
Stretched,fclnlh0,t1_fbye5mh,1577752016.0,"Sorry for the late reply, I often don't receive notifications from Reddit. Anyway, the point is not stirring slowly or quickly (although stirring too quickly can cause air bubbles) but rather stirring more."
BALLET,fclndm4,t1_fc19ynq,1577751865.0,"Tapers are terrible, especially acrylic as it tends to stink and it even caused me an infection. You can look it up somewhere else for a more detailed explanation, but essentially, acrylic is porous and collects bacteria as well as releasing chemicals when it reaches body temperature."
Stretched,fcln68n,t1_fcklbqw,1577751726.0,"I don't think I'll be stretching my septum just because it'll be harder to breathe but I agree that it looks super cool.
Well, it's good that you can think about it until you're 18 so you don't pierce impulsively but then you can do whatever you want so"
Stretched,fck17n9,t3_eha8fi,1577713430.0,"I'm 15 and my mom gave consent to get my septum pierced, even if she doesn't like it. She had a nostril piercing, her lobes and 2nd lobes and her bellybutton. She also had multiple tattoos. My dad is not into body mods but he's still getting me glass and stainless steel plugs to start dead stretching.

As for the size, I don't plan on going over 00g (10mm) just in case I get bored of them and want to take them out. My parents agreed on this size for the same reason.
I'm in art school so even there, I won't have to hide anything.


Edit: my mom said that she won't get me any other piercing but as soon as I'm 18 I'm getting snake bites, just because I like how they look with the septum. 
I'm lucky that my parents are both very open minded."
AskReddit,fck05kj,t3_ehlzrh,1577712377.0,I'd like to be a teen in the 2000's or another era with some good rock bands
Stretched,fbxqg3y,t3_ee0ipx,1577197617.0,"I used to cast resin charms. The resin is sticky because you might have not mixed the 2 parts enough (since both parts are clear it's not visible if they're completely mixed) or if the measurements aren't precise. If the plug is sticky only in some parts it's problem number one, if the whole thing is sticky, it's number 2.

A few tips: 

If you don't mix enough: 
if you don't plan on using any type of color (more on that later) I suggest you mix at least five minutes, unless the resin cures quicker.
If you use colors, measure one part of resin and mix the color in it so it's easier to notice when the two parts are completely mixed. Also, don't use acrylic paints or anything water-based, it'll come out lumpy and spotted.

If you don't measure well enough: use a scale, it's a lot easier and more precise than measuring by volume.

I hope you understood, english isn't my first language sorry"
