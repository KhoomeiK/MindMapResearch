television,ff8c1st,t1_ff739cd,1579672439.0,We fundamentally disagree. I find libertarians to be dangerous and the antithesis to anything I'd want for this country.
television,ff6tzmw,t1_ff6srj7,1579634844.0,"No, we'll get a different party replacing one of the other parties in a third party system. Mathematically speaking only two parties can exist in first past the post.

Also you're very much suggesting people gamble their lives on an unsure bet. Many people's lives are on the line of keeping the worst candidate from winning."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff6mzrt,t1_ff5wf9x,1579630657.0,"Yeah, I think boosters work for competitions since the random element of the decks is fun in and of itself but you're basically always getting a raw deal if you buy them yourself."
television,ff6msud,t1_ff64p49,1579630541.0,You need less people to realize it's a good idea and push for political change than to realize it's a good idea to vote third party. Not that America has that much good in the third party because anyone with political savvy knows if you want the big seats you have to run one side or the other.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff5vqzv,t1_ff5r0iv,1579611899.0,I don't think booster packs are a good deal either. I'd encourage people never to buy boosters and just buy the cards they want.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff5qrvv,t1_ff5b9fm,1579606493.0,"Well you paid for the five characters. If any part of something you've purchased is questionable then it makes sense to voice the displeasure and if some parts are going to be mediocre at least sit and wait until all characters are revealed.

If it's a minority of people that feel this way then nothing changes, but if a majority feel that way then they'll see that reflected in the sales figures and investigate into why that happened and people voicing their displeasure tells them why it happened."
television,ff5qo8c,t1_ff55ydn,1579606361.0,If it becomes something the people overwhelmingly want and are aware is necessary the best political move would be to be the first party that passes it for the political clout it will give them. However you are right that it'll likely start on a smaller scale first.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff511zy,t1_ff2skj2,1579577356.0,"I mean questioning their choices, and if you'll buy a DLC pass from them again, is valid. 

Now being angry is a step too far I'll agree, but as a customer I do think people who bought the pass have a right to show their displeasure about it. To emphasize that they don't want that action repeated."
television,ff50ttt,t1_ff2x84j,1579577192.0,"What if that little gambit fails? That's trusting a lot of people to realize the same thing. Especially if you have immediate important interests like not having a President that demonizes your religion or nationality or getting healthcare so your cancer diagnosis doesn't lead to bankruptcy.

Mathematically speaking First Past The Post means a two party system is the only viable option."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff2ryrm,t1_ff2j0xt,1579521522.0,"It was a bad PR move, and when the other fighters set a precedent for characters people wanted or were unique it's understandable people would be upset that the final one isn't anything the majority wanted.

It's like getting 4/5ths of a Pizza. Yeah you have a majority of the pizza and it's pretty good pizza but you're allowed to wonder where the rest of your fucking pizza went."
television,ff2qfa5,t1_ff2fusz,1579519311.0,"Unlikely to happen without one of the parties doing something egregious to the average voter. Otherwise the voter has to rely on strategic voting.

In our system a vote for a third party is a vote for our ideological opponent."
television,ff2f74l,t1_ff2c267,1579503603.0,Well it's simplified language but moving to ranked voting and abolishing the electoral college would effectively get rid of the two party system.
videos,fek3iic,t1_fek2las,1579191836.0,"I'm not saying which is right or wrong just mentioning the common way of talking about it. If you wanna go against the grain be my guest but from my experience there aren't that many who use the term transsexual now.

Younger trans people find trying to make the distinction distasteful because it feels like those trying to use the transexual label are trying to distance themselves and only get rights for themselves or at least saying certain people under the transgender label aren't worth fighting for. 

Meanwhile some older trans people like activist/pornstar Buck Angel seem to feel like it's a backstep from the progress they made getting the few rights trans people do have."
videos,feje31m,t1_fej8b04,1579169560.0,"There's a certain fetishizing and treating people as exotic. Look for example at the fetishization of race. The ""sexy submissive Asian girl"" the ""big strong black man""

It's not liking the person for the person but for a fetish. Now if you just want a one night stand that's okay but would you want to deal with that if you were looking for a potential relationship?"
videos,fejdrwp,t1_fej9j2v,1579169095.0,That's an old school term. Transgender hits the whole umbrella but some older trans people do prefer for there to be a division whether you agree or disagree with the thought.

AskReddit,fdqgzeo,t1_fdqfir2,1578666429.0,"Whether intentional or unintentional you can give your kid a weird perspective of their body autonomy. Especially some  of the replies suggesting ""It's okay to make her because we're family"" and such."
AskReddit,fdprdjm,t1_fdmyr1f,1578637583.0,"""No means no"" when it comes to the body. That's it. My body my choice.

It'd be like saying ""You're supposed to kiss your boyfriend. So you must kiss them whenever they want it."" which no, a kiss is innocuous but you don't be expected for your body autonomy to be invaded just because it's the expected outcome of a relationship.

There's plenty of sleazy guys at parties who will abuse this ""What, no hug?"" So they can touch women even if they're uncomfortable with it."
AskReddit,fdpr7lt,t1_fdn5q9r,1578637414.0,"That's not your responsibility for their weird viewpoint that if someone doesn't want a hug that they should never offer a hug again.

Not to mention if you don't want to be touched a hug being forced on you is a negative impact."
AskReddit,fdpqle5,t1_fdpq6fe,1578636772.0,">That’s so funny. Because seriously, I said no all the time to food as a kid and my mother still made me eat it even if I threw up.

You do realize that's fucked up, yeah?

>Y’all are seriously equating this to rape

No we're saying having boundaries is important. Coercion can happen in relationships and having a strong sense of saying no is important.

When your kid grows up should they kiss their partner because they love them even if they don't want to kiss at the moment?"
AskReddit,fdpkwii,t1_fdo5d0a,1578631461.0,"So you *do* think it's comparable.

No should mean no when it comes to someone else's body. Even if you think they're being playful or silly.

It's not about hating all physical contact. It's about boundaries. The reason for a no shouldn't matter, the fact the child said no should be enough."
television,fdnco3b,t1_fdn1ge0,1578582947.0,"It really wasn't I imagine, it was probably just to publicly distance the company from that trainwreck of a person since I think some bits of the case against him are in the news again."
AskReddit,fdmtnjo,t1_fdmouqt,1578565238.0,"Then why the fuck did you reply to someone telling a story about a woman running across a room to yell at her daughter for not giving another kid a hug?

If they're not comparable why share this story and bring the comparison up?"
AskReddit,fdmssn3,t1_fdmkuke,1578564011.0,"It's even more important to admit when you're wrong, apologize and move on. It's a good lesson for your kids and perhaps one you never learned growing up."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdjzgto,t1_fdjmbxq,1578492192.0,I mean the soviets were bad. They were a totalitarian regime that wore the veneer of a people's movement.

AskReddit,fcx5c8u,t1_fcx23lj,1578051884.0,"This isn't a study but according to this article involving experts on the matter: https://abcnews.go.com/US/72-hours-missing-persons-investigation-critical-criminology-experts/story?id=58292638

Children who are kidnapped, which is rare but still can happen, can be killed as quickly as within the first 3 hours and often within the first 2 days.

It also brings up protecting the integrity of evidence if there is any. Which I believe is where the 24 hours thing comes in. The integrity of any evidence being degraded may result in not finding the person at all."
AskReddit,fcwlibc,t1_fcwkceg,1578028976.0,"That's a straight-up fact. Any loose particles in that environment could be dangerous to the tech, so eliminating as man chances of that happening as possible is a good practice."

todayilearned,fcvcai5,t1_fcv41n2,1577999094.0,CEOs are in the position to be predatory towards the average worker. The law doesn't need to apply on both ends because the power dynamic is very different.
todayilearned,fcua3pq,t1_fcu6we4,1577976152.0,"What I'm saying is that the actual cost of a CEO is not that high. They're driving up the price in this late stage capitalist system. Treating it like the money's never going to stop rising and focusing on short term gains.

There's nothing in the expertise of a CEO that should make them cost 40x or more of an average worker's pay in the same company.

The price has been increased more and more over time making a few folks much wealthier while employees suffer."

todayilearned,fctozqt,t1_fctoucc,1577952212.0,Oh woops you're right I got it in reverse. They ruled the mandate unconstitutional and the only reason the ACA was untouchable was it was a tax so the Trump administration could trim off whatever they wanted after that.
