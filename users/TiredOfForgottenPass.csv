NetflixBestOf,ff8saa6,t1_ff7m6rz,1579694122.0,"I liked Roanoke. I've loved all the seasons but I'm very simple when it comes to movies and shows. i like just about anything and everything unless it's something or someone I'm not interested in or it is just terrible acting/writing/story.

For example, I'm sure Lord of the Rings was amazing and those actors are amazing at what they do, but in my entire 28 years it has never been something I have been interested in watching and therefore haven't. I disliked Twilight because it was terrible acting from nearly everyone (I love Stewart and Pattinson in everything else) and i couldn't get over the fact that he sparkled. The books I felt were terribly written, like if a kid with limited vocab was writing. My best friend liked them so I really wanted to like them."

But I've been using my state ID or nothing at all (writing my name DOB and other info on a piece of paper). I used to live right at the border so I crossed at least twice a week. The last 5 years it has only been 5 or so times a year. My brothers are US born and they don't have a passport but have been crossing their entire lives.

However, I've crossed back without anything. Never had a problem since I have a passport on the system but before I had a passport they only required a state ID to cross. So it's still sorta true you don't need much to cross. As long as you're legal they can find you. But I think if you have a green card, they are allowed to charge you dor entering without appropriate documents but citizens cannot be denied entry (that's what immigration told me)."
NoStupidQuestions,fewhfbo,t1_few2bht,1579410628.0,"Not usually. I didn't work during my university years but a student only qualifies for in state tuition in the state where their parents/sponsors do their taxes. So someone from Nebraska wouldn't qualify for in state tuition In Iowa unless their parents moved there and started doing their taxes there. There are some students that do work during the school year and I was told (though this was 6 years ago) my income had to be at around $20k for me to qualify for in-state and that would have required nearly full time at a low paying job. I knew very few people that worked full time. Most only worked part time to cover some bills and the rest was either family help or loans.

TLDR: A student doesn't qualify for in-state tuition just for going to a school. It is based on their parents/sponsor taxes or their own."

We clean ours everyday so it doesn't smell bad, but I guess odd it does, but I can't think of a reason why any would willingly stay in the bathroom soaking up the odd smells. I've read that a lot of people go on Reddit when they use the bathroom but peeing is a matter of seconds and if you have good bowel functions then it's also quick. I wouldn't even have time to unlock my phone from the moment I sit down to the moment I grab the toilet paper because it happens so quick.

So, anyone can write a novel but it takes practice and skill to be a storyteller. A lot of my clients struggle with showing and not telling or having an idea that flows naturally. I also edit a lot of nonfiction and anyone can throw together an essay but it doesnt make it a good essay. I think it's true for a lot of things.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fei6luz,t1_fei5h59,1579131433.0,"Yes my situation might be different. I have nothing downloaded except reddit and a texting app for clients. Other than that I don't download anything else that people use, like games, social media, etc. I imagine not using those will cut down on lag. I also use wifi 90% of my time so I also have cheap service ($35 a month for unlimited everything + service in Mexico).

My main force is my laptop because it's my work station. I assume others might treat their phones the way I treat my laptops. Although I've met a lot people with more expensive phones than my laptop, which is insane to me. However, I don't usually keep a laptop for more than 2 years. I think the last one I bought a year ago and will buy a new one this summer. I donate all my lightly used electronics to students in Mexico (I make sure it's good condition) and I keep Microsoft Office installed and can get most programs they need for cheap or free which helps them out."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fei57zd,t1_fehwpmz,1579130551.0,"Interesting. I only buy Motorola but they are cheap. I only use my phone to text clients and for reddit so I can use the cheapest thing available. I once bought a $60 Motorola phone at Walmart and it lasted me 4 years. It was my brother that ended up breaking it, so not even me. But at $15 a year, I see no reason to buy a phone for $400+ and to risk breaking it after a few years. At most I would get 7 years about of something, which is the same as buying a $60 phone each year, so I would still be spending more than double regardless."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feeohdn,t1_fee0r30,1579037901.0,"I paid off my student loans and it would be amazing to have them paid off. Just because I got a bad deal doesn't mean that I want others to go through it. It's like in my family, rape wasn't taken seriously because it was something that a lot of the women faced and considered it a female-related issue like menstruation. Just because I was raped does not mean I would want someone else to be raped. It applies to anything really, should we never work on medical treatments because it won't be fair for the people that died? People that think like that should never go in for medical care because it won't be fair to those that suffered or died from it.

I couldn't care less about a refund/credit. I own my own business and have a good revenue stream. But not everyone is in the same position and if a partial refund was allowed it would be great for those that need it."

I know this is the case for a lot of language learner's. My mom dropped out in middle school in Mexico so she didn't really learn about grammar, but when she was learning English in the US, she said it helped her understand the structure of Spanish grammar since she was trying to connect her new knowledge with something she was familiar with.

I primarily work with ELL/ESL student and they have all said that learning new grammar rules has enhanced their understanding of their native language and make less mistakes.

No one is perfect, we all make mistakes and constantly learn, which I argue is different than confusing languages."

I'll always respond to what he is saying. After I'm done, I'll usually say a variation of:

*Babe, remember it's ""this"" not ""that""*

I'm never meant to insult. I want him to learn the correct way of saying things. He will be an engineer soon and many people associate language with professionalism. Also working on teaching him Spanish and he's working on teaching me Arabic (very early stages) so we make more mistakes then not and we are also attentive and encouraging.

In Australia it's 10g

ShitAmericansSay,fdilo9q,t1_fdigamh,1578445682.0,"Yes, I think it's ridiculous to use BMI and I've never even been to a doctor that uses it. I was always taught to measure in BF% because the % has much more impact than total weight. No one would imply Schwarzenegger is unhealthy because he carries a lot of weight. It would be unhealthy if he was carrying a lot of BF.

I was actually just about to do some research about the measure of obesity. I know and have seen a lot more overweight/obese/""fat"" people in Mexico than the US, which means I associate Mexico with obesity more than the US. My husband is from the UAE and he says per capita, Emirates at bigger and he associates obesity with Arabs, whereas most people have never made a joke connecting Gulf Countries with obesity.

I work with a lot of people from the Gulf countries, but very few of them are overweight, so it's all about your exposure. In the US, I've had the privilege to not live in poverty, which means I see less overweight people in the areas I've lived. Someone living in poverty, an overweight demographic, might say the opposite.

I'm not sure how the Canadian and US system compare in terms of quality. The US is ridiculously expensive and overall the quality was good when my parents had insurance through their jobs.  I was always sick and spent a lot of time at doctors. But judging only quality, I can't compare to Canada (no experience). I live 2 hours from Mexico and do all my health stuff there because the cost is cheaper and I go to great doctors (which are still cheap compared to the US).

I guess depending on the issue the US can be good or bad. Regarding PCOS, Endo, and related issues all the US doctors I visited were terrible. I decided to go to my stepsisters specialist in Mexico and she has been amazing. I also have a vision problem and doctors in the US didn't help so I'm also going to a specialist in Mexico. My stepdad and mom did their cancer treatment in Mexico and everything was great. My mother did her fertility treatments in Mexico and all was well."
ShitAmericansSay,fdijuzx,t1_fdiga25,1578444532.0,"Interesting. This is what I found:

As defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), a standard drink is half an ounce of alcohol. That means one 12-ounce beer, one five-ounce glass of wine, and one 1.5-ounce shot of distilled spirits each count as one standard drink.

Here's a good chart
https://www.businessinsider.com/drinks-before-driving-if-bac-is-05-2013-5

Earlier I said, for most people one drink is too much, but then I remembered how big the ""average"" person is and 1 beer would likely put them at the 0.02% limit in your country but would take 2-3 beers to be at the 0.08% limit.

However, total agreement that even 0.02% sounds generous. It's not that hard to NOT drink and drive. If you want to go out and drink but know you can't find a ride or DD, then be an adult and suck it up.

If you absolutely feel that you need to drink, then accept a possible problem and get help sooner than later. There's no worse feeling than being physically dependent on a substance and then have to deal with long-term health issues. Unfortunately, binge drinking and shit faced culture is quite the norm in Mexico and the US."

Based on other statistics, it appears most wealthy countries are struggling with their population being overweight or obese. It reads weird to have obesity constantly linked to one country. However, Hasan Minhaj does have an episode on how the US caused/impacted global obesity.

Other than that, the US concept of freedom is a joke (which feels like OPs intention) and unfortunately a lot of people believe it and defend it. They don't want the country to progress. They just want their version of society. People suck."

My brothers did forgive my cousin for what he did to them because they feel like his own abuse screwed him over and he didn't understand what he was doing. I've always admired them for that and they are still close. It's something they've confronted and left in the past to create a better future."

No matter how much discipline I had and everything I did to make it work. No matter how tired I am, my quality of sleep at night is terrible, even with medications and everything else I have done to try to improve my sleep. However, sleeping starting at sunrise is my best quality of sleep and I don't need to force it, take meds, or do anything else.

Everyone is different. Some women can grow large breasts, but not everyone can no matter how hard they try. Some people can roll their tongue and others will never be able to no matter how hard they try. Genetics plays a huge role in shaping our abilities and experiences and it's something you can't control. It's better to accept what you can/'t do and do your best to adjust your life to have a good experience with your capabilities."

Not saying it's healthy, but we are awake at 11pm hanging out. This is especially true in the desert areas where stores close a few hours during the day and remain open at night because it's fresher.

JobProfiles,fdbre32,t1_fdbq6jb,1578260798.0,"Funny! I'm an English major so definitely liberal arts. I used to volunteer at the high school when I was in college and too many students have terrible communication skills. Even at my university, a lot of the freshman did not know the basics of writing an essay, essay formatting, doing research, analyzing sources, write professional emails, write a memo, communicate a message clearly, etc. Writing is my passion and that's what I get paid to do (averaging $60-80 an hour).

I will definitely contemplate long and hard. It's been years since I volunteered at school so maybe I should get involved before making a drastic career change."
JobProfiles,fdbpoki,t3_ekgr7p,1578259901.0,"Would you say that the pay is worth it, when you figure all the hours you spend prepping. I always hear that teachers put in 15+ hours outside of class getting things graded and putting together activities or lessons. That could mean 50-60 hours a week.

So if I was a teacher with just a BA and it's my first year, I would be 270.97 a day, which is $22-26 an hour, working a total of 50-60 hours a week. Of course, after taxes this will drop to about $17-19 an hour. Do you consider this to be worth doing?

Of course, I'm going based on what I hear. I wanted to be a teacher, but heard about teachers struggling and working multiple jobs so I went a different route and have a small business. However, I am still passionate about working with teens and making a difference in their lives and would be interested in teaching but that would likely mean a large pay cut from my current wage, more stress, and less control."

I doubt there is a single trait that everyone in a country engages in, because each family is different and has different experiences.

In Mexico, some of my family take off their shoes and some don't. I'm in the US and we have hard wood floors, but we don't wear our shoes inside. We have slippers that we change into to avoid bringing in anything. What if you stepped on dry pee?

The family that babysat my brothers and I, that taught my parents English, and went on vacations with us now constantly post things about wanting (non-white) immigrants out, ending birth right citizenship, and making it illegal to speak anything but English.

The funny part is, they were also so proud of being Italian-American. It was part of their identity and now they are just American and argue that if you call yourself anything other than American, you're a traitor. I was born in Mexico, raised in the US and split my adult time between both countries. My Mexican identity is just as important as my American one, yet I'm a traitor because my family ""made the mistake"" of being from Mexico and for giving birth to me there and shaping my identity? Stupid.

Just glad I get to see people's real thoughts now. It must be exhausting to remind yourself to hate things for dumb reasons."

I did eventually leave but a few weeks ago I was looking for some classmates profiles online and 90% of them are extremely anti-immigrant or in reality they are against any non-white individuals.

At the time of meeting and getting engaged, the only ""social media"" I knew my husband had was WhatsApp which is more just a texting app than posting pictures and posts (which some people use). I didn't find out till a week before we got married, that he had an old Facebook account (also no posts). I just found out last week he has a Twitter because I saw him scrolling on it.

Not once has social media ever come up. I found out about Facebook because my family in Mexico loved him and wanted to stay in touch so they told me to ask him, otherwise I would likely have not found out until recently. Perhaps I didn't think about social media because he was an old client of mine and I have never looked up clients on social media, because of name differences. Also because most of my clients only use Snapchat and Instagram which I have never used.

A lot of women (which I am) have pointed out that they check social media for safety. I understand that and it's a valid point. I had a boyfriend in HS and didn't see anyone until 8 years later when I started seeing my now-husband. That could be why I've never used social media to check people, since I've never seen anyone, even casually."

First name - His surname - My surname

Essentially, we put his surname as a middle name and my surname as both our surname. While the lady that gave us the license asked if we were sure, because it's uncommon for a man to excitedly take a woman's name. But my father was excited and he thought it was cool the way we did it. He sees it as getting another son.
