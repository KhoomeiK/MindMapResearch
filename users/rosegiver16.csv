fatlogic,fdhhj8u,t3_elda8u,1578422772.0,Not to mention less food wastes. Only buying what you need and eating it quickly if itâ€™s fresh
fatlogic,fcwyuao,t1_fcw4s2b,1578043540.0,Nope unfortunately not. It is all over the haes little boards and hashtags

If you feel that way then self diagnose yourself and go on your merry way. 
They weigh you for a reason. Itâ€™s a tool to help diagnose a problem that can be associated with your weight. It is a tool to help factor out weight if that is not the problem.
Scales are just tools that is it! If you are triggered that much go seek help from a psychiatrist, because an inanimate object should not trigger you like this."
fatlogic,fctwga8,t3_eip08v,1577963038.0,"This statement always infuriate me on a deep level. Especially since every type of food regime you go into is a type of diet. Itâ€™s just the way you eat on a daily basis.
Just because there are terrible fad diets out there you shouldnâ€™t put down lifestyle changes for the better. It takes time not this whole 6 weeks to lose a certain amount of pounds. You start to learn a different way to eat, and introduce different things to your lifestyle. Iâ€™ve lost 45 lbs from a diet change. (Keto) 
But it took me about 8 months to do this, and granted probably could have lost more, but the fact is I went through a mental change also. Life just happens that way, but itâ€™s the fact that you have to change your old ways in order to change for the better! Itâ€™s freaking hard to do at first, but it does gets easier later on...hence a lifestyle change."
