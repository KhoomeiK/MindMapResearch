The only place I knew that did was the Gimme 5 program. They had a bin at Whole Paycheck, but I struggled to find it last time I was in there (I go specifically for that. I can't afford any of their products). It looked like it was in a state of disrepair."

Frugal,ff3512d,t3_eq1ai2,1579533838.0,"Greeting cards! Many are even 2/$1. 

So many cleaning supplies. I like to get the gallons of bleach. They're a better deal than the smaller size, but they don't always have the gallons. LA's Totally Awesome cleaner (the stuff that looks like pee) is a really good cleaner/stain remover. They also sell a version of oxygen cleaner powder (think Oxyclean).  I have no issue with their liquid laundry detergent. The big thing of dryer sheets is a really good deal.

In my area, they usually sell the Sunday newspaper with the coupons and everything on Monday. The vendor doesn't always drop them off, though. Family Dollar also does this (also $1 there). 

I buy body wash there. I will admit it doesn't lather as well as I'd like, but I manage because I'm cheap af. Their baby powder is just fine. 

I love to get their jars of pizza sauce and packages of Hormel pepperoni. I make my own crust. They have larger boxes of Hungry Jack cheese scalloped potatoes. They're always good. They occasionally have boxes of Hamburger Helper. I like to get their 6 pack of frozen garlic bread. They also sell individual Hot Pockets. I've purchased ice cream there before. I LOVE their Rip It energy drinks. Their bags of cheese popcorn are great. They have cheese puffs, too. 

It's a really good place to get wine glasses or other types of glasses. 

Reading glasses are a good deal there. 

They recently raised the price of their candy bars to $1 (used to be $0.89), so avoid those; you can usually find them cheaper at the grocery store. But the boxes of ""movie theater"" style candy are a good deal. 

Padded mailing envelopes are a really good deal there. They also sell rolls of brown ""packaging paper"" or whatever it's called. This is usually more paper than a lot of their rolls of wrapping paper, so it makes good wrapping paper. Watch their wrapping paper. Some of the rolls are really small. They also sell a lot of birthday party supplies. There's a national helium shortage, but when they have it, they sell mylar balloons.

Don't buy toothpaste there. Aim is $1 there but $0.85 at Walmart."
