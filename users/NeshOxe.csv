Guildwars2,ffer95v,t1_ffenovt,1579861570.0,"Also I would like to add small instanced mini encounters throughout the open world where if you can defeat the boss/instance you get a certain guaranteed item. As in unique account bound weapon skins, armor skins, dyes, novelties. They can even be solo so that it’d motivate players to come up with builds and gear combinations to suit a certain battle to get that unique reward. The harder fights have cooler looking rewards. And they can only be done within a particular time period depending on the map meta/events. Just a random thought."

When the parents don’t give a single fuck about their child’s mental well-being later on we get adults who can’t function properly in society. This is a result of poor education, culture, poverty and shitty people."

misanthropy,fe9jc3o,t1_fdsyeol,1578938094.0,"Killing for survival is not immoral. It’s a part of nature. We are omnivores after all.
If you killed a living organism it doesn’t matter if you kill another hundred for your survival. You have already done it. Doing it less wont change the fact that you ve already done. 
As long as we breed those animals, we plant those plants and give them the necessary conditions to grow consuming those organisms is not a wrong in my mind. It was their purpose to begin with. 

Guess this argument boils down to your personal feelings about the importance of animal life and your general sense of how life works. I don’t think there is anything else to be discussed. If you truly believe all animals should not be consumed then you re a kind person. Have a wonderful day."
misanthropy,fe9fo7t,t1_fdqbkxb,1578937145.0,"My point is that it doesn’t matter if you eat plants or animals living matter is living matter.
Killing little as possible? And what do we gain from that? Killing one organism is no better than killing a hundred. In reference to morality a wrong should not be done. 

If you have to kill one organism to survive then saying that that action is wrong and we shouldnt kill more for survival is ridiculous."

misanthropy,fdq4hb4,t1_fdnuu51,1578654424.0,"Obviously they are not the same but If you consider taking a life in that sense yes. Aren’t they both living breathing organisms? Suffering doesn’t matter here we are talking bout a living being eating another living being to survive and the moral of it. 
Would you be eating meat of an animal if it died from natural causes. I disagree with the worlds current state of the meat industry. It is an unfortunate result of human overpopulation and greed. People don’t have to stop eating it. It’s just the amount they need is ridiculous. I think the animals don’t need to suffer like that. This matter should have been dealt with in a better way by us."
misanthropy,fdq3ll1,t1_fdnu2bm,1578653205.0,Yes as things are right now if you compare us we are superior obviously otherwise they d be consuming us. In my mind a wrong is a wrong. That’s how morality works. In the long run you are basically destroying that plants genes from their gene pool just like you are doing to animals. It’s hard for me to imagine that plants like it when you rip apart their body parts and consume them.
misanthropy,fdnq6xz,t1_fdnnv1i,1578590759.0,"No I did not compare a dog to a broccoli.and I’m not saying anything bout suffering. Stop rephrasing what I said.
All I’m saying is that life is life whether it’s made out of red meat and have a consciousness or whether it’s a plant unable to move.
What authority in your moral sense do you have over another living being even if it’s a plant?"
misanthropy,fdnn4ey,t1_fdlseke,1578589245.0,"As much as I disagree with killing animals just for taste the fact if we didn’t kill living organisms for food then we’d be starving makes your argument invalid. Just because the said organisms doesn’t have a consciousness doesn’t mean it’s better to kill it over others different from it. You are taking something from those organisms, however odd it may seem to you a life is a life. If you want to uphold your ethics and show true compassion then stop eating living matter or change your ethics. Since we can’t die from hunger how is it any better to kill and consume a living being even if it didn’t have a consciousness?"
lonely,fdnktsa,t1_fdkx256,1578587899.0,Same here. I just automatically zip it in front of people. It’s gotten to a point where interacting with people online/over voice has the same results. Maybe it’s cause of my poor personality and the dumb shit I think of.
