Virginia,ff8ttki,t3_es5wyr,1579695840.0,Finally. The amount of non enforccable morality laws on the books is nuts. Remember a few years ago when they realized it was still illegal for a man and women to live together without being married. We are slowly moving into the new millenium.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff7mh62,t1_ff4jdax,1579653075.0,That was a crazy read. Thank you.

Virginia,fehshvf,t1_fehok5d,1579122992.0,Well I for one am glad you are not in charge of anything related to running our government.
Virginia,fehnyh0,t1_fehicx7,1579120388.0,So childless people can't vote. You are getting weirder by the comment.....
Virginia,fehi7ck,t1_feheg67,1579117053.0,So you don't vote in VA right? Since that would go against our values of not welcoming carpetbaggers? Or are conservative carpetbaggers ok but not others?
Virginia,feharr1,t1_feh9be8,1579112706.0,"Which ones? The sharecroppers from the 1800s? The one who fought here in the Revolutionary War? The ones that worked in community development for VA? The Community Activists? Literally which ones my roots in this state are nuts. I had my wedding vows renewed by the Governor and followed it up with a ham biscuit and local bourbon. Do you want Mountain rootes about the history of the Shenandoah or sailing routing from the Eastern Shore? I know more history about this state than I care to admit. Have you even seen the Cannabalism victim at Jamestown? Or stood of the floor of the state senate? Get out of here with your nonsense, what state are you even from to come with your shitty attitude?"

Obviously this is what you moved here to do. Do I hate the urban planning of suburbia, yes, that is why I live in a city. Don't blame the new residents for urban planning and shitty houses."
Virginia,feh6jyb,t1_feh528c,1579110194.0,"Wait, in this analogy legal immigrants from other countries and Utah (?) are legally gonna come here enmass register their cars here, buy homes or rent in VA, pay taxes, open business and move all over the state and put back into the economy and we aren't going to allow them to vote based on not liking their politics? This is the state of Madison, Jefferson and Washington but we need to make a litmus test for voting based on our need for VA to retain the status quo and our fear of the people? What the literal fuck, Virginians take pride in democratic government reflective of the needs and wants of the residents, we have a 400 year old democratic body that has changed countries three times, four if you count back to the US after the Civil War, and you feel confident that this current snapshot of VA right now is what we need to protect as the status quo? This is your line in the Sand? Look, I don't normally say this as I love new residents of Virginia, whether it is for the short or long term but for fucks sake please go back where you came from. Thanks."
Virginia,feh4mil,t1_feh45rb,1579109043.0,"Where are all these conservatives coming from? Also the VA Republicans are always trying to ban abortion, that isn't new and we have been fighting them forever. Get a better analogy."
Virginia,feh3s5b,t1_fegrd01,1579108545.0,My family has been here since it was a colony and I literally do not care who wants to be called a Virginian as long as they live here. We have tons of culture all over this great state and taking away the right to vote from a taxpayer goes totally against our culture. Go clutch your pearls over being called a Virginian while the rest of this purple state gets better and better.
Virginia,fegfa8u,t3_ep0cs9,1579090791.0,"No, what dumb, gatekeeping BS. If you live within the state borders you are a Virginian. You pay taxes, commute on our roads and contribute to the economy and should be able to participate in our elections. What is magical about an arbitrary stretch of time that makes someone a true Virginian? Everyone gets mad at the cities and college towns at election time but still seems to love that tax income that is spread all over the state."
