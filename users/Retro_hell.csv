The truck cost me 10k 
 
Part of my thing is that I'm parting out cars. I can do this without the truck it's a major pain in the ass.
 
Now let's take your advice. I don't take a loan and I buy the truck for 10k and that leaves me with $1,000 to buy a trailer and a parts car.
 
The parts car will probably make me about 500 bucks
 
Cute
 
Let's do what I do
  
Downpayment for the truck is 3k, and I make $300 payments for 36 months meaning I paid about another 3K in interest.
 
But a month one I spent $3,000 on a truck, $500 for a trailer, now I have $6,500 to play around and I can now go by that $2,000 car that has the $5,000 engine. Takes the same amount of time.
 
Within my first month I've already paid half of my interest. 
 
Things don't always go smoothly, if I were to spend $500 on a car that I did not make $500 on then I'm screwed for a month. But if I lose $2,000 from my $6,500, then I can still buy another car.

$20,000 for a roof is not $20,000, it's like 5,000$ in materials and 300$ in beer. 
 
Something similar with the truck, it will make me money because my car does already and I can fit more in a truck. Plus I can tow cars (another Hussle I deal with). If the truck loan is $500 a month (it won't be) Its still worth it. 
 
The house and the truck are not the same that you are thinking of, these are business decisions. I could pay for the truck in full but if it helps me build any little bit of credit for the house loan then that's more important than the actual cash."

The most likely way society will collapse (assuming we are referring to the US or some other first world nation) is going to be via slow progression causing Amazon to go out of business.
 
For example. 2020 election. One party wins and the other party thinks it's horseshit and this causes terror attacks. 
 
I'm going to pretend Trump wins for this senario. Understand I think both sides are capable of doing this. 
 
Remember when Texas was hit with that hurricane? Let's say it happens again.
 
And lets say another set of protests, bigger than Ferguson happen in San Antonio. Some Mexican kid was shot by a white cop. The details suggest that the kid might be breaking the law, but not enough to justify getting shot and killed.
 
San Antonio now has a smaller police force due to floods in Dallas. And now their own city has people marching in the streets. Some people start looting stores. 
 
So in Dallas you get some racist dicks driving around in pickup trucks saying they are going to shoot strangers in their neighborhoods to prevent looting, what they really mean is brown people. Btw this happened during Harvey. What happened was the locals pick up their own guns and drove the pricks out of town. But in our scenario let's say it got bloody
 

Casuseing some racist assholes in San Antonio  hopping in the back of a pickup truck and shooting at the protesters (some of which are looting as there will always be opportunistic assholes).
 
Now these protesters who are predominantly Mexican get mad. Some shoot back. in the local police force does not have the manpower to deal with it because of the flooding in Dallas.
  
outside of San Antonio there is a random fucking town that nobody really gives a shit about. Local police chief seas of this and starts implementing extremely racist policies. None of them are constitutional. He deputizes a couple of buddies and allows them to search and seize property for any reason whatsoever. Namely the Mexicans in town. 
 
It makes national news, trump says it's all good, Republican governor says it's all good. And MAGA supporters sat the Mexicans get what's coming to them and scream about building a wall.
 
And this all happens in the span of say  a month.
  
So then you get some mainly Mexicans core pissed off that this is currently happening in their town. You get a prominent one who in this case is connected to one of the drug cartels. He has the money, firepower, and manpower to take out the deputies of the small town. 
 
So he does loudly and violently. local police chiefs had is now on a stick couple that deputies are now hanging on highway signs with a noose around their neck. 
 
And so begins the second US civil war.
 
Fast forward 6 months, and now you have people planting IEDs on the side of roads so the national guard cant transport goods. 
 
this becomes prominent enough where it starts becoming a problem for Amazon to deliver a fucking package because they keep losing truck drivers. The roads are now filled with potholes caused by blasts. 
 
Amazon Prime's 2 day shipping no longer becomes available because they can no longer guarantee that.
 
They're not only losing their workforce due to roadside bombs. But also because they just don't want to work there. Some people move out of country, others choose to serve their country in the event of a civil war, and some decide that they want to place IEDs on the side of the road.
 
The Amazon warehouses will slowly dwindle in stock is Amazon now has to continue to raise prices as fuel prices are going up. And it just generally becomes more expensive to run their business.
 
a year in Amazon starts going to shareholders singing that they can no longer pay their bills, the stock prices plummet. Friendly reminder, Amazon never turns a profit. I need money that they make if they immediately spend an expanding their business. This works when their company grows. But when people just are not buying that becomes an issue.
 
Total societal collapse would not happen in a matter of weeks. It would probably take at least 6 months if you are fast tracking it."

Factory farming definitely is a toll on our ecology and our world. 

We also have great deals of invasive species that can cause harm to our current ecology.

Basically terrorists/activists/ freedom fighters.
 
For example, let's say one person is responsible for destroying an entire Syrian army base being used to hold weapons used against civilians, would they be considered a terrorist? Would it matter if they're Kurdish or ISIS?
 
Are you comfortable playing God with information? Do you have any journalistic background to know the difference on good information and bad information on people?"

As many others stated, this is a bad idea.  
 
This would be a step towards blocking all information from a party that you do not agree with. Which would further your spiral into more extremist views. Which can cause more shootings.

ISIS uses drones to blow up US Humvees, like the ones you see at Best buy.
 
Hell, improvised drones are common is warfare. It's even in the new Call of duty modern warfare.

This may be a way to register drones as the government may be worried about local groups useing them in US borders. Unregistered drone may be like owning an unregistered gun eventually."

politics,fc2lfys,t1_fc1sj4g,1577365929.0,"Andrew Johnson was impeached because Republicans straight up did not like him. In their defence, he was getting in the way with making recently freed slaves into citizens.
 
They made a law and 5 days later he was impeached for it. Mind you this had nothing to do with the recently freed slaves. They just created a law to impeach him with.
 
The threshold for Andrew Johnson is far less than Donald Trump.
 
Donald Trump had an FBI investigation that was brought up into the impeachment, and although the investigation did not provide enough evidence for impeachment, it got multiple people arrested and started hundreds of other investigations. This showed the kind of person Trump is and set a precedent.
 
So when the Ukraine investigation started, enough evidence was brought in to impeach him. The FBI investigation just supported the facts behind Ukraine.
 
We're talking about something that took the course of over at least 2 years
Not 5 days."
