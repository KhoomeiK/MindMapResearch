Intuitively you'd believe they avoid flashing lights, but people, especially inexperienced will look towards the flashing lights and get closer. 

Its also based on my anecdotal experience as a driving instructor in Norway. I litterarily spend half of the year driving in the dark surronded by bicyclists (little to no sun in the winter here). Flashing lights are great if you want them to realize where you are and, how fast you are going late. And want them to get really really close. 

Flashing lights is great if you are stationary, don't mind to get hit, and your main goal is to draw attention (like on a firetruck or a construction site). As any emergency personell will tell you, flashing lights does not stop people from hitting you, at all. 

Try to pay attention in the dark while driving, look how hard it is to judge distance to flashing bike lights. 

If flashing lights were somehow safer we'd have flashing lights on mopeds and motorcycles. Clearly they are not, so we don't."

I think you are underestimating how much the convenience and low barrier of entry will have to say. Sure everyone wont be sold at once, but people will use them as a second car first, and then as a temporary car while shopping for a new one, and then just never get around to buying a new car.

2. Im going in this direction    
3. Im this far away

With construction sones you just want to communicate two things:   
1. Slow the fuck down   
2. Pay attention to construction crew

Why don't they put blinking lights on the construction crew? Because they need to convey different things. If someone runs over the construction site sing? Nobody cares, insurance buys a new one. 

The ambulances have many things they want to convey and its an emergency, the shit allready hit the fan when they use blinking lights. They want people to get out of the way. When they use their lights people slow down, people don't slow down because you have disco lights on your bicycle. They stare at you, get closer and misjudge your speed. 

I spend five days a week in a car with inexperienced drivers. I see how horribly counterproductive these lights are. They fixate on the light and drift towards it, and they reliably misjudge the distance and speed of the bicycles. Sure, if make your bicycle look like an Usher concert you will be noticed, but people won't understand what you are, and if they do it will be slower.

A close relative works for the government, his job is to inspect cars. He has to use a blinking paddle to stop cars because some moron politician thought it was a good idea. He says it is hopeless, as he can't direct the cars where he wants them. With a solid light he's much safer and can show cars where to go.

Orange lights to warn you to slow down is different, they don't require you to gauge distance at all. I see hazards? I start slowing down to a safe speed to approach an accident (unless I see whats going on). 

The ABS lights aren't an issue in the same way. As the car behind you, naturally will be directly behind you. As a bicyclist you don't need the car right behind you. ABS lights also has the advantage that if the person behind you understand what they are, they will also brake hard. And if they don't the target fixation isn't an issue. 

Emergency veichles has a considerably different need to be seen than bicyclists and they will generally be going faster than traffic.

None of your examples is as problematic as blinking bicycle lights, and the wast majority is used for emergencies and unforseen situations, not just for normal traffic.

I guesss the worst is lack of standardisation. There is so many different lights and combinations of lights and it makes it terribly hard for new motorists to quickly understand whats going on.

cycling,fcne4zo,t1_fcnd1f3,1577809817.0,"This is not the reason at all. Blinking lights is dangerous, it makes drivers fixate on the blinking and makes them come closer. It also makes it way harder to judge distance. 

If blinking lights was beneficial we'd have blinking lights on cars, moped, motorcycles. but they obviously aren't.

So to summarise. Blinking lights reduce safety and therfore is banned in several jurisdictions."
cycling,fcndy8z,t3_ei3zm9,1577809698.0,"I never use blink mode. Using blink mode is banned in sensible countries (Germany and the Netherlands for instance). 

Unexperienced drivers will come closer to you because of target fixation, judging distance to a blinking light is significantly harder, and if you have blinkers on in front you have less visibility. 

I wish Norway would put a firm ban on blinking bike lights (now the rules is it has to blink 120 times per minute, but everyone ignores that and its hopeless to enforce). 

I am upgrading all my lights to SvTZO-approved lights (german standard). I am so sick of cycling through the useless and outright dangerous blinking lights to turn the lights on and off."

cycling,fch8ql3,t3_eh6ztr,1577648301.0,"I got my bike stolen (a fatbike) from outside my house. My wife came up one morning and said my bike was gone, I was like: ""No, that can't be, it was locked"". It had a cheap wire lock (Trelock) that was cut. Luckily I found the bicycle stashed around the block (assuming they would pick it up later) the next day.

After that I bought a bunch of locks, a couple of kryptonites, hiplock, trelocks chainlock, an abus chain and a padlock. So for the first few weeks I had my bicycle locked down with 15 kilos of extra locks... That proved to be impractical.

Now I have inusrance and use one chain lock. The insurance covers the bike with equipment and the lock is far harder to cut than a cable lock.

I would recommend Kryptonite Evolution 4 or Trelocks chainlock. The trelock one is best for ice, but the Kryptonite is beefier. 

There is also GPS trackers you can place on or in the bike, that might be worth looking into. I figured insurance would be more convenient and my bike isn't too special (no like nostaliga attached to it). 

All bike locks are breakable, but you want to have the best lock around the block. If you have a Evolution 4 and the one next to you have something useless like an ottolock then the thiefs will likely leave yours alone. 

But a bike left alone for long periods can and will get stolen. Be carefull where you leave it."

For the price of a new 125cc like the z125 or mt125 plus some change I could get the zx12r. I don't believe for a second the likeliness to get injured is the same on those. Especially for an inexperienced rider.

I'd much much rather be hit by a Honda Grom than a heavier faster motorbike. Being hit by a bicycle or a motorcycle, even at the same speed, is massively different. 

If the rider is an adult, that is around 25, I think they should be able to ride whatever they want, they have the common sense to practice. But for a 16 year old? No way I want them riding around on something that does 340kmh."

If we increased the mandatory training or the level to pass the test it would quickly start to become unaffordable. You are easily paying $2-3000 dollars for a drivers licence in Norway.  

And like, why is being younger a goal? The highest speed limit in my county is 90 km/h. I can do that on a Honda Grom. Im something like 800-1000 km away from a higher speed limit in Norway (I can find higher in sweden or finland closer tho).

motorcycles,fcbpun9,t1_fc9e1ao,1577589645.0,"I teach driving cars in Norway. The difference in risk understanding from 16 to 18 to 25 is MASSIVE. A 16 year old is a massive twat in traffic (luckily motorcycle course have a special segment called ""driving in traffic"" for those taking the 125cc). 

Some 18 year olds understand risk somewhat, but they are not good at it.

Most 25 year olds intutively understands the dangers of manuvering a 1.5 tonn projectile amongst pedestrians.

I have had 18 year olds argue with me, that slowing down because a child is balancing on the edge of the sidewalk was unacceptable because it would ""impede"" traffic... You don't get that with 25 year olds. 

It is amazing to see the differences, I now understand the insurance companies."
motorcycles,fcbp8fe,t1_fcaxqll,1577589451.0,"In Norway the driving training goes like so:
* Step 1 - mandatory 17x 45 minute course for all motorists (cut to 7 if over 25)
* Step 2 - Theoretical motorcycle course, learning to control the motorcycle (done in low traffic areas, not on track)
* Step 3 - Here you have a track session to complete the track part, and you have to master driving in traffic on a level that is passable for the test.
* Step 4 - Dangers of highway driving, you drive for a several hour trip on roads to learn about the dangers of riding, and there is some theoretical part here

The instructor can sit on the bike with you (they have their own brake and clutch), which is common in the beginning (step 2 after learning basic balancing and start stop) and step 3 with the exception of the track. Only for the later parts its common that they follow on their own bike.

You need to pass a theoretical test, and then a driving test. Which is 30 minutes on the track (daily control (brakes lights oil tires) security control questions and rididng on track)) and thirty minuttes in trafic. If you fail the track part you wont be allowed on the road. 

Instructors in Norway aren't employed by the government, and it is US who is supposed to hold the student back if they lack the skills. Step four is about risk and such and cant be judged during a test, we have a duty to reject reckless students. 

All the training happens on normal bikes. Like our school uses MT125, some Honda 125, Tracer 700 limited to 35kw, and Tracer 700. Also a tracer 900 for a follower bike."
