BmwTech,ff7hjvu,t1_ff7gslv,1579649703.0,"That sucks since it'll probably going to cost you at least that to fix the car yourself. Just visually to get back to ""new"" you need: probably bumper and hood, definitely kidney grill, probably a new radiator, plus paint, labor, etc.. 

&#x200B;

Man it'd be way better for you to find the deductible than try and fix this yourself. if you do so, you're fighting the city to recoup instead of having your insurance company do so, which is basically what you pay them for in these instances."
BmwTech,ff7gqru,t3_es2fak,1579649167.0,"Soo.. since it's a city vehicle this should be relatively easy for your insurance to recoup costs. Why haven't you simply had your insurance take care of repairs? It'll cost you your deductible until the city plays ball with your ins company and they pay you out for the deductible when they recoup costs from the city. It's probably your fastest and cheapest fix without some DIY, which sounds tough since it's 1, your first car and 2, you can't even get the hood open."

What will actually happen is you'll probably end up upside down on the loan by quite a bit and then, such is the game with high mileage cars, the repairs are gonna start building and building. And then you'll just want to get rid of it and end up taking a bigger loss.

Listen to the guy who suggested the Fiesta ST if you really want something newer. Or if you're really smart, you'll drive the Sentra into the ground while saving up for a car that's not gonna shit itself 25k miles after buying it."
