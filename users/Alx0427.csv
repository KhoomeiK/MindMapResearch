A) He was doing actions, and pursuing plans, and executing plans, against the interests of the US, and resulting in the death of US personnel

B) It’s true we aren’t at war with Iran, but they are an enemy of the United States. No doubt about that. Both countries routinely swap attacks, especially cyber and financial attacks, against one another

C) he was operating to bolster that enemy in a general sense, and successfully pursuing that enemies interests
