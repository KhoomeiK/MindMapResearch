vegan,feleal8,t3_epm7e2,1579220148.0,Made me laugh !!!

glossier,fef903v,t3_eoof7z,1579051020.0,Oh my goodness! She’s beautiful
Anxiety,fdcbfse,t1_fdc91bs,1578270932.0,That’s good to know. Thank you!
Anxiety,fdc9nm4,t1_fd7fd6f,1578269848.0,"Thank you for your response! I’m so happy it’s working well for you. Apart from preventing panic attacks, do you feel calmer overall? I always seem to feel on edge."
Anxiety,fdc9h37,t1_fd7dfk4,1578269744.0,I didn’t realize it could be taken in addition to an SSRI. I hope you find something that helps!
Anxiety,fdc9ari,t1_fd6p71p,1578269641.0,"Thank you for your response! I know a couple of people who have had success with Zoloft. But it won’t kick in for a while so hang in there! Also, if this is your first SSRI, be aware that they can cause an initial worsening of anxiety/depression symptoms. Hope it works for you!"
Anxiety,fdc94gl,t1_fd64oul,1578269534.0,"Thank you so much. I’m happy it’s working well for you! I believe I’m starting with 10 mg, twice per day. Sertraline was a no for me too: much too emotionally numbing."
Anxiety,fdc8w05,t1_fd63wzq,1578269398.0,What kind of side effects did you have? Dizziness?
cats,fd61tdb,t3_ek4q54,1578184363.0,Stunning

cats,fd61fpe,t3_ek2q6q,1578184206.0,What!!! Why is she laying like that? Sooo adorable.
cats,fd611v7,t3_ek0snc,1578184039.0,He looks chill
Anxiety,fd6084x,t1_fd5ws6x,1578183732.0,"Thank you! 

So far, benzos have been the only thing to really work well for me, which sucks since they can only be taken once in a while. But I’m hopeful."
Anxiety,fd5r0gm,t3_ek0xmy,1578180514.0,"Yes, the same dose of alprazolam works for me. But please be careful with the benzodiazepine drugs. They are only for once in a while. Taking them regularly, even for a only a week in some cases, can cause physical withdrawal symptoms."
Anxiety,fd5qk1l,t3_ek43wz,1578180362.0,"I’m so happy Zoloft is working well for you!! 

These meds definitely affect everyone differently. I felt much too emotionally numb on Zoloft (much more so than escitalopram and fluoxetine); anyone else?"
Anxiety,fd5q5lj,t3_ek2btt,1578180225.0,I feel your pain. I had these when I went on Zoloft/sertraline when I was 15.

veganmealprep,fcadnd0,t3_egqhf1,1577567451.0,"Frozen riced cauliflower is good to add for extra veggies that you can’t really taste, when blended with fruits! Also love adding hemp seeds, chia seeds, ground ginger, and non-dairy yogurt. Other than that whatever fruits and veggies you like! To get a nice brightly colored smoothie do fruits and veg that are the same color (e.g. peaches + carrots, greens + kiwi, beets + strawberry). Oat milk is great to make it creamy! If you do add greens like kale, spinach, etc. I recommend adding a splash of orange or lemon juice to cut the bitterness."
