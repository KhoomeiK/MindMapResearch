offmychest,fehq0yu,t1_fehpr0g,1579121583.0,It’s just a silly post to give some people a chuckle. Lighten up buddy!
offmychest,feh2l2q,t1_feh25j3,1579107829.0,"lol I agree. But that's the first thing all my friends say when I complain about there not being any restaurants that deliver to me, ""but your dad owns a delivery place!"""
filmstudies,fe0e1yw,t1_fdxljlc,1578811458.0,"I'm just gonna echo this and build off /u/MeganT812's post.

The historical and cultural context in which the film was made is pretty often critical to understanding or fully appreciating it. This ""extratextual"" information; it exists outside the ""text"", the ""text"" being the body of work. In this case, that ""text/body of work"" is a movie. Movies don't start out with a Star Wars style scrawl explaining the politics, history, or cultural norms of the time movie was made. This is information you have to go seek out yourself.

The Wonder Woman example /u/MeganT812 brought up is really great. Superhero movies have been getting a lot of flack recently as being sort of ""lesser"" cinema. Even if you agree and hate superhero movies, just look at the extratextual information /u/MeganT812 talked about. All of it exists outside the movie itself, but it is still important and relevant to the movie. Knowing about all those things happening when the movie came out - #MeToo, the Women's March, Trump's Access Hollywood tape - gives you a much different understanding of the movie and why it resonated so intensely with audiences at the time. Without all that knowledge, someone watching Wonder Woman far off in the future might find it a totally boring superhero movie and not understand why people made such a fuss about it back in the day.

Another quick example is Star Wars. If a kid today watches the original Star Wars movies, they might not understand why it's such a big deal. To a modern kid, the special effects might seem totally hoaky and super lame. But at the time Star Wars was made, they were incredible, and they totally blew people away. The VFX were a huge part of what cemented Star Wars into popular culture. Analysing film using extratextual information gives you the ability to sort of put yourself in the shoes of an audience member in 1977 having their mind blown seeing a light saber for the first time.

No movie exists in a vacuum. The time, the place, the technology, and the people who made it...all of those external factors influence the movie. Being aware of all this extratextual information will wildly improve your ability to analyze movies. 

Your prof might cover some of this before/after watching an assigned film in class, but its also something you can definitely do yourself if you're wanting to practice on your own. The wikipedia page for the movie is a really great place to start."

pokemon,fd3gald,t3_ehjsjn,1578158061.0,"**How do I get a second Zacian to give to my little sister?**

My sister and I don't know much about the main line Pokemon video games. We mostly play Pokemon Go and haven't played any Pokemon games since Gameboy. I bought Sword when it came out, and my sister just recently got a Switch and got Shield so we could trade exclusives. We didn't know about surprise trading because it wasn't a thing when we played in the 90s/early aughts. Once we discovered that, we were each able to get most of the exclusives without even trading with each other...

If I hadn't gotten Sword first, I know she would have gotten it instead of Shield to get Zacian instead of Zamazenta. She won't admit it because she doesn't want me to feel bad for getting it first, but at that point she still didn't have a Switch, so I hadn't even taken which one she'd like better into consideration.

I know she won't accept my Zacian if I tried to trade it to her. Since we can't breed them, is there ANY way to get a second Zacian so I can give it to my little sister?

edit: spelling"
