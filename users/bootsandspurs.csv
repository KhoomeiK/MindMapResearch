AskMen,ffc75k4,t3_esruuu,1579793095.0,My husband doesn't wear his super often. We have a ranch so he works with his hands and on heavy machinery daily. He will wear one of his silicone rings a few times a week and his actual wedding band when we go to town. I stay home with our kids and only wear my ring when we go to town.
toddlers,ffc5vtb,t3_essyea,1579792256.0,When my 18 month old has a tantrum I try to remind myself that he doesn't have the verbal skills to communicate what the problem is and how frustrating that must be for him. Also as adults we have trouble controlling our emotions at times and to expect kids to always behave and be in control of their feelings and emotions is unrealistic. Depending on location sometimes it is just best to walk away and let them get their frustrations out.
fatlogic,ff4oev0,t1_ff4kt0n,1579568553.0,"One of my favorite marinades is olive oil, lime juice, taco seasoning, onion, minced garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno. It works great for chicken or beef. I highly recommend looking at Pinterest for seasoning mixes. For chicken blackened or Cajun seasoning is always really good."
sewing,ff0lk0r,t3_eq1mfn,1579470014.0,It looks so cute! I love the idea of a cross back apron for kids.
toddlers,felpji7,t3_eppii1,1579227805.0,Being separated is so hard. I was in the hospital for four days after having baby #2 and being away from my 16 month old was hard. My husband and I tried FaceTime and he just cried as soon as he saw me. It is hard being away but the reunion is so sweet.
fatlogic,fel3gov,t1_fekab7i,1579213239.0,"What are you seasoning and what are you looking for? Do you want a certain cuisine style or just a basic seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder blend?"
xxfitness,fejoqzf,t1_fejkfxw,1579181870.0,I have been overweight my entire life. When I was out on HCG I wasn't playing sports but was in PE and weightlifting dealing with a knee injury. The HCG diet is a hormone shot followed by a 500 calorie diet for up to 8 weeks. It is ultra low calorie and low fat. It was popular in the 80's I think and had a resurgence around 2010.
xxfitness,fehwdg2,t3_ep0nu9,1579125183.0,I remember not eating as young as 11. I was playing two sports at the time and I would skip breakfast and lunch then eat maybe an apple between school and practice. When I was 14 my parents put me on the HCG diet. I did the shots and 500 calorie diet for a few months.
PanPorn,fec4ftk,t1_fec3gi5,1578966504.0,I have bought the singles before but I have a hard time justifying spending $60 on three eyeshadows.
PanPorn,fea7u2v,t3_eo76w7,1578945380.0,"Sin, Chopper, and Smog were my go to colors like 6 years ago. I loved it and I wish it was still around."
beyondthebump,fdwk8af,t3_en8hgm,1578759560.0,Congratulations! My boys are the same distance apart and it is tough. My youngest was born in the beginning of December so we are still all adjusting. My oldest is still very attached to me so making sure I give him enough attention is crucial but is difficult with a newborn. It will be hard at first but eventually it will get better.
sleeptrain,fdw1mbn,t3_en3grw,1578754142.0,My husband and I both are too short to be able to place our 1.5 year old flat in the crib if the mattress is all the way down. We ended up switching to our pack and play because we could actually lay him down.
beyondthebump,fdslxma,t3_emwa9r,1578704906.0,You can do it! If you haven't already done so check out r/loseit it is such a great community full of people at different stages of weightloss.
fatlogic,fdrvx4i,t1_fdrvakv,1578690546.0,"This is baby number 2 so I knew what to expect but it doesn't change the desire to eat anything and everything. The craving for sweets has been brutal especially with the holidays. 


Congratulations on your weight loss and the baby!"
fatlogic,fdrsymi,t3_ems7pb,1578689270.0,Rant. I gave birth beginning of December and am counting calories but the breastfeeding hunger and cravings are insane. I have a goal of losing 60 lbs this year these cravings are not helping.
Mommit,fdhs7j1,t1_fdhpi2y,1578429163.0,Do we have the same son? My 1.5 year old could go through a pint of blueberries in a day if I let him.
PanPorn,fdfd9y6,t3_ekuwih,1578358985.0,Lorac Pro 3 is my absolute favorite palette. The formula is so great.
AskReddit,fdcjw7f,t3_eke3wm,1578276725.0,10/10 with rice guy. A young guy buys a massive bag of rice and takes suggestions on what to pair it with. He then gives everything a rating out of 10 to if it is good or not.
fatlogic,fda3jzc,t1_fd7ii4b,1578241256.0,Midwesterner here. In my state our growing season is extremely small. Our first frost is October and the risk of frost ends in June. In order to be able to grow year around you would need space for a green house or a small grow tent.
AskWomen,fd2fjxs,t3_ejqvkp,1578146488.0,"My first baby was 0 due to having medical assistance. I had no complications. 


Baby #2 was born a month ago and so far my bill is $3,050.00. I had two epidurals, lost over 1600mL of blood, baby couldn't regulate his blood sugar and oxygen levels were low. He had a 3 day stay in the nursery with a chest x-ray, iv fluids and iv antibiotics. I ended up being discharged the day before him but boarded a hospital room for the night."
bigboobproblems,fcvur4y,t1_fcvpns2,1578010554.0,My oldest hated any carrier I tried with him. Looking up different wrap styles on YouTube may be your best bet in finding what works best for you and your little one.
bigboobproblems,fcue6le,t3_eiyfmh,1577978844.0,I prefer a wrap carrier vs a structured carrier. I am currently a US I cup and I am able to carry my one month old comfortably. There are downsides to a wrap such as it loosens overtime and also wrapping and unwrapping can be time consuming.
AskWomen,fcu48sx,t3_eipmd1,1577972162.0,To make faster instant oatmeal packets use 4oz of hot water from your Keurig. If you like thicker oatmeal microwave for 30 seconds after. I have a 1 year old who loves oatmeal and this hack has saved me many times. You also don't have to worry about the sticky overflow that you get from microwaving it.

AskMen,fbqqh56,t1_fbqjefb,1577034343.0,Congratulations on your degree! A lot of people never get that far (myself included) so I am proud of you for your accomplishment!
