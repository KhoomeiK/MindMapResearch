AustralianCattleDog,ff4ip6g,t1_ff49bq9,1579564558.0,"Thanks so much. We also train daily with the zac george videos as well. I'll look Kikopup up....I'm sure I've seen the videos but we will look again and see what can do. 
I didnt like his comment about the pinch either at such a young age. Didnt feel right. Thanks! 

I have another question for you or anyone for that matter who wants to comment. My boyfriend chuckles and makes comments at us when we redirect Leah while shes nipping at our pants or heels. How do I explain the importance of redirecting? He doesn't think it's working at all. His way is to yell at her to stop. As soon as he puts his feet on the floor she instantly stops the bad behavior and does something else. We try to praise right away when she quits but I dont believe we need to yell at her to stop. It's not going to teach redirection in my opinion. Follow? 
I have so many thoughts on this that I can barely keep myself straight. I understand the importance but as soon as she starts on one of my shoes, pants etc he pipes in with, ""redirecting is working well I see"". Abbigale, Leah's person is getting frustrated because she can see he's making headway with her and we arent. I dont want abbigale growing up thinking she needs to yell at the dog to get her to listen....not learn....listen. When Leah starts nipping at abbigales heels (I tell her to stand like a tree just like I do...I've had to step in now in front of abbigale so Leah knows when abby does the same she needs to listen and sit) she will tire out and quit within 30 seconds. She knows shes not going to go anywhere or do anything but Abbigale is starting to look to dad for support....he does his thing....she stops. 
I'm getting frustrated myself obviously. I know it's important we all get on the same page but he's not going to budge. Period. He already told us that. He will do training his way we do it ours. I dont want abbigale growing up thinking this is how you train. I want her to do it the right way with treats and positivity. Told her it's not easy and not something that happens over night but it take patience and love. That's all we can do. Dont get me wrong. He is not abusive to her at all. He's normally calmer and more controlled then I am even. He is the most lovable person I know. I'm an awful person compared to him. NORMALLY. Hehehe He truly loves the little runt. He just has that Dad voice....maybe I'm just not used to his DAD voice either. Have you ever heard if they respond better to men verses women? 
Again, I apologize for being all over the board on this. Running out of ideas to get us all back on track....ya know?. My Mind is falling a part is all. 
Thanks!"
AustralianCattleDog,ff24y8y,t1_ff1xk7m,1579493934.0,Did your pup hate using it? What age did you start using it?
AustralianCattleDog,ff147uw,t3_eqr733,1579475072.0,"Mine does this when she gets startled or scared. She tries to climb up behind my neck. Funny. 
Such a cute boy!"
AustralianCattleDog,ff13q95,t1_ff0re8g,1579474897.0,"Thanks, I'll stick to it then. I'm sure it's going to take time. Not something that's going to happen over night."
puppy101,felgrkb,t3_epjpui,1579221800.0,"Our ACD gets over tired and we need to put her in bed. After a nap shes a totally different pup. Not an a hole anymore. : ) we used to put Leah in time outs until we noticed one day she fell asleep within that minute of being in timeout. When she woke up she was a much better listener again and no agressive growling/snapping. They get tired and crabby too just like us.  : )
I also had two beagles. They are stubborn dogs by nature keep that in mind too. Very good while your looking but turn your back for a second and there goes your favorite rug. Hehehehhe
Good luck! Sounds like an adolescent pup is all : )"

Sorry, no title suggestion. All I can think of are titles about reflections and being in touch with your inner self."

AustralianCattleDog,fdrpw6j,t3_emqcwh,1578687947.0,Our cat loki smacks our heeler around. Leah was told at puppy kindergarten last week that she plays like a cat. She was batting her paws at all the other puppies.
AustralianCattleDog,fdj5q4l,t1_fdguqu7,1578459185.0,What do you mean by ear situation? Still very new to puppies and dogs in general really. I want to apologize now for my ignorance and or gullibility.
AustralianCattleDog,fdj568m,t1_fdg0n1v,1578458744.0,I like Diego : ) cute idea
AustralianCattleDog,fdfyzoa,t3_el4vmu,1578374227.0,"Our little girl is the exact same. I was going insane thinking we had a uniquely naughty, nippy, moody puppy. Totally not the case. What I found was they are all the same but i hear it is 100% worth it. Best friend you will ever have in your entire life. 

We brought our little Leah home Christmas day for our daughter mind you and we start puppy kindergarten tomorrow. YEAH. We can hardly wait. I'll try to remmeber to let you you if it makes a difference. 

The three thing that have worked the best FOR US so far are:
1. Time out every time she nips to hard, growls, snarls,  yells at you about anything. 30 seconds away from you at least. Dont look at them dont have  toys or anything positive in the time out spot with them. I believe mine is up to a minute or so before she starts calming down and not whining at the same time. If she starts up again and IF she won't let me redirect her or encourage her to leave it with dog food/treats/toys then we put her down for a little longer then a minute and see if she falls asleep. She usually is sleeping before two miutes. Just a tired, crabby puppy who needed a nap. 
2. We upped our treat game today to chicken chunks. You would have thought she had a twin. We had her listening really good today and I mean listening to ALL 5 of us. She was playing with the frisbee outside and not nipping at our legs or barking at us when we grab the frisbee from her. She even ignored the cat when asked. 
I hope to just keep on it and stay positive that these methods are going to work. Shes a puppy same as a baby. You have to teach them everything. Oh, and I make her calm down before she ever takes anything out of people's hands. We also still hand feed her so she doesn't eat too fast etc. 
How does your puppy do for potty training at 10 weeks? Ours is ok here and there. Almost had a mess free day and at the end of the night she was all over the living room. She is leashed but we left her alone while we were eating. We figured more tantrums from the tired, crabby puppy.
I'll keep ya posted about puppy kindergarten and if it makes a difference. It's a 5 week course. 
Looking forward to everyone's comments and suggestions on here. Everyone gives such great advise in this subreddit group."

Dogtraining,fdfsdnl,t3_ektmsu,1578369019.0,Our place requires a flea pill every time we bring her to puppy daycare or lodging. I think it  seporates their business from the rest. Of course there are many other reasons but that was one that stood out to me. : )
AustralianCattleDog,fd5oymc,t3_ejocys,1578179837.0,What a beautiful pup! Just an FYI- that playpen is climbable. I recommend the cover.  : ) my 10 week old pushes hers all over the house and climbed out twice before I realized they make covers for the playpens.

blueheelers,fcjj8a9,t1_fcig0s5,1577689722.0,"Yes, this is great advise. I also do this. She does love it. Well, mine does. Also, a great time to brush teeth and intoduce the clippers or grinder. Only time my fingers dont get nibbled on. : )"

AustralianCattleDog,fcie4cg,t1_fci5x4u,1577661180.0,Hehehe that they do. : )
AustralianCattleDog,fcac012,t3_eenuze,1577566463.0,"My Abbigale absolutely loves little Leah. Thank you all for the noteworthy info, words of encouragement and advice. Leah is VERY mouthy but such a sweetie at the same time. Believe this if you want but the only one in the house who she hasn't nipped, herded or snarled at yet is our 4yr old.  Leah is soooooo loved already. 
The only suggestion I would have at this point (day 4)  would be don't get a puppy play pen for hard wood floors. She figured out in one minute that she can pick it up with her nose and move it anywhere she wants. She cant drag it completely through the living room carpet yet but I'm sure it wont be long.  Still works for puppy time out because she isn't getting attention from us when shes in it but the thought of her pushing it around the house never crossed my mind when I purchased it. The buggers didnt have any comments on amazon about that happening either."
AustralianCattleDog,fbxxeht,t1_fbvmjx4,1577202977.0,That's funny. Must have been chased by an angry buck in a past life. Hehehe
