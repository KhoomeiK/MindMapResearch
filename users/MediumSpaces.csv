socialskills,ff9y9wz,t3_es7zst,1579724106.0,"Hey, as a woman, I notice grooming way before I notice conventional attractiveness. 

Here are some things that will help: 

Eat well! Eat good, healthy, unprocessed foods. Health automatically adds to your attraction. It'll improve your skin, eyes, how you feel, everything. 

Drink plenty of water! This is good for your skin and appearance.

Work out! You don't have to go super-muscles, you don't even have to necessarily work out in order to lose weight. Working out is going to improve your over-all appearance (including skin, nice skin is attractive), your mood, and your abilities to move around and be active in your life.

I second the person who posted about clothing. It doesn't have to be a expensive either! Take a friend to the thrift shop with you and try on some clothes. Clothes that fit right and work with your body shape will automatically add to your attraction. It doesn't have to be fancy, but even blue jeans and t-shirts look nicer when they fit correctly.

Start a skin and hair care routine, you woukd be shocked at how much of a difference it's going to make. Use as good as you can afford!

 Use products that work with your skin and hair type, if you have greasy skin use cleansers and lotions that are light and non-greasy. If you have thick,  coarse, dry hair, use a leave in hair oil after you shower. Try face and hair masks. 

Shower every day, wash your face in the morning and night, wear clean clothing and deodorant, use a body powder if you're overweight, wear scent (not too much). Stinky isn't cute no matter how kind genetics has been.

Get a flattering hair cut! Keep your facial hair (including eyebrows) trimmed and shaped.

Pay attention to your nails!! You don't have to paint then or anything, but keep them trimmed and filed (if you can afford it, go treat yourself to a manicure).

In the same vein as the nails, pay attention to your feet! If they look like you could snatch your food out of a river, get them taken care of! Trim and file your nails, moisturize them!

You can go from a dude with greasy flat hair, bad skin, crazy eyebrows, wearing ill-fitting sweatpants and sock with sandals to a nicely dressed gentleman with great skin in just a few months!

It's going to take 6 weeks-6 months to really see the differences when you change your diet and skin care routine. 

But look, genetics can do whatever it wants, nobody looks good when they don't take care of themselves."

Parenting,ff9ujjj,t3_es5yh9,1579721681.0,"Look dude, I work with kids and I have worked with many, many failure to thrive. 

""I honestly don't know where we went wrong""

You didn't. At all. You know why? Because at 2 MONTHS old it's been identified and you are taking steps to find out what you can do to help compensate.

I have worked with 16 year olds who were failure to thrive and weren't seen by a doctor until 4 years old. 

I'm not going to lie and say everything will be ok, but I will tell you this: 

*no matter what happens, no matter what the result turns out to be, your son's outcome is going to be far, far better because they have parents who care*

You are doing everything you can by getting them to specialists. You haven't done anything wrong, genetics and development is a crapshoot. 

My oldest (13f)  was borderline failure to thrive at 4% at one year. Today she is 5'9"", just got recommended for Advanced English, and is so amazing my heart bursts whenever we spent time together. 

She still has some fine and gross motor issues (she drops things a lot, falls sometimes, and her handwriting is terrible), she has some slight issues with emotional flooding and some impulse control issues during emotional flooding. 

But these are all things she is fully capable of managing, and has actually learned coping skills to manage them about as well as any teenager can.

What I'm saying is this: you didn't do anything wrong, these things happen. You are actively supporting your son. And with that support, his outcome is going to be better."

BUT, and this is really important:

If he's incontinent so often that you're doing laundry every day and there are more than 4-5 pairs of boxers in that period of time, he needs to consider a condom cath or briefs.

Laundry aside, this is seriously hindering his abilities to be mobile and social, which is impacting his mental health (as displayed by him leaving the boxers laying around and refusing,to compromise).

He cannot get a job, go out with friends, or go to certain areas (like the beach) if he is not continent. 

The fact that leaving the urine-soaked clothing on the floor is something that even happens with an adult (disabled or not), is really concerning. I would recommend speaking to a doctor about a condom cath, and have him speak to a therapist.

AskDocs,fdrsuup,t3_emp47l,1578689207.0,"I have pretty bad tinnitus because I worked on a shotgun range when I was a kid. It's pretty bad. I turn on a small fan near my head at night, and that white noise really helps!

Also, maybe if you have some extra cash, look into silk pajamas and maybe sheets. They might help with the itching because they feel cool and smooth to the touch.

As for the breathing issues, see if your doctor can refer you for a sleep study. Something like a CPAP or BPAP machine might help, the specialists who do the sleep study would be able to help with that.

And lastly, I agree with some of the other posts regarding your anxiety. Nothing messes with my sleep schedule more than when my anxiety amps up. Maybe see about speaking to a therapist, they'll be able to help you manage stress and anxiety,  which will definitely help your sleep."

Parenting,fdom1lv,t3_emcsbm,1578607889.0,"It is definitely ok to tell the teacher!! Kids with autism can have a very difficult time understanding empathy. It is pretty common, especially for kids that young, to not understand that people can feel differently than them.

So he might honestly feel that because *he* wants to hug your daughter, that your daughter must want to hug him back.

Maybe explain that to your daughter, tell her of course that isn't an excuse, and he does need to stop if she doesn't want hugs. But that because it's an extenuating circumstance, she needs a little help. 

Take her with you to see the teacher. That will help her learn how to appropriately seek assistance."

AskDocs,fdc1k69,t3_ekbvc1,1578265308.0,"NAD, but I work in psych. No diagnosis is perfect,   nobody fits each diagnosis perfectly, and everybody has something that is outside of the diagnostic criteria for an illness.

Stop focusing on you label, you're deflecting. Focus on your treatment and recovery. I'm bipolar 2 and I don't respond well to antipsychotics, antidepressants, OR most mood stabilizers because of some medical conditions that I have. I get horrific side effects.

I don't focus on ""but I can't be bipolar because my manic episodes rapid cycle and most medications make me less functional.""

 I focus on what makes me functional and stabilizes me, which is a combination of high concentration CBD isolate, DBT therapy, a very low dose of a mood stabilizer, and a rigid sleep and exercise schedule combined with a strict diet. 

If I perseverated on my diagnoses, spent time arguing, disagreeing, and self-diagnosing, then I would have missed out on being the most functional I have ever been.

No, my symptoms do not match up that closely to my diagnosis. No, traditional treatments did not work. Yes, I suspect that my diagnosis might have either changed, or not be entirely correct.

Does it matter?

No. It absolutely doesn't matter at all. 

Something is neurodivergent, something is not typical with my brain chemistry and how I perceive the world. 

A diagnosis is merely a starting point for treatment, not a definition."
