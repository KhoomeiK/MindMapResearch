AskADoctor,feh2bg8,t3_ep0009,1579107667.0,"Localized means just in that one area. Usually a comment like that is made more as an observation, the clinician noticed this one lymph node enlarged and included the size. If you‚Äôre not sick then it‚Äôs something to keep a watch of (perhaps that one lymph node is fighting an infection-doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad). 

If you had bilateral swelling or multiple nodes along the chain swollen that could be indicative of a more serious illness. Flu/cold what not.

If after a matter of time (month to several months) you feel that node is getting bigger it would be worth to get a fine needle aspiration to test out the cells to see what‚Äôs going on. (This is where they inject a small needle into your lymph node to get a tissue sample and send it off to the lab). 

Doesn‚Äôt sound like something serious if you are otherwise healthy and labs are all within normal limits."

AmItheAsshole,fefa454,t3_eoley4,1579051760.0,"YTA. This is just a dress to her. This is THE DRESS. THE DRESS she has probably been thinking about and dreaming about for 27 years. She has worked her ass off and be able to buy the dress that she wants to wear to walk down the aisle in to marry you and you are throwing a fit like that?! I get budget and being spend conscious. Truly I do. My budget has a limit for my wedding. And in wedding speak, $1000 is not that bad actually for a wedding dress. This will be THE DRESS that will forever be in your wedding pictures for the rest of your life. So yes the dress might only be worn once but it will be seen hundreds of times as you both share it with friends and family and as you review your wedding pics yourself. To her it‚Äôs $1000 to capture the way she wants to present herself to the world as your new bride. That‚Äôs not a discounted cheap off the rack thing... especially if she has already found a dress. 

You remember this conversation in a few years when you want a really expensive big ass tv for several grand or when you want to get a boat or gun or whatever your toys are... let her tell you to go cheap and see how well that works out for you. You should both consider this a red flag If you both can‚Äôt talk about this without balmy expressing your own wishes and then respecting the other persons decision. ESP if it‚Äôs her own goddamn money she‚Äôs spending on the dress."
