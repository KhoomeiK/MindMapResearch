TheRightCantMeme,ffeew7o,t1_ffeb4v6,1579845403.0,"So when I need money to pay for things like food and housing, I should just not take jobs and wait for that cushy ceo position to open up for me right? Might take three days. Might take 3 years. Might never open up. But screw me for needing money today rather than when that better job opens up right? I just need to wait it out and just not need food or a place to live in the meantime. That’s realistic."

politics,fe2jowt,t1_fe28f5o,1578839190.0,"As someone who took consumer ed 6 separate times in Illinois I can say that the unit taught me absolutely nothing and at least at my school was terribly implemented. 4 of the times the teacher used a shitty budgeting worksheet and didn’t really do much with it. It wasn’t engaging and no one learned anything. In one of the classes we learned about corn. And in the last one the guy taught us how to fill out a few tax forms. All in all 4 times it just took away from class time and left people doing nothing 
1 time I learned something useful 
And 1 time can best be described as a meme. Fucker called us “the real children of the corn”. I miss that teacher. He was hilarious"
