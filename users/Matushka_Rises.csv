AskReddit,feyoggk,t1_femfomp,1579448274.0,"Ok this is long, but I think this might be helpful to share with others what this type of financial abuse can actually look like. I am still recovering from a toxic relationship, where my ex's father did the same thing as OP's dad. The family has done extremely well for themselves, but live and behave in a manner akin to Trailer Park Boys. His dad glorifies their standard of living like a badge of honor, and any behavior (usually horrible life choices) that support his narrative are not only encouraged, but rewarded, and anyone who says otherwise is treated like an imposter and shown the door.

Gas-lighting was common. His dad would regularly brag about spending tens of thousands of dollars on guns and wine for himself, but if any basic household need/repair/replacement was mentioned, he either brushed them off by saying how they couldn't afford it because ""he"" was ""so poor,"" or he would say things like ""oh pretty good... you a princess now? Too good for this?"" or if challenged further, he would erupt into an absolute fit of rage about how much HE sacrificed, and how ungrateful everyone was for what he had done. He could go from persecutor to victim in the blink of an eye.

I wish I was exaggerating, but the volume of junk his dad collected was staggering, and I literally mean junk... Like the kind of stuff that donation centers throw away because it is too busted, too broken to be of use even if repaired. It always reminded me of this scene out of [Labyrinth](https://youtu.be/EOWRWG5_nAQ), but I don't think his dad was a true hoarder. Rather his ""treasures"" served to reinforce the fear, manipulation, and control he established in the first place. According to him they were so poor they couldn't afford to buy new, or really buy anything, but by being humble and collecting all this stuff, he was in fact looking out for his family, because ""you never know what could happen at any moment."" Large demonstrations were made about how his superior capacity to repair an item ultimately saved his family from the ever imminent risk of financial collapse. So! more possessions equals more savings, which equals more wealth, and in turn makes him a superior provider! The irony being that the countless man hours he spent repairing things, far outweighed the replacement cost, but that never seemed to stop him from ""humbly"" bragging about how much he had saved his family. It was twisted logic, but some how they bought it, and even if they don't, everyone is either so scared of, or over, his tirades  no one argues otherwise.

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of all, is seeing how his dad has corrupted the psyche of my ex and his siblings, so that that they now carry on the torch and impose this combination of abuse not just on their immediate relationships, but also on themselves, while maintaining a holier than though attitude (the latter probably being the result of Stockholm Syndrome and a survival mechanism).

Looking back, I now shudder when I look at some of the ways I was being groomed by that family. When were apartment shopping, and my house was going up for sale, my ex offered me the convenient solution to store my belongings in their warehouse. Later on, when I attempted to break up and move, my stuff was used as leverage against me either by insinuating I owed them, or thwarting any efforts I made to move it off their property through subtle sabotage, ie offering to help me move, then changing plans last minute. Ideas like me putting my savings into their high interest rate mutual fund, combining other resources, or us rushing into marriage were regularly floated. I could never really determine if these came from my ex, his dad, or a combination thereof, but I'm so grateful I maintained my boundaries and got out!"
