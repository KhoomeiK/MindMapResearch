trashy,ffakmuq,t3_esdti9,1579738107.0,The age of consent in america is generally 16 depending on state laws. It can be as low as 14 or as high as 18. However for anyone under 18 the person you are with can be no more than 4 years older than you unless married. So if this girl was 16 it would still be illegal.

Some of these series are questionable at being underrated as they are more popular series but I still think they are worth mentioning as maybe some people have not heard of them. All the names I posted are series. A few of them on that list you can buy the whole series for 1 credit on audible."

You may have misunderstood what I meant from the way I phrased it but what I meant was yes you can not take a case if you wish but most lawyers are not going to abandon a case just because their client is guilty. Most clients are guilty. 

The second part I was commenting on was you saying you wouldent say the things he said. What he said about the verdict was also a service to his client. Acting as if the conclusion was the right one regardless of how he personal felt about it because that's his job."

trashy,fez0cvx,t1_feyyo9f,1579452698.0,I mean that's a fair opinion to have and if you were a lawyer you could refuse him if you wish but that's generally not how lawyers work. You are supposed to do everything in your power to help them for payment. To do any less would be negligent of your duties. Hes supposed to downplay the negatives and highlight any positives his client has. If you get a favorable judgment you are supposed to act like it is a natural conclusion because your client deserves it. I'm not advocating for anything his client did but what I am saying is that if you are a lawyer and you take a case on then it's your job to do these things and your personal feelings on the matter never come into it.

AskReddit,feybeq1,t1_feusdfs,1579443237.0,In a documentary I watched a pornstar was talking about the taste of semen.

This will make a neutral or faintly sweet tasting semen.
AskReddit,fey9iwt,t1_fevo2hc,1579442531.0,"It's not really about ass wiping. I'll admit when I didnt understand more I found skid marks in my underwear. I could wipe and then shower and a hour later I'd have skid marks. This was disconcerting to me as you can imagine so I did a bunch of research to figure out why my ass was being an asshole.

The biggest factor for most men (like 80% of them) is diet. If you dont get enough of the right types of different foods specifically fiber it can cause problems. So as a young man eating mostly fast food I was not helping myself very much. Another huge factor is inflamed hemorrhoids can cause seepage issues. Drinking lots of alcohol is bad for your digestive system as a whole but can cause seepage problems too. Some medications.

There are men out there who have terrible diets, hemorrhoids, and drink too much but have no leakage problems however they are the exception not the rule. Most men cant live like that without side effects. So I started taking a fiber supplement, got some hemorrhoid cream, and started drinking less. Lo and behold no more skid marks. 

Any guys reading this wondering why their butt is betraying them try to live a little better. It dosent take much to clear up the problem for most people."

personalfinance,ferv7pz,t3_eqgmep,1579358645.0,"Mostly what everyone else has said is the right advice heres why though. If you have no credit right now and are trying to start building it then your credit is 0. Banks/credit unions dont use 0 as a credit score though. You get an approximate credit score of roughly 530-550. They are going to treat you as if this is your credit score until you can establish some credit history. That's way too low for a cashback or platinum card. It's perfect for a secured card or student card though and that's why so many people start with them.

Full disclosure: I'm not in finance or work at a bank. This is just how it was explained to me at my bank when I first started trying to get credit cards. It was also 15 years ago so the values may have changed or the way your evaluated may be different today."

You can order them online legally but if she lives at home then she would probably have to explain to her mom what she ordered and most people dont want to have that conversation.

More to the point of why I got upvotes is because the person I replied to was using blanket generalizations for a whole group of people (white women). Saying that all white women would be to emotional to serve unbiased on a jury isnt just misogynistic it's stupid. The mathematical probability that every single white woman is so emotional they cant use logic is astronomically low. Broad generalizations do nothing to make your argument better.

Race play is a consensual act between 2 people or group whatever people get into point being it's a shared activity between all parties involved. This is a highly racist fantasy of one person.

A person who has never seen something hardcore like say gagging porn will still be looking for that type of activity eventhough he doesn't know what it's called. The desire to watch or do the thing is there before the porn of it is found. If a demand is know a supply will be created if none already exists.
