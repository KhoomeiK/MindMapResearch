todayilearned,fei04cr,t1_fehz72w,1579127400.0,"It's more to do with the quality of the product. Paid donors donate more frequently and have lower levels of proteins in their plasma. 

For example most plasma centers will have patients donate twice a week where as blood banks make you wait ~28 days to donate plasma again.

Edit: clarification"
todayilearned,fehav4k,t1_feh9n9j,1579112761.0,Thankfully she works in distribution (the one you'd contact to order blood!) and not testing. The worst part of it is that it wasn't even a money issue. They offered all the techs $10k plus housing to move to Atlanta. It was literally just a matter of being unable to buy the supplies.
todayilearned,feh6y0w,t1_feh6rs9,1579110429.0,I can but choose not to do so. Carry on.
todayilearned,feh66hq,t1_feh5mek,1579109969.0,"""quality of donation"" would not make sense in my original comment you took issue with."
todayilearned,feh4q3h,t1_feh4lt7,1579109102.0,"Is there a difference? The donor is the product.

Edit: wording"
todayilearned,feh30w6,t1_feh1x7b,1579108095.0,"[A 2010 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001115/) found that frequent paid donors have lower levels of proteins in their blood, increasing the risk of infection and liver and kidney disorders.

Since paid plasma donation centers [target the poorest of Americans](https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/how-blood-plasma-companies-target-poorest-americans) it's easy to see the connection between paid plasma and low quality donations.

Edit: a word"
todayilearned,feh12yd,t1_feh0cmx,1579106925.0,Donors who meet the elegability criteria to be able to donate plasma.
todayilearned,fegztn0,t1_fegz75t,1579106165.0,"Usually, yeah."
todayilearned,fegzreb,t1_fegz86v,1579106128.0,"I'm sorry that you both are going through that. I do thank you for sharing, it's very rewarding to hear from the folks on the other side of the donations !"
todayilearned,fegylo1,t1_fegyav8,1579105414.0,You get paid to donate to the Red Cross?
todayilearned,fegxlrx,t1_fegx2m8,1579104794.0,You are able to donate plasma at most facilities that do regular blood donations.
todayilearned,fegx4v3,t1_fegwhhg,1579104500.0,"I mean maybe, I don't know you on a personal level.

I didn't say everyone who gets paid to donate plasma is human scum. There are two paid plasma centers near me, one in an affluent area and one in a more impoverished area. The clientele and facility are vastly different. 

In most cases (not every) people are not getting paid to donate plasma because they want to give back to their community, it is to get paid and the humanitarian efforts are a by-product."
todayilearned,fegutqv,t1_fegtr78,1579103029.0,"As awesome as that sounds I have a personal vendetta against the Red Cross. There are 2 blood banks in my state (multiple donation sites, 2 banks). My wife's work and the Red Cross. 

The Red Cross went on a purchasing spree and bought all the antibody reagents used in blood typing (far more involved than A/B/O). As a result her company had to lay off the entire donor testing department and has to ship *all* the blood to Atlanta for testing."
todayilearned,fegu9xq,t1_fegtiof,1579102676.0,You are correct. Paid donations do not attract the highest quality donors to say the least.
todayilearned,fegtcbl,t1_fegso51,1579102072.0,Yep. My wife works at a blood bank and always tell me when they are doing promo drives. I haven't paid for an oil change in years and probably 60-75% of the t-shirts I own are blood bank ones lol
todayilearned,fegsvd6,t1_fegsfb3,1579101759.0,Unpaid plasma donations are also important. FDA does not allow transfusion of product from a paid donor. When you get paid to donate plasma that is used to make medication and not for direct patient care.
todayilearned,fegsdli,t1_fegrfm0,1579101429.0,Fun Fact: the FDA will not allow a blood transfusion from a paid donor! The reason some plasma centers are able to pay donors is because that product is not directly transfused but instead made into medication.
todayilearned,fegs8el,t1_fegr63c,1579101332.0,You may not be the ideal donor for whole blood/double red but we will gladly take your platelet or plasma donation :)

woodworking,fbwyaxc,t3_eeuk7s,1577162796.0,Very nice! Very clean... I would never want to use it! Lol
runescape,f9h2orp,t3_e51yks,1575308289.0,Yes. I was worried I wasn't going to but I finished my last hour on Saturday.
