Texans,fe4ugxb,t1_fe4u19e,1578862885.0,I think so. Up by three TD‚Äôs- that means the risk is more points vs an entire possession.

oddlysatisfying,fdgzil1,t1_fdgvnf4,1578412076.0,"No, most people are aware of the friend zone. 

And it is a very real thing. 

The friendzone is a relationship status one is relegated to when feelings stronger than simple friendship have been rejected by the person they have developed those feelings for. 

This status is also known as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. 

Which is an amazing and wonderful thing to be! 

But sometimes it hurts too much to be a friend without  the feelings being returned. And that may cause the rejected party to have to leave in order to save themselves from pain. 

And that is unfortunate- but ok. 

What is not ok, is the harassment of the rejecter. Constant reminders of the unrequited love. Pressure to feel the same. Derision for feelings that aren‚Äôt there. Or any kind of manipulation of the rejecter. 

If you do any of the above, you are no longer a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù.

You are an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù."
