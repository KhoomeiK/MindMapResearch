With or without the bipolar, no one can survive all that. I’m bipolar, I understand it, and I don’t want to have to put up with the constant pile of excrement that others have tried to pile on top of me. Imagine what it’s like for someone who doesn’t understand it to be expected to put up with all that and to be expected to come back for more whenever we want them to."

There are drugs that can help with the chemical imbalance in her brain, and therapy can help how her mind reacts to the imbalances and the world around her which would help your relationship.

1) Throw away the concept of, “good” and “bad” when referring to yourself, or your situation, or your behavior. Don’t even ever use the words. They cause us to judge everything we do in a moral way and we then end up hating ourselves because of all the “bad” things we do, and how we judge ourselves so harshly and we think of ourselves as failures with character faults. That leads us to all sorts of ideation and over thinking, anxiety, etc. because our analytical mind won’t let it go. Instead, look at your thoughts, actions, moods, etc. as “healthy” or “unhealthy”. Those words are morally neutral. You can then look at something objectively, and adjudge it as one or the other, and then rationally begin to take steps to diminish unhealthy behaviors and increase healthier ones without the crippling self loathing.

As far as trusting others: you don’t have to reveal everything about yourself to anyone. You can be more like an onion, one layer at a time. Remember there are three persons within each of us...the person the world knows, the person your close friends and loved ones know, and the person only you know."
bipolar,fe8gxzh,t3_enwk3y,1578925999.0,"Before I ever tell anyone anything I ask myself why I’m revealing this thing to this person and what I expect this person to do with this information. We often do others a disservice by giving them too much information about something, that we then expect them to digest and be okay with. Like giving an infant meat when it should still be on formula. I’m careful about vomiting up and expecting someone to eat all my bipolarity right away. To the uninitiated neurotypical person, that’s what it can seem like. There are so many posts on here from people who have told everything about their bipolar to someone and then gotten angry when the other person couldn’t handle it. Picture a balance scale. For every item revealed that goes onto the left side, there should be enough positive time and experiences between the two of you placed on the right side to balance it out. That way, as your relationship grows, your bipolar becomes and acceptable part of the relationship rather than an enormous pile placed on one side of the scale with little or nothing on the other side to balance it out. ❤️"
