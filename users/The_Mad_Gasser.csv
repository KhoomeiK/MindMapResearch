GenX,fdkldwl,t3_elqndo,1578505956.0,"Growing up was similar to your description. My dad spent time with me when I was small and a little after my sister was born, then later dad would take me along with him to hit up pawn shops, thrift stores, antique malls, and auctions looking for deals on tools, electronics, and what not. But other than that, my dad worked 12 hour shifts at his job, so he was tired when he came home and doing yard work on his days off.  Dad didn't drink or abuse us, just lost interest in us and really only cared how well we did in school. My mother started working when I entered school, and while I saw her more during the day, she didn't ""play"" with us.  


A few years after dad passed away, we were going through an old suitcase of photos and a lot of the past that I didn't know was brought up. Dad worked hard to provide for us and while he didn't act like it, he was proud of us and kept just about everything we made for him over the years. Dad had depression that was not addressed and I assume working was his outlet. Mom mentioned at one time they considered divorce because they had grown apart, but stayed until we were through school.  I guess that gave him time to think because it was never brought up again.  My dad always spoke down to me and every comment sounded like he was being judgmental of what I was saying. He spoke to me until I got married (at the age of 27), after that we spoke like old friends on the phone about yard work, gardening, and tv shows.  He never knew he got a grandson from me and when I talk to my boy about dad, I try to talk about the good things and fun times. I am cautious how I talk to my son, so that he doesn't feel the way I did. I tell him I love him and I give him a hug and a kiss on the head. 

My mother has gone through a lot of health scares since dad passed and I try to visit as much as I can (she's across the state). Mom has opened up to me over the years since then and has told me a lot of things that I was too young to see or understand. While I know my dad had faults, I don't blame him and if I had one wish, I would wish to see him one more time.

Thanks for listening."
