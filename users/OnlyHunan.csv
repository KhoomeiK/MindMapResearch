AskReddit,ffekbu6,t3_esy81b,1579851611.0,"I had already been awake for 24 hours straight *before* I drove out to spend a whole day at a sporting event. Driving home at night, I began halucinating behind the wheel. I was on a 6-lane wide stretch of the Garden State Parkway, when I thought that a car entering from an onramp was heading directly for me. I slammed on the brakes, did a 180 across multiple lanes, and ended up in the fast lane against the divider, facing oncoming traffic.

I didn't hit anybody. When traffic stopped, I just turned around and headed on my way."
