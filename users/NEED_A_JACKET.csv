Imagine the reverse scenario where you were waiting on a divorce or some messy situation (kids, house, whatever) and no-one would go near you because it seems like 'homewrecking'. If you couldn't convince people that you're not in a proper relationship (maybe technically you are on paper, but other than that you're not) you'd be frustrated that people don't let you decide what relationships you are/aren't in.

  
Also I would say it's almost always going to be downplayed by the cheater. They won't let on the full extent of their relationship or imply that its ended or near ending etc, either to convince you or to justify what they're doing. So you might ""know"", but you've been told for months how they're not together and they're seeing other people and so on. You'd not like to be called a homewrecker because you got mislead by someone cheating. Even if its not fully misleading and you're aware they have some kind of commitment or connection to their partner, you can't be expected to know the details especially if they're almost certainly putting a twist on it (intentional or not) when they talk about it to you."

unrealengine,ff5i6a2,t1_ff4rn74,1579593987.0,"The effect you've got there could definitely be faked without the need for any masking, I don't know if that would be a suitable answer for all your usages though (eg. different shaped meshes not just the half cylinder thing).

Not ideal but I don't know the answer for how to use the boxmask 3d to get the effect.

It isn't purely some stereotype from nothing, you get your shit together and people can see that you're willing to put effort/time into something difficult, one of few things you can't just buy or luck into. What do you want people to judge you on if it's not that? It's, in most cases, a reflection of at least part of your personality available for people to judge you on, which can't easily be faked. It's far more a reflection of you as a person than for example if you ironed your shirt, yet most people would do that for an interview at least and would expect to be judged if they turned up scruffy."
unrealengine,fejchz2,t3_epg21v,1579167151.0,"I think fixing the animation (or pose or whatever it is) so that it points forward is going to be the best long term fix here. You could just do a combine rotator node with the angle + some fix offset, and that should work, but if they end up using a different weapon for example, you'd have to use a different 'fix' offset because its unlikely another pose you make or buy will have the same incorrect angle. If you make them all work so they all point 'forward' then you can do the rotator math to get it to point where it needs to be and it'll be consistent.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, you could figure out the ""look at rotation"" between the back of the gun and the muzzle, subtracted from the look at rotation to the enemy, and that'll give you a more dynamic 'fix'. You could create a socket (in the skeleton editor/details) and position it relative to the muzzle (but moved further back) because you might not have a bone in the right place to begin with. Or you could just use the hand bone (or a finger etc) to the muzzle as the offset."
unrealengine,fej7w1c,t1_fej6fri,1579160648.0,"Well really what you want to be doing, in terms of the animation, is getting the difference between the characters rotation (character mesh, I guess) and the LookAt rotation, so that you compensate by the right amount IE 0 compensation if it just so happens that the mesh is pointing the right way.

So yeah essentially. Delta rotation node, where it 'wants to aim' as the top pin (eg. this would be the lookat rotation from the gun to the enemy), and where it's already aiming as the bottom pin (eg. the character mesh rotation). Then it'll give you a rotator relative to the direction he's facing already. (eg. 0,0,5 if the enemy is 5 degrees to the right). Then you just use that (or just use the yaw value) in the animation blendspace or aimoffset or spine control or however you're doing it."
unrealengine,fei6dp0,t1_feg1ttb,1579131286.0,"Well if you're using some form of ""Find look at rotation"", and doing it from the actor location to the enemy actor location, then instead you could do the lookat rotation from [muzzle]->[enemy]? At least in terms of the player model / blendspace (or whatever you're using). So the model is facing the right way so that a straight line (from the gun) will hit the enemy, rather than a straight line from their origin.

But essentially the way I have it set up, is a blueprint which checks its own location and does the calculations based on that, to locally offset a camera within that BP. So the blueprint can be attached to anything or set to track anything, and it will react to the camera speed & acceleration (for both location and rotation), and just be used like a regular camera in the engine would.

The 'why' is that I'm working on a game where you don't have direct control over the final mouse movement, just where you're intending to aim, so when it's played back I didn't want it to be too overly robotic/boring looking. I decided to make it more of a general system though so that it can be used for fully AI players.

The second reason is I'm wanting to get close to realistic aim/shot timing so that I can run simulations with different weapons, in order to balance weapons. If it was tested with perfect aim, it would always favour the most accurate hitscan weapon with highest damage per second, so it wouldn't really match up with real players. It won't be exact, but I think it'll help to get a starting point / baseline for weapon balances without needing thousands of (human) hours of testing."

The first time you watch it you're looking around the full video trying to figure out what to focus on, unsure where the action will happen. Then something crazy/funny happens and you kinda get the gist but weren't totally sure. A well placed replay will let you see the clip again now you know what is about to happen, but slowed down to give you more chance to look (eg. did she push him into the fountain or did he trip??) as well as notice more subtleties you might find funny (eg. look at her face straight after, she did it on purpose!).

If you had a video of yourself where you did something stupid or amazing or generally unlikely, would you just play it once and never again?

In this case it wouldn't indicate success (because you had the money to sustain it) but 99% of cases it would have been successful in terms of bringing in a wage for the person running it.

But if we're talking 5-10 years, you're getting to mastery levels of a skill (I don't really believe the whole 10k hours thing but you'd be getting very good at whatever it is you're learning).

If it's your passion to be a surgeon or whatever, something you can't realistically do by yourself, then that's an exception. If you'd like to do that job even if it wasn't paid and you genuinely loved it then fair enough. Most people are just in jobs they kinda like (for the money), but wouldn't do for free and have no real passion for. They don't wake up on weekends wishing they were in work."

I think there's some exceptions where people are in a job they actually enjoy and would do for free, but I think the best option for most people would be to take 5-10 years off to pursue that (-> a 'job' which is really a hobby). Maybe you're already in it now, congrats if so. I just think a lot of people aren't in that situation and aren't seeing the value of having a few years to really pursue something."
Prematurecelebration,fc0btep,t1_fc09ne7,1577286242.0,"This is idealistic though. We're talking about a +$450k scenario. If I expected everyone to do the same as me or be able to get jobs they enjoy I'd be the idealistic asshole. I know I owe a lot to having a cushy life outside of work which not everyone has. But we're talking about a scenario where you're granted a cushy life for 5-10 years for zero work. People underestimate how good you can get at something in that amount of time, especially if it's your primary focus. Or more specifically how valuable you can make yourself. IE not be in a situation where you have to beg for jobs or suck up to keep the job, unable to take a break and still come back. Seems like people need more self-worth, or at least an intention to improve themselves so they're worth more. Just irks me that people are valuing a job or career or money over their own time and interests."
Prematurecelebration,fc09dag,t1_fc08hhv,1577283856.0,"I think that's a rare circumstance, and also probably comes down to how you put it across.

Telling them the reason you're leaving your business and looking for a job, because you'd rather focus on [specific role] rather than the [accounting/business nonsense/etc], and that you preferred working as part of a team before you started the business etc.. they're going to see you as the best of both worlds.

Why would you be so passionate about working in a job where they'd rather not have you? Or not take you back if you left? How could you be proud of your career if that was the case, where you're totally disposable to them and their pride about re-hiring you would outweigh your actual value?

Surely (ideally) you want to be in a job where you're extremely valuable and useful, and if you said fuck you and left for a few years, they'd still jump at the chance to have you back? 

If you're not in a job like that, take the money, take 10 years out to work at the job you really want where you'll actually provide value. Enough value where you can take time out if you'd like, and they'll still be happy to have you come back."
Prematurecelebration,fc08qbu,t1_fc0746k,1577283190.0,"> If you are doing something you love and adding value to the world, why quit.

Totally agree with that. However, I don't think that applies to 99% of people. I don't know anyone personally who would do their job for free, so they don't love the job, they love the job+money combination. Some people may genuinely love their job and being paid to do it is a bonus, I'd say those are the exceptions.


I'm not suggesting people quit their job to do nothing and just blow through the $450k. But 10 years of salary for nothing (or 5-10 years) is a gift of time, 10 years to get into the job or business you really want. 10 years where you don't have to worry at all about money and can focus 100% on making a business or learning a skill or whatever you want, and people would rather take the immediate disposable cash option."
Prematurecelebration,fc08cgm,t1_fc05naj,1577282777.0,"I'm under no illusion that having a bit of money magically means you can have money for life. Or else the best advice would be to just try to get a loan.

But let me pose it to you differently, if you could be given +10 years of experience in any industry/hobby/skill (eg. you're learning like it's the Matrix) would you still do the same job? Would you choose your current job as the 'skill' you're trying to learn? It'd help you to advance in your current job / career path sure, but most people aren't in their ideal job.

EG. if you're working in retail or a generic office job or whatever (something decent but not something people tend to think of as a 'passion' job), and you could be given +10 years of experience for free as a software engineer, or videographer, or graphic designer, or whatever, would you not take that and try to get a job in that industry during those 10 years?

If you've got 10 years to learn/practice/fail/try things out and you'd rather just stick with the job you have because you can't conceive of getting anything better with 10 years of experience, then you either absolutely love your job (maybe even do it for free?) or have very low expectations of what you're capable of learning/doing given 10 years.

And I'm aware I sound like a dick and cringing you out, and people are going to downvote this, but I just can't understand or comprehend some peoples attitudes towards work/jobs/hobbies etc. It seems absolutely crazy to me the things people are willing to put their time into. If you have no other option at all (almost everyone does but choose the short-term easiest) then I understand it. But other than that, you're giving away something far more valuable than money (your time). When you're 90, you'd give all the money in the world to have an extra 10 years being in your 20s, but it's a one-way street where you can exchange your time for money but not the reverse. People would rather pay 40 hours a week of time for 10 years, just so they can have an immediate $450k of disposable money? 

Am I the weird one here? Are people really enjoying their jobs so much?"
Prematurecelebration,fc077gn,t1_fc05cye,1577281509.0,"Running your own business in the industry for 10 years though would be a huge advantage when looking for a job though.

I understand you can't live off 400k for long and that money would run out, but if you just got given 10 years salary out of the blue then why wouldn't you at the very least take 10 years off? If you're worried about being able to get a job in 10 years, you could spend the time learning something new / something you enjoy, run a business for 5 years whilst you have money to support living whilst it's not making money.

Even if the 10 years is actually only ~3 years dependent on your wage, the same applies? Honestly confused why anyone wouldn't quit. Maybe not burn bridges by quiting on air (which might fuck your chances of any work or business in broadcasting) but still.."

AskReddit,fbw7f9q,t3_eephfd,1577142652.0,"Unpopular opinion for reddit I imagine, but it's got a different connotation for me.

Typing online (reddit etc) I'll avoid it and usually talk more formally than I would direct to friends. Not as formal as an email or copy writing but less conversational.

But with friends, I'll use you're/ur in the same sentence but for different emphasis, more in line with how I'd speak it in person. Also I think I do it to avoid repetition of ""you're"". I think accents might play a role in this as there's times when speaking I'd pronounce ""you're"" more like ""yurr"" and other times I'd pronounce it ""you're"". It's not to save time, to the extent that I'd retype it (changing to ""ur"") if it makes sense to, taking longer but coming across how I want. I think if you talk 100% formal with correct grammar/punctuation to friends you're missing out on a lot of possible emphasis and losing out on meaning, by trying to be strictly accurate and stick to formal rules (which were 'rules' long before talking informally via text was a thing).

  
Also, I'd argue even if people are using it for shortening/time saving there's nothing wrong with that. Feels like it's somehow elitist to act like language shouldn't be shortened or evolve and we should stick to 1500s English. If the meaning conveyed is the same (or I would argue \*more\* meaning if you use both in different contexts) then it's better and more efficient. Consider what you think is better in a different context, for example Googling something. If you're familiar with the internet you'd probably search the keywords like ""bike cheap uk"", whereas someone older/unfamiliar with how to use the internet might search ""where can I buy a bike for cheap in the UK"". Mindlessly sticking to an outdated ""proper"" English doesn't make you clever or better, unless you're comparing yourself to someone who doesn't \*know\* how to type correctly. If they are spelling things wrong just because they don't know how to type it properly then yeah they're probably a moron, but most of the time it's not the case, they're just talking in a language you're not yet familiar or comfortable with."
