sharks,ffe1ftr,t1_ffdmoah,1579834218.0,"Dredging up an old comment of mine because it's relevant:

In terms of bites not being followed up, there are a number of potential explanations that are much, much better than, ""humans taste bad.""

1) Many bites may be motivated by curiosity rather than hunger. This is a big one.

2) For many sharks, humans may simply be difficult to eat owing to our size and ""bony"" structure (though I take some issue with this idea as well).

3) A shark may get a lovely mouthful of neoprene or fiberglass on the first bite.

4) White sharks in particular are known to take one large bite during ambush attacks and retreat to depth while prey bleeds out, returning to finish their meal later.

5) In the case of relatively smaller sharks biting humans, if a bitten human starts thrashing, it seems unlikely that the shark would continue to their attack. When sharks consume prey much larger than themselves, it's often by means of scavenging (except, of course, for the cookiecutter shark...which has attacked humans before).

I will freely acknowledge that much of this is speculative, but it seems far more likely that these explanations collectively account for single-bite behaviors much better than, ""humans taste bad."" And I cannot find a reliable study which supports that conclusion. 

On top of all of this, human remains have most definitely been found in the stomachs of sharks.

^ That last point is particularly important. Sharks have absolutely eaten people in the past."

It seems much easier to argue the reverse, if we take ""strawman"" to mean not just a _misrepresented position_ (its literal, technical definition), but more generally an object of attack _aside_ from a given position. Given the colloquial use of the term, that doesn't seem entirely unreasonable."

Her attitude towards the scientific community also seems fairly hostile, particularly following the incident with Haole-Girl (but that went both ways in my opinion, and I am a part of that community). 

I personally don't agree with her methods. You can raise awareness and work to dispell myths about sharks without touching them or even getting too close.

But if you were to line up every one of your ancestors (let's say maternal...for as long as that is applicable) and move back through them through time, then select a representative every ~ 100,000 generations (arbitrary number), you would probably end up with something very similar to that depiction.
