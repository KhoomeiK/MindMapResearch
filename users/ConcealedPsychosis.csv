My ex MIL had a habit of inserting herself into
Plans she was never originally apart of.

My ex and I had planned a surprise Disney World Trip for our daughters and we made the mistake of informing MIL by asking her to watch our pup for us.

She somehow took that has an invite, booked her own flight and assumed she could just stay with us at the rental.

About six hours after we landed we’re just relaxing as we’d been up since 2am when my ex phone rang it’s MIL informing us she’ll be pulling up in about 5 minutes and if I could come and help her with her bags.

My wife reminded her we’re not home we’re in Florida remember? She said Oh I know I flew in just an hour ago to join you guys.

Sure enough her cab pulls in not 5 minutes later needless to say my ex was fuming seething with anger her face was so red I though her skull was going to pop open and smoke billowed out like in the cartoons.

When asked why she was here she replied you don’t think I’m going to miss my granddaughters first trip to Disney do you?

Eldest overheard this and got excited and ran to tell youngest we’re going to Disney, Thanks for ruining the surprise we had a whole surprise planned out.

When asked why she though she was even invited she replied Ooh well I knew you guys would’ve invited me but I knew you only had enough for you guys so I figured you wouldn’t mind if I paid my own way...

#WRONG!!

Where is the dog? You’re suppose to be watching him for us?

*Ooh I left him with [Her chain smoking neighbor who has a billion cats*

My dog has canine asthma which is triggered by cigarette smoke and hates cats, So I had to make arrangement for a friend of mine to go get him and was told the lady had him locked in a pitch black room inside small car carrier with hardly any room to move (He’s only a little 10lb dog) with no food or water no telling how long he had been like that as we don’t know what time she dropped him off.

Despite her promising to pay her own way the first day she “forgot her wallet” so we had to pay for her food and fucking Mickey ears hat so she’d stop acting like a child.

Second day she tried to avoid paying for anything until I made it clear when we ordered that her bill would be separated from ours and walked away leaving her no choice.

The third day we did our damnedt to loose her in the massive crowds, it worked until she kept asking the park to page us.

Fourth day we got everybody up at the butt crack of dawn to get out of the house before she woke up and didn’t tell her where we were going....

She snooped and found out we had passes to Gatorland

So a fun surprise trip to Disney turned into a living hell.

After that we didn’t so much as whisper if we were going anywhere even on a day trip as she’d invite herself and would plop her ass in the front seat to either force us to take her or stay home, After we started to just stay home when she did that she’d just wait until we left and then would follow us.

She once followed us for 2 1/2 hours not even knowing where we were going, We were going to a friends 8 y/o birthday party.

She tried to invite herself but the girl mother told her to kick rocks.

and it’s not like she was lonely or anything she’s still married, has other kids, grandkids and friends but she latched onto us like fucking leeches"

The celebratory photo captured Kayla Kenney — who was wearing a rainbow shirt, and smiling in front of a colorful cake — at a local restaurant, where she’d gone with her family to celebrate.

“She was happy, she looked beautiful,” Kenney’s mother, Kimberly Alford, told local news station WAVE 3. “You know, of course as a mom, I took her picture of her blowing out her candles and I posted that on my Facebook page.""

The moment was a cause of glowing smiles for some, but gloomy frowns for others.The picture caught the attention of administrators of Kenney’s private school, the Whitfield Academy, who found no reason to celebrate with the teen. In fact, they called the image just the latest incident in two years’ worth of the student’s “lifestyle violations.""

Alford maintains there was no hidden agenda behind the picture. It was simply a teen celebrating her birthday.

“[Kenney] loves to laugh and dance and that’s just her,” she said. “There was nothing intended by that and even when I went back and got the receipt from the bakery, it didn’t say anything about representation, it just said assorted colors.”

That’s not how Whitfield Academy viewed it. A few days after Alford shared the photo on social media, she was contacted by the head of school, Dr. Bruce Jacobson.“It was an email expelling Kayla from Whitefield immediately due to a post on social media,” Alford said.

Jacobson said the picture “demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy’s beliefs.”

Alford doesn’t understand how the school got to that conclusion, and has filed an appeal against the expulsion.

“I feel judged, she feels judged, just very devastating for us,” she said.

School administrators have refused to meet with them, Alford said, but they agreed to list her daughter’s withdrawal from the school as voluntary, so it will not show on her school record.

She has now enrolled Kenney in a public school.

The world has no idea how many men are in prison today for a rape that never happened solely based on her word.

I once took a rape report for a young girl 16 or 17 years old who claimed her boyfriend had beaten her up and raped her.

All the evidence was there she was black and blue and was bloody all over her nose and mouth and the doctor confirmed she has had sex very recently but there was no fluids.

So all we had was her statement and the medical report backing up her claims so as part as the violent criminals arrest team It was my job to go arrest him.

A warrant was quickly taken out and an arrest team was assembled then we hit the house and because of the nature of his crimes and how bad the victim was hurt he was deemed too dangerous to make entry on as *you never know what a caged animal might do if cornered*.

After only a few minutes having the house surrounded with 9 or 10 police cars, officers with long guns all pointed at the front door while an officer on the PA System telling everybody in the house to come out of the house and surrender or were coming in.

One by one the family trickles out all with the genuine look of fear and *What the hell is going on* on their faces we promptly handcuffed everybody and sat them down and quickly identified the suspect and unhooked everybody else.

When we explained to them what was going on the boy started crying and said *I can’t believe she actually did it, She fucking did it mom!!*

At the time I didn’t really pay much attention as all rapist try and blame their victims for their arrest but my job was done as he was handed off to the sex crimes unit and I though that’d be the end of it until...,

Six months later I had a warrant come across my desk at first i didn’t pay close attention to the name until I read on and read “Admitted to  injuring herself until she was bruised and bloody then filed a report stating she had been raped, That’s when I looked at the name again it was the same girl I took the report from.

From what I gathered is the boyfriend had broken up with her but not before getting her to sleep with him one last time and while they were laying in bed afterwards he told her he had been cheating on her and that it was over between them.

She told him she was going to tell the cops he raped her, So after he left she went and got a heavy hardcover book and started smashing herself in the face with it causing her facial injuries then wrapped her hands around her neck to show hand imprints on her neck.

All was going to plan he was remanded to county jail until trial on $1million cash bond and stayed there for 8 months until his trial started, Everything was going according to plan until she decided to start celebrating and bragging about how she got her revenge for him cheating on her.

What she didn’t know was one of the people she had been bragging too was the defendant cousin (who until then was on her side) started videoing her bragging and telling the story in detail on how she came up with the idea to what she used to hurt herself and she was quite proud on how she got one over on the Podunk’ cop who took her report and comforted her and gave her a hug and how she couldn’t wait until he was finally convicted so she could sue him in civil court and how her civil attorney assured her a multimillion settlement as his family was “*Loaded*”

The day I was set to testify to the court for that poor girl but 9 comes and goes, then 10 , 11 , 12 the bailiff says to come back after lunch so we do but instead of sitting in the hall we’re all ushered into the courtroom only to hear the judge dismiss the case with prejudice and the defendant is free to go and the sheriff was ordered to have him released within the hour or she’d hold him in contempt.

I just like everyone else was confused on why it was dismissed so quickly but I assumed it had to be something big in order to get it dropped in the middle of trial.

That morning the judge called all parties including the victim and her parents into her chambers to inform them of the new evidence and asked the girl if she had anything to say before they continued she continued to claim she was raped until the judge hit play on her remote to show all of them the video recorded.

At first the girl and her parents tried to deny it was even her but the heart tat on her forearm gave her away and she finally admitted she was angry and lied to get back at him for cheating on her turns out she had been lying to her parents too they really believed she was raped.

So that same day we picked her up on filing a false report and perjury she plead guilty and got probation and she made a public apology on the local news

But it was too late the word was out that he was a rapist despite his name being cleared, We responded to numerous complaints at his residence where people smashed his car windows, slashed his tires m, spray painted rapist on the house and cars in the driveway.

He ended up having to move across the country and changed his last name just to outrun the stigma.

Our laws are so fucked up a girl can almost ruin a man life and reputation just by uttering “*[Name]Raped Me*” and he risking life in prison but when it’s found out to be a false claim she can really only be charged with filing a false report & perjury with no risk of any real jail time but probation a fine and maybe ordered to pay back the police dept for the time and resources used to investigate her claims but nothing for the real victim in this situation."

> Irish citizen parent born in Ireland
If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you are an Irish citizen, you can apply for an Irish passport. You do not need an Irish passport in order to be an Irish citizen but having an Irish passport is evidence that you are an Irish citizen.

> Irish citizen parent born outside Ireland
If you were born outside of Ireland and your parent (who was also born outside of Ireland) was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.

> If the parent through whom you are entitled to Irish citizenship was deceased at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time, you are also an Irish citizen. Also, you derive citizenship through an Irish parent whether or not your parents were married to each other at the time of your birth.

* You are not Irish because someone else in your family once was*

That’s true in place of grandparents to left Ireland to move to the U.S and had American Children who then married another American so the grandchildren can’t claim citizenship but the first generation children can.

It’s called Birth Right Citizenship by having a parent who is a descendant of said country.

Which means a child can be born in the US to an Irish father and American mother is still considered an Irish citizen right because they’re biological father is even if they’ve never been to Ireland in their life.

You are obviously confusing citizenships and heritage and Yes you’re still Irish if your great great grandfather was you’re just not an Irish citizen your heritage is passed down from generations to generation."

I guess there are some things that just can’t be found online and sometimes need to go hands on by consulting a genoglist and I believe Ancestry has some on site you can talk too.

Y’all should really come up with something new ACAB is really played out and getting old.

“When you assume you make an ass out of you and me”

I like how you make assumptions about Police Officers you’ve never met before in your life based off a few bad ones you have met especially one who was almost killed protecting you and the public by getting a drunk driver who could’ve potentially killed someone including you or a family member of yours off the street nice to know you still think I’m a bastard but when shit goes down who’s the first person they call? 9-1-1

There is an estimated 1 million active law enforcement officers in 2019 with thousands more being hired yearly only a handful of high profiled cases in where I’d absolutely agree were in the wrong and should’ve been fired and/or charged.

Stop making assumptions about one group you’ve probably never had an real interaction with based on stories you’ve read or you have plenty of experience in the back of a patrol car and hate all cops solely based on you got caught and arrested for your crimes.

I wouldn’t judge or make assumptions about you because I had a bad experience with someone with your hair color."

Fire was quick on the scene which saved me from the blood getting cut off and needing to be amputated.

The other driver had took two or three steps to the right just a minute or two prior which saved them from injuries aside from flying glass."
