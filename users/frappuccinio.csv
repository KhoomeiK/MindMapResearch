thisisus,ff802hr,t1_ff7zuxq,1579662495.0,He probably didn't think this would have a lifetime of reproductions by telling his 3yr old to go to bed
thisisus,ff7xolx,t1_ff7wzkj,1579660820.0,Probably about him visiting for the funeral.
thisisus,ff7xlnd,t1_ff7x81y,1579660764.0,When she said the earrings were gone I assumed deja or Tess borrowed them. But yeah the cufflinks make that less likely.
thisisus,ff7wwc1,t1_ff7woe2,1579660287.0,Yeah but not everyone can remember it either. I remember their old one at their old house was Annie's birthday which the family could easily remember.
thisisus,ff7wtlx,t1_ff7wm7r,1579660237.0,Not before the show no. Kevin didn't until season three and Kate didn't until she married Toby.
thisisus,ff7vqzm,t1_ff7v9wm,1579659509.0,I get it but at the same time with a loss like that it makes sense for Sophie to reach out to someone she has a lot of history with.
thisisus,ff7vlis,t3_es4gio,1579659404.0,The next two episodes all take place in the same week so I bet we'll see both sides of Kate's phone conversation then.
thisisus,ff79hpe,t3_erwapt,1579643862.0,"one of my favorite scenes is when he switches from depressed to happy to take a photo with that fan, and then back to depressed. its so specific, yet anyone who's had to fake it because of their mental health can understand."

AskReddit,fen8wub,t1_fen4yzi,1579279536.0,Cho was ravenclaw. She wanted to be the one to take harry to look for the diadem in book seven but Luna took him instead.

smashbros,fek13ak,t1_fejte8z,1579190345.0,Same especially because name another smash character with an axe. Honestly three houses was huge and deserves smash rep but at the same time byleth coming on the tail end of ten other fe smash characters doesn't look good for anyone.
relationship_advice,feikaoo,t1_feigb8a,1579140504.0,What the fuck yikes. Do you guys have any overlapping social circles? I just mean like mutual friends who know about the same name thing and have acknowledged how yikes it is?

thisisus,fdxdopn,t3_emjyoz,1578767696.0,the way he kinda mocked the movie kate wanted to see leads me to believe he starts to belittle her and that leads to emotional abuse.

movies,fdsfmqg,t1_fdltzil,1578701670.0,He's actually talked about how he doesn't mind being known from potter. He says the role blessed him and he knows how much it means to people. He said he'd always be happy to talk about it with fans because he was once in a situation where he was a fan of some punk rocker and when he met them they refused to talk about the band. Dan said he'd never do that to people.
cringe,fdsbs6v,t1_fdsbn8a,1578698982.0,Yeah I was eleven tho so it was uncool to have your parents schedule a play date for you.
cringe,fdrmngx,t1_fdre4ho,1578686703.0,when i played softball it seemed like every girl on my team went to the same school as at least two other girls on the team or the same church. only me who went to some other school and church :( so everyone always had inside jokes and would see each other outside of practice. but not me :(

MovieDetails,fdmfg5f,t1_fdl535t,1578548126.0,i also always attributed it to andy taking really good care of them. you can see he managed to keep all the potato head pieces together (a feat) and he was never breaking any toy (sans accidental woody arm)

Anne,fbz892r,t3_ef8t2j,1577238169.0,"i think the point with gilbert is that he longs to be less ""boring"" like anne. he seemed his happiest when they were dancing and when he was helping her with her protest-- quashing authority rather than listening to them.

he's forced himself to act overly adult, because the thinks he has to. he think his childhood is over because his dad died. anne is the only person that reminds him he's still so young because he feels young with her. he feels like his true self.

as for anne, she's always done what she's believed in. she even said she didn't put anyone's name in the article because she didn't want to out josie specifically"
