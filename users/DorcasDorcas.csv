Parenting,fe6eo62,t3_enydt1,1578888658.0,Change schools.  Looks like Charlotte learned her behavior from two asshole parents that play dirty.

offmychest,fe4q9me,t1_fe3zn6t,1578861824.0,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain condition associated with repeated blows to the head. It is also associated with the development of dementia. Potential signs of CTE are problems with thinking and memory, personality changes, and behavioral changes including aggression and depression.  A 2009 analysis of 51 people who experience CTE found the average lifespan of those with the disease is just 51 years."

Parenting,fdl13om,t3_ely8zx,1578515207.0,Tell them the truth.  That she was not a good person so you're not upset.

offmychest,fd4cx76,t3_ek14jb,1578166426.0,I'd say the majority of working adults don't like their jobs.  That is why it's called a job and not funployment.  I've never met anyone that is working their 'dream job'.  Everything has a down side.
offmychest,fcj9llj,t3_ehdxxu,1577680693.0,Depends on how old you are.

JUSTNOMIL,fbxxa4s,t3_eeqgpe,1577202889.0,I really don't understand why you would keep celebrating with grandma year after year and let the abuse continue.  Grandma needs to learn a lesson and spend some holidays alone.
JUSTNOMIL,fbxwk9w,t1_fbxvqvh,1577202369.0,"I would ""accidentally"" trip while walking with a steaming hot cup of coffee and splash the crap out of that painting.  Oops."
JUSTNOMIL,fbxwi5c,t1_fbxvgw2,1577202326.0,Who cares what type of society it is.  Bullying is bullying.  I would tell her off and would most likely bar her from my home and my children.
JUSTNOMIL,fbxweim,t1_fbxp83g,1577202253.0,"I would put one or two of her photos in really hard to reach places.  Like the back bedroom at the top of a bookcase or in a room that nobody uses, like the spare bathroom."
offmychest,fbtijza,t3_eefujb,1577080160.0,"Well lying is a whole other issue.  You definitely shouldn't stand for lying.  And ignoring you on purpose for hours at a time is not cool either.  I thought she was only doing it to watch YouTube and not to annoy you.  If you've had the same conversation over and over again and she still won't change her behavior you will have to decide if this is something you can put up with long term.  I know for me, lying is a no go."
