Minox do have side effects and this has happened to other people. I've researched the topic of side effects quite extensively through different forums, youtubers/youtube comments etc and most people who get low libido does not take care of themselves. Atleast that is my conclusion.  


They do not get in enough animal fat, high quality protein, 7-9 hours of sleep, lift heavy weights. Have good cardio vascular health.  
It seems that most **people also use liquid and not foam.** I personally experience side effects from liquid.

  
Minox forces bloodflow to certain areas which of course also requires nutrients and resources form the body. Should the body lack nutrients and resources, the hormones will take damage. This is common with other medications.  


I'm not saying you should continue. But what I'm saying is that Minox might not be the problem, but rather the symptom of the problem.

 \---------

One re-occurring theory I see is that because of poor diet, sleep, lack of exercise etc one can actually prevent natural growth. Minox, because of the forced blood flow can kick start the growth you should've had in the first place. This would explain why some hair go terminal within weeks.

If proper sleep, diet, exercise etc is added the gains can in theory be huge as it is natural + new growth.

It is how ever worth keeping in mind that natural beard growth can happen up to like 50 years old. I would not recommend minox to anyone younger than 20.. Between 20-28 I had natural gains without minox. It takes time.

If this theory is true, then maybe your natural growth would continue beyond your minox cycle.

Minoxbeards,fdg5pe8,t3_el7bxf,1578381065.0,"One re-occurring theory I see is that because of poor diet, sleep, lack of exercise etc one can actually prevent natural growth. Minox, because of the forced blood flow can kick start the growth you should've had in the first place. This would explain why some hair go terminal within weeks.
