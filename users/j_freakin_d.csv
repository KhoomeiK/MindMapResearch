ScienceTeachers,feceo6q,t1_feca7aa,1578972119.0,"Here's everything I have.

We use Canvas for our LMS.  I only open up two weeks of material at a time. So week 1 I will have open week 1 and week 2.  If every week were open a good portion of the kids would do all 10 weeks worth of material in the first couple of weeks and I don't think that's a good way to learn.

Here is my YouTube playlist:

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DB64B1384D8BFBC)

I post all of the videos on Canvas and don't let them know about them being on YouTube.  I just use YouTube as a backup in case something catastrophic happens.  The videos are broken up into notes and example problems.  I decided to break them up to make the videos shorter.  I print out the notes for the kids to follow along and the video problem notes as well (these are both linked in the google drive folder later in the comment).  I'll also print out our lab book and give it to them, which is also in the google drive.

There is a lot of info in the Google Drive about the week to week and day to day. But it's basically the same thing every week.  The kids watch videos at home and take notes.  They can email me at any time and I respond ASAP, sometimes making more videos or just a picture of an answer.  (I get paid one hour a day to answer emails.)  On Thursday they come to class and take a test.  Class starts at 8 am and the test starts at 8 am.  Each test is about 1 to 1.5 hours long.  After they all finish the test we do labwork.  We will do two to three labs depending upon time.  Then they go home and do it all again.  But after week 1 they also have lab analysis and conclusion/discussion.  So every lab that we do in week 1 is due on Thursday of week 2.

The class is pass/fail.  The kids are allowed to miss one week.  They have to make up the test the next week they are back and then I have lab videos that they watch to make up the labs.  I just record one of the kids while they do the lab and post those.

Each year we get about 21 - 24 kids so far.  I get paid one hour a day for emails, time to set up and take down labs, and time in the classroom.  I end up getting about 1.5 hours a week to do grading which isn't nearly enough to get it done.

We meet every Thursday from 8 am to 1:30pm all summer.  Our summer school goes six weeks but we do all summer - so 10 weeks.  There is no way I could do this in 6 weeks and refused to entertain the idea.  The kids pay summer school tuition.

ScienceTeachers,fe6bxwv,t1_fe6apo3,1578886535.0,"The class is from 8 - 1:30.  Which is the same as summer school hours.  They do homework throughout the week but it doesn’t count for a ton of the percentage.  The homework is online and graded automatically (we use canvas as our LMS).

We have kids take AP right after honors and some that come back two years after honors.  I think that the summer kids do better for a couple of reasons: 1. There’s no gap in learning.  They are doing chemistry for a solid year instead of a 2.5 month gap of nothing and 2. Their is a higher expectation of learning on your own for the summer.  I make myself available via email but there are no other class sessions other than the quiz/lab day.  And I don’t review anything.  They walk in, class starts at 8 am, and the quiz starts at 8 am.  I’ve had kids ask for additional class sessions and I just tell them that additional class sessions will not occur - that is not going to happen in their course.  I’m paid hourly for the course.  

And I’ll tell that it’s a double edged sword.  We’ve been doing it for three years and I’m seeing the number of students that come back and take AP Chem dwindling.  It’s almost transitioned to a sophomore course.  And I have to give up my entire summer.  I teach the class every Thursday of the summer, grade two to three labs each week, and grade a test every week.  It’s a drain.  But the kids are very successful and I teach at a title 1 school.  They shouldn’t be successful but they are.  After AP Chem as a sophomore they go on to take AP Bio as a junior, and then AP Physics C as a senior.  All of my videos are on YouTube.  I made about 200 and they cover a solid honors chem course.  They’re not funny, or exciting, or amazing.  They just cover the content because I didn’t want to waste the students time.

I’d be more than happy to share everything I have if you’d like.  I’m pretty proud of what I’ve built."
ScienceTeachers,fe698v0,t1_fe5bq4n,1578884593.0,"The summer course is every week of the summer - so 10 weeks.  It’s pass or fail only and it’s a science elective credit but NOT honors chemistry.  If the kids pass they go into AP Chem and of they drop out or fail they go into Honors chem.  If they drop out or fail we don’t report an F.

I usually start the summer with 24 kids and have about 3 drop every summer.  They are allowed to miss one day only.  But they only come on Thursdays.  That usually gives them enough time to get their vacation in.

The students from the summer course always outperform the students from honors chem.  Always."
ScienceTeachers,fe5hcyl,t1_fe4ul5b,1578869452.0,"This is what works for me.  I go through all of the notes for that unit.  Straight through.  I do example problems along the way but no labs, no time in class to practice, nothing but notes.  I have all my notes typed out and I hand those out to the students.  I do that for two reasons: 1. I can move through the material faster if the kids don’t need to write everything and 2.  I know the kids have the right stuff written down because I gave it to them.

Once I get about halfway through the notes I hand out the worksheets/assign problems for the unit.  After we’ve had enough time for questions I do two or three labs in a row and then a test.

BUT - I set the schedule at the beginning of the year and stick to it."

marvelcomics,fd6prrd,t1_fd6ocgn,1578194233.0,"My absolute favorite right now is Galactus.  He’s not good or evil - he just is.  

I’m really amazed at Reed Richards and the fantastic four.  I’ve avoided the movies and I knew nothing about the family at all.  Once I started getting into the comics this summer, and before reading the Hickman fantastic four, I kept reading about how great they are and I just didn’t understand the love.  But now - I get it.  They’re a great group and those comics were fantastic.

Then through those fantastic four and FF comics I started to really really like Doctor Doom.  So I read all of the Hickman avengers and new avengers and ultimates up to secret wars.  My jaw hit the floor when Dr. Strange took on the Black Swans and was delivered to ... Doom!

I also really like Black Bolt.

I grew up watching the X-men cartoon so the new X-Men comics are a lot of fun for me right now.

I don’t like Captain America or Iron Man.  Neither are really compelling to me.  And then Thanos Rising gave me freaking nightmares man.  That was a crazy read.

1.  Is he still at the same school?  What a lot of people don’t know is that even if the relationship started after high school a school district can still fire and the police arrest him if they have a shred of evidence that the relationship MIGHT have started while you were in school.  That evidence may be as flimsy as “I saw them in the same classroom together one day after school and he was too close to her”

2.  If he’s at the same school a colleague/parent WILL go to the superintendent.  The superintendent will tell the district lawyer and now it gets nasty real quick.

3.  If he is at the same school most of his colleagues will view him differently.  Regardless of when the relationship started he will be viewed as a pedophile.

4.  You can’t keep this secret.  I know you think you can but you can’t.  It will come to light.

5.  The age difference alone will be a big factor.  It will be very obvious to anyone who sees you that you are VERY young and he is not.  This goes into #6.

6.  If you truly want this to work then he should go to another district (if he is currently at the same district) that is a good distance away from his current school.  But you would still have to keep it secret because of the obvious age difference.  A new middle aged dude in a district who brings out his barely twenty year old girlfriend will throw up red flags and now he doesn’t have tenure.  Word gets back to the super and he’s gone.  Now he’s a journeyman because no one will hire the teacher who is dating a former students THAT IS 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIM.

Look, you can move on easily.  When this love dies down or things aren’t working the way they used to you can move on pretty easily.  He can’t.  His career will be over.  It’s absolutely not worth it.  You should do the right thing and break it off and not contact him again.  I’ve seen these relationships.  They NEVER work out.  NEVER.

I’m sorry.  I know love is very special but this love isn’t and won’t work.  As someone else said, give yourself five years and then try to rekindle the relationship if you still feel the same way."
marvelstudios,fcw8lgo,t1_fcw2ug6,1578019632.0,"So I’ve just gotten into comics but have read a ton of Doom comics - the man is an enigma.  Bad guy?  Yep.  Good guy?  Yep.  Genius?  Yep.  110% confidence?  Yep.

Mr. Fantastics daughter has him wrapped around her finger but he will melt/obliterate anything and anyone without a second thought.  He’s also a tragic hero as he sacrifices himself to save others.  Honestly before I started reading comics with him in it I didn’t understand the character at all.  But now - I would LOVE to see a Dr. Doom on screen so long as they stick to the comic Dr. Doom.  He’s just a complex man.  Think Tony Stark AND Dr. Strange.  Doom took over Latveria and is their King but he does everything he can to keep the Latverian people safe and taken care of.

Again, I’ve read Hickman’s FF, I’m up through Secret Wars, and I’m also reading his current Dr. Doom comic."

ROMS belong to the original arcade builder - Atari, Nintendo, etc.  You can’t sell the arcade machine without ROMS and then provide directions on how to get and install the ROMS on the arcade machine.
