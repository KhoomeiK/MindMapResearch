My name is French

My age is a little too high 

I live in a small town called thick

I was born in the past

My body is one molecule 

I am looking for someone who can help me with my life, who enjoys my birthday, and has a lot of good stuff.

I enjoy the outdoors. I like to think, I like the idea of having fun, and I like that you are going through my emails.

My ideal partner would be a person who is not the only person in my world. Who can get me a phone and who thinks i‚Äôm going over to see my mom.

My turn ons are you and your family.

My turn offs are the same."

It conditions you to always clear your plate and eat beyond what you need even if you are satisfied, rather than listening to your body.

dating_advice,fc83lhq,t1_fc832g8,1577526060.0,"Although I think working on self love before being in a relationship is ideal, you can work on those things while in a relationship.

If you can't talk to a therapist, maybe start a cbt or positive affirmation journal. If you have a negative thought, you write the opposite down. You can probably find sources online. 

It's all about correcting your negative thought patterns. cbt has been extensively studied and proven to work if you stick with it.

So if you think ""I'm not worthy of love"" you write down ""I am worthy of all the love that life brings to me"". Or if you think ""I'm a horrible person"" you can write ""I am trying my best and do good things when I can""."
dating_advice,fc82y86,t3_egoqmg,1577525541.0,"It could also be that you're not as into him as you thought you were. Maybe you feel like you *should* like him because he's a great person or has good things going for him. But some times the passion isn't really there. It's happened to me many times. Don't settle just because you feel like you should like him.

If it is indeed because you don't love yourself, you should probably work out those issues with a therapist before being in a relationship anyway."

Maybe journaling would help? Not like a journal about your thoughts (although those are good too) but a daily-log journal of the things you do. That way you can see how you're budgeting your time.
