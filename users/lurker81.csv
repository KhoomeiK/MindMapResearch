Murderous cop is hyperbole I agree.

His life is ruined? Oh well. Don't shoot people that are already down and dying maybe? There are better people to feel sorry for."
toronto,ff7hfcf,t1_ff7be3i,1579649620.0,"Lol ""defending himself"". The guy was barely moving towards him. If you're going to lick boots at least come up with something factual, Jesus christ."

funny,ff48zqm,t1_ff47ch9,1579558158.0,"Jesus christ. Just because you don't understand doesn't mean I'm a troll.

You said ""our leaders"". Many leaders are not dictators, yet still espouse the beliefs you mention. They are also supported by millions of their voters and followers. So it's not all just on the leaders, there are fully grown adults that accept and agree with their leaders' shitty morals, and much of the blame lies with them.

Easy example, Trump."

CryptoCurrency,ff3a6cz,t1_ff39sod,1579537237.0,Interesting thank you. 6% is pretty low considering the volatility of crypto but 25 is something to think about.
worldnews,ff39you,t1_ff39tk6,1579537128.0,"I know, but it's more realistic when it's a country that's been saying all along that Taiwan is part of them and they will get it back."

worldnews,ff38829,t1_ff37f6y,1579536006.0,Yes but the US does not claim sovereignty over Canada.
funny,ff37ue5,t1_ff36m79,1579535754.0,"Agreed but these types of people have supporters, and lots of them. It's not all on the leader if they have millions that are cheering them on."

aww,fduecag,t1_fdtjbqk,1578731825.0,But he'd have no way of knowing what's fence vs not. So if he smashes into it below he doesn't know it's not there above - he thinks it's everywhere since he can't tell the difference.
MMA,fdudrum,t1_fdrzhyj,1578731571.0,"You say it's obvious he was not saying that, and I agree. You outline everything very well. However as you can see there are plenty of people that don't think it's so obvious. I wouldn't call them ""absolute morons"", that's just the way it is."
