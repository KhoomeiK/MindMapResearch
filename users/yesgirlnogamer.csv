Tinder,fej1wy4,t3_ep99sr,1579153907.0,"Serious question, how does someone with one leg stay in such fantastic shape?!?"
amibeingdetained,feiyg1a,t1_fegpzm2,1579150735.0,Thank you for this answer!  I love it!  You’re the best lawyer ever.
French,feiyeqs,t1_fegvk5o,1579150704.0,Not a spelling mistake. A misunderstanding of how prepositions and adverbs work.
amibeingdetained,feiybag,t1_feifn51,1579150623.0,I wish I had a patent on the rotary phone!
amibeingdetained,fegfmb9,t1_feftvq4,1579091129.0,It’s fun to pretend that the people you’re speaking to don’t know certain words!
amibeingdetained,fegfjqu,t1_fefyqc4,1579091057.0,"So such an order would be illegal unless it’s legal?  How delightfully circular!  

Thanks for the ruling citation."
French,feftv3g,t3_eov3t2,1579065034.0,"It’s in any way, not in anyway. Your English example is badly flawed. This is how to use the two different phrases: 

I want to help in any way I can. 

I was told to stay out, but I went in anyway."
amibeingdetained,feftcjp,t1_fefsoes,1579064589.0,"You have to obey a police officer if you, say, get stopped for speeding?  Do you have to exit your car on command?  Do you have to drive somewhere with him if he commands it too?"
amibeingdetained,fefs1s5,t1_fefr5ph,1579063508.0,"I’m not taking about her. I’m talking about the legality of a officer ordering you out of your car, and if you have to comply."
amibeingdetained,fefotjd,t1_fefmkp4,1579061100.0,Yep
amibeingdetained,fefhud0,t1_fefg9o1,1579056630.0,Ok fatty
amibeingdetained,fefdgb7,t3_eomttq,1579053950.0,"Am I the only one who believes that in fact a policeman can *not* legally order you out of your car?  I know all of this sovereign citizen stuff is complete nonsense and they are all idiots, but I was under the impression that you don’t actually have to obey a police officer except under certain circumstances. For example, they can’t stop and search you on the street without probable cause, or order you to drive to a church."

French,fdjb59d,t1_fdig73j,1578463909.0,"That’s an interesting explanation. I also found “bonne chance en tous cas” to be English parallel. By the way, I used the wrong phrasing.  I didn’t mean to say that I don’t believe you.  I meant I can’t believe it, like it’s hard to believe, not you’re lying or anything."
French,fdif0yl,t3_elgopt,1578441423.0,"I don’t believe you’re a native speaker. Your French is very English-parallel. For just one example, it’s rare to say “aider” by itself as in your title.  That’s an English construction. It would usually be “pour vous aider” or similar.  There are some other examples of this I think I see in your comments."

BeAmazed,fczq8po,t1_fcxtx2j,1578106704.0,That is true. I can see it both ways. I just feel like there’s so much here that it isn’t only one or two takes on a character but actually a cipher than could literally be anything.

BeAmazed,fcxlbxy,t3_ejb6yj,1578065710.0,"I guess I’m the only one who sees this as a failure to get across what the character is like.  Gregarious, slightly aggressive, shy, flippant, soaking it in, unconcerned?  If any one of these works, then what’s the point?  Did they have a story arc ahead of time?  If so, why didn’t he show that in his performance?  If not, why was the movie made at all?"
