I love the simple stuff, like just pure sushi, California rolls, edamame, etc which is better for you than the fancy rolls. I don’t eat fast food, I keep a lot of healthy food in my house, as I have to follow certain dietary regulations. My main problem is getting to working out, not what food comes after it though."

AskReddit,feleaoy,t3_epr0g5,1579220150.0,"If I had the money, yes.

From the negative, I could learn the things I may be accidentally doing that hurt or upset others. I would also be able to know who’s being fake, who I should just give up trying to be friends with, etc. I could read the things that people dislike about me and if it’s something valid, I could work to fix it.

From the positive, I would be able to reinforce the things people like about me, as well as have a reminder that even though sometimes it may feel like the work hates you, there has been and can be more good things people associate with me. I know all the time I talk about my friends and how wonderful they are to other people, and it’s hard to imagine anyone would do that about me."
AmItheAsshole,feknqdo,t3_epnbxq,1579203865.0,"YWBTA. Her behavior is out of grief, I’ve known people to act that way and have acted that way myself in times of extreme emotional distress. She needs you right now, and you need to be there for her. If you can’t make it to the wedding at all afterwords, plan to FaceTime with your friend for a little at the reception, and ask someone to record the ceremony for you. Make plans with your friend ASAP for your own little celebration. But you have to be there for your girlfriend. It’s a sucky situation, and I’m sorry you are in it"
RantsFromRetail,fehsz0q,t1_fehpw98,1579123258.0,"Dude is not like I broke down crying and complained to my boss. I said fuck you online where he’ll never see it cuz I was annoyed. You’re just someone who’ll never understand what it’s like to deal with the shit women have to put up with all the time, so it’s not really your place to say what sexism a woman should or shouldn’t be upset about.

You don’t even know me. I’m not “soft.” I’ve put up with a lot of shit and my life and I’m a strong person who’s come out of all that and am working hard to build a  future for myself. I handle stuff like this at least once a week. When people get fed up with something, they usually swear and complain. You probably thought about how annoying all those girls you worked with were all the time. You probably complained to people about the drama. Complaining doesn’t make you soft, it makes you human. 

Even if I was a soft person, so the fuck what? Everybody’s different and that doesn’t make them lesser. Every person deserves to not have rude comments made about their gender, or anything else about their appearance or identity, to their face at their place of work."
RantsFromRetail,fehp6pl,t1_fehm3b6,1579121097.0,"First, every other location in our area is primarily men so the fact that we’re a mostly female store is because we’re all people who were best fit for the job. Second, I’m not the boss so I couldn’t hire anyone even if I wanted to. Third, adding more men wouldn’t stop creeps from being creeps and asses from being asses to women. I mentioned that we were all women to make it clear how many employees receive these things from customers. It’s annoying as hell, so sorry for being a “sensitive turd” for being fed up with annoying and sexist customers.

We come across many men who are delightful and brighten our whole shift by being friendly and making good conversation and jokes that aren’t insulting.

We also get female customers who are extremely demeaning. I had a lady repeating stuff like “you young people don’t think anymore” when the register malfunctioned. People are assholes to retail workers. They don’t think before they say or do, and often are rude and disrespectful and make jokes that make us uncomfortable and we have to smile and laugh along with them. You’re not a girl so I don’t expect you to understand what it’s like to constantly face things like this from people."
RantsFromRetail,fehlr58,t1_fegz58w,1579119117.0,"The employees at my store happen to all be women except for one guy, so we get stuff like this all the time. Men making jokes that make us uncomfortable, guys making comments about what time we close, the other day some guy took a picture of my coworker while she was putting a package away. 

Holding up the line to make jokes about the fact I’m a female ringing you out is 100% dick move. 

This is also a rant sub, so if you don’t want people ranting about annoying things that happened at work, don’t read this sub!"
Advice,fegb3ad,t1_fefshtj,1579085765.0,I feel like it’d be rude to push the subject or ask behind her back

Advice,fefr1tu,t1_fefq4x4,1579062730.0,"I don’t think so, she’s allowed to have friends of all races. She’s not allowed to go to the houses of people from school. She just said something vague about it having to do with her gender and culture, and I didn’t want to push it since I had already pushed the topic enough."
RantsFromRetail,fefqmp8,t3_eomxri,1579062412.0,"This happens all the time oh my god! At my store skincare is the first thing you see when you walk in. I was working on facing the Christmas clearance (y’all know how much of a mess that gets) and this lady comes up to me asking where the cleanser is. At first I’m confused cuz obviously she couldn’t have walked over to the aisle I was in without seeing the aisle full of skincare and the signs saying very clearly what it is. I asked her what type of cleanser thinking may e she was looking for windex or a surface cleaner. She tells me: face cleanser. 

I barely could contain the look of shock and annoyance on my face when she pulled me away from a very big task to show her something you see when you walk in the door. It’s literally impossible not to see the face wash on the pathway to where I was because the aisle is cut open so you literally walk next to the skincare to get to the further parts of the store. Some people are just a different kind of special."
gatesopencomeonin,fe7dnid,t1_fe3z35a,1578913146.0,"I have a hammock, a lizard ladder for her to climb on, logs, a bowl of water for her to relax in, a cave she can hide in, and I let her out occasionally to run around or watch a movie (mine really loves to watch tv, especially the Emperor’s New Grove.)"
gatesopencomeonin,fdy5fys,t1_fdva2nt,1578776290.0,"Yes, as an owner of a lizard, every morning a part of my routine is dedicated to her, I have to take her to the vet, I get her fun things to do, make sure her space is clean, give her attention, make sure her living conditions are best for her, and so much more. And that’s just a bearded dragon. Puppies are even harder, especially if you actually train them well."

Advice,fdi3kv5,t1_fdhokdn,1578435119.0,"The main reason I went back is because people told me that they got very good shots of an incident in the parking lot and that they might’ve gotten new cameras, and after my last complaint maybe they had made sure the camera didn’t have a blind spot."
Advice,fdhyuus,t1_fdhokat,1578432658.0,"They said they had no other spots available, and honestly I would be fine if they had just put in their handbook before I decided to pay for parking that they wouldn’t be taking responsibility for damages. Instead, I get strung along that they’re actually going to help and instead they do nothing."
singing,fd9vzpt,t3_ekdxrw,1578238727.0,"- Make sure your mouth is open, I know when I first started to learning how to sing with power I was always constricting my mouth. 
- Take a short deep breathe as soon as possible before big notes, that way you’ll have the breath support to hit them and hold them. 
- Everything should be coming from your diaphragm, not your throat. If your throat hurts after doing it, you’re doing it wrong (unless you’re sick, then you just shouldn’t be singing at all).
- Always warm up before trying to hit high notes, do lip trill scales slowly getting higher until you’re trilling the notes the song hits. Then, trill the song. 

Im still working in my belting, so this definitely is not everything you’ll need to know, and I’m also still just a student, though I have been taking lessons for years now, but take what I say with a grain of salt, and consult a teacher if you’re having major problems. This is just some of the things I’ve learned over the years.

Edit: formatting"
IWantToLearn,fd9uhik,t3_ek8cyx,1578238214.0,"Always do vocal warm ups before you sing, it’ll improve your singing session and stretches your vocal chords before you sing to prevent damage. As for technique, follow YouTube videos. 

Some of my favorite tips:
- Breath support: use a straw to breathe in as much air as possible and then breathe out (all through the straw). Repeat a few times to really connect to your breath.
- Hitting the notes correctly: Do lip trills (the bbbb sound of blowing out through your lips when they’re closed) of scales and your favorite songs. Idk why it works, but singing a song/note after trilling it first makes it come out easier and nicer.
- Proper placement/power: Your singing should be coming from your breath, not by pushing it out your throat. Always engage your diaphragm and abdominals to push the breath out. Always take a short but deep breath whenever you can get one in. Also be sure to create space in your mouth, especially when hitting notes on the edges of your range. You may feel like you need to contort your mouth into some weird closed shape in order to hit that high note, but I promise you it will come out a lot better and a lot easier if you open your mouth. 

Disclaimer: I’m not a teacher, but I have been taking singing lessons for 4 years and all these tips have significantly improved my singing. Be patient yet persistent, don’t over exert your vocal chords, and build up your confidence. You could be the best singer in the world, but being nervous can make you forget all your techniques and cause your voice to be shaky. If you mess up, don’t worry, no one really cares if you make a few mistakes."
Meditation,fd9sl0p,t3_ek87t2,1578237570.0,"I consider myself to be more of a casual person when it comes to meditation, I like shorter sessions that focus on something specific. I use the Stop, Breathe, and Think app. If it hadn’t been for this app, I never would’ve stuck with meditation."

DecidingToBeBetter,fcjelx9,t1_fcaq8w8,1577684849.0,"If you’ve ever tried to floss soon after eating something like wings where it leaves so much stuff stuck in your teeth, it’s so much easier to floss if you brush first to get the worst parts out."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcaj5tn,t1_fc9st4j,1577570178.0,"Nice job! I also have a success story with flossing.

I used to have poor dental hygiene, not horrendous, but I would go a few days using gum instead of brushing my teeth at times (gross, I know). I decided I needed to change and started bringing around floss picks to, at the very least, get the gunk out after I eat. Soon, it became something I enjoyed doing, and I realized flossing was even easier when I brushed my teeth. Now I floss and brush all the time, I still miss a night or morning here or there but it was such a helpful habit to get into."

Periods,fc3doo9,t3_efuecd,1577387504.0,"I’d say try period underwear, that way you don’t have to worry about spilling over. I have super light periods but still end up with it pooling in the wrong places from how I sit. Haven’t gotten around to getting any myself but it’s definitely on my list when I have the money."
AmItheAsshole,fbx3q0c,t3_eeosdx,1577168111.0,"NTA, your mom should be considerate of the fact she can’t eat pork, even if your gf only had a sensitivity. All dietary restrictions should be taken seriously, such as not eating something for moral reasons, hating the food, sensitivities, and especially full blown allergies. Your mom could another recipe without the pork, or make something for your girlfriend specifically, like a cut of meat that can easily be cooked in the oven or on the stove."
