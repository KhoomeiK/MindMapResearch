With the bloat added in terms of potions, chests, and scrolls, a lot of this stuff is pushed way past the magical $5 price point many of us refuse to go past.

We'd be fine paying the $5 simply for that shiny new item or skin or familiar, but being forced to buy all the bloat makes the ""deal"" undesirable to the majority of us.

I even have most of the stuff that went on sale since it was reduced down to that level, but then you have things that on sale are still $10, which will never be bought by me or some other people.

I don't like the idea of ""loot boxes"", and this is exactly what is happening with these sales. We are gambling on chests when we would be more than happy purchasing specific items. And saying ""well, you are buying specific items"" is disingenuous since they are also tied to the loot boxes."

But basically you have a starting point, which would be the earliest point."
idlechampions,fecqv5j,t3_eodss6,1578981248.0,"This has always been my issue in the game. I do a favor until I can get all the buffs, and then I switch to the next one. But then new things are released (like Dragonbait) and suddenly I am trying to figure if I should abandon Tiamat at the moment and try to work on Kelemvor again. But then I start thinking about all the patron stuff and whether I can even make it far in Kelemvor using Patron characters.

Then there's also how far I can get without potions and without active-clicking, and if I should wait for a specific weekend buff lineup, and all this other nonsense.

It's pretty overwhelming with all the extra stuff. Especially if you are terrible at the game like I am."

idlechampions,fecd32u,t3_eo63tc,1578971085.0,I agree. Though sometimes it's fun to see an event come around that you haven't done in a year and then see whatever the saved formation was back then. It's usually something awful.
videos,fec68cx,t1_febzt69,1578967320.0,"I love how people make stupid assumptions on reddit ""she probably laughed and hung up"" vs ""she obviously didn't know who he was"".

People don't like to go with the actual evidence presented and love pretending to be in other peoples' heads. That's why when there is a story of some crime, people immediately start assigning guilt or making claims that were never given in the story.

But if I try to say ""hold on, the given circumstances were A, B, and C"" and then suddenly people start saying I am an ""apologist"" or whatever from whatever crime has been committed. It's pretty laughable."

So I decided to show the movies to my girlfriend. A week ago we watched Tremors 1, which was just pure cheese, but in a great way. Then the next day we watched Tremors 2 and it was still enjoyable like OP said.

Then a couple days ago we saw Tremors 3, and that movie was a travesty. We'll be watching 4 and 5 here in the next few days or so, but I am fearful."

I was thinking that too. Getting lots of upvotes doesn't equal ""viral"". It's when news stations are picking it up, and it's starting to be spread over more platforms. And when he said ""going viral"" it was at 400 or so upvotes. I've ""gone viral"" multiple times and nobody knew about it then."
television,fe2v3wi,t1_fe2swsc,1578843187.0,"It's not about being ""entitled"". CBS shouldn't have a fucking streaming site. It's one of ""The Big 3"". ABC, CBS, and NBC have always been the Big 3 television networks.

I am not saying we should get Disney for free because it owns ABC. I am not talking about all the channels under the same umbrellas as these Big 3. I am specifically speaking about these specific channels.

Go ahead and bullshit and say it's not CBS All Access. Call it something else. But you name something CBS, we expect to get it like we get CBS."
