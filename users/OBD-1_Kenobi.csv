explainlikeimfive,ff7q82j,t3_ertczx,1579655702.0,"To make this simple, we can think of an electron just like a wave on the surface of a body of water. Let's even make our own tiny planet that has nothing else on it. It is just a small ocean planet. The surface of the water is constantly rippling and sloshing about all over the planet.

Let's say for a moment there is one wave on the surface. I ask you where it is. You look and see that, well, the wave is taking up a relatively large volume and there isn't even exactly a solid boundary where the wave stops and the calm surface resumes. To a scientist, that entire volume, fuzzy boundaries and all, says where you are most likely to interact with the electron. Say the highest peak in the crest of the wave is where you are the most likely to interact with the electron, and at the fuzzy boundary, you are less likely to interact with it.

Even though a scientist may be able to narrow down the orbital ""position"" to a high probability, the total energy of the electron has potential all around the atom in what they refer to as a ""cloud."""

explainlikeimfive,ff26l7n,t3_er77x6,1579495264.0,"They are two different things happening, but one part is connected. A wood or gasoline fire is a chemical reaction. The fire is hot gas (CO2, water vapor, etc., and also is sometimes actually plasma, but we're staying eli5) and soot and the color of the flame depends on two things: what was in the thing that is burning, and how hot it is burning.

With molten steel, the only part of that which matters is the temperature. Everything, even you, constantly radiates light. Most of the time, things only glow in infrared. That is why night-vision goggles use infrared. Remember the colors of a rainbow. It starts with red. Red color has the lowest energy of visible light, and infrared has slightly less energy than that. When you heat something up, its energy increases and so does the light it lets out. When something gets hot enough, it will emit visible light starting with red. If it gets hotter and hotter you will go up the rainbow emitting all the colors. So if you're looking at a pool of molten steel, the parts closer to yellow or orange will be hotter than the redder parts.

To tie that back to the flames: if you look at even just a candle, you can see that the flame has different colors. It's hottest, and blue, right on the wick where the reaction is taking place and hottest, then the tip of the flame is more yellow or red.

If you want to get a little more than eli5 on your own, the term for temperature-based color is called black-body radiation."
