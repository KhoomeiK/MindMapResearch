DMV,fef564u,t3_eotmyt,1579048430.0,"IIRC, the issue date is the business day\* that the payment/application was processed, and the expiration date is always the birthday, +5 years. 

\*if the payment is done online, after 5, etc... it will post the next business day after that."

Lyft,fdxr61l,t1_fdxn09j,1578772109.0,"They all have their moments of ""extreme brilliance"""
Lyft,fdxr3rj,t1_fdxe7y4,1578772085.0,"They do, but they have fairly poor paper record keeping. Especially when the next renter will go to take the car out, and then notices damage; which implied that either I caused the damaged or there was damage while the car was in the custody of National--between rentals."
Lyft,fdx6u0q,t1_fdwh1fz,1578765915.0,"I would like to point out the National isn't much better. I'm a fairly frequent renter and I have been dinged with various damage claims. In fact, I'm still fighting a damage claim from October with National. I had rented a QX60 up in the Bay Area, and a few days after I returned the car, I was dinged with $380 in damages. I responded to their claim with the photos from when I returned the car showing that the damage that they claimed was not there, so it was someone else's damage. They persisted, so I sent them a letter (always CMRRR- Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested) in Mid-October that I'm contesting their claim. 

Fast forward to December, I contacted my CC company to dispute and I sent them the photos. They are currently dealing with National. 

My worst experience was with Sixt where they came back after 10 months to claim that I needed to pay for a tire and a wheel off of a Mercedes-Benz C class...even though the size of the tire and wheel can only be found on the E and S classes. 

&#x200B;

TL/DR:

* Always dispute in writing, with certified mail, return receipt requested
* All rental car company can be black holes of information"
