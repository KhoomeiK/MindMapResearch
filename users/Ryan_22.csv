todayilearned,ffe5inv,t1_ffe53d8,1579837242.0,"Honestly, I'm not convinced it does, or that it's noticeable enough that most people would know the difference. Most animals eaten were already stressed and their well-being was sacrificed leading up to their arrival at the killing floor. See my edit above. In a double blind test, I seriously doubt anyone could tell the difference."
todayilearned,ffe4sbj,t1_ffe3zp5,1579836693.0,"If that works right the first time, which it often doesn't. Of course, this also is only talking about the animals intended to be eaten that make it the slaughterhouse alive. Slaughterhouses often have a number of ""downers"" (animals that die in transport due to the shit conditions), ""thumpers"" (animals killed by being bashed into the ground), and whatever you call the male chicks that are thrown into the grinders alive.

The well-being of the animal is often the first thing sacrificed in the name of productivity.

EDIT: actually, this brings up another point. The transportation for the animals is also terrible. So the animals are usually pretty stressed by the time they go the killing floor. So it's not like the bolt killing them quickly is preventing stress that would affect the taste. The animal was likely already stressed when it got there (dehydrated, cold/hot, cramped space, etc.)."

todayilearned,ffe3bfw,t1_ffdzmwr,1579835599.0,">Is livestock slaughtered humanely?

Mostly, no. The slaughterhouse's main concern is to turn a living animal into packaged meat as quickly as possible. While there are standards set forth for this, they're fairly weak and poorly enforced. There's a reason they really don't want people seeing what goes on in there."
science,ffduqv2,t1_ffdszj5,1579829417.0,"That's true. But in this case, we're talking about something that many other countries have decided is not a right. And not just countries that are known for violating human rights. We're talking about many prosperous, developed countries with excellent human rights records. 

Saying that it's not a right (or to what degree) is one thing - then you're recognizing other countries' ability (right?) to govern and legislate it as they please.

But arguing that it is a right, and one that other countries are not recognizing, is a substantial claim. So far that claim has not seen much support worldwide."
