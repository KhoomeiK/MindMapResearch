Vacations,fcwdsra,t1_fcuuo5x,1578023098.0,"You didn't even mention that Hollywood Studios has Galaxys Edge? I know not everyone is a Star Wars person but I wouldn't be surprised if that's at the top of the list for these kids...

Your rating of ""good rides"" is entirely based on YOUR trip style. Maybe these kids love Nemo and want to see the show vs ride roller coasters. You're giving advice from the adult couple perspective. 🤦‍♀️"
Vacations,fcwdcn0,t1_fcutkt9,1578022793.0,The hotel day is the waste... you can pretend that half day at each park isn't enough but the point isn't to do/see everything. You clearly haven't visited the parks in a while or you assume that the children involved would be interested in every single thing. Its possible to effectively see everything relevant to that age group in 4 half day chunks with fastpasses and a bit of a plan. You can almost double your experience if you're willing to wake up early while on vacation and if you walk quickly.

Vacations,fcmwidm,t3_ehmw1s,1577795453.0,"I want to help with this but as a Disney World veteran, I cannot even consider only one day at Disney. Theres 4 parks, a downtown area with shopping, two water parks plus just getting around takes a bit too. Skip the hotel day and be in the parks, especially if you have family time planned to relax. 

This post kinda frustrates me coming from a Disney trip person and even more so as someone who is an avid road tripper (I drive from Massachusetts to Florida a whole lot) so I get trying to squeeze everything in after you've driven so far. I dont reccommend staying in 1 park per day. Theres so many aspects I could go into but I wont (you can DM me questions if youd like) 

My suggestion is: 2 days at Disney with a half day in each park and 1 universal day for Harry Potter"
