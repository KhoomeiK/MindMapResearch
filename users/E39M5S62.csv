Late last year, the project maintainers decided to move to a Linux base. This beta release is the second release of that. The project settled on Void Linux. Everything they're using in the beta release (with the exception of zfsbootmenu) is part of the official Void repositories. That effectively makes Project Trident Void a nice root-on-ZFS installer for Void.

I plan on contributing a package for ZFSBootMenu to Void - for development/testing speed I've been packaging it on my own private repository as I work with the Project Trident team."

I absolutely love my Blackbird. It's extremely capable as a desktop/workstation system under Void.

I didn't have an EpiPen at that point in my life, but I knew I was deathly allergic. I spent the night getting pumped full of drugs and puking my guts out.

A few years after that, I was driving into work on I90 in Chicago and I had an allergic reaction to something. I pulled off into a highway maintenance depot and barely got the vehicle into park in the entrance to the depot. A highway patrolman came over VERY annoyed that I parked there, but when he saw that I couldn't talk or well .. do anything .. he started trying to help me. I had an EpiPen in my laptop bag, but I was unable to open the bag or even administer it at that point. The patrolman used the pen on my leg, on the ground of the depot. He saved my life.

Common side effects of epinephrine include: vomiting, nausea, upset stomach. In other words ... you'll be puking and shitting your brains out. 

Yes, Christy, you can eat whatever you want. But suggesting that a person with allergies eat whatever they crave is tantamount to telling a person that it's okay to commit suicide. Get fucked you horrible bitch."
