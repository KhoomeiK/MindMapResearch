The company I work for supplies power tools, so mine is just for at home and I haven't used it a lot (also just got it in December) but I've had no issue with kick back or binding.

Tinder,feyu9wh,t1_fewos36,1579450598.0,"It was and I don't see why that should stand out.

I know the internet loves to shit all over men for their bad behavior in dating but women do many the same things. I've had women stand me up (more than once), ghost me (more times than I can count), internet stalk me, demand a date even when they know I'm seeing someone else, use the threat of dating me to pressure their partner into moving in together (not that I was told that up front) and hold me in reserve while they see if things are going to work out with someone they like better."

VictoriaBC,fev7mo1,t3_eqnza8,1579394137.0,"I'm not in the least bit surprised. I know many great pet owners but there are just too many terrible ones out there.

A few years ago I was riding my bike through Fairfield and saw a guy walking his dog off leash, but it seemed very well behaved.

He was a bit further ahead than his dog, who stopped to poop. I didn't think he saw that happen, so I let him know.

He said ""Why don't you mind your own fucking business?"" and kept on walking.

And people wonder why I don't allow pets in my rentals. If you asked that very guy if he always picked up after his dog, I'll be be will tell you how he always does. If you took a survey of 1000 dog owners I'll bet exactly zero of them would admit to not picking up after their dog.

But the amount of shit I see on the street, and pick up out of my front yard, tells me that there is no shortage of dog owners who think they're above it all."

Tinder,feus8tc,t1_fesmn07,1579389424.0,"I was getting ready for a date and I got a call from my father. My very old grandmother was in the hospital recently, and she lives out of province, but my aunt had just been to visit her and got all that details about her condition from the doctor. So he told me it would be a good time to call my aunt and I could get all caught up on the details. 

I messaged my date to tell her I was going to be a bit late and why. She seemed okay with it. 

I called my aunt and we went over what the doctor said. It was nothing urgent or life threatening, as we suspected, so I went on with my day.

I arrived at the appointed coffee shop, about fifteen minutes late. She was sitting on the patio having a drink. I walked up to introduce myself and she immediately told me not to bother. She said if I can't respect her enough to show up on time then she has no interest in me. I told her again why I was late but she would have none of it. 

I felt exactly the way you did: glad we got that out of the way now. If someone can't handle fifteen minutes late, let alone for something as important as family in the hospital, then I can see anything lasting long term with them."
Tinder,feuf1u8,t1_feu51oo,1579385942.0,"Not in my case. I had seen her on dating sites before and since. She used to be the receptionist where I bought my insurance and my old neighbour, an adjuster, knew her from around the industry. In my case she was definitely a real person. 

I also heard that she was in love with my neighbour and told people they were meant to be together and he was going to leave his wife for her. I can say with total certainty that was never going to happen. 

I'm sure she wouldn't describe it as such, but later she lightly internet stalked me and started sending me messages (about how we should go on a date) on other websites. Even when I told her I was seeing someone she insisted that it's just a date and it would be fine. Despite having no success messaging me on Facebook years ago, she sent me a friend request a few months ago.

I actually think she's just very socially inept, and for some reason really wants to date me, and I hope one day she finds the right person."
Tinder,fes604d,t3_eqfkbf,1579361801.0,"That happened to me once. It was before I had a smartphone.

I came home from being out and I logged in to whatever dating site I was on at the time and saw four messages:

Do you want to meet for a drink after work?

How about [location] and [time]?

I'm here, waiting at a table for you.

Where the fuck are you? I've been waiting half an hour!

I told her that I just got home and saw all the messages; I also suggested she wait for confirmation before going to meet someone."
MilwaukeeTool,ferymfm,t3_eqftjy,1579359675.0,"I've found that bags tend to take up less room than hard boxes, but I still prefer hard boxes.

The greatest strength of Packout is transportation. Mine are for my home/personal tools, so they don't travel much but I still really like Packout.

Some tools fit very nicely in the boxes (drills and drivers) while others (sander) do not. The sander is too tall for the small toolbox so it has to go in the large toolbox, but that's a fairly large box and it's going to have to share with other tools. That is a tool that might be better in a bag."

But the new owner was already fifty when she bought it and I think she stopped caring about the house in the seventies or eighties.

She died in 2008 and I bought the house. Unfortunately I got divorced soon after and my decision to keep the house has stained me financially and I haven't been able to get it done, as much as I want to.

Except for the porch, which was redone at some point, it's all original, one coat of lead paint.
