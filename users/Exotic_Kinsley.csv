Needafriend,fda1apd,t3_ek8mth,1578240542.0,"I feel you with this one, it's incredibly difficult to find genuine people in these kinds of subreddits. So many people put ""lonely"" ""depressed"" ""need someone to talk to"", then you hit them up send a message and either they don't respond at all, which is completely understandable given their circumstances or they DO respond but then they immediately ghost you right after."
depression,fd4ahrb,t3_ejsoej,1578165793.0,So true. All they say is it's going to be better or what not and then when you just can't take it anymore everyone acts like they actually gave a shit.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcpdrj7,t1_fcpdjrf,1577859679.0,"No clue, if you're going to stop talking why even bother post. The only thing I can think of is that they may just think you're boring or dry so they stop responding."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcpdff2,t1_fcpd51x,1577859293.0,"Yeah it does suck, I've met people who seemed interesting, talk for a bit and then they just stop and don't respond anymore. It's incredibly annoying."
depression,fcm8n5w,t3_ehvibt,1577767177.0,"If you've done it, then I wish you great peace my friend. We love you, and I hope you can finally be at peace with yourself. If you are still breathing and you're on the verge of ending it, don't. Life sucks now and I know you've been suffering. The negatives always outweigh the positives, but despite that as clich√© as it sounds, life will get better. Focus on the here and now, forget about the past and don't get too ahead in the future. God has plans for you, and in order to make it happen he has to take some pieces and move them around to make your life better. We all struggle. I'm right there with you. You may leave this sub but don't leave this planet. You don't know how many lives you could've changed, how many people you've made smile or how many kids you were going to have if you end it right here. Keep going. I believe in you."

depression,fc2maxb,t3_efj7ls,1577366900.0,"It really sucks. I remember not getting anything for Christmas but didn't complain because I was having fun and enjoyed how life was for me back then. Every Christmas I feel the same emptiness, like how everyone gets presents and what not and people in joy while I'm there sitting out wishing something would change. What tear me apart the most was when I realized that even when I was a child I didn't get anything for Christmas, it always bothered me because the other kids in class would ramble on about what they got and how happy they were. I felt like I wasn't loved by my family and it always brought me down. I didn't want to be greedy always asking for things but I've been working hard to change my life for the better. It just feels like my family hasn't treated me like everyone else when I was a kid and so I always had those thoughts that pull me back. Especially during holiday season it's just horrible. The sense of feeling not worthy, feeling like you never accomplished anything it's tough. Hopefully 2020 will be the year of growth. End of a decade, start of another. Wishing all of you the best! üôè"
