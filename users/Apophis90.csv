I understand wanting to be compensated for the materials and labor hours but, to ask for Â£2,500 from your own family is ridiculous. She's essentially going to get paid TWICE for what that one painting would be sold for. She must be really falling on hard times to ask her sister for that much money for a unsold painting. I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this even though the sister and nephew are clearly in the wrong, sometimes you gotta bite the bullet for family. ESH."

To sterilize the cup, it needs to stay in boiling water for ~10minutes. It's not like, as soon as it reaches boiling, it's instantly and magically clean. Kettles turn themselves off once reaching boiling point so it might be 100Â°C for a few seconds but, not long enough to clean it.

Even if you were able to boil it to sterilization, the fact you think its normal / acceptable to use cooking materials for bodily fluid is just revolting. I feel like you must be trolling and if that's the case, well done."
