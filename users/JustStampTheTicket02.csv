Since you basically say that the complexity is what makes it Jacob, would you say Time To Rest Your Weary Head is not Jacob? It's not very dense or complex, in fact it's simplicity is what makes it work so well for me (although it works in the context of this dense album pulling away to this simple song). If this guy wants to cover Jacob's music then he doesn't have to adhere to a strict set of rules determining whether or not it's Jacob-like. Do like Jacob, enjoy the music"

CNN is also very biased, of course it is, but pivoting the argument to something else just makes you look like an idiot because you can't actually defend yourself so you've got to attack the others instead. Also, the other person never mentioned CNN. Who knows what they think of CNN?
