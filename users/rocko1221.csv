I wish Netflix could bring back the animated series and Batman beyond."

AmItheAsshole,feeq3l4,t3_eopd7q,1579038833.0,"NTA- the American healthcare system is the real asshole here. Living in ""the greatest country in the world"" and seconds after breaking a bone, you have to decide against an ambulance because you know it'll cost too much. Healthcare in a medical emergency like that is a human right. Sucks you had to even be in that situation. Something similar happened to me except mine is very embarrassing.
