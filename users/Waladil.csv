I can understand people who have already committed crimes losing some rights to privacy and being databased, but that's a lot different than making a universal rule.

changemyview,fe68kok,t1_fe67abg,1578884150.0,"Yep, almost every, if not actually every country does have a history of human rights abuses. It's an awful good reason to oppose mass government profiling. 

You've proposed exactly zero effective means of ensuring the safety of these databases. Again, the country you used as an example did a genocide just twenty-five years ago. Somewhere between 500,000 and 1,000,000 died in a genocide that was based purely on race and ethnicity. 

As someone else pointed out, China is using DNA databases to facilitate genocide now.

I'm in the USA and I wouldn't trust my government with my DNA (and I'm a white cisgendered male -- literally the most privileged group! Odds of me getting genocided are really slim). It seems obvious that Germany shouldn't be trusted because, you know, Nazis. China is obviously untrustworthy. Australia and Canada both did some significant genocides against their respective indigenous groups, including some pretty recent horrors so they're right out. These are all just off the top of my head, I'm not even looking. Russia might not commit a racial genocide but they'll find something else horrible to do with it.

changemyview,fe5xaje,t3_enwf6x,1578877010.0,"Any government with a history of human rights abuses cannot be trusted with a nationwide DNA database.

Simply enough: Imagine how much worse the Holocaust would have been if the Nazis had a DNA database. Either they'd identify ""the Jew gene"" or they'd pick a gene and pretend its ""the Jew gene."" It probably wouldn't be accurate in any way, but it wouldn't stop them from rounding up everyone with that gene and adding them to the death count.

Rwanda has a history of genocide. It was just twenty-five years ago and is called ""The Rwandan Genocide."" I'd expect that Tutsi survivors would be pretty uncomfortable submitting their DNA to a government that murdered their people based on race.

Even in well-meaning societies, it's all too easy for such databases to be accidentally misused. If I walked through an alley, scratched my head and left a few hairs behind, then a crime got committed there, suddenly I could be hunted down through the database and arrested."

When looking at housing they're probably looking more at whether you can pay the added monthly payments than the dollar value of the whole house.

Paying off debt is probably superior, because that reduces your other monthly payments -- if you could afford $500 in other debt payments 3 months ago and paid them all off, it's easier to believe that you cal probably afford $1000 in mortgage payments now, than $1500 in mortgage and your outstanding debts.

That said, credit companies have *A LOT* of information about your income nowadays. If you actually can afford the existing debt and mortgage payments, they'll figure that out and you're hamstringing yourself on down payment negotiation.

Iran can say ""if we successfully get a nuke, then the USA will leave us alone for fear we blow up Tel-Aviv. Therefore, we want a nuke. However, if we try to get a nuke, the USA and the rest of NATO will murder us eighteen ways from Friday. Therefore, our most secure route is to secretly get a nuke."" Lo and behold, that's basically exactly what's been happening. Simplified, of course. The secretly worked on a nuke, but secret is slow. We secretly fought them, with things like the virus mentioned above. Generally this went pretty well for the US. 

Unless of course the above logic changes. If they think the US will attack more directly regardless of their nuclear progression, the limiting statement disappears and it becomes a race to become nuclear-equipped as fast as possible. I said earlier secret is slow. If they stop being secretive, they speed up a lot, and the US will be forced either to let Iran get the bomb or invade outright, and either outcome is very bad for everyone involved. 

Of course, knowing that might mean Iran still doesn't openly work on getting a nuke. They might still consider the risk of an invasion to be worse than suffering additional strikes like the one on Soleimani. Right now it looks like they're threatening starting a non-secret nuclear program so they're basically at this same point of logic as I've lined out so far. If the US backs down just a little bit and says ""OK, OK, that was over the line. Won't happen again, unless you actually start that nuke,"" then we can return to the secretive status quo, which again was pretty good for the US."

Switzerland didn't get pulled into WW2 because it played nice with both sides, providing a neutral black market. You're not using a realist perspective, you're using a cynical perspective. Especially in the realm of international relations in the 21st century, being the aggressor is *hard.* Your people don't want a war, and the international community is watching."

worldnews,fdfmac4,t1_fdfl7z6,1578364987.0,"It's a question of belief and perception of relative threats. If they (Iranian government) believes that we (US government) will play relatively nice and only go 10% against them if they stay away from nukes, then they could see the rationality in refraining from nuclear weapons. But if we shed that restraint -- or even look like we're likely to -- then it's no longer rational for them to hold back either.

It's like a father play-wrestling with their child. Obviously, the grown adult would win if they tried, so they hold back a lot. Similarly, a small child will (hopefully) understand that there are certain things you still don't do to win: don't bite your dad's ear. But if their father stopped holding back and actually started to hurt the kid, I don't think anyone would be surprised if the child bit as hard as they could."

However, our (in this case ""The US government with the power to interfere with foreign powers and their capacity to develop nuclear firepower"") reasons are not the same as my reasons. Their reasons are to ensure ongoing military hegemony in nuclear and conventional fields. 

My reasoning is that giant bombs that kill millions are terrifying in anyone's hands."
