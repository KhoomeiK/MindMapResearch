There are certainly some aspects that have made things better: immediate access to information, the ability to collaborate globally, the ability to share things globally, the ability to *see* things happening around the world instantly... all good things that have done wonderful things.

However with that has come a great deal of negative. I'm not just talking social media, which itself is a shit-hole. I'm talking the *always connectedness*. When I was growing up, even into the early 2000's, if you wanted to reach someone, you sent them a letter, you called and left a message, you waited to hear back from them. Now, because we KNOW everyone has their phone on them 24/7/365 not responding immediately is a personal insult. Disconnecting is an impossibility. Work knows this too. I know too many people who are systems administrators who have lost their marriages because *even on a beach in Tahiti, they're on their computer fixing something*.

People don't talk to one another any more. People view memes as like legitimate forms of communication. People refuse to read long form journalism. If it's not digestible in 1.5 seconds it's to be ignored. People's self esteem comes from fake internet points.

I love having all this information and ability to collaborate. However, I think overall it has sucked the ever loving humanity out of people... everyone is a giant asshole now and they have no problems with it.

I think, if I was given the choice tomorrow... I would probably get rid of it. I think overall the cons outweigh the pros. Even now I'm finding I scale back my internet use.

> I think you either just don’t limit mag capacity or if you do the logical place to set a limit would seem to be at 30 rounds.

I don't see why you can't work with limiting magazine size to what it was designed for and not allowing expansion magazines. If a gun manufacturer designs a particular weapon to default with 30-rounds, then that is it's maximum. If it's 8 rounds in a pistol, then putting on an extension to go above it's intended design would be a problem. It puts the onus then on the manufacturer to determine what design standard there is.

> I think you either just don’t limit mag capacity or if you do the logical place to set a limit would seem to be at 30 rounds.

> Besides some high capacity .22 guns and those odd and rare helical top mag guns I can’t think of any guns that come standard with mags larger than 30 rounds.

You do contradict yourself here by suggesting that the ""logical limit"" be 30 then talking about how some arms have standard mags larger than 30. Why does 30 be the ""logical"" limit, more so than what the standard design of the particular weapon is?"

Aircraft that are fully loaded with fuel for a trans-pacific flight are too heavy to land safely without a huge risk of the landing gear collapsing under the stress and the plane turning into an enormous fire-ball.

If the plane did not have the ability to fly out to a designated area and altitude for a fuel dump maneuver, I doubt the Control would advocate dumping fuel at low altitude over populated areas, which is extremely dangerous. There would have likely been an order to fly to another airport instead of returning to LAX, or initiate some other emergency procedure (e.g. prepare for water landing). If the situation was so dangerous to prevent following the fuel dump protocol then it was too dangerous to do a return to airport.

The pilot made some serious lapses in judgement. Either because he got scared shitless or just didn't care. Either way, his ass is grass and the FAA is busting out the lawn mowers."
changemyview,fekeh75,t3_epmx5x,1579198351.0,"I will start off by saying I'm a socialist, but I completely do not accept this viewpoint that accelerationism is a valid philosophy.

Accelerationism represents a ""Scorched Earth"" philosophy, or ""the end justifies the means"" - regardless of the damage that occurs as long as the end is what is desired then it's all good. To me this is an incredibly selfish and self-defeating ideology that only ends in more suffering and has no assurance of a ""socialist revolution"" taking place. It makes a lot of assumptions without much backing.

Furthermore, in situations where we have seen this tactic be utilized, the end result was disastrous for countless people, and resulted in authoritarianism under a red banner.

Climate Change is an entirely separate view that will require immediate change, but not accelerationism toward the Fascist end of the spectrum, which will inevitably do more damage. The only way to handle climate change is immediate collaboration and shift toward the appropriate socio-economic changes (not waiting for things to get bad enough for 'the proletariate' to revolt).

Finally, this tactic as a philosophy originated prior to things like nuclear weapons and the enormous global reach of most modern militaries, especially the United States.

When I was working for a global multinational, everyone traveling was required to keep all of their company secure documents on corporate cloud accessible only by VPN. Laptops also had a lockdown feature where if you entered a specific easy to remember phrase (like ""compromise"") it rendered the encrypted drive inaccessible by destroying the decryption key.

If for any reason you chose not to utilize that, you were fired. 

It actually got to the point where employees going to/from China just took completely reformatted laptop with them that had nothing on it but basic software and the VPN, and still they typed in the compromised password before leaving the hotel.

Even a few developers working on specific projects began doing it for domestic travel as well. They were kind of paranoid but with everything on the corporate cloud it was worth it in their eyes."

I can count the number of times that looking back though, had I had been armed, I probably would have gotten more involved or done something boneheaded had I had it, but because I didn't carry I didn't get myself into a situation I would have needed it.

Recently I talked down a neighbor who was drunk and getting violent, and later found out from police that he was carrying a knife, but I got him to calm down and leave the house before he killed someone in his family.

As a gun instructor in a safety class I took a long time ago drilled in: **If you don't feel safe without a gun, you're not safe with one**. My 9MM is a tool, a specific tool for specific circumstances if they ever come to pass.

Most democrats aren't Anti-Gun, but damn it people have done a great job of making something of nuance into a black/white issue.

People trotted this accusation out in Colorado when Democrats pushed through gun regulations like... gasp, background checks and closing loopholes, limiting magazine size, and other common-sense measures that try to strike a balance between ""free-for-all gun rights"" and ""no just outright ban"".
