BabyBumps,fdbi7bo,t1_fcp3ofr,1578257613.0,"That is precisely true. I have seen a woman break down and be destroyed for 2 years due to finding out their unborn baby has anencephaly. She chose to have the pregnancy terminated because the baby would not survive for more than an hour or so after birth. This absolutely destroyed her, and yet, she felt it best to prevent suffering for all parties involved.

And yet, there are creeps like the one OP ran into that would just say they were a murderer. It's horrible. They always seem to think everyone is just going around getting abortions for fun."

I mean the Iranian guy was pretty evil but starting a war is only going to make things worse."
investing,fcwz1wj,t1_fcwxcid,1578043814.0,"I agree; the capital doesn't disappear. My statement alludes to the fact that while it does raise the stock price due to less shares being available in the pool, perhaps it would be more worthwhile to direct some of that money into making the business stronger through investment in their employees, through pay raises, training, or other methods. These are long term ways of ensuring that employees, along with their experience and skills, remain at the employer. The debt associated with employee turnover is not always obvious immediately, and may only rear its head when it has severely progressed, creating an uphill battle to relearn that which has walked out the door. In some cases, even the loss of unskilled labor can be disruptive, although it is far less likely for that to be an issue from which to recover. Additionally, you could also argue that increasing the spending power of employees (if there is capital available) is good for the economy as a whole. You could say then that those employees should be purchasing their employers stock to share in the success of the company, and you're right...for those that can afford it or are aware of that important method of building wealth.

That is what I mean by short term gains. There are obviously situations where it does not apply, but I think that at most companies, there are people who leave a large hole in the company's knowledge base when they leave. In essence, I'm suggesting that in SOME cases, it is more worthwhile to invest in your human capital, rather than repurchasing shares, because in the long term, it might be better for the investors. However, by the time someone realizes there is an issue and people have left, the stock price has been increased, certain investors have gotten theirs, so what do they care, and the rest are left holding the bag."
