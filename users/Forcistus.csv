You're not doing anything wrong, but it is understandable why your new girlfriend is not entirely comfortable with the situation. Dogs are not quite like kids so it is difficult for people outside of your relationship with the dog to understand how important it can be. While you are obviously simply doing this because you love your dog, she can see this as a reason to hang out with your exe every once in a while and that makes her uncomfortable and insecure. 



Maybe you should consider her offer to get a new dog with her? It might be time to move on from your old relationship with the previous dog."

This, to me, reads as a discussion her father and his wife wish to have with her about her lifestyle. This is not the same as they don't care about what she thinks, they feel that she is not making good life choices that she will probably regret. Again, that doesn't seem hard to believe when OP chose to call herself a damaged person as well as her perception of herself that she will ruin someone else's life if she was in a relationship with them. This says a lot about her self worth and I would agree with her parents that her lifestyle is not healthy. Not because she is choosing to live her life without monogamy, but because of what her mental state is during it and it seems to be self destructive behavior. This is not to say all people who engage in sex with several different partners a week are unhealthy, but it doesn't seem to be healthy behavior in OPs case.

When they attempted to have a discussion with OP, rather than explain herself or simply tell them that she was fine the way she was, she choose to make it person and lash out with something intended to hurt them. That is AH behavior. The intent of the others was not to hurt or even shame OP but to express concern about her.   
OP could have told them that she knew what she was doing and was doing so safely, but she choose to not and behave like a petulant child.   


People, especially our parents (not OPs parents, but parents in general), are going to question our life choices from time to time. When people love and/or care about you, this becomes more common. Simply because someone approaches us about an aspect of our life that they think is unhealthy does not give us leave to attack a part of their life we think is wrong.

ESH



I don't think it's necessary to explain why your mom/sisters were in the wrong because I think that is self evident and you already know this. But try to look at it from their perspective for a minute. They love you and they see your serious relationship end suddenly and you completely shut them out as to why. That is concerning behavior from anyone. They obviously have a relationship with your ex so she spins the tale however she wants. You're not willing to offer your side of the story so they believe her.

They aren't doing this to pry, they're doing this because they are concerned for you. And then, when they try to get a meeting, you runaway through the bathroom window like a crazy person. 



The reason this situation got to this point is because you never respected anyone else enough to confide in them and bottled up your pain until your loved ones tried to intervene on your behalf. Then, at the critical moment, instead of handling it maturely you run through the bathroom window. Which is a but ironic because I can't think of a more humiliating exit from a family gathering. You look like a TA to your family. You have to talk. Maybe the whole story is not necessary, but you can't runaway from your problems. Do you really think there was nothing you could do in that situation except shutdown and runaway through the bathroom?
