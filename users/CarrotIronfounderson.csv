That said, there's a reason many of us progressives consider ourselves pro second amendment, while also being pro gun control. There's no reason you can't have both. Strengthen existing laws and enforcing, fix laws like face to face sales without background checks (""gunshow loophole"").

There was gun control in place during the times of our founding fathers who wrote the second amendment, which specifically regards a well regulated militia of course.

worldnews,ff6ws2i,t1_ff6te8p,1579636488.0,"Ok I was exaggerating, but my point remains. And you are exaggerating just as badly if you're going to claim eating soy beans is on the same level as drinking a Coke, because you're dumbing it down to pure calories, whereas I was dumbing it down to pure sugar intake versus fullness. You are ignoring the after effects of simple sugars in the body just as I was ignoring the most immediate ""calories in versus calories out"" argument.

A piece of whole bread with butter, while not a great snack for someone watching their weight, has nutritional value that can fuel a healthy person, and also makes you feel full. A Coke does not. The coke means you're still hungry, so even if they were on the same nutritional level (they're not), the point is it trains your body to need more and more. And that's why my argument that sugary drinks are so dangerous. The only thing they're generally supplementing is *water*. Whereas junk food is often supplementing other foods, meaning it will end up with less of a caloric and sugar overload.

If a Coke was treated like a scoop of ice cream mentally, then I'd agree they're similar. But they're not. People treat Coke like water. This makes it a huge negative in a person's diet, whereas ice cream is generally understood to be ""a treat"" and used more sparingly"

bicycling,ff6j0ba,t1_ff3z1tv,1579628232.0,"I was exaggerating a bit originally. I started off as the well intentioned home mechanic too. Most commonly I'm referring to people who aren't like you, but instead go ""my front derailleur won't shift into the high gear so I loosened my high limit and tightened my low limit but now everything's worse!"".

Really though, at the end of the day there isn't a replacement for experience. I knew nearly all the do's and don'ts of something as simple as a derailleur adjustment when I started. But the difference in my current self getting a tricky shifting issue in, or me six years ago getting a tricky shifting issue in, is still extremely large. There's a lot of nuance in bikes that many other mechanical repairs don't have. I used to work on cars for example, and while that is extremely challenging at times and takes much knowledge, your most basic repairs don't have the level of precision that tuning a tricky derailleur has, because all the precision is built into very solid, sealed components that you mostly bolt on. (Getting into actual rebuilding and many more specific repairs goes way beyond bike stuff though)

It's quite common that the well meaning home mechanic rolls his bike in with issues, and as soon as I touch those handlebars and glance at his bike I know exactly what's going on, what he did wrong, and what I need to do now. Compared to me with only one year of full shop experience where I'd definitely spend some minutes evaluating before having a close idea.

Hours spent tweaking everything from Walmart BSOs to Eagle AXS and everything between will do that for you. A customer saying his brand new BB won't stop creaking, so I pull his seatpost to clean and lube it, and the noise is gone, is not something you generally think of with only minimal time spent tweaking your own bike every once in awhile. The home mechanic is essentially doing a push up every once in awhile and wondering why his push ups aren't improving drastically, versus a guy doing hundreds a day."

""Beer bellies"" are simply due to bad diet, not beer. Men carry fat differently than women which can give us that noticeable, hard-fat belly.

Beer, or any sugary type drink, is dangerous because of how easily it adds calories on top of everything else, without really making us feel full. But a guy will get that same, noticeable beer belly if he's never drank alcohol, and his vice is chips, or sweets, or simply too much food."

That's what I'm saying this advice is. It's valid, and it's ""common sense"", and it also has no fucking change of outcome in this thread, or in most bicycle/car collisions where a driver is at fault.

All you are doing is placing blame where there is none. I understand your point. I've gone mostly car free for a decade, so I understand it very well. Every intersection that I have the right of way has my full understanding that right of way isn't enough. I avoided getting hit recently by the sound of an engine alone. My light had been green for a few seconds and as I was proceeding through I heard the unmistakeable sound of an engine not slowing down. Even though I had visually cleared the intersection as safe, this guy came from a long way off and changed lanes to avoid running into the already stopped car.

I only avoided this because of years of training my senses to be on edge. But it would not have been remotely my fault if I didn't hear this engine noise on a super late red light runner who last I checked was behind a stopped car and couldn't have hit me.

And the bigger problem is that your ""common sense"" mindsets are only wildly successful at one thing, and that is down playing the role of the car in these collisions.

When I worked at a large tire shop, most of us said absolutely horrible things to each other on a daily basis. Sometimes hourly.

But those couple guys we hated? Never talked shit to them unless tempers were flaring. To the untrained ear we were nicer to the guys we hated, in reality we all just understood each other and communicated through shit talk"

dndnext,fevwd9x,t1_feumurh,1579402267.0,"My idea on that is that many people come with elaborate backstory and pages and pages of lore, but that often in no way changes how their characters actually act.

But when you make a gag character as a joke, but you consistently play his gag, you're actually out playing all the serious people who aren't actually putting the R into the P. So your character becomes a lot more real than everyone else.

When I host one shots outside of my normal group I play in, I ask everyone to give very specific quirks, speaking habits, etc or I ask them to draw randomly from my bowl of quirks, accents, glaring flaws, etc... This automatically cements people into a character much better than their months of history writing, IMO"

Would've been fine if JJ let a single fucking moment in that abortion of a movie just *breathe*.

For me I think the new space armor chick was all around the worst. They tried to fit a full movie's worth of ""I hate you... But actually it's complicated... But I actually still love you... Here take this magical mcguffin that gets you free passage anywhere that I need to survive.... Oh look u made it to the final battle scene too, our relationship is so hilariously *complicated*...""  Into about five minutes

Hey JJ, we've already got a full cast off characters nobody cares about because they weren't given good stories or writing, you don't need to add more. We've already seen a million set pieces, how about you set the movie somewhere that can progress, build tension, climax, etc instead of just spending five minutes per planet"

TwoXChromosomes,fem7vw7,t1_fdpncmq,1579242941.0,"I feel this can lead to some very unfair situations, for both people, IMO. People look at things very differently. I can obviously see when dishes need doing or a lightbulb needs changing. But it seems what my wife sees when she sees a spotty mirror, or the first signs of crumbs on a carpet, just puts us into two different universes.

I'm happy to clean the mirrors, or vacuum. But I'm going to need a schedule, or to be told to do it, or otherwise she's going to sit and stew thinking I'm just allowing messes to pile up, when really I just don't see stuff on that level. I would trade many of my good traits to be able to see the world as my wife does, but I don't. I hop to the chore as soon as I know it needs doing, but I don't know until for some people it's a bit late.

And I don't think this is a gender thing. My sisters are the same way. My older sister married a guy who is like my wife and is an absolute super hero around the house as we flounder and make fools out of ourselves.

When things get tense this leads to bad moments for both of us. She may think I'm being lazy and freak out, and I may think she's being unreasonable and could've just asked when she first noticed (which is a bit unfair to be honest).

But I'm just really bad. My wife moved a seven foot long couch into our garage, I got home from work, parked my bike right next to it, walked inside and saw the missing couch and asked her where it went."
politics,fem704h,t1_fdvdpm0,1579242010.0,"On the most basic level you're correct.

Obama or Clinton, for examples, often said political things which did not come to fruition, or turned out to be half truths, etc.

But that's so different from what this administration does daily. You have them doctoring videos to claim someone did something they did not. You have them sharing flat out falsehoods, sometimes dozens of times a day.

This administration flat out lies more times in a day for political gain than you can find in 8 Obama years.

I'm not an Obama fan and never voted for him, but come the fuck on. There's such a huge and fundamental difference between political type things said by every politician, and the things Trump does daily.

How about, in year 2020:

 ""Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.""

Which is 100% false.

Says House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff ""made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity.""

Another compete lie, going against recorded evidence on multiple levels, by Trump's own people.

""I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your healthcare.""

His government was only thwarted in removing the protections to pre-existing conditions by Trump's enemy McCain voting against Trump last minute. Complete lie.

He just gets out there and says anything he wants to, and you fuckers just let him piss in your mouth and tell you it's rain"
