thedavidpakmanshow,ff6ru4x,t1_ff6pnii,1579633561.0,This is an interesting point that I'd never considered before.
seculartalk,ff4b15z,t1_ff48dj0,1579559438.0,"Well there are a lot of things that definitely pushed me away from it. To be quick about it, the first step was realizing and admitting that the free market couldn't solve problems of a humanitarian nature. This started with private prisons but trickled out into other areas, like climate change and medical bankruptcy. By the same token, I had to admit and accept that corporations really and blatantly do not have our best interests in mind. It took working for a corporation to really get a feel for that. 

A couple of other things; I had kids. I don't want my kids to have to struggle or worry about homelessness when they get older. My priorities totally changed. This was sort of secondary, since by the time I had my first daughter, I was already on this path. 

Two other things; I started watching David Pakman and started following Andrew Yang (who isn't my main guy anymore but was for a long time), both of whom were able to frame progressive ideas in ways that I could really understand and get behind. 

This explanation doesn't really do the whole process justice, but all that, along with just always being generally open-minded and willing to admit being wrong, led me left further and further. My political map has been shifting to the left for like six years now, slowly. Still libertarian though, in the sense of that map."
seculartalk,ff45w8n,t1_ff3fbra,1579556232.0,"I spent a lot of time defending Warren to the people that, I believed, were irrationally hard on her for her past. I talked a lot about how the progressive left needs to stick together and not do the whole purity test infighting thing. I used to be right-libertarian, I totally understand changing positions and so I defended her for it. 

Then all this shit happened. Fuck, I feel like I wasted a lot of energy defending her and she turned out to be a real piece of shit (assuming she colluded with CNN to leak that story). 

I mean, to be fair, I've heard that Bernie's team was using some anti-Warren scripts in Iowa before this happened, which imo is also not cool, but this whole strategy Warren apparently just had ready to launch, loaded and in the holster waiting, is crazy fucked up and manipulative and all-around dishonest. I don't defend her anymore."

It's also not inherently insulting--it's the context that makes it insulting, and it's the context that matters in the first place. But generally I agree that we'd all be better off if we just tried to avoid the whole ""Trump is a bumbling idiot"" type of stuff and stuck to the facts."
