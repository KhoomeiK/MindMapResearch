GetMotivated,ff4h4jv,t1_ff3zzpg,1579563477.0,"> BMWs are unreliable as fuck

This. He's all condescending saying we're obviously not car people then acts like a BMW is an unstoppable force. I had the same cheap Subaru, with no major issues while watching two coworkers with BMWs get rentals every few months because something would stop working. Plus they just take so much more to work on."
GetMotivated,ff4gy8v,t1_ff401mz,1579563358.0,There's also something to be said about reliability. His condescending *yOu'Re nOt cAR pEoPLe* tone is great for putting people down but he's wrong. I've seen Hondas go half a million miles and BMWs spend more time in the shop than on the road. Luxury brands *might* be built better in a lot of cases but they also come with way more toys and those toys break just as frequently as the extras on any other car.

2meirl4meirl,fcrxj0j,t1_fcrvfvt,1577907989.0,Lol I honestly think this meme has gotten more thought than the creator intended because honestly I think the reality of it is they were calling our measurement units abstract and not the actual progression of time itself.
2meirl4meirl,fcrwljr,t1_fcrw2mu,1577907618.0,But I'd argue that the fact that our body is different doesn't make the meme any less true. Like yeah a bunch of cells have died but we've both agreed that level of time is mostly imperceptible to us and I think the point of the meme is to say that nothing that you perceive will change based on the fact that it's now 2020 unless you make it happen since that specific change is only based on our yardstick of this marching.
2meirl4meirl,fcrw2qc,t1_fcrv76a,1577907409.0,"Agreed on all points. The only weak one, to me, is the notion that this meme is based on a complete falsehood. Like yeah time as a thing exists but the change between 2019 and 2020 itself doesn't change anything on its own. Like sure your cells are different but that's not because it's 2020 now that's because of the inherent time of degradation and regeneration. 

The meme, again to me, seems to be specifically calling out the fact that everyone thinks everything is going to change because the last two digits of the date are different when, in reality, nothing will change (in your perception) unless you change it.

I think your point about ""whether you perceived that or not"" proves the pedantry of your point since the whole point of the meme is that nothing perceivable will change just because the calendar did."
2meirl4meirl,fcrv68v,t1_fcruipi,1577907048.0,"But I really think you're missing the point that, innate or not, celebrating that it's 2020 now instead of 2019 is pointless because **that** is related to our label of time. My point about GPS is the fact that it works doesn't disprove that fact it only shows that our measurements, while useful to us, still have no bearing on anything. Sorry if I didn't say that clearly.

Side note: I legit appreciate that you're responding like a human to a human even if I might've gotten shitty. You could've just gone off and been like ""lel well you're just a fat neckbeard"" and I appreciate the actual discourse here and apologize if I got shitty."
2meirl4meirl,fcrujjh,t1_fcrsdls,1577906796.0,"Sorry man I'm a bit fired up today from lack of sleep. Seriously though, good luck in everything!"
2meirl4meirl,fcru892,t1_fcrt9k2,1577906679.0,"It *is* the same though, if you don't change anything. The fact that the year, or the moment, is different has no bearing on the fact that if you are sitting in your room smoking pot at 11:59pm on 12/31 you will still be sitting in your room smoking pot at 12:00am 01/01. 

I don't know if you feel like you've trumped my point but ultimately I feel like you just continued to prove that you are completely disregarding the context of the meme that was posted to try to make yourself look smart or insightful."
2meirl4meirl,fcrte8q,t1_fcr685s,1577906366.0,Seriously. You 14 year olds need to stop. Yes everyone fucking gets it congrats on being smarter than us all. But you're making this point in the face of the fucking fact that the meme is there to make the point that your life won't fucking change just because the calendar did because the calendar is just a yard stick and doesn't change anything about how time marches forward.
2meirl4meirl,fcrt220,t1_fcrc20o,1577906236.0,"Which is evident by most of you people insisting on making these comments. I don't really feel like anyone is stupid enough to think that the universe wouldn't charge forward if we hadn't invented time... 

You are all making this point about GPS like it somehow proves that time isn't arbitrary... You do realize that GPS literally is based on our implementation of time? Can't write triangulation code without counting the millisecond/microsecond differences indicated from each satellite. GPS wouldn't work without our arbitrary time units being defined. The functionality is all there still yeah but we couldn't implement it without having assigned units to time. 

Which, the yardstick that measures the passing of time is what I'd argue this meme is about. It's not about how physics is affected by time it's about the fact that your life isn't going to change just because we've marched further on the yardstick."
2meirl4meirl,fcrscov,t1_fcr6xbl,1577905973.0,"GPS only works based on the way we've defined time. If we defined time by the rate of degradation of a hotdog, GPS would still work assuming we standardized the hotdog."
2meirl4meirl,fcrs54y,t1_fcr2nod,1577905888.0,Yeah except the whole point of the post is people talking about how life is going to change in some way because it's a new year while the numbers that we mark time by have no innate effect on us. You people all trying to floss by making this point are just making yourselves look stupid in this context.
2meirl4meirl,fcrrula,t1_fcqt2m1,1577905772.0,"I really think you're taking the point too far. Like yes every cell in our bodies is keeping time in some way but we don't celebrate the new year based on the rate of cellular deterioration, we celebrate based on an abstract concept aka time is an abstract concept in this context."
2meirl4meirl,fcrrm3v,t1_fcqqtuf,1577905677.0,"Lol graduate and live in peace. I think you mean graduate and deal with the next shitty situation in life. If you're talking about high school or an average college, you're in for a wake-up. 

If you're talking about college and it's truly shitty then it might get better but blaming your situation for your happiness is always going to be a problem for you until you realize that your experience is what you make it."
