If we used “someone might someday take advantage of this program in ways we didn’t intend” as a reason to not help people, we wouldn’t have any assistance programs at all, be they charitable organizations or actual socialized endeavors. No form of assistance is without this risk and efforts to combat this almost always end up hurting people who really need the help.
