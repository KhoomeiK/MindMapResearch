dragonquest,ffc9qjz,t3_eshydu,1579794751.0,"The tension mechanic can be annoying when bosses start to use that attack often, so I find attacking after you get up to 20 tension to be a good tradeoff between damage and not risking losing your tension.  50 is really all you need, risking to jump up to 100 is just setting yourself up for disappointment.  

A 20 tension multi thrust/multishot/twin dragon lash at a single boss enemy does decent damage and only requires two rounds of prep before you get the timbrel of tension.  

On another note though, the Empyrea fight is made easier if you just focus on using Executioner/Lightning Thrust with Yangus/Hero rather than psyching up to get around her massive defense, since those attacks ignore defense and hit 50% of the time.

While you will have rounds where they both miss, Empyrea has low HP, so the damage they do with no ""prep rounds"" makes the fight go fast, and you can just use Angelo/Jessica to heal/buff."

I can't even imagine the horrible shit they were likely saying about this guy in emails and office chats for the grievous crime of being white.  

No way CNN was going to give the public even a short glimpse behind the curtain of that clown show."

unpopularopinion,fdjykzr,t1_fdjye66,1578491497.0,"I like to focus on the incestous and corrupt relationship between developers and journalists since once you bring in Quinn and the trolling campaign, no real discussion can be made and it devolves into emotional responses.  

Also, the former is what actually matters."
kotakuinaction2,fdjyd0j,t3_elr2hv,1578491321.0,"The thing with racist non-whites is not that they are more racist than whites, they are actually exactly as racist as whites, since they are just people, liberal dogma notwithstanding.  

It is just that white people are the only people who have to hide their racism for social reasons, and are the only people punished for it.  Racism in people who are not white is actively encouraged on our current social milieu. 

So looking at social media one would easily make the conclusion that black people are the most racist people on the planet, but that is simply because they are encouraged to be loudly racist because people find it entertaining.    

Also, if the AI sees the use of a certain word to be automatically racist it does not take a genius to figure out why black people on Twitter would be seen as the AI as the most racist."
gaming,fdjy070,t1_fdhs59e,1578491032.0,"Yes, just like Monopoly, it has a luck mechanic and a social mechanic.  Yet poker is good, and monopoly bad for some arbitrary reason. 

Modern board games being more complex does not make older less complex board games bad.  You not liking player elimination as a mechanic does not make a game inherently bad.

You guys really need to understand that not liking a game, or being bad at it does not make it a bad game, and that complexity for its own sake does not necessarily make a game good.

I am honestly amazed so many people here are so angry and triggered that someone likes a game they don't.  It's a damn gaming sub."
unpopularopinion,fdjxgpm,t1_fdjvwd1,1578490588.0,"The start of gamergate as I understand it was an accusation of a woman sleeping with games journos and them giving her good reviews.  But the real issue behind it was when people started looking into the above issue, they found lists and chat logs of games journalists talking about all the bribes and collusion between them and games developers in exchange for good reviews, and the shared political narratives they wished to push.

But the media focused on trolling, so that is the story most people know.  That people were being trolled."
