One thing about the little bottles is that the lid is removable - the paper I got with my necklace said that when you made a wish, you could sprinkle the ""fairy dust"" around to make it come true :')
My point is, if you're really dedicated, you could get the necklace and open it up, buy some fine white glitter or sand at a craft store like Michael's (or online on Amazon) open the bottle and switch the fairy dust to white. :) If she never intends on opening it for any reason, you can even super glue the lid back on.

Seems like a weird form of control she wants to have over you for some odd reason. Regardless of how your relationship is other than the sending of pictures, she needs to learn this lesson in life sooner or later- you cant change people's minds through force. You shouldnt even feel the need to. Your being vegan doesn't affect her life at all. She needs to reassess what's important to her, or else she'll push away everyone in her life some way or another.

That specific detail really jumped out at me.

I want to figure out if anyone could remember what the main charcter/farmer/you actually looked like. Dark/light hair? What clothing was the character wearing? And your wife? What did your ""farm"" look like, as in which animals and chores do people specifically remember taking care of? I have so many questions, haha. I know general consensus is it's a pixel game with the cutscenes animated in a different art style but like what exactly was depicted IN the gameplay?

I used to download tons of games online using torrents that I didnt understand weren't created by companies like Nintendo. I didnt really understand how videogames were programmed and that anyone could really do it and make whatever they wanted - I was probably around 8-10 years old.

offmychest,fe3v3xx,t3_enn7g7,1578853169.0,"I have a huge interest in true crime cases, and sometimes go too deep down a rabbit hole. There are about 5 or so cases I wish I could erase from my mind, and Junko's is one of them.
I always ask myself, why am I interested in these things? Is there something wrong with me? But then I remember that...reading them upsets me. It disturbs me. If there was something ""wrong"", I WOULDN'T be disturbed.

Basically I'm saying, it's kind of a good thing you were so upset by it. I try to think of it as, I'm glad people are talking about it, because there are so many people who choose to live life ignoring the fact that there is true evil in this world. And if we ignore it, it will continue to fester and grow. But if we shine light on it, we can inspire people to want to make it stop. We can study the perpetrators and figure out how to pinpoint someone who is evil and stop/help them before people have to suffer.

Dont think about what happened to her, think about how her captors got punishment. Think of how the families had to accept that their sons were disgusting murderers. Think about how she is not going to be forgotten. She is a hero. What happened to her could have happened to so many other young women. But thankfully, i feel that case opened a lot of peoples eyes, and honestly I think that the light punishment (the perpetrators only got like 15-20 years in prison because they were under 18) also shocked people just as much as the crime, and now brutal crimes are being dealt with in a much more fitting manner all over the world. There are always exceptions, people slipping through cracks, but if we focus too much on who got away, we wont be able to focus on stopping people who are doing evil things right now. (That sounds a little weird, let me clarify that I think everyone deserves fitting punishment for wrongdoing).

Try reading something totally opposite, like a funny story or watch a movie that always makes you smile. And if she ever comes to your mind, imagine her happy and at peace. That's what I do at least. :)"
offmychest,fe3s28r,t3_enpuow,1578852316.0,"First things first: talk to your dear ol mom. Let her know you appreciate her wanting to help ('cause it's obvious shes just wanting to make you happy!), but let her know that you are an adult now, and if you feel like trying out some new products, she'll be the first person you'll go to - but you dont need a scalp massage every time you visit, lol. Let her know you love her and tell her you're embracing your new look (even if it's a lie at this point), and you'll let her know if you need anything. :)

Secondly, I think you should take some time to do something for yourself. Try waking up one day and just living life just as you are right now. Dont feel the need to look a certain way because of society's implications. Just for ONE day. Take yourself out for a nice dinner, or buy a new outfit that makes you feel attractive and put-together. :) Go to a park and listen to some music while having a snack. Breathe, and be thankful for your body and what it does for you. Then when you go home, look in the mirror, and tell yourself you had an awesome day no matter how your hair looks.

It's important to feel good about ourselves, but make sure that your feelings are coming from a place that is personal, not something that the world is pushing onto you. Some people experience body dysmorphia so severely to a point where just looking in a mirror gives them anxiety. If you feel like you're experiencing something to this degree, I would consider seeing a therapist, even if it's for one session. It could feel really good to talk about your personal feelings about your hair with a ""stranger"", and not your mom.

Finally, I know some people will probably come at it with ""just accept it and shave it all off!"" This might work for some people, but not everyone. Take everyone's opinions with a grain of salt, do some research on your opinions, and make an informed decision on your own. If that decision is to fuckin rock that receding hairline and not give two fucks, all power to you. If you'd like to continue topical treatments but would prefer if your mom tone it down a bit, go for it. If you want surgery, a toupee, or to razor it all away, do it because YOU feel good about yourself and not because anyone else feels ""that's what's best"".

Last piece of advice is one I always give - check out some ted talks on body image and appearance. Especially if counseling seems a bit too extreme for the situation right now.

Good luck to you, and also remember that any insecurity you might have could turn out to be the one thing that gives you power and confidence; wether that's having a stutter, missing some teeth, having a skin condition, being a little overweight, or having a receding hairline. :)"
offmychest,fe3odfh,t3_ennenm,1578851290.0,"The best and probably only piece of advice I've ever gotten that actually helped me feel better was hearing: ""Hell is relevant.""

Wether you just stubbed your toe or lost your entire family to a terrorist attack, everyone has the right to feel unhappy in their life. Life is just a series of events that happen TO us with no control. All we can control is our response to the situation.

It's natural for people to want to vent and ""complain"" when things arent going right. We rarely celebrate when things are ""just ok"", so when something isnt quite right, it effects us more.

If you live your life comparing your hardships to others, you will never be happy. Because there will always be someone out there who is doing better, doing worse, and also who is in the exact same boat as you. There are so many humans on earth, and we are all living our own unique experience.

I will say that you're still young, and you have so many awesome things ahead of you that you could never even comprehend right now. There will always be hardships as well, but if you let them happen and not they to control it, but rather control your response to it, you will find yourself recognizing the upswings along with the downswing- its like ol' Butters said: ""The only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good."" Let yourself feel good after you've felt sad. Let yourself just FEEL. Its neccesary for your development as a literal human being. You'll find yourself appreciating the smallest little things so much more."

Everyone is in this phase in creation right now (and not just ARGs, with literally anything creative-song, art, film, etc) where the only thing that matters is being able to pay your rent and bills with your creative project. The story doesn't matter, the viewers dont matter, the artist doesn't even matter. All that matters is, ""will people click this and will I get paid? Cause I really need to eat tonight.""

I feel like people are trying too hard sometimes. I DO believe ""anyone could do it"" and everyone should try their hand at being creative, it might help our society more than we think...but I wish people would ask themselves ""WHY am I doing this?"" before just mashing up the 3 ARGs they know of and calling it  their own.

horror,fd3ow76,t3_ejz3xk,1578160422.0,"I guess my FIRST horror movie was ""The Bad Seed"" (1956)...my grandma was a fan of old mysteries and had it on VHS. I was probably around the main characters age (probably younger, maybe 7-9?) and it freaked the hell out of me! There's no gore or violence hardly at all, but the main character was so believable that I had a hard time warming up to new kids after I watched it, haha.

I remember not soon after that watching ""Misery"" with a cousin who was also around my age at the time. We were totally disturbed but on the edge of our seats the entire time.

After that, my mother (bless her) noticed I was getting more interested in horror, and gifted me a DVD of a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". She emphasized the campiness and silliness of it, and it made it way less ""scary"" to 10 year old me. That was probably when I really decided I loved the genre and wanted to watch anything having to do with it. Soon after she gifted me ""Halloween"", the classic ""It"", ""The Shining"" and ""Friday the 13th"" - she stressed that if I was gonna like horror, I had to watch the classics first. I thank her for that.

Around 12 or so, I watched ""Scream"" with friends at a slumber party and fell HARD for modern slashers. One of the first movies I watched that was actually made after like 1999 was ""The Strangers"". As a young preteen it scared the hell out of me and got me interested in true crime cases, serial killers, etc.

So I guess my love of horror is really all because of an old black and white VHS movie about a little girl who just wanted some tap shoes.

It's hard to pick my current favorite...I've probably watched over 1000 horror movies from all over the world. There are all of the classics I've mentioned already and of course new stuff being released that are total game changers like ""Hereditary"" etc. I will say that I normally kind of hate zombie movies (they're all too similar for me and get boring), but ""Train to Busan"" had me begging for more at every turn. I feel like horror is so diverse, there are too many for me to pick as lame as that sounds. You've got art house movies, torture porn, ghost stories...I just cant pick one. :)

I WILL say that I'm a proud ""Blair Witch Project"" apologist and its probably one of my top 3 horror films. There was a period in my life where I would just turn it on maybe once a day to literally just pass time. Did that with ""Alien"" for a while too, but some people would argue that it isnt a horror film (I say it is lol c'mon an alien baby pops out of a guys sternum! Oh uh.....spoilers...??)

Sorry for any misspellings, I have 1 brain cell and it gets pretty overwhelmed a lot"
horror,fd3ntqw,t3_ejz3xk,1578160098.0,"I guess my FIRST horror movie was ""The Bad Seed"" (1956)...my grandma was a fan of old mysteries and had it on VHS. I was probably around the main characters age (probably younger, maybe 7-9?) and it freaked the hell out of me! There's no gore or violence hardly at all, but the main character was so believable that I had a hard time warming up to new kids after I watched it, haha.

I remember not soon after that watching ""Misery"" with a cousin who was also around my age at the time. We were totally disturbed but on the edge of our seats the entire time.

After that, my mother (bless her) noticed I was getting more interested in horror, and gifted me a DVD of a Nightmare on Elm Street. She emphasized the campiness and silliness of it, and it made it way less ""scary"" to 10 year old me. That was probably when I really decided I loved the genre and wanted to watch anything having to do with it. Soon after she gifted me Halloween, the classic It, ""The Shining"" and Friday the 13th - she stressed that if I was gonna like horror, I had to watch the classics first. I thank her for that.

Around 12 or so, I watched Scream with friends at a slumber party and fell HARD for modern slashers. One of the first movies I watched that was made after like 1999 was The Strangers. As a young preteen it scared the hell out of me and got me interested in true crime cases, serial killers, etc.

So I guess my love of horror is really all because of an old black and white VHS movie about a little girl who just wanted some tap shoes.

It's hard to pick my current favorite...I've probably watched over 1000 horror movies from all over the world. There are all of the classics I've mentioned already and of course new stuff being released that are total game changers like ""Hereditary"" etc. I will say that I normally kind of hate zombie movies (they're all too similar for me and get boring), but ""Train to Busan"" had me begging for more at every turn.

Edit: reddit deleted the second half of this post where I rambled about liking The Blair Witch Project and way more but I'm too lazy to rewrite it all, wahh"

horror,fd3hpvl,t3_ejs5sg,1578158391.0,"I put off Hitchcock's films for way too long under the idiotic assumption that they would be ""boring"" - I'm happy to say I've never been so surprised and felt so stupid haha.
Psycho was my first Hitchcock film. I'd always known he was a thing thanks to my grandmother and her love for Turner classic movies/mysteries. I was completely enveloped from the moment the film began.
After watching I binged all of his films and also started watching the classic Twilight Zone episodes with a newfound respect and interest. Thanks for this amazing post!!!"
ObscureMedia,fd364kk,t3_ejr6nm,1578155103.0,This is probably one of my favorite docs about the animation industry. I really wish we could see something similar about Disney nowadays. Good to see it on reddit!! :)
horror,fd2wlfe,t1_fd24p59,1578152302.0,"I definitely feel like a handful of horror lovers go through a ""phase"" of having this almost obsessive interest in a particular real life case; think of all the blogs of fangirls talking about how they wish they could date the Colimbine Kids and shit. People who write love letters to incarcerated rapists/murderers. I think it makes us reflect on who WE are as humans. I remember thinking I was so cool for doing high school projects on Jeffery Dahmer and shit...he might've been ""misunderstood"" and ""had a rough life"" but so do literally millions of people, and they dont go around hacking up boys and eating them. Now I look back and cringe at the things I used to borderline glorify/defend. 

Humans are weird creatures. I think it's important to always be curious but when that curiosity festers into an obsession/support, that's when you begin to lose yourself in this veil you put on whatever it is (the Manson family, for example)."
horror,fd2udnq,t3_ejsul9,1578151761.0,"A lot of people hate it and I'll probably get flack for bringing it up but The Strangers absolutely turned me on to horror when I first saw it. I was maybe 10 or so?  I'd seen mostly 80s films that my parents enjoyed up until then (Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, the old It, etc) but nothing shook me like that infamous scene where the masked intruder is just standing behind the main heroine in total silence and shes completely oblivious to him.  I felt like I had to look over my shoulder when I was alone for months. I was SO disturbed by the notion of someone just coming into your house and fucking with you just for...fun.

After that movie I got very deep into true crime, serial killers, etc. The movie itself definitely doesn't scare me anymore, but I feel like a lot of people downplay the film in terms of how influential it was to other storytellers.

I LOVE supernatural stories but they definitely don't ""scare"" me - I'm always ""scared"" of movies I could actually see happening in real life; home invasion, torture porn, etc. But I caught the bug a long time ago and I dont think I'll ever stop watching horror of any kind. :)

relationship_advice,fcsr305,t3_eipkj6,1577922964.0,"Sometimes it's weird dealing with a libido affected by depression, seasonal or otherwise. First of all, dont feel bad for automatically assuming these things - anyone would. But also consider that he might be having more anxiety about being intimate with you not only physically but emotionally, mentally, etc. Porn/masturbation takes care of the carnal instinct of wanting sex, especially for guys; it's a quick and easy way to kind of relax and forget about the world for 10 minutes. Almost the equivalent of taking a hot shower or meditating. Literally no more than that.

I promise you, you are giving him things no pornstar ever could. You're taking care of his emotional and mental needs, but when it comes to his sexual needs, he might see having sex with you right now as something that might be a ""chore"" instead of something fun. (Maybe not a chore but more like something to check off of a to-do list, especially if you are normally pretty sexually active)

That being said, it's not a ""chore"" because you've suddenly turned ""ugly"" or hes suddenly not ""into"" you - HE just literally might not have the energy or drive to please YOU (or any ""real human""), and hes probably scared of it wether he realizes that or not.

Depression makes you overthink every little thing. He might just literally be too overwhelmed to engage in sex with another person right now, so instead hes using his phone as a quick release with no strings attached. Sex with a person comes with strings - good and bad. Sex with a picture or a thought does not.

He might feel guilty about asking for a blowjob etc, and sees porn as a quick way to relax instead of going through the entire rigamaroll of sex. It's just a weird thing depression does to your brain, unfortunately.

My advice would be to definitely talk to him, and let him know maybe even in a playful way that you know hes been taking care of himself and that if he ever wants to ask you for ""help"", you're down to clown. Just do what you've been doing; keep creating a safe and nurturing environment for his libido to kind of get back on track. Dont force anything, and try to not let those thoughts of comparing yourself to porn creep in. Porn is not real. It's all a big fancy show meant for a quick cheap thrill, 99.9% of it isnt real and we all know that. If porn was good enough, we'd all sit in milking cans with VR headsets on all day long, but we have sex because it's better than porn. Porn is just ""easier"" to have a second of relaxation and escape for some people and in some instances.

Another suggestion is try asking if he'd like you to help him WHILE hes looking at porn...if you're comfortable with that of course :) then you can kind of wane him back in to sex and not JUST porn.

Another weird bit of advice...watch some documentaries on the porn industry, learn how fake it is, and feel way better about yourself as a woman lol. It helped me a lot. Good luck, and just remember it has nothing to do with YOU, hes just in a bit of a funk. ‚ù§"

offmychest,fbrp9m2,t3_ee7ye6,1577045029.0,"Fear of failure / the unknown I would say. Something I'm trying very hard to overcome, myself. It's funny how much we think we simply ""can't do""...time and money are also factors. But I think the universe is big enough for us to at least attempt to work those dreams into our life plans. It does take effort and it is scary. People are afraid to really talk to themselves, ask themselves questions, dig at why they feel things and what they want. We are raised to focus on what we do, not why. Dreams always seem to be put into the ""hobbies"" or ""goals"" list instead of the ""to-do"" list.

Sorry for my nonsensical babbling...!! I think you should spend some time with yourself and let yourself discover the path to making your dreams reality.

Heres a Ted Talk I liked about conquering your fears in relation to achieving your dreams.
