apexuniversity,fcorogx,t1_fcocv90,1577839729.0,"You thought I was talking about the damage? A single Caustic barrel is not enough to act as an effective deterrant. Even in a tight building, you'll need at least 2: one for the entrance, one to cover the insides. In the open, it's even worse.

Caustic's barrels if anything are better used aggressively, or as I mentioned along chokepoints at the edge of the ring to zone people out and keep them out of the ring. But in general, his gas is shit. It takes ages to spread fully, to obscure vision, each barrel covers a relatively small areas outside, and only a medium-sized areas interior to buildings, and when they finally do take place they're just as much a hindrance to your own team's movement and vision as they are your enemies.

There are very few really good spots on this map for Caustic, nothing like Skulltown or Slum Lakes where a single barrel can completely fill each room. There isn't a single room in the whole map as far as I recall as small as some of the ones in those towns, and that's part of why Caustic isn't so strong anymore. Another is because the chokepoints are often way more massive, like trying to gas off the wide choke between the Pit and Containment. There aren't many chokepoints like the ones in the caves, or the center of the map, or Bunker, or the Pit, hell even Hydro Dam with its tight staircase and the choke around the respawn beacon outside repulsor.

The new map? It has I think four or five good chokes left for Caustic: the Vault caves, and the one connecting Skyhook to the Trainyard areas. I forget if there's another. What makes these so great is that they are one barrel wide, and VERY long, like Bunker, just wider. But most of the other chokes on this map? Like the one north of Geyser, or the train tunnels, these are MASSIVE and take two maybe three barrels to gas across, and they're VERY shallow so it might even take a full 6 barrels just to put 2 layers of gas between you and the enemy, which isn't nearly enough simply because they can just wait it out, and suddenly you're out of barrels. Fact is, there aren't nearly as many good chokepoints OR buildings on the new map as King's Canyon. The only decent places are the non-skyscraper buildings in Skyhook/Capitol where there's one way in and out, but only because there aren't any exits so if they come through they can't get out.

I've struggled to improvise on the new map, and find that it's nowhere near as safe or powerful to gas up behind you as before, and that's why I just wish they'd bring King's Canyon back. The old map was always a tonne better for Caustic, and that was before I even learn to use his gas properly to stall people out, it was just the map being actually good for him and kinda carrying me that way. The new map? Nah, I've gotten better with him and his gas, but I'm doing worse now, at best just as good, which goes to show how much worse the map itself actually is."

Caustic's gas is a mild hindrance to running, regular movement. However, the two most popular legends in the game, Pathfinder and Wraith, have abilities that easily bypass his gas without taking more than one tick.

Hell, from playing against Caustic as non-Caustics, I find you can actually run all the way through his gas without taking more than one or two ticks of damage, it's dumb. The only way Caustic can actually get decent value is if he prematurely detonates several gas cans to completely suffocate the room, but:

1) This hinders your own team also
2) Enemies just run back out, wait for everything to go on cooldown, then push and kill you with your ridiculously larger hitbox.

Hitbox problems are especially bad when against shotguns, since you'll take every pellet of a shotgun at twice the distance of a Wraith. Even against non-shotguns, hipfire is still far more accurate against you and your Gibby brothas. Gibby can survive it because of his shield, but you? You're fucked.

backrooms,fc9fcdi,t1_fc81xms,1577551854.0,"I'm gonna be frank, your story sounds bland and unimaginative. There's a difference between limitations and strangulation. We have limitations in r/backrooms, but what you've described sounds like borderline asphyxiation.

And you have no clue, do you. You haven't been here long enough, or haven't read enough. There have been PLENTY of posts that describe simple rooms or areas within the first few levels. These actually make up the bulk of posts within r/backrooms, and many of them are interesting, creative, or have really creepy vibes to them. The mere existence of higher, mythical levels does not mean they are the majority of our community, they are but an extension.

And the people who made the higher levels? They just wanted to create a mythical exploration fantasy, I don't see the problem with that. It's the backrooms, for all we know their stories are nought but legend, scary tales told to newcomers to discourage them from delving too deep into the backrooms.

The main reason though, why we attribute names to monsters and levels, is more so to remember what is what instead of having to describe it all the time. Again, it's just a construct to help us remember things, like Skinwalkers. If they didn't have a name, they'd be much harder to reference in conversation.

Don't take these things too seriously man, we write about this because it's fun. We built a community to support each other, to learn and grow in our writing ability. Don't forget that."
backrooms,fc80itj,t1_fc7xpl4,1577523607.0,"Again, ""levels"" are just a construct to capture the essence of different regions within the backrooms. Think of them as areas rather than vertical levels.

But if you want to talk unimaginative, well, you already did. Most of the ""truebackrooms"" posts I read are bland, unimaginitive, and frankly just feels like I'm reading copypastas. At least the newer levels feel like there's something being added. And the problem is entirely because of the limiations. The limitations placed make for the most repetitive posts, and a community that only thrives when there are only a couple of active posters, because otherwise everybody's posting the exact same thing.

I encouraged people to stray from the path and make their own way, it sounds like the ""truebackrooms"" community has encouraged uniformity and mass-produced copypastas."
backrooms,fc7wb0e,t1_fc7u57y,1577520331.0,"It's either escalation or stagnation.

You know why people are sick of the same old photos of abandoned buildings? It's the same old same old, it's boring. It's the backrooms stagnating. It's part of why this community, after the massive influx, is dying. I'm a mod for the wiki, and in the last few months there has been nothing. It's stale, it's boring, there's nothing being added because people are losing interest.

I get that there are parts which are ridiculous, I purged many of them, particularly the parts about killable monsters or monsters that just weren't scary. I purged the large communities people made, I purged the hunting parties, I purged a fuckload of things that didn't make sense.

What I didn't purge was the accounts of a small group of individuals who, at great risk to their lives, dared to venture deeper into the backrooms than anybody had previously dared. Why? Because it added flavour, a deeper plot beyond ""Whoa, I'm stuck in an infinite office building"". It added the idea of more that most would never come close to achieving, nor have the balls to. You know why I wrote up everything for level 1.5? It started as a warning, and turned into a cautionary tale: don't climb into the fucking windows or you'll get soul-raped by Mother.

Plus, people put actual effort into writing something new. I went through a tonne of writing posts at one point, people entering the backrooms for the first time. They were all the same, and they were all bland. Whoa, I clipped. Whoa, moist carpet, weird yellow lights. Whoa, scary sounds. I encourage people to add their own flavour, to add something new without going too far, because otherwise the community as a whole just becomes very boring.

If you want to stick to levels 1-3, sure. Just make sure that your writing isn't more than 90% similar to somebody else's, which given the nature of the backrooms and size of the community, I know everybody finds challenging. The posts that stick out are always written well, and ALWAYS introduce something new in a well-done way. The posts that get lost? Basic level 1-3 posts, because there are over 10,000 of us, and hundreds of level 1-3 posts that are virtually indistinguishable."
backrooms,fc7puo0,t3_eg83x7,1577515511.0,"Extra levels were made in roleplay to extend the ""lore"" of the backrooms.

The core of the backrooms will always be levels 1-3, but some people wanted to explore further and imagine other horrific experiences, and to do that they made new levels.

I myself made level 1.5, writing it as a sort of mystery, skipping parts of the story at first then returning to them in some sort of twisted time continuum.

Fact is, however, what we describe as ""levels"" is just a construct. How I envision it is that the ""levels"" of the backrooms describe areas. The concept of vertical levels was not the intent, rather delving further into its depths. The deeper you explore, the more it twists, malforms, the more it becomes demented, broken, and terrifying.

So personally, no, I don't think the idea of new levels is bad. It adds a way to structure our explorations into the depths of these halls, to help guide our understanding of how it changes as we go deeper and explore further, or go where we shouldn't. That's part of why I made level 1.5. It sounds dumb, but it became a staple: you do NOT go into the windows, they're all fake, a trap to lure you in between dimensions, into a broken part of the backrooms in which space and time are shattered, where souls go to die.

I personally think that having deeper, scarier levels also adds more to the fear factor: if you truly want to live, don't venture where Bart and crew have, stay to the relative safety of levels 1-3. It gives us a reference point, and encourages us to stay within our ""safety"" zones."
