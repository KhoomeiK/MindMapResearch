A handful of times last quarter my professors mic was on the fritz. Making loud popping sounds. Lots of kids would be shook each time, and For a split second I‚Äôd have the urge to hit the deck lol."

This time around was a little bit of a mess. Every school system is different so they have different requirements and standards. So not all classes will transfer with you to your next institution. And each school has its own admissions policies and what not. 

When I applied to my new school, I had to calculate my GPA from 5 transcripts. But when I got there for orientation I brought my transcripts with me and they explained to me what would and would not transfer with me. What they could give me credit for and what I‚Äôd have to repeat with them. 

I‚Äôd suggest you go see an admissions counselor at your target schools and work it out with them tbh"

That's after taking a gap year, then going to community college half time for the longest time, moving around a bunch, etc. You're still young, don't sweat it. We'll all get there."
college,fde9trb,t3_ekmnxi,1578334341.0,"I disagree and I think the author needs to get over the time he was denied entry to the Alpha Apple Pie party freshman year. 

Socializing is a big part of college. I mean sure, partying too much is bad. But as long as you stay on top of your shit a bender won't hurt. Get that A and celebrate with shots lol. You never know who you might meet and make friends with. I met a good friend who later gave me a job while I was out bar hopping on my 21st birthday lmao."

I could use another few days tho lol"

college,fctka2a,t3_eiaewf,1577946315.0,"I graduated high school in 2013 and took the scenic route afterward. After moving around a bunch, attending 4 community colleges and an out of state university, I transferred again to another university this past September at the age of 24 lmao. ngl I do feel old af here bc I look around the lecture halls and everyone just looks so young. 

A lot of people I graduated high school with have long graduated college. Some are in grad school now and a few in PhD programs. Some are deep into their careers already and others are married with homes and families. Sometimes I do wish that I had gone to college right after high school, or at least had my shit together earlier in community college. But at the same time, I feel like taking a detour was good for me bc I gained a lot of valuable life experience in the last few years. Also, I feel like I'm exactly where I need to be rn. I've met some cool people, had some fun times, and I'm loving my program. I know that if I had gone to college straight out of high school I would have studied something stupid and been stuck with debt and a degree I no longer wanted. 

I do look younger than I am, but when my age comes up I do get called old sometimes lmao. I feel like I can't click with too many of these kiddos that I meet, but I have found a few that I vibe with and made friends with. Honestly, at the end of the day it's not all bad. The important thing is that you're finishing school."
college,fcthva0,t3_eiiwrn,1577943804.0,"Damn I'm over thinking I was old. hell nah, you're young af still at 20/21. 

Don't go to college just to socialize and party. If you're going to go, get a degree in something that actually interests you. Make the time, effort, and the debt worth it lol.

I'm 24 and I just transferred to a new university where most everyone is younger than me. The age gap is bigger for me, I'm not gonna lie its a hit and miss trying to vibe with some of these kiddos but you really only need to meet a few good people to hang with and I've found a few already lol, 

Go for it, have fun, but do it for the right reasons. Going to college is one of the biggest milestones and financial decisions we make in life."
college,fctfz49,t3_eiqrnx,1577942035.0,"What you choose to study is your decision to make and no one else's. Just sayin lol.

college,fc7i2a6,t3_egm3gm,1577508089.0,"The good thing here is that you're a senior already, you're near the finish line so you won't need to struggle for too long. Are you currently working? if so, try working as many hours as you can handle. Budget, cut where you can. Worse comes to worse, consider taking out a loan to use for your expenses while you finish.

I fell out with my family when I was like 20/21 and have been on my own since. At the time, I was in community college trying to hurry up and finish to be eligible for transfer. Having the rug pulled out from underneath me like that slowed me down bc I had to work more to stay afloat and went to school only half time. Eventually I moved away and transferred, I took out loans at school and as much as I hated doing it, it really helped me stay afloat so I could focus more on school. 

Best of luck"

Ive attended 2 different universities now. From my experience, parties, drugs / alcohol and all that aren‚Äôt as rampant as the movies make it out to be. If you go looking for that stuff, you‚Äôll find it. But if you just want to fly under the radar, most people will leave you alone lol"

college,fbtikyr,t3_ee694p,1577080189.0,"I‚Äôm 24. In the nearly 7 yrs after high school I‚Äôve learned that genuine friends are few and far between. The only time I talk to my friends from high school is if we run into each other when I‚Äôm visiting my hometown. I was the one putting in all the effort to keep those friendships alive after graduation, but I realized it wasn‚Äôt a two way street anymore so I stopped lol. 

Over the last 3 years I‚Äôve  moved around a few times. Its been hard to make friendships that last. At my last university, I didn‚Äôt make one real friend. But I did make friends out in the city who I still get together with a few times a year. 

I just transferred to a new school in a new city where I didn‚Äôt know a soul before moving here. I‚Äôve only been here one quarter, but I haven‚Äôt had much luck connecting with people here. I‚Äôve met only a few great people who I do consider my friends, but we don‚Äôt get to hang out as much. & I don‚Äôt like always being the one to hit ppl up cause after a while it feels like I‚Äôm pressing them lol. Either these connections will grow, or I‚Äôll eventually meet someone new who matches my vibe. 

Anyway I‚Äôm high af rn and rambling so imma wrap it up. My point is, you‚Äôre gonna meet a lot of new people over the next few years. You might get attached to some of them, and some might not be staying. And that‚Äôs ok, we gotta remember that at the end of the day, we‚Äôre all chasing after something different, sometimes people gotta go their own way. Along the way you‚Äôll find a few people who are genuinely down for the ride with you. Hold on to them tight."
