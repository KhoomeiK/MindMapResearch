PublicFreakout,ff7rp7s,t1_ff63w41,1579656733.0,"We get Canadian Geese in our parking lot.  100% confident that's a male and the fucking dumbass female decided near the walk area was the perfect spot to incubate her eggs.  They love wide open area for this shit because they can see predators coming easy.  He's technically trying to defend his mate.  If the female is still egg producing and the male keeps having this happen they will straight up just be like, fuck this, and abandon the nest for a new one.  They just leave the eggs to get eaten.   I hate there protected status, there is plenty of them now, too many if you ask me.  You can force them to move or deter them from nesting in a spot by spraying grape Kool aid around, fucks with their noses   I've learned too much about these fuckers. Kill me."

todayilearned,feireqy,t1_feieugm,1579145309.0,If you are in the U.S.  you must have your name recorded to the public. I think there are only 2 states that you don't have to.  Sure they don't plaster your name all over the place but news team 5 has been itching to find out who that lucky lottery winner is. So good luck telling no one if you're in the U.S.

They will probably start with deep faked actors and slowly switch to virtual.  The tech and software has got to the point it's mostly just about cost to create your virtual actors and I feel the cost will decrease significantly very shortly.  Imagine a permanent ""actor"".  Never ages but can be any age in any acting and the voice always matches perfectly."

LifeAdvice,fd9teor,t3_ekaitd,1578237816.0,"Probably not crazy, parents either didn't know or are just being willfully ignorant.  Best course of action is a therapist. If you don't have a lot of money or any programs that can help you get therapy find a school.  They will often do it for little to no cost and the students are usually well supervised.  I wouldn't talk about it with your family till you ironed things a bit with therapy."
