LiverpoolFC,ff83tkw,t1_ff7zm29,1579665250.0,"Yes. Our transfer strategy is clear; we spend what is needed to improve the first team, like we did with VVD, Fab and Allison. To complete the squad, we find good players as rotation/back ups that are available for below their market price, like minamino and shaqiri (release clauses) or gini and Robertson from relegated clubs that need to sell. Those last two obviously improved massively at the club and are now key members of the squad, but they were not at first. This is a safe strategy, as it guarantees you will either get a good player for cheap, or that you can flip those players for a profit if they don't work out."
LiverpoolFC,ff7dnu8,t1_ff78wja,1579647145.0,"You guys seem to think wages for a world class first team is pocket money. We don't have as much money as you think. 

Also, Liverpool don't spend a lot of money on back ups, the idea is to keep the investment on the field as much as possible. Hence having backups like Minamino and Shaqiri."
soccer,ff6qaqb,t1_ff6i8qd,1579632647.0,You're confusing the contact between a club and a player and the contract between clubs for a transfer. They are different and separate deals.
soccer,ff6holn,t1_ff67og7,1579627424.0,"Not only did VVD miss that match, we had no fit CBs so Fabinho had to play there.  Bayern still created nothing."

soccer,ff21rxk,t1_fezmmxp,1579491479.0,"I think it should be a foul, but I'm basing that in the laws of the game, not in how I want the game to be played. 

VVD did not ""rush a goalkeeper"", they both went for the same ball. He literally could not have tried any harder to avoid contact with De Gea while still going for the same ball. De Gea doesn't have some sort of divine right to jump unimpeded. This sort of thing happens in literally every corner."

soccer,feyu42f,t1_feyen7c,1579450537.0,"You should buy Lallana. He would improve your side massively and is about to be a free transfer so would be cheap. English, versatile, a leader, experienced in premier league football."

soccer,fetab0g,t1_fesrqal,1579373271.0,"I think he lost the position before being tripped. It's like when a player touches the ball and then trips a player, not a penalty either."
soccer,fesa62y,t1_fes4es0,1579363135.0,Liverpool is not a good example. They won and got a final under Benitez too when the club was severely under funded. United have a particularly poor record in Europe in relation to their domestic performance.
soccer,feprfla,t1_fenf806,1579328756.0,"He's only been given 150 million and the second largest wage budget in the league, he can't work miracles."

soccer,feog9kk,t1_feoe94a,1579299702.0,"You had two shots on target. It worked defensively, which is the point, that you played defensively."
soccer,feo5zkj,t3_eq2nfv,1579295540.0,United are going to keep buying young players for massive amounts of money and then using the youth of the team as an excuse when they do poorly. Brilliant strategy.
soccer,fenykm4,t1_fen5fz2,1579292649.0,"I mean, how many times this season have you played three cbs? You weren't exactly embracing the beautiful game, you just pressed high for a while."
soccer,fejzlbv,t1_fejoe1f,1579189421.0,Maybe they get expelled because they raped someone and the standard of evidence for expelling people is lower than the standard to convict.
soccer,fejzcya,t1_fejxp0s,1579189276.0,That's not the same as saying women should be assumed to be lying about rape all the time. It's not a binary choice.

soccer,fegetwz,t1_feg9j5x,1579090320.0,Literally any forward does that. Occasionally holding up the ball doesn't make you a Target man
LiverpoolFC,fegeihu,t1_fefh19w,1579089975.0,Had Italian nationality as well.
LiverpoolFC,fege801,t1_fegba79,1579089650.0,"Good enough for cover at striker. However, since we would probably play origi or mane there if firmino isn't available, he wasn't really needed."
LiverpoolFC,fege3kf,t1_feg63yb,1579089511.0,"Solanke did score for Liverpool. He didn't really get many chances though, but he is a good player. Good enough for third choice striker for us. I imagine the club just thought the money was too good and maybe he wanted more minutes."
soccer,fegcfpw,t1_fegc0vn,1579087539.0,"Yes, that's part is really subjective. Really hard to translate something like ""heading"" into a number."
soccer,fegcdcd,t1_feg2hmu,1579087457.0,That is somehow even worse than Barcelona because arsenal had a lot of young wingers about to make the step up to the first team and really needed investment in central midfield and cb. Can't really figure out the logic.
soccer,fegc6pf,t1_feg9jdm,1579087220.0,You only had 15 first team players?

soccer,feg521j,t1_fefkzmp,1579077260.0,"Maybe every person is different even if they are all from Brazil, and the trick is, you know, actually scouting them instead of panic buying."
soccer,feg4t18,t1_feg3ebg,1579076931.0,Well sorry if reality gets in the way of your complaints. I hope you make it through this difficult time.

LiverpoolFC,fecdrd7,t1_fe7ceqx,1578971506.0,He gave the ball away a couple of times in the second half as well. He had that mix up with Trent that allowed Alli a free run at Allison. I love Joe but he was bad all match.

LiverpoolFC,fe8bp03,t1_fe8ak02,1578924578.0,"Salah was a good player, that's why he costed 35 million. Salah also improved in every single measurable metric since joining Liverpool and is now considered world class when he wasn't before. Nothing I'm saying is controversial.

And Bernardo faced some hard competition in the cl and didn't look out of place. He's a fantastic player, but he seems to me to be as good as he was at Monaco. I could be wrong, sure, not an expert."
LiverpoolFC,fe8b3rh,t1_fe86xgi,1578924363.0,"I know your point, I just strongly disagree with you. City are not good at developing players and they waste so much money on transfers it's amazing to me this is even an argument. 

The only player I can remember improving in any way at city in recent years is Sterling. I remember a lot of players stalling or straight up regressing, like stones, Jesus or Danilo"
LiverpoolFC,fe8a9p1,t1_fe86qkv,1578924160.0,"Of course, that's why we bought them. After they joined they turned into world class players. That's the point. It's not even subjective, they improved in every stat."
LiverpoolFC,fe89jjz,t1_fe7up03,1578923976.0,"Bernardo is performing great, but he hasn't improved. He's adapted to the league, but he's at the same level he showed in Monaco. 

Salah was slightly above average for Roma, but he improved in every metric at Liverpool, which is the point."
LiverpoolFC,fe868c7,t1_fe7ucs8,1578923001.0,"Right, so neither was world class until they joined Liverpool, which is the point. 

Liverpool signed world class players in Allison and VVD, who have not improved at the club but were excellent from pretty much day one, when we had the money, but most of the team was bought for cheap and improved by the staff."
LiverpoolFC,fe85bbq,t1_fe7yyzm,1578922753.0,"This is just false. City has spent a lot more than we have and it's not even close. They have not been sensational in the transfer market or even close to it. They have spent more and on older, more established players. It's just the truth, no reason to avoid saying that so we can seem to be fair to both teams. Liverpool spend less because we have less money, that's life, but this season proves we do it better as well. Credit to the owners, club staff and klopp."
LiverpoolFC,fe84icy,t1_fe7n8g0,1578922460.0,"Lol, people love rewriting history. Go back to the threads when Liverpool bought them and see if you can find one guy that went ""wow, this guy will be world class for sure"". Most people were saying mane was way overpriced."
soccer,fe6jmns,t1_fe5ruqf,1578893041.0,"It means a little because being man utd is how you spent so much money during the last transfer window, have the second largest wage budget and yet somehow still ended up playing a bunch of kids"
soccer,fe6j8bj,t1_fe4orcr,1578892656.0,"What, why? That's just complete nonsense."
soccer,fe6j3cy,t3_ensabh,1578892522.0,"Ok, but United spent like 150 million just this summer, right? If your squad is too young to compete, maybe buy more experienced players. 

That Liverpool side had young players, but also very fit, experienced and talented older players like Adrian, Milner and Lallana. So learn to build a squad, Ole."
LiverpoolFC,fdxnebt,t3_enbuds,1578770916.0,"A few bad performances today. Gomez looked shaky all match and gave the ball away a couple of times in dangerous areas. Henderson as well. Robertson was not good with the ball.

Good win, but we did not manage that match well at all."
soccer,fdxfmlu,t1_fdx7x1n,1578768257.0,"That's what Liverpool wants. Holding the ball in midfield creates opportunities for pressing and counters. 

Mou is trying to isolate son against TAA and get opportunities on the counter or Lucas in behind that way, maybe a corner or free kick. Seems decently effective, to be fair."
soccer,fdxbz7y,t1_fdxao3i,1578767278.0,"Liverpool played half the u23 though, so the quality was probably in Everton's favor, or should have been at least."
LiverpoolFC,fdv3vpj,t1_fdv16wd,1578742846.0,"That's the point, he didn't have a promising game just because we won. Walcott was essentially free down that side all first half, he never got close, and he didn't seem particularly good offensively either."
LiverpoolFC,fdum4y8,t1_fdu5jki,1578735133.0,I don't get why people over hype every single young player. I've seen enough of Larouci to be fairly sure he'll never be good enough for the first team. He looks significantly worse than many other younger players we have.

LiverpoolFC,fdp4dop,t1_fdnq132,1578619717.0,"It's third party ownership that's not allowed. A sell-on clause is the same as ""owning the rights"", if he gets sold liverpool get 20%."
