BlueCollarWomen,fcq16ze,t3_eigurj,1577876517.0,"Bandanas are a must have for any welding that will spatter, Sparks on your scalp hurt. 

Find jeans that go over your boots so you don't get Sparks down your shoes because you won't be able to get them off fast enough and it hurts super bad.

You can find some pretty nice men's work shirts/pants at good will, thrift stores, and Walmart clearance.

And technically not clothing wise, but sunscreen is a good idea, especially on your neck and cheeks. I've noticed certain angles allow the light to shine under my helmet and burn me after a while."
