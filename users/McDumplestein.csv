wholesomememes,fcssp57,t3_eimhjv,1577924134.0,"Thinking about going to therapy / counseling?

Please give it a shot.

It has helped me be more patient with myself, see the good in others, and even leave a relationship that was destructive and hurtful.

It has helped my sister overcome debilitating anxiety, allowing her to raise her sweet kids and be an amazing parent who travels and does well with her career.

If you’ve tried once and it sucked, try a different one—finding a therapist / counselor you feel comfortable with is paramount if you’re going to get anything done.

80/20 rule. 80% of the change in your life may come from only 20% of the conversations you have. One of the deepest changes for me came from five mins at the end of one session.

Sometimes the positive changes do not show up *during* counseling, but *during the months following.*

Please give it a shot. Talk with friends who listen well with compassion.

Give yourself time, do not isolate, and keep on going."
