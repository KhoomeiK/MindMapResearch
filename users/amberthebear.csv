AskReddit,ff9r9pv,t3_es53p0,1579719342.0,"In my opinion many aspects:
- someone that has no drive to achieve their goals 
- if they have no hobbies or are not passionate about a topic or anything in general (meaning they have no interests) 
- if we have mixed viewpoints/ they are not willing to at least coherently defend it. ( they can have different viewpoints. At least explain it. Dont just say something and not explain it)
- someone that cant hold a conversation 
- someone that only cares about themselves and are not supportive of others
- someone that doesnt actively do anything. (If you are content with sitting at home by yourself everyday and are not willing to at least get out of the house and do an activity thats boring. If you are working from home or are working on a project this doesnt apply to you)"

relationships,fer12xp,t3_eq81ow,1579348429.0,It doesnt matter if he didnt know the person you are mourning. The simple fact that he didnt display any empathy for you while you are grieving is the issue. Hes a jerk. Now you know in the future how he will handle your hardships. And how he will handle it. Wtf does that? And teach you a lesson? Seems like hes trying to find excuses and downplay the situation.

Wellthatsucks,fc60dsd,t1_fc582wp,1577469508.0,"My parents and my 2 brothers went on a few day camping trip to Saranac lake in NY. We decided to take our two coondogs, a black and tan named Judd and a treeing walker named Bill. Well my father had a cookout at work the day before we left and brought home like 15 burger patties and thought ""these are nice... i dont want to waste them. So he split them up between them both. So its like a 4 hour trip from home and we are about 3 and a half in. Its beautiful up there its desolate not much going on. Anyways, we are all crusing along in my dads dodge durango. Cars a pos. The back windows shorted out and wont go down but we need it because its big enough for 5 people and 2 dogs and can pull our boat. Well we are minding our own and all of a sudden we all hear a wet loud fart. And we were like Judd thats gross.... and less than a second later my and my brothers were screaming!! Bloody murder. Omg i cant describe the horror good enough. Judd took the wettest shit all over the back of the car it was an ass cannon spattering the whole back trunk . My other dog was a casualty and he was covered. Me and my brothers were were gassed and we were frantically hitting the window button but it never worked. My parents were laughing so hard . And they both had their heads out the window. We drove for a moment and we saw a guy on the street and he was scared when a car full of screaming kids pulled up. Mother explained and as he walked closer to the car i saw him visibly hurl. He directed us to the car wash. But what was a Miracle you might ask??? The car was was not only that but a dog wash!!! What?? Never saw that in my life. Needless to saw we put both through the skunk wash cycle and carried on after we cleaned the trunk. And all personal affects were safe. We put everything in the boat so the dogs would have room in the back."

MadeMeSmile,fc44263,t3_efvoq4,1577406086.0,"So this reminds me of my grandmother, Patty. Patty is obsessed with Elvis Presley. She has hundreds of items of memorabilia. Well someone was like ""what do you get someone who has everything??? Ohhh a cut out!!!"" Thats what he did. A life size cut out of Elvis. 

So she set it up in the basement. One day she had to go get something late at night and ran back upstairs screaming like a banshee. ""RALPH!!! SOMEONE BROKE IN!!! HES DOWNSTAIRS!!!"" Grandpa ran down there with his shotgun ready to fuck someone up, saw the figure, turned on the lights. And the intruder was Elvis."

aww,fc3zhav,t1_fc3ecvv,1577402646.0,I didnt believe this till i got a cat. My cat doesnt like to cuddle. Her level of affection is sitting 2 feet from you. Thats fine. But one day when the gear wasnt really working i woke up out of a dead sleep thinking i was dying. Was I? No. She just decided to use my chest and face to warm herself up.
