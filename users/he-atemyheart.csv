indianapolis,ffdy2q1,t3_et0ed0,1579831786.0,Happens everywhere.  I feel like it's not being taught anymore.
suboxone,ffdke92,t1_ffdgavn,1579822740.0,Good point
suboxone,ffdel9b,t1_ffdei9u,1579819238.0,"For real tho, drink as much water and eat as much fiber as you can."
suboxone,ffdei9u,t1_ffd4b6i,1579819190.0,I started at 12mg but I am tapering off after a year and a half. I just went down to 6mg....honestly tho even when I was on 12 I would wake up sweaty and have chills and a bad stomach. Always figured I just burn thru it quickly I guess? The constipation didnt ease up until after I made the jump from 8mg to 6mg. I keep hearing less is more with subs and I'm starting to see why. My body honestly feels better the less I take.
tifu,ffd49sb,t1_ffcrjnx,1579813129.0,This is totally true. Pineapple juice is the best for making it taste sweet but any citrus helps!
suboxone,ffd40zh,t3_esz4hj,1579812993.0,"Drink a shit ton of water. 
For me, I wake up in WD, includes stomach cramps. So I poo before i take my am dose. It helps. Not an every day occurence but at least once a week I can poo without a laxative."

NarcissisticAbuse,ff7i0wr,t3_es1cwi,1579650019.0,"I wouldnt have sex on the boat. In the broad daylight, anchored right next to a family with young children. Watching us literally 2 feet away. 
That deserved my first beating, cheating and didnt speak to me for a week
He then told me it was my fault, I deserved what I got bc I lied about there being kids around. He swears we were the only ones on the water and i made up a lie about kids being near because I'm a filthy slut. 

Right now I'm on the receiving end of day 2 of silent treatment because i had accidentally fallen asleep and wasnt awake to properly greet him when he came over. This also makes me a slutty cunt apparently. 

God bless y'all, I'm so sad that so many other women have to endure this yet I'm so thankful that I can vent to ones that understand these evil psychos 

Also I do have a plan."

NarcissisticAbuse,ff4az7j,t1_ff47crk,1579559404.0,I'm being ignored now too. Fuck these guys.
NarcissisticAbuse,ff4anm7,t3_erjeuk,1579559201.0,"THIS. 

My boyfriend is KING of silent treatment.  If I criticize anything (which I stopped doing about a year ago) have an opinion, ask a question,  breathe wrong he will silently get up, get his stuff call me a selfish bitch, cunt, whore or some combo of a terrible name and then leave. After he leaves he will ignore me completely until he has decided it's now time to talk. The silent treatment now usually lasts 2 sometimes 3 days
 
He just did this. He exploded on me bc I had been asleep when he came over and it took me a minute to come to. I smoked a cigg and tried to talk to him and BOMB goes off you'd think. Today was extra special bc he threw my purse up against the wall and threatened to punch me. It's getting to the point where I am relieved when he leaves bc he just keeps getting worse and worse. I know I wont see him at least until Wednesday now. 

Thank you for posting this.  I've been sitting here with that terrible pain in my gut and heart, alone with my tears. Your post helped me remember that it's not me. Hugs"

I've been with my mm for 2 years and honestly I've been kicking around the idea of what your ap is up to. It gets lonely when hes with his wife and I'm stuck just waiting. The holidays are rough bc I spend them all alone. I deserve somebody too. I know that I will never meet up with them though. Its merely filling the void my guy cant.

Edit to say it's weird to me that she deleted her Reddit account. Why?"

My hair is bleached and I use these conditioning masks I find at walmart in the shampoo aisle. It's like $1.50 for one package which lasts me a week. I'm a daily hair washer. Anyways, those masks help me SOOO MUCH!!! as far as everything else, I'm trying to force myself to drink as much water as I can. Its annoying but it helps. Good luck to you!"
