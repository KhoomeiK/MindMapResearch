corgi,fdcwv4u,t1_fdcwl3b,1578286664.0,"Oh, and that is the cutest name. Is he a big corgi?"
corgi,fdcwu9o,t1_fdcwl3b,1578286644.0,"Yeah, we walk Cheddar three times a day. If she needs to go out more than that, she usually just sits at the doorway or she goes into our washroom and whines."
corgi,fdcwfto,t1_fdbzi6v,1578286298.0,"Crate training is important for your pup. It gives him a place to call his own, and a ‘safe spot’ when he’s upset or anxious. Once he’s older, you won’t have to keep the crate door closed. You can give him freedom to choose where he wants to nap."
corgi,fdcwb88,t1_fd7x4qt,1578286186.0,"You did the right thing keeping her at home. We did the same with our corgi, Cheddar. Plus, we lived in a very urban area and the streets were filthy. She caught giardia a few times after eating random stuff off the street, and this was after she got all of her shots!  
Potty training Cheddar while living in a high rise condo was interesting. LOL. We ended up doing some of her training on our balcony."

corgi,fd76i38,t3_ek6j9g,1578200062.0,"I see you’ve already geared yourself in corgi-wear!  Lol. Congrats on the little bratwurst!  When we potty trained our corgi, we started off with taking her outside every hour or so. Since you’re at a university, I’m guessing pee pad training would be the most convenient. If this is something that you want, then I would recommend you put him on the pee pad every hour, regardless of whether he needs to go or not. When/if he does go, immediately give him a high value treat WHILE they are going. We used liver bits. Corgis are smart and very good motivated. Shouldn’t take too long for them to realize that pee = treat and poop = lots of treats. Following the pee/poop, play with them a bit (tug, fetch, etc). Then crate them until it is time for you to put him on the pee pad again. To help occupy them while in the crate, freeze their daily kibble into puppy Kong’s. Alternatively, if you don’t want to crate them for that long, but yourself a pop up puppy pen. This will keep them contained and help to minimize the ‘accident zone’ in the event of an accident. 

If you need more help, feel free to DM me."
