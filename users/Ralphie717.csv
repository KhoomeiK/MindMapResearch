PlusSize,fef8rwe,t3_eona5w,1579050870.0,Wondering that too. I really like cycling class but things get real uncomfortable and I'm not at the point where I can stand up while riding.
PlusSize,febyuy0,t3_eo5a63,1578964440.0,"I'm a 3XL in their underwear and so far I really like the ones that I have gotten (all briefs or hipsters). I haven't tried the bras or bralettes yet, even though they sell my size (46DD) as I have heard they run small."

DeadBedrooms,fd54mi3,t1_fd4lbel,1578174153.0,"Yes, I am concerned about this as well. It doesn't need to be a super fancy one, just having one in case things go sideways or the landline (presuming you have a landline) goes out."

relationship_advice,fc24ewo,t3_efrfvr,1577339977.0,"I'm sorry this is happening to you. I had a similar friendship end that way. She was my friend the last two years of high school. We would still talk when she was away at school, but when she would come home on break, she was more preoccupied with hanging out with the ""popular"" people from our high school class than me. I got tired of it and her judging me for hanging out at bars and drinking and doing karaoke with friends when I was of legal age. I just gave up trying. I wasn't good enough for her and I didn't feel like keeping it going."

relationship_advice,fbzjipo,t3_efc0rq,1577248810.0,"I know this may sound simple, but have you tried taking a time out from people, like maybe take 20 mintues or so to decompress?
