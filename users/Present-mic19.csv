SuicideWatch,fchrp60,t1_fcar7fe,1577653407.0,"Sometimes it's better to say nothing at all, people aren't obligated on social media to do so. But they do it so that they get the attention."
SuicideWatch,fchrkos,t1_fcasa2u,1577653359.0,"Exactly, no one gives a fuck unless they can be seen on social media, so that they can get likes."
SuicideWatch,fc11dtb,t1_fbycq8e,1577305474.0,"I feel like it's a concurrent event. Like when your happier your more likely to exercise. Also if you're happier your more likely to hold a job, have money, and buy healthy food. 

In reality your only able to do these things because you are feeling better not the other way around. Therefore if your depressed what are you suppose to do?

I know that no one can cure your depression overnight. But when people give you suggestions like ""oh you need to eat better"", instead of really focusing on your problem I can imagine it hurts."
SuicideWatch,fc117ei,t1_fbxr2hr,1577305330.0,"It's like your Psychiatrist is just bouncing your problem to other physiological issues. It's like sure gaining weight is never great. But when you can't afford the ""healthy food"", you can't exercise when you're disabled what are you suppose to do?

I'm sorry that this is what they're suggesting. It really feels like no one cares."
SuicideWatch,fbxp442,t1_fbxov19,1577196452.0,"Yeah I agree. I feel that someone should come to a space where you feel comfortable to talk. I don't always feel a doctors office is the best place for dealing with everything. Most times the doctors make you feel like they don't care.

That's a good way of kinda viewing your anxiety. I'll make note, it's interesting. Definitely better than ""go exercise, and eat healthy""."
