Showerthoughts,ff5wnov,t1_ff4sx9q,1579612742.0,"You could probably intuit a small to medium structure like a house or something, but building something on a grand scale with magic or not is an entirely different matter. 

Take for example the arena for the wizarding world cup. All of that is built on elliptical curves. Its a lot easier to just know how to make ellipses than it is to try to jntuit them when its hundreds of ellipses stacked on top of each other. The seats are at an incline so there is mindfulness of slope otherwise they would be vertiginous. 

I am not saying wizards are stupid, but i think magic would require a knowledge of math if you want to build a sufficiently advanced structure. Buildings with complex features arent just square and circles crammed together, they are carefully merged. Take a look at islamic and renaissance architecture to see what i am talking about. The curves are really complicated."

rareinsults,fdwpof6,t1_fdw8w1e,1578761174.0,"I think a big part of the problem is the ubiquity of the college education. Everyone is expected to at the very least have some sort of college experience. People are coming into university expecting vocational training. They want you to teach them how to perform certain tasks because that is what they have been socialized to expect from education. The school system from kindergarten through high school has been training them to be compliant workers who will do exactly what they are expected to do. Now they only see education from the perspective of it leading to a predetermined reward/goal in this case a job.

They see being presented information contrary to their established world view as another hoop to jump through to get to the goal. They dont know how to integrate information and think for themselves because they literally have never had the opportunity to do so in the past. They are going to pay you lip service because they think if they give you the right answers you will be satisfied and they can go about their way assimilating into their own culture. Narratives of others peoples experiences are purely theoretical because they arent directly related to the goal they have set for themselves."

Showerthoughts,fczqp4y,t3_ejlpng,1578106952.0,"Thats not really how Higher dimensional geometry works. Math has higher dimensional analogs of 3 dimensional objects, but for the most part those only exist in the world of forms, and they help visualize complex data sets in certain way. 

The truth is actually a bit different and maybe more interesting depending on your outlook. You have your 3 general spatial dimensions x, y and z, and i am sure most people are aware of what you can do with those, but we also have time as like an index of the 4th dimension. We call the 4th dimension time but its really more causality, its a continuum that allows things to occur inside.

So objects with three dimensions have 6 degrees of freedom, which are granted to them by T. In abstract algebra there is a system that allows you to create a three dimensional built out of complex numbers, which is homemorphic xyz, and that topological space basically allows tou to visualize the six degrees of freedom in an intuitive manner as functions of i. You can think of these as what most people regard as extra spatial dimensions, and when mathematicians are doing geometry at that level thats what they are attempting to describe. 

A really easy, real world example of this is rotation. I use this dimension a lot when i am programming a CNC table to perform certain actions. The coder who built the interface between the computer and the machine need a dimension to define the rotation of the spindle, that dimension is W. So my cnc table as 4 basic dimensions, its got X, Y, Z, and W for rotation, and then it has other dimensions that would need to be programmed for pitch, roll and yaw.

Sorry if this isnt mathematically robust, i have had a long day, and i am not trying to write an essay. I am sure i could explain things better and use better language and explain the history of quarternions and why they are important better, but this is the best i can do right now."

The AQI for bensenville is often moderate to good, but the air stinks like diesel exhaust no matter where you are.

I am not sure if the tragic things in my life make my work any better or worse, though they do influence the tones and themes of my work. What I do know is, depression made ot very difficult to work. 

During my most depressive time period, i was living like a french decedent in all of the worst ways. I was escaping reality through intoxication and that really affected my perceptions of my work. I was less ambitious, less careful, and less willing to push my limits. I turned out a lot of work i am embarrassed to look at, and i destroyed almost everything i did before i turned 30. 

I am on a lot better path now, and i am able to keep a clear head about my work, and while i still feel depressed i let that fuel my work, my work is a vehicle out of the things that bother me. I am keep more detailed sketch books now and working in a more methodical way. 

I feel like if I had less to prove to myself and others I would probably approach my work differently. I think I would be less real, and more abstract, and I would feel more free. Instead i do these painstaking illustrations that take months to do, because it's the only to say what I want to say about the dialectical tension between death and desire. I am obsessed with that subject matter because it defined me for a long period of time. I dont think that makes my work objectively better than anyone else though."
