knitting,ffahm7f,t3_esjnsk,1579735934.0,It looks like a bobbin used for color work.  The smaller amount colors are carried on the bobbin to keep them tidy.
knitting,ffa9zt1,t1_ff9tnyc,1579730787.0,"Thread or yarn as ""RealisticMail"" said.  Thread would add less bulk, but would not hold securely if the beads have larger holes."
knitting,ff9md0k,t3_esfixd,1579716016.0,"Yes you have it right.  The blanket is knitted diagonally from corner to corner.  The rows increase up to the half blanket which is a triangle, then decrease to complete the other half.

Some potholders or dishcloths are done this way, just much much smaller."
knitting,ff9lw5x,t3_esfj6i,1579715741.0,"They could be stitched on, just be sure to knot off each one, so that if a thread breaks you don't lose the whole lot."
cats,ff8gnvk,t3_es66fa,1579677642.0,The tail is a bit of a give away!  Poor baby.
PuppySmiles,ff8gi0y,t3_es74z4,1579677434.0,I'd say that is a yes!
knitting,ff8gfx5,t3_es1p4y,1579677362.0,Lovely blanket.  Lovelier little dude.
knitting,ff8gc0e,t3_es4ppl,1579677228.0,Really cool!  Love the texture detail on the sleeves.
knitting,ff6v8y0,t3_eryrmb,1579635585.0,"I find the continental method easiest.  You tension the yarn through your left hand (if you are right handed) and the motion of catching the loop is with the right needle and somewhat similar to using the crochet hook.

Casting on can be a challenge, but as Nithuir said, Very Pink Knits on YouTube has great tutorials.  One hint my aunt gave me.  If you use the long tail cast on, cast on over both needles (then slide one out) as this makes your initial loop a bit larger and easier to knit, especially for a beginner."
knitting,ff6npor,t3_eryg7l,1579631094.0,That is really lovely!
knitting,ff3i9wf,t3_ereoqo,1579541620.0,I think you are on the right direction.  But you should do a Swatch with pattern bit.  This will let you know if it looks right or not.  Be sure to document the progression so you can repeat it or change it.
knitting,feebud8,t3_eopxtz,1579030542.0,It's pretty and looks warm!
Zoomies,fee8t1j,t3_eojg7b,1579028763.0,If she is not careful she will hogtie herself.  :-)
cats,fecwchc,t3_eoegwh,1578987223.0,Everybody loves you!
knitting,fecvzgs,t3_eohvb7,1578986807.0,"I use cotton yarn for anything that gets wet. Dish cloths, towels, baby bibs.  
The challenge is that cotton yarn has no stretch in it.  Once you figure out how to tension it, you are going to go."
blop,fecvmwj,t3_eobnth,1578986412.0,Too cute!!
Cooking,fecvks6,t3_eofol4,1578986345.0,Use kluski or country noodles.  Very thick and hearty.  The ones I use take about 25 minutes to cook.  They stand up to refrigeration in the soup without getting soggy.
Cooking,fecukny,t3_eogx1w,1578985206.0,Very simple veggie and chicken stir fry with a bit of brown rice.  Quick and easy for a Monday night.
cats,fece4it,t3_eo7ydp,1578971745.0,OKAY? OKAY?  He is the cutest thing ever!!!!!
knitting,fe8ftps,t3_eo4n3k,1578925702.0,Lavender or teal
Cooking,fe6qabq,t3_eo04r2,1578900380.0,I made a simple cabbage soup with my last batch of corned beef juice.  Just add some shredded cabbage and cook until it is tender.  Quick and so tasty!
knitting,fe6pxt6,t3_enzyl4,1578899942.0,That is too cute!  And the lower edge is so even and pretty.
Cooking,fe6pv3m,t1_fe6gae2,1578899846.0,Make lemon curd and swirl it into the top of a cheesecake just before baking.
knitting,fe0mv60,t3_eni2ov,1578816250.0,"Sometimes knitting isn't about what you wind up with, it's about what it does for your head while you're doing it. It has the ability to take you to a good place when it feels like your world is falling apart around you.
Besides your sock is lovely."
Cooking,fdxtcfp,t3_enaymj,1578772704.0,"Scrub, wrap in foil, bake at 400 F until soft, peel off the skin, mash with butter and a bit of salt!  Yummy!!!   note - Bake on a sheet pan covered with foil or parchment.  They leak sugar and can make a mess in your oven."
Cooking,fdxra2j,t3_enblxz,1578772149.0,"Most of my cookbooks have a Table of Contents in the front, organized by chapter and recipe, and also an index in the back organized by ingredient and dish type.  (Like cookies or beef.)   If your cookbooks don't have the index, you may want to get better, more user friendly ones.  Check before you buy one."

Cooking,fdqdwv8,t1_fdqdjh3,1578664114.0,You may have to make your own.  There are lots of good recipes and as it is a fresh sausage is relatively easy.  You wouldn't even need to put it into casings.
Cooking,fdqdfs7,t3_emqsmi,1578663728.0,"If you can get a mild Italian sausage, just add some spicy red pepper flakes to it."
Cooking,fdq7kpn,t3_emobam,1578658218.0,"What you need is an inventory management app or program.  There are several very good pantry inventory apps available.  ""Out of Milk"" is one that is supposed to be good."
Cooking,fdn1m96,t3_em309e,1578574522.0,"Had one of my favorite ""simple"" foods last night for dinner.  Baked sweet potato with just butter and salt.  Soooo good."
