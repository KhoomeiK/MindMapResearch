Oh okay, I didn't know that, it's super interesting. In my country there is nothing sexist at all in these words and no other word exists to replace them!
I have never flown but I know that the word ""Stewart"" is common in France (Does it exist in America?), But I have never heard ""stewardess"". There is a word to describe a woman who is flight attendant.
It's crazy to see that the same words can be interpreted really differently! :)"

You are not alone. 
The ""irrational part of you that doesn't want to die"" is actually the rational part of you, the sane part of your brain, your consciousness. But depression makes you think that's the wrong one.. 
You might try another therapist or doctor. I've seen around 10 before I found a good one.. That's the same for medicine, it takes time to find the one that help you. Can you try once again? You need to be helped. Really. I worry about you and I want you to receive the help that you deserve. 
You deserve to be happy"

How are you doing? Do you feel better?"
coolguides,fcyfjm5,t1_fcy3cob,1578079338.0,"Yes I understand. Thank you for your answer.
I know that in Sweden people are shy in general, probably really more than American but this country is a really small part of Europe.. I live in France so I can't talk about how it is in others european country, but here except in Paris, I can tell you that people are generally rather welcoming and kind. We do not talk in the bus if we don't know each other yet as exemple, but it's not to ignore, I think it's a kinda question of respect, to not to disturb the other if he doesn't want to be bothered.
But I agree with the fact that every country got this own culture and many of them are not as outgoing as others, just different."

dpdr,fcwwjle,t3_ejaaha,1578040633.0,"Hi, I'm sorry for you.. 
I took singing and piano lessons when I had dpdr.
I found it difficult to do things alone, I couldnâ€™t focus. But thanks to that, I kept this horrible period hanging because my teacher was waiting for me every week, and I would have felt guilty if I had canceled the course.
It helped me a lot. I had a goal every week and I had to leave my house. 

So I advise you to take courses in whatever you want to distract yourself. Even if you don't really enjoy, the time is less heavy when you are busy. And when your dpdr will be over, you'd be able to feel the pleasure to do it may be :)"
aspergers,fcww2fz,t3_ejboy9,1578040038.0,"I worked in a bar, let me tell you that it was a HELL to hear customer talk to me when my colleague was here and put loud music. But when I was alone, I didn't put music or just very quietly. 
People don't seem to be annoyed by loud music or just loud sounds, they seem to like to not being in a awkward silence. 

A client told me ""You are a barmaid, so you have to hear lots of personal things that you don't want to hear, do you?""

No no I compulsively put the glasses away and hardly notice your presence"

I HATE it. I see happy people posting happy post on social media and I hate them. I hate their happiness. I hate their smile. I'm so rude but I hate everything right now and I want myself to die

I'm sorry for you. I hope you'll fall asleep soon and have a lovely night. I know how much it's hard, but tomorrow  will be just another day, and I hope a good one.

Talking about the death is hard to do with people in real life and everybody seems to hide their feelings when they've lost someone. (I can completely understand) It's like a secret thing that you shouldn't talk about. But I believe that we should share those bad moment with others so we can understand and learn what we should do when it happens. 
The only point of view of death that I had before you wrote that, was the huge pain and I never thought it could bring positive things after. 
I don't know if it's clear (I'm not a native) but thank you so much."
