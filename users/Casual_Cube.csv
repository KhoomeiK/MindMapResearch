Also are you on official or unofficial? Do you have access to S+ Nanny engram?"
ARK,ff8ncqg,t1_ff8j6pz,1579687205.0,"Its definitely doable. Heres how. - You convert a normal dino into a tek to breed with the other tek.  
Start by leaving some scrap metal to cook and crafting polymer and electronics.  
Feed Biotoxin to a normal dino (that has a tek version) that you need to convert to Tek. Depending on the level you need to feed a bunch. I think theres a calculator out there for this, ""try tek dino convert calculator"" or something along those lines.   
Once you know for sure you fed the right amount (you can go over just dont be under), then it should have passed out. (need to do this fast and near a transmitter/Obi). Then upload polymer (not organic) and electronics to a tek transmitter (not sure if this works with the obi) and upload the dino as well at least 30sec-1min after.   
The Dino can be done from transmitters or obis, doesn't matter. Then you need to smelt a stack of scrap metal before the items you uploaded expire. Keep it in your ""zero slot"".  
 I don't know how much you'll need exactly for the conversion but a stack will make sure anything upto like 400 level will be doable. 

Then be ready the next day for the timer. It will need to be timed right so be careful. The materials uploaded have a ""window"" after it expires in the transmitter. The window takes place because within the next 30 seconds and you need to download the dino from the obi who will be passed out still, and feed it the scrap metal from the 0 slot quickly (idk but it works) and upload it back fast. It only asks for a few and there is no cooldown so it'll keep eating rapidly from your hand.   
When you fed enough, it will say ""Somethings happening"" instead of ""press E to feed"".

Quickly upload it back and wait until the next worldsave which can be around 20 minutes usually. Now when you check the uploaded creatures, you can see a tek version of the exact dino with the same stats and levels instead. Don't know why WC made it so complicated but atleast we know how it works. 

Hope this helped! Good Luck!"

Preparing a takedown on a large scale crime ring like this takes planning and time, if you jump at the smallest 'tip' and pick up a concierge based on it, you could potentially alert the prime suspects and potentially the actual culprit who is responsible for the entire thing. Add to that the involvement of celebrities and other high profile individuals, it can be reasonable to think that a fellow comedian/actor coming up to the FBI with a tip can be ignored and told that nothing is being done about it to avoid a scare to the actual villain in the weeds.

ARK,fckh2np,t1_fck19s9,1577725173.0,"Thanks for the detailed response and for taking the time. 

While I agree there are ways single player games can trick player perspectives to boost performance, I still think ARK's ""vicinity computing"" is extremely under handled and let run wilder than can be justified. It makes me wonder if they are plain ignoring it or just putting it off repeatedly. I don't think they even have sprites for enough objects that could fix it. The games I think of that also do this would be like Rust, hurtworld, witcher, warframe, the new AC games and so on. Perhaps Ark holds the spot for the heaviest world and has earned some leeway but I still think this goes beyond the excusable.  
Then comes the graphic settings that don't actually do anything. Half those options have fewer gradients in between min and max than it lets you believe and the over the top ""effects"" they put in are just stressing the engine needlessly. I didn't like this at all when I realized it. Ark is the only game I have had so many issues with that sells itself as a complete game and stresses my PC so much. That's not just looking at the graphics but the physics and mechanics of it all like the hitboxes, mesh, balancing, bug fixing etc etc.

With such a promising concept and running start, I too feel like this is one of my biggest disappointments when playing a game. The engine is by far the biggest issue and you seem to see that too.   
As I said before its just gross mismanagement and complete lack of care for its performance, as if ""it runs fine on low, thats what pve players care and if we please them, were fine"".

I cry."
ARK,fcjvo7p,t1_fciwwsp,1577706992.0,"sadly no. not all that common atleast, i'm sure there are devoted fans of it who insist on using it but for efficiency there are too many other creatures and climbing isnt all that useful. maybe in abb it could be more common?"
ARK,fcjvig5,t1_fcjschi,1577706773.0,"I'm sick of this tired old argument. Please read the following with an open mind.  
Firstly, lets get this out of the way; DS3 has hardlock 60fps but without it i imagine it runs much higher and the witcher 3 actually has some issues with optimization but also looks amazing(compare geralt and your average bob for instance). Both games indefinitely run better than ARK. no surprise either, but also by a disproportionately large margin. Removing frame locks and hardware limitations, ie; 9900k+2080ti, you can really see what the disparity looks like between these titles and ark. Do you really believe a computer will have trouble loading 100 animal models and a few thousand models of building parts (like the countless other games that do this already). 

I agree, games like ark and rust will never reach AAA titles of optimization, funding or quality and will always have heavier workloads for a processor to handle at a given sample scene simply in number if not just raw render. But upgrading a graphics card to 2 tiers higher still nets you 10-30 frames man.   
Trust me, WC has grossly under-performed and mismanaged in the graphics and physics sections of the game, going for looks, feels and additional content that they can capitalize on and not actually for efficiency, quality or qol (and I don't mean the once in a while inventory size change, an intern can make those changes in 10 minutes). I believe this attitude may stem from their ""Pvp players dont need it, away with it, they are the vocal ones anyway"" mentality which is evident in many changes in the past.

  
Partly this blame can be put on the older engine that they run on, but this is still irresponsible of the company as a whole rather than ""technically this"" or ""technically that"". Therefore there is equal blame to go with their poor financial management, prioritization and work ethics.

  
If you still feel there is an argument to be made for them, feel free to let me know below."
