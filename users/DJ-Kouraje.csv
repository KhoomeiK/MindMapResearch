doomfistmains,fej9t2q,t1_fei1yoy,1579163206.0,"I‚Äôm not great at the game, so I‚Äôm definitely a normie, but I like this idea. Maybe since I‚Äôm still pretty new at doom, I‚Äôll learn the style of RP a squishy, and then upper/slam out. I‚Äôm in such a habit of engaging with slam/upper and then RP out that this might help me grow even more. I hope they adjust him back soon though. Really annoyed about this change."
