careerguidance,ff7bhy0,t1_ff5yxe5,1579645559.0,Oh I definitely keep a backup plan. The job I have now would not have trouble hiring me back due to high turn over and I already been doing it for 3 years. Just thought I could wing it and see how it goes. I'm not totally clueless on this stuff. I learned windows and Mac in highschool as well as windows 2000 and server management. So I have confidence in the idea.
careerguidance,ff5w336,t1_ff511s2,1579612208.0,Because they want some of years of experience. Which I can only attribute to things outside of work. I never finished my collage since I had to get a full time job and help my parents pay rent. School really want for me and I'm wondering if I should just this something at the wall and see if it sticks.
careerguidance,ff4w7zc,t3_erdmhn,1579573932.0,"I like not being homeless so I will go in 9-5 to a job I hate. Just gonna have to do it till I don't have to anymore. I hate the patronizing phrase "" It's your choice to work here."" Yeah no not if I want to be hungry and not begging on a intersection in front of Walmart where you will drive by watching me freeze."
ABoringDystopia,feklrgh,t1_fejeaot,1579202690.0,"Thanks, he is very articulate. He ought to be as a public speaker. He makes his points clear on how CO2 is not the cause of the increase in average temperatures. The cause idk what it is since I wouldn't have the education to find that. There has to be something said why as of 2019 the consensus amongst climate scientists having the opinion it is human activity. As I don't have time to read 11,000+ essays on the consensus, I would ask for a highlight from a few to get an idea. We are indeed getting more hotter days over 100Â°F at least in Iowa where I reside. I have always been sceptical of how the situation benefits businesses. If CO2 is a problem then car manufactures will have to make a change, invest more money in RnD, and scrap future road maps on future vehicle releases. If CO2 behind a greenhouse has is a farce then we people just want to for some reason crater a vendetta against industrial industries. Pollution is a net negative so there is that motive.

I thank you for your help on my understanding on the subject."
ABoringDystopia,fej9x7v,t1_feivgus,1579163367.0,I've been on the fence for like a week because that has been as long as I cared about the subject and I have a hard time getting a convincing sceptics point of view. There was a consensus study amongst climate scientists that unanimously agree with climate change being caused by humans. I would like to ask a real human rather then googling for another essay written by someone that's only evidence is a straw man.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fcj16zp,t1_fcij9qa,1577674723.0,"I'm confused, are you saying that just because they are people of different skin color  from the original source that means they can't do a better job? This doesn't really hold water in my head. There is no reason for their looks to affect their performance.

Edit:I'm not saying that they should cater to me and other people of color either when casting obviously. This works both ways in a way that their race shouldn't really matter in casting."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fchmgzu,t1_fch2i2x,1577651839.0,Police in inner cities see some stuff dude. You're speaking of places that have a lot crime rate like small towns and junk. But yeah I don't trust people of authority because they have the power to abuse it. So they create issues out of pride because they got little penises.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fch209c,t3_eh39yf,1577646514.0,Critics of faithfulness to the original media need to understand that unless that character's race or sexual orientation was integral to the character itself then you gain or lose nothing by changing those aspects. Inclusivity is important to those like myself that lack any relatability to a lot of things portrayed in media. A character like Mulan a character created and built with her nationality and race in mind should not be changed in a adaptation. A character like Gandalf or Frozone from the Incredibles doesn't really have any toes in their character to their race.

SuicideWatch,fbzhkh7,t1_fbzgye6,1577246930.0,I keep wrestling with whether I could of done anything. I honestly seen it coming for a while and was going he was too chicken to do it. I would always ask how he is holding up and I would never believe he was well. I just knew I could show him a sliver of respect and a enjoyable time. He hardly got either in his every day. All of Facebook sending condolences when none of them freaking cared.

SuicideWatch,fbzg9fx,t3_efayhs,1577245686.0,Sounds like you are have some social anxiety. You sure it's not in your head man? Like dude you need to keep going. Start living for yourself and not those who you are positive think that you are holding them back. Try and find something you can be good at and put your very being into it. It has helped me when I am low in periods of my life.
