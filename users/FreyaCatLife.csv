I think the barrier you may have is in knowing what to insult. I mean you could insult a spoon for being silver or steel from appearance, but that isn't an insult. 

There are a LOT of nations and some of us don't even have creation stories in common never mind language so you might need to narrow your insults down to a language group or nation. Find out something specific (take mine we have Dirawong a goanna (lizard) who is a hero like animal) and insult that. You could be like 'you have a story that has a lizard as a hero and that is unlikely to have existed'  and I could say '.....yep'. But no fireballs."

nextfuckinglevel,ff8ffz0,t1_ff8d6ab,1579676158.0,"Well I've had a lot of chats to Maoris in general.  I come from the coast we have a lot there, but usually I get asked questions from people (generally white people) who, having seen Maori tatts (as such) want the same thing but aussie version. Or foreigners think we share the same type of culture because the countries are so close. 

I don't know anymore about Maori culture than most people. Royalty instead of elders, Hakas, geography of NZ,  etc. This is partly due to ignorance and partly due to trying to remember Indigenous histories of which there are a lot and of course the creation stories and dreamtime are different and vary so much not to mention the soap opera that can be nations trying to decide on anything. 

I always feel bad for disappointing white aussies who want to have indig history portrayed in some form but all they often know is the rainbow serpent. Which is incredible in some nations (where the rainbow serpent is the hero of the story) and my nation (where we have our own story about our goanna scaring it away) ,it is an odd choice. 

 No Indig don't have tatts specially for things and not really scarification... I mean we do have body mods but that's earned not.. tatted. I love tribal tatts that mean a lot, esp in Maori culture don't have any but if I did I'd probably get Dirawong (the goanna) , since he/it means so much. 

I wonder how different Maori is from Indig languages? I think that would be so interesting to study. aust indig languages, nz and then polynesian tongan tuvalu etc. 

My hypothesis based on nothing would be that in the trading routes they would have been common colloquial words at least (or a common understanding)  

Unfortunately, Tasmania is exempt from this fof obvious reasons."

Since we didnt have paper we used rocks and sticks. Although we did have skins (particularly possum) and I think they were probably used by some nations.

The general 'hello' 'hello' how are you' 'I am well thank you, how are you' with the focus on eye contact etc isn't seen traditionally according to my nation as I am aware (all codicils in place for the inevitable person coming in 'thats not how my nation does it') as polite. Think of it more as soapbox but quieter. You're addressing everyone and no one. You're talking communally. Think of it as a comedian on stage if there isn't a stage. They can't make eye contact because they generally can't see the audience. 

This isnt to say private communication doesnt happen of course it does, but even I growing up in only Western society I feel really uncomfortable with eye to eye contact. It seems so...intrusive? My son is the same way. When we have our emotional talks we don't do eye contact."

nextfuckinglevel,ff7mwav,t1_ff7kkkx,1579653360.0,"No it isn't. :) That's ceremonial not aggressive. The paint on the stick means a great deal. It is telling a story. I'm not of that nation (I'm Bundjalung a different tribe or rather, nation) but we use sticks for pretty much everything.

 Message sticks that can be translated by other nations (if you needed a specialised doctor from a few nations away you would send em off with a translator and a stick to show that they have safe passage to travel through lands) and when you die you get your own stick which in art form is literally the story of your life painted. Your epitaph. Granted, they aren't written as a non Indigenous would understand, but we also don't generally do the European call and response form of communication either."

I'm a koala not a bear

And I don't think it's fair

The way that people always add a word that isn't there

I'm a marsupial and proud of it

And there can be no doubt of it

I'm closer to a kangaroo than I am to a bear



So please dont call me a koala bear

Coz I'm not a bear at all

Please don't call me a koala bear

It's driving me up the wall

If your name was Tom

And everyone called you Dick

Perhaps you'd understand why I'm sick, sick, sick

I'm simply a koala

And I want the name to stick

So please don't call me a koala bear



I live here in Australia

In a eucalyptus tree

I'm as cuddly, cute and charming

as an animal can be

I don't understand fair dinkum

How anyone could think them

Grizzly bears and polar bears

Are anything like me



So please dont call me a koala bear

Coz I'm not a bear at all

Please don't call me a koala bear

It's driving me up the wall

If your name was Tom

And everyone called you Dick

Perhaps you'd understand why I'm sick, sick, sick

You can read books like raising boys. You can talk to his year advisor and teachers about him and his interests. 

Just talk to him. 

I am pretty honest with my now 17 year old. He knows that my childhood was crap (although not the details) and that I had him young and by 'surprise'. I am pretty open so I will say 'Im not sure how to approach this topic but....' or 'I know this is the sort of talk no one wants to have but these are the facts about (sex talks)'. Sometimes I am like 'I know it is hard to be alone on grandparents day at school. I really wanted better for you.' 
 
What I have found is hardest are eye to eye talks with him. So when he wants to talk to me about feelings and doesnt want to face me we do with no judgement through a closed door or in a dark room or while im driving. 

You seem pretty hard on yourself. No one gets it right all the time. I can tell you I have had my eyes glaze over hearing about the 50th terraria mod.

Today I had the same compulsion to ask people I love if they hate me with no evidence so instead.... 'Toss a coin to your witcher....'. because my brain came up with that first. Sometimes 'do the bartman' gets a spin. 

We learn to cope with ocd and you are doing so well in this victory."
