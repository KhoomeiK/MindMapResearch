aww,fe2rpsj,t1_fe2exx1,1578842141.0,"I've had a fountain for two years now. Neither anything fancy, cost something like £10-20 on Amazon.

We replaced the first one mainly due to difficulties keeping it clean. During the summer, we'd get a pink mould/bacterial film blooming in the corners of the plastic pieces. And due to the way lots of parts were - hollow but bulging out, so concave on the opposite side - they were a bitch to keep clean. The motor was all sealed and not cleanable. We'd try to disinfect it in some bleach, but I suspected it was contributing to the problems.

The new one we picked basically because of having a cleanable motor and more flat looking parts. So far, it's doing better, but we've only had it since autumn.

I honestly don't think there's gonna be much difference in how long different motors last, since they're all done on the same principle. I suspect sometimes you'll just end up with a lemon, as is often the case with Chinese online sellers."

In my opinion, it's pretty much impossible to make correct geopolitical predictions on anything more specific than broad region wide trends. But humbly admitting that fact together with your own fallibility would not bide well for your popularity as an author and a speaker."

explainlikeimfive,fdakp77,t1_fd93rzn,1578247132.0,You can see my reply about 'bureaucrats' on the [comment below yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ekaedm/eli5_canadian_here_im_having_a_hard_time/fdakkxh/).
explainlikeimfive,fdakkxh,t1_fda12sy,1578247081.0,"Your comment perfectly elucidates why it's so fucking crazy to be ranting and raging against the deep state.

Hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats are making millions of mundane decisions which are wholly inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Sure, getting ticketed by your city cops impacts you and your fellow residents. But if things get really out of control, you will get together and contact your mayor and the city council, who are elected. And if these ***municipal democractic institutions*** are performing to par, your issues will get rectified by them.

In fact, you brought up the perfect analogy with the police. Here in the UK, we actually elect regional (think state-level) police commissioners. It's a new change brought in 2011. No more unelected deep state control over policing!

***The turnout last year was 26.6%***, the highest it's ever been! No one gives a shit. Democracy doesn't work on such a microscopic level. And all these deep state nuts would, what, host elections for bureacrats in the Post Office, the EPA, the DMV and wherever else too?

The electorate doesn't care. No one's gonna turn out and vote. People are too busy to care, and especially far too busy to *get informed* before voting."

*Default option, no biases, large dating pool.*

If you are gay, **cool**, fine, epic.

*Small dating pool, sexual partners that you can better relate to than the opposite sex, shared level of libido*

If you are trans, cool, fine, epic, ***sorry to hear that***.

*Decide if you wanna be pre- or post-op, pay out of pocket for surgery, problems with documents, sexual identification, segregated bathrooms, etc.*

Seriously, I feel like being trans would totally suck compared to everything else, I really feel for those guys. By far the hardest to come to grips with, by far the most work to be done to adjust to the world and yourself."

But it could lead Iran to execute its ""nuclear option"": mining the strait of Hormuz.

This would disrupt the shipping of the majority of the world's oil, creating a worldwide recession. Trump would have to kiss his ""record setting economy"" bye bye in the election year.

I'll let you speculate on what would happen next yourself."
worldnews,fcydm2g,t1_fcy83rz,1578078449.0,"People can't grasp how geopolitics works. It was the same thing with ""good guy"" Russia coming in to fight ISIS, too.

Although tbh I can't call what Iran is doing as ""bad guy"". It's just that their interest are diametrically opposed to ours.

With their historic adversary Iraq in disarray (thanks to us!), they're doing their best to establish as much influence as they can over the various militias and leaders that constitute its broken pieces. They're trying to cement themselves as the regional hegemon. Can you really blame them? It's their neighborhood, and it's a mess.

Unfortunately for them, the US has a vested interest there, too. As does Turkey. As does Russia through their ally/pawn Syria. Saudis are too busy getting their asses kicked by the Iran-supported Houthis to stick their nose in. And Israel's just happy as long as everyone is too busy to pay attention to them building settlements."
