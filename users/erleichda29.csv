ABoringDystopia,ffaep59,t1_ffadukx,1579733923.0,Sure they do. It's always someone who literally has never used homeless services who are sure what's available.
ABoringDystopia,ffadnsd,t1_ffac61b,1579733108.0,Targeting people who have no choice is a bad thing. No one is kicking out the people drenched in perfume or cologne.
ABoringDystopia,ffaap06,t1_ffa5arg,1579731190.0,I've been homeless. Several times.
ABoringDystopia,ffaanfw,t1_ffa9rz9,1579731164.0,Why?
ABoringDystopia,ffa2ly1,t1_ff9xehc,1579726637.0,"Most people with your views consider being talked to at all by a homeless person to be ""harassment"". The vast majority of homeless people are not on drugs, are not severely mentally ill or violent."
ABoringDystopia,ffa2dsc,t1_ff94xsn,1579726508.0,"Unfortunately, even libraries are starting to kick homeless people out for things like falling asleep and ""hygeine"" issues."

PMDD,ff9t7j4,t3_esgmws,1579720737.0,Does this mean we would have symptoms from any extra estrogen? Could foods and medications that increase estrogen also cause symptoms?

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff3n213,t1_ff25380,1579544560.0,"Lots of sunscreen, long sleeves and staying in the shade."
AmItheAsshole,ff3mz1t,t1_ff2cso0,1579544507.0,I did read them. And I think you are confusing domestic violence shelters with homeless shelters.

homeless,ff3min4,t3_eremhz,1579544224.0,They should be counting empty houses and apartments not people who have already been put in a database.

exjw,ff1yqn2,t1_ff1ncfq,1579489271.0,I think believing in things that don't exist is the very definition of delusional.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff1yjrn,t1_ff1una8,1579489140.0,"I think you're confused. Neither Bernie nor his followers are ""vote blue no matter who!"". And how do you know what people will do if he loses the nomination?"
LateStageCapitalism,ff1fdk1,t1_ff1eqhp,1579478402.0,"To be fair, they might have been homeless before as well. Plenty of homeless people have internalized classism and hobophobia."
Antipsychiatry,ff1etj8,t1_ff1be13,1579478294.0,My original comment was polite and a simple request. You made it into something that needed to be argued over.
LateStageCapitalism,ff18qhn,t1_ff17gt4,1579476370.0,Which person? Because I've actually been homeless. Only been housed again since last June.
MapPorn,ff116sy,t1_ff0z6uz,1579474233.0,Thank you.
exjw,ff114l1,t1_ff0yw7z,1579474212.0,"True but it's weird that being religious is considered ""normal"" by psychiatry up to a point and then suddenly it's ""mental illness""."

PMDD,ff0wgky,t3_eqzxme,1579472926.0,PMDD is currently thought to be a genetic disorder causing an abnormal reaction to normal hormonal fluctuations.
exjw,ff0vdm4,t1_ff09spa,1579472659.0,What makes you think this is something a psych ward would be called for? What makes you think it's mental illness at all? Some people just suck.

delusionalartists,ff0o101,t1_ff0nfri,1579470643.0,Agreed. I didn't mean every scribble should be saved but anything that takes time and effort should be.
LateStageCapitalism,ff0ngip,t1_ff0lmsx,1579470552.0,And I've seen violent housed people do desperate shit before. Even went on a date with someone who went on to commit a mass shooting spree. You don't get to stereotype groups for the actions of individuals.
LateStageCapitalism,ff0ir0x,t1_ff0cwz4,1579469228.0,"People refuse to believe that homeless people that don't fit this stereotype even exist and are actually the majority. You believe stereotyping propaganda, not facts."
LateStageCapitalism,ff0i0cx,t1_fezwji0,1579469063.0,"Then why haven't all straight men gotten a  bad rep? They, as a group, have done a lot more of that behavior than homeless people."

exjw,ff0f9ml,t1_ff0eikm,1579468292.0,Social media is being used to spread propaganda and sway elections around the globe. It's actually a pretty serious problem.
homeless,ff0efsg,t1_ff07wit,1579468111.0,Wow. I've also been homeless. Nothing I said was passive aggressive.

AmItheAsshole,ff0a9xq,t3_er1322,1579466871.0,You should pull out your camera and be very obvious about taking their picture. That's what I did when I was visibly homeless and had people doing the same. They always stopped immediately.
AmItheAsshole,ff099tw,t3_er0hrw,1579466588.0,"Why does your partner say you can't tell her no? Of course you can! It should be his responsibility but if he won't tell her, go ahead and do it yourself. If she's mad, oh well. Guess she shouldn't have invited herself!"

AmItheAsshole,ff06owr,t1_fezyk56,1579465734.0,It's uncomfortable for HIM. We don't know if she's also uncomfortable. She may have no desire to move.

homeless,ff05y6q,t1_fezwtbi,1579465558.0,"No, I'm responding in general. The PIT count is required by federal government  for agencies to get funding. It does nothing to get people housed, to create housing or to increase shelter and services."
homeless,ff05k47,t1_fezvquv,1579465407.0,"Very few people are going to tell you their stories. The questions asked by the census aren't going to be telling you their stories either. It's nice you'll be handing out snacks. Just remember, the PIT count does very little to improve conditions for unhoused people. Being counted by strangers is humiliating, try not to take it personally if people don't want to engage."

homeless,fezuocj,t3_eqzsy8,1579461888.0,Yep. But it keeps the homeless industrial complex churning and makes everyone think they're actually helping.
AmItheAsshole,fezu4z3,t1_feznzz1,1579461686.0,"You know it's possible for adults to get over a crush, right? He's not recovering from a relationship that ended. His only ""suffering"" was created entirely by his own mind. You're responding as if this is a situation she has some responsibility in. She doesn't."

Anarchy101,fezggux,t3_equ5ft,1579457094.0,Currency is just a marker of capital. Real capital is material assets. Creating your own money doesn't give you automatic access to resources.

AmItheAsshole,feza3hh,t1_fexbh1n,1579455222.0,Asking her to move so he doesn't have to deal with his own feelings is not fair no matter how much notice he gives.
UnresolvedMysteries,fez8vbs,t1_fewvcrz,1579454927.0,No. If he had been my son or son in law I would have called him that. He was my daughter's ex and her child's father.

Look up when meals are at the local mission and go talk to some people. They will know better than we will what is already easy to get and what things are needed.
