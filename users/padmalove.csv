AskAnEscort,ff7rgiw,t1_ff7j4zv,1579656565.0,"Thank you for an honest answer. 

The problem with asking a question, or series of questions like this on a public board, is there are so many different types of providers out here, it’s really hard to quantify the answers in a meaningful way, but I’ll give you what is true for me.

I am upper high end in Chicago ($1,200 minimum for 90 min). I’m doing an accelerated masters degree, with a lot of clinical hours involved, so my time is precious. I generally average a couple of clients a week, and rarely more than two clients in a day. I know that I emotionally don’t have the wherewithal to deal with more than that, and still show up for my partner, when I get home. I have on rare occasions seen three, when I already knew all of them, and was trying to keep regulars happy, but I was exhausted by the end of it. I really see someone on the weekends, as most of my clients are married, and weekdays are easier for them to slip away. If I see someone for a weekend, it’s generally a FMTY. 

I don’t list my phone number on advertisements, so unsolicited text messages are a never. I do receive several emails today, but only respond to messages that seem to have a serious intent.

If you feel service has been slipping, I suggest having a serious conversation with her. Let her know you’re willing to pay full price, but only if she is consistently on time, and not canceling appointments. 

As for how “dry” her *vagina* is, please do a little bit of research, and educate yourself. How dry, or self lubricating she may be, has almost nothing to do with how many people she has had sex with in a day. It has everything to do with age, hormones, time in her cycle, and how turned on she is.

Sleep. I like to be in bed by 10:00, and lights out by 10:30.  The varies slightly, if my partner works the later evening. I don’t take dates past 8 PM. We generally get up by 6:00 am, so we can work out, and have breakfast before my partner goes to work."

veganrecipes,fe3appj,t3_enpk99,1578847594.0,"I would say this makes eight generous meal size portions, or quite a bit more as a side. 

1 medium yellow onion, diced
1/3 cup all purpose flour
1 Tbsp dried basil
2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 Tbsp tomato paste
3 Tbsp olive oil (I used coconut oil) 
2-3 cups sliced mushrooms or your choice. (I used shiitake and button)  
-4 cups broth (I use better than bullion brand, no chicken base style)
-2 (14.5 oz) cans petite diced tomatoes (I like the fire roasted ones)
-2 cans jack fruit, (I think soy curls would work great also.)
-4 cups kite hill farms tortellini (or whatever brand you like. I think fresh pasta of any style, not just stuffed would be great too)
-3 cups packed spinach (you can definitely add more than this if you want) I personally doubled the greens, and used power greens mix from Costco, because that’s what I had on hand.
-1 can coconut cream, can use milk but won’t be as rich
Salt and pepper to taste

The method below is for using a slow cooker, I made mine on the stove top last night. I sautéed the onions and garlic until soft, added flour to make a rue, then added all liquids, including tomatoes, brought to a simmer added the jackfruit and mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are soft, then add pasta cook until finished, throw in the greens right before serving. 

In a microwave-safe bowl add the onions, flour, basil, garlic, tomato paste and drizzle with olive oil. Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds or so. (The mixture will be pasty and look weird but don’t worry it will all be okay in the end). Add the mixture to the slow cooker*.
Add broth, tomatoes, jackfruit, mushrooms, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.
Cover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours, And add in tortellini and spinach, Coconut milk. 
Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!"

The substitutions I made are one can of coconut milk instead of cream, kite Hill Farms vegan tortellini (any vegan ravioli or tortellini will work), Beyond Meat sausage, Better Than Bouillon, no chicken base (any light colored vegetable broth will work, but this is by far my favorite). I also doubled the greens. I used Costco brand, power greens mix, because that’s what I had on hand. I also added a couple of cups of sliced shiitake mushrooms, because I love mushrooms.

The vegetable dish is vegan hotdogs that I needed to get used up, sautéed until crispy then add vegetables and sauté until slightly under done. I have some pre-cooked mixed grains in the freezer already that will be added to these. The one I ate today was without grains, and I threw a little bit of the chipotle Bitchin’ sauce on, which made a surprisingly yummy sauce. I usually just use it to dip crunchy things in.

The salads are a mix of baby kale and baby arugula chopped up with some pre-shredded cabbage and carrots (coleslaw mix), in the bowls are blueberries walnuts and avocado. On the side is homemade pita chips, and some vegan cheese that will get added when they are eaten, and maybe some tomatoes if I make it to the grocery store.

I am doing breakfast for the month next, and will add that in a separate post.
