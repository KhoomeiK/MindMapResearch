Dogtraining,ffef3oq,t3_et5x6d,1579845619.0,"First, it's absolutely reasonable and doable to insist that a dog ask permission before being allowed access to something. I usually expect a polite sit with quiet attention before almost anything that my dog wants. With the couch/bed he will rest his head on it, while sitting quietly, until he's told he can come up. Does he sneak on the bed sometimes when we're not home? Yes (you can hear the thud as he hits the floor, when you're coming in the front door) - but that will happen if you have a ""no bed, ever"" rule too, lol. Second- almost without exception firm boundaries will  increase a dog's affection and attachment,not reduce it. If you are a soft touch (ie you spoil them and don't make them follow rules) they might hang around you for food, but they won't truly respect and adore you. Keep being firm. In fact, if you have less time to spend with your dog, I'd recommend spending it doing frequent training sessions (classes are best, but even youtube has some great stuff - just make sure it's heavily on the positive reinforcement side of things, and don't listen to stuff that goes on too much about dominance and being the ""alpha"" to your dog (imho)). Done right your dog will see you as super interesting and worthy of respect. And lastly--don't stress too muchðŸ˜Š
Good luck!"
Dogtraining,ff2aif7,t3_er5yxz,1579498722.0,"The first thing I would say is that *any* dog can redirect during a fight, and anyone with half a brain knows not to stick their hands in the middle of a dogfight. I know that probably doesn't much help soothe the anxiety of what's occurred, but it's true.
Adding chaos and pecieved aggression/intrusion to a dog's ""mental load"" when they are already dealing with a confrontation is enough to overload even a usually very placid, bite averse dog's bite inhibition.
Having said that, you obviously don't want a replay. Can you physically separate the dogs at mealtime?"
rant,ff27df2,t3_er5we4,1579495921.0,Lolololol. This is *awesome*. You're not just a cunt- you're a funny cunt;)
Dogtraining,fdphq28,t3_emi3dj,1578628936.0,"NO. It is most definitely *not* recommended! What does she think the dog is indicating? That he/she is feeling cosy and at ease?? . Please stop doing this right now. Apart from a potential bite injury, the *dog* is usually the loser, when it's rejected/rehomed (or euthanased!) , for biting, when it tried *repeatedly* to tell you how uncomfortable/freaked out it was. The dog can't speak. But it **is** communicating.  This is so alarming to me that this isn't common sense:S
Holy moly...


Edit: spelling"
Dogtraining,fdllpu4,t1_fdky9bn,1578526863.0,"Suspicious of what?? Lol. That he's secretly Kujo? Enjoy your dog. Be ready to ride some waves as he grows, but it's possible they'll be small to non existent. My fella I got as a rescue at 12 months. He was quiet (as in, silent), calm, sweet natured and a thinker from the get go, despite (we think) never having seen a vet, and having very little actual training. Friends and family said he was in shut down and I wouldn't know what he was *really* like for months. Nope- he just got better and better. Not. One. Hitch.
Sounds like you have a lovely, even-tempered and intelligent dog. 
EnjoyðŸ˜Š"

dogs,fdfv8mb,t1_fdflwxh,1578371112.0,"Actually, the kids are also neglected--by the parents making them/allowing them to be responsible for an aggressive dog."
Dogtraining,fd7fmjn,t3_ek3k2n,1578203720.0,"I use ""Put it away"" in a sing song voice, and treat every time he gets it. . I started with getting him to put his ball in a backpack after ball sessions. I'd hold the bag open under his head and say the command. He knew I wanted something, so he tried different things until he lucked on dropping it in. I treated heavily (ball is a big deal to relinquish for him). This became routine after every outing.
Then I started picking up toys and saying the same sing song command while dropping them in his basket. Then I'd just say the command and wait. He got the idea pretty quickly. We still are at the level of one toy at a time, treating after each one. I'm starting to add ""Let's clean up!"" before the routine, so that hopefully by the time I'm dropping out some of the treats (ie asking him to do multiple toys per treat) the general command will be something he recognises too.
He is 3/4 border Collie, if that matters in any way. They do tend to be pretty eager to please and entertained by these types of exercises as I'm sure you know! Good luck:)"

dogs,fc29gqp,t1_fc1g63w,1577346974.0,"Sorry? Because shelters have lots of  ""sweet puppies"" that are pits, thats proof that they are not aggressive/ have not been bred for aggressive traits? That's silly. There is research in *humans* that suggests there are genetic factors in later psychopathy and aggression, which can express in adulthood with or without maltreatment in childhood--but are much more likely to express *with* maltreatment. Most of these kids are not running around with a kitchen knife at 1 year old. They're ""friggin sweet"", like all other babies. There is a complex interplay of genetics and environment for all living things. But genetics is still strongly predictive for aggressive behaviour in these dogs."
