HealthyFood,ff8zlqt,t1_ff8ng3n,1579701013.0,Thank you! We’ve never bought them before so I’ve just been putting them in random stuff for the hell of it.

NewParents,fez67vm,t1_fewh5db,1579454201.0,I didn’t! He did it for a while and then crawled over to me to go to sleep.

AskReddit,fev7esf,t3_eqouu3,1579394035.0,I where a lot of flannels. And I’m a mom
college,fea6da4,t3_eo50o7,1578944873.0,When I was in nursing school I drove an hour each way and then was there 8am-8pm at least twice a week. It was hard but it’s doable. If it’s too much change your schedule around during the first week.
AskReddit,fe9zn42,t3_eo3q9l,1578942881.0,I’m at work with a boss who would’ve loved to have me naked months ago if I hadn’t been married. Sooo I don’t really want to know how that would go
NewParents,fe5eitw,t1_fe41t8r,1578868420.0,That’s exactly what he does! It’s really funny because since I’ve posted this he hasn’t had a hard fall on his head. I think the fall that triggered this post made him realize he needed to be more careful and he has only fallen on his butt since with minimal crying. I have a few foam tiles from a Christmas gift that I’m gonna keep in his play area but otherwise I think we will just have to watch him and hope he keeps falling on his bottom.
NewParents,fdpk7m5,t1_fdpgfns,1578630893.0,He managed to fall on his butt today and we cheered and tried to let him know that was good. But the fall still scared him so he cried. We don’t react unless it’s a bad one. I said it seems like everyday and it’s not. I’m just a worry wart and when I think about it it’s not that constant. I love the times you make it just in time but man. Kids get themselves in silly situations so fast sometimes.
NewParents,fdpk1zu,t1_fdo0ttd,1578630765.0,Of course we use a pack n play. But he sits in the kitchen floor while we clean or crawls around the living room. We live in a terribly small apartment so there’s not even a lot to climb on. It’s not just that he will be standing and fall. He will be sitting there like he has for months and then just topple over. Or crawling and face planting. If he stands up I go to him. But kids are fast and I can’t be on top of him every second. He gets irritated and I have chronic health problems that make it that much harder. I can’t catch him every time. And honestly I hadn’t thought about keeping the foam flooring out all the time. That’s why I came here to ask.
NewParents,fdpjw3p,t1_fdoaq95,1578630632.0,I do what I can. If he’s about to do something I know he will get hurt doing I’ll tell him no and try to redirect his attention. It’s just funny because I’ll go to talk to him and he will get excited and start clapping making him fall backwards. Which in those situations I am hovering and catch him so he just gets spooked.
NewParents,fdpjmxm,t1_fdny44x,1578630428.0,He usually goes barefoot. But he likes to just face plant while crawling or fall back while sitting up. He always acts fine except a few tears. We don’t react until he does and if he’s not hurt then he gets up and keeps going. But sometimes it really makes you feel like crap.
NewParents,fdpj2wq,t1_fdnsip4,1578629981.0,That’s a great idea. I had a play pen made with it before but our place is small so it got put away quickly. But maybe if it’s flat. It’s just that he will just be crawling and then just face plant. I don’t get it.
NewParents,fdpixzv,t1_fdo4ii0,1578629874.0,I was just looking at that today. Just depends. He likes to change it up sometimes but I think it would help.
college,fc3rwld,t1_fc3peyo,1577397078.0,Yup! 5 of them are only 7 weeks so they aren’t all at once and they’re all online so I don’t have to worry about the stress of going to class!

NewParents,fbv3mn1,t3_eekshu,1577124875.0,My son is about the same age and I was just thinking about posting something very similar because my baby fever is through the roof. But I’m scared shitless to have another because my PPA is just getting worse. Nothing about my first pregnancy went how I wanted and I feel like I want a do over even though my son is literally the sweetest happiest baby I’ve ever seen.
