FATErpg,ff5cr65,t3_ermxb0,1579587525.0,"(Oh boy! Midnight horror riffing from an amateur with unresolved job, auto, and medical issues! Also a shortage of sleep!)

It's 11 PM and you're brushing your teeth. The lights are yellow. You open the door under the sink to get mouthwash. An impish thing flits out. It isn't doing anything but following you and making a shrill sound that could **maybe** be called laughter. Under fictional circumstances, a silly little fiend could be funny. It's not. It's here. It won't go away. It won't die. It doesn't appear to want anything in particular from you. It's just there, senseless and unstoppable. Your tinnitus is acting up again.

Maybe you have some kind of seal or spell in your office. You're into the occult, right? At least weird fantasy. Throw a Tolkien (dead, by the way) map at it. Check the bookshelf. Oh wait, there's a hand up there, just rooting around. Not attached to anything. Not trying to grab you, though it comes close. It's too dry. You should dust the tops of your shelves. Stop the damn hands. Not that they would listen to you.

It was the same way last night, and even before that, though you didn't really notice until recently. An uneventful day at work or whatever followed by whatever this is. No one addresses it. Nothing you try stops it. Your jaw aches. The imp thing carefully pierces the linoleum floor with a needle-tooth, leaving a small but permanent divot. You need to get out of here.

Now you're in a car, playing white noise from your phone to clear your head. The motor on the driver side window is broken; the trash bag you keep over the gap rustles in the wind, but at least it keeps the mist out. All the houses around you look the same, though the people coming out are different. One is listening to zen water sounds, played too loudly from their phone speaker. One is wearing earplugs, which he's coming to realize are useless, but he's trying anyway. One is just pacing and grimacing in pain.

Now all four of you are in the car. Maybe everything will be okay again if you just drive. Everywhere you look leads right back here, but you have to try *something*, right? What do you do?

[EDIT' On second thought, maybe I should just buy Don't Rest Your Head.]"
ApocalypseWorld,ff43n1p,t1_ff32b9j,1579554820.0,"1. If they're evading or trying to do something else rather than doing battle, Act Under Fire sounds about right. If they're fighting back, it's probably a battle move such as Seize By Force.

2. Your rulings may vary, but my group's Driver had freaky animals instead of cars and bikes, so you could probably treat a sufficiently large creature as a vehicle for vehicular combat purposes. Actually, come to think of it, MCs very rarely (if ever) roll PC moves. I'd recommend taking a look at the other driving moves and see if there's anything the players can do instead. Like how players Act Under Fire or Seize By Force when attacked, rather than having the threat roll for it.

3. I don't have the book on me, but if ambiguous it's up to you. Consult your MC moves if you're not sure.

4. I think that's just explaining how it's AP, not an extra effect."
