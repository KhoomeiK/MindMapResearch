I won't ever be able to provide ""facts"" that will live up to the expectation of the bias you mentioned in your comment. However, I can provide the perspectives of both sides of the argument in question, and we can only hope that education, competence, and pragmatism will lead us towards a beneficial mutual understanding.

Guess what? It won't. Because the average user of this sub is too stupid to think beyond buzz feed and fox news.

Animals are amazing creatures, whom exhibit psychological characteristics that can make humans appear to be barbarous and evil. Those who feel the need to demonstrate their anger or love of pit bulls in this thread, have truly lost the plot, and should probably not type anything at all. 

I wholeheartedly challenge the viewers of this thread to provide a compelling and unbiased, scientifically driven argument here. *I DARE you.*"

smokingcessation,fe2ppt1,t3_enl9dh,1578841566.0,"I don't think it would be a huge problem for you to to delay switching to the lower strength, as long as you are able to actively take steps toward preparing yourself for making the switch soon.

When I was quitting, I used nicotine lozenges. I stayed on the 4mg dose for about two weeks longer than I was supposed to, according to the package instructions. I never used it as an excuse to go back to smoking, though. Eventually I switched to the 2mg lozenge, and it really sucked for about a day. But I am VERY glad that I took the extra time to prepare myself mentally, because it allowed me to push the need to the back of my mind, allowing me to stay focused on the long term goal.

You can do this. It's not going to be easy, but nothing worth earning in life ever comes easy."
