LiveFromNewYork,feldzg9,t1_fel6sy1,1579219944.0,"Is that because of what I wrote or because you're looking for someone who mirrors you and think it strengthens you? 

Please hear me out: We shouldn't be inspired by those who ""represent"" us but by their works, achievements... ""First woman to climb Mt. Everest"" - I didn't think that they couldn't. ""First gay Asian castmember"" - he's funny and the fact that he's gay or Asian doesn't phase me. Is anyone saying ""Hendrix is the greatest"" because he's black, grew up in an impoverished family, is left-handed? No! - he's known for being innovative, technically skilled, extremely creative, equally good at writing songs.

 I apologize for not seeing the world in different shades but this idea of representation can easily hit hysterical levels. There hasn't ever been a male, cisgendered, heterosexual, Cossack-Polish-Irish engineer who I could aspire to. I'm waiting. Where is my representation? 

Can you understand how silly it sounds? I'm glad that there are people in this world to look up to. ""An intelligent man learns from his own mistakes; a wise man learns from the mistakes of others."" 

At the end of the day you should look at what people have done; not if they're of a different race, sexual orientation, differing belief... By categorizing every single person it destroys the unity that we all share - I'm not a male, cisgendered, heterosexual, Cossack-Polish-Irish engineer but someone who wants to laugh at the end of a hard day."

I had a housemate that would yell ""yeet"" when things were thrown - like anything into the bin. Had another who would say ""aww"" whenever anything was cute. Others have made observations that would connect them with things that were obviously associated with whatever they were watching at the moment. 

Sitcoms are easy to make because they are easily reproducible. Good sitcoms last a while because the acting and writing are good and original."

MadeMeSmile,fdpkfuy,t1_fdpavaz,1578631082.0,Which also means that if 1 person from a small country gives billions of dollars in aid or to charitable organizations then the entire country looks like it is being generous.
MadeMeSmile,fdpgvkg,t1_fdpghn4,1578628293.0,The stats only go up to 2016. America was #1 or 2 for 4 years. I generously allowed for that 1% decrease in the past two years.
etiquette,fdpg7ne,t1_fdpfu0g,1578627802.0,"I didn't mean to suggest that you would express hatred, just that negative emotions at that time and place should be avoided. 

A funeral isn't the place to be opinionated. I was in your shoes. It's a time and event to acknowledge the loss of someone you both love."
MadeMeSmile,fdpfwsp,t1_fdpep3z,1578627580.0,"I think most Americans would be cautious to give to charity if they didn't have power to give it to whichever charity they would like. 

It's due to being hesitant that a government would not spend it in the intended way. And, as also pointed out, we have a gigantic population. How could you please everyone without allowing the personal freedom to which organizations you wish to help. 


For example: I may give 20% of my earnings to Wounded Warriors (I don't but bear with me). Someone else gives their money to a cerebral palsy foundation. Should the government decide that my contribution isn't correct and should instead be given to a different charity? (Again, this is hypothetical... I would love to see many organizations receive funding to help out those people who are in need)."
MadeMeSmile,fdpdvl9,t1_fdpcg2n,1578626129.0,"How much of that goes to St. Vincent De Paul or different children's hospitals or the like associated with churches? Hell, YMCA's were associated with churches. I don't know. 

Would you include Congregational Harvard, Anglican William & Mary or Princeton, Baptist Brown, or Dutch Reformed Rutgers in this? 

That's the entire point - Americans donate to which organizations they would like instead of having the government tax and allocate those funds to whoever they choose.

* the vast majority of churches aren't spending their money on lavish jets or the like. I don't want this to turn into a religious discussion but the actions of the few are often mistaken for the deads of many."
MadeMeSmile,fdpcbd0,t1_fdpavh7,1578625047.0,"Isn't that a self-defeating statement: if a Swedish billionaire donates a years worth of income while the Swedish government taxes its citizens for charity, that's still far fewer Swedes contributing to helping others than what many Americans do. (Not an attack on Sweden by the way). It is because of smaller populations that some countries look more charitable. 

If the citizens of Pago Pago donated 10% of their income and the government gave 20% of its taxes to foreign aid it still wouldn't compare to the percentage of money given to foriegn aid or charitable donations that the US gives."
MadeMeSmile,fdpaiju,t1_fdp8y0v,1578623817.0,"And yet Americans give more to charitable foundations than most countries - it consistently ranks in the top 5 countries. 

Not to mention that the amount we dedicate to foreign aid is larger than the next three nations combined."
etiquette,fdoglsb,t3_emf1e1,1578604735.0,"My grandpa passed a little more than a year ago. We were extremely close - he thought of me and my brother as sons. Whereas I am deserving of the backlash I've had with some of my family, at those times even the most bitter dislike is likely calmed.

 I shook my Uncle and Aunt's hand because that was neither the time or place to cause controversy. My Aunt was grieving the loss of her dad and there's nothing I would do to make her feel worse. 

Be considerate and kind. They are going through a lot, just like you may. A funeral is never a place to express hatred but an event to honor someone you were close to."
