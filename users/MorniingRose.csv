depression,fcxoxhi,t1_fcxoabt,1578068060.0,"I almost never use mine because I start feeling depressed when I see other people out having fun with their friends and stuff, while i'm laying here alone while thinking about how I don't even have a single friend... when I do go on, it's usually just to post about a life event or to make sorts of cries for help like the ""friends out of stock"" post I mentioned earlier, even though i'm basically speaking to a blank room, x:

I've been thinking about cutting my visits with her in half and just giving up on therapy. As mentioned, i'm not an ideal client in the first place (or even close to being one, really) and my circumstances don't really facilitate change, and that includes even seeing other therapists. Very rural areas mean a lack of options, sadly."
depression,fcxn7g8,t1_fcxmn8i,1578066950.0,"Yeah, I would have rather not even gotten a response in that case... it upset me a bit. I don't even have any friends, though, really. I have a number of people (around 30 in total) I went to high school with, but with how inflated the friend counts most of them has, I was probably added just to give an extra number to their list.

I see both a therapist and psychiatrist... the meds do help, but I haven't really made any progress with my therapist over the last three years, though that's no fault of her own. It's more on me and the fact that the place I live at doesn't easily allow for me to do more with my life."
depression,fcxm71f,t1_fcxlkhc,1578066286.0,"Unlikely...

I even made a less obvious post about being lonely once (worded something to the extent: ""Where can I go to buy some friends? They're always sold out in every store that I go to, *thinking emote*"") and the only response I got was someone thinking they were being clever by linking to a box set for the TV series Friends."

YourBaroness,fcu32xt,t1_fctjcca,1577971075.0,"I loved Gold & Grey and think that it's a great record in its own right, and I think it's great that they looked to Yellow & Green for inspiration (heck, some of the songs even seem to lyrically correspond to it in some ways), but... the interludes are part of why it doesn't measure up as well for me. I like Sevens and Can Oscura, but otherwise, they don't really add anything to the album as a whole. The general pacing for the album could have been done better, too.  


Baroness is my favorite band, and Y & G will always be their holy grail in my eyes. Everything about it is was on point: songs, pacing, variety, feeling, and even just the general mixing & production. I don't (personally) have any complaints about it."
YourBaroness,fctir7b,t1_fctftrm,1577944684.0,"Even though i've seen so many people talk crap about Y&G, I couldn't agree more. To me, listening through both halves of the album together is what I would look to as the definition of what you could call a musical journey, and I love it for that.  


The individual songs stand very well on their own, of course, but the album will always have the most powerful effect for me through having the full listening experience."
RedDeadOnline,fctbin9,t3_eipk27,1577938143.0,"Wow, this rifle legit looks pretty cool. I'd definitely get one for my character and probably always keep it equipped, no matter how good or bad it was."
psychology,fcsuxfh,t3_eihul9,1577925742.0,"Makes sense to me. If you have a higher degree of self-control, you're likely going to be able to put greater effort into things such as obtaining a dream job rather than just giving in and settling for something else, for example."
depression,fcsuqgy,t3_eim9l0,1577925601.0,"I could have, and it's a shame that I didn't. I had a very severe allergic reaction to something (which i've never encountered again, for some odd reason) and nearly died from it."

Such as is."
depression,fcoot2w,t3_ei5th0,1577837621.0,"My year consisted of me staying in my house like a pathetic loser while making trips to my therapist/psychiatrist once a month that ultimately didn't help.

It's how things were meant to be, I suppose."

1. My family. My mom tells me that she'd die of grief if I did something to myself, and I can believe that... and if she and I both were gone, my father, sister and grandparents probably wouldn't last a lot longer, either. I would potentially be taking the majority of my family with me, and I don't feel that my release from pain is enough to chance dragging them down as well.  
2. Consequences in the afterlife.  


Other than that, I literally have no reason for living. Life brings me next to no joy, and I spend every day miserable... food is my only pleasure, and that's not something I can rely on, either."

I have no intentions of killing myself (though I wish that it was a viable option), but I wouldn't be upset it death came for me during the year."
SuicideWatch,fcnvcsv,t3_ei137q,1577819169.0,"Whoever says that doesn't know what they're talking about, frankly, or just doesn't want to take the time to care for you. I've been overtly depressed since I was 14, and I just recently turned 25."

Still, Happy New Years (Eve) to you as well. I hope that your year will be fruitful."

Here's to another lonely new year, I suppose. #nofriends"
ForeverAlone,fcnqwk1,t3_ei2l1n,1577816745.0,"I agree wholeheartedly.   


Some people will never make friends or find any real kind of social success, and when these stories feel especially forced or condescending, it can be pretty frustrating."
RedDeadOnline,fc1gpss,t3_efn2r7,1577318252.0,"Yeah, i'm pretty disappointed, too. I wanted free stuff rather than a bunch of ""half off"" coupons... even a few gold bars would have made me happy."
