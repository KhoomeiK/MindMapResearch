unpopularopinion,fdba6az,t1_fdb9ghc,1578255395.0,Then why do signs say to not leave kids unattended in the arcade? Encouraging parents to drink hard liquor while supervising their minors would be considered child endangerment 😂
unpopularopinion,fda5c1k,t1_fda4kyc,1578241883.0,I didn’t say ALL but it does happen. Often actually. And you being 13 need to think of the behavior you see at school as an example of that.
unpopularopinion,fda4nrb,t1_fd87wcb,1578241606.0,"Uh no, you’re wrong about all of that. An establishment can’t encourage parents to drink at a bar while their kids play in another area unsupervised... it would be so great so great to have parents knocking back shots of tequila while responsible for their kids. That’s not a family activity. That’s why Chuck E. Cheese has beer and wine only"

unpopularopinion,fd7tpjb,t1_fd7r7cu,1578209951.0,"It’s not as equal, that’s my whole point. D&b’s is geared more for adults than smaller kids. Chuck E. Cheese is geared more toward families. There is nothing parents can/need to do with their kids at d&b’s that they can’t do at Chuck E. Cheese because if their kids are with them, it’s family night which calls for family activities. Chuck E. Cheese is perfect for that. Adults can just chill and be adults at Dave and Busters. They can order food and drinks, play games, watch sports games, host dinner parties.. and it would be nice to have that adult atmosphere without little kids running around with sticky hands. Have family night at Chuck E. Cheese bc family night is going to look the same regardless of which place they go, but adults can’t have an adult game night at Chuck E. Cheese."

unpopularopinion,fd7q1i7,t1_fd7pqk6,1578208306.0,"My op wasn’t about the bar either, that’s a side point. My main point is that it should be for adults and kids should stick with Chuck E. Cheese"

abusiverelationships,fd704ql,t3_ek7qs5,1578197854.0,"You have to be ready to leave, and I’m sure you know this, but it’s not going to get better. It’s going to get worse. And you don’t want to be there when he has to face consequences for his actions. For example if he hit and hurt my loved one in the car drunk diving I would make damn sure he was punished to the FULL extent of the law. He is not happy either and he won’t get help if you stay. It’s basically enabling him to continue down this path. So yes, it’s completely understandable that you are at a place that you can’t do it anymore. You’re not supposed to and shouldn’t have to. You deserve better and so does everyone else. If you’re at that place where you’re ready to leave, make a plan (secretly but with help)."

AskReddit,fd0pk6t,t3_ejt7u4,1578122037.0,"I feel like if they want to be accepted as normal they should stop acting abnormal like “I’m different accept me.” I’m not saying that all lgbt people act out but a lot that I’m around do. Drawing attention to themselves by humping one another in public (an act of social deviance) in pride parades. Integrating in society and just BEING is the best way to become accepted in my opinion. “I’m here I’m queer” is annoying tbh, like just shut up and be a human how about? Just live. That’s how things are normalized. People are going to disagree with other people’s lifestyles regardless, that’s life, get over it. You have free will to live however you want, I mean choose wisely, but just shut up I feel like I’m being force fed. 

I love all people even people I disagree with, but it’s gotten soooooo annoying hearing about it all the time. Disagreement doesn’t equal hate. I’m not God, that’s who people should consult regarding their lives."
