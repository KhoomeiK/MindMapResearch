Do you have your work online anywhere?"

First. Premiere. You missed an 'e', Dr. Knowledge. And don't give me that mobile shit, I'm on mobile.

Second. Clearly not. You aren't noticing the tell-tale hazing and pixelation inside or around the ""hole"". Or when his arms clip thru the snow and dont leave an imprint or move any snow. 

Not to mention the fact that snow doesn't behave the way it does in the video.

Ever jumped into snow? It moves around you. And rarely, if ever, does it create a perfect circle when struck by something hardly circular. The edges near the impact don't move. Dude just opened a pit to hell, why ain't more of it sliding in? Or, alternatively, how did 5 feet of snow collect around an *open* hole that size?

There's like 3 other elements I could point to, like how there are a *million* of videos like this one floating around or how almost every fake like this takes advantage of the slightly lower quality we expect from shaky phone footage to hide layer masks.


Ooh here's a good one! Why was camera man on the roof? If dude is on roof, he gonna jump too, looks like fun. Why not have dude 3 we see in the top left film it? If they don't know he's gonna fall through and they're filming for kicks, it makes sense. Way less risk for camera guy's phone if/when he leaps/slips off...

Or could it be that they planned this angle, cuz they're clever, knowing this'll look more convincing and interesting once they do some work on it?

This was clearly made in post."
