childfree,ff1fe8d,t1_ff1a9v7,1579478404.0,"I feel I’ve always been childfree. Even as a child I was scared of barbies and baby dolls thinking a demon spirit was in them (lol). The church I went to wasn’t always so zealot and that the previous priest was then nicest man ever. We did a lot of community involvement projects with the homeless and LGBTQ community. That changed around 2008 I think when a new priest was like the head priest and this guy was super zealous. This guy would preach about women obeying their husbands and even at a young age I rather be a nun than submit to some guy. 

And ya that classmate scared me. He started as a general classmate friend then began to try to ask about my relationship and it was none of his damn business. He would try to guilt me about stuff and I told him I have a license, but it’s only a drivers license. This dude finally lost it when I mentioned I’m childfree and so I my partner. I’m thankful I never have to see him again since I graduated. I hope he has stopped obsessing over me and found someone else to bother. 

I feel we are in the last fight for our planet’s life honestly. When I saw snow for the first time in south Texas 3 years ago I just had this gut feeling this was so wrong. I went 18 years of my life without seeing snow until that one day. 

Racist people like to hang out with me or know me because it makes them feel cultured. They will say it’s so good I don’t speak Spanish like “those” Mexicans. Technically most Hispanics are considered racially white, but we sure as hell aren’t treated that way. My grandfather went to fight in WW2 and was taken POW in France. When he came back from that hell he was told by his country to sit at the back of the bus. My uncle was taken lottery in Vietnam and lost a leg for a country that honestly treats our people like dirt nowadays. Racist people weren’t openly racist before, but now they don’t even try to hide it. In the 1920’s is when all the European cultures became one white race against like Italians and Eastern Europeans. 

At least I remember my roots. I am grateful for the privilege I have and the ability to get an education. We hired some people to cut our tree and it was a group of Mexican laborers. One of those workers couldn’t have been older than 14 and a woman was doing such backbreaking labor lifting those logs. Even though they don’t connect to me I still acknlowdge I was just born on this side of the border.  It’s like eastern Germans and western Germans. 

I think it’s good you vote and continue to fight in your way. As long as we don’t give up there is hope."
childfree,ff0z16q,t1_feyj3n9,1579473691.0,"It depends where in the US, but where I’m at it is super religious. The painful thing is I felt betrayed by my religion in that I truly believed as a child. I even resigned myself to maybe committing to life as a nun so I would not have children or marry or sadly not know the joys of the flesh. It was so empowering to go to university and get more perspective on life.

My partner said he doesn’t want me getting my hopes up falsely in that he isn’t into marrying anyone. We can continue to still be friends and he is open for me seeing other people while still being with him. Honestly though there are a lot of creeps. I was harassed by a guy in my class that I used to be friends with wanting to date me and when I told him no he said “your boyfriend doesn’t respect you enough to marry you like I would”. I ran so fast from that guy and told him to leave me the hell alone and never come near me again. Honestly I’m kinda chill for the moment to grieve a future of my partner and I never closing the long distance gap, but I’m chill with not getting married anytime the hell soon. At the very least his clarity in my usual batshit crazy world is welcomed. 

It amazes that we live in a time where knowledge is at the grasp of our fingertips and people can be so fucking uneducated. The rise is the right movement needs to stop in that they’re hurting the world and people. Diseases that were once eradicated are making a come back and killing thousands in this new age of misinformation. Something has to change.

Oh I know right? Down here it is so common for white nationalist to fly around the confederate flag. When I volunteered at a retirement community the residents mentioned the “war of northern aggression” and they meant the civil war. The white nationalist love Robert E Lee and preach of their heritage. Sounds like a bunch of cry babies mad they lost the war. People often make sly remarks of where I’m “really” from when my family can be traced back four generations in this country. I was the only Hispanic on my schools speech team and got so much micro aggression “where is a good place to vacation in Mexico since you’re from there”. Bitch, I’ve never been to Mexico in my entire life. I just told them Taijauana is lovely. Or the kids in my class asking me to translate their Spanish homework when I don’t even fucking speak Spanish. I picked up rudimentary German bettter from my partner than I did Spanish in school. 

Honestly I want people in the majority to treat me with respect as they would anyone else. I was invited to a friends house and her family bought Taco Bell to make me feel “more comfortable” when I eat other food too. I take comfort in knowing my friend was mortified and we got frozen yogurt afterwards, but I could give Ted talks on how I just want to be treated with some goddamn respect. Thank you for your compassion, but the way to make real change is to change the system. Vote in ways that help us. Also what did you mean by actors? What are ways you encounter bullshit and react to it?"
childfree,feycaoe,t1_fexynya,1579443662.0,"I can definitely relate to the whole religion is law thing. My partner is always so surprised how many damn churches there are where I live. Easily like 20+ churches in a 10 mile radius. I was raised in the Catholic Church and the church I go to would have the communion and confirmation students participate to protest the local planned parenthood. I still remember them telling us is cheery voices, “we are going to make protest posters now get your markers and glitter out”. I left the church at 18 when I was diagnosed with PCOS and needed birth control to regulate my hormones, but the priest said I was sinning and I should be ashamed. That he would “pray” for me. 

I am aware that there is more statistical evidence for happiness in couples that marry older. I never saw myself getting married until my 30’s, and that is why it’s so ridiculous my partner and I having this discussion now. I like what we have, but I’m not sure anymore. 

Something I can admire about GER is the reparations they have made since WW2. In our history we are force fed that white colonists and Native Americans kinda got along while glossing over the intentional ethnical cleansing of a group. I actually got in trouble when I pointed out Texas was essentially blackmailed from Mexico by white settlers and told “we won Texas fair and square from those Mexicans” from an AP history teacher. There is so much micro aggression and micro racism that still exists today, and refusing to acknowledge all the terrible shit this country has done is disappointing. What they are essentially doing to my people at the border and ripping children from mothers and fathers should be a crime against humanity. 

People are racist to people who look like me because they refuse to acknowledge our humanity as human beings deserving of respect and love. That is the only way they can rationalize treating us so poorly. Now, that isn’t everyone, but I have noticed it getting worse since 2016. We do despair, but we have learned to let it go or we would be angry every goddamn day. I am lucky that there is a Hispanic community near me so I can find some community. 

The downside about Austin is that yes it is liberal, but the surrounding areas are not. The only way to make a true change is to not fix one individual, but to change the system. Voting 2020 is the most important thing I can do for my country this year. I have considered moving up north, but I don’t do well with the cold. Maybe for a potential PhD I could move and get some life experience.

As a member of a majority part of your population an important thing you can do is stand with the minorities. Remember our humanity and that people are just people at the end of the day."

It’s also a hard bill to fit of what I want in a partner where I live. I want a skinny lean white guy that is super sweet and caring. He would have to share the same interest in being childfree, Democrat, prochoice, educated, atheist/nonreligious, feminist, nonsexist, non racist, and progressive. I never saw myself changing my name if I were to get married or quit my career goals so a husband would have to be okay with that too. In my neck of the woods there are Trump supporters and conservatives. My state voted for Trump. 

I actually get accosted by strangers and told “I bet she doesn’t even speak English damn illegals” because of the way I look. Things have gotten so bad since 2016 and I’m treated like a damn near second class citizen at times for being Mexican-American. My partner doesn’t treat me like that when I’ve felt that discrimination my entire life. I still remember being told by complete strangers, “you’re pretty for a Mexican” or “your English is good”. He’s such a caring and sweet individual to not hold who I am against me like so many people here do. The only thing people expect of me is to be a teen mom or they want me to go away. My partner said he does respect me and love me, but people shouldn’t treat me badly to begin with. I feel academia is the only place I can turn to now because for the most part with higher education means more acceptance. He still supports me, and I think I will keep him as a friend. At least for his perspective because where I live can be miserable at times. I may have to move to a more liberal part of Texas or even out of the state.

I told him always wanted to be in a relationship where I could be with someone. He said he can’t handle a marriage now until he gets his life together and I respected that.

How do you handle dating? Asking someone with a little more life experience than me (21f). 


I’m currently dating long distance because my partner and I can’t handle a full on relationship. My dream is to work post-secondary education as a professor and it will take me years to get that. He was working on a second degree before realizing he does not want to spend the rest of his life doing something that would not make him happy. He is now pursuing apprenticeships to see what career he will find enjoyment out of, but that will be a few years long. 

So many of my friends frown on our relationship because to isn’t normal, and I shit you not, “wouldn’t you rather be a wife than a professor.” 

I even had a male classmate tell me, “that seems very ambitious for someone like you. Did your boyfriend approve you getting a master’s degree.” 

My partner was so shocked someone even thought like that. If I were to conform to the stereotypical life script of a woman living in the southern US then my dreams would never come true.

Even as a child I wanted to be a nun. At a young age I convinced myself I would never know the joys of the flesh and commit to Jesus to avoid marriage and children. Then I read, “The Awakening” in high school. I admired that a woman realized she could make life what she wants it, but sadly she realized it too late. It felt like I just discovered multiple paths of life and I didn’t have to take the one laid out before me by society. 

My current partner is amazing, but we are in a LDR. He’s the most stable relationship I’ve ever had and he respects me. We have fun and laugh and are silly with each other. He supports me getting a masters degree and a male classmate of mine said, “your boyfriend approves of you getting a master’s degree? Did you get his permission?”

One professor gave us interview questions we had to pitch on the spot. Example, “if you could be any animal what would it be” or “what would your dream company be to work at”. It helped prepare us for interviews because certain jobs fields will ask certain questions (sales tends to ask someone to sell them a pen). 

Then there were question of the day questions that varied from recent events in the world, personal hobby, and such... As a commuter student I always wished the professor asked who commuted and from what area. The commuter students would form our own group often and work together online. 

Another professor didn’t have us do introductions, but we wrote our name, contact information, and something we wanted them to know on a notecard. I think that’s works better for people that have difficulty talking in public. Good luck tomorrow!"

Sadly, at your age you would need parents consent or a judges approval in certain states for an abortion. There are multiple places that can mail abortion pills to you if you are in a state without abortion services. 


Edit: Check out the fencesitters subreddit for people that are on either side of the fence on kids. Be warned of a lot of people going to talk to you about a sky fairy and how you will regret an abortion. A lot of those “regret statistics” are for women that already had children and wanted more. Not for childfree women. 


Now I’m going to level with you. My classmate got pregnant at 15 and her boyfriend wanted her to keep it because it was his child. She was stared at every single day at school. Teachers degraded her for her bad choices in front of the class and people began to ignore her. Her boyfriend cheated on her and it was too late to abort. During birth she suffered a tear from her vagina to her anus causing a lot of painful problems. Nurses talked down to her and mentioned Christian family values a lot (I’m in the southern US). She was bullied to be homeschooled because she didn’t fit the schools ethic codes of being a single mother. She was shamed for not breastfeeding and had little support. Her boyfriend went to college and she stayed at her parents house raising a kid alone. I helped her with gifts of baby clothes and formula because I felt so horrid with how everyone was treating her.

We are both 21 and many of our peers are pursuing trade school, college, military, and/or working. My classmate got her GED and now works at a Christian daycare part time while receiving welfare. 

I can give you another story of a woman I met in university. She was 27 years old and going back to school for her undergrad. She got pregnant at 18 by a guy that was 24 and again shortly after. She got help to go to school, but one day she completely had a break down. She found her husband with another woman’s nudes on his phone. She cried to a bunch of 18-20’s something’s about how she wished she never met him. She wished she listened to her parents because they were going to help her through university, but she felt special because of his affection to her. Instead she has 2 kids that she loves, but wished had a decent father and wished she could give them a better life. She couldn’t afford daycare because it is the cost of a mortgage. It was sad seeing the regret of someone. Just be aware if you do plan to keep the child the consequences. Everything we do has consequences, good and bad."

I’m fortunate to have no debt from my undergrad and am 21 at the moment. For my graduate degree that’s a difference story. 

I qualified for an unsubsidized loan of $10,500. The interest rate is 6.08%. My tuition this semester for 2 classes is $3100 not including books. My masters degree is 12 classes at 3 credit hours each. 

I was told I can accept the full amount then I request it to be lowered, but my family thinks I should take the full amount then work. Whatever I make I save and contribute to a bill or two around the house. 

I live at home rent free and have a car to drive courtesy of my parents at no fee. The only expenses I have are tuition/books and a phone bill (plus contacts for the year). The goal would be to work part time 15-25 hours a week then full time during the summer. 

This would be the first time taking out a loan and it scares me. My partner thinks I should take out $2000 of the loan this semester and work to pay for tuition. He said that in the capitalist society of the US that it would be beneficial to have zero lone, but he is from Germany.

My friend said I can take a loan from a bank for a loan interest rate. Her step-dad co-signed for her and her interest rate is 3.xx%. 

My parents suggest I take the loan and put half of what is left over in a credit union and the other half in my personal savings.
