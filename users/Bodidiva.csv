college,fek2woy,t3_epjhi2,1579191466.0,"Try taking a compassionate approach instead of getting ""mean"" about it. Most likely the reason he doesn't take care of himself is low self esteem and lack of feeling any value of himself. You haven't said anything about his behavior aside from the laundry and showering but even if he seems cocky or arrogant, this is likely just a defense. It sounds very frustrating to deal with honestly. 

I'm a very head on approach sort of person so I'd be asking questions like : *Why don't you care enough about yourself to care for yourself in the most basic ways? Do you realize others will treat you no better than you treat yourself?* If you wanna get extra about it, ask him what he would do *if he saw a very good friend going on like this? Wouldn't he want to help them?* 

I don't think being mean about it will solve anything. He doesn't care to do things for you, he's got to care to do things for himself. And if he is suffering a very low self esteem issues being mean about it will only make it worse. He would benefit from counseling. 

Give him a small place to start. ""How about you shower today, and change your sheets?"" If you're feeling extra compassionate help him with the sheets and laundry."

* Learn your subject and your speech well. Confidence comes from knowing what you're talking about.
* Write your speech as close to the way you would naturally speak vs how you write, there is a difference.
* Rehearse your speech until you know it well enough not to have to read word for word off the paper.
* If there is a time limit, end about 10 seconds early. Ending ""on time"" generally means you've gone over. (Unless your professor says it must be ""at least"" 3 mins or whatever.)
* Realize that no one is judging you as harshly as you may believe, - they are all in their heads worried about themselves. Like you, they kinda just want it over. 
* Bring water to the podium if possible. Dry spots in your throat attack without warning. 
* Take your time getting to the podium, mic or wherever you are presenting, do not rush. Once there, position your paper, water etc. If there is a mic, adjust it so you can stand naturally. Do not look at or acknowledge the audience until your items are positioned and you are ready to start speaking. Then, greet them and begin. 

Good luck to you.
