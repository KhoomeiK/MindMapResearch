It's been alleged because they have SS logos tattooed on their arms that they've poorly covered up and at least one of them has worn a shirt with the SS logo on it on a show. The logo is taken from one of Hitler's military police forces and has been cooped by 1%er groups. I feel like the only reason somebody would get an SS tattoo is because they want a Nazi tattoo but are too afraid to go full on swastika."
