aww,fezmu04,t3_eqwj0w,1579459123.0,"Please don't buy dogs from petstores. I know it can feel like you are ""saving"" or ""rescuing"" them. But every dog you buy opens up a space for a new one to be sold. And these dogs come from puppy mills where there are treated terribly. Female dogs are typically kept in cages or pens and bred constantly without medical attention. Then they have their puppies taken away too young. Once a female gets too old or sick she is put down or given to an spca where she is usually put down or even if adopted usually has a lot of issues (often has never even seen grass).

A petstore will never kill unsold puppies. If no one bought them they'd go to a humane society or spca and almost certainly be adopted (young dogs or puppies are in high demand). Then, if the store couldn't sell dogs they'd stop which would stop the puppy mill from profiting and cause them to stop breeding.

Even if you want a puppy of a specific breed, you can find responsible breeders to buy from who actually care about their dogs.

This comment is intended to educate those who don't know about this issue: please google puppy mills for more information."

Hat guy comes up to Limmy asks him if he's from around there. Limmy says he's not. Hat guy asks if he had a laptop in his bag. Limmy says he does but he doesn't think much of it, since his phone can do most of what it does. Hat guy says he'd love a laptop. Pulls a knife. Limmy says he can offer something more valuable: his time. Hat guy says he just wants the phone and laptop. Limmy starts explain how in order to get in this situation hat guy must have been hurt by something. Says he can give him the phone and laptop but if the guy shares his pain he might actually be able to help him. Hat guy starts recounting a story of 5 years ago when he was helping his stepdad move a couch and they took a rest.

Fitness,fddxv4c,t1_fddcu1g,1578326619.0,"I've noticed that men who lift seriously typically aren't interested in being more attractive to women, but are more interested in getting more attractive to other men (not in a gay way). For instance most women would list a leaner, cut physique, such as Brad Pitt in fight club, or Ryan Reynolds, as their ideal. However most serious lifters are trying to get as big as possible. Which other men admire. I think that us women need to do more of this and also workout to make ourselves happy with our bodies, as opposed to trying to be desirable to men.

Just my 2 cents."
