For example, ever wonder why the British Queen has no king but a prince as a husband? While if she was a king then the wife becomes a queen.

The nordic countries have laws that allow the first born to take the throne. But most royal families still have the male only succession laws. Japan is one of them, their female royals get thrown out of the royal family if they don't marry another royal. So they either die as virgins or are screwed unless they sign up for incest."

IdiotsInCars,ffdvc10,t1_ffc7bu6,1579829837.0,"Should probably shed some light on this as many people probably don't know how it is to drive in really snowy conditions and how it actually is in these countries.

First let's talk about speed. You go below the normal speed limit, but sometimes it doesn't matter, you'll slide no matter how slow you go.

To combat this we use 2 methods. First is putting down salt on the roads. The second is putting tires with spikes on our cars.

From what I can see this is partially the drivers fault for being kinda closeish, but not really. Here is the big kicker, buses usually don't change their tires in these countries. If heavy snowfall occurs, and it's night looking at this video, then nothing the driver does will matter. Those heavy vehicles have absolutely no traction and will spin out no matter how far they are from the car in front. There is less cars on the road during the evening to clear the road passively and fewer plow trucks are out as well. 

My whole city usually gets completely paralyzed after a good snowfall. Not NYC paralyzed, I'm talking buses spun out on the road cause of 4 feet of snow being pressed into compact slide material. 

This is a normal occurrence and the bus driver had very little control over this. The driver in the car in front should have accounted for the big bus not being able to stop. He should have continued onward. This is a super important lesson they teach in drivers school in these northern countries. Drivers school that is way harder any US citizen ever has to take."

Scandinavia is legit only Sweden, Norway and Denmark. English speakers often misuse the word to mean all the Nordic countries, this is a misconception.

If you talk about the Nordic countries, then Finland is a part of it, but their language group is not part of the Norse group. The Norse group is Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Faeroe Islands and Iceland.

worldnews,fejbdm3,t1_fejakdi,1579165458.0,"I think you misunderstand who did what here. 

He is talking about the male usb-c head in the dock. That is the specially designed one, not the male plug on the actual power cord or the female connector in the system itself, that one doesn't let normal usb-c connectors to just slide out.

The 3rd party dock stations obviously don't want you to pull the entire dock up with the system when trying to pull it out. So the 3rd parties tried to make their own non-proprietary USB-C connector to put into their Switch docks. Nintendo made one that works and everyone tried to copy it, badly.

He's saying that the smaller size makes it harder to produce one without faults. And that the 3rd parties went cheap on it and f'd up the pins inside or they went cheap on the PD chip.

That is just the 3rd parties fault for trying to make a better dock than Nintendo for cheaper. My guess is that that plug is the reason for the stupid high price on the simple dock.

In either case the bricking is caused by the fried chip from either of the two malfunctioning.

Edit: Yes the source can be questioned, but then I don't know who would know more about the technical problems than the person who is actively researching it and dealing with them.

Edit 2: The reason the switch dock has that big front is probably directly connected to the special plug head. Since it's smaller in size it has more flack. This has a potential of braking the thin plastic in the middle of the female connector in the switch. So to keep it steady and fixed in place they added a big physical safety, the big plastic front part of the dock, this is a system that many kids might use after all. And I looked at the Nyko dock, it has no such safety, it's just a plastic brick with a plug sticking out from it, any unfortunate wiggle and your system is toast. So say what you will about the official dock, there is a reason to why it looks and is the way it is."

Cause a tonal difference is very distinct. It could be it's own letter, which it is in Chinese, it can be expressed in the alphabet or a different grammar rule decides the tone/pitch.

And they don't know the meaning of the word ""socialist"" other than it means bad.

These two combined makes it impossible to sell America on anything when you mention a European country. Cause they will buy whatever Fox and the GOP tells them to believe about those countries. 

Sweden and Germany are apparently hell holes where people rape each other in the streets. 

UK is filled with poor people from the east stealing their jobs.

And France is failing cause protests exist.

You can spin anything to fit your narrative. Just like how the US is framed as weapon loving, oligarchical warmongers in Europe. 

If you only look at it from one angle (tv), through a hole (tv station) then it's true.

todayilearned,fdq4904,t1_fdq3l9k,1578654107.0,"Yeah you're right about it probably being subjectively easier, if you compare the 2 from the viewpoint of someone who speaks nothing or just a western language. If you on the other hand let a Japanese or Korean decide, then they might think Chinese is easier than English.

Also the funny thing about the R sound in Japanese is that it's more of a R/L sound. It sits right between our definitions. So they actually have a hard time to differentiate both. Try asking a Japanese who ain't a language pro which one is ""Light"" and which is ""Right"".

Edit: Koreans for example, have it as easy to pick up Japanese as Scandinavians have with English, for speaking at least. Cause they have such similar grammar. While the Chinese pick up the Japanese signs really fast."

Take it from the guy who had to sit in front of 15 Chinese students, on the foreign language teacher's request, as they all stared at his throat in order to try to discern the difference between a K and a G. I don't even know if you can see a difference on the throat, but they asked so I let them watch."

There aren't a lot of countries which do that. Their tv and movies are 80% English ones.

So it feels really official. But for the sake of nationalism they don't want to accept English as an official language. So somehow, through almost identical grammar and a lot of similar words, they are the best non inner circle speakers in the world."

The boat was seized, and the let go. No one got killed. I see a few minor problems nothing to start a war over or killing top leaders.

Graffiti and burned cars at an embassy, still I see nothing to kill a top official over. I would expect an apology from them and reparations. But I don't see how killing their top official is anywhere warranted. 

Imagine if the US stormed their embassy in the US and sprayed paint on it. And then they responded by drone striking VP Pence. Bit drastic isn't it?!"

To me that signals that they were relying on the US a lot. 

Edit: I also don't see anyone jumping at the prospect of helping South Korea or Japan. Yeah Europe ain't the cause for their current situation, but they aren't exactly jumping with joy over the US stepping back and them taking that place and gaining any benefits from it at the cost of their soldiers. So yeah, I feel the work of acting like the world police is a bit of a dirty business. Hope that cleared up what I meant.
Also the fact that we have a bunch of US missiles in Europe. Yeah, we rely on the US doing the dirty work. We're not even managing our own defense, let alone anyone elses"
