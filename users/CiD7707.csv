AskReddit,fepe956,t1_fep6hca,1579318341.0,"If you are going to go all in on a military career, if that is truly what you want, ask yourself what you actually want to do. What do you want to experience? Do you want to train day in and day out, ruck marching for hours, fast roping out of Blackhawks, putting rounds down range? You'll do that in the rangers. Then ask yourself if you want to lead. If you want to lead, look into being an officer rather than a grunt. Look at what that route will require. 

Next thing. Why Rangers? Why not be a chopper pilot? Why not work on a sub and be a nuclear tech? Explore your options.

As for family, live your best life. Seriously, they dont get to dictate your future. Make informed decisions and weigh your options. 

Next, if college is a goal or destination, plan for it. But remember it only gets harder the longer you are away from academics. 

And yes, it's a lot if higher ups making you do shit they don't want to do, but its also a lot of shit that needs to get done. Yes, the gun trucks need to get PMCS'd. Yes, the pro masks need to be 2404'd. Dont let my experience completely color your perception. Your mileage may vary.

Lastly, dont believe a word your recruiter says."
