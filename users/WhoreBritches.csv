Edit: Aaaand you deleted it. I really do wish you the best and I hope you'll listen to the people telling you to leave this POS. Good luck."
relationship_advice,fel6wgf,t3_epppcj,1579215352.0,"For me, the intent alone is cheating. He knowingly put himself in a situation with alcohol, alone with another woman. That's crossing the line in any monogamous relationship."

The more serious you get, the more evident this will become. Be expected to convert and live your life in accordance to what he believes in. Is that something you can handle?"

Rather, using weed as a bandaid isn't good for you if you're not getting to the root of the issue and attempting to live a productive life. When you're in a bad place, it only exacerbates the problem."

AskReddit,fee16ji,t3_eol16q,1579024244.0,"I love them both. I have two cats, but I probably won't want a dog for many years to come, if at all. Cats are much lower maintenance by comparison. It's not a big deal if we leave them home for a weekend away. Dogs on the other hand need to be taken out and exercised consistently. They're basically children. Cats essentially take care of themselves if you leave everything out for them, and you still get snuggles at the end of the day."

And he turned it around on me and made me the bad guy because ""I didn't understand"". I had zero respect for myself and as it turned out, he was indeed a serial cheater, and still is to this day based on what I hear. I do know that he's on his fourth baby mama and one of those girls he knocked up while we were still together. 

Not saying they're the exact same, but... Yeah. I wouldn't fuck with that again."
