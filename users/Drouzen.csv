In what ways do you feel the democracy of the US is being encroached upon?

I am going to go out on a limb here and assume you are referring to policies set by the conservative right.
A notion I find quite ironic when the poitical system of the country is compared to that of a novel such as 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.

While any government system should be kept in check, whether liberal or conservative in their beliefs or ideas, the divisive and collectivist identity politics, amendments imposing free speech and language, and the heavy-handed and over-reaching impossible drive for 'absolute equality' currently being pushed by the left, is a far more insidious blight on democracy, and one that draws a much more frighteningly close parallel to George Orwell's tale."

Kids make rash decisions based on whims and trends all the time, if they are really serious about being transgender, surely they can wait till they are a few years older and able to be 100% positive they want to go through with it.

A man in Canada was up on charges of 'an act of violence' because he did not allow his young son to undergo sexual reassignment. What a disgusting way to treat a father who only wanted his son to wait until he was old enough to be sure about such a decision. 
The government should really keep its fucking nose out of this stuff, it's horrible.

According to a number of studies most kids cease to feel transgender when they get older, so where do we draw the line?

We tend to not allow kids to get tattoos, smoke, drink, go to war, own a firearm, receive a drivers license until they are mature enough to engage in such endeavors, so why is it okay for them to alter their bodies chemically or surgically?"
