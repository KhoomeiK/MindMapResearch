japanpics,ff7i3h1,t1_ff76v1e,1579650066.0,"That reminds me of a story - on our way back from Japan, we bought up 24 different types of Kit Kats to bring home. We decided we'd throw a small party for our friends and we'd all taste a Kit Kat and grade them on a score sheet we drew up. We saved the Wasabi ones for last, because we figured that would be the grossest/nastiest. Turned out, the Wasabi ones do not have the spice/kick that you would expect; they were actually quite sweet, and turned out to be the highest scored Kit Kat flavor. It was everyone's favorite, and I wish I had bought more."

residentevil,fej2fwj,t1_feiwk5w,1579154409.0,"Man, I keep hearing this opinion on this subreddit, and I find it interesting. The sewers are probably the least interesting part of the game but I still loved it all, including the new design for the lab. Admittedly, I’m a huge fan, so I’m super biased and probably would have loved whatever they slapped together.

I’d like to add, however, that I thought the beginning of RE7 was brilliant, but the back half was uninspired."

bindingofisaac,fdfyh18,t3_el4j7r,1578373769.0,"Keeper requires a totally different play style and takes some practice for sure. The best advice I read was to bomb groups of pots on the first or second basement level to try to get the swallowed penny. Runs are much easier with it. If you don’t get it before the caves, reset.

Try to defeat Isaac with Keeper ASAP so you can start with the Wooden Nickel on subsequent runs. Car Battery and other battery-related shop items are great for the Wooden Nickel. Use the Wooden Nickel when you first enter a room so you have emergency health on the floor if needed.

Also the HP-up from a Strength card is permanent, so you can use the Strength card after a one-heart devil deal (or even immediately after a two heart devil-deal, although then you’re stuck with just one HP).

But yes, fuck Keeper."
