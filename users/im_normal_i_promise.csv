Normally pets are domesticated making it difficult for them to survive in the wild. 

It really depends on location as to where they're ""native to the outdoors"" too. I've seen a husky in Cambodia, that dog was bred (by humans) to live in colder climate and I wouldn't put a coat on a husky to go outside during the winter. Where I live it can get to -60Â° f with the wind chill so one can only imagine how cold the concrete it. IMO it would be cruel to make them walk on that. Also, one of our dog's paws crack open when they get too cold, even though his breed is suited for colder climates, the vet (animal doctor) recommend booties."

We have to put booties and coats on our dogs so they can go outside in the winter.

We also have a thunder jacket for one of the dogs.
