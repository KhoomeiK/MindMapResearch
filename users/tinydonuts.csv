Yes it is expensive and not very cost effective for you to purchase and fix it yourself. But the point of this conversation is the right to repair and having the ability to do so.

Part of the right to repair has to include affordability. I think we could all agree if the tool cost a million dollars, that doesn't qualify for right to repair, no?

>That scan tool I own can reflash a PCM and yes those software updates have to be purchased from the manufacturer as well. Unless it's a recall or inside the warranty period and that's actually free.

Your tool has the ability to mate a brand new PCM to a specific vehicle? I was reading Techline and you can no longer swap computer modules between cars for diagnostic purposes because they're permanently tied to the car they're paired with. So if you bought a new one, you need to be able to not just load the software, but also tell the PCM ""this is the car you belong to now"" so to speak. I've read that GM has made it very difficult for third party tools to work with their computer modules, and changes things from model year to model year to thwart compatibility.

>But they can all be purchased by either you or I. Now, I wouldn't expect you to purchase it. What I would expect is you bring it to me to repair it. And yes it's going to be expensive.

So you are equipped to diagnose the full range of current model year vehicle problems including those problems that have no known cause or solution? Because my vehicle required GM engineering to get involved. You have access to GM engineering?

>What it really comes down to is... You can buy a 2015 Cadillac XT5 and pay for it when it breaks down or you can either purchase a 1970 Cadillac Eldorado and fix it yourself for much cheaper or even better, buy a bicycle. You have options.

videos,ffcf4zf,t1_ffcclyg,1579798122.0,">But anyone can become a technician and work on cars and anyone can work on their own vehicle and fix any problem if they want to purchase the correct tools to do it.

How do you obtain software updates from the manufacturers? Do you own the software and hardware for each make needed to properly diagnose and update software on them? Do you have the ability to reprogram a BCM or PCM to match the vehicle you're installing it into? Are you able to obtain the ongoing education required to properly utilize these tools?

In practice even if these things are available to the average person, they cannot afford them. So when your 2017 Cadillac XT5 has a misfire that requires a very expensive scan tool to diagnose and a software update only available from GM, your only recourse is the dealership.

EDIT: I found ACDelco sells access to GM's TIS2Web and GMSi for several car payments for the average person for just a few days worth of access for a *single* car. I still can't find where you can obtain a Tech2 to actually be able to load the calibrations and updates on your vehicle.

This means in *theory* a regular shop could handle this stuff if they were properly equipped, paid the money to access it, and got the ongoing training on how to use it. And that's just *one* manufacturer. In practice? No. A regular shop is not going to have the time or money to equip and train themselves for all the major manufacturers."

gifs,ffbdx4l,t1_ffaqy4p,1579761188.0,"> A few thoughts before I go through your list. One - you're the stepdad and he has an absent father, at 14. By definition this creates issues, no matter how attentive and awesome you are (and it sounds like you've really stepped up, don't get me wrong). First course of action is to get him into some Cognitive Behavior Therapy with a therapist that specializes in adolescents and children/families. Once a week for him, with an additional once a month for the three of you (and any other kids in the home).

I'll keep calling ones on our plan and see if there's any that have availability. It's pretty scarce down here even though we have a lot of therapists on our plan.

Thanks for the encouragement! I stepped in when he was 8, so I've had plenty of time to do relationship building. Otherwise I'm sure this would be a lot worse. I really do think he thinks of me as his dad, not just a random adult that he's forced to listen to.

> Also, something to keep in mind is that it's a slight misstep to ask yourself ""what can I do to make him stop/change/fix XYZ behavior"". Here's why - you can't control the choices he makes, and as a young teen he's figuring this out and rubbing your faces in it. That's what teens do. So I hear you, and your next question is probably ""wtf CAN we do then??"" and the answer is focus on controlling YOUR reactions and imposing consequences that simply teach cause and effect. Stop worrying about whether or not the consequence ""fixes"" him - it likely won't right now. What it WILL do is teach him that ""when I do XYZ, there are consequences to my choices"". Your job is to think up (with his mom's approval, obvs) consequences that he understands, even if he doesn't agree with them. Let me see if I can help with some of your list, based on how I'd deal with it if it were my teens (bio, step, adopted, and foster):

That's a good perspective and I'll work on trying to think this way.

> Is this ACTUALLY throwing and being destructive, or just being rough and careless with them that breaking is a worry? If it's destruction-level I'd again refer to a therapist, as my hunch is it's related to creating chaos around the symbolism of Christmas (common in kids with absent parents). Either way my response would be the same - in our home you are always safe and loved. When your actions make things unsafe, you need to be in your room until you are ready to rejoin our activity. If you whinge/argue/stomp/get dramatic, you can wait until I invite you to try again. Being in their room isn't a punishment (as in, punitive and arbitrary), it's a direct connection to ""in our home we are all safe and loved"".

It was carelessness and thankfully not destructive. Although his interest in Christmas has dwindled down to outright disdain, which is distressing. It's one of my wife's favorite times of the year and he's done more than a half decent job sucking the fun out of it. So maybe there's some of that attempt to create chaos going on, idk.

We did eventually send him to his room, and then the extended follow on conversation ensued where we tried further to get him to understand why we were hurt and how his actions impacted us. I know we didn't handle it perfectly but we didn't demand an apology.

>  This is really important to me/mom, so I think it's best we take a break from being in each other's space right now so I can focus on helping your mom feel better. I'll come get you when it's time for dinner. Until then stay in your room.

This would have been a good enhancer to what we did. Probably sooner than when we did too.

> Rather than argue with them, I just let them know they can't go to the community youth center until they fix the online grade report. 

I guess the equivalent for him would be karate and boy scouts. Do I understand right that it would actually be a good motivator to take these away? I've been hesitant because they're his primary forms of socialization and physical activity.

The other thing that gives me pause is his grades are down a deep dark hole right now, so he would be looking at quite awhile before he even got back to a C average.

> Either the chores are done or they're not. Don't get into why.

OK.

> Set up parental access controls to stop this from happening. There's a ton of awesome programs that can be managed from your laptop.

I guess the stuff I'm using isn't good enough and I'll look into changing it.

> The harder you push against his need for privacy at this age, the harder he will rebel. Please don't take his door. I promise it won't help the way you want it to. Controlling tech access is absolutely doable via parental control apps and physically taking devices. That sounds like it needs to happen for sure, until/unless he uses them responsibly.

The reasoning here is that the one thing he absolutely always manages to do is remember to close and lock his door. He makes absolutely every attempt to avoid allowing us to enter it, look at or in it, etc. It really makes me wonder what he's got going on in there, and I'm trying to figure out the right tack to take on this. I don't want to come off as the gestapo, but it is our house and we have a right to know what he has in his possession (the worst fear of course being drugs, I don't think so and hope not, but). The extreme secrecy does make me suspicious though.

On a practical aspect, his room is a safety hazard. He has himself almost tripped trying to get around his stuff to get out. So I need to find a way to make him do at least a minimal job cleaning it up, getting the dust out (he has asthma, actually we all do), and making it safe to get in and out of again. If he refuses to let me in is probably when I'll draw the line and take his door.

> I'm not qualified to weigh in on the psychiatrist aspect, but I do feel strongly against medicating teens during such an enormous growth period of their brain, especially in absence of ongoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for a year or more. He needs to learn better skills, and he's not in a head-space to learn those from his parents right now. That's normal, and it's okay. An adolescent therapist will be able to connect with him (eventually) and really help him see the cause and effect of his actions, and whether or not he's in need of a psychiatrist.

I'd love to find one. I'll keep trying. His grades suffer even more without them, so I can't just take the ADHD meds away.

> Logical consequences can go the other way as well; benefits for good behavior. Try asking what it is that he wants, and make a milestone chart to get it. 

We did that. Take the phone for an example. When he was careless and broke his phone, we gave him a shiny loaner and made him prove he could take care of that for a month before he could use his own funds to purchase the one he really wanted.

And for the most part he takes much better care of it, so I hope he has learned his lesson. It's the other items he's not learning on.

Take the chores. We set a goal. Two months of solid chores being completed with good quality and he gets to pick out a video game. Done and purchased. One week later the quality of the chores dropped to shit.

Loss of use of his laptop, phone, TV are the main ones. He doesn't spend time with friends after school, or go shopping with his allowance money. Allowance gets docked when he fails to complete chores.

> If taking the lock improved the behavior, take it back again. And when he gets it back, if his behavior goes back to normal, you take it again for longer.

> Throwing delicate items? If you break it, you buy it, guess you're going to spend all summer mowing lawns if you don't cut it out.

Correct, however he was tossing around irreplaceable ornaments so that created that whole extra level of drama from him. His attitude seems to be that if he thinks he's right, damn whatever anyone else thinks. This one seems to be hard to unstick, and perhaps a root cause of a lot of the issues."

> The Jeep was going 40-45 mph when it hit Norman’s car, Tempe Police Detective Greg Bacon told KTAR News.

The speed limit in that area is 40 or 45 MPH.

> There is no excuse for the jeep's reasons to not stop at that...other than heart attack.

I can think of reasons but there's no point in scenario play here. Yes they *should* have stopped. But the Jeep's wrong doesn't absolve the bus driver of an improper stop.

I'm serious, go read any other thread here of a driver just randomly stopping and you'll see the randomly stopped driver takes part or all of the blame.

> Other redditors mention that the bus is required to stop at the crossing.

As I cited in the law, the law for that does not apply here. We wouldn't support the bus driver stopping randomly anywhere else would we?

> Even if...thr driver that hits other vehicles from behind are 99% at fault.

That's not correct. If you break the law and someone else breaks the law hitting you, you're still going to see a fair share of the responsibility.

> Imagine if people died in this scenario ... Would you still defend the jeep driver?

I'm not defending the Jeep driver."
IdiotsInCars,ff68s6e,t1_ff6855q,1579621812.0,"A few points:

- There could have been another driver but this is unlikely as the bus driver would have explained this to the police and that would have been the statement the police gave. Instead the bus driver stated that they stopped because of the law, which as I've shown isn't applicable here. Therefore, they illegally stopped.

- Secondly, the tracks are very close to the opposite side of the intersection and the bus would have to stop on the far side like they did to not block the intersection.

- The light is synchronized to the railroad signal (I used to live there).

- Trains almost *never* go through here anymore.

- Visibility is poor due to that tree. The bus driver isn't gaining much if anything by stopping.

- We teach drivers not to try to look down the train tracks because humans are terrible estimators as to whether or not anything is coming. This rule makes even less sense at another train tracks I go through regularly where trains pass at 70+ MPH. A bus stopping isn't going to do squat in that situation and yet they do anyway. This rule that goes against what the law actually says really bothers me because people just do not do well when cars unexpectedly stop when they're not supposed to. Yes the Jeep is partially responsible but if that had been a car that stopped on green? The sub would be calling for them to be ticketed or worse."

The text posted here is editorializing, because the driver says they weren't texting and the officer couldn't find evidence they were. In fact, the driver says that the light was green and he expected the bus to be going which is why he crashed.

Honestly this is no different than so many other cases of human error where people just assume that traffic should be doing something else when it isn't. Everyone has made this type of mistake at some point in their lives, and by the estimate given he was going the speed limit.

I honestly can't think of a good reason why a bus should just stop at train tracks. I've seen it surprise many people, so the Jeep driver's story is completely believable. I don't understand why Arizona law is this way.

In fact, I think the bus driver is liable (partially, perhaps fully?) for this accident:
