New Year’s Eve was a fun dance, the last social thing I had done until I went to church today. I’m not preaching by any means, but for me, it felt amazing. I got to sing my heart out in my religion’s version of mass, then in Sunday school, I had some friends sit on either side of me that I hadn’t seen in months. One was a beautiful lady. We talked before class and after class. She somehow convinced me to step back out of my comfort zone to singing with the choir today after church. And it was so much fun.
