A noble started hitting on my character, but the DM did it so that another PC could come to my rescue(he was human) so that we could bond(my race hates humans). He barely RPed my character at all, but did it correctly because my character is essentially asexual and hates most humans, knowing that he knew my character wouldn't be interested."

MovieDetails,ff7fpca,t1_ff7boux,1579648488.0,"Trades yes, but a lot of blue collar jobs do suck. I worked at pest control and they screw their employees over bad. You get a ""salary""(forgot what they called it) and then over work you because it's not paid hourly. I was working 16 hour shifts every day and when I factored in what I was getting paid it came out to like $5.15 an hour. Another job was a factory job that paid okay, but again they over work you horribly. 12/hr shifts and force you to do a job by yourself that should have 2-3 people doing it. I won't go into anymore, but if a job has a high turn-over rate don't apply."

It coats the noodles and tastes amazing. You can keep the broth if you strain over a bowl and just drop the noodles in after mixing.
