TrueOffMyChest,feztwiq,t1_fezppdt,1579461603.0,"It’s documented fact in schools dude. Look, if you’d like a more recent example of socialism failing look at Venezuela and Hugo Chavez’s term with presidency, it ended with him and his cronies pulling out with all the money, leaving the economy in tatters and with a capitol that is known world wide for the most murders per capita because the authorities are either bankrolled by the cartels or scared shitless to do anything about it themselves.

 I’m not going to pretend to be a teacher and say I’m an authority because I’m just some dude in his early 20’s who likes to hear and read about history every now and then. If you want the proof, explore it yourself. come to your own conclusion after you feel like you’ve explored every perspective and avenue of it. Everything always has at least a few drawbacks and I understand that, 

I’m looking for conflict to see the opposite perspective of my own thought and then surmise if I’m correct or I need to change a thought or belief, because the world gets really boring if everyone just agrees with each other all the time."
TrueOffMyChest,fezmbz5,t1_fezh4dw,1579458953.0,"Wikipedia is only as valid as the college students bringing up their theses with, take that how you will. We're in the age of information, if there's any other credible sources of consolidated mass information I invite you, please, present them.

The reason I lump Stalin and Hitler together is simple. Stalin's USSR and Hitler's Nazi Party operated under the same premise: Socialism. When Hitler first brought the Nazi party to power, they were, and remained Socialist.

China, yes. It's economy relies on America's debt to them(which, to be honest is pretty parasitic). In the surplus of oil that America owns, it could easily pay them in kind but it would inflate the Chinese Renminbi, financially crippling China. Not to mention the amount of CO^2 that China would go through and ruin the atmosphere with, they are amongst the top contributors to pollution in the world with their industry which is a human ethics and safety disaster in of itself."
TrueOffMyChest,fezev0z,t1_fey5y3g,1579456593.0,"Holocaust: Responsible for the death of [~6,000,000 Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)

Everyone can universally agree that hitler was a *massive* piece of subhuman garbage, and the negative stigma and history of these atrocities committed still looms over Germany like a storm cloud not to be soon forgotten.

Now, let's have a little chat about Communism:

Holodomor: Responsible for the death of [7,000,000 Ukrainians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) and this even covers the later 10,000,000 by mass starvation that occured under the United Soviet Social Republic, which then ironically, had to begin importing grain from America just to stay alive; that doesn’t sound like an industrial boom. That industrial boom would only come later in Russian history with Prime Minister Leonid Brezhnev the man just before Prime Minister Gorbachev. Gorbachev was actually communist but he allowed the public a lot of freedom with his policies “Glastnost” And “Perestroika” which is what ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

This is just a small list, I haven’t even covered Mao Zedong’s regime or North Korea. The destruction wrought by this fundamentally broken economical system that we’ve come to know as Communism is being championed around as this golden elixir that can solve all our problems is what scares me.

Capitalism is has fucked up in a massive way, and I’m sure as hell not denying that; but it’s a damn good alternative to Communism.

As for Putin, it’s possible for a country to have the people remain fully faithful to their nation but still acknowledge the horrifying wrongdoings that the country in question has done, We in the US still look back on slavery and early/mid 20th century mass misogyny with disappointment, but we know we can be better than that. **That’s** why we as humans catalogue history... and learn."
TrueOffMyChest,fexc8mr,t3_eqqke6,1579428490.0,"It honestly scares me that there’s been a bit of updraft in people advocating communism when it has been responsible for far more deaths than that of the holocaust. 

Putin was even quoted as saying:

>*”You don’t have a heart if you miss the Soviet Union, but you don’t have a brain if you want it back.”*

[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/epzmkg/what_modern_russians_think_of_the_soviet_union/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the post I got that from if you’re interested.

It perfectly encapsulates the concept of holding a patriotic sentiment for one’s country but without wanting the broken mistakes from which it’s risen from."
