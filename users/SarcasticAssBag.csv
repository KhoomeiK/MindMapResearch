Judging by the lecture, particular things to pay attention to are the grids, the drawings of parallel trenches and the sheer number of troops involved. Also new was that these maps had more detail to them as they were more recent owing to them being drawn by observers in planes or balloons."
todayilearned,ff942nj,t1_ff93sfq,1579704348.0,"There are a few in the lecture but I don't have any handy. One particular development was the use of grids because of the massive development of coordinated and scheduled artillery fire (ie. artillery barrage, then soldiers advance with a new barrage in front of them, then advance again on a set schedule for example.)"

It's like they developed a whole new language and idea of fighting war during those years. WWII saw the development of a lot of new technology both iterative and qualitatively different but WWI was on a whole other planet wrt. development of tactics.

That's an understatement.

After having watched half my family die of cancer in a couple years and the fucking *endless* waiting, miscommunication, archaic IT systems, disinterested doctors and the rationing of pain medication to *terminal* patients, I have cultured a seething hatred for doctors and nurses in general and the public healthcare system in particular.

And you're lucky if the medication is even available and not on a list of what the government has decided they won't reimburse which is why we have regular sob stories in the news about some sick person who can't get the correct medication for what ails them."

It's cool to promote the gig economy when you're young and have little or no roots yet. When you're in your 50s, have two kids in school and a mortgage, more often than not, you'll want a ""steady job"", a career in fact and maybe even a union membership if your union isn't insane. The gig economy is what we *had* and worked very hard to get rid of but somehow have embraced again because we've all been taken for a ride by people in suits talking about ""flexibility""

We seem to be trying everything except the things we have tried before and know work very well. Why not return to what we know works and tweak that instead of constantly try to reinvent the wheel?"

You know how you grew up playing with toys with policemen, firemen etc? I grew up playing with lego sets with police, firemen, soldiers and doctors. It was just one more of those services that society as a whole was expected to provide. Not having a public hospital seems as alien as not having a public airforce or police force.

We also have private hospitals and health insurance if you want it. It's not an either/or.

It's true, though, that this system is incredibly fragile and, with a nearly unchecked level of immigration in the past two decades, the strain put on these system has been formidable, maybe even enough to make them collapse, it doesn't change *how* these systems are viewed by the public. You're right that you shouldn't be entitled to someone else's labor. That's why we pay them and subsidize their education to the point of it being *free*."

Good point. I do think that the levels of aggression you see in comment fields whenever some group of scientists come to some conclusion suggests that people aren't necessarily reacting to methodology.

No one in their right minds get emotionally involved in confidence intervals or population selection criteria. They get emotionally involved when whatever the study said either conflicted with or did not pay sufficient obeisance to their already held beliefs."

Same goes for any study that confirms them, really. People don't really seem to think in terms of ""right or wrong"" but rather ""modern or obsolete"" or ""ethically defensible or morally deviant"" so any study that confirms our opinions isn't seen as a scientific assertion but as men with white coats and clipboards validating our opinions and making us feel good."
