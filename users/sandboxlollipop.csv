I did this at a family funeral recently, haven‚Äôt read in front of a crowd in years and flip it mattered to nail it.

It meant I spoke in a more animated but measured way as I was genuinely passionate about it, and despite a few shakes (we‚Äôre human after all) I cared more about them hearing what I had to say than how I was doing it. Because of that, when I messed up a little on a word, they didn‚Äôt care and just liked the talk in general. Hope this helps x"
