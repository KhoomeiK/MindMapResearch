I did this at a family funeral recently, haven’t read in front of a crowd in years and flip it mattered to nail it. I knew the talk so well that I was convinced everyone in that room not only had to hear what I had to say but I wanted them to really get it, so they wouldn’t be the same after the talk. It meant I spoke in a more animated but measured way as I was genuinely passionate about it, and despite a few shakes (we’re human after all) I cared more about them hearing what I had to say than how I was doing it. Because of that, when I messed up a little on a word, they didn’t care and just liked the talk in general. Hope this helps x"

Also, it frustrates me when I don’t know someone’s, anyone’s, love language. Like, I’m getting you these flowers but is it a useless gesture?? Should I be telling you how awesome you are instead?? So I kind of panic and try to cover as many as I can. At least I tried!"
