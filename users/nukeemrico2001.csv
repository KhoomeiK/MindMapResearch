conspiracy,fffls2e,t1_fffc29t,1579886712.0,I live in Lakeway can take me an hour to get to work that is 18 miles away
wowthanksimcured,ffd0v27,t1_ffcuqxn,1579811209.0,Cheers to that. It's complicated you know I wouldn't want anyone to not be genuine to themselves but it's basically about the power of belief. People have no problem understanding that believing something hurtful or negative can damage a person but when it comes to believing something healthy and good we all say oh well that's just lying to yourself. Fuck if lying to myself about being happy actually makes me happy I'll take it. There's a thin line between belief and truth and the two will come together eventually if you believe in something enough. Take care friend.
wowthanksimcured,ffcu9zu,t1_ff9i3ro,1579807391.0,This guy is correct. Coming from a therapist positive affirmations and positive self-talk even if you don't completely believe actually does affect your mood and it changes the brain if done over time. Fake it till you make it can actually work.
nba,ff895xq,t1_ff85dxe,1579669672.0,All those takes I hear about the Clippers trading Trez are fuckin mental. I would kill to have that guy on my team. One of the hardest working players in the league.
depression,fej0b7m,t3_ep842q,1579152384.0,You have to feel special to yourself first. It's the only way. Fuck everyone else that abandoned you they are missing out. Tell yourself everyday that you are important and one day you might believe it.
depression,feizr83,t1_fehu83l,1579151883.0,"Yes. There are several possibilities here.

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) - linked to trauma/childhood trauma in many cases. We used to call this multiple personality disorder.

Schizoaffective or Schizophrenia - detachment from reality, delusions, hallucinations, limited range of emotion, typically flat

Active Psychosis - also detached from reality but with typically very severe and noticeable symptoms like intense anger, disordered thoughts, word salad

Or you could just be hella depressed/anxious and your mind has shut down to protect itself from anymore harm. That would prob be closest to DID. Either way I would seek help from a friend, parent, teacher. Anyone you trust. Medication and therapy is your way out. Take care, friend."
hockey,fei0t98,t1_fehe11l,1579127815.0,Any team needing a coach is absolutely frothing at the mouth right now. I want him in Dallas.
depression,feg6vtl,t3_eoub2g,1579079798.0,Who knows. I'm friends with a guy that legit doesn't know what anxiety is or feels like bc he's never felt it. Genetics + positive caregivers is my guess. Unfortunately we can't control either of those things but we get left to pick up the pieces.
depression,feg6e8j,t3_eoyfap,1579079110.0,I feel you. I'm in the same spot. Sometimes I think about trying and failing so then everyone would know how fucked up I really am. That comforts me for some reason.
depression,feg61dy,t3_eoyo8p,1579078606.0,It doesn't happen to me but it sounds like you're dissociating. We do this to disconnect from a distressing reality it's pretty common. If it starts happening alot or if it's becoming distressing I would talk to someone about it. Hang in there.
depression,feg4vho,t3_cml6ni,1579077022.0,"I thought getting a Master's degree would save my life and get me ""out."" Now I'm 31, divorced and living with my mom because I can't afford to live on my own. Sometimes I have these moments of clarity and spiritual enlightenment but they fade quickly and now I'm back in the abyss. I'm so tired of this place."
hockey,fdrr97k,t1_fdravj6,1578688485.0,"That's a garbage take. Dude leads the decade in points, has a Conn Smythe, Hart, Art Ross and 3 cups. Kane is one of the best to play the game."
nba,fdq009f,t1_fdpjbmd,1578648097.0,Good thing it would never happen. Probably be over in 5 games.
hockey,fdmobm7,t1_fdmcpt4,1578557859.0,It's so pleasing to see a breakaway go full fuckin slapshot. Off the bar and that's just heaven. More sexy than the skills goals you see at least for me it's just so emphatic like a dunk in basketball.
nba,fdmfeqp,t1_fdm24qf,1578548090.0,I was just thinking the same when I opened the comments. Whole league pissed off tonight lol.
hockey,fcsysl1,t1_fcs46jj,1577928505.0,The ice was definitely not great. The puck was bouncing everywhere I think the Stars just adjusted better or were more suited for a chippy physical game.
nba,fcm4mgu,t1_fclmasj,1577764116.0,"I mean it's a bunch of ""why u mad"" kids calling everyone nephews when you have a take outside whatever narrative is happening at the time. Most people can't think for themselves."
nfl,fcjmt6p,t1_fcipxi9,1577694304.0,Yeah this is the correct take. Jerry wants to win and loves his team just as much if not more than any owner. He just got old.
soccer,fc9yqa4,t1_fc9u5lv,1577560208.0,It's happening in the NFL right now with the new challenge rule on pass interference. The referees refuse to overturn any calls because they feel it's challenging the integrity of the refs.
nba,fc7oniz,t1_fc6ww23,1577514484.0,Probably. Tim Donaghy was on PMT recently and he said the refs would punish players that challenged refs. I'm sure it still happens.
nba,fc7nzb9,t1_fc7gnam,1577513897.0,"He's not an enigma, he just doesn't care. Philly will never win anything with this team."
unpopularopinion,fbqsaci,t1_fbphdfk,1577035063.0,That movie was an abomination.
