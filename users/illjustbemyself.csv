FundieSnark,ff82qvc,t1_ff7o3zt,1579664446.0,That's what I'm wondering
FundieSnark,ff62vi5,t3_erki9o,1579617754.0,"Okay. The PREACHING even the TALKING about DEMONS creates SOME people to go crazy. This whole belief is fucked up. The subconscious mind doesn't need that. 

I hate all that preaching about the Jezebel. I remember someone preaching about her and this guy said stuff like ""if the person wants to volenteer at church she might have a Jezebel"". He said all sorts of common things that could relate to anyone. 

Everyone was thinking everyone else was a Jezebel and it was a completely mean thing that happened because relationships were ruined.

Edit; by ""this guy"" I meant some pastor I heard not the guy in the post."

I hate this nonsense. I hate how people are soooo dumb and listen to preachers like him. 

Even when I was a Christian I hated this guy's attitude...

He's the type of preacher my aunt and uncle thought were correct because of the way he said things. It wasn't even because he had good public speaking skills (which is the main thing people use to say someone is correct with what they say ABSOLUTE dumbasses). My aunt and uncle just liked this guys accent and the WAY he said things and so there you go he's ""knowledge"" is correct because you know the way he said it was the right tone!"

Paul and Morgan are in a different type of christianity than that guy though. 

But they could still be trying to make a profit off it. Yet, I'm not sure if I see anything too wrong with Paul and Morgan. 

Most churches today teach you or influence you to have a ""ministry"" that makes money...

With the guy in the documentary, he is deliberately being a charlatan. With Paul and Morgan, they might just be Christian's trying to make a profit in their type of ministry. 

The guy in the documentary seems like a full atheist pretending to be Christian and preach for money. Paul and Morgan at least seem like they actually believe in christianity themselves."

I'm honestly asking because I don't wear make up much and I worry people dont think I shower because I dont wear make up and they are used to seeing women wearing make up-even other women. 

It makes me sort of mad that the world thinks women who are not wearing makeup must not have groomed.
