onguardforthee,ff6zopc,t3_erw7wa,1579638197.0,"/#doughnutgate is the dumbest scandal I’ve ever seen. To catch y’all up, Trudeau decided to go to a local doughnut chain (Oh Doughnuts) instead of Tim Hortons. Instead of buying a $10.99 dozen of donuts, he bought a $32 dozen of donuts, cause local business. The $47 dozen number floating around is false, as that number is for specialty donuts, not regular ones. He bought 7 dozen doughnuts (I think) and he got a discount for preordering them, so the total price came to $143.57. 

Now, you say, that sounds like a lot. Just remember, that would cost the individual taxpayer 0.000000046511628 cents. Each.

The right is currently getting triggered over 0.000000046511628 cents. 

This is worse than the Obama scandal where he asked for Dijon mustard."

I lost 20 pounds in about a month when I found out I was pre-diabetic last year, and my doctor basically told me I had a few months to change my habits before I went full blown diabetic. I understand where you’re coming from (although I went from 210 to 190). 

I’m glad it’s been a confidence booster, and ride that confidence like a wave. Even if your weight plateaus, keep working on it. Don’t lose hope. You can do this.
