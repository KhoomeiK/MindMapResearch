Edit: I was literally on the way to the store to get some things and start a new grow because my pressure cooker came in. Now I don’t have access to any of the teks. Anyone know where else I can find them?"

antiMLM,ff6rnax,t1_ff6q3zk,1579633447.0,"Founder, I’m sorry. It was the founder and he has sense resigned. He made a lot of idiotic comments like about how Asians can’t say the letter “L” so he named the company lululemon because it’s funny to watch Asians try to say it. Google lululemon founder and you’ll see some stuff from a few years ago."

For one brand I’m an 8, for one the 4 is loose. Dresses? Ha! The top will be falling off and the bottom will rip stitches if I bend over."

findareddit,fezx2o5,t1_fezrtvc,1579462795.0,"Jumping off of this, pretend the weed is food and the terpenes are the flavor profile of a dish. Sativa strains are a more light, upbeat high so go for a wine that is on the lighter side, mostly whites. Indica would probably go better with mostly reds. 

Got a lemony weed? Try a wine with lemon undertones or even a white sangria. Grapey weed? Most Grape flavors in weed are more red grape so go for a red."

FragileWhiteRedditor,fex7o0p,t1_fex6klf,1579426237.0,Thank you. This is very well said.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fex0qxp,t1_few83kj,1579422443.0,Not seeing color is not a good thing. It’s okay to acknowledge that people have a different background or culture from you. If you can do that and still see them as an equal then you’re awesome. If you have to ignore a huge part of who a person is to see them as an equal then your brain needs some rewiring.

MadeMeSmile,fetb3ds,t1_feq02gq,1579373523.0,I mean you can be objectified at any job. Especially a service job. Especially if you’re a woman. I worked at BWW as well as Hooter’s and I can tell you Hoot’s was a better atmosphere. At Hoot’s management looked out for me and the girls I worked with made me feel strong and empowered. At BWW’s no one cared if I felt uncomfortable and I was treated like a wage slave.

Botchedsurgeries,felausj,t1_felaj14,1579217867.0,I’m gonna guess an Eastern European woman who is wearing fake tan and/or dark foundation. That coupled with the lip fillers and hair makes her look more ambiguous or even black and that’s definitely her goal.

therewasanattempt,fe6j4rv,t1_fe1t64u,1578892559.0,"I did not have the option to “just quit” because, like most people working a live-in care job, doing so would have made me homeless. That’s what live-in means. I lived at my job. If you can “just quit” having a home then that’s great for you but that was not my situation. 

I’m working on my PhD. Not a masters. 

My internship only differs from a “real job” in that it has an end date and no healthcare. I work 40 hours a week, sometimes more. I just get paid less and have fewer benefits than people with a “real job.” But yes it’s all much easier because I don’t have to wipe a baby’s but anymore I guess? 

Take your cream pie and go."

AmItheAsshole,fe1b34r,t1_fe19jr0,1578824564.0,"In this case YTA. I thought you meant rice sides and I thought that was pretty weird because I go to all you can eat sushi all the time and never encounter sides of rice. The rice is part of the sushi man.

If you’re ordering nigiri and just eating the fish then you’re in the wrong. It’s meant to be enjoyed with rice and you’re tossing it to get the most bang for your buck. Think of it this way: if I ordered never ending pasta at Olive Garden and only ate the meats in my bowl before requesting another I would be a dick. If all you want is high quality, raw fish then you can buy that at a market or even order it at your sushi spot (if the chef is cool and you build decorum, which you are not doing) and enjoy. You’re being wasteful, screwing over the restaurant (one of the few varieties of restaurants where food is still an art) and that sucks. 

Don’t do that anymore. Order sashimi."

I have also lived in the northwestern part of the country most of my life so I don’t see those bad areas. 

There are plenty of Americans who will insist it’s no big deal so it sounds like our countries have something in common.

fatlogic,fchsexm,t1_fcfafbt,1577653659.0,"If you are overweight and you start starving yourself you will be underweight eventually. You will also exist in a period of time where you are still overweight, losing weight but overweight all the same, and also starving yourself. Which means you are anorexic but overweight. The starving and disordered eating doesn’t transform into anorexia when you pass a certain number on the scale. You would still be anorexic even when you are fat and losing weight rapidly."
fatlogic,fcbzfpa,t1_fcbust1,1577592686.0,"BZZZZT. Wrong. You can be anorexic and not underweight. It’s about disordered eating, not size.

Edit: I’ll just say plenty of anorexic people start fat. You starve yourself because you are fat but eventually you’re not fat anymore. That doesn’t mean you weren’t starving yourself when you were still overweight. And I’m not talking about normal dieting. I mean starvation. Fat people do it to lose weight all the time and because of the starvation they are anorexic. Starving doesn’t magically transform into anorexia when you pass a number on the scale. It’s anorexia before and after you pass the ideal weight."
