AskReddit,femuzjk,t1_femq71r,1579270320.0,"That’s sort of true, because it would definitely make for an interesting friendship dynamic, but there’s a few flaws with that.

First, there’s a rumour going around that Rowling said that the Sorting Hat made two mistakes with sorting (one being Snape being put in Slytherin and not Gryffindor). However, that’s a myth, she never said that, in fact she debunked it. The Sorting Hat never makes mistakes, and puts everyone into their specific houses for a reason, like Neville with his courage at the end of the series. There was a reason Ron and Hermione were put in Gryffindor - and to be fair, we see it as early as the end of the first book where they displayed their Gryffindor qualities in the puzzles while searching for the Philosopher’s Stone.

The second reason is that to be honest, the houses don’t see enough of each other outside of shared classes, lunchtime and quidditch - the latter two, they’re segregated into being with their own houses. They just wouldn’t have compatible schedules. And this is fairly accurate to a lot of British schools, actually. I remember I never really saw anyone outside of my own house because I’d spend all of my classes and form with my house, and when it was our shared lunchtime and break time, we’d stay with people from our own houses as we’d have already bonded with them in form and lessons.
