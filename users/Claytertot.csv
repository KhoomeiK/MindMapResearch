inthesoulstone,ffd9ljg,t1_ffc90i2,1579816119.0,"Spider-Man has a secret identity to try to separate his personal and super hero life and to protect his loved ones, which isn't a problem that most of the other superheroes have.  Most of Iron Man's enemies are actually Tony Stark's enemies, so it wouldn't really change anything if Tony Stark = Iron Man was a secret.  Captain America's close friends and loved ones are basically all superheroes or badasses in their own rights.  Hawkeye doesn't really have a secret identity, but keeps his family a secret.  Etc.

Ant-Man has had problems because his identity isn't a secret (his daughter being endangered).

Spider-Man has a tendency to make a lot of enemies by going out of his way to stop bad guys. He is also trying to be a regular highschool student, which would be impossible while also openly being spiderman.  He also has lots of friends and loved ones (aunt may, MJ, Ned, etc) with no superpowers or means of self defense against the sort of enemies that spiderman makes.

I don't think it's weird at all that this is treated as a big deal."

changemyview,ffa1tze,t1_ff8z64f,1579726188.0,"I disagree with your claim that Bernie is weaker against Trump than other options.

I think the only Democrat currently in the running with a better chance against Trump is maybe Biden.

I think people underestimate how much of the population voted for Trump because they wanted someone outside of the political establishment and Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of the political establishment.

Hillary Clinton is a prime example of a politician whose opinions change with the polls and everyone knows that.

A candidate like Bernie who you can trust believes what they say they believe would be refreshing.  Even to people who don't necessarily agree with his ideals, the fact that he seems to have ideals and principles at all would be a huge plus.

During the Trump V Hillary election I heard a lot of people say ""at least he says what he's thinking"". I don't know if that's true or not, but the perception that he was saying what he thought even if you didn't agree with it definitely helped him.

But I think a lot of people who voted for Trump would gladly vote for a Democrat if it seemed like that Democrat was either:

A) moderate (see Biden)

B) principled and genuinely doing what they believe to be in best interest of America and Americans (see Bernie)

C) Not super partisan (also see Bernie)"

Most anti-vaxxers don't believe that the government is intentionally using vaccines to give children autism. Instead, they believe that the vaccines have accidental side effects which are being covered up because the vaccine industry is worth billions of dollars.  The science suggests that this isn't true at all, but all of the potential motives are there.  Pharmaceutical companies make billions of dollars off of vaccines. Billions of dollars can buy you lobbyists, politicians, influence in the FDA, studies that say what you want them to say, etc.  Just like how pharmaceutical companies are largely responsible for the opioid crisis because they claimed that their painkillers were not addictive and pushed the narrative that it is immoral for a doctor to allow a patient to feel any pain. That's how we got to the point where you'd basically get a months worth of pharmaceutical grade heroin prescribed for any minor surgery or pain.

Neither of them really change the facts, they just shift the narrative by including and excluding different phrases, primary sources, and analysis.

Texas tends to focus on the importance of entrepreneurship and the free market, while California tended to focus on class struggles (the article said that aspects of the California version sound like they are straight out of a Bernie Sanders rally)

Texas added some line questioning the quality of the Harlem Renaissance.

California watered down passages about American Indian violence against white settlers.

Texas didn't focus on the race or immigration status of important people. California highlighted when significant individuals were minorities or immigrants.

California also added a bunch of stuff about nonbinary/lgbt individuals in history.

Texas included a primary source of a border patrol officer in the section about illegal immigration.

California included a note of additional analysis about the 2nd amendment debate.

Texas included less discussion about certain racial historical events.

That sort of stuff. Neither of them were factually wrong. They just shifted the narrative with opinions, different primary sources, etc. Texas's *was* probably worse, but both shifted it for political agendas.

Most criminals are victims of poverty or bad childhoods but they should still be held individually responsible for their actions once they come of whatever age we decide is adulthood.  When I read a news story of a 18-20 year old killing someone in a robbery gone wrong or something it breaks my heart for the person who was killed and for the killer.   The criminal was probably failed by their parents, their community, and their society, and then they went on to ruin their own life and take someone else's.  But that doesn't mean I don't think that person should face the full consequences of their actions.  Plenty of people have terrible, impoverished childhoods and then grow up to be adults capable of not being criminals."
IdiotsInCars,fcxmqlt,t1_fcx4g0r,1578066645.0,"If you had half a brain you'd look into the context of the incident and find that the cop was rushing to a call of a baby who had stopped breathing. He still clearly made a mistake, but it was a mistake made under extreme pressure and urgency.  I have had enough first aid training to know that the number one rule is ""don't make yourself another victim out of urgency or recklessness"", but in the same situation I cannot honestly say that I know for sure that I would've done better.  Fortunately no one was injured and the baby was ok."

I'm not going to hop on the fuck cops bandwagon for an honest mistake under significant pressure where no one was seriously injured."

If it's not for you, that's totally cool. But if it is for you, it will probably spark your imagination like few other works of media in history have ever been capable of.  It is no coincidence that so many works of fiction are directly or indirectly influenced by Tolkien's work."

WTF,fcwahgw,t1_fcw8qxw,1578020895.0,"Some sort of EMS or fire Dept was almost certainly also called, but police often respond to calls like that too, especially if they can get there quicker. I think most police get basic first aid/first responder training.

Especially somewhere like rural Texas where it might take a long time for an ambulance to arrive, they would probably just be trying to get whoever could get there there as quickly as possible."

TheMandalorianTV,fcvnjtl,t1_fcvdzov,1578005943.0,Why? This is between RotJ and TFA. We know that Luke rebuilt the Jedi Order to some extent in that time before Ben turned to the dark side and destroyed the temple.

TheMandalorianTV,fcvbwem,t1_fc50crc,1577998861.0,"Based on the timeline, this would be right around when Luke is reforming the Jedi Order. It seems at least as likely to me that he'd find Luke as Ahsoka, except perhaps for the budget difference in getting Mark Hamill vs whoever would play live action Ahsoka.  Though, honestly, I think Mark Hamill seems to really care a lot about Luke as a Character, so he might be willing to do it. Especially in a setting where his opinions about the character would probably be taken more seriously than it seems like they were for the sequel movies."

TheMandalorianTV,fcva67t,t1_fc50adr,1577997846.0,"I think Clone Wars / Rebels has given a slightly different canon explanation. It's been a hot minute since I've watched either, so sorry if I'm not totally correct with this.

The dark saber was made by an ancient mandalorian Jedi, and when he died the Jedi kept it in the Jedi Temple, but instead of being stolen by a sith Lord and a mandalorian, it was stolen by a clan of Mandalorians. I don't remember if that was the start of the war between the Mandos and the Jedi, but it may have been."
