howyoudoin,ffcj9d8,t1_ffci9jx,1579800643.0,Sure - not blaming Ross here. I'm wondering if it's too passionate on Susan's end.
howyoudoin,ffcj7w9,t1_ffchc9i,1579800618.0,"I can't believe Susan is weighing in here!

I totally agree that this is not a deal breaker kiss by any means. I think I feel the same - it's like a little too much but just annoyed for a few days too much. 

Susan could definitely take Ross. And even with the context, I was thinking, if Susan walked in at that moment, it would look like too much."

aww,fedo4fm,t3_eokyfc,1579016202.0,"This is a very touching story. Same thing happened to my stepdad and my mom. They consider my little sister their miracle baby.

Recently I asked, ""what about [little brother]? He was born after [little sister]... Why don't you call him a miracle?""

My mom paused for a full thirty seconds and then said, ""Right... He's also a miracle, I guess.""

It was after my little brother was born that my stepdad decided to stop listening to doctors and get a vasectomy."

AskNYC,fcjvduy,t3_ehipy2,1577706599.0,"I lived in a 300sq ft apartment with my husband and cat for almost 5 years. 

I lived off Apartment Therapy at the time so I agree that's a good resource (or it was, I don't really read it anymore). 

My best advice is that everything should double as storage. We have a couch that opens up and stores blankets/pillows. We have a coffee table that has little shelves in it. A storage bed. A dining room table that folds out and stores the chairs inside. The list goes on. 

Ikea is really great for this type of stuff. I find their products a bit pricey out of the box so I would find something that worked for an idea that I had and then search the name on Craigslist. Every single time I was able to find someone selling the thing I wanted."
newyorkcity,fc5fsgw,t1_fc5aa00,1577456339.0,Ha I should've guessed I would make myself pretty easy to dox with this comment.
newyorkcity,fc4ti0z,t1_fc4nt83,1577427817.0,"No one calls it like this - it's 1 WTC and 2 WTC (though no one references 2 WTC yet so I'm not sure how that will end up).

Edit: most people say ""world trade"" as in ""One World Trade""

Source: I work in 4 WTC."
friends_tv_show,fb10jvd,t3_eao1ys,1576431061.0,I disagree - I'm watching all of the episodes for the first time and season 1 is a New Years episode. They don't even mention Christmas at all.
