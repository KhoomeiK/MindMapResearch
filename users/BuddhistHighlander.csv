SuicideWatch,ffcokkl,t3_esvzvf,1579803878.0,"I'm sorry if I wasn't much help. It truly breaks my heart hearing someone who's struggling this much. I wish I could do more. You deserve to be respected, just like we all are."
SuicideWatch,ffclu3k,t3_esvzvf,1579802197.0,"Hey, I'm sorry about what you're going through. It must be tough living with them. They sound like narcissists. Is there anyway way you could look for an LGBTQ support group? I sincerely hope you can find a safe way out of this."
ForeverAlone,ff9vy60,t3_es9qt8,1579722691.0,It's really something. I had homeless friends at a time that were picking up girls left and right while I was alone at my house wondering what went wrong in my life.
antinatalism,ff53zrx,t1_ff4d8ip,1579579597.0,"I agree with you on this. I'm barely leaving my house as it is. I just don't see a point. Then again, I am a little afraid of the outside world."
SuicideWatch,ff49lro,t1_ff49g5m,1579558539.0,"I know. I've tried changing too. It's a challenge, but I believe in the long run, you'll see good results."
SuicideWatch,ff499vs,t1_ff496dw,1579558332.0,"I believe any person can change. It takes time, but it's possible."
SuicideWatch,ff48x9b,t1_ff48tko,1579558114.0,I'm glad you're still here. Is there anything that could calm you down right now?
SuicideWatch,ff3u6ka,t3_erh3wr,1579548931.0,"Hey, man, are you still around?  I hope you are. I can relate to the depression and anxiety. I'm here if you want to talk."
SuicideWatch,ff32czu,t3_er13gq,1579531862.0,"I'm the same way. I could easily hang myself, but I can never endure the pain."
SuicideWatch,ff2r644,t3_eravik,1579520400.0,"Man, I envy you. I've been planning my suicide since I was sixteen. But I always chicken out. But now? The rope has never looked better. I truly hope you find peace in your decision. Life is nothing more than a cruel, sadistic mind fuck."
loseit,fez0fao,t3_eqx3px,1579452722.0,"Man, I'm sorry you're going through this. I always find it hard to lose weight when you're living under your parents roof. I would maybe try to sit all your family down and really try to convey to them on why you're eating this way. It's probably not much help, but it's worth a shot. Oh, and good job on losing weight! It's good that you're taking charge!"
SuicideWatch,feyhzbh,t3_eqp6ad,1579445839.0,"Man, I feel you! I thought about moving to Japan to start over. However, I can't because I dropped out of high school. Also, I eventually lost interest moving there."
SuicideWatch,feyhbw5,t3_eqw0kl,1579445568.0,"Hey, I just want to say I feel you. I'm also a high school dropout, and boy, is the stigma tough. I wish school never existed in the first place."
antinatalism,feyfiim,t3_eqsu8o,1579444813.0,"Ah, thank you for this post. I feel the same way. But when I say stuff like this, people look at me like I'm a villian. If only they would understand that I just don't want future humans to suffer."
SuicideWatch,felm6z6,t3_epkxrf,1579225508.0,"Hey, man, I'm sorry this is happening to you. I failed high school too, and now, I can't even accomplish most of my dreams because I need a high school diploma in order to accomplish anything. I hope you can find some help for school, because I truly feel for people who struggle in your situation. Here's hoping the best."
SuicideWatch,felj8x5,t1_fekdbvs,1579223498.0,"Man, you're right about this. I was recently sent to a psych ward for my anxiety and suicide ideation. Never should have told my therapist my thoughts."
depression,felaxjh,t3_eppt67,1579217916.0,"Hey, I just want to say I know how you feel. I get about $1200 in disability. I'm not really struggling financially, but mentally. I feel ashamed to be on SSDI because I can't work due to my depression. I hope you can find some sort of happiness in your life, whatever that may be."

SuicideWatch,feg6v56,t3_eoylny,1579079772.0,"I feel the same way. I'd glady try to save someone from their own destruction, while ignoring my own destruction from miles away."
SuicideWatch,fe2bpdw,t3_enmbn5,1578836625.0,"Man, I feel this all the way. I feel like I have anhedonia. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. Not even my hobbies."
Animedubs,fe1zsng,t3_enb5on,1578832850.0,"God, I hope he turns out okay. He's my favorite voice actor."

SuicideWatch,fdz6uou,t1_fdz6gmb,1578787228.0,"Man. That sucks. I often view myself in the third person point of view, like I'm outside of my body watching myself."
SuicideWatch,fdz5r1t,t3_enequc,1578786990.0,"Hey, I'm not trying to diagnose you, but could what you're experiencing be depersonalization? I have this disorder, and what you're describing your feelings as sounds like mine, too."
SuicideWatch,fdxyv2t,t3_enb5mq,1578774271.0,"My God, you are a good writer! I could learn from you! Anyways, I just want to say you are very brave for asking this girl out.

Hope things get better for you in the future."

nihilism,fdluvmg,t3_elwz0s,1578533048.0,"You know, I feel the same way. The boredom is killing me. Life just feels like a drag to participate in. I wouldn't mind visiting the void either, my friend."
depression,fdkybwv,t3_elvipt,1578513675.0,"Man, I feel you on this one. I've been rejected eight times already. I'm done with this shit."
SuicideWatch,fdkp4m6,t1_fdjw3n0,1578508226.0,"I agree with your statement hole heartedly. With people opting out via Euthanasia, there'd be less people to work, and without that, Capitalism would burst into oblivion."
SuicideWatch,fdknb37,t3_elvbou,1578507131.0,"Hey, man, I also have agoraphobia. Though it's a bit on the milder side. I just got out of the psych ward for it. Now, I'm taking small steps, like going to the library and stores around my house. Oh, and I feel you about the failing high school part. I dropped out at 16 due to my mental illness. So  don't feel ashamed about it. You're trying your best, and that's all that matters."

SuicideWatch,fdgwglo,t3_elbqdq,1578410028.0,Don't be sorry for this post. I related a lot to what you just said. It's why I'm an Efilist. Because life really does suck.

SuicideWatch,fc6mj0q,t3_egdhyc,1577484101.0,"Yup, this is how society works. Depression makes pharmaceutical companies a shit ton of cash. No more depression? No more money for them. They're all twisted."
