seduction,fez4kbr,t1_feyycln,1579453787.0,"There was this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eqcx9v/just_let_her_go_and_move_on_with_next_one/) yesterday which basically outlines some of it. Try to be creative as much as you can. Completely stay away from boring texts like ""how are you"". You can learn from r/tinder if you want some examples. But do remember not all are good. There's not right or wrong with a girl. Even if you said something wrong, but if you manage to turn the tables to favour you, then you're all good.

What works for me is, everytime she replies my text or if I were to initiate a text by replying to her story is, I sit back, try to think of something very creative to start the convo/reply that is light hearted and funny at the same time. Try to flirt a bit if you can but not too much. Try to light heartedly and jokingly compliment her. All the best!"
love,feo8820,t3_eq3rlz,1579296409.0,"This just struck me about my best friend. Ive been opening up to him about everything and he's been very cool with it (I'm a guy btw if youre reading this in a girl intonation). Then I kinda relate it to relationship like your post, we should open up everything with our lover because they too are our bestfriend!"
Perfectfit,fenjcfr,t1_fen1jhj,1579285932.0,Hahaha no worries friends. I'm still a student and I made sure they are far apart!!

seduction,feeyelp,t1_feey7b5,1579043945.0,"Because I failed, friend. I got two rejections and one I think I can't go far with because I texted. It's hard man. I just don't know what to say when I text. Especially when the other side isn't responding well. It just isn't worth the emotional investment."
seduction,feererr,t1_feeqkt1,1579039600.0,This is reasurring. Thank you!!
dating_advice,febcrqa,t3_eo3d6q,1578957558.0,"Vent: I swear ghosting is not cool. If youre not interested just say so. It takes a lot to have the balls to talk to someone you like. I didn't even get the chance to ask a lot. But then you ghosted me. Was I boring? Did I say something wrong? Where was I wrong? I'm tired of this. I will completely give up if someone ghosts me in the middle of a conversation. It's cool if you ghost when I said hello. But you replied as if you were interested to talk, but then when I kept the conversation going, you ghosted me. I'm sorry I have no time for this. Thank you."

AskReddit,fdm8j2y,t3_elzbiv,1578542446.0,"I come from somewhere it doesn't snow, then I moved to somewhere where it snows. The first time I saw the first snow fall down from the sky, it was magical. I was outside, laughing and dancing. But it didn't snow heavily that night and I was a bit disappointed. And then there was one time I woke up like I usually do, checked out and it was white all over the place! It felt like Christmas although it was in February! Bro I was excited as fuck. It's so calming and peaceful seeing snow everywhere."

relationships,fd5kvtq,t3_ek1j2u,1578178633.0,I wouldnt think it's about you crying. I think it's how you handle the awkwardness. Should've said something smart to counter her. Awkwardness kills intimacy.

offmychest,fcvvy9o,t3_ej6ybc,1578011322.0,This is exactly 100% similar to how I feel right now. Like how the fuck do you even solve this am I right? I am so fucking clueless and so tired of this. I can't even like somebody! I completely gave up :(

offmychest,fcrl0f1,t3_eilghl,1577903189.0,Only time can help you move on. Not even alcohol or drugs can help you at all. Tried that and I only kept relapsing the trauma. Just think about it deeply until you bore yourself out of it. Time is the only solution.

dating_advice,fcewuzl,t1_fcev60w,1577624483.0,"No worries. I would love some perspective as I'm learning myself. Yeh I agree with what you said. What I suggested is mostly on how to initiate a conversation with someone who you never talk to? Because as a guy, it feels so random to suddenly talk to a girl especially if the girl doesnt go out at all. In my culture, girls generally dont go out as they are more conservative towards social culture. For a guy in my culture, it basically reduces our chances by a huge amount as we rarely get to meet the girl that we aim to approach."

dating_advice,fcd5n1k,t3_eh1535,1577606657.0,"Dont ask them out yet. Start with social media game. Compliment how she looks whenever she posts a story of her selfie or something. Girls like to be noticed. When she posts about her life, ask about it. Show interest. If she responds well, then you know there can be something between you. So keep going until she says no."

offmychest,fc4bjs4,t1_fc4bbpi,1577411924.0,"Thank you for your reply. I'll just say this just in case because I'm worried for you and want you to have a better life ahead, if you cant break off gently, then break off roughly. You are the centre of your story. Goodluck!!! May God Bless You :)"
offmychest,fc49x0y,t3_eg3wav,1577410612.0,"Surprisingly, a lot of attractive people don't actually have as much confidence in dating. Good looks does not guarantee confidence. Lucky she said yes for you!"
offmychest,fc49ogt,t3_eg407p,1577410423.0,"It's normal to feel that way. :) That just means you prioritise your relationship with them over anything else which is really cool and wholesome. Not a lot of people take that extra effort to fake it! But I'm not saying you should continue doing it, try adding in your own opinion as a spice to the conversation. If you dont, be honest too! No worries, no one is going to get mad at you."

There is no need to be scared. I just broke up from a 5 year long relationship a few months ago. Now I'm talking to someone new and she is definitely better. Do not get scared to break off from him.
