I just need to ride out a lot of stuff on my own and deal with it anyway I can. I don't talk about my mental health due to my upbringing, and that is, men are to show no emotion, never mind the idea of talking about it, due to the offensive nature people see in this. I had also been told to sit quietly and say absolutely nothing at all. And if I did, by the ever loving fuck did I get in trouble. This had been drummed into my head since child hood. 

I feel going to therapy is a great idea, something that I want to commit to, but feel I cannot due to the way I was raised. I don't know what I'm gonna do in the new year. It sucks, but I gotta do something... I just... Just can't cope. I don't even feel like eating or showering with out wanting to cry myself to sleep. 

Either way, there are people out there much worse off than me. I can only hope they can rise like the Phoenix and fly... For I cannot even consider flying with broken wings.
