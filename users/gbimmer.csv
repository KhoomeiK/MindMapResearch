We are the thinkers.  The ones who are looking at things differently.  The ones using our brains to make decisions rather than our hearts.  Leftists do the exact opposite.  Who cares about someone else's money?  Does it affect you?  Hint: it doesn't.

Before the industrial revolution the income disparity was far, far, far larger than it is now.  Here's the thing, though: everyone was also far poorer too.  The poor of today, right now, are richer than many of the rich of just 200 years ago.  Heck just 50 years ago it was uncommon for a middle income family to have 2 cars.  Now it's normal.  It was uncommon to have more than one bathroom.  Now it's uncommon to only have one.  The world's GDP is literally 25x per capita what it was in 1800.

https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth

Why?  Capitalism.  The American economic model did that.  Not communism or communism-lite (socialism).  Capitalism.

Why does communism fail every time?  Simple: it ignores human nature.  People are lazy.  Everyone is lazy.  Literally every single person is lazy.  It's just some people morph their laziness into productivity by finding a better way of doing something.  That's the essence of what makes humanity great: it's laziness.  It's why we came down from the trees.  It's why we made the first spear.  It's why we created fire, the wheel, even the space shuttle.  Because we're damn lazy!  So we invent better ways to do things.

We're also greedy.  We want shit.  We create better ways to do things so we have more to trade so we get more shit.  We even got so lazy and so greedy we invented money!  

So now we have lazy people creating shit to get money so they can enjoy their greed!

Now what's the easiest way to get more money?  Lend it to the next guy with a good idea with interest!  Now you're increasing your wealth while being as lazy as possible so the other asshole works and makes you money!

Now some people are really good at finding people with good ideas but no resources.  They're called ""investors"".  They're extremely greedy.  They're so greedy they take risks to get even bigger payouts.  So they lend these other people money who have good ideas and those other people hire other lazy people out of laziness because they don't feel like doing their own work.  Those workers gladly do the work because it's easier to get paid to get more shit than try to do it on their own because they haven't had the right idea to make something easier to do.  

Now you have socialism and communism.  It goes to all these lazy, greedy bastards and says ""you're no longer allowed to be lazy or greedy.  We're taking your shit.""

So they stop inventing.  They stop trying to find easier ways to do shit because they're lazy... But smart.  They know there's no point in inventing a new thing because they're never going to get shit for their work.  So why try?  Why work at all when you get the same things either way?  

As everyone figures this out there's less and less things being made.  Less and less ideas to make life easier.  Less and less hope for more shit in the future.  

Congratulations!  You just killed the human spirit!  Now everyone is equally starving!

This is why every time communism is tried it fails.  It cannot succeed.  It's flaws are insurmountable because it's a societal dead end.

But some people are too stupid to think this out.  And they elevate like minded idiots like Bernie and AOC.  They're the most dangerous idiots on the planet because they destroy societies.

But people follow them because they're lazy and greedy.  Free shit, right!  But those that follow aren't smart enough to see the end result: utter collapse.

Be smart.  And lazy.  And greedy."
