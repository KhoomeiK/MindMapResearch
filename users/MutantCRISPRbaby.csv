Another mind blowing fact I just read - party bosses are able to get 17x the amount of campaign money from one single donor than the actual candidates are running for office.  County chairmen can raise up to $37k and then donate the money to any candidate that they want through 'wheeling'.  Basically what you have setup is a huge pay-to-play scheme.  

Heh, the chapter on your property taxes was also craaaaaaaazy, especially the part how millionaires with huge properties figured out ways to transform their mansions into 'farms' with $500 worth of economic activity per year so that they could get huge tax breaks for 'land preservation'.  Meanwhile, the middle class in your state gets hammered with property taxes.  At one point, Christine Whitman was paying less than $5000 for her 228 acre property and only $47 on her other property that was almost 50 acres because she put a small number of animals on them and sold a little bit of wood to qualify as a 'farm' with $500 worth of economic activity.

Holy toledo, what a nightmare.  My aunt and uncle are basically senile and need 24/7 care because they have age related dementia.  They are massive safety risks to themselves and others.  Insurance refuses to put them into homes where they can be watched under care.  For now, insurance has tried to control costs by sending in-home health workers to check in on them.  However, people who go to the home have found my uncle laying on the floor passed out unconscious, because he didn't properly take his meds (he's senile, and threw them in the trash). My aunt is basically entirely out of it and can't even use the bathroom without help.  Of course they find her when they get in with her garments completely soiled and human waste all over the house.  My uncle tries to get the mail down his driveway and ends up rummaging through all of his other neighbor's mailboxes looking for mail.  While my uncle still has some mental capacity, he cannot care for my aunt in his state.  She simply wears him out. She won't stay asleep and routinely gets up all all hours of the night turning on lights and waking up my 83 year old uncle.  It just wears him out.  Also, there are alllllllll sorts of hazards in the house.  I mean they've found the stove left on and stuff melted in the microwave.  They also still have access to very steep steps down the basement that they could easily fall down.  It's amazing they haven't burnt down the house of fallen down the stairs yet.  

But my cousins have desperately tried to get long term care for their parents.  One of the facilities wanted $13,000 straight up front before they'd even begin to talk about putting their parents in the facility.  Insurance won't pay for any of it because they don't want to pay for huge costs related to long term care, which can run $100k per year.  

If you think healthcare costs for having a baby are absurd,wait until more horror stories come out millions of peoples' baby boomer parents age and need LTC for age related dementia.

science,fetrof5,t3_eqeb15,1579379078.0,"First, I doubt most people commenting on this thread have any idea of what it is like to be on the frontines protecting public health. Not even the reg affairs people on the industry/academic side know what it is like.  The FDA is absolutely overwhelmed.  There is so much you can humanly do in a given amount of time in the day.  Secondly, the FDA has been between a rock and a hard place for forever.  The public demands safe therapies as fast as possible while industry wants their drugs approved as fast as possible.  Patient groups constantly put pressure to get the FDA out of the way while industry constantly applies pressure to the agency to get out of the way because they want to sell their new drug. The funding for the FDA is also directly supplied by the pharmaceutical industry via PDUFA, MADUFA etc.  Prior to the pharmaceutical industry funding the FDA, the FDA was hamstrung by funding and couldn't hire enough staff to review new drugs.  Companies would have their product applications backed duo for years and it was common to see offices stacked with backlogs of applications stacked from floor to ceiling.  Industry and patient groups complained that the agency was too slow to approve new drugs, and Congress wouldn't solve the problem byninjecting billions more that were needed to hire tons more staff and to build infrastructure that was needed to handle the workload.  In order to solve the problem, industry actually came up with the idea to find the FDA to give the agency billions in funding to relieve the staffing backlog and to modernize their infrastructure.  And that's what we have today, the FDA is primarily funded through industry dollars through PDUFA etc.  It allowed the agency to hire a ton more staff.  In exchange for the funding, the law was changed so that the FDA would now be required to provide decisions on hard deadlines, roughly in 30 days or so (depends on the type of application).  While this has initially worked, the agency has now been so overwhelmed with applications with hard deadlines they have to meet that it is almost humanly impossible to make sure everyone follows their promise to report late trial results.  If the agency started enforcing that they'd have to pull manpower from other areas, which would cause delays with review and cause the agency to not meet timelines requires by law.  If that happened, then the FDA's pdufa, mdufa etc funding would be at risk for being pulled.  Oh yeah, don't forget, that the FDA also had to regulate 25% of the entire country's GDP, the agency still is expected to make sure as best as possible that all of those shipping containers sent over here with foods and medicines have safe to consume products. 

Either the agency meets the law, which spreads manpower so thin that it is impossible to enforce everything, or the agency become much more rigorous and starts missing deadlines, which will threaten its funding and will cause even more chaos.  Oh yeah, let's also not forget that industry is constantly poaching away FDA workers with higher salaries because they know the system.  

The real solution is for congress to fund the agency with billions of more dollars and to pay staff even more than what industry pays so that govt work and protecting public health is more attractive than selling out to industry.  Of course nom of that will ever happen, so this is what you get.  Again, many have never know what it is like to be on the frontlines trying your best to protect people without being overly burdensome so that you're not blocking something from industry that might provide benefit.  The FDA gets squeezed from all sides."

In fact, by using 2 or more animal models, we've gotten pretty good at catching toxicities before they reach the clinic.  There have been papers published before showing where up to 70% of toxicities in clinical trials could be predicted by animal models (I can find them if you wish).  

Do not conflate efficacy with safety though.  Animals models are critical for helping to establish safety.  You simply cannot start testing new experimental ideas on pregnant women, fetuses, infants, children, etc. etc.  The entire world has come to the agreement that you should ethically do all that you can to try your best to get an idea for safety.

* Scientists used genetic manipulation to establish that X leads to Y.  In this case, X is PAR1, and Y is improvement in myelin sheath damage.  By removing PAR1 you can decrease sheath damage.  The logical conclusion from model studies is that PAR1 is linked to repairing sheath damage, and that by inhibiting or blocking the PAR1 pathway, you can achieve this effect.  The scientists were able to do this in vivo by genetically removing PAR1.

* The scientists tested known PAR1 inhibitors that are already FDA approved on some cells in a dish.  The in vitro results correlated with their in vivo studies, further confirming this link.  


But you shouldn't jump ahead of yourself.  Voraxapar is not approved for CNS indications.  It is very, verrrrry difficult to design small molecule drugs to pass the blood brain barrier, which is a protective mechanism your CNS has to keep out toxins and other baddies away from your brain.  The problem is that you need to access the CNS to treat maladies like Parkinson's, MS, etc, so the BBB poses a significant challenge.  

From a cursory review, it is unlikely that voraxapar crosses the BBB, imo.  From a medicinal chemistry view, the molecule is too big.  It has a molecular weight of almost 500, while most BBB penetrating drugs need to be much smaller, like on the order of 300-400 mw.  Also, from an educated guess just looking the molecule for voraxapar, it wouldn't have the desired polar surface area and charge when administered in vivo for having optimal chances at crossing the BBB. I'm going to guess that it will almost assuredly not cross the BBB to be able to treat people with dieseases like Parkinson'sns or MS. 

That being said, the research offers possibilities. It may be possible to directly administer voraxapar into the CNS with spinal injections, which of course would be less desirable for a method of delivery because you'd have to constant keep going back for injections.  It's also plausible in theory to develop an anti PAR1 antibody that you could administer that'd bind to and block the GPCR, and antibodies have much longer half lives.  A patient might only have to go in two or three times  a year for a spinal injection if an antibody were developed."

I'm not sure why there is so much hatred of educated people.  It's not like they're Walmart billionaires who avoid taxes and who pay employees poverty wages that are supported by taxpayer subsidies via medicaid, SNAP etc.  

I grew up in a very middle class family.  My dad immigrated here with $30 in his pocket and learned English by watching Clint Eastwood films + by talking to GI soldiers during Vietnam.  My mom was a social worker for the state. They sent me to college and I eventually earned a PhD in engineering, but I didn't grow up rich and needed student loans to go to school.  Graduate school in engineering was free, because STEM at the graduate level is supported by stipends and is usually tuition free. You just need good grades from undergrad to get in.  My wife has a master's degree in foreign relations.  We are now close to middle age and are at the apex in our careers, and I guess you could say we are approaching the 1%.  I pay a *metric fuck ton* in taxes. I am not some evil rich guy looking to screw fellow people in the middle class.  All I did was get an education, worked my way up, and overtime climbed the corporate ladder.  It will happen to many of you as you get older.  Same for my wife.  Yes, we have a healthy bank account and investment savings.  No debt.  But I felt that we worked hard to get to where we are today, by studying hard in school and constantly keeping our skills up-to-date.  I have a feeling that many people confuse who makes up the 1% versus the billionaire/millionaire oligarchs who avoid far more taxes than people in the 1% do.  Would you consider your doctor or a physician who saved your life to be an jerkwad because they are in the 1%? The 1% contains  a lot of your upper middle class people who do white collar work or who have started their own small businesses."

No one should be paying 1.8% fees in a 401k.  Period.  Contribute the bare minimum you need to get the match and invest in an IRA on your own instead (which you can set up to be tax deferred if you wish).  I'd also lobby HR to take a look and get rid of the company running the plan and look for a different company with much lower fees. If you aren't attached to the company, I'd even look for another job with better benefits. If you start maxing out your IRA and need more room to invest, you could start investing in your 401k, then do a yearly roll over to your IRA if it is allowed to avoid those ridiculous admin fees.

todayilearned,fdashiv,t3_ekdvsr,1578249527.0,"I honestly believe that a ton of it has to do with simple variance between labs and skill levels between researchers. Yes, there is outright fraud is science, but IMO, I think a lot of non-reproducibility comes down to reasons that are not malevolent. Why can't bakers and people who cook at home exactly reproduce the same quality of recipe when given the same exact ingredients to work with? It's because there's all sorts of other variables involved from the person's skill who is doing the cooking to slight variations in ovens, temperature of the room during baking, or even how long someone has allowed an ingredient like baking soda to sit out (which absorbs water from the atmosphere). Same can be said when it comes to doing experiments.

I once sat through a presentation from a researcher from NIST who performed a study where they gave the same exact lot of cells to labs across the country. Each lab was given the same exact set of chemicals to test on the cells for toxicity under the same exact protocols. The results NIST got back for toxicity testing had wild variance, sometimes differences by almost an order of magnitude from certain labs. If professional researchers at universities can't replicate a very, verrrrrrry simple cellular toxicity assay, how in the world is science that is much more complicated that involves protocols that can take over year long with a hundreds of different steps ever hoped to be repeatable? In the end, the NIST researcher found that by using a zig-zagging pipetting technique across the cell culture plate to add the chemicals you were able to significantly reduce variance in the results. But in no way was it obvious that you should be using a zig-zagging technique to make your results more reproducible.

The other reason is more philosophical and that has been argued over for a looooooooooooong time in academic literature. That's the mindless and stupid use of p-values to establish statistical significance. Journals and reviewers will not allow you to publish results unless they are 'statistically significant'. Yet, I bet if you polled scientists, the vast majority of them would struggle to answer what 'statistical significance' even means. The problem is that you can have statistically significant changes in something that have very little quantitative differences or biological meaning. There are camps of people who think we need to get rid of the concept of p-values all together, or use a cut-off of a p-value that is much more rigorous (say going from p<0.05 to a p<.01). I tend to agree. What also contributes to the lack of reproducibility is when you read about things that are 'significant' yet have small quantitative changes. For example, trying to replicate work that showed that protein X decreased by 1.2-fold relative to a control (while statistically significant at a p<.05) is going to be super difficult if you're doing something like say a western blot. We should be requiring journals to ask for results that are much more robust. Don't even report results unless there is something like at least a 2-fold change or greater, for example. There should be more emphasis on the robustness and biological significance of results more so than mindlessly plugging away to achieve 'statistical significance'. This latter problem is much harder to address and dislodge from the scientific community, however. It requires a complete shift in philosophy from the ENTIRE global scientific community.  There should also be emphasis on creating *protocols and methods* that are easy to reproduce.  If you can only get your results to reproduce on a certain instrument with a few custom tweaks that are hard to replicate, well, what good is that?"

Nothing looks worse when a bank underwrites an IPO and the same firm's analysts trash the stock with a a HOLD or a SELL rating.   So much conflict of interest.  You have to be extremely cautious when reading analysts' reports and recommendations...too often its impossible to determine how much they've been influenced by outside forces that pressure them to write a good review.

investing,fd02erp,t1_fczyzrs,1578112636.0,"IMO, a lot of the theory is a waste of time for a small time investor.  I am by no means a mathematical slouch (BS in math, PhD engineering), but models are always only as good as the info that gets put into it.  I've taken classes before on how to build DCFs, econometrics and forecasting, monte carlo methods, and advanced stats, but in the end I think Ben Graham and Warren Buffet are right when they claim they've really never needed to do any math or theory beyond arithmetic and simple algebra to be successful investors.  I sure as hell don't bust out DCFs for every single stock pick.  And I'd also just like to point out that stock picking makes up only a very small fraction of my portfolio, the majority of my investiments (>90%) are held in boring ass index funds. Applying advanced theory to stocks feels academic and 'smart', but in the end even wall street bros with the greatest financial math minds on the street and the best super computing tech have a hard time beating a simple index fund - I mean the S&P 500 returned something absurd like 28% this year with zero brains needed to partake in that action.  Spend more time reading about the history of the stock market than on theory, imo.  

If you're still adamant about theory, pick up any book on financial mathematics.  Any intro book should cover the Black-Scholes equation for evaluating options pricing and describe derivatives.  My favorite intro to finance math book is *An Undergraduate Introduction to Financial Mathematics* by Dr. Buchanan. If you are a glutton for punishment, you can always go to your local public university for free and access articles from *The Journal of Finance* for fun. 

For terms and definitions, a book like *The Interpretation of Financial Statements* by Ben Graham is literally a book filled with terms and explanations only and is meant to be a reference book.  You can also pick up any used intro to finance and intro to corporate finance textbook from Ebay for learning additional terminology. Don't spend lots of money on new textbooks, buy old ones, because terms haven't changed much in decades. 

Finally, don't get paralysis from analysis.  You should also spend more time learning about the mathematics of personal finance and about interest rates than on esoteric concepts like Black-Scholes and other modern advanced modeling techniques.  The former will impact your life a helluva a lot more than forecasting mathematics for stocks that will fail 95% of the time, because everyday banks charge you interest on your home, your car, or a student loan.  If you have no idea what an APR is, how to calculate an amortization schedule for a mortgage, how to calculate the future and present values of money, or how annuity payments work, you need to spend more time on basic personal finance mathematics than worrying about topics like options pricing modeling that will affect your life far less. When you go into a car dealership and they offer you a 1% APR with $10k up front and 5 years worth of payments or a 2% APR with $0 down and 6 years of payments, you want to be able to know which one is the better deal for you.  That's much more important to learn."

Also throw in 2-4% transaction costs and you get priced out to death even when you make six figure incomes.

Then in retirement you can move to a low or 0% income tax state.  Moving to a low or zero income tax state helps you avoid huge amounts of taxes that can be diverted into investing right away. Seniors move to Florida, for example, for more than just the weather.  If you use after tax money to contribute to Roth accounts, you'll have to pay local and state taxes and lose the option to move to a state later on to avoid decades worth of taxes. Many people live in high tax areas of the country.

MD Anderson recently had a high profile case of Chinese espionage trying to steal academic research.

Sure, universities running on Federal dollars generate data that is published to the public, but they're allowed to also capitalize commercially on their discoveries and to patent them. See The Bayh Dole Act that has allowed it for decades."

personalfinance,fccut8r,t3_eh2ny8,1577602895.0,"Investing in funds or individual stocks that pay dividends would be annoying to have to pay taxes on if you use a regular brokerage account.  You also don't have to immediately pay capital gains taxes if you invest in the IRA off you sell a stock for profit.  If you move in retirement to a state with low or zero income taxes you can completely avoid paying state income taxes on your capital gains once you make an ira withdrawal in retirement, which is a pretty big advantage off you live in a high tax state in your prime earning years.  If you have a taxable brokerage account you'll have to pay state income taxes in gains.  We live in a high tax state but will retire in Texas, Pennsylvania, or Florida for that very reason....to save on decades of tax bites from a high tax state."

LifeProTips,fca3yog,t3_egs81p,1577562732.0,"Constantly keep dibs on any universities near you. Foreign grad students about to graduate are often excellent targets to buy a used car from, because they'll often be desperate to leave the country ASAP and will need to ditch as many possessions as possible.  If their visas are about to run out you can get a car from them at a great price.  

Always avoid dealerships to the extent possible.  Sure, it's more risk buying from an individual directly, but it can save you tons of money."

The reason is that you have to pay lots of taxes for every new dollar you make with side jobs that eat up all of your free time, while if you just focused on killing debt and budgeting more, you can keep more of your take home pay tax free. Second, focus on your career or finding a better job. It's almost always easier and better to upgrade to a new job or develop your career better to advance faster and higher than it is trying to eek out a side job that'll fit into your schedule. Ask for a pay raise too if you feel underpaid, don't be afraid to get aggressive.  Finally, if you've already done the first two and are 1000% convinced that you need a side job then by all means do it."

The pension system in Illinois, for example, is completely bankrupting the state, and they'll almost have to reform it and cut benefits.  Play it more conservatively like you aren't even expecting a pension.

Yes, by avoiding taxes on your growth, you'll be blowing away what you could earn in a taxable account.  In fact, owning dividend paying indexes can be a major pain in a taxable account because you'll have to file taxes on dividends all the time.  But if your index is in a tax sheltered account, you won't have to bother.  

Even if your choices are limited in the 403b, you'll prob be able to pick something easy like a low cost lifecycle fund or a stock fund. That should be good enough.  Taxes can take huuuuuge bites out of your growth over the long haul.  You need to avoid them at all costs."
