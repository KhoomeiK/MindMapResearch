CPTSD,ffbngmh,t3_esjrt3,1579774192.0,I relate so hard to this. Thank you for sharing.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbncmh,t1_ffbn3tz,1579774026.0,"I'm just trying to educate people how easy it is for a baby to suffocate. It is a concerning image no matter how long he was like that. He really shouldn't have been left like that for any length of time. 
Edit: [Please educate yourselves.](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/news/20141013/sleeping-on-sofa-can-be-deadly-for-babies-study-finds) I personally know people whose child suffocated on a couch. It's dangerous."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbmx0b,t1_ffb5veb,1579773355.0,You shouldn't lay a baby on a couch unsupervised for any length of time. The suffocation statistics are not something to ignore. I'd be lying if I wasn't immediately concerned when I saw the baby laying on its side on a couch! Babies should be laid to sleep on their back on a flat surface without a pillow or blanket until eighteen months.
SiestaKeyMTV,ffbmo4o,t1_ffb0zzu,1579772976.0,"Um..no. Chloe is an antagonist. She oversteps her boundaries. She thrives off of being ""right"". That's why people have a problem with her. She's a bully."
SiestaKeyMTV,ffbmj2v,t1_ffawkdl,1579772757.0,"That's actually assault and means you hit her first. If someone puts their hand in your face, you walk away. Getting aggressive in return is asking for them to assault you. Not that it gives them the right, I'm just saying that you're escalating the situation by putting your hands on them first."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbm69o,t1_ffbiu6a,1579772209.0,Same. I had an IUD years ago and it wasn't painful. I felt the tiniest cramp when they placed it and that was it. It did fall out after like a year I think.
SiestaKeyMTV,ffbm0hc,t3_eskwbl,1579771962.0,"I don't understand how he has so many friends that are girls. Not because of his looks or personality or anything (although some might say that is also a mystery) but just, how do you have so many friends? How can any of the time you spend with people be quality and meaningful when you're constantly with SO many different people. It's hard for me to understand. Maybe because in my town we literally had a click of like ten of us that grew up together. It was the crew until high school and we branched off but yeah. I just dont understand how he has these bonds with so many women."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbkh50,t1_ffb0l68,1579769618.0,She comes by it honestly. I admire her commitment to it. I dont have that much confidence in anything I do. I find a unique beauty in it.
survivorsofabuse,ffbkc45,t3_esfo5d,1579769415.0,"I'm curious what you think brought it on and what commentary are you feeding to sustain it, if any?"
CPTSD,ff9106k,t3_es9yg6,1579702116.0,"Omg yes. If I feel like someone is going to feel something for me, I'll say something stupid to try and distract them. Or if I say something that provokes feeling of care or concern, I'll immediately follow it up with down playing it or brushing it off and try to change the subject in the least obvious way. Also, my entire conversations with people have a backdrop or underlying feeling of ""please dont care about me"". Honestly, I should dive into this but I am afraid to. I feel like I've been an asshole because of my fear of people caring about me. I feel so screwed up. Thank you for posting this. This is something I've felt completely alone experiencing because I feel like I never meet people who have this fear. Do you? I feel like I never see anyone with the same defense mechanisms or behaviors or manipulations even that surround this fear. It seems like ""care"" is a natural thing that everyone experiences, meanwhile I have not only a fear, but a deep sense of being unworthy and undeserving of it. I feel like I am doing others a favor by keeping them from caring about me. Isn't that like martyrdom? It's obviously not on purpose. I feel so ashamed."
CatsWhoSqueak,ff8zw7k,t1_ff8wih6,1579701242.0,"This might sound silly, but I dont think I have seen a long haired black cat before. She looks soft and snuggly. I got my first medium haired tabby a few years ago and I'm in absolute love. He is so soft and cuddly and he smells so good all the time. I dont know how he does it. It's the weirdest thing how he can smell like flowers all the time. My short haired tabby is soft too but not as soft as my medium haired. And he somehow smells like the litterbox and he grooms more than the medium hair! I wonder if other peoples floofs smell good too. Maybe it gets more air flow? Still doesnt explain how he smells good though. Anyway, sorry to blab, I just love kitties! I wish I could pet that baby!"

I'm now 35 and still haven't quite found my joy although I feel it is around the corner. It took exponentially longer than I had originally thought, but I also didnt realize how damaged I was. It took a while to first realize that I hadn't yet found the bottom, and then to hit the bottom. I keep questioning myself, ""when do I get to live for the first time?"" You sharing this genuinely gives me hope and helps me feel less alone and I appreciate it."

My point for commenting was to educate that as neat as this image looks, it is still a big struggle for people with these injuries as I am sure you know."

I just want to share that it is possible to improve this as I know how miserable it is. I'd reccomend the most helpful and compassionate book I've ever read, ""Whole Again"" by Jackson Mackenzie.

AbuseInterrupted,feefzop,t3_eoqjpw,1579032982.0,"Well, it could also be you're not thinking about it the right way. A shift in perspective or coming at it from another angle can change your feelings about it.

In fact: I'd venture to say it can be toxic to spread this because for a long time I believed I wasnt accepting something when it came to things i wrestled with. I came to find out it was the way I was thinking about it that caused me pain. I needed more context, a broader frame of reference, a greater understanding to release the feelings. Just dont spend your time trying to figure out what you're not accepting because that may not be the problem."

It takes time to train your brain to focus in a way that causes you to be grateful. I reccomend a Gratitude journal. Write down 3-5 things that you are grateful for every evening. Challenge yourself to not repeat things. Give it two-three weeks and I'm sure you'll notice your mood is elevated, you're more content and appreciative of the little things!"

Jigsawpuzzles,fe6sly2,t3_enwkpw,1578903459.0,"Hey! I love seeing another puzzle nerd find their love for puzzles! I'm happy for you. I just started this hobby about a year ago and I am also hooked. As for your questions.. Some of my favorite puzzles I will flip over and tape with masking tape or painters tape and use bulldog clips to hang them up. I havent taken any apart yet after taping but I've heard it doesn't damage the integrity of the puzzle. If you're intrested, there is one youtuber named ""Karen Puzzles"" who covers many puzzle topics. I haven't found any other channels that arent just of people puzzling, so if anyone knows of any other channels, I'd be interested. She actually helped me understand that it's ok and even fun to take the puzzle apart. Silly, I know, but before I had like ten completely puzzles stacked up around my house. 
I was also blown away with Ravensburger the first time I did one. But I think you'll find yourself liking more companies as you try them. I like Galison a lot, but unfortunately, I've found that some of the pieces end up with minor damage just in transport. Currently my favorite puzzle company is Heye. The way the pieces fit together is so satisfying. People have all sorts of preferences it seems. One of my least favorite is White Mountain but that is quite a fews most favorite. If you can afford it, Artifact might be cool to check out. It's completely unique to your typical jigsaw puzzle. I love your idea of making an album. I hear direct sunlight is the best way to photograph puzzles. Otherwise, make sure there isn't light pointed directly at the puzzle or you'll get a glare. I find photographing them to be the hardest part, but I also live in a dimly lit apartment. Anyway, hope some of this helps and I look forward to seeing your posts!"

AskReddit,fe29sro,t3_eng8y5,1578836003.0,"Don't have sex with someone just to ""get experience"". Don't sleep with your best friend just so you're not a virgin anymore. I really wouldn't reccomend it. Your first time will always be your first time, you should probably do it with someone you care about and want to actually have a relationship with. Experience isn't so much about how many partners you've had. It's about how much you listen to the partner you have, the connection you share, the exploration you do together. The worst lays are hookup kings/queens. They never learned how to have fun. It's all about cumming. Sex is fun and completely natural and the more you stay out of your mind, the more fun you're going to have. Remember that it isn't about cumming, it's about physically enjoying each other. It isn't about a means to an end but a total experience."

He choked me twice in a row. He grabbed me so hard I thought he was going to break my neck. I felt my eyes pop out. He said, ""I should fucking kill you."" As soon as he let go, I left immediately but we got back together a few weeks later. He acted like it never happened and would say it didn't happen. He never admitted it. I could tell he was trying to make me doubt that it happened but it didnt work. Man. It's just wild how similar the behaviors are. I'm sorry you had to go through it.

CatfishTheTVShow,fdneuav,t1_fdmzl3g,1578584300.0,"The catfish apologized, Kamie said ""me too"". Her and Red exchanging glances was so rude. Imo, they didnt give her a chance. It's also rude to claim I am shitting on her and/or calling my POV silly. Shitting on someone would be calling them a bitch or degrading them. I'm only stating that I saw her behavior as disrespectful. I don't shit on people. Just because I am disappointed in the way she handled herself doesnt mean I think she is shit. In fact, I am pretty sure that I already stated I thought she was the best choice for cohost. I would have liked to see more of an effort from her like in previous episodes. Seems to me she got stuck in her feelings and that's a bad look for anyone."
CatfishTheTVShow,fdmygdm,t1_fdmy6gk,1578571324.0,"She was being honest at the table about how many profiles she had and Kamie started with the attitude over it and the catfish gave it back. My impression was the catfish came to the table with an openness and Kamie carried in resentment from the previous day. Everyone has their own interpretation, but that was mine. Sure. Nev and Max have shown that they were angry. But show me where the blatantly called anyone a name. They weren't bullies. Showing anger is healthy. Name calling is childish and in her case, hypocritical. If you read my comments from 4 days ago, I was all about Kamie from what I saw in previous episodes, but she let me down in this new one. That's how i feel."
CatfishTheTVShow,fdmxxln,t1_fdmxi4p,1578570737.0,"I disagree. Kamie is older and in a position of authority. She should be setting the example. Also, it's the golden rule, ""treat people the way you want to be treated"" it doesnt say, ""treat people the way you want to be treated unless they are disrespectful."" If you want to have an impact, be the example. I think this is the first time that I know of where they didnt get the catfish to take down their profile. Kamie and Red shooting looks back and forth when the Catfish was being honest was soo childish. Man I am disappointed in her. I really thought she'd do a better job. She did better on other episodes. This episode was a train wreck. Makes me miss Max in a big way. I sincerely hope they have better luck helping people and this episode is just growing pains."
CatfishTheTVShow,fdmsenw,t1_fdmawn0,1578563457.0,"Ok, but they're there to help people, like Nev had to remind Kamie. I'm disappointed with her hypocrisy and her getting in her feelings. She tells the catfish not to call her a bitch and then calls the catfish a bitch. I've seen Kamie be sweet and supportive so her behavior this episode was surprising. I'm hoping it is a blip and she recovers nicely. It is possible to not take anyone's shit AND be respectful. One doesnt negate the other."
