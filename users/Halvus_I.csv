Edit: Specifically, Penal Code 837 authorized citizen's arrests in California if you observe someone commit a misdemeanor, or if you are aware of someone committing a felony. You are allowed to use only the force necessary to detain the person temporarily until the authorities arrive and take custody of the arrestee.

todayilearned,ff3y092,t1_ff3wr2c,1579551318.0,"> the DOE is required to prove that spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste would be safely stored at Yucca Mountain for 10,000 years. However, in July 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. vacated the EPA's 10,000 year standard. The State of Nevada had filed suit against the EPA, saying the 10,000 year period was both insufficient and illegal. The EPA had been required by law to base the safety standard on the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. The Academy, however, said the radiation safety standard should be set when the waste would be at its peak radiation levels - at least 300,000 years from the time the waste is sent to Yucca. The Court upheld Nevada's claim, ruling that the EPA deliberately rejected the National Academy of Sciences' recommendation. The EPA must promulgate another rule, or Congress must pass legislation to allow the 10,000 year standard.
