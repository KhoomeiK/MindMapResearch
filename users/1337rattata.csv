Music,feyuxr6,t3_eqrr70,1579450840.0,"When I was young, my dad put this on and told me to count the number of times he said ""I know."" I remember listening so closely trying to make sure I didn't miss one utterance, then all of a sudden there was a barrage of them."
aww,feyr0xh,t1_feyphix,1579449528.0,"I've actually never heard of that, I wonder if your area has a particularly bad problem with it and so does it preemptively?

 I do cat fostering and have had probably 200+ cats fixed, never gotten the vaccine done though I always recommend it for adopters if the cat is going to be indoor/outdoor or outdoor only. I've had maybe 100 of them tested for FeLV/FIV and have been fortunate enough to only have one FeLV+. FeLV is a horrific disease. :( Wish people would keep their cats indoors, you hear a lot about how good it is for wildlife, and of course it is, but diseases like FeLV are nothing to play around with."
aww,feyfqff,t1_fey5i0b,1579444897.0,"When it comes to pets that have literally 0% chance of getting the disease (they don't door dash and are 100% indoor), yeah. I do yearly distemper vaccines and a yearly rabies shot as it's required by law where I live and needed to see a vet, but I'm not going to vaccinate them against something that they have next to no chance of getting."
aww,feyf25e,t1_feybh8k,1579444628.0,"I mean, I'm not really sure how it is misinformation when it's a fact that approximately 1 in 10,000 injection sites result in sarcoma. Happened to a cat my family had in childhood. It's not a definite or really likely, of course, but it's completely impossible for a cat living in a home with only FeLV- cats to get the disease assuming it doesn't get outside, so to me, it's an unnecessary risk to give them the vaccine. If my cats were bad about door dashing and likely to get out, I would weigh the sarcoma risk against the the odds of them getting outside and use my best judgment."
aww,feyd3d6,t1_fey01ld,1579443975.0,"I would personally not if it was my cat, but be aware that if she were to get out and you have a high population of feral cats in your area, there is a chance she could come back with FeLV or FIV. It spreads through mating or deep bite wounds. I'd definitely speak to your vet about the prevalence of the diseases in your area and also use your best judgement as to the likelihood of her escaping from the leash/harness."
aww,fexxypj,t1_fexw7l7,1579438136.0,"The leukemia vaccine has a risk of cancer developing at the injection site, so a lot of people only get it for outdoor cats. I don't personally give it to my indoor ones."
tifu,fek45go,t1_fek3gu6,1579192218.0,"My grandpa passed several years ago and I'm actually going to visit this weekend to help out with cleaning my grandma's house so she can move into a nursing home, thinking of her in her wilder days brought a smile to my face (though it was definitely incredibly cringey as a teenager at Thanksgiving).

There was one time that she said, referring to my sister who was home for college with her long time boyfriend (both sitting at the table) ""she must give awfully good head for him to put up with her attitude.""

Good times, good times."
tifu,fejsizk,t1_fejns8v,1579184782.0,Your grandma sounds like mine!! My grandparents were truck drivers in the early 90s and would often start telling stories in the middle of holiday gatherings about how they would meet up with swingers at various truck stops and trade partners for the night.
