Though it had a bit of a downturn lately, opinions of leftwing government is stronger than it has been in a long time and I think the NDP will do well in the next provincial election. They got more than 1/3 of the last one and won the one before. And seeing as how unemployment is at an unprecedented all time high in Alberta, the province swinging 10% more towards the right [60% to 70% of the popular vote], who they view as the only ones who care about Alberta, is hardly surprising.

>During that same time the bankruptcy rate in Alberta's economy rose by 150% after the NEP took effect: despite those years being amongst the most expensive for oil prices on record.

>Given that bankruptcies and real estate prices did not fare as negatively in Central Canada as in the rest of Canada and the United States during the NEP, it is possible that the NEP had a positive effect in Central Canada.

>Furthermore, given that bankruptcies and real estate:6 did much worse in Alberta than in other parts of Canada and the United States, petroleum exporting economies like Norway performed well, coupled with the estimated loss of between $50 and $100 billion in provincial GDP (at the time, this was an entire year's GDP for the province) due to the NEP during this period, it is possible that the NEP had a negative effect in Alberta."
