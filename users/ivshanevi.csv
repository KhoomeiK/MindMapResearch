ffxiv,ff7mzf4,t1_ff4zd66,1579653421.0,">People toss around the excuse that a content drought means we should have an overwhelming abundance of fanart, but somehow WoW's subreddit, which arguably suffers from the same content lapses doesn't have this consistent problem.

WoWs subreddit, at least when I visit it, is very balanced between in-game discussion, meta discussion, art work, and memeing. Something to consider though is that WoWs main subreddit has 1 million more followers and, also, has a broader range and more reasonable mods than FFXIVs (I assume).

I too have personally stopped visiting the reddit on the regular. When 90 out of 100 posts you see are ""so proud of this g-pose"" to ""had my character commissioned"" to ""me and my fiances cosplay"" it just starts to get super annoying. Fuckin people are just so self-obsessed in this game. I came to the reddit to see posts about the game, not about some rando and his gf cosplaying."

I understand that we don't need 3 pages for a resume, hell even 2 pages at a time might be too much. But I don't know how to shorten it down. For the most part, say when I am applying for a C/C++ position, I usually get rid of all the course work except for thing like my C++, compiler, and DB course. Even doing this, I still have 2 pages. Should I just scrap all the things I did in the course and just state I took the course? I also read it might be a good idea to drop the years I have been working in an environment seeing as Uni years using them doesn't translate well. Should I also put my small business down as work experience? I really haven't done anything outside of make a business website... I don't have barely any work or internship experience either which hurts alot...

I absolutely love this game and love what they have done this league, but I died 4 times last night simply due to fps stutter. 

If you watch Quin69s most recent rip, (think !rip12) he gets hit for 5.5k+ with 4x pots activated while playing a Pathfinder. Can LUL him all you wan't, but when you watch the replay there is literally 0 telegraph, no counter play could be done.

> What I still don't get is this: how do I avoid 1-hit deaths?. I would love to learn what killed me and how it killed me. Was it chaos? Was it fire? Was it bleeding? How can I know that? 

Chris was asked point blank if they would ever put in a death recap, and he essentially said, ""fuck no"". He said due to information that would be detailed would be too much of a burden, but I honestly think it is because there are more BS mechs occurring than we think.

> How do you guys deal with these kind of situations?

cscareerquestions,feek59i,t1_feddqba,1579035385.0,">... and all you have to lose is time 

I have to highly disagree, you lose money too, and lots of it with that mentality. Just trying to find what ""looks"" good is where you lose the money. Blackjack and Roulette looks like the best chance to win against the house, but your best bet is usually Craps (from my understanding sitting at a 45:55 house favor). Same works for poker, hands that ""look"" good are the best bait, and where you lose most of your money.

I can see this being related over to hiring practices too. You guys, no doubt on the frequent, skim over really good candidates because their resumes don't ""look"" good, but would hire a sociopath liar who spent more time on his resume than anything else related to his degree. Some students from my program, I know would hardcore cheat on assignments and tests, but damn did their Linkedin, Resumes, and Cover Letters look snazzzzzzy.

But, what do I know, while I am still here looking for a job and they are working."

Thats... trolling on a wholenother level.

Or it's also cause he really eggs and provokes his twitch chat on. 

I personally was in the same boat when I started watching him during his D3 days. He seemed like one of those annoying ass, loud, twitch streamers, which he  is, but what you always see is just the rage clips, the 10 seconds in a 36,000 second stream."
