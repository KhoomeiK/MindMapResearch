AstralProjection,ffapxhn,t3_esc62x,1579741735.0,"Have you come at it as a physical issue? Your pineal gland or the third eye is found deep within your brain and it calcifies over time. Within a month of talking boron supplements I had my first lucid dream. The kind where when you think about the dream later and you can feel the same emotion you felt within the dream. Which for me was pure joy and happiness. If that is what people feel when they have near death OBE’s I can understand why they don’t want to return to their bodies. The feeling is that good.

There are YouTube videos on using boron to decalcify your pineal gland. I suggest you start with that."

That’s my litmus test for what is truly top talent.
But I want to decide that, I don’t want to see an artist claim top talent. It’s super cringey and I get second hand embarrassment sometimes. Like with the monster mug post...yikes.

aww,fen86yn,t1_fek71f5,1579279094.0,"My doggie looks exactly like your doggie! I got mine when he was 4 weeks old and had to feed him with a dropper. He doesn’t leave my side because he lost his doggie friend recently and his personality has changed. I really think he is depressed. He is acting depressed anyway. 

So my intent is to get him a little friend, maybe a kitten/cat. Do you or anyone out there on Reddit land have any experience with Westies and cats? I googled but it wasn’t that helpful."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,feln7zi,t1_felie1q,1579226214.0,Thank you so much and you are most welcome. I understand and wish you well friend.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fel50ot,t1_fekne4p,1579214197.0,"Yes it gets better. Dec 21st was my 2 years sober date for drugs and alcohol. Every day you get just a little bit better. Every week you are stronger than the last. 

Withdrawals are what kept me addicted for over 15 years. After a year clean (1 year ago) I became a group leader for an Addiction Recovery Program. I lead 5 meetings a week and work full time. 

You CAN do this. I wanted to kill myself too. The pain, physically and emotionally was horrible. The embarrassment,no money. Been there my dude. 

BUT, it gets better and then you keep pushing forward, even if it’s just a little bit every day and one day you’ll look around and you’re happy again. You have that inward motivation to do things, that drive you were born with. 

You start to give back. You will get online and reach out to someone suffering because you know, you understand. 

My advice is to get yourself into a 12 Step program. Drag your tired ass to a meeting. Cause you will be tired. But you can do it. They will help you and you will one day be able to help others. 

You CAN do this. You can be happy again. You can get back your energy again. Peace and good thoughts to you my friend."
