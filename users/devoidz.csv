The main character can talk to dead people.  There are necromancers in the story,  but they are almost an opposite.  Two sides of the same coin. 

The good one is able to raise the dead and have them fight for him. But they do it more because they want to,  than he is making them do it.  First time it happens his step dad is trying to kill him.  He confronted him for killing his mom.  His mom comes up out of the river she drowned in and kills the step dad.

Those entries do show up in reports.  The department manager gets a list of them, and is supposed to check them. It shows who did it,  when,  and all info entered.  If someone is doing it too much,  or for some weird amounts they might investigate it.  A manager that did that to change the price of a computer to about 1/3 of the price got caught, and fired.

Only you, or someone you told would know how to get to them. 

There are other locks, physical key locks, or finger scanners. But The key can easily be copied, finger scanner might not work if you need it to. And you want to be able to get to it fast if someone is in your house.

Then expect you to give it a glowing 5 star review. I tend to be honest though. I have a few tines told the company I was just not going to leave a review because it didn't, or wouldn't work. If I can't make at least a neutral comment, I give them the option of no comment, or negative. Most of the things on there are wish quality. Almost as seen on tv quality. I usually use it for things to play with, or things that you can't really fuck up. Like I just bought 100 tulip bulbs for $2. I can't imagine they would be too messed up. I got a solar charger for a cell phone once, it overheated and I thought my phone was going to catch fire. I've gotten several lights, they came out ok. Most things you can tell by looking at it if it is crap or not."

offbeat,fdn3cgz,t1_fdmgyym,1578576069.0,"I feel the same way. 

I have a cousin that is constantly posting gun stuff, 2nd amendment, they are coming for your guns shit. He doesn't see a reason to try to at least limit what people can get their hands on, because criminals will get them anyways. Well if you make it harder to get, then there will be less around, and less for the criminals to get.

Then he goes into the but I'm not a criminal. Yeah well neither are these school shooters until they pick up their Dad's legal gun and go on a shooting spree. I know a lot of gun owners, and less than half of them are responsible. My Dad thought he was responsible. I could have grabbed a pump 12 gauge, loaded it, and been on my way any time I wanted, it was hanging on a wall. I'll whip your ass if you touch my gun, is not being responsible. 

I'm not afraid of the guy on Tremors, I'm more afraid of lazy people that won't lock up, or store their stuff properly."

buildapcsales,fdn1dmk,t1_fdlh68p,1578574298.0,Or it was stolen.  It's probably either stolen or lost in the store.  Things like mice come in break packs. Big boxes of random shit.  They work them and put the over stock in the back. They are dragged out and reworked every so often.  They could be in one of those in the stock room.  Don't ask they won't look for you.  They will go in the back for 5 to 10 minutes and chill then tell you they don't have it.  Or if it was a really bad seller it might have ended up in a trailer in the outside storage. They damn sure aren't going out there.

Still an idiot though."
walmart,fdmzbrb,t1_fdms999,1578572275.0,"We have the quick assist buttons all over the store.  If you push one to quickly,  like most customers do, it says quick assist reset.  For a few months I swear it was saying book of stamps, reset. People pound on that button like it's going to give them money."
