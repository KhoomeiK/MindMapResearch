relationships,ff89ozl,t1_ff88ui5,1579670154.0,"I absolutely agree that he may need the friendship, or a similar support structure, as he heals. I feel like the strongest foundation would come from keeping in mind the emotional needs of both. If either of them are feeling like they're not being seen, it'll make it harder to make anything work. I don't know whether he needs to let the friendship go or not, but I feel like they need to talk about each of their feelings about it to figure it out. That's why I hoped that pointing out where her feelings might help; I hope that things can be talked out if they understand where the other might be coming from."

relationships,ff7xzn0,t1_ff7wvyr,1579661035.0,"Here's my thought on the phrase- She's said, ""it's this or I'm out."" Not, ""This friendship makes me feel like you're not committed to us,"" not, ""Let's talk about why this is uncomfortable."" I think an ultimatum indicates that she's unwilling to get into the emotional details & just wants things on her terms.

I'm not saying the friendship must, or even should, remain. When I commented, a lot of people were saying that she shouldn't get to say anything because she cheated, so I was saying this to say- let's consider that this might feel like a real threat to moving on without having the same level of threat for him. But I also got the impression that she didn't want to have a real conversation about it, which to me is troubling- it feels more like a ransom to me if she's not willing to have that talk, & instead is just trying to cut it off. 

I agree with you- they should both commit if they're going to make it work. I just don't know that that's inconsistent with what I'm saying either."

I agree with what you said at the end & how you put it- she's holding the relationship ransom to get what she wants. I just feel like it's worth pointing this guilt aspect as a potential part of why she's upset about this- maybe it could affect how OP wants to address it."

His responsibility, she did it. Honestly if he was perfectly capable of writing the cover letter, doing the interview prep, etc without her, it's worse that he had her spend her time & energy on it without thanks, imo. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt that he was busy or just bad at that stuff. But sure, man, go off I guess"

relationships,fendg17,t1_fenaw08,1579282320.0,"You've come into multiple comment threads mad about this. And you can say you're not mad, but you're being really rude to people who disagree with you, which is how people act when they're mad, so if you're not mad then maybe act accordingly. 

This is my take, for what it's worth- He has probably gone to school & worked in the field, but from his behavior I am certain he had help with parts of that he didn't want to do. She says he needed a new job, which to me indicates that he wanted to have a different job, but it looks like he needed her help to follow through. Writing a good cover letter usually takes longer than 15 min, especially if it's not your experience you're writing about- it would've been easier for him, as the person who knows about the position, unless she already manages stuff like this for him all the time. Which, unfortunately, is a pattern in relationships all the time- one person ends up as the ""executive assistant"" of the relationship.

He couldn't have done it without the things he asked her to do; ergo, this couldn't have happened without her contribution. She did him a favor, & he appears to feel that that isn't enough- that more of her day should still revolve around him. He's being selfish, and the right thing to do here is to be grateful. Argue for a middle ground, sure, but to just be angry to people saying she did something that isn't her responsibility is not a great approach."
relationships,fenc4dp,t3_epzxh2,1579281512.0,"I'm wondering if he has Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria? I'm not trying to do an armchair diagnosis, I just noticed how much help OP was giving him, & it sounds like some of the ways people sometimes help partners with ADHD, which comes with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria in lots of cases. It may be worth looking into if he has ADHD.

Obviously that's not an excuse for treating OP poorly. But if he does act like this because he's oversensitive to rejection, it may be a way for him to address that kind of behavior.

Best of luck with all of it, OP."

I honestly turn back to the book from her advice column, Tiny Beautiful things, every year or so. I'm a fan of the advice column form (weird, I know) especially when it's turned on its head; she never makes herself out to be an all-knowing expert or removes herself emotionally. Reading it can be an experience. TW for a lot of rough content- people don't write an advice column because things are rosy, & she doesn't present a rosy life herself. But the way things are handled helps."

I don't know what happened in your life to make you believe that this is some kind of Truth, but you're wrong. And you're wrong in a hurtful way. I know that telling you this is pointless, but in case anyone else out there is wondering- being bisexual means you're attracted to people of any gender. That is all it means. It doesn't mean you can't control your attraction, it doesn't mean you're attracted to everybody, it doesn't even always mean you want to date or have sex with people regardless of gender. And it doesn't mean you're automatically a cheater.

You're looking at a friendly, outgoing person, & are convinced that she's cheating because she... let someone compliment her? Hugs people? Come on.

You should apologize to your friend for trying to manipulate his girlfriend & throwing accusations around. And then you should distance yourself from them, because you clearly cannot control your prejudice. And then you should try to figure out where that prejudice came from & how to make it stop."

One of Jen Hatmaker's books might be good, too, if that's a style you like (look to her Facebook for a feel for her if you'd like). 

A more obscure option- that's a) pretty historical, & b) not overt in that it's essentially feminist satire- would be Herland. Totally underrated because everyone looks at Yellow Wallpaper by the same author instead. For a WASPy women's group it might be a perfect entry- level for questioning beliefs & society.

relationship_advice,fcnsk3p,t1_fcnr4pd,1577817604.0,"You were stating that the bf & anyone else shouldn't have to believe that someone was raped unless it was proved in a court of law.
A) Most rapes are never proven in a court of law. If a court can't prove that someone murdered someone else, does that somehow obligate everyone to treat someone they know murdered someone as if they hadn't? That's a ludicrous idea. People are allowed to act on information they know to be true even if a court hasn't proven it- the court just determines legal responsibility.
B) If her boyfriend truly believes that she'd lie about his friend raping her, SOMETHING is DEEPLY WRONG in the relationship. Hell, who would be in a relationship with someone they'd think is lying about that? No one. He doesn't believe she's lying.
C) As she explains, he's not actually saying he doesn't believe that she was raped in a situation involving his friend. The thing he can't seem to do is reconcile that his friend is a rapist, despite knowing that he is the person who raped someone. I guess because the guy never raped the bf he just can't picture the guy as a rapist? It's cognitive dissonance he's refusing to address within himself, & it's hurting OP."
