Maher,ffa1n6p,t3_esgvxx,1579726078.0,Nothing hateful to say here. Think it sounds interesting to have her on.
DuggarsSnark,ff7y6i2,t3_es50bx,1579661164.0,Who is this woman?
SVU,ff73afc,t3_es0gjw,1579640263.0,"This character has always been my favorite from SVU.  I really never thought of the character being gay was important to character development at all. He just was.  It was no more important than the sexual orientation of any character on the show. Straight, gay? Who cares."
Younger,ff4oww2,t3_erbnlv,1579568906.0,100% agree. Josh and Liza belong together.
weddingshaming,ff4orpa,t3_erh749,1579568804.0,"I am 62 years old, Catholic, and have never ever known a priest to encourage parents to turn their backs on children.  I can guarantee you, if they chose to listen to this man and not come, at some point they will regret this decision."
nfl,ff1oms5,t3_er2mvd,1579482746.0,He is the man!!! Awesome!!!
DuggarsSnark,feljgst,t3_epq9tn,1579223649.0,Wonder what happened to him after they got married. His mouth is closed in these pics.
DuggarsSnark,fejndsb,t1_fejl4c6,1579180687.0,"No matter what we think of the narcissistic Jeremy, he is educated (unlike the Duggar kids). I think he planned their continued connection to Counting On and the family quite smartly. (Jill‚Äôs man, though he should have known better, didn‚Äôt, and totally over-estimated his value to the show and family)."
DuggarsSnark,fejmn9o,t1_feirym1,1579180014.0,"I‚Äôve been busy with work on a big project, so probably have missed something. (I need to talk to my boss about how work is interfering with my Duggar monitoring). What‚Äôs going on in Atlanta with Jinjer?"
Showerthoughts,fegfgmy,t3_eou90f,1579090972.0,"A bit off topic, but this made me think of something I saw years ago. My company was implementing a new accounting/financial/back office system. It was a huge project, so the vendor sent someone to assist. She ‚Äúlived‚Äùin a hotel across the street from our office. One day as I pulled into the parking lot I saw her jogging down the sidewalk. She was wearing bike shorts, high top basketball shoes, a poncho, and was smoking a cigarette as she ran. LOL"
ProjectRunway,fegf5dm,t3_eovskp,1579090653.0,She is fabulous. Sergio was an ass. His true character came shining through on this episode.
weddingshaming,fee4evu,t1_fee3pje,1579026170.0,"Thank you. Seeing also that definitions of high road are quite a bit different. In my world taking the high road means being the better person than someone who has intolerant views or are bigoted or narrow minded, with no openness. Looking back on what happened in our family with the wedding, the people who didn‚Äôt approve just didn‚Äôt come. I can see, though, how in someone else‚Äôs family, those same people would show up and cause pain."
weddingshaming,fee1dgz,t1_fedoqrj,1579024360.0,"Sorry for the offense. I do understand this wasn‚Äôt a request for advise. Btw, others offered advise, too. Mine apparently is considered unwarranted, because you found offense.  Again, everyone has their own truths as to what works or doesn‚Äôt work for them. I stand by that."
weddingshaming,fedhomv,t1_fedger3,1579011788.0,"I actually suggested this based on what occurred when my nephew got married. (His spouse is trans). He did take the high road, the cousin and wife didn‚Äôt come, but he felt like he had done the right thing with the invitation.  Of course, everyone has different truths and experiences within their family. I was reporting on our families real life example."
KansasCityChiefs,fedaj96,t3_eoecbl,1579005735.0,This picture was taken by a St Teresa‚Äôs academy graduate.
weddingshaming,fedaflf,t3_eoizqr,1579005634.0,Invite your brother and his wife. Take the high road. Doing this will not be a caving into their intolerance. It will show you as the better person. Any attempt at punishing him for what he did 10 years ago will only detract from your celebration.
DuggarsSnark,fed88ho,t3_eofyn6,1579003345.0,Just realized JBoob has anchorman hair. ‚ÄúI read somewhere their periods attract bears. Bears can smell the menstruation.‚Äù
offmychest,fe33id2,t3_enknog,1578845554.0,"As I read your post, I kept flashing back to a horrifying crime that happened in Overland Park, KS (suburb of Kansas City) years ago. Google the Kelsey Smith crime.  You absolutely cannot he too careful. You were aware of your surroundings and felt something was wrong. Kelsey didn‚Äôt notice."
Republican,fe2zkqy,t1_fe2wwri,1578844500.0,Indeed. And tried to do it without the press and US citizens knowing about it. You know they feared the optics.
Republican,fe2ktkz,t3_ennp52,1578839643.0,Those pallets and pallets and pallets of cold hard folding money were ‚Äúa little bit of money‚Äù? This man is a liar and must think we are all idiots.

ProjectRunway,fdy9wlc,t1_fdy7cse,1578777585.0,"Agree. He‚Äôs an ass, and not in a good way. If he was even half as talented as he thinks he is and that nasty ego was cut in half, maybe  I could stand this guy. So far, his designs have been uninspired. I was so hoping they would boot him to the curb this week after he was so disrespectful to Cyndi Lauper."
AskReddit,fdx2vz1,t1_fduf5l8,1578764702.0,"We had to watch The Matrix a second time for a strange reason. We hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, went to this movie starving. 30 minutes in, we were both so hungry we got up and left to get dinner. Took us months to go back and finally watch the entire movie."
offmychest,fdvuvn7,t3_en5coa,1578751695.0,So glad to hear this. Prayers from the US.

DuggarsSnark,fdldb63,t3_ely6w0,1578521579.0,"I‚Äôve noticed they don‚Äôt seem to bond with their infants. All seem incredibly uncomfortable and stiff with their own babies. Maybe it‚Äôs just being on camera. I think of myself with my two when they were infants and I was constantly cuddling them, kissing on them, reading to them, and holding them."
ProjectRunway,fdiovxc,t3_el8fhg,1578447735.0,Exactly what I thought of this guy. Snarky and ill mannered!!

DuggarsSnark,fd6a794,t1_fd4wcq3,1578187882.0,Good theory. I can definitely see Boob passive aggressively blaming her for her womanly failure.
DuggarsSnark,fd66vk0,t1_fd47hfo,1578186388.0,"Thanks for the explanation. I had never heard of this, but also had never heard the term rape culture, either."
ProjectRunway,fd512nk,t1_fd3lm4t,1578173144.0,"True. That‚Äôs what he said, but it was a personal comment about her family, and it was said after she told him he had not delivered what she requested and it wasn‚Äôt something she would ever wear. His comment was snark!!"
ProjectRunway,fd2k3n6,t3_ejqkou,1578148365.0,"I‚Äôm pretty sick of how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù it is now to snark publicly on someone you actually know NOTHING about, except what you‚Äôd read from others who are commenting with the exact same knowledge as you.  Most of the time the public snarking (like this) are done with the hope to score 15 minutes of fame points."
DuggarsSnark,fcz3667,t1_fcz30hh,1578092726.0,So sad.
DuggarsSnark,fcyxpry,t1_fcyjk6x,1578089383.0,"My niece was almost one of these wives. She was engaged to a nice young man. Nice, but obvious to most people that he was gay, and totally in denial. His parents and my sister pushed the relationship. Our family was so concerned about this possible marriage, and what it would do to both their lives. Several of us went to my brother-in-law with our concerns. We really liked him, but most knew this marriage should never happen.  Thankfully this young man called off the wedding just 3 months before the big day. Two years later he came out."

DuggarsSnark,fcojlpc,t1_fcoixjd,1577833860.0,Yes. He is 3 months old. We have really good insurance coverage.
DuggarsSnark,fcohsn0,t1_fcohcq5,1577832552.0,"Yes, my daughter is married. Our insurance is better than what her company offers. So she stayed on our policy. She‚Äôs covered until the end of the year she turns 26. She turns 25 in February.  Her husband has the same situation. His parents policy was better than what his company offered. He is also covered until the end of the year he turns 26. He turns 26 in November of next year."
DuggarsSnark,fcogn4r,t1_fcog2am,1577831763.0,We‚Äôve had insurance through two different providers. (2 different jobs). Both provided coverage even for our dependents.

(I had mentioned I had never heard of him before I started seeing there are actual teachings the Duggar‚Äôs are using as a template). I actually think he is a big time misogynist of the worst kind. His hate for women has manifested into 100% control."

DuggarsSnark,fc9pz4p,t1_fc9fp2l,1577556440.0,"Hmmm. You think possibly he is closeted and is self hating? He sounds like he hates women, also, which indicates a terrible mother/son relationship."

weddingshaming,fc91xd3,t3_eglg6o,1577545712.0,"My daughter is getting married in April. When she asked her friends, she gave them an out. She asked each one privately, told them she knew (even with us buying the dresses) it was an unexpected expense with parties, travel, etc, and she understood if they needed to say no. Three of the four girls are in graduate school. All four said yes, and they, along with my daughter, set up a budget that would work for all of the girls. I was very proud of my daughter. She said she loved all of them and didn‚Äôt want being in the wedding a chore."
offmychest,fc8qg8q,t3_egonvr,1577540118.0,"This is so important. Years and years ago a very good friend of mine came to me crying and full of anxiety about her boyfriend who had abruptly dropped her, after three years. I held her and listened. When she said she didn‚Äôt know what to do, I suggested she use the time to focus on herself, not to rush into any new ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. She got angry with me and said this. (I‚Äôve never forgotten even though it‚Äôs been 30 years). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like you. If you lost ‚ÄúBob‚Äù, you would be fine.

DuggarsSnark,fc6pcsu,t3_egdy3c,1577486105.0,"Many times young women end up marrying a guy who ends up just like their fathers. My brother-in-law is a narcissistic jerk who passive-aggressively blamed my sister for his work failures. They raised two daughters who never felt loved or cared for by their father. No matter how hard they tried to please him, they always fell short. My niece ended up marrying the first guy she dated, in college, who is also a narcissistic jerk. They have 4 sons and she is miserable, but is so beaten down she will never leave him.  I see these Duggar girls doing the same thing."
DuggarsSnark,fc6948o,t1_fc644qg,1577475118.0,You nailed it. Of course he does. What else would we call a behavior that involves expecting sex from your spouse ‚Äúon call‚Äù? That sounds like sexually abusive tendencies to me.
DuggarsSnark,fc5so1m,t1_fc5s9xi,1577464985.0,Exactly. Real life is way more important than social media.
DuggarsSnark,fc5rzlh,t1_fc5pflg,1577464563.0,"Interesting. My 24 year old daughter is engaged to her college BF. She is not at all interested in social media, and it appears neither are her friends.
