Advice,feo44mj,t1_feo1bk4,1579294889.0,"how will this build confusion? even though it isn’t “advice” per se, these are all important questions that help to put situations in perspective and to think/plan for the future friendship with this person. i thought the questions were extremely helpful in trying to navigate how and if OP wants to move forward with this person."

offmychest,fdjgv34,t1_fcug33v,1578470237.0,This comment made me feel really good. Even with a terrible situation I will be getting some justice! Thank you. :-)
offmychest,fdjgtyw,t1_fctydwd,1578470199.0,I will never understand why business owners will do this to their own working employees. Absolute trash human beings. At least what you did left a paper trail! Better than doing nothing and letting them get away with it.
offmychest,fdjgrn5,t1_fctrykm,1578470117.0,Thank you!!! I’m so relieved :-)
offmychest,fdjgqxs,t1_fctz4gr,1578470094.0,It’s truly unbelievable! Any business owner who steals/treats their OWN employees like disposable trash is scum. I’m honestly appalled people have the audacity to do these things...
offmychest,fdjgndi,t1_fctuppq,1578469968.0,Can I call the department of labor even when I’m already with an attorney? I thought it was not necessary if I’m pursuing things legally with an attorney!

AskReddit,fcmerjh,t1_fcme02e,1577772593.0,happy tears or sad tears...
AskReddit,fcmepa0,t1_fcmdx2b,1577772533.0,reading this made me feel sad. somehow inaudible whimpering seems more painful than crying... how are you doing today if you don’t mind me asking?
confession,fcbgofu,t3_egzpqv,1577586635.0,"I know how you feel. You’ll feel anything but at peace but that’s okay. Give your heart and brain some time. Breathe. You are okay! This was a stupid mistake and you sound regretful of your actions. You’re human, I’m human, everyone is human and we all make mistakes. That’s life. Don’t be too hard on yourself, even if you feel like a POS. What you do now and forwards is the most important thing! It’s going to be okay though, OP.  :)"
confession,fcbe2la,t3_egtp3e,1577585729.0,"You’re in the right path. You’re showing remorse, and guilt for what you did. You were only 12, and this has been eating at you until now. Rather than you not giving a flying fuck and continuing living like nothing happened, you understand the weight of your actions and you’re now trying to become better. You’re doing the right thing, OP. Could I suggest therapy? Rather than confessing into a sea of toxic unhelpful reddit users, I think going to a therapy session and talking about this would be better for your mental health and hopefully onto a path of healing. Reddit just isn’t the place. I hope healing for you both."
