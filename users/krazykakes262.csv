I'm sorry if you've dealt with a lot of jerks. I promise not all guys are like that. Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding a nice partner  as well. I think the same goes for nice guys finding nice partners as well.

My main thing statement is that our society raises and expects men and women to act a certain way.  Women are expected to be weak and men to always be strong. But, guys still have insecurities. Women can be strong. But each is viewed in a negative light for not fitting what society expects. It's how we were raised."

unpopularopinion,fesi1k1,t1_fes864o,1579365318.0,"I don't claim to have answers or solutions on how to fix this, but I think we have divided ourself ad a country by focusing on how 'different' we are from the other side and how they are all wrong and we are all right. By doing so, we are weaker and unable to really make the changes needed. We are more focused on 'being right' and having everything 'our way' that we don't look to compromise.  No one can have 100% things their way without limiting rights of others or making others unhappy. We have to make some sacrifices.   Abraham Lincoln was right when he said that a house divided against itself will fall.  We have become so entitled that we are forgetting the reason our country was formed, which was for everyone to have freedom. We are so blessed and have grown up in this that I think we forget just how lucky we are.  We don't think anything of restricting rights of others to have things 'our way'.  I grew up in a VERY conservative Christian home. The downside is I was brainwashed into thinking any other way of thinking was bad.  I was homeschooled, my parents were antivaxxers (don't worry, I'm up to date since I've been on my own) and government conspirarists. Whooo boy.

When I got out on my own, I realized I had so much in common with people from all over the political and religious spectrum.  We focus so much on differences instead of our shared goals.  My friends and I come from different beliefs and political parties, but we all agree abuse is wrong, love is staying through the hard times and isn't just infatuation, children need better education, etc. My point is, we have more in common than different. We just have different ideas on how it can be solved. Instead of blocking the other party, we should be working together.  Friends from both 'sides' agree that we need to fix the terms for senate, house of representatives, and more. No more salary for life, or having a seat for more than 15 years.  We've been divided and either we work together and realize we can't have things 100 % our way, or we will continue in a downhill spiral. 

Is there a subreddit where people who also think this way come together to name problems and work on possible solutions, being humble and open to other opinions?"
lastimages,fescios,t1_feo42x3,1579363840.0,"When my sister was about 3 and I was 6, we took lessons at a local YMCA.  The memory is a bit foggy, but I'm guessing there were at least 8 to 12 kids.  At that moment, we were sitting on a little ledge inside the swimming pool, attached to the wall. It was barely enough room to sit.  I want to say the water was at least 4 ft deep, so well over the heads of the kids, should they reach the bottom.  The kids were being kids, I think splashing a little. I was little so the memory is a bit hazy.  None of us were wearing any kind of arm floaty.  My sister was pretty quiet at that age.  She slipped off, I want to say at least 2 to 3 ft away from the wall, and couldn't swim, so she went underwater.  I noticed at some point.  There was only one swimming instructor, a pretty obese lady in her 50's to 60's. The reason I mention this is bc it took her so long to get to my sister.  She had her back to the side my sister was on.  I think she was dealing with the kiddos on her left side being rambunctious, bc, you know, they are kindergarten age.  She didn't even notice. At this point, my sister is about the same feet away from the wall as the instructor, so if she had moved closer to the wall when turning to her right side, she wouldn't have seen my sister underwater. My mom, who I will mention is legally blind, as in, she can see, but not well enough to drive, happened to be walking towards us from the stadium seating and by some miracle noticed!  She started screaming frantically that my sister was drowning and was about to jump in fully clothed to save my sister.  I want to say the lady was at least 3 to 5 feet away and very, VERY slowly meandered by WALKING VIA THE POOL FLOOR to get to my sister!  If you have ever waded in chest deep water, you know how long it takes to walk around.  Luckily my sister was okay, but I'm surprised she isn't scared of water to this day.  If my mom hadn't noticed my sister drowning, I'm not sure she would have been rescued in time. Please tell me they at least give kids arm floaties when they are learning yo swim where y'all from."

AnimalsBeingBros,fe8qrqb,t1_fe8qg6p,1578929485.0,"I'm honestly glad it works for you. However, this doesn't apply to everyone.  My guess is the more severe it is, the harder it is to logic."
AnimalsBeingBros,fe8pm5x,t1_fe8hkq2,1578928964.0,"Wow. Based on your insensitive comment, you obviously have not had a panic attack or anxiety attack before, nor been diagnosed with moderate to severe anxiety or PTSD.  An anxiety disorder is a biological problem where the fight or flight system is haywire and perceives normal situations as dangerous.  This means your body treats everyday activities or items as a threat. Your body is in a state of panic 24/7.

As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, let me clue you in on what it is like on a daily basis.

During an anxiety or panic attack, my body shuts down. I can't really think.  My body shakes uncontrollably. My heart rate is high and I'm breathing hard, as if I had run a race. There is just pure panic.  Panic attacks are triggered by outside stimuli.  Anxiety attacks have no trigger and just happen.  So, even though I try to explain logic to my brain, the attack continues.  It can last 20 minutes to 24 hours. I never know when it will hit or how long it will last. I can pass out in an instant if my body gets too overwhelmed and can't handle the attack anymore.  I'm actually having one as we speak. It makes it very difficult for me to function at home or in public. Medicine has not worked for me.  Having a service dog helps me try to have a normal life and be able to function in society.  One of the tasks he provides is deep pressure therapy, which helps my panic attacks end sooner.  On top of attacks, I constantly worry about everything and have nightmares every day. I can get headaches from mild attacks.


People like me can't just 'logic' our anxiety away, due to it being a chemical imbalance we can't control, just like you can't 'logic' away cancer. You have to get treatment through medicine, as well as other methods that can help us cope, depending on our specific needs and severity/limiting ability of anxiety.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to pm me."
AnimalsBeingBros,fe8jl9h,t1_fe84fp4,1578926852.0,"ESA definitely can help at home, I speak from experience, but service dogs are specifically trained to do tasks to help someone function normally in society.  The dog in the video was a trained service dog. There is no official registration for ESA or service dogs.  ESA are not allowed in public or required to have any training. Service dogs have undergone public access tests, passed the good canine citizen test, and are specifically trained in tasks to help their owner."

I get saving money on dog food if they can. And how they were so busy before me, that they didn't know what time they would be home to feed dogs.  So I get why. 

I guess when I am presented with proven facts about dog health, such as long nails will injure ligaments and joints, meal feeding is proven to be better, vaccines from a store  are not regulated and a possible hazard to pets unlike one from the vet, breeding a dog with a disease will pass it on to the puppies...
