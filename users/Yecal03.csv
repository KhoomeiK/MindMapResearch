wholesomememes,ffdn6rs,t3_esvq03,1579824453.0,My husband thinks that this is us. He has the most dadest of dad jokes ever seen on this planet. He thinks that I laugh to support him. I smile because I genuinely enjoy his jokes. Hes so creative and quick witted. It takes a very smart person to come up with puns and dad jokes so quickly and so often. I am not smiling at the joke because its funny or to boost his ego. Im smiling at the man that I love because he is so fricken smart.

Advice,ffb9te3,t3_esjz5k,1579756558.0,"This is your biological clock and they are mean little suckers. It's like trying not to want sex. You can't not think about it. 

It took is a couple of years to get and stay pregnant and it was mind numbingly hard. You wake up and go to bed thinking about it. You see babies and pregnancies everywhere. Get invited to showers and birthday parties. Nothing made it go away. So I went the other direction. I started preparing for a baby. I started reading parenting books, crocheted a couple of blankets, started really learning how to cook ect. I wont lie and say that it made it all better but it did help. Also My daughter is 11 now and she still has one of the blankets that I made her. She calls it her masterpiece blanket because I call her my masterpiece and she knows that I made it while hoping for her. 

I'm sorry. I know that this sucks. I know that infertility and not being there yet are not the exact same thing but I can understand the heart breaking longing. If you want to chat I'm around (I mean it ) ."

This is literally a snapshot of a moment. You don't know that we have gymnastics on Wednesday and baking on Thursday. Not to mention homework and  library. Also we live literally across the street from a park. You don't know that this is a birthday party (speaking of only one kid in this picture is under 10 yo) and they are playing hide and seek in minecraft because they where playing hide and seek outside near the lake but it got too cold for them when it started raining. You don't know that not all of these kids are mine. You don't know that we dont watch tv we game.  You don't know that our oldest was born autistic and when she was Four she started talking a little. The best way to get her to talk was to put her in a league bot game with us. She would narrate what her toon was doing. It was amazing. We play games together to include eachother in our lives not the opposite. I am not that kind of mom. Balance is everything.

This is my son at age Four playing boxVR on my Rift. 

Do you know what else he could do at age Four? Cook. Seriously cook. He started saying that he wants to be a chef damn near as soon as he could talk. So we started teaching him to cook he also takes baking lessons. Hes so into it that he wanted a food truck for Christmas. He can also crochet, throw a football, read, take out the trash, change a light bulb, and is learning to do a round off now. Does he sit in front of a screen all day? Nope. Will I keep him away from one of our favorite activities because some peoples parents use it as a babysitter and it now came with judgment from other parents? Hellllls nope."

Hes so funny. Maybe funny is not the correct word. Quick witted. He has dad jokes. The kind of jokes that make you face palm and roll your eyes. They are not exactly funny but clever. The way that he comes up with them just anytime and so quickly is amazing.  That makes them funny. It really attracted me to him. Hes so fricken smart. He hated his jokes lol. Once he realized how much I enjoyed them though he started telling more and I was seriously hooked. 

It's funny how a thing that he was a bit self conscious about ended up being the thing that got him his girl lol. 

I guess what I'm saying (if you will excuse my mama voice) is please dont give up on finding that if you want it and dont believe that you have to mask to do it. People nt and asd alike are all weird and its hard to tell what a person really will be attracted to. Dont completely hide your beautiful quirks. One of them may be what is  attractive to someone.

He NEVER hit or hurt me but he just seems so out of control. He told me one day ""Im not angry. This is much more like crying."" That really really helped me to understand. Its something that Nt people can relate to and understand. I was seeing it as an anger response because its so.... violent I guess would be the word. You can relate anger to bratty but not pain. Even the reaction to the emotion is alike.  Sometimes you can stop yourself from crying but mostly the tears are going to come.   


Anyway. I try not to crash yalls party. You need a space to communicate with people who understand ect. I just wanted to tell you what helped me to understand because maybe it could help your family. <3 I hope that you have a great day today."

From what I've been reading though they are finding some genetic markers but they are also finding large percentage of cases are caused by brain damage at a fatal level. We just don't know yet.

 I can say that we have 3 kids. My husband is not diagnosed but he is autistic. No doubt. Our oldest daughter is autistic. Our middle daughter is nt and our youngest is ntish. Lol it's not strong enough to be an issue really. He would not be diagnosed if we got him tested. It's like he has autism super light."

As he gets older though I know it will be embarrassing for mommy to talk to him about this stuff. I have no problem with porn but I do feel like someone needs to teach him not to download underage stuff, about how serious that can be. Also it would be nice to teach him how not to find stuff that will give our computers STDs.  Not only will that be embarrassing for him but I am not into porn. Sex is very emotional for me so it just does not interest me. So I dont exactly know how to teach him how to be safe with it. I see some very interesting mommy homework in my not so distant future."

I tell antivaxxers that she is the person that she was always supposed to be. We made her and we dont share the credit with toxins. There are studies that show a genetic tie and studies that show brain damage at the fetal stage. Both are correct I think. These should be different conditions.
