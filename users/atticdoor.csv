asimov,fenoo2v,t3_eq47ed,1579288673.0,"Asimov was assuming people would read the books in chronological order rather than publication order so was trying to not give away Trantor and Star's End are the same place.  I could tell myself the Second Foundationers were working undercover at the Imperial Library and that any contact with Seldon would put the project at risk.

It also means that the Second Foundation was actually founded *before* the First Foundation.  Bit of an oddity.

Really, did Asimov need to set up the Second Foundation at this point, really?  Linge Chen exiled the 100,000 encyclopedists to Terminus along with the psychohistorians new recruit, but *not* the psychohistorians themselves.  What else would Linge Chen do with the psychohistorians other than insist they stay in Imperial Sector where he can keep an eye on them, doing menial filing work in the Imperial Library.  My guess is Asimov had each chapter of Forward the Foundation be about losing a friend or associate, the first three were not by choice but in the final chapter, he sacrifices a family member for the Seldon Plan- showing how he is now the serious figure of the Gaal Dornick story.

As to your question about *Foundation and Earth*, Asimov never worked out how to continue the story.  He set things up for the Solarians to be the external threat he envisaged, and Gaia as the cure for the Solarians.  But he was struggling to work out how to write it and when a correspondent suggested a book about a young Hari Saldon, he ran with it.  My dream Foundation sequels would have a book about the Foundations and Gaia uniting to take out the Solarians, then another book about the Foundations uniting against Gaia, and finally a book about the First Foundation against the Second Foundation again, on the eve of the millennium itself.

It's been noted before that the one thing we know about the later time period - that there is an encyclopedia written in 1020 FE - would suggest that the Galaxia plan could not have completely come about.  What use would Gaia have for an encyclopedia?"

Note that it is not really possible to compare the Classic Who AI scores with New Who AI scores.  They started off in the sixties by scoring them such that 50 was the average, it has since drifted up so that the average is close to 85.  The scores normally differ from 85 by up to 5 either way. 

You are best of comparing scores to episodes broadcast closely in time.  *Sleep No More*, broadcast only five years ago, scored 78, one more than *Orphan 55*.  The mainstream audience couldn't make sense at all of the mono-actored and excellent *Heaven Sent*, scoring it 80."

technology,fe5l735,t1_fe3p5kd,1578870881.0,"Yes, you should pull the child from the path of a speeding car- that was a *reductio ad absurdum* to show how the word ""touch"" has been misappropriated to mean ""molest"", when the words are not synonyms.  It's okay to like children, it's just not okay to ""like"" children.  It's okay to touch children, it's just not okay to ""touch"" children.  These euphemisms are not helpful because they imply the plain meaning of the word is *wrong* too, which it is not.  Of course you can shake hands with a child, or lift your children onto the swings, or pull them from the path of a speeding car."

asimov,fe4dfyf,t1_fdyoljb,1578858088.0,"Nothing at all, that artist didn't bother reading the books, just drew cool spaceships.  Campbell always insisted his artists drew something from the stories, but not all the subsequent paperback artists followed suit.  These were the versions I first read, so I have a soft spot for them.  I always imagined the ship on the left was the recovered derelict from the Grand Fleet which the Foundation fixed up and Wienis named after himself, but the artist was just drawing at random."
technology,fe33pv7,t1_fe31yt0,1578845582.0,"So surely then it *is* child molesters which are the problem?  If a child had been molested, it's no comfort or mitigation whether it was out of power or perverted attraction?  If a person has such attraction but doesn't act on it, what should the legal system do?  By making *paedophile* the main word, we miss the point."
