You can spend not much on a used machine and grinder to see what you like, if you are willing to spend the time in the morning (?) to learn how to make a nice cup. There is a learning curve.  It took me a year to learn how to make a consistent cup.

Prioritize money on a grinder. Used Baratza Sette 270s can be found for about $200. Used Gaggia Classics or Rancilio Silvas for about $150-250 or so.

Bullshit. (1)

I have a huge problem with just about all your statements. 

Largely because you are making the gross assumption that his currently published plan will be THE plan. As if it's actual legislative language. (2)

You are also making the massively erroneous assumption in your calculations that we can just blithely go on at current levels of consumption, or that Li batteries are the only energy storage tech available, or that electricity production is the only source of energy. (3)

Example (1, 2 and 3 encapsulated):

>Likewise, since he is calling for the elimination of fossil fuels in the transportation sector, that needs to have energy storage equivalent to what we currently use in fossil fuels right now. Again there is no way around this, in fact the increase in storage capacity is probably much more then it's equivalent in fossil fuels since you now have to carry around the batteries.

This is the same bullshit criticism that the GOP is using against the other version of the GND.

There are alternatives:

* Buy less shit
* Mass Hydro storage for areas that can use that
* large commercial trucks can also use hydrogen in IC engines as well as in fuel cells
* large commercial trucks can also use hydraulic storage systems for regeneration
* light to heavy rail.

If so, it has a C wire terminal on the main board. Page 25

So procure some thermostat wire with the appropriate wire count. Probably 18-5 or 18-7. The cost difference is minimal, so I'd suggest 18-7 wire - especially if you have an AC unit, or plan on a multi-stage furnace in the future. More wires will also let you run accessories like a humidifier from a smart thermostat.

Replace the existing wire with the new wire. Wire it the same as today, just with a C wire to power the thermostat. You basically just add that 1 wire.

For reference:

* **Blue or Black** – C – Common wire, may be unused by your existing thermostat. ...
* **Red** – R – 24VAC power from the furnace's transformer.
* **Green** – G – Fan

politics,fejoqon,t1_feiy67b,1579181863.0,"I think that the reality is that there where a lots of reasons for a lot of the Constitution. Some where good reasons, some where bad reasons and some people didn't care one way or the other.

There was even a debate as to if we even needed a Bill of Rights (BoR) since once we started to enumerate Rights, then ALL rights would need to be spelled out. It's easy to forget that a lot of rights where considered Inalienable.

It's easy to forget that the BoR was passed as a package and that different ratifiers had different reasons for approving it. The Slave holding states wanted the 2nd to justify militias to put down rebellions, etc.

I think, in broad strokes, the basic vision was:

* Strong Navy as we where basically an island away from Europe and also to protect trade
* Small professional Army, which was to be re-funded every two years. This would form the core of a larger army if we where invaded. Professionally trained soldiers with 1st rate equipment. But small enough that they couldn't take over a government.
* The states would constitute Militias to provide a basic level of military training for military aged men. The purpose of which was to provide a ready made infantry in the case of rebellion or invasion. But under direct control of the States, not the Feds.

The 2nd was designed to protect the rights of individuals to keep military arms under the auspices of a State militia - the ""Well Regulated"" part. This was the Federalist compromise. This is, at least in my opinion, obvious given the 1st draft of the BoR.

>*Art. 5.   A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.*

The last part was dropped due to the obvious conflict with the establishment clause. The problem was that it wasn't re-written to make it obvious that arms where to be used for state sponsored military purpose, probably because everybody knew what it was for. It stood that way until the NRA twisted it."

Anyway, your line of thinking is why the GOP keeps getting more extreme - because they think that compromise is a one sided thing. Only Democrats need to compromise, the GOP can stand where they are.
