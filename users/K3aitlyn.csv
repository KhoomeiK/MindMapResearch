trans,ffbxpsk,t3_ess3wr,1579786134.0,"I actually always here about girls have more pleasure. Men tend to have pleasure in one spot during sex and can orgasm once and girls can feel it throughout their body. So no, definitely not true, 

but I feel like you need to figure out if thats what she has been told to believe, or if she genuinely would rather be male. So I would just ask questions around it like can you see yourself as male ect and try and learn that side of them and why they believe what they do. I always challenge people who say they want to be *insert gender* by asking them why they don't just be that gender, and just be themselves"

I once got a wax pot and strips and got wax **everywhere** the first time XD best of luck whatever you do"
trans,ff0bfqb,t3_eqy481,1579467218.0,"Gender is a feeling, an identity, if you feel like you are a boy, you are a boy. Just try and find ways to be yourself and discover yourself, you not doing anything perminent for the time being so explore. I wanted to be a girl since I was 5 years old, now I have a body that more correctly correlates to how I feel. Please hang in there, what you are going through and what you are about to go through isn't easy, just try and surround yourself with people that let you be you. 

Try and convince your mom its just hair, get yourself a beanie, please, if your mom doesn't let you cut your hair, it is so easy to hide your hair, trust me. I ok, my body after hormones make me happier, but I am genderfluid/demigirl and hiding hair in a hat does relief my desphoria, best of luck

Also, you don't seem confused, but being afraid is ok, hugs"

Unfortunately, this is a just try and deal with it situation, unless anyone else has suggestions. My tip is just to have self awareness, notice that you feel alot more crap then normal, and just take care of yourself for that day. Hang in there"

Men tend to do it with the camera below or those angles

Basically you are pretty, the camrea angle doesn't do you as much justice. Not like it really matters. Your selfie Just might make you look more adrogenous then you are? Sorry, I rambled on, I am being over analytical. You are cute, have a nice day"
