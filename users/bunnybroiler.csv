TownshipGame,ff5m4xq,t3_erl5gu,1579599703.0,"I dislike this one cos if you can't make the right products then you can't get all the rockets made. With the colour splash I had hundreds of blocks stocked up! But the worst was the jungle quest, I just couldn't get the bridges right. The concept is the same, you have to imagine where the curve will land (same as the bridges) but I find this one easier somehow. I've completed all the personal goals now, so it's just a case of getting more envelopes to boost me in the top 3 (always need T cash!)"
TownshipGame,fezm831,t1_fexy1jy,1579458917.0,Yeah my first level was fruit jellies and rose sorbet. So it seems it's different for everyone?
news,fezc0tf,t1_fez809s,1579455798.0,"If the child's history is known, it's not a clear cut situation every time. In the case of same sex parents they aren't going to name an egg or sperm donor on the birth certificate. I'm just saying this is progress."
news,feyzlo8,t1_feyyyir,1579452436.0,"Yes exactly. The ones in the UK when I was born asked for your parents occupation, like what does that have to do with anything? May have changed since but definitely not useful information to have."
news,feyogs9,t3_eqryao,1579448279.0,"This totally makes sense. It's a birth certificate, not a parentage certificate. Where your DNA comes from isn't as important as who is legally going to take care of the child until it's of age. I think birth certificates have been outdated for a long time and change needs to happen to reflect the modern world."
SupermodelCats,feykhnc,t3_equrx3,1579446764.0,I hope they are excellent to each other! ðŸ¤˜

NewAmsterdamTV,ferbxfw,t3_eqe99b,1579352204.0,"I think that was always his role? He's not a main character. Also the season isn't over yet there might be more from him to come. Some shows choose to do a focus episode on a minor character, who knows maybe there'll be one for Casey."
TheAffair,feram38,t3_eqeutf,1579351777.0,"Keep going. I thought I wouldn't like S5 either but it wraps up the whole story from start to finish quite nicely. Yes, Joanie's part is a bit lame, but by the end I'm sure you'll agree it was better than S4. I was pleasantly surprised!"
TownshipGame,fehygob,t3_eowf9x,1579126404.0,If you already have loads of coins then just buy something expensive like trees and then sell them back at half the price. You're spending coins but if you're like me and have over 1 mil in coins who cares? As long as it's not T cash I'm using I don't care.
NewAmsterdamTV,fehy4fw,t3_ep1fd1,1579126199.0,"Wouldn't be a drama without some, well, drama. They've basically set it up so that all the main characters are now or soon to be unattached: Max is single, Sharp is single (I'm shipping those 2 tbh), Reynolds is about done with his fiancee, Bloom is single (and doing her physio on the DL) and even Iggy might be if he doesn't stop adopting babies behind his husband's back! 

They can't build new storylines if everyone is in the same place they were last season, but I hope at least it doesn't get as incestuous as Grey's Anatomy!!"
askscience,feb5gt5,t1_fea8wgu,1578955618.0,This sounds like a scene from a movie!

relationships,fdyfmos,t1_fdxbhdy,1578779264.0,"If people want uniform bridesmaids they should hire some models for the photo, or even stand in front of a cardboard cutout of their desired look bridesmaids, not subject their close friends and family to these ridiculous rules. People are so insane these days!"
AskReddit,fdpygcf,t3_emkkri,1578645963.0,"I've managed to avoid having happy birthday sung at me for years, can't even remember when someone did. Here's how: 
1. Don't have birthday parties. Go to a theme park, play crazy golf, have a heavy roast lunch, anything that avoids the need for dessert or cake (99% of the time it's the presence of cake or a sit down meal that instigates this)
2. Have friends who are too shy, serious or don't give a shit about singing happy birthday to you.
3. Organise your own birthday shenanigans. If you let someone else do it, some fucker will sing happy birthday to you.

So far, so good

(Edit: I can't seem to do lists but if you look closely there's 3 bullet points here)"

loseit,fdgu4za,t3_el3xhu,1578408385.0,"Leave the past in the past. You need a fresh start, you'll always be second guessing his intentions if you do start a relationship with him. Will he reject you again if you gain weight? Ain't nobody got time for that. Tell him the moments passed and delete him off your IG."

coolguides,fcpczly,t1_fco7bu9,1577858795.0,"You shouldn't regret it. It was how you felt at the time, so it's valid. You could also turn it into a percentage and compare with your overall impression of the year? Like 80% of the year was better than ok, Vs what the colour chart says. 

Sometimes it's hard when you get to the end to see the highs and lows as growth, especially if your having a crap time near the end (as I am)."
videos,fcpcmaj,t1_fcp37ja,1577858372.0,"I kinda agree (non parent here). The music is out there, you really can't stop them listening to it. They were old enough to understand the lyrics but I'd also like to think they are smart enough to get that it's the usual bullshit rappers joke about (big dick, dexual prowess etc etc). They literally mocked it at every turn. It was great!"

AskReddit,fcmkm7d,t1_fckehbd,1577779178.0,Everyone with celiac disease that I've met doesn't eat out at restaurants. Ever. These people were stupid to trust a restaurant to cater to their illness.

MensLib,fbpju2h,t1_fbosaaw,1577021830.0,"I think it's not just men though. I know so many people who never had pets growing up, and so many of them are afraid of dogs, indifferent to cats and would ignore an animal in need like a bird that flew into a window. It's sad, because learning to take care of a pet prepares people for adult life, where you might have children of your own, or an elderly relative who needs care. I believe that being kind and compassionate to animals who can't communicate all their needs makes us better human beings."
