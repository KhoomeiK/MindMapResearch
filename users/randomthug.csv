politics,ff3lcc5,t1_ff3kktj,1579543496.0,Thats a nice list that shows the hundreds of bills he's worked on with people from both parties.
politics,ff3l6k0,t1_ff3kcwe,1579543396.0,"His ability to compromise when the action of compromising is a benefit to all Americans is great.  Its not as simple as ""he doesn't bend the knee every time"" 

He was, and is, known for being one of the few people during his entire political career that would reach across the aisle and bring the conversation to both sides. Sure it didn't always work but he has spent a political career trying to work with both sides for the benefit of all.  Its why he went independent.

Example, voted against going into Iraq because that was the smart and important move.  Voted for aid for the Iraq war when it included money for returning veterans, good for all and important compromise.

You can argue this shit all you want but its only recently with the current narrative.  

In recent years, YES he's become more ""partisain"" and that's because the right has gone full on fucking nuts.  They literally turned the concept of moderation into a negative, recall them losing their shit because Chris Christie had the nerve to HUG OBAMA?

Yes you could argue in the last decade of his time in he hasn't been reaching across the aisle but to lay that blame on him alone is to ignore what the GOP had become at that time."
politics,ff3kgms,t1_ff3ioib,1579542959.0,"Because its not as simple as just using the word ""compromise""

For instance Bernie voted against going into Iraq.  But when a bill came forward to help funding for the war AND INCLUDED aid for Veterans returning he voted for that.

You can't sit here and say ""He's bad because he wont compromise"" and ""He's bad if he compromises"" unless you're not trying to argue points and just trying to bash the guy.

Its about being smart.  He wasn't an Independent for so long because he hated the democrats.  He was, IS, literally known for being able to reach across the aisle and work for deals that work for the best of everyone.

Just certain issues are currently MASSIVE FUCKING THINGS.  Like Climate change and he wants to COMPROMISE (which means INCLUDING things that work to prevent the rise of world wide catastrophe) Not just ignore it completely and hope that later we can do something about it.

Government in the US has ALWAYS been about compromise.  Its just in the recent decades certain groups (Neolibs in a sense but more the GOP) have turned concepts like ""moderate"" into a negative.  Bernies BIG idea's are ones that benefit everyone and his goal is to get them past.  The current ""narrative"" from the press is that he is unable to compromise and that nothing he proposes would pass.

Which ignores his entire political history and is just a narrative based on how he speaks DURING A PRESIDENTIAL Run. 

There is no ""cult of Bernie"" for instance if Bernie decided tomorrow to not compromise but to DIRECTLY ALTER his plans and say fuck medicare for all, his supporters would flee. Its about the goals he wants to achieve.

The complaints about other politicians is they compromise based on MONEY.  From lobbyist groups or big donors.  Not based on whats best for the people but whats best for their careers or their pocket books.   

The current narrative ignores his entire political history and makes an assumption thats counter to his entire political history based on sound bites and biased assumptions.  It also assumes things like future outcomes of elections ""we can't get it done now!"" ignores the fact we're having votes for the Senate as well and the growing number of progressives within politics as we speak which is only seemingly INCREASING.

The argument against Bernie is a defeatist argument and people are comparing him to Trump in that regard which is absolutely insanely ridiculous.  

Its the same as comparing Martin Luther King Jr. to David Duke because both men had strong convictions on their beliefs."
