WestCoastSwing,ff37dwx,t1_ff27hfw,1579535451.0,"I would say that's not super true, you should definitely look a little nicer than social dancing. And certain things, like wearing jeans when no one else is, will make you stand out in a way you probably don't want."

self,fe0923q,t3_en212v,1578806454.0,"Everything feels super important in middle school. I remember going through a lot of crushes and heartbreak, and feeling like I was either in love or depressed a lot of the time. Now, ten years later, I remember all of that stuff pretty fondly - even the feeling of being heartbroken after a crush.

When your hormones are bein' all weird like they do when you're in 8th grade, you just gotta ride it out. Let yourself be heartbroken about this girl! Feel that! Try and maintain a friendship with her if you can - mending relationships is a really valuable skill to learn. She's going through the same weird rollercoaster you are, so just try to keep that in mind. But in the long run, as long as you act with kindness and respect for her, you're going to look back on this positively sometime in the future. For now, just try to learn what you can, and enjoy the rest of 8th grade."
self,fe0848m,t3_en3ru8,1578805623.0,"This may be something to talk to your fam about, I'm sure they don't want to see your dog suffer either!! Dogs can also have a hard time adjusting to a new sibling (just like people), but it'll get better with time. In fact, my parents' older dog definitely acts more youthful now that she's used to having their puppy around."
self,fe07kde,t3_en5rkz,1578805164.0,"I also have a crazy fear of needles. I've been avoiding ""the big draw"", as you so aptly put it, because I am terrified. And I'm 21, for reference.

I think the nurse may have accidentally struck a nerve. While blood draws/IVs can hurt (I have had an IV within the past few years and it didn't feel like sunshine and butterflies), it shouldn't be so painful you can't even focus on where you are. 

This is really important for people like us with bad phobias: you are allowed to advocate for yourself! Being afraid or in pain is NOT embarrassing. You don't need to hold your feelings back. I find it very helpful to say things like ""just so you know, I'm terrified"". Or ""ow, that hurts a bit"" . If you tell them you're in pain, they have a chance to assess the severity and decide if they need to adjust something. If you have another blood draw/shot/whatever in the future, keep this in mind and don't be afraid to speak up. I haven't stopped being afraid, but it helps me feel like I'm being heard and like I'm more safe, which can help."
self,fe04q0k,t3_enhrg6,1578803022.0,"So my life is definitely not anywhere near as full of conflict as yours seems to be, but I know how you feel to an extent. My parents are Catholic, and I'm a lot of things that don't line up with Catholicism (mainly being an atheist, lol). I have lied to my parents about my life, and I've lied to ex partners and old friends about my parents/family. It's a shitty feeling, but it definitely feels like you have to a lot of the time, or everything will fall apart.

I think that your current situation is not sustainable. It's tearing you apart, and that can't feel good. If you're open to suggestions, I think you should try seeing a new therapist to ""start fresh"" so to speak. This time though, you need to be completely honest. It doesn't have to start all at once. You can start off by telling them that you're in this mess, that it's difficult for you to be honest about things because of the potential consequences, but that you'd like to move forward bit by bit. If they're any good, this therapist should be able to help you out with sharing your feelings and experiences while also finding a path forward. You shouldn't have to go through this alone, but I can see where it would be so challenging to open up to anyone else in your life. But really, you owe it to yourself and to your partner to take care of yourself! You're worth that. It doesn't matter if you feel bad about lying, or if you don't feel bad about lying. It's ok to start working through things one piece at a time and figure it out as you go.


Edit: and one last little piece, I know you now. I know your story, and I promise I won't forget. Anytime you feel so alone, just know that I remember you, and I hope things get better for you."

FridgeDetective,fdreicw,t1_fdq1ey6,1578683408.0,"Depends on the alcohol and your desired results. Freezer isn't going to ruin any hard alcohol, but it may taste different cold. I personally prefer to shoot liquor out of the freezer rather than room temp, but room temp may be better for sipping or making a cocktail."
FridgeDetective,fdre8g9,t1_fdran73,1578683242.0,"The alcohol content in hard liquor is so high that nothing in the bottle will freeze. this is not true.

I learned to read before kindergarten and ended up with frustration. I wasn't given challenging enough work at school, despite my mom continuing to push for it.

gatekeeping,fc8l15a,t1_fc8gsof,1577537121.0,"This isn't quite right. It's not about all stimuli, it's about social interaction. Introverts may enjoy social interaction, but feel drained and have to recharge by being alone. Extroverts may enjoy alone time, but feel drained when they are alone for too long and need to be around people to recharge.

Regardless, the whole thing is a bit of a false dichotomy. People are more complicated than this, and whether you need social interaction or not is probably going to depend on the situation, your emotional state, etc."
