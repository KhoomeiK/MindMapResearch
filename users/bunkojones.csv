Our bodies absorb strains with a high percentage of THC with great efficiency, and a ridiculously small amount serves as a metabolism booster and a bronchiodilator.

Whoa! I must of hit a nerve there, as she totally flipped out. I sent her a card wishing her well, and mentioned she might ""talk"" with someone regarding her issues. There was no more conversation after that. I have a hunch a family member or neighbor likely molested her at a young age.
