Showerthoughts,ff7wejl,t1_ff7qgtr,1579659955.0,"I suffered from social anxiety all throughout high school and most of my young adult life. It wasnt until I became an engineer working with many professional engineers, architects and business people that I realized a lot of dumb fucks got really lucky in life."
AskReddit,ff7r41i,t3_erv0ao,1579656321.0,"Not a massage therapist but being young and naive I decided to go get my first massage at 24. My wife recommended that I do so to help with my back and neck pains.

I went to an asian spot that just opened up because it seemed cheaper than massage envy and I'm always down for a good opportunity to learn some words in another language.

I get in and only take my shirt and socks off. My wife didnt tell me I needed to atleast get down to my underwear.

The ""masseuse"" came in and looked really confused and asked if I wanted to keep my pants on. I said yes!  About 45 mins in she ask me to flip over and I happily obliged. She started massaging my face which I did not like because I have a weird thing about anyone's hands being near my face, but I'm too nice to say no to people.

She then starts to massage my arms and comments on how strong and handsome I am. Then she ask if i have a girlfriend.  That's when it clicked. I fucked up. I had dick hands all over my body and my face.  I got out as soon as I could and my wife laughs everytime I bring it up."
personalfinance,ff56w3c,t1_ff56d19,1579581954.0,"Ok. Ideally itd be better to save a lot more then.  We do have a college fund going already and I'm contributing to my 401k.   

My wife's income should increase significantly after our son starts public school next year. And within 5 years I fully expect us to make over $100k yearly.  My salary increase in contingent upon me obtaining my professional engineering license in the next 3 years when I'm qualified to apply.  

Realistically is that still to much of a monthly payment?"
personalfinance,ff56cs9,t1_ff54shf,1579581499.0,Thanks! I'm really enjoying all this feedback.  Its giving us a really good idea of how to set our goals! We have never been good at saving but for some reason the last few months we have done a complete 180 and want to save for EVERYTHING now. It's been really freeing and exciting.
personalfinance,ff55xb2,t1_ff551fe,1579581145.0,"I definitely understand that. Ideally within 4-5years my salary increases to around $85-$95k.  My current employer told me that's around the pay I'd expect to see with my engineering license and 5+ years experience in my specific industry.   My wife plans on going back to full time as soon as we put our son in public school next year. He is hybrid homeschooling right now so she only works 10hrs/week. So I can expect to see her income increase significantly also.

I fully expect our family income to be over $100k before we decide to purchase a house."

engineering,ff2zv4w,t3_erbxxb,1579529852.0,"I've been in the HVAC industry for almost 3 years. Two years as a full-time intern and 10 months as a full-time engineer (graduated in May 2019).  I've been with the same company and great pay, BUT my issue is, I've always wanted to go into the aerospace industry.  The entire reason I left my previous career and went to school for engineering was to get into aerospace. I ended up with a job internship in HVAC because I needed a job to support my family while in school.  While I like the work and the people... I feel like I'm short-changing myself for not taking the career path I wanted. I don't want to get stuck the construction engineering industry forever.

My question: How can I utilize my current work experience & technical knowledge to at least get a foot in the door for an interview?

Boss responded by saying that it makes more sense that they are zooming into space and that we should be able to see past other stars because the telescope should be able to zoom past it?
