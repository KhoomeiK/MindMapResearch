getdisciplined,ff0cqia,t1_femx4vx,1579467613.0,Hey! Soon i'm going to release a feature that allows to set the first week day of a habit - it should solve your second problem. As of scrolling - good idea! Not sure if i make time for it in the near future but I'll keep it in mind. For now you can press the habit title in order to see history. Thanks for the feedback!
getdisciplined,ff0ayy6,t1_ferp9b8,1579467021.0,Awesome! I got the same opinion so will try to keep it minimalistic and simple. Thank you for the kind words!
getdisciplined,fektk0h,t1_fekdfte,1579207307.0,"> But now all my days are off and seem out of sync. Like on flossing it is Wednesday in the first circle. But on running I have Friday as the first circle. 

I see your point and going to add an option to reset the start of week to a certain day. Current implementation allows to start a new week any day and have full 7 days ahead to complete the week's goal. This way one doesn't have to wait for monday each time she likes to start a new habit. 

> And then if it would be possible to move the habits around it would be helpful. Like I want stretch and running to be next to each other

You can already do some moving by pinning habits to the top (use a long press on a habit in order to see this option).  

Great feedback! Thank you."
getdisciplined,feefki4,t1_fec5v37,1579032734.0,"q: How do you delete habits?

q:How do you access previous weeks? I want to fill mine in from Sunday (yesterday) but can't access it. How do you view overall progress / long terms stats

a: Simply press on a habit title and you'll see all previous weeks.

Let me know if you got any other questions."
