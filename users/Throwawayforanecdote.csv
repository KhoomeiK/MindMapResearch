medicine,ffbuyho,t1_fekr7li,1579783637.0,"Well, I don't even think we disagree other than the subjective measure of 'stupid'.  I'm probably just very harsh due to my education and upbringing.  Everyone has different measures of intelligence.    


Again, I have been thoroughly let-down and disappointed by the inability of many of my colleagues to follow basic evidence based medicine.  I don't want to be the boss of anyone and have been forced into mgmt positions as a teacher (which I hated).    


I would personally always prefer an MD over an NP, but that's because I'm not a delusional fool who trusts the system.  Every clever MD/Psychologist/Psychiatrist/Neurologist/Oncologist I have ever met will admit that the system is the primary barrier to better outcomes.    


 ""Science progresses one funeral at a time."" -- Max Planck   


I think this is even more true of medicine.  I'm just a nurse, but it is definitely still my business to know why you prefered X induction over Y or, A surgery over B.  It's never my call, but knowing why YOU made that call is crucial in the proper delivery care... that IS my responsibility.  Yet it's always a fight.    


I have never ONCE recommended, questioned or undermined a treatment plan/diagnosis/regimen.  But god damn do I get into fights trying to get explanations.  If you can't explain, don't fucking prescribe.    


Many, many RNs that I work with actively attempt to deride other professionals who look up best practice, but regardless...

I found my puppers in a tiny cage outside a small bar in rural China.  

They only had dirty water and some rice to eat and were starved for attention.   


I assumed the owner was patronising the bar.  Went back a week later and saw the dogs in the same situation.  Drank a few rums and lost my temper.  Started asking around the bar about who owned the dogs as rice is not adequate and they were not looking well at all.    


No locals could speak English and I had only been in China for a few weeks, I never studied Chinese, just picked it up as I went, so I brokenly asked around about who the owners were in a relatively belligerent manner.  Eventually, a well spoken, elegant looking Chinese woman told me, in English that she was the owner of both the bar and the dogs.  They were local street dogs and rather than setting traps or hurting the dogs (as most other locals did), they decided to cage and feed them, though had no practical knowledge of how to do so.    


She stated she was not interested in keeping the dogs and if I cared so much, I should take them.    


They were \~3 months old.  They are now 6 and have lived on 3 continents and currently live in Australia.  They are the best part of me."

It's a fine balance between fairness and efficiency.    


The real problem lies in the fact that youtube 'influencers' and sports stars and people who dance around get paid more than medical professionals... and it isn't even a problem with the system.  It's just shitty human nature.

I WANT to give you the benefit of the doubt, but it really just seems like the majority of r/medicine is just bitter, scared and using displacement aggression to avoid your own shortcomings.

Can someone please explain this to me?  


Edit 2: The fact that this has bounced around without a single decent response is a perfect indication of the problems with modern healthcare, the majority of practitioners seem to feel above educating other practitioners and patients, which is quite literally part of the job description.

You are totally missing the point.  A gun is the best SELF DEFENSE weapon in existence.  If you are a single individual protecting his or her family, numbers almost become irrelevant.  Number of firearms is more important.  If a nation was invaded (inb4 reddit children who are completely ignorant of history try to bullshit that invasions are rare or never happen) or if there was a military coup, a totalitarian regime change etc... then firearms would actually help give the people their power back.    


Brass knuckes are not useful at all for self defense.  You have to be on the attack, know what you are doing and they would be completely useless in legitimate armed conflicts.    


Also, from personal experience, people are much less likely to use a gun as they know full well the lethality of a gun.  I have personally used brass knuckles because I thought they were no big deal... they definitely are though, to the individual face, they can be absolutely devastating.  Again, useless against an invading force/organised militia though.  


I don't care about US gun restriction laws and that's not what this thread is about anyway, it's about how owning knuckle-dusters SHOULD be more illegal than owning a firearm... there ARE legitimate reasons for firearm ownership (killing pest animals on your farm, putting down wounded livestock who are slowly dying in pain, protecting the lives of your children from armed intruders).  There are NO legitimate reasons to have knuckle dusters other than wanting to cause massive damage in a fairly sneaky way to individuals that you attack with your fists."

The truth is that the human body is just about the most complex thing in the known universe, every Body is different. Just like every mind is different. And there are clear biological links between the two, compounding that individuality, if such a thing were even possible.

In the same vein, we are all biologically similar, and the differences and similarities overlap in chaotic patterns, as do the similarities.

Medicine is insanely complex and requires both intuitive skill (which isn't magic, just your mind's ability to arrive at appropriate conclusions without systematic, linear thought processes)... (Funny we accept this in athletes an artists) and training/knowledge/logic.

You have to be clever AND lucky. Doing medicine is kind of like betting on horses based on an extremely deep knowledge of horses and horse physiology. 

TV shows like house are basically shows about guys getting straight flushes in ever poker hand they ever play. 

Given unlimited time and money, I'm sure 80+% of MDs would love to properly investigate, diagnose and treat everything. 

But the game was rigged from the start. The average Joe doesn't give a shit about his own health enough to prioritise it over... Say sports or music.  

Society rewards people who play with balls or pretend to save lives more than those who do. That's just our nature. 

I live in a country WITH nationalised healthcare and this is a massive problem. The poor and mentally ill are abandoned by the system more often than not in my experience.
