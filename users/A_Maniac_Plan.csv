They said they don't have to take a *long* flight to get to PR.

Then the response implied that the only means of arriving at PR was by plane.

I pointed out that by boat was also an option.

If I were truly trying to be pedantic I would point out that planes are not the only means of air travel, they could perhaps take a helicopter or a dirigible. If you could get high enough into the atmosphere and with the proper equipment, you could theoretically arrived in Puerto Rico by a glider...

I am being pedantic in this comment, to emphasize that I was not being pedantic in my previous comments.

Have a nice day."
politics,fedicip,t1_fedhjzy,1579012278.0,"The comment I responded to suggested that air travel was the only means of reaching Puerto Rico, and seemed to be made because the parent comment had stated they were trying to avoid or limit their travel by plane.

Not trying to be pedantic, just trying to point out that their correction to OP was not entirely correct."

That the skin tone is so irrelevant to the character that it isn't worth mentioning is an idea worth exploring, but I will say that the official artwork could use more diversity."
