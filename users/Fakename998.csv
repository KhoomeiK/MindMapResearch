PoliticalOpinions,ffawpag,t3_es3awy,1579746246.0,"From the Democrats point of view, Trump and some people in the GOP congress had blocked all work towards finding facts. I'm sure you don't want to hear it but both sides are playing a political game. Democrats hear yet another instance of Trump misbehaving. This time he is trying to get Ukraine involved to smear a political opponent. Several people very close to Trump have information based on what many others close and also not-so-close have stated to be the case. This is including decorated, non-partisan, career public servants. Trump, Giuliani, and several others keep doing and saying incriminating things. Not only that, the GOP is doing the complete opposite of what it established in the Clinton impeachment and are being called out for it. They also stated that they have no intent on being fair or no intent to do anything to have the truth come out. In fact, you can argue that they are blocking attempts for the truth to come out, as many people are arguing."
PoliticalOpinions,ffavsdq,t3_ero5gv,1579745639.0,"Disagree with the idea that 2016 is more important than 2020 ""because it was what got Trump into office"". If you understand the feeling of 2016, people didn't really like either candidate. Some people voted for Trump expecting him to be something more than what he is. As of now, the people are even more divided. Those who don't like him, really want him out. Those who like him, really believe he needs a second term. The fact that people feel more strongly about his status as president indicates that this is more important.  

Now, saying it will be the most important election of our lifetime may be tough. Who knows what idiot we will have on the next 20, 30, 40 years. I'm sure for some Trump supporters, it will be the most important as they might not have much lifetime left."
PoliticalOpinions,ffav01m,t3_er4ifo,1579745119.0,"I think one difference is that the other countries have independence from the British Empire. They have the power to influence their future without being under the thumb of the British Empire. The people who claim that the US owes reparations, on the other hand, are still under the purview of US, as they are citizens of the country. The idea is that reparations are supposed to help repair the wrongdoing. What makes it important, in my mind, is that it can help those affected who may not necessarily have the power to help themselves.  

That is, at least, a distinction that makes the situation not perfectly comparable."

I think it depends on what you think ""bear"" means. I'd suppose it could mean to own and carry with you, if possible. Cannons aren't any less ""bearable"" than a nuke and people were allowed to have them. I think that invalidates your supposition of the strict definition of what ""bearable"" is."

Technology moves fast, but I don't see automation killing the work force for at least a while, still. My idea is that the jobs that can be fully automated (meaning almost 0% of those jobs need a person) will cause those workers to need jobs. I would hope that they can be trained into new jobs that cannot quite be automated. Just like people progressed in the industrial revolution. Of course, that would mean an intentional change to society where we create shorter standardized work weeks to fill more workers into a work force. I'm sure some people would fight that, for fear of progress. What we can't do is allow the work expectations to stay the same (40 hour work week) and then just let people be unable to find work. 40 hour work weeks are fairly (but not entirely) arbitrary. It'll be hard to make this change, I feel."
