Per your Wikipedia article. 

Here's another definition:

It's not about the economy or values... other republican candidates better express those views. It's specifically Trumps  xenophobia and authoritarianism that is so wildly appealing to conservative voters. That is what differentiated him from the other Republicans, who still promoted American values like freedom and accountability. Trump doesn't give a shit about freedom or accountability and he's tapped into the fact that conservatives don't either."
