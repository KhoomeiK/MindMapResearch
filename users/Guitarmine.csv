WayOfTheBern,ffa1xm6,t1_ff9wnco,1579726246.0,You can deduct VAT only from taxes to be paid so you would anyway need to have enough real business to generate profits and thus taxes to get rid of the boat VAT. Or I'm too honest and dumb to circumvent the system (and so are many of my friends in business). I know some people buy small shit like appliances etc for the company but you need a lot of taxable revenue to deduct the VAT from taxes to be paid. Maybe it works differently in other parts of the world.
WayOfTheBern,ff9rvfz,t1_ff8l0vr,1579719810.0,"As a business owner of course I know that the end customer pays the VAT. That's exactly what it was meant to do. It's no big secret. That's the first thing they tell you when you set up a business or take business lessons. And companies CAN NOT avoid paying VAT depending on what they buy. Buy a dinner for a customer you must pay VAT. Buy a dumbell you need as a personal trainer you can deduct VAT. Buy a car that you drive around yourself qnd you have to pay VAT. Buy a van that is needed daily for business deliveries. You can deduct VAT.

You can't just avoid VAT by registering a company and buy a boat. It takes 10 minutes to set up a company and if that was the case everyone would do it. I know I've done it but you are neck deep in shit if you buy items for personal use and don't pay the VAT (or you deduct the VAT you can't avoid paying it in 99% the cases)."

Suomi,fe2ddtg,t1_fe0i6st,1578837166.0,"Ei vaan jos alueellisia tekijöitä ei huomioida korkotaso on vahvin vaikuttaja asuntojen hinnoille. Nosta korko 10% ja katso miten hinnoille käy. Korrelaatio on aika välitön ja kyse on nimenomaan kausaliteetista. Jos yksin asuntojen hintaa ja ja korkotasoa katsoo se on kuin pimeässä arvaisi eläintä sen perusteella että tuntee karvoja.

Makrotalousmielessä Suomessakin olisi asuntojen hinnat laskeneet valtavasti jos korkoja ei olisi painettu nollaan. Hinta ei siis tilastollisesti reagoinut vaan korkojen lasku puskuroi hintatasoa. Korot siis ohjaa vahvasti asuntojen hintoja - mikä oli siis pointti.

Olet siis tavallaan oikeassa. Ei korreloi jos alhainen korkotaso johtuu siitä että taloutta elvytetään kun kaikilla menee paskasti. Korosta huolimatta asuntokauppa kylmenee ja hintataso ei reagoi vahvasti. Ota tuosta korkoelvytys pois ja katso miten kämpille käy kun iso määrä omistajia ei selviä lainoistaan ja ensiostajilla ei riitä maksukyky."
