Alienware,ffdz63q,t1_ffdy9x7,1579832573.0,If you’re trying to estimate how many VMs you can run and/or how many vCPUs you can provision you should only count your actual physical cores.  Hyperthreading should be enabled so the hypervisor can take advantage of it but it shouldn’t factor into any calculations.
