At the agency we used, a foster family was available to care for newborns until families were decided upon. This should be the case at any reputable agency.

But more importantly, privacy laws regarding DNA are not stringent. Law enforcement has already asked for and at times received access to corporately controlled DNA. The potential exists for insurance companies to access it to change rates based on genetic health risks. If one of these sites is hacked, extremely private data will be owned and controlled and potentially sold by unknown parties.

Adoption,fdb5whz,t3_ekhbcz,1578254145.0,"I think that in a just and compassionate society domestic infant adoption would be rare because mothers who want to parent their children but lack resources would be given them. Americans tend to be hard to sell on providing intensive social services. In general I'm not sure it's fair to expect any individual to give large amounts of resources to another individual, but I do believe it is a collective responsibility.

I would say that the industry was created by a number of parties and factors. Hopeful adoptive parents, lack of social services, and adoption agencies who market their services and make it seem like a win-win option. There are hopeful parents in every society, but the sense of entitlement to adopted children does not exist in all cultures.

In every society of course there will be a small number of babies who genuinely need families, but I agree with you that the number is artificially created in modern America."
