facepalm,feeurj2,t1_fee2ncp,1579041653.0,"That's true, significant low blood sugar has warning signs, as the blood sugar drops over time and will get worse until sugar is given. In the beginning they will get confused and later start significantly mixing up words. Nausea and vomiting occurs after, followed by loss of body control. The afflicted often appear frozen with clenched muscles struggling to control their breathing. It's awful.
 
Glucagon shots come in a red plastic box, because its an emergency situation when symptoms are that severe, it will take someone out of that worst state in a few minutes, longer if it's a significant insulin poisoning (rare). Read the instructions carefully. 

If someone can *drink* juice, then it isn't an emergency, you want to give them fast sugar and slow sugar (orange juice and a ham sandwich is a super common example, its actually suggested in the glucagon instructions)

Diabetics with high blood sugar usually feel good/positive, reaching dangerous levels is unlikely unless they stopped taking all medicine. 

Never give an unresponsive diabetic person insulin or suggest to.

What if glucagon is unavailable? If possible help feed the afflicted glucose tablets, juice (possible choking hazard), anything sugary and not a choking hazard, it depends on how cognizant they are at the time. Continue getting sugar into their system and they will improve surprisingly fast."

It was completely preventable. BoB decided to stop being deadly and start playing conservative at the exact moment they would give up 21 points in 3 minutes. All the players were confused, the choice to give up at 4th and 1 and the 10 yard line deflated the entire team and they started take it easy. Lesson of the day, don't change your game plan just because you're winning by multiple scores against the chiefs, that is the worst decision ever."

One of my curses would take hp away for each card in my hand but i was able to discard it whenever i needed to, and draw  the block cards when i needed to. That curse was fucked up, but somehow it didn't kill me and I beat the crow fast.

That was the first time that I could see I was going to get 1hp and figured there was zero way I'd survive, and against all odds I did."
