AmItheAsshole,femyp6t,t1_femx1n5,1579273001.0,"You're wrong. OP didn't pick his terrible biological family, but he did get a say in making it better and agreeing to stay with his new, healthy foster family.

If part of leading a happy life (as a result of being fucked over by his biological parents) is to distance himself from his horrible childhood then he should have that option.

The biological brother shares nothing in common with him aside from genes and he owes him nothing, not an explanation - nothing.

OP, only you can decide what's best for you. If you decide that keeping his contact details for a day when you're happy to explore that part of your life then do so, if not, then you shouldn't feel like the asshole."
apexlegends,femt27d,t1_feluduk,1579268804.0,"If they increased the level that new players play against new players (perhaps levels 1-50 they only fight others in that level range).

And then on top of that it would be nice if they only had SBMM in 1/3 lobbies that you join, I don't mind having to sweat my ass off in some games, but it would be nice if most of the time the game was random lobbies."
apexlegends,femsv83,t1_femala5,1579268644.0,"Correct, I have a 2.5 k/d and I can feel how much harder the next tier of lobbies are when I play with my friend that has a 5.7 k/d. In my lobbies I have to sweat my ass off, in his lobbies I don't stand a chance.

I respect the man for making a decision in the interest of his actual family. You need to bear in mind that his mother also went through this and had a terrible time dealing with the press, he doesn't want a repeat of this and is taking steps to alleviate the pressure on her."
todayilearned,fed9dl2,t1_fed3fkv,1579004555.0,"It's a by product of the royal propaganda though.

It's brought to the attention of the masses and kept there, this means that the public will share information like the link of this post as opposed to keeping the attention on Prince Andrew.

I'm British and there's no doubt in my mind that some of this was done to help cover over some of the scandal.

Not in a tin foil hat kind of way in that these events have been generated specifically to hide the shame of Price Andrew, but instead they came along at the right time and have been exploited to ensure that this is what the public focusses on."

gaming,fdmxf5i,t1_fdmw474,1578570137.0,"If you really believe this then you would be a terrible parent.

Equate your same reasoning to taking a child to a strip club, a child doesn't understand why people are doing what they do in strip club, therefore it won't harm them.

Moron.

Kids might not fully understand some things but their brain will take bits and pieces from all of their experiences."
gaming,fdmx4r9,t1_fdmw8iu,1578569795.0,"In an ideal world they wouldn't know about these things until they're emotionally mature, but in reality many do.

However, there's a difference between your kid hearing about these things on the playground with some small anecdote from another child, compared to your parent being complicit in exposing you to highly mature themes in games like GTA.

It's highly biased, but when I was younger it was only the kids from dysfunctional families that had parents that bought them GTA. Everyone else was happy playing age appropriate games.

Violent video games won't make you violent, but if you're already predisposed to violence due to existing behavioural issues then viewing more antisocial behaviour helps to normalise it which isn't good.

EDIT: Or it was kids with parents that didn't understand video games or what that video game contained that bought them GTA."

subnautica,fdiol62,t3_ell5cs,1578447544.0,"I'm playing on the original PS4 and recently bought Subnautica because the game has been patched a lot since release.

I'm 30 hours in and have had only 1 bug so far, and that was 1 item despawning from my inventory.

You do have access to the developer console so you can just spawn your items back in very easily and I've only had to do that once for that bug.

I would 100% buy this game, no game breaking bugs and it's very fun."
subnautica,fdinrvf,t1_fdgzu3a,1578447026.0,"It was the thing that made me realise I needed to play this game.

I love the whole premise of an ocean world with alien plants and animals, but actually being able to explore it in a submarine that you can kit out and operate however you choose just puts the cherry on top.

I picked this game up last week and its seriously the best game I've played in the last 5 years.

I'd also watched some parts of a YouTube play through of Subnautica so I had a tough idea of the plot, but for the sequel I'm going to go in blind. Cannot wait."

Next time you get an Uber/bolt, look at the fair and work out how many of these rides they'll have an hour, and then factor in the cut that goes to the Uber/Bolt company itself, and then factor in petrol and repair costs for their vehicle.

I don't understand how these people afford to live in London, they must all be living in the most undesirable places in terrible conditions - it's either that or they have must have a second job in addition."
