Foodforthought,fdsa7br,t1_fdq7mhq,1578697919.0,"Efficiency meaning how quickly and competently staff are servicing our customers. We want to balance how many calls we are taking with the level of service we are providing, with the latter being the most important. It's not micromanaging as such; it's largely up to you how you want to work as long as you are hitting a couple of targets. If you aren't then you get extra support in the form of training or coaching, or whatever else you need. 

That's why we are consistently voted 
as one he best companies to work for and for employee wellbeing."
Foodforthought,fdrtrzk,t1_fdqc9z1,1578689582.0,It's got very little to do with 'rules'. The fact that you think of it in that way clearly shows that you haven't moved on much from your own school days.

Foodforthought,fdq0eww,t1_fdpzb8d,1578648667.0,No I was in and out of detention most of the time :-)
Foodforthought,fdpyy43,t1_fdpxp1d,1578646628.0,"Yep! Happens where I work. It massively improves efficiency and is vital for staying competitive. I don't know about Facebook, but we are less concerned with toilet breaks than with just generally seeing how people are working so they can get more support if they need it. I don't think it's unreasonable that if someone is paying you to do something that they expect you do it as efficiently as possible...."

DeepSpaceNine,fdhx0ns,t3_elgk2p,1578431688.0,"I think this is a reference/tradition based on the way old ship's logs used to be recorded maybe? Originally it would have all been hand written, starting with the date but it would have all manually been done by the captain. I have no real historical knowledge to base the above on though."
AskReddit,fd12kco,t3_ejr5rg,1578126909.0,"I love how this is described as an 'african' proverb, as if that has some sort of intrinsic meaning."
