steroids,ff4lgfx,t1_ff4brib,1579566475.0,That’s exactly the reason why cause I study and most studies are natty. The reason is probably because steroids aren’t usually legal in most countries. Especially at our levels of it. :)

mtglimited,few6xt3,t3_eqqacx,1579406181.0,"I had the same issue, and on top of that I usually gave a  couple of packs to the youngest newest kids including all my loose non mythics as well.

I actually gave a few players some advice and they seem to resent me even more. So I won’t do that again, unless they ask or if I can 100% tell they will actually receive my help. 

To be fair, the regulars aren’t that bad. And I do seem to be accepted kindly by them overall. It’s the random introverted try hards that make me feel awkward. Like they may be the best at their kitchen table but here most likely not anymore.

Truth is, I actually feel like the asshole cause I am 5 times per release winner, last time I pretty much gave away every card I had minus a teferi because I am feeling bad. And honestly I don’t enjoy it anymore as I’m a competitive player, and I’m not getting what I value out the game. I go to support my friends who want company."
steroids,few56f3,t3_eqn37a,1579405554.0,"I’m so glad this thread came up! I love love studying science on routines and training. But 99% of it is for natty. 

Nippard said don’t goto failure for maximum gains, is this true for enhanced?

My best gains are at 10-15 rep range and where I get a pump. When I do tons of sets too. And even drop set. Is aiming for a pump every workout ideal?

Where do I find more routine research for enhanced people? 

Cheers! :)"

Swingers,fcor8n8,t3_ei3oqv,1577839398.0,"This may not be what you want to hear, but here’s The truth.

1. Remember, You matched with them, you took the due diligence to see if you liked them and exchanged contact. So you are or where interested, unless you lazily matched, which is your fault. But I do get sometimes interest fades away, and then you end it. So this is how you should 99% the time end it below. 

2. Why does something need to be said? you’ve probably only talked a hand full of times. Delete them or ghost, that’s what most people do, and imo is the nicest way. Saying “anything” else is almost always not going to be nicer. People are adults, telling them why you said no, never needs to be said, nothing needs to be said.  People will perceive “not interested” or no connection, as the worst possible thing about themself. They will not like you after this, your so worried about them not hating you, but that’s what you ultimately did. Ghost or delete, please! 

Now, if you’ve been swinging for a bit with a couple and want to break up with them, then that’s when you have to get nice with the break up. There’s a more emotional connection there. 

But if your back and forth on apps, and your so wrapped on if people will like you are not, you actually make it worse almost saying anything at all. 

TLDR: choose your matches wisely, so it doesn’t happen as much. And ghost/delete if it’s only been a handful of text. If it’s been a few hangouts, then yes, definitely come up with a tactful way to say it. :)"

He's not a bad player, but there are tons of good players on twitch.   
It's a shame, good streamers and players like LSV didn't make it in the MPL, but left panzies like Ondrej did. Oh well, karma and all that stuff i guess right?"

bipolar,fccntzf,t1_fca8pqc,1577600552.0,"Gonna piggy back on this. Life is an extreme gift! It almost brings me to tears on how lucky we are to be one of the billion of sperm to make it. The odds of it. The beauty of the world. The beauty we see in the world because we feel so much deeper, that others can’t see. Our creativity that others don’t have. We have the power through therapy and meds to get rid of our cons and our pluses stay here. Pluses that most people can’t fathom. This kind of life isn’t a gift shit is just plan fucking toxic bologna, that is degrading this sub into the darkness. Feel free to downvote me, but I really think post like this are just plain and utter trash."

GetMotivated,fc4p5q5,t3_eg342j,1577423485.0,"From someone who is bipolar, this is how I see it.

1. I absolute love people! Positive people bring me energy! So I may be happier around them.

2. We hurt so so so badly sometime, and seen the darkest of the dark. So when we are around people we are good at pretending to be strong and happy, to keep other positive and happy. Cause we know how bad depression can feel. 

In my opinion, you can usually see signs of manic or depression if your close enough with the person. but from my experience, 99.9% of people will ignore it, we live in an independent culture in the US. Everyone has their problems and they don’t truly invest in you. There are outliers and maybe that’s what this message says or should have said. Is, be that .001%"
