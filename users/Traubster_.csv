Watches,fevveua,t3_eqqob3,1579401946.0,"I finally pulled the trigger on this gorgeous piece after making a decade (my 20’s in this case) defining career decision. I’ve only recently been bitten by the horology bug, but I’ve absolutely fallen in love with the hobby. My first automatic (like so many of you) was an Orient Bambino. The weight, and subtle vibration of the movement immediately got me hooked. I wanted my first higher-end piece to have a similar style and feel.

I first discovered Junghans by watching Teddy Baldasare on youtube. The Max Bill Chronoscope immediately caught my eye. In the end I chose to go with the numberless option – I feel it makes the dial much cleaner and improves the overall symmetry. Another thing that surprised me was just how pearlescent the dial is. In many pictures it can appear fairly flat, bit its actually VERY pearlescent. It can be difficult to show in pictures, but its very striking.

I’m definitely a bit weary of the acrylic crystal, but man…..it really does add to the aesthetic. That definitely rules it out from being an everyday watch, but that’s OK.

No they aren't. Do they have two X chromosomes? Then no, they aren't. Thats subjectively incorrect on a scientific level. On a SOCIETAL level, then we can discuss it. I'd be happy to call a trans person by their preferred pronouns if they asked, but that doesn't magically change biological facts.

"" He did not mention that he wanted children.""

The vast majority of people who enter into cis relationships want children. We wouldn't exist as a species if that wasn't true. That was also one of MY PERSONAL requirements. I wasn't talking about OP - I was just making a point that there are legitimate reasons to not be interested in dating a trans person.

Trans people are absolutely deserving of love, and non-discrimination, but what you are talking about is so far beyond that its insane. I'd be friends with a trans person (and I've known several), but I wouldn't date a trans person.

But you asked what the specific dealbreaker was? For me PERSONALLY its that I want to have children with my partner. Biological children WITH my partner. That's important to me, and I'm entitled to that desire. But in your closed mind you think that means I hate trans people. Don't you see how ludicrous that is?

explainlikeimfive,fdl8175,t3_eluost,1578518612.0,"Former personal trainer of almost a decade here:

Because a mile can be ran in 10 minutes or less, (and 100 calories per mile is too low imo), but even with that math, it works out to 600 calories an hour. If you maintained that for 24 hours you're looking at almost 15,000 calories.

&#x200B;

You burn about 50 calories an hour just to be alive. Obviously a 80 year old woman is going to burn less calories than a bodybuilder. So about 1200 calories a day is just to keep your organs functioning. The other 600-1000 recommended calories are for basic day-to-day living for an average person with a desk job. Jobs where you are on your feet and walking all day (nurses, servers etc) probably burn 500-1000 extra calories a day.

&#x200B;

With that said, I'd be willing to say that 99% of people would burn closer to 200 calories running a mile. You'd have to be in REALLY good shape to only burn 100 calories (assuming you ran it, not walked).

&#x200B;

So if you're burning 50/hour when lying in bed, running at a 10 minute mile pace for an hour would probably burn over 1000 calories for most people.

&#x200B;

I recommend that EVERYONE forgets the whole ""2000 calories a day"" thing. Its going to be inaccurate for almost everyone. It should be a range - typically 1600-3000 depending on your age/height/weight/activity level. I'd recommend checking a TDEE calculator to get a good estimate of how much you should be eating.
