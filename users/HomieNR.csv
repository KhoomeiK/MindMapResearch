AskReddit,feuws5t,t1_fetkvlj,1579390727.0,"This sounds like a special case of sleep paralysis where you feel fully awake but see things that are not there right after waking up. I was about 5 first time I woke up and a glowing orb exiting my left ear and flew away out the closed window. I was terrified. Sinse then right after waking in the middle of the night, I have seen dragons, dead relatives, strange men, animals, and I once punched an ex-girlfriend in the face because she looked like a tiger.

The most creepy was seeing a clown in the middle of the night at the end of my bed holding his fingers 5 cm apart. Clowns are scary. But what was more scary was 15 years later I was doing some construction work on my grandmother's house. I'm 25 at this point. I opened the door to the attict, a door I have always been scared of as a kid, you know a door with that something-that-should-not-be-up-there-is-going-to-knock-from-the-other-side vibe? That door.

Looking at the inside of the door I see a poster from an 60s local circus with a freaky fucking clown in the same wierd pose with his finger 5 cm apart. It's him. 

I swear I have never been to that creepy attic before, and have never seen the poster but somehow that creepyboi snug into my sleep paralysis and scared the s out of me.."
bipolar,fdyr1aa,t3_encbw8,1578782721.0,"My take is people are stupid and don't know how to recieve the information they were just told. 

Guess if you asked people with severe OCD they would experience people saying ""oh me too, I like when things are orderly"" or some shit..

People say it to connect and for the people (with illnesses) they are talking to, not to feel 'sick' or different. It's a complete misunderstanding. It is well ment i guess."
bipolar,fdmng5u,t1_fdmks0n,1578556759.0,"""Ignored by my cat"" as it's something great! 

That made me laugh! Thanks! 

I was going to give all sorts of advice, but guess you know the drill.. instead, I wish you the best!"

nature,fcx04jk,t3_eizxvt,1578045231.0,"Cool thing is: some days we produce so much power from wind, that we have to pay the Germans to lower the productions from their powerplants so they can have our overproduction for free. Great business model!

Edit: we do the same to Sweden. Give them money and wind power. But not to Norway, they have oil and hydro power so they dont want our money or wind power. And we are planning on spend a shitton of money to build a power line to Britain so we can throw some money and wind power at them too."
bipolar,fcrqe2r,t3_eikafv,1577905220.0,"I was through at least 3 months of that (which I didnt know had a name) ending about a month ago. Plus, I had this scary feeling that nothing in the world mattered the slightest and it did not make sense to do anything.. it was a nightmare. Not like being depressed where everything is just a burden to do. I would simply not find anything interesting. 

My mood switches to a full blown hypo state for a month and I'm on the way down atm. I'm not medicated, thus cannot say if it has anything to do with medicine. I can just say I feel you and it is scary! Hopefully it will be over soon"
AskReddit,fcl7ppa,t3_ehn3ua,1577741612.0,Fucking celery juice.. it is not unhealthy though but tastes aweful. People think it's a miracle cure for anything and will suffer drinking countless liters every week for no real benefit at all.
AMA,fcfn8zk,t3_egxj21,1577631938.0,"Hi, very interesting AMA been through most of it. 

I am also very impressed with how respectful people are. 

How do you guys react when other people mistake you from one another. E.g. calling Kai, Lucy etc. Do you understand the confusion that people might experience, interacting with you?"

unpopularopinion,fbyayef,t3_ef2o71,1577212383.0,"That is for real an unpopular opinion. 

Do we set the boarder at ANY degree of mental illness? 

A man who as a kid showed slight symptoms of ADHD should not be able to reproduce? 

Is anxiety and depression, something that is treatable and most people encounter once in life, disqualifying of having kids? Do we count in factors as growing up in a bad environment, which will affect many aspects of life and can show up as mental illness in many forms like anxiety, OCD etc. 

Being bipolar, some times I cry, sometimes I do 3 times the work of all my colleagues while feeling like Tony Starks more successful brother. I earn 100k a year and am a successful engineer soon taking my second masters. Yes, my life feels tougher sometimes other times it is a breeze. But it is all just emotions. 

I respect your opinion but find it rather uninformed with a severe lack of understanding. Plus, I guess if you asked any psychiatrist they would disagree with you."

MurderedByWords,fbxwdqw,t3_ef0408,1577202237.0,"Funfact: free healthcare makes it possible for governments to make agreements with drugmakers to order medicine in large batches, making the price per patient lower. Without these agreements my little brothers 4000$/month arthritis medicine would be way more expensive. But I don't really care as my family is not the one paying. Thanks neighbor!"
