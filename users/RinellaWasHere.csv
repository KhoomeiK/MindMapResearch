imaginarymaps,ffd1o2w,t1_ffcwdx8,1579811659.0,"They know what they did.

In all honesty, the Sacardan people (in-world equivalent of the Portuguese) did have a nation on coast of the Rota Peninsula along with the three nations that modern Javarre descends from- Clecia, Tarrate, and Maneruna- but all of them were conquered about seven centuries back by a continent-wide empire, the Supremacy.

Javarre was eventually able to throw the Supremacy out of the peninsula by making a pact with archdevils, but when they gained their own independence, they didn't grant it to Sacarda.

At this point, most Sacardans have left the continent, founding Novo Sacarda across the ocean on Atta (North America equivalent)."

I haven't yet added all the terrain features, such as mountain ranges, as I haven't quite figured out their placement, nor have I denoted national capitals.  


And yes, the continent is very much based on Europe, but I've tried to make it more my own, and it's culturally quite different."

CR has been a huge draw into the hobby, and embracing it is guaranteed to sell gangbusters. I can't really fault them for it.

I'm a huge CR fan myself, but I've never played a game in Exandria. All my games are in my homebrew world. But, as usual, I'm still gonna grab the book so I can steal rules and subclasses and maps from it.
