offmychest,fe0cw02,t1_fe02ys9,1578810186.0,"Personally, I didn't really do anything about it and if I'm honest I regret it. I didn't tell anyone for a long time, didn't go to a therapist. I didn't want my family to know that I was raped, they still don't know. Basically I acted like nothing happened to everyone.

I told my bf I was raped after our first time and from then he is always really careful. I always tried no to think about what happened, but the more I tried the worst it got for me, so I try to peacefully except who I am. 

I would advice you to go to a therapist like u/empowertherevolution said, just don't do what I did."

offmychest,fdzko1e,t1_fdzhvmt,1578791140.0,"When I was raped I was 13 to 14, now I'm 16 close 17. My actual first time was almost 6 months ago, so I guess it took me 6 months of trying if you don't count the rest of the years that I didn't have any vaginal/anal sex.

Maybe the months that I was inactive played a role too, I'm not sure, sorry.

And no problem, endless love to you too."
