I'm not saying that Antonio Brown should be absolved from all of his sins here, there's a lot that needs to be made right, but he's clearly lost the ability to govern his own actions and he needs to be taken care of.

I have a friend that had a single head injury no worse than what AB suffered in that video and he went from being an intelligent and happy person (the guy is literally a rocket scientist) to having wild emotional swings and deep depression, even contemplating suicide. Luckily he realized he needed help, got it, and recovered. But healing his brain was part of that recovery.

In the case of AB, he was not like this just a few years ago. This is not just part of his personality. Could drugs be involved? Sure, but this is a guy who has been tested by the league countless times and I doubt they would overlook the kind of drugs that make people act like this."

I kept Shockers running during those years, which required constant maintenance and replacements, but I managed to never have down days and I greatly preferred the way they shot. The selling point for the Ego was always reliability and efficiency but that was it.

Then the spool valve guns caught up and it didn't make sense for the ""reliability"" people to keep shooting them. I feel like the LV platform got a bad rap, it came out when everybody had already committed to spool valve guns and I think it got overlooked. It's funny to me that as soon as PE stated they were discontinuing the LV line I started seeing more and more of them show up at the local scene.

I never would have shot an LV except early last year I had two guns go down on the same day. The bolt on my CVO literally broke (replaced at no cost in a painless process) and my M2 trigger needed disassembled and cleaned, so I borrowed my buddies LV1.5. It was so good I had an LVR bought by Monday night and in my hands the following weekend and I won't be shopping for another gun until an LV2 comes out (lord willing).

I was comparing a Spire against itself in bursts vs sustained, the sustained ROF should theoretically be faster than a Spire III in a burst. During sustained fire the Spire will actively be moving paint forward into the breech. During a burst the Spire goes from inert to active, back to inert and active again any time a shot is fired so it's actually delayed.

My tank suggestion is based on the idea that you want the right tank. It sounds like 3k vs 4.5k isn't a huge deal for you, so you don't have to go overboard. But you do want your tank  to be the right size and shape. Too long or too short is definitely bad, but I really don't like the tanks that aren't rounded off on the base. I think most steel 3k tanks are kinda squared off, and for me that would be unacceptable. So if it takes buying used to get the RIGHT tank I think it's a good move.

I recommend the Rotor because it's uniquely well suited for mech guns. It's truly force feed which means a paintball is constantly being fed into the chamber instead of waiting for the loader to react to your shots causing a (very brief) delay. Ultimately any electronic hopper should be fine, but the Rotor would be best case scenario.

You can't argue against a Spire IR or LTR. There's nothing as consistent or reliable for the money. Anything else will just get replaced while the IR or LTR will be serviceable for years to come.

If you're advocating for someone to buy used to get more gun or hopper for their dollar then I absolutely agree with you. But I do think you should buy masks new, and I think you should get the one that you actually want instead of just the cheapest acceptable option.

That Etha is going to set him on track to figure out if he wants to spend a bunch more money for the minor upgrades in another gun, and if he does make that decision the Etha will be easy to sell or trade toward whatever comes next.

I wouldn't shy away from it because of double clicking rumors, Logitech does a fine job of backing up their product so if you end up with a bad one either return it where you bought it or do a warranty claim.

But this sub has championed weight and shape for a very long time and the g502 doesn't check either of those boxes.

I like the Model O as a starter mouse. For $50 (relatively low price) you get a lightweight mouse with high performance. Great features, great quality, great company. For some the Model O will be perfect and they won't need or want to continue shopping around. For others they'll want a different shape, wireless, different buttons, different texture, no holes... any number of things they want to change. For those people, at least they only spent $50 on their first mouse figuring out what they do and do not like.

The g502 would be a poor substitute in that role. It's not like anything else so it's hard to base a follow up purchase off of it if you don't like it. If the g502 has features that you feel you must have then I say go for it. All those buttons, the scroll wheel...

The A's for three reasons. They walked away from the Manny Machado debacle blame free, as if there was a good reason to be throwing at Manny two days after the initial incident. Initiate violence and act surprised when someone responds. Manny was an asshole, but he wasn't the only one. Second, they just handed Donaldson to the Blue Jays for cheap, and I already hated the Blue Jays. Third, they're a waste of time. The A's do a great job getting to the playoffs, but they're never good enough to win. 1 playoff series win in almost 30 years? Can we just bypass the hullabaloo and send them home please?

paintball,fcwxkg4,t1_fcwp7rq,1578041915.0,"Very well done. You want to invest in your accessories early on and you've done just that, the right mask/tank/hopper/barrel will stay with you for a long time and you've got good ones. There might be fancier guns and loaders but dollar/performance you can't beat your combo, especially the loader.

The only reason you'll end up upgrading will be based on want, not need."

paintball,fcsso9u,t1_fcsroky,1577924116.0,"Gotcha. It may not be worth waiting for but I recently ordered the BK CTRL loader, after seeing one in person. I know the earliest I'll receive mine is the end of January but I really liked it. I have an R2 but it jammed at the last tournament I played (paint was soft) so I'm making the switch.

Don't know if you want to wait that long to get gear though.

I just recently bought a BK CMD. It's good you're getting your hands on before you buy. I don't have the Push mask, but I have the i5, CMD, Vio Contour, and Contour 2. I need to get rid of a bunch of masks because the only one's I want to keep are the i5's and CMD's."

Flip side, I dropped Gjallarhorn the day before Xur sold it, Icebreaker after it was nerfed, and I never got Jade Rabbit in D1. I was also stuck without a helmet drop in the Vault for an extremely long time so even though I had the good shit I couldn't get picked up with random groups."

But, the shot quality is very high. You're really not giving up anything against a cocker or other high end mech.

No better value for $220."

paintball,fcjle0k,t1_fcjhkpy,1577692415.0,Nothing special then. Just keep it indoors somewhere where it isn't freezing and it's not too hot. Keep it in bags and close them so the humidity doesn't get to it.
paintball,fcjl5ka,t3_eh7jwa,1577692114.0,"Spool valve guns gained popularity because they were quieter and smoother than the poppet valve offerings like the Ego. Because Ego's were the most popular, least temperamental Poppet guns they were the gold standard that everything else was judged by, so when PE presented the Geo2 and players started noticing how nice they shot in comparison they all switched over to spool valve guns, and Poppets went out of fashion.

Enter the LV1. Finally a poppet valve gun being presented by a mainstream company (Dye, SP, PE) that goes toe to toe with the best spool valve guns available, and isn't presented as a mid tier gun (SP Impulse). Unfortunately it was too little too late, the guns didn't sell well, PE didn't update the design to go hose-less, and the Ego platform has been discontinued indefinitely.

However... the moment PE announced the discontinuation of the Ego, LV resale values went through the roof. A couple months after I bought my LVR for $850 I was seeing them go for $1300. I played a tournament and LV's were suddenly everywhere.

I'm convinced that if PE were to simply eliminate the air tube and change the basic milling Ego's would be more popular than the Gamma Core guns immediately. I just think if it's launched at the right time and they keep the shot quality up to the standard set by the LV1.5 it could take back the market. I'd be first in line."
