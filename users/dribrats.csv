The ultimate lesson.

* CC: nothing really to say, you‚Äôre going to be fantastic and SOON. Your darks are a a bit heavy handed, try using heated smooth paper, which is better for  technical drawings. Additionally, develop those areas slowly with lighter harder pencils, then use a smudge and eraser to developreflections and shaded areas near the turbine, (maybe reflections off the tarmac) and cool tendrils in those amazing exhaust plumes, etc. . (It‚Äôs lame I can‚Äôt see pic while typing‚Äî so pardon if precoffee I don‚Äôt recall certain elements). 

 TLDR‚Äî you‚Äôre amazing. Kids today!! your darks are too heavy, try heated smooth paper rives/bfk, or vellum. With an 1.5 hours slow down, & develop with smudge, eraser, and chamois, before giving over to the DARK SIDE.
