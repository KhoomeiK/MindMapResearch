Are you insane? You suddenly started arguing that I said Flanders legally can't secede. I never said that. I was arguing that it isn't feasible for Flanders to do so without Walloon approval. I never said Flanders can't legally secede.    

And yet you replied with this bullshit:   

>And Flanders can't be forced by Wallonia to stay in Belgium.   

.  

>Totally not an attempt to dictate what Flanders can do.   

Of course Wallonia will try to influence what Flanders does. Just like Flanders tries to influence Wallonia into giving Flanders what they want. Is this news to you or something?    

>Is Wallonia the government of Belgium these days?    

They legally need to be part of the Federal government who would grant an independence referendum to Flanders. Until now, you've still not clarified which Walloon parties are going to vote in favor of a Flemish independence referendum nor why they would support such a thing.    

>Nothing will change their region.    

You claimed that Wallonia can't retain the rights to Belgium. So yes, things change for their region as they're being kicked out of their own country by Flanders.     

If Flanders wants to leave, feel free, but they can't force Wallonia or Brussels to leave the legal entity that is Belgium. Nor does Belgium magically stop legally existing without Flanders.    

>Do explain how this is me playing chicken    

If you argue:""Wallonia will give us what we want because not doing so will destroy their economy when we leave"" then you're the one playing chicken with the Flemish economy.    
After all, you're banking on Wallonia caving to your demands if Flanders does leave, but you have no guarantee they'll do that. You're just hoping they flinch before us.   

>Exactly. The UK parliament. Not the Welsh one.   

Which Federal government is going to vote in favor of a Flemish independence referendum?      

>a) Flanders will need such support   

Still wondering how Flanders is going to organize a referendum to leave without a Federal government to approve it.     

>b) such support might not be for sale.    

I'd rather not pay a King's ransom to leave Belgium. If you're fine with getting cleaned by Wallonia in exchange for leaving, I can't stop you. I just pity that I'll have to pay taxes for your decision just the same.     

>more threats of dictatorship.    

You're the one who is saying that Flanders should get to dictate what Wallonia does and doesn't agree to. I'm saying that we need support in both sides of the country for what you're proposing. But IM the one threatening dictatorship?

>And you still fail to see the irony with you constantly arguing that Wallonia should get to dictate what Flanders can do.   

Flanders is legally allowed to leave. Wallonia can't stop that, I never said otherwise.   

Whether or not leaving without their approval is feasible due to the EU is an entirely different matter.    

>Such things can all be agreed long before such a declaration of independence is made.    

Until you get me that guarantee, leaving for Flanders without Walloon approval is playing chicken with the Flemish economy. Are you willing to do that if the EU isn't willing to stick their neck out for us and instead tells us to work it out ourselves?    

>The example I keep giving is Scotland, not Catalonia, for a good reason.    

The UK parliament was on board with a Scottish referendum. Is Wallonia on board?   

>Cooperation does not require a public majority.    

How is a Walloon minority going to have the legal backing to agree to things that radically change their region?    

>Actually there are possible scenarios where Flemish independence will de facto force Brussels to cast aside Wallonia purely for reasons of self-preservation   

So you ARE willing to play chicken with the Flemish economy? I never denied that Brussels or Wallonia would be hurt by Flanders seceding, you're just willing to bet that Wallonia and Brussels cave. But if they don't, Flanders is fucked.   

Your threat of:""give us what we want or we fuck over both our economies"" only works if anyone actually believes Flemish politicians would be willing to destroy the Flemish economy just to put pressure on Wallonia.       

And before you say it, Walloon politicians don't need to do anything but refuse to agree to Flemish independence. Then Flanders needs to decide whether or not they want to risk Wallonia caving or not if they do decide to bail.    

>Again, at no point did anyone call on Scotland to seek approval from the UK-wide population for its recent bid for independence.    

The Scottish independence referendum **literally** had to be approved by the UK parliament. Scotland has no legal right to unilaterally declare an independence referendum. This is why Spain supported it, because the UK parliament agreed.   

Which would be similar to the Federal parliament declaring a referendum on Flemish independence here. Which Walloon parties are going to vote for that?

If Flanders declares independence unilaterally? It sure would. Wallonia and Brussels can't be forced by Flanders to leave Belgium. They have every right to remain in Belgium, I don't see why Flanders should get to dictate what Wallonia and Brussels do.    

>I would very much like to see one of the EU's smallest and poorest regions try to dictate policy against the wishes of the other 26.    

This isn't about policy. This is about the legal process defined for new members to join the EU. Can you **guarantee** that the EU is going to break their basic principles to make an exception for Flanders? If not, are you willing to play chicken with the Flemish economy?      

>International pressure and good negotiation with the people in charge.    

Bold assumption that international pressure wouldn't focus on Flanders to come to an amicable solution instead of dropping a nuke on Belgium without Walloon approval.    

>There are a wide variety of possible solutions to the Brussels question that don't involve it going to Wallonia.   

And all of them require Walloon and Brussels cooperation. You can't force Brussels to leave Belgium because Flanders wants to leave.    

Your entire post oozes ""we want to leave so Wallonia HAS to make it feasible for us to leave"". If the EU wasn't in play, leaving would be relatively fine. Given the EU, that in no way is true.   

You're also forgetting that Wallonia wouldn't be the only ones with interest to make leaving for Flanders as difficult as possible. Spain has got its own separatist movement and they're very keen on making it as difficult as possible for them to leave. Setting a precedent that a region can leave and rejoin the EU without the approval of the rest of that country is not something they're going to be interested in doing."

Even countries in Western Europe where not only healthcare, but college, retirement pensions, paid maternity/paternity leave, ... are all paid for through taxes, don't have a 60% tax rate.

On average, *every single* person who is very ill and needs expensive treatment will opt-in.   

Meanwhile, not everyone that is very healthy will opt-in.

If tomorrow every cent the US currently spends on healthcare were grouped together in a big pot ( poor people who get free healthcare still don't pay anything, well-off people that are healthy don't pay more taxes, ...) then the US could implement universal healthcare and save 25% cash for every patient that gets treated.
