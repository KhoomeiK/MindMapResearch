mentalhealth,ff940qu,t3_escn5c,1579704311.0,"I am currently in the process of being diagnosed (GP and therapist think I have it, but there are huge waiting times for adult ADHD clinic here). I always thought I was just lazy or lacked motivation or was worthless because I never did any work. I always got good results and behaved well in school, but I always left homework to the last second, sometimes never even doing it or making elaborate excuses. I couldn't understand how anyone managed to do the work, especially doing it in pieces, it was always all at once, like I'd write the entire essay in half an hour. My teacher feedback at parents evening was pretty much always ""good student but doesn't apply himself"" but nobody picked up on anything. It's seriously affected my mood and self-worth, but the informal diagnosis has dramatically affected the way I view things, I'm now getting help from work via occupational health and I'm learning not to beat myself up over my work pattern and instead learning to cope and manage rather than fight myself.

I have a long way to go, and I really think that medication will help me, my parents think this explains how I was as a kid. It's a shame it has taken until I was 29 for someone to even think I had a problem."

depression,feja35l,t3_epg9na,1579163598.0,"Depression is poorly understood, and there is now a lot of evidence to suggest that SSRIs don't work at all in the majority of cases. 

Best case is for you to get a therapist, but you can do other things to at least give yourself a stable base to build upon. Take up a new hobby that gets you out and talking to people, take an active class like yoga or tai chi that's also relaxing, focus on your personal development and finding what works for you. I'm afraid it will be a very slow road but with time you can get there.
Good luck bud"
pokemon,feg85rg,t3_ep07qp,1579081610.0,"It's the age old challenge to DLC of stuff that should have been in the game from the start. Adding new content isn't a problem to me, I have waited on buying SwSh to see what GF would do. I'd gladly buy a new version if it came with all the Pokémon. 
I think the new expansion pass will include a free update allowing you to get the new/old 200 Pokémon anyway which is good, frustration  would be justified in that case. Threatening people over a game however is not."

However, it seems she may end up feeling some level of betrayal based on this, but honestly she can't have it both ways, either you're in a relationship or not. Don't play games with each other, in my experience situationships are more damaging to everyone involved and cause more problems than they're worth because of the lack of clarity about what everyone wants.

My advice is to sit down and talk with her seriously about what it is that you both want, and define the relationship, but you'll need to make it clear that you slept with someone else when she said that you weren't dating."

Price is determined by perceived provenance, not necessarily actual provenance. For instance, a large bowl manufacturer could easily market their product as aboriginal, and charge far more money than the actual thing because of it's perceived value. 'its made by a company I know! It's _aboriginal_ you know! That carved bowl is just for tourists it's not _real_!"". Capitalism doesn't really care about provenance, only the perception, and even then that's superfluous sometimes. 
Art collectors are a different species, and obviously everyone has different taste, but in the end they are just bowls."
unpopularopinion,fc3jupi,t1_fc3i3jv,1577391389.0,"46% of diamond mine workers in the most productive region of Angola are aged between 5 and 16. Companies like Namdeb and De Beer Group don't have to use child labourers, because their subsidiary companies that do that for them, they are indirectly responsible for the poor working conditions, deaths, child labour etc for the mines that their subsidiary companies and companies they purchase from, own and operate. It's a similar situation with Apple and Foxconn, worker suicides and mercury poisoning due to harsh and unsafe working conditions in Fozxconn's factories are due to the excessive amounts of power a contract to a company like Apple can yield. Just because they are not a literal cartoon villain doesn't mean they're not milking people for everything they're worth, regardless of whether or not their millionaire CEOs have hearts.

No one is saying that naturally produced diamonds don't have great provenance or intrinsic value, but I'd rather not have a diamond that spent millennia being sculpted by the earth only to be dug up by an exploited, desperately poor worker for less than a dollar a day to sit in a vault for 30 years. I could have an equally cool grown diamond that has decades of research and historical significance behind it thanks to it's revolutionary manufacturing process and isn't the product of child labour."
