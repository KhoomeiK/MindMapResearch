Thank you for your kind words, even though there is no need for you to apologize since it wasn't your fault. If more people were like you we'd see a lot less Anti-Semitism. 

Education is key here, teach the kids from a young age that hate against anyone is never okay. Stop perpetuating stereotypes. Learn from history so we don't repeat it. Be kind to all."
