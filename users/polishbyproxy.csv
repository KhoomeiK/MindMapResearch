aww,fef3cen,t3_eopx3w,1579047203.0,"Public service announcement - I copied the following from this American life episode 319:

Rabies is almost 100% fatal in humans if the vaccine isn't administered right after exposure. And the '90s brought the first human deaths from rabies in the state in half a century. There have been three to date. Two of them were children bitten by rabid bats in their sleep. Which brings me to a quick public service announcement. A bat can bite you in your sleep without you even knowing it and without leaving a mark. So if you find one in a room with the sleeping person, you have to catch it and have it tested. And if you can't catch it, you should go to a doctor. I'm serious. I learned about this, it freaked me out, and now I want to tell people."
LifeProTips,fdtmcb6,t3_en0e65,1578718840.0,"I learned that I can hold the key fob next to the start button to start my car when the key fob battery dies.... Shame I didn't learn that the year it happened in the -10 freezing parking lot.
I also didn't think to remote start and warm up my car while waiting on the spare key to arrive. 
I learned that in an idiot."
AskReddit,fdqzu81,t1_fdp63zm,1578677594.0,God bless the person that transcribed that word coleslaw.  What a nightmare!
aww,fdm09o4,t1_fdlnq6f,1578536743.0,"I remember that documentary.  It was funny that they were trying to indicate to the chimp which cup had the treat by looking at it, and the lil' apes just didn't understand.  Yet the dog was like ""yo boss, thanks for telling me where the treats are!""
Also, the study where they knew the subjects eyes were closed, thus the treats were easy pickings.
I love to watch my dog try to convince me to share by looking at me, then my plate, then back at me, then back at my plate.... I'm a bad dog mom. ðŸ’˜"
AskReddit,fdca7ms,t1_fdabslm,1578270173.0,"i love those videos, and hate those videos.  It's so rewarding to see a project started and then actually completed.... then I look around at all our half finished projects and want to cry.  I feel a sense of satisfaction that my hubs & I finished the interior of our house (a builder built the shell).  There is still a ton of finish work to finish. But seriously, to live off grid is borderline impossible as real life gets in the way."

And now I need to have a word with my husband."
AskReddit,fclprs5,t3_ehsc7n,1577753504.0,"30 years ago, My Ex was joking around and kept playfully calling me ""stupid"".  He knew it irritated me, so he just kept it up all day.  ""Hey stupid, what's on TV?"" ""Hey stupid, did you see my keys"" on and on... Nothing shut him up until the end of the night when  he yelled out to me ""I'm going to bed, stupid"" and my response was ""and you'll wake up stupid too!""...
Is it sad that I still laugh about it?"
AskReddit,fcllpmr,t1_fcjencr,1577750725.0,"Awww. I live in the country and on the side of a hill.  We have a built in doggie door so the dog can come & go as he pleases.  As he aged he would have trouble walking up the hill.  The most heart breaking sound was waking in the middle of the night to his howls (he never had howled before) and finding him stuck down the ravine in the pitch dark when he would go out to potty and couldn't get back up because he was too weak.  He was too big to carry back, so I would have drive down the hill, back up to him with the ramp so I could get him home.  And two hours later do it all over again, because he forgot and went down the hill to go potty again.
I miss that dog..ðŸ˜¢"

Which explains everything."
tifu,fcjwle5,t1_fcjak84,1577708217.0,"Haha! Not me, but a friend was returning to work down the long hallway from the bathroom. Her boss loudly said ""you're showing a lot of leg there"" from behind... Turns out she had managed to tuck her skirt into her pantyhose, leaving her rear in full view.  Her saving grace is he caught her before she entered the very populated office. 
I giggled for days after she told me the story.  Karma is a birch though, as my panty incident happened a year or so later."
tifu,fchmcfo,t3_eh5uu6,1577651797.0,"Hysterical! I still recall the horrifying day when a male co-worker discretely handed me a balled up pair of panties.  I stood there baffled until he whispered that they fell from my pant leg...  Apparently I re-wore a pair of jeans and the panties had remained hidden in the leg until I sauntered across the office floor, when they made their escape.  Only to be snatched up by my eagle eyed colleague.
This was years ago, and it still cringe when I think of it.
Good times..."

I have had some pretty ""well I'll be damned, that actually worked"" moments provided by some of the least computer savvy folks."
