China_Flu,ffdpnqo,t3_esu1br,1579825975.0,"As some people here mention different industrial standard masks like N95, N99, P series or even R series.

I would like to emphasize that industrial masks are different from medical masks. An N95 is not the same as N95 medical. Medical N95 is tested and certified for block pathogens. So if you are serious enough, you may want to check the test and certification before using/ordering your masks to suit your need."
China_Flu,ffdpaq4,t1_ffcbqyi,1579825749.0,"Regular surgical masks do stop wide range of droplet infections. But if the new virus is airborne, N95 medical mask is necessary.

I also need to point out that N95 is different from N95 medical. N95 medical is tested and certified for bacteria and virus. And most of the N and P series you mentioned are not medical."
China_Flu,ffc41k8,t1_ffc3tdo,1579791009.0,I am talking about even the proper masks like N95 for medical use which is known to be effectively stop SARS.
China_Flu,ffb1xpc,t1_ff882w4,1579749748.0,"how?
I think the proper NaCl aerosol test can't be done at home without specific equipment.
I did once in a lab to figure out the size that fits me but that required specific equipment and took around half an hour.

Or you mean blow/suck air to check the pressure/seal after putting it on?"
China_Flu,ff7w6fs,t1_ff7vswx,1579659802.0,"From my observation, unfortunately, no. LOL
This kind of personal hygiene common sense is taught in every school but people just ignore.
I am also very surprised that a lot of families actually don't know when to use a fridge. They can literally just leave food outside at room temp and let the food spoil causing food wastage or poisoning."

I am checking if my stock can last for 1 year as last time, SARS outbreak was around 1 year."

HiScoreGirl,febp0pe,t1_feaxpsu,1578961170.0,"I also like his style so much. His creepy drawing style is probably related to the theme of his old manga. Unfortunately/Fortunately, his bestseller is Hi-Score of love comedy theme so maybe this is the reason why he started to change. As a matter of fact, his old drawing style and the old themes are not very popular.

And I agree with the one saying that you could try rounding her face and eyes if you want to follow the author's style."
HiScoreGirl,feawu24,t3_eo9ic9,1578953007.0,"If you read some early manga by the author, you know actually the author drew more or less like this, though his drawing is more of creepy style.

Recently, thanks to computer graphics and his improvement, his drawing is much changed/better."
NEET,feavo43,t3_eo9eeq,1578952640.0,"agree.

I also think having children is to pass on the hatred and anger of life.

I hate people and my parents so I feel fair to do it myself and pass on this 'gift'."

I even just wore T shirt, jeans and sneakers."
sleep,featpr8,t3_eo7ebl,1578952143.0,"To my experience, no.

But I think the major problem is whether or not you can fall asleep back instantly after being waken by the movt/sound.

I am probably waken up a lot due to more subtle things like my own prolong sleeping posture and I need to change/turn but I can fall back asleep instantly so I am totally fine."
sleep,fe3lybx,t3_enpava,1578850532.0,"Option 1 is more realistic to me.

I always do this to retune my schedule esp. after holiday."

sleep,fdciprt,t3_ekldmw,1578275890.0,"Hard to tell.

Seems like you have a regular sleep schedule and don't either sleep too much or less. My experience is if I sleep too much, I get headache. If you get such a regular sleep schedule, I don't believe what ASAPscience said is applicable to your situation. Some people also experience low blood pressure contributing to headache when they once wake up. Perhaps some regular exercise helps."
family,fd7e06k,t1_fd7dm17,1578203007.0,"Then, it is very interesting why does your family don't think you are heterosexual. LOL
Try reasoning with them logically, although I know this may make you sound more suspicious somehow. So don't be too serious to deny you are gay.

After all, why does they thinking you are gay matter? Are they going to introduce guys to you?!"

anime,fcvyfh7,t1_fcvd4j2,1578012952.0,"OIC!

I totally misunderstood. I thought Golem was buying stones from him instead of selling, esp. because Golem told Somari that they need to buy some supplies from the market."

Golem thinks the price is too low and then threatens the owner for what? The owner eventually gives him a bag of money?

Sorry, I may have forgotten the correct phrase to mean that."
NEET,fc4rzyw,t1_fc4qml4,1577426245.0,"So just let those dickheads judge and work on your own. People sharing similar mind will appreciate you.

And I really see what people are judging back to the topic. Someone is hungry and want to eat. He/she sees edible food that is no longer others' possession. So he/she eats it. I only see natural reaction here. It's just basically the same as I take the leftover home after some events in the university."
NEET,fc4oskf,t1_fc45llq,1577423144.0,"I don't think that's a mistake. Why people think scavenging is bad or evil? I think begging does more bad as this bothers other people. When you scavenge, you keep low and no one is bothered."

SuicideWatch,fc3cfdv,t1_fc3bmud,1577386717.0,"It depends on blood vessels. Arteries, especially big ones like carotid artery, have higher blood pressure / greater blood flow so that it can transport blood efficiently when intact. If you slit it, you know the outcome, much faster bleeding compared to small arteries and veins.

Also, if you slit the carotid artery, there will be a sudden drop of blood pressure to your brain which can cause coma / shock very soon. You don't need to bleed out completely in order to die.

Actually, sustain hanging also involves impeding the blood flow to the brain through carotid artery."
