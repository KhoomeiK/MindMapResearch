The hospital knows the insurance companies aren't going to pay the full amount the hospital asks for, so they inflate the costs to have a better starting point in the negotiations. The insurance company would probably wind up paying less than $50 of the original $500. 

The problem is: what happens when you're paying out of pocket? There's no one negotiating the price for you and you get stuck with the full $500. Most if the time, you can talk to someone in the medical billing office and get a discounted rate if you're paying out of pocket, but most people don't or don't know that is an option."
