SuicideWatch,feg0gly,t1_feg0d4z,1579071688.0,That's fair but I promise there are those of us who truly do want to help. I'm sorry you had to deal with people who did you wrong instead.

SuicideWatch,fefx458,t1_fefwg4d,1579068085.0,It does but it doesn't mean we shouldn't give advice to be aware that it's the depression clouding their judgement and that people actually are trying to help and listen.

I hug my books when I'm sad and listen to the music from my favourite games and I tell them I love them. You clearly have so so much love to give, and you have so much more time to give it. I don't know you beyond this post but your words tell me you are a deeply caring person who deserves love, I know I'm just a stranger but your post has made me want to tell you how lovable you actually are. I love that you care for your things so much, I thought I was very odd for how I do that but now I feel more understood. I want you to know that your words have given me hope, if you're anything like me, knowing that you might help someone gives you hope as well. Please don't end your life so soon. We will all die one day, it can wait. Please message me if you want a friend to talk to <3"

Showerthoughts,fdp3ty5,t1_fdozy20,1578619351.0,And these thoughts are often subconscious. We are just more inclined to pick the thing we are familiar with.
Showerthoughts,fdp3o9c,t3_emdmn4,1578619244.0,It's not just getting people to buy into the ad immediately. The viewer sees the same ads over and over and becomes subconsciously familiar with the logos and slogans and becomes more likely to think of it in the future.

SuicideWatch,fdg9cg1,t1_fdg8981,1578385625.0,"Did I suggest they be homeless? No, I told them of my experience and the risks I took when deciding if I was going to end it all or keep going as a way to be supportive and show that they are not alone. And the only thing I said they actually should do is that if they are going to make the most permanent choice you can make, the choice to die. Make a different change first. Even if it's drastic, it's better than dying."
SuicideWatch,fdg83fx,t1_fdg7twv,1578383993.0,Why are we arguing about deciding to live? If a huge change is what is needed to give someone back their hope then why not?

SuicideWatch,fdfakt4,t1_fdf2eft,1578357173.0,I understand. I know it isn't as easy as just quitting and being fine and dandy. I've been there. I was homeless for a bit after I dropped everything cause I wanted to die. Now I'm still alive and applying for Uni again after I stopped my life for a while to work on my mental state.
SuicideWatch,fdfac1i,t1_fdfa8sg,1578357009.0,Right I guess you've never had a boss tell you you will never be loved and so you quit even though you became homeless for a bit but you got back on your feet cause you left that cunt and that job behind.
SuicideWatch,fdfa24b,t1_fdf9wkg,1578356822.0,I don't think having a roof or food is gonna help if you are already planning to die. They have that now and still want to die. (I assume they have a home.)
SuicideWatch,fdf9wkg,t1_fdf321d,1578356718.0,You're joking right? The options were die or do something different.

SuicideWatch,fdeyt4c,t1_fdejrd8,1578349493.0,Quit your job before you decide to kill yourself. If you're already planning to die what's the harm in seeing what happens if you quit and try something else. It's what I tell myself to keep on keeping on.
askscience,fdbxcip,t1_fd8apca,1578263414.0,I can confirm it has been really fucking hot here. But it's not necessarily unusual for Australia to be hot. Also our fucked government isn't concerned with climate change so I doubt they are going to fund any research in this case either.
