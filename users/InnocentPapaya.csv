Also can’t understand why Aaron and David are so tolerant of Elly. I can’t recall her ever doing anything for them (or being that close even). Plus given the way she’s messed around both Mark and Chloe you’d think Aaron would be more wary of her. All this just makes me think they’re obsessed with babies I’m general."

neighbours,feue97v,t3_eqb57t,1579385681.0,Whatever happened to McKenzie anyway?
blogsnark,feue1hw,t3_eo5h0l,1579385634.0,A lot commenters use the free for all post for medical advice. Is that really a good idea (or even safe)?
neighbours,femc82o,t3_epj1bm,1579248197.0,"I’d put Harlow pretty high on the list. The character has a lot of potential with storylines given her parent issues, and the actress has been pretty good. Also Hendrix, which surprised me because I expected to hate that character but the actor’s doing a really good job of giving some nuance to the ‘spoiled brat’ character. 

Least interesting: Shane and Dipi. I just can’t bring myself to care about either of them. Just have them move to Sydney to be with their other kids. Yashiv would be a more interesting character away from them too."
neighbours,fembwkq,t1_fejgtdz,1579247781.0,"In some ways it’s safer (less likely to end up online, which is where I thought the storyline was going when Ned suggested sending photos). But yeah, stupid plot."
fatlogic,fej81z7,t3_ep3w7r,1579160865.0,How did white supremacy come into this?
neighbours,fej7qrz,t1_fei2vqa,1579160459.0,"Ah, so that’s why that scene felt a little ‘off’. I didn’t even connect that they would’ve had to add that part in later."
neighbours,fej7pca,t1_fehgue8,1579160407.0,"It’s so passive-aggressive. I mean I think it’s a terrible idea for Elly to bring a screaming baby into a house where someone is recuperating from major surgery, but either tell her to go somewhere else or quit mentioning it."
neighbours,fedljld,t1_fed1uun,1579014506.0,I don’t even know the context and I agree.
fatlogic,fe1jih4,t3_en8h4h,1578827297.0,"I’m visiting home in about 10 days (for Chinese New Year), and I’m bracing myself for comments on my appearance (because Asian relatives have no issues telling you exactly what they think).

Last year it wasn’t so bad because I’d gone from 71kg to 61kg since the precious time I was there. But it’s been another year and my weight hasn’t shifted (gone up and done around the same 3kg or so), so I’m still nowhere near my goal. It’s dispiriting enough just realising I haven’t made any progress in a whole year, but it’s going to be even more frustrating listening to their comments.

The stress makes me want to binge eat, which obviously will make the problem worse. What’s with our psychology directing us to do the exact thing that’s going to make things worse? 

Sigh. Wish I could look forward to this holiday, but right now I just can’t shake the anxiety."

neighbours,fdqf37x,t1_fdqe5o4,1578665029.0,Maybe she’s involved with Finn’s death and gets sent to prison lol.
neighbours,fdq8bnx,t1_fdq6xgi,1578659029.0,"HAHAHAHA 

Does this fit in with the other spoiler someone posted earlier about Finn going crazy and end up killing himself?"
neighbours,fdq62v9,t3_empjvv,1578656476.0,Lol! No idea if that’s true but it’d be all sorts of inappropriately hilarious.
neighbours,fdli9dg,t3_ekppam,1578524602.0,Why are they acting as if Elly’s moved to Spain? She’s still in the cul-de-sac and they can walk into each other’s houses without knocking while wearing pjs.
neighbours,fdlhxva,t3_ekppam,1578524402.0,"Given that Chloe could organise and budget a conference for over 100 people in less than a day, it doesn’t matter where the tip-off came from, she should be in charge of the whole hotel chain."
fatlogic,fdk70by,t3_eltodu,1578497521.0,"If your very long hair is endangering your health then yeah, you should cut it. In fact, aren’t there certain professions that require you to have short hair due to safety concerns?"
fatlogic,fdjf1ct,t1_fdja5pe,1578468058.0,Not to mention the 8 hours of exercise they do every day.
neighbours,fcmsg9w,t1_fck4vba,1577790017.0,I thought they were doing for Hendrix and Harlow (which would’ve been a good match I think). Not sure if they’ve dropped that idea or saving it for a slow burn.
neighbours,fc8mivj,t3_efqotl,1577537979.0,"They sometimes mention driving to/from the complex as well, so presumably long enough to justify the carbon emissions?"
neighbours,fc8meq0,t1_fc75xqm,1577537911.0,Yeah I was wondering who it the mother as well. They mentioned she wasn’t a match but surely she’d be there given he was dying and everything. (They didn’t even bother to include a ‘she’s stuck in a hurricane’-type excuse!)
neighbours,fc54fqo,t3_eegrvy,1577442628.0,"Thank goodness the whole kidney storyline has wrapped.

I find nowadays there aren’t many characters I really care about because they’re so dull. Tbh I was more concerned about Roxy than David since she’s a much more interesting character (and a much better actress)! 

The last character I really cared about was Sonya and I’m still annoyed at their decision to kill her off and give the actress no chance to return (unless she too has an evil twin)."
fatlogic,fc54ajw,t3_eg068g,1577442414.0,What is even happening in these people’s heads anymore? The arguments get more and more ridiculous everyday. No one can seriously think this way.
neighbours,fc0u9w3,t1_fbtpzeu,1577299847.0,I was surprised it sold out so fast! Those tickets weren’t cheap and the Adelphi is a decent-sized theatre too. And the promo didn’t even say who would be featuring. Guess there’s a lot of fans in London.
neighbours,fc0u2r0,t1_fby3w4e,1577299713.0,It’s not. Paul lost his leg after falling off a cliff while trying to escape from someone. The mine thing is separate.
neighbours,fbykozh,t1_fbwaag5,1577219351.0,"The way they did with Ben?
But it looks like just a brief stint, probably not worth recasting."
