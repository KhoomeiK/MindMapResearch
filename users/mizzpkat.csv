Lady, Take this beloved cat unto your heart. 
Release his spirit to the winds to seek and find a place of peace. Rest well (name of cat). I love you. Blessed be.

We had to put Buddy down this past Monday. Last Tuesday, we saw the vet and had them do x-rays to see if the cancer had metastasized and even though she didn’t see any, the radiologist who read the x-ray found enlarged lymph nodes deep in his stomach and a lesion in his chest.  The vet couldn’t do the surgery as long as his thyroid was out of whack and placed him back on the meds for this. On Thursday of last week, he stopped eating, but would drink a little milk and water, so he was still peeing. Also on Thursday, he started acting like he was coughing up a hair ball but nothing came up. He was very lethargic and spent most of the rest of the week sleeping. On Saturday, we got the news about the x-ray and she suggested we think about putting him down, and that she didn’t think he’d make it through surgery. We made the decision to put him down on Monday. He also started sleeping in an out of the way place. Late Sunday evening, Buddy actually ate some wet food. I was thrilled. And, he came into my bedroom and laid on my bed, right up against me, where he spent most of the night, something he hadn’t done in several weeks. I thought he was rallying but on Monday, when he went back to his bed, he mostly stayed there all day, face-planted into the side. As much as I didn’t want to do it, we did what we thought best. His lesion was weeping, he was walking with a limp so the leg was hurting him, he was stumbling when he tried to get up, and all his other health issues.   I am glad I made the decision to use the surgery money to do the x-rays and other tests and then some to put him to sleep.  I plan on using the remainder of the money to adopt two cats in the future - the one who has been at the Humane Society the longest, and the oldest, and/or another black cat.  As soon as my heart heals and I stop feeling like I failed Buddy.   Thank you all for your support throughout this ordeal."

Senior cats always seem to be...I don’t know...grateful and appreciative to be in a nice home. And male cats are very loving, I think more so than females.  Plus, they’ve kind of “settled” down. Anyway, good for you for giving a senior cat a home in his twilight years.   Hope you have many happy years together."

We took him in to discuss surgery, but they won’t do surgery while his thyroid is out of whack. He was put on medicine to take care of that problem this past Tuesday with him going back in 2 weeks. On Thursday, he stopped eating. Still drinking water and milk. Got x-ray reading back today from the radiologist. He has enlarged lymph nodes deep in his stomach and a lesion in his chest.    The vet thinks he won’t survive surgery, so we aren’t going to put him through that. The vet advised us to put him down, for which we have an appointment this coming Monday, if he makes it through this weekend.   If I have to take him to the emergency vet tomorrow, I will.  These last 2 visits to the vet cost us over $700.  Euthanasia will be another $150-250. I plan to post an update with this new development after Monday. Thank you for asking. I’ve been having a really rough time this past week.

I am overwhelmed by the generosity of internet strangers and the willingness to help a cat in need.   It has truly humbled me.

And a special thank you to ryanjoseph666 (or 777-I’ve seen it both ways!) for carrying it a few steps further by sharing Buddy’s plight on imgur.  Thank you for everything that you did to further help Buddy.
