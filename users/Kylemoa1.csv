selfimprovement,ff6t58f,t3_erz31j,1579634349.0,Just find an accountability buddy to help you out. The next thing is to really sit down and ask yourself if this is something you like or just like the idea of. Next ask yourself what thing will be like if you don't commit and make these changes? Look at your habits and priorities and see where on the list marks and weight fall. If you even take the time to do this you will know if you have real motivation or not. If you cant sit with yourself and really figure this out...you just like the idea.

You had plans to meet others and you decided not to go so that may have just been a missed opportunity to further connect or just have fun. Don't let how you feel currently affect shut you off from other opportunities because now you have to wait for ""the right time"" to talk to him about this when in fact it could have just been nothing at all.

Social skills can be developed over time and perhaps for you, jumping in isnt the best bet. You will need to start somewhere with just simply meeting and conversing with people until its easy and fun for you.

relationship_advice,fcstq1x,t3_eipfll,1577924866.0,This sounds pretty normal to me. It no doubt that she likes you but perhaps shes not sure how to show it or even how much she really likes you. Remember that not everyone is going to throw clear signs of interest out there for you. Give it time and let her show or tell you. One more thing is if your going to go all the things you mentioned and expect something back you are going to most likely be disappointed so do all the kind and nice thing but do them because you want to not because you want her to tell you how amazing you are and that she likes you. That will come later.
confidence,fcss14b,t3_eipikb,1577923649.0,"It just sounds like you are having a little trouble with dating thats all. I am sure you have or had an expectation of what dating would be like and it wasn't ever supposed to be this complicated or tough. Maybe you though it was supposed to be fun and it still can be. Lose the expectation, lose the idea that you are not attractive, lose the frustration and remember that dating even from the start and far beyond marriage is going to take work. That being said, take a deep breath and try it again. Remember that today is the first day of the year and a lot of people are going to be more open to things these next few months than usual so if you give up and delete everything or stop going out, you lose any chance of meeting someone.

Best of luck mate."
relationship_advice,fcsr0ti,t3_eipj11,1577922920.0,"Those thoughts you are having are your brain trying to keep you safe from embarrassment, criticism, rejection and judgment. You have to ask yourself better questions like ""what if things go really well"" I am sure you have thought about asking her out at some point and perhaps you should. Regret last a lot longer than rejection and besides, if you take the leap and ask her you will have your answer. 

Ill put it like this...its 2020, why start this year off feeling the same way you did last year and wasting all this time? Get to it mate and best of luck to you."

dating,fcspne6,t3_eipmbp,1577921935.0,"It's one of those thing you have to work through. Kind of like lifting when you others have a certain body type and you have trouble gaining or losing weight. The thing is thats all genetic but when it comes to game it can be learned like the way most people do it. I didn't grow up naturally knowing how and when to speak to women it was just something I saw my friends do almost everywhere we went and I just sort of picked it up. Sure there were guys who hand some leverage on me in other areas but you work through it and move on. If you want to be better with women and dating you have to do what everyone else does and start talking, learning and forget about the disadvantages you may thing you have."
