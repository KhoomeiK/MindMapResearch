Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fen8dcf,t1_fen82uj,1579279205.0,"Well personally, no it's easy! It's hard at first, because when you get hungry, even a bit, you reach for food, its automatic. But after day 1 it's easier. I usually skip breakfast and lunch and have early dinner then snacks later if I'm hungry. Plus I'm usually busy throughout the day, so its easier to ignore food."

If she made you uncomfortable, you had every right to act on it. I'd say, give it some time to simmer down, then call her, talk and try to work it out. If she really cares for you as a friend, she will come around."
offmychest,feh6izc,t3_ep4vsi,1579110178.0,"Doesn't sound like a genuine friend. Stop wasting your energy venting to them. I would personally start to create a distance between you two, and find some real friends, who have your back for real."

offmychest,feh50hr,t3_ep55ij,1579109272.0,"Well, maybe it has something to do with your mom being sick. Your sister doesnt know how to process her frustration and anger over the sickness, so she takes it out on your mom. Or possibly, she makes fun of your mom for all the things she doesn't like about herself. I would suggest to try and have a real conversation with your sister. Maybe with them both. You could mediate."

And you can put that love towards other people in your life. Friends, coworkers, family, etc. Eventually, give that love to yourself. Then you'll be ready for the real thing."
offmychest,feg0jy2,t3_eoyis3,1579071793.0,"Well, two things that I have done that help me personally. 
First, no relationship is perfect. Anytime a good memory comes up, I remind myself of 3 bad memories, or fucked up things he's done to me. And second, I try to remember this cheesy phrase:  if God can remove someone you never dreamed of losing, he can replace them with someone you never dreamt of having."
offmychest,feg0asi,t3_eoyju4,1579071507.0,"Instead of fixing the problem, (of why you have such low self esteem that you feel undeserving of love,) you look for men to validate your feelings of self hatred. It's not healthy, and I feel like you should really take a deep dive into those issues. No good can come from this pattern."
offmychest,feg055o,t3_eoylu8,1579071327.0,"When you've been building frustration towards a specific person or situation, and it finally hits the breaking point, it can be SUPER easy to let yourself get angered at every other thing. No matter how small. Even if on a normal day, you'd just brush it off. Try to keep the frustration where it belongs though. Its normal to have off days. And about the ortho, try to voice this in another way. You pay good money, you deserve explanations and the results you want! If you can't say it in person, try a phone call."
vegan,fefzmnp,t3_eoymzq,1579070742.0,"The biggest thing I've learned after going vegan, is that some people will never change their opinions, and you just have to live with it. Veganism has a bad rap, and you just have to see the big picture, it is growing. Despite all the bad publicity, the number of vegans is on the rise."
offmychest,fefzgh1,t1_fefzdq1,1579070552.0,"Well then maybe try to remember that. I had a pretty bad shopping addiction when I first started to work as a teen. Spend with purpose. And sometimes, I leave my money at home, or only bring a certain amount of cash. It helps."

offmychest,fefz6z0,t3_eoyn70,1579070265.0,"Listen. Getting older is inevitable. I'll be 27 this month. I feel you. But you can't change the past, and you can't turn back time. And growing up doesn't solve your problems. It just gives you different ones. One thing that keeps me strong, and looking towards the future is actually a line from kylo ren in the last jedi: forget the past. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become who you're meant to be."
offmychest,fefyzqx,t1_fefyxy7,1579070049.0,Also. Maybe apologize to the young women you hurt. It probably had a pretty serious effect on them.
