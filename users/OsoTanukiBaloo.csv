conscripts,ff592vp,t1_ff54kuh,1579583906.0,"> why did you include IPA for consonants but not for vowels

That was certainly a mistake, I'm not sure what made me decide to do that.

> though I would recommend using diacritics rather than capitalization

I used capitals because that's what I used for the font I made, and it just made more sense to me to keep it consistent.

> why does /q/ have a dedicated letter?

It's not really a dedicated letter, it's just a modification of K, and it's used in the actual conlang's script so I just carried it over. I also use it to represent /kw/ like in ""queen"" I would spell it ""qEn""

> which... isn't a vowel?

Yeah, it's not, but I had an extra vowel that I didn't know what to do with and I made this before I fully understood IPA, so I thought /j/ *was* a vowel, and it just stuck.

> I can't find /w/, /v/, /Ã°/, /Ê’/, /aÊŠ/, or /ÊŠ/ anywhere here.

/w/ is something else that I forgot to put here, /v/ is written as F, /Ã°/ is written as Th, /Ê’/ is written as j, /aÊŠ/ is also something else that I forgot to put here, and /ÊŠ/ is u.

> /tÊƒ/, /Î¸/, /Å‹/, and /Êƒ/ are the only digraphs in the script, especially since /dÊ’/ isn't a digraph.

I made those digraphs because I couldn't think of any way to romanize them other than with two letters, so I just made them modifications of the first letter of the two. /dÊ’/ *isn't* a digraph because J was a letter I could use for a romanization.

I made this script as just a fun thing for me to use, I didn't really think too much about the phonology and things, as I said, I didn't know that much about IPA at the time. Thank you for the feedback, though. I'll put it to use in Pparu (the actual script for the conlang)."

No?

I thought not, it's not a story the doctors would tell you. It's a flea legend. Darth Plagues was a disease of flea-ridden rats, so dangerous and so fast, he could use the blood stream to influence the lymph nodes to end life. He had such a knowledge of the human body, he could even kill people in three days.

He could kill people in three days?

The disease side of fleas is a path to many abilities some consider to be... all-natural. 

What happened to him?

He became too weak. The only thing he was afraid of was a cure, which eventually, of course, was made. Unfortunately, he only killed 60% of the population of Europe and the scientists found a way, then the scientists killed him in 10 days. Ironic, he could kill anyone he touched, but not the people who killed him.

Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from a rat."
