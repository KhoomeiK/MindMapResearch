""The impact of fire on site productivity is also related to intensity. While high intensity fires tend to decrease site productivity, low intensity fires can increase site productivity (Carter and Foster 2003). In one study of low intensity prescribed fire, nearly all the fire effects were limited to the forest floor and that the effects were weak. When compared to an unburned stand, nutrient pools in frequently burned stands were unaffected (P, Mg, K, S), increased slightly (Ca), or decreased (N, S). Though the N pool decreased in the top soil layer, they observed that site productivity was unaffected, possibly from increased mineralization rates in lower soil horizons. In an analysis of fire effects on N, it was found that the N pool in fuels decreased, soil N pools were unaffected and ammonium and nitrate levels in the soil increased which increased N availability. Reports on the effects of fire on soil N pools have been controversial, both because of the importance of N as it affects site productivity and because of its complicated response"""
