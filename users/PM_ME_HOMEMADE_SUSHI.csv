ElectricScooters,fedwcwj,t1_fea7kow,1579021280.0,"Hey man! I've watched a lot of your content on YouTube (you're a great narrator, keep it up!) and dug through your blog over the last few weeks. As a fellow content creator, I gotta give you kudos for being easy to listen to candidly - not many people can do that without editing.

Would you mind speculating as to what happened with the steering column/handle stalk/whatever the hell it's called with regards to having no resistance turning to the right? Have you taken that part of the scooter apart before?

I've adjusted the brakes... still not happy with it but it's the best I can do for now. I have very little experience taking stuff apart. Lots to learn. Probably should've waited an extra few weeks and purchased the 2020 model just to have that extra ""oh shit"" brake for emergencies like that. Didn't intend to go down that hill, there just wasn't any way to stop once I'd headed over the peak - it was a steep hill essentially shaped like this /\ haha"
