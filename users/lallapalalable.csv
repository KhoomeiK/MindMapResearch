If one day you went from not being able to do anything to suddenly all these things, then you might go a little overboard.  Like imagine that all in one day you're allowed to drive, drink, smoke, buy guns, and all the other perks of adulthood, you'll probably want to do them all right away.  From personal experience, I went and did all those things the day I was allowed, and I went balls to the wall with them.  Much better that I had separate days to first try them out instead of trying to do it all at once, and had a year or several between to get used to the one thing before trying something else new.

Just my opinion though."
3DS,ffddbw6,t3_estohe,1579818486.0,"As somebody who got a Switch in hopes that it would replace the 3DS, I can faithfully say it's too big for its britches to be a true portable.  I've tried carrying it around as my ""on-the-go"" gaming console but it just doesn't compare to the 3DS, and I've gone back to that being my portable of choice.  For one, it's literally too big, even the Lite is hard to carry around as it doesn't fit into any of my pockets, and even when I manage to get it in one, the joysticks are too big of a concern for it to sit comfortably.  Always holding myself weird just for it to be safe.  So portability is down, for sure.

Battery life is a concern as well.  My Lite has at most like six hours of battery from a full charge, depending on the game.  If I'm playing Civ it seems to last the longest, but big processor-heavy games like Zelda will make it four, tops.  I usually take a cross-country road trip once every year or so, and this thing would probably die before the first leg of the trip is even halfway done.  Luckily I got a car charger with mine, but I can't be sure that it'll work on a plane or bus, so it's not a given that I'll be able to stay plugged in the whole time.  Compare that to the 3DS, which I can play heavily all day long no problem, and it's another loss.

There's more to compare, but to prevent this from becoming a rant I'll stick with this:  It's a good system and I don't regret getting one, but there were some major sacrifices on the portability aspect that leave it wanting in the shadow of its predecessor."

We can sit here all day and say normalizing obesity is terrible, awful, and even actively campaign to make it stop, but that will not change the fact that it *is* normalized, contrary to the statement in the OP

I did an extremely amateur phonetic transliteration of the top characters, which is either WaRoChiI or KuRoChiI.

Middle character and bottom characters I couldn't find on any charts, maybe they combine characters for words, or have a third alphabet or something.
