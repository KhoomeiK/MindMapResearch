bettafish,ff4t44l,t1_ff3dg2b,1579571803.0,Yes! I’ve been reading about it. But it doesn’t explain how you can speed up the establishment/cycling process. I will be using rocks and filter media from a mature tank.. I think this all comes down to measuring the water’s parameters and seeing what the numbers tell me.
bettafish,ff39xjq,t1_ff33wez,1579537111.0,Yes you understood my question. What are your thoughts on tanks that use organic compost soil topped with rocks to establish the flora and ammonia/nitrite/nitrate levels?

luckybamboo,fevl0o6,t1_fevkwi0,1579398674.0,Hmm not yet :(
bettafish,fesswhf,t1_fesslh0,1579368692.0,Oh I thought all organic material produces ammonia when it decomposes. I will need to get a water test kit

luckybamboo,fcrnoty,t3_eilrns,1577904200.0,"More context:
I have three lucky bamboo plants. I basically grew up with them. One of them is dying and has a black stem but pale green top. All three always sat behind curtained window but still had blotchy leaves. It’s about time someone fixed this. What could be causing the spots? Should I repot the entire thing? Could I remove the top of the dying one and root the cutting?"
