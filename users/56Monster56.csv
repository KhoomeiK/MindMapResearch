SuicideWatch,fexk0zg,t3_eqgy8d,1579432250.0,"I once dreamed of having an orgy. That was the best/ worst dream I’ve ever had.
Because when I woke up. I had nothing but myself down the line. 

~ I have yet to experience an orgy though maybe make that a life goal ~"
SuicideWatch,feiq8e3,t1_feh83s0,1579144495.0,"Replaced, really? I’ve never asked for a replacement. I want people to respect eachother and me aswell. People who come into my life are not a replacement for others. They cannot be replaced. They just coop the pain. I know that. 

But there’s no sin in death nor there’s in life. Good or bad you can’t really put an emotion on it. There’s a plane of existence when you live, there’s also one if you die. It wouldn’t make sense if there wasn’t. 

My father is indeed asking me to live.
Why? So there’s history to be made.
To find purpose, and to help others.
Why? So important people; they also have emotions.
So they can bring another purpose in life.
The tide of time.

I know why to live I know dying isn’t a sin.
But, it’s just hard for people to understand me.
And that’s mostly why I’d give up."
SuicideWatch,fdtfxqa,t1_fdtdmvn,1578716191.0,"Also, if you say this isn't a cry for help. Then why are you hiring a hitman on yourself? You have to face the fact, that there's no real good and no real bad in this world. That hitman, has also his family.   
If you're that sadistic in mind, there are lot of other ways to hit the jacket, without hurting others. Now, yes i do know that hitman aren't good people, but some of them also work in a line of fire where neither matters. I had 2 near death experiences, life isn't a joke. Nor is it bliss. But once your death, you can't go back to the words on this page, you can't write, oh hi guyz i'm sorry for ruining other people their lives. Because guilt in the afterlife still exists. The feelings and emotions are intertwined by the cosmic interference between life and death. Y'know why we speak of hell and heaven in the same context as everyone is the same? Well, because, we make memories based on those experiences. If it's a bad memory and we die, and have a regret it adds up to the pool.  
But if you come across, someone and learn to start to forgive yourself, ""i'm not talking about other people, i'm talking about you."" If you learn yourself, to make amends to what you've done, you can learn a whole more than other people in this life. and if that isn't enough, there's a whole other simulation being a built called as in VR and it's really turning into something, if you wait, i'd say 10-20 more years, it's probably a near perfection of reality. Which i'm reffering towards; You could escape without leaving the world behind."

dating,fdp8q95,t1_fdoqjlq,1578622634.0,Even if you have to be yourself at home without leaving. It’s better than to act something you’re not. Besides you can always meet people online too. Just like you and me are conversing right now.
dating,fdop31j,t1_fdo776n,1578609717.0,"I actually get you on the part of dating/finding people. ITS SO HARD. But what I can tell you it isn’t the date itself that’s important. To find someone you have to find yourself. And from there on out, you can learn and be stronger. See it as leadership a bit more, they have to come to you. And value your life in order to worship you. Same is with dating, if you be yourself, do what you love to do, they’ll eventually come to you. To value what you’re doing. Talking is a start, but putting effort in yourself is much harder than anything in life. Even suicide isn’t as hard as putting effort towards one self. (Sorry if that was going over the top but, there’s 0 regrets in that sentence)"
socialskills,fdonmzb,t3_em8ef3,1578608841.0,"I don’t believe in that. I’ve always stayed the same honest person. And I don’t change, neither do I want to. I care hard if I see someone crying that I don’t know. You’re talking about due time, but time isn’t irrelevant towards changing one self. It’s the situations of time that does this. Otherwise there’s no progression. I appreciate the advice but you oughta know, this doesn’t apply for everyone, and even maybe only yourself."
SuicideWatch,fdjv074,t3_elpfge,1578488399.0,"Everything seems fucked anyway so I’ll give you a shot I guess. A friend who I used to talk to about everything and everything used to cheer me up. But she said I was unstable as of late. I just don’t message back anymore. How did it happen well I used to give a lot of advice to people too. Even to my dad and I got catfished in the past, which led to a fictional character being death. It still bothers me but that’s in the past. My dad used to play a huge role into my life. I always went to him and we talked a lot. I felt welcome, but now I just can’t get to the point of talking about anything to anyone anymore verbally. He committed suicide. I know his reasoning and it hurts even more knowing that even after his life it’s being trampled upon by family.. I went to school after those events and met a girl who’s interests were the same as me or so I thought. Well, I fell in love with her. and became like a couple. We made it 3 months, I wasn’t the cause. She dumped me but she was like not interested anymore in me which I understood. It felt heartbreaking at first but, I honestly wanted to stay friends. And she agreed. Then 3 weeks later I found the cold hard truth why she left me. Apparently some guy from my school was envy of us, basically broke us up. But it isn’t the main reason why I’m so hurt. 3 weeks in and she’s already going to marry him. I broke, like I get the fact that they may have a relationship with her but, marrying her in just 3 weeks time shows that she didn’t just broke up with me cause she didn’t had any interest or mutual care for me anymore. I get it? English isn’t my main language"

SuicideWatch,fdgqxnx,t1_fdgpnsq,1578406009.0,"Yeah well, that’s just my daily life routine. There’s nothing much you can do or say. I know that you have to climb out yourself and move on with it. At least there’s only one thing that stayed true to me, and that’s music. 

If you really want to help out do something that makes you happy and share that pleasure with others that way, not only you are happy, everyone is.

I’m trying to focus on school but, what truly gets me going is making music in general, writing songs/ singing them. I love it. I can converse with people but, atm I need time alone. I’m hella creative well at least I think so. It’s just the one thing that keeps me going."
SuicideWatch,fdgbv2z,t3_el73tb,1578389153.0,"Not every method is painful, overdose as example. Same story over here although mine complied with mental and physical illness. I got 2 years to live how the fuq do you tell that to someone. I don’t. I got Parkinson’s disease although Parkinson’s isn’t lethal, In most cases. Mine is just getting worsened by the day. Can’t sleep for shit. I can’t kill my self either man it just gives me flashbacks of life. It fking sucks. I’m 21, and I’m so tired of life. I just started to stand still all day just being a robot since everyone is just the same fking story. I don’t ask for you to understand or to feel sorry about me. All I ever asked in life was to be understood instead, they labelled me as an asperger syndrome of ASS (autism) like honestly fuck you. Mood changes so often now though and I feel sad angry happy energetic and then trampled upon its hilarious. I just drink monster instead fk this sleep anyway."
SuicideWatch,fdeezm9,t1_fddcuh3,1578337577.0,"I don’t know how the girl personality is but, here are some major things that could help her.

What soothes the pain is going to be a long trip. The first thing what she should do is, getting her a different environment. 

Either by, an enclosed space or by moving in with someone else who’s trustworthy. 

Or simply put, like an adoption.
I know that sounds offensive but it is better than her situation at the moment. 

Ask your own parents, or someone who’s close to her.

I wouldn’t worry too much about her school studies etc. She can pick them up later in life. There are plenty of people who don’t have a degree and are getting it later due to a depression or accident.

Second is learn her hobbies, if she says she doesn’t know anything.
Let her experience better memories.
Music is always an excellent example of experiences. And also something we can learn from.  

The better the memory the harder it becomes to wish your life away. 

I’m telling that from a personal viewpoint.


Lastly make her confront her problems.
But ask if she needs help with it. Always stay by her side, unless if you and herself know she’s ready.  

Huge respect to both of you guys for helping her. Most people don’t care about others. But you’re amazing for trying to help someone out who’s going in circles.
Last thing to note always ask her if she thinks it’s a good idea make her feel important.  It’s heartwarming to know that you matter.  And it doesn’t get said a lot. 

Sorry if my English isn’t optimal, but it’s readable enough right?"
