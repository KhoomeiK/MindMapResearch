I’m not into sports and I’m a writer so I’m always portrayed as the (sorry) “faggy” one in the group. Feels bad man. But if I say anything they just tell me “we kid cause we love”, so you really have to learn to take it in stride. Basically, if guys are breaking your balls it’s because they like you. Unfortunately people like me who were bullied as a kid have a hard time adjusting to it as an adult."

Okay now the first ten pages - I’ll get through that, introduce everyone, state the theme, describe the world - but as soon as it comes to the MEAT AND POTATOES of the movie, like the inciting incident or the stakes or the problems that they face the causes and the effects - I draw blanks for days and days and days. My brain will freeze."

Screenwriting,ffas0x7,t1_ffaoxl9,1579743140.0,Thank you for the advice. Possibly fear of failure yes. After a couple lines I start thinking why am I even doing this? It’s sort of irrational. Also I have gotten help for my mental health - part of me thinks my meds are blocking my creativity. Or it’s just stress. Sort of a stressful living situation and pretty much flat broke. I sort of think good writing is almost a luxury hobby. Like only when everything else is squared away can you relax enough to let ideas flow. Maybe that’s why I was more creative when I was young - no real responsibilities back then.

povertyfinance,febcc28,t3_eoc0hy,1578957420.0,"Don’t spend any money on anything that isn’t necessary. 

If you have anything edible at home don’t stop for takeout. Buy a big bag of lentils and eat for a week for only $10. No microwave dinners that are $4 a piece. If you can take the bus or train or walk don’t take an Uber. If you smoke cigarettes start shorting them after a few drags. If you have more than one streaming service and can survive with just Netflix cancel the other ones. No pay-per-view stuff. Make and drink coffee at home, no coffee shops. If you drink at bars fill a flask with vodka and bring it with you. Cheap vodka. Only “go out” once a week or less. If you’re dating you have to stop that. If you have kids get rid of them. 

In all seriousness, I’ve found that small things actually do add up. When I was younger I used to be of the mindset “oh what’s one cup of coffee” or “an Uber is only a few dollars more than the train”. But unfortunately I would say that to myself everyday - and before I knew it I’d spent almost $100 on coffee and rides in one week. That’s $400 a month. Now imagine all the other things I listed. You can easily spend $1000 a month on completely superfluous stuff. 

I know it’s not super original, but bottom line; start pinching those pennies.

EDIT: just so you know I’m making my way out of poverty right now as well. I have $20.06 to my name. The only things i spend money on are rent, phone, and transportation.

And another big tip - apply for food stamps. Idk where you live or how much you make but it’s pretty easy to get. I get $194 a month for groceries for just me and it helps a shit ton."
