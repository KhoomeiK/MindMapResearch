Drinking age is 21 because it was 18 for a while in a bunch of states but those naive drunk kids kept crashing their damn cars, and so it was raised.  And if we're really picking an age at which someone is truly an adult with a fully-developed brain, then we should raise the age to 25.  25 is the age by which most will have a fully-developed prefrontal cortex...which is pretty essential to decision-making/long-term planning.

Buddhism,ffckton,t1_ffcj90x,1579801590.0,">Because they are not bounded by preference/desire. 

No because they are bounded by desire.  Buddhism isn't about being reborn in a heaven as a Deva.  To be reborn as a Deva one will enjoy many pleasures and burn up all of their good karma, eventually to be reborn in a lower realm.  Buddhism is about escaping all of this nonsense completely, and no longer being reborn anywhere."
Buddhism,ffckejj,t1_ffci0t9,1579801332.0,">My understanding of Buddhism is that there are 2 main paths, arhat and buddha path.

I think this is incorrect.  There is only 1 path.  A Bodhisattva has simply followed the path and decided to remain to help all sentient beings, whereas an arhat may or may not make that decision.  

> Refering back to the OP, I just assumed the buddha path is what would get you to the higher (highest realms from an article I read about the difference between the 2 paths) realms. But there's different buddhism branches, different ideas everywhere inside and outside of buddhism. I try to not take anything or too much as solid info and I try to have my own independent thoughts and learn things for myself.

There are 3 main branches, Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.  Based on my understanding, Mahayana contains all of the same texts as Theravada as well as their own additional texts, and Vajrayana contains all of the texts of Mahayana with their own additions.  Theravada is closest to the original Buddhism and is the most restrictive.  It's all still teaching the same thing though.

>I've studied a little advaita vedanta hinduism, other religions and philosophies. In the branch of hinduism I mentioned, concentration/breathing practices and meditation are not the same thing. concentration/breathing practices are said to be of the ego, ""being busy/business"" meditation is the absence of that, consciously. (and what I practice, I consider breathing concentration practice)

Hinduism and Buddhism are extremely similar, but the language gets weird.  In the Upanishads they constantly refer to the eternal ""self""/Brahman, while Buddhism denies an eternal self.  They would seem to contradict one another, but the self referenced in the Upanishads is comparable to the Buddha-nature Buddhism seeks to tap.  Terms will be used differently in different religions, I wouldn't get too hung up on it.

Mindfulness meditation involves a focus on what is, whereas transcendental meditation involves a focus on what is not.  But the focus is the important part.

>In reference to the last part you posted, ultimately I think everything has 1 side, and 2 sides, and 3, etc depending upon what level it's perceived from. In my opinion there is only 1 spiritual path, but 2 paths within this. One where self serves self (virtual), and the other where self serves other/non-self (absolute).

So these are my own views, not official Buddhism anything:

Imagine everything we know of as reality -- the trees, people, planets, stars,etc. -- is really just a single mind which divided itself many times.  You could call our reality a ""simulation"", ""hallucination"", ""illusion"", etc. in this situation, as Buddhism and Hinduism both do.  But assuming we are all one single mind divided into smaller individuals, then the 2 paths you've just explained WOULD be 1 path.  By helping others you would be helping yourself."
Buddhism,ffc4z1m,t1_ffc3pxp,1579791646.0,">Arhat path is based on concentration in my understanding. 

Meditation is concentration (even transcendental, where one concentrates on emptying the mind), and the Arhat path is the one pretty much every Buddhist intends to be on (at least I would hope so, otherwise what's the point?)

>To will something, you must be in some state of non-acceptance, and be desiring an improved state. When you are desiring an improved state and not accepting the current state, you have ill-will to the current state. (ill-will to reality, absolute self. Good-will to virtual self, ego)

I don't think you're wrong, and think you make a good point here.  I'm not convinced that every instance of exerting will is predicated on preference, but can't conceive of any instances where it would not be.  So in the sense that all of these various beings are bounded by preference, I would agree.  But it would also kinda be like grouping every sports team together with every ballet troupe because they all require oxygen to live.  Technically they're similar in this sense, but it's an arbitrary connection as it applies to nearly all beings...not just Asuras and Arhats."

It's significantly easier to find a job when you have one already because you aren't desperate.

With shit like this, they find some technicality they can use, then selectively enforce that on predominately black/minority areas ""first"".  It's racist too, but don't act like they can actually be so overtly racist as doing it by name-sound...because they would be caught pretty much immediately.

I wasn't familiar with Haley, but a cursory glance at her Wiki page shows her vocally recognizing Trump's wrongness pretty early and I don't see anything really objectionable about her otherwise.  IDK.  The last Republican I ever considered supporting was McCain (until he picked Palin), and I was registered as neither D nor R until 2018.  But after seeing how the GOP as a whole reacted to Trump's actions...I'll never be able to vote for their candidates again, even if I like them.

Re being attacked, most people suck...especially when it comes to [group-biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity).  When you say you're ""moderate"" they see that as ""I'll vote for Trump"" and put you into that group's pigeonhole in their head.  That being said, please don't vote for Trump :X"

worldnews,fel8268,t1_fel60sp,1579216077.0,"Eh fair enough.  Re Warren, I think a large part of her problem is that she knows/thinks people are judging her negatively because she's a woman.  So she gets self-conscious about it feeding into stereotypes and over-corrects a little.  I'm not really a fan of what I've seen coming from her campaign recently (trying to manufacture a fight with America's Jewish Grandpa?!), but I can excuse it given the fact that there's yet to be a woman president...meaning there's A LOT of pressure on her to ""represent"" her gender (even though that's completely unfair).  It's a tough situation, but despite everything I think she's handled that burden better than Clinton did.  I still like her a lot, but would  prefer Sanders or Yang as well.

Anyway, you should consider registering as D so you can vote in your state's primaries.  Yang has a lot of support from former Trump-supporters and independents as well, and could actually win if he were running against Trump.  But he's unlikely to get the D-nomination without those non-D people voting in the primaries too."

Well, the perfect candidate will never come, because no one is perfect.  The best you can hope for is incremental change vaguely in your preferred direction.
