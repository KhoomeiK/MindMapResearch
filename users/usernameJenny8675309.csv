He asked several times that I just said that I didn't owe him a reason and walked away. So after reading this, I could understand how it was especially shity to do that to him."
AskReddit,ff5ogbx,t1_ff5llrv,1579603238.0,"I kinda did this to someone... Fell deeply, stupidly in love sooooooo fast. It was so wonderful, he was wonderful.

Then I met his *other* girlfriend at a party at a mutual friend's house. Broke up with him over text and was so upset that I couldn't tell him what happened. I just said that I was done. I still miss him terribly, but it's not best for me to go back and have a long, drawn out drama conversation about it.

Maybe something happened in her head that was just too much for her to deal with (not that you had another girl or anything, just sometimes, it's too much for someone to get into)?"
