TooAfraidToAsk,fegeo48,t3_eozus5,1579090149.0,"Dont know if this counts but when I was 17 or 18 and I got my first car I would drive around with my gf (now wife) and purposely get lost. I would drive until I didnt recognize anything and go 20 to 30 miles further to see if I could ""sense"" the correct direction home. This was before cell phones so it felt adventurous and we always had a lot of fun. Never had to ask for directions and always made it back fine."
