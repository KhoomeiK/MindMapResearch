cscareerquestions,fekxpvs,t1_fekk0d9,1579209770.0,"I work with two women who have elementary school age kids. One of them seems incapable of sleeping with any regularity. I'm thinking in any given work week she might get one or two nights with 5+ hours of sleep. That's after going to gymnastics, preparing dinner, helping her kids finish their homework at night, etc.... Through all of that, 5 minutes after she gets to her desk she's completely focused on software until the workday is over. I periodically look at her screen throughout the day and I never see fb, reddit, amazon, or any other distractions. She simply sits down and starts coding until it's time to leave.   

When she catches me wasting time (reddit or youtube), I'll explain to her that I waste time on the internet to get myself amped up about tackling the next C# class, SQL query or whatever else I'm procrastinating on. This does not compute for her. These women recharge their batteries in matlab, Sharepoint or whatever else they need to get done. Work doesn't seem to drain them. It seems like their family lives do that.   

As a young male, there's nothing more humbling than getting outperformed by a 40 year old mom operating on 1 hour of sleep who needs you to finish your unit testing now because she needs to leave to take her daughter to gymnastics."
cscareerquestions,fekff9m,t3_ep9jj9,1579198912.0,"I haven't been able to recover fully yet. I worked as an Engineer at a large corporation for 4 years, got burned out, quit my job to drink beer full time on my friend's porch. That lasted for a few months before I ended up taking a job in Florida where I'm currently looking forward to finishing the job so I can go back to hanging out on the porch. Last time it took 4 years for me to fully burn out. This time I reckon it'll only take a year so I'm hustling to get done before that."

cscareerquestions,fekdpoj,t3_epmg0x,1579197893.0,"4 things:

1. You need quantitative talent. In my experience, programming is simply the process of solving puzzles. People who are good at this typically excel in mathematics at school.
2. A passion for problem solving. If you're the kind of person playing puzzles video games in your free time, you probably won't mind the minutia of the daily demands of this job.
3. Honesty. If you can't be honest, you won't be able to collaborate with other engineers, which is absolutely necessary to deliver on big projects.
4. Work ethic. Code reviews and unit testing are not for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of work to deliver quality software.

cscareerquestions,fekd96o,t3_ep9y6b,1579197621.0,"Having worked as a Software Engineer for 7 years, all I can really say is that if you want to do good work in this field, you need some quantitative talent. Most IT work is some combination of solving logical puzzles and reading blog posts when you get stuck on something. Make no mistake about it. If you struggled with math in high school, this isn't a good career move.   

Once you get past that barrier, the next thing is having an innate desire for puzzle solving. Having talent gets you in the field, enjoying the process of solving puzzles means you might actually be excited about going to work everyday."
econmonitor,fekajrn,t1_fek8zvq,1579196023.0,"Right, but if I suspect that more men are becoming stay-at-home dads, I would like to see a strong uptick in family care for the middle age bracket. If you check page 14, she breaks down the percentage reporting non-participation as a result of family care.   

 In 1996, you have 12.7% of men ages 25-34 not working for that reason. In 2016, that percentage goes up to 14% in the same bracket. This is the age bracket that corresponds to when most people are raising young children.   

If you look at older non-participating men, you can see that the percentage jump for the 45–54 bracket is 6.3% to 11.2%. So this is the largest increase in the age groups but this isn't a stay-at-home dad. This is someone supporting an aging parent, or perhaps a disabled spouse.   

Keep in mind that the overall increase across all age groups is only 3.8%."

There are also multiple [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ekin47/the_x1_extreme_gen_2_critical_keyboard_flaw_in/) about it on this subreddit. I would expect someone who reviews laptops professionally to have done a little bit of legwork to investigate manufacturing defects.

He talks about how Anthony Bourdaine committed suicide in a Hotel room in France, despite being one of the most successful chef's of his time. He then described a childhood friend who was admitted to law school on a scholarship, got married, and ended up back living with his parents working in retail.
