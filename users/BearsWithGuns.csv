tifu,ff04adw,t1_fezo1pa,1579465044.0,"Because men are stronger than women so it's much more frightening for a woman to be groped by a dude (in most cases) because they can't physically do anything about it. It's obviously equally as bad for it to happen to a man but it is usually less physically terrifying and more emotionally terrifying (it can bring up bad past relationships, it can make the man feel helpless or emasculated, what if she tries to claim I raped her? Etc). So you can see why it definitely has a more pronounced effect when it's opposite genders involved. If it's just two dudes or two girls, they can usually just laugh it off because there's less physical difference between the two and not as many emotions wrapped up in it. I can't speak to how someone who is gay would feel, but they're a much smaller percentage of the population; outliers so to speak.

Also, TSA security seems fairly ineffective anyway so it doesn't really matter."
funny,fet3iau,t1_fet0wo2,1579371461.0,"What I don't get is why OP leased a (presumably) new or fairly new car. A $2000 used car will go a long way if you know how to spot a good one and do some repairs yourself. I'm not saying you can't buy anything nice when in debt, but just seems wierd if OP is that concerned about money. I'm a year out of school and there's no way I'd buy a new car. Having a used one and fixing it occasionally myself helps me save money."

What do you think most shops use? Because I guarantee they're not buying this several hundred dollar contraption which requires specific sized belts. You can get varying disks and grits for grinders and they're more common, cheaper, and probably wont break when the shop meathead goes to use it.

However I concede that this tool would be good for acute corners on railings that aren't getting powder coat, etc. Pretty specific case but hey that's the name of the sub I guess."

Just the person OP was talking about, which you'd have to be bonkers to think that's a mentally healthy way to live, if OP is telling the truth. I have no harsh opinions of sex work. I don't think it's the best long term career but it can help pay the bills I suppose. Sex work can be healthy or unhealthy. Depends on the person whose involved in it and for what reasons they're involved.

I find it funny that your comment paints you so transparently as a person vying for moral superiority while trying to lecture me for virtue signaling because you misunderstood what I was saying."

While it's not ideal, I can understand doing it on the side to support a larger purpose like college, trade school, growing a business, etc. But if the only thing you're working at in life is swindling sad, pathetic guys for cash, I just think that's a stupid shallow path to take.

Living off your looks teaches you that life is easy. You don't have to learn any life skills or anything that benefits you in the long run."

Unless she's fine living without those things which is fucked in it's own way.

At best she's shallow and misguided. At worst, she's a hollow shell of a person. Either way, not the kind of life I want to live."

facepalm,fd5urc3,t1_fd5a6li,1578181747.0,"No one is saying the lowest employees dont have responsibility. Just that the bosses have more responsibility and your comment didnt disprove that. You may be responsible for the 30 or so students in your class but the principle is responsible for however many hundreds of students are at your school plus the jobs of the dozens of teachers that work there. Your wife is responsible for the patients she treats directly, but the chief physician, for example, is responsible for pretty much every patient in the building at any time.

I agree with you that sometimes corruption runs rampant and needs to be punished. That's the job of our government. Look at the 2008 financial crisis though. The government bailed out the banks and let things like laundering for the cartel go without jail time (I'm not kidding - HSBC was laundering money for the cartel, fully admitted it, and no one faced jail time. I think the only punishment was a fine to the shareholders). 

CEOs deserve to be paid a lot for the value they offer to the company, but they also deserve to be thrown in jail when they do things like launder money for the cartel."
facepalm,fd5t5s0,t1_fd5nei1,1578181216.0,"You're acting like management isn't real work when in fact management can be extraordinarily more difficult and impactful than a single labourer. I can see how people have become dissolutioned in management and the heirarchy of the workplace though. The rise of bureaucracy has led many organizations to fill seats for the sake of filling seats. Something, something Parkinson's law. But regardless, good management is crucial and organizations need to retain good management in order to be successful. Unskilled labour is disposable. That's the unfortunate reality of it and I don't think it's inherent to capitalism. It runs deeper than that. Labourers are like the engine of a car and management is the driver. I can replace the engine with any other engine as long as it's physically capable of doing the job and there is no rarity of engines to do the job. There's tons of existing ones laying around and they're pumping them off the assembly line everyday. But you cant just replace the driver unless they know what they're doing. A very good driver, one who has knowledge of the car and can control it in the worst of situations, is hard to come by."
woodworking,fcwytyr,t1_fcsj801,1578043528.0,"They work on 22 gauge. Sometimes mine slip a little, but I believe there's still room for me to tighten them up more to work better with 22 gauge. I just dont use them much for that seeing as the pair you sent are usually fine for 22. These ones can come in handy for larger wire where you want a consistent stripped length, have a lot of wire to do, or just want to be able to strip quick and easy with minimum effort. Plus if you have a bunch of different wires, you dont have to mess around finding the right gauge. Basically it's for the lazy man and it works great!"
woodworking,fcoikdm,t1_fcocckr,1577833095.0,"Personally, I like this type because they adjust automatically to any wire gauge and they're easy to use:

woodworking,fcl31mc,t1_fciycid,1577738722.0,"If this was your first attempt at wood working, then I'm extremely impressed and you should have no problem soldering. It's easy af but everyone has their own way of doing it. The way I recommend is getting the iron nice and got (~750 F for me) and using a good smear of flux on the wires. That way you can melt the solder onto the tip of the iron and then touch it to the wires and it's a done deal. I find that way to be much quicker, cleaner, and with a better connection than trying to heat the wires and feeding the solder in at the same time. Though that may still be necessary on big connection but not for what you're doing. Anyway, buy wire strippers and a cheap iron and try it out. Once you know what you're doing, soldering speakers will take you like 5 minutes and can be enormously helpful in fixing basic electronic things that would be expensive to replace otherwise."

Also apparently me_irl mods were crazy controlly and had an agenda but maybe they're fine now? Idk. But for example, they don't allow trump memes, but then there's Bernie meme in hottest right now. I'm tired of political bullshit too but it just feels like maybe theres an agenda going on. Not to say Bernie is as edgy as Trump is though. 

Make up your own mind. Sometimes meirl is better. Like for example I hate this post but other people like it so you do you yknow."

EngineeringPorn,fcjpehp,t1_fcjnca9,1577697956.0,"This effect is caused by supersonic exhaust gases being overexpanded (having a lower pressure than the surrounding ambient air), so I don't think size of the stream would make a huge difference as long as the design was scaled to Reynold's number. 

The problem would be in manufacturing an engine that could accelerate gases to supersonic at that scale."
EngineeringPorn,fcjp1om,t1_fcjn8gj,1577697448.0,"Nothing's perfect. An aerospike still has its limits and no engine is designed to work ideally AGL where it spends the least of its time. Also shock diamonds are caused by ambient air pressure being higher than the pressure of the exhaust gases, which is a mechanism that the aerospike relies on. 

The high ambient air pressure compresses the exhaust gas, essentially funneling it. In a supersonic flow this will increase pressure and decrease velocity, which causes the flow to go from supersonic to subsonic. These principles reverse for subsonic flow, the pressure thus decreases and speed increases as the gas expands again and the flow reaches supersonic. This is repeated causing multiple shock waves which form a standing wave. With mach diamonds, you're essentially seeing standing sonic shock waves caused by localized regions of super and subsonic exhaust. 

It is basically a discontinuity caused by a higher pressure outside the nozzle which is not allowed to flow into the lower pressure exhaust zone because the exhaust is supersonic. However, in extreme cases, the ambient air can ""peel"" the exhaust gases off the walls of the nozzle and creep its way toward the choke point along the boundary layer at the walls where net flow is zero.

That's at least my bachelor's degree level understanding of this complicated phenomenon. If someone has a correction go on ahead. I just think supersonic flow is cool but it's hard to find good learning sources, so throw some suggestions out there too if you have any."

I worked for hydro not oil and gas but replacing a generator is upwards of 100 million for the whole contract. So whatever equipment it landed on could have been easily 19 million to replace.
