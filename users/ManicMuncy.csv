But then you realize that the human you made loves you so much and is so freakin' obsessed with you that their whole world ceases to exist when you're behind a closed door - and give them pity cuddles after you wash your hands ‚ô•Ô∏è"

AmItheAsshole,fejp19u,t1_fejkvrm,1579182109.0,I kinda like it when a post leaves me thinking that *she* wrote this as *him* but from her own perspective (obviously). the people seeking validation around here almost never paint themselves in such a bad light.

AmItheAsshole,fehx1f2,t3_ep88yt,1579125560.0,"NTA. I understand that they're trying to claim a tax credit, but *hell no* to giving them your info (which would be your SSN in USA). In addition to forcing the need for you to also file  and pay taxes, it is also putting you at Major risk of identity theft/fraud by putting your SSN in the wrong hands.

They hired a minor under the table for sub par wages. Fuck 'em. No tax credit for that. 

For all intents and purposes everyone is better off to not open that can of worms."

HumansBeingBros,febci4v,t1_feb74jk,1578957473.0,"Those hats at Walmart were between $2 and $4 (depending on quality) around Thanksgiving and whats left of Christmas stuff is approx 90% off right now. I doubt he paid more than $50 for all those. Even if Walmart loses some change on each of those hats it's okay because of how much profit they made on the ones that were sold at MSRP. 

Retail Economics *are* weird. And fucking accounting. ( 12 credit hours *by hand* before I was allowed to take the easy-peasy automated class? FML, man.)"

I hope one day you know the sense of  comradery that our OP feels right now, anime that you always be blessed with the lack of first-hand knowledge of mental health. I would not wish it on anybody, not even assholes like yourself."
