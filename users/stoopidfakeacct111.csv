GetMotivated,ff27ati,t3_er4mxv,1579495859.0,For real all the personal stories from r/narcissisticabuse helped me more than I can ever express.

AskReddit,fes2lsv,t3_eq9k9o,1579360769.0,"Coolio came to play at my college. It was raining, so they stuck him in our cafeteria with horrible acoustics. Everyone yelled, “gangster’s paradise!!” until he played it, at which point everyone left. I felt super bad for him."

datingoverthirty,feoy4pl,t1_feonrdx,1579307916.0,"Ouch. Gross! Sorry you went through that. I was “fortunately” only married to a legit diagnosed narcissist for a year when it all went to shit. He was previously married and she cheated on him and was batshit crazy, so the story goes. I’ll never know the full picture and I don’t want to. Good riddance!! Hope you find the loving, respectful relationships you deserve!!"
datingoverthirty,feoxh5j,t3_eq3466,1579307510.0,"My take is

A: trust your gut. If it doesn’t sit easy with you, it is okay to honor that. 

B: imo I deserve to be with someone who is at my level. I have never cheated and never considered it or felt the urge to, ever. There are 8 billion people in the world. It’s not unreasonable to want to be with someone who has held themselves to the same standards you have."
painting,fen7qv8,t1_femuhfr,1579278815.0,Exactly. I would read it!

TrueOffMyChest,fek4xnm,t1_fejzk5w,1579192693.0,"A friend of mine was asked by a friend to knit him a complex, custom sweater. She said, sure, for the cost of yarn plus $300. He was shocked and tried to barter. She came back and said $400. He researched and eventually agreed. 😂"
TrueOffMyChest,fek4qsk,t1_fejh26h,1579192577.0,"I acknowledged this in the first sentence. I am capable of looking outside myself and empathizing with others, and I understand that people have good intentions, but I can still feel annoyed by it. Lots of people say hurtful shit all the time with a well meaning heart, and we are taught as children to suck it up and accept it to avoid making anyone uncomfortable. It’s a bunch of shit. That’s why I’m in true off my chest. Other examples:
-When people are depressed and people say “Look on the bright side” or “I know exactly how you feel” before launching into a story about themselves. Clearly, they are trying to help. And sucking at it. 
-When you make a good habit for yourself like daily exercise and someone says “you know you don’t HAVE to go every day.” Again, I can see the well meaning intention but what is communicated is a dismissal or your efforts and that they know better for you than you do. 

To literally say, “holy crap. That is such nice work I would pay for it. Your art has a unique style,” is different than “the next step is to turn this into work” and then PUSH it when you say nope. It communicates that your time is only valuable if it generates income. It communicates that your self care time is not important. It again communicates that this is somehow a group decision and they know better than you. It is dismissing and insulting."

starterpacks,fdtsywd,t1_fdqcrov,1578721720.0,Can also confirm. Abusive narcissist exhusband told me he was a class clown growing up. Also dropped out of college. So many red flags.

GetMotivated,fcmgvi0,t3_ehw7e1,1577774782.0,It’s an hour til my birthday after a very recent divorce. Was just feeling a little down and opened reddit for some distraction and this was the very first post that popped up. Thank you. It’s exactly what I needed to hear right now.
AskReddit,fc2w616,t1_fc2l591,1577375647.0,"As someone who got divorced after about a year, can confirm, it is horrifying. Sooner the better to be free from someone who doesn’t love or value you."
AskReddit,fc2vy6x,t3_efqzp6,1577375484.0,"Per tradition, I watched While You Were Sleeping with my mom, and she erroneously told me that Bill Pullman was dead. She had confused him with Bill Paxton. I’d like to thank google and wikipedia for clearing the air and calming me down."
