bipolar,feasgla,t3_enyftw,1578951857.0,I was worried about going back whether I would be successful or not with being on medication.  Happy to report I made all A’s last semester!  My only advice is to take it slow.  I started with two classes then added a class with each semester.  If you work make sure to balance your schedule and give yourself enough time to do schoolwork and rest.
