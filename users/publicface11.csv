HumansBeingBros,fev5awd,t1_fetzffb,1579393272.0,I make quilts like this. They often help the grieving person move on because it gets the dead person‚Äôs clothes out of the closet without just giving or throwing them away. It provides a healthy way to have the person‚Äôs things around.
news,fencwxp,t1_fen77et,1579281999.0,"Forget about the science, sending your child to school with the flu is just downright cruel. The flu makes you feel like shit. I can‚Äôt imagine trying to pay attention and learn with a high fever. What horrible people. 

My daughter‚Äôs best friend at school comes from a family of antivaxxers and I have an infant. So thanks for that, idiot antivaxxing mom, because of you I need to tactfully explain to my tearful five year old why she can‚Äôt have play dates with her bestie outside of school."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcoltun,t1_fcnudna,1577835472.0,"Mine too!! I‚Äôll be agonizing over whether or not to get more fabric and he always is like ‚Äújust get more fabric, honey, what are you worried about?‚Äù"
AskReddit,fck2kn6,t1_fcjjug4,1577714677.0,I‚Äôm an ultrasound tech and stuff like this happens every so often. I love going to talk to the doctor like ‚Äúguess what????‚Äù

politics,fcczggl,t1_fccsqxn,1577604495.0,"That post was so upsetting. Clearly the adult mother was a terrible parent and person, but goddamn. If someone did that to my five year old I would murder them."
hockey,fc777ym,t1_fc6ety2,1577499389.0,"I‚Äôm a transplant to North Carolina (grew up in Minnesota). It‚Äôs absolutely correct that the roads are awful down here when it snows due to the lack of infrastructure - no salting the roads, no plows. And it‚Äôs true that most people can‚Äôt drive in the snow. 

But it is *simultaneously true* that southerners lose their god damn minds about even the idea of snow. The public library in our town was closed once because there was a small patch of ice in the shaded portion of the steps leading to one set of the doors. It was sunny and temps were above freezing. Most of the steps were clear of ice, and the other entrance, which was in the sun, had no ice in the walkway. I watched in disbelief as three men came out to tape off the doors with caution tape and then place a closed sign on the other side. It was among the most ridiculous things I‚Äôve ever seen."

crafts,fc626x8,t1_fc5hz1i,1577470592.0,Your work is lovely and you have a talent for working with fabric color and placement!
crafts,fc5ayvr,t3_efrlwy,1577451615.0,"For everyone amazed at this quilt, check out other art quilts! It seems like a lot of commentators have a very limited view of quilting, which I did as well before I got into it. While I don‚Äôt wish to take anything away from this gorgeous piece or its talented maker, if you like this quilt, there are many others that are very similar. It is truly amazing what some quilters can do with fabric."
MomForAMinute,fc5ako7,t1_fc4ns5c,1577451165.0,"She‚Äôs almost three months old and my older daughter is five. How about yours? Having a second is definitely challenging, but seeing my big girl become a big sister has been incredible. The baby loves her so much - big sister gets all the best smiles!"
MomForAMinute,fc4amkc,t3_eg0q1i,1577411177.0,"Sis!! My daughter had her first laugh today too! I thought my heart would explode. She was laughing at her big sister, which made it all the sweeter. Parenting may have its lows, but its highs are amazing."
politics,fc2u5xd,t1_fc2lkgy,1577374131.0,I live in NC and I just get mass emails from my congressmen promising to do the exact opposite of what I asked for them to do.
todayilearned,fc2tr4k,t1_fc2njpm,1577373795.0,I could barely stand to look at the parts of the videos they showed. So awful.
todayilearned,fc2tj6t,t1_fc2s4i9,1577373614.0,"Dismembered the body and played with the severed head.

Edit for slightly more detail: he filmed himself killing a man with a screwdriver painted to look like an ice pick, then dismembered the body. He also filmed himself murdering cats."
bestoflegaladvice,fc2l750,t1_fbx3ry4,1577365650.0,"I live in rural North Carolina. Few evangelicals in my experience would see what LAOP is experiencing as him being bashed or demeaned. They would see it as the boss trying to help LAOP by leading them to God. I‚Äôm an atheist and I‚Äôm very careful with that information. The closest I‚Äôve come at work - I work in a large medical practice - is to suggest to our manager that we might want to avoid playing Christian music since not all of our patients are Christian. My coworkers were completely shocked that anyone might take even mild issue with religious music. The religious privilege that is displayed in this part of the world is quite large, despite evangelicals‚Äô belief in their persecution."
Instagramreality,fc1cq3h,t1_fc0nrth,1577314849.0,I turned off the NSFW filter out of curiosity and was really surprised at how much smut was suddenly on r/all. It‚Äôs just nicer with it on in my opinion.
todayilearned,fbzz6dk,t1_fbzhaxv,1577269783.0,"My husband and I started doing this a few years ago when the meme started making the rounds, even though we knew it wasn‚Äôt a real Icelandic tradition. It‚Äôs a wonderful Christmas Eve activity - a deep breath once everything is done and we can just sit and enjoy the tree and our new books."
medizzy,fbzymm3,t1_fbzw8gt,1577268861.0,"Yup! Wild, right? But if a baby doesn‚Äôt breathe the fluid into their lungs, the lungs won‚Äôt develop correctly and the baby won‚Äôt be able to breathe when they are born. They do it quite a bit as well - after 32 weeks we expect to see a fetus perform at least 30 seconds of breathing in a 30 minute time period."
medizzy,fbzt0ts,t1_fbysn3c,1577259980.0,"Yes, they do drink their own pee. In fact, the fetal kidneys are responsible for producing the fluid around the baby. Kidneys make pee, baby pees it out, then breathes in and swallows the fluid as part of normal gestation."
pics,fbjr5p6,t1_fbjlsvb,1576938647.0,"I‚Äôve known several firefighters who are total douchebags. The difference is that there‚Äôs not usually the opportunity for asshole firefighters to use power for evil the way there is with teachers and cops. It‚Äôs just the different nature of the job.

Edited to clarify: ALL firefighters aren‚Äôt douches, obviously. But they‚Äôre not all shining beacons of selflessness either."
