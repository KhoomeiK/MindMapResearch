AskReddit,ffee8t8,t3_esy81b,1579844752.0,"So, I'm in the army, doing tour work up. We're doing this big night attack, probably around 100ish people attacking a little plywood ""compound"" village thing at the base of this hill with bad guy targets on sticks all over the place.

We have this firebase, basically a platoon of just machine gunners, on the ridgeline of the hill looking down at this and I was  on the  assault force, 90 degrees to the guns.

The  plan was  we'd get to this little treeline nearby and hunker down, the machine gunners would open up and we'd get up and run in and a paraflare gets launched when we're close and all the  gunners would swing fire left and pepper the far buildings while we clear the close ones. Another flare goes up when they're clear and we advance into the far buildings and all the gunners stop.

So, the time hits and all the machine guns let loose. We bust out of the treeline and my platoon is in an extended line and we're all running full sprint towards this village. We start getting close and the flare goes up.... 

All the machine guns go quiet for a second as they shift over except one guy who fires one last burst into the center  of the village. 

That  burst  had  a single tracer and plain as day  ricocheted off the ground in the center  of the  village and  flies straight into the air and **smashes** this flare dead on as it was still flying upwards and the fucking thing *explodes* in this giant firework.

Everything just **stopped** instantly.

A word wasn't spoken or a round fired for probably about a full five seconds. Nobody moved. The whole place was completely silent.

A gunner near the far end of the firebase shoots a tiny burst into the far side of the village and couple seconds later a couple other guns  join in and  we stack up and file  through our building but the whole attack was surreal after that. No yelling, we all just went through the motions, took our building, consolidated and walked back once it was done and almost no one spoke until we got back to the admin area. No one could believe it.

Wtf are the chances that with that one last burst of 3 or 4 rounds that a bullet would strike a rock on the perfect angle to take that flare out, as it was rocketing itself into the sky, and the round  that did it was the fucking *tracer* so we'd see it happen."

worldnews,ffcehbf,t1_ffc936l,1579797719.0,"Lots of joke responses and ridiculousness getting replied to you but seriously: bandages. Duct tape makes the best field bandages.

Snugly wrap a clean piece of cloth folded into a wide band several times around your injury. Wrap duct tape over the cloth, keeping it tight. A bandage without pressure is just a blood sponge, duct tape will keep cloth bandages tight.

You can tie your cloth bandage off into a knot but now the knot is applying more pressure to the area it's over and you don't have equal pressure. Can also produce circulation issues, as well as being able to loosen off on you over time and can slide around, disrupting your clot. The tape avoids this.

Duct tape will hold the bandage securely for a long time  without creating pressure points. Always remember after applying a bandage to check circulation below the bandage too! If you can press into the skin below the bandage and flesh colour doesn't return to the area immediately, your bandage is affecting circulation. This is especially easy to visually inspect in nail beds, press  on a  finger or toe nail and make sure the pink comes back. Loosen off very slightly if it doesn't, pause briefly for bloodflow to resume, and check again.

The more you know :)

I'm Canadian, east coast. My kid is 7 and his afterschool care is across the street. They go and get the kids and walk them to the place. They're  age segregated, have a fenced off playground out back for when it's nice and they do little lessons all the  time. They  open at 0700, close at 1730 Monday to Friday. They don't do meals, but  they provide snacks like fruit and juice and little things. Story time and group games and crafts most days. The daycare put  on a little Christmas concert this year, it was super cute. All three age groups(they only go to 12 there, there's babies and toddlers/young elementary kids/grade schoolers,  I don't  know the actual age windows) did a song.

It's 400 for the month or 120 a week, I think. I split it with the ex and it's $100 a pay.

Most daycares around my area are 30-40 a day and 20some for in home and others have longer hours, which would  be  nice  because sometimes I have to be at  work *early* and it's a pain in the ass, but ours  is cool and he  likes it.

There were watchdogs there and had been for years. The IAEA has spent over 3000 man-hours days annually  in the supervision of Iran's nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency consistently reported that they had been following the parameters of the deal and  no reporting from them had ever demonstrated that they'd enriched uranium over 4%. You need an enrichment of over 90% for uranium to be applicable for weaponry.

In 1989 Iran had a plan to produce a nuclear  weapon under the AMAD program. This program ran until 2003.

>In a 2015 report named Final Assessment on Past and Present Outstanding Issues regarding Iran’s Nuclear Programme, IAEA assessed that:

>""a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities took place after 2003 [but] these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences and capabilities. The Agency has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009"".

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMAD_Project]

The nuclear deal, put together in 2013, restricted the amount of heavy water that Iran could hold. The nuclear proliferation treaty states that countries have an inalienable right  to nuclear power and  heavy  water is a by product of nuclear power production. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action limited the holding capacity of Iran to 130 tons  of heavy water because of its use in the production of plutonium. Iran had been selling its excess heavy water to Oman.

In 2018 Israel cited the AMAD project as a breach of the JCPOA. The world said that the issue had already  been investigated and concluded but Trump sided with Israel.

America threatened Oman with sanctions if they  continued and said such sanctions would apply to any other nation that received heavy water from Iran. Oman stopped storing Iranian heavy water.

Iran did not shut down nuclear  power production and informed the IAEA the day they breached their heavy water storage capacities. Trump backed  out of the deal. Some childish shit talking on the internet later and now we're here.

**The justification for all of this has been bullshit the entire time.**

Trump forced Iran to either cease  nuclear power  production or break the deal. Iran had been following the JCPOA and refused to stop power production. I hope you enjoy your war."

AskReddit,fcwun3k,t1_fcwcgfe,1578038314.0,"The army has blank firing adapters because the gun doesn't work otherwise. If you fire a normal AR with a blank, it won't cycle, it needs the back pressure the bullet being pushed provides to cycle the action.

The BFA contains the pressure inside the gun, initially, except what's lost immediately to the ejection port. It's why they make your gun so fucking dirty.

Yeah...I guess the Army is glad we don't get burned as much, but not *that* glad.

The pressures are way more fatal than the heat as well. You can embed cleaning rods into trees by musket loading an assault rifle with one and a blank. They'll disintegrate apples and oranges into smell and dust if you put them against the muzzle and pull the trigger. 

Shit would turn your brain inside out if it was  against your temple...and  yeah,  I guess if they'd burn a bit from a distance...but it's really not more dangerous than some sparks. You can't even light dry leaves on fire."

worldnews,fchrism,t1_fcaseqw,1577653337.0,"He's not wrong. Population density and overcrowding don't really have much to do with each other. Yes, India has  a lower  population density than England,  you are right. India has a very different situation though.

India is very poor with a massive wealth disparity between it's urban and rural areas. People with pretty much nothing are moving  into city  centers but have to live in very  very poor neighborhoods where they live, literally, on-top of each other.

They can't afford to live outside the cities and  commute because that requires a reliable vehicle and roads that function. They can't live in rural communities because  there's  no work. So many of them find themselves in slums, with thousands and thousands of others, with nowhere else to go. 

It's why you often see those iconic pictures of hundreds of people riding on top of trains. There's too many people and they need to get into the cities to work to support themselves and their families.

Overcrowding and population density are very different beasts. It's not that they don't have room, it's  that the places with  the room don't have  work and the places with work don't  have room."
