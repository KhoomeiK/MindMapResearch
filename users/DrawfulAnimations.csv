Labor Day Weekend, 2013

My family went to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, and we were there for a couple of days. The first day was fine except for my dad almost getting bitten in the face by a venomous snake, but the second day was a lot worse. We were going on a hike down a trail that ran adjacent to a stream and some waterfalls. At the second waterfall, the path branched off the main one and was a series of switchbacks with rocks that you had to either jump or slide down every dozen feet or so. My brother and I were a bit ahead and about halfway down the hill when my stepmom decided that she didn’t want to slide down the rocks. Instead of taking the trail, she started walking down the loose gravelly hillside, then sliding, then falling. She hit the bed of the shallow and wide stream, popped up on her feet and said that she was ok. My dad, however, noticed the blood flowing from a rather large gash on her leg and yelled down to her that she was not, in fact, ok. My dad ran down the switchback trail past my brother and I and went to help my stepmom. He told my brother and I to go up onto the trail and ask other people if they could help. We found four people who helped carry my stepmom very precariously out of the riverbed and onto the trail and two people who contacted the park ranger service and an ambulance. My dad was able to carry my stepmom up to a fire road where she sat across the backseat of the park ranger’s car. He took her to the road and got her in the ambulance and on the way to the hospital. Another park ranger car with a trailer took us up the fire road and one of the tires popped on the way. The park ranger then drove us back to our campsite where we packed up our stuff and headed to the hospital. My stepmom's leg was somehow not broken, and she only needed a ridiculously large number of staples to close the wound."
