For me, depression is intense apathy and hopelessness most of the time. I just don't care about anything, and therefore behave impulsively (e.g. skip lessons just if I don't feel like going) and don't care about the consequences. I feel so  numb; the only way I feel happy (and feel like the person I am underneath all the mental illness) is through alcohol. I want to isolate myself even though I enjoy spending time with friends because having to face anyone is often just too exhausting. I spend as much time in bed as possible, and wouldn't get out of bed if I could. everything has lost any enjoyment it once had; at the worst of my depression, I don't even feel pleasure eating or listening to music. 
Also, most depressed people don't experience this I think, but I also can't really express emotions, especially positive ones, resulting in my face anyways looking empty and my voice being monotone as hell (didn't used to be)."
