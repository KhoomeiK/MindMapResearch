nihilism,fdv8cv1,t3_en6evo,1578744517.0,"I have been going through the same things recently. There is no point to things, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do the things you like to do. Even if it’s small. I like to enjoy my coffee on the patio while listening to the rain. 

I still find myself judging others, people who run around to try to get someplace they think is important. It’s not, they don’t realize it but it’s still important to them. I think that’s the hardest part for me right now.

But give it time. You’re currently in the “everything is pointless so there’s no use in doing anything” stage, it seems. You’ll transition into a more freeing stage soon. Use this subreddit to help you with that, but you’re going to have to sift through the overly depressive posts.

I hope this helps. Safe journey, my friend."
nihilism,fcnjf5q,t1_fcnep02,1577812836.0,"Thank you! You’re absolutely right, it is easy to get stuck on a “why bother” mentality. We try to make sense of things that don’t, and we try to put meaning to things that have none. But we need to realize that it’s okay that these things don’t matter, and it’s okay to just exist.

Have a safe and Happy New Year, friend!"
nihilism,fcndtha,t3_ei264v,1577809610.0,"Thank you for this. I have been struggling for quite some time, and have been thinking on this for awhile. I know I am on the right path, and that’s the first step. I’m getting to the point where I am about to switch gears, going from deep despair into acceptance. It doesn’t matter, but I’m alive so why not enjoy things? Getting the help I need to start to enjoy the things I once used to. I am a negative and cynical person, but accepting that nothing truly matter is strangely freeing."
ActualHippies,f7b7oa1,t3_dv4p24,1573559777.0,"Absolutely. Hippie is a state of being, not dictated by the clothes you wear or the objects you have. It does not discriminate age, either. I have been told before that I’m not a hippie because I did not grow up during the 60’s... I was taken aback by that statement."
