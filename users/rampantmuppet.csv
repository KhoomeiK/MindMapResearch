Smoke in general causes *low oxygen levels* and chemical asphyxiates can cause changes such as confusion, fogginess, fainting, and decreased alertness. It's not just the THC in plants that effect you. *That's* the difference between smoking bud and vaping bud.

What kind of vape hurts your lungs? Max settings? My portable pax isn't string enough for that effect, and water pipe after a vape sounds like it would've helped you out back in the day if that was the case."

unpopularopinion,feitae2,t1_feisqa2,1579146640.0,"Did you use a small portable or home kit? High or low temps?

Anecdotal: Personally i think smoke in general causes my body(naturally hyperactve/ADHD possible) to relax too much(limits oxygen intake), so the anxiety kicks up because i don't have that ""ready energy"" on hand that my anxiety needs to be as aware as im used to. Vaping small doses retains that energy im used to, so it feels familiar therefore not debilitating, which does not cause anxiety."
