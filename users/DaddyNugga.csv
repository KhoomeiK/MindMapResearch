depression,ff826cw,t3_erzknp,1579664029.0,"My God, I didn’t know this was such an issue here. Look, I recently came upon a post of how that photos of you or people close up do not accurately represent what people look like. The farther you are from a camera but you enhance the zoom, that’s what you look like in perspective. Just because you aren’t content with the way you look doesn’t mean you should bash yourself. What do you get out of it? Nothing. One just lowers their self esteem for no reason. Quit fooling yourselves otherwise, people who go into acting are chosen and prepped to look perfect. Sure, all types of people act and do shows but the major ones use people of beauty. It’s just the industry. They get all types of surgery sometimes to make themselves feel better or look better and it results in people fanning over them. Just because you aren’t Scarlett Johansson doesn’t mean you’re ugly by standards. No one is ugly, it’s all a matter of perspective. Society morphs our way of thinking into what we perceive beauty to be. Beauty, should be what YOU think of it, without bias from shows and etc. What actually looks good to you is what should matter, not because the actors skins are flawless or they’re so fit. Don’t stare at yourself in the mirror, you should use it to see what you currently look like. Not for staring at the little pimple on your cheek or the zit on your nose, you make it worse for yourself by altering your brain to base what you look like from that zit to the rest of your face and you make yourself feel ugly. There are 7 billion people and counting in this world in where than i’m pretty sure at least 6 billion if not the 7 billion (excluding the millions who look “flawless”) would be considered ugly by society. Don’t let society’s hormones and gaze towards certain features of a person’s body define what you need to look like. Do what you think makes you feel good and keep yourself excluded from where people in society would call you ugly. They do it to make themselves feel better about themselves. Surround yourself with others like the people in this thread who are comfortable around you and don’t view beauty the way society does. You can’t change how society operates based off of beauty, but you can keep yourself out of it to make your life more healthy for yourself. Please don’t let others bring you down! They aren’t the ones who define ourselves. We are who we make ourselves out to be at the end of the day, not the people who have no manners and can’t take their mind off of physical features they like."
depression,ff8127r,t1_feqc06k,1579663210.0,"😭😭so tell me what the hell keeps you going then. let the people who do take peace in it. what the hell is wrong with you to convince others otherwise? i don’t care for your opinion, you’re no alpha male for not believing in souls, let people who do and understanding in it come to terms with it. I didn’t say we aren’t just our brain, i meant in a way that feels like it but at the same time i do mean souls and etc. Whether or not you’re religious makes no difference, this is a subreddit meant for depression, not to bash on other people’s beliefs and ways of coping with depression. and let me tell you something, the trick works. i like facing reality too, this is my advice for others because they can’t face it like us. honestly, i don’t know what the point of you saying all that was for, because it seems to me you’re just boasting about how you’re stronger because you find a more realist way to deal with depression."
MuslimNoFap,ff80k8s,t3_es1yhu,1579662853.0,hey do you have an iphone? i’ve been thinking of keeping contact with somebody to stop us from our urge. i can text either way but iphone makes it easier is all. dm your number so we can stop each other cause i’m tired of this damn sin making me relapse
depression,feohpeb,t1_fehcea4,1579300371.0,"And you make it seem like that it’s impossible to stop it. With realization to the fact that your brain is the reason you feel the way you do sometimes or makes you think you have multiple obstacles in your life when there aren’t, helps you come out of that void of nothing. Just because scientifically the brain is what controls us, that doesn’t mean we don’t differentiate between what part of our body controls us. Some people think their soul and heart are their guidance for personality and their brains keep the body going. Nobody connects the emotion they experience to their brain causing this issue. Don’t forget that we don’t even have access to our full potential within the brain and nor can we control our cells. I find it easier to blame a part of our body that is a part of us, but we don’t think it controls us entirely. Being a realist doesn’t get you anywhere in life, unless you’re a businessman/woman and it still doesn’t help even then. You gain nothing from seeing through all the “lies” made to make one feel better and in fact make yourself feel worse and believe there’s no purpose to anything. You’re human like all of us, so don’t let your opinions on certain issues be your own downfall."
NoFap,feogiis,t1_feog5o6,1579299851.0,thank you! i’m proud because i almost did it earlier this morning but was interrupted and i knew i would have trouble since my hormones peaked and i would be more aroused but turns out there’s about a .01% part of me that’s decent!
depression,feoecvi,t1_fen3r0s,1579299013.0,"And it’s that hope to believing that maybe you’ll find something new to spark interest and desire in you that brings joy. To believe it’s fully gone and impossible is not a path to self salvation, it’s the path to letting yourself and wanting to die. I wish you luck on your journey to get there and i’m glad you chose to stick to trying it anyways! Send out updates when you feel progress coming!"
depression,feg8jl3,t1_feerrl6,1579082164.0,"I think it’s because despite the OPs answer, his father consoles himself with the fact people DO have it worse out there. He may think that he’s being a pussy and needs to appreciate things more because he doesn’t have it that bad so it may be a reason why he told him the same thing."
depression,feg8c7v,t1_fefvl4k,1579081865.0,"I think our brains make our depression seem so comforting after being with it for so long that it convinces us to take satisfaction in causing ourselves pain and facing death. Reality is that it all sucks ass and death and pain are not quite as fun as they seem and the pain just causes us to face an existential crisis because we make ourselves think we deserve the pain when we actually don’t. Despite anything and everything you’ve gone through, you’ve had a purpose up to this point to live, don’t let your brain make you think otherwise just because you feel like to!"
depression,feg846y,t1_feeso4y,1579081549.0,"Hey man, you know that isn’t a fair question for you to ask. It is more than likely that any person would choose a stranger to die than someone they have a close bond with. Did you know that as much as we like to call ourselves heroes, we would never do the things where someone would actually need help? We’d call others while running off because it’s human instinct to stay alive and everything else follows after. I’m sorry that you’ve had a very rough childhood it seems as you were very much neglected and people would rather save face than help those in need. Look, as for your friends, don’t think too much of it. Despite how you may think that they don’t care for you or don’t have time for you, truth is they do. The worlds a complicated place and it seems you know that because your parents couldn’t get straight to helping you. Your friends may have their own preferences or some may just not have the time even if they wanted to hang out, they have their own priorities as much as you. And don’t expect everyone to stay true to you, if there’s one thing most of us can relate to out of this, it’s that we’ve dealt with backstabbers as well. People will always come and go, but there are always those certain few who stay. If there’s anything that should mean anything to you, pay attention to how none of us would rather you end your life early. I know that’s the cycle of life but it’s not supposed to be up to us to end it when we want. We all care and as you can see support you in this process because not a single human being should go through this. There are times when I feel I have no one as well. But that doesn’t mean I don’t, i’m just so blinded by my thoughts and sadness that i convince myself that no one is out there for me. Same goes for you as well.  Despite all the countless examples you can give me of how people aren’t there for you, at the end, that’s your conformational bias. You ignore the moments in which the good outweigh the bad with the people who truly do care for you the most. If anything, this sounds like you could be a future success story. A man who came out from his past, who has gone through the worst punishments of the modern age, and yet he finds some will to live and be famous and rich. Your dream only ends when you’re blindsided by your depression and anger. Think back to before those terrible incidents happened to you. There must have been some dreams you had at that point. You were a child, naïve to the worlds issues and focused on yourself, so there must have been things you wanted to do. Why not work a job and travel? The only way you can find a will to live is if you let yourself find that will to live. There are so many things out there that could inspire you, possibly convince you to move there. Don’t let the people who didn’t give you a choice to control your future make you choose one last choice for yourself. Just because you don’t want to live doesn’t mean you shouldn’t live. Your memories may not be something you want to remember, and I can see why, but all we can do is move on. The past is the past, and it isn’t always what defines us. Would you let the abuse be what defines you or would you rather make your own choices without anybody who prays on your downfall looking over you? I pray you don’t let your past be the end of you and that you will search for those reasons to continue, those beautiful little things that matter.  Adopting a child and raising them the way they should be could be of interest. Bringing those out of pain and suffering so they will never have to go through anything close to what you faced. Take your time to plan your life out, everything ahead of you can be in your control if you let it. at the end of the day, our lives come to be what we shape them out to be. you may have had your choices taken but now is your time to clear your head, do some self-focus and get rid of the toxicity in your life, set up a schedule that you LIKE where you go outside and interact with at least one human being for a couple hours each day, and take the time to get back on track and do the things you want. But i’m telling you, suicide isn’t an answer, it’s the wrong choice. You could have won the lottery the next day, spend the money on necessities and kick back and travel or do whatever you want. You could still turn out to be a nobody, but you’d still be yourself with the accomplishments that you worked hard for because you deserved them. I WANT you to have a better life because this is rock bottom it seems. Don’t let yourself stay stuck in that hole, the only way you have from there is to move up. Take care of yourself and find your way, for the sake of all of us. I’d be heartbroken to hear that you passed because all life is precious, no matter how much people try to tear you down and shred you to pieces. All love from here, be safe and we support you as a family. Reddit is here when you need us the most. Especially me. DM me when you need anybody to be comforted by or anything at all."

NoFap,feci95h,t1_fec83lk,1578974559.0,i know that helps but my issue is that i have strict parents and can’t do anything without reason and i’m only 16 so i can’t just go out whenever even for walks or something
depression,feaqxza,t1_feamoep,1578951420.0,"hey it’s alright, i don’t hate people who are depressed but i hate their mindset. and it’s not y’alls fault but the only way i can do anything is try to help people see through their problems. i just want to make everyone better because depressions a bitch and i sure as hell don’t want anybody being controlled by it. I know this honestly isn’t a very good moral answer, but i’d say you use that hatred and change your major. Enter the avian field and control flights or even be a pilot. If you want more impact, go into politics and make your way up. Getting control and a major voice in the government can really help get things going in this country. Use that hate to help guide your voice and take the power away from the rich in our government. the system is designed by us to help us, yet we are constantly ignored as taxes that save businesses and make it hard on consumers are put in place to save the rich. put your emotions and energy to good use and do some good in this world. if you feel like everything in this world sucks lately, than take the time to make some good yourself. even if you don’t have a major impact, you’ll still gain some traction and you’re doing it not only to help yourself but those who need the help. i wish you well in life and i hope you come to a place where you realize there are certain things that are very dumb in life and most of them are included with depression and don’t ever let yourself fall into a rut and think you can’t get back up. don’t kneel over and die in the hole, the only way to go from there is up and it might be hard and you just want to drop, but not only would that hurt you a literal and metaphorical sense, you’d accomplish nothing. so take as much time as you need, sort your life out, tell your brain that you need these things done, tell it that the things you find hard the most are done by others everyday of their lives, and you will hopefully be in a much better place. lives are lives at the end of the day, our connection makes our bonds to people special, but all we can when they pass is get to know more people. that may make it sad when they pass, but you’d have got to known them and experience maybe more avenues of fun with them. hell who knows, they may be your life partner or end up getting you where you need. at the end of the day, our birth rate is higher than death and all that fresh new life and those bonds that will come to be will hopefully help one make mends with their past and come forward to their future. i hope 2020 treats you well and do not blame 2020 for not doing so if you’re the reason things go sideways, analyze why it did, do what you need to avoid it, and continue. humans are flawed beings and we always make mistakes for better or worse, doesn’t mean we should take a look at the worst mistakes and stop in our tracks. if we’re at least going to die, don’t let it be of depression and what it leads to, let it be from something natural or maybe us not being the top species anymore. sorry went into a little sci fi :)"
depression,fe8wgwd,t3_eo1usb,1578931838.0,Are you serious? That’s the dumbest thing i’ve ever heard. Who makes fun of somebody for having a part time job? My sisters are about your age and have one as well. Nothing bad about it.

depression,fdyhnni,t3_en7336,1578779906.0,"I think this just attributes to the fact we have no feeling in our bodies to work towards something. I think it’s more we just live in the moment, but we aren’t apart of it. It’s okay to feel this way and I think that over time or with the right people that you’re surrounded by, this feeling will eventually fade away. I think when you start to experience more things that make you smile or laugh or snort coffee out your nose is when your feelings will come back to you. That’s usually the time when we feel a little more alive and want to work towards things. Do you remember anything you wanted to work towards before you felt like this? If so, continue working towards them, don’t let your laziness and comfort in how you feel stop you from still doing things entirely!"
depression,fdm7tcf,t1_fdm7n1a,1578541926.0,"No problem, I worry most for those who have fallen into this. I know you all struggle so much and especially with the things you could have done before this but chose not to takes a strong will. Don’t let it burn out! You’d only convince yourself that you truly have nothing on this planet for you when really, you never took the time to see what you had available at your disposal!"
depression,fdm6ao8,t1_fdkzq40,1578540841.0,I dislike how people feel there’s no love for them. 7 billion and counting of people on this planet you have never met and do not know. There are people who will love you for everything you are. All it takes is for YOU to take the steps in the right path. Don’t let your mind convince yourself that you’re the only one.
depression,fdm5wq8,t3_em2l33,1578540571.0,"I understand why you feel this way. All that fresh new life ready to embark on a journey that they thought they could see. Life’s like that. Tears us down when we give another chance to our happiness. But that’s what makes us human. Coming back from that bottomless hole. Learning to tolerate this pain and frustration. I know that when one starts to feel this way, it’s hard to see anything but death and suffering. That’s the thing though, we as humans HAVE to learn that we have time limits in this world. It doesn’t matter how you spend it, depressed or anxious or joyful or prideful, we all come to face our fear of leaving this world when we don’t know it. Their lives can never be replaced nor can that pain be fully mended. But what can we do about it? Why should we let our emotions topple our mindset? The things we were looking forward to before all these terrible situations shouldn’t just disappear. There’s no point in wasting your life grieving over it all and being lazy and regretful of not doing what you wanted to back then, do the things you wanted to before your time limit comes. Believe in some religion or not, the former helps you cope with this pain and the latter makes it harder to renew yourself but if you do, it makes you a hell of a strong human. Those who passed wouldn’t like to hear that you’re sobbing uncontrollably over their loss, they’d rather you do the things they couldn’t. Emotions are just an obstacle that humans face all the time. Our world isn’t even as terrible as it was back then. I find it somewhat weird that we have more people who are depressed and suicidal than back then, with fear of being raped or killed or robbed or tortured to the worst extent. We have the easiest lifestyle in all of history, and it’s led to our own downfall. Finding nothing to do and occupy ourselves with or stressing over doing an important and well-paying job gives those dumb mental illnesses. I know it’s incredibly common to hear “live your best life”, but keeping yourself down out of your own will is your fault. I don’t expect anyone with depression to know better and just magically turn it off, but we look at these god awful events more and more and come to the conclusion of how life is meaningless. We face existential crises and believe everything is hopeless. I ask you, why? We fall into societal norms that we need a partner we can love because we aren’t sufficient for ourselves. Sure, it’s nice to have someone to be with, but quit looking at the things you don’t have. Maybe you’ll have these things yourself! But you can’t find a meaning to life if all you do is tell yourself that life is meaningless because you’ll convince yourself that it surely is. reaching for your goals despite your obstacles is not impossible nor is it difficult, it depends on if you actually want to get there and off our lazy asses. Personally, I believe our emotions are an illusion meant to dissuade us from what we love and that life is a scam. Of course, we’ve made it to the point that it is, but having that which we love taken away to stop our tracks is something I won’t be dealing with. I refuse to let such things bring me down because I could drop dead right now and still be dissatisfied with my life. There will and are always things out there that will try to make us feel like shit, but the choice is up to you on if you want to dig yourself into that hole. Stressed about your grades? You know your work ethic could be better and you could study for your exams weeks prior. We give ourselves excuses to blame others for our own faults. I say no more. I hope this helps because I wanted to knock everything I felt was dumb about depression and this. No offense to you, I mean I wanted you to see how dumb our brains try to make us feel when it’s something you just have to shrug about and get along with. Death is the cycle of life always. Animals die too. Plants die everyday. Don’t let human lives coming to an end be something that puts us at our worst. Sure, exception to when lives are wasted for no reason or they’re taken as a form of hate or stupidity. I hope you agree and maybe this makes you realize that all we can do is move forward and take steps to prevent this. These are not out of our control, we raise our governments the way they are and if it’s not to our liking, you gain the traction you need until it’s a fair system for us all."
