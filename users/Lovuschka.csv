&#x200B;

Regarding 2 - My very minority opinion here: There should be an option to donate without getting ""enforced"" ingame benefits. Usually that can be done by using a different currency to buy with real money, which in turn can be used on bonuses at the player's discretion. If that isn't possible due to design, then a cosmetics only bundle etc. to be bought with real money is fine.

But that kind of things (donations, cosmetics without ingame effect) only is viable for a game that is really good in itself, where people play it and want to support it without getting anything in return. If you make original music some collectors are willing to pay a reasonable price for it to get the soundtrack to download for example on bandcamp, but that's only viable also if the game becomes a success or the music is really good.

With Transport Defender and Idle Space Raider what held me back from buying a package for 5 dollars or so was really that I would have gotten the ingame currency earned every day. If there was a separate currency, even if it could only have been converted 1:1 to that currency, it would have been more like ""donating"" to me, as it would have kept the paid and free content separate.

Now of course I'm a very small minority in that regard. So take me as maybe indicative of half a percent of your playerbase at maximum. Just something to keep in mind.

For most games there will be no incentive for me to spend money at all, as I like to only enjoy the ""free"" content. So, for people like me a one-time purchase to unlock the entire content would make more sense (note that by ""unlock the entire content"" I don't mean getting ingame bonuses, but rather that there might be paid-only content which still has to be earned by playing, similar to what Gemcraft did with its Armor Games only content, or to the Epic Battle Fantasy games). The price really would depend on how good the game is then. Maybe a ""free"" and ""paid"" version would be separately possible even (for example: Defender's Quest on Kongregate vs. on Steam \[or after paying on Kongregate for the full version\]).

Regarding 3 - A good or even any story adds to an incremental game, but it must tie in with the game mechanics. NGU Idle or Kittens' Game or Trimps can serve as inspiration. NGU Idle has boss fights with textual story that is really silly but fun to read once. Trimps and Kittens' Game make the story evolve with the mechanics that are unlocked. Of course the story there is rather simple: You are a single cat, then you gather catnip, found a village, etc. - not great storywriting, but the minimal story to remain engaged."

Small joke.

&#x200B;

To be more on the point, as long as there is a target audience, someone who will actually create a revenue in whatever way, they will continue making it. Porn is only to a small degree, to the ones required by law and profit (safe sex only is done because otherwise actors and actresses wouldn't do that at all, otherwise they'd save the little money for that; similarly underage porn only isn't done because it's illegal), pertaining to any values that coincidentally could be considered moral.

Should they not make it? Well, sure. In theory people also shouldn't be attracted to their siblings. In practice fantasies go far, practically living them not as far usually, but the potential for money is in both. So while they possibly, from a moral point of view, should stop creating incest porn, the monetary incentive is there. We should be thankful that usually it's not real incest, only acted as such.

&#x200B;

Unless you talk about involuntary incest porn, i.e. criminal acts, possibly even involving children.

But there is no way to go into Iran without it being treated as an invasion or a hostile act.

EDIT: I just noticed that while he's Iranian, the place where he was killed was actually Baghdad, which is the Iraqi capital. I wonder why it wasn't possible to capture him alive there?"

I think the concept might work, but it would be just another reaility show. But of course it could be extended to other art forms and professions.
