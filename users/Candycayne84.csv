Get good food, not grain free drugstore crap. Also treats!"
cats,ff26q15,t3_er7nj1,1579495375.0,Cats are nocturnal lol get her a friend and maybe instead of meowing all night you'll hear running around the house all night.
Winnipeg,ff25psw,t1_ff205fl,1579494542.0,You could argue that driving 2.5 times over the legal limit with coke in your system makes you pretty fucking stupid and dangerous. I would've done the same thing as this officer if this dude started charging his car at me. You dont know if his intention was to murder someone that night or if he was in panic mode and trying to defend himself from someone who clearly didnt give a fuck about any laws. He was definitely not some innocent bystander getting shot.

cats,fevkf0l,t3_eqptb1,1579398434.0,When my cat got super sick and wouldnt drink or eat I got an oral syringe (from the drug store) and force fed him 20ml/h for about 8h. I also managed to finger feed him wet food. If you have squeeze ups (weird pureed cat treats in tubes) you may be able to get some of that into your cat as well. And then vet asap. Good luck
