However, being a tyrant 1) makes you not accountable for your actions e.g. stealing public funds, corruption, and state media. 2) makes him a man with everything to lose which results in political and random arrests, killing of the opposition to plant fear in the hearts of people and making the political environment non-existent. 



This statement can be said about any tyrant, I don't like living with that, and I am pretty sure a lot of people agree with me, which is why simply the word tyrant makes me in the opposition.

And he also is not doing good economically and we still have 10 more years of his lovely face."

My feelings about the Egyptian society is quite conflicted, I like how things societally are progressing towards open-mindness but feel frustrated about how far behind we still are and how the political environment is not really helping. I didn't mean to come off as hostile, it is just frustrating to not find like-minded individuals or even people who are hostile towards your ideology and way of thinking.

Western liberals on the other hand, are atheist-like or atheists, even more lenient with clothing and relationships, actively opposing gender roles and sexist, patriarchal mindsets. And believe in LGBT rights.
