- Flex Bar training (I started with the green one). I still do it so that the pain won‘t come back

- Work on my technique: I used way too much strength as a beginner. This fucked my elbows up majorly in the beginning I guess. I am 37 now so maybe that is not a problem for younger climbers. Ever since I climb „softer“, I have hardly any issues. But again, I am also not a very skilful climber.

Good luck on getting better!"

**Katana Zero**: also no release date after half a year     
    
**Disco Elysium**: that is announced fortunately    
    
**Cuphead**: I know it‘s a MS published game but I really dig the art style. Same goes for **Oni and the Blind Forrest**

My personal game of the year was Hollow Knight. I am really happy that I did not have to miss out on it, luckily it was published after a while"

\- Accept all available orders

\- At the ""Fabricate Equipment"" Screen press Circle (go back)

\- Then you should see the orders that were hidden before. I guess it will still only show 10 more so if you are missing an order, try repeating the above steps.

I cancelled like 200 orders manually after accepting all of them before I found out about this"

Jim rarely talks about eSports in general, his audience (me included) is also probably not that interested in it either. My deepest eSports experience was Hearthstone, which also was not mentioned despite almost every major publisher trying to get into CCGs after its succes."
