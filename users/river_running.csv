AmItheAsshole,felvbdh,t1_fejqa6s,1579231832.0,"Agree with ESH. Regardless of whether or not it cooks off, cooking with wine for someone who is a recovering alcoholic was unnecessary. Would you use wine to deglaze for someone who avoided alcohol for religious reasons? Or because of pregnancy? There was no need to use wine. You‚Äôre cooking for friends, not acting as a line cook required to match an exact flavor profile at a high end restaurant. Use chicken broth. And apologize for using the wine, instead of trying to defend it."

Running is the only cardio that will get my heart rate this high, although it doesn‚Äôt feel like I am exerting myself more than when I use the elliptical or bike.

Keto works because you eliminate certain foods, reducing your intake. Intermittent fasting works because you reduce the length of time you eat, reducing how many calories you eat.

highereducation,fcquitd,t3_eiizjt,1577892403.0,"As an admissions counselor, this is the type of presentation you will be giving frequently in high school classrooms and to groups visiting campus. So, instead of thinking that you‚Äôre preparing for an interview, plan it like you were talking to juniors and seniors about your school. Think of them as your target audience. 

Pictures and visuals are great. Look on the schools website for images that you can save and use. Try to incorporate the schools branding and tag lines in your presentation too. 

Think about what really sets that school apart. Is it closely connected with the community? If so, include a few things about why the community is a great place to live,along with the school itself. Basically, go through the entire student experience and highlight different areas of it. Think- academics, tuition, scholarships, service opportunities, clubs and organizations, athletics, dining, etc. 

Also, think how you‚Äôre going to present it. Do you need to bring your own laptop or bring it on a thumb drive? What‚Äôs the technology setup they have? Do you need to use a PowerPoint or can you use something web based like Sway? You can call and clarify some of that if you need to. 

Write your talking points out on notecards but don‚Äôt write it word for word. Practice it so you‚Äôre comfortable delivering it (like you would need to be in a classroom). And good luck!"

Hyperhidrosis,fc97yll,t3_egmdvm,1577548473.0,"I‚Äôm a 35 yo female and first started noticing I sweat more than normal around 7th or 8th grade.  It was rough because so went to a school that required uniforms so I had to wear a white turtleneck every day and the pits got so yellow and the turtleneck made me so hot that I would just constantly sweat. At first it was armpits and hands and eventually spread to feet in high school. My parents didn‚Äôt think it was an issue and just generally ignored it so I managed as best as I could with just washing my hands and layering shirts. It was rough. We were a big church going family which meant lots of youth group type stuff where you would hold hands to pray and I was always embarrassed. 

I suffered through high school too but still played sports, was yearbook editor, and in student government. I just did whatever was needed to keep my hands from touching the paper and people just knew that I would sweat a lot and just kinda accepted it. I remember running to the bathroom between class whenever possible to wipe my pits with paper towels and wash my hands and reapply deodorant. I think it was around this time I started searching for info on swearing and realized it was an actual condition. 
In college I was studying to be a tv news reporter and finally made a doctors appointment for myself where I was prescribed dry sol. It worked amazingly well for awhile but eventually stopped being effective. I started a career in tv and just dealt with being sweaty. I couldn‚Äôt wear cute shoes because I had to have socks and had to be careful about the materials my clothes were. Also dealing with holding sweat microphones was no fun especially when you had to hand it to someone else, but I did it. It also spread to affect more areas like behind my knees and in my groin area and occasionally around my hairline. 

Eventually I was prescribed glyco which worked well and is what I am still using. I don‚Äôt work in tv anymore but am in a professional public career and still get flare ups but I think since I‚Äôve always just dealt and managed it so far, it doesn‚Äôt bother or embarrass me. For other people their interactions with me are short lived and while they may notice I‚Äôm sweaty it‚Äôs just a blip on their radar and in the end just not a big deal. I also have psoriasis which developed within just the past few years and that‚Äôs probably much more noticeable to someone than the HH is. 

Anyway, to conclude this wall of text, I‚Äôm married, have two kids, live a productive enjoyable life, and sweat more than most people."

It‚Äôs also interesting to think, if you believe in the Bible, that Christ says no one knows the day or the hour when he will return.  This means that Satan, who sends the anti-Christ, also didn‚Äôt know. So really in all likelihood, there is someone who could be the anti-Christ at any point in history and there is one now. 

2 Corinthians 11:4, 13-15, NIV. ‚ÄúFor if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. . . . For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. Is it not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.‚Äù

Matthew 7:15, 21-23, NAS. ‚ÄúBeware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. . . . Not everyone who says to Me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?‚Äô And then I will declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.‚Äô‚Äù

2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, NIV. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God‚Äôs temple, proclaiming himself to be God.‚Äù

People who call themselves Christians are all to easily letting themselves be deceived by what Trump says.  Trump is preaching a gospel of divisiveness and discrimination, with a prophecy of ‚ÄúMake America Great Again,‚Äù and is in every way masquerading as a servant of righteousness with things like appointing anti-abortion judges, and all the policy these conservative Christians use as an excuse for liking Trump."
