It also includes James Hardie, a company that is responsible for the deaths of 10s of thousands of people due to asbestos exposure, and which it actively covered up for decades.

I'd also argue that Pepsico is a questionable inclusion too, given the role many of their products play in the obesity epidemic in the west. It's also one of the biggest global buyers of palm oil. While it claims to only use sustainable palm oil, according to the World Wildlife Foundation, Pepsico is ""Not yet in the starting blocks"" when it comes to ensuring that all of its palm oil comes from segregated supplies of certified sustainable palm oil. 

Thankfully no coal or oil producers, though I have seen them in 'sustainable' investment options before. All in all, I'd score it a 6/10 on sustainability from what I can see. I've seen much worse, but there's a lot of room for improvement. I suspect if I had full access to their holdings and plenty of time for research I could find a few more doozies in there."

Edit: I found the quote I was really looking for eventually...

""Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.

The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. """
