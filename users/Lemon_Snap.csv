I hope everything works out and you can take your leave. Either way though, yes, your baby is a blessing and you will cherish any time you have with them. When they start to smile when you come into the room because they recognize mom... It's just the best and makes any tough days worth it.

All the best from this (newish) mom!"
RandomKindness,ffa2naa,t3_es4b7l,1579726658.0,"Crochet! All you need to start is a hook and some yarn. There are plenty of free tutorials on YouTube. You can make hats for babies at the hospital, clothes, blankets etc. For animals, friends and family. It's pretty easy to start and who doesn't appreciate a hand made garment?"
Watercolor,ff1zop7,t3_er29o6,1579489955.0,Love it! This is my favourite style of watercolour painting :)
food,fem8v5u,t1_fekwpzw,1579244033.0,"The problem is it isn't a good picture. You've mentioned the 'lighting' a few times, but the entire surrounding of the plate of food adds to the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of what you made. 
The strawberry shortsnake is cute but you really should have taken a picture of it with clean surroundings/ just a countertop etc. Not the mess behind the plate, it makes everything very unappetizing."

Watercolor,fej6z9t,t3_epceqw,1579159493.0,The shading is excellent! Well done:)

She looks like a very happy dog!"
aww,feflbo5,t1_fefky8i,1579058763.0,I think she's beautiful!
onguardforthee,fdj4vq9,t1_fdh86fy,1578458513.0,Just have to make sure our unions keep up the good fight. I believe my sector may be going to strike soon if things don't pan out this month. The flexibility for time off is so nice to have and makes one's work life so much less stressful.
onguardforthee,fdg57pk,t1_fdfujye,1578380493.0,"Gee, I work for the government too but we don't have it that good in my sector! I'm envious now!"
aww,fdfnqc2,t1_fdd8hor,1578365934.0,I'm sorry to hear that :( I couldn't imagine having to give our pup away.
pregnant,fd6q54y,t3_ek384u,1578194364.0,56 hours of labour for me! And 8+ of those stuck at 7cm because she didn't want to turn. The epidural was scary to me beforehand but by 7cm and no improvement I needed it. So amazing! I was able to sleep and get some energy to push later on! Goodluck and the baby will be so amazing and worth it when it's done!
tollers,fcql2g8,t3_eidvdz,1577887896.0,That's one happy Toller!
AskReddit,fay6kmc,t1_faxx8no,1576395670.0,"I used the mirror too. It helped me with pushing, and it was really neat to see her head slowly coming down and making it's way out. The freakiest part was when her head was mostly out and she was being held in place by the midwife, mostly because she was kind of bue/gray (normal) and it's just a head haha. Will watch again with the next one :)"
