I don’t know if it’s always this way, or if it was the preference of just some professors at Zhongguo Renmin Daxue (Bei Da), but she had each foreigner fill out a short questionnaire about our personalities, our passions, our goals, what our favourite things were, etc. Then she went home and thought over each answer. At the end of the week she provided each of us with an engraved stamp with our new Chinese name, reflecting both our personalities and our dreams. 

I’ll keep the full name private, but my Chinese surname is Song, written like 松. I am Canadian-American, and she said the strong evergreen reflected her idea of a North American. My love for music made a bit of a fun pun in English too, she thought.

atheism,fd7xl8c,t1_fd65qb9,1578211527.0,"To bring some context to your last point, the Jews (and specifically the Israelites of the Old Testament) believed that life begins at birth, or, in some books of the Old Testament, a few months after birth (when they are instructed to only take census of citizens who are older than a few months). This is partly because of the high infant mortality rate, but also because of the creation story. The Ruach of Adonai is translated as both spirit and breath. Ruach HaKodesh is the Holy Spirit of the New Testament. 

When you are born and make contact with the air, God’s Ruach is imparted to you and you become a human with a soul. This is also taught in the Talmud, where special instruction is given for performing an abortion without allowing the baby to make contact with the air, so that it never has a soul. 

Jesus, a rabbi, would have learned to perform this kind of abortion. He never mentioned it, never opposed it, never questioned it, as far as the New Testament goes. So he never had a problem with abortion. Almost everything he did was talk about the evils of the wealthy elites and the use of religion to take advantage of people.

Is it child porn if a real child was never involved? Many countries ban animations, illustrations, and even written forms of porn that contain portrayals of underage participants. But no fictional character can consent, so is the purpose purely to limit the availability of underage material to prevent piquing people’s interest?

Then you get niche. For example, a foot fetish. If you’re distributing pictures of children’s feet, is that child porn? It may be real children, and used for jerking off, but the children themselves are never harmed or even inconvenienced. A quick google image search can bring you hundreds of thousands of images of children’s feet. 

There are lots of layers, and authors like in the OP can get pulled into it because of our fervour to prevent abuse of children. Then of course any literature that includes children going through puberty could be considered pornographic, depending on what details or experiences are mentioned.

The attitude “fuck you, I’ve got mine” is absolutely core to Chinese culture, partly out of necessity as it can be a very competitive and cutthroat culture. 

Hospitality is certainly found in China, and it’s full of wonderful people. But the culture pushes heavily the idea that you care for you and your own first and foremost. 

Contrast with Japan (gasp) and see how they identify the group in a much wider way. Their streets are clean. Their social welfare systems are broader.
