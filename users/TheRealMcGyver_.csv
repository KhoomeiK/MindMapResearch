depression,fetr8n9,t1_fes6but,1579378759.0,"Love is hard. Extending love to others when little or none is reciprocated is incredibly difficult. 

Showing others love, especially when you're solely on the giving end, may seem like a fruitless task. Truth be told, I often have doubts about whether or not others truly enjoy my company or care for me. I've had incredible anxiety as a result of my self doubt and my skepticism directed towards relationships I've had and currently have. I know what it's like to be friendless and without others to care for me. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. 

I don't care anymore if people care for me as much as I do for them. If I can show them they're loved and worthy of love, that's enough for me. It's incredibly hard to love others, especially when it doesn't seem to be reciprocated, but that makes it all the more worth while. Love can take many forms. Some people may be better reached by gift giving. For me, I enjoy making fresh bread and giving it to others. Some people may appreciate financial help. Everyone wants to be validated. To be told their feelings and ideas are worth something. To be listened to. That is a gift few give but everyone would benefit to receive.

You're not pathetic if it seems no one loves you. Far from it. You may not receive praise for your actions frequently, but what you do is worthwhile and respectable. You are worthwhile and worthy of love. If you can extend love to others without external initiative and motivation, as it sounds you do, then that alone is a virtue to transcend nigh any other. 

Love is infectious. People are attracted to those who give love freely. It may not feel like it at the moment but loving others, regardless of if they outwardly show appreciation, is an honorable pursuit."

Second, if you are discussing politics or your opinions with people, making sure you sound genuinely curious and open will go a long way with locals. As a general rule, listening more than talking helps keep people happy, as does validating their opinion.

There's jackwagons everywhere you'll go, but as long as you stay as cool as you seem you'll be just fine."

depression,feq1o4q,t3_eqc90a,1579336179.0,"I hope you get some help with your situation OP. Not saying it will necessarily help you or fix anything, but diet and electronic use seemed to play a large part in my energy levels and mental health. I probably sound like a mom, but changing those helped me figure out what worked for me. Hopefully you can see a doctor soon"
depression,feq0ii6,t3_cml6ni,1579335601.0,"It's been slow, but I've been fighting to get better for years. I've tried a vast number of techniques and habits, but just trying to love on everyone I can has made the biggest difference in my life. I don't want anybody to feel the way I've felt, though I know that's scarcely a realistic dream. I just hope that one day, maybe I'll make a difference for someone, however small.

The feelings of purpose and meaning I get from trying to help others and showing people love are the most consistent they've ever been in my life. I am blessed to have a wonderful family that supports me how they can, though that often adds to any feelings of unworthiness I already hold. The only thing I can do is continue to try and give back.

Maintaining a healthy weight, clear skin, and a clean bedroom  were things I used to only dream of. I still do, but they're more in my reach now than they ever have been. I'm far from through with depression. I've accepted I'll carry it's burden with me for the rest of my life. The lows are still incredibly low, though I now recover quicker and go longer between lows. I pray growth, purpose, and an abundance of love will find all who also  struggle with depression and any other burden. Those three virtues may be lacking in many of your lives, as they have and often do in mine, though I would like to offer love or kindness to any who will accept it."
