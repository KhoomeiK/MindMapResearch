SuicideWatch,fc1t15c,t1_fc1se5s,1577328795.0,I do the same. It was 4 30 in the morning (here) when I posted this.
SuicideWatch,fc1dfki,t1_fc0nwki,1577315444.0,Thanks for making it clearer
Showerthoughts,fc0t84u,t3_efjy3j,1577299106.0,Same goes for liars
SuicideWatch,fc0owsh,t1_fc0o8sc,1577296159.0,"Hopefully not the last one ,but the last you feel like this"
SuicideWatch,fc0kn7a,t1_fbzv0z3,1577293088.0,You should check where you live. Here we have programs where you sign up to spend the holidays with people in need/lonely/sick
SuicideWatch,fc0kdbk,t1_fbzzq9r,1577292862.0,That's really odd . Here in Argentina I've heard many times that suicides peak around Christmas and January . But since it's both hemispheres I suppose that's not true
SuicideWatch,fc0k126,t1_fc09ctm,1577292585.0,I don't know where you live but here there are different programs where you spend family with sick or lonely people. Maybe you don't have to spend the holidays with a family but instead make someone else happy at least for one night
SuicideWatch,fc0jnox,t1_fc0ca1i,1577292328.0,Sorry hope you get better
AskReddit,fbtbvxx,t1_fbtbu13,1577073959.0,Right
