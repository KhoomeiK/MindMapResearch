cringe,fdrrw30,t1_fdrkrso,1578688847.0,"I actually happen to go to the same school as OP and can say for certain that non of her classmates ever found out that she wasn't actually from Canada. That said, something about her just never seemed right to me. She seemed off. Her appearance was normal enough and  there was no discernible accent or anything else that was off-putting, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that there was something about this girl that was not completely on the level.

One day, in between classes I found myself in the school hallway. I was on my way to my homeroom when I happened to bump into her.

""How's it going?"" I asked.

""Not bad, eh"", she fittingly responded.

I remember giving her a sort of side-eye glance when she began to tell me quite a lengthy story about how her day had gone completely off the rails. Apparently she had slept in that morning and did not have time to eat breakfast. That would have been fine had she not forgotten her backpack at home. As she explained, in her rush to get to school she had put the money her mom gave her in the front pocket of her backpack and then proceeded to run out the of the house, forgetting her back-pack by the front door. As it was nearly 2:25 in the afternoon she was quite hungry.

To be perfectly honest, and I have never told anyone this before, back then I had a bit of a crush on OP.

""What a perfect opportunity"", I thought to myself.

I had some extra money in my pocket so I offered to buy her some lunch.

""What were you planning on buying for lunch?"" I asked her.

""I was planning on buying a hamburger from the cafeteria"", she responded.

""Well, how much does a hamburger cost? I can lend you the money if you would like"".

She looked me right in the eye and responded, ""That is amazing and so nice of you! A hamburger costs about $3.50"".

It was about that moment that I realized I was being deceived by a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That damn lochness monster almost had me completely fooled!"

In a house with a mortgage payments around 2300 a month they will build a basement apartment and rent it out for 1500 and the owners will live upstairs. Or, they split the house into two units, basement for 1500 and upstairs (usually 3 bed, 2 bath, living room, kitchen, all that stuff) for 2300 a month.
