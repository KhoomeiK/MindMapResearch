TL;DR: After thinking it through it seems to me you are talking about ""**increasing**"" and ""**decreasing**"" rates of occurance.

  


That's a bit of a subtle concept. If I get what you are saying, you are...

...NOT saying that A occurs MORE than B.  
...ARE saying that A is occuring more than A normally does.  
...AND B is it NOT occuring more than B normally does (or is even declining).  
ALSO, YOU DIDN'T SAY THIS BUT I ASSUME  
...A and B are probably related (or could seem related)  
Let's take a real-life example. 

In the United States, in the years between 2008 and 2012, the number of deaths of US military personnel due to suicide (let's call this A) has increased. While in the same timeframe the number of deaths of military personnel due to combate/action have decreased.

So what words can we use to describe this? (Key words are in bold)

If we are winning to ***only*** talk about B (deaths by suicide) we could simply say  
\* The number of military suicides has **increased**.  
\* OR... The **rate** military suicides has **increased**.

If you want to talk about both A and B and make come kind of ""comparison"" (your word) between them, but without being as wordy as I was above, you might say:  
\* A is **increasing** compared to B which is **decreasing**.  
\* While it's good that B is **decreasing**, unfortunately A is **increasing**.

I often watch series from beginning to end that I would only rate 3 or 3½ stars. I wish I didn't waste my time like that but sometimes I'm just board or procrastinating and do it anyway.   


My prefered taste is for series that are rich and full of depth. What I mean is series where there a many characters that are central, many plot lines, rich diversity of situations, etc.   


I found that The Americans was not that way. Sure there are characters besides the main couple (Elizabeth and Philip) and the FBI Agent (Stan). But mostly, except for those three, the others aren't very deep or have much of a story of their own except as how they relate to the main three. Even Stan is really a secondary character. This is a show built only around Elizabeth and Philip.  


And even for them, most of it is just about the next crazy job they have to do, and then how the manage to pull it off.

Fortunately or unfortunately we just can't control other people. \~\~ Plus, he's said he wants to be friends but will never see you in person. I say: **Skip that. Move on to your other friends.**  


\#2: Not long ago I was in a similar situation but where I was more like your friend in this story. Whenever I spend time with my friend, she was alway much more about herself and her issues than about whatever we were doing. This had bothered me for awhile but this last time it was so much I decided I just didn't need that in my life. (Sounds like what your friend said.) I pretty much told her that (different situation & words) and then stopped calling. (We weren't a romantic couple or anything even near that.) She did call about two weeks later and I was ready to give it another go, but even on that phone call all the old behaviors popped right back up.   


Point is: I have zero interest in seeing her again or being friends. But if she ever called and said, ""I'm hurt at your actions and I'd like you to apologize,"" I would say something like, ""I'm sorry you're hurt. I didn't mean to hurt you and I do hope you are well and do even better going forward. I just can't be around you -- but maybe that's my issue. Anyway, I'm sorry, and good luck.""  (I'd be less formal but I'm just paraphrasing here.  Again, the point: Why not apologize and move on. Who does it harm? Who does it help?"

Not sure I'm convinced or that your argument & data are particularly tight, but I will think on it and do some research. And, as I said, thanks."
TrueAskReddit,fd6af45,t3_ek5bux,1578187976.0,"A simple, standard, non-subtle understanding of ""apology"" is that it is something you do when you are wrong. This is a child's level of understanding which many, many adults also hold. But that word, that action, is not so simple. One definition I just found is:  a regretful acknowledgment of an offense or failure.  But another definition I just found is:  an **expression of regret for not being able to do something**.  


One can, and in my opinion should, make an apology when someone else is harmed or hurt or inconvenienced, even if there was no ""offence"" and no ""fault.""  If I push my grocery cart out past the end of an isle where I can't see who is coming because another person is standing there and there are ""end cap"" displays -- and my cart cuts off a person that was walking the other way -- even though I did everything I could, even though I did nothing wrong, I will say, ""sorry"" or ""excuse me.""   


It's polite. It keeps society moving. It ""acknowledges my expression of regret for not being able to see them"" even though I made no mistake.  


The same can, and should, be done in more serious situations between people who are more intimately connected to one another. Being socially close to someone is even ***more*** reason to apologize.   


Now, at least one person here has expressed that apologizing when you have not done something wrong will setup a bad president. That is something that should be watched for. If someone else is too often demanding you apologize for things you had no part in, if they are using their ""hurt"" to control you, then that is a problem. But that possibility should not forstall you from apologizing from time to time. Only **if** the other person has a proven tendency to use kind apologies against people should people start to withhold their kind hearted apologies.  


TL;DR: Just apologize. It helps everyone. Only don't apologize if someone uses your well intentioned apologies and their hurt to control you."
lowcarb,fd5tpcp,t3_ek0y0h,1578181398.0,"Excellent observation and point, well expressed.   


I'm only just starting to get into low-carb but I too notice that ""proper"" foods like a good salad with some meat and a little dressing taste so much better already. Your observation that non-carb foods used to just feel like something ""grey"" that I ate so that I could consume some carbs rings true.  


As for addiction: I have to give up drinking if I want to eat well. If I drink, too many times I have too much, then eat like shit for at least one day and often many days afterward. Booze (for me) equals bad food choices, not exercising, eventual lowered self esteem, which leads to more booze and ""comforting"" food choices. So yeah, cabs is (can be?) an addiction too, but for me, it's second to booze.

Screenwriting,fd2nagd,t1_fd2f00h,1578149658.0,"I do sometimes tend to overcomplicate things. Sometimes that has served me well, sometimes it has created paralysis. You (via the link you shared) and u/BgstevyG (above) seem to be saying similar things. Specifically: First do some reading of books > Then to some outlining > Then write.  Then do the cycle again.  


Your link also adds in the steps of following along (what I called analyzing) other's scripts and movies.  


This all makes sense and works for me. I'll try it that way.  


FYI / BACKGROUND:  


My issue was listening to advice like ""you have to be writing if you want to be a writer"" and ""write one scene per day and in a year you'll have a movie"" and the voice in my own head saying ""stop procrastinating by reading books, JUST WRITE!"" -- But when I try to just get to the writing, I'm still lost.  


On the timeline of the link you shared the steps go like this:  
1: Read some (at least 2) books  
2: Analyze some (5) scripts & movies  
3: Come up with an idea  
4: Create a Beat Sheet / Outline  
5: Write a Treatment  
6: Write the screenplay.  


In that list I'm on Step #2 (though already have Step #3 done).  


TAKEAWAY: I don't need to feel bad about not writing (yet) because my next step is to revisit my books (it's been a few months) and then analyze some movies & scripts. THEN I can outline and THEN write.  


All makes sense to me.

In a literal sense ""Wild Goose Chase"" is probably something that is so difficult that it's not worth it, but technically it is possible to finally catch the wild goose.

So in a literal/technical sense it probably works. If someone knows English idioms it probably doesn't. Though I would still suggest using this phrase might get you the result you want.
