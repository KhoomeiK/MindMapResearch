AmItheAsshole,feihf9h,t3_ep0irq,1579138602.0,"NAH. I think you have a legit concern, but on the other hand, if her boyfriend is mature and is on the same page as her, I can see why she'd overlook the age difference. My cousin married a woman 12 years his senior; he was 21 and she was 33. That was over a decade ago, and they're still together living life to the fullest with their two boys.

ETA: The woman my cousin married wasn't well off or anything. She was living with roommates, working a low-paying job, and going back to school for her business degree. This definitely wasn't a situation where all the power was held by the older party. They met at college, and things took off from there. Now they own their own business. So yeah, OP, maybe you shouldn't be too quick to judge?"

I disagree. He was probably being considerate, thinking she had enough on her plate having to take her friend to the hospital. I would have waited for the update.

>Honestly, id say she didn't know the storm that was brewing and just never thought to messsge him because there was nothing significant to report.

Also disagree. Even if there isn't a huge update, most people would still let their partner know what was going on. Something like, ""Hey just wanted to let you know M is okay. Her boyfriend is here now, so I'm heading home."" Y'all act like it wasn't a big deal that she completely blew off OP, but I guarantee you'd be pissed if your SO told you they'd update you and then said nothing. Oh yeah, and then you get home and they're just chilling on the sofa instead of at the hospital—which would at least explain why they didn't update you."

AmItheAsshole,fehkut6,t3_ep1ayq,1579118596.0,"YTA. This is no different than going to a movie with your SO, dropping them off at the front, parking the car, then heading in and jumping in line where they are. A lot of people would find this acceptable, and in fact, many people do it. I highly doubt this was a situation where mom told her kid to wait in line for the entire duration of her shopping trip. What likely happened was the lady forgot something and told her kid to go wait in line while she went and grabbed it. Because children shouldn't be handling shopping carts, that's why the cart was with mom and not in line with the kid.

Also, you're a shopper on a busy day. I highly doubt you waited in line for 15 minutes. That is only your perception, and unless you timed it, I don't believe you. I went Black Friday shopping at a big box store where the line extended way past the registers and wrapped around SIX aisles. I commented to my husband that this was going to take at least half an hour, so we decided to time it on my phone. Turns out the entire wait time was 7 minutes."
AmItheAsshole,fehi8rp,t1_fegj6dm,1579117077.0,"So, I love how you totally dismiss the detail where OP's girlfriend said she'd update him and then never followed through.

>I offered to help her but she told me to go have dinner with my parents and she would keep me updated. Except I received no type of information whatsoever.

Clearly she had the time, since OP found her just chilling at home. For all we know, the boyfriend showed up just as they got to the hospital and OP's girlfriend could have still made it to dinner. The fact that she didn't bother to update him (like she said she would) seems intentional and looks suspicious. If I were in OP's shoes, I'd think she was trying to get out of going to dinner too."
AmItheAsshole,fehgndl,t3_ep277i,1579116143.0,"**NTA.** I don't think your girlfriend was actually planning to get out of having dinner with your parents, but the timing was just right and I'm sure she felt *relieved* that she had a legit reason not to go.

What makes her TA for me is that she said she'd update you, and then she never did. The fact that she *intentionally* did not call or text you to 1) let you know she was leaving the hospital, and 2) ask if you guys were just sitting down or finishing up, tells me there's a good chance your girlfriend could have made it to dinner—especially if the boyfriend showed up just as they got to the hospital.

I think your behavior in this situation was pretty tame.

I prefer using a flirt pole (if you have the space), doing training exercises, or playing hide-and-seek with the boys. They're really good at it, so I make it hard for them now. The entrance to our attic is accessible only by ladder, so I'll go up there and call for the dogs. They'll run circles around the house to find me, and they get sooo excited because they can hear me but have no way of getting to me lol. I know it sounds mean, but they expend so much energy doing this. I always climb down when they're on the other side of the house searching and go into a closet or room, then call them and let find me. So in the end, everybody wins."
dogs,feh0kre,t3_ep3szk,1579106622.0,"We also have two pitties, and our Cooper Dooper the Big Fat Pooper was like this as well starting at 6 months. It only went on for a few weeks though as we worked on it immediately, and he is no longer destructive but still loves to chew. He and our other pit bull Rumble are both aggressive chewers, so we have tons of bones and toys to address that. Anyway...

How often do you catch your dog in the act? How do you address it?

Anytime Cooper was caught destroying something, he was promptly reprimanded. This usually meant being told ""No, bad dog!"" and then being taken to the designated timeout area for five minutes (never use their crate as a timeout spot). Even if Cooper hadn't destroyed anything yet and was just beginning to engage in that behavior (i.e. chewing on the table leg, gnawing on the rug, etc.), he was reprimanded the same way. On the opposite end of that, Cooper was generously rewarded anytime he was well behaved. For example, I'd place a household object next to him and if he ignored it, he got a treat and tons of praise. If he started to destroy it, he'd go to timeout.

Cooper also liked tearing up his bed, and we went through three of them before he stopped. The important thing is correcting them as soon as they start. Whenever I saw Cooper starting to gnaw on his bedding, I'd tell him ""Leave it"" and give him a chance to stop. If he didn't, then I'd remove him from his bed. Eventually he understood that chewing up his bed meant he wouldn't be allowed to be on it, so that behavior went away within a week.

Ultimately, I think you need to keep your dog contained to one room until he learns how to behave in the house. This doesn't mean he stays there all day everyday. It simply means that whenever you can't keep an eye on him to correct his behavior, he has to be in that room to minimize destruction. Good luck!"

Instead of braking, she turned her car and veered into the curb, busting a hubcap. So yeah, in your situation, you should have called an ambulance instead of getting an Uber.

I live on 40+ acres where 95% of that is just forest. I started using an e-collar for both my dogs on off leash walks through the woods after it became obvious that R+ training was never going to work against chasing deer. I can call my boys off rabbits, squirrels, badgers, birds, and raccoons. Never needed an e-collar for that. But there's something about giving chase to deer that no amount of R+ was ever going to thwart.

I don't think e-collars are inhumane at all when used appropriately. So to answer your question—in my humble opinion—if you have a dog with a high prey drive, you will not get the same level of results with regular training as you would with an e-collar when it comes to recall specifically."

AmItheAsshole,fckjye5,t3_ehouqc,1577726975.0,"You apologized for assuming it was a joke and even offered to get Alf a gift later. You are NTA, but your girlfriend definitely is for still being upset days later and also expecting someone else to gift her pet. Are you sure she doesn't equate Alf to a human child?"
AmItheAsshole,fc6osns,t3_eggx3b,1577485708.0,"NTA, and I don't blame you for how you reacted. Your husband is a major a-hole for asking you what was wrong just so he could invalidate your feelings, among other things."
AmItheAsshole,fc6n8ak,t3_eg92vo,1577484595.0,">What bothered me the most was his bad breath. I once politely pointed it out to him and he just started to open his mouth even wider and blow air and laugh.

Wtf? Gross! You are definitely NTA. Your coworker 100% deserves that title. I'm glad you told him off. It seems like being polite and professional wasn't enough to deter his behavior. Sometimes you just gotta be blunt af with some people to make them realize what they're doing is not okay."
AmItheAsshole,fc6mgga,t3_egdo2l,1577484051.0,"NTA, although with how you've described your husband, I'm not sure you can avoid hurting his feelings."
anime,fc6lun8,t3_eg78f2,1577483635.0,"I love both shows, so this is tough for me. They have similar plots but are different in so many ways as well. I didn't start to love Haikyu!! until the second season. With ANS being in its first season, there is still so much potential there. The story and characters are just beginning to develop. It's hard to say which is better at this point. I truly enjoy both."
AmItheAsshole,fc479zs,t3_eg3sm0,1577408529.0,"You agreed to check in on the cat on Thursday. It doesn't matter if she left Monday, Tuesday, or the day right before. Stick to what you say you're going to do and you won't be TA. And you came off super bitchy in your text messages, too. So yeah, YTA no doubt about it."
AmItheAsshole,faoha7w,t3_ea49eq,1576264323.0,"NAH. You do what you gotta do, and your roommate will just have to figure out a way to live around it. He isn't TA for asking if you can switch to night showers, but he would be if he continued to harp on you."
