The last recession just rolled over us, nothing we could do. I imagine the next one will do the same. We're already fucked at our level, nothing the economy does is going to magically un-fuck us."

worldnews,fdlxy6p,t1_fdltiwu,1578535153.0,Why should I be scared? I'm already fucked. I have $75K in debt. My wife has more. We were never gonna be able to pay it. We're just throwing money into the hole every month and struggling to survive on the nothing we have left over. What do you think is going to happen that's going to affect us here on the bottom?

You need to intentionally schedule an appointment, submit a design, and pay by the hour to get a tattoo. Refusing to accept this ink is forcing this individual to continue hemorrhaging  money and jumping through hoops, regardless of whatever they've done prior. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS PERSON'S EARNEST, IF SILENT, PLEA, YOU DO NOT DESERVE PERSONAL AUTONOMY. YOU DO NOT RESPECT THEIRS, WHY SHOULD WE RESPECT YOURS?!"
