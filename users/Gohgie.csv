changemyview,ff6xg4o,t3_eryn5z,1579636883.0,"This is an interesting POV that i somewhat agree with.

The parthenon was under heavy construction when i visited with my family, and it impacted my visit greatly because most things were just behind construction. I think it would be important for a nation to incrementally restore their monuments so that they can still get revenue for the restorations. 

In contrast to this I visited many ruins in rome that were decimated to a point where it looked like floor plans mapped out in small stone walls no higher than your waist. Pompeii was the same, and I would find it hard to rebuild a city based on extremely minimal informarion. If the colosseum has detailed records of construction, then he'll yeah lets build that baby! But if no records exist anymore, i would not want people to try their hand at imagining how everything operated. The facade remains of the colosseum, and damn it's huge!! But when I visited I remembered that there was not much left inside, you could see the catacombs below, but the seating and tunnels of the building were mostly gone. If it were finished without knowing how the original was constructed, it seems like the reconstruction would actually just be the work of the 22st century architect plopped on top of the remains. 

The colosseum is amazing and breathtaking, and seeing it in it's originally intended form would be so beautiful and magical, however in my experience (and admittedly faulty memory) there was not much inside that could be reasonably expanded upon to rebuild that beautiful building. 

I admit i am wrong if we do have records of how to rebuild it."
college,ff65yw6,t3_eruvps,1579619943.0,"I really loved my world literature class so I hope I can be of some assistance. 

Understanding the text can be extremely cumbersome, so it can be helpful to find course hero summaries of the text before you read through it yourself. If your text has footnotes then you are very lucky, footnotes usually have very intriguing contextual info to include in your response paper. 

For the response paper there are a lot of questions you can ask yourself to prompt your writing. How did the illiad differ from other stories of the time, (or from last week's reading)? What moral rules or values are communicated through the text? Did these rules go on to reflect society at the time? 

From what I remembered on my own class discussions for the illiad, we talked primarily about the two sides of this war, troy vs mycenae. What i found intriguing was how they characterized each person involved. Even though there is a clear ""good side"" the good side characters are often flawed and quarrel, whereas Hector on the trojan side was characterized as a very noble and good man, dispute the story written by Greeks, the people he killed lots of. The illiad was unique because there were some genuine bff bro moments, and really nuanced writing. You'd think that a story written by the Greeks about a war they won would be full of ""and then the greek army was very good and only did nice things and kicked the city of troy's ass for being bad"" but it wasn't. Years later there were some texts written by the Christian french people about the middle east that were blatant smear campaigns, yet the Illiad didn't fall victim to being a piece of propaganda despite being much more ancient. The illiad is primarily about the tragedy of war and how a certain war has impacted the greek psyche. 

The more you get into that class the better it gets in my opinion, there are so many unique books written so many years ago that give me context into an entire culture, yet confuse me endlessly. You know the story 1000 and 1 arabian nights? The story that the disney movie Aladdin takes from? It starts off with a queen having an orgy with a bunch of her slaves. My favourite text the Heptameron was written by a french princess i believe, was an anthology of stories all about people being nefarious in order to get laid. One of the short stories was about a prince with *severe* ""nice guy"" syndrome waaay back in 1492. 

Use all your sources you can when it comes to doing homework for this class, the reading can be dense but i've found it so much easier to read when i know before hand what's happening in the story. For the Illiad i'd reccomend keeping a list of characters as you read, making notes near their names because discussion and your response paper might focus heavily on the characters and how they interact. I wish you all the best I hope my comment isn't too big"

Yet the only way non binary (+other genders) would be legitimate, would be if you heard genuine testimony that they felt that way, since this is the basis for trans people who choose from the two culturally accepted genders.

changemyview,fetnf8v,t3_eqhs87,1579377191.0,"There's a moment in the movie where belle says ""promise or no promise, i'm going home!"" Which meant to me that she didn't think she was here against her will. 
Another important scene is when they do get together, a lot of time is passing within one song, and the moments that are highlighted show them doing a snowball fight, but the most important scene i guess is where the beast is actively trying to partake in her activities, and he makes an effort to learn how to read. They have soup and the beast physically cannot use a spoon, so belle eats the soup directly from the bowl, making a cute visual representation of compromise. 
The change in character is represented through visual shorthand. They don't have an all out discussion about anger issues and how to be a better person, because long boring conversations wont get thru a kid's skull. 
It might not have been realistic to show a character becoming more patient and kind over the course of a winter-long song, but to make kids sit thru a story that empasizes how *hard* it is to be nice would really defeat the purpose of making ""becoming a better person"" a hard pill to swallow for kids. The movie shows the beast resisting becoming a better person, but then overcoming that and genuinely caring for belle's interests by the end of the movie and nearly dying to save her. 


Where I think you're 100% right is that the beast is the main character, he has the growth, he learns a lesson and he changes over the course of the movie. 
I think the movie started off with a very high concept for kids, which my impression is the root of the issues that you see with the movie, but I kinda like how they made ""anger issues"" a theme to be overcome, most princess movies at the time had very odd messages that kids could totally miss, like Pocahontas was about racial bigotry, snow white was about having evil relatives, sleeping beauty was about love I  guess? 

I was not a big fan of this movie in my teens but i saw this video by linsday Ellis, and she harps on a few points that you bring up, i'd give her video a listen if you want more discussion on this topic.

It's often all about lighting and angle. 
There's a time outside called the golden hour that people talk about, where the orange time of the sunset makes your skin look nicer. Check around your house for a good window or lamp that looks good on you. 

Angle is another important part, check out videos on what different types of cameras do to your face https://www.google.com/amp/s/gizmodo.com/this-image-shows-how-camera-lenses-beautify-or-uglify-y-5857279/amp
You might need to place your camera on a timer and prop it up on a shelf or a tripod. Spacing away from you can get a more accurate photo. 

Try taking a set of a few photos and just delete it afterwords. Photos are as important as you make them. Toss ones you don't like so much and understand how limited and faulty cameras are in complimenting you. 
After some time you might have some good ones that you do like.

homeschool,feaxk8e,t3_eo5o55,1578953244.0,"I have been homeschooled from 1st grade through high school, i'm 20 now and working to get a bachelors

I resented being homeschooled when i was young, (i was pulled out of preschool because the teachers didn't know which kid was leaving me with bite marks for the day). But i was upset at being homeschooled because the kids on my street that i played with would unintentionally exclude me since i wasn't with them at school and their circle of friends. 

Later in elementary school i was put in a 1 day a week school for other homeschooled kids and this was when i finally felt like i was in the right place. Every grade had like 10+ kids and they taught history, science, theatre, and gym. Since the school was small and all the teachers were often parents of the kids, there was a very tight knit group between the kids and all the adults. 
For 8th grade we had a ""colonial dinner"" which was where all the kids like 15 of us dressed up and had potluck and the boys escorted each girl to a seat. It was super cute and i still have connections with many of the kids from my classes. 

In addition to these ""co-ops"" or homeschool schools, there were also individual classes. One woman my mom knew was an english teacher who wrote her own curriculum, and had a class out of her basement. I love Mrs. Volz very dearly and she had flights of students in all grades cycling through her front door every day for the many flights of classes that she taught. She also ended up teaching a civics class along with a debate class. 

A homeschool community is the most important part. Sometimes you have to learn that ""society"" will be upset at you if you are mean to others, not just mom getting you into trouble. Facebook is where my mom found out about the homeschool community in KC Kansas. Homeschooling might have the word ""home"" in it, but in my experience I found that out-of-home classes and co-ops helped me separate ""school time"" from ""home time""

Later into high school I found that I really needed more time away from home, and it was the perfect opportunity to take community college courses, I was earning dual credit for college and getting out of the house. 

My negative takeaway from being homeschooled was that it created a strain on my relationship with my mother. I couldn't take the bus home and decompress after a failed test, because i had failed that test in the living room, and my disappointed  teacher/mom was sitting at the dinner table with me. It's hard to switch between ""teacher hat"" and ""mom hat"" but i think it is an important part of having a teacher-mom.

 You're certainly not my mother and you're an awesome amazing lady for caring for your kids needs so i have no doubt your kids are in good hands. I just realize now that most of the info I've given was for older students being homeschooled sorry. 

If you have any questions or want clarification i'm sorry this post was a jumbled mess :)"

unpopularopinion,feaapgg,t1_fe8ob3p,1578946361.0,"Same works in the real world, and I think this is where OP is incorrect. 

My siblings liked to get attention from me by antagonizing me. They would poke me relentlessly in the car, I would push back and then the car would erupt in chaos Because I escalated the situation instead of going through the right people and getting an adult involved. 

If in real life you got rear ended by a person in full road rage, to hit their car back you would add yourself to the ""guilty of doing bad things"" list.

Even in bullying, if you hit a bully back, they can use that against you, and you can get your kid in trouble when they did nothing wrong."

socialskills,fea1txa,t3_eo59ly,1578943476.0,"I think the most important part of this is you need to internalize this idea. 

The most important part of things like social anxiety is knowing that *you* *will* *never* *be* *able* *to* *control* *how* *other* *people* *see* *you*. 

So if you've tried this advice and it didn't work, you were trying for the wrong reasons. To convince people that you are comfortable being a little awkward, you need to actually be comfortable being awkward. If your voice breaks when you try to explain your awkwardness, or if you feel like you haven't successfully convinced other people that you're ok being uncomfortable, then you need to work on how *you* see your own awkwardness. 

I feel like i've gotten so much more comfortable at work by trying to at least own my own awkwardness."
TrueOffMyChest,fe9zwd2,t1_fe8fptp,1578942960.0,"I like your point a lot, and i've experienced this on mental health related subs. /anxiety and /ADHD has a kind of culture focused on ""we're just in this together pals"" 
Most of the discussion is speculative or venting or talking about their experiences. Nobody has claimed to be a doctor so far, and i think that level of comradery is an attitude that people there respect. 

But /teenagers is a beast of it's own tbh, and unfortunately changing anything about that community is like herding moody cats."

Keep in mind when you text, she might be out to lunch with family and need to put her phone away, whereas nearer to the evening people have more time to chat but still may need to do chores or something

A good rule of thumb is to spend time chatting with people who you feel like value you, if you're feeling undervalued you don't have to wait for them to give you the right amount of attention. :) 

She might not be as interested as you are right now, and it's up to you to decide what you want to do moving forward. :)"

I lived outside of kansas City and there were 3 different homeschool schools to choose from that all functioned differently than a regular brick and mortar school. I was a part of a huge track team through one of those schools without being affiliated with an actual public school. 

There are also public online schools i believe, the one I took many elementary classes through was called K12."

I don't know if my eyes are gorgeous or a little buggy looking, i honestly have no idea and never will because they're both true. But what I do know for goddamn sure, is that my boyfriend enjoys being corny with me, and that i make him happy and that means the world to me.
