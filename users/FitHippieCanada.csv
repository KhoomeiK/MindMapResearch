No, you cannot ethically test things on pregnant women. You can, however, ask them about health and medication behaviours and decisions while pregnant, and watch the long term outcomes of their children.

I was recommended “no treatment” for what I was told was “just a cold” by an OB, and I ended up in the ER with pneumonia at 20 weeks pregnant, and needed a course of antibiotics after the lung infection was confirmed with chest x-ray. No history of pneumonia previously. Of course I didn’t want to be in the hospital, take antibiotics, use a salbutamol inhaler or get an X-ray while pregnant. But that is what was necessary to ensure that I could recover and continue to carry to term.

When I asked about the safety of the antibiotics, the doctor said “well at this point, you can’t support the pregnancy if you can’t breathe. There are no contraindications of amoxicillin during pregnancy, and you know you tolerate it well, so it’s the safest choice for you.”

This time around, I got the pneumococcal vaccine. Also the flu vaccine and I will get another booster for DTaP in my third trimester.

Blanket statements about avoidance of medical intervention can cause pregnant women to be hesitant to seek treatment, even when treatment is actually the best course of action for the health outcomes of the mother and unborn child. 

It’s a fine balance between prophylactic treatment (such as vaccines) and intervention after potential damage is already done. As I have first hand experience with intervention, I can say I would much rather have a vaccine and avoid the prolonged illness, exposure to radiation, bronchodilators, and antibiotics.

I carried to term, no complications. My son is growing beautifully, meeting all his milestones, and my postpartum recovery was excellent."

worldnews,fdzrb34,t1_fdznchh,1578793981.0,"We actually covered this in my developmental psych class when talking about languages, especially ones that use tone/pitch of voice to change the entire meaning of a word.

I took French and German in high school, and thought I had a somewhat reasonable concept of other languages. I did not. But hey, at least now I know that I don’t know shit.

The context of the name thing was that children exposed to tonal languages, and phonemes using different consonant sounds (different ways to make “t” and “d” with either the top of your tongue behind your teeth, or the underside of your tongue in the middle of your hard palate, for example) learn to hear and produce these sounds when their babbling starts to narrow to only the sounds used within their native language. Many adults cannot even hear the difference between a retroflex and coronal consonant, if not present in their native language(s).

Thankfully, it was likely just his body going overboard while fighting a virus (no other symptoms other than hives). Doc recommended picking up some Benadryl. I went to the pharmacy at my local Shoppers Drug Mart and right there beside the Benadryl were several brands of homeopathic nonsense. Camilia being the worst offender, as they have quite the assortment of products.

Thankfully, I know the difference between real medicine and BS. However, I know many parents who wouldn’t have a clue that the homeopathic “remedies” are just overpriced water. I was very upset to see that, but I needed to hurry home to my poor itchy kid.

I think I will go talk to the pharmacist at shoppers about that tomorrow. He’s really great, and I’ve asked him to double check so many things to make sure they’re safe for use while ttc, pregnant or nursing when I was without a family doctor for 2 years.

Even if nothing changes immediately, maybe my comments or complaints will start the process of changing their displays, or at least create a discussion about how to display homeopathic products.

Pears? Maybe. Kale? No. Peas? Hard no.

movies,fc4ffzo,t1_fc48l12,1577415111.0,"Huh, I couldn’t really put into words why I liked it, but I think that’s it. Not too much emotional backstory, lots of action.

Personally, I find thrillers and anything with too much emotional backstory too exhausting at the lengths of a feature film these days. 

This had just enough backstory to aide the plot, without wrenching on heart strings too much, and providing plenty of “boom.”"
Health,fc221kc,t1_fc0brsh,1577337305.0,"“e.g. young people often don't need a flu vaccine, since they can most likely get through a flu with no problems,”

This is where you’re wrong. It’s not just about protecting yourself. Vulnerable populations have to catch the flu somewhere, and unfortunately, that’s often the “young people” you mention. They can carry the virus while fighting it off, and in that time spread the flu to vulnerable people.

“Young people” need the vaccine too, to prevent becoming a carrier that infects those vulnerable populations that you agree need protection from the flu."

We call the UK smarties “rockets,” iirc.

Edit: Okay, I stand corrected by angry American candy lovers.

UK/Canadian smarties are candy coated chocolate.

US smarties are compressed flavoured sugar tablets."
science,fbxmr2x,t1_fbxeydp,1577194181.0,"I’m 100% in this boat. Where I live, kids don’t get the Hep B vaccine until 7th grade, where in other provinces they get it in infancy. 

I have a 9 month old, and spoke to his doctor about opting in to a Hep B vaccine at his 12 or 18 month vaccinations just to be on the safe side. 

You never know what he may come across in daycare, play dates, visits to the park or travels. In fact, I just found out (accidentally, his sister in law is a gossip queen) that my massage therapist is anti-vax and I have brought my son with me to massage appointments before. I’m furious and will not be going back.

We have the option (at no added cost for us, thankfully) so why deprive him of the protection?

He got the flu shot, too, despite several family members giving us the skeptical hippo eyes. That’s exactly why he and I (and dad, and my parents) all got the vaccine - if other people are going to leave themselves vulnerable to be carriers of the most dangerous strains of influenza, we better make sure that we are protected.

Yes please to ALL the vaccines. Thank you modern medicine."
vaxxhappened,fbxl0bd,t1_fbxdz5d,1577192298.0,"Oh, absolutely!! 

I had a baby this year, and I went the “expectant management” route for myself (as far as pain killers, oxytocin, etc.) but was 100% all for every recommended injection for my baby. He got the vitamin k right away. I ended up with an epidural, and oxytocin during and after labour/delivery. I trust the physicians, nurses and midwives that gave us our care, and we both had excellent outcomes despite a very long labour.

I just can’t put myself in the mindset of someone who thinks they know better than a medical professional when it comes to care of a newborn. The infant mortality rate has dropped to all-time-lows with modern medicine for a reason..."

AmItheAsshole,fbwz092,t1_fbvtiil,1577163425.0,"Hey there!! I have an in-law allergic to strawberry and pineapple, as well as a couple that are celiac, and one with a severe egg allergy and I go out of my way to decontaminate my entire kitchen before prepping food just so I can bring food that’s safe for everyone. I take it as an opportunity to try new recipes and cooking methods.

I really don’t understand people who constantly “forget” about allergies, especially after years of reminders. Everyone should be included at family gatherings. Allergies are hard enough to manage in everyday life, social gatherings shouldn’t add to that."

vaxxhappened,fbpgit5,t1_fbom9dx,1577020812.0,"Not the person you were replying to, but UGH that’s awful!!!

I didn’t have a family doctor when I was pregnant with my son (was on a wait list, small town, temporary doctor shortage) and I was very aware of the recommendations for all pregnant women to get a TDaP booster. I called around and found out the health department would give me one at the public health building! I skipped in there and got my shot and the nurses thought it was hilarious how happy I was to be getting a vaccine. I even knew the one who gave me the shot from the gym. She said it made her day to help me protect my unborn child.

My son is now 9-months-old, fully vaccinated (including flu shot) for his age, and healthy as a little horse.

His anti-vaccine aunts/uncles with kids that chronically have colds/flus/rashes/goodness-knows-what think we’re some kind of monsters. I don’t care. 

Anecdotally, our son is bigger (taller and weighs more) than any of his 4 older cousins did at his age, and is bigger than his cousin who is 3 months older.

I’m not seeing where vaccines have left him at a disadvantage in any way, shape, or form.

I hope you have a safe and healthy winter/flu/holiday season!!!"
