AmItheAsshole,feiedpj,t1_feh92oh,1579136557.0,"Similar thoughts. 

Also... it’s not for the child to claim what his family can and can’t afford. Two well paying jobs + good benefits is a great start. But you don’t really know what their expenses are. How much do they spend on mortgage or rent, cars, your education, any siblings, etc.? 

Yes, an 18 year old will have some idea of how wealthy and privileged they are... but 18 year olds tend not to really comprehend expenses. 

Child support is mandatory. If your father paid none, then your mom made a horrible choice by not pursuing. She may have some luck with backpay if not. I hope she does.  

One more thing: it’s not for you to mitigate their legal relationship and obligations. That’s way too much stress to put on your head and categorically not your problem. It’s sweet that you want to help your mom, but they chose to have a child knowing what a child costs! Don’t feel guilty because your dad IS NOT solely responsible for you financially. Both your parents are."

SkincareAddiction,fdi4af7,t3_eli2x0,1578435476.0,"**Routine -** I'm very proud of myself for finally tailoring down my routine. Below is what I'm using now which is resulting in my best skin ever. Below I list my AM and PM routine, plus a review for the other products photographed. 

**AM**

* Wash face with lukewarm water 
* Thayer's Alcohol-Free Witch Hazel in Rose Petal - Love this stuff and love the price. Don't like alcohol in my products too much, so this is the perfect base for the rest of my routine. 
* Farmacy Very Cheery Bright 15% Clean Vitamin C Serum with Acerola Cherry  - Just started using this. Makes my skin glow. First intro of Vit C in my routine. I love it. 
* Algenist Ultimate Anti-Aging Eye Cream - HG. I have been using this for 5 years. It recently occurred to me that I've never had dark circles and the fine lines I have aren't around my eyes at all. This stuff works and is a great base for concealer. 
* The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil - I've used a variety of oils but can't beat the price on this one. Especially because I'm not so precious when I use oils, I like to slather. Hydrating and great for a frequent traveler like me because I can use it on my skin and hair. 
* Josie Maran Argan Daily Moisturizer SPF 47 - I very rarely see this product used and I cannot for the life of me figure out why... It is the perfect sunscreen once you know how to use it. It's great if you warm it up in your hands first, pat it into skin, then rub. Otherwise, you get a yucky white cast. Also the bottle literally lasts me about 12 months. So moisturizing and gives me a dewy look. I've been using this for years and it's HG. 

**PM**

* (If wearing makeup) Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm - I really like this stuff. It actually had a dual effect of getting rid of my blackheads too, which was awesome! Gets eye makeup completely off but does take a little while. I wanted to get off makeup wipes for environmental reasons and I'm glad I did. It rinses off well with water, but I cleanse afterwards anyway. 
* Korres Greek Yogurt Foaming Cleanser (used with my Clarisonic) - Soapless cleanser. My skin loves yogurt and honey, so this works great for me.
* Thayer's Alcohol-Free Witch Hazel in Rose Petal 
* Asarai Sleepercell Retinol Serum - An Instagram buy that totally changed my skin. Completely cleared up my skin. My skin glows in the morning. I have one wrinkle threatening to take over my forehead and LITERALLY OVERNIGHT, it started to plump up again. Huge fan, can't recommend this company enough. Only need one pump.
* **OR** Farmacy Honeymoon Glow AHA Resurfacing Serum with Hydrating Honey - Love this stuff. Gets rid of acne overnight. I've started using it on my bacne too and it works great for that. Well worth the price. Only need one pump. 
* Algenist Ultimate Anti-Aging Eye Cream 
* The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil 

**Masks**

* Asarai Earth Tones Face Mask - Love this clay mask. I use this 2-3 times a week as instructed. The only clay mask that I find hydrating. One down side is that is stains like crazy. I take it off with cleanser (which is directed) but I also use my Clarisonic to take it off. 
* Farmacy Honey Potion Renewing Antioxidant Hydration Mask - This is a warming and hydrating mask. I like it because it smells great and leaves my skin moisturized. 

**Products not in routine (but shown in photo)**

* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - think I'm the only person on this entire website for whom this product just... did nothing. I've used a ton of TO products and even when I got results, they never lasted. Think the whole brand wasn't made for me. Except for the oils! 
* Farmacy Honey Drop Lightweight Moisturizer - This didn't work for my face. My skin broke out from use. I didn't bother persisting. However, I use this when I do my routine on my back (I get bacne) and my back seems quite happy with it."

You get harassed if you’re a woman (like me). Nobody listens to you. It’s degrading. It’s exhausting. And, for me, the worst part was that my bosses fully did not want me to succeed. 

I got out. Best move I ever made. Though, tbqh, I miss making slides. I love slides."

Try going to the big guys and opening something so you can deposit your cash. Then open a Monzo account on your phone and you’ll have full access to your money from your device.

My boyfriend was supporting me completely for like 2-3 months, and helping me occasionally before that. He actively saved and set aside some money for replenishing my skincare because he knows I love it.
