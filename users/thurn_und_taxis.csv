I would almost have an anxiety attack any time I had to enter a dark room and turn on the light, because you’d inevitably see one *skitter skitter* into the shadows."
aww,ffbvhac,t1_ffbpvip,1579784133.0,"Whenever I’ve been to the National Zoo in DC, the red pandas are the ones snoozing the day away. The giant pandas are usually just sitting around like couch potatoes eating enormous piles of bamboo, but hey, at least they’re awake. It’s pretty fun to watch them eat.

The one time I saw active red pandas at another zoo, they were fighting each other over who got to lay on the best tree branch. Granted, even their fighting was pretty damn adorable."

relationship_advice,ffa25uz,t1_ff9w856,1579726380.0,"Is it possible your wife is feeling like she doesn’t get thanked enough for pulling her own weight around the house?

I know she’s basically arguing that thanking is unnecessary, but I can’t help but wonder if what she’s really feeling is more “you never thank me for bringing in the groceries; why should I thank you?” That would be much more understandable to me than just “thanking partners for doing expected chores is always wrong”. 

I think you either have a relationship where both partners express appreciation for that kind of stuff, or you have one where you both avoid it. Personally, I’d rather be in the relationship with more expression of appreciation, even if it’s not really necessary all the time."

Naturally I was concerned, so I called them back to see if I’d missed a legitimate call. They assured me that if the call had been real, whoever made it would try again in a few minutes. I never heard back from them so I guess someone just faked their number."
AskReddit,femnl76,t1_feml2g6,1579263813.0,"Baby alpaca wool is really nice too. It’s not cheap but definitely nowhere near $150 a skein. I bought a hat made with it just yesterday. I usually find wool hats to be extremely itchy; I even find my acrylic Carhartt beanie to be itchy after a while. The alpaca hat doesn’t itch *at all*. And it’s super light, warm and soft."
makemychoice,fehn9yz,t3_ep73lt,1579119996.0,"I think staying seems like a good option since it seems like you can afford it and your place looks awesome. I would only say that I kinda disagree with what you say about Craigslist - most people who are living in shared apartments will let you do your own thing and not dictate how the space is set up just because they got there first. So if you feel like you have to do your due diligence, you could very selectively reach out to a few open room ads and see if you hit the jackpot. If you don’t, stay where you are."
newengland,fefu4fw,t1_fef2orj,1579065266.0,"So I moved to Portland from Boston last year, and I feel like the above commenter is somewhat exaggerating the travel issues. Boston to Portland is 2 hours without traffic. It does get really bad on summer weekends, but you won’t need to worry about that. Just avoid Boston rush hour (4-7pm) and you’ll be fine in April. Also, 8 hours to Springfield? I’m not as familiar with that drive, but it’s just over 3 hours without traffic, and the only city you pass through is Portsmouth...I have a hard time imagining the hellish traffic scenario that would make it take 8 hours. (I’m sure it’s happened, I just don’t think you need to worry about it.)

I love Portland and think it’s totally worth visiting in the off-season, but if you’ll be able to come back next year, maybe the Cape side trip is a better idea. I don’t think Springfield is particularly worth visiting, but if it’s on your way back to NYC and there’s something you want to see there, then that makes sense. 

I might recommend taking Rte 84 from Boston to NYC, passing through Sturbridge if you like historical stuff. Also if you take 84 you’ll pass the Traveler Restaurant just on the Connecticut side of the MA/CT border. There’s a huge sign that says “Food and Books” that’s visible from the highway. It’s a restaurant and used book store in one, and you get 3 free books with your meal. The food is nothing special but it’s fun and cozy. I pretty much always stop there if I am driving down 84 :)"
aww,fefsl8v,t1_fefixyg,1579063947.0,"I completely agree that irresponsible breeding is awful and a huge problem. However I’m not sure this particular deformity is related to inbreeding. This dog looks similar to another dog named Beaux Tox - [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thedodo.com/amphtml/close-to-home/labrador-dog-unusual-face-finds-family) article explains that he got squished by his siblings in the womb and was the only one to be born a little misshapen. In Beaux’s case he’s otherwise healthy and happy so hopefully this dog is, too."

AskReddit,fdnroql,t1_fdnf9tg,1578591482.0,"I come from a family of “announcers”. My parents tell each other every time they’re about to do anything. It’s not exactly asking permission, but it’s sort of implied that you are announcing it in case the other person was hoping you would do something else instead. “Hey honey, I’m gonna go take a shower now. I’m gonna go work on the bills. I’m gonna start putting lunch together. I’m gonna have a snack. I’m gonna just chill out for a bit.” All. Damn. Day."
mildlyinteresting,fdn367l,t1_fdmzlo3,1578575919.0,"A lot of charities with high overhead aren’t scams per se; they’re just run somewhat inefficiently. Low overhead is pretty much always a good sign of a well-run charity (as long as their mission is sensible). But high overhead isn’t always bad. Overhead will vary a lot based on the mission and target audience. A charity that makes grants to research institutions and targets a young audience probably only needs to have a website and a few administrative employees, and maybe a contract with a creative agency. A charity that runs a nationwide network of volunteer groups, or organizes overseas excursions to do charitable work, or tries to lobby and raise public awareness for a cause, will always have much higher overhead. If their audience is older, they’ll likely need to produce a lot of print and mail campaigns, maybe even contract with a call center to make phone calls. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t exist. 

It’s bad when an inordinate amount of money is going to executive salaries or ineffectual advertising. Also, a different but related issue is when charities advertise one mission but really spend most of their funds on another. A lot of disease charities are guilty of this - they brand themselves as “finding the cure to ___” because that’s the most hopeful message, but most of their budget is actually spent on advocacy and awareness. Whether those things are worth spending money on depends on the disease, but it’s never a good thing to mislead your donors."
relationship_advice,fafhtmj,t1_faefgck,1576023099.0,"My boyfriend called me his ex’s name a few times in the first 6 months of our relationship. Our names start with the same letter but otherwise aren’t that similar. I didn’t love it, but I knew it was an honest mistake so I let it slide. That being said...he never slipped up while saying “I love you” or during sex. I definitely would have felt more strongly about that, though I still don’t think I would have ended the relationship over it. But it would have been a serious argument for sure."
