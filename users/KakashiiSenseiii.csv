leaves,fe5gz6k,t1_fe42ovy,1578869323.0,Well apparently your right about the brain development part but how does it actually damage your brain and nah I dont think i need meeting and recovery bruh

leaves,fe4escr,t1_fe3upa7,1578858508.0,It varies but today for example i was wanting to buy Â£60pounds worth smoke 3.5g today sell the rest and start trying to quit tomorrow as its a new week but i decided against that bullshit copout. And this is a refreshing way of thinking about it thank you so much for this comment I will mind this in the future thank you so much. All the best to you my friend
leaves,fe4e0yg,t1_fe3vs4g,1578858314.0,You're so right! Today's  nearly done and I've been stressed and craving weed all day  but i dont always want to be like this everytime i don't smoke so i guess I'll as you say ill just need to suck it and and get on with it day by day and hopefully I can get 1 week done then go for 2
leaves,fe4dgh4,t1_fe42ovy,1578858093.0,Nah i swear its if your smoking it constantly before your 16 it can affect your brain
leaves,fe2ph5c,t1_fe2m2b7,1578841475.0,Yes all i can do is take a day at a time of course. Ehh dont really see what your on about how am I making it out to be 'wild' im just honestly describing it. I do understand when cravings hit and I've already had many today and resisted. As i said i do want to quit but at the same time i don't its tough man especially when all your friends and the family i stay with smoke it and don't care if you smoke it again and thats why i posted this to try and get some support to quit and hear what other people have been doing. And to answer you question yes you can fail at the first hurdle but still won't to quit
leaves,fe2ldg2,t1_fe2j9sg,1578839896.0,"Thank you for your comment tbh the symptoms aren't too bad apart from the sweats and not being able to sleep but when i don't have weed i feel like my brain is racing. I exercise and run and still sweat at night and I've got a rolling tray with all my stuff on it and I'm thinking right now of binning all the stuff on it but i just can't see myself binning my grinders as i can see myself using it again in the future, ohh im sorry if this isny making much sense but i want to quit and don't want to at the same time ohh its just the first initial 1, 2 weeks for me. My goal is to stop for a week and then move onto a month but in already tempted to get abit the now uggghh its annoying cause i know I'll be better off without it"
