pettyrevenge,fdda0lb,t1_fdd5t2n,1578301861.0,I did that once. Our classrooms had a teachers office connected to them in the back and I pissed in the teachers trash can after he refused to let me leave the classroom. He sent me to the principals office and I didn't get in trouble. Partly because teachers weren't supposed to refuse bathroom breaks and partly because my mom had already had it out with the schools administration over something else and they didn't want her to come back for round 2.
news,fca47fa,t1_fca2oz0,1577562824.0,"I've had a flu shot a handful of times and I've had the flu like 3-4 times, each time were in years when I didn't get the vaccine. You really have to look at the overall numbers rather than anecdotal evidence."
witcher,fc61uta,t3_edrzcn,1577470374.0,"This is definitely one of my few criticisms of the show. I really don't understand what the show gains by giving the viewer very little information or context as to when the scenes are taking place. I put the pieces together while watching but I think it would have been better to either put small interludes with simply a date or something like ""X years ago..."" for a couple seconds between the flashback/time jump scenes.

It doesn't help that Geralt looks to be the same age-wise in every scene once he's become a Witcher and basically any flashback using the same actors doesn't make it obvious with makeup that the characters are younger/older. I think I would have been able to appreciate the scenes more from the start had I known when they were taking place.

I haven't read the books or played the games so I didn't have information from them as context either. I can't remember another show being as confusing as this one with flashbacks and I honestly don't see the reason or what the show gains for doing it."
