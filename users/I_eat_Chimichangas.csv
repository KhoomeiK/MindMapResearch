MMA,ff89yuz,t1_ff88zb0,1579670417.0,"Yeah I was.  Don’t try to tell someone on the internet they are lying when you don’t know them.  I’m not that way anymore because I have a wife, kid and full time job.  I used to be that way when it was on the top of my priorities list."
MMA,ff88b0y,t1_ff7eojc,1579668904.0,I’ll argue this until the cows come home or he pops. He isn’t that big that he has to be on juice.  In college I ran 20-30 miles a week and walked 3-5 miles a day for my work.  I lifted weights and I was that swole.  It’s not impossible.  Y’all act like any swole person has to be on roids.

ufc,fewhr25,t1_fewdjop,1579410801.0,"Have to be honest, I used to think they were hugging.  Saw an mma fight every once in a while, and couldn’t stand grappling.  Now that I am more knowledgeable I love the grappling exchanges.  Can’t hate on casuals for not having the knowledge."

MMA,feu11zn,t1_fetui64,1579382092.0,All my casual friends are buying the ppv.  They don’t even know who cowboy is but they want to see Conor.
MMA,fetzcgl,t3_eqm4xh,1579381528.0,Yoel getting the belt.  I think he will wrestle Izzy and stop him with a tko by ground and pound.
MMA,fend55i,t3_eq37vr,1579282137.0,Gsp looks like he’s ready for a 155 bout

todayilearned,feitl0x,t1_fei8wz0,1579146860.0,I’d use every penny that I won and however much more it took to track those monsters down and murder them.  I can’t imagine what that would be like to lose a child.  Whoever did that deserves more pain than I can describe.

ufc,fe7w1ev,t1_fe7v8a6,1578919838.0,You have a point but that’s people being priced out.  I don’t think people are priced out on beer.  The 13.99 bud 12 pack vs the 8.99 craft ipa is not the same as the 25k Camry vs the 100k corvette z06.
ufc,fe7srpt,t1_fe6eiuw,1578918864.0,What does it mean then?  If something is purchased more often doesn’t it mean it’s the more desirable product?
ufc,fe69o4g,t1_fe65maa,1578884885.0,I don’t drink anymore but I loved Bud.  Sells more than any other beer in America.
MMA,fdzdj0u,t1_fdz5an4,1578789203.0,Well to be fair they have less finishes in general.  I love watching flyweight but it can be frustrating.  Sometimes they lock up submissions and I think this is the end.  Nope.  They are more flexible and quick so they slip out.  They have less KOs too.  I think the average person just want to see big dudes flatline each other.
MMA,fdxy8v0,t3_enby8y,1578774146.0,So slick.  He slips that arm under the neck lightning quick
funny,fdx1du7,t3_en7lpo,1578764288.0,Nah it’s just her boots ain’t up
MMA,fdwfx5u,t1_fdwdhkp,1578758245.0,I agree.  I just don’t think Dana cares about that.  Sterling or Yan should get the fight.  We will see what happens though.  Cejudo should be calling for a contender
MMA,fdrudtk,t1_fdrpoq5,1578689874.0,I am not saying you are wrong.  All I’m saying is everybody involved wants that fight and it’s gonna be watched by hardcore fans and casuals.  As a promoter it’s a slam dunk no brainer.
MMA,fdru78e,t1_fdrt1bf,1578689763.0,It’s the same with Aldo.  Adesanya wants it.  Yoel wants it and Dana wants it.  It may be bull but if I’m the promoter that is a slam dunk fan favorite.
MMA,fdrcxsn,t1_fdrc1kx,1578682689.0,"Not op but I think Aldo won.  He shouldn’t get to skip the line but cejudo is the champ and wants the fight and so does Aldo.  What do you do?  If I’m Dana, I make that fight."
ufc,fdowdfg,t1_fdovdcf,1578614385.0,I will be too

I’d like to think it’s our schedule.  We never miss a nap at 12:30-1, she never goes to bed late (8pm) and we always do a wind down process without fail.  Realistically I think we are just blessed with a child that loves sleep."
