When you run across another town, you can build a trading post in yours.

You get stuff every now and then, but do no trading. 

It is just click here, and in 10 minutes you will have some resources."

You will need more constraints, after all, you don't have a student should only be in the courses they are in....

Professors should only be lecturing in courses they know.

You are going to generate more than one multi dimensiony cubey thingy (technical term)

    m = Model(with_optimizer(Cbc.Optimizer))
    
    @variable(m, crt[1:nc,1:nr,1:nt], Bin) # crt = course room time. (which course, is in which room at which time)
    @variable(m, pct[1:np,1:nc,1:nt], Bin) # pct = professor course time. (professor is teaching which course at which time)
    @variable(m, sct[1:ns,1:nc,1:nt], Bin) # sct = studient course time. (studient is at which course at which time)
    
    #CONSTRAINTS
    
    #1. To same place and time, we can schedule at most one course
    @constraint(m, one_course_by_pt[p=1:np,t=1:nt], sum(crt[:,r,t]) <= 1)
    
    #2. All courses takes two time slots
    @constraint(m, course_has_two_time_slots[c=1:nc], sum(crt[c,:,:]) == 2)
    
    #3. A course cannot be scheduled to two different places at the same time (no sections)
    @constraint(m, course_not_in_two_places_at_same_time[c=1:nc,t=1:nt], sum(crt[c,:,t]) <= 1)
    
    #4. A professor cannot be in two different lectures at the same time
    @constraint(m, no_time_travelling_professors[c=1:nc,t=1:nt], sum(pct[:,c,t]) <= 1)
    
    #5. A student cannot be in two different lectures at the same time
    @constraint(m, no_time_travelling_studients[s=1:ns,t=1:nt], sum(sct[:,c,t]) <= 1)
    
    #6. A student should only be in course they are in
    @constraint(m, studients_are_lazy[s=1:ns,c=1:nc,t=1:nt], sct[s,c,t] <= S[s,c])
    
    #7. professors should only be in course they are in
    @constraint(m, processors_are_lazy[p=1:ns,c=1:nc,t=1:nt], pct[p,c,t] <= P[p,c] )

    # maximise student participation, or put in a constraint that suidents should show up to both courses....


Haven't tested any of it, but, it will more or less end up looking something like this. You may need a thing so the course times match between the rooms, and professors, and rooms and students.

You COULD put it in one giant cube, and constraint on that.... that would also work."

It is not that easy to spot.

Trade just gives you stuff directly each time, it doesn't, for instance, take ANY of your resources.

It just gives you stuff."
paradoxplaza,fc59gvq,t1_fc59fs8,1577449840.0,"Yeah, as the other storage stuff shows what it has in its own area, so does the gate.

I ALSO freaked out when I first saw it all there ;)

Good game so far, I haven't worked out how to get my people to do multistep stuff on the world map yet though, they added it this patch, but I can't seem to make it work.

BTW farms are super good, since you don't need people in them when they are growing stuff, so it frees up so many people."
paradoxplaza,fc59d6d,t3_eg9k6n,1577449710.0,"Because it IS it's own storage.

Click on the gate, and you will see the gate itself is a storage site, a pretty chunky one at that.

None of your stuff will go bad or anything, they are in good hands in the gate."
