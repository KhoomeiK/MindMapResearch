The problem was, I wasn’t chewing it well enough and swallowed it mindlessly, causing some really rough indigestion as it got further into my gut. Can’t remember the poop being a fun time either. Chewing it until it’s fully, fully broken down is key. I eat my steak rare - slowly and mindfully, and I don’t have any stomach issues with them."

Even it’s premium quality beef that’s been ground, if it’s been left around in heat for bacteria to grow, it is not safe to undercook. That’s why supermarket packaged beef isn’t safe to undercook, even with preservatives it’s not shipped with zero pathogens in mind."

It’s the only way you’ll get that texture, it’s what steak does that ground beef or chicken or pork can’t do. More cooked steak is fine, but rare is completely unique. I would get a rib-eye medium rare, just because as a cut it’s better suited for it. But will fillet, rare every time."

Christ though, no need for condescension. I’m aware of those contributions, I think they’re inadequate and are outweighed by the drawbacks. Financially unequal societies are inherently divisive and unhappy ones. Ireland has created an economy built on being a tax haven and it can’t last forever.

As another comment mentioned, CBT can be really useful for managing anxiety, particularly anxious thoughts. 

Also look for any triggers you have - excessive caffeine, low blood sugar, poor sleep. Avoid or manage these triggers if you know they effect you, and try journaling some of your thoughts down each day. It’s also normal to be anxious due to uncertainty, so at the moment it’s understandable that you’d be in a feedback loop with anxiety leading to job break leading to HR being wankers.

Sarcasm aside, I’m not going to measure dicks about experience in homelessness services, that seems unproductive. On PMVT, how is their accommodation finder bullshit, and not more indicative of the fact that landlords themselves have a bias for “homeless mothers and babas” over single men? How does that surprise you?

Also, you’re kind of confusing hidden homeless people (I.e, couch-surfing, non registered homeless people) with registered homeless people. I’m sure you’re familiar with the PASS system and registration, so if they’re on there; they are not hidden. I agree that there is a serious issue with engaging individuals not regularly staying in homeless services - except for maybe the PMVT day service, or the Capuchin Centre.

HOWEVER, punishment works best on animals with no higher order reasoning, and they are conditioned to avoid a behaviour or prompt that initiated the punishment. Humans just perceive people as mean or unfair. Especially because punishment is to discourage behaviour, it cannot help in skill acquisition.

This all might sound obvious but from a psychological standpoint it is interesting how there’s elements of useful approaches here combined into an utter failure.

Just him expressing his close minded view of who adds value to Ireland and who is probably just a scrounger, without any direct reference to the needs of people raised through poverty and trauma. That, coupled with his campaign against welfare cheats, which is a laughably small issue in Ireland and costs far less than scrambling to pay Apple €30 billion they owe us.

I’m sorry but no politician makes a slogan like that without thinking it through, I think he’s perfectly aware of the implication it has on those already seen as “others” in Irish society."

So just like homeless people turfed out of services by 10am, right?"
tifu,fdmvqhk,t1_fdlmo4r,1578568054.0,"It’s bi erasure and it’s a real problem that bi people experience, both men and women alike. Women tend to be fetishised more for bisexuality, and men tend to be emasculated more by people with strict views of masculinity. It’s a damn shame, because without all that being bi would probably be pretty damn fun."

How do you miss a message that war at its core utterly degraded humanity? It’s painted all over the film. The deeper Sheen goes into Vietnam the more animalistic and tribal his fellow soldiers become. It ends with a complete detachment from reality with Kurtz’s tribe, the extreme resolution of all jingoism, nationalism and barbaric military training. 

I’m sorry, but I cannot see how you could even pretend that movie is pro-war for a moment. The senseless deaths of half the characters highlight the pure chaos of war, and how cheap life becomes in it. Every line Brando has defines how simply evil abuse of military power is. I would strongly recommend re-watching it and considering how dehumanisation as an aspect of military training is explored in AN.

Even with your conclusion - which is that to win the war, the US needed to commit genocide because diplomatic victory was impossible - doesn’t support genocide. It rebuts the idea that the Vietnam war had a purpose beyond Cold War control."

The main corridor of the Uffizi is a a ‘U’ shaped hall that branches off to different display rooms. On the ceiling of that ‘U’ are dozens of distinctly painted tableaus that go the entire stretch of hall. It’s genuinely incredible how much detail is in each one."
