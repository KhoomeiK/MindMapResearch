My poor boy already was a hot mess, then got assaulted by some hornets last year and after being repeatedly stung and rushed to the ER vet, his anxiety sprung through the roof at any odd object that he doesn‚Äôt notice immediately.. I do CBD drops in his breakfast every day which helps a little, but my guy will always be a big old baby lol"
AnimalsBeingDerps,fc6atet,t1_fc62fer,1577476248.0,"Came here specifically to see how many people claim this is abuse. Got my dog as a puppy and he has ALWAYS been afraid of everything. I drop a shoe, he‚Äôs out. Occasionally lighters, remote controls, hell even my phone scares him sometimes! He just runs off and barks and when I pet whatever object and tell him it‚Äôs nice he‚Äôs all good. But holy shit last time I posted a video like this I just had to delete it. 

Grow up people! Just because there is a fear of something, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre abused. I‚Äôm petrified of the dark, spiders, and many other things, but my parents didn‚Äôt beat the shit out of me. Give your good boy the biggest belly rub for me!"
