It doesn't matter how hard or dark it is. There's always a way to turn things around.
I'm sure you've seen or read the Harry Potter movies or books. So remember this quote from Dumbledore. ""Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places, if only one remembers to turn on the light"""

Everything did turn out nicely, I did chemotherapy for 6 long difficult months and after the doctors ran a few tests and now I'm 100% cancer free"
offmychest,ff18dpf,t3_er2wg9,1579476250.0,"My friend, life at points seems to be stone walling you at every turn you make. However, this world has a rhythm to it. A principle that it follows. That is principle is that it never takes or gives everything. Whatever happens there is always something you can do.

You say they all hate you. You say they all have given up on you. Now you'll know the actual situation better any one. There must be some way you can turn everything around. My first advice is be independent from them. Try to find a job to get some money flowing through your plan to become successful. If you need to go to college first that's fine, but you need to understand that ""Convenience is built through inconvenience"" - Steve Harvy. My great successful famous people didn't get their break away until later in life. For example The founder of KFC didn't really start to generate money from his food until he was 60 something and Morgan Freeman didn't get famous until he was in his 50s. I assuming your 18 years old. You still have your whole life a head of you.

I am studying to become a robotics engineer. Now last year I was under performing at school as I physically wasn't capable of working as hard as I used to no one reallyunderstood why. The year before everything was fine. However this summer I found out I have cancer. On my birthday I was rushed to the hospital. The doctors ran a few test and broke the news to me. The worst thing you can tell a person. Everything seemed as bleak as it is to you if not worse. However I figured if I was ever going to through this, it could never be for anyone or because of someone's support I did it for me. No one else. If you really want to be famous you, then you don't need anyone's support you have yourself for that. Now go out there I turn things around. I want to see you on the billboards. 

I know you can do it."

I made up a story to make it sound cooler. I say ""I fought a lion"". Now they get the same reaction you have rn and then I proceed to say it's from a fight.

You probably won't make up something. So you can just say it's from an operation I had to do a while back. If they ask for more info just say you don't want to talk about it."

cancer,fe2h7jz,t3_enhkl7,1578838332.0,"I am also 21. I also went through chemotherapy, but to be fair it's nothing like yours. I had it once every 2 weeks. I felt everything you're feeling, though I don't have a girlfriend (as single as they come). Since you believe in god you know that he'll never through something your way that you simply couldn't go through.

 Yes it's hard. Sometime you feel like it just won't stop, but here's the thing you can do it. The whole thing with the bills and such do not worry about it. I am sure your parents couldn't care less about the money. You're their everything. The most important part of their lives. They made you. Your dad worked hard his whole life just to provide for you and your mother. Your mother carried for 9 long months. They both want you to be in the best health you can be in. Don't ever think that what you're going through doesn't make them worry, but they know you're strong and they sure as hell are not giving up on you so you better not give up on yourself and them. I know you're strong really strong. Then there's your girl. My friend you have got yourself a keeper. She's one of the real ones. She didn't leave you when things got hard. She chose to be with you. She obviously loves you. There's not much else to say.

You will get through this and things will only get easier from here. Have faith in god and yourself. I believe in you."
