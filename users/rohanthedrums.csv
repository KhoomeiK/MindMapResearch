depression,fep9t4o,t3_eq6elj,1579315355.0,"Not entirely true.. I’m turning sixteen in a month and I have  serious chronic depression.. it has gotten to the point where I am on track to fail ALL of my classes despite being a straight A student for almost every year of formal school.. I have no friends as I find friends exhausting and have feelings for a crush who I have already confessed my feelings towards and every time I see her a small part of me hurts so bad inside..

But anyway: the point is that I HAVE thought about what I want to be as an adult - a musician and an inventor.. I want to CREATE. That’s the kind of person I am. I want to be a software/hardware developer and a musician. The problem with depression is I know I won’t get there because if I don’t even make it through high school I’m screwed"

I don’t know what you could do about it to avoid getting hurt.. BUT I think you should talk to someone at your school like a counselor or something and just tell them your situation and make sure they keep it a secret until they can ensure you are safe. YOUR PARENTS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE!! And you are not that.. YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON!! ..really.. I mean being able to deal with them and still know kindness in your heart speaks wonders about you as a person.. and if you read this please know that your parents have been LYING to you about your worth.. they wouldn’t know a gift like you if it beat them down (just like they beat you).. so KEEP GOING because you are SO MUCH BETTER than any of the psychos, abusers, and others in your life make you feel..

depression,febhm4o,t1_febgteh,1578958856.0,"I’m not entirely sure.. but part of it is that I know it will hurt.. I KNOW that some part of me will fight back, and I don’t have the strength to keep it subdued.. I know it will win. It’s almost like I’m scared of being scared of death itself..

And then the other part is that.. whenever I’m there.. whenever I have the way out, and all I have to do is continue onward.. I suddenly feel lonely. Suddenly the only thing that matters is turning to see a loved one, someone who truly cares.. and then part of me BELIEVES that there CAN BE that person there.. so I stop killing myself -

And I want to die."

This is what we need to hear. This is real support. Not always “don’t worry things are going to be okay” and “you have to believe things will get better.” But the truth.. we don’t know if anything will change.. we aren’t sure that things will turn up and improve.. but we want to be there for you and with you.

Anyways I GET IT. I’m with you the whole way.... you just perfectly articulated and phrases every thought in my mind..

It would be sooo much easier to just end all my pain. I don’t care about living. The only thing that has kept me alive for several months now was the stupid, naive, misguided hope that maybe I could find love. But as time goes on I’m starting to become more logical about it, realizing that this will not happen.. so the prospect of jumping off of a tall building becomes more appealing every single day.."

depression,fe0uh0v,t1_fe0tnwm,1578818762.0,Thanks for the support.

depression,fe0ta2w,t1_fe0sqoa,1578818389.0,"Omg right?? It’s like sometimes I wonder if there was some fundamental part of my brain that never developed because I constantly find myself unable to deal with my surrounding and connect with other people..

depression,fe0scmp,t1_fe0rno9,1578818112.0,There’s this self destructive part of me that ruins every relationship I have because it’s afraid that I’ll lose it (although in some cases cutting the relation is the best option anyways)
depression,fe0s55y,t1_fe0rno9,1578818028.0,"Hmm.. when you put it that way you’re right. I went through serious childhood trauma with my dad openly abusing my mom and since then my mom has started to become more and more erratic and emotionally stagnant, leaving me with no family (my mom’s siblings and etc are all shallow as hell). I have essentially no friends, partially because I don’t want friends. I find that the energy I have to put in to maintain friendships is not worth the result. I can do fine without forcing myself to laugh at other people’s stupid jokes or conversing with them about school. I’ve always had an extreme fear of abandonment after my dad separated from my mom and I lived with only my mom."

See, I told my crush my feelings for her over text after school got out on the last day before break. She basically said no but invited me to be friends. Me being the depressed, socially anxious coward I am said yes to being friends and I continued to text her throughout the break and stopped as break was coming to an end. Then I basically ignored her despite still having feelings for her because I’m too weak to deal with my feelings and the situation I’ve created. Whenever I’m near her, I have an insane urge to run as fast as I can away from the situation. I know I’m being a bad person, and probably really cold/mean. That’s not my intention and it kills me inside to know I’m doing that, but at the same time I don’t have the courage not the willpower to fix this. I really want to die."
