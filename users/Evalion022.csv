He didnt do the best job of communicating when he wanting to use house rules/written rules, so there were a few issues but it normally worked quite well. Were a few issues though towards the end of him calling wisdom or dexterity saving throws instead of will or dex ones as he was used to 5e. Made it almost impossible to make some saves and a lot of magic items became useless."

DMAcademy,fekqn8u,t3_epkcub,1579205597.0,"As a DM I actually really enjoy prepping for my wizard. I run Pathfinder 1e so I am able to use preconstructed spellbooks which I can use the more powerful versions of as rewards for quests or as part of a major story arc focused on him.

Also if fun to build literal libraries for him to go to and find spells every so often. It gives me another way to balance the game by giving him diffrent spells that he can use which allows me to throw certain enemies and environments at the parties that they are capable of fighting."

Pathfinder_RPG,fcody5z,t3_ei85nd,1577829897.0,"TLDR: Derailed a session to save my characters life, possess a red panda with the soul of a demon, and awaken a gecko to become a druid. Ended up burning down a church in the process while also becoming servants of another church.

Finally was a player seeing how normally I am a DM. The party of 6 others I was with completely derailed the entire session our DM had planned.

My character died the previous session, yet was resurrected by some locals who messed up the spell, I had a week to live so we went to a nearby church to try and save me.

The church of the sun didnt like the church of the moon and saw them as pretenders worshiping a false god, we were told to go and kill those inside and destroy their artifacts.

My character did not like this as I was a lunar oracle. So instead we went to the church of the moon and I went inside to see what we were facing and to get information. Our paladin on the outside used detect evil and found a strong evil presence inside. Our cleric had an idea, and took the paladin to check for evil in the church of the sun. The evil inside was overwhelming and almost knocked the paladin unconscious.

Said screw it and told the church of the moon we were hired to kill them to save my life, but would be willing to destroy the church of the sun in return to properly resurrect me and possess our pet red panda with a demon (dont ask).

They agreed, and we went out to destroy the church of the sun. Our sorcerer went and grabbed a few gallons of really high proof alcohol and met us at the church of the sun. Some of the party went inside and said I died in the fight along with our half-dragon barbarian. They got the church to instead awaken our leopard gecko pet before they went outside.

The barbarian and I flew up the the roof with the alcohol and a red panda demon thing and doused it with drink. The moment the party stepped outside we tickled the pandas stomach to get it to burp out flames while I used moonlight bridge to block off the entrance and burn everyone inside.

Those inside dispelled my bridge and teleported away once they got outside."

college,fcatw8v,t3_egv2gi,1577576523.0,"At my school there are 5 diffrent options. 1 person in a room, 2 people in a room, 3 people in a room, 4 people in a room, or 4 people sharing a suite with individual rooms and a shared livingroom, kitchen, and bathroom.

Out of all of these two people in a room is most common, with only a few 3/4 people rooms sprinkled around. 1 person in a room is really only for RA's and if for whatever reason you dont have a roomate at that time.

Everyone who isnt a first-year can choose to instead go for the suite, yet these rooms are in three separate buildings in a second campus about a 10 minute walk away from the main campus."
