There are a couple of skips, and the production can still sometimes feel insufficiently layered or ""populated"" (to use a computer science metaphor), but then you have seriously impressive deep cuts like ""3am"" and ""929"" that I'd say have reached Taylor tier and feature lyrics that only Halsey would write. And I don't think I've heard her sing a quiet ballad before like ""Finally // Beautiful Stranger,"" the penultimate promotional single.

My contribution is that Taylor forgot she wrote The Moment I Knew. Someone on Tumblr artsily wrote down the opening lines of TMIK and Taylor reblogged it, posting about how she thought it was so sad, before remembering that she herself wrote those lines.

Also, during her CapitalOne Jingle Ball performance debuting Christmas Tree Farm live, she forgot a line when performing 22 acoustically."

How desperately she sings the bridge of Haunted

How ""they see right through me"" echoes in the background of The Archer even before it hits the top line lyrics

The lo-fi taunts in the background of Better Than Revenge

The changing prechorus of The Lucky One. That gets me every time.

TaylorSwift,fcp7tjf,t3_eibylg,1577853364.0,"Taylor quoted on genius.com: ‘Haunted’ is about the moment that you realize the person you’re in love with is drifting and fading fast. And you don’t know what to do, but in that period of time, in that phase of love, where it’s fading out, time moves so slowly. Everything hinges on what that last text message said, and you’re realizing that he’s kind of falling out of love. That’s a really heartbreaking and tragic thing to go through, because the whole time you’re trying to tell yourself it’s not happening. I went through this, and I ended up waking up in the middle of the night writing this song about it.
