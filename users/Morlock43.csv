Yo be honest, while I absolutely adored the film, I did feel like they were rushing to get things rounded off and be ""done"" with this thing that had brought them so much hate from people.

I think there was enough in TROS to have two movies with more character development time given to exploring Rey's conflict and Ben's guilt.

A longer confrontation with her dark self would have helped define her choice to rise above her blood. She could have faced and failed to defeat her dark side in one film and triumphed in the second after undergoing more development and experience.

I really think all the vitriol aimed at these movies sucked the life out if the creatives who were then just left contractually obliged to do something.

I remember the years between Return and Phantom when we had not a single peep of new content on the big screen and I despaired at all the unreasoning hate aimed at the cast and crew.

I think we got as good as we could get under the conditions.

I think there could have been more and I hope that this is not the last star wars film we get for another decade..."

Focus on the story, ignore your actual level as you will mist likely level up fast. 

Don't worry about out levelling content as that doesn't really happen. You will get levelled down to whatever content you are doing so it will always be fun if not super challenging.

Pick one companion you like to level them up via conversation and gifts. Any comp can do any role do pick your favourite rather than the one you think you ""need""

I burned through the main class story to get Jaesa and now I'm going back to do all the planetary at s and bonus arcs with her ♥️.

If you have a set of shell gear you can get mods cheap on the fleet (supply section - outer ring) that will help keep your gear current as you level up. 

The vendors on fleet take you all the way to 70 and are easily afforded as long as you are doing missions and not squandering credits on the GTN.

Take slicing early to help fill your pockets and ignore crafting until you are higher level and can decide what you actually want to do.

I loved the message they gave in that film, burried as it became in the ""outrage"" by some vocal elements that pretty much prevented any sane considered conversation around the plot or the pacing.

I loved the message that anyone can become Jedi and I still think that message is there.

Why did they adjust it in TROS? I don't know, but I have my suspicions. The film was filled with direct counters to a lot of online harassment the movies cast and crew have faced. I think Rey's bloodline may have been one of those messages, but again, if you look at it in the story context, Rey and by extension we were told a version if the truth in TLJ.

Rey's parents were nobody. They chose to be nobody. They chose to run from their bloodline. So, as Obi-Wan would say, it was the truth... From a certain perspective.

And remember us was the dark side she was asking for answers from. Since when has anyone said the dark side doesn't colour the truth to suit its own purpose.

If you add the emperor in the background of all three films, a whole lot starts making sense. Snoke being super-badass and feared with no explanation was just a puppet dancing for his master.

Snoke being suckered in TLJ was emperor clouding his puppet's mind to give Kylo the kill. Yeah, a lot of Kylo fans are gonna gate me for that one....

The emperor has been playing the whole galaxy and us for fools for three films, but some people are too wrapped up in their own outrage to see what was being crafted.

I have issues with Rise. I think the film packed in too much story into too short a time frame leaving few character building slow moments between full on exposition or action.

The plot may well have been answer or appeasement to the arseholes in our community, but can we really blame the creatives for that?

TROS is not a masterpiece, but it's a good romp with some truly sweet moments and a kickass ending."
