A majority of the people at that rally were protesting the slippery slope of gun control legislation that could possibly lead to 2a revocation. It’s been happening around the world with similar rights being taken away in other countries, and often at the expense of people who are least likely to commit gun violence.

Edit: and to compare Swiss to USA is intellectually dishonest. The country's small population (321 million people less than USA) and cultural factors have led to such low shootings, such as their mandatory military service. In fact, Swiss has relatively lax gun conrtol laws so to use them as an example actually exemplifies that legal gun ownership doesn't necessarily lead to gun violence. The vast majority of firearm murders come from people who illegally obtained firearms. No amount of gun control laws sans banning guns in generaL are going to keep people who can't get them legally from obtaining the anyway."
PoliticalHumor,ff9k4uk,t1_ff9js6k,1579714709.0,I don't think you understand why the 2a is so important to Americans then. Maybe comment on your own country's system before you bash another's that you don't understand

PoliticalHumor,ff6pb89,t1_ff6ld7h,1579632056.0,"LOL, Well, YOU'RE the one who brought it up in the first place as a talking point for why they're racist. Like the people protesting over-excessive gun control laws today are the same people who passed gun control laws limiting blacks 60 years ago. That makes zero sense and drawing that parallel looks like blatent mental gymnastics on your end. The image above shows that, yes, there are people at that rally protesting for black gun ownership. And I doubt very many of them are specifically drawing sources from California's Mulford act from 1967, but that's not really the point. And even if they weren't that doesn't mean these people are advocating for suppressing gun ownership among blacks like you're implying...  What a strange claim to make, especially when the whole point of this rally was about celebrating the 2nd amendment... 

Your whole argument reeks of this: [https://imgur.com/UWR3zSU](https://imgur.com/UWR3zSU)"
PoliticalHumor,ff6l6s5,t1_ff6b0mn,1579629556.0,">Yet when the Black Panthers took advantage of their constitutional right in the 60s, new gun control laws were passed with shocking bi-partisan support. Suddenly the right saw the problem with carrying weapons.

Right, and these people are protesting those laws that disarmed blacks...

advertising,fepudt4,t1_fepu2ea,1579331626.0,"Yeah perhaps my post wasn’t specific enough. I’m pretty familiar with the notion of being underpaid and overworked and undervalued at these popular agencies, and understand all too well the concept and idea of getting in, putting in the time and getting out. I was not looking for that kind of broad advice (which I have heard many many times), and maybe I should have stated that below the title. If not for the condescending nature of his assumption about me, I probably would have simply thanked him and left it that, so I agree that I did overreact, and came across as entitled.

My post was aimed at seeing if there was anyone specifically on here with specific experience at this particular shop because I had some very specific questions I wanted to DM them about. Perhaps instead of “insight” I should have wrote “experience” in the title, though I doubt that would have stopped OP from writing the same comment."
