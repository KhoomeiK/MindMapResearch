AskScienceDiscussion,ff69rzi,t3_ervipd,1579622452.0,"Combustion is not limited to oxygen, any strong oxidizer will do. For example, hydrogen (H2) burns in chlorine (Cl2) to give hydrogen chloride (HCl). Similarly, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) burns in fluorine (F2).

Other than combustion, there are also a lot of chemistries for detonation. A typical example would be ammonium nitrate, which explodes. Nitrogen triiodide detonation is another nice example.

Really, any sufficiently energetic reaction can undergo thermal runaway. One reaction I've run (safely with no thermal runaway) is Swern oxidation. This must be run in a dry ice bath. First, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is chlorinated by oxalyl chloride with removal of oxygen to give the salt (Me2SCl)Cl. This salt will then be the actual reagent. But, if this reaction is run at room temperature, it can heat up so much that it explodes.

There are also a lot of explosive polymerizations."

europe,ff4cjwj,t1_ff44mnr,1579560422.0,"Although the loss of Soviet trade did add a lot of ""powder to the cartridge"", it was neither the ""gun"" nor the ""trigger"" for depression. You could actually say quite the opposite - the West caused it. The ""gun"" was that ""casino economy"" of the 1980s. In the 1970s and before, the Finnish credit market was very much closed. In the 1980s, the government decided the liberalize the economy to conform to Western standards, and in 1986, removed the permit process for foreign currency loans. So, ""savvy entrepreneurs"" took a lot of cheap foreign-currency loans, and made quick profits by arbitrage, as the Finnish currency markka was badly overvalued and credit was expensive, while foreign credit was cheap. This was never sustainable, as it led to an uncontrolled explosion of debt. The growth rates of personal debt reached 100% a year at best. Artificially maintaining the high exchange rate of the markka became unsustainable. This became the ""trigger"" - eventually, the Bank of Finland ran out of foreign currency, forcing their hand, and the markka was left for ~~dead~~ devaluation. The depression would have happened anyway, but the Soviet Union collapsing at the exact same time made it about twice as worse than in Sweden.

europe,ff48zr0,t1_ff2mzs7,1579558158.0,"Finland doesn't have a ""positive"" credit record system. If you have a ""credit record"" in the U.S. or the U.K., that means you have a credit score and are a really good citizen that companies trust. A good part of the credit score comes from paying utility bills on time, because every time you pay on time, this is sent to your credit record as a *positive* event. Whereas, if you have a ""credit record"" in Finland, that means that you have actually refused to pay a bill and it has either been sent to collections or to a court for recovery proceedings. There is no ""credit score"". If you have a perfect credit record, it's entirely blank. Paying on time is reported nowhere, only the *negative* - not paying at all - is. To initiate collections or recovery, the debt has to be unpaid for a substantial amount of time, at least two weeks IIRC. So everyone treats this two weeks like a free form of credit.

This doesn't mean that not actually paying at all is treated more leniently. Quite the opposite - if you take the debt to the court, they'll eventually send actual court bailiffs - not private ""fake cops"" like collections agencies - to recover the debt, and any effects, property or income can be seized. I used them against a guy that vandalized my car and declared he can't pay, and to the surprise of everyone involved, he paid after a visit by the bailiff."
europe,ff47slg,t1_ff2z125,1579557406.0,"As a monopoly, this is a regulated market, which means that the government essentially sets the rates through a rate hike cap. Following the electricity breaks caused by the named storms Hannu and Tapani in 2011, the Katainen government decided that they'll legally require the network companies to dig the cables underground, so that they can't be knocked down by falling trees - even in sparsely populated areas. This refurbishment is hilariously expensive. Accordingly, network companies have been passing this cost down to their clients. The main reason for these particularly high rate hikes hasn't even been as much the cost, but the way too optimistic refurbishment schedule set by the government.

The Marin government is now backtracking and setting a lower rate hike cap and allowing for a longer period for the refurbishment. The target date will be pushed back to 2036 from the previous 2028, which is gives substantial relief. Also, the government will double the period for which network operators will be allowed to compensate the loss accrued over unprofitable years. This will allow them to lower prices to a more stable level as well. They don't have to hurriedly recoup losses in one unprofitable period by a really high price over the next profitable period.

Translated as: ""Such a story is told that lighthouse keepers and their guest - during the Finnish prohibition - preferred to travel to the western headland of the island, in order to have a drink - on Swedish soil.""

To understand the context, go to the [interview](https://youtu.be/ytNqj9QfG70?t=353) a bit earlier in the same video. As of 1932, the exact position of the border was not yet formally settled. The lighthouse keepers considered the lighthouse Finnish territory. What was clear was that Swedish territory was in the west of the island and Finnish territory in the east of the island. So, if you went to the western end of the island (*begav sig till skärets västra uddet*), logically you must've been on Swedish territory.

It was discovered only in a later survey that the lighthouse keepers had been on Swedish territory all along, not on Finnish territory as they thought."

Modern names are misleading.

In 1927, the Mustasaari council, which was majority Swedish, decided to steal the Swedish name Korsholm from the castle. Also, Mustasaari merged with four other municipalities in the 1970s, so there's a lot of land called ""Korsholm"" named after a castle in Vaasa.

Locks they exist to keep honest people honest - a genuine crook will just pick the lock or break and enter through the door. The main function of the wall is to send a message, denote the location of the border, and to prevent casual, accidental or unintended crossing. The idea that a simple wall could just stop an attacker is misinformed - it's the scale and reaction time of the border guard response to the illegal crossing that counts, not the height of the wall.

The U.S. doesn't have any real proper border zones that could actually stop a hostile incursion. Mexico isn't really an enemy in the first place, so the U.S. didn't consider it necessary. In countries where this is a real risk, the military or border guard doesn't allow anyone to go to near the border from their own side, and there are sanctions for approaching the border too close. In the U.S. you can literally lean on the wall and not commit any crime doing so.

At sea, navigators will anyway have to obey the limits of territorial waters or risk being subjected to border control."
