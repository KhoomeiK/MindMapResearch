I have a nephrologist friend who developed prediabetes. That led to a discussion about the link between sugar and diabetes. 

He said that diabetes is mostly genetic, however, if you start to develop it, cutting back on certain foods (high carbs/sugar) and upping your exercise can help slow or stop the progression of it. He went on to say that sugar/candy, while bad for you in other ways, will not precipitate diabetes by itself in someone who is not already genetically predisposed to it. 

With all that being said, the lady in the post is predisposed to diabetes genetically. That’s where it’s coming from. Cutting back on certain foods will slow or stop the progression."

Sexconfessional,fegczy8,t1_fdqh0y9,1579088226.0,"I’m sorry, but most of what’s in the comments section of this post is absolutely terrible advice. 

“Sleep with another guy and that will get him to up his game.” One of two things will happen -

He will put up with it but get emotional, cry, etc. Most women lose respect for men who allow themselves to be walked all over. 

He will tell you to pound sand and the relationship will be over. That’s what I would do. I’m very open to the possibility of an MFM with my wife. In fact it was my idea. However, if she went out on her own  with the purposes of getting me to up my game, I would be done. 

Its very rare that you can include another person in a relationship and it not cause problems. The only time it can work is when both parties have zero jealousy and **zero insecurity**, both of which are exceptionally rare. Your BF doesn’t fit that profile at all. Most people don’t. 

The rules are the same for an open relationship. That’s a very bad idea as the woman will always be exponentially more successful than the man. 

A halfway decent looking woman can have her pick of sexual partners by the end of the day. An average man could go months with zero success. That disparity will breed resentment and eventually he’s going to just want a normal relationship, but probably not with you. 

I think your best options are - give him some time to progress sexually, or end it and find someone else. 

Is this a problem that has gone on for years, or did y’all just start having sex?

Edit - pressuring him will make it worse. I imagine your talk of threesomes is making it worse too."

There was an FBI files episode on it - Broken Trust. 

It involved a conspiracy between two farmers to scam a third farmer out of his land. They had all been very close friends. In fact, Billy Graham was like a father to one of them. 

Anyway, the conspiracy involved the two farmers, the bank that one of the farmers owned, the land bank in Columbia SC, etc. 

According to the book, Billy Graham lost his farm to the bank after the bank failed to make the agreed upon payments to the land bank. He saw what was happening however, and filed suit and was sure to win. Then his house burned down with him in it. 

The death was initially ruled as being secondary to the fire. The Medical Examiner somehow missed two bullets in his head. 

The whole thing blew up when an African American was found in a shallow grave. He was the hit man who killed Billy Graham. Lots more to the story but I don’t want to ruin it. 

Anyway, it’s a great book. The FBI files episode did a good job, but the book is much better."
