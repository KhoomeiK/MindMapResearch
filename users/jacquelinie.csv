cats,feopdo1,t1_feon0bv,1579303452.0,Highly considering
cats,feojeoc,t1_feo8g9i,1579300892.0,"I completely agree. When I first got him as a kitten, he had so many issues. Flees, worms, and a GI infection that caused him to poop EVERYWHERE. I was not expecting the cost and commitment, but I was so attached to him already. A few expensive trips to the vet and 2 medications later, heâ€™s been in perfect health. Now my parents love him and I couldnâ€™t imagine life without him"
cats,feo1tdb,t1_fenou7c,1579294021.0,Thank you! Heâ€™s the best kitty. Ragdoll/ Maine coon :)

Smoothies,feiav30,t1_fehu7fz,1579134199.0,"Thank you! I like the plant based protein powder because it is easier on my stomach than regular whey protein powder. It also contains much less artificial sweeteners. 

I add collagen because it helps with skin hydration which I struggle with, and it aids with hair and nail strengthening."
Smoothies,feh5ltu,t1_feh5830,1579109623.0,"Thanks so much :D it is powdered. I prefer powdered bc I donâ€™t particularly enjoy eating spinach, and the powdered form lasts forever. I love it!"
Smoothies,feh4tgu,t1_feh43rq,1579109158.0,"Thank you! My old roommate gave me this collagen so Iâ€™m not sure where itâ€™s from, but the collagen I had before I purchased at the local grocery store. 

Collagen is a complex structural protein that maintains strength and flexibility throughout the body. As a dietary supplement it helps to increase skin hydration as well as strengthening of skin, hair, and nails ðŸ˜Š"
cats,fegvxld,t1_fegvobx,1579103735.0,"How cute! My kitty is a ragdoll/ maine coon mix as well. Best decision I ever made was getting him, best companion ðŸ˜Š"
cats,fegviqz,t3_ep2y71,1579103473.0,Is she a Maine Coon? Iâ€™m asking because of the hair tufts in her ears. I have a Maine Coon mix and he is the sweetest!
