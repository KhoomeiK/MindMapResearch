BabyBumps,ffanmue,t1_ffakmjp,1579740189.0,"Yeah I don‚Äôt disagree with you. However not all women are confident in their body, and when changes are happening to it, like growing bigger and getting stretch marks and all that, it can be hard for someone who is already not happy with their body to feel confident in a pregnant body. 

I guess what these women really want is for people to respect their desire to not be singled out as being huge just because their pregnant. Like hello Sherlock Holmes of course I am bigger I am carrying a human being in here. 

I don‚Äôt know what the answer is, humans are complex creatures and as always, one way for some women isn‚Äôt going to be the same for others. 

I appreciated your body confidence in pregnancy and I hope to have the same confidence about my own body changing when it‚Äôs my turn, but I guess I won‚Äôt know how I will feel until it happens to me."

aww,feq1mi3,t1_fepqmsz,1579336158.0,"> Pit bulls were responsible for the highest percentage of reported bites across all the studies (22.5%), followed by mixed breeds (21.2%), and German shepherds (17.8%).
Mixed-breed dogs and pit bulls were found to have the highest relative risk of biting, as well as the highest average damage per bite. Breeds such as Great Dane and Akita were found to have a lower relative risk of biting; however, the average damage from these bites was high.

You literally can‚Äôt argue with facts man. Stop pushing dangerous breeds on people - not everyone should own one because they require specific skill in training and owning them. The more you popularise them the more novice dog owners get them and then you get problems. Just stop it! I am so sick to death of the fatal dog attacks in my town being from pit or bully breed dog owners because they‚Äôre too fecking stupid to know how to care for them. Enough is enough. 

‚ÄúOh we were told pits are lovely dogs, he was so nice to our baby, and he cuddled our cat I have no idea why he disemboweled our neighbours cat!!!‚Äù - Literally a pit bull owner at the local dog park shared this story whilst her dog was chained with a muzzle... like fuck off and get the fuck out of our friendly dog park.

There are many people out there who definitely make being a parent sound like the worlds worst job, but to be honest, I think it really comes down to who your spouse is, what support you have behind you whether that‚Äôs family, friends or finances (and what your own attitude is like).

One thing that really put me off the idea of a baby is women who complain incessantly about how horrible newborns are.
