Anyway, one day when he was getting his prescription he was informed that he now qualified for a new program  that would take some of the cost off of him. Obviously he asked how much it would be with the additional discount; I don't remember the exact number, but it was DRASTICALLY cheaper than it had been for him for years. I'll never forget what he said happened at the counter that day. 

""I wept, Ragormack. I am a 52 year old man and I wept in front of my pharmacist while asking 'is this a joke?!'. Ragormack, paying for insulin has been 30% of my income for a very very long time, and it dropped to less than 5%. I need this shit to live. They literally made me pay less to live and I was so grateful that I just wept"".
