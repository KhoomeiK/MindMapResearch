OldSchoolCool,fey8jul,t3_eqv6qx,1579442111.0,"Wow..so I just went through a Wikipedia rabbit hole and the statue of liberty is literally 48th on the list of largest statues. Huh. I would have guessed at least top 5.

And the tallest one in the world was completed less than 2 years ago!"

funny,fefcinw,t3_eos4u6,1579053344.0,I want to know what this guy's life was like. What did he do to keep with it for so long? Did he exercise all the time?

Showerthoughts,fe0g7mu,t1_fdzxac3,1578812911.0,You.dont want your surgeon googling how to perform the surgery (if it was boilerplate) but maybe you might want him or her to do some research on how your specific condition or medication reacts to certain procedures. There are too many variables to know everything.
Showerthoughts,fe0ftz3,t1_fe06uc1,1578812718.0,"Why reinvent the wheel?

It's like a physical product developer not wanting to use parts manufactured by specialty manufacturers. Do I really need to learn how to make a fucking tire from scratch if you want me to build you a bicycle?"
Showerthoughts,fe0fhq9,t1_fe01zz6,1578812531.0,"One difference (for me anyway) between textbooks and googling is that the act of googling is targeted searching that applies to current needs and you learn much quicker when applying something you are looking for than trying to read through a text book and absorb all of the information even if it's not relevant to the current situation to be applied at a later date.

Also, I still find it fascinating that no one ever uses the word ""searches"" or ""searching"" anymore."
Showerthoughts,fe0ezce,t1_fe06g4j,1578812239.0,I bring a notepad too for taking notes. Especially names. If you get introduced to someone you weren't expecting- you better remember their name and what they do.
Showerthoughts,fe0ejvu,t1_fdzgtap,1578811930.0,Damn. That's a speedy performance review. We won't even begin ours for at least a few months into 2020. Pay is retroactive though. Hope you got a nice raise!
todayilearned,fe0bt7x,t1_fe08dp7,1578809045.0,"I knew a guy who put a Mensa logo in his work email signature block so everyone knew he was in Mensa.

My guess is because if you just knew him or interacted with him, you would never pick that up on your own."

science,fe093lp,t1_fe073dz,1578806489.0,"On the flip side, some video games allow children to have healthy social circles that they would otherwise not have access to.

Source: Grew up in a rough neighborhood where quality friends were scarce. Video games allowed me to meet people online and befriend people who weren't selling drugs or commiting other crimes. Although this is before the internet bully/troll era."

dataisbeautiful,fcpg8fc,t1_fcpf7b1,1577862621.0,"I could understand that. However you can open up a Roth IRA if you don't have one already and put your cash savings in there up to 6 grand. You can still withdraw the principa (money you put in, not interest)l if you need it and you'll put the money to work for you. You can have a 401k and a Roth IRA if you make less than 124k a year."
dataisbeautiful,fcpd3rh,t1_fcp5sxn,1577858924.0,"If you don't mind me asking. Why so much cash savings and not pumping more into your 401k?

Im 35 and I would tell 20 year old me that compound interest is the greatest gift you can give yourself."

GetMotivated,fc2rjld,t1_fc2qs9h,1577371937.0,I agree with the message. I guess I wanted to just hope for the best that her family is still learning than the alternative that is implied here. For her sake.
GetMotivated,fc2m8g9,t1_fc2im9o,1577366824.0,Maybe she just recently went deaf and they haven't learned yet. She has really good speech so that's my guess. Hopefully.
