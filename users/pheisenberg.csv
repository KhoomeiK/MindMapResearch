history,ffe3gt2,t3_espjgo,1579835710.0,"For much of that period, I don’t think anyone really knows. For example, from *Viking Warrior vs Anglo-Saxon Warrior: England 865–1066*:

> Because there are so few detailed accounts of battles from this period, we know little of either Anglo-Saxon or Viking battle tactics

Weapons varied a lot. Most common was probably shield and spear, with a sword for backup, and as much armor as they could afford. But there were also halberds, bills, axes, two-handed swords, warhammers. Armor would be pretty good protection against a lot of that, so I think if you were actively defending yourself, it would be hard for someone to get a solid enough hit to really hurt you through the armor. At the same time, a stab through a gap could be instant death.

Casualties were low, like 10% (other than during a rout), so I highly doubt everyone immediately ran into a giant chaotic scrum or two giant pike blocks smashed together. I gather that historians still debate whether ancient phalanges literally bodily pushed each other, or stood a bit apart poking at each other.

*Violence: A Micro-sociological Theory* has some interesting analysis based on modern videos and telephoto pictures. A couple of the top points are, lies and exaggeration are the norm when participants tell the story, and, most deadly violence takes the form of 3 or more attackers ganging up on an isolated victim. Otherwise everyone is too scared and either doesn’t attack at all, makes weak attacks from safety, or swings wildly and ineffectively. (YouTube has examples.)

Based on this and some other stuff I read, I would guess as two roughly equal units or mobs approached, they would first yell and stomp to intimidate, so the others run away or at least lose heart. Most would focus on not getting stabbed while taking enough risks not to look like a coward (if amateurs) or making attacks taking a reasonable risk (the pros). A few “hard men” or psychos might attack more aggressively, sometimes smashing an enemy with pure aggression, but more likely to slip up and get caught, unless they’re really skilled, too.

Most attacks would miss, but a few would hit. Sometimes someone would trip or get separated from their group and be brutally killed. Wounded or exhausted fighters would drop out of line. If too many fell out too quickly in one spot, experienced fighters might pounce and slaughter the now psychologically stunned and isolated men. Emotions would flow back and forth — a quick kill might send a ripple of excitement in one side, anxiety through the other. Men in the back wouldn’t see anything and would go just by the shouts and the emotions.

If it goes evenly, both sides might lose a few men, get tired, attack less, and eventually the fight peters out and they cautiously back off. Otherwise, eventually from fatigue, fear, and/or rational calculation that the other side will win, a few will run off from the back. More and more will panic or realize they’ll soon be all alone and run off. The other side, excited to win and instinctively wanting to kill an enemy with back turned, runs after them and stabs or chops as many in the back as they can, or more likely starts looting bodies. Disciplined soldiers could stop and reset their formation while the cavalry rides the runners down. Because the morale/panic dynamic was so important, simply having more solidarity than the other side (through living, eating, drinking, training together, drill, past “glorious” victories) could be a huge advantage."

Another way to put it is, conventional army destroy any lesser enemy, but only if they can find them, and guerrillas are hard to find. Guerrillas can’t destroy an army, but they can raise the price of occupation. So then it depends on how high a price the conventional power is willing to pay.

That’s the big difference with your examples. The US is willing to pay only a low price to occupy Iraq. But the hypothetical US tyrant in control of the military would pay any price to stay in power. I”m just not aware of much of any examples of a civilian population overthrowing their own government, at home, without outside help. Very different case from foreign occupation.

The problem seems very general: people tend to shun convicts as employees, friends, etc., as well.

history,ff8y22n,t3_erzom4,1579699760.0,"My understanding is that territorial control came into being with the nation-state. Ancient rulers didn’t control much outside the capital; “governments” were mostly military and the administrative parts were puny. I don’t think they had accurate land maps, either. It’s pretty hard to control people when they live a thousand miles away, speak a different language, and have no idea who you are, but you could get their local chief to swear allegiance and pay taxes. I don’t think they had accurate land maps, either. So the concept doesn’t really apply, although ancient empires made some attempts to delineate borders, like Hadrian’s wall.

Once you have a nation-state, you have most people in a territory saying “I am French” rather than “I am Norman, “I am Burgundian” and so on, and recognizing France as their government rather than their local lord. “The law of the land” can actually be a thing.

Culturally things were patchy, too, as they are now. I’ve seen a map of settlements in England labeled as post-Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Danish. They’re not in clear territorial blocks, they’re intermixed all over the place with higher concentrations in the matching “colored map areas”."

You’ve named a massive topic, so I’ll just mention some stuff that comes to mind that’s hopefully helpful. Although past ages didn’t have the liberal idea of rights, there were norms for rulers and complaints if broken. In ancient Greece, I believe both Sparta and the Thirty Tyrants were considered oppressive by most people. In Ancient Greece and Rome conditions varied a lot for slaves. You could be a doctor living well and saving up to buy your freedom, worked to death in silver mines, or anything in between. Race slavery and even race per se is mainly in modern times as far as I know, formed as a result of international conquests I suppose. I think premodern slavery was usually via conquest or birth, sometimes selling yourself or your child into slavery out of desperation. One people conquering another, or many preying on one, could create a definite ethnic association. Apparently the word “slave” comes from “Slav” because many Slavs were sold as slaves."

I notice that “shared reality” has broken down only on political topics, and not all of them. Many Republicans now believe in global warming. People aren’t confused about the color of the sky or over whether their bank account exists. I tend to think it goes both ways: diverse information sources allow more divergence in ideology and “shared reality”, while political divergence leads people to seek out alternate information sources. 

There seems to be a pattern where media types think media is more politically influential than it is. 2016 was an example, where the media said “Trump bad” a lot and then he won. But they’ve been able to attribute that to Russian propaganda — media still controls the outcome, but now it’s a bad counter-media.

I also find myself asking, where is “shared reality” breaking down in a way that matters? Different religions mean different realities, but for the most part this has no political import. On the other hand, different beliefs about the meaning and effects of immigration are a big deal. Fact-checkers can’t tell you the answer, and since it’s a political question, it’s hard for anyone (including journalists and scientists) to prove they’re giving you unbiased information.

I found *Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in a Modern Battle*, by Stephen Biddle, very informative on this topic. The operational level is perhaps even more important, but on the tactical level on the attack, the main problem is that machine guns and explosive shells can make it impossible to cross an area of ground alive. The solution is to advance small assault teams using cover (including dips and folds in the ground), concealment, and suppressive fires from supporting machine guns, artillery, and their own weapons. Barrages are kept short to avoid wasting ammunition and providing defenders advance notice. These tactics were known at the beginning of the war, especially from brushfire wars, but WWI armies at first more commonly used long preparatory bombardments (days even, I think), then made mass advances behind a rolling barrage.

According to Biddle, attackers take moderate casualties when using modern tactics but very high casualties with traditional tactics. So casualties to complete any given tactical order of the form “capture map area Z” probably were much higher at the beginning of the war. But maybe armies attacked faster once they got the new tactics, so effect on overall casualty rate is hard to predict.

I think the huge casualties of WWI overall were mostly due to the scale supported by modern industry: armies could deliver more men and ammunition to the front per unit time than ever before. By WWII, armies had the new tactics down pretty well, but suffered a similar overall level of casualties, as the morale-limits-casualties idea suggests."

Good point about subsidized or not. If the amount about doubled in ten years then it was high interest, I’d guess around 7%. Maybe he had a $1000 monthly bill at the beginning, who knows at the end. $12K per year debt service on minimum wage is infeasible in most areas, so I guess it passes the plausibility test.

I still wonder what he was doing during that time and how much he was being paid. Regardless, his story piques my interest in reforms. Going to law school then discovering you hate being a lawyer seems like it should be an insurable event."

history,fe92g5d,t3_emtt6s,1578933427.0,"According to Phillips O’Brien in *How the War was Won*, neither operation was all that critical: air-sea power was the most important. He estimates that Stalingrad cost Germany about 2 weeks worth of weapons production. Germany didn’t start losing soldiers and tanks faster than they could field replacements until 1944, when the Luftwaffe had been beaten down and strategic/interdiction bombing had ramped up.

Arguably, then, D-day was the more militarily important operation. The western fronts were a much more advanced, expensive form of warfare than the eastern. Germany always deployed more planes (the most effective and important weapon) against the western Allies — so victory there matters more. Also, had D-day failed, it would have been months until they could try again. By contrast, Stalingrad itself wasn’t that strategically important anyway. One question is whether a loss at Stalingrad would have crippled Soviet morale, but I think not, given how much they had suffered already."

history,fe8t6of,t3_en1vq8,1578930549.0,"*The Face of Battle* has a chapter on Agincourt. Keegan describes the longbowmen as having three effects. At first, they caused a few casualties and some intimidation from direct shots. Then once the French attacked, they avoided the longbows and went after the English men-at-arms only, in three narrow columns, overcrowding them. Keegan doesn’t know why; maybe fear of bodkin points at close range, maybe too honor-obsessed to fight commoners. Finally, the longbowmen left their positions to counterattack French knights. Keegan thinks groups of three or four archers would target an isolated knight struggling in the mud, knock him down with a mallet or bill, then finish him off with a blade through a gap in the armor.

Based on that, whether the longbowmen were crucial to victory is hard to say. Maybe the terrain itself was enough to make the attack hard. On the other hand, maybe the longbows forced the French into too-tight columns, providing the necessary edge."

This could be somewhat similar to how today, the US gives free money and weapons to much weaker, not-very-nice regimes in the hopes they’ll contain other problems. Or cops paying certain criminals as informants. Rulers had no hope of pulling a Decatur and stopping the raids at their source, so they had to cope.

My understanding is that the big shift in tactics started later, with the magazine rifle. The Springfield Model 1961 was a muzzle-loader that could put out the same three rounds a minute as Napoleonic muskets. The 1895 Lee-Enfield could put out 20 rounds a minute.

But capitalism makes us rich and comfortable while democracy by itself does not, and there’s plenty of domination in all known democracies, so the reality is pretty muddy.

For a long time I’ve thought that for all its faults, democracy is the best system because only it binds governors to serve the people. But recent events and polarized perspectives like this one are making me question that. Supporters of electoral democracy need to address the Iron Law of Oligarchy and the non-performance/non-accountability of voters.

As public speech became more free and equal this became impossible. 

The big surprise for me isn’t what’s happening today, it’s that government and media have suffered 50 years of decaying trust and haven’t been able to do a thing about it.

(I mean war as a tool to conquer states and remake geopolitics — we still have smaller wars, of course.) Nation-states still do useful things but I don’t know if it’s the right form for the future.

This author says the founders didn’t think in national terms and that the American nation formed 1860-1950. I don’t fully buy that — people do seem to have identified as Americans before 1776 — but politically, the US did evolve to be much less of a federation of states and much more a nation-state. Notably, the US had little to fear from major war before 1860. The Cold War kept up the pressure until 1990, but no increase in state power was needed to prevent the USSR from taking over — in fact, state power was curtailed after Vietnam.

I think nations form either because a powerful state forces it (force all children to learn the target national language in school, etc.) or because people are drawn in by the benefits (assimilate to US or Indo-European culture to better take part in their wealth). US has never had that kind of power over white people, so draw in is the only way. MAGA-type Americans can’t draw in anyone and they know it, they must vaguely hope that it’s possible to ethnically cleanse the US. 

Our recent conflict has been between “traditional” (big trucks, Apple pie) and “multicultural” (hip hop, anime) notions of the nation. The traditional form has some advantages, but the multicultural has been generating far more economic and cultural power. History since 4000 BC seems to be a long sequence where the world has gotten more integrated, so in the long term the nation-state is probably doomed. There are a lot of ups and downs in the shorter term, but I don’t see many reasons to expect this particular dynamic to flip."

To me, the really interesting disconnection is that politics turned to shit but this seems not to have hurt the economy. Perhaps politicians and journalists are not as important as they pretend, in the short term at least.

US corporate tax was way higher than most others and it caused problems like the massive incentive to keep profit overseas. Corporate tax rates have been declining worldwide — I think high corporate tax rates turned out to be a bad idea.

On the other hand, cutting taxes on rich households didn’t make sense to me, but I’m not sure what the impact really was.

Now that we have better jobs for women, social services, and day care for hire, those are the seat belts and the shotgun wedding became an entirely optional kind of road rash.
