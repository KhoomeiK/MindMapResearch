Your cost for clothes, utilities, food, transportation, books, dental care, etc change the comparison. You are spending more than $0 to attend any college no matter the scholarship and tuition comparison. A larger university may, note may, lead to relationships that open doors during your career and perhaps more job offers at a higher initial salary upon graduation. If you ever pursue a graduate degree the larger university may be viewed as more desirable. Quality of the classroom experience and labs may differ. Quality of non-classroom social experiences may vary. I like competition and quality instruction so was drawn to larger, higher-ranked options for education. Get a respected technical degree and the debt should be easy to pay off over first decade of graduation. If not getting a technical degree then college may be an anchor of long-lasting debt. Chose wisely."

funny,ff5h1zp,t1_ff5g4fj,1579592532.0,Owners can move teams if owners of the other teams and the league office agree to the proposed move. Why agree? Teams share certain revenues so if a larger city needs a team then moving there can benefit all owners if more television viewers tune in or the extra people drive up prices for game tickets. If a different city offers to subsidize a team’s stadium then that also benefits all other owners since puts pressure on their current city to subsidize stadiums. A significant amount of team owner revenues are from television airings so any temporary loss of ticket sales and local sponsorship revenues in last year or two before move is not a major disincentive to move.
AskReddit,ff5dgl9,t3_ero8mj,1579588293.0,"Amazed. Freaking amazed I have done many of the things I read about as a kid visiting the small library in my rural town. The things I have seen, achieved and lives positively impacted. I am the only member of my extended family to move from the region where was born. I have been atop mountains, under the ocean in a submarine and landed on a glacier. Shook the hands of Senators and Presidents and titans of industry. Yet, I had no significant impact on any of them.

My family was not wealthy but I had a big jump start on becoming successful. I have hustled and grinded the past several decades but know I had that jump start in life of two parents at home and plenty to eat from the garden and health. My rural school system was not academically good but gave me the confidence to go get a college degree then a graduate degree at a top 5 program.

I have held the hand of family as they took last breaths. Watched my children born and take first breaths. Was given last rites when was sepsis and struggled back to later walk out of that ICU. Am at peace with the circle of life.

I know that young, skinny, rural hick with the crew cut would be amazed by the adventures and experiences of  “old” me and might even say OK Boomer!!"

The parent does not need to have been trained as a teacher nor adept at the subject matter. Some children thrive within a home-school system. Others do not. Social interactions of a home-schooled student can be limited to family and church members which can be limiting to developing social skills but can be beneficial if a child might be the target of bullying at school. Home studies can be enriching through a more intensive approach as can be tailored to each child’s interests, needs and abilities. Perhaps a child may need additional instruction on a subject that might not be possible in a school system. Perhaps a child learns better with more frequent feedback than a school can provide when 30 kids in a classroom. Some schools allow nearby home-schooled kids to join school sports teams or take some classes such as art."

worldpolitics,feijopl,t1_fei7d6p,1579140092.0,"Is not normal for a law firm’s lawyer to be placed on the board of directors of a foreign company. This is a huge company. Would be like Google putting a lawyer on the board because the lawyer, paid by the law firm, did a good job for them on some cases and acquisitions. Nope, you pay them then a lawyer through the firm

What does makes sense is to attempt to hire the inept offspring of a senior leader of a powerful nation. Or a spouse. To get influence over the parent or spouse.

Anyone recall when Wal-Mart put a lawyer on its Board who was a junior lawyer at a firm they paid for services? Hint: she was the state governor’s spouse. Briefly traded cattle futures. Land development investor. Not very experienced about matters critical to success of that big company. Now, as with Biden, perhaps Wal-Mart intuitively hoped she was a bona fide rising superstar with potential so just had to be on the board. Really? Biden fits that description?
