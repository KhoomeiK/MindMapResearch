They need to make own characters/stories and quit trying to appropriate other IPs to entice audiences. The people demanding this are wanting to co-opt other people's work instead of coming up with anything on their own because they think there is little to no demand for it in the market. 

Also, you already have a badass female secret agent, Black Widow. If you don't like it, make something else. But tagging on ""James Bond"" is nothing but them trying to siphon off an audience from the James Bond IP. 

There's a reason Producers are saying ""Go woke, go broke."" Or did I miss the outstanding success of the Ghostbusters and Charlies Angels reboots?

It didn't really take off until American Antifa and the Tumblr Refugees on Twitter started getting offended by it. Because of how those groups reacted the Alt-Right fully embraced it to irritate them. 

When you choose to be offended by something, you're giving it power. Enough people give it that attention/power and it becomes a symbol.
