If they re-sign Bogdan they're then gonna be in a tough cap situation and potentially looking at luxury tax when Fox's deal comes through.

All signs point to them just letting Bogdan walk, especially since his name has been floated in trade talks all season.

>	De tanker, der i anklagen kommer frem om de taktiske principper i søkrig, må desværre siges at have været fremherskende blandt de mænd, der under “Den store nordiske krig” (1709-20) forestod den øverste krigsledelse af Danmark-Norge. Dette, at man kun angreb en modstander, hvis man var ham langt overlegen i såvel kanoner som mandskab og i øvrigt ikke risikerede noget. Peter Wessel, der efter datidens sædvane i slige sager ikke havde nogen juridisk skolet forsvarer, kunne dog replicere på tiltalen med fynd og klem. Han siger bl.a. i sin replik, at det undrer ham en del, at der harceleres over de skader, som LØVENDALS GALLEY har fået under kampen, “thi man ved at Canonen er det Instrument, som temmelig lader se sin Effect, hvor den træffer.” Som forsvar mod fiscalens vagt formulerede anklage kunne han fremføre en paragraf fra søkrigsartiklerne, der faktisk knæsatte hans konduite. Denne sagde klart, at han havde været hjemfalden til straf, hvis han havde undladt at angribe den flygtende fregat, blot fordi den var større end hans egen."
todayilearned,ff97fgt,t1_ff92wkz,1579706598.0,"I really didn't understand this, even what it meant, so I dug deeper into it. I checked out the source cited for that in wiki and while it is in Danish I used google translate so could be lost in translation. Nonetheless, the source doesn't mention anything about fleeing ships. It only says he would've been punished for simply not attacking a ship because it was bigger.

So I'm not sure that it actually has to do with fleeing or not but seems like it's more of a ""don't display cowardice"" kind of rule.

edit: now I'm thinking it was just lost in translation because I think one of the charges was putting his ship in danger by attacking a large ship. Then I imagine it's because when a ship is fleeing they're in a vulnerable position. So you're presented with the opportunity to take out a large ship and passing it up. 

Although I don't think they attacked first so maybe that changes it again because itd then be backing down from a fight idk this has my brain in a pretzel lol"

He was unhappy I sold his friend (who asked to be transfer listed) and I figured he'd be unhappy for a little then come around. He continued to throw a shit fit and skipped training after partying the night before. I fined him since his behavior has been less than professional already and that made him more upset. 

Now we're in an infinite loop of that. He's unhappy, will miss training, I'll fine him, he'll get unhappy about that and then miss training again, etc. He's missed training about 5 times now. I've sent him to the U18's and transfer listed him. Got no bites in the January window despite offering him for well below his asking price.
