I went to the dentist with my mum as a young child and we were told to go to hospital. It was only minor toothache.
Later on, after we got stuff checked out, a few weeks later I got some of my teeth taken out. I wasn‚Äôt sure why until a while ago when my mother told me that (I think this is right) I had an infection that was slowly going up to my eye, and I‚Äôm not sure what would have happened if I hadn‚Äôt got it checked out. 
I might edit this if I can find out what accurately happened."
