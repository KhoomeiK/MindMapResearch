MakeupAdvice,fbwo1h2,t3_eet86n,1577154935.0,"What is your skin type: Oily/dry/combo? And are you looking for drug store or something more expensive?
For application, I personally use as little as I can get away with. I like a nice coverage, but I still want it to look like my skin, but better. I save areas that need more attention for my concealer (under the eyes, blemishes) and then blend blend blend. A clean brush makes all the difference or a wet makeup sponge. Play around with it and see which one works better for you."
