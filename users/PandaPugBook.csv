Or perhaps some of his miracles, if you haven't read the bible. I'll just get the more well-known stories out of the way, such as how he turned butter to Vegemite, or when he fed a crowd of hundreds with a basket of meat pies, or when he healed a koala of its chlamydia. He also starred in Playschool that one time. 
You would think with the ability to duplicate meat pies, he wouldn't need to borrow 5 bucks to buy one. You would AT LEAST think he would be able to pay me back! But NO! Instead he gave stupid excuses like ""Mates don't leave mates to die on crosses"" and ""That really hurt, y'know""."
