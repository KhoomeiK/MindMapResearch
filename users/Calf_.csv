I wasn't having much luck winning Shadowfall games, and I really wanted to get all the event challenges and rewards, so I decided to try a new tactic - instead of fighting my way to victory, I decided to try and *hide* my way to victory. First game I entered the circle was closing on the western side of the map so I landed at Airbase. I very quickly grabbed whatever weapons, ammo, and armor was in my immediate landing area, and I then went and hid inside the dropship on the raised platform on the south end of the airbase. I watched the map, and I couldn't believe my luck when the second *and* third circle closed in with my hiding spot still inside the ring. Then I won the metaphorical lottery - 10 legends remained and the dropship was inbound and it was landing no more than *10 feet* from my hiding spot! Somehow the dozens of shadows running around my hiding spot never saw me, and after a nerve-racking 2 minutes of waiting the dropship arrived and I within mere seconds I was onboard.
