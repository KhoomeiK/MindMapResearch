ABraThatFits,ffb8m4q,t1_ff5fhsf,1579755139.0,"Also the South East region of the USA. I grew up in Kentucky, and I heard it all the time"

IllegallySmolCats,ff54t7e,t1_ff511mq,1579580251.0,He barely had his eyes open when he was brought to us. Fortunately both my mom and I have experience in bottle feeding kittens
aww,ff4n0u0,t1_ff3y926,1579567570.0,Agreed. My sister as a small child would eat frozen peas or corn out of the bag if my parents would let her. She also ate 6 clementines in one sitting.
IllegallySmolCats,ff4ivty,t3_erk4io,1579564684.0,"In case you all want to know, Vincent is now a brawny boi.  He's 16 lbs but he's not that overweight; he's just BIG.  He opens doors with horizontal handles, but he still wants to be snuggled like a baby and sleeps with his favorite blankie."
IllegallySmolCats,ff46bhk,t3_ercui6,1579556494.0,"Those are her pants now, dude. You're not getting those back until she's done camping. ðŸ˜†"
aww,ff44xvj,t1_ff3wl0n,1579555631.0,"I can't stand the bell! I take it off my cat's collars. If it bugs me that badly, I can only imagine what it's like for them."
seals,ff44psa,t3_erb5p9,1579555487.0,whee!!
cats,fdxpia7,t1_fdtb9dr,1578771558.0,"While neither my husband or myself married the other for their cat, we both love them and knew we would be bringing them into it relationship. My husband had to be clowder approved (my parents had 6 cats at the time), and when our dating got serious, I had to be Lyra approved."
ABraThatFits,fd00r04,t1_fczph98,1578111900.0,"They certainly didn't have any when I looked a year ago. I didn't look in PINK, though; I was looking for something a more sexy than what you typically find in PINK"
ABraThatFits,fczozyb,t1_fcynnon,1578106018.0,Wait! they now have 30s at VS?! Since when?
cats,fc20p51,t1_fc1lr32,1577335892.0,And look elegant doing it!
mypartneristrans,fc12ttf,t1_fc11nmb,1577306653.0,"THIS! My husband came out as trans a couple of months ago, and after I got done crying, we discussed what this means for our relationship. It turns out that not much is changing in our relationship itself--he's always been a bit on the effeminate side--and he isn't planning to transition physically. I'm having to get used to him buying women's clothes, painting his nails, etc."
bjj,fc11raq,t1_fc0vj9t,1577305781.0,"In most cases, it's for extra support without significant mobility loss. I had to tape my right foot for a while because I was using poor mechanics when driving off it for takedown, and I'm currently nursing a finger injury that would probably be fine if I could just let it rest, but I would have to be off work (not just training) if I immobilized it completely."
aww,fc10yix,t1_fbzkd95,1577305129.0,"Ah, that's why she looks so happy in the picture."
mypartneristrans,fc10bbe,t1_fc0l428,1577304607.0,"I just figured ""they"" was being used to broaden the post's advice beyond this particular situation."
Cinderblock,fbmfx44,t1_fbm9zc5,1576983159.0,It's probably a recycled paper litter. My husband used a paper cat litter for his tortoise to burrow in. It's fairly inexpensive and doesn't shed dust like many clay litters.
