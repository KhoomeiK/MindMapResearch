Stellaris,ffdzdyx,t1_ffdy9i4,1579832729.0,"Something like that. An empire’s economic strength regarding _material goods_.

In the same way, the Food (green apples) you have isn’t a representation of food stamps or food allowances (as you interpreted) or the food your government’s been hoarding (as you thought i interpreted), but rather an abstraction of all the food the empire has, regardless of whether it’s in the government’s warehouse, a food company’s processing centres, a supermarket, or a household’s kitchen.

Does that make better sense?"
Stellaris,ffdt2lw,t1_ffdrvpm,1579828225.0,"I’ll try one more time out of our shared love for Stellaris:

Grants, handouts, subsidies are all a small part of the economy, in our world, the economic system is also determined by things like fiscal and monetary policies, taxation systems, labour laws, and a tonne of other regulations and stuff.

I understand you think the government doesn’t literally provide the lab equipments to the scientists and the clothes/airpods to the citizens, rather they give them grants and handouts. But that’s exactly my point: the government is using grants/subsidies/other economic stuff to ensure those people can afford whatever airpods/equipment they need.

In other words, the Consumer Goods are not a representation of what the government has in their warehouses, it doesn’t even represent their grant budgets. Instead, the Consumer Goods you have are a representation of all the material goods available for future use in your empire, regardless of whether it’s in your storage or some corporation’s warehouse."

Stellaris,ffdheqz,t1_ffc8g85,1579820918.0,"I’d argue the government doesn’t directly control the consumer goods or food or minerals.

Do you think when farmers farm, they immediately give up all the food to the government in exchange for a small income? And this is somehow a constant in ALL empires? Of course not! The government doesn’t take and distribute food individually, they simply change policies/taxes/subsidies to ensure everyone is able to afford food.

If you’re right, are grants manufactured in factories? Are material goods like an airpod produced by a park or a hospital or a holo theatre?

You can say the CG upkeep for pop seems like it implies CG are just grants, but that’s not really true. In Stellaris we don’t really have the concept of “salary”,  we don’t really have a way to show how the pops are getting paid or what the economic structure or their society is. Instead, we got a simplification that they are getting paid a certain amount, and with this salary they are able to consume a certain amount of CG.

They represent the resources your empire allots towards citizen benefits like social welfare, public services (libraries, transportation, parks), and so on. They aren't necessarily material things like airpods and toasters, those would fall under amenities or trade value.

I think you mixed up amenities and consumer goods. Non-material stuff that improve citizens’ daily lives, like healthcare and entertainment and the service industry counts as amenities, while material things they use like airpods or medicine or lab equipment would be consumer goods made by artisans."

DebateReligion,feurnuu,t1_feuedav,1579389316.0,"> That's not true. Germ theory existed hundreds of years before we had scientific evidence to prove it. If we had acted on the assumption that it was microbes that were making us sick we could have invented ways to defeat it even if we didn't have proof. Just like tribal societies developed medicines for illnesses without knowing exactly why they were happening.

And without any evidence, why exactly should we act as though your germ theory is real? Why not act according to the miasmas theory, or theories that diseases are caused by spirits or deities?

> All of which have been found to be unconstitutional by other Christians who recognize that these are examples of people imposing their religious will on others.

“No true Christian”.

> I could say the same thing about atheists who would like to impose their beliefs on others. Christians just happen to be in the majority and some of them want to impose their will on others in harmful ways.

If you mean atheists try to impose their beliefs by allowing gays to have the same rights as others, then yeah I guess you could say both sides are trying to impose their beliefs: one side trying to promote equal rights and well-beings of others, while the other side trying to suppress them.

> I would argue that positions against gay marriage an abortion and euthanisa don't come from religion. Just the opposite. These oppositions come from biological and societal aversions to these practices which religions then adopt as part of their moral codes. Gay marriage would have been harmful to preindustralized societies where marriage was a vital binding aspect of societal structure and reproductive strategy to form stable societies. Homosexuality and homosexual marriages threatened this structure. Abortion violates this survival strategy as well as we came to value human life above all else in order to assure human rights which serves to assure successful reprouction strategies.

Right, just like how Moses explicitly told his people to stone gays? Because gays threatened their social structure, not because god himself commanded it as written in the bible?

And how come a much higher percentage of christians oppose stuff like gay marriage than atheists? Do atheists not care about stable structures?"

DebateReligion,feu5l88,t1_fett7sz,1579383350.0,"> For example if we have no evidence germ theory is true but we act as though it were we could have invented antibiotics hundreds of years before we did saving millions of lives. On the other hand people acted as if they knew that sickness was caused by humours and miasmas and curses rather than acknowledging they could have been wrong which lead to the incorrect treatment and lack of discovering the truth for thousands of years.

If we have zero evidence to support germ theory instead of miasmas, we wouldn’t be able to invent antibiotics in the first place. In the same way you can’t invent a cure for cancer by “acting as though we understand how to make a cure”.

> I guess it comes down to “what do we have to lose by believing we know who god is and what he wants”. Besides eternal hell if we pick the wrong religion it seems we don’t have much to lose by knowing a religion is true. Religions give us hope and meaning and guiding moral principles. Let’s assume all religions are false and we’re all going to die and cease to exist. Does not the knowledge of eternal life even if it’s wrong add so much to the human experience to make it beneficial enough to maintain it? And as long as we don’t force or coerce our knowledge onto others it seems we gain more than the harm it causes by being utterly confident in something that may be entirely wrong.

Not really. Christianity influence the society not just by “adding human experience”, but also by influencing its laws and beliefs. A large percentage of Christians are sternly opposed to gay marriage, believing gays should not be allowed to marry. The same Christians often oppose abortion or euthanasia, both of which greatly reduce human sufferings. These are just a small fraction of what we lose by believing your religion, regardless of whether it’s correct."
DebateReligion,feu3pl2,t1_fet8j37,1579382819.0,"Adding on this, we must also consider anecdotal evidence that are _completely contrary to each other_.

If a friend tells me they saw A in a party, while someone else tells me they saw A at work during that same time, then unless there are two As, one of my friends must not be telling the truth. Sure they might be sincere and honest, but that would be one of them they is mistaken rather than lying. They might have seen the wrong person, or remembered the wrong time etc.

If someone tells me they saw Jesus in a dream, and someone else tells me they felt Allah when they were praying, then assuming they were both being sincere and honest, and Jesus doesn’t coexist with Allah, the only possible solution would be one of them is mistaken."
