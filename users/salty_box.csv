relationships,ff1x4x9,t3_er5va5,1579488190.0,"You can trust your boyfriend but still feel uncomfortable with him going. Even if they are friends, being friends with an ex is a tricky dynamic. All relationships are different, but many people would feel that it's not appropriate for a boyfriend to go away for the weekend with his ex and without his girlfriend. When you talk to him, you can just say that plainly: ""Boyfriend, I know that you and Ex are friends, but I am not comfortable with you going away with her without me."""
relationships,ff1wk0y,t3_er3rpp,1579487806.0,"Learning how to properly take care of household chores is an important part of becoming an adult. It sounds like your boyfriend isn't quite there yet. It's not your job to make him grow up, but if this relationship is important to you and you want to make it work, consider talking to him about what kinds of chores you want to be done in the house. You're not asking him to ""help"" you do things, you're telling him that you want to be working together to keep the house clean. 

Be specific: ""Boyfriend, it's important to me that we keep our home clean and tidy. I would like us to [wash the dishes every night, fold and put away the laundry, vacuum once a week, etc]."" Together you can come up with a list of chores, who does them, and when they get done. For example, each of you puts the dirty clothes in the hamper, and once a week someone does the laundry. Or maybe each of you puts dishes in the dishwasher after you use them, but you clean the kitchen after dinner together. 

You don't have to give him an ultimatum, but you should think about how important this is to you, and what you might do if he doesn't get on board."
relationships,ff1v8pf,t3_er4zhb,1579486936.0,"Leave her alone. An apology may help you feel better but it will have no benefit to her, and in fact could be upsetting for her. If she has made no effort to contact you since you broke up, it's clear she doesn't want to talk to you. Respect that and do not reach out to her.

Thinking about an apology might be a helpful process for you. Consider writing an apology letter but **do not send it.**

Are you still in therapy? Have you asked your provider about this, and what do they suggest?"
wholesomememes,fevwbgi,t1_feuz93l,1579402247.0,My wife and I have this problem too. She likes it very hot and I like to not burn my skin off. Basically whoever is at the nozzle readjusts the temperature whenever we swap places.

Can you ask your attorney? Post on r/legaladvice? Would it be possible for a trusted friend or family member to accompany you to court? It might help knowing you have someone there supporting you. I wish I had more advice for you. Hopefully others will be able to chime in.
 Good luck!"

ProjectRunway,fcxo2sp,t1_fcwfu09,1578067514.0,I didn't like this. The flared hemline on the top paired with the baggy pants gives her a strange shape.
Dermatology,fcn4396,t3_ehz2vz,1577802712.0,"Not a doctor so no medical advice, but I just wanted to lend some support. Your mom is right-- they have probably seen worse. Doctors are there to help, and they want to help, but they can't do that unless you ask for it. It might be awkward or uncomfortable but you can do it. You deserve to feel better so make this commitment to yourself."
