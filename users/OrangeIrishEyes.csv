Denver,fdck8cr,t1_fdcg9c6,1578276967.0,"This certainly isn't exclusive to Denver though. Boise ID, Charlotte, Bend OR, Raleigh, etc. are all experiencing the same issues, currently. These were smaller cities that are now being plunged into big city-hood at an alarming pace. The problem with this rapid growth is the infrastructure of these smaller cities is unable to handle or keep up. All of this adds up to immense frustration and sadness for what once was. 
     The road rage is insane here, isn't it? So much dangerous shit going on, it's nuts. I attribute this to the sheer amount of cars on our roads now, along with the ever constant construction going on to change the roadways to accommodate all the traffic now. Everybody is at fault for this one, lol. Many of us come from ranching families who have been here for over 150 years. So yeah, there probably is a perverse sense of ""ownership"" and it's not right. I don't hate transplants, I hate what the mass migration has done to my home. And it is just that..my home :)"
