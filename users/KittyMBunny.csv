This link might help you understand the varying populations of different countries & the number of men who could be considered in their 50's. Don't forget that this will realistically include people at least in the age bracket of 45-65.
https://www.indexmundi.com/world/demographics_profile.html

A quick Google search shows that 40% of the world's population lives within 100km of the coast. Given the billions of people that includes, it's ridiculous to assume that such incredibly vague details would narrow it down to a mere 100 nevermind as you stated only 1 man.

He's male, OP says he's in his 50's but that could be out by a few years either way. As for his living arrangements while OP has met him, it's not a certainty that his parents gave it to him, he may have bought it with them/off them. It's also extremely common in a lot of cultures, perhaps not yours that children inherit the family home from their parents. If he's in his 50's it's very likely his parents have both died. I'm not sure why you find it difficult to accept more than 1 male in his 50's could be living in the apartment complex where he lived with his parents when they were alive. It's possible it looks abandoned as he owns one apartment & is refusing to move & the building owners want to knock it down, sell the land for a development or are planning a huge refurb. There's so many variables to make the numbers I have stated more than plausible.

Defamation would also mean that this man if he got over the huge hurdle of proving that comments that don't name him, give a location, or anything that would identify him to those reading this, would also have to prove the comments were false. 

I'm not sure you understand the process this might help https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-law-made-simple-29718.html

You think otherwise but offer no logical reasoning. Is this really low effort bad trolling? Or do you seriously think this is anywhere close to specific?"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffdwhyf,t1_ff9uao6,1579830658.0,"Not sure what you read but neither article one posted days later than the other separate news outlets I read resemble your comment, neither do the news reports of any of the channels. 

But if you actually managed to read an article for yourself well done. Obviously it's too much to expect you to stop bothering me. I have no idea why this is a personal vendetta with you, why you can't comprehend that when she first saw him kicking her dog be was stood still & that when she tried to confront him he ran away. It's not that complicated.

Now kindly stop swearing at me & calling me a hypocrite, it's rude, obnoxious & uncalled for. Better yet why don't you just pretend I don't exist. Because honestly you were already pissing me off with the attitude & you've crossed a line.  If it wasn't against sub rules I could post almost a dozen links from different sources that match what I've said  what's worse, doing a search to see if I could find one stating I was wrong, not only didn't I find it, I found other reports of other Amazon drivers injuring pets. 

I dated a postman 20 years ago & stayed friends with him & over a dozen others & they've never had an incident  of a postman doing that. It's also a myth about dogs being aggressive to postmen. Although there used to be one, but that was just if they were ginger. My dog adores our postman. But if a postman did kick a dog, Royal Mail would take the complaint seriously & if guilty deal with it appropriately which would involve reporting it. Just as if a worker was bitten  by a dog that would also be reported & there would be consequences for the owner which would prevent further incidents. Which is why I find your stand point do bizarre.

 I also didn't miss that in the article you read, which I assume was an early one as neither Amazon or the driver were quoted, it didn't state the dog was to blame. So other than in your opinion it's embellished & didn't make sense to you. And your personal opinion that she's embellished it so that Amazon would pay for the pet bills. Although your not claiming the article stated anything close to that, your also admitted  that the dog was actually injured. Your opinion is still built on your opinion not facts. 

Not trusting the media is fine, it's why I read multiple sources, obviously some outlets are more prone to bias than others. But when you do as I do, picking reliable ones & two that tend to oppose each other, the things that are common to all are the bits I trust. I also take into account what the source would have to gain by lying or lose. I understand not blindly trusting the media, but equally & in certain cases more harmful is becoming so paranoid that you don't trust anything the media says, as that way madness lies.

Also, don't forget that different states & countries have different defamation & liable laws, the stricter the legislation is that sets the minimum investigation & fact checking before printing an article the more you should trust their reports. So again I find it bizarre that you think the British press on their British sites would print false information about a company worth as much as Amazon? 

I feel more than confident I did my due diligence & then some. I've given you an explanation of how & why I formed my opinion & found the facts. I shouldn't be expected to have to go into such detail but I object to my integrity being so unjustly called into question. I tried to help you, but with every comment it felt that it was a discussion or difference of opinion but you were determined to be right even if you saw video footage of the whole incident, if I'm wrong I'm sorry for that, it's my personal opinion that you for some reason desperately want to be right no matter what. 

Anyway, that's me done I won't be replying again no matter how insulting or offensive future comments become."
entitledparents,ffdqrpv,t3_esjzo6,1579826674.0,"I'm glad charges are being pressed, I understand your reasoning not to, but she is the only one to blame for whatever the consequences are. She also shouldn't be driving until she grows the f up & starts behaving responsibly. So far she's been lucky & not killed anyone, but if she continues at some point she'll hit someone.

Trust me, I know from experience if you give someone a chance by not pressing charges, & someone else gets hurt, that's really hard to live with & messes you up. At 19/20 I got engaged & lived with my then boyfriend well fiance. We'd first met when we were 15/16 he'd moved away for a year or so then we got back together.  I thought I knew him, until that first night he hit me, it just stunned me I couldn't believe it was real. He looked horrified at what he did & begged forgiveness, everything was fine for awhile. But his sister became seriously ill & was rushed into hospital, his dad left his mum for a woman only slightly older than us. His mum was dragging him into the middle of the divorce, we'd be  snuggled up on the sofa or in bed & she'd ring, because she just had to tell him, that fun thing him & his dad did when he was 6 she made his dad do that with him. Blah blah your dad's a list of terrible things, surprisingly swearing free, & she's mother of the year & a saint. She did this to her daughter too, he'd practically beg her not to, sometimes he'd tell me he could hear his sister in the background.  He'd remind them that the doctors said she needed to avoid stress, that would get you don't know the meaning of stress....your dad's evil & I've had so much stress. Her daughter repeatedly being hospitalized all the dad's fault for leaving & she's trying to hold the family together & keep their kids out if it. Sometimes she'd accuse the dad of dragging the kids into it, he had his faults but he didn't discuss the divorce or anything with them & tried to calm her down. But these calls lead to me being hit, punched, kicked, threatened by him as he stabbed the kitchen cupboards saying I was next, choked. The police came more than once, his dad would pick him up, his mum would tell me how much he loved me & he was struggling, yeah bitch cause if you. I believed it I wanted to believe it, but after a couple of months I knew I couldn't stay with him. I ended it but I never pressed charges or told my family because I believed he was having a breakdown & that was the reason. I remember discussing it with his dad & about getting him therapy, feeling guilty for abandoning him. He reached out on social media, by then I was married & not long after he got married. I congratulated them both. Everything seemed fine, he wasn't on FB but his wife was we had friends in common, kids of similar age. I honestly rarely went on, but one night I did & she made a post about her marriage being over. I wondered if he hurt her, but thought I was being paranoid. I made the normal, sorry to hear that, hope you can work it out if not his loss type thing. About an hour later our joint ex is accusing me of being a traitor, wanting to prove what a terrible person his wife is, & every comment he made, made me more convinced he'd hurt her too. I invited her round & she was so withdrawn & later said she nearly didn't come, wasn't sure why she did at the time, but was glad she did. We made small talk & then I mentioned we'd been together & a certain phrase, meaningless to anyone else, but in that instant she knew I knew. She opened up & shared, I helped her through everything that came after & had to confess when he hurt me I wasn't as brave & like an idiot didn't press charges. This wonderful woman forgave me, we're really close friends. But I'll never forgive myself for not pressing charges, because had I made the formal statement, let them gather the evidence, he might not have hurt her. 

Your doing the right thing, EM will face the consequences of her actions, she's an adult & broke the law. If she doesn't learn from this & hurts someone in the future, you'll know you did all you could to prevent that."

LegalAdviceUK,ffdm22m,t3_esrrvz,1579823758.0,"Out of interest what morning of the week was this? I used to start work at 5am sometimes 4am & there's rarely traffic at those times, unless it's the weekend. Yet they claim a third party witness? Is there any mention of other witnesses in the police report? Or details on exactly what you were doing that was considered dangerous?  Because dangerous driving is very vague, you can't just make a statement that som4was driving dangerously. It could mean swerving & weaving across the road, driving in the wrong lane, speeding, brake checking, taking over when it wasn't safe to do so.  Plus  if your in an accident at 3am & a witness states you were driving dangerously, that's something the police would look into, as it suggests driving under the influence. But from what you've said, the police didn't question you about dangerous driving at the time or mention a witness & you didn't see a witness. A third party witness implies not only that they weren't involved in the accident but that they're an impartial witness, if that's not the case that could go in your favour. If they've invented said witness of course that's going to expose this as a scam.

Also worth checking what information was provided about the other drivers speed in the police report, from their black box and any other accident reports. Approaching this  roundabout were there signs instructing drivers to slow down?  60-0 in 30 seconds doesn't seem like excessive braking, did they give any further details?  Such as how long it should've taken & at what time it's considered excessive? If you made an emergency stop the driver behind you should've been able to stop before your rear bumper stopped them. 

It is almost always the driver at the back at fault, & based on the information you've provided it is in this case. I don't understand why it has taken over three years to resolve this claim. It's an accident involving two vehicles, your stating that you stopped at the roundabout & the other driver is also saying this. Every accident investigation involves calculating the speeds & positions of both vehicles. They can easily calculate the stopping distance for each vehicle. Which usually shows the driver behind was either going too fast, was too close, or didn't react quickly enough so is at fault. At this point if you were at fault for excessive braking the evidence would've shown this. If there was a witness that statement would've been received very close to the time of the accident. This should've been settled in 2016. The fact it took so long is suspicious.

I recommend timing how long it takes to go from 60mph-0, ask a few friends & family to do the same. That way you'll knowhow reasonable 30 seconds is, I'd see if you can get a copy of the police report & witness statement, speak to your insurance company to see if they have any advice, look up this third party credit hire company, see if others have had similar issues. Then having gathered all the information that you have find a solicitor specialising in this area of the law & book a consultation. You can often get a half hour consultation for free, if you have all the reports, letters, everything from your insurance company & this third party company they'll be able to access if you have a case & how strong a case. From all the comments here unless something has been left out or changes when you get all the info, it looks like you weren't at fault."

The other 2 married earlier that day as they'd had to wait for it to be built. Because of this the mayor visited  them so asked them a few questions. So my grandad came first looking for work, once settled enough he sent for her. His romantic message that he sent? Come now or don't bother.

LegalAdviceUK,ffbyg70,t3_espy4y,1579786758.0,"I'm disabled & a few years ago I qualified for a Government funded carer for 35 hours a week. I was given details of a charity that does the payroll, tax etc for these carers. So if I used an agency I paid them when the invoice arrived. If however I managed to find a carer to hire directly, this charity provided the contract & payroll. So we would send in the hours worked each day at the end of the week, they'd generate the payslip & post it to us with our copy & anything else needed. We'd do the bank transfer & hand our employee the payslip. When it was due we would get the paperwork for paying tax, nationsl insurance, addressed envelope & everything filled in & instructions on how to make said payment. Simples.

While this group was a charity there are companies that offer these services to small businesses. They need to provide a contract, so you know your duties & it protects both you & the owners. Relevant training also needs to be provided & signed off on, currently you've only been there two weeks & standard training/trial periods tend to be three months although actual training takes far less time. But as your working with food there are strict rules to follow, especially with food allergies. Do you provide any nut products? If so they need to follow procedures to avoid cross contamination, as failure to do so can be fatal. I worked in food production so everything had to have clearly visible labels & list allergens & potential allergens. We had seperate PPE & areas for nuts. We didn't produce gluten free versions of our products, egg was in all products they're the only ones I have experience with, because the others were in all products we didn't need separate rules for handling them. But in a cafe, there is more risks & knowledge you'd need training on. Which products are if any gluten free, keeping the nut products & anything handling/storing them separated from non-nut products, lactose intolerance so ensuring your various milks are separated & clearly labelled .I would also assume some knowledge on them, & which products contain dairy for vegans. Even if things are labelled your supposed to have certain knowledge, so you can ensure the labels are correct.

The fact your all getting paid different amounts is another red flag. Each of you should be paid at least minimum wage for your age. Beyond that unless you have a different position, or are receiving a training wage or there's an allowance for unsociable hours such as early opening or late closing you should be paid the same. If they're not paying your tax & NI you need to pay them yourself, if you don't have enough NI contributions when you retire it's going to effect your state pension. If your tax isn't paid you'll be responsible & could recieve fines for non payment. I have filled out the tax forms for myself as self employed, but I'm unsure if there's a separate form for your situation of being employed but paying your own tax, mainly because your employer is supposed to pay it. Without a contract or payslips, it's more difficult to prove your start date & pay, so you need to resolve those issues urgently. Are you being paid directly to your bank accounts, by cheque or in cash? If directly into your bank that will serve as proof of income. By cheque would also provide a paper trail, however most accounts have a limit on the amount of cheques you can deposit & for additional cheques you'll be charged a fee. If it's cash you have no way of providing employment or what you were paid, you need to have proof of how much you were paid & when.

Some banks offer support for small businesses, there's also apps that can help with book keeping. Maybe bring this up in conversation with the owner? Keeping tax & VAT records can seem overwhelming & complicated but the information is easily available, there's businesses that provide these services to small businesses, banks have information & services available, then there's apps, educational resources. The help & information is out there & your boss needs to deal with all this or hire someone to do it, otherwise the fines could put him out of business."
TalesFromYourServer,ffafejc,t3_esh2mh,1579734458.0,"I live in the UK, I think I've only ever had one cheque book, from my second ATM/cash point account. First was a junior savings & you could use the card to make withdrawals at back or ATM but you couldn't use it in stores like a debit card. But besides having to post cheques for a few one off payments so no direct debit I never used it. After internet banking & paperless billing became the norm, I don't think you could get a chequebook with out requesting one, even when they ran out. My folks are not technology lovers & still don't do internet banking & try & avoid paperless billing. I think the majority of businesses here no longer accept cheques & those that do there's usually a fee. 

So this lady probably doesn't want to come here for a holiday, although those bouncing cheques make any such trips unlikely. In the UK there's bank charges for that & criminal charges for knowingly writing bad cheques. I'm shocked they had the nerve to come back & try it again!

Instead of making a difficult time harder, she could have apologised & distracted her child, moved their child so they weren't so close, I'm sure if I took time I'd come up with others.

Advice,ff7ah55,t3_erx5oy,1579644632.0,"I moved away from my home town & a very large close knit extended family when I married my husband. He was in the military so I was a stay at home mum, the plan was for me to take on accountancy work. o
Once we had a new posting & other things in place, as he was overdue posting at the time we got together. Anyway, life never goes to plan, when we did move it was a temp housing, then there were complications with my pregnancy with baby number 2 & I ended up permanently disabled. We stuck to our original post military plan & moved back to my home town.

I share this as life doesn't go to plan, you need to decide your priorities & both be honest about them. Then if you don't want the same things, you comprise on the small things, but both of you need to be willing to compromise, one of you always giving in will just lead to resentment & drive you both apart. 

We also are all allowed & have hard no's things we're not willing to compromise on. My husband & I both want children, we wanted more like 4 or 5. We're blessed with 2 healthy, amazing sons, my disability meant I couldn't have anymore & my husband thankfully is not fine with it neither of us are, but accepting that's out of our control. He was married before, she SAID she wanted kids, you know one day, said I do & turns out she didn't want kids. She knew had she been honest he wouldn't have married her, so lied. It's part of the reason they divorced & she was right he wouldn't have married her had she known.

So my advice to you is, how important is moving back to your hometown? Is there a compromise? When your SO agreed to moving there in the future, did he mean it? If he did when? What if anything has changed?  You say his reason not to is his job. Are there similar jobs available in your hometown? Is this an entry level to supervisor position or is it specialised, mid or higher management type job. We all change jobs but if this is a career position that he's worked hard to get to & isn't easily achieved that may change your outlook. Once you have these answers which is your priority?  Can you imagine life without your partner? Could you see yourself building a life where you are? It is probably not 
an easy choice but I suspect you already know & it's fine follow your heart. Do whatever it is you have to to be happy."

LegalAdviceUK,ff4c8z0,t1_ff1ckav,1579560211.0,"Forcing a homophobic live in landlord to accept a homosexual couple as tenants would only make things worse. Bigots want to be bigots, they'll perform complicated mental gymnastics to justify their small minded hatred. If they were forced to either be willing to accept homosexual lodgers or not rent out, that would only be used to fuel the hatred. 

Then for that couple, why on earth would they want to live in that situation? It would be extremely uncomfortable at best, with their landlords able to make homophobic comments, throw in the sinning, going to Hell bible BS. That's not something anyone should have to live with, let alone pay rent to live with. Then they'll either have to stay or break contract. Which the homophobic landlords will no double be pleased to be rid of, they'd also try & get them to continue paying rent. 

Yes, in an ideal world people wouldn't be bigots, it's also easy to hate a group than an individual you know who is part of that group. But forcing LGBTQ+ individuals on bigots isn't the answer. In fact it's more likely they'll use it to justify their hatred. Exposure works because they get to know the person as a person, they learn what they have in common & become friends, then find out. They often claim but Bob is like all those others, he's not....x, y, z. In time they get to know others & it chips away at their perception & bigotry. 

Hopefully, as a society we'll get there & not invent more labels for people so we can exclude & hate. Or recycle any, such as the INCELS, who've decided women exist merely to serve/service men. That they should willingly engage in sex with any man who wants it, even in public or if they have a partner.

Make sure you give the police all the information, including why your so unaware of everything that happened. What she did was wrong, she took advantage of the state you were in.

You cannot force her to have an abortion as your unsure about protection you should also get tested for STDs.

I'm so sorry you had this happen to you."
talesfromcallcenters,feokdk1,t3_epqxss,1579301425.0,"In the UK it's illegal been illegal to hold a phone or sat nav while driving since 2017 with a fixed penalty of £200 & 6 points on your license. This includes if your stopped at lights, queueing in traffic or supervising a learner driver. Although it's been illegal to touch your phone even with a hands free headset since 2003. That said the current legislation is being updated in spring of this year to close off some loopholes smartphones have created. https://www.google.com/amp/s/inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/cars/mobile-phone-driving-law-changes-explained-uk-new-legislation-824749%3Famp

It really should be illegal everywhere unless it's a genuine emergency when it's not safe to stop. Which currently UK law does have as an exception. It should also be enforced. No one is that busy that they need to call while driving, it's dangerous. Unfortunately people who call call centres while not having the information to hand is common, but to do so while driving? Is idiotic, dangerous, selfish, inconsiderate. If not narcissistic, that their call is so important that they can risk causing an accident to make it, they probably think they're driving is perfect so it's not a risk them doing it. Then to blame the unfortunate person in the call centre  because they didn't have the information ready & chose to call while driving. 

Call centre agents can't make customers do stupid things. Which is a shame, it would really break up the monotony & they wouldn't waste such powers in that way. I've never understood why people think call centre agents are omnipotent wizards. But they must think they are given the information they expect you to just know, all the moaning about verification, the issues they want fixed. No delivery driver in the area at the specific time they want, driver hours away with only enough driver hours to get back to the depot, item not in stock, limited run item sold out & on & on with the customer thinking you can somehow get that item to them... that or your an evil genius keeping them from the item they desire by hiding them, refusing to sell it, buying them all yourself. Or my favourite keeping it from that one customer because you don't like them, even though this is the first time you ever saw them...

If call centre agents or anyone dealing with unreasonable, entitled, demanding the impossible customers had a magic fix it button or magic powers, we would fix those customers, by making them disappear."
LegalAdviceUK,feof92s,t1_feo4rzg,1579299341.0,"She will need to get that emergency travel document to go by bus, as she will still need to travel by air or water. But the embassy will be able to help her with all of that. 

If her ex follows her & threatens her she needs to get somewhere safe, so back into her room.& lock him out or where there are witnesses about. In an emergency it's 999 for non emergency it's 101. 101 will put her in touch with local police, so she can report a crime that doesn't need an emergency response, so threatening calls, his destroying her property especially her ID. They can also give advice on crime prevention & will be able to put her in touch with victim support & women's shelters if needs be. 

If she has her phone with her tell her to send his calls to voicemail & not read his texts. However, I wouldn't block him as abusers do not respond well to being left, so it's possible he'll admit the truth while apologising or in some other way expose his true nature. She can let the authorities listen, or when she's with others or somewhere safe. But she needs to know no matter how genuine his apology & promises to never do it again, she cannot trust him. I've had a abusive relationships twice, they never get better longer than it takes for you to let your guard down. 

She is very lucky to have you for a brother. Your post doesn't say how long she's been with him or any details of what's gone on. She may not want to talk about it, or hold details back. She has no reason to but they mess with your head so she might feel guilty, that it's her fault, it's not, but abuse often has a grooming stage so you don't tell & cover for them. When you see her she might sit so she's facing the exit, try not to come between her & the exit. If she seems jumpy, scared, withdrawn, maybe ask where she wants to sit & where she wants you to sit. It's a small thing but giving her that control can be an enormous help. My best friend & I only vaguely knew each other until her marriage ended, her ex husband was one of the two ex's that abused me. It really helped her having someone who believed her, our home was her safe place at first. Like all our friends she's welcome anytime & our home is her home. But she did tell us once she was in a better place that she'd found us letting her decide seats & never coming between her & the exits really helped. She said she thought it was a bit weird & odd at first, then realized it helped. Listening without judging or saying what your would've  done/she should've done helps too. Until it happened she probably thought she'd never let it happen, she'd have done xyz but the reality is different.

For me the first physical abuse was a punch to the face, it felt like my cheek bone & eye socket were exploding. I thought I'd hit back & walk away. I.. just...sat...there... It was like it happened in slow motion, if it hadn't hurt so much I'd probably say it was like it happened to someone else, cause it kinda felt that way. I also remember thinking ""did he?....did he just?....nah...he didn't...did he? No he wouldn't..but he did, didn't he?..he just fucking hit me....he hit me. WTAF? He just hit me & I'm...I'm just...just sitting here...why didn't...what am I....what just happened?....was that real...it can't be...but it bloody hurts...What's going on? He couldn't have.. if he did..I'd..well I'd..why didn't I"" 

It felt like forever but it was seconds that that passed through my head & I'll never forget. The shame, I didn't want anyone knowing ever. Some stuff I somehow forgot, then it came back to me years later when helping my BFF.  I believed the excuses, stress, break down I didn't press charges & I'll never forgive myself for that, because he went on to hurt others including my BFF, she's a wonderful woman who has forgiven me, in fact she says there's nothing to forgive. 

I'm only an internet stranger, but of your sister needs or wants someone to talk to. Then you know where to find me so point her in my direction. Other than that sending positive thoughts out there that she's back home, safe with loved ones & this is an unpleasant & barely remembered memory from her past soon."
entitledparents,feo7ig0,t3_eptbww,1579296209.0,">which no one in the school likes, the dudes really sexist and racist

I assume he learned to be racist the same way he became sexist, from his dad who I'm sure was equally unpopular at school. His dad would be unpopular where he works too, if he had a job. Instead he sits at home bitching that all the ----(which ever racist slur he's gotten as word for the day) have stolen the jobs & if it's not them then its ----(hard working & very good at  job) sleeping with --random male (manager/supervisor) to get a job. Because bigots prove the saying if you don't use it you lose it, because they refuse to use logical thinking or common sense they no longer have the ability. This is also why they can't learn from experience that they're wrong.& why people like that are called small minded, when you refuse to use so much of your potential to learn, the lack of using your mind means only the small part necessary to stay alive & be a bigot works, the rest dies off."
talesfromtechsupport,feo5ddl,t1_fenga3k,1579295389.0,"Bit late now but your boss should've rang further up the command chain. Ideally in front of the customer, because 2 hours arguing over the specifics of a contract suggests he could be a lawyer or studying to be one.  I mean debating the fine print would be a skill they'd aquire. Plus my BFF is a lawyer & she always reads the small print, most people don't read any of the print. While I always check the numbers, do the calculations because book keeping & accountancy. 

Regardless of what was put through the till, he had a valid insurance document, so calling head office, in front of him covers yours & your bosses ass, well would have. Your doing all you can to satisfactorily resolve this for said customer. Eating the cost of that additional insurance & giving him a new replacement phone would then have been decided by head office. Because it would cost them very little in reality because  it would only be whatever they pay the manufacturer for the phone. It would've also meant 2 hours weren't wasted & other customers served & minimized the amount of customers hearing him say his insurance covered a replacement & accusations that company was refusing to honour it. 

While also solving the problem of sales staff constantly miss selling insurance. Because bead office would6had questions, demanded answers & taken appropriate action. They would've either retrained (sounds more like actually train) sales staff on what each policy covered, possibly written them up also, or fired one or more. Regardless, it would then have been a matter of time before that 80% of your job was actually doing you job & 20% or hopefully less explaining their insurance didn't cover that. Obviously they'll always be customers hoping for more than their insurance covers or not reading it properly/at all. 

As I said too late now, but this was one of those rare occasions where the customer was actually right. The fact that miss selling insurance  is a very serious issue I'm surprised there wasn't any legal issues & salespeople got away with it so often."
LegalAdviceUK,fentb38,t3_eq2oln,1579290496.0,"I have also had a woman from JW try to force her way into our home after being told to leave. Luckily I had the bar on the front door, my son opened it, & I got there just in time to get the bar on. This old woman still tried to force the door & told me to mind my own business. My eldest is 12, it's my home & it is my business. He got to the door first, because I'm significantly limited in mobility, because he put the dog in the garden it slowed him just enough. My husband is my full time carer, but was out with youngest.  We managed to get the door shut after I got help as the man with her was pushing door also. Then they yanked whatever had been put through the door out of our letterbox. 

My husband tried to report it, but again the local chapter isn't listed. He emailed & got no response but they haven't been back which is the important thing. My husband has been telling them for 6 years we're not interested, but every month or so they'd be back. It's ways been him, ex military & 6ft5, this was the first time he wasn't home. Unfortunately my son had told them it was ""just me & my mum, she's just coming"" as I got bar on. I actually had to kick her foot out door to do it, she'd only gotten toe in. Luckily my eldest is shy so barely opened it & I got there in time. I'm in the Midlands not Huddersfield wondering if this is new policy?"
