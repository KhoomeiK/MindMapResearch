PS4,fezta3j,t1_fezrw89,1579461369.0,"I also have a pc, and most of those things are just general cleanliness tips. You should be cleaning your room, desk, gaming areas on a regular basis regardless.

Driver updates can be handled in software very easily and you absolutely do not have to upgrade your pc every 3-4 years. My dad has been on an i5-2500k for like a decade now. 

Windows can get bloated, fair enough. I just can't imagine that being the biggest hassle in the world, especially if you have a computer anyways, and need to do something like that eventually for that. But it matters somehow when the pc is also used for gaming?"

Antivirus is a resource hog that doesn't really do anything. You know damn well that liquid metal is not a normal consideration, and has no business being included here.

Drivers, sure. But you really don't even need to update those for the most part, and you can have software, like Geforce Experience that tells you when to download and handles the installation. 

Maintaining a pc is not some incredibly difficult thing like people make it out to be. But yes, it is more than just pressing the power button."

AskReddit,fe8v2ho,t1_fe8foq0,1578931255.0,"I feel like you're not reading the first comment made correctly. They said that the body can withstand pressure at 60 meters unassisted. That's true, it's also true that our bodies can go much farther down without any special equipment. We aren't talking about preparations necessary to make the dive successfully, we're talking about pressure exerted on the body, and what it can withstand safely. Nobody needs to train to have a body that can handle that level of pressure, it's just a characteristic."
AskReddit,fe8czc9,t1_fe8b5e7,1578924892.0,We're talking about the effect of pressure  on the body. The person talking about 60m is just making shit up.

AskReddit,fe6xdpn,t1_fe6j4hw,1578907204.0,What do you mean by unassisted? There have been commercial dives to depths in excess of 500 meters without any special equipment to offset the pressure. Just specific gas mixtures.
