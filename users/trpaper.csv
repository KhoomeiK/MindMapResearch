Stoicism,ff3ojl2,t1_ff3k3zn,1579545477.0,"It's incredibly liberating to walk away from the comfort zones. From what you think you need in your life. Only to realize those things were keeping you entrapped.

Stoicism,ff3e5hl,t3_er72kw,1579539257.0,"I think our relationships with the past can be a fairly complicated thing. Letting it go is not simply realizing it is in the past and you are spiraling down a bad mood because of elements out of your control now.  
You have to allow your mind to go there with the past but to come to a peaceful understanding with what happened.  
There is a danger in the idea that you should just let go and move forwards."
