This happened to my boyfriend except his roommate got THREE cats. They eventually left but 9 months later we‚Äôve spent countless hours trying to clean the space and over a thousand dollars on air purifiers, medication and allergy spray. This is going to be expensive for you and put your health and comfort at risk. 
If the lease says no pets then she shouldn‚Äôt have them, so you can talk to her but if she doesn‚Äôt listen I absolutely would escalate to the landlord. I know you are probably wanting to avoid confrontation but it was incredibly selfish of her to do this, because she‚Äôs putting her need for an animal above your health.

My partner has a terrible pet allergy and through that I also learned that hypoallergenic animals aren‚Äôt really a thing.

So for those with the severe allergies getting a pet, even a hypoallergenic one will mean baths for kitty, air purifiers and being on allergy medication.
