Inwardly: I was a mess. Crippled with self doubt and depression. Constantly letting myself and others down. Regretting flying half way round the world on holiday and either being so drunk I couldn't remember it, or so hungover I couldn't experience it.

I certainly did not enjoy being alive."

stopdrinking,ff6gqdr,t1_ff61h68,1579626837.0,"Take one 'xxx' at a time. We all experience chunks of time differently so for some people you might take it one week at a time, some might be one day at a time, and others still might need to take one minute at a time. But you only ever need to get through one at a time.

Find support mechanisms that work for you and use them.

Don't be put off if you fail. I had many failed attempts at moderation and a few more at 'stopping' completely. But we learn through failure and without those failed attempts maybe I wouldn't have been so ready to make it stick.

Imagine giving a child alcohol before they take an exam, before they go to a party, or just to relax them. We wouldn't do it, so why do we think we need it ourselves?!!"

I’m also in the UK; I found it hard to begin with but it became much easier over time - the UK drinking culture permeates so much of our lives! I have found though that when many people find out I don’t drink they’re intrigued more than anything. I think a lot of us in the UK know how wrong the culture is but don’t know what to do about it. Good luck for your journey. IWNDWYT

Edit to add: the reason we hadn’t developed these thoughts until recently is that we weren’t in a place where many of us could self actualise. Think Maslow (or chakras if you prefer) - it’s hard to self actualise and create new concepts to discuss when you’re in survival mode"
