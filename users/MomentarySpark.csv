Then there's the emerging understanding of its role in suppressing immune responses that could be the mechanism for helping with chronic pain and related issues.

So it likely IS going to be found, scientifically, to be a medicine for certain uses as the institutional process of proving such theories progresses out of its dark age of political and moral constraints.

EscapefromTarkov,fdwiqpa,t1_fdwi63b,1578759061.0,"Thanks! I have since lol. I only had 120 rounds on me, but with an SA-58 that's usually more than enough. I would've been fine if I hadn't mag-dumped two thirds of the 50 rounder at one of the PMCs off the bat.

Used all the nades in the earlier firefights, one or two would've made the last fight a ton easier for sure."
EscapefromTarkov,fdwhvp6,t3_en5llp,1578758835.0,"Interchange. Bring a tri-zip and the tritons you get to start with. Play very passive and quiet. Run through the back areas, go to the computer rooms, loot any cpu fan, ram, circuit board, PSU, flash drive, LCD, or phone you find. Check the bags and toolboxes, loot every nut, bolt, screw, nail, light bulb you find. Fill up the slots with loot, then extract.

Don't sell them to traders. Hoard them in your stash until you have like 10-20 of any item, then mass sell them on the flea market around the going price.

I just sold 1 itemcase worth of such loot for $1.3M (not the case itself ofc). Few players bother with it, so the stuff's easy to loot with very low risk.

That's the underpinning of my economy. Between the trizip and vest you have 46 slots to fill. Each of those items is at least $11K on the flea, so that's just around 500,000 per run. Whatever shit tier gear you're running, you only need to survive like 1 in 3 runs to stay in the black with that approach, and if you're smart you'll easily survive 3 in 4.

As you improve, you can do something more fun. Remember to practice offline factory against scavs just to build up game skills since looting like a rat does not really teach you that aspect of the game. You'll build confidence, skills, and cash in no time."
EscapefromTarkov,fdwgrxm,t3_en926d,1578758504.0,"From a week ago. Video starts mid-action (5-10min in). Already killed 1 of the PMC duo. They'd trapped me in the kitchen as soon as I came in and had to do a tactical retreat between 2 thicc bois and the scav waves, one camping the door and the other probably above me holding off infinite scav spawns. Eventually, I killed the ground level one and the top level one came down to handle me, where the video picks up.

All I wanted to do was loot the other PMC and run, but another player gets there and I maneuver myself into a dead end and end up getting my one escape route camped again, but now out in the open to have to deal with all the scav spawns by myself with limited ammo and some potatoing shot nerves. The new player manages to do some looting and gets the other thiccboi's gun, so I'm back where I started but worse.

Could I have played it better? Sure. But I survived with decent loot all the same and extracted, so I guess that's the most you can wish for in the end. A more aggressive play could've been a quick death, and instead I get some ridiculous gauntlet ending, which was insanely fun and stressful. I just sort of gave up at the end and accepted being shot endlessly (not having ammo will do that)."

I just got a 500GB SSD for well under $100 and just doubt I'll ever buy an HDD again when mine are 2TB. At some point, moving large video (totally not porn) files around at HDD speeds gets old. If I'm paying $1k for decent gaming components, why not spend a little extra on storage for non-gaming needs."

Found a pscav one time farming the scav waves by groschen.... not sure he understood how XP gains worked, but at least he got me (lying down in pile of dead) and my thiccish gear for that one with a one-tap (got my gun back at least).

Good way to farm XP when you're level 1 and want to get to Flea ASAP, though. I'll be sure to remember it for next wipe."
