hognosesnakes,fdqcbly,t1_fdpvlpu,1578662805.0,"Then youâ€™re pretty much doing everything that you can do. I would see if you can find a wire top, because that would allow air filtration and would probably help drop humidity, but otherwise, if you canâ€™t, like I said it should be fine unless you see scale rot which could be caused by the high humidity. Hope this helps!"

hognosesnakes,fdpigmz,t3_emf6vm,1578629505.0,"What kind of substrate are you using? I would recommend aspen (if youâ€™re not already using it) because it doesnâ€™t retain much humidity and can hold its shape if your snake wants to burrow tunnels. Your humidity level should be fine, but if you see signs of scale rot, youâ€™ll want to find a way to reduce humidity even more."

BallPythons,fdjwqw6,t3_elr9yk,1578489971.0,"Not sure if this is a temporary set-up, but aspen chips wonâ€™t keep humidity too well. I would try something like Cyprus mulch or eco earth. (Ball pythons need about 55-60 percent humidity.) And you will be fine handling him. Youâ€™ll be able to feel if heâ€™s cold or not when you pick him up. If he is, just keep him close to your body to warm him up."
