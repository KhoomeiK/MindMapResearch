AmItheAsshole,fdpob9j,t1_fdo4k7c,1578634495.0,"It's so fuckin weird how a lot of people seem to have the attitude of ""I didn't mean to do this thing, so why should I apoligize?"" I'd wager the majority of the time someone does something that hurts someone else, they weren't actively trying to do so. But it's still the right thing to feel and express remorse for doing so because it's right to be nice to people. Good Lord"

AmItheAsshole,fdnxmbt,t1_fdnfq20,1578594916.0,I don't understand how someone can say so unironically that the vet is gouging for antibiotics that he implies the cat didn't need when he's so clearly ignorant about vet med. Holy shit.

insaneparents,fdne29z,t1_fdn3kr9,1578583820.0,"Same with my bully. He was a teaching dog at my tech school, so you can do literally anything to him and he doesn't flinch, but his version of play is very assertive. Full body slams by a 50# dog can easily be seen as charging a child, and knocking them over would not be a gentle experience. So with the risk of misconstrued play, we keep him away from kids."
ChoosingBeggars,fdn4rt0,t1_fdlur05,1578577260.0,"Yes, exactly! If my job didn't give me money, none of my bill collectors would accept ""well, you're doing a wonderful service for animals, so you owe us nothing."" If caring for animals didn't give me money, I would be forced to do something else that does.

The love of animals is what keeps me in the field, but love sure as shit doesn't pay my bills."
