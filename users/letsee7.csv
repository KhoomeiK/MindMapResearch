bipolar,feorr6j,t1_feopgrx,1579304501.0,"That’s true. Yes I’m not worried about the past, I accept responsibility where I went wrong but I’m happy that I’m not with my ex. She just wasn’t the right person. Yes of course you should always try everything that you can to help yourself. I was a fighter, I was literally incapacitated by fear, anxiety and paranoia which stopped me from speaking to anyone. I still managed to rise above it at times through gym, positive reading, self motivation. I had no clue that I could not do it just on my own. Towards the end I was so sick of it that I just said ok fine I’ll surrender, I don’t trust the doctors to open up to them but I will. I went and I told the doc everything and now I’m just the best of myself. I kind of missed myself. I need a lot of internal working before I find someone new. That’s also another interesting thing post treatment. Before treatment, I had an incredibly hyper sex drive. I almost feel like I wanted to have sex and that’s it. I always thought of it. After treatment, I have so many normal things to enjoy I barely think of it. It may have been a subconscious coping mechanism or maybe something stemming from being abused as a child. In any case I also never liked being and feeling like a victim. That also stopped me from getting help, I felt weak in getting help along with the paranoia and lack of trust in anyone and anything.

I know where I went wrong and I know that I tried my best with all I had at the time. I also know that my ex was a toxic person and possibly the worse person to be with in this condition. I’m looking forward to an exciting future but even if not, it’s not the end of the world."
bipolar,feof35v,t1_feodibh,1579299238.0,"Yes that’s true and I agree with you. I don’t condone bad behaviour at all. What I struggle to understand at times is that if a mental illness could be seen as a physical visual illness let’s say like a broken leg, would you be looked at the same way if you weren’t able to run with a broken leg? It’s literally impossible for a person with mental illness to know how they’re like and what normal is. 

I’m not here trying to prove a point or prove myself  right or argue. I’m presenting to you a possible point with the will to accept logical reasoning."
bipolar,feoe18h,t1_feodc11,1579298823.0,"Yeah we were toxic to each other. Maybe we did love each other at some point, can’t say right now. I was very paranoid and didn’t trust anyone even the professionals to disclose my issues. I never trusted my wife and rightly so because later on she would exploit every weakness she knew of me"
bipolar,feoboo3,t1_feoarbl,1579297799.0,"Everyone is different. I was awful to my wife, she was awful to me. We were bad for each other. She said I was sick but she did everything to make it worse. I told my doctor about what she said and did, he agreed she was horrible. She is sick too btw but she’s undiagnosed. A compulsive liar, a trickster, someone with no integrity, shouting and screaming all the time, a schemer, all the qualities that help you gain trust and confide in her especially when you’re already struggling. I’m no angel either but not “the” baddie in this"
bipolar,feoam9r,t1_feo9uyj,1579297380.0,Lol being bipolar doesn’t mean you’re always the baddie
bipolar,fdb2akc,t3_ekdkm2,1578252935.0,Love it!
bipolar,fdb25ei,t1_fdaxuwf,1578252878.0,"Nice one. Wow well done for 15 years.

Yeah I don’t think it’s a straight answer, if the meds rewire your pathways. The only way as far as I’m aware to rewire your neurological pathways is to repeatedly do the same thing again and again.

Yes that story is very scary. Ofcourse Id rather be on meds. There are a few side effects of the meds I’m taking for example, I need to go to the washroom frequently mad at night. I get super fatigued as well at times. Sex doesn’t feel that good, orgasming is difficult. I’m not too bothered because after a long time I feel like myself it’s almost like I missed myself.

Things are ok.

Thanks for sharing your insight and personal experience."
bipolar,fdb1k4l,t1_fdaujzh,1578252645.0,"Hey thanks for that. I agree with you on coping mechanisms but the conundrum there is let’s say you’re on meds and you develop coping mechanisms because getting off the meds is a big risk and all the while you’re trying to develop coping mechanisms it may not work, the probability is higher. Ok so let’s say you do develop coping mechanisms whilst on meds then the question is would they still work if you’re off the meds because you can only feel how it feels without meds if you’re off the meds. Not sure if I make sense"
relationship_advice,ej3wnnk,t1_ej3vs1h,1553251931.0,"Thanks very much for the advice. I am doing it for the children. I get angry and frustrated but I want to try my best for the children. I feel humiliated and all but I feel like that’s the best I can do for the children. She seems to not care about the children at all.

She’s so much better than I am at this in the sense that she’s managed to completely cut off. I don’t even have to engage with the court because I’m living in a different jurisdiction. But when I don’t have any more money I’m not obliged to listen to what the court has to say because I’d rather not lose both the children. She’s bullying me saying “make it work” “do this”. This is the reason I’m continuously messaging her because that stage is about to come to us soon and I’m hoping she can come to her senses.

I know exactly what you mean. I’ve tried addressing all her concerns but she’s making zero efforts. Furthermore, I am worried to death about my othe child that’s with her. she doesn’t seem mentally stable, she says one thing and then the other at a different time. I’m trying to explain to her the seriousness of this.

I know completely what you mean and this is how she’s behaving but with me I might have to lose everything like my freedom and etc if she wins the case so I’m trying my best to sort anything out if I can. 

I appreciate your help.

Thanks,"
