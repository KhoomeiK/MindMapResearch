Otherwise, you can get plat via real money purchases or trading with other players - prime weapon/warframe parts and rare mods are how I make most of my plat.

If you decide you don't like a weapon or warframe after maxing it, you can sell it for credits (that's the non-premium currency). You can also collect everything, you'll just need to buy enough slots."
