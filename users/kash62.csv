Advice,fe6uakc,t3_eo1khm,1578905293.0,"This is probably just bad short term memory. A friend of mine literally has the worst short term memory, ex. Lick an envelope and two seconds later wonder why her tongue tasted gross. I think you can try to be more attentive, practice active listening, but at the end of the day if that doesn’t work, you’d have your memory to blame."

depression,fe623pa,t3_enrs4c,1578880060.0,"Today I tried opening up to my mom about my mental health problems and immediately I stopped myself for this same reason.

SuicideWatch,fe610lo,t3_enq58n,1578879372.0,"I’m sorry your friends put that on you. That’s not something that you should have to go through, especially when you tried to stop it from happening. The only thing I can say is that they’ll either get over themselves, or you’re better off without these people in your life.

Also I know where you’re coming from, in that you’d feel bad for your family if you took action, that’s how I feel too. I love my family, but I personally see myself bringing them down more often than not, but that’s still what stops me. I’m sorry you’re dealing with these feelings, DM me if you ever want to talk more"

I know you’re going through a tough time, but things will get better eventually. Take some time and do some cool self love things (for me it’s face masks wine and movies), and try to keep yourself happy/busy by doing things you love in the meantime, until you feel you’ve moved past this."
SeasonalAffective,fe0gfv7,t3_ehkvmr,1578813035.0,Moved to AZ and it only delayed the onset of my symptoms sadly. But I know that spring is just around the corner for us (late feb.) so there’s that!

AmItheAsshole,fdui33w,t1_fduhiqq,1578733352.0,"Oh I thought mom had another car for her to use in the meantime but not actually her own. Sorry. Still stand by what I said. And even then I doubt having a revoked license will stop her, if her mom is so hell bent on letting her drive."
AmItheAsshole,fduhe1d,t3_en0zfr,1578733013.0,"Yes you’re TA. You didn’t have to fully revoke her license. She’s 16. You should’ve taken away her car for a month, and not even let her take it to her moms considering you bought it. In my state you can appeal a suspension. I completely agree she wasn’t making good choices by texting and driving, but having a car is important for a 16 year old, and IMO taking that away for two full years seems like a bit much. Even in that time frame she could grow to understand the consequences of texting and driving. Worse, make her pay for her ticket and be driven around by you everywhere, and if you don’t feel like driving her at certain times, remind her of the consequences of her choices."

AskFeminists,fdhm591,t3_el1vik,1578425574.0,"1. She’s a 15 year old girl so the mom does have some right to say what she doesn’t and does want to see her daughter post, regardless of how innocent the picture actually is (I agree the mom overreacted though) 
2. Part of feminism for me means letting women wear what makes them feel comfortable, and not harassing them for it. I think the mom arguing that her daughter isn’t a feminist because of this is ridiculous"

AskFeminists,fdhiwb5,t1_fdhdkuy,1578423597.0,"Anytime I bring up the wage gap, she explains it away that women just aren’t as good so they shouldn’t be paid as much, and she states that women are payed less because they choose lower paying jobs (obviously this isn’t why the wage gap exists). I’ve bought her some reading material but she’s not a big reader, which IMO contributes to a lot of the misinformation she’s been given by her family and others."
AskFeminists,fdhikrz,t1_fdhedzg,1578423403.0,"She’s somewhat religious, and not exactly thinks they should be treated with violence but she’s convinced that men can do so many things better, and “women are too emotional to handle responsibility well”. Just things like that. 

And to be fair we’ve been friends for a very long time, these views only recently seem to be brought up by her and it’s kind of unsettling."

Do you think he’ll try to hurt you once you report him?

I think if you think you can, and you feel like it will make you feel better, than yes. I don’t know too much about the legal side of things, but those are the questions I asked myself before deciding not to report. Message me if you need to talk."
