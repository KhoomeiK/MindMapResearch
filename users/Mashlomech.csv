canada,fds0tvf,t3_emx543,1578692498.0,">  Neil Peart, the drummer of iconic Canadian band Rush, has died at age 67.

The band attracted a loyal,Â worldwide fanbase, sold millions of recordsÂ and influenced a multitude of rock musicians with its complex, literary music.Â

misophoniasupport,fd6cg9t,t1_fd65jms,1578188849.0,"It's my pleasure. When I was your age Misophonia wasn't a recognized thing yet. Google wasn't even a thing yet. I had no idea why I reacted this way, and it caused a lot of problems with my parents. As I got older and finally understood it (in my 30s), I had to have these conversations with my parents. Eventually they understood, and they felt horrible for not understanding or helping me when I was young (not their fault). My dad is full of guilt because he used to do the noises *even more* because he would get so annolyed with me. I don't want you to go through what I did. I hope this helps. You're not alone.  
   
And really, I think printing it out and reading it to them (with your own edits) is a good idea... it will help you get through it.   
   
You can do this. It may not go perfectly, and that's ok. Unless they are really assholes, talking is better than not talking and things will start to get better.  
   
And don't rush it... whether it takes a day or a week or a month. You'll know when the time is right.   
  
I'll be thinking of you and wishing you luck."
misophoniasupport,fd620c8,t1_fd5m90l,1578184448.0,"So... I'm going to put this the way I wish I'd done it when I was 13 (a million years ago!).   
  
Only you can know what they'll respond well to, but this is how I think I'd do it if I could go back in time.  
  
Let them know you need to talk to them about something important and ask them when would be a good time for them to sit and talk. Be ready in case they say ""now"", but also be ok with it if they ask to wait a bit. You want to have their full attention, so if they're busy with something else it won't be a good time.   
   
Don't be afraid to write everything down in advance and just read it to them when it's time - it would help you to make sure you say everything the way you want to.  
  
Then I'd say something like this:  

Mom and uncle, I want to tell you about something that I've been going through. It's been really hard on me and I've been dealing with it by myself, so I want to ask you to just listen to all of this first and then we can talk and ask questions after. Please take me seriously.   
  
So, I've discovered that there is a neurological disorder that makes a person very sensitive to certain sounds. It's called misophonia. I've read all about it, and everything I've read sounds very much like what I've been experiencing and struggling with for a long time.  
  
It causes certain sounds to trigger a very anxious and even sometimes painful response in the person. You know how sometimes when you [*add your own example*]  I'll start saying [*add your own example*]. Well, that's because the wiring in my brain is actually causing a really awful experience for me when I hear that sound [*use your own words on how it feels*], and I honestly can't help my reaction. 

**** **At this point you can use some of the paragraphs from the ""Letter to friends"" that someone else linked to, to help explain what misophonia is.**

Then...  
  
I know you may not believe me or you may think I just read something stupid online, but let me ask you this... you know how much I struggle with certain sounds. I'm telling you straight out that it causes me emotional and physical pain, and now I'm showing you research that shows it's a real neurological disorder and other people suffer from it - I'm not the only one. Do you really think I'd be making up something like this or asking  you to stop your noises all the time just to be annoying? I promise you I'm not. I'm in pain. I know it's been hard on you too and that it must have always seemed like I was just being so annoying and picky, but in reality I'm suffering and I'm asking you for help.  
  
This disorder was only identified about 15 or 20 years ago and they've come a long way but there still aren't many doctors that are familiar with it. I've read other people's experiences where they've had to search for a while to find the right kind of help.  
  
But mostly it seems to be something you just have to learn how to cope with. Some people wear earplugs all the time, some people have to remove themselves from the situations that trigger them, and that sort of thing. But the biggest and most important piece that helps bring some relief is if the people they're closest to believe them and try to understand.  
   
It's been really hard for me to talk to you about this and I was really scared that you might not believe me. All I want is for you to understand and to be on my side while we try to figure this out together. I love you. Will you help me?  
  
(Your parents may be crying by this point so go give them a big hug!) 
  
Good luck and please let me know how it goes. ðŸ’œ
