In both cases, I’ve lost to the dude who ended up winning the tournament. In both cases, it’s given me insight on what I’m doing wrong. 

In the second tournament, it was at a convention that only happens once a year. I asked the dude if he wanted to mirror match (which I’m horrible at) since we both mained 2B. He stomped my ass. I got to talk to him afterword and hearing him talk about everything is what drives me to get better. It made me realize that I had so much to learn and that I wanted to get better so that this year I can hold my own against him. 

**My point is that even if you’re a casual player, go to tournaments. It shows support for the community. Even if you get stomped, it forces you to look at what you’re doing wrong. And if it’s the case of being a local tournament, you usually get to talk to the people that beat you and they will usually be willing to help you.**"
