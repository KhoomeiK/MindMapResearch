Technology and hardware has evolved a lot in that time and the system probably can't reliably handle the updates. They're not bricking your system and telling you to buy a new one, they're telling you that your shit is too old for them to support any longer."
actuallesbians,ffc4mye,t1_ffc447u,1579791416.0,"Early 20's is the perfect time to experiment though? Get out to a gay bar with a friend and if nothing else just get a feel for the atmosphere and vibe, and like before if you're honest, it shouldn't be an issue, just don't dump everything on them at once. Also as far as touching girls goes, just communicate and do what you'd want done to you, to her, and work from there."
Minecraft,ffc42yu,t3_estvuk,1579791036.0,"Try hardcore mode if you haven't already, maybe try some survival maps, like skyblock or survival island types. Also, mods are fun if you can install them, i know you said vanilla but there's nothing wrong with mods imo, there are some really good ones out there depending on your taste."
actuallesbians,ffc3qyb,t3_estway,1579790804.0,"Well you said it yourself that you need to break up with him, so do it. Once you are out of that relationship, instead of going on tinder looking for men, just change your app preferences and update your profile, be honest with the women you talk to and just go with the flow. When you get into that bedroom situation, be honest but dont be afraid to try things out, if youre clear from the beginning that you have limited experience, it's not going to be a problem. The big take away here is to be honest with your partners, current boyfriend included. As far as coming out to family and stuff is concerned, start with friends and gradually work your way up to family, it's never easy to come out to family, so be prepared for that. Good luck!"

YouShouldKnow,fdyw8nu,t1_fdyi100,1578784220.0,"I guess they're getting at specifically ordering fries with no salt just to put salt on them when you get them, if instead you just ask for fresh fries, they'll just be made fresh and save you time and the worker frustration. A different process goes into making fries with no salt, not super different but it does eat up time because you can't put the fries in the bin or use the tools provided to quickly scoop the fries into the container. Gotta get clean tools and pretty much individually grab the fries and put them into the container, not labor intensive but a time eater if you just want fresh fries with salt. I see no problem with ordering fries without salt if you actually want them without salt, it's ""getting around the system"" that is so frustrating when a customer could just ask for what they actually want. Sorry for the essay and if i came off as aggressive, just trying to see each side"

reddeadredemption,fdneom2,t3_emb4a5,1578584204.0,"I personally liked guarma, it was a nice change of pace imo and i had fun with it. I really enjoyed the sound design and the character interactions, really showcased how arthur and dutch's relationship changed, and i feel like the riding scene after you come back wouldnt have had as much of an impact without going through that harrowing situation. Overall i felt it was a nicely designed level, i do agree that the explorable part of the map is super small, and theres that one like, cabin in the north of the island i want to go to but im not allowed i guess."

TwoXChromosomes,fctlvug,t1_fcrx7w8,1577948190.0,"Its a huge issue because nurses are underpaid, overworked, and in incredibly high demand, especially RNs. It doesnt help that long term care in general is, in my experience, mostly run by religiously oriented groups, rather than groups geared toward healthcare. As stated by someone else above me, capitalism is also the issue. Nursing homes and other long term care facilities are designed to squeeze as much money out of not only the resident, but also the families of these people, it's predatory and fucking sad. My opinions may not hold much weight, but i figured id better clarify my experience with long term care, mother is a nurse and worked in long term care for over 30 years before jumping ship. She did everything in her power while she worked to care for these people, saw it first hand many times, and have come in to run food carts at the ass crack of dawn myself to make sure these people got what they needed. At every place she worked before switching career paths, the issues were always always always upper management/owners/execs/administration whatever you want to call them, just, according to my mother, not understanding the demand LTC puts on nurses, financial strain it puts on residents and their families, and how much money it actually takes to care for a person who is essentially dying. Of course knowing all that, neglect is inexcusable, and i've heard many stories of nurses and other staff being fired, stripped of their license, being arrested, etc. It's a known issue in the long term care field, and lots of places are doing their best to hire good nurses and ditch the bad ones, but it's difficult when no one is applying at your facility, because LTC sucks and doesnt pay as good as say, a position in dialysis treatment, or a position at a walk in clinic. It's easier to draw blood all day and make the same money you would pushing carts full of pills, changing catheters/diapers, managing families visiting, etc. An oversimplification, but you get the idea. As far as i can tell, long term care is not a field that most health care professionals want to be in, and it's an area that is largely controlled by those who do t want to pay their employees, or hire enough staff to actually run the facilities properly, which is where the security issues come in. If they wont pay the nurses, who are taking care of the residents for 13+ hours a day, a proper wage, they sure as hell aren't gonna pay for security. Sorry for the long ass rant, if it wasnt clear, everything ive said has been from personal experience, so its heavily biased. Again sorry for that goddamn essay, but it's a topic i have a lot of opinions about"
