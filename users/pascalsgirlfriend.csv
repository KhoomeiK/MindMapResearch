When people were making 20k+ a month I didn't get a huge raise, by when times are tough nurses take no increase, and now get a roll back. People say they pay my taxes like I don't pay taxes too. I don't own health care, if you want to go into it, go to school. Work nights and holidays, work mandatory OT on your child's birthday or your anniversary, because there's no one to cover the shortfall on the next shift.  Work through your breaks and into the next shift because you've been too busy to chart. Cut the health care budget, and the front line workers then complain that you had to wait in the ER or on the unit when you're really sick. You can't make people happy, no matter what you do."

Edmonton,ff98m20,t3_esbew0,1579707364.0,"My son works at a SCS. The regular clients that come in daily or nearly daily are people with significant mental health problems who are often homeless or inadequately housed. They live in poverty and with food insecurity. There is a huge correlation with childhood sexual abuse, poverty and neglect. Many of these folks are barely literate and had a single parent who was most likely using while pregnant and may have FAE themselves. In short, these kids who grew into addicts never stood a chance. If they clean up, will you hire them at your business, pay enough to rent an apartment and buy food? Probably not. And if you said yes, most of these clients are too disorganized and ill to take advantage of the opportunity. 

He also said that the second cohort are regular people who come in a couple of times a month to use heroin, etc and are not who you would expect. 

I guess my point is that there will always be addicts and people so ill and unfortunate that they will likely not be contributing members of society. But then again there's lots if others who aren't either, but they don't use SCS."
