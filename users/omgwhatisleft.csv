AskReddit,ff9w9fl,t1_ff8hrqp,1579722887.0,Yes. I agree. I have lots of young children and aging parents to take care of. And while they all bring me so much joy. It’s rare that I get to do something selfish that is just for me.
AskReddit,ff8hbat,t3_es85uw,1579678482.0,Shopping by myself at the mall. Sounds terribly shallow. And I have a great life and am always generally pretty happy. But something about a solo shopping trip just makes me so happy. Maybe because it’s the few things I’m doing for just myself.
confession,ff8h5rc,t3_es803h,1579678287.0,I always wonder if angry bitter old people turn this way with age or have they always been this way their entire lives? My MiL is that way. I can sympathize that there is probably mental health issues going on but I don’t need to be the punching bag for it. So I just avoid her at all possible chances.
AskReddit,ff8gw3o,t1_ff8e4tz,1579677940.0,Yep. I remember my friends got school and room and board and cafeteria completely paid for by loans. Plus got like a $2k refund every quarter. They were living it up!! It was a combination of financial aid and loans. Of course you have to pay back with interest after. That’s how they get you.

JUSTNOMIL,ff5kxfz,t3_errphv,1579597857.0,"I think you’re NTA. But I for see this being a HUGE issue for your relationship. For me - it would probably be a deal breaker. I won’t stop you but I will not stay with someone who chooses to go somewhere I am not welcomed.

Personally, I hate going to my ILs and haven’t been in over a year by choice and luck. My husband goes every single weekend with all our kids. When I go visit my family, with or without my kids - I always prefer my husband not go because I have a better time without him. 

With that said, hell will freeze over the day my husband goes and takes my children somewhere I am not allowed to go for no good reason. And I would not betray him by going somewhere he isn’t welcomed. A family is a packaged deal. The priority is your partner. If someone else can not accept that, they don’t get to be a part of our lives."

But aside from that he wants nothing to do with other people’s children at all. He would probably lay down his life if it meant the safety of random children and there was no other choice. But aside from a life death situation he really wants nothing to do with them. He’s a lot more empathetic to parents and children since having his own. But still, doesn’t want to be around them.

I’ve done thousands of weddings and am ALWAYS paranoid I will over sleep. Some of my assistants would just not sleep so they would not over sleep. I also would call all my assistants the morning of and make sure they were awake and getting ready too so no one would be late. 

The ONE time I over slept. It was my best friends wedding and I was sleeping in the hotel room next to her. Thank God. I was newly pregnant but didn’t tell anyone and just so exhausted. I woke up to her mom banging on my hotel room door 20 minutes after the time I was supposed to start. Everything was fine. But man. That was the worst feeling."

He got so mad at me, he spanked me with a fishing pole. Now spanking isn’t that uncommon in our culture or household so I’m not even mad about that. But I literally was ALWAYS a good kid my entire childhood. Like, I never broke any rules and never warranted ever getting punished by either of my parents. So to get spanked for this... was beyond fucked up. But for some reason little me didn’t have the heart to tell my mom what happened. Or anyone.

You will be changing ice pads every few hours from your vagina. You will be naked and struggling to breastfeed. You will be forced to get up to pee and poop. You will have teams and teams and teams of nurses and lab techs and doctors coming in to draw blood form you, from baby, measure you, measure baby, every imaginable poking and prodding will happen every 20 minutes.

The rest I just chalk up to annoying habits"
AskReddit,fcy08qk,t1_fcx30cw,1578072861.0,I mean why not just give it or sell it away
AskReddit,fcwxlng,t3_ejckb7,1578041956.0,Some red box. With a brownie. I think there was also mashed and corn. I can’t tell you what he meat was. Fried chicken? I ate it again once out of nostalgia as an adult. Horrible. Just horrible and not edible.
Showerthoughts,fcwxayk,t1_fcwx2wd,1578041590.0,I read that in my kids dinosaur books. Apparently T. rex would sound more like a frog. Haha
AskReddit,fcwwrst,t3_ejbmup,1578040926.0,"My mil went on a trip, that my husband I paid (in the upwards of $10k) for because they were bitching about how they couldn’t afford it. She comes home with an authentic designer bag in the range of $3000 as a present for me. W.T.F. If she had that kind of money, why did we bother paying for the trip. I rather she just pay for the trip herself so I could not have spent that money. Not to mention I have never once complimented or accepted anything clothing or accessory related she has ever given me because she has horrible fashion sense. I literally would not carry that bag because it doesn’t fit into any of my outfits. And what the fuck. They’re not people who can afford $3000 bags, especially as a gift to a DIL who barely speaks to them, literally. It just baffled my mind. AND ON TOP OF IT, she did not keep ANY of the boxes of bags or tags so you can’t even sell it for value. She literally bought it, stripped it and stuffed it into her suitcase. I kept asking, hoping, praying, that it was a fake knock off but she kept insisting it was bought from the airport and was authentic. Ughhhhh. I didn’t even know what to do with it and I couldn’t complain about it because we have history and I would  come off as an unappreciative  brat when my MIL is giving me something nice. It just sat there on my kitchen counter for months taunting me.

Finally one day my sil asked to borrow a large sum of money, and while I wasn’t against it. It gave me the opportunity to completely blow up about how irresponsible they are with money. Case in point: that damn purse. I told my husband to get it out my sight. So he brought it back to his mom and said I didn’t want it. It still pisses me off to think about it."
AskReddit,fcwwfx2,t1_fcwrsmp,1578040504.0,Why not.
AskReddit,fcwwdkn,t3_ejbnc7,1578040423.0,"I spent the whole night avoiding my date, who was a friend but I found out he liked me so I wanted nothing to do with him. I literally just hid with my girlfriends who I dragged along as 3rd and 4th wheel. I was a horrible little brat. I wish I was a nicer person looking back."
AskReddit,fcwvvzv,t3_ejbtol,1578039817.0,"I would give my children an explanation when asked. My dad was a big fan of “no” and “because I said so” and would get irrationally mad if I asked again or asked “why no.” 

I think explaining I don’t want my kid going to a dance because I don’t want them to drink and do drugs after or get raped is a perfectly acceptable reason (while paranoid) is better than just a flat out “no.” That way, the kid and I can come up with a compromise that would make it feel okay for them to get to go but also be safe. Or at least they would know why it was a “no.”"
