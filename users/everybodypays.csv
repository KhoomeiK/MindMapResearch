Everyone left her when they realized she was overdosing, so she died alone in a new city, in a house she didn’t know. I had known her since I was 12 years old and lived next door to her until I was 16, we were close until the end, and a month prior to her death she threw a birthday party for me and baked me my favorite cake. We laughed about how ugly the cake was because she had squished it on her way over, but it still tasted really good. 

You’re an asshole. Fuck you."

cats,fdzcdiu,t1_fdx0ek6,1578788838.0,"Pepper is teeny tiny, she’s always been that way. She looks even tinier in her old age too. I had her for a couple of years before she had Baloo, I got them both “fixed” about a few or so months after she had him so I’ll never know for sure, but I always wondered if her being so small played a part in her ability to have kittens, as she just had the one in the span of 2 years of being an indoor/outdoor cat."

BreakUps,fdvgpcl,t3_en15os,1578747210.0,I held a dildo and cried over it once because I used to use it with my ex. I can sympathize.
