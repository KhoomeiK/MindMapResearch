gifs,fdyse4m,t1_fdxsk14,1578783088.0,"Of course I didn't mean 'never lock out your knees ever'. I was referring specifically to deadlifts and some other exercises for that matter, and the risk of hyperextending and injuring your joints on heavy sets. Tbh I thought I was in /r/fitness where I would've probably gotten some helpful replies rather than a bunch of downvotes.

After reading up on it I understand that full extension is preferred for several reasons, but that it's recommended to take extra care and consider stopping the motion *just* short of lockout if your joints are hypermobile and can hyperextend.

Take for example this explanation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5luMl7FrY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5luMl7FrY) (btw don't get blind-sighted by the video of the guy breaking his knees in half)"
