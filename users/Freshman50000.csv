AMA,fffn96o,t1_ffecfla,1579887612.0,"Sounds exactly like my experience with coke (probably because you can’t usually buy coke around here without getting a bit of meth in it.) You hate it while you’re coming down but once you’re down it’s like...maybe it wasn’t that bad, I could go again. 


I’ve got a file on my laptop entitled “whee” which is just a bunch of my adderall/coke/meth fuelled ramblings that I always felt in the moment would be the next great American novel. Usually ran out of steam after a couple pages of ranting but saved it just in case- now I have dozens."

So many young men who will now be remembered for their jobs and deaths because they didn’t get to live long enough to do anything else."
AskReddit,ffedy7i,t3_esy81b,1579844464.0,"I grew up in a small town (20k people) and my dad works as a doctor at the hospital there. When I was 10, a nurse he worked with (who lived close to us) had a dog that had puppies, and we bought one of them. That dog, she was the best dog ever. When I was 17, we found out she was in kidney failure, and after a long fight, we called a vet to come to our house and put her to rest. 


Weeks later, my dad is at work and he runs into the nurse who sold him our dog in the first place. He tells her that she died, and the nurse tells him that actually, her dog (our dog’s mother) passed away recently as well- that she’d gotten very sick, and that the vet almost hadn’t been able to fit them in for the euthanasia, but that when the vet had found out where they lived, they’d managed to fit her in. Turns out the vet that came to our house and euthanized our dog got into their car, drove ten minutes away, and euthanized her mom, too. Super weird coincidence IMO."

Anxiety,ffcuklz,t3_estiyf,1579807561.0,"What helped me was when I was actually in hospital *feeling* like I was dying from a panic attack, they hooked me up to a machine and showed me that even though I couldn’t breathe and it felt like my heart wasn’t beating and I couldn’t feel or move my arms or legs- I was fine.

relationships,feovffj,t1_feo60lx,1579306258.0,"You’re so on base with that fourth musketeer comment! I worked as a nanny for a couple.

dogs,fenqrdc,t3_epza1e,1579289451.0,"I’m so sorry. I’m tearing up reading this; I remember when I had to let my first dog, Shale, go and it was devastating. I was 17, and she had kidney failure. The vet came to the house, and I thought I was ready, but the minute she walked in, I couldn’t breathe. Grief provokes such incredibly visceral reactions that sometimes our bodies react without our control. 


I was broken by that loss, I won’t lie. She had been my dog since I was 10 years old, and she was all I’d ever wanted. I think of her often, and in the years since she’s passed, my grief has become less sharp, and I’m able to remember her and smile- thinking of the way she would always bring us socks when we came home, the funny way she would drop and roll onto one shoulder if you petted her, the way she loved to lick your hands but would rarely lick your face. One day, you will remember Lucy and your first instinct will be to smile, instead of cry, because instead of feeling the immediacy of her loss, you will feel the happiness that she gave you for more than a decade. 


You don’t have to do anything for now. Cry, eat, sleep, have a few beers or smoke some weed. Let it out, then let it out some more, and then rest. Give yourself the space and comfort to begin to heal. The rest will come with time. 


I have a new dog, now. Her name is Piper, and she’s so much like Shale but also so different. Her arrival didn’t replace my loss, or fill the hole that Shale had left behind, instead she carved out a whole new place in my heart that is uniquely hers, that she will occupy until the day that one of us leaves this earth. And when one of us does pass, whichever it may be, I know that Shale will be waiting to welcome us on the other side."

FundieSnark,fekbqap,t3_epg7t4,1579196720.0,"Also, they SHOULD WANT to fund international abortion access charities- in places like Kenya, where abortion isn’t legal or easily attained, live, full term babies are ACTUALLY being killed- by women so young and so poor and so desperate that they feel it is their only way to survive. Babies are being thrown into rivers, and outhouses, and fed Coca Cola until they die of organ failure, or even killed with a hammer. The way to stop or prevent this IS TO FUND SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. If you don’t, you’re just saying you’d rather the baby suffer at full term, when they’re already born, rather than when it’s a non sentient blob. 


I had an abortion at 8 weeks. It was not a sentient being, it was an amorphous blob- one that I would not have been able to look after if I had been forced to carry to term."

Also [spoilers season 4] there’s that scene in S4 where Jamie wakes up and says he dreamed about Brianna and the freckle on her neck, and without giving too much away, in the later books there are other instances of Jamie dreaming about stuff he shouldn’t have any way of knowing, so idk where DG is going to take it- but it seems that Jamie may have his own magical connections."

As a girl with a lot of hours logged at therapy, I can honestly say that I don’t *want* to be approached while waiting for/leaving my appointments, and it’s nothing personal. Therapy is a really emotional thing for some people, and personally I’m in a really fragile headspace after, and sometimes nervous beforehand as well. I’m in therapy for anxiety, but you never know what others are in for- a session for me might involve chatting about setting healthy boundaries or handling work without panic attacks, but someone else may spend their sessions reliving trauma of sexual assault or significant loss. You can imagine the potential difference in the head spaces of two people leaving therapy if one just discussed boundaries and the other discussed their worst living nightmare. 

It’s always really nice to get to know people, and I think that girl would probably be flattered to know that you want to get to know her! I just think it’s best to connect over a common interest that isn’t a shared mental illness- that isn’t a building block for a strong and stable friendship."

I agree though. It isn’t funny.

The Vietnam war is a tragedy to me in part because of all those young men who had no choice, who were sent to their deaths just because of a lottery system. No draft for anyone, and if possible, no war."
Nanny,fcv7u45,t3_ej16mu,1577996451.0,"Ex DB I had once was obsessed with making sure his son was in “enough extracurriculars.” He didn’t want a single day of the week to go unbooked. It was play group Monday/Thurs/Fri, music Tues, etc etc. If we missed getting out for a day, he wanted to know why. 


NK wasn’t even 1 year old. I could’ve propped him in front of the dryer and he would have enjoyed it as much as a music class 😂"

I used to be a nanny. I charged 20$/hour for ONE kid. Three kids, for three days, when you could be freelancing for more money? 35$ is the bare minimum indeed. If it was worth it to them to have time to themselves, it would be worth the price you’re asking for, or they should have sought out childcare sooner. There are no shortages of babysitters out there."
