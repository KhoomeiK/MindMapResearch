fatlogic,febp15q,t3_eo3ywx,1578961175.0,"I see both sides. 

I have an eating disorder so I swing from binge eating to not eating and back again. It’s brought on by childhood stuff which has made me hate myself. 

But also I’m obese and need to lose weight as I have type 2 diabetes which will kill me if this continues. However, dieting plunges me into the restrictive part of my eating disorder, which is bad for me because, again, I’m diabetic and if I don’t eat my blood sugar drops. Plus when I’m in this restrictive mindset I stop taking my medication in fear that tablets have calories.

So I find that I support body positivity, as in loving yourself, as a way in which to want to take better care of myself. And part of that is losing weight. 

For me it’s not just as simple as cutting calories because my mental health adds complex issues. I know I’m not the only one too.

I’ve even spoken to doctors about this but because I’m not underweight or making myself throw up I don’t fit the criteria to get help. 

I honestly think if someone comes out and says they have an eating disorder they should be able to get help. Because it’d save the NHS in the long run."

I had this. 

Somehow I magically sprained my rib. 

It could also be costcondritis which my flatmate has.

It’s worth checking it out with the dr but unless you have other symptoms I doubt it’s an emergency."

I’m only eating one meal a day atm and have started tracking calories again. 

The good news is that I’m going back home early because of all of this so hopefully I’ll start feeling better when I’m way from her"

I’m at my mums and she’s spent every day lecturing me about how I need to lose weight and exercise more. I’m disabled so it’s not that easy. She’s not letting it drop.

So I’m back firmly into eating disorder behaviour. I’m eating one meal a day. I just can’t help thinking that if I lose weight I’ll finally be loved and accepted for being me."
