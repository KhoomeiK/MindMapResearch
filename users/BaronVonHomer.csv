brisbane,ffeb1tc,t1_ffe8lk1,1579841759.0,"Here‚Äôs a shitty story for you, because let me tell you while a dog shitting in a car is shit, imagine it shitting on the train.

My friends have a neo mastiff. These are huge dogs btw. They live in Russia and don‚Äôt own a car so it means taking the dog on public transport. Which btw is totally fine in Russia. Anyway they were going on holiday and it was going to be something like ten hours on the train. So they thought it would be a good idea to feed the dog a really big meal two days before the trip, so he could do a massive dump the day before and then mostly fast during the train trip and only have water and some bickies. Well. The dog got massively constipated and did not shit at all in the days before the trip. So they just assumed it would be fine and he would keep holding it. Nah. A few hours into the trip shit started to pour out of the dogs arse. The train compartment became a sea of shit. My friend and her brother started emptying their suitcases and using their own clothes to mop up the shit. But the shit kept pouring out. So they got to a point where they were wading in shit, trying to plug the dogs arse with their clothes. They were given a heavy fine and then kicked off at the next stop. Which turned out to be in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere in rural Russia. They had to walk for ages to find a bathroom, get cleaned up and then go buy new clothes..."

reactivedogs,ffabxr1,t3_esgzrl,1579731923.0,"Relatable. We adopted a four year old dal two years ago. A high energy breed and we thought this would be perfect for two high energy people like us. Neither of us had ever had a dog before which is why we wanted to adopt an adult dog as our first dog. The shelter said he was great with everything. The meet and greet went well.

Very quickly though it became apparent our dog had no training, no socialisation. He didn‚Äôt even know how to walk on a leash. Later on I learned that he had actually spent the first four years of his life in a mill. So it all made sense. The biggest shock though was his reactivity. I had no idea that dogs behaved like this. And his reactivity was bad.

My husband decided to distance himself from the dog. He refused to go for walks with us. He didn‚Äôt want to be seen with our dog in public when he was having one of his melt downs. It embarrassed him that his dog wasn‚Äôt *perfect*. And obviously the cunts who look at you like you‚Äôre Scum Of The Earth or make rude comments to you when your dog is having an episode...they just make it so much worse. That stuff really got to him. So I knew from there on it was up to me.

I started doing research. Contacted various trainers until I found the right one. Took my dog to vet appointments to get him anti anxiety medication. And persevered with his training. Well about a year later it really started to pay off. Two years later and my husband goes on walks with us every day. He loves the dog. Claims he is the greatest dog ever. Spoils him rotten. But it took me a lot of work for things to get where they are today. I‚Äôm proud of how far my dog and I have come.

My advice is to not focus too much on how your husband feels about this situation. If that‚Äôs how he feels there isn‚Äôt any point in fighting it. Take the situation into your hands and work with your dog, I promise you will get great satisfaction in seeing how far your dog will come! Good luck! You and your dog can do thisüí™üí™üí™"

Dogs walking behind us - also fine. Dogs walking on the footpath on the other side of the road - yep, not a problem. But dogs walking *towards* us head on and looking at my dog? Big no. He will pull and lunge like a dick. So obviously I avoid this drama at all cost. Ironically he loves playing with other dogs, loves the dog park/beach and anything where all of the dogs are running around off leash. That said, considering he was once reactive to any and every dog anywhere nearby, this is a huge victory for us."
reactivedogs,ff0uz0t,t3_eqrvkp,1579472519.0,"So, my friend rescued a Jack Russel that was four years old and displayed similar aggression towards dogs and people. This dog had been abused by her owners (who kicked her and hit her) and was attacked frequently by the other dogs in the household. Unsurprisingly, in the beginning she hated all dogs and humans. Her first days at home she bit a family member and then a neighbour totally unprovoked, and had some run ins with other dogs. My friend has had the JR for two years now and it took over a year for her to unlearn the aggressive behaviour towards people and dogs. 

However to me it sounds like this dog does not suit your situation based on energy levels alone, but also because you live in an apartment populated by other dog owners. Are there any Jack Russel rescues around where you live? The reason my friend was able to keep the dog she adopted was because she lives in a house with a big fenced yard - so she accepted that if her dogs issues were not resolved her dog would just have to stay within the confines of her home. Your situation is hard. You can see how you go, let your dog settle, do the two week shut down. Muzzle train. And be prepared to live the life that other reactive owners live: walks at odd hours, no visits to cafes/dog parks and constantly being vigilant. While muzzles are great, it doesn‚Äôt mean accidents can‚Äôt happen - like if your dog squeezes past you as you exit/enter your apartment and gets out and bites someone or a dog."

brisbane,fezusx5,t3_eqwna2,1579461937.0,"Well the week is already off to a shit start. Rain made my house swell up and be weird because it‚Äôs a 100+ year old Queenslander. Could not get the door open. Key snapped because it was stuck in the lock which got fucked, so we have one key left until Bunnings opens. Door is fixed at least. Got up at 4am to take dog out. I look at my veranda and see that the plants I planted on the weekend (to replace the ones eaten by the possums) have also been eaten...and yes they were a totally different type of plant to the original. A plant that my neighbour gave me because she‚Äôs got heaps growing in her yard and it never gets touched by possums. I am convinced this is definitely a personal attack on me from the possums.

When the dog goes to lay dog eggs at the park I drop all my poo bags while I‚Äôm cleaning up and because it‚Äôs dark I don‚Äôt realise this. Until my dog goes to make another set of choc logs. I realise then that I have lost all my bags. The bag dispenser closest to me is empty. I do a circuit running between all of the poo bag despensers (five in total) *all* of which are empty. 


At this point my sneakers are absolutely soaked because I‚Äôve had to run on grass as a shortcut trying to find more bags before my dog drops another missile. Because my shoes are fucked we turn back and head home. I found the poo bags I lost, pick up the truffles my dog left and head home after barely any exercise done. Though to be fair, with the humidity at 90% I was going to have a bad time regardless."

Russians can have pretty intense temperaments. Not all of us are that way, but there‚Äôs a lot that are. For example, my great grandfather murdered his boss because the tone he used when speaking to my great grandfather was *disrespectful*. Ivan, my great grandfather was really pissed off. He decided his boss owed him an apology. Ivan turned up at the house of his boss that same evening and demanded an apology. The boss said no, get fucked. Ivan bludgeoned the guy to death with whatever was on hand. Ivan had two daughters and they both behaved similar to Natalie. Rosa would deliberately feed food that was off to her husband to make him sick if he pissed her off. Valentina, my grandmother - she just generally behaved exactly the same as Natalie to the point I‚Äôm always a bit shook watching their segments. And my mother is exactly the same behaviour wise. Same illogical arguments, demanding bullshit apologies from her husband and arguments over nothing. It‚Äôs really awful. My grandmother and my mother both grew up in the USSR. I left Russia when I was six and did my growing up in the West. I admit in my youth I was a huge cunt too. It wasn‚Äôt until I had been around my husband and his family for several years that I *mellowed* the fuck out and learned not to be such an angry unstable cunt. 

I think some of this could be cultural. In the USSR girls were raised to be hard cunts. My grandmothers father fought in WWII, and in the Red Army women fought beside the men. Ivan raised his daughters to believe that men and women are equals and to never let any man try to boss them around or make them feel weak or unequal. I imagine a lot of girls around the country were raised like this by fathers and mothers returned from combat. My mother told me the high school curriculum was that boys and girls learned all about combat - you were graded on how quickly you could assemble/disassemble a rifle and have an extensive knowledge of artillery. Despite Russia still having many traditional expectations of women, being feisty and aggressive is still considered a positive trait? Anyway I‚Äôm not social anthropologist.

That‚Äôs what we did, just a few emails back and forth which we then showed to the rescue we adopted through because they wanted proof that we were allowed to have a dog. Be prepared though if the property you are renting wasn‚Äôt originally listed as dog friendly then you might be out of luck."

brisbane,fdx7wy0,t3_en7tsh,1578766188.0,"Was so keen to sleep in today, since I get up at 4 every other morning. It was nice and rainy when I went to sleep and thought mmmm this is gonna be nice. Then at 3am this junkie started screaming his head off while pacing up and down the street. From his deranged screaming I gathered that some skank who was letting him shag her in exchange for meth also let another junkie shag her. Because he also had meth. Well apparently this was not on, because screaming junkie was such a *nice guy* and did *so much for her* and how dare she fuck him over after all he‚Äôs done. He called out to the whole street that he was going to show her, teach her a lesson, ect. I remember my first night in Ipswich there was a big knife fight between junkies in front of my house and I was shaking like a leaf and went to sleep with a switchblade in my hand. These days I just sit in the shadows on my veranda and watch the show unfold."

Hugging my dog so hard after reading this post. I hate that such horrible people exist but I‚Äôm glad that this dog was dumped on your property. Not that it makes what happened okay, just glad people like you exist. I saw in the comments that you‚Äôve saved a number of dogs over the years and I think that‚Äôs incredible. Thank you for looking after the dumped dogs, you‚Äôre a wonderful person."
brisbane,fdss7ym,t1_fdsrqts,1578707267.0,Might put out a dish of water on the veranda then hmmm. Actually this makes a lot of sense. The pothos plants all had a lot of water in the pots and they went and fucked up all the ones I was propogating...So yes will put out a water bucket on the veranda (the rest are in my back yard) but these cunts are probably lazy.
brisbane,fdsr955,t1_fdsqejm,1578706910.0,"Wow I thought chillis were one thing they would leave the fuck alone. The fungus thing, I feel you on that. You have to be really careful with watering when it‚Äôs already humid...what pisses me off is that I don‚Äôt even grow anything slightly edible? But they ate my star jasmine to a stump (that shit has poisonous sap ffs) and now my pothos is on their hit list for some reason...urghhh."
brisbane,fds9rng,t1_fds99kr,1578697627.0,"I put the scraps far, far away from the house. My whole reason for doing this was so they‚Äôd would keep away from my house and not use my roof as a trampoline all night long. And it worked...until now. But what you‚Äôve said pretty much sums up the possum psycheüòê"
brisbane,fds2na5,t3_emresc,1578693412.0,"Seriously fucked off. Every morning I wake up and water the plants on my veranda and check how all my plants are growing. This morning I wake up and see that fucking possums have gone and done a hate crime on my pothos plants. I have been working on getting them to grow long and climb over the bamboo screen for a long time. Now I‚Äôm really fucking good to wildlife. I put out fruit scraps, lots of water bowls and try to make sure no one is starving or thirsty. And they go and do this to me. Fml. Will be putting the dog on the veranda for possum watch from now on.

Here‚Äôs a picture taken before the plant massacre to give you an idea of why I‚Äôm pretty upset üò≠

brisbane,fdp001q,t3_ema4b5,1578616764.0,I think each suburb needs a FB group (like the lost pets ones) that posts pictures of dog owners who don‚Äôt pick up their dogs shit. Seriously it‚Äôs so gross! And the worst offenders are nearly always old guys with little white fluffy dogs. What‚Äôs up with that? Was really tempted to take a picture of a guy who let his dog shit next to a bunch of houses and nonchalantly keep walking. I really think that if there was a page that publicly shamed people who do this they‚Äôd be more likely to clean up after their dog.

reactivedogs,fdm5o5s,t3_elvw16,1578540404.0,"If I‚Äôm walking my dog on my own I will carry a riding crop. It‚Äôs light, easy to swing and keeps the offending dog from getting close to mine and biting. A hit with it hurts but it won‚Äôt injure the animals. A friend of mine wears a go pro now and lets people know their dog is being filmed. She‚Äôs had great success with this as it puts fear into shitty owners as they‚Äôre typically the kind of people who can‚Äôt afford a lawsuit/massive fine."
dogs,fdm4oz3,t3_em2ib4,1578539723.0,That dogs are actually very complex animals and experience mental health issues and trauma just like us humans. And that they are just in general very clever creatures. Before we adopted our dog I thought dogs were just happy go lucky creatures and totally uncomplicated. I knew that you had to train them obviously but that other than that they were just really chill the rest of the time. I soon found out it was far from that when we had to put my dog on Prozac for several months and do intensive training so he could overcome the four years of neglect and abuse from his original owner who had been running a mill. He‚Äôs doing great now and doesn‚Äôt require anymore medication or rehabilitation and I‚Äôve learned what clever and sensitive creatures they are.

It‚Äôs not exactly one of those cool asf Kate Spade wicker novelty purses...
90DayFiance,fdihcl7,t3_el97ig,1578442933.0,I follow a bunch of IG models on IG and the majority are paying the photographers for the photoshoots. There‚Äôs a few who have a best friend who is a photographer and others who have a photographer that they like to shoot with who does all of their photos. Sometimes it‚Äôs the husband that does it and they‚Äôve invested in a really expensive camera. This way they don‚Äôt have to pay a photographer and make more money. Otherwise though a brand will pay the influencer a set amount for the promo and the model will make the arrangements for a photographer and pay them out of whatever she‚Äôs getting.

brisbane,fdi7das,t3_el9evz,1578437040.0,"Are you me?
No joke though, F/28 and could have easily written all of this. I was prescribed an antidepressant which helps take some of the edge off or at least makes me appear/behave normal on the outside when I do have to interact with strangers. But doesn‚Äôt change my lack of desire/drive to put myself out there. However the thing that has probably helped me the most is my dog. Having a dog forces you to leave the house and because dogs are cute as fuck it‚Äôs hard to avoid other people coming up to say hello. It really really helped me push through my phobia of interacting with strangers. Also because dogs are really social animals I started going to the dog park which again meant forcing myself to deal with social interactions. I love my dog and want him to live his best life and by doing that I force myself out of that comfort zone. Just for him. The joke in my family is that he‚Äôs my unofficial emotional support animal. I realise that everything I‚Äôve said here would be useless if you‚Äôre not a dog person, but mainly just wanted to reach out and say hey - I get it."
brisbane,fdi5q2f,t1_fdhhluu,1578436205.0,Haha mine was to get up at 4am and go for a run so I can get home before the sun is fully up. I have to set two equally loud and obnoxious alarms. It gets easier if you‚Äôre able to be in bed at 8pm...
