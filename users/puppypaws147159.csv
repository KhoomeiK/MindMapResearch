C25K,ffa7edb,t1_ff82dl9,1579729329.0,Thank you kindly for your response ! The 6 mph is a little daunting to me at this point.I was doing probably about 4.5-5mph (I probably could have pushed it a little faster) but I have no running experience and i wasn't sure on a specific speed to aim for so I just went with what was comfortable. It's an excellent goal to aim for the end of the program ! Thanks a lot !

cats,fc61b9g,t3_egbld0,1577470025.0,"He was a cunt , in the end I was more pissed about how he left my poor cat in the long run . The other two we had for a shorter time together and were ones he brought in . My boy was the cat I picked out and is my baby . But he's hopped around from my moms to my in-laws to our own apartment in the last couple years and I just make sure he knows we are all leaving together"
cats,fc5t78h,t3_egbld0,1577465331.0,"My ex and I had 3 cats together . The night he left for good , he packed ALL of his stuff and the majority of what we had and the 2 other cats all while I was at work . When I got home , it was heartbreaking to see my cat basically think he was abandoned , it must have been so scary . Now he has bad anxiety when it comes to moving . Poor guy will be okay but I know how heartbreaking it is :("
