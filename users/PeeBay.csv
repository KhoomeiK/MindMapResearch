progun,ffb0ltj,t1_ffabk80,1579748848.0,"Is he even still relevant? I mean seriously how long can he bank on this crap? I wager he's going to fail out of college soon and become basically a punchline for some VH1 ""I love the 10's!"" when they make  that a few years from now."
KingOfTheHill,ff9nyqi,t1_ff8r7pd,1579716968.0,You still got a big head and you probably can't hear us with all that sound absorbing muscle. Now we just laugh at the fact you have no neck.
progun,ff9d8q3,t1_ff97qk3,1579710444.0,Yeah we have Lloyd Doggett here in Austin. God I hate him so much. I think there should be term limits for both chambers of Congress.
progun,ff96q2x,t1_ff91lcq,1579706141.0,Hey now get his name right. It's governor blackface.
progun,ff96hbb,t1_ff94xsk,1579705980.0,Hopefully you guys vote her out. Especially after she cost you guys 25k jobs with amazon.

progun,ff7vv1h,t1_ff7v0tx,1579659585.0,"If we vote in people who are pro-2A, why wouldn't they be? I feel like you're being an agent provocateur here and are begging the question of committing violence. I personally don't advocate violent means to bring about change. Do you?"
progun,ff7ufj0,t1_ff70nmi,1579658623.0,"Uh, that wasn't the point of a peaceful protest. We are aware that this would not have swayed Governor Blackface. It was to send a message to the people voting on these bills that there will be a big battle come the next election. This will backfire badly for them."
progun,ff6tx5h,t1_ff6e7nk,1579634803.0,Not following your logic here. You mean by not turning violent we are sheep?
progun,ff56yic,t1_ff4wydt,1579582011.0,"Oh, I wonder if he was going to do some ""comedy"" by putting shoe polish on his face and going ""Oh LAWDIES!!!"" or whatever racist people like him do when they do blackface."
progun,ff49grf,t3_erhvil,1579558451.0,Governor blackface was praying for violence. He wants to have soviet levels of control.

KingOfTheHill,fee7pjd,t1_fedstb7,1579028115.0,"Oddly enough he also seems to understand women much better. Even when he's going on a weird tangent, he's not too far off the mark about women wanting to be romanced or even when he's talking about Peggy not being tamed. Peggy is a strong-willed person, even if misguided a lot, that Hank seems to not really get sometimes. Bill seems to understand how women think. His big problem is he is depressed to a point that he is self-sabotaging.

Unlike Boomhauer who just shotguns it and takes whatever he can get, Bill has shown when he is confident he can woo a woman pretty easily. When he was in his boxers and pulled over by the cops because of the tank, he got the attractive blonde cop to agree to go out with him dancing and get her number.

In the flashback we see when Bill goes to jail, we see all kinds of women throwing themselves at him and crying that he's leaving for the army. Bill when he has his shit together is a really great person."
MonicaBellucci,fec7yty,t1_febln19,1578968221.0,Hell yeah!

todayilearned,fe6cltd,t1_fe6blvu,1578887030.0,Plot twist....he's a time traveler and the episode stole it from HIM!
KingOfTheHill,fe5x4so,t1_fe5snl2,1578876910.0,"She really is, you forget it's Phoebe saying the most trivial corporate nonsense in that tone that just makes every fiber of you disgusted by her banality."
KingOfTheHill,fe5wuxc,t1_fe5wcc7,1578876735.0,"I legit saw that as the event horizon. Peggy is a borderline narcissist but she always came back from the edge of being irredeemable. When she realized she was abusing Bill to do well at the MLM thing, she knew she was wrong and made amends for it. With Luanne she was a mother figure who took Luanne in from a dysfunctional home and encouraged her to do better. Lucky was white trash but he seemed to genuinely care about Luanne and to be fair, they do explain he was raised as trailer trash.  Can't blame someone for being trailer trash, albeit well-intentioned trailer trash.

What she did him in that episode was inexcusable."
KingOfTheHill,fe5r0cv,t3_entcuz,1578873308.0,Still cracks me up how basically half the cast of Friends was on the show at some point. Playing radically different characters. Kudrow's character was so hilarious in how corporate and mundane she was and Anniston's was great as a biker chick.
KingOfTheHill,fe5q7i5,t3_enr8xw,1578873021.0,That stud wouldn't even look her in the eye!!!
KingOfTheHill,fe5q1uj,t1_fe4jpo6,1578872934.0,But why are men so attracted to hoes?
KingOfTheHill,fe5pv9x,t3_ensgxa,1578872819.0,"I think I had the same look as Hank when she had that reaction. It wasn't that she was disgusted by the idea of wife swapping, it was who she would end up with. To me, this was the most WTF thing for Peggy. 

Her worst action was intentionally fucking up Lucky's education when he was genuinely trying to better himself. It's clear he had potential judging how his sister got her shit together. That was one of the lowest things Peggy could have done. A good teacher would be eager to fill an ignorant mind with knowledge. Peggy isn't a good teacher, she's a sub par substitute."
KingOfTheHill,fe5pfux,t1_fe5cv5f,1578872555.0,Maybe he could go to a support group for people who got too many wedgies and went to pieces.
KingOfTheHill,fe5c9km,t1_fe5bw9k,1578867618.0,They have a strong economy so I imagine it'd be a place like Vietnam (popular place for losers to pick up mail order brides) or the Philippines.
KingOfTheHill,fe5c0ga,t1_fe4g4vd,1578867508.0,"Yeah, but notice it's usually sad women. Miss Lis is rebounding from her divorce and basically using him to get back at Buck. That one cop was obviously pretty crazy and he inadvertently flirted with her without realizing it. Ward's mom.....had Ward....it's not her fault. A person can only have such a loser for a kid who disappoints you."
KingOfTheHill,fe44zut,t1_fe443m6,1578855833.0,"Oh yeah I think the only reason I picked up on it was because for years before that episode aired, Walter was the neighborhood weirdo.....Wardo?"
KingOfTheHill,fe43yxl,t1_fe43f50,1578855595.0,"I'm paraphrasing, it's the sick need a doctor. Now whether or not he meant go target the weakest of the world, it seems like they tend to target people with addictive personalities. Cults do it too, but in different ways.

KingOfTheHill,fe415cm,t1_fdyfhjx,1578854768.0,"Still not as good as Hank's ultimate burn, ""Hey fatty, you are fat!"". It was such a burn that Australia looks like a fucking weenie roast compared to his sick burnage."
KingOfTheHill,fe40b7x,t1_fdzqmbx,1578854585.0,"I mean Jesus even said that a doctor doesn't go to healthy people but sick people. It's kinda in their manual to go after vulnerable people. Someone who is happy and well-adjusted doesn't need to be sold a cure to all their ailments, real or perceived, like someone who can't put the bottle down or stop shooting up with the needle. The church becomes their needle/bottle. It's their beedle or nottle."
KingOfTheHill,fe3zvyl,t1_fe3shiu,1578854463.0,Hank should have played the Narrow Urethra card.
KingOfTheHill,fe3z3s1,t1_fe3u2hf,1578854194.0,"When she said that line I couldn't stop laughing. We had a neighborhood weirdo who was obsessed with martial arts and witchcraft  that we all joked was kidnapping cats to sacrifice to Ninja Satan. When I heard that line the first time, me and my brother were going ""OMG! WALTER!! WALTER!!!"" except Walter was really fat. Ward is pretty thin so yeah but that's how Walter was."
KingOfTheHill,fe3nkpc,t1_fe3kqpl,1578851047.0,You said that gangs stole that jacket because it was the wrong color!
KingOfTheHill,fe3gxik,t3_en9t9z,1578849142.0,"I grew up Pentecostal and they had a Halleujuahween at the church instead of having us go out in to the wicked world. My parents still took us trick or treating but being it was South Texas, we often got Chick tracts. Yeah that episode hit hard because we had just barely stopped going to church and the scars were still there.

Basically it was Jesus Camp but amped up way worse. People would be rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues. As a kid I laughed my ass off so much they sent me to Sunday School because I couldn't stop laughing at how idiotic it all was."
nathanforyou,fe34tli,t1_fe334xt,1578845911.0,That ISIS like video that they made was just too much. I pissed myself laughing so hard. The folks at the library were not happy.

KingOfTheHill,fe319qn,t3_ennmgm,1578844950.0,Love that episode. Best scene without Ward is when Hank goes to his house and his single mom undoes her top button and invites Hank inside.

KingOfTheHill,fdy9cw2,t1_fdq90hg,1578777389.0,You can tell who here wasted their money on an art degree because of the downvotes.
KingOfTheHill,fdpudeh,t1_fdpol9z,1578640849.0,"True but it's hilarious how people try to defend the pretentious assholes. I'm not knocking genuine art, it usually comes from tortured souls who are unappreciated in their time. The irony is the same building I guarded had the Austin State Hospital, a mental hospital, have an annual event selling patient art that was amazing in order to fund the  hospital and get sick people help. They were way better than most students that paid to go to school.

I'm not knocking art. I'm knocking douche bags who think they are artist when they are hacks.

But yeah, modern art is bullshit and those who pump it out should be arrested and beaten for their nonsense."

progun,fdouqja,t1_fdnhaoo,1578613318.0,"Frankly I am in favor of removing the NFA completely. It's illogical and is an infringement on the rights of free people. If you are dumb enough to start trouble, you get shot like that idiot is. Making it legal for everyone to carry will curb the urge to shoot up what is perceived to be easy targets. I bet good money no one is going to target a church in Texas for a good long while now that they see what people are capable of doing if you want to start trouble."
progun,fdou7ll,t1_fdnk02v,1578612978.0,"Except the NICS system goes based on convictions via the FBI database. So yeah, his crazy ass would not be cleared for a gun purchase at a shop. But no no, more gun laws that aren't enforced on crazies but used to punish honest hard-working citizens like me is the answer."
progun,fdou0aj,t3_em8sug,1578612844.0,"So when a trained group of people at a church stop a madman, they are the problem. Yet the very system that should allegedly flag a nutjob like him has failed multiple times will somehow work if it's suddenly a universal background check makes total sense, right?

Liberal logic at its finest."
KingOfTheHill,fdotjoh,t1_fdomv3g,1578612546.0,I don't know....depending on what was said he probably might have been keeping it well enough. Then again it's California so yeah...they are an insane state.
KingOfTheHill,fdollvd,t1_fdnxv56,1578607630.0,I don't think legally they can stop it.  Technically speaking using a voice to differeniate his questioning could be argued as a legit tactic to let the juries know who is talking in regards to roles. Silly....yeah...but not technically disallowed.

KingOfTheHill,fd5wizt,t1_fd5urjx,1578182391.0,"You know I wonder if it's so much being a moron or just having horrible self-esteem. You can't move that much product on a MLM without being pretty savvy. I think what he is used to is being dumped on. His dad abused him (spanking him every day and making him wear dresses and also sticking him in a rabbit hutch at night), his wife left him and was cheating on him from the beginning, the Army...yeah well the Army does a number of people. Bill is used to being abused.

When he stood up to Hank in that moment, he demonstrated a confident and articulate person. Then he quickly reverts back. I agree with you on the show being realistic. A few days of therapy will make great headway for him but it would take a lot more for him to keep those gains."
KingOfTheHill,fd5u9rm,t1_fd5sfgy,1578181581.0,"Bill was so adaptable to things because he just desperately wants to be loved.
