Calmly handle your family when they are doing various boundary stomp things and you're going to come off great...just make sure to try and get some idea of what you need from them as to respecting you and your child.

Good luck"

JUSTNOMIL,feeokzh,t1_feelpvb,1579037960.0,"His kids don't have the grandmother because their grandmother is acting like a bint.... Removing you and inserting her for a relationship is terribly unhealthy she either accept your family as it is or she accepts nothing.

she wouldn't talk to you the way she does if your husband pulled out a shiny spine and gave her some goddamn consequences. currently as it is she's allowed to say whatever she wants and your husband so focused on kids having a relationship with their grandmother that he ignores it..do you really want your children around someone who is consistently bad-mouthing their parents?

My grandmother was a piece of s*** and I'm 38 now I'm old enough to actually know what's going on somewhat. I hated having to spend time with her cuz she was a selfish nasty human and in the 12 years she's been gone, she's not missed.

Edit: As an adult I never once reached out or felt the desire to have a relationship with her, but we were the SG son's children."

Trump got involved because the NFL wanted nothing to do with him...Trump bullied the league, which had just began to directly compete with th NFL for college grads. The USFL played in the spring, more football after the NFL Superbowl. Kind of probably the biggest reason the league was able to grow. 
Trump bought a team convinced the owners to move the schedule to directly compete with the NFL and ruined the league.

A smart man would have grown the league, made more money than the NFL  and that's how you would have won...."
