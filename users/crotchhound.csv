Literally I don't care if a woman wants to call herself nonbinary, I can see where they think they might benefit from not being viewed as women but 99% of the world is going to either know they're female or assume they're male based on how masculine they look/dress. It's an aesthetic choice with some dumbass politics and a victim complex attached to it. It's the idpol that comes with non-binary identities that I can't stand, not their personal relationships to gender roles. W/ nb lesbians specifically I always took the ""lesbian"" to mean they still acknowledge the reality of female homosexuality though and would be dtf. Idk any irl, the majority of enbies I've encountered are straight/bisexual women who think they can't dress a little masculine and still fuck men w/o making up a new gender role."
dryalcoholics,ff669hv,t3_ertk5c,1579620141.0,"It's always going to change, but in the mean time try those things out. I found out that my mind and my body want to work. I was stifling them with alcohol. Without trying, I got healthier after I quit drinking. Finding outlets for that new energy instead of dousing the flame will give you a different perspective. I've always been self conscious, it's uncomfortable. It's also something that fades the more I face it. It takes a long time to build good habits, and it'll feel corny when you're used to rolling your eyes at it, but that's the sensation of low self esteem. You'll get through it and come out on top of it on the other side."

dryalcoholics,ff11mut,t3_er0cbk,1579474370.0,"Yeah, I've learned when I start thinking I'm ""over it"" that's just my dumb monkey brain wanting to be drunk. I don't actually have control over my drinking once I start, except for the effort it takes to stop... again. Relapses have taught me I'm either going to be sober or I'm going to be drunk, and being drunk is miserable because I don't stop! I don't moderate! I don't have one drink at a party and come home! Whether I can or can't isn't the question anymore, I don't pretend it's dependent on my ""willpower"" or how good or bad I am, it's that I just \*don't\*. That's reality for me, and I have to live in it, might as well do what's best for myself."
truelesbians,ff0zc4v,t3_er2tdi,1579473753.0,"I'm sorry you had a bad break up, that happens. Take the time to work on yourself and grow instead. Every woman is an individual, learn to listen and view them more clearly without drastic romantic thoughts clouding your vision, because the signs are always there when a relationship starts going down hill (or started off poorly to begin with.) Self awareness will take you further than anything else when it comes to dating.

And not to be cruel, but this really isn't the forum to beg women to convince you not to fuck men. If that's what you're interested in doing ""for company"", you need to be honest with yourself why."
truelesbians,ff0w4vi,t3_eqxyr9,1579472813.0,"I understand why people are afraid of them, especially in America with so much gun violence and senseless shootings in the media. But I'm a gun owner, where I live ""going shooting"" is a thing to do on the weekend. I wouldn't really know how to explain to someone who is adamantly anti-gun and believes I'm a moron for keeping one for home and self defense, or that the second amendment is outdated, or there is only one use for a gun, why I support gun ownership. So if it was a dealbreaker for a woman, I guess I'd just accept that and move on."

dogs,fej5pzf,t3_epbith,1579157961.0,"I play an informal search game with my dog where I have him find a toy I hide. I'll walk it all over the park, hide it, and continue walking in other directions before coming back to him to release him. I know he's following my scent to find the toy, because he'll sometimes walk right by the ball still following my tracks. It's really entertaining lol those noses are something else."
dogs,fej56hc,t3_ep5dxl,1579157337.0,"I love puppies! I was just wistfully looking at pictures of my dog when he was a puppy and wishing I could do it all again. He was so goddamn cute! I especially love when they just go and go and go for a while then pass out in your lap, exhausted. Watching then awkwardly grow in to their stupid, disproportionate bodies? Such joy."
truelesbians,fej3xik,t1_fej2k73,1579155975.0,"I can tell you I don't fall in love with concepts or theories. I don't get turned on by pronoun badges or denying the reality of a person I see in front of me. The people who throw around words like TERF and genital preference/fetish are willfully mistepresenting a sexuality they don't have (lesbianism) because they think it will spare someone's feelings. Lesbians arent validation machines, we are complete and greatly varied women."
truelesbians,fej2k73,t3_epevlk,1579154528.0,"Why would someone label you bad/evil (transphobic) for being a lesbian (innate female homosexuality)? What purpose does labeling lesbians as transphobic for being gay and not attracted to males serve? 

I think these are good questions to ask yourself when you are faced with this ""discourse"". 

Who does it benefit for you to change your understanding of lesbianism and try to incorporate people you aren't attracted to because of their born sex in to your sexual and romantic life? Is it you? ðŸ¤”"
BanPitBulls,feidjzm,t1_fehmmv0,1579136000.0,"Husbandry refers specifically to breeding and raising animals, more along the lines of raising livestock or the profitable kennel this woman is trying to establish, not hobby raising reptiles or having a pet cat- it is generally a full time job."
dryalcoholics,fehuou0,t3_ep8kfc,1579124229.0,"Damn, that's a whole ordeal. I'm glad to hear you came out of it with a different perspective this time. Your moods are always going to change, you won't always be happy, but alcohol will never help you out of whatever comes. Can I ask what the gabapentin is for? Is it supposed to help with withdrawals? Or did you end up with some neuropathy symptoms?

Next time you get low and find yourself on the precipice of a binge, just remember... it's a passing feeling :P

truelesbians,fecgpnl,t1_fecf9rk,1578973504.0,"Well, I'd consider 22 young. I think most gay and lesbian people are still trying to establish their individual identities later in to young adulthood than our hetero friends. Internalized homophobia doesn't discriminate, gender conforming or gender nonconforming-- not to say that's exactly her issue, but I've found that it tends to tie in to that vehement ""Why? Because I'm GAY?"" mindset. It proves that it's on her mind just like it's on yours, but when the subject is broached, she's feeling shame.

I'm sorry your roommate made you feel bad, but you can still enjoy what you want without sharing it with her, if she's going to be unnecessarily critical. Every lesbian is an individual, but there's only so much culture available to us. I'm going to go check out this Girl in Red now LOL"
GenderCritical,fecg1g3,t1_fece3wt,1578973038.0,"I agree that on an individual, personal level his actions would hurt his mother and sister's feelings. His mother and sister's sentimentality is also rooted in adhering to a cultural practice historically used as a way to oppress and enslave women. What I don't understand is GC's incredible dedication to defending feminine performance for females, because they make the choice to take part in a patriarchal, heterocentric tradition, and celebrate it with an archaic procession of a family heirloom their great grandma also lost her identity in too. I guess it hits too close to the cognitive dissonance threshold for the hetero radfems to take a closer look at why a gay man wearing stage make up and lip synching is utter misogyny but criticizing femininity and gender roles is mockery."
GenderCritical,fecbthl,t1_fe8yxfc,1578970337.0,I can't believe how abysmally you got downvoted lol. I guess femininity vs womanhood isn't a discussion for GENDER CRITICAL (?)
truelesbians,fecbgs0,t3_eoctjr,1578970141.0,"Does she know you're a lesbian?Especially with music and literature, lesbian representation is something I now seek out. I want to listen to songs and read about lesbians lol sue me...Maybe she's just feeling insecure. If she's young, she might be struggling with her sense of identity. If she's an out or a GNC lesbian, chances are she faces a lot of situations in her life where people make a point of it. That can feel really alienating. She could just be an asshole who needs a reason to feel outraged too. 

Either way, you should find things that make you happy and comfortable, and live your own truth!Who was the other lesbian artist you mentioned?"

GenderCritical,feca9p9,t3_eo541l,1578969472.0,"So is gender a costume people wear or is it an inherent attribute of the sexes? Because when GC women get upset about drag and compare it to \*blackface\* I can't not roll my fucking eyes. Marriage and feminine performance are both tools of the patriarchy to control and oppress women... oh but they're also sacred and can't be mocked because women's feelings might get hurt in the process? And gender nonconformity is fine, men shouldn't call themselves women and invade women's spaces, they should just dress how they want... unless a gay man is doing it as a part of a performance? Like I get why this is an ""AITA"" question on a personal level but is it really something that jeopardizes women's liberation?"

It scared me really bad at that age, and I get very nervous seeing obviously uncontrolled and loose pits now when I walk my own dog. Our dog was physically okay but she was leash reactive the rest of her life too, and walking her past other dogs became almost impossible for years.

 Swimming is such a great activity for young girls, it builds so much confidence and strength
Heartbreaking to think a man's feelings trump girls' access to safety, health, and body confidence. 
Most women with boys under a certain age even bring them in to female locker rooms because they know the dangers men present to ALL children.
This entire movement hates girls. I feel so sorry for this generation of children."
truelesbians,fb9mqjt,t3_ebmh50,1576642874.0,"When I was 12 I told my mom I ""didn't understand lesbians"". I think I had a pretty typical ""not like other girls"" phase that was rife w/ internalized misogyny more than homophobia and I think that delayed my understanding of my sexuality. By the time I was in high school I was very much an out and proud ""ally"" before having my first big, serious, unmistakable crush on a girl. Then it all came together"
