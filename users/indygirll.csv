Methadone,fdsvmxa,t1_fdsvd3q,1578708525.0,Ok it get it now. That makes more sense. You should be fine. Just get the script to them as soon as possible. Good luck with the job
Methadone,fdsv92p,t1_fdsullj,1578708387.0,Here we take a pic of the script and email it in. Or just wait until next time you are at the clinic and turn it in.
Methadone,fdsucez,t3_en0zgi,1578708049.0,Is your clinic  ok with it if you have script? My clinic it's a no go. If you want to stay at the clinic you have to wean off the benzos.

ChronicPain,fc0p2vn,t1_fc0oo1p,1577296286.0,"It really was. Even though she was an adult, as her mother I went full blown psycho on these people. They had security try to usher me out of the hospital. But three days later we found a compassionate pain doctor that put her on a pain pump plus methadone and other medications. And the last two weeks of her life they really kept her medicated to where she was in no pain. But no one should ever have to go through that!!"

ChronicPain,fc0hg9q,t3_efflmt,1577290925.0,Exactly what my 24 year old daughter went through when she was dying of cancer. They actually sent her to detox and tried to put her on suboxone. Thankfully we switched pain docs and got her some relief.
