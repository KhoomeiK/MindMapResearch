JustNoSO,fbyqdyd,t3_ef4snh,1577223573.0,"You won’t leave until you’re ready to leave. No matter what anyone says about leaving straight away. Until you reach the point of the straw that breaks the camels back you won’t leave. Trust me I know, I saw m mum go through this so many times but do much worse verbally and physically abused as well as my mental abuse so I know you won’t leave until you’re good and ready too. But when you do please change your number and block them on every platform your connected on. Good luck x"
