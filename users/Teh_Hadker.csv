I appreciate the episodes myself - it's a sign from my brain that I need to escape for a bit. It is my brain's way of taking care of me. As long as it's not getting in the way of the basic requirements of living, then I think it's okay. If you're missing showers and meals because of it, then it's a problem (I've had this happen to me). I try to use these periods as a learning experience - what am I escaping from? Why do I feel the need to fall into my fantasies? It's fun when you use those periods of daydreaming to talk to various aspects of yourself (see Internal Family Systems).

BTW when your mind takes on these maladaptive habits, it is more healthy to appreciate them instead of hate them. Another issue of mine is psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. To begin with, I was scared of them and wanted them to go away. Through therapy, I learned that these events were happening for a reason, and they were my brain's way of taking care of my in a subconscious way (maybe I would be suffering from severe panic attacks otherwise).

Also, about that tennis court, trust me it has not seen a day of tennis in yeeeeears. I walk there with my dogs a few times a week, and it's West Milwaukee's unofficial dog park lol, because it's completely fenced in with a high fence. Sometimes we have to wait our turn for other dog owners to get out before we can toss the ball.
