unpopularopinion,ff23sss,t1_ff20u8m,1579493030.0,"I love my dog but I’ve literally never heard of treating animals like their gods outside of looney tune people and uncommon religions. What does that mean in the context of this post? The whole “my dog is perfect and can do no wrong” thing? Because I think most of the time that’s intentional hyperbole, my dog is awesome but he definitely does stuff he knows he shouldn’t and you can tell he knows because they look guilty. 

Is it “my pet is literally my child” thing? If so even literally I don’t think anyone with kids think they are godlike, and most people I think given the choice between a random animal (even there own pet but by less of a wide margin) would choose a puppy over a child in a hypothetical life or death, again the “i would die for this animal” thing is most of the time just funny/ a meme. I don’t want kids because my dog is about the level of responsibility I’ve decided I can/want to handle at this point in life, so I’ll say he’s like my son because he’s probably the closet I’ll ever get, I’d still choose my nephew over him if they were both hanging over a cliff. 

I just don’t understand this post at all and think many who agree are taking some lighthearted sarcasm/jokes seriously. Here’s the top definition of godlike on google “resembling God or a god in qualities such as power, beauty, or benevolence”, my dog is powerful and beautiful and sometimes benevolent but he’s also derpy as hell, makes mistakes, intentionally does something wrong when he’s been taught otherwise, not like a god at all intelligence wise. He’s “pure” by some people’s definition I guess but all dogs have flaws and I honestly have never heard of any other dog owners treating their dogs “as a god” and “incapable of wrongdoing”, I think when those stories/images pop up it’s not meant to be taken seriously like 95% of the time and it’s alarming how many people don’t understand that here."

I do still like to talk with my mom like that though, hell she’s probably my best friend so I just want to let her know about exciting things and things I want to try even though I know most of the time she doesn’t understand until I explain it and it’s probably boring to her. But I let her talk about that kind of stuff too, we just have really dissimilar interests, nonfic/fiction, comedy/drama, artistically creative/likes structured art like paint by numbers so over the years we seem to have come to an unspoken agreement we both get to talk and neither of us like it when the others first reaction is negative, even if it’s dumb (“hey mom I really want to move to the most expensive city in the country without finding a job there first”, thank you mom for waiting until I calmed down a bit before going over all the glaring negatives).

Edit: (Hey u/baconballoon the second part of my comment here might give you some insight into the future, it just took a while for me to get my conversational skills to an acceptable level, but even now I just want to tell my mom about everything because I know that she’s probably the only one who’s not going to eventually reject me if I say something weird or if I talk to much. I try to be there for her in the ways she likes since she doesn’t like to talk as much as I do, I drive down to visit and take her out to dinner, try to get her cool gadgets she probably wouldn’t know about otherwise (she says her tile has saved hours of looking for lost keys and phone). We had slews of issues between us from like 11-19 but since I got out into the world and got treatment for my mental health issues she’s been my biggest supporter and I’m glad I can count on her to be there and v.v.

You and OP assume the combination of the house and reward mean they are just assholes who can afford it and don’t want to pay. But you don’t know the situation, all we can garner from this post is how OP tells it, and that he didn’t need the money, we have no way of knowing if the cat actually was stolen or ran away, no way of knowing how much $500 meant to that family, no idea if the pet scheme is a prevalent issue in their area.

The owners paid what they had on hand (the cat could have been gone for a long time, and they were just at home, personally I rarely have that much cash just sitting at home). Then offered to pay the rest, to which OP replied no, and they made a snarky comment. Like I said if it were me I’d have offered a payment plan because I’m not going to get myself sued but I’d feel a little annoyed they wanted 500 and they straight up told me they found it and brought it home without taking more than 20 minutes or so out of their day. They offered, Op rejected and then made judgments about their financial situation, then went and posted it on reddit, if it was that big of a deal (which they didn’t need the money so idk how it is) then op could have just said yeah go get the 120 I could really use it rn."
AmItheAsshole,feute29,t1_feuorlh,1579389687.0,"And my point was, especially in places where I’ve lived and it’s fairly common I wouldn’t call someone morally wrong for posting a $500 reward they can’t afford if they think it could have been stolen to either sell or get a rewards. It’s legally wrong in my state, and if they could afford it they should have paid but if my dog went missing I’d strongly consider putting the reward that high to cover all possibilities. Personally I’d have really hoped a nice person disregarded it but if not I guess I’d have to set up a monthly payment plan or risk being sued (depending on how I’m doing I could do 1-200 up front). And in this story he knew and mentioned he wasn’t hurting for the money, but he just assumed they weren’t. Imo they were technical assholes, but Op is pretty judgmental and if I were him if I accepted anything at all it would have been like 100, and I certainly wouldn’t have felt so spited for getting 320 when I’d just reunited their family, I’d be feeling pretty good about myself and not asking strangers if I’m an asshole"

With them providing a free mammogram as preventative care she found out she had breast cancer, stage 3 (I later found out she had the lump most of the time we didn’t have insurance but was too scared to get it checked out because of the cost if it was cancer). By New Years with chemo, surgery, radiation, and all the regulator doctors visits for that and her other cardiac issues, plus medications she racked up over a million dollars in 2019. And the bills aren’t even settled yet so we don’t know the grand total, or how much she will end up owing considering her lifetime maximum was a million. She says nobody has told her she’s in remission yet but she finished radiation before New Years and they are just doing checkups now, if she hadn’t had insurance cover it she (who had to quit her job and find a less stressful very part time gig because of  chemo and ongoing cardiac issues) would have been over a million in the hole without the insurance that still costs around 15k a year purely from premiums, not counting deductible. Healthcare is fucked in America.

Edit: I thought I should add part of the cardiac issues are a result of her having a heart attack while we were without insurance, we didn’t know for sure until she could afford to get one of those ekg things and the doctor confirmed it was a recent heart attack. We thought she was possibly having one, she called me complaining of chest pains so I came over and we sat up for hours on google trying to figure out if I should take her to the ER, we were both really low income at that point and had no one else who would be able to help financially so the ER has to be a life or death situation for either of us to go. We stayed up all night waiting to see if it got worse while she took aspirin as often as medically possible (women often have less immediately visible or painful symptoms than men if anyone doesn’t know) but it slowly got better so she didn’t want to go. If she had gone and gotten treatment (at min thousands of dollars IF she didn’t need surgery) her new doctor says she’d probably have suffered less damage than she did."

She said no other men unless part of a couple (she doesn’t have many close guy friends) and it would be stuff that would have me bored and uncomfortable (pedicures, brunch, crafts, etc.) so I said I’d rather not and she was cool, and I’m glad she asked. But if a close female friend had an actual bachelorette party where they were going to like an outdoor activity like at the lake and then hitting up the bars I’d definitively want to go if she asked."

AskReddit,fdjehk9,t1_fdiu97h,1578467426.0,"My mom was never a helicopter but one of her big issues is that she will turn around and tell everyone what we tell her or post it on Facebook. I saw that early on and only told her stuff I could live with if it all my relatives and her friends know about it. But my younger sister was slow to catch up, she would tell her things and then I had to jump to her defense when mom posted it on Facebook (seriously even a “becoming a women” post when she first got her period). It’s the same cycle, she publicizes a private moment, we both lay into her and (because I have all her passwords) I delete the post because all of a sudden she doesn’t know how to, and she says she won’t do it anymore, rinse and repeat. My sister is more careful now and mom comes to me like why won’t your sister tell me how life is going/take photos with no makeup on with me/tell me if she’s dating anyone and I tell her she had her chance and blew it and then rinse and repeat again when my sis won’t open up to her. God if she turns up with early onset dimensia I’d be slightly thankful that that’s the reason but imo she’s just an extreme narcissist and it’s incredibly annoying that we got half her genes yet we can still control ourselves so pretty sure she can. And she bitches about my grandma being narcissistic and (while I still do sometimes when I’m fed up) I always want to scream well the apple doesn’t fall far!!"

relationship_advice,fdjaucf,t1_fdi75vj,1578463611.0,"I don’t think he would be forced to coparent, child support yes but I can’t think of any state in the US that would force him to coparent. The child support would be for the babies own good but if he doesn’t want to raise this child should she not adopt then he shouldn’t have to. Even if she hadn’t broken consent by lying about birth control she could have/have had an abortion and there wouldn’t be a child at all who needed a parent or money at all, so he should at least have the choice to not be in the child’s life. If you would let your minor daughter have an abortion then you should let your minor son opt out of actual parenting and just pay the child support (which is the most basic level of necessity when there is a live child that you helped create) and not be involved further."
