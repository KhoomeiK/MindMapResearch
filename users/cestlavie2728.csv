depression,ffan8c7,t3_esbfsf,1579739918.0,"I think the root cause is something you said in your post. You believe you are a ""bad person""... I think you will have much more hope in life if you truly address this belief about yourself, get to the bottom of why you believe this about yourself, and what it means to you to be a good v. bad person (as different people have different ideas about what this means).

Don't give up on yourself."
MuslimMarriage,ff6pi5o,t1_ff6nqgj,1579632169.0,"Ehh. I see your point but I disagree with attributing a hierarchical structure of marriage to Islam. Subservience in exchange for money seems more like a slave-master or employee-employer relationship.

On the contrary, women in Islam are deemed equal to men. Arguing that a husband-wife relationship is the exception to this rule seems absurd to me. In what other context does equality matter more than in a spousal relationship? That is not to say the couple shouldn't divide tasks, roles, and responsibilities. But to attribute maturity with men because they are the financial providers discounts various (arguably more important relationally) aspects of maturity including spiritual and emotional maturity."

MuslimMarriage,ff3lkur,t1_ff2qhjf,1579543641.0,"I think that is her fiance's decision to make. His actions currently say he is unwilling to move forward but maybe a conversation can clarify whether he is fully done, or perhaps is willing to go slowly as they initially agreed and wait a set amount of time to find out if she will become sure. Yes it is a risk of heartbreak on his part but he gets to decide whether he wishes to take that risk.  Only Allah knows how these things play out, and couples have come back from much worse. It is worth exploring \*why\* she is unsure."

MuslimMarriage,ff1syvx,t1_ff0h5ob,1579485491.0,"According to one report, it is projected that 25% of millennials in America will probably never marry.

[https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/record-share-of-americans-have-never-married/#will-todays-never-married-adults-eventually-marry](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/record-share-of-americans-have-never-married/#will-todays-never-married-adults-eventually-marry)

Obviously it is just one report and it is not specific to Muslims.  

Still, the decline in marriage/marrying later seems to be a trend across the board, and may have to do with these ideas of seeking perfection, fear of missing out, ""not settling"" for less than we ""deserve,"" less tolerance for mistakes and hurt, less forgiveness, feeling like we are fine on our own and don't actually ""need"" marriage, shift from family/community-based society to independent society, and so forth."

But also, you lost some bad things that were in your ex and understanding that will help you move forward. Grieving the loss is accepting that there  was some good in them (otherwise you wouldn't have chosen them), but they were not who you needed them to be. Cry over the good you lost, while being grateful you no longer have to deal with the bad. Both of these feelings can coexist."
MuslimMarriage,feszxch,t3_eqc2mm,1579370515.0,"Agreed. I think this has to do with how we are brought up in the west.

BreakUps,felxjnl,t1_felwp5v,1579233459.0,"I think the only way it can be overcome is with a breakup and a mutual reunion after **a lot** of internal and external self-growth on both sides, a complete healing from the breakup, and the brain actually **forgetting** the pain of the past, such that the past doesn't leak into a new relationship with that same person. Might take years and may never happen. 

Some people may choose to wait for that to happen. They may pray everyday for years. That is their choice and I do not judge them. Who knows, it may happen one day. On the other hand it may not. 

Either way, I think these people are making a choice to forego companionship (and other benefits of a healthy relationship) for as long as it takes. That is their choice, and perhaps they dont mind seeking out happiness in other ways on their own."
BreakUps,felwld3,t1_felu567,1579232753.0,"I guess rebuilding trust is possible albeit very difficult. Sometimes it's worth it; sometimes it really isn't. For example in some cases people allow their lack of trust to transform into controlling behavior. The person on the other side has to be patient and overcome his/her fear, guilt, or other negative emotions. They have to set strong boundaries as to not allow the other person to guilt-trip them into living their life in an unwanted way, etc. The controlling person may very well want to stay together too. They may even try to be more trusting and forgive their partner's past behavior. Yet they may continue to get negative thoughts and doubts. They may try to control their thoughts through meditation, etc, and it may work sometimes. But their mind keeps playing tricks on them which manifests in negative behavior. At some point the cons of the relationship outweigh the pros."

BreakUps,fel84zy,t1_fel0uty,1579216126.0,"Hmm, well I think that's my point-- effort, commitment, and oh my, *trust* ...those things --or the lack thereof-- are part and parcel of people. 

So how could it be that *any* 2 people can work together even if they both wanted to? 

For example, some people have trust issues. Maybe those trust issues are based on a misunderstanding, or miscommunication, or a higher standard of loyalty than another person's. Nevertheless those issues are there. 

Ergo, for *any* two people to work together, one or both have to be willing to compromise certain standards and/or values. And in that case, did they really even work together at all?"

With more time and patience it *might* have worked. 

Often there is no coming back after ending things with people who romanticize and think you should have known and chose them from the start. They lose that trust in your love/loyalty.

On the flip side, from my perspective, ""how could I have known? This is a life-long decision and I'm supposed to just *know* from the beginning and make you a priority? I don't know anything about you, we met online!""

Essentially, I let my desires, rather than complete trust in Allah, rule.

islam,fd7dgz6,t3_ek6mcs,1578202763.0,"Non-Muslims suffer too. People, in general, suffer... some more than others. 

The ones who are not suffering are being tested too, in a different way. Will they help? Will they stand by idly and do nothing? May Allah help us to be of those who see something wrong and change it or at least speak against it, or at least hate it with our hearts."
BreakUps,fd79lgh,t3_ek2jo0,1578201229.0,I broke up with him almost a year ago and still cry almost every day. Breakups happen for a reason even if you wish with all your might that reason did not exist. Separation from someone you love is probably one of the most painful things on earth.

MuslimMarriage,fcyyjff,t1_fcyx7x3,1578089916.0,"It is true that sharing our sins is frowned upon in Islam. But I believe that is in the spirit of being proud/unashamed/encouraging the sin. The vibe I got from OP is more of ""I'm really at my wit's end and starting to slip"" and she posted on a Muslim forum knowing people would try to stop her because she needs encouragement to stop. Plus, it's Reddit and anonymous. Allahu a'lam."
MuslimMarriage,fcyxun5,t1_fcyxmca,1578089471.0,I don't feel like reading the whole thread. Which comment?
