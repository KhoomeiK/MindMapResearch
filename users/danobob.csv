bulletjournal,fcf7i98,t3_eh1dfy,1577627326.0,"The amount of patience and skill that this must have taken is astounding. I can barely make a straight line with a pen and a ruler let alone a brush and watercolors.

Fantastic job!!"
bulletjournal,fc7dn4s,t1_fc6yfp7,1577504337.0,"I am going to hold onto it for a little bit. Maybe just a couple years so I can look back and see how far I have come. Until then, it will be sealed shut and stuck in a box. Thank you!"
bulletjournal,fc7dcmu,t1_fc6wr8s,1577504104.0,"I'm starting a new book and since I had so many pages left, I decided to just seal the book shut and let it be. Thank you though!"
bulletjournal,fc7d994,t1_fc7296u,1577504029.0,I think 2019 was just fated to be terrible. So many people having bad years and so many bad things happened. Maybe we should just wipe it from history.
bulletjournal,fc7d0h9,t1_fc6xah6,1577503831.0,"I wish I had used more of my journal. As I was going through it, I realized just how many pages I skipped when I wanted to get a ""fresh"" start. And then I still had like 60 pages unused at the end. I really underutilized my journal this year."
bulletjournal,fc7cuji,t1_fc6vafy,1577503697.0,"I appreciate it, thank you.

I started going through some of my spreads and realized they were all simple and, when I stuck to them, they all worked alright. And I also realized how little my daily stuff actually covered stuff from my day. So I just closed the book and I'm gonna store it somewhere out of the way."
bulletjournal,fc7cm79,t1_fc7an4o,1577503509.0,Definitely starting a fresh journal for 2020. And I did label the spine. Thanks for reminding me about that! I forgot that Leuchturm includes labels with their journals.
bulletjournal,fc7cjm6,t3_egiuwc,1577503452.0,"For anyone that happens to come back to this, I decided to use the labels that Leuchturm includes with their 1917 journals to seal my bujo shut (and one to label the spine) to keep all the negativity inside."

cookingforbeginners,fc6tkf6,t3_egi40h,1577489137.0,Simplest way I know (on top of the lid method mentioned earlier) is to use the corner of the spatula to pull away part of the cooked white and let the uncooked layer above it fill in the void.
bulletjournal,fc5f74x,t3_egalfw,1577455826.0,Already looks better than mine! (I can't even figure out how to get a thin line because I always push down too hard on any pen)
bulletjournal,fc49oj9,t3_efxspg,1577410425.0,"When I saw this I couldn't help but think ""Oh cool, somebody printed out a ""title"" page to look like a fancy book title page.""

And then I scrolled and saw the shimmer of the gold pen. I am both in awe of the style and the execution. Well done!"
bulletjournal,fc49ju4,t3_eg0wqu,1577410320.0,"I feel like that little girl in Despicable Me.

IT'S SO SHINY I'M GONNA DIE!"
Infinitewarfare,f8nkyor,t1_f8nknnq,1574646548.0,"Yeah...I posted this (and posted it on r/CallofDuty)  and started thinking ""I'm putting all of this effort into trying to figure out how to get money back instead of just holding onto it and having a small box on a shelf somewhere.""

I kinda hate that my immediate reaction to this situation was ""How can I undo this?"" I even tried to see if there was some way to ""un-redeem"" the code for MWR because I wanted to sell it off later too. I don't know why I'm freaking out over this so much."
