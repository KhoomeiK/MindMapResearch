politics,feh98j3,t3_ep46f7,1579111779.0,"I blame CNN for this current shit show because of all the attention they gave to Trump prior to the 2016 campaign and election. I also believe that many older viewers abandoned CNN for Fox News because of all the celebrity-based content that they couldn't have cared less about. They may have eventually found Fox News on their own, but they probably ended up there sooner rather than later. So...fuck you, CNN! Assholes!"
