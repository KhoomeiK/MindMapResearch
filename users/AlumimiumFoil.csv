teenagers,ff0wgrd,t3_eqzb4n,1579472927.0,"I was playing Minecraft in creative mode when I was 6 at my cousin's house and he joined and summoned ghasts, zombies, skeletons, creepers, spiders and set my 'castle' that I had been building for 2 hours on fire and put lava everywhere. I screamed, chucked my tablet behind the sofa and cried when I heard the combined noises of all the mobs, especially the ghasts. That sound still gives me PTSD."
dontyouknowwhoiam,fei3wov,t1_fehra8y,1579129723.0,"That isn't in the Quran. In hadiths, it does say that homosexuality is forbidden in Islam, but it still does not permit abuse to homosexuals. This has nothing to do with the religion. It's what some people think. I'm sick of being generalized with these people just because they do disgusting things. A lot of Arabians don't condone this, but it's part of the Arabian law sadly. It shouldn't be but it is. They can claim it's Islamic, but it isn't."
dontyouknowwhoiam,fei3coz,t1_fehjwsg,1579129371.0,"No. Not really. Every Muslim, or person of any other religion, has their own culture, most likely based on their childhood experiences. Forced marriage is NOT part of Islam. It is however part of many cultures, such as Arabian culture. That isn't to say that all Arabians follow such culture. Execution of gay people is disgusting but not all Muslims feel that way. Also, the person in the post is making it sound like this is an Islam specific thing, which is definitely is not. Some Christians or people of other religions do this. This isn't about religion. Just because someone quotes a part of a religious scripture that doesn't exist, or says that it is in the name of their religion does not mean that it is. It is personal beliefs that influence actions like this. It's the same deal with terrorism, normal religious people are named terrorists by ignorant people. Anyone who kills anyone and says that it is in the name of religion isn't a true believer if said religion because literally no religion believes in murder."

I would like for it to be a subreddit dedicated to people sharing all types of music and songs that they like and a place for up and coming songwriters to come and get inspiration and feedback for songs with the help of fellow Redditors.


If I was made moderator, I would also look for others to moderate, I would not be the only moderator."
