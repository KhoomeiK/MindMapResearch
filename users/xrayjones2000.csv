There are ndi jobs out there just need the training. Good luck"

Shes bitter even though the dnc bent over backwards to deliver the nomination to her and the press crowned her. Never has a candidate gotten so much backing to lose to trump. Her hubris lost that election and should of had some real people around her who knew about electoral maps. We all have 20/20 vision on this at this point but her pulling the hit job on bernie at this point is like george lucas bitching about disney after they gave him 5bil to go away. Go count your money george and hillary, they served you a softball and you still missed. Own it and move on."

Before you lose your mind he did a great job showing his idea of unmedicated mental disease but that batman is what 8-10 yrs old. The joker is what? 30-35 yrs old. Both of them are human. It would have made more sense to have batman be in his late teens and joker be the catalyst for batman. I would have like to have seen this joker really flesh out the criminal mastermind part that wasnt touched in this one
