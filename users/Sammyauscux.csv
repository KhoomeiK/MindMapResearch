>That's why I thought small steps like the antidepressants were good. I was proud of myself.

As you should be. It's a great step. But... I have a feeling that you're living in a miserable environment. It's toxic for you and your mental health. Even though you moving out might be very scary right now, you'll see very quickly that your mental health will improve once you're out of that toxic environment.

Finish school and get a job that pays for a small place and bills and food. Moving out will be the best thing you can do for yourself."

Maybe you also should do some thinking where your goals are. If you wanna (not have to fit a short time) live in a small town eventually, you two might not be working out in the long run"

>she'd not get to spend time with me as I'll be meeting them in between too

That's kinda a red flag. Are you supposed to never meet your parents or friends or so cause you should spend 100 % of your time with her? I get not wanting to live with the in laws, but not even meeting them seems over the top"
