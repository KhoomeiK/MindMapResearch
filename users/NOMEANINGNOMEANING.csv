depression,fdurclp,t3_en5e2r,1578737771.0,"Everyone loves to self-diagnose. They give people who actually experience chronic, severe depression a bad rep. Like, no you are not depressed because you feel blue once in a while. Depression can be crippling to the point where one can't even get out of bed in the morning."
depression,fdups2s,t3_en532z,1578736956.0,"Well, I am a nihilist.  I don't believe in meaning or an afterlife. Simply put, we just are. It can be a devouring, depressing thought sometimes. I feel exactly what you are saying. We are all held hostage by the passage of time. We all are a victim of ageing and there's nothing we can do about it.  My best advice is to do what makes you happy. Don't live your life trying to please others. I mean, that's what I've been doing to cope. I've stopped thinking about life and death and have just started to accept it, because it really took a toll on me for quite a while. It's just not worth the effort anymore. Nothing you do matters, so just live however the hell you want.  I think it's very logical to think like this. You are questioning the world around you and that is not necessarily bad. I wish you the best."
depression,fdulcy0,t3_en56hb,1578734751.0,"Hey, hang in there, friend. There is nothing wrong with you or your body. Do not let other people tell you a god damn thing. Rebel. Yell at them. Call them out for judging you so intensely at 14. Express how you've been feeling. They don't actually hate you, but maybe they are having a hard time understanding and addressing how you've been feeling. If these ""friends"" treat you so poorly then I'd cut them out completely. You don't need more negativity in your life. Surround yourself with people who make you happy. You don't deserve this."
depression,fduj1vd,t3_en0xz2,1578733822.0,"That can certainly be rough, yeah. My advice would be to work on other things you can control, such as muscle mass. Women do like it when a man is in good shape, so much so that they can see past your height. Get a gym membership and at least give it a go. Start off with light weight as we all have to start somewhere. 

The fact that you want to die because you're 5'2 is kind of extreme. I'm not saying being 5'2 isn't rough, because it definitely is, but there is much more to life than women and sex. Work on *yourself* as a person and don't do it because of women but because **you** deserve a good quality of life."
depression,fduh3p3,t3_en2qbu,1578732883.0,"Yeah... Some things interest me like TV, internet, video games, exercise but I have no desire for anything else. We're all just existing really, because at the end of the day, we all move toward the same path -- death. However, there is something in the back of our minds telling us that we need to be BIGGER and better and that we are wasting our potential! I always think about the alternative to life, death, which is simply not being.  I don't waste my life conforming to others because it could be gone in an instant. Why should I live a constricted and worrisome life when I can just do what makes me comfortable?"
KingOfTheHill,fd672qd,t3_ek2uce,1578186471.0, I like how his shirt is off to emphasize their difference in size.
KingOfTheHill,fbdis0m,t3_ecgvb5,1576763376.0,I love Hank's sigh at the end lmao
