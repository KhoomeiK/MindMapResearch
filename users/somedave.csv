Edit: people replying to this are missing the point, if you win it snowballs and if you lose it just gets worse and you have no way to come back. I have played it maybe 4 times and it has been painfully obvious who was going to win half way through the game every time and who had absolutely no chance to even compete for anything but last place.

Also giving rafaam good minions isn't always that bad to you personally, you just fought him and are unlikely to immediately after if anyone is left. Unless you are confident you can win making one person more powerful is fine."
