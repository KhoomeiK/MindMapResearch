netflix,ffbaj0b,t1_ffa4tfc,1579757493.0,From the UK. This was specifically the reason I didn't own a TV and would only watch DVDs on my laptop. No TV license and no adverts.
shanghai,ffb7i0n,t1_ffaqq43,1579753957.0,It looks like the reason is that the post includes a shortened URL so when the site-wide spam filter caught it the post was removed. I've manually approved it now so the post should stay up.
coolguides,ffb4eu1,t3_esg9o2,1579751506.0,The Lief Ericcson one always bugs me. What about the people who walked in via Beringia? Didn't they discover it?
MrRobot,ffb26lb,t3_esipd7,1579749919.0,I actually guessed Mr Robot was in his head pretty much straight off but that episode still managed to completely throw me for a loop. Did not see the Darlene/father connection at all.
unitedkingdom,ffb1b3v,t1_ffacrfu,1579749324.0,Probably more like a threat then
AteTheOnion,ffao9f5,t1_fepujkz,1579740612.0,Ah right. I just assumed it would have been a private teacher or something so it wasn't obvious.
trashy,ffaln3x,t1_ffa5kdj,1579738836.0,I mean it's legal but it's not very common for non-teenagers to date 16 year olds. Even we see a 30 year old with a 16 year old we find it creepy as.
MurderedByWords,ffahocp,t3_eseax0,1579735974.0,"To be fair it's actually a pretty tough concept to get your head around. Consider the ocean. If I choose a large body of water, say, the Mediterranean Sea, and I ask where it will be in ten years I'm pretty sure that most people will be confident in their answer. But if we point to a single water molecule and ask exactly where it will be in 7 days even the world's greatest scientists wouldn't be able to tell you."
Wellthatsucks,ffag6l1,t1_ff9wl27,1579734991.0,And in the back we'll put a PS2!
startrek,ffadboq,t1_ff97iyv,1579732866.0,"To me Trek is whatever it needs to be for the writers to tell their story. It's never been consistent or strictly followed continuity, especially between series. There are the worldbuilding elements of Trek - the races, the planets, the ships, the technology, the organisations and so on. But Trek has always been adaptable, whether its a sci-fi action flick, deep morality play, political intrigue, or high-octane action. It's all Trek and it's great there are so many different types of show you can watch in the same universe."
startrek,ffa7yrc,t1_ff6hmof,1579729645.0,Pretty sure even DS9 mentions that they've always been in the shadows as well.
startrek,ffa7o3i,t3_erww35,1579729480.0,"Definitely. Roddenberry specifically didn't want internal conflict within the federation, only conflict from external sources. That being said, I don't think they're a bad addition to the franchise - I loved the Section 31 episodes in DS9."
startrek,ffa61el,t1_ff8jtpy,1579728577.0,Although I honestly would laugh my balls off if he does.
startrek,ffa5fjh,t3_es8uox,1579728240.0,Possibly? There's no way to know. I saw a couple of YT videos saying it was a massive failure (didn't actually watch them - just the titles) but I'm gonna wait until I watch it to decide. The YT videos are likely just clickbait at this stage anyway.
startrek,ffa0by4,t3_ertvxy,1579725311.0,"There are some really great episodes of Voyager but they really dropped the ball in the set up. Everything interesting about the concept was dropped in favour of doing a sub par TNG. 

That being said some of my favourite Trek is in Voyager, but it's a slog to get through."
startrek,ff9vb2y,t1_ff7wfmy,1579722268.0,Which I'm fine with. I can watch TNG any time I want. It'll be great to have something different.
startrek,ff9v1g0,t1_ff8846y,1579722076.0,"He was very private about his family life. Kirk didn't know the visiting Ambassador Sarek was his father until he was aboard the Enterprise, and it wasn't until Star Trek V that his close friends found out he had a brother."
startrek,ff9ud6w,t1_ff8hjra,1579721542.0,Exactly. Same reason the Second World War isn't called the Final World War.
shanghai,ff9t31z,t3_es7mre,1579720658.0,It might be being held for some reason. I had a similar problem where a package I sent to the UK was held because the address wasn't correct. Had to make several phone calls to finally get it delivered.

unitedkingdom,ff9mvlc,t3_es9b0n,1579716324.0,"We once had neighbours that weren't the greatest - they'd have mad parties while their kids and pets were upstairs. They kept it to weekends at least so it wasn't terrible for us but we'd worry a little about the kids. 

They had two cats that would often come visit us. The neighbours knew and didn't mind and we never had any intention of stealing them. 

One day after their female cat had a litter she showed up at the window carrying one of the kittens. It was just me and my sister in  (we were 17 and 15) and we didn't really know what to do so we opened the window. She ran in, went straight to my sister's bedroom and dumped the kitten under her bed. Then she went back home an showed up with the second one. Eventually she was happy under my sister's bed with all her kittens.

Obviously it was chaotic when the neighbours and our mother got home. We did the right thing and returned the cat. Ended up taking one each of the litter as our first pets.

But I always think about the fact that she clearly didn't like her owners and wanted to move into our place."
unitedkingdom,ff9lkq6,t1_ff8woyq,1579715554.0,Well it makes sense - they're using that money to build cheap housing for those who need it. Right?
Minecraft,ff9aoaa,t3_es3414,1579708658.0,No idea but it's easy to fix - just dig everything out and replace it with what should be there.

unitedkingdom,ff85ivn,t1_ff7qmdr,1579666564.0,It's called stalking and harassment. Unless you're famous then it's just paparazzi.
Tinder,ff3u7zl,t1_ff2vw0u,1579548956.0,I know a guy who's a bit not right in the head. Legally changed his name to Elvis Presley and goes to the local bar to do karaoke versions of Elvis songs. He does the Elvis dance a lot. He technically gets more gigs than this guy.
marvelstudios,ff2pzvp,t3_er3kf0,1579518676.0,What's this from?
badwomensanatomy,ff2crm0,t3_eqyxez,1579500961.0,This seems like a joke about animated shows like Batman TAS and its ilk
godtiersuperpowers,ff2cgm4,t1_ff0u9vq,1579500642.0,Not quite. They steal the semen from women then shapeshift into men and rape a woman to spread the infected seed. Funnily enough they would often disguise themselves as priests and visit nunneries.
godtiersuperpowers,ff2cba5,t3_eqzsx1,1579500493.0,Have you actually read up on those demons? You do not want these guys to visit you.
marvelstudios,ff29lh4,t3_eqzqyw,1579497875.0,Zemo was Special Ops. It's mentioned in the film.
marvelstudios,ff277mv,t1_ff26zs8,1579495784.0,More just bloat. You can't put everything in every movie. It works in Dr Strange because they have time to explain it.
marvelstudios,ff26ztm,t1_fexah5n,1579495602.0,The only one willing to make a sacrifice other than Thanos was Doctor Strange. And it pays off in Endgame when Tony realises what he needs to do.
marvelstudios,ff24gf1,t1_ff1vi2r,1579493541.0,Also would probably have lost half the audience who wouldn't know what the hell is happening.
AmItheAsshole,ff20n3n,t1_fes4bet,1579490647.0,I'm a little more on the fence here because this purity bullshit is preached to children and can have a devastating affect on their romantic lives in the future. I kinda feel it needs to be called out publicly but then I do see your point as well.
HarleyQuinnTV,feyobtm,t3_ek704b,1579448206.0,I loved 8 Simple Rules but couldn't stand Big Bang Theory. The thing that surprises me most is that her voice acting is sooooo good. It sounds amazing and her delivery is on point. I think she's my favourite Harley Quinn so far.
HarleyQuinnTV,feyc7b7,t1_femwh6d,1579443619.0,"> Although it seems like that was either a lie or there's a more long term plan at play here.

Abusers often try to isolate their victims. If Joker has realised that Ivy is Harley's support structure it makes sense that he would try and drive a wedge in that relationship."
HarleyQuinnTV,feybwrh,t3_equ79w,1579443475.0,"I think the showrunners want to do it, but they're avoiding it for season one because they want to focus on Harley finding herself as the main plot."

videos,feuur8y,t1_fet9pib,1579390147.0,Goatse is referenced in so many video games. It's basically a tradition at this point. Even Zelda references it.
marvelstudios,feukhjh,t3_eqmcmz,1579387368.0,"Because they are entertaining as fuck and really well put together. AoS is the best SciFi on TV, and the Netflix series are (mostly) extremely well done.

Skip Inhumans though. That show deserves to be forgotten."
marvelstudios,feujl9a,t1_feuh45j,1579387151.0,"I was surprised how heartbreaking that was even though it was obvious Spidey would be back. Tom Holland really sells the desperation and sense that he's failed Tony, and you really see the guilt weighing on Stark as he fades away."
marvelstudios,feuiygw,t3_eqjrlc,1579386936.0,"I just clocked onto something. Strange was searching so many timelines because he was looking for one where Tony doesn't die. He couldn't find one. No matter what, the only way they could win is if Tony sacrifices himself. When he says ""there was no other way"", he's not apologising for letting Thanos win.

He's apologising because he's chosen a timeline where Tony is sacrificed."

Fake degrees were fairly common before this, now it's virtually impossible to fake them. I know a lot of people here on gap years as well. It hasn't crushed the problem of dodgy companies employing people on tourist visas though (something I don't recommend people do)."

AmItheAsshole,fequbyr,t1_fep8wg7,1579346053.0,Also OP went out of her way to make sure that she got something all the kids could eat. The only reason Perry was 'left out' was because his own mother made it basically impossible to know his dietary restrictions in time.

MorbidReality,fek3hgg,t1_fejpkpi,1579191818.0,Watch a documentary or two about this. It was 100% caused by a lack of crowd control due to the police not doing their jobs properly. This has been proven in a court of law now and the people responsible are being charged with unlawful killing. You have no idea what you are talking about.
