OSUOnlineCS,ff2ew25,t1_ff1lgla,1579503251.0,make sure your HW grades are good and you'll be fine. At least last semester there was no midterm and the final was 20%. Which made it extremely hard not to pass.

television,fegtlne,t1_fegkaef,1579102241.0,And it's very heavy on the typical Starz titties for titties sake shit that they are known for. But it pretty quickly gets past that and really becomes something special. Great show that just kept getting better and better

television,fc1etd5,t1_fc0ifvu,1577316627.0,No. I don't know for certain but I believe the second season is going to be off Earth. So a large amount of the cast will be new.

freefolk,fbzbmpq,t1_fbzb29a,1577241313.0,As long as the actor portrays the character well who cares. And she's white/Indian. Not really a big departure. Some people are just really sensitive about anyone else getting representation I guess. She's a dark haired babe. Works for me.
