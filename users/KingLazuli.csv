Bayonetta,ff846w7,t3_es5d92,1579665528.0,"Jubileus is the rule of Paradiso and a god. There are 3 planes of existence in Bayonetta: inferno (where demons live), paradiso (where angels live) and purgatorio. (Theres also the physical plane, where humans live). Jubileus has the following of the lumen sages who worship her as their god. Shiba is the god of the underworld. They are both gods, as in there are multiple gods for the bayonetta universe. The people who call Jubileus ""the creator"" are people who worship her, ie angels and the lumen sages. They see her as their god. Since the angels despise the umbra, saying ""May Jubileus grace you"" is like saying ""go to hell""."

tumblr,fe5x91h,t3_enouz3,1578876983.0,"These sorts of arguments come up all the time in linguistics for words changing. The idea that, somehow, a historical meaning to a word mediates its meaning. Which is wrong because words like navy are extremely detached from their historical origin so they don't have the meaning they did to speakers today as they once did. This is a normal example of linguistic change. Once the meaning slowly erodes to mean something else (in this case something like 'darker') we can reapply this new world in broader contexts. The best was we can see that is, although the use of navy red was contested, there was little ambiguity about what it meant. So, inherently, we understood it differently and so thats evidence that it means something different than ""navy ships"" or whatever to speakers today."
