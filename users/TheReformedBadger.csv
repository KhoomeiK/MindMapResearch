There’s a lot of reasons that I personally don’t support the death penalty, but  There is consistency in holding a pro life position to protect the innocent while supporting the death penalty *for those who have committed egregious crimes*

Edit: to respond to the edit, I (and I’m sure the others in this thread) have a great deal of sympathy towards mothers who find themselves at a point where they see abortion as necessary.  Pregnancy is difficult.  Labor can be traumatic. Raising kids takes a lot of self sacrifice.  There’s plenty of room for forgiveness for mothers, but that doesn’t change the fact that death is the just earthly penalty, and anything less than that is received by grace.  What we’re talking about here is saving millions of innocent lives, and that may result in those who are not innocent putting themselves in dangerous situations.   Rather than justifying their abortions, the effort should be on preventing them."

CFB,ff93jvz,t1_ff80wc7,1579703982.0,"It's not an annuity.  It's a cash value life insurance policy where Harbaugh is making a 2 million dollar contribution every year for 7 years. When contributions end, the maintenance on the account will likely be sustained through dividends paid out on the cash value.  The $2M/year payments come to Harbaugh in the form of a 0% interest $14M loan paid out in $2M yearly installments.  The repayment of the loan is due upon Harbaugh's death, which would trigger the death benefit (which would be much more than $14M) and the estate would pay the university $14M out of the death benefit to repay the loan.  At no point will he have to pay income tax on the funds. Even an inheritance tax would not apply because the funds would be an un-taxed insurance death benefit.

In the meantime Harbaugh can draw from the account by either withdrawing cash (as long as he doesn't withdraw so much that the death benefit drops below 14M) or taking a loan against the cash value.  I believe I read an analysis on it that said that from age 68-98 he could draw 1.4M/year out of the policy completely tax free.

It's a really clever tax avoidance trick and Harbaugh won big with this contract

Edit: Actually he'd have to pay tax on imputed interest, which is the interest that he would have paid if they had set the loan at the IRS minimum interest rate.  Probably a couple hundred thousand, which is pennies based on what he would have to pay of this benefit was paid out as salary."

Bible,ff2ac4e,t1_ff1ybe4,1579498554.0,"This answer is completely devoid of the grace found throughout scripture and does not answer OPs question.

If you follow this advice for your salvation you will end up in hell like the Pharisees in Matt 23:7.  Like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but are full of the bones of the dead. After all, No one is righteous, no not one  (Romans 3:10). And being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. (Romans 10:3) It is by grace that we have been saved, this is not our own doing (Ephesians 2:8-9)

Salvation comes not by the righteousness of the sinner, but by the righteousness of Christ.  To be saved all one must do is believe in Jesus Christ (Acts 16:30) In doing so Christ’s righteousness is imputed to you (Romans 3:22) and you can then be justified before God as a righteous man. (Gal 2:17)

The primary focus of Ezekiel 18 is to address errant teaching in Israel that a son will be held accountable for the sins of his father, (Ezekiel 18:2) which is not just and not how God responds to our parents sin.  Ezekiel goes on to address the different scenarios wherein an individual is condemned by his sin and absolved in his repentance.  But there’s a problem with relying on this for your salvation: we will always continue to sin.  There is none can who say that they are without sin. (1 John 1:8) it is our nature to return to it. If we rely on our own works for our salvation we are doomed. This viewpoint ends in the constant fear of whether you’ve done enough, whether you’ll die at the wrong time after a small slip up. It has a view of sin that does not fully acknowledge the true depths of our depravity.

Now to the actual question /u/instant_smack asked:
The idea of once saved always saved is one that can be correct or incorrect depending on what is meant by the phrase.  There is not one Christian who will not be raised up on the last day (John 6:40).  In this we can have assurance because none can take us from the hand of the father (John 10:29). But beware, there is such a thing as a false convert: one who proclaims Christ outwardly but has not placed his faith I God. It is this person who will hear the words “Depart from me, I never knew you” (Matt 7:23) We must examine ourselves (1 Corinth 13:5) and see that that we are producing fruit (Matt 7:17). We must examine our election (2 Peter 1:10) and work out our salvation with fear and trembling (Phil 2:13) because it is possible to deceive ourselves into thinking we believed when we were never saved to begin with (1 John 2:19) If we do not bear fruit; if our faith is not accompanied by works it is dead. (James 2:17) It is a sobering thing to confront the possibility that your faith is not genuine, but it is a practice that drives us to repentance and has the ability to provide great assurance."

Even if you didn’t know them well, most people are willing to put in a good word for someone they’ve met. People like feeling connections so the hiring manager might be warmer to you if you know someone from the company.

**Accept connection requests from recruiters**.  Even if you’re not looking at a specific job they’re asking about, they will always be posting more opportunities.  Some of these companies just want your info so they can boast to companies about how many candidates  they have in their portfolio, and some are actually trying to hire you.  It’s worth dealing with the crap companies to find the one that’s actually going to get you interviews.

**Use the LinkedIn job posting features.**. They’re a million times better for getting real jobs and not irrelevant spam like other sites *cough* zipreceuiter *cough*.  Companies who post on LinkedIn will actually be considering your application.  I conducted a job search back in May and applied to 5 jobs.  All 5 interviewed me.
