relationships,ff6mr9j,t1_ff6iba0,1579630515.0,"To preface it, the threesome itself was really hot.

It was my then bf's idea. I was always intrigued and I had a male acquaintance that had a bit of a crush on me. I asked him and he was all too eager to say yes. He was good-looking, and my then bf was really good-looking. We were psyched.

It was so erotic and hot that night, we did it again the following night for hours. Pitch-hitter guy (let's call him Kyle) Kyle was hard all night.

It all sound amazing, right?Except Kyle was a little too into me, he basically bogarted me the second night. Bf took noticed but didn't say anything till the next day when we were talking about it (after Kyle left) He thought I was a little too into Kyle. We practiced safe sex and he had me every which way multiple times. I tried to explain that we were all caught up in the moment of it, and that I really wasn't into Kyle. I loved my bf.

In the days after Kyle tries to communicate with me more, and he admitted to  me that he would want more than anything for me to ride his face till I spray all over his mouth again. I told him we should stop talking after that.

Trust issues started to really become a problem. Bf thought I wanted every good-looking guy in our circle of friends and I got tired of defending myself. To be honest, I started to wonder about other guys at that point because I felt myself pulling away from my bf.

We broke up about 3 months after that."

I hear a lot of blame. Blame on your father. Blame on your lack of a positive male role model growing up.

I'm glad therapy has helped you. Therapy has helped me too. Not having people in your life that you feel safe to confide in means that you kept a lot inside. I don't know how open you are with your therapist but I do feel for you if you have to journey through this alone.

Here's the thing. I think it helps to let go of the fact that you had a less than an ideal upbringing. I know a number of guys with pretty horrible people for fathers and they're doing ok in life and relationship. Even people who grew up without a father present in their lives, they're finding their way.

I'm not saying this to make you feel bad. I think it can feel justified to have someone or something to blame for whatever is crappy in our lives. And I'm no way saying that having a horrible role model of a dad didn't have an effect on you. Surely it did.

I grew up in a family that didn't show a lot of love. We NEVER hugged, NEVER kissed or had soothing, comforting talks. When the person I loved the most, the person who was more mother to me than my mother - my grandmother passed away, my parent announced it to my siblings and I without emotions. I blanked out. To this day, I carry that loss in my heart.Somehow, someway I became me. I am emotional. I have tears I am not afraid to cry. I have a great desire to connect with another. I am not cold or uncaring. I have a big, loud love and I can't hide it.

OP, I invite you to let that part of you go. If you've grown from your old ways then I applaud you.

I am sorry it cost you a great love.I understand you want to reconnect. Myself, I am still struggling with forgiveness so like you, I am trying to let go.

Whatever happens with your ex, keep going the direction that is right for you. Keep bettering you, do the things that make you feel good. You can only move on when you're not holding on.

I hope it all works out for you."

Mine like to start at 4am'ish and I normally have to get up at 5:30am so it can be rough. If I leave him in the bedroom with me, he starts playing with my hair around 4am, which wakes me the heck up.

I was lost and aimless. I was in a stage of disbelief for a long time after that. My chest and back broke out in hives. Insomnia was no longer something that happened to other people. I became a proper insomniac. 
My friends were a big part of the glue that held me together. 

I did a lot after my world crumbled. I rebounded, went out all the time, did things that were first for me, travelled. I did a lot of things I can’t say here. I walked and walked many Saturdays after therapy to nurse my thoughts. It felt as if I was walking the earth. 

The weekend after my breakup, I was sitting at a Parisian cafe with one of my best friends. I said something into the breeze that stirred my hair - What am I supposed to do now? I wondered into my friend’s coffee. 

There were no answers. Well, answers that I wanted to hear anyway. 

In a weird way I felt born again. I had to relearn a lot of things. Things that felt basic. To breathe without sighing. To be vulnerable again. 

I did eventually heal. 

And I look back at those years as formative ones. 

As they say, its in the cracks that light shine through. There is truth in that.

Even when there weren't any abuse involved, anger still can have its place. For example, one can be angry that they were hurt by the other person. Or, they can be angry at life that their relationship didn't work out.

Anger, in and of itself is not problematic. Its when anger is not expressed or is turn inward. From that you get rage, or depression.

Hate is tricky.Some people think you have to hate the ex in order to move on. But hate is not the opposite of love. You can bond in hate. Hate will keep you stuck.

ExNoContact,fdqjbqv,t3_emq7mu,1578668071.0,"Girl here.

I will never understand the concept of getting someone back from doing no contact.

Maybe it works with some guys?

Thinking back on some of my ex-bfs, most of them did try to come back into my life. So maybe there is something to that.I think that time and space IS absolutely needed after a relationship ends.

But I think the fatal flaw with doing no contact with girls (I believe. Or, at least this girl) If you do it for weeks and weeks, she is going to give up, lose interest, or is otherwise on her way to being over you.

I read somewhere no contact should be around 30 days.

If someone goes crickets on me for 30 days, they can keep on going. I say this without any snark.

A girl who harbors ANY hope of getting back together is not going to respond to no contact. She may respond to you giving her some time off to cool the resentments, THEN you work on talking to her to work out whatever is wrong. No contact in this case will just make it that much clearer she did the right thing by leaving you. No contact will just piss her off in this case.

I almost never comment about no contact, but I just feel the need to say this.
