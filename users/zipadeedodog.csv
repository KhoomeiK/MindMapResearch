I like this one best, but is it really in the Bible?"
AskReddit,fdu4dct,t3_en45r2,1578727323.0,"Was just thinking about this this AM. The only part of the Bible that was supposedly written by God himself (using His own finger) was the Ten Commandments, when He provided the stone tablets to Moses. Everything else in the Bible is hearsay when it comes to God's wishes/instructions.

That said, I don't agree with all the Ten Commandments:

1. *Thou shalt have no other gods before me.* Seems pretty shallow of an omnipotent being, no?

2. *No graven images or likenesses.* WTF cares? 

3. *Not take the Lord's name in vain.* Sounds like the Lord is the one that's vain.

4. *Remember the Sabbath.* Whatever.

5. *Honor thy father and thy mother.* Now we're starting to get somewhere. Honoring your parents is a sign of respect, and respect is necessary in a civilized world

6. *Thou shalt not kill.* Best commandment of them all, right here.

7. *Thou shalt not commit adultery.* Understandable, mostly. Kinda like stealing.

8. *Thou shalt not steal.* The second best commandment.

9. *Thou shalt not bear false witness.* Don't lie, got it.

10. *Thou shalt not covet.* This is an odd one. Want is what drives us, be it food or shelter or clothes or the latest video game or the neighbor's hot wife. How or why wouldn't you desire something? Nothing would ever get done without want.

Seems only half of the commandments are worthy. I can think of better ones."

Problem was, when the Soviets left, the radicalization had taken root. Before, Kabul was a much more open society, esp for women, where more liberal ideas and lifestyle was more welcome.

Sort of the same for Iran. The US backed the Shah when the general population wanted his corrupt ass gone. That opened to door to revolution and - if not radical, at least more fundamental - Islam   walked right in.

Isis was largely a US creation, too. By attacking Iraq and ridding the country of Saddam Hussain, a power vacuum formed. Enter Isis and their radical beliefs.

The US backs Saudi Arabia in just about every way. Wahhabism is some radical, harsh stuff.

Central to Christianity is love. Love your neighbor. In Islam, the focus is not on love, it is on obedience. Easier to radicalize someone who is told to obey the word of the Prophet above all else.

""Army Engineer Hisato Yoshimura conducted experiments by taking captives outside, dipping various appendages into water, and allowing the limb to freeze.[47] Once frozen, which testimony from a Japanese officer said ""was determined after the 'frozen arms, when struck with a short stick, emitted a sound resembling that which a board gives when it is struck'"",[48] ice was chipped away and the area doused in water, limbs brought close to fire and other ""methods"" used to determine the effect it had on frostbite. The effects of different water temperatures were tested by bludgeoning the victim to determine if any areas were still frozen. ""

After the war, all Unit 731 research was secured by the US Army and no prosecutions of Unit 731 doctors was allowed. In fact, the doctors were paid off by the US Army. Hisato Yoshimura went on to become one of Japan's most honored medical school leaders/doctors.
