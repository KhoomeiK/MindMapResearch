Most addicts going through recovery will transfer their addiction to something else, for her it‚Äôs food. If she‚Äôs in recovery right now there is no way she should be in a new relationship, particularly with someone who also struggles with addiction. This is a really easy way to not only foster codependency but also to totally sabotage her own recovery and your friends. I have no advice here, but keep an eye out because this sounds like a situation that can only get worse without a significant change."

askgaybros,fdfm15w,t3_el0k9g,1578364821.0,"I started shaving my head at 24 too. For awhile I thought I could still grow it out but the reality of my scalp situation kept knocking, and eventually I had to open the door and deal. Some advice/words of warning: having less hair is way more upkeep than having a full head. To keep yourself looking clean cut you‚Äôll likely need to shave twice a week at least. Some guys like to use a trimmer and just keep it buzzed, but in my opinion it‚Äôs way sexier when you wet shave, and it feels way nicer to the touch (and you can use it to touch a lot üòâ). I like to use Harry‚Äôs razors, they stay sharp for a long time and are super comfortable to use. Make sure to shave when you get out of the shower, and if you can get a shaving brush definitely do it. It gets the cream under the hairs and prevents drag. Make sure to use a good aftershave/witch-hazel to prevent razor burn because when it‚Äôs your whole head it is very noticeable. Also now that you won‚Äôt have a hairline, your scalp kind of becomes an extension of your face, so you‚Äôll want to do skincare on it the same way you would your face. Good luck man, and don‚Äôt worry, bald dudes are very sexy. üòÅ

He‚Äôs clearly a pretty isolated person having a difficult time and the fact that a couple of relatively healthy and happy people enjoy mocking him is super gross. They‚Äôre basically bullying him at this point.
fatlogic,fcup7ji,t3_eizru1,1577985733.0,"It may not be the empathy approach but I 100 percent don‚Äôt care about what anyone else is doing with their diet, like if you want to eat a large pizza every day for the rest of your life it doesn‚Äôt matter to me at all.

EDAnonymous,fco5ee3,t3_ei4d8j,1577824407.0,I feel like pretty much anyone that has put on excess weight (not including from a medical condition) has some kind of eating disorder. It might not be manic/obsessive or dysmorphia based but I think there‚Äôs always a psychological aspect to eating more than you need. A lot of people don‚Äôt think of being obese/overeating as an eating disorder because it‚Äôs so common.
