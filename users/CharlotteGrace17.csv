AskReddit,ff4scex,t3_erdojr,1579571270.0,PLEASE.  PLEASE STARBUCKS.  PLEASE.
FuckYouKaren,ff1wsed,t3_er34a9,1579487964.0,Bahahahahah!  Best response ever!  Cabbage.  Still laughing.  And i love cabbage.
AmItheAsshole,ff1umu3,t3_er1e4a,1579486560.0,What are you going to do if your herb garden explodes with new growth and it actually produces better tasting product?  Just curious...
AmItheAsshole,ff02g6z,t1_feus5pl,1579464474.0,Wow.  I just try to do the right thing.
AmItheAsshole,fezznm3,t3_eqwol3,1579463614.0,*He's the asshole.  Period.*
AmItheAsshole,fetmpma,t3_eqi79c,1579376938.0,"ESH.

Hold up.  You specifically called yourself ""crazy cat people"".  Would you have returned the cat if there was no reward?

They should have OFFERED you the reward; you should have refused it and been happy with getting the kitty back to it's people."
AmItheAsshole,fethan4,t3_eqh8mh,1579375467.0,"NTA.  We really DO get to pick our family.  She wasn't a part of yours.  (I really, really, really liked your explanation of how she lived in the same city as you when she ""got dead"")."
AskReddit,fefepec,t3_eojqln,1579054739.0,Harry Bosche.  Because what has been done...
AmItheAsshole,fefdhce,t3_eoojak,1579053969.0,"Ahhh...what?

My first OB was a guy, who was married with a gazillion children.  His wife schooled him in the pain of child birth.  I am eternally grateful."
TrueOffMyChest,fef5uwd,t3_eoje0h,1579048897.0,"Dude.  You sound like someone I'd want to be friends with.  You SHOULD be incredibly proud of who you are - I'm proud for you.  (Yes, I mother EVERY ONE).  Here's the thing:  You KNOW in the deepest darkest parts of your very soul that you are a good person that will conquer the world.  You DO get to pick your family, and your tribe."
badwomensanatomy,febzzt7,t1_fdyuvsd,1578964767.0,You were very punny.  Well done.
running,febzwr3,t3_eobwji,1578964733.0,"Breathing and core strength.  I had TERRIBLE side stitches, especially each time after pregnancy.  Breathe deep and press your closed fist into the spot when you are running while exhaling slowly."
badwomensanatomy,fdxzikg,t1_fdsfpam,1578774510.0,Nice.  That made me laugh.
AmItheAsshole,fdx4e7x,t3_en0zfr,1578765213.0,"While I agree with your initial position, I think you opted to be TA when you revoked her license.  I think this has more to do with the mom that the daughter, and what you did can not be undone.  This is going to cause major long term relationship issues with both your daughter and your ex."
badwomensanatomy,fdsa27b,t1_fdrpi43,1578697825.0,The talent would lie within splinter prevention.  A fortune could be made.

aww,fdius1f,t1_fdfuuz0,1578451503.0,Bahahahahahahah! That's freaking hilarious!
aww,fdiur9m,t1_fdftpii,1578451490.0,"yeah, agnurse - that would have been sarcasm...I know, I know, it's an acquired taste."
aww,fdfph57,t3_ekz4u8,1578367083.0,Wait.  What?  WTF?  Who has that many naked cats?  Is it a cat porno that has been cross posted?
AmItheAsshole,fdfoydh,t3_el2ls9,1578366741.0,"NTA.  If you aren't having more babies, and want to feel better about yourself, go for it.  It is your body.  If you are doing it FOR YOU, then no one should be able to make you feel guilty about it.  Self-esteem is important - no one knows what goes on in your own brain when you see yourself in the mirror...you do you, girl."
menwritingwomen,fcvvs5z,t3_ej3udn,1578011213.0,"Really?  That's what you honed in on?  ""Her ankles were delicate, and her feet-with the toenails neatly pruned-were perfect enough to suit any pediphile.

That right there belongs on /facepalm."
AmItheAsshole,fcvow1i,t3_eizcvf,1578006785.0,"I think your cousin and her husband are the entitled ones here.  Asking - or expecting - someone else to watch your kids so they can go have fun - and then thinking you are the ridiculous one for standing your ground - says it all.  You go, girl.  Way to have your life together."
badwomensanatomy,fclp0bs,t3_ehkaxv,1577752978.0,I disagree.  I think she wrote that pretty well.  Imagine being that young with boobs that big!
peopleofwalmart,fbcc60r,t3_ecg3op,1576720559.0,I've never seen back boobs before.
