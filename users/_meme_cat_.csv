StarWars,fehyj49,t1_fehy5en,1579126444.0,Just stating my opinion. But I guess you can't do that on Reddit without getting downvoted.
StarWars,fehvikh,t1_fehvdgw,1579124700.0,I still stand by my word u retarded crouton
StarWars,fehv9gs,t1_fehdl3t,1579124555.0,"Yeah. Its star wars, we should love it for what it is, not hate it for what it is not. I liked all the movies, but some scenes were bad, but the good outweighed the bad.  The sequels are good in their own way. Just like the prequels and the originals."
depression,fegj6hy,t1_fefwqyu,1579094402.0,"Autism? Yeah, most definitely not. I mean I am very outgoing and dramatic, but that's what I do. It's just my personality, I like to make people laugh make telling stupid jokes or whatever. If I did have autism, my parents would suspect already because they know how dramatic I am. Also, it would have come up already. I am pretty smart, and that doesn't mean I have high-functioning autism either."
