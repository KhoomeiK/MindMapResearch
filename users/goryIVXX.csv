Bible,femuso3,t3_epy5s5,1579270173.0,"I really love how scripturaly sound and biblically grounded this sub is. Thank you all and may the Father bless you all. 

When it comes to faith and works, I like the term *believing loyalty*... belief, trust, faith - these are the very first works we must do. Once we've realized and accepted and welcomed Christ's grand superiority; He reveals His Spirit to us, so we may be comforted and confident in our battle of repentance. I always go back to Abram when this question pops up. Genesis 12 opens after Abram had already left Ur, and his father Terah just died in Haran. The Lord tells Abram, leave the land of your fathers and follow Me (basically). Abram's ""work"" of righteousness was his believing loyalty. 

Genesis 15:6 esv - And he believed the LORD, and He counted it to him as righteousness. 

Psalm 40 is my favourite psalm, one of my favourite chapters of the entire bible even. 

Psalm40 esv (sorry for not sharing the whole psalm, I'm tryna make a point)- 

1I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.

3He put a new song in my mouth,
a song of praise to our God.
Many will see and fear,
and put their trust in the LORD.

4Blessed is the man who makes
the LORD his trust,
who does not turn to the proud,
to those who go astray after a lie!

6In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,
but you have given me an open ear.
Burnt offering and sin offering
you have not required.

9I have told the glad news of righteousness 
in the great congregation;
behold, I have not restrained my lips,
as you know, O LORD.

10I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;
I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation;
I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness
from the great congregation.

12For evils have encompassed me
beyond number;
*my iniquities* have overtaken me,
and I cannot see;
they are more than the hairs of my head;
my heart fails me.

13Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me!
O LORD, make haste to help me!

17As for me, I am poor and needy,
but the Lord takes thought for me.
You are my help and my deliverer;
do not delay, O my God!

Amen! Peace be with you all!"

If you're truly passionate for the Lord, church and bible study could be a treatment for your social anxiety. You have been called to assemble with fellow imagers of God, together, expanding the kingdom by spreading the good news. Moses was also socially awkward. And even after the Lord Himself came to Moses, he was still skeptical that he was up to it. But we all know how that worked out. And Moses did it on faith alone, on believing loyalty.

26He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

Priscilla is never mentioned *after* aquila. 

Acts 18:1-3 esv, when the couple is first mentioned, is the only time aquila is named first.

1After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

2And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them,

3and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
