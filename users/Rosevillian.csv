I mean, that is my only point and you seem to agree. Of course she was qualified to be a Senator, I am not denying that, many many people are, but few make it. 

To deny that it is very unlikely she would have made it without name recognition is to deny American politics at its core, which is what I am arguing *against.* Futilely, of course. 

I mean Bush was qualified, as was Jeb, but neither would have made it as far as they did without senior. It's the same thing, and gross. I wish we could move past high school levels of politics as Americans, but it is just where the mass of the populace wants to be."

Not that she isn't qualified *now,* but that is the only reason for her qualifications. It's stupid.

One of the weirder things in American politics. Senators *wives* filling in seats for them after they die? Fuck off with that shite. Bush, Bush II, Jeb Bush, fuck even the Roosevelts and the Kennedys.

My guess is since reddit skews heavily towards Americans, they see reunification as a repudiation of British colonialism. 

Again, it is just a guess, but many think that Northern Ireland should never have been kept by England in 1921, especially considering that when the island was originally conquered there were no ""unionists"" in NI, they all came after like English carpetbaggers. 

Many Americans side with the IRA in the troubles, and believe that a unified Ireland is the culmination of that struggle. 

Not that any of us are right about it, but I believe that is where the hardon comes from. 

Of course let the people of NI vote for what they want, and the republic if they want as well. Shouldn't preclude outsiders from having their own opinion, yeah? Like I personally think Brexit is about the stupidest thing I have ever heard the UK doing. Y'all still get to do what you want, but my opinion isn't going to be neutral.

If representatives in the House were fully proportional to population *as it was when they were capped* the entire system would be absolutely workable. 

The Senate gives smaller states a full voice and the House represents the entire population. The problem being, of course, that some districts can be upwards of 900k citizens per representative and some districts as low as 500k per representative. This can be a problem in the electoral college since there are one elector for each member of the House and Senate, and three for the DC. 

Yeah, a complete re-vamp away from FFTP and towards direct vote would be better, however just fixing the proportions could eliminate this crazy losing the popular vote and winning the Presidential election.

Kinda weird you want to imply Bill is a sicko but overlook all the evidence of Trump being one. 

I say fry them both.

I honestly wish they had removed Bill for lying. Gore would have had a much better chance to beat a hanging chad as in incumbent."

Goddamn, he's a fucking badass. 

Don't forget when Obama put the smackdown on Osama. 

Oh yeah, neither of those things happened. 

The fine members of our military should get the credit for any military win. (and the ISIS one isn't the full story, anyway, sorry. They were besieged from all sides and couldn't hold out. Hell even Syria and Iran were against them.)"

>Soros is hardly a jew

My head is spinning. Let's try and unpack this. 

First off, no one said you were antisemitic. You were accused of being a conspiracy theorist which usually leads to (((soros staffer))) or similar which just means a Jewish person Illuminati or somesuch. 

Secondly, you can definitely be antisemitic and Jewish. Not that you are, of course, because there is absolutely no way you are Jewish. Zero chance. 

Thirdly, the new attack on Soros is that he isn't *really* Jewish so it's not antisemitic to criticize him. Honestly, it isn't automatically antisemitic to criticize any Jewish person or institution. It is, however, antisemitic to *discount that a Jewish holocaust survivor is actually Jewish.*"
