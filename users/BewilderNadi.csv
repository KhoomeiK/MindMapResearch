YTA. So, so hugely YTA. I pity your husband, friends, and family. 

Work on yourself or you will never be happy. 

My god. Reading all of this was just painful."
wholesome,ffaumps,t3_eshiq5,1579744870.0,As far as I know the truth is actually that the cat raised lynx when it was an orphaned cub. Which is just as cool tbf lol.
AskReddit,ffa5ysg,t3_esijbl,1579728538.0,"I'll be taking her (I think it's a her) to the vet/cat sanctuary tomorrow, but what should I call her while I have her? 

She's a tiny tortoise shell, and very friendly. 

I've just been calling her ""puss"" or ""hey there"" and I feel bad..."
cats,ff9vxna,t3_esh28z,1579722682.0,"He/she (I think she) came straight to me and was nervous, but very friendly. She looks young, maybe 5 months old or so, and EXTREMELY skinny. 

Her legs/tail are stick thin and the end of her tail looks like it's been damaged and has been healing a while. I also think she may have a small eye infection but doesn't seem too bothered by it. 

I brought her home, she seems very comfortable to be in a house. So far she's wolfed down a pouch and a half of food, biscuits and still wants more, but I don't want to feed her too much at once (surprised she hasn't thrown up already tbh haha). 

But she seems okay, and she's now sleeping in a homemade cat bed next to me. She wakes up at noise and looks for me but goes back to sleep when I stroke her. Honestly, I'm certain she was a house cat that either got lost, or was abandoned. 

Any ideas of anything else I should to before the vet tomorrow? I'd LOVE to keep her, I'm already bonding, but we have 2 cats already, and one gets salty about strange animals."

AskReddit,feob01c,t3_eq1wzh,1579297599.0,"I would like to not be scared. Between my mental illnesses and physical disability (and neurologist malpractice and subsequent negligence - he's being investigated, thus I've had no-one assigned to treat me) I have lost most of myself and don't know how to get it back. It's affecting everything, including my relationship. Which is was kills me most of all. 

I'm scared of everything. And at this point have become scared of even attending doctor appointments (which obviously doesn't help). 
I don't know how to not be afraid. 

I would love a single moment of just not feeling frightened."

Good job getting out though, she obviously can't control her kids and that's not your problem. 

Cannot imagine living that life, sounds so miserable."
irishproblems,fdqaabf,t3_emp6l3,1578660981.0,"I saw someone say a spa voucher. For a mother in her 40s, THIS. It's not something that can be spent on her family, it's something just for her, and I'm sure she'd adore a bit of being pampered.
 
Don't get the voucher for something specific (like a massage/facial/manicure), let her choose what she wants. But I'm sure she'd love it. Man, I'm in my 20s with no kids and I'd love one, lol."

AmItheAsshole,fdp2cde,t3_emch4u,1578618337.0,"NTA. You need your sleep. And they're struggling. Also, they likely feel bad you'd prefer to sleep outside rather than deal with their troubles, but are dealing with it badly. 

Incidentally, I'm super into old tech, ancient survival/living, general paleoanthropology, so I find it super cool you get to do stuff like this. Major jelly, lol. 

Keep doing you!"
YouShouldKnow,fdm1dac,t3_em0dp2,1578537486.0,Easiest way I've found of removing permanent marker from a dry erase board is anti-bac hand gel or perfume (anything with alcohol in it). Works brill every time.
childfree,fcw9e9b,t1_fctxpfs,1578020168.0,"That's the thing. You can, of course! Some people just think those stickers are way cringey, whether you have kids or not. No biggy, it's a sticker."
AmItheAsshole,fcw09hq,t3_ej2idh,1578014161.0,"Okay so, at the end of the day your (and your partner's) wedding day is entirely up to you so don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want.  
BUT. A lot of what you're explaining sounds like an explicit highschool attitude that seems to be perpetuating. It's not about who you want at your special day, it's about who you don't want there. 
Excluding this person only matters because you care what other high school friends think. 

If you don't want to include her then don't. You may receive backlash due to the singular rejection but it sounds like a battle between what's expected and what you want, so, I guess you have to choose your battles. 

Hope things work out well for you Op! Congrats on your engagement!"
AmItheAsshole,fcvy4zt,t3_ej1x4z,1578012759.0,"Having read your post, and replies to comments I can categorically say, YTA. Hugely and absolutely. 

This woman had a restraining order against you due to abuse in the marriage and stalking, from you. And you are (as others have said) literally subverting her wishes and abusing her, one last time, by wanting to attend her funeral. 

I understand in YOUR head you love her, but you have no concept of other's wants and needs and it makes you sound like a genuine sociopath. I suggest you talk to a therapist and I sincerely hope you stay away from your ex-wife's funeral and away from her loved ones. Let them grieve. 

If you stay away, you will be a better person for it and please, for your sake if no-one else's, don't attend it. You ovbviously made her life painful (no matter what you do or do not admit to), do not choose to make her death painful too."

AmItheAsshole,fcig2zc,t3_eh8f8j,1577661998.0,"NTA. My uncle (married in) and my aunt kept their own separate last names for years after they married. Then when they decided to move back to the the area my uncle grew up (where his father lived) he took my aunt's last name, as he didn't want to be associated with his father (same reasons as your partner).
Nobody has ever had a problem with it and their kids carry my aunt's last name."

AmItheAsshole,fbzecou,t3_ef380v,1577243887.0,"Oof. I get the fallout, totally, and honestly I reckon you should suck it up and apologise.

BUT I get your point totally! My OH's mum will call incessantly for the most innocuous reasons. Literally, she'll call 10 times in 3 minutes just to say something like, ""are you home yet, your dad's busy and I need cigarettes"". (She's lovely, she's just a total ""Irish mum"", lol).

But I get what you're saying, you were busy and instead of just texting you that ""something big was happening and you need to answer the next call"", they just bombarded you with clueless calls. I wouldn't want to answer either lol, but they were trying to surprise everyone, as well as you. 

They were just trying to include you in a big moment and are unhappy you ""didn't let them"". It's a big deal for them, so just show some contrition and be happy for the newly engaged couple. Maybe put a little extra enthusiasm into what comes going forth."
