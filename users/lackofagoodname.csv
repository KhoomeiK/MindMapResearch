And if not, it takes 10 seconds to go to your settings and click the low/medium preset options to get console equivalent graphics. Then if you want to, you can spend time changing all the settings to get the best performance, but the presets are more than fine if your computer is at least as powerful as a console. 

The choice to fine tune settings is not a negative for PC. Not having that is a negative for consoles."

If I buy a $10 CD with 10 tracks and listen to each track one hundred times, thats $0.01 per listen. If I do the same on a streaming service, that artist gets $6. If their label is generous and they get 20% of album sales, that's only $2. On the other hand, the amount they make off me streaming only goes up with each listen. Of course you'd have to listen ~300 times to get to that $2, but if a CD is good enough to buy, I'll hit that in a couple months


How is that not better for the artists than a system where you pay once to listen an infinite amount of times and 80+% of that goes to not the artist? It may seem like less money but its just earned gradually as opposed to mostly within a couple months after release"

You do know fruits and vegetables have flesh too, right? Maybe you should specify what flesh they eat with the terminology we've all agreed on.

Regardless, I love how you changed ""meat eater"" to ""flesh eater"" to make it sound worse than it is. Solid effort
