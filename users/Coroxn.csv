Wrong! Tucker peddles lies all the time. Famously, he's claimed that several towns in America are ""English second language,"" places, fanning up fears that America is being taken over by immigrants (whose legality he never mentions) who are ""destroying our culture"". Stop peddling lies.

>Being anti illegal immigration is not at all racist or white nationalist.

When your legal immigration system is deliberately punitive and minimal, and your foreign policy has directly destablised the countries whose people are immigrating, then the irony of this statement becomes self evident. 

>Trump has never attacked Latinos

""Mexico is sending us rapists,"" is an attack on Latinos. He didn't say ""All Mexican illegal immigrants are rapists,"" (which would still be racist,"" he said ""Mexico is sending is rapists.""

Fascism is literally the movement that espouses to capture old imagined glory and revitalise the nation with emphasis on racial purity as the means to go about that recapture.

Your problem is that you hear the word ""Fascist,"" and you think ""Concentration camp"", ignorant of the fact that the concentration camps were a result of fascism in its height, and that there were steps leading up to it that the US is now demonstrably retracing.

The president of the united states is a literal fascist presiding over literal concentration camps. Disagreement on these lines is disagreement with the facts.
