aspergers,feczyq9,t1_feb9ovc,1578991804.0,"I would say you just do whatever makes you the most comfortable at this point... I also have a hard time letting things go without everybody fully acknowledging/understanding all the perspectives. But then at some point I just started realizing that this process was not as meaningful as it was in my head. Cutting him some slack wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea. Ask about his day and focus on him more instead. Maybe he would relax and open up more. 

Sometimes people simply don‚Äôt know what to say in those scenarios cuz we are very sensitive and somewhat perceived as unstable or frail. We are not frail per se. It‚Äôs like we are maybe four dimensional creatures living in this three dimensional world. We appear to be unstable or arbitrary to NTs cuz they don‚Äôt see the fourth dimension we are living in. Adequate explanations of our behaviors will help them understand but too much of it would become too heavy."
aspergers,feb1n78,t1_feax9zp,1578954576.0,"I can relate to this a lot. I think I manage to let more things go by going through the following thoughts (arbitrarily ordered):

1. I need to feel comfortable as well in the relationship. I can‚Äôt find a partner or a friend that judge me for who I am no matter how much I like them at this moment. If they judge me that way (getting annoyed when I‚Äôm just being myself), then it‚Äôs not meant to be. Once I accepted this, I became more relaxed around people.

2. People interactions are not 100% logical. It‚Äôs not like once you explained yourself they would just ‚Äúget it‚Äù and ‚Äúforgive you‚Äù. Reality is: they process what you have said, they come up with some arbitrary ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù then they carry on with the day. We have no control over how they would feel or act.. all we can do is to try our best so that we don‚Äôt regret and expect no return from others.

3. If you really wanna make people happy, be positive. People don‚Äôt like hearing your introspections and epiphanies in your life (I assumed that‚Äôs a big chunk of what you write to him cuz I tend to do that. But sorry for assuming if that‚Äôs not the case). so what I try to do is I treat human interactions as a task I can plan ahead. Then I balance the topics to be 5 positive + maybe 1 bummer (numbers are arbitrarily chosen. Please adjust to your specific case). But again, I think you as an individual matters a lot as well, which refer to point number 1. 

By lowering your expectations on others and yourself, you will actually show more confidence (stress is contagious). Don‚Äôt assume that NTs can take whatever stress just because they look more resilient. 

I relate to you a lot and I experience similar struggles with people. Hope we all manage to do better. Cheers!"

aspergers,fdjshs0,t1_fdjovo6,1578485891.0,"I‚Äôm the same. I mean not the personal details but overall.. I enjoy my life in my own way but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt care about having a likeminded friend. I do want to have friends, but I think finding someone that will have positive impact on my life is not trivial. Then it‚Äôs better to be alone. I‚Äôm just questioning the concept of ‚Äúhaving a partner will probably solve a huge chunk of problems for you and make you happy‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true."

SuicideWatch,fd2vkl0,t1_fd2r5ml,1578152050.0,"Yeah same here.. when I find a show funny and relatable, i feel less lonely and life is somehow worth living again... it sounds totally unreasonable and blown out of proportion but it works for me... and I can laugh at the same joke over and over again when it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù writing (putting good in quotes cuz it‚Äôs absolutely subjective)... it‚Äôs like appreciating a fine piece of art.. cheers for ridiculously simple happiness.."

SuicideWatch,fd294zd,t1_fd27l8k,1578143633.0,"Society forces prejudiced identities upon us. When you don‚Äôt fit into the social norm, you get rejected until you reshape yourself. And it‚Äôs hard to find peers to discuss such matters or to encourage each other cuz most people are conformist and the rest of us are just being depressed and never reach out to find each other. But I assure you, you are not alone. Find your real identity. Completely abandon the one defined by the society and move forward. It is not easy. But kinda challenging and interesting, isn‚Äôt it? If you fail, you fail. What you got to lose anyways? If you have that much energy to pick yourself up and define yourself on your own terms, one day you will find a more confident and stronger version of yourself standing there. Fuck the world."
SuicideWatch,fd25ssf,t3_ejtios,1578142142.0,I‚Äôm intrigued by small stuff.. like good puns.. or some fun TV shows.... I don‚Äôt care about the social norm as much anymore as I get older and that‚Äôs a huge relief. Only then can I focus more on myself and become less and less suicidal. I try to make my cat happy by understanding her through her behaviors and body languages. I like learning new stuff by myself and having endless internal thoughts. I still don‚Äôt interact much with the world but that help me make peace with it.
SuicideWatch,fd24rqe,t3_ejryog,1578141670.0,Just wanna give a hug. Uncle is a shameless fuck obviously. The reason he managed to make you feel bad not the other way round is that the society is on his side I guess. I think the most proud thing one can do is to have a consistent and clear mind and fuck the society when things don‚Äôt make sense. Hope one day we all manage to get there.
aspergers,fd24bn4,t3_ejudap,1578141468.0,If you don‚Äôt want to turn your interests into a career I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter that they change all the time?
SuicideWatch,fd1isas,t1_fczl95v,1578131812.0,"Second answer is clear thanks.
As for the first, I guess I‚Äôm just curious what defines your identity. When you say people care about you as a person, what does that mean exactly.. sorry that it is not an easy concept for me to grasp. When people care about life itself it is pretty concrete.. Life exists. Good. Life gone. Bad. But caring about one person it‚Äôs quite abstract.. is it strong empathy that you are seeking? Do you want to resonate your emotions somehow with others? I guess caring about  (or even just getting to know) someone is not an easy task and the easiest way to proceed is usually just to drop it at some point. Most people are too selfish too lazy too weak for that task. 
Have you experienced caring about someone the way you would like to be cared about?

EDIT: I thought more about it. You said you got tired of your hobbies cuz you couldn‚Äôt bring them up in conversations (one of the reasons) so they are useless. Is it possible that you are an inverted person but (in the past) you tried too hard to fit into the society. Your effort has been put into a path that is orthogonal to what you really want. That has caused a serious burnout? I‚Äôm just randomly guessing. I think your thoughts are interesting. Not saying life is worth living or not. Who knows. But whatever interesting feels like a gift."
SuicideWatch,fcyroma,t3_ejbjwl,1578085650.0,"Just out of curiosity, what would make you feel that someone has given a fuck? When you say people don‚Äôt care about you as a person, which part do you mean exactly? A separate question if it‚Äôs not too much to ask... what do you find interesting? Does everything feel equally boring to you or there are some things kinda making you interested?"
