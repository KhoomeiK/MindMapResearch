dune,ff6czcg,t1_ff6cm0k,1579624502.0,"I don’t know how to feel either but I’m thinking Dennis just runs a tight ship. This is a hugely anticipated film after all and leaks can really derail the momentum of whatever marketing campaign is in the works before it even leaves the ground. 

I’m really hoping for something during the super bowl but you usually hear something about that. But December is really not *that* far away. You’d think they would have dropped literally anything by now."

“I’m hoping that in time you can lay down

All this weight you’ve been carrying around

And maybe one day

You’ll find your way

To climb on up out of your grave

With the bits of you you managed to save”"

todayilearned,fenemd8,t1_fen97r0,1579283034.0,Maybe you should read about his life and his underlying frustrations with isolation. Very simple cause and effect. The internet has such a hard on for manifestos as if the simple act of writing one makes you a genius. Granted he was a genius. But he found something to blame for his life and he poured his heart and soul into it.
todayilearned,fenefjn,t1_fen6cd2,1579282921.0,"I’ve read some of it. I get the idea. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t a misdirection of frustration and a surface level analysis of his life points to such. 

Most times people become extremists because of external factors or personal failures that they find a patsy for. Look at white nationalism. What demographic is attracted to it? Young, disillusioned, isolated white men. It’s a misdirection of frustration.

Edit: I find it hilarious another comment here says the same thing I did only he mentions a conspiracy theory. Reddit truly is a fucking tabloid."

It’s clear he always *wanted* to fit in but never could. His shack was a reluctant situation, not desired. Mail bombings were just the manifestation of his frustration. It’s no different from a lot of the shooting we see today from disillusioned, isolated white men. There’s just a valley of difference between respective IQs."

samharris,fe4l636,t1_fe4k1qm,1578860494.0,"Well the confusion is mostly due to the fact that you spend more time coming back to them than you do actually refuting arguments presented against you, this is especially funny since you've already stated you're short on time and can't properly refute arguments though you may get around to that later... presumably after you're finished telling everyone how they're wasting your time? By somehow making you comment? You can't control what other people do. You can only control what you do, and you're doing absolutely nothing.

It's clear you're just here for the attention. You're full of shit my friend. Probably time to get off the internet."

I've watched this show too many times now and there's clearly people with enhanced abilities scattered throughout the story, Holy Wayne being the most prominent. Others include Patti, Virgil, Kevin Sr., Isaac, David Burton and later Kevin Jr. 

After my last rewatch, I firmly believe that at the end of season 1, Holy Wayne grants Kevin's wish which based on evidence can be assumed to be that he can never die. Kevin says numerous times throughout the show he doesn't want to die and also... the hotel, most powerful man in the world kinda point to him being immortal."
