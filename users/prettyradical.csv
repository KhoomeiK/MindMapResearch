The extra helping of large fries just isn’t worth that risk, Brenda. But do you.

PS: it’s not obsessive. It’s conscious. You know what obsessive? My constant drive to eat that pushed me up to 287 Brenda. THAT was obsessive."
fatlogic,feeofqu,t3_eorlnp,1579037875.0,"We totally live in a society where women are taught to hate their bodies but if you’re thin fuck off! You’re not allowed to feel that way. You’re required to be immune from the society in which women are taught to hate their bodies. Because you’re thin. And there’s no way you can hate your body. Even tho...society. Or something.

Also: all men are immune and all men love their bodies. This is only applicable to women. Fat women. 

🙄"
fatlogic,feeaejj,t1_feea0s3,1579029699.0,"Wow. That’s just unfortunate. Maybe she’s just seen a lot of failure. SHM. Well I would personally find her non belief motivating. Lol. 

Keep bangin. Congrats on your progress!"
fatlogic,fee9y6c,t1_fee2yrb,1579029435.0,You can do it. Hey I’m there and knock it out.
fatlogic,fee9k8l,t1_fedo30y,1579029208.0,"Dark Cocoa powder
Swerve powdered “sugar”
A little Splenda 
Water

10 calories per tablespoon of cocoa. 

You’re welcome!

PS if you really want to get crazy add a little bit of coconut oil. It adds a few calories but gives mouthfeel."
fatlogic,fee9f4b,t1_fedxhva,1579029124.0,"Failed experts are my pet peeve. I should listen to you, why??"
fatlogic,fee8qy3,t1_fedpf4b,1579028728.0,"Woohoo! Congrats! It’s really astounding how little food and calories humans actually need of you choose wisely. I can find it really difficult to hit 1200 plus drink all the liquid I should drink if I’m eating well chosen foods. 


Keep going!"
fatlogic,fee7xtp,t1_fedwusd,1579028251.0,Wow. I mean you’re obviously doing the thing! Wtf? At the very least she should’ve “read her audience” better. You told her you’re at a 32BMI. She should’ve known right there that you were well educated about this. Wtf? Is she overweight?
fatlogic,fee7caq,t1_fedts4f,1579027900.0,"I am so sorry you you loss. This broke my heart and brought tears to my eyes. 

While we all get cute and snarky here from time to time, this is the real real. As someone whose spouse is basically bedridden at age 57 from problems associated with obesity and surgeries etc and who can never be cured even if he loses weight and who will meet an early death and who now has so many regrets, (I’ve posted about him many times here) these stories need to be told over and over again. It’s not cute. It’s deadly serious. And this is why we here do what we do. 

Sending you and your family deep condolences, love, peace and comfort during this difficult time. I’m so sorry."
fatlogic,fddil01,t1_fdd2zb1,1578313740.0,Meh I’m okay. It happens.
fatlogic,fdbbxzr,t1_fdbafrd,1578255888.0,It wasn’t factious or sarcastic. I was saying that all the fat people i personally know claim to have had anorexia. I used the word literally unironically because it’s true. I know a few heavy people and they all claim to have had anorexia. Literally every one of them. It’s nuts.
fatlogic,fdb4fp9,t1_fdav0qz,1578253665.0,😂😂😂
fatlogic,fdb0vp4,t1_fday083,1578252452.0,🙄 their whole comment dismissing my comment as “the dumbest thing they’ve ever seen on the internet” or whatever is what I responded to. I responded dickishly to a dickish comment. But by all means let’s focus on the word “literally”.
fatlogic,fdatvc6,t1_fdaqh0e,1578250085.0,I don’t make a habit of being nice to people who are hostile toward me. That persons comment was shitty. I gave them back shitty.
fatlogic,fdald1f,t1_fdak11x,1578247383.0,Don’t care. It’s true in MY LIFE.  Every fat person in my life has made a point of letting me know they were once anorexic. I don’t believe them and you can fuck off. You sound triggered.
fatlogic,fdaa6a9,t1_fda8l79,1578243550.0,Exactly. She’s perfectly normally sized. She’s no different now than any popular celebrity. It’s just that we are used to seeing her fluffy. Same reaction our family members have when they see us after we’ve lost a lot of weight.
fatlogic,fda9weq,t1_fda6087,1578243444.0,You can only do so much. She doesn’t seem ready. Congratulations on your weight loss!
fatlogic,fda7h5p,t1_fd9ibqw,1578242660.0,Even the mannequins are plus sized. It’s crazy.
fatlogic,fda5dzq,t1_fda53x5,1578241907.0,Yes she’s venting. But it’s possible to be jealous of your success without photos. IJS. Her post is literally: you did something I tried and failed to do. And I’m mad. You should STFU.
fatlogic,fda4xgz,t1_fd9sbn8,1578241725.0,"There’s literally no way to not “language police” oneself if the goal is to not trigger anyone ever. Sorry. I don’t know what the OP posted about her  weight loss. But it seems like you’re assuming it was an aggressive anti-obesity missive. It’s much more likely it was something as simple as: 50 pounds down and I feel amazing like a new person. 

That’s going to trigger SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE. Because yes weight is a sensitive issue. But what triggers one person won’t trigger another. So short of never ever mentioning it at all ever, there’s no way to completely prevent the possibility of offending or triggering someone. Which is unfair. Those who are triggered can scroll past. Or block. This is the only reasonable solution.  

And by the way it’s 100% possible to both recognize that it’s a sensitive issue for some and also have empathy while not taking responsibility for how others react to a normal update or celebration about this."
fatlogic,fda2n8a,t1_fd9q6vz,1578240986.0,It doesn’t require a big ego to understand that she’s clearly jealous. There’s literally no other reason for her comment.
fatlogic,fda2g55,t1_fd9tu0q,1578240909.0,Literally every fat person i know once was anorexic. Literally.
fatlogic,fda1dzx,t3_ekegof,1578240583.0,She looks fine. Everybody else (72%) is too fat.
fatlogic,fcxlehw,t1_fcxjgqy,1578065758.0,"Yeah nothing is true 100% of the time. Sure. And I’m not really using weight as a “proxy” for mental health. But it really takes a lot of work to be 300 or 400 pounds. I don’t know your brother so I can’t be specific but I’ll say this: when I was 287 nobody (including myself!) would’ve guessed me for having a mental health issue. I was hard working, normal, not crying myself to sleep at night or anything. I looked perfectly normal. I acted perfectly normal. I thought I was perfectly normal. Turns out I was depressed over some things I won’t get into here. But it was a functional depression that I would never have noticed had not some other circumstances come along and made we realize I was overeating AND overworking to mask some general unhappiness."
fatlogic,fcxgtek,t1_fcxfh79,1578062559.0,"I’d agree with you with respect to people who are at the low end of obese or just overweight. 20-50 pounds over ideal, yes. But I disagree that someone who’s 100+ pounds overweight is just misinformed about nutrition. I just don’t think it’s possible to get to that level unless you’re using food as a coping mechanism. Been there. Twice. And at one point in the distant past had a business that focused exclusively on helping people who had 75 or more pounds to lose. It’s a mental health issue at that point. I have yet to see an exception. Could be out there but I definitely haven’t seen it."
fatlogic,fcw701j,t1_fcw6wiy,1578018594.0,I’m glad they put it on there though. It’s useful information. Like I order broccoli. lol. Even the kiddie grilled cheese is like 400 calories. I’m like: 😩😩😩😩😩
fatlogic,fcw6tcz,t1_fcw6n4u,1578018476.0,"I used to eat there often. Nowadays I can’t bring myself to do it. 

Me: what??? 1850 calories for .... an omelette? Fuck off. 

I  don’t have the discipline to fast long enough to save up calories. If I do, I’m more likely to eat somewhere else. 

But props to you!"
fatlogic,fcw6j1m,t3_ej7f9p,1578018290.0,I think overeating to the point of obesity is an eating disorder and a self harming form of mental illness that needs treated. Now what?
fatlogic,fcw6a72,t3_ej7nq4,1578018128.0,"Humans have intermittent fasted since walking upright, Jan. It’s natural, Jan and we are perfectly adapted for it. 

That 1780 calorie ihop breakfast though, not so much. Jan."
Anarchy101,fcvcu9e,t1_fcuflxv,1577999424.0,thanks is a great comment. thank you.
tretinoin,fcozk36,t1_fcoxw7p,1577845963.0,"Working wonderfully. I’m mostly using it for anti-aging. I like the clarity, texture and tone. It’s been a few weeks now and it’s good. My routine is very simple: cleanse with cereve hydrating. On days I apply the homemade butters. On nights that I’m applying tret I cleanse then dry. Then I put on a very thin layer of a simple DIY hyaluronic acid serum (literally just water and HA) and let it dry. Then put on the tret. That’s it. To get the peeling skin off I just gently use a washcloth or homemade sugar/coconut oil scrub. 

I have used salicylic acid in the past and like it well enough. It’s just that I think any kind of peel formula + tret would be really hard on the skin."
tretinoin,fcowy2k,t3_eib7dg,1577843843.0,"I’m not an expert but I think the tea tree oil will burn/sting like hell. Tret makes even the mildest things seem harsh on the skin. Definitely do not use salicylic acid with tret. It’s too much all at once. As I said, iME, my skin is very sensitive once I started tret treatment. I don’t even use normal moisturizers anymore just my homemade coconut oil/shea butter blend. Many other things sting. 

Take it slow and be patient."
tretinoin,fbduptj,t3_ecickd,1576771761.0,"I just started a couple weeks ago but I’ve used tret in the past. 

I cleanse with water and occasionally cerave but rarely. For moisture I use my own homemade Shea/Coconut oil formula. You can also make your own hyaluronic acid serum using HA power and distilled water. It’s beautiful. 

To exfoliate the flakes I just gently use a washcloth. Or sometimes very gently use my homemade sugar scrub which is just sugar and coconut oil. 

Best of luck!"
