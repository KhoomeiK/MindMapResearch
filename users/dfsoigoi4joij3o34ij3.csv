It's not just the cute buzzy fuzzy wuzzy bees, it's also all the nasties and bities and creepy-crawlies. We fucking *need* the bottom of the food chains for anything to work."

It's a Danish group for trading reel to reel stuff. I can't promise you that people would be willing to chance getting it shipped that far, but you can try if you feel like it. There are plenty of nice and engaged people there. Otherwise, I'm sure there's equivalent US groups."
audiophile,fd4sbwa,t1_fd41d3z,1578170648.0,"I've tried doing very cursory comparisons between digital and vinyl, and usually I hear no real difference, with digital sometimes winning in the treble area. But I haven't really experienced differences in soundstage and dynamics. So I'm very curious to know what made it different for you.

Tape saturation is compression and harmonic distortion, though, isn't it? So it's essentially a destructive process that just happens to sound good as I understand it. I only have tapes with my own or other people's home recordings from other media, so I have yet to have the ""true"" tape experience. But I do like my R2R for the tactile experience it brings.

Man, I so badly wish to get my hands on some master dubs. Some day, maybe."
audiophile,fd4prks,t1_fd4n5dr,1578169873.0,"You could certainly go vintage, too, if you'd like. In that case it should be refurbished or measured to ensure it's still within spec.

I believe the audiophile hobby is marred by people not understanding how big of an influence placebo can have. If you are convinced your new $10.000 cables make a difference, you will hear one. The same goes for amps, people will swear up and down that amp A is heaps better than amp B, but won't dare do a blind test. So go in with an open but skeptical mind."
audiophile,fd40g5l,t1_fd3vdj0,1578163233.0,"I am of the stout opinion that any well built amp is going to have a negligible effect on the sound. So get anything modern with the features you need. The speakers are quite sensitive, so you shouldn't have to worry about getting enough power."
audiophile,fd3zp72,t3_ejy724,1578163030.0,"Lovely. Have you tried doing level matched A/B test with another source, like Spotify? I'd love to do that sometime to see how big of a difference there really is."
audiophile,fd3z4tz,t1_fd3rpbn,1578162923.0,Hi! You're an asshole.
audiophile,fd3yx46,t1_fd3ebbn,1578162881.0,"My understanding is that it's not necessarily about the medium, but more about the mastering. I believe a lot of dynamic compression gets introduced when a track is mastered for radio, because it needs to be played on crappy car stereos and portable radios. Look into the loudness war, it's probably a big part of it."
ReelToReel,fd3xrtj,t3_ejxy4d,1578162556.0,"Would you be willing to ship to Europe? In that case, I may know some people who are interested."
AmateurRoomPorn,fcf1drt,t1_fceqx23,1577625683.0,"Why even have it out like that? I'm not trying to put you down, but to me it seems silly both if you play a lot of chess and if you never play.

I love everything else."
Anticonsumption,fcasi4z,t1_fcaho8t,1577575747.0,"To be *actually* fair, everyone knew this 20 years ago, and these companies are just starting to talk about it because they see it as finally being good marketing. It's despicable."
cassetteculture,fc803fa,t1_fc78cxc,1577523275.0,"Absolutely.  And I would rip my CDs, so I could obviously skip that step by buying digital directly.
But I'm talking about buying used. Used CDs often go for $0.75-1.5 where I live, so they are cheaper than digital albums."
cassetteculture,fc5d1pd,t1_fc5a8t3,1577453827.0,"For me, CDs over streaming would be about owning my music, and not being subject to whatever licensing rights the different services have at any point in time. Also, I want to be able to listen to my music offline. So CDs would be serving much of the same purpose as my other physical media. Records and tapes take up a lot of space, so I prefer to keep that for the cream of the crop.

Edit: But I also understand the view that CDs are sort of the worst of both worlds: less charm and tactility than records and tape, without the convenience of digital."
cassetteculture,fc51npu,t1_fc4m2dy,1577438508.0,"My toughts exactly. These are the years to get CDs if you want to stay ahead of the curve. Honestly, I feel like the very best years are already past us."
cassetteculture,fc51lto,t1_fc4yj49,1577438433.0,"Precisely. I think I am going to move back to a mix of digital and physical music, but all stuff I own. Tapes for my own mixes, records for the best of the best albums, CDs and digital for everything else, and perhaps streaming for discovery and mobility."
cassetteculture,fc51j4y,t1_fc45pq3,1577438323.0,"Exactly. Streaming makes up part of how I listen to music, and I find it invaluable for discovering new stuff. But, like you, I refuse to be completely dependent of the whims of digital rights agreements. My regional version of Netflix is seriously hampered when compared to the US version, and stuff is always disappearing. Music is so important to me that I will suffer the same there."
cassetteculture,fc40z7z,t1_fc3y5g6,1577403770.0,"Honestly, I have thought about getting back into CDs. Tape and records have become expensive where I live, to the point of me wanting to give up on fleamarkets and charity shops. CDs are still super cheap."
