Do you assume that men are some kind of savages? A flick to the forehead is not going to result in a full blown fight unless one or both parties have some major anger issues. 

> Idk, whatever any mature adult would say? Which would be nothing, or laying out their or beef for discussion. Most adults don’t go around physically provoking other adults because they don’t like them. 

Do I need to repeat that it takes Stephen around a minute to say a single word? 

> No, he knows damn well he won’t because he’s in a wheelchair. That’s what makes it a bitch move, because if he weren’t, he (like most men) would never physically provoke people he doesn’t like for the lolz. He’s taking advantage of social norms to be a shithead to people. 

And you know this, how? 

> Ah ok. Well since you think this is perfectly normal and hilarious, next time you go out physically “messing” with able-bodied men you don’t like, report back with how funny it was (and take a video while you’re at it, I’d love to see how it goes). 

Why would I? I'm not the type of person to go out of my way to mess with people I don't like. Irl I like to keep to myself and ignore anyone who I don't like or I'm not familiar with. Obviously there's other people out there who would do that, but that ain't me."

You can't use words in that situation lol. You can either ignore em, or mess with em. This also doesn't take into account that Stephen apparently takes a minute on average to say a single word.

> Yeah, he doesn't care if he gets ""called out"" because that's nothing compared to the reaction someone would have towards a physically capable person doing the same shit. Doesn't take a whole lot of bravery to not be afraid of being ""called out."" 

So what are you getting at exactly? That deep inside he's afraid of being punched or some shit? Because you're just assuming things at this point. Also, a physically capable person wouldn't have a wheelchair lol.
