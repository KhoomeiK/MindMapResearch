Sims4,fd7uzyu,t1_fd7up2e,1578210535.0,"there are no real extra charges except buying her additional expansion/stuff packs which provide her a better and more expansive gaming experience. a lot of great building content is free that is created by other users (custom content). be aware though that running custom content in your game on the computer CAN slow your game down and every now and then, corrupt CC gets into your game and completely screws it. so if she chooses to download CC (there are a lot of instruction manuals on the internet about how to download and install CC), the goal is slow and steady in the event she downloads a bad file so she can go back and delete it"
Sims4,fd7ugq9,t1_fd7uexr,1578210288.0,i should write the developers an email lol
Sims4,fd7u798,t1_fd7u2bj,1578210169.0,oh wow. i was expecting something creepy like the sims staring at you through the screen or something lol
Sims4,fd7u4dw,t1_fd7tsyy,1578210132.0,"you can start her on xbox and then move her to PC but that means you’ll be buying the game twice. you can only play the sims 4 for xbox on the xbox and sims 4 for PC on a PC computer. like another user mentioned, if she plays on the PC she has to download a client called Origin and through that app, that is how she will install, launch, and play sims 4 on the computer. whatever families and progress she makes on xbox cannot be transferred to PC. she’ll have to start over so it’s best to choose which one to have her on for the long run and stick with that to prevent buying the same game twice on two different consoles"

Sims4,fd7s71x,t1_fd7rwl9,1578209273.0,"they’re not stupid at all! i’m like obsessed with sims so this is actually fun for me haha. so to limit the whole internet scenario, i would get her sims for xbox. you would buy a physical game from the store it’s an actual cd. i will say this though, she will have much for creative freedom if you get her the sims on PC because there’s endless amounts of custom content (content created by other users that is not included by Electronic Arts) that allow her wildest dreams to come true"

Sims4,fd7r718,t1_fd7qku2,1578208819.0,"sims is very much a solo game. ive been playing for years and have never heard of any sims “live” playing. it’s not like IMVU or second life. now sims EA does have an online community but it’s not integrated into the actual gameplay like you think (anyone feel free to correct if i’m wrong!) sims is available on both PC/mac and on xbox/playstation consoles so if you’re worried about her being on the internet, i would get sims 4 on PS4 for her"
Sims4,fd7pcym,t3_ek9n9j,1578208011.0,if she’s into building houses she will LOVE sims. one of my favorite parts about playing sims is seeing all the talented architecture from the other players. it’s quite inspiring because i could never

deathnote,fd5tf8o,t1_fd5t6hc,1578181306.0,"i do agree with that for sure and i did like the last episode, but i felt like near and mello were kind of filler information to keep the season going. i don’t know i can’t explain it.. i just felt like it was more information that wasn’t warranted. but overall i’d 100% watch the whole show over again"
deathnote,fd5sx86,t1_fd5slli,1578181138.0,"that’s very true. it did quickly develop into Light caring about the rottenness of the world to Light just wanting to see if he could outsmart someone as smart, if not smarter, as him. 

i just recently finished it and loved it but still feel as though it could’ve ended a few episodes earlier"
deathnote,fd5r5kz,t1_fd5qnp9,1578180563.0,"i thought that as well, but his initial introduction made him come off as a pretty well-rounded individual. and if his whole mantra is justice, i would’ve expected him to be attracted to other like-minded individuals. L was essentially his match and then there’s the scene where they help dry each other off (which i thought was a little weird lol i wasn’t sure what to expect). i was actually very sad to see someone as bright as Light to go down the path he did."
