Then, you can start investigating The Shroud, which is like a more benign Warp you can't travel through. At some point you will get an event that lets you attempt to make one of your leaders the Chosen One. This is not guaranteed to be your ruler, it can be any random yahoo you got on your paylist and they might die or turn on you. A few years after you succeed in the event, your people will start worshipping the Chosen One as a God and you'll have the option of reforming your country to better reflect that.

However, you can just set up your empire to be 40K Imperium of Man from the get-go. Spiritualist, Authoritarian and Militarist are all obvious ethics options, and Imperial Cult is a good civic for it as well (Byzantine Bureacracy/Philosopher King/Nationalistic Zeal are options as well). Or you could go the other way, making an enlightened, peaceful democratic society that will eventually be turned into the Imperium once your Chosen One appears. 

Either way, there's no way to make the Chosen One event happen faster, so just go psionic and wait. Good luck!"
worldbuilding,fddf070,t1_fdddz7w,1578309263.0,"Active not so much but have a look at [this](https://imgur.com/a/6VcI7Ho). The country with Samarkand is Uzbekistan, the others are named in the pic as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The alley (the Fergana Valley, home to Greeks, Chinese, Persians, Turks, Mongols and Russians throughout its long history) in the middle with the weird-ass borders is the most fertile land in the region. Uzbekistan owns the valley itself, apart from the route out which is owned by Tajikistan and most of the surrounding mountains are owned by Kyrgyzstan. Basically, the notion is to prevent any one of these countries from dominating the others (thought Uzbekistan is the most powerful).

The Russian Empire set this up and while the Russians/Soviets extended political integration into the region, these weirdo borders weren't an issue. Post-Soviet collapse however, it results in frequent border closure by Uzbekistan and is a constant source of friction between the three countries. I bet you can come up with a lot of interesting problems that might arise if a bunch of countries have a situation like that but without some UN/international community thing to frown at border-changing wars."

worldbuilding,fdddw42,t3_ekqua7,1578307690.0,"One method I use is make the map and set up nations there. Depending on how fully you decide to do this, you can look at your map and see what countries are likely to be rich and well-defended and who may not be (rivers, coastline and fertile lands all help make you rich, oceans and mountains help make you well-defended). From there you can move on to generating conflicts and so on. My problem with this is I tend to make the countries fit together a bit too neatly, so no one has anything good to fight over.

An alternative is decide what kind of conflict you want, then read up on relevant real life situations. Want a story about a number of competing countries living in the shadow of a much larger neighbor? Look at the Stans in Central Asia. Medieval Europe (lots of smaller countries in very rich lands) and pre-Zulu Africa (lots of smaller tribes in poorer lands) provide examples of different kinds of warfare. Small European nations at war would more often than not fight for survival; you lose you get overrun. African tribes, by contrast, made use of war dances and other non-combative tricks to limit casualties during conflict because they couldn't afford it. Until the population grew big and Shaka lead the Zulus to conquest. 

Honestly, reading up on real-life conflicts, even modern ones, tend to get me going creativity-wise."
