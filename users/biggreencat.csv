I also wonder at why you're interested in a conversation like that being civil. by its nature, it's not. do you think that, without pre-defined civility, it'll just be partisans shooting it out in the streets?

if someone made that claim about me as a politician, i'd first consider how damaging such a claim could possibly be to me before committing time and resources towards fighting it. then i'd weigh the damage with the cost of fighting it. then i'd try to find the most effective means of fighting it. finally, i'd just sue for however much i could get.

Holding people accountable for false statements is incredibly difficult. How do you prove a statement was false? Then, how do you prove malicious intent? Or, does malicious intent not matter? And if it does, how do you measure the damage done by such statements?

The big problem with the courts is that, for something like this, the better prepared legal team stands a much better chance of winning, regardless of truth. By logical extension, people who have more money can slander the poor at will, but not vice versa.

However, the problem with attempts to curb this type of behavior is essentially stifling free speech and the free exchange of ideas and information. That's anti-American.


I believe the statement that Tulsi is a Russian asset, but Hillary was far from the first person to make that statement. Many people see Tulsi as a Russian asset based on her behavior.


As for risks Hillary takes leveling these accusations, she thinks as I do in these matters. I'm sure she's under no illusions that her peons across America hang on every word she speaks. She just happens to be a public figure voicing something people like her think. Nobody from the news asked my opinion, so I'm glad this particular one is being spoken about by someone on the news."

you need to control the handfighting game and be ready to sprawl at all times. if he gets a shot off, fight to double underhooks.

you want to be tiring this guy out. double underhook to bearhug, and constsntly lifting on the underhooks. you need to use good defense and handfighting to get in close. you probably won't get a takedown from underhooks, but a fake shot can give you a front headlock, which is exactly where you want to be. drag him across the mat and usr head-in-the-hole to spin around. if he touches your leg, take a second to think to see if he's in headlock or pancake position. i like to trap both arms with a strong crossface for a pancake.

don't try too hard from top if he's much better than you. just cut him loose and do it again.

however, it sounds like it might be best for your team to have him take 103 and you take 112."
