I played it casually on and off for a while, but for a few months I've been playing it a lot and getting ""better"" at it to the point where its getting a bit too easy unless I mess around (offline). Cba with people messaging me if I somehow win online, I have to deal with enough toxic people in my life as it is. I'd probably lose all the time anyway since I'd be new to online play"

XXXTENTACION,fdfrpl9,t3_el20a6,1578368569.0,"Joe rogan podcast. Both smoking weed, chilling, making jokes, talking about life and the meaning of it. I think Joe would be good with him, it might be a bit slow at the start because they come from different walks of life and the age gap, but I think once they get into it, the energy would be amazing. They would definitely have their differences of opinion and may clash, but not in a negative way, I think. It would be a good listen imo. They could both grow from that experience and so could the listeners."
depression,fdfjqyd,t3_el170m,1578363330.0,"Yeah it took me a while to realise that I'm the one who always texts first. So I wait until they text me first and it never happens lol so I give in and text them. I've learnt to not work myself up about it anymore and just stop texting/talking to people when I'm the one who is constantly texting first. If they wanna talk to me, they will is what I tell myself. The funny thing is that now nobody texts me. If I don't laugh at myself, I'll cry. But the crying will come later anyway. I guess I just come off as needy and it puts people off. Once I start texting I tend to write long messages because I hardly ever get any human interaction. So I understand, I guess. I mean look at this comment, it's pretty long I just can't help myself. I'll stop now, sorry."
depression,fdd2gr6,t3_eknnr3,1578292117.0,"I genuinely wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Its hell on earth. I know it sounds stupid but I have come to hate movies/shows that are supposed to make u feel good with love, friendship, happy endings etc because it physically hurts and the small glimmer of hope that enters my mind is unbearable. It keeps happening and I can never stop myself in believing things will change for the better. It just ends in more heartbreak and with each time it happens a small piece of myself dies. I know this sounds cringy, but I don't have the words to explain it in a better way."
depression,fdcf8vn,t3_ekfp0m,1578273444.0,"I love sleep. It takes me a while to fall asleep and some nights I don't, but when I do I love it. Its probably what being dead feels like minus the dreams (could, be wrong since its probably impossible to prove). It's a state of nothing, just empty, a void. It's makes me feel truly free. And even when I dream whether it's a good dream, a random one or a nightmare I feel like my true self, like the person I'm supposed to be in a different world (in other words I'm comfortable with myself) . It really upsets me when I wake up after a dream tho or even waking up and having no memory of my dreams, I guess it's like a vacation away from this world into a different dimension or maybe I just tell myself that as a coping mechanism. Maybe this is it, parallel universes, multiverse, ascending to a different dimension after death etc is all stuff we make up in our minds to give us a little bit of peace, kinda like how some people turn to religion because its easy to find 'answers' to life. Anyway sorry for the rant lol."
