science,ff6sj8m,t3_errv55,1579633982.0,"ok. and I do NOT mean to be a jerk here, but did they say exactly HOW to reduce one's waist circumference? Yeah, yeah, I really do know that eating less and eating right and regular exercise are vital, and you know what? I do all that. I really do. I am a post menopausal ex smoker who is truly dedicated to turning my health around, but DAMMIT it's hard! My bp is better, my breathing is better, my running and endurance are better, but my waist has stayed the same for a year.

thanks for letting me say my piece."

There will probably be comments here that say something bad about Goodwill, but I think they do a  good thing,"

one of my favorite folk songs by Woodie Guthrie.   
""Some will rob you with a 6 gun, and some with a fountain pen"" is so true and so poetic. check the song out! (A vision shared is a great album with songs from Woodie and Leadbelly)"

inthenews,fc4ukmr,t3_eg41x5,1577429005.0,"it does not 'help the cause' to create scenes and pump stories like this.  The truth is ugly enough. no embroidery is necessary. ammo of any kind in a car on the way to Mexico is obv. going to be a problem,  ammo in a car on the way to Mexico to stage a statement is worse. getting stopped for it shouldn't surprise anyone and th e headline is misleading

 in fact, this sounds like something the right wingers would do. hmmm"
