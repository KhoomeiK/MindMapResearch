puppy101,ff4damo,t3_erl2hx,1579560900.0,"You know, I'm wary of the dog park for this EXACT reason. I read in a training book that though bringing dogs to dog parks could be beneficial to socialize the dog, situations like this can cause your dog to associate other dogs with fear, and a scared dog is an agressive dog. Be very careful. My puppy is a tiny havanese, and she's scared of bigger dogs already (she was a rescue so the reason is out of my reach and unknown) so I personally don't find dog parks to be a good choice. Ultimately it's up to you and to chance because even if YOU do everything right, you never know what sort of dummy is gonna bring their agressive dogs to the park, or brings unsocialized and nervous dogs to a dog park. Just be informed and be careful. Your puppy is still learning! Good luck!"
