AskReddit,fek23v1,t3_epfjje,1579190973.0,"When I was 19 I was not living my best life. Stripping and drugs. One night my appendix ruptured. Because of my lifestyle I was highly resistant to go to the hospital and thought the pain would pass. At this point it hadn’t ruptured yet but I held out until it had. I never knew one could endure such searing agony. My mom and neighbour had to carry me to the car and I screamed the entire drive to the hospital because every tiny bump on the road was painful. After my surgery I was told if I’d waited 4 more hours to come in I’d have died. Pieces of my intestines had to be removed due to the damage from the acid from my ruptured appendix. I was in hospital 2 weeks and went from 130lbs to 90. 

At least I got off the drugs."
