TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fdsgfgv,t1_fdsftfh,1578702225.0,"Its like... He mustve ordered a sandwich and not finished it. He knew he'd be returning in five weeks, and thought surely the front desk can hold it for that entire duration. Instead of just throwing it out or finishing it on the trip home or whatever. Imagine coming back after 5 weeks and being like 'Wheres my sandwich?!?!"" And going up and taking a bite out of a stinky pile of mold with a sense of satisfaction for saving $4. I really hope the agent who accepted it at least put up some sort of objection."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fbzxkuf,t3_efeenp,1577267139.0,"That‚Äôs funny! I‚Äôve gotten some funny crank calls too. But also some legitimately creepy pervs soliciting me for weird shit. 

There was this one guest who was staying a few nights. This fat older man, kinda guy who walks with his disgusting stomach hanging out of his sweatpants and stained white t shirt who is always walking around perpetually‚Äôdoing laundry‚Äô.

Anyway he comes to the desk and starts complaining we don‚Äôt offer massages because he really wants a foot massage. Wink wink. Sorry sir we don‚Äôt offer that service. Gee really wish you did Wink Wink WINKKK

He goes to his room. An hour later he calls me. Did you think about that foot massage? He asks. How can I get one? Sir, we don‚Äôt offer that service. BUT, hypothetically, if you did... how much?

I‚Äôm sorry, how much? I ask. He says 100, maybe? No way in hell im touching this creepy dudes nasty ass feet while he jiggles his pecker under those grimy sweatpants. I sternly said not to bother me and hung up.

Apparently he tried to make his move with every agent working those days haha"
