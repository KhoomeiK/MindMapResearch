AskReddit,ff30ft5,t1_ff2yvm9,1579530329.0,"Well you can see for yourself that there are major increases in crop failures worldwide due to climate related issues(e.g. droughts in Australia and California. Opposite to that, in my area people are installing massive amounts of drainage piping (tile drainage) to pull water from their fields in an attempt to continue the viability of their land throughout the growing season. We're experiencing bigger and more frequent floods year after year.
If this is the beginning of a trend then we're in serious trouble, and it won't take 50 years to see the results whether or not climate change is man made."

El Salvador is a capitalist country, so is Honduras, and they can be very dangerous much like Venezuela. There are successes and failures in models leaning in both directions."
news,feyxbt1,t3_eqx6oj,1579451573.0,"Sounds like bullshit. Typical fur animals are cooled off as fast as possible because even a small amount of time in a warm environment will cause the pelt to ""slip"" and reduce it's quality considerably. Boiling a cat would ruin the skin of the pelt aswell as cause the fur to fall off the pelt.

I wouldn't trust an animal rights activist group to be truthful and unbiased regarding their reports on animal welfare."

dankmemes,fepozxy,t1_fepfpj7,1579326548.0,Yes they can. The issue is if they are the ONLY one who has to pay it they can't remain competitive. Raising minimum wage forces all companies to play on a level field. The competitive edge shouldn't be gained on the backs of the most vulnerable and dispensable staff. They are the backbone of the company. Minimum wage was created to ensure that the people at the bottom level were still making a living. Complicated economic situations over the past several decades have allowed corporations to use massive revenue from tax cuts to lobby governments into preventing minimum wage from rising at the same pace as inflation. It's part of Long Term Wage Compression.

A shotgun was likely the most reasonable weapon inside a community as the distance shotgun rounds lose velocity is vastly shorter than rifles or handguns. And he was point blank in a hostage situation. He had the shot and he took it and saved lives. It's what he was fucking trained to do. Do you tell a shoemaker how to stitch a shoe? Or a doctor how to diagnose an ailment? Stay in your lane, your opinion has no value in this thread."

todayilearned,fecc171,t1_fec981d,1578970453.0,"My brother and many of my friends planted in northern Sask for 3 seasons in a row. Lumber companies make tertiary roads that go for hundreds of kilometers. They cut, then they burn, then the planters get sent in. After a couple years the roads are retaken by the forests, and after a few decades they come and cut them again. 

You're right that I'm from Ontario. I've personally spent a lot of time in northern ontario. But no, I haven't been to northern Sask, and to be honest after the stories I'm too terrified to go. Nosee'ems, black flies thick as soup, breathing mosquitoes and chasing off bears. I thought we had it bad here until my brother got back from the prairie provinces, now he thinks we're all a bunch of babies."

AskReddit,fdm3rq1,t1_fdm0hxi,1578539103.0,"Depends on the temperature when the snow falls. If it's warmer out it would be more like walking on dense wet cotton candy that compacts very tightly if stepped on. If it's blisteringly cold then it's dry and dusty and reacts like very fluffy light dry sand. It's impossible to truely explain but that's the best i can do. If you have raspado or shave ice where you come from, that's pretty much what warm temperature snow(e.g. -1c to -5c) feels like. Then if the temperature changes after the snow has fallen it can make the snow even more complex textures like hard/light sqeaky styrofoam or white ice."

There were also a series of recessions since then and many people lost the value in their houses as boom-towns turned to ghost-towns. Not to mention that people witnessing these market failures were weary of entering the market. I'm not trying to argue, just to give insight and play the devil's advocate.
