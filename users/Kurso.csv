What do you mean by 'fix' climate change? Climate change will always happen. Thats it. Full stop.  

If you can accept that (it's scientific fact so I hope you can) then we can move away from the rhetoric and discuss the real problems: human impact on the environment.  But here again, humans can't exist without impacting the environment (another scientific fact that you must accept).  

With those two facts out of the way it becomes a question not of 'fixing' climate change but how to find the right balance between between environmental impact we will always have and the need to adapt to a climate that will always change.
