This is just abuse & from what I’ve read you’re trapped...until the day you become *desperate* enough to leave...

Until then it is what is...unless you take some of these people’s advice.

You have to want to get out or nothing will change.

Competing with these people isn’t an option and isn’t healthy for you, so I hope you didn’t seek advice on how to “win” him back.

I’m going to be blunt.

If you don’t intend to leave the situation (my instincts tell you don’t mean it yet).

Better yourself & become more worthy in this toxic relationship.  :/

Find some confidence building skills.

Maybe the others will pick on you less if you’re not seen as a helpless leech.

I would start by actively pursing a job to support yourself and getting your own hobbies.


You’re the toy that has been placed on the shelf to gather dust. Donating you would be a kindness but someone like you isn’t in demand.

If you’re going to be under this man’s roof, then I would take advantage and invest in some therapy. 

This isn’t a romantic 50 shades of Grey situation, when you’re ready to leave don’t expect him to drop these subs and chase you at the airport.

He’s made it clear you’re just here so he doesn’t feel bad about you being homeless...
