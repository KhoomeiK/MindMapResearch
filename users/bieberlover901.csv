NoStupidQuestions,feu2n6z,t3_eqmcqe,1579382538.0,"The president is not voted for by the people, he is voted on by the Electoral College.  The people vote for electors.  The number of votes that a state gets is the same as their congressional representation.  Wyoming has 1 representative and 2 senators, so they get 3 electors, California has 53 reps and 2 sens, so they get 55 electors.  The electors are usually winner take all from a given state, i.e. if Trump gets 50.01% of the vote in Wisconsin he gets all 10 (8+2) electors, hence the US only has 2 viable political parties.

All that is background info to your question.  Each party has primaries to decide who their nominee should be.  If there is an incumbent that party usually just goes with their guy, with a few rare exceptions, such as Reagan challenging Ford in 1976.  Considering how much the Republican establishment disliked him in 2016 I am a little surprised that nobody has come forward to challenge Trump."
