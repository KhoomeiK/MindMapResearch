Money to fix or help the issue is just a small part of the problem. The internet believes that moving spending from the militaries of the world will fix all of our issues. But unfortunately changing the politics and infrastructure in those areas is the only way to help those issues and that takes a very long time and a lot money to do that. You know give a man a fish..."

Customer- MY FIRE ALARM IS GOING OFF AND I NEED YOU TO COME DOWN RIGHT NOW! 

Me- Are the horns and strobes going off?

Customer- No.

Me- Can you tell me what the panel says?

Customer- It says (insert basic trouble) and it's been beeping all day! (it's 9pm on a Tuesday and they probably could have called during normal business hours) 

Me- Have you tried to Acknowledge or Silence the panel?

Customer- Yes and I Reset and it just starts doing it again. 

Me- (in my head- ugh) Try just hitting the Acknowledge button. Did it stop beeping? 

Customer- Yes! 

Me- This doesn't sound like an emergency call but if you would like to get a tech out, here is our after hours rates. Would you still like for someone to come out or can I put you on the schedule?

Customer- No thanks, that's expensive, just put me on the schedule.

Me- Thanks have a nice night. 

-End scene-

Most calls are from people that have no idea what a fire alarm system is so you just need to be patient. A lot of calls you can get out of by talking them through it over the phone. I've only had to dispatch around 3 times this year, and that's usually because they had legit alarms or the system was in runaway.

I wouldn't worry about being on call unless you're company does work with 3rd parties like Commercial Fire or Cintas. They will wait days to dispatch a simple trouble and act like it is an emergency call that just came in and they will say they will pay after hours rates on the phone but not when they get the bill. 3rd party jobs are usually garbage and every company I've worked for doesn't like to take their after hours calls."
movies,fcja2lv,t1_fcix5co,1577681046.0,"I hope you told the studio that it was going to bomb.

Plus are you arguing that people shouldn't have worked on it because the studio might get rid of them latter if the movie might have bombed?

Hear that guys you should only work on successful movies from now on or don't work at all!

Look I don't think anyone is arguing that they should have made it or that they didn't spend too much money on a flop. The original statement was implying that they should have used the money to give to the impoverished and my counter was that the money wasn't wasted because people got paid to make the movie whether the studio makes its money back or not."

But you can manually turn it off by holding the PS button until it turns off or pull up the device menu by pressing the PS button for a few seconds then select the one you want to turn off.
