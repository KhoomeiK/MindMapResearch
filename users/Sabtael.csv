Archiveteam,fd5faa9,t1_fd4nzxm,1578177049.0,The tracklists are but they don't host tracks anymore since the 31 of january. If you've got an account you can convert any playlist to a Spotify playlist; been frantically doing that for the past days but man I wish the Archive Team found a way to keep all of the info (like the tags and all that)
8tracks,fczekx3,t1_fcyn1cv,1578099441.0,If only Spotify allowed to add tags to playlists...
indieheads,fcybg7g,t1_fc81ae9,1578077660.0,"Tags would be so awesome, I truly feel like that's the most important feature they're missing."
8tracks,fcy7xil,t1_fcy5z3u,1578076032.0,"You're most welcome!
I'm trying to tell as many people as I could (especially playlist creators on 8tracks, I've been leaving a comment under each playlist I save on Spotify/download the tracklist for) because I feel like Playmoss's biggest flaw is that it doesn't have that many users, but many could be interested..."
wholesomememes,fcxv5m9,t1_fcxmyvh,1578070886.0,Thanks for the warning! I'll be waiting for a moment where I'm feeling fine then. Take care!
wholesomememes,fcxm6bn,t1_fcxllwl,1578066272.0,"I don't know saying that ""something might be wrong with your hormones"" sounded kinda judgemental to me, glad to know you didn't take it this way! I haven't watched the Joker (yet, you're reminding me that I should see to that!). Keep going strong, you can do it!"
wholesomememes,fcxj9lo,t1_fcxavzl,1578064305.0,"Sometimes there isn't even a reason. Did you know newborns could get depression, purely from biological reasons, not psychological ones? It might just be that something's ""wrong"" (I'm a non native speaker so warning here this isn't the right nuance of the word but I'm hoping you'll understand what I mean) with the hormones responsible for your happiness. Something that keeps them from doing their job as they should. You might want to speak to your GP about it and perhaps get antidepressants, I've been feeling so much better since I started taking mine!"

(We would also like to ask which flavor of cake you'd like for the next meeting)"
