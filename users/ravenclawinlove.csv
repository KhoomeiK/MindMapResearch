The first time I saw them was with the entire set for something like $300...only to find out that, even at that price, they're still just paper covers on original hardcover books - not House editions through and through, as I feel you'd expect for that price.

Also, congrats on surviving the brutal recruiting season and coming out of it with a great job offer - well done! :D Definitely good reason to splurge and reward yourself with something that makes you happy. :)"

But if you really want to help on a long-term basis, I would consider adopting more than just puppies; because everyone wants those - it's the dogs that are a couple of years old, more so beyond that obviously, that have the hardest time finding a home and the greatest chance of having been abused/neglected."
relationship_advice,ff3ld7c,t3_ergb92,1579543510.0,"I'm sorry but that anti-drug initiative is a joke, right? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this but that sounds like something people would do in the 90s - not these days where kids are on their phones/tablets all day.

Your protective instincts are spot-on, and you obviously tried to help; but your son is at a precarious age and, if he's been acting weird, it's probably because he's struggling with his peers, maybe there have been other instances of bullying. IMO it was a mistake for you to take on this role without telling him about it.

What troubles me about this is that the whole point of you doing this is out of concern that he's communicating less and less...and then you basically did the same thing by not telling him you were getting involved with this initiative in the first place. Surely you can remember what social caste systems were like in your teens? How even wearing the ""wrong"" t-shirt, shoes etc. could all but derail your day and invite more than just scrutiny.

I'm not trying to be mean or unsympathetic; but I think you ""get"" his forgiveness by leading by example and communicating with him: admitting that you made a mistake (important for kids to know that adults don't always get it right either) and explaining your reasons/motivation.

I would definitely get his nails clipped at the vet because they'll know not to cut it too close to the quick; and if, for some reason, something happens, he's already at the vet. 

As far as bathing him goes - unless he's super dirty, smelly or predominantly an outside/outdoors dog, you don't need to bathe him all the time. Bathing them too often strips their skin of natural oils.

In the meantime, I would suggest trying to find ways to coax him into the bathroom without running the water at first. Go in yourself and call to him or bring his favorite toy, a treat etc. Once he feels safe in that environment, try just running the water tap, get a washcloth wet with warm water, and use that - just so that you can gauge his reaction to water. 

Shelter pets are wonderful and amazing - but you also don't know what may or may not have happened to him before. A lot of them have been abused and/or neglected, left outside in inclement weather etc. With love and patience, he'll come around; but some dogs honestly just don't like water or being bathed."

AskMen,fen2whs,t1_fen05bw,1579275774.0,"I'm the same way tbh; I need clarity and I don't like discord. Sometimes a misfire or miscommunication can get completely out of hand - it's something that I always find frustrating in movies/tv shows, where you keep watching the characters end up in ridiculous situations instead of just, you know, actually talking to each other.

I think the hard, difficult stuff is especially important not to sweep under the rug or try to avoid/ignore - because those proverbial chickens eventually come home to roost.

At least you're trying and aware enough to realize where the disconnect is, what you struggle with. Sometimes, what helps IMO is a sort of ""stream of consciousness"" approach - it may seem tedious or verbose, but if you have a hard time articulating what you want/need to say, that helps.

And, at the risk of being predictable and offering unsolicited advice - writing helps.

unpopularopinion,femrq35,t3_epzk6d,1579267703.0,"I think it depends on the purpose of the cake. Personally, I love how amazingly creative people get with cake design/decoration...but that doesn't make me want to eat or even taste any of those cakes, at all. 

Idk where you live, but personally I feel like most American cakes/desserts are WAY too sweet and synthetic tasting for my like anyway. Too much icing, buttercream, fondant or whatever; and even the cake itself often ends up tasting like a cacophony of artifice to me."
Advice,femrcec,t1_femr7a3,1579267383.0,"I know it's kinda hard being in that situation, but the only way you can find out if she's interested is if you ask. If she says she has a boyfriend or she's not interested in dating you, you can still try to be her friend if that's something you're open to. Either way, you know the old saying: nothing ventured, nothing gained :)"
depression,femr8sv,t3_epzkip,1579267295.0,"I feel the same way. I think it's because it makes you realize that you're not alone, that other people struggle with the same or similar issues."

sex,femr3tb,t3_epzklm,1579267175.0,"Not sure how this is sex-related, but I would suggest checking with your GP or ob/gyn."

Advice,femqypf,t3_epzkql,1579267052.0,"Don't worry about what this other guy would or wouldn't do; worry about yourself. If this girl doesn't have a BF, then just ask her out - no need to tell her about your feelings in more detail yet. If she agrees to go out with you, then you can take it one step at a time; if she doesn't, you'll just end up kicking yourself if you tell her how you feel before knowing whether or not she's even interested."
