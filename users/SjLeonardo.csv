Iamactuallyverybadass,fcmzyig,t1_fcm57fo,1577799154.0,"Speaking from a non-USA resident point of view, I'd go to the USA solely based on gun death numbers; much lower than here in Brazil. We don't feel safe in the streets, in schools, in our homes. If at least it would be easier to actually protect ourselves, maybe we wouldn't feel like sheep waiting around.

Also, fear? Yup, I understand perfectly well why Americans would fear losing their guns, and fear that they wouldn't be able to protect themselves like these people did at this church. If it is so intertwined with the culture, then gun control won't make anything better. Maybe educating people about guns would be better than taking them away. Again, Brazil has had gun control for some time now, and every year gun homicide numbers won't stop rising. All it did was make us more prone to being humiliated, robbed of everything we have, and killed."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcmygg3,t1_fcm4ppa,1577797629.0,"It's very hard to get guns here in Brazil, even after the current president opened it up a little bit. Let's just compare something... Both in 2017: USA saw 39,773 gun related deaths; roughly 60% of those are suicide, and 14,542 are homicide. Worst year since 1968. In Brazil, same year: gun homicides (suicide don't count towards these numbers) have been steadily rising since gun control laws passed, at first, they diminished, but in 2012, the numbers were higher than anything in the last 35 years. Brazil, 2017: 63,880 homicides by guns. Last year, 1% of guns taken by the Rio de Janeiro police were legal. The other 99% was illegal, and most of the guns were not even guns you could buy legally.

Sure, it's not an apples to apples comparison, since they're different countries, but it goes to show gun control doesn't work miracles."

People CARE because they, wrongfully, are loving AMD for this. Either way, everyone that wants to build a PC cares because all of this is just improving performance per dollar A LOT.

intel,fbxxpy5,t1_fbxwkj9,1577203205.0,"I see your point, and I get where you're coming from. I agree that parallel processing is quite hard to do, and you can't just keep splitting the load infinitely for any process. And obviously, an i7 9700K is not going to be obselete in 6 months. The time span we're talking about here is a few years. I'm looking at this from the same perspective as people who still use their i7 4770K, their i5 2500K, and plan to upgrade to another cpu that will last them a long time, or at the very least, has a path to upgrade to better processors without a platform swap."
intel,fbxq18g,t1_fbxnt8u,1577197265.0,"And having threads leftover is a bad thing? Sure, people who say 8 core 16 thread CPUs are going to quickly become bare minimum seem quite ill informed to me. But 100% CPU usage is a stutter fest. 4C/4T cpus are worse for today's games than 2C/4T were when they were the budget option a few years ago. 4C/8T and 6C/6T are next.

I also don't see your point with HT not being optimized for games. Have you seen the video in this post? Everyone used to say games don't use HT, so there was no point to buying an i7 if you're not streaming or whatever. Now look at the massive difference it makes! That's the future for 6/6 CPUs, no matter if it's approaching us quickly or not, and it would've been better to own a 6/12 CPU. You may think today's CPUs will be irrelevant when the time comes, but you can also see this with the i5 2500K vs i7 2600K, 8 year old cpus. These two have been relevant used market buys for years, and after they were rendered irrelevant for new buyers, it was still OK to use them if you already have them. If a game makes a CPU go to 100% usage, more threads will help it whether they are logical or real cores.

So I do agree, I think people are being mislead by this ""16 threads is a must"" thing. But still, I personally would prefer having 5% to 10% lower performance with a R7 3700x with double the threads than having an i7 9700K that already can be utilized to 100% by a few of the most CPU demanding games. Because today's most demanding games are going to be the average game in the future, and I would rather have leftover CPU than be pegged at 100%. I would also prefer having an i7 8700K, rather than an i7 9700K, for the same reason."
