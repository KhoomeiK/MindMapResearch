europe,ff5ph1g,t1_ff5m862,1579604727.0,Finnish buildings are very well insulated that's why the temperature at times can be that high. For most people 21C would be good indoor temperature though
europe,ff5peg5,t1_ff5moxg,1579604623.0,For me 24C would be the best. Wouldn't need to us medication

funny,feqtj6p,t1_fepw5xs,1579345855.0,I don't understand those who don't wear a helmet every time. Especially if they are new to skating. Seems like they're asking for a brain damage
EarthPorn,feo46vb,t1_feo1zu3,1579294921.0,"I don't upvote a photo because of the title. I upvote it if I like the picture. Backstory is just a plus. 

if some other people upvote based on the title, good for the original poster for making up a crazy enough story to attract people."

yoga,fekht58,t3_epktux,1579200334.0,Me and many other Finns spend time in 93C/200F sauna many times a week and I don't think there is any negative effects. As you've gone to the class for few months already I think your body is used to it.

pics,fdw0cht,t1_fdvnklv,1578753633.0,I have experience only with a small/medium consumer drone and wouldn't have thought that even bigger ones could withstand storm winds. But good to know that they can manage stronger winds! Maybe I am just too careful with my drone lol
pics,fdv8p5j,t3_en33hw,1578744715.0,"I don't think drones can take picture of a moon like that. It would be overexposed. Also drones cannot be flown in storms, even on a regular day wind can be too much that high. Depending on the area and drone, they cannot be flown in city areas."

dankmemes,fd88ed5,t1_fd84jjq,1578215175.0,"In my country to give birth costs around 38€/day. So only the hospital visit is paid, just like when I had a nose surgery it cost around that much. It doesn't matter if there is some complications - the cost is the same. And during pregnancy the mother can get free checks at the doctor. The mother will also receive a big package full of stuff for the baby (clothes, sheets, bottles, toys, hygiene products etc.) - that is also free."

LifeProTips,fd48ate,t1_fd3yise,1578165308.0,"The building is the famous railway station at Neverland. The guy said he was molested from 1988 to 1992 - until he was 14. Construction of the building started in late 1993 and it was opened in early 1994. Jackson returned to Neverland in 1995 when he finished recording his album in New York. Neverland is near Los Angeles. 

The documentary director tweeted this: “Yeah there seems to be no doubt about the station date. The date they have wrong is the end of the abuse.”"
LifeProTips,fd3slun,t1_fd3rx93,1578161340.0,I found it quite strange that the other guy said he was molested in a building that had not been built yet
