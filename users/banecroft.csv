singapore,ff2uzra,t1_ff2qv99,1579525216.0,"I should also note that I spent ¬£120 a month for taking the tube twice a day - only to have the trains not run on sundays because reasons. Not for a week. It was 3 months. 

Oh and there was also the times where during rush hour they'll literally shut down the turnstiles, nobody gets in. Because they're so crowded people are at risk of getting pushed on to the tracks."
singapore,ff2qyi3,t1_ff25zwq,1579520093.0,"GDP is a terrible measurement, even it‚Äôs creator says it‚Äôs bad and should only be used as a temporary measure. 

Are you a stay home parent looking after your kids? GDP says your contribution is zero. Volunteer at various none profits? Also zero. 

Essentially, GDP says, your worth is only as much as the amount of money you make. It‚Äôs a zero sum game and paints a picture far from the truth.
It‚Äôs also partly why we get that ridiculous ‚Äú1 in 6 Singaporeans are millionaires‚Äù tag."

Didn‚Äôt do jack shit. 

So they repealed it and now we have a 20% VAT that tax every single Apple/Amazon etc transaction. So while technically they‚Äôre still dodging their corporate taxes, each respective governments still gets a 20% cut from every sale, at every transactional point (including logistics etc, things the consumer don‚Äôt even see)"
todayilearned,felruku,t1_felnb2a,1579229387.0,"Oh it exists for sure, one simply has to look at the casual nepotism that exists in the government. However by and large the methods work, and has since it‚Äôs founding - and as a result corruption is shockingly low. Low enough that a minor bribe to a police officer makes front page news. 

If one requires more empirical evidence, the CPI is a good index - Together with Switzerland, Finland and Sweden, you‚Äôll also find Singapore sharing the ranks of least corrupt countries.

There‚Äôs a lot to complain about Singapore, though corruption is not a big one."
