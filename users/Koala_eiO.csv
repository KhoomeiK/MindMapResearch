I think we could find solutions to everything, provided a little time. Off the top of my head:  

- You could change the rotation direction by pushing in another cog (""oh so we need pistons"" I hear, yes).

- Analogic stuff could be done by using a cog speed parameter.

- Cog would be one element amongst others. We can imagine a pressure system too, with pistons, fans/air flow, maybe temperature too. Any number of elements that fit the game's theme could be added really."
