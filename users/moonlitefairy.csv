LawSchool,ff4yvyq,t3_erlukd,1579575778.0,I definitely wouldn’t get a puppy before 1L. An adult dog is much more realistic for both of you to be happy through law school.
LawSchool,ff17h5n,t1_ff02wz5,1579476032.0,"That’s not necessarily true. Some people learn best by explaining it to others and the benefit is mutual, not a charity."
LawSchool,ff0d3no,t3_er1gte,1579467748.0,"Are you in Canada? Is there an Inter-library loan program? I used that a lot in undergrad for research papers, but I'm in the US. It probably  wouldn't work for a semester long text book though."
LawSchool,ff0c4hm,t1_ff07g2b,1579467509.0,"Same. Luckily my closest friends are like that too. Sometimes I""m a bit forthcoming with things like, ""Torts was worse than I expected"" or"" after the midterm I was worried about Contacts but it turned out OK."" But nothing more specific than that."

dogs,fes8sk5,t3_eqhnvb,1579362619.0,"My mom had a shelter dog Maggie from before she met my dad. Maggie lived until i was 8. She was probably close to 20 years old! Sometime after my parents got married my dad adopted a dog from a coworker who couldn’t take care of it. That dog’s name was Sasha, which was my first word lol. Later on there was Cocoa from (my) age 9 to 21. I adopted my first dog, as opposed to a family dog belonging to my parents , Lily, when I was 29. Lily was 2 then about 5 now. If I get married and have kids, it’ll be like Maggie’s story all over again!"
LawSchool,felznf8,t3_epnlda,1579235127.0,"Open book exams can make a huge difference on the curve. I'm not a great test taker/memorizer so for me my one open book exam was my highest grade. I don't know about this past semester, but I know the same class last year had an extremely tight curve which was likely caused by it being open book, (and possibly too easy)."
dogs,fdttyd8,t3_emzve1,1578722162.0,"Renters insurance is to cover your personal belongings  like your clothes, furniture, etc. It doesn’t cover the structure of the home. If this is something your landlord wants, they need to add it to their property insurance and then they’ll probably pass on the cost to you via a monthly pet fee and/or a deposit."
travel,fdo4tbh,t3_emdqdv,1578598913.0,Check the cruise line if you’ll be able to drink on the ship or on any of their private islands. I have a feeling you won’t be. An an all inclusive hotel might be a better option for you.
LawSchool,fdmuiqo,t1_fdm7t7e,1578566431.0,I’m guessing not maintaining a minimum gpa to continue attending school.
travel,fdmu4ht,t3_em7sb4,1578565882.0,"I’m pretty sure all AA flights only fly from or to the USA, so unless you can use the voucher with a partner airline you won’t be able to go from Germany to Japan. You’d have to do something like fly to NY first I think. I hope I’m wrong and someone more travel savvy can help you find a way."

solotravel,fdi7dyl,t1_fdi41gs,1578437050.0,"To be clear it wasn’t the dairy, it’s that apparently instead of milk ice cream and syrup they also put water in milkshakes. Though I doubt dairy is all the common in India anyway. But like the other poster said, in theory you could get bad food anywhere including chains."
solotravel,fdi1ibc,t3_elhkid,1578434080.0,"I knew a guy who was like you, loved to travel but very wary of food. McDonald’s and Coca Cola were his travel diet staples, including in India. Not the way I would want to go but we all travel for different reasons and if culinary experience isn’t important to you, that’s your prerogative. One thing I’ll warn you on is milkshakes, I had another friend who was very careful of not drinking water, but apparently they put water in her milkshake at a restaurant and I guess an Indian person she talked to was confused as to why she didn’t expect that to be an ingredient."
dogs,fdhyq3g,t3_elh0h4,1578432589.0,"Are there any kids in the house or could there be in the future? My parents had a dog that attacked their other (smaller) dog and then later that dog ended up attacking one of my friends when we were 3 (who never touched the dog, my mom was holding my friend when it happened). I think that will be a big decision point for you.  Regardless I round get a trainer and behaviorist involved asap to assess the safety of the other dogs and humans in household and whether or not this is likely to happen again."
LawSchool,fdhta71,t3_elha2m,1578429761.0,The lawschooladmissions sub will probably be more useful to you
LawSchool,fdhpsvh,t1_fdgn03n,1578427759.0,Maybe they deleted it. It’s one feature of this site I’m not a fan of
LawSchool,fdfwfru,t1_fdfr0xb,1578372053.0,it's a supplemental book series for all the main law school classes
solotravel,fdeujwc,t3_ekzvu1,1578346901.0,If I could afford it I'd love to go. Going to an Olympics is on my bucket list.
LawSchool,fdeud2i,t3_ekzusm,1578346787.0,"Take even more easy As and don't take any unnecessary upper level classes even though you find them interesting. Or take them pass/fail. Don't be afraid of withdrawing, no one cares what a W looks like on a transcript, it's better than a C+. Also know that those high school college dual classes count towards your GPA in law school apps so if you need to make up those numbers (or any other lower grades), take easy summer or winter session classes online from state schools to save $. All grades from every college you ever went to count for law school admissions. You only get one shot at an undergraduate GPA."
dogs,fde7mai,t3_ekw6ij,1578332946.0,I’d get her a sweater. My dog loves her fleeces from Gooby. I get them on amazon. In the mean time maybe shorter walks more frequently might be better. Not all dogs have to go immediately after eating.
LawSchool,fde78cy,t3_ekwosa,1578332706.0,"I’d say consider yourself lucky your school counts classes that you got less than a C- in otherwise you’d be postponing graduation. You’ve come this far, you may as well finish the last semester. It’ll be tough to find jobs but not impossible and others here will have better advice than me on that. Treat your last semester like you did your  2L year and try to salvage the gpa as best you can. Good luck!"
travel,fde6o9a,t3_ekx1zn,1578332359.0,"You are basically me. I did a bunch of traveling in the year before starting law school. I second the lawschooladmissions sub, I wish I had found it before I took the lsat and started applying. Your lsat score will be much more important than your essay so if you think you have it in you to take it again before you start traveling, I highly recommend it. A few points can earn you thousands more in scholarships. I’m a bit older than you so my travel style will likely be different. I did a lot of cruises and group tours around Oceania and Asia, but I was almost always the youngest in my early 30s. I didn’t mind but you might not find that kind of company(ie retired) fun. But feel free to PM if you want to talk travel or law school admissions."
dogs,fde04m0,t3_ekvnw3,1578328151.0,"Just make sure it’s the family dog, don’t expect your 12 year old to be a full time caretaker. Also keep in mind that in 6 years if your son goes to college the dog likely won’t be going too. Since you just lost a dog I’m sure you know this all already but I think it’s an important reminder."
solotravel,fddp0jd,t3_ekqs4r,1578320034.0,Of course there’s no guarantees but NYC has not been particularly cold lately so I wouldn’t totally discount it depending on what you want to do and see. All the outdoor Christmas attractions will be down by then.

travel,fdct43y,t3_ekohf7,1578283559.0,"Call and ask. I once booked flights through a third party that wouldn’t let me pick seats but by calling the airline directly I was able to get the type of seat I wanted. It’s worth a try, especially for a long flight."
Albany,fdcrbgy,t3_ekds3w,1578282118.0,You could try some smaller concerts/shows. I’m going to one on Sunday at Cafe Lena in Saratoga. The group Sons of Serendip is performing and the tickets actually have student discounts which I was excited about. They were on America’s Got Talent. I’m sure there’s lots of other affordable shows out there too. Maybe check eventbrite for tickets to things.
dogs,fdcokuc,t3_ekiy42,1578280095.0,"I think for a regular pet it’s problematic. When I was a really young we had a husky mix my parents rescued. She was protective of them. When I was three a friend came over. My mom picked up my friend, he put his arms around my moms neck and the dog but him in the face. Obviously this is an extreme example and this particular  dog was a “project” that my parents probably should have admitted defeat on earlier, but in general to avoid protective behavior I let my dog know I’m in charge and can handle situations by stepping in front of her when she barks at someone at the door etc."
dogs,fdcme0v,t3_ekmd98,1578278510.0,When i first moved from a carpeted place to a hard wood place my dog was not happy. She would not jump up onto the couch or bed. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a big rug right away after moving so as an in between measure I bought a few bath mats and set them up in front of each couch and the bed so she could jump from a carpeted surface. It worked like a charm.
dogs,fdckxaz,t3_ekmufa,1578277462.0,I know people who have had success with their dogs losing weight by replacing half the volume of dog food with green beans so the dog still feels full while getting the necessary nutrients of dog food with less calories.
dogs,fdch3kw,t3_ekmeec,1578274739.0,"Sometimes having a well adjusted dog in the foster home is helpful for future fosters. If it feels right, it feels right, I’m sure they knew it was “your type” of dog when placing it with you. With the rescue I adopted from you applied for a specific dog so unless someone applied for the dog before you started fostering it you wouldn’t be jumping any line of your rescue works like that too. Of course there are also often dogs that need to be fostered and adopted into homes without other dogs and you’d no longer to be able to foster those. I’d talk to the rescue about their needs and that you’d still like to foster if you adopt this dog and how they think the logistics of that would work."
dogs,fdcbobf,t1_fdcar8a,1578271080.0,Agreed. Free reign on acres of land does not equal a well exercised dog. Domesticated dogs want to play with and interact with people. I’d bet my dog that lives with me in a one bedroom apartment with no yard gets more exercise each day.
travel,fdb4a0b,t3_ekfvli,1578253597.0,"I choose my cruises based on the ports. I’m 31 and last year went on an NCL cruise by myself where over 75% of the guests were over 60. I had a great time and the solo travel group welcomed me with open arms. Some wondered why I didn’t go on a Caribbean cruise with people my own age  (i went to Australia and Indonesia) but I just said for me the ship is my hotel and transportation and I was there to travel not drink and sunbathe and that was that. Since your husband is going too, I’ll doubt you’ll get questions like that."
ADHD,fdawvu0,t3_ek0p5g,1578251325.0,Have the prescription sent to a different pharmacy like a cvs so they won’t get a notification from Walgreens
ADHD,fdal9c0,t1_fd7pju5,1578247348.0,"See about going on a cruise that starts in a different country but includes Japan in the itinerary. That way you can go but you’ll never have to take your medications off the ship and into the country. Of course make sure you know the laws of those countries too (ie likely Singapore, Hong Kong, or China for Asian cruise embarkation)."
HealthyFood,fdah0lj,t3_ekg4gz,1578246032.0,"Yes when you do your own grocery shopping and cooking it is much easier to healthier the. When you are dependent on what your family makes. If you go to college and have a cafeteria it’s still easier to eat healthy that way since you have so many choices.  I found full time jobs harder since I’m top of fitting 8 hours a day, it’s very easy to get off track eating fast food for lunch"
dogs,fd00odi,t3_ejq4ug,1578111866.0,"This is a major reason why I pay for pet insurance, so I don’t have to make a decision like this based on money."
dogs,fcz32om,t1_fcz1ytr,1578092670.0,"Ah I see, so these “foster parents” aren’t associated with a shelter or rescue organization. I think that’s where the confusion came from in terms of it sounding shady. I’d be very wary and proceed with caution especially if the dogs have been exposed to other dogs, have been outside etc. It could get very expensive if the puppy were to come down with something after you adopt and it’ll already be more time consuming and expensive for you to get the puppy up to date while protecting it until the immune system develops."
dogs,fcz1s02,t3_ejmv8c,1578091934.0,Did they give a reason why the puppy hasn't had age appropriate vaccinations?
dogs,fcz193q,t1_fcyzhew,1578091665.0,"I would google standard heart worm treatment protocol. The rescue I've been involved with has the fosters crated a lot and just walked at a slow pace, nothing to elevate their heart rate, and this goes on for a few months. I would def at the very least phone your vet and ask about the wrestling."
LawSchool,fcz0wfu,t1_fcz07yx,1578091438.0,"What is the minimum GPA required at most ""good"" schools to graduate? Just curious if you have that information off hand, I don't remember what my school's minimum gpa is but I should probably look that up before grades come out lol."
LawSchool,fcyyfnn,t3_ejlwrw,1578089849.0,"A few months ago you posted that you were spending five hours doing a single assignment. Do you think there's any possibility that you might have a learning disability or a slow reading speed? You can test your reading speed by reading fiction with a five minute timer, counting the words and dividing by five. You can find averages on reading speed for various professions and students through google searches. 

Did you finish your exams? Did you feel extremely rushed? If any of this resonates maybe seeing your health care providers might be helpful before making a huge decision like dropping out. There could be accommodations available to you. I'd also take into consideration how much you are paying before deciding to go back or not (if you have a full scholarship you have less to lose by trying another semester, but depending on conditions, could you go back next year without it?), as well as what the process will be to repeat some of the classes assuming you'll need to redo a few of them at some point and how that'll effect your graduation plan."
dogs,fcyn845,t3_ejje3u,1578083207.0,"Do mental exercises with Jaco like training and puzzle toys. That should help wear him out and is safe for him while undergoing heart worm treatment. He shouldn’t be running, playing fetch, wrestling etc. until he’s done treatment. Does each dog have their own safe space like a crate or bedroom? If not that might help Coda to be able to chill and take a time out from Jaco."
dogs,fcyjotk,t3_ejjx3p,1578081206.0,"If the training treats aren't high value enough for for your dog and your parents won't buy other treats, look at what human food you have at home. Hot dogs, bacon, chicken, deli meat etc all work well for many dogs."
LawSchool,fcybkyq,t3_ejigk2,1578077712.0,I’m also very nervous about grades. Two of my professors are leaving (they’re a couple going to another school in their hometown together) so they wouldn’t fail anyone their last semester right? I need to believe that lol.
LawSchool,fcy3kqk,t3_ejihqu,1578074312.0,"Wow I though my school was tough at a B-. If you also include your class rank (even if you don't know it, you at least know you're at the 50% range) that might give some context on your resume (maybe?, don't quote me lol)"
LawSchool,fcxp2z5,t3_ejan1n,1578068158.0,My school has a two year program that starts in the spring. I believe they take 8 credits during the summer. Only about 5 people a year actually do that program though.
LawSchool,fcxor6y,t3_ej8fqk,1578067950.0,My school has a facebook group for buying and selling books. I would look at that first so you don't have to bother with shipping. Then you also know exactly how much the bookstore is charging and can price accordingly.
dogs,fcxom2f,t1_fcxi3j4,1578067859.0,Exactly this. Reasons like this is why the rescue I adopted from requires all residents of the home to be home during the home visit. Bringing that dog home was unfair to the wife and the dog.
dogs,fcxo6mn,t1_fcwqbii,1578067583.0,"Call the rescue that you got him from. Go over the contract you signed. Mine explicitly said that I was to return the dog to the rescue and not rehome, take it to the shelter, etc."
dogs,fctf6en,t3_eisuy1,1577941311.0,"Instead of taking her out for long periods of time, take her out more often. When she goes outside have treats and pretty much throw a party for her. It takes dogs a couple of days to decompress after being adopted so I wouldn't be too considered about any of the behaviors just yet, it could just be nerves."
LawSchool,fctd58w,t1_fct7s5c,1577939518.0,What did you do differently?
LawSchool,fcp6ou2,t1_fcnxukb,1577852262.0,"To clarify I was talking about two different people, one who told me peace corps volunteers had problems with clearances because of documentation, another who told me she was just dropped off without support or documentation of what she was doing. I don’t know anyone who did peace corps and now has a clearance job. I’m glad to hear it’s  not the case that people who did peace corps have problems getting clearances, but clearly since the OP asked, it’s information that is getting spread. I was just relaying what other people told me, and trying to validate that the OP’s concerns weren’t completely silly because the information is widespread, even if it might not be accurate. I hope the OP has no issues with getting their dream job. I did think it sucked when I was told that peace corps volunteers have issues since it’s not their fault if the organization isn’t documenting properly when they’re just trying to do good in the world. Again, if it’s not true, I’m glad and apologize for relaying anything inaccurate."
LawSchool,fcnv483,t3_ei6hy8,1577819031.0,My understanding from a former coworker who spent years in jobs that required high clearances (I had a few clearance jobs in my last career) that the problem with the Peace Corps is that they just drop you off so there’s not a lot of documentation to what you were doing there. My friend who was in Senegal confirms that happened to her. But  i don’t know for sure that’s true in how it effects backgrounds checks. It’s certainly worth looking into though and perhaps start collecting documentation of the projects you worked on if possible.
dogs,fcnct8z,t3_ei4i40,1577808951.0,"I know the rescue I got my dog from gives themes to litters. Galapagos may have an island theme. The funniest one was the “royal carbs”. Names included things like Her royal highness Challah, the Duke of Bagel, King Wonderbread etc lol"
dogs,fchq5d3,t3_eh28iw,1577652953.0,Take him with you. The second you mentioned that they hit him my mind was made up that he can’t stay. I’ve moved my dog multiple times and am currently in law school and it hasn’t been a problem. You should start socializing the dog now. An in person trainer even if it’s just one session is likely necessary to get started. The dog will have to meet any potential roommates first with interactions closely observed and they shouldn’t be alone with just the roommate for awhile. Crate training would likely be a big help here. You may need to get a dog walker as new school continues and you are spending long hours in a hospital.
travel,fchnmxm,t1_fcg4u1m,1577652108.0,I’m pretty sure as long as all together it’s under 20lbs both cats can go in the same carrier. You don’t pay for service animals nor put them in carriers. It’d just be the cats that would have a fee.
travel,fcg47g5,t1_fcejopd,1577636370.0,"I think with one being a service dog they can, but it’ll probably be very difficult to manage regardless of airline rules."
dogs,fcg3mey,t3_eh518w,1577636216.0,"I know lots of people in the DC area with staffy mixes living in an apartment. You need to be prepared to go on multiple long walks each day in all weather to tire them out. You also need to be prepared to have a hard time finding an apartment (or rental house) because many will have breed restrictions. This likely means you will end up paying a lot more in rent. At the end of the day it really depends on the temperament of the dog itself, not the breed if apartment living can work without a yard. How the dog walks on a leash will be huge. How the dog deals with being alone. If it barks all day that will be a problem for your neighbors. If it’s reactive towards kids and other pets please remember things like hallways, elevators , lobbies  etc are part of the apartment experience. If you’re unsure, maybe do a test run by staying at a dog friendly hotel for a few days."

LawSchool,fbyy4h5,t3_ef8ll9,1577229516.0,"I have no idea what the issue is in this story and really glad my final exams didn’t read like this, with that said, we are law students, we can’t give legal advice since we aren’t lawyers."
solotravel,fbwnw4i,t3_eemn15,1577154829.0,"As a law student and fellow solo traveler, I would go look at the 2020-2021 academic schedules for all the schools you applied to and be prepared to have returned at least a week before the earliest orientation date. You will want time to settle in before orientation starts.  Remember you may also need to find a place to live, so if you don't have that arranged before your trip you'll need time to do that too."
