Added: It's also not necessarily the drug but what's in the drug and what happens to the body when the drug is taken. and back to the weed it depends on the strain and how much paranoia you get from it because like how there's golden apples, red delicious, granny smith or different colors of the same species of flower and so on...there are different types of cannabis so the effects/affects vary."

I just do my own computer upgrades and crap so read a little as i do and have basic knowledge. From my understanding the video or graphics cards give you computer extra memory so it can play and watch better graphics and what's on the screen moves cleaner so to speak. The regular RAM allows you to run programs quicker and use more than one at once without lag as well as use more powerful programs
