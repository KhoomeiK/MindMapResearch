jobs,ff7xza2,t1_ff7jgff,1579661028.0,"I've had other jobs where I've worked late before, but the difference is I either got paid overtime for it, or it wasn't expected - it was the worker's choice if they wanted to stay late. But with this job, it's expected of everyone to stay late pretty much every night. I'm in the process of looking for another job because of other reasons, and I'm hoping to find something where the manager has maybe a different mindset."
jobs,ff7hpit,t1_ff7ha15,1579649806.0,"My manager has made it a point to say things like youâ€™re not dedicated enough if you donâ€™t stay late. I think itâ€™s because my supervisor is always staying late, but he doesnâ€™t do anything during the day. Heâ€™s either reading articles, doodling, or on his phone. Everyone else works without an issue. He works until 10pm so he expects everyone else to."
jobs,ff7gxly,t1_ff75vs8,1579649294.0,This. This is exactly how my current manager is. Itâ€™s sad.

thisisus,fefoyh3,t1_fefmmh7,1579061194.0,"What made me think he might be imagining it was specifically them showing those dreams he was having. I really haven't read anything about the second half of the season, so I honestly don't know if Dan has said anything."

Anxiety,fef0l1o,t3_eonw76,1579045362.0,"Yep, I deal with this all the time and it doesnâ€™t help that I have ADHD so I occasionally get the hyper fixation on certain things. I think everyone in my immediate family is tired of hearing about Anthony Bourdain at this point lol."
AskReddit,fdhupou,t1_fdhtnh1,1578430480.0,Seriously. I just googled to make sure what I read about him a day ago was correct. Get the facts straight before posting something.

bipolar,fcyzl37,t3_ejhmz1,1578090591.0,This brightens up my day because honestly reading these memes have been making me nervous especially the ones about drafting. Which realistically I doubt it'll happen but when you already have anxiety it makes matters worse.

Anxiety,fcuqn1u,t1_fcun670,1577986531.0,"Thanks, and the same to you as well. If I can find a job I enjoy and that doesn't cause much anxiety, I think I'll be okay. I was really hoping to have another job lined up before my Christmas break ended but alas, that didn't happen. I'm hoping to find something within the next month, though. I don't know how much longer I can hold out here."
Anxiety,fcumz8j,t3_eiyb5d,1577984467.0,"Thanks for this. I'm struggling because I'm trying to find a new job and just don't feel motivated to do anything. I really struggled to come in today because of anxiety. I made it though, so I guess that's a plus."

AskReddit,fc1swlo,t3_eflpka,1577328683.0,"When I had a breakdown early this year. I never experienced such anxiety, panic, and depression all at once. I went almost a full month with having constant anxiety and panic attacks. I'm stable now with the help of medication and therapy, but still wish that sometimes I wasn't at a constant battle with my mind. It's exhausting."
