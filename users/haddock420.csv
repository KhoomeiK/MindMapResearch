Transcription,feeywm9,t3_eot51s,1579044269.0,"Transcribing on a phone sounds like it'd be many times slower than on a PC. I'm pretty sure that there are no professional transcribers that transcribe on a phone.

I'd recommend using ExpressScribe to handle the playing and pausing of audio and transcribe on your PC in a word processor like Word.

With ExpressScribe (or any other transcription program) you can use keys like F2 and F3 to play and pause so it doesn't break up your typing much.

If you've got a lot to transcribe or you're going to be doing this regularly, it might even be worth getting a cheap second-hand foot pedal which means you can use the pedal to pause/play without moving your hands from the keys.

Either way, I'd definitely transcribe on a PC rather than a phone, I doubt you'd get much done with how you're doing it on the phone."
