Water jet can also still generate enough force to knock apart a bad slab a lot of times.

E: and just in case your interested. Other advantage of WJ over blade is that if machines aren't well kept then the blade can start to have a bit of lateral wobble as it cuts. This causes the kerf (width) of the cut to increase and can create ""chattering"" along the cut edge. Basically fine tiny chips of stone coming off so the cut is not smooth."

If the granite guys can't find a matching slab that was cut from the same block then homeowner will be well within their right to demand that every top is ripped out and replaced so everything matches. 

For the granite installer this can easily turn into having to purchase whole new slabs to recut the entire kitchen, paying for the damage to the cabinets, and paying for the damage to what looks like a new wood floor under the paper. 

If there's a larger GC involved that's coordinating you, the granite people etc. then the granite installer could also now be subject to financial penalties for delaying completion of the project.

Wellthatsucks,femy1sg,t1_femrcd3,1579272553.0,"This breakage would have happened as the installers tried to tilt the slab from a vertical orientation to horizontal. 

That metal thing at the top of the photo is a carry clap but it only works when carrying the slab vertically. 

For some reason they didn't leave supporting material at the sink cutout like they did for the one on the right and the fact that part of the broken top is on the counters and the other part is on the floor tells me they didn't properly tilt the thing in unison. 

Double hit is that the floor under the paper where the vertical piece landed is probably fucked up too."

You see those two triangles in the top he's sitting on? That's going to be a cutout. A lot of time they leave a chunk of stone attached like that in order to make it safer to handle and transport and then cut that last bit off once the stone is in place. 

For some reason they did not do that with the sink cutout on the broken piece. 

You wonder how that could have happened? Lack of support at the cutout and everyone wasn't ready to make the transition from vertical to horizontal."
