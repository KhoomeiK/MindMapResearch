Fuck. I wasn't even there and I'm frustrated. I remember years later one kid refused to test the alternator off my corvette because it was ""special"". No kid. It's just like any other gm alternator."

Shitty_Car_Mods,ffaaq0f,t1_ffa64j6,1579731205.0,Pretty much. You'd be amazed how many peoples rear brake lines rust out and they just cap them off.
Reprap,ffaa645,t3_esirml,1579730890.0,3d printing the whole frame is silly so most designs don't use a 3d printed frame. My personal recommendation is the hypercube evolution.

SiouxFalls,ff9tvvv,t3_es9jgs,1579721179.0,Be thankful that power was knocked out by a goose. It's either tripping out a section or blowing up a transformer. You probably would still be without power if the latter happened.
volt,ff9ssiw,t1_ff9qrzu,1579720467.0,I mean maybe if the car you're throwing around sucks you don't have to. The volt is tight and fairly balanced from the factory. It's not at all stressed by normal driving. You definitely have to push the limits to feel it out on the street.
SpaceXLounge,ff9po3h,t1_ff8tvie,1579718155.0,It all happens in under a second. Elon explained the sequence several times now. Abort signal > superdraco pressurization starts + engines start shutting down > superdracos fire and separation happens as soon as pressurization happens. Effectively the capsule is leaving regardless. It just tries to make things easier before it does.

Shitty_Car_Mods,ff9i1zt,t1_ff91jg0,1579713467.0,Come to the Midwest. We also have no inspections AND salt. I used to own a f250 where the passengers feet would get wet when you hit large puddles. It just came in through the rust holes in the floor. God I miss that truck.
Justrolledintotheshop,ff9hkba,t1_ff97vpw,1579713164.0,Hate to break it to you but the steering system after the rack / steering gear is considered suspension in just about everyone's books.
volt,ff9ev6z,t3_es5hqb,1579711510.0,First generation volts have a problem where the PCV valve in the valve cover fails. There's a good chance that that is the source of your vacuum leak. There are YouTube videos that show you where to put your finger to feel if it's leaking.
teslamotors,ff9e6du,t1_ff97k97,1579711074.0,It's incredibly stupid no doubt but I'm pretty sure Tesla already has to do that with Texas or something like that. I believe California works with them to effectively let them title the vehicle without actually selling it and paying for a real title and all of that jazz. Effectively California helps them sidestep this problem.
volt,ff9dk2d,t3_es50zr,1579710665.0,Cars get worse gas mileage when they are operating in very cold weather. This happens to all vehicles. There is no software update that affects this on the volt.

teslamotors,ff99ryd,t1_ff8hz6y,1579708097.0,I Loved the one article I read. It opened with saying flat out that a short seller was accusing Tesla of unintended acceleration. And it ended saying that it specifically was started by someone who had a financial interest in Tesla doing badly.
SpaceXLounge,ff98r72,t1_ff8bpcp,1579707455.0,Imagine saying that just a few short years ago. You would inspire multiple levels of confusion.
SpaceXLounge,ff98mvc,t1_ff81xc5,1579707378.0,I wonder how long that rule is going to last. Soon enough you will be nervous to use a brand new booster. You will want the one that has flown 20 plus times.

technology,ff97sh8,t1_ff8heba,1579706831.0,I mean. You really need support on only one server. Then you download the service pack proliant and run it on all of them. Or pirate the service pack proliant. Really fucking stupid on HPs part either way.
Autos,ff92b5f,t1_ff7mxyx,1579703097.0,If the car is naturally aspirated and wasn't intentionally gimped there actually isn't much they can change for the engine that will actually improve anything. On gasoline cars generally speaking the emissions and fuel economy get better as the power and drivability get better. From a tuning perspective at least. Now on modern turbocharged vehicles there can actually be huge gains because manufacturers don't want to push too much boost in but obviously in the aftermarket people do it anyways.

volt,ff7ezh4,t3_es21fk,1579648013.0,Would need someone to poke around with scan data. My money is either on the battery heating loop being unhappy or something smashed up front since the onboard charger is right under the passenger headlight.
teslamotors,ff7d5sk,t1_ff7carc,1579646808.0,Maybe could at night. That's about it though. How low can you set the amps when 240v charging?
teslamotors,ff7bnpv,t1_ff7ab83,1579645700.0,Yikes. It would be a struggle to even charge at 8amps.
volt,ff6xft2,t3_erxnsn,1579636877.0,"My 2014 gets 10.2 in the winter and 10.8 in the summer. Usable KWH per the energy screen. My miles per kwh average 2 in the winter and 4 in the summer.

Usable KWH is a indicator of health to some degree but it can be fuzzed by the cars buffer zones. Scantool can help you see these percents but I dont know where to find the ""new"" battery buffer percentage numbers to compare to. It will change by model year I believe."
tifu,ff6nt4q,t1_ff5ti25,1579631152.0,It would have cost you $0 to not say that.
teslamotors,ff6ls64,t1_ff6kqeo,1579629920.0,Your statement is confusing at best... Your saying stranded can carry more (it can't). But my point was that your worried about a couple percent in the extension cord when your probably losing more than that in the house. Basically what I'm saying is pick your battles. This one isn't worth worrying about.
teslamotors,ff6limp,t1_ff6l1bd,1579629756.0,Ooo yeah that's pushing it. I assumed you were still running at 12 amps.
Starlink,ff6l7a4,t1_ff3nlx9,1579629564.0,If they build in wifi and router functionality hopefully it can be fully and completely disabled. I have literally NEVER seen a router modem combo that wasn't complete trash.
teslamotors,ff6kswq,t1_ff6jeim,1579629327.0,"Gotta remember that your method isn't ""safe"" for regular people. Even though electrically it's perfectly fine. I also use an adapter to feed 240v into a standard extension cord for my car. But I have a big warning label on it because it would blow the ass out of many normal things if someone mistakenly plugged a 120v appliance in with the adapter."
volt,ff6kjj5,t1_ff6hnsz,1579629167.0,Weird. The switch is a simple open / closed contact so with it unplugged it should assume it's open which would explain why the engine was running. Idk why it wouldn't alert you though. I would have to check the diagram but I'm guessing it's more likely that the bcm was ignoring it since it powered up with it open and it never closed so it assumes that feature isn't equiped. Gm likes to reuse parts so this is not unexpected.
volt,ff6kboe,t1_ff6gdmk,1579629032.0,"It's not dead. The volt locks away plenty of battery. Also the volt does not heat the battery when the vehicle is turned off and unplugged. Ever. At all. Even with a full battery. Common misconception. This isn't a Tesla where it has to be warm and ready to work. It only needs to be warm enough to start the ICE. That magic number is -15f. Below that you get a ""too cold to start plug in to warm message"". I have left mine out in -30f weather overnight before. Battery was -10f the next morning. Car started and worked fine. Just had no battery available for the first 15 minutes. 

Cooling is different though. The volt will use battery power to cool itself when shut off and unplugged."
teslamotors,ff6jtw2,t1_ff6j56p,1579628731.0,Exactly.
teslamotors,ff6jt87,t1_ff6btry,1579628719.0,How is it underrated? 12 gauge wire is rated for 20 amps. The Tesla will pull 12. You lose less than 5 volts. Your car won't even care. I would bet a large sum of money that many outlets in your house have wire runs that are longer than 100 ft and they only use 14 gauge wire.
volt,ff6jmc3,t1_ff6bjqq,1579628602.0,Still plenty of sidewall here. This is a Chevy volt not a Corvette.
teslamotors,ff6jh5v,t1_ff6a228,1579628516.0,No. Like I said. Your using conduction with more steps. Your efficiency differences are going to be conduction through a single layer of leather vs not. Which is arguably required to distribute the heat in a safe manner anyways. Plus your driver for the induction coil will also lose efficiency and unless it's embedded in the seat (bad idea) that heat will be wasted.
volt,ff6j8jt,t1_ff67gz6,1579628371.0,Not really a factor in this case. Plenty of sidewall on these with reasonable dimensions so ride quality should be the same. Acceleration and handling aren't going to be noticable on a Chevy volt. On a Corvette sure.
teslamotors,ff681ah,t1_ff61min,1579621323.0,Another fun one is if you have to charge at a place powered by a generator. A friends mountain home sometimes has to run from generator power when snow covers the solar panels and he isnt there to clear them off. Neutral and ground are not bonded in that situation for a variety of reasons. Car thinks it has no ground. Found that out with my aunts Nissan Leaf. I cheated and jumpered ground and neutral in the outlet temporarily so she could make it home.
teslamotors,ff67mat,t1_ff65g2l,1579621047.0,It would not be since humans are not metal. So it would be induction heating your iron mesh underwear which then conductive heats your  bits.
teslamotors,ff67hhp,t1_ff60s48,1579620958.0,Gotta remember a 50-100ft cable gets heavy. For how rare 120v charging is for most I think 12 gauge is fine for 100ft and 14 gauge is fine for 50 ft. I say that from experience of doing both. Is it super efficient? No. Is it perfectly safe? Yes. There will be some heat loss just like any other electrical cable. Not a big deal.
teslamotors,ff674j5,t3_errrfz,1579620715.0,"I always cringe when I hear ""We couldnt charge while we were parked 50 feet away from 120v outlets so we stressed and struggled to reach a supercharger"". Seriously. Get a 100ft extension cord and a nice bag. Keep it in the car. Over the weekend you could have gotten 180 miles of range from that 120v charger and probably skipped the supercharger all together."
volt,ff63or3,t3_ernjab,1579618345.0,"My guess is you have some kind of fault with the ICE so its ""unavailable"". I bet before you ran out of battery the gauge cluster showed LOW range next to the fuel gauge even though there was plenty of fuel in it. Thats the volts way of saying ""The ICE is broken"". Pull codes and report back. I doubt its a 12v battery issue since you said that you tried jumping it. FYI the car uses the traction battery to start the engine. There is no 12v starter. But a dying 12v can cause all sorts of weirdness."
volt,ff63bmi,t3_erv6tb,1579618084.0,"Nothing you mentioned would hurt the traction battery. I highly doubt anything is wrong with it. 1st gen volts had issues with the electric heater, the selector valve, and the pump. If any one of the three fails you wont have electric heat. Take it to a dealership and have them diagnose it."
volt,ff636a5,t3_ermu3n,1579617975.0,Did you not notice the message on the dash saying hood open?

volt,ff62z1h,t3_erp5a1,1579617827.0,"Looks good with the black accents of the volt. I dont like most of the awful rims people put on ""normal"" cars like the volt but these look like some thought was put into them."

volt,ff4olpz,t1_ff4kzts,1579568687.0,Do you live in an area where following 6ft from the car in front of you while going 65mph is commonplace? If not I wouldn't bother.
volt,ff4ofw3,t1_ff4nfuy,1579568573.0,"Neat. Doesn't change the fact that I witnessed with my own two eyes the abs based limited slip failing to work consistently while traction control was off. That means that there are situations where one or the other is better. 

The manual for a corvette says to put it on a battery tender if it sits for more that a few weeks even though the engineering standards wont let them release the car if it cant sit for 6 months + without a charger on it. The manual is wrote by bean counters and marketing wanks. Not engineers."
volt,ff4o4km,t1_ff4njam,1579568349.0,There can be pending and history codes. Neither of which will turn the light on.
volt,ff4kdqy,t1_ff4glq7,1579565729.0,People act like its some high quality super necessary thing. In reality its chicken wire with some auto zone molding around it that solves a problem that largely doesn't exist. People in Cali and other places where riding ass is the only way to drive on the interstate tend to catch rocks into the radiators on ALL cars and ruin them. Volts have expensive front radiators so people notice it more in the wallet area. Im not saying that some chicken wire wont help prevent this if you live in one of those places. Im just saying that you shouldn't buy a volt screen when some chicken wire will fix it.
volt,ff4dml7,t1_ff4csvm,1579561118.0,Huh. Maybe just a fluke.
volt,ff4dl8l,t1_ff4cfzg,1579561093.0,No. Not really. Maybe thats a VW thing. Even my 26 year old f250 pops off and is immediately smooth in sub 0f weather. . So is my volt. So is my parents caddy and gmc acadia. So is just about every car I see regularly.

volt,ff4camu,t3_erfssg,1579560241.0,You need to scan for codes and go from there. There are 100 different things that could cause that. The only thing I can glean from what you have said is the car runs better once it falls into closed loop.
volt,ff4c2lk,t1_ff3u744,1579560097.0,Thats because it would be an engineering nightmare requiring the replacement of nearly all of the electronics in the vehicle. Buying a full ev would be much better.
volt,ff4c0dg,t1_ff3feja,1579560057.0,"On an older car you might be right. On a volt however there is no idle stabilizer, no idle air control actuator, and the 02 sensors arent active for the first few seconds of running."
volt,ff4bmzw,t1_ff495lz,1579559822.0,"Yikes. You must have been beating on it hard. Differential pin failure in the snow is the classic sign of ""This person was doing a one wheel peel far too fast for far too long"". When only one wheel is spinning the center pin of the differential has to spin very rapidly and it has no lubrication system so it will not tolerate you spinning the wheel very fast for very long. Thankfully the volt and just about every gm product made in the last 15 years will pulse the abs to keep both wheels spinning and prevent exactly that from happening. The engine computer in every gm product made since the late 90s also monitors it and will cut engine power to keep you from hurting it. In the computer they call it ""Differential anti score"" in the ""Drivetrain abuse"" section. 

As you found out. Dodge has exactly zero of these protections. Gotta take it easy!"
volt,ff4b2y9,t1_ff47qou,1579559471.0,It can. Depends on the situation. The car is better at pulsing ABS to keep both wheels spinning when traction control is enabled. I know that from getting to watch the wheels spin a whole bunch and trying it on and off as well as trying to disable stability control. Sometimes you need wheel spin to dig though.
volt,ff4ax6y,t1_ff43tsq,1579559368.0,It is not. Mine was a a correlation error between the input and output speed sensors in the drive unit.
teslamotors,ff4arpu,t1_ff2wfgf,1579559272.0,I mean. One of his companies just had a massively public massively important test of safety systems that are going to be used to protect human lives as he launches people into orbit.... literally into orbit. I was stressed out and im not even remotely involved.
volt,ff43b9y,t1_ff417ip,1579554619.0,Might be a fluke but that's a wheel speed sensor code. Those usually mean abs wire or wheel bearing.
carporn,ff3ydfp,t3_erexyr,1579551546.0,The mustang with the jacked up rear posted this weekend should take notes from this setup. Gorgeous.
IdiotsInCars,ff3xgv7,t1_ff3ubtb,1579550984.0,Weird. I know gm products it is usually spring loaded from off to auto. You can pulse it off but can't keep it there. They stay off until the next drive cycle.
volt,ff3xcu7,t1_ff3tsqa,1579550914.0,I don't remember specifically. I know it was one of the transaxle speed sensors and not ABS. I just googled it quick and when I saw that it made sense that I had pissed it off so I cleared it. Have gotten similar things before on other gm vehicles like the prndl sensor and whatnot when rocking.
IdiotsInCars,ff3s7iy,t1_ff3qab8,1579547714.0,Yikes
IdiotsInCars,ff3o1ur,t1_ff3nl3l,1579545170.0,Yep. Yet people wonder why many appliance cars that have a gauge cluster that only shows you your speed and then 30 idiot lights. Its because they hope the idiot will notice that a light is on and thats 100% more things on the cluster than normal.
volt,ff3nwsu,t3_er19pr,1579545085.0,Software updates just happen through the obd plug.
IdiotsInCars,ff3nbav,t1_ff3kozx,1579544720.0,Does it have factory HIDs? Those I can understand since it's something that should last 10+ years.
IdiotsInCars,ff3n8gx,t1_ff3kzs0,1579544671.0,That requires thinking. There are a huge number of people who only look at the speedometer and beyond that couldn't tell you what anything else on the cluster says or means at a given point in time.
IdiotsInCars,ff3n3zp,t1_ff3i0ks,1579544593.0,They have no idea what's going on. They can see so they don't think beyond that.
IdiotsInCars,ff3n1xr,t1_ff3lrky,1579544559.0,Yep. It's called twilight mode. Supposed to make it easier to see where you are walking.
IdiotsInCars,ff3mzrw,t1_ff3irmi,1579544521.0,Even then. Most cars reset to auto after you turn them off.
volt,ff31yhb,t3_er1rms,1579531552.0,"Nope. Prius does that to sneak past some tricky emissions regulations. There is little to no benefit to the driver. The volts engine coolant system is fairly normal. Conventional water pump moves coolant through a radiator and the engine block. Where it gets weird is that the heater loop goes through an electric pump, then the heater core like normal but then hits a selector valve that picks either the engine or an electric heater. If your in electric only heat mode it just loops through the E heater > E pump > heater core > selector valve. If your in engine assisted heat mode it goes engine block > E pump > heater core > selector valve. Electric heat mode is self explanatory. Engine heat mode will only run the engine when the coolant temp drops and then when it runs it only runs long enough to heat it back up but not enough for it to enter the radiator."
