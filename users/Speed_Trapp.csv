      I wasted a good many eggs chasing wandering dick. I’m almost 30, no kids, and we won’t be in a financial position for us to have kids for a while due to local politics. All that aside, this is bigger than just his dick. This is your future of your family. He needs to understand that.

       Now I’m not saying to go in there screaming about babies, by no means, especially if it wasn’t discussed, but you have a right to know what he plans on doing with your investment. If he can’t understand that, then there’s no hope.

It fucking sucks. We made it through, I was partially at fault for the declination of our relationship I checked out emotionally and didn’t communicate, so far we’ve been doing alright but it took a lot of work on both our ends and we still have a way to go.

It’s *possible* but you both need to have a sit down and talk, because despite whatever “checking out” may be at play, this is not excusable on his part. This isn’t okay, and he needs to understand that there is absolutely no more trust, and that he needs to help facilitate your healing. 

It needs to be a two-way conversation. If he shoves off all blame on you, and you know you’ll never emotionally get past this or address any potential underlying relationship issues, then I recommend you count your losses.

I still have waves of jealousy since the affair. We were going on 3 years and he’d been sexting a married woman for all 3 years. It nearly ruined me. She meant nothing to him but an escape, and I wasn’t perfect either. So yeah, it’s a long hard ride.

blackfishing,ff559dm,t3_end7hx,1579580608.0,"I can’t speak for people who literally are white and think they’re black.

Boomers bullshit dying off has a lot to do with it. Any trend that becomes the social popular trend will be followed. The same goes for styles. White boomers would often shame their kids for “trying to be black” for partaking in hip hop culture. Quite frankly I love it and it’s a great outlet. My parents weren’t one of those boomers, but I had to watch my shit when I went to a white southern school.

There was a mixed girl named amber, she looked very white, but the skin was that milky tan white, and you could tell she was mixed up close, a beautiful young woman inside and out. She was dating this black young man. A nice young man, who she went to prom with. They were dancing and got split up. That school was shit. It’s just an added bonus that the white married principal was fucking the mixed coach, yet allowed that shit to go down. That’s downright appropriation. She’ll screw the mixed man but won’t respect or stick up for the culture. 

Anyways, I tried braids, they’re beautiful...but not right to the head because it irritates my psoriasis. Plus, it took a long time and didn’t last long in the back of my head where I have a different texture than the rest of my hair. 

I also have a grill for my bottom teeth I don’t wear anymore, that I got because it was a sparkly popular hip hop trend, which as an added bonus, replaced my crooked teeth cheaper than braces, and though I’m very white, and do not tan, I have been accused of “acting black” because my poetry/rap obsession, but that’s just what moves me. It helps me cope in this southern, corrupt and oppressive police state, particularly in my parish, where apparently, driving at night or during the day with a little tree in your visor is a crime so they run people out of town, make up lies, search you, try to fuck you and keep you from getting jobs figuring you won’t be able to contact their wives if you can’t pay your phone bill.

Anyways, I wasn’t accused of acting black by black people, but by boomer white people who thought black culture was a pejorative thing. It’s becoming less and less down here, mostly because it’s becoming less acceptable and more easy to be exposed and doxxed for racism with the internet.

Most of this young generation always loved the culture, even when it doesn’t love us, and I won’t change in that regard. It’s just that we weren’t allowed to love it. So that’s why you see white people wearing braids and listening to hip hop.  Everything that becomes a trend will be copied by popularity pirates. Some people just love something and hate who they are and take it to crazy extremes.

With that said, pretending to be something you’re not will never be okay. In cases like Lyldoll though, perfectly acceptable, because that’s who she became to escape her own hell. Onision hated black girls, hip hop, “ghetto shyt” and look at the ex he groomed when she was 15 now calling Chris Hansen and becoming a hip hop sensation.

Also, the white folks in the American hip hop industry has no problem trying to end white people’s careers for not being black enough, yet they do the same shit to “aggressive black rap” on important issues, so they flood the market with irrelevant shit... it’s sick."

“So you think God wants you to lie to your kids and protect them from the fact that snails are literally transgender.  Nice virtue dump.  It sucks that people inject God into their own personal will when the Bible never once mentions mental illness or the physical chemical imbalanced transgenders. Keep chasing people away from God and accepting faux praise for a well intended bad deed. Everyone has their reward. It’s people like you that had my favorite shows kicked off the air that I’d watch with my mom, all because you people thought it was against God for a television 📺 alien to carry a purse and not have breasts. How about quit making everything to do with children so sexual? Like really, what’s wrong with your head? 

You’re going to withhold things that exist in the world from your child, and it’s going to make them intolerant and fearful. Lord forbid they actually are transgender and grow up to fear Gods love and hate themselves, and not be able to turn to you because of all the bitter bias in your heart. If an anatomically correctly gendered snail is going to make your toddler have a drastic change of sex preference or a mental illness, something else is deeply wrong with them and that’s your fault.”"
