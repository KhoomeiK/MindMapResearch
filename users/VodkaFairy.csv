FemaleDatingStrategy,fdivgve,t1_fdhv1is,1578451947.0,"When we dine together, my husband won't go places that don't have good vegetarian options, even when it's his birthday. He is insistent that I should be able to have something good. 

Its not that hard to cater to specific diets these days. If someone makes a fuss about it on the first date it won't improve later, they won't respect your choices at some future date."

I personally love being married and love my husband but I don't blame people who don't want to take on the extra work of being a wife. Getting six months to only worry a out yourself and your own needs sounds like a lovely (if long) vacation to me."
