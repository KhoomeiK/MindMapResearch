DecidingToBeBetter,fdkj6we,t3_eluvbz,1578504847.0,Thank you! Same to you :) I hope you have an excellent and productive week!
BettermentBookClub,fdk74nn,t3_elhsq7,1578497599.0,"Will also spam-advocate for Meditations and Enchiridion here.


Aurelius and Epictetus seem to be much more direct in their conveying of wisdom, whereas Seneca tends to meander a lot and you have to pan for the gold nuggets. Granted, this is probably because Seneca is writing letters to his friend Lucilius. 


I read about half of Letters and then just haven't picked it back up again. May do so after reading this. Thank you, OP, for taking the time yo read and post your insights."
DecidingToBeBetter,fdhmhwe,t1_fdhl2h7,1578425786.0,"Thank you for that. Yes, I think most people do have that trouble. By nature, all animals choose ""the easy way"" to conserve energy, but avoidance (in this context) in today's society doesn't do us much good. You gotta eat the frog, I think is the saying -- basically, suck it up and get it done. You'll do future you a favor.  


On the dentist thing, I'm with you there, too. Scheduling a dental check is my biggest goal of January 2020. Face up, schedule that appointment, and, most important, go! Like you said, it's been built up in your mind as a big deal, but the sooner you go, the smaller it really is. :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,fdhjckc,t3_elfcqi,1578423874.0,"I did this same thing late last year, and it was such a *huge* relief. 

My student loans had been in default for over four years. To anyone in the same boat, don't wait that long! The interest you accrue is something to be reckoned with. They'll work with you on making payments according to your current income -- my first payments were $6, but they help you get back on your way to getting your loans back in good standing.


Congratulations, OP! Knock that list out piece by piece, and sleep easy at night! Wish you the best!"
getdisciplined,fcuwvl3,t1_fcuvgqj,1577990153.0,"I would add that discipline is like a muscle, and you want to start small. You can modify your script later, but try just adding one or two small things at a time (""I will floss every night before bed"", ""I will cut out soda"", etc.) and then once you've got those down, you can add more things to work on.

If you try to do too much and completely change your life all at once, you will fall short quite a bit, which can be very de-motivating and you might want to give up entirely. Start small, strengthen the muscle, and then work your way up.

On that same note, you *will* fall short sometimes. You just will; you're human and can't do everything perfectly every time. I am that way, Terry Crews is that way, Mother Teresa was that way. My favorite thing to tell myself is ""Tomorrow is a good day to try again."" (because you will never actually fail until you give up)"
getdisciplined,fcuv6ca,t1_fculu2q,1577989190.0,I would argue small consistent action is the only way to self discipline.
naturalbodybuilding,fcubrbo,t1_fcu15e3,1577977272.0,"I find tracking super tedious, so what I tend to do is eat one or two of the same meals for anywhere from a week to two months. I will put in a couple hours of figuring out the nutrition profile and then for the rest of the time I eat those meals, I know what's up.


It's worth noting that this works for me because:
1. I practice intermittent fasting (only one or two meals a day), and
B. I don't easily get meal boredom.


If this does not fit your lifestyle at all, MyFitnessPal is outfitted with tons of stuff designed to make it easier for you to log your intake, you just gotta give it a wide margin of error."
Stoicism,fcqyudl,t1_fcqktvx,1577894264.0,"Thank you. That Greek translation is much more suitable, and so much more poetic and meaningful."
getdisciplined,fcqyb33,t3_eiiyxg,1577894037.0,"Thank you for these. Some of my favorite Epictetus quotes are up there. My reading for this morning gave me this nugget:


""If you pursue the matter at hand along the straight path of reason, advancing with intensity, vigor, and grace, and without being distracted along the way; if you keep your Divine Spirit pure and blameless, as though this were the moment to give it back; if expecting nothing and fearing nothing, you are content to act in accord with nature and speak with heroic honesty --- then you will live well. And no power on Earth can stop you.""


Hopefully it inspires you as much as it does me. Give your best in this upcoming year -- you've got it in you and you only have to decide to take control of your self and direction! Happy and Fulfilled 2020 to you!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fcokvam,t1_fcoj1iu,1577834787.0,"Unfortunately, Instagram has been shown to be one of the most damaging media forms. 


This part is simply me projecting and not part of the study, but I'd argue it's due in part to our perception of what happiness and the ideal life look like. It's already difficult enough to figure out how to piece your life together and be truly happy and fulfilled, let alone while only viewing very carefully crafted images and lives that simply aren't real and are an unattainable standard.

naturalbodybuilding,fcgxg64,t1_fcgg34k,1577645022.0,"Not at all. I still make time for socializing and am flexible for things that do happen past my bedtime.


It depends on how you frame these things to yourself, honestly: you can see it as being up early solely for the sake of work, or you can also see it as using the most productive morning hours (they are for me, but YMMV) to accomplish things you value -- yoga, training, reading, journaling, etc.


It's not a one-size-fits-all schedule/lifestyle, but in this way my work is also my play."
naturalbodybuilding,fbggzhc,t1_fbggao2,1576849159.0,"Ditto for just about all that! With the exception of Alaska; I'm in Texas and the sun is brutal. 

Those morning hours are unashamedly selfishly mine, and I enjoy them. It's worth not going out in the evenings too often; instead my goals get accomplished and I see consistent progress over time. Once my work schedule is a little more flexible (switching to salaried) I'm super excited just to be able to fit everything in at the gym and maybe get some reading done in the mornings. ❤️"
