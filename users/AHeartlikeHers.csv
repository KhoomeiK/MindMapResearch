foodhacks,ff4ygq1,t1_ff4t9h9,1579575482.0,"The 'Hack' part is using the blender to make the Hollandaise so that you don't split your sauce, surely? I would assume that's why it's called 'FOOLPROOF' Eggs Benedict."

wholesomememes,ff4orul,t1_ff4m6wq,1579568807.0,Agreed.
wholesomememes,ff4opij,t1_ff4nfdq,1579568762.0,The scenery and the sound track together were so powerful. The fucked up part was that they had to travel to the southern part of Argentina just to film some of the scenes in the snow. Leo even [called out climate change](https://youtu.be/xpyrefzvTpI) in his acceptance speech.
wholesomememes,ff4nqvu,t1_ff4mwix,1579568080.0,"I totally understand. It's a really slow-burn kind of movie. A big part of why I love it so much is the dynamic between Leo and his son. I lost my mother too, and seeing how devoted Leo is as a father and how hard he tries to guide and protect his son in such a violent and unpredictably dangerous world breaks my heart. The power of his performance just completely draws me into the film. ALSO I totally love Tom Hardy and the goofy voice he does in this movie is the fucking best thing ever"
wholesomememes,ff4lpub,t1_ff4l900,1579566654.0,I watched The Revenant six times in theaters and cried every time. I've watched it three times since I bought it on Blu-ray. There's nothing I don't love about that movie.
