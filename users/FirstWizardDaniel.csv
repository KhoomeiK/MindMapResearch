Well, then he stopped coughing and the moment I saw his finger starting to point to his throat, I was out the chair, readied my stance, and tried as hard I could. Took like 3 thrusts but it came out.

I used to run 2 filters (sunsun 304b and fluval 305) and both have pre-filter sponges on the intakes. Now with the one filter I put 2 dense sponge filters on both sides of intake to suck up some of the sand dust that gets kicked up.

United States alone put out approx 5x the amount of CO2 than Australia did. China is currently the lead emitter of CO2 but the United States has put far more CO2 into the atmosphere between the years 1970-2017.

It doesn't count the last 2 years and China has been emitting a lot more than the USA per year but the USA hasn't slowed their role either. 

There's typically only reliable public transportation in big metropolitan areas. Being from a more rural part of the states, you either have a car, pay for an uber/lyft/taxi when you need to go somewhere, or walk. And walking even sucks because there's not many sidewalks. So lots of people here have their own cars and I'm sure that adds a huge amount to our total emissions.

But ok now I'm very curious. Don't have to respond if too personal. But free fluid in the abdomen typically doesn't present in patients with appendicitis. Lack of hunger (feeling full), bloating, abdominal tenderness, general pain are all symptoms of ascites (free fluid in the abdomen). And yes, it causes a lot of stress on the intestines and actually causes them to swell. 

I just want to know why a symptom that typically presents in patients with cancer or congestive heart failure is presenting in someone who had appendicitis. Same with the PICC line typically only used for cancer patients (chemotherapy) or in your case, for nutrition.

Sorry, this is what I am studying and there are rare cases that weird things happen with routine procedures and trying to figure out if this is one to ask professor questions. I.e. Chylous Ascites is a rare condition to where they have no idea why your body spit up some intestine goop all in your abdomen and causes an acute abdomen.

How they didn't go septic 24 hours in, not go unconscious, and not suffer multisystem organ failure, is way over my head. Ok, sarcastic rant over."
bettafish,fclnnxx,t3_ehr5s7,1577752063.0,How often do you have to do water changes with that many fish in such a confined space? No way your nitrates stay in a safe range for more than a couple days especially not having any live plants to suck any nitrates up.
bettafish,fclnfdm,t1_fcl33ae,1577751899.0,"Lol came here to ask this, got excited"
bettafish,fclmx3e,t3_ehsk1l,1577751552.0,"Looks great! I've not had a single bad plant from them! Great stock and, for me at least, never had any melting issues.

And I believe I see scarlet Temple in there. I got some from coop as well and it's turned a LOT more pink, no CO2, medium lighting. I do dose easy iron once a week."
LifeProTips,fclg4sf,t1_fckzv8e,1577747002.0,"Right?? This is what I'm thinking, also from Northeast, right outside DC. No way in the Northeastern US are you not being put on a waitlist. We got lots of people and not enough doctors here."
LifeProTips,fclfv0r,t1_fckykgz,1577746825.0,"Lol I'm from the Northeast, right outside DC actually. Plenty of fancy doctors and hospitals around here. And guess what? There's still a wait. 

I don't have the best insurance but when I had to have a biopsy done, it was a 3 month wait. I don't know if you're just privileged and have a team of private at home doctors or what lmao"
LifeProTips,fcldz47,t1_fclaccl,1577745593.0,"Wait, what? How did your appendix get behind your stomach? They are pretty far apart from each other and the appendix is attached to your intestines, so were your intestines just all over your abdomen? But then you probably wouldn't be speaking if that happened..."

Aquariums,fckbuns,t1_fcj6qha,1577721810.0,Same! Used to not like it and liked hornwort over it. Now I despise hornwort and love anacharis. Also my turtle loves to eat anacharis so I just toss my clippings in there and no waste!
Aquariums,fckb8c3,t1_fck585x,1577721391.0,"I water all my plants with tank water and never have to use outside fertilizers. Plants are all doing fantastic! I did read somewhere though that if it's really dirty water (cleaned a sponge in the water, gravel vacuumed water, etc...) that you should dilute it because it'll be too strong.

I also figured out that since I fertilize the aquatic plants that some of those ferts gotta be in the water too lol"
oddlysatisfying,fcgdjs4,t1_fcg35j3,1577638889.0,"Right, it was almost 60F (16C) on Christmas in Maryland. It's actually been around 50F (10C) these past 2 weeks, really strange for Maryland winter."

Aquariums,fc3pt4k,t1_fc2lv3g,1577395609.0,"I use Easy Iron by aquarium coop and dose after my weekly water change, I forget sometimes though lol or ill dose less, depending on how the plants look. 

I should also mention I run my lights for 12 hours on, 12 hours off and it's a med-high lighting. I don't have issues with algae in THIS tank haha. I have a lots of snails and shrimps too though, in all my tanks, I feel like they're the best at taking care of algae. One of my smaller tanks is having a small hair algae problem, I assume from me overfeeding though."
Aquariums,fc3phi3,t1_fc2ltxe,1577395376.0,I actually have some of this and AR on the way! Glad to hear it does well without co2! I'm currently trying as many reds without co2 and seeing where it gets me lol
Aquariums,fc24ob7,t3_efr5py,1577340285.0,"I keep scarlet temple, couple different red crypts, some red rotala not sure exactly which one, and red root floaters. I don't use CO2 in any of my tanks and there are all very red. Even some of my anacharis and dwarf Sag has spots of dark red. Scarlet temple under leaves are hot pink as well. 

For me I've noticed it's more about dosing iron. If I miss a dose or dose too little, I can definitely tell the difference in the new growth. It will be green instead of red. O and some of these I've noticed will only get red with high/medium light also but crypts seem to only care about the iron.

Edit: [Here's a picture of my Scarlet Temple without CO2.](http://imgur.com/a/yL7mXea) sorry about lighting, lights in room are pretty much off so using a flashlight as background light."

Aquariums,fc1nx9j,t3_efoa4h,1577324366.0,How is there already so much ammonia and nitrates in your tank? Does your water out the tap already have a high ppm of ammonia and nitrates? Are you using dirt with a substrate?
Aquariums,fc1noke,t1_fc1lodt,1577324207.0,Really? Which ones? I always feel bad throwing out my plants weekly. I feed what I can to the turtle but she only eats so much lol
