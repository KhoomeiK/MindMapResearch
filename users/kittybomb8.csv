thanksimcured,ffaarpp,t1_ffa4mfv,1579731233.0,Ty for saying this. It's been feeling some type of incel-y way towards AnYTHING positive in here lately.
SuicideWatch,fcn8zi6,t1_fcn8cfj,1577806347.0,"You seem really negative and toxic, so that's why I can't help you and probably why your family and friends don't want to help you either. I really don't think anybody can until you lose the attitude. Though I think you're probably sick and need mental health services and that's what makes you this way. I know making min wage also kills the soul. 

I'm sincerely sorry you feel the way you do. I hope somebody with more patience, resources, and who is able to handle the emotional burden of dealing with a sick person can help you on your journey.

Obviously that's not me. I have too many struggles of my own and helping you while having to deal with an attitude that would be detrimental to my own mental health would not work. I might help you, but I'd hurt myself in the process and set back my own progress.  

Again I hope you find what you're looking for, whether that be honest help or simple validation of your concerns."
SuicideWatch,fcn4o66,t1_fcml002,1577803168.0,"That's life and there's options and free services, but it really sounds like you're just on here to complain so I won't waste my time with you anymore. Bye."
SuicideWatch,fck8c0t,t1_fcjsw16,1577719364.0,"Sounds like you want to be taken care of by a single person that doesn't exist. 

Unfortunately I don't know of anybody who would do all of this for you. It sounds like you need access to these resources. 

A financial advisor for money. 
A nutritionist or doctor for health. 
And depending on what you need for education there are school advisors. 

These people exist but you need to seek them out. Sometimes that's not easy to do if you're also dealing with mental health issues. A therapist is a good place to start. In my experience they are great resources to expand on parts of your life you are struggling with. They could guide you to the right people or organizations."
