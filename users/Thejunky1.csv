Firearms,ff7fycv,t1_ff65c0g,1579648653.0,"If a ruler would ICBM their own infrastructure/citizens, then an armed people is even more logical. The US wouldn't destroy their own streets, and there would not be tanks on every corner. There are just over 3 million service members, including local, state, and federal law enforcement. Even if the non combatant roles were to pick up a rifle, and this is assuming there was 0 deserters, the number of potential soldiers pales in comparison to the number of firearms in private ownership. 

Let's be reasonable and say there's 300 million fire arms in the US. A conservative estimate would say that 100 million are capable of armed conflict, as in they are not antiques or weird boutique calibers that can't be supplied. Even if you want to say that most of those firearms that are capable of service are in the hands of the few, let's say that every owner of one of those rifles actually owns 10 of them. Definitely a conservative number, as ownership patterns fall way further then this example, but that's still 10 million individuals. 

Those are super conservative numbers, as recent sales (that we actually have numbers for) for ar manufacturers that have records available had sales of around 30 million civilian model carbines sold between 2008-2016 alone. That's only like 3 manufacturers, and not taking into account the other makes and 80% lowers leads me to believe there's upwards of 200-250 million modern sporting rifles on our streets.

They would have to nuke every rural farmhouse and city block. Not much of a nation left to lead at that point. So yea, icbms, tanks, drones, and anything resembling the militarization against the US populace isn't in the equation I guess."

The Vincennes was literally shots out on a boat waiting for splash when they were also trying to hail the fresh radar contact, but fucked up in their call. Thus firing a missile when they didn't get a response from the airliner. Too many things happening at once I suppose."
