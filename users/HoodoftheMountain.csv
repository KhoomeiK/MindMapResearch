wholesomememes,fdk0liq,t1_fdjtbdn,1578493069.0,Never heard of them until they toured with Allegaeon. Saw them and they were awesome! I had to buy their awesome elephant-cuthulu t-shirt.
wholesomememes,fdjzq91,t1_fdjswq2,1578492399.0,I love me some sexy saxophone death metal from Rivers of Nihil.
wholesomememes,fdjyntg,t1_fdjspck,1578491560.0,"Ritual is one of my favorites. I catch myself screaming to ""The Window"" sometimes but it's lyrically disturbing haha."
wholesomememes,fdjw2s8,t1_fdjuifb,1578489386.0,"Absolutely. I can't say I have a favorite but ""Monolith of Inhumanity""  is a hard contender with it."
wholesomememes,fdju72a,t1_fdjltvc,1578487627.0,"Allegaeon's latest album ""Apoptosis"" is one of the best of 2019 imo. I absolutely love ""Stellar Tidal Disruption"" from it. Also ""The Secular Age"". 

A little less melodic but love Cattle Decapitation's new album ""Death Atlas"". ""Bring back the Plague"" ""With all disrespect"" ""One day closer to the end of the world"". Are some favorites from it."
starterpacks,fcl2mni,t1_fckxat3,1577738465.0,Are you saying I personally like music that is socially different than what's popular makes me stereotypically elitist?
starterpacks,fckwbnh,t1_fcknupg,1577734591.0,"You know, metal isn't elitist, sure we have some people who believe they are superior because they listen to metal, which I believe is complete bullshit. We just like heavy complex counterculture music. Most metal fans I know are really chill dudes and like a variety of music in their life. Just listen to what you like and the naysayers can fuck off but if your hating on the metal community as a whole just because our music isn't to your taste, then sit on a spiked dildo and get fucked.


Lovingly, 

Extreme metal loving bearded dude."

Portland,f9q91ak,t3_e5zq1i,1575557250.0,Anyone going to Cattle Decapitation in two weeks? I'm excited for the show but none of my friends or co-workers are metal heads. Seeking comradery really lol.
