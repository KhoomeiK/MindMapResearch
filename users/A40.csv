bicycling,ff5u3jx,t3_cl0vlq,1579610287.0,"I'm an avid cyclist and am looking at building a recumbent (as a fun project). The issue of visibility raised here brought back a memory:
 
I used to drive a city bus. One morning I pulled my bus up to a stop light, left lane, waiting to turn left when the light turned green. And only when completely stopped did my conscious mind register the recumbent tricycle immediately in front of me. Below me. I had subconsciously accommodated it as a vehicle - I'd given it ten yards of space in front of me - but I hadn't seen a *bicycle in traffic* until I was stopped. It was well-lit, several red strobing LEDs, but I hadn't registered ""bicycle, recumbent.""

I've thought about this in the years since (it really startled me), and I think one explanation is that it was **below** my ""traffic radar."" It was, visually, *under* the car in front of it - it became part of the 'road space' between me and that car. It wasn't invisible, but the way I looked at and perceived traffic, the road, the movement of my vehicle - did not automatically include vehicles so close to the road as to make *all other traffic visible in the same way it would be visible if the recumbent was not there.*

Just thoughts."
