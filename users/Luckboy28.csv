It was as if her feelings were completely gone, almost like I was talking to a completely different person. But the weirdest part was that she had seemingly no desire to sit down and have a conversation about it or explore why, or to want to work through it

I went through this with a very serious long-term girlfriend when I was around 18-20.   We dated for years, and things were really getting serious.  We were talking about getting married, etc.

Then one day, she says ""Yeah, you know, I think I'll just marry the first guy that asks me"" -- and I laugh, thinking it was a joke or sarcasm.  She looks at me puzzled, because she was serious.  I was stunned.  I asked ""Soooo, you'd just marry *anybody*?"" and she said ""Well yeah, anybody I like.""   So I asked ""Uh, okay.  How many guys do you like?"" and she said ""Oh, 4 or 5.""

Long story short, we were dating for multiple years, and then she claimed that she believed she was in an open relationship, and couldn't understand why I was upset.  Turns out that she had lots of male friends that she would be willing to marry at the drop of a hat.

We break up, and a few months later she marries some random guy.

I still can't wrap my head around how somebody could be so incredibly cruel.  I was hospitalized a few times after that for suicide attempts.

Problems / Possible Solutions:

**Farming, Breeding, and Time Sinks**

I think it's important for game developers to ask themselves some pretty simple/fundamental questions about their games, such as:

* What are the players spending their time doing?

* Are those things fun?

In ARK's case, this answer usually comes down to a few things:

* Grinding/Farming Resources

* Breeding Dinos

* Actually playing the game (Raiding/Defending in PvP, playing PvE content)

The big problem is that farming and breeding aren't really very interesting or fun, and combined that probably make about 80-90% of a person's playtime.   Yes, some people enjoy breeding, but what they mostly enjoy are the results (cool mutations, stat manipulation, etc).  Very few breeders love the actual work of feeding, imprinting, and slaughtering babies.

So, how do you create a time-sink that's fun?   What would that look like?

For PvP, this would mean **actually creating a game mode, with victory conditions.**  The problem isn't that ARK's PvP design is bad, it's simply that ARK **doesn't have** any PvP design.  Wildcard simply took a bunch of items, dinos, and structures -- threw them all into a sandbox -- and then said ""Uh, kill each other or something, I guess"" and then disappeared.

That sort of ""hands off"" means that players are stuck in an endless loop of grinding with a little PvP, with no actual victory in sight.  What's worse, this environment forces people to either get wiped constantly, or to join a mega-tribe (and still get wiped occasionally).

The only way to fix this is to create **actual game modes** that have win conditions.  If you look at all of the other successful/fun PvP games, they all have very clear-cut win conditions.  Rocket League:  Score X points in X time.  Starcraft:  Destroy all the enemy buildings/units.  League of Legends:  Destroy the enemy base, etc.

That's what ARK needs:  Some kind of quantifiable objective, and probably a ranking system.   Maybe each map has control nodes that tribes can fight over, and tribes are ranked by the total number of nodes that they control across every server, that sort of thing.  **An actual objective.**

The next step is to try to make the game objects as skill-based as possible, to shift the meta away from ""those with the most hours played will always win"" to ""those with the highest skill will win.""

This could be done by making the control nodes have special turrets that don't require ammo to fire, so that the meta moves away from farming bullets and soaking, to *actually raiding the structure* and blowing up the defenses, etc.  Wildcard could then cap the total number of turrets allowed in each control node to keep things balanced.   And to keep things interesting, the number of allowed turrets might be based on the number of nodes you currently own.  So the big competitive tribes might only have half as many turrets as a node being held by a small tribe, meaning that it's almost impossible to wipe a tribe that's only holding one node, but it's fairly easy to capture a mega-tribe's node unless they defend it well, etc.

Building an actual game mode allows game developers to naturally encourage players to compete using mechanics that are fun.

And if the game was rebalanced to reduce the grind (more durability on items, cheaper repair costs, cheaper/lighter ammo, etc) then farming could be pushed back to a little side mini-game you do whenever your tribe gets low on something, rather than farming being one of the big main focuses.

Whew.

And that's just PvP.   The PvE situation would require more interesting content (bosses, caves, etc) to keep PvE players challenged.

TLDR:   Wildcard needs to make actual **game modes** with quantifiable win conditions, and then rebalance the existing turrets/gear/ammo to require a lot less materials."

And the lack of any Alphas (aside from the rare Alpha Death Worm) made the map feel pretty lacking in threat.  Wyverns and Golems both mind their own business in their own areas, and are pretty easy to avoid.

I would have loved seeing the regular alphas (Raptor/Carno/Rex) along with maybe new alphas -- like scorpions, snakes, etc."

Wow, classy.

We're talking about self-preservation here.  If given the option, I think most people would prefer to be eligible to receive organs if needed.

And nobody said anything about sitting at home fretting.  This is the kind of question that pops up when you renew your drivers license, etc, and somebody asks you about it.  That's where you have to think about it and make a decision."

The original quote didn't say anything about a boys building.  That was something that OP clarified later.

There's nothing wrong with my reading comprehension here.

The quote was:

> The heat was out for a month, during a blizzard, on Christmas, with girls residing at the shelter.

""Girls residing at the shelter"" was listed along with 3 other examples of ""things that make this situation worse.""   Based on that context, and the fact that a boys shelter was never mentioned, it's completely rational to read ""Girls residing at the shelter"" as a 4th reason why the situation was particularly bad."
todayilearned,feo7wvz,t1_feo2tpe,1579296326.0,The fact that you're talking shit instead of making a counter-point is pretty telling.
todayilearned,fen3svn,t1_fel9i0y,1579276344.0,"No hypocrisy here.  If somebody opts-out for personal reasons, they should definitely go to the bottom of the waiting list for organs.  That's totally fair."
todayilearned,fen3iwn,t1_fel9orv,1579276171.0,"Yeah, that sucks.  A lot.

But that doesn't give anyone the right to steal organs from somebody against their will.  Consent is still required."

todayilearned,fen3131,t1_felcqo7,1579275854.0,"I think you misread what I was replying to.

""elruary"" was trying to argue that you shouldn't have a choice at all, and that the government should be allowed to steal whatever they want from your body when you die, regardless of your personal or religious beliefs.

I'm simply saying that the government shouldn't be allowed to do that.

People should be allowed to decide if they want to be donors or not.  And if they opt-out of being a donor, then it makes logical sense that they would also be moved to the bottom of the waiting list for an organ."
todayilearned,fen2jc7,t1_feldjk1,1579275538.0,"Yeah, probably.

If somebody's willing to donate good organs, then they should be higher on the list then somebody who isn't willing to contribute.

Keep in mind that there are lots of organs that people need, that have little/nothing to do with a person's lifestyle."
todayilearned,fen2do5,t1_feldzz0,1579275438.0,"No, you didn't get it.  =o

You'd only be at the bottom of the list if you opted out for personal reasons.  Being disqualified for medical reasons wouldn't change anything."
todayilearned,fen28u7,t1_feliur6,1579275352.0,"People often confuse philosophical rights with governmental rights.

""Rights"" in this context just means ""things that are guaranteed/protected by the government.""

Hence, healthcare should be a right.  It's a basic need that we should all be solving as a country."
