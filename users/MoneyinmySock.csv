nba,ff9jnpo,t1_ff9jlmh,1579714426.0,Live got it right in that sense with 19. Takes maybe 2 weeks to max out a player if you’re really on it. Some shorts and sneakers are exclusive to player builds. If you want to unlock them you have to play with the other player types instead of buying everything

trashy,ff97d4n,t1_ff9789f,1579706556.0,I know all of this as I have an uncle who is a convicted felon just messing with OP for being sensitive. It’s a meme. I’m sure felons and people with a sense of humor do too
trashy,ff978ye,t1_ff977c4,1579706482.0,Lol sensitive
trashy,ff97481,t1_ff9710o,1579706397.0,What about the part where it’s a meme and meant to be humorous? Should I yell at you over the Internet because you’re not getting it?
trashy,ff96syn,t1_ff96oli,1579706194.0,"First, stop yelling. You might be trashy for assuming he wants to do crimes. He could be reformed and just wants a gun to protect his household

trashy,ff96100,t3_esbvfi,1579705674.0,Maybe start a sub for things that are not trashy
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff95e7n,t1_ff94mqr,1579705247.0,Nah I think it’s more like if it was well built and sturdy enough he would’ve just walked right over it. He tried and saw it was wobbly and decided not to hurt himself by standing on it and having it collapse. While elephants are smart there are dogs and cats that do this
PublicFreakout,ff93upp,t3_esc8de,1579704195.0,Not public but I’ve had similar happen. Took a girl home from a party in college thinking she went to my school. The next day I found out she went to a school 2 hours away and was not leaving. She demanded I drive her back to her school

nba,ff8hny4,t1_ff8hka0,1579678934.0,Where is his ring? Where is his conference finals appearance? You would think somebody who scores so efficiently would get his team there no problem. Regular season is a joke. Nobody locks until the playoffs and we see what Harden does come that time

nba,ff8coqc,t1_ff8bfmk,1579673096.0,"Just realized I’m speaking with rockets fans lol a lot of mvp talk. Haven’t heard anything about a chip. Enjoy the triple doubles and 30 point games. Also, that first round bounce. I can’t talk much tho I’m a Dallas fan"
nba,ff8bwpd,t1_ff8b5fi,1579672298.0,When this inefficient and selfish style of play wins a chip I’ll gladly and humbly give you the credit.
nba,ff8bb3b,t1_ff8b8ah,1579671697.0,With what he has yea. You remember gardens rockets jacking up a thousand 3s and blowing a lead last year in the playoffs? A leader would’ve told his guys to chill and get good buckets
nba,ff8adwi,t1_ff89gk3,1579670811.0,"You know who is 1st all Time in that stat? Deandre Jordan. 3rd, Tyson chandler. What are we proving with that"
nba,ff89q8c,t1_ff8999e,1579670187.0,Why do stars get credit for the Ws no Ls. He was 1-17 from 3. Just stop shooting. Maybe get some assists. Idk lead your team like cp3 did
nba,ff891zp,t3_es734v,1579669575.0,I mean Jacking up shot after shot and going iso all game isn’t a leader isn’t a winning style. It might sell tickets but he won’t win
nba,ff88r3v,t1_ff88o9s,1579669302.0,They are empty numbers. He just shot 1-17 from 3 and gave up a 14 point lead in the fourth. He’s not a winner. He only cares about his numbers. Said that’s his legacy
nba,ff88kkd,t3_es734v,1579669140.0,At this point he’s not judged by the regular season. He’s averaging almost 1000 dribbles a game. Is super inefficient and will we’re himself out by the playoffs but scoring is everything tho I guess. What are you collecting mvps for? I thought a ring was the goal
nba,ff88i93,t1_ff886y7,1579669083.0,Because scoring is everything right?
