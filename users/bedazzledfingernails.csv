I would seek treatment, but if I died then I died, and if I survived, I hope it would revitalize me somehow, make it seem like there's more to lose."

depression,fehcycx,t1_fehca4m,1579113992.0,"Not that I know of, although I've often wondered if I repressed something since I'm so neurotic. My parents divorced when I was about 9 (my dad was/is an alcoholic) but I don't remember anything about it. I feel guilty because I don't seem to have any ""reason"" for my depression other than shitty brain chemistry, apparently. :( 

I'm so sorry you were abused in the past. I hope you can hang in there."
depression,fehce8w,t3_ep4bw6,1579113671.0,"Yep, I have no idea what to do with myself because it seems like I should have been dead awhile ago."
depression,fehbsc6,t3_ep53zv,1579113311.0,"Yes...I think it's because if I get worse I might finally do something about it. Right now I just feel like I'm drowning and it takes all my energy to tread water. Not going anywhere. If I get worse, at least I might have the energy to make a choice. It might a be a destructive choice but at least it would be something other than *this*."
depression,fehbg2o,t3_ep5cu9,1579113109.0,"> I know people have to work and its normal but i can't come to terms with the fact. 

Amen. I'm with you on this. No matter what I do for work, it depresses me and the stress takes over my life (even though it's only supposed to be 1/3 of it). I wish I didn't *have* to work, like if the stakes were lower. I probably still would work to stay busy but it wouldn't be loaded with all the stress.

I relate a lot to your post. Sorry I don't have anything to offer other than commiseration."
depression,fehats6,t3_ep5fxd,1579112739.0,"I'm afraid of everything too. Travel usually stresses me out because everything is unfamiliar to me. I *feel* like I want a vacation, but I'm afraid I won't enjoy it and would have to plan all of it for no benefit. How can I enjoy anything if I'm afraid of it all?"
depression,fehal2m,t3_ep5ndk,1579112596.0,"I feel the same. I love my family, but I guess I'm just not as fulfilled by family as other people are. It's not enough. And that makes me feel guilty on top of it."

RedditForGrownups,fdnvwif,t3_em5lqt,1578593917.0,"I have this thought sometimes. Not that I have someone else in mind. My husband and I have a lot of things in common, and occasionally we'll joke about it and say things like, ""I knew I married you for a reason,"" but there are just as many things that we *don't* have in common, and which cause friction. And sometimes I think that some of the things we share are actually bad habits, and we mutually reinforce them. That's when I start wondering if I should have waited, since odds are there's someone out there who would complement me better.

I don't really entertain the thought beyond that, though, because it's just odds. And I can't predict how or when either of us will change (but I know we will in some ways). *As far as I know*, my husband is the right one for me. But you just never know what's out there, and sometimes acknowledging that turns into wondering if I made the right choice, etc."

MadOver30,fbu3v51,t3_ee585b,1577107123.0,"I don't have kids, partly for this exact reason. I wonder this all the time about other people. It actually gives me anxiety sometimes when I think about all the work that it would take to maintain a household with children in it. I can barely manage my household and we're child-free. So I guess this is all to say....props to you for being where you're at!  You're doing it, and it's fucking hard! I wish I could give you some practical advice but all I can give you is validation of your wonderment of others holding it together."
