WatchRedditDie,ff72rrs,t1_ff70yld,1579639966.0,"Okay, this we can debate. This is a better argument then the post I replied to.

Okay, but hear me out. In doing this, we basically end up with military rule. Furthermore, you would end up having people who are taxed without having proper representation.

Okay we can all agree that income tax is theft. We still have it tho in today's society. So, how is it fair that any man or woman who has a net loss in income not have the right to vote for their representation?

This is the idea behind land owners voting, I'm sure that land was also taxed. Now, land ownership being the qualifying factor in voting is basically watered down feudalism, and still ignores those who are taxed and pay rent.

Now, one can argue that only allowing taxed individuals to vote takes away the rights of the poor, as let's face it, the poor are effected by that legislation.

However, the poor are also the most easy to manipulate, and buy votes from. Promise them programs that keep them from having to work, and you're golden.  Adversely, what benefit do tax payers have to vote for economic measures that provide jobs for the poor? Personally, I'd say in general, most tax payers want the poor to have that opportunity, and if there are more jobs for the poor then that makes better jobs for the tax payers.

Bottom line, no taxation without representation should flow through our government, as it's the primary grievance provided when we started our revolution."

AskReddit,feukdji,t1_feuhqe0,1579387328.0,"I know some of my memories include details based off people talking about that time, or pictures.. mostly my earliest memories are factual tho with details missing like if the rain coats were orange or yellow.. the there are details that I know I imagined like the shadows in the dark being more then what they were.

But I can 100% believe that some people can experience these type of false memories. Childhood is a really strange time when you have very little experience in the world and you start to make things up to make sense of what's going on around you."
scifi,feuhsfs,t1_fepp9yl,1579386639.0,"Here is what is funny about copyright, and intellectual property.

Okay I can sell paper strips, and freely provide instructions on how to manipulate that paper strip to make music that belongs to someone else.

If I sell the paper strip with the holes already punched, with the knowledge that it would play that music when paired with the music box, I may be violating copyright.  But the objects themselves are useless without eachother, and it's just a strip of paper with holes... So in essence, the copyright owner may own the rights to the music, but the specific medium that is being used to play the music is something completely different then what they recorded.


I'll take it a step further.

What if I give someone a bunch of 1s and 0s in a book that if typed in on a computer would produce an MP3 of the exact song? What if I give someone an MP3 of the song that I copied off of my CD? Or what if it's in a different format all together that only my software can run? The data is useless without the tool to decide it.. but it's a violation, because if you put the data and tool together it creates the sound that is copyrighted.

This is where everything breaks down for me with intellectual property. Of course I should not be able to make money off what someone else makes.. but I can't keep from thinking about the digital item being broke down in it's most simple form is really just that paper with or without the holes."

So, if someone says [opposite political party] is bad, are they wrong because the party has millions of supporters?  If you find that the majority of users of said social platform (no matter the numbers) to have a certain quality that you dislike, you can for certain say that platform is bad. Basically, I'm not a fan of a platform that is full of girls my daughter's age singing about how I want their pussy and other provocative shit.

Just like I can say certain subreddits are pretty bad."
