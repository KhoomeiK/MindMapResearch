relationship_advice,fem3bgy,t3_epoar6,1579238361.0,"Personally, I do think she's cheating on you. And it's painfully obvious it's both emotional and physical cheating.

Why is she still with you? Because this other guy might not be ready for a relationship, so she's keeping you hanging on.

Either way, a relationship needs more than love to survive. It also needs trust and respect, and it's painfully clear she doesn't respect you, and trust has gone out the window.

You should NOT stay."

The way your post was going, I thought the bride was going to use the entire $6K on a dress. Instead her dress is a very reasonable price. It's a wedding dress, for crying out loud!

The problem here is your attitude, and the way you seek to control her. Those, dear OP, are red flags."

He hasn't stood by you, because you don't know what else he's lied about.

A relationship needs trust and respect to thrive, and how exactly does his disrespecting you (by not inviting you to R's thingy) help the relationship?

Don't try to convince yourself there is love, when his actions say there isn't."

As I'm standing there, the young lady preparing this grabs the sugar. I didn't even think that it was for the OJ ice, cos...fresh juice.

She fills a tablespoon sized scoop, and I suddenly register that she's about to drop it into the juice!

I asked, she verified it was indeed going into the fresh juice, and i told her to hold off on the sugar.

I am still very surprised that this place puts sugar into fresh OJ!"

Secondly, there is absolutely no way, she can let you become better than her in any way. Well, in any tangible way.

Of course she won't genuinely help you. Do yourself a favour and stop discussing anything with her. Stick to talking about the weather..."
