UpliftingNews,fet372n,t1_fesrjtv,1579371358.0,"The government doesn’t collect enough taxes to cover it’s current debts but went ahead and cut taxes anyways. All that funding not coming from taxes comes from government borrowing, that’s what a federal deficit is. Then they inflate the money supply so when they do go to pay it back it costs them less. It takes money from people who save it, and benefits net borrowers such as the US government. The other major payback method is to try and grow the economy such that the current tax rate will cover the deficit and expenditures. The US government has spent a few trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they could absolutely afford a few billion to spend on education and lowering household debts, and if it means retraining people who got degrees in Art history or Grateful Dead music theory who now aren’t particularly productive in the economy into more productive members of the economy like plumbers, electricians, nurses, teachers, police officers, and computer programmers; and putting people who are struggling with debt in a position to pursue entrepreneurial ventures is a net positive; because getting people employed and producing more value for the economy is better for growing an economy than people struggling to pay their bills."
