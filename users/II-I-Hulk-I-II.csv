What part of the military can be cut? Personally I agree America’s defence spending is too high, but what exactly do you cut?

So you’re suggesting decriminalisation? Legalisation? Which drugs should be effected? Should people already incarcerated under such acts be set free? Compensation for those arrested etc?

> • Agricultural subsidies

Again, which parts of the agricultural subsidies are too high? 

> • The clandestine services

Example please

> • I'd argue for healthcare and education, but I suspect you wouldn't agree

The US already pays too much for healthcare, which is why a national health service would actually save billions. US educational systems are also falling far behind other developed parts of the world. How will cutting education spending, improve your lives? 

> • Social security, which, for decades, has been run on a dishonest platform

Again, how will reducing social security, help our lives as a whole? Social security is directly linked to homelessness, unemployment and wellbeing 

>• Halting infrastructure expansions until debt is somewhat under control

Example?

> • All kinds of business subsidies really, as they promote an unhealthy market on the backs of the tax payers

Which businesses? All businesses? Or only the big corporations? Which subsidies? Increase taxes? Close loopholes?


If you don’t have any idea about exactly what you would do and how it would help, then don’t you think it’s a bit silly to sit here and make claims?

For the record, I agree with you on certain aspects;

Military spending could be reduced, from 3.6% gdp to 3% in the first 5 years, with the majority of spending cuts being implemented in the withdrawal of troops from the Middle East. This would have to be offset by investments in defence for the affected regions, as well as pacts and treaties to ensure peaceful transitions. 

Business subsidies (including agricultural) would all depend on trade, and as such, the US should actually be pursuing the South American additions to the NAFTA. Focusing on an EU style conglomerate allowing the free movement of goods and services across the two continents. This would give the US access to billions more trade to undeveloped regions and give US interests unfettered access to the developing markets. 

In terms of tax, corporation tax should be hiked to 30%, as well as huge carbon tariffs on the Top 100 polluters (who cause 71% of the worlds emissions). Financial regulations should be placed on taking funds abroad, as well as the outsourcing of American jobs to cheaper countries. 

Everything I’ve listed above has just added Trillions to our national purse, and it doesn’t require any normal person to suffer. In fact, a smart man would take the extra finances and pour it into education (and healthcare). An educated person then provides more to society (as does a well person), paying higher tax rates their whole lives, and providing expertise to our society that we wouldn’t have had before. On a mass scale, this would provide a sudden burst of a highly educated workforce, allowing for untold innovation and creativity. 

In terms of healthcare, that’s just a burden we take. Sometimes there will be people too sick to be able to work, and they certainly can’t afford the treatment. That doesn’t mean they deserve to die, either. The US with its current insurance based healthcare system pays proportionally more, for the same drugs and services, than any other developed nation does, and they all have national health services. By nationalising healthcare, you actually take control of a huge part of the economy. At the moment, the only reason the US healthcare system makes so much money is because it is literally preying upon the weak, and most of that money ends up in the offshore accounts of incredibly wealthy people. So, I’d rather scrap private healthcare, implement a national, free service, which is paid for by a 1-2% tax increase on the medium-high earners."
dbz,ferl5qe,t3_eq55t1,1579355329.0,"Right so the trunks situation resulted in a couple differing timelines, I’ll explain: 

- Timeline 1 - This is the original/normal timeline, Goku kills Freeza and Cold on Earth, then dies to the heart virus prior to the androids turning up. In this timelines future, Trunks goes back in time with the time machine, creating timeline 2; when he returns from timeline 2 for the final time, he brings back with him a remote to destroy the androids, and does so, before he is killed by Timeline 1 Cell, who then uses the time machine to go back further than Trunks ever did, which creates timeline 4 (this is our timeline) 

- Timeline 2 is a replica of Timeline 1, up until Trunks came from the future, gave them the heart medicine and the androids were destroyed with the remote control. Trunks then leaves to save his own timeline 1.

- Timeline 3 is the same as Timeline 1, except when Trunks travels to the past, he is travelling to Timeline 4 which was created by Cell time travel. In timeline 3, everything happens the same as 1, until Trunks returns from Timeline 4 with his new powers, he then destroys both the androids and Cell, before cell could steal his time machine 

- Timeline 4 - timeline 4 has some small differences from Timeline 2 which are blamed on Trunks meddling with time, but we later find out is due to Cell (although, Cell being there is technically due to Trunks). In this timeline, due to the appearance of Cell, the four saiyans train in the hyperbolic time chamber, unlocking powers they never did in the previous timelines."

Just proper socialism takes it a step further, and makes sure we don’t have sick, uneducated or impoverished people within our society. And guess what? That, in turn, helps us, because we have more healthy, educated and tax paying folks in the workforce. 

It’s not ‘forcing you to give your money over’, it’s saying we all pay proportionately. That equates to like a %1-2 tax increase for the average person, but comes with the benefits of free healthcare, living wages and regulated inflation rates that won’t outstrip wage growth on an exponential rate as were seeing in today’s society.

For years now, the media has managed to make sure that centrists get the seats in the left-wing parties. People who are like Bernie Sanders terrify them because it risks ruining the charade. 

This is an international and systemic problem, that has been the blueprint for plastic democracy. Just look at Australia, the UK and the US. All have right-wing morons in charge, ScoMo, [Boris Johnson](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-tory-donors-named-in-secret-report-z98nqpkx0)  and Trump, two of which have had financial links to Russian interests (click link for UK Tory article, Trump/Russian connections widely known so wont bother linking anything for that one), leaders who will sell their own people down the river for personal gain. Who supports them all? FOX News, aka Rupert Murdoch. 

In October of 2019, as coverage of Donald Trump on FOX news became increasingly critical, Trump lashed out on Twitter, shortly after Attorney General Barr [held a private meeting with Murdoch](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/fox-news-poll-trump-impeachment.amp.html) at Murdoch’s New York home. Immediately after this interview, FOX News doubled down on their support for Trump, culminating in the [abrupt resignation of Shepherd Smith](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/shepard-smith-resigns-from-fox-news/2019/10/11/737953b8-ec61-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html?outputType=amp), a Trump critic who had appeared to stray from the usual FOX Pro-Trump narrative on numerous occasions in the lead up to his resignation. 

Trump knows how important positive coverage on FOX News is for his campaign, and Murdoch knows it too. So, what do you think his demands were? 

Personally, l think it’s quite obvious that in the midst of the impeachment inquiry, and namely the increasing support with the American people for his removal from office; Murdoch spotted an opportunity to apply pressure on Trump. The ‘resigning’ of Shepherd Smith was definitely a token gift, appealing to Trump’s narcissistic personality disorder, and I hate to think what he promised Murdoch in return."
