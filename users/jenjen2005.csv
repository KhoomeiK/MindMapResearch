My first meeting I arrived too early and sat in the parking lot.  When it was time, I literally said out loud in my car ""fuck it"" and went in.   But, I was glad I went.  It was not as scary as I imagined it to be at all. In fact, there were a lot of laughs to be had. 

I went to get a little coffee, and i said to the guy there, I just want a little shot. He said ya don't we all? And we laughed. It felt good to laugh about our problem."
