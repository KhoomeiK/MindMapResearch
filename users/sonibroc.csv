His stories used to be quite literally snoozers.
todayilearned,feyc3et,t1_fey3m2v,1579443564.0,"Compound crazy expensive with required courses that arent critical to your major.  Don't get me wrong, I think all majors need business writing, personal finance tending towards investing instead of raw economics - real world applications. For history, I am torn between contemporary history (late 1800's onwards) and political science. But for STEM majors, generally speaking, I have found they are already well read (all Engineers I have met are big time science fiction fans, regardless, well read for sure) so they don't need to be nudged. For me as a liberal arts major, even taking the geology class was a pain; 300+students in one session, even the professors knew people didn't care, students just needed the credit to graduate."

books,fejpmq7,t1_feitacm,1579182595.0,Another friend JUST recommended this book/series. I shied away because I am not a fantasy or science fiction person but maybe it doesn't fall into either camp? I would recommend A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman.
books,fejpgam,t1_fejkmdy,1579182450.0,"What about characters we hate?  I know someone quite intelligent who was actively hated some characters even though the book providesd perspective. Olive Kitteredge came to mind; I viewed Olive as a grump ala Grumpy Old Men, still lovable. The book torturer my friend.  Also, I think the studies focus on nonfiction (biographies and self help and business books). For the business books, there's not a whole lot of empathy needed, more reading for strategy. For biographies...ugh, i have struggled reading some, there's only a couple I would recommend (Trevor Noah's and Tara Westovers books)."
books,fejowdy,t1_feiqflw,1579181996.0,"Maybe, very interesting question. To further this idea, I was reading an Harvard Business Review article that linked curiousity, intelligence and empathy together; realizing, the article also focused on valuing the contributions of others but I can see this correlating to biographies and self-help improvement books. I am not a fan of those types of books which is why I read a lot of fiction.  I guess I challenge the fiction versus non fiction snobbery because I cried over A Man Called Ove. To be fair, I also loved Educated (possibly the only non fiction I have loved)."

books,fejo9h8,t1_fejajzc,1579181456.0,"Agreed.  There are recent articles summarizing the effectiveness of handwriting and journaling for memory and simply just cognitively processing information.  I did a simple test over 3 months of hand writing my grocery list versus using Google note and I could remember 95% of  my hand written list versus 75% of my Google notes list.  Additionally, handful of years ago, there were articles summarized scientific studies of the use of gadgets in the evenings negatively impacting sleep.  This resonated with me; I may watch TV past 7pm but not my computer and rarely my phone. I sleep loads better; the evenings I use my phone passed 8 or 9, my anxiety is a bit higher (this also includes ereaders).  Next up: converting some of the electronic notes I have taken from classes and HBR to pull together common ideas."

I am a firm believer that everyone has a right to opinion, so it's unfair to tell celebs that they aren't. We are all in bubbles etc (yes they have traveled and should have a better world view, my travel budget, however, doesn't afford private islands).  So then let's talk about award shows.

I thought were going to get attacked. Instead, when he got to the gate, he looked at us like we MUST want his company and ran along side us.  We tried telling him to go home, instead he joined us for a 4-mile out-and-back. When we turned around we literally said ""come on boy, let's go home"" and he turned around with us.  The next day, my husband extended the out and back by a couple miles and, again, our new friend joined him.  As my hubby was approaching the next village, our new friend's hackles went up as he growled and looked off in the distance.  It was only then that my hubby saw aggressive looking dogs coming towards them. So hubby says ""very good dog, very good, let's go home"" and they did. Best new friend ever."
