I have the traxxas app set up so re programming throttle limits etc shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. My only question is on the TSM settings but I guess I can always  call Traxxas for that. Their customer service is the best! Never a wait time and always a knowledgeable tech there to help. In fact, I usually get free replacement parts by being extra nice to them. They have the discretionary power to comp parts FYI."

I broke a few things here and there in light crashes. Most recently, snapped an arm on a curb, so I‚Äôm waiting for that to arrive. I‚Äôm replacing my steering blocks and ball bearings too. I noticed the front wheels had a lot of play then discovered the inner bearing was gone on one side and the axle had worn away at the block. 
Outside of that, it‚Äôs a great car. I keep one nice body for show and another for speed runs, because if things go wrong with this car it takes flight and lands on its back. I‚Äôve ruined a couple of nice bodies, and learned not to use my pretty one on speed runs."

The Qwik Grip is great if you have mostly romex wiring. Instead of bringing your cables in through 7/8 KO‚Äôs, there‚Äôs plastic slots in the top and bottom of the panel. You just slide your cables in, pop a plastic cover over and it locks the romex down. They‚Äôre a huge time saver and actually work really well. The slots are sized for 14/2, 12/2 and 10/2-3 and are in a z shape, once the cables in there it doesn‚Äôt move at all!
