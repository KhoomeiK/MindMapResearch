dataisbeautiful,fee2dh7,t3_eojoay,1579024961.0,"Is there something like this but with older data? See, the thing is, climate is a sinoidal wave, just like with economy; it has its ups and downs. Maybe we are just seeing the down of said wave and in the far future the climate will get warmer. Do we have enough data to really say the world will end up like venus? I'm not saying I don't believe in climate change, its apparent if we see the data provided by this post, I'm playing devil's advocate here for the sake of argument."
