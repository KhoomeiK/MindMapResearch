My argument isn't that he is wrong to view abortion as not murder, my argument is that there are people who do view it as murder, and if they view it that way, stopping murder is perfectly in line with libertarian ideals."
Libertarian,fffrf52,t1_fffr86j,1579890167.0,"Of course it would be, and those people were paid along the way (either through stock options, or wages if they wanted less personal risk). He is not the only one who did it, and he is not the only one who gained because of it."
Libertarian,fffqvfp,t1_fffqmb6,1579889832.0,"That is just not true, unless of course you also believe the government should not prosecute murders. IF you believe that a fetus is a human life THEN it must be murder to end that life. There is no hypocrisy in saying you wish to stop murder. Now, obviously a lot of people don't view a fetus as a life, and that is also no hypocrisy. The point is, the question is 100% determined by when you think life begins (unless you are ok with murdering one person if it makes another person better off._"
