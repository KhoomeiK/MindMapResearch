fatlogic,fdxkr00,t1_fdwnzr5,1578769853.0,I find it sexist because they’re infantilizing someone using a gendered word (panties). I’ve never seen a rant that included “big boy boxers.” Also just don’t talk to women about their underwear unless you’ve been invited godddamn
cookiedecorating,fdswkai,t3_emzsh2,1578708876.0,Wow beautiful!
fatlogic,fcsk9b0,t1_fcs6ogu,1577918255.0,Lol me neither. I've chewed on a piece of sugarcane before and the fiber puts celery to shame.
fatlogic,fcs6dlh,t1_fcryww3,1577912068.0,If you can get the fiber down it might just net zero
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcob42q,t1_fco8ksw,1577827920.0,I learned the term lampshading recently. It’s where a show points out the problematic nature of what they’re depicting and it absolves the writers by letting the audience know we’re all on the same page about the unacceptable thing. But at the same time the writers still benefit from the use of that thing. It’s really interesting to think about how shows we like are still benefiting from these plot points while condemning them on the surface.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcoam5w,t1_fco7yly,1577827579.0,Me too! I started tinting them in college and I have a lot of pictures from high school where the direct sunlight made them disappear.
