BingeEatingDisorder,ffcganv,t1_ffblqe5,1579798831.0,"The line, ""I think about how amazing it must feel to wake up in the morning and not hate yourself"" just got to me. Like I think I'm making improvements with self esteem, but still at least once a day I feel some kind of guilt or shame or anger about the body I have or the brain I'm fighting. I really admire Kate's willingness to be vulnerable on this platform."
BingeEatingDisorder,ffbfvjq,t3_espiqi,1579763476.0,"Yes, this is a Buzzfeed video, but it's also increasing awareness of BED. I like how Kate differentiates her urges to binge as her ""eating disorder voice"". I also think this video does a good job showing how BED can cloud your mood and self-perception."
AskReddit,ff43ugv,t3_erc1ft,1579554947.0,"As that depressed person who leaned too heavily on their friend and lost them, please tell them you care but be very specific with boundaries. Don't say ""you can call me any time"" if you can't handle the calls. If you have to break off contact, tell them and say why- don't just ghost. If they're telling you things that scare you and are affecting your mental health, tell them that.
I didn't realize what I was doing to my friend until it was too late for our friendship. It's my biggest regret."

GetMotivated,ff1yzmh,t1_feshf1y,1579489448.0,"It made me smile too. I went from having severe depression to my current mild symptoms over the course of about 5 years. I don't think any progress would have happened without trying to keep up my daily routine and making myself seek help. I'll probably be downvoted, but I think the ""oh thanks, I'm cured"" response promotes a helplessness. I don't think this post is saying ""just smile and be happy"", which I'd agree is not useful advice for a person with depression. To me, the post means, ""don't give up""."
GetMotivated,ff1wxvg,t1_fepnxfn,1579488065.0,"To work on improving your depression you must ""press on"", whether it's scheduling therapy appointments, taking your medicine, calling the suicide hotline, etc. It's also just trying to live your life as much as you can and not screw over your future self by going to work/school, not isolating yourself, sleeping, eating, moving, keeping up hygiene, etc. It's not easy at all, but the alternative is much harder."
BingeEatingDisorder,fey1td1,t1_fextnys,1579439677.0,"So I guess I'm less calorie counting and more logging what I ate. Like the calorie count is in hindsight, although I have tried to plan my day's meals in advance to get within my limit (which leads me to rebel instead). I like the fact that I log my binges because I'm forced to see it objectively and face the emotions that come along with it. Most of the time I log within 500 calories of my goal (often 500 above... so at maintenance calories), and then binge days are usually at least 1000 calories above goal.

Edit: I've been consistently logging for about 1.5 months, and binged about 8 times in that period."

That being said, a couple years later, and I'm happy and have a fantastic boyfriend. I'm rarely reminded of him, and when he does come up, I'm no longer upset or angry. I dare say I'm a  better person than I was.
I'm just saying, it gets better."
tumblr,feq5a39,t1_fepkfi3,1579337806.0,"You too? My closest friend broke contact because I relied too much on him at my most depressed. It's a huge regret, but I don't know how it could have gone differently. I hate it, but glad to know I'm not alone."
tumblr,fepmtza,t1_feonpyp,1579324707.0,"When you count your blessings, you're listing the privileges you have. All the blessings you have don't inherently make you evil or undermine your work or make you superior or inferior to others, but they do show the good things in your life, which is important when things seem bad. It also can get you thinking about the people who don't have these blessings and can hopefully increase compassion.

I bet people feel more comfortable with ""counting their blessings"" than with ""checking their privilege"", although I think when you go deep into it, they're the same."
BingeEatingDisorder,fep83tr,t1_fep2cfb,1579314259.0,"Yeah, I hope that thorough meal planning and prep will help, so instead I  can think, ""I have X, Y, and Z for meals and snacks this week, so I don't need A or B."""
BingeEatingDisorder,femh1tu,t1_femfetb,1579255130.0,"I've actually been controlling my binges by counting calories, but my biggest challenge is getting over the mindset that healthy meals take a lot of time and effort to prepare. Like it pretty much takes just as much time to cook eggs and throw together a salad as it does to microwave a tv dinner, but sometimes it doesn't seem that way to me. So on a day to day basis, getting over this hurdle will help."

Volumeeating,fdvvdhi,t3_en0wod,1578751921.0,"Calories: around 1800 with leeway up to 2000 for now. I have a problem with binge eating, so there are several stressful days a month when I've been over 3000 and nearly 4000 calories. Goal is to space out calories to avoid binges, food comas, vomiting, and passing out from restricting.

Activity: has not been my focus because you can't outrun your fork, but long term goal of finishing the C25K program and pipe dream of doing a pull up

Weight: morbidly obese, so the only goal to drop down to the next BMI point and continue until normal. I'd be okay with even maintaining to break the cycle of gaining 10-15 pounds each year."

She wore long fake nails and fake eyelashes- I don't want to think about how much bacteria they'd harbor. She also left foods like alfredo pasta out in the open even though we had a mini-fridge.

BingeEatingDisorder,fcwep8i,t3_ej1jjt,1578023724.0,"How did you separate the goals of stopping disordered eating from other goals like maintaining or losing weight? I'm obese, and I feel the effects of my weight daily, so I feel an urgency to lose weight, which makes me obsess about food, which then leads me to restrict, binge, and purge.  I know that reforming a healthy relationship with food would be better for me in the long run, but is there a way to do it and lose weight?"

Combine the meat of 1 spaghetti squash, 1 small diced onion, 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup, 2 cups low fat Greek yogurt, 2 cups shredded cheddar, 1/3 cup olive oil, and salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Combine in a dish and bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes."

1. I've started out too fast
2. I was too intent on sticking to every detail of the program: run every other day and progress through each week without repeats

Starting too fast with my out-of-shape, obese body got me so winded and sore that I'd reflexively not want to do the next one, and sometimes I'd not even complete that day's workout.
Being too strict with the run schedule meant that as soon as I missed a day, I'd think ""what's the use now?"" and quit. Or if I ""graduated"" to the next week too early, I'd struggle more, quit sooner, and get discouraged.
So I'm trying again, going as slow a jog as I can handle and I'm not beating myself up about missing a day (as long as I try twice a week for now), with the goal of not burning out long enough to make this a habit."
