This is to the commenters on tik tok who kept telling the guy to jump in to get the dog:

No, that's fucking stupid. Then they both would be in danger. He did the absolute right thing by calling the cops and helping the dog get out of the water. Whether or not he was recording wouldn't have made on a difference.

Also, I believe he posted an update about the owners coming to get the dog or something because the dog ran away. Unless I'm confusing it with another video. Most of my fyp on tik tok is dog rescue videos.

Edit: Apparently an article in the comments said the guy was looking to adopt the dog so I did get confused on that part.

Edit 2: Wait, no apparently I was right but he's looking to adopt the dog from the owners who want to rehome him (which that guy is a perfect match)."

You don't have to be best buddies or anything but just going to a coffee shop and meeting with him for an hour and then you can choose whether to keep him in your life or never speak to him again.

At least give him a chance.

The reason I won't give judgment though is that I see a morally better solution but it's not significant enough to warrant calling you an asshole or not an asshole. Nor would it warrant calling anyone else an asshole or not an asshole.

Edit: After thinking about it more YTA.

This is probably the only connection he has. He's probably feeling pretty fucking lonely especially since he has no family-- blood related or not-- o hold onto. Same reason as before, you only have to meet him once. Don't blow him off without even giving him a chance."
