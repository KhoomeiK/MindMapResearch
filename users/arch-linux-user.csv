I don't have a footage of it because none of us were thinking of recording it and I don't think any of my classmates had camera phones back then either. You might be able to find something on Google. It is not something I want to see again, even after 15 years."

Unfortunately, weddings in my country tend to be exorbitant multi-day affairs where 500-1000 ""close relatives"", who wouldn't even remember I exist otherwise, have to be invited, or some cunt somewhere would get offended.

That is also probably why most people in my country stick to their first marriage. They don't usually have the finances or the energy to go through it again."
