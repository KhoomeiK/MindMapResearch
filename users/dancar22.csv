relationships,ff2b3o9,t3_er1dha,1579499286.0,"My boyfriend and I got a one question a day book and it's like this. 

We have fun with it, but we like talk about our bowel movements lol and have talked about trauma. He's seen me at my lowest when I went inpatient and he stayed, and I've been his biggest supporter. 

I'm not saying your relationship sucks, I'm trying to say that maybe he just wasn't ready to get personal? It sounds more like maybe you two aren't as open with communication as you thought. 

The questions are designed to make you guys have a conversation around them.

Has he ever acted this way before?

As someone who can't remember their childhood due to trauma, I don't like invasive questions when I'm not prepared. I don't like when people ask ""what was your favorite childhood memory?"" I genuinely don't know because I can't remember, it's just static. There's a lot of anxiety involved with the tougher questions, but the only way to not be anxious about them is to go through them. 

Maybe let him know the questions first and then he can think of really good answers. There are so many times when I look back and think, ""damn, there was a better answer""

Regardless, maybe he thought you were trying to pry into something that he can't remember. You can't force someone to go through their mental blocks, not that you are -- to me, these are pretty minimally invasive questions. 

I'd ask him why he got so defensive. Just be really clear, and say ""you don't have to get back to me now, but I feel like your reaction to the questions the other night was a little severe. I'm just wondering why so I can avoid making you uncomfortable in the future"""

My two are actually certified ESAs, I didn't just go to my landlord and say, ""hey, I have these two cats deal with it."" It took like two sessions for my therapist to see how we interact together, both my therapist and my psychiatrist had to sign off for them, and they have official ESA paperwork with my landlords and my state. 

Obviously, animals are wonderful and have huge benefits, we're seeing that. I'd definitely say that service animals are priority one and should never ever be faked like this entitled prick is doing, but unfortunately with how ""popular"" ESAs are, people genuinely don't know the difference between ESAs and service animals, and then ESAs and regular household pets. 

So many people have insinuated that I only got my cats ESA forms because I wanted to live in non-pet friendly places, but no. They actually provide a service for me at home. They're kinda prescribed.

AmItheAsshole,fefcabk,t3_eoley4,1579053194.0,"I feel like I, too, went through a rollercoaster of emotions going through all of the comments and omg, dude. I had this EXACT conversation with my soon to be married brother.

He didn't understand why wedding dresses were so expensive. They're tailored, a special type of dress, quality, designer brand (everyone knows Gucci or Prada for regular wear, theres the same for wedding dresses), and yes, there's a slight uptick in price simply because they're wedding dresses. 

Want to know what his response was?

""I just want her to wear whatever makes her happy and shit, I just don't get it. Whatever"" 

Maybe you just don't get it. You're not a dress dude, who cares about you in this scenario the wedding dress is all your fiance's (or seemingly ex-fiance) thing. Not yours. 

This isn't really about the dress is it? Its about you being controlling about what she wears, what she spends, and how she feels. You may not be physically abusive, but dude I'm a trained peer advocate for abuse survivors on my campus and you're exactly what I describe in someone to watch out for. 

The normalizing of yelling. Raising your voice IS NOT NORMAL AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. It's abuse. 

You're controlling in sneaky ways. The dress being an avenue as a way for you to control her on HER day. 

You're refusing to accept blame.

Despite literally thousands of people telling you something, you are the only person on your side. 

You're degrading your partner. You literally said that reddit made up her mind to run to her parents. No, she didn't run to her parents, she needs space which is healthy in a conflict. Also, she has her own mind and can make decisions for herself

You bitched about her ""hiding"" at her parents and calling her immature for being there. No. She's actually being healthy in this situation, you're the one who is not. 

If she's ""entitled, a brat, throwing a tantrum, hiding at her parents, and immature"" (all of these are YOU words) why do you want to be with her?

You're not wrong for reacting the way you are. And he's not wrong for reacting the way he is. You BOTH are going through a hella scary and really big change in your lives, not just because of the cancer but because you're trying to better your life in a drastic way. 

Let's face it. You didn't sign up to be his caretaker. You signed up to be his wife. He didn't sign up for cancer, he signed up to be your husband -- not that your marriage was 100% perfect before but I'm assuming it was better than this. 

What I'm kind of thinking is that YOU haven't processed his cancer in a healthy manner. You kind of skipped over how you felt about it, and went straight into what's kind of (at least for me) comfortable which is spiraling and drinking and breaking down when you're overwhelmed and can't cope and he was too busy to fully comprehend just how hard you were hit with your breakdown. 

The fact that he only sees the absence of sex as the problem IS the problem. He's kind of... I don't know the word... deflecting comes to mind but I don't think thats right. But he isn't seeing and hearing everything that you are actually doing for him, even as his wife you're basically his live in nurse 24/7. I see how hard SOs work for their cancer SOs and its brutal on both of them for separate reasons. My uncle is currently fighting for his life in hospice and my aunt refuses to leave his side. It's heartbreaking watching them.

You are being incredibly empathetic and incredibly absent (not putting blame, just an observation). Your husband seems to have gotten comfortable. It seems like you put yourself on a shelf and stopped communicating about what you need, and your husband needs to listen and hear what you need. This is why you're going to couples therapy. You didn't do anything wrong. No one will sit there and look you dead in the face and say ""I'm glad you came today, now Bipolar Person this is all your fault, buckle up."" Yes, you're going to have to talk about how some things he does triggers you, but that absolutely does not mean anything is your fault. 

NO ONE IS AT FAULT. No one. The situations are complex to deal with and this communication needs to happen in a delicate way. The therapist is only a facilitator. 

My parents with an incredibly healthy relationship go to couples counseling every once in a while (despite one being a therapist and one being a guidance counselor) to keep their communication in check, I've gone to couples therapy with my boyfriend and we aren't even married! 

Couples counseling isn't supposed to be about sides, especially not in a situation like this. You just need to be heard, darling."

BipolarReddit,fdjmydh,t3_eldhfz,1578478711.0,"This is something I think about often and something that won't happen soon for me. 

 If it means anything, no one else in my family has been diagnosed as being bipolar. It's entirely possible that your children or even your grandchildren won't be affected. The thing that is completely true is that the genes are there, but nurture brings it out (not that my parents were bad because they're amazing, there were things that happened out of their control that they never knew about that I suspect contributed). 

Depression, anxiety and cancer run in my family. I look at having children like that. I run over how to look for early signs, how to explain how I am to my children, how to explain what's going on to them if they are diagnosed. I feel so confident that I know how to approach these conversations at every stage of their life to explain whats going on. I personally believe that being honest and open from the beginning at an age appropriate level is really important so they aren't caught off guard at like puberty. 

This is something my partner and I talk about a lot also, and we're confident that we'd be strong parents. I believe the most important things for us is to be vigilant, stay compliant for our children and to be loving.

Stay compliant no matter what. Have a strong support system outside of your partner -- that is a big factor to me. 

I'm constantly rechecking myself to see how my mood is, how my meds work for me, what my phases are like as I continue with my life because with every struggle I get better at handling myself. I also talk to my therapist about this and ask third parties how they think my moods are progressing -- am I getting more stable, am I more responsible, am I perceiving situations correctly?

I have coping skills, my support system has coping skills, my partner has coping skills. I take in criticism well now, I understand that the people in my life are giving me feedback that I will never be able to see because I only have the first hand account.

The road he has ahead of him is a long one. Do you want to put your life and your children's lives on hold further to weather him through his own battles?

BipolarReddit,fcmlpbo,t3_ehxbco,1577780554.0,"Yes, this happens to me. 

My way of dealing is writing a pro and cons list of why we got together and reminding myself that my depression phases dont last forever. 

This also hurts so incredibly much, but I open up to my boyfriend and tell him exactly what I'm feeling and we work through it together. Im also in therapy and that helps wonders. 

Once I got a good depression med list the phases are far and in between and much much shorter and less intense, but they do still happen. 

I hope this helps!"

The best I can see is they buckle down, get their fucking degree FINALLY and tell their parents after the fact and after they have LEGITIMATE degrees and start paying them back. 

Like good lord, at least I'm not saying ""get a fake degree""

Edit: I was totally not supporting this kid at all, it was more of a ""grab this kid by the collar, slap their face, and yell in their face"" type comment"
