Warriors blessing is really not good for anyone but a tank. If that's what you're going for on mid or jungle you're doing it wrong or you're trolling. If you're buying doom orb in the first place you're rushing boots and not even buying a blessing. On jungle if you have warriors blessing your clear is going to be ass because of how camps scale. I've actually done this after having an early game disconnect and bought warriors on accident while jungle. That game did not go well. Yeah I've seen some streamers run warriors blessing as jungle but it's still really just a bad idea and can get you behind easily 

Even if this were a ""thing"" people would do, it would be shit, a waste of gold and would make you lose damage and farm. Sure it might make you tankier but that's it, you're wasting gold on a blessing that would be better spent somewhere else."
