My advice? Take it all in while you can. Learn to love yourself now. Find yourself a support system and surround yourself with people you trust. Nobody will care for you like your mom, once my mom died, I had no one to do little thoughtful things for me, nobody remembers my birthday and sends funny cards. I would give anything to be scolded and fretted after."

LifeProTips,fctgmzu,t3_eilqnx,1577942644.0,"There is already a ton of advice on this thread, so this will likely get lost, but I wanted to add something from the perspective of someone who lost her mother at a young age.
My mom died of cancer three years ago. 
My dad was functional, but stopped making any special effort. He ate, and had the money to eat well, but only did the bare minimum to ensure he was fed. His food consisted of frozen dinners and canned vegetables, which he ate straight from the can. 
I called, even when I had nothing specific to say. I just kept it light and chatted about my day, or something I saw on the news or on the subway. Having the phone ring kept the house from being dead quiet. 
I sent mail, a postcard here, a greeting card, an occasional coffee gift card (to encourage him to leave the house).
I visited him. A lot. I didn’t wait for an invitation, I just bought a train ticket and told him I was coming, and this was when he could pick me up. We did regular things together - grocery shop, make supper at home, watch a tv show. I’d bring my homework and do it quietly at the kitchen table. We would just share space.
I told him I loved him. Sometimes I would give him a little hug. People who have lost a spouse my not have any physical contact for a while and may be lonely for human contact.
I have more ideas, so let me know if you want to hear them. If this helps even one person, this will be worth it."
