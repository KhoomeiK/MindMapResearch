depression,ffay8nc,t3_esiwop,1579747263.0,"Hey friend, wishing you all the best. I myself have been struggling with keeping a constant work out routine, but can tell you from May to Novembet I noticed a HUGE change! Naturally not seeing any progress in the beginning was hard to get around, but now that it's January, the progress is insane. If you need a workout buddy to keep you on the short and narrow, I'd love to help out!"
AskReddit,ffaxz6m,t3_eskc2n,1579747091.0,"No idea why, but if I'm watching a guy and he grunts in just the right way it sends me down a rabbit hole of no return.

Also helps the dude I'm into is an overweight gamer and we started playing Destiny 2 together, let me tell you those first few games were HEAVEN."

depression,fezzij9,t1_few1hhv,1579463562.0,"Thanks for responding, and your suggestions are all good suggestions, just they're stuff I'm already doing. I have a 3 year old cat who loves me, I even use a body pillow at night to help sleep.

The issue is that nothing is responding to my depression. I attended this Acute Day Treatment program that lasted 5 weeks about 2 1/2 years ago? And while it was good, all their suggestions and work I did ultimately were things I've been told to try already. I do try and game with friends online, if anything just to hear another voice, but like I said, the main issue is just nothing is responding to my depression and I'm feeling more and more hopeless as the days pass along.

Thank you so much for your suggestions though, and while they are things that I already do, I do sincerely appreciate you trying to give some damm decent help."
depression,fesq6nn,t3_eq7hc5,1579367867.0,"I am absolutely so sorry. 2 years ago I was in the same place when I lost my dog who was my best friend and only reason to continue living without committing suicide. Every day was nearly impossible and felt worse off than the next day, but somehow I got to where I am today with a new pet, a female tortieshell named Mufasa.

That being said, the day my dog did die I had what I believe wasn't a dream but a doorway into where she was. A beautiful, warm summer place that she was running around and playing with quite a number of different animals.

Just know that you have beautiful memories of your precious baby, and that the days can pass, slowly and achingly, but they can and will pass one day at a time."

TwoXChromosomes,feso8ag,t3_eqhi8w,1579367345.0,"Hey hun, I can't say I've gone through the same thing since I've yet to get pregnant (knock on wood) but the only strain of advice I can give is do what is best for YOU. This is your body, your choice and you are doing what's best for you.

You're super strong for going through this, and I'm sending nothing but positive vibes your way! This is a difficult time you're going through, but I'll be hoping and thinking about you and your family during this hard time!"
narcissisticparents,ferv7mu,t1_ferp2k7,1579358644.0,"Oh man I am so sorry :( My father tried that and would hold things against me for a long time saying ""Oh I did X for you"" even though whatever X was, was a few years ago >:( It's good you do keep trying to reach out to him!"

AssassinsCreedOdyssey,feox7in,t3_eq4msq,1579307347.0,"I have to agree with you. My last Assassin's Creed I completed was 3, WAY back, but I started with the first one at the same age you did. Naturally I dipped my toes into a few of the other games but nothing caught my attention.

Picked it up on the Holiday Sale Sony had so my sister and I can experience it (we share PS4 accounts) and honestly I'm blown away. Literally everything you've said has held true, this game is absolutely FANTASTIC and I haven't felt this excited about an Assassin's Creed game in a LONG time."
