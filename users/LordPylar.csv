I find it hard to believe that he told no one, if a child told me that I would be horrified for the child's sake, what kind of kid comes up with twisted stuff like that? Needless to say, he said nothing, and most likely will never be involved with your life again."

Like; if to them the color of someone‚Äôs skin is as common as everyone having an arm, would it ever occur to them to make skin color a big deal? Like, we all have arms, at most 2, so to us, the concept of discriminating against someone with 3 or 4 arms is alien. Just like to a white person who had never seen or heard of a person who is a different skin color, the idea of a black or brown person is weird and alien to them."

It seemed especially back then some of those agencies had a bit more... agency than what they do now. Eisenhower most likely wasn‚Äôt as involved in those operations as higher ups in the CIA were. 

I also really admire his foresight in the creation of the interstate highway system, he is responsible for one of the most widespread public infrastructure projects in this country, as well as the creation of NASA. 

The thing i admire most though is him being responsible for the first civil rights legislation since the 1860s. If only he had gone further, we could be 20 years ahead in many ways when it comes to race in this country."

Girls like Mia Khalifa sign contracts, get paid, and are promoted by porn companies. ‚ÄúAmateur‚Äù porn, or whatever you want to call it, is just one more step removed from having any semblance of a system or giving a girl any sort of control. 

It‚Äôs laughable you think this means anything, and regardless of what you think a lack of massive boobs or ‚Äò8‚Äù cocks‚Äô means for the viewer, it‚Äôs still manipulating their brain chemistry. Children‚Äôs brain chemistry.

Porn has existed for a while now, but for most of its existence it was restricted to magazines, pictures, and if any avid porn consumer today looked at one, they would probably not get much of a kick out of any of it. The women are mostly clothed, albeit scantily, and most of the time aren‚Äôt having sex. This is what most people older than 40 knew as porn pre-internet. 

Things have changed now, they‚Äôre not just magazines. It‚Äôs thousands of hours of hardcore porn. It‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of easily accessible videos, where in some cases, women are being ‚Äúraped‚Äù for the ‚Äúplot‚Äù of the video. 

Yeah, people are getting off to watching simulated rape. 

You think that‚Äôs fine? Your kids would never. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre fine. They‚Äôre probably watching the good stuff. They will just only watch the most vanilla possible. Maybe that‚Äôs true, maybe it was true at first, but a porn addiction sadly, like many addictions, will build a tolerance to it over time. Your children will eventually need more and more porn to satisfy their brain. And it won‚Äôt be the ‚Äúgood‚Äù porn. It will be the twisted stuff, stuff that makes them as excited as watching it for the first time. 

Trust me, I know. I‚Äôve struggled with porn addiction. I watched my dad struggle with it. I watched him almost tear my family apart with his selfishness. One day, porn just didn‚Äôt do it for him anymore, he wanted more. He wanted to talk to a prostitute, just talk, nothing else. He eventually cheated on my mother. He had an affair, betrayed her, and our, trust.

Porn ruins *everything*. Do you really think all those poor girls just *love* to be treated like absolute shit? You‚Äôd like to think they do. I certainly hope they do, because in that industry, it‚Äôs all their good for, and by the time they‚Äôre 30, they‚Äôre all washed up. Oh sure you got that specialty stuff, but you think most women fit that genre? They‚Äôre cast aside, time for the next generation of 18 year olds to make a quick buck off of their bodies. 

You know, I watched a youtube video the other day. It was about this woman who used to be a famous porn star in the 90s. She lived in a little shack that was falling apart in the dessert. She was addicted to meth. She had no friends or family, she never really got anything out of the industry. It‚Äôs funny, people still watch a lot of her videos. I wonder how many know or care that she‚Äôs now virtually homeless? 

But you‚Äôre right, silly me, it‚Äôs all about the amateur stuff now! Maybe their screams for help will be more realistic, now that they‚Äôre not being paid. You won‚Äôt care though. You don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why you watch it, and let your kids watch it. 

I beg you. Please, please get counseling for this. Get your kids counseling too. Before it‚Äôs too late, before their emotional development is permanently stifled, before they decide that porn just doesn‚Äôt do it anymore. Before they themselves sell their own bodies. would you approve of that? Even if it‚Äôs their choice, do you like the idea of them being porn stars, your own daughters? If not, realize those girls are someone‚Äôs daughter, someone‚Äôs sister.
