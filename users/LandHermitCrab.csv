Secondly, ndp built a cancer hospital, didn't fuck with the royalties, and curtailed oil to show the government was willing to restrict supply so our oil price shot up... And stayed up despite having more of a glut than before. They also gave out corporate welfare that was tied to job creation, conversely, Kenney just gave handouts and co's fired people.

The PC's have been entitled and incompetent for decades before Notley. Kenney is back at it."

Calgary,fenj7zd,t1_fen7tlu,1579285856.0,"Look at what he's accomplished.  Pretty much nothing positive.  He was all blustery and talking a big game before the election.  All he's done is slashed corporate taxes and cut services; re-directed tax dollars from citizen services to corporations.  This move didn't save or create any jobs, but just cut quality of life for Albertans.  In fact, many companies had job cuts right after these tax breaks bc the breaks weren't contingent on job creation.  (Notley on the other hand, made corporate welfare contingent on job creation in the form of the innovation fund.)  How is Kenney helping Albertans?  But yeah, I'm real cynical bc I'm not seeing all the jobs Kenney has created or all the good stuff he's accomplished.  Tell me why you're still pro-Kenney at this point?"

I looked basically the same as I usually do, but I had on about double the layers.  Also, the fabric is very important too.

To be specific, here are my invisible things I did just for today: heavy weight merino long underwear, thicker ski socks, another set of oversized gloves over my normal ones, tucked my first layer t-shirt into my pants, windproof toque under my normal one, a balaclava under both toques (ok, you can kind of see this, but usually I'm wearing a neck tube), another mid layer jacket, and switched the outer jacket from a breathable softshell to a hardshell goretex that doesn't breathe at all but is windproof.

On the flip side, the classic Calgary pedestrian uniform of all black stealth ops is great for absorbing the little thermal energy from the sun we have but is terrible for helping drivers see you at night. An led light, a phone screen, or at least one piece of bright AND reflective clothing at least gives the drivers a better chance to see you.
