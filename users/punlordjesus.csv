NatureIsFuckingLit,ff6593l,t1_ff5kydj,1579619446.0,"They look pretty human like, but with proportions that more closely resemble baby feet than adult feet. Maybe that is why we find them so cute."
MINI,ff1ygvn,t3_er5siy,1579489084.0,Great shot.
AskReddit,ff1w5sz,t1_fezjah8,1579487542.0,Yep! Alarmy. Works great for me and my type II narcolepsy.
aww,fet0ew6,t1_feswwjm,1579370677.0,"Haha sorry I assumed you knew but wanted to elaborate for the people who don’t! 

Fjord horses are so pretty. We have a Scottish highland pony at the barn where I work, and he has that gorgeous fjord-like dun coloring. He’s my favorite aside from the mini horse that I train."
aww,fesqb87,t1_feshlc9,1579367904.0,"The special gait is called a tölt. It’s a smooth, 4-beat gait, and is only naturally found in Icelandic horses."
EyebrowAddiction,fep1h65,t1_fenjtno,1579310022.0,"I would suggest that you try to gel those hairs that make up the dark line in the eyebrow you want to fix. If you comb them with a spoolie and then gel them up into a shape similar to your good eyebrow, I think it will get you close to what you are looking for without making any permanent changes! I like benefit’s clear brow gel. Definitely get clear gel instead of tinted- you can use as much as you need to without a bunch of color build up."
EyebrowAddiction,femxia6,t3_epuxi9,1579272173.0,Will you reply to this comment so I remember to come back and give you advice after work?
MINI,fe69fqa,t1_fe5z7mb,1578884722.0,When this one eventually dies I’m getting another and using this as a parts car. Hopefully I have many many miles left on it though!
MINI,fe69dst,t1_fe633ew,1578884684.0,Another mini Mainer??
MINI,fe69cgj,t1_fe684bd,1578884660.0,"I used glossy black spray paint and carefully taped over the “s” and the light (and popped out the side scuttle). If you get any spray paint somewhere you don’t want it to be, 100% acetone nail polish remover will take it off pretty easily especially before it’s dry!"
nottheonion,fdp3qlb,t1_fdovmou,1578619287.0,"Yay, a Mainer! Hi."
MINI,fdabr85,t1_fdaao6i,1578244254.0,Thank you :)
MINI,fdaa9mk,t3_ekcbme,1578243594.0,What tape did you buy to do this?
MINI,fd40hbw,t1_fd2757h,1578163244.0,Oh! Whoosh. Now I get your joke. Sorry.
MINI,fd1vhji,t1_fd040cc,1578137458.0,I think it’s a joke about how they’re all lit up (like a Christmas tree).
MINI,fczq8ma,t1_fczpc06,1578106703.0,"Seconded, but I’d also add that it didn’t take a huge amount of time for me to wrap the side scuttles and paint the grille trim as well (although I‘m likely going to go back and wrap the grille trim- the paint chips easily from dirt and rocks). 

The door handles took the most time, but I’m replacing the wrap on those with black door handle caps from eBay because I had a hard time getting the wrap to look good and the caps can be found for cheap."
MINI,fcwfqs2,t3_ej2ooh,1578024467.0,I love how often I see other coupes on here :)
MINI,fcwfglg,t1_fcwevpk,1578024264.0,"Honestly I wish it was black, but it’s dark enough that I can pretend. I don’t like how the dark grey looks green in some light but oh well!"
MINI,fcwer9b,t3_ej7z82,1578023763.0,"Yay, welcome to the r58 club! Mine is a dark grey 2012. Also an S."

MINI,fcpe7tq,t1_fcpag0b,1577860195.0,Heather? Or Karen? I can’t remember which one he hosted with lol
MINI,fcp82q0,t3_eic0qj,1577853613.0,Ooh you live in Nashville. Do you know who Neil is? On WKRN
MINI,fcp63g6,t1_fcnogb9,1577851687.0,"The link worked! It looks great from above too. You should get a drone shot, though, from directly above. A video of the drone flying over it with the video ending when the stripes match up would qualify for r/oddlysatisfying :)

Love the wrap. Again, one of the few flashy (as in, not just a solid color) wraps that I like."
MINI,fcnnbg9,t3_ei4wn5,1577814743.0,"I’m usually not a fan at all of flashy wraps, but this is cool. Do you have a birds eye view? I want to see all the stripes match up, haha

I will say I’m not a fan of the angry eyes (shoutout r/heeps) but to each their own, of course :)"
MINI,fcnmrec,t1_fb6bi4i,1577814453.0,People ask me if my coop coupe is a Fiat all the time. :( Second most common question after “Does the top come off? ....Are you sure?”
aww,fclly3t,t1_fclc5hn,1577750884.0,You have no idea how flattered I am by that question lmao. I’ve only seen the first Deadpool but negasonic teenage warhead has always been my favorite character from it
aww,fckuc9s,t1_fcktj81,1577733368.0,"I think they’re as smart as some dog breeds (not as smart as a border collie, for example). I’ve found that horses are a little harder to train, but the key is breaking down the trick into the smallest steps possible. Then you just reward them when they do what you’re asking, and move on to the next step once the previous one is mastered."
aww,fckt98t,t1_fckrn5t,1577732697.0,"[He does!](https://imgur.com/a/c5IP0bn) We were asking him to run in this video (he was being sassy that day, hence the kicking) but it looks the same as when he is just zooming around because he feels like it. 

I can also [call him over on command](https://imgur.com/a/ahFYlX1). Trick training him is part of my job. I’ve taught him other tricks too; he’s very smart."
BirdsArentReal,fc37qsb,t1_fc33t8i,1577383494.0,You better not fly (or else the government drones will shoot you down)
fashionporn,fb8l4ho,t1_fb65urj,1576616264.0,"It’s an illusion neckline! If you look closely, you can see that the mesh is actually attached to and supported by the rhinestone “necklace”. So the top is structured more like a v-neck t shirt than a strapless or halter dress."
