Why are you there if you aren't gonna give your kid antibiotics and think your doctor is a liar? Why go if you aren't interested in discussing your health and think doctors are biased and uninformed? What could they possibly offer? 

I know I will never get an answer but I fucking always wonder like, you can get antidepressants from a psychiatrist and never see a regular doctor. If you're that amazingly healthy why go at all?"
fatlogic,ff7fu1g,t1_ff7fe5v,1579648575.0,"This is also such a weird thing to brag about. No one NO ONE goes into mammogram thinking they won't have to expose their breasts. I thought I had something happening (I did not) and was sent for one as a precaution since I'm still fairly young and it was my expectation the whole time I was gonna show my breasts to everyone who needed to see them. I want to ask this person what the FUCK their line of thinking was. These kinds of exams ALWAYS require exposure. NO ONE likes it. No one forces you to go. So if you draw a fucking line on taking your shirt off WHY the fuck would you steal a time slot from someone else who wants to be there at your time? 

I'm also really sorry to hear about your friends. I lost family to breast cancer and I'm sensitive about it."
fatlogic,ff76m4p,t3_erxxgo,1579642144.0,"I was boobs out, half naked at my last mammogram. Whatever, right? I've worked with nurses and I know they've seen way worse than my body and yeah it sucks to be vulnerable but you do it. I mean you don't ask your gyno to just push the underwear to the side and do the exam, you fucking expose your genitals to them even though it's generally not fun. 

I don't understand how leaving a shirt on fits with FA at all, like bring a robe that fits you absolutely but you should get naked LIKE EVERY OTHER BODY THAT COMES THROUGH or don't waste everyone's time."
socialwork,fdt62y7,t3_en0wj8,1578712399.0,"Let's have a meeting about how we could make this job less stressful? 

Oh I know! Pick me! We could have less hour long meetings during peak times for talking to clients, which cause me to try and catch up by spending the rest of my day running around getting things done and seeing people!! 

Oh? No? More meetings. Okay."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdshkov,t3_emzpkf,1578702886.0,"You don't even have to sign over your rights. Men dip constantly and convince women they're not real mother's if they depend on child support. Other pick-mes will help deadbeats uphold this idea ""I don't DEPEND on child support, real women don't need it!""

But like. In what world can men not opt out of fatherhood consequence free? My oldest daughters dad did it and his family helped him, shielded him, and blamed me completely. His girlfriend's after me enabled him. Shit, men will abandon kids they've been raising for years with barely a goodbye."
RagenChastain,fdnrtni,t1_fdne5qm,1578591551.0,"Yeah I can't deny that if someone decides to tell me their wife recently passed away in a grocery store because my face makes me seem like I care, they are 100% right please tell me more. 
Oh you want directions here let me draw you a detailed map, it's no problem at all. I'm glad I'm not alone!"
socialwork,fdn61o4,t1_fdmi9ri,1578578275.0,"I opted out of the health insurance because I already had it and it cost 1500 a semester but no, that is just tuition. If you tacked housing into it, they estimate borrowing 54k. And then my advisor suggested quitting my job so I didn't have to spread my practicum hours into the summer and graduate a semester late and I remember sitting there stunned, wanting to be like, do you know what it costs to fucking be here? I don't have daddy's money."
RagenChastain,fdm7czd,t1_fdm5xm7,1578541600.0,"I live in the Midwest and I have resting nice face, and people talk to me less than they constantly harass her. Her body shape isn't special, it's all over the place. It's not shocking at all. I feel like shes trying to construct this reality where everyone around her is a beautiful model who is intensely disgusted by her genuine, humble attempts to just be talented and athletic and authentic because she lives in a bigger body when in reality, a lot of people look a lot like her."
RagenChastain,fdli72r,t3_em08go,1578524562.0,"Is this a common experience? No one at my gym makes eye contact with each other. No one ever spoke to me until I was down 75lbs and it was a pick up attempt that ended in 8 seconds. I never see people talking to strangers although to be fair I am trying so hard to see nothing because oh God don't look at me I'm so sweaty. 

But she's writing like people are just sprinting to her to have a conversation and I'm just curious if this happens to other people, or if this is a weird made up fantasy where she's always the center of everyone's attention? Like, you feel like everyone is staring so you assume it's true when in reality everyone is too worried about themselves to care about you, but you get defensive and imagine made up conversations and your replies but then you blog about it as if it's real life because you need content and ""no one gives a shit about me or my life"" is less interesting than ""everyone wants to talk to me and about me all the time."""
fatlogic,fddvc5e,t1_fdclmze,1578324880.0,"Same! Also no one is making eye contact with other people at my gym which I appreciate. We're here, we're sweaty, DON'T LOOK AT US."
fatlogic,fdduqz4,t3_eks3ma,1578324468.0,"My new years resolution last year was to lose weight and I lost 85lbs. 

Diets!do!work! If you fucking don't view a diet as an all or nothing scenario of 500 calories a day that is just lettuce and cayenne water. I ate very normally, went out, drank, etc, nothing changed except my body weight because I ate at a loss and moved my body around. 

So maybe instead of getting angry about other people dieting, give yourself permission to stay the same weight and then live your truth instead of projecting your insecurities onto other people. You can't/don't want to lose the weight, it's your body and your choice but you lose me when you want to police everyone else's bodies to be like yours so you feel better about yourself."
WeightLossAdvice,fd5ezkf,t1_fd57ppv,1578176965.0,If only though. I've been focusing a lot more on fitness since I've lost the majority of weight and I thought all this cardio would make me a flawless athlete WRONG. I'm way better than when I started and it was easier to run without 85 extra pounds but that first work out was so humbling.

1200isfineIGUESSugh,fcauqzs,t1_fcafnlu,1577577003.0,"True that. My mom gained everything she lost + some two years after her WLS and is now on medicine to help her relose it. Such a waste of time and money. My way has been slower and more frustrating but I needed to learn to eat healthier and what kind of exercise I enjoyed in order to make this sustainable to me. 

And for anyone frustrated with the slowness of losing weight (I feel you) my best friend got WLS a month after I started just CICO and a year out for us both, we'd lost the same total amount of weight. She plateaued, and I'm still going though it's slow since I'm 15lbs away from being done, but in the end, we ended up at the exact same weight defecit and as far from our original goal 12 months later. You can do this! No matter how you start, as long as you keep going you'll get there!"
fatlogic,fbql5zm,t1_fbqjto5,1577032834.0,"Also I sit at a desk every day and my kids spend an hour running almost nonstop at recess and then come home to run and bounce and play while I fantasize about going back to sleep. 
We are not the same. Our needs are not the same. I go to the gym for an hour, on average four days a week (some weeks better some worse) but I doubt I burn half the calories they do and I'm making EFFORT."
