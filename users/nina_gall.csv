Hopefully I can get past the desire to go to the store for the purpose of buying a pack.  I'm learning tricks here and there.  Was so happy that yesterday I DIDNT have a pack, and only smoked 2 that I bummed off my mom when she came by the house.  Now I need to get HER a juul, since she picked smoking back up about a year ago, after her quitting for 10yrs."
unpopularopinion,fdoh61u,t1_fdnby0z,1578605058.0,"My husband used to smoke years ago, then moved to chewing tobacco.  His desire to not lose his face to oral cancer led him to vaping.  He uses fruity flavors, and I give him shit about the grandiose nature of his vapor cloud exhale.  I'm just not interested in the flavors, so I've settled on juuls classic flavor, as the Virginia flavor I didnt enjoy as much.  Not really into menthol.  Even with juul at $18 for 4 pods, it's still cheaper than cigarettes.  Also, I like that juul is small compared to the ridiculous rig sizes out there."
