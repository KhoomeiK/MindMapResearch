If it’s anything like mine they place the pills in your vagina and then some pain killers up your butt. Things will be ok for a while but then they become painful. I have never felt such a pain. It is ok to ask for further painkillers. The injected me with morphine the pain got that bad. That is something they didn’t tell me and I wish I’d known so I could have been better prepared. 

I know what you’re doing is going to be hard, but if it’s not a viable option to keep the child then you’re doing the right thing. You are strong and you are a good person for choosing to do this.

Edit. Spelling. Also I would definitely seek counselling if you can, I’m not sure what area of the world you’re in but if that’s an option definitely take it."

It helps me zone out and just forget my depression and anxiety. I have found though that if I am playing WoW I am unable to complete story games so currently taking a break to play my PS4/switch."

veganuk,fcbb1gf,t3_egu209,1577584674.0,Can anyone comment to the texture/taste of the Richmond sausages? My only gripe with vegan sausages is they’re usually a bit dry.
