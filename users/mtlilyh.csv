SuicideWatch,ff3f9cw,t3_erd49e,1579539863.0,"I do this to myself all the time. I’m glad you’re here and made this post because I was feeling alone and stupid for trying to reach out to help people when I am so emotionally bankrupt myself. I needed to read your post. 
So thank you.
And if you, like me, could use a friend, maybe we can talk sometime."
depression,ff1nbwa,t3_er3lp6,1579482036.0,That is true malevolence. Monsters exist. I’m so sorry you had to go through this. My deepest condolences.

There are a lot of other possible explanations for those symptoms. I understand you are in dire poverty as well and your options are severely limited. 
I wish to god I could get you over here for some proper health care and attention. I’m so sorry you’re going through this!"

SuicideWatch,fdp9fdi,t3_emjsqj,1578623095.0,"Hey, I’m so proud of you for putting your shame out there. Guess what? There’s nothing virtuous about something that is intrinsically harmless. True virtue happens when someone has the ability to cause harm and chooses not to. 
It sounds like you have some mental illness going on. It can make you pretty fucked up, think fucked up things, but it doesn’t mean you’re evil. Evil people aren’t ashamed. Evil people don’t think about killing them selves to prevent harming others. 
I’m a survivor of a man who made the choice to act on his attraction to young children, just for context. I don’t say this lightly. 
Sounds to me like you need help, therapy, from someone who really knows what they’re doing. It’s no shame to get help. It would be the bravest goddamn thing you’ve ever done! Find a therapist who knows enough about the world not to be shocked or reject you for confiding these issues, and take the leap of faith. You’ve already done it in a small way by posting this. People who help ppl like you are out there. I’m even friends with one of them! Human brains are fucking complicated. We don’t always have control over what we think or feel, but we can relearn. We can recover. It’s possible. And I believe in you."
SuicideWatch,fdp87tp,t3_em8cip,1578622288.0,"Hey, I can’t offer much, but I’m a damn good friend. I will commit to texting/messaging u to check on ya every single day that you don’t give up and stay alive! What do u have to lose? I’m so sorry you’ve had such tragedy in your life. If I could do more I swear I would!"
OldSchoolCool,fdp7csw,t3_emiij5,1578621708.0,Absolutely legit cool.
SuicideWatch,fdp6zf1,t3_emgshh,1578621460.0,"I totally get that. But honestly, I didn’t have a clue what to do with my life either. And my life goal was magically winning the lottery so I’d never have to do anything. I’d been horribly depressed since my traumatic childhood. Totally lost soul. 
Moving wasn’t a picnic for me either, went through a horrible abusive relationship, mental breakdown, tons of self harm, suicidal and then legit homelessness. Sometimes I have no idea how I got through. BUT, here I am, doing something I love and am good at, making a living (not rich) and have a sense of self worth for the first time EVER. And I’m getting stronger every day. I just hate the thought that I almost gave up before I got here. I was that close. I’d hate to see you give up too. I’m 33f. If u ever need a safe non judgmental listener I’m here. I’m happy to give u my cell #. Even if you just need someone to text and vent to now and then. 

Here’s my angle: I spend a little time on this subreddit and a few others every evening reaching out to people, because a few people along the way did it for me and it’s probably the reason I’m still here. Now I’m finally at a place in my life where I have something to offer back to the world, and it makes me feel good! Don’t know if any of this is helpful to you but it’s worth it to me to try. I’m still in pain myself at times, still lonely and hurting and depressed, but that’s what makes me a good listener: I know how it feels. 

Wish you the best, I really truly do. If I had more to offer I would!"
SuicideWatch,fdp5kn1,t3_emiwwe,1578620516.0,"I’m so glad! Thank YOU for letting me know it was helpful:) that literally made my day.

Honestly, I have scars ALL over my body. Some put there by me and some by nature. Some in my head and heart. Some still pain me to look at and are visible to the public. But here’s the thing: NOBODY LIVES A REAL LIFE AND GETS THROUGH UNSCATHED! My scars are my battle wounds. I am proud of them! I was wounded and survived! I’m a warrior! And now I’m stronger than EVER and lift other people up and my mere presence signals to everyone I meet that they can be themselves with me and trust me, because I’m authentic, genuine. You will be like that too, when you’re older, I can already tell! 

Stay strong my friend. This is only the beginning! Don’t worry so much about getting through life unscathed. Worry about being too afraid to get hurt to really live, really love. Life isn’t always glamorous. Sometimes bravely looks like just doing what you have to do day by day to achieve adulthood so you can strike out on your own and then BOOM! You’ll find yourself doing cool things and meeting cool people who truly respect and understand you. 
A tough part of growing up is realizing ALL ADULTS, including parents, ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE, who often don’t have a clue what they’re doing or why. Take what your parents say with a grain of salt. I’ve learned that even ppl who genuinely love you don’t always know what you need or get who you are, and that’s ok! You’ll find your way, I promise, if you don’t give up on your self before you even get to the part where you’re really living. 

Always here if you need a safe listener. 
Good luck, fellow warrior. Borrow my hope until you find your own."
SuicideWatch,fdp3fvg,t3_emgshh,1578619084.0,"Hey friend! I was totally in your shoes a few years ago, don’t give up just yet!!! A LOT can change in just a few years trust me. I moved across the country and fell into my dream job, and I didn’t even know what it was or that it existed and I was totally unqualified. The only way to really truly fail at life is to give up. Hang on! I’m dead serious here to talk. HMU if u need a good listener!"

I myself have struggled with self harm, and whether you did do something to yourself (I believe you didn’t) or not them acting that way and freaking out is TOTALLY UNHELPFUL! Not your fault."

SuicideWatch,fdnzq50,t3_emb49z,1578596141.0,"Hope I’m not overstepping, but here’s my 2 cents:

Something that helped me when I’ve embarrassed myself is a line written by Steve Biko:   “The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed “
His success in ruining you depends partially upon your acceptance of his assertion that he holds the ability to ruin you. 

Stay strong. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES. Your life is worth 1,000 more than this asshole hassling you atm, and I’d bet my life that in the not too distant future this will be little more than a shitty but informative learning experience. Your nude body isn’t something to be ashamed of. If someone sees a pic of it, fine. I know the pain is real and raw rn, believe me I’m not trying to discount that, but if you can hang in there a bit longer and give yourself permission to both forgive yourself and maybe even apply your sense of humor to cope, things will get better. DONT LET ANYONE SHAME YOU FOR BEING A FLAWED HUMAN! Your value is completely and utterly independent of this unfortunate situation. 

As for your girlfriend, give it time. Stay humble, but stop short of humiliation. Trust can be rebuilt. If the relationship is meant to stand the test of time, there will appear a way through in the end.

Wishing you all the best, truly!!!"

I’m older now (33f) but I remember those days, and I’ve struggled for years with serious mental health issues. Please pm me at any time, I’d be happy to talk.

There are lots of other standards for bezel thickness or prong setting etc. He makes heirloom quality fine jewelry, though so I guess it really depends on if you want a certain look or want it to last a long time."

We are suffering from depression. It’s NOT your fault that you feel so awful. There’s every reason to resent existence and feel despair. What is amazing is that anyone is able to get up and go on living at all!
Anyway, my brother suggested I look him up and while it doesn’t replace the therapy I badly need it’s helping me until I can get it. Maybe worth a try. I’m recommending to everyone I meet who is suffering just in case."
