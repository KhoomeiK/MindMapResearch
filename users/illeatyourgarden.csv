childfree,ff57cfp,t1_ff4pwbg,1579582346.0,"Having that baby would have ruined my life and I would never want to risk putting that on someone.

My best girl friend is unhappily married. Recently her 14 year old daughter asked if she only got married because she got pregnant with her. Of course she couldn't tell her the truth, but her daughter isn't stupid. 

I'm glad I'm not alone. No one should have a baby unless they truly want to be a parent. None of it appeals to me."

childfree,ff458aq,t1_ff43b0y,1579555814.0,"We actually have them about 60% of the time. Thursday-Sunday full time and Monday-Wednesday after school (2:15-5:30). I see them quite often and do interact with them, but I'm not a parent and I don't try to be. I pretty much treat them like roommates, young roommates, but still roommates. I've NEVER wanted to be a mom so it's easy for me to not get overly involved. Of course I help my husband out wherever he needs me, rides, make food, help clean, etc., but he's a type A and likes to do everything himself as much as possible. He's a VERY active father, and I don't want to take time away from his kids so when they're around I often go ghost and do my own thing. Plus I have 4 dogs so it's easy to keep busy with my own stuff. 

I grew up with my ""stepmom"" (not married but they've been together for 20+years) being awful and trying to overly parent me. She spied on me, listened to my phone conversations, and followed me. Once I came home to her waiting in my bedroom to yell at me for something she ""caught"" me doing. She made my childhood miserable. So I try to do the exact opposite of what she did/would do. I never in a million years thought I would end up married, let alone to a man with children, but here I am.

All families are different and this level of, mostly removed, stepparenting works for us."

Since we've been playing we've been with many women together and a few men, not sure my husband has ever high-fived any of the men, but he's definitely not less of a man for being okay with his woman fucking other men. 

Am I less of a woman because I like watching him fuck other women?

Also why do you care what other people do in their marriage?? If no one is getting hurt you literally have no reason to be concerned."

AskWomen,fblzp1z,t3_edw0cq,1576974491.0,"Six months before my wedding my hair was almost to my waist but it was in need of a trim and two tone from growing out from a dye job a few years previously. 

The first thing I said when I sat in the hairdresser's chair was ""I need a change but I don't want to take too much off since I'm getting married in six months and want my hair long for the wedding""

She died it in a way that was supposed to make it look more ombre than just crazy long roots but then cut it all off and chopped my hair to my shoulders. I trusted her, wasn't facing a mirror and honestly I have no idea how I didn't notice she was taking off so much length.

I was so upset I threw money at her and ran out the door. 

My hair is curly so after drying it was even shorter and my hair was nowhere near as long as I wanted it for my wedding. 

When I confronted her later about how much hair she took off and how the dye job actually looked exactly the same after her work as it did before, she said that she must have cut off all the dyed hair and that's why the color looked the same and claimed that I never told her I wanted to leave my hair long. Why would you dye hair only to cut it all off??? She had no answer for that question.

To make matters worse she was a client of mine. A few weeks before this I had groomed her Yorkie, always cut her top knot short but that day, hours AFTER dropping the dog off to me she told me she wanted to leave it long, but I had already cut it, it was too late. 

When I confronted her about my awful haircut she brought up that I cut her dog's hair off. To which I responded ""I cut it the way I always had, if you wanted it different you should have told me when you dropped the dog off, I only took about a half inch off the dog's hair and your dog isn't getting married in six months!!"" She also refused to refund me. Needless to say she's no longer a client and she can also go f*** herself.

 Lesson learned never do business with a client outside of your own business."
