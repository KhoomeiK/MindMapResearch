Nothing wrong with monogamy, just saying the idea of making sex sacred is conditioned onto society. Being properly formed has nothing to do with it. 

If you act like you wouldn't want to have sex with the sexiest woman on earth, and a woman with the sexiest man on earth, you're lying through the skin of your teeth. Having sex with another can still mean no love lost for a loved one. It's the lack of control of a primitive evolved emotion, jealousy, that makes it so taboo. An adult with proper control of those emotions should be able to swing with another without crying bloody murder. But again, it's just conditioning, nothing more."

In thirty years all organs will be printed. In fifty to sixty years brains will be transplanted into robots or cloned lab grown bodies. It's like a flat screen, after ten years everyone owns one.

To put this in perspective, there is a billion dollar bet out there that the first person to live to 150 is already alive. You'd have to Google it. The Harvard scientist I mentioned said within a decade there will be significant products available to allow a decade or two longer life, however I can't speak to whether the fda will allow it yet, but you bet in other countries it'll be allowed, same as stem cell injections to cure injuries. Also, Google future timeline website for an amazing experience reading legitimate scientific news articles about future technology according to decade, going centuries into the future.

And yes, we will 1000% halt aging. It's purely imperfect genetic evolution, which only cares to live enough to breed. Imagine wolves, which took millions of years to come to fruition. They still carry genetic imperfections that cause early death. In a few thousand years we turned them into mini poodles, through natural selection, not chance like mother nature. Now imagine we can alter the genetic code like a programmer. That's crispr. There are 7 markers to ageing but you'd have to Google it. Essentially its mostly genetic and crispr can fix all of it. Aside from that, once brain transplants start taking place, why stay in the same body anyways? When you can go into a cybernetic superhuman frame?"
