bipolar,feipz1d,t3_epd9o7,1579144317.0,"I’m only 24, but this reminds me of myself a few years ago that I was simultaneously on my fucking A game while making the most self destructive decisions of my life.

I had suspicions since high school. Regardless whether you’re bipolar or not, there is obviously something going on. Whatever it is, know you aren’t looking for attention and you’re not making it up. I believe you and your pain. Get help, I wish I would’ve sooner."
bipolar,feiomhb,t3_ep87o7,1579143407.0,"God I feel the same way. I’m a hospital medic, going back to school soon for psychology. I used to do theater and my professor told me I was the only one he saw making it. I stopped. Every time I’m at an open mic  and perform my originals people rush to tell me I was great and should come more often, but when the depression hits so does the imposter syndrome. 

I should focus on my “real” work, but I can’t shake off the feeling, regardless of my mood, that if I truly set myself to it, I could go far."
