relationship_advice,fff8l1w,t1_ffev3sh,1579878410.0,"My main problem really is that I don't feel emotionally able to ""share"" him in any capacity. We have different views of sex, which is fine, it just seems unfair that this would be one-sided - him seeing other people ""occasionally"" and me not seeing anyone because I find it extremely hard to have any sexual attraction to someone else besides the person I love - and I fear I'll be left alone emotionally or physically, or some combination. 

We have sex once in a while. He's stopped initiating because he's insecure in his body,  saying ""I'm doughy"" and my feeble attempts make him think I've never tried in my life since I'm subtle and shy. He usually just grinds against me when we wake up, but my work schedule has changed so I'm awake well before him and it's not exactly like sexy times could happen in the middle of his REM cycle... 
I usually try to initiate by kissing his neck and being more handsy, but clearly that's not working. He literally told me to just grab his dick and make him pay attention... 
The level of nonsexual affection is pretty great, in all other aspects of our relationship, things are going very well. And generally, I'm the happiest I've ever been. It's just this one topic that throws me into a tailspin and I don't know how to either a) get over my insecurities and be ok with this, or b) explain why I'm not ok in a way that makes him understand why. I guess a third option would be to find a work around. But really, everytime I think about it, it's like a punch to the gut that I'm not good enough/less than what he wants/needs."

relationship_advice,ffeu2bv,t1_ffesxfb,1579865538.0,"Honestly, that's always been a huge fear of mine, in every relationship, ever. But no, I don't think that's the case. Especially since this has always been a thing, even well before we got together, and he's literally never had time to run around on me. I know what cheating so's do, I know what that feels like, this is nothing like that. 

That's also, not really helpful input. I'm hoping for advice, not people dragging him or my relationship through the mud."
Borderline,ffelpty,t1_ffd20kz,1579853415.0,"Well, shit. 
I'm sorry, that's the worst. It's usually my go to suggestion because it's not often done and ends up being super helpful. 
I wonder what could be going on then if it's not a genetic/chemical interaction. 

I really hope you get it figured out soon."
Borderline,ffbnguh,t3_esork6,1579774201.0,"Ask to get pharmacological genetic testing done. I had trouble with all of my meds working and finally my psych ordered one and found out that my genes were hindering the meds. Most of them I metabolize too quickly to be effective. 
The results could really narrow down what won't work and what could. 

I have both BPD and bp2, I'm on lamictal and Wellbutrin. We have to be careful with me on lamictal because I metabolize it quickly and it could result in me having too high of a tolerance for it to continue working. But so far it's fine and I've never felt more in control."

It's not a phone call, or in person? It's not like he didn't hear me and asked me to repeat myself. I don't understand.

This was all in response to me saying I wasn't comfortable with the way she acted in class and that she could probably be a little less hostile to our professor and classmates.

AskReddit,fcwp3b4,t3_eixc75,1578032238.0,"I met a guy (guy 1) on a Facebook like site that turned into a dating site. Sorta dated, but made a lot of friends through him. One night, he was hosting a friend of a friend's birthday (only person with a big enough place and chill roommates). 
There, I proceeded to get pretty smashed and saw a guy with a great arm tattoo. I get very huggy when I'm drunk, so I asked tattoo guy for a million hugs. (Guy 1 did not notice or care because we weren't actually anything). I never saw tattoo guy's face, I am short and was too drunk to look up. A few days later tattoo guy messaged me on Facebook asking to get coffee. Never did. I didn't connect his face with the guy I hugged, so I thought he was some rando. 
Few weeks later, I'm at the bar with some friends, things with guy 1 were totally over. One friend hurt my feelings and my night was unraveling fast. Tattoo guy saw me and messaged me. He rescued my shitty night and I ended up having a lot of fun. We became really good friends, 4 years later and we're engaged. 

TL;DR met a guy online, made friends with all of his friends, met my fiancé through those friends."

It's possible that he has that problem - BUT you have to have a great psychiatrist and insurance, or have tried every single drug without success to get the test done... 

His reaction is not ok. You do not have to go back to him and live in fear of it happening again. If you having an ex was enough to set him off, what little thing could cause the next episode? 
I'm all for being supportive and trying to make things work, but I don't think this is the time for that. He needs help but you also need to take care of you and your own struggles, putting his needs above yours will end up hurting you both. It might be best to walk away."
