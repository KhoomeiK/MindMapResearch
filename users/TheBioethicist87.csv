WhiskeyTribe,ff4460l,t1_ff43xna,1579555143.0,"So where Laphroaig is more iodine, and Arbeg is more smoked meat, Port Charlotte has smoke as an accent for more dark fruit and stone fruit flavors and some brine. I think it’s the most complex of the three and probably more approachable since Laphroaig and Ardbeg slap you in the face with smoke."
WhiskeyTribe,ff41jdi,t1_ff3n2zo,1579553522.0,"This my favorite scotch on earth. There’s a lot put into Laphroaig VS. Ardbeg, and I just let them go because it means Port Charlotte flies under the radar."

An ex of mine worked at a college that did this and I got suspicious when like 80% of the staff had masters degrees from the school and sure enough, a couple months later it turned out their financials were TERRIBLE (it was a business college, lol) and they shut down and had to donate their campus to offload it.

Now if that degree is on someone’s resume, I treat it more as a red flag than an asset."

Phanteks,fc5k722,t3_efydo0,1577459817.0,"I have a 9700k and a 2080 at stock speeds on air (NH-D15, which is broadly comparable to 240mmAIO) I played Anno 18 for 3.5 hours last night with graphics cranked to the tits with HWinfo in the background and the hottest my cpu got was 73, GPU was 71 mounted vertically with the cablemod mount.

You can remove the front panel pretty easily, and if I’m having long sessions in summer I tend to do that which can help with airflow."
Phanteks,fc277ga,t3_eemnvv,1577343591.0,"I have a z390 master in my Evolv x. I did notice that the fan hub wasn’t working well, but fixed that just by plugging the fans directly into the mobo/using fan splitters.

The DRGB issue wasn’t huge for me. Plugged the cable I to the mobo header and just used Gigabyte’s RGB software to configure."
Phanteks,fc271il,t3_efdphc,1577343364.0,"I use the cablemod mount in my Evolv X which has a very similar interior. I like the look of it, I like that it gives more space between the fans and the glass to allow for more airflow, and I like that it comes with special cables so I don’t have to cut the PCI-e slots out of the back.

It is annoying to trouble-shoot PC issues because it’s easier to unplug the DisplayPort cable from the monitor side that from the case side, and I end up moving the thing with a dumb ponytail/tripping hazard. I think it’s also harder to plug in to the motherboard just because you have less space to fit your hand during installation.

Summary, I like my cablemod mount, and I’d recommend it, but their are drawbacks."
