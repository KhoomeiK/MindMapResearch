-Can't wage war on your own soil as recklessly and aggresively as you can on another nations soil. You start attacking U.S neighborhoods and metro areas you risk inciting further uprisings and also destroying your own infastructure.

-The U.S economy and global economy is fucked if this ever happens.

-U.S dominates by sea and by air. The technological disparity shrinks a lot when the U.S needs boots on the ground. A drone is great and all, but if you use that and level an entire block, you might just incite mutiny in your ranks and further uprisings.

-Many people (on both sides) assume it would be as simple as Civilians vs. Government 2: Electric boogaloo. Any civil conflict has a high chance of sending divisions through the military, politicians, police forces and most importantly, the populace itself.

>ISIL would be a serious threat,


ISIL was a huge fucking threat to the middle east. It took a coalition of nations and US backed allies to push them back. Even non-military allies like Russia were enganged with them. Were they ever a threat to the U.S homeland? Not likely, we have a sea seperating us.

Overall, it's a massive net benefit for everyone in lower income brackets, as even those who don't see a significant increase in income still benefit from the removal of means testing and spending restrictions, and more money is able to get to people who need it because of the reduction of the expensive and often ineffectual bureaucracy needed for those programs as people opt out of them.

Source it stacks for housing? I couldn't find that in his FAQ section.

> IMO we should be trying to move to a system that is universal and unconditional, and offering a better alternative is the most effective and humane way of doing that.

Agreed.

>This is true, although it's true of any policy that gives more spending power to people in lower income brackets, including a minimum wage increase. It's a legitimate concern, and I agree it should be tailored with some kind of rent control, but the argument that we shouldn't help the poor because some of the money would trickle up doesn't seem to be in their best interest.

I'm not worried about some of the money trickling up, i would legitimately not be surprised if the vast majority of that money trickles up and since some benefits are being compromised on when accepting UBI, i worry the poor may be left worse off or stagnant while the rich who qualify for Ubi get richer (albeit very slowly)

> Long term, automation will continue to bring prices down 

For average goods yes, the items that require the majority of the average Americans' paycheck are not affected by it. 

>and meanwhile the total amount of money in the economy remains the same, so hyperinflation is unlikely.

I'm not an econ major nor am i well versed in economic theory, but what i do question is how the average American will have much more disposable income and why the market won't adjust to this change in buying power? You yourself say that when lower-income brackets have increased income (such as minimum wage increases) the market adjusts to this with higher rents, higher property values (locking out buyers from the housing market) even average goods can cost significantly more. Why does the fact that this money already exists in the economy matter? The money is still increasing buying power so why wouldn't the market not adjust to that if given the chance? Why would businesses not seek potentially higher profits?

The concept, in general, is an incredibly important one. With the rise of technologies relating to automation, we face some very real challenges with what to do when these technologies begin putting people out of work faster than we can move them into new industries. 

Universal basic income allows for these people to live *decent* life instead of being put out onto the streets which causes a host of problems. Yang's proposal alone is a stepping stone (a flawed one imo) to a potential eventuality where a significant amount of work is being automated away. 

>Not only will it decrease the value of the dollar

First, how?

Secondly, any automation technologies would not be soley unqiue to America. In time those changes would spread globally. The value of the dollar will either adjust to a new world standard or we will measure GDP and other economic values in a new way (which Yang proposes).

Please tell me how i have done this? Do you know something about me that i don't?

This doesn't answer anything in my question. You can't hold the belief that Trump is a dangerous authoritarian with insane supporters who may not honor a peaceful transition of power and also in the same breath say we should willingly disarm oursevles to the GOP. That's cowardice and hypocritical.

>Not OP, but I personally don't buy the idea that having guns is an actual check in the real world against an encroaching tyrannical government. It was in 1776, but not in 2020. The technological disparity between ordinary people and the military has gotten waaaaaaaaay too big. You can't fight drones equipped with missiles with an AR-15, no matter how much ammo you stockpile.

Ok so here were my points

-Can't wage war on your own soil as recklessly and aggresively as you can on another nations soil. You start attacking U.S neighborhoods and metro areas you risk inciting further uprisings and also destroying your own infastructure.

-The U.S economy and global economy is fucked if this ever happens.

-U.S dominates by sea and by air. The technological disparity shrinks a lot when the U.S needs boots on the ground. A drone is great and all, but if you use that and level an entire block, you might just incite mutiny in your ranks and further uprisings.

-Many people (on both sides)  assume it would be as simple as Civilians vs. Government 2: Electric boogaloo. Any civil conflict has a high chance of sending divisions through the military, politicians, police forces and most importantly, the populace itself. 

Which is why these things are almost always civil wars.


>There's also the fact that most of the guys stockpiling shit tons of guns are also by and large coincident with the people who actively cheer on government tyranny, as long as it's directed at people they don't like.

This is a good point and why i actively encourage liberals not to let gun ownership be a partisan issue.

>Bottom line for me is that I don't believe the second amendment is giving us any sort of realistic path to salvation from any sort of tyranny. 

The best method to prevent tyranny is voting, but come a time where voting fails or the vote isn't honored, i don't see why Americans should allow themselves to be helpless. Also this is just one of many reasons to support 2A."

So you live in the most expensive city in the U.S and you have a fucking amazing healthcare plan by the sound of if (seriously, you don't get any money taken out for health care?)

Between what sounds like god-tier health insurance and you saying fellow engineers it sounds like you are in a prosperous job field as well.

First thing to do: Recognize you have options most American's don't. 

You don't need to live in the bay Area and given that you sound like you're in a good paying industry you could easily relocate to a lower CoL state with a good salary.

Now it's not fair to expect people to move (most of the time) but it sounds like you have a high upward potential which many don't and have very unique benefits.

This is a completely sane move. Gun manufacturers are no more responsible for how the product is used than alcohol companies are for DUI incidents that kill people.

> Or the time he voted to ship Vermont's nuclear waste to a poor community in TX? 

Damn, old ass attack point. So this is a very nuanced situation and a primary reason why Sanders is against nuclear plants as dealing with the waste was/can be a bitch.

Secondly, Sierra Blanca is sparsely populated and geographically one of the few places to dump nuclear waste. It was one of the few sites being considered (since you can't just dump waste anywhere).

Thirdly, i could be wrong here and ill try and find the actual bill but i'm not sure 
Sierra Blanca was specifically mentioned. I know in the end the deciding factor came down to a seperate agency and this was not the site it ended up at.

I encourage you to read Sanders words on this issue.

>Or how about the 501c4 he set up that's using dark money to campaign for him? 


The only major donation was traced back to a teachers union wasn't it? Do we also have proof this went directly to the Sanders campaign. Curious on this because it was just brought up recently.

The Afghan war was way different than Iraq. If any war was justified it was the one that resulted directly from us being attacked.
