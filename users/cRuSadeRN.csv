RATS,ff92uc6,t3_esbizg,1579703478.0,"I didn’t have to make a whole cage bottom, but my cage shelves were all wire as well. I cut thick cardboard to size and wrapped fleece over the shelf and fastened it. That way when I clean the cage once a week I can replace the fleece as well. Maybe you can do something similar. The pee really doesn’t soak through the fleece into the cardboard because rats only sprinkle here and there, but if I see a visibly soiled area of the cardboard I replace the whole piece. Hope I helped!"
RATS,ff8gj63,t3_es6yo0,1579677475.0,"Keep them in a room where you can close the door and exclude all your other pets. Go buy 4 or 5 tri-fold poster boards and tape them together to form walls that you can circle together to form a play pen. Once a day, take the rats out and let them roam around in the play pen, and sit in there with them. Watch tv, play on your computer, whatever your regular activities are. They need to know that you are safe and no matter what noises you make you won’t hurt them. And TREATS! Lots of treat bribes. My ratties love meat baby food, they always come up to me looking for it, even if I don’t have any. Now they run all over me and hide in my lap no matter my movements and noises. Your rats will get there, it just takes time and patience. It took my rats about a month to even stop running away from me with every sound."

ShittyLifeProTips,ff5z9zk,t1_ff5n7sx,1579614983.0,"Walmart tries their damndest to keep as many workers under 40hr/wk as possible to avoid paying for full time employee benefits. If he clocked in and worked more hours than he should have, it would have cost the company more money than they wanted to pay, so now they had to fire “the troublemaker” over a couple bucks. Walmart sucks."

Not only do they deserve it, but from the producers side it would save so much money to only record and release rather than auto tune and edit first - straight profit means more money."
RATS,ff38ws1,t3_ercqvn,1579536463.0,"I don’t think it’s as simple as that, it really comes down to personality and age as well. I got boys for the cuddly stereotype, and as they are still pretty young they are still very active and curious! I’ve seen that as rats get older and tired they start to become cuddly despite being very active in youth. The best way to pick out cuddly rats is to spend some time with the breeder and get to know the rats before you take them home, or just ask the breeder to pick the most chill one for you. I didn’t have that option since we only have pet stores nearby. Good luck!"

RATS,fenhd4e,t3_eq3g8e,1579284714.0,"Rats are very clean. They are very prone to certain illnesses and cancers, but that is not due to being dirty. VERY RARELY are there cases of an illness being transmitted from pet rats to humans, but those cases are transmitted by bodily fluids and typically localized to certain pet stores. So make sure to wash your hands after touching their urine and poops and after cleaning their cage, but that is just expected hand hygiene as with any pet. Don’t worry! Rats get bad press. They are not the greasy, disease ridden little rodents that comes to everyone’s mind. Pet rats are actually very hygienic, loving, playful pets. The only thing is they have a lot of energy until they become older, so don’t be disappointed if they don’t want to sit still to cuddle at first."

facepalm,fek1p1x,t1_feivegn,1579190719.0,"When I was in middle school they went through a phase of banning every brand name clothing, lunch box, clothing patterns, etc. for being “gang related.” For example, living in a country town, everyone was pretty pissed that we could no longer wear Carhartt jackets because they were now “gang related” despite it being cold AF during winter time. And no striped, plaid, or patterned shirts of any kind either. Solid print only. Would be a real shame if the “flower print shirts” gang was able to wear their colors in public. SMH"

RATS,feg4ma4,t3_eoz5z1,1579076687.0,"I wanted boys for the cuddly generalization. But so far it is not true, they are very energetic at times and love to explore. They have their own personalities of course, and one is even more curious than the other. I think cuddling and laziness comes with age, as they get old they will slow down. And as for the scent marking, yeah they have a smell like any caged animal does, but I don’t find it overpowering. Both genders of rats are prone to their own significant health problems, so really picking one over the other won’t matter in the long run. For me it came down to what gender the seller had on hand, and so I got the only two boys left. Hope I helped!"

I’m not sure how that compares to rattery adoptions, but mine turned out fine and love attention and treats. I know everyone hates pet stores because of all the negative connotations, but where I am from we don’t have any other source for hundreds of miles. Just when you go in make sure they don’t crowd more than a couple (same sex) to each small cage, and check to make sure they are active and have clear eyes. See if you can find any indication at all that they might be unhealthy before you buy. If they are healthy and you have the patience to bond to any prey animal, then petsmart will be fine."
