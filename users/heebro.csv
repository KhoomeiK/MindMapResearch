politics,fe0yqzp,t1_fdzkal5,1578820445.0,"It all started with Nixon.  Eisenhower was the last decent Republican.  Like Trump, Nixon colluded with a foreign power during an election year.  Nixon's sabotage of the Paris peace talks in 1968 was tantamount to treason.  During his presidency he faced growing pressure from antiwar activists, civil rights leaders, and the press.  After Nixon resigned, Republicans got to work quickly to set up Fox News to spread right-wing propaganda and fear to counteract the effects of solid journalism.  ""The Party of Small Government"" literally started a war on its own people—the War on Drugs dealt the black population repeated blows, and today we have the police murdering dark-skinned people on a near weekly basis.  That's what Republicans mean when they say law & order—the gov't taking the place of the lynch mob.  The fear of this police state serves another purpose:  2nd Amendment defenders who claim they need assault rifles to defend against an authoritarian military state, then turn around and authorize printing trillions of dollars (again—it was Nixon who took us off the gold standard to pay for Vietnam) for the military, wrecking our economy in the process with outrageous wealth inequality."

Vietnam) to tank the Paris summit that would have ended the Vietnam War.  Nixon promised S. Vietnam they would get a better peace settlement after he got elected (keeping in mind Nixon had no authority to direct foreign policy when he made this promise).  The DNC had most of this information on tapes because the FBI had the Vietnamese under surveillance.  Nixon caught wind of this fact and ordered the break in at Watergate to find out what they had on him.  After Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal, he and his cronies connived to start a 'news' agency to spread Republican propaganda.  And so Nixon can be blamed at least indirectly for the mess we find ourselves in today."
Catswhoyell,fdfwozl,t3_el4i1j,1578372261.0,"It comes as no surprise, really.

So they don't naturally operate on an eating schedule that would resemble our breakfast, lunch, & dinner routine.
