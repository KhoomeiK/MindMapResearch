funny,ffefq3x,t3_et1dr3,1579846266.0,I'm having a tough time wrapping my head around this. What the Hell did I just witness? Some sort of perverted Romper Room? Where was this broadcast?
ARK,ffbajl3,t3_esm47e,1579757512.0,"That's really neat, I have no idea how to ""bridge"" a structure. I've tried numerous times to bridge structures across water and could never get foundations to anchor reliably on the other side. Best I could do is pillars and floors but the pillars poking through the floors drives me nuts."
funny,fe6gj7q,t1_fe5zf2m,1578890218.0,"California too. The, ""hooky,"" came from cutting school during a snow storm. The,""bobbing,"" came from the sled. That shit was the absolute bomb.

One summer, I came across a water ski rope and handle by the side of the road. Probably fell off one of the numerous lake boats. I kept that thing for a handful of years and attached the rope to snowmobiles, dirt bikes, trucks, you name it. Best time was when a bunch of us were stuck on a ski trip during a snow storm and had the roads to ourselves. We raced around on snowmobiles, quads, skis and snowboards for hours that night. We'd race the snowmobile on the road and the person behind would use the momentum to launch themselves off the berm on the side of the road and down the hill. We stopped only because we ran out of fuel. :)

I gave the rope to a younger friend just before leaving for college."
Jokes,fdll1i6,t1_fdk9725,1578526419.0,I'd like to know too. It's like having this horrible little secret that I have to hide. I hear co-workers talk about poop knives and I just feign ignorance.
todayilearned,fdi77ae,t1_fdhpz4w,1578436953.0,"We might have worked at the same place at one time (doubtful). There was a group of about 8 or so that worked in a seperated area of the warehouse. They used to put things in boxes, they were packed up, then sent out to wherever. We were never allowed into their work space and they were never allowed in ours. Understandable due to the potential dangers.

I still snuck over to their area once just to peek. Each station was customized to their specific needs. Some were even painted in bright colors, presumably as some sort of mnemonic for sorting purposes. All had their names on hand made cards. One space was obviously for a wheel chair set up the way you describe.

The group had a name too. I think it was a subcontractor that managed them but I can't remember what it is now. It was something like Courage or Integrity or something like that."
todayilearned,fdgp9aa,t1_fdgdz9d,1578404671.0,"My understanding was they got permission from the publisher but not the manager (who I understand was a dick). Basically, The Verve failed to cover their bases. 

But if a group/singer covers all their bases, don't they get *some* royalties? At least for singing the song? For example, Anaconda by Nicki Manaj has a handful of credited song writers, including Anthony Ray (Sir Mix-a-Lot), and no licensing controversy AFAIK. She theoretically gets jack from that song?"

A moronic acquaintance has his *nipple* pierced. Not his ear, his goddamn nipple. Then it got infected and then the stupid barbell did the same thing as yours. Partbof it got sucked into his nopple and he couldn't get it out.

We had a mutual friend and the mutual friend told him I kept a full first aid kit, replete with scapel, in my vehicle. So he comes up to me in class and wants me to remove the damn thing. 

I won't bother getting into the conversation we had about it but myself, mutual friend, and one other drive over to his house and ""surgically"" removed the thing from his tit. 

I never spoke with any of them since."

todayilearned,fdfysxr,t3_el1lc8,1578374057.0,"Hypotethically, if Parton signed the Elvis contract losing half her *publishing* rights does that mean she would only have 50% say in how that song is published, who does the covers in future recordings, etc?

I remember working at Taco Bell around that time and trying to see how much carbon dioxide we could pump into the cat toy before it exploded. FYI: we never got it to explode but it does do a bit of damage as it flies around the back room."
aww,fcnlxuf,t1_fcn3vml,1577814017.0,"Dogs, and cats, can be trained to enjoy similar processes. I had an outdoor white cat that required a medicated pink (sometimes red, sometimes blue) topical cream. She absolutely loved it because it equated to attention I guess. Sadly she passed away for unrelated reasons.

AFAIK, dying hair isn't a painful process so the concern by many people are the chemicals used might be toxic to animals. The same reason you can't apply most human sun screens to animals because what's safe for humans can prove fatal to your four legged friend.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of it since my pets and  I have better things to do with my time and money."
personalfinance,fci320z,t1_fci22sv,1577657160.0,"This is exactly why they do this. Most credit card companies forbid charging more on merchandise for credit transactions. However none forbid discounts for cash for that merchandise. 

By the same token, I suspect merchants that charge a convenience fee to use plastic may be violating some part of the agreement as well but I don't really want to wade through the bazillion pages of contract nonsense to figure it out."

Dev: Uh... it says here boss... Island.

Boss: Hmmm... how interesting. Alright, we can't ban Islands so what's number two?

Dev: uh... Forest.

Boss: .... OK, let me guess. The next three cards are Mountain, Swamp, and Plains?

Dev: Well.... Plains didn't make the list.

In all seriousness, I would also like to see WotC implement some kind of voting system on top cards. At least in Arena anyways. I think WotC might be surprised of how some of the cards they designed are ranked."

todayilearned,fc9r0zf,t1_fc9qijt,1577556904.0,I figured there is some place in the world that uses shapes. The whole color blindness isn't a rare occurence. If you don't mind my asking where so they do the shaped lights?
todayilearned,fc928jd,t1_fc8sbe3,1577545850.0,"Personally, I was thinking of the red light physically larger. This is a practice already done for certain intersections. Or... put two red lights side by side. Another practice already done for some intersections.

Yellow remains as-is....

That leaves green. My vote would be to make it square."
todayilearned,fc8mrh8,t1_fc8hixb,1577538106.0,"Yeah,  it's a consistent problem. There was a deadly accident a few months back and it's thought the driver was color blind and couldn't distinguish the lights. If I understand it right, he couldn't see the red. 

The traffic lights (in the U.S. anyways) are always positioned with red at top, green at bottom. If it's horizontal, IIRC, it would be left or right depending on which side of the road is driven. There only exception in the U.S. I'm aware of is Tiperary Hill in Syracuse, New York. The Irish there somehow equate red=British and red being at top means they're better than Irish. Something I'm purportedly told that neither Great Britian nor Ireland have ever considered with their traffic lights. The damn thing is so moronic that there is actually signage proceeding the intersection explaining that the traffic light is upside down. But regardless of their positioning, it doesn't really help.

Said traffic lights aren't pure red or green anyways. There's supposed to be a tiny amount of blue in the green. Some countries like Japan started with blue and added a tiny amount of green later on. So there are variations. But there are variations amongst the lights even on the same street due to a number of factors. Things like cleanliness, condition of the bulb or diodes, etc.

I think the ski resorts have the right idea with the shapes for their ski slopes."

LifeProTips,fc5rbeg,t1_fc55asa,1577464208.0,"My understanding was that the companies have argued that ISP and Television are not necessities (in other words, utilities) and are exempt for federal regulation including those that deal with non-compete contracts. The smell of poop is so strong on that that public bathrooms downtown smell better. 

I'm quite surprised there aren't more regulation governing ISP since there are a growing number of business that will *not* take job applications via anything other than their corporate website. Hell, Public interfaces have become so entwined with the need for network access. The most effective way to search for, and apply for, many government jobs is on the internet.

When people in the U.S. was forced to switch to digital TV, comcast gave out *free* digital->analog cable boxes. They assured everyone that these specific boxes given out in the short window during the changeover would be free as long that consumer remained with Comcast/Xfinity without a break in service. A year (or two?) later a _service_ charge of $12 per ""free"" box appeared. A call to Comcast yields the excuse that the fee isn't a rental fee for the box itself but for the services to maintain (?!) said box. This fee appeared suddenly in the middle of the year, June or July IIRC and we didn't catch on for a couple of months until my spouse compared it to a bill from the beginning of the year. 

Point being, if you check only in December, then pops is out 5 or 6 months worth of cash."

Six Flags now also takes photographs of those with season passes at the gate. Previously it was finger print scans. When I asked about it, they stated it was to deter fraud with people who loan their season passes to others. Bollocks, that's what the finger print scan was supposed to solve.
