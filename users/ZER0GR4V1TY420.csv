The government is NOT coming to get you, that's a normal schizophrenic delusion. Are you taking medication? You might want to take the meds, I think you might would feel better and realize that you are OK."
SuicideWatch,feltmjh,t1_fellxi3,1579230633.0,"Dude you are worrying too much about all this. It's OK. You were just a kid even after reading that full story. That's not kid abuse or sexual abuse or anything. As kids, we do stuff that we don't fully understand. You didn't know any better, don't worry about it. Don't think about it too much. It was in the past. We have all done weird shit like that when we were kids that now looking back makes us a bit uncomfortable. You were just a confused kid like we all were.

Maybe it would help if you talked through it all with your therapist. But honestly we all have weird moments like this from our childhood, I would bet that every single person has a moment like this that makes them cringe. So don't worry about it!"
SuicideWatch,felj4oj,t1_feleuod,1579223417.0,"I don't think that dude would share anything, that would be fucked up. Although maybe it the future if you video stuff it might be smart not to include your face, just so you never have to worry about anything.

I would honestly just try to move on from the other stuff. Don't think too much about it all because it in your head you're just thinking about how shameful and embarrassing it all is - then it's going to bring you down and stress you out. Just admit to yourself that it's not a big deal and move past it / try to stop thinking about it.

To me, I just wouldn't worry about it at all. I think you're good man!"
SuicideWatch,feldljv,t1_felcymz,1579219684.0,"Well I wouldn't worry about that at all man, you were just a kid. Kids do weird, kinda fucked up things because they just don't really know any better. I've done some cringey things as a kid myself that I think about sometimes. Basically the same kind of stuff you're talking about. I think everyone has those moments where they think back on it when they are older and can understand it and cringe. It seems inappropriate to you now that you can look back on it, but back then you probably didn't even really understand what you were doing and that it was weird. He probably didn't understand it either, so I wouldn't worry about it. Plus it was just wedgies, kids give each other those all the time just playing around."
SuicideWatch,feld8if,t1_felcxe5,1579219441.0,"Yeah I feel you on the family lecture, haha. But maybe it would be for the best to tell them how you are feeling and what you're going through. Even if it does result in a lecture. :P Maybe they can help, at the end of the day family can suck sometimes but they can also be all you got sometimes"
SuicideWatch,feld21l,t1_felcrew,1579219322.0,"Dude yeah old people don't get it at all. Their lives were so different they just can't even relate. They were like sitting by the fire listening to the freakin' radio and thought that was the good ol' days. Haha.

Even my parents sound kind of like your grandmother. Always making me feel horrible about shit and stressing me out. Family...can't live with them, can't live without them.

Maybe just try to ignore them and keep doing your thing. You know best, not them."
SuicideWatch,felcupy,t1_felcq3f,1579219186.0,Well then you should probably start taking them again. Have you talked to someone you're close to about it? Like your family or a friend?

SuicideWatch,felckv5,t1_felc5ff,1579219004.0,"Do you need the meds? If so, then maybe you should start taking them again. If you don't maybe try to go for a few weeks and see how you feel without them? You will know your body better than anyone else."
SuicideWatch,felcgun,t3_eprv8g,1579218929.0,"Are you a guy or girl? Honestly, this isn't bad at all. Don't even worry about. You know some people have some really fucked up fetishes, right? Your fetish is totally not even weird. Maybe I don't know the full story, but it sounds like a pretty normal fetish. I'm sure you will find someone to explore your sexuality and fetishes with who likes you for you.

Now about your family, yeah I wouldn't tell them. I don't think someone's family ever wants to know or should know about what fetishes they like. I think you can keep that between you and your SO. :)"
SuicideWatch,felc3j2,t3_eprvyv,1579218687.0,"What meds? You're really young mate, don't worry too much about stuff - you will figure it out. You've got soooo much time. You could literally fuck around for the next 10 years and still have a lot of time to figure your life out. We all go through periods of life that suck and it can be really hard. Don't be too hard on yourself."
SuicideWatch,felbuxj,t1_felanuf,1579218529.0,"Yeah I struggle with feelings like that too. I think it's important to try to live the  IDGAF attitude and not let people affect you too much. You're not inadequate, you just feel that way because we are always our own worst enemy / critic. Try not to be so hard on yourself. The majority of the time, people probably aren't even judging you at all. What helps me sometimes with social anxiety is thinking about it the reversed way. If you saw someone make a mistake in class and they were shaking, would you think they are pathetic and make fun of them? Probably not, you would probably wish them the best and tell them something encouraging. The chances are people are feeling that same way towards you and not judging you at all!"
SuicideWatch,felbjaf,t1_felaakm,1579218317.0,"How old are you now? Honestly I'm pretty alone too so I don't know if I can really give you any help on that front. I really only have 1 good friend, but it helps to spend time with him and talk to him when I'm feeling down.

I've gone through periods of my life where I was really really depressed and I still have a lot of social anxiety, but I also go through periods where I feel a lot better. Whenever I feel depressed, it's a sign to me that I need to do something different. Maybe try new things, try do exercise more, go for a walk / run, break your patterns of behavior. It might help you feel a little better"
SuicideWatch,felb7gj,t3_eprkvs,1579218097.0,"Yeah I feel you man, I'm getting old too and I've failed a lot. One thing I've learned about failure is that it only really counts as a failure when you give up. If you try to do something and you fail, try to get back up and just keep going. That's how you can be successful, if you never give up and just keep plowing ahead - you can't lose. But it does take time and it's really difficult."
SuicideWatch,felau92,t3_eprnee,1579217857.0,"I know you probably don't want to hear this right now, but it actually might be a blessing in disguise for you. Obviously she wasn't the right one for you, now you're single and you can start finding someone better for you. You're young at 22, that's around when I had my first girlfriend and lost my virginity so I wouldn't worry too much. 

The truth is it never works out with the first person you kiss / love. I think you always remember them and have a special little place for them in your mind, but your first love never lasts. You'll probably go through this at least a few more times until you find someone really great. You won't die a lonely, unloved, virgin so don't worry about that."
SuicideWatch,felajvm,t1_fel9lij,1579217670.0,"Yeah I feel you, it's always easy to go down that path and take it out on yourself. It's hard to do the opposite. What helps me sometimes is coming up with little mantras that I can repeat to myself. Like ""I can only do my best"" stuff like that. Maybe you could come up with your own mantra that comforts you and helps you feel better about yourself."
SuicideWatch,feladrt,t1_fel96r1,1579217561.0,Are you in the US now? That would be sweet to live in the UK. I don't know if it's possible or not for you but some of my friends did a study abroad semester or year. You could go study abroad somewhere in the UK for a bit. I wasn't able to do anything cool like that but I wish. :P
SuicideWatch,fela7sp,t3_epr2ti,1579217455.0,"Well you can't control other people, if they want to be shitty, they are going to be shitty. :/

Maybe you should try to start with yourself, don't let shitty people make you angry because that's only hurting yourself. Try not to let them get to you. The good news is that you are only 17, it can be a fucked up time but it will pass and you will go through a bunch of life changes. Really your life hasn't even started yet, you're still in the stage where you can't really control a lot."
SuicideWatch,fel9wtm,t3_epr335,1579217261.0,"> but I don't remember eating a piece of shit. 

Lol, you seem like a funny person. I wouldn't worry to much about shitty people. There are a lot of them in the world and it sounds like you might have found some of them. 

Not sure if I really have any good answers for you, but try not to worry too much. It sounds like you are pretty young? As you go through school, you will find lots of new friends and lose friends you thought you wouldn't. That's just kind of life. :P"
SuicideWatch,fel9npa,t3_epr45w,1579217099.0,What's going on? What did you think over and what brought you to this point?
SuicideWatch,fel9i1e,t3_epr4uz,1579216997.0,"It sounds like you are a good person and maybe other people's shittiness have got you down. Not a lot you can do there really, there are a lot of shitty people in the world. But not everyone, there are also a lot of super nice, kind people. You just have to try to find them.

I'm sure you aren't useless, even if it might feel that way. Maybe you just haven't found your purpose yet? How old are you? You're not expected to have everything figured out, it might take some people their whole life to figure out their purpose."
SuicideWatch,fel96um,t3_epr8s5,1579216798.0,"Have you told someone close to you what you've been feeling / thinking? I don't know anything about you but it sounds like you might have some issues that you need to tell someone about or see a doctor about. You shouldn't be hearing voices, if you are that might be a sign that you need meds or something and who knows, that could fix all your problems.

The government probably isn't coming to get you, that sounds like a delusion. I'm sure you are going to be OK."
SuicideWatch,fel909y,t3_eprdzf,1579216681.0,"Damn all that sounds terrible and painful. I'm pretty sure you do not want to take animal poison, that would be fucked and a shitty way to die. 

Climbing the cellphone tower sounds pretty fun, jumping off not so much.

I hope you feel better this weekend, maybe try to distract yourself from all these thoughts by trying something new?"
SuicideWatch,fel8u1u,t3_epredq,1579216569.0,"I feel you, it can suck to be feeling good and then get back into depression. There isn't really a great answer for that though, sometimes life is going well and sometimes life is going to suck. I feel like I go through periods of feeling normal, and then I can start to feel really depressed. I've had some short period of my life where I felt really happy, but that never seems to last forever. I think that's kind of just how it goes. 

Keep working on yourself and becoming more confident. It sounds like you've been doing a good job. Keep doing what was working before. I'm sure you are improving, but everyone has bad days / weeks / months. You just have to try to keep moving forward. Try not to be too hard on yourself."
SuicideWatch,fel8gar,t1_fel4s6m,1579216325.0,"Yeah well it might not be the best idea to try to date a coworker anyways. But if you want my thoughts on it, it's just about getting to know them, making jokes, and being their friend first. If you spend time with someone, and make them laugh, and become work friends, you might have a good shot at taking it beyond just the workplace. I don't really have a good answer for that though because it's something that I never was really any good at either. Although if you drop subtle hints and they are interested too, it might just happen without you having to do that much."
SuicideWatch,fel82ft,t1_fel5ksy,1579216082.0,"Wow your father seems crazy! What's his problem? Maybe some of the other subreddits could help, I think there are a few for people with crazy parents.

That does seem like a tough situation and it's not as easy as just moving out. The good news is that it won't last forever, right? Eventually you will be able to move out and you'll be free of your father's crazy. Maybe you should try to start planning towards that, so when you get the chance you're prepared to move out."
SuicideWatch,fekzsdo,t1_feks2le,1579211013.0,"Yeah I can feel that, it sucks the most when it's someone that you think is similar to you yet they are doing so much better. Just try not to compare yourself like that too much, I feel shitty when I do that - I think everyone does.

I would say try to treat it the same as Bill Gates. Everyone is on different paths / timelines. Also you never know how that person really feels, they could seem really successful but actually be falling apart. You don't see the negative parts they keep hidden, you only see the surface level where it seems like they are doing so well. It's like Instagram vs. Reality, if you're always comparing yourself vs. Instagram - it's going to feel really shitty.

Try to pace yourself vs. yourself. If you want to get more cute receptionist's numbers, make that your goal and try to work towards it. Try to approach someone cute, try to talk to them, etc. Start small. And instead of tracking your progress vs. someone who is already seemingly successful at what you're trying to do, track your progress against yourself. Their success might be sleeping with someone, your success might just be taking the first step and chatting them up. If you focus on yourself and keep yourself progressing, you will be at the ""successful"" person's level before you know it! If you keep at it, you will pass them."
SuicideWatch,fejy0mb,t1_fej5dhk,1579188431.0,"It's never too late man. My best friend was actually in kind of a similar spot. He started drinking a lot in college and then it just continued and got worse and worse. Until he was dependent on it, like he literally couldn't stop or he would get seizures and could die. He went through some fucked up shit because of it all and when he quit, he did have a seizure and he lost his sense of smell and taste. Not a great story I know but maybe it could be a warning to you. Learn from his mistakes. You can / should try to stop drinking. My friend actually went to detox / rehab and it seemed like it helped him. He said the other people there seemed really cool and they helped him too.

Also I'm old now at 27. 23 might feel old, but it's still so young. You're barely over 21. You literally have all the time in the world to figure it out, so don't worry too much. Maybe you should start to write again? Practice makes perfect. Hard work beats talent. Try writing in a journal or something more, I've heard that helps."
SuicideWatch,fejxhe8,t1_fej7ogn,1579188091.0,"Well I've got good news for you friend, 18 is freaking super young. And I'll let you in on a secret, NO ONE YOUR AGE HAS EXPERIENCE. Everyone is faking it until they make it. Don't worry about not being a good kisser or not being good at flirting. You'll get better as your life goes on and you meet people you want to kiss / flirt with and who want to kiss / flirt with you too.

I know it can feel like everyone is good at all that stuff and it can be stressful feeling like you're being left behind or less experienced than your friends / peers. I felt like that too, everyone does. You've still got so much time. Tons of people 18 - 25 are still virgins with very little experience. You'll find someone that probably has the same level of experience as you. I know I did when I was like 21 and my girlfriend and I were both virgins. So don't worry too much about it and it will all happen naturally for you. Just trust in yourself that you'll figure it out and be smooth when it all happens. :)"
SuicideWatch,fejx04c,t1_fej9ld9,1579187782.0,"Well when you find yourself comparing yourself to others, try to stop yourself and remind yourself that's is unhealthy. Because really there will ALWAYS be someone better off than you, with more money, and a seemingly much better life, who seems really happy. You're never going to be the king of the world. BUT you can be the king of YOUR world. 

If you're starving and someone had plenty of food, I guess that would be hard to ignore. But it's not going to be productive thinking about that. Instead try to think about ""how can I get more food"". Try to be happy for them as well instead of thinking about it like they have something that you don't. It's great that they have food and it will be great when you have food too!

It's not easy though, I find myself comparing myself to other people often as well. But just try to catch yourself doing it and remind yourself that it's not productive / helpful. It's better to focus on yourself and track your progress against yourself not other people."
SuicideWatch,fej500b,t1_fej4be2,1579157133.0,"That seems fair to have things be even.

I would try not to browse reddit though at a party, I know we are on reddit right now (:P) but it's not going to help you in that situation.

Also having thoughts like that driving your car isn't that crazy. I actually have a lot of thoughts like that but they are more like ""intrusive thoughts"" than actual plans for me.

Also try not to compare yourself to other people too much, it doesn't help. Try to compare yourself to yourself! It's a much more helpful and less stressful way.

Everyone was unemployed at some point. I had a period where I was unemployed for a loooong time and I felt really shitty about it. I was really hard on myself and got pretty depressed. Although it was kind of like ""the night is darkest right before the dawn"" because when I did get a job it was a freaking awesome job that I had been really wanting. It can feel hopeless applying to jobs, but I would say just keep at it. I applied over and over and got nothing for a long time and I got rejected a few times after interviewing, then all of a sudden I got 1 kinda shitty job offer and then the same week I got the job offer I really wanted.

It's easy to get stuck in patterns of behavior, it helps me to break out of my routine and try to do different things / try new things."
SuicideWatch,feiz45q,t3_epef0h,1579151319.0,"That's tough, I can relate to the numb feelings. It sounds like you have had some awesome times and now you're going through hard times. My own life seems to go through peaks and valleys. Sometimes I feel great, sometimes I feel like shit. Money comes and goes, I wouldn't worry too much about that. 

I always know that I'm feeling depressed when I get the feeling of wanting to cry without actually being able to cry. 

It sounds like you have been strong and successful in the past, if you could do it then, you can do it again. Try not to be too hard on yourself, in life we can only do our best - sometimes our best might not be that great. But shit, that's life. Peaks and valleys."
SuicideWatch,feiys1c,t3_epehs8,1579151026.0,"Wow that must be hard. Do you want to transition? 

You have a right to feel however you're feeling. I don't think it's really something we can control. It's more of a product of our lives at any given time.

Congrats on graduating that's awesome. Although the real world can definitely be stressful, I miss my time in college. For me, life got better but also harder. 

Maybe you should try to do something like CBT / Cognitive Behavior Therapy for your panic attacks. Or just try meditation or yoga / exercise. That's always helped me relax."
SuicideWatch,feiygmd,t3_epeihh,1579150749.0,"That's tough, I think one of the only things you can really do is try to listen to her and understand her feelings. I know when I feel depressed, I also feel ""stuck"" in my patterns of behavior. Although she says she just wants to relax, watch a movie, and eat her fav foods - it might be a sign of depression. What actually helps me is NOT doing stuff like that and breaking my patterns, going to try new things, doing things differently, etc. Maybe try to surprise her with something that will make her smile. Maybe try to go on more walks together. Or play a new board game or something. 

Good luck and I hope she feels better. It's a lot for you to take on alone so hopefully she is also being honest with her therapist and working through it with them as well."

SuicideWatch,feixiea,t3_epcv61,1579149947.0,"That's tough man, I can relate to the feeling of just sleeping / browsing the internet / working again. I've been trying to find more hobbies and trying to do more things that I enjoy. Although I'm not really sure what I want to do. 

One thing that I struggle with too is comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone who seems like they have it all and are doing so much better. I always get down on myself when I compare myself to other people. One thing that helps me feel better though is comparing myself against myself. Sort of like the ghost racer in Mario Kart N64 if you know what I mean. When you compare yourself vs. yourself, it's feels a lot better and it helps me make progress."

StopSpeeding,feintow,t3_ep8p47,1579142879.0,"I've been there man, the best thing you can do is stop taking that shit. I don't want to think about how fucked my brain was when I was abusing it like that. If you have some type of narcolepsy, take Modafinil. You don't need it but your body / brain is likely very addicted to it at this point. I stopped taking it 7 months ago and it hasn't been easy, I definitely miss taking it and gaming hard AF, but it's worth it in the end. Time goes by a lot slower now and I can actually remember shit again."
StopSpeeding,fein8mw,t3_ep3ijx,1579142490.0,"Hey man, I'm in a similar place around 7 months. All I can say is we need to stay strong and keep on truckin'. ADHD meds also gave me crazy anxiety, I feel a lot better without them. I have a lot more time and it doesn't feel like my life / time is flashing before my eyes anymore. Although I know what you mean when you say it's a lot harder to work a desk job and focus for hours and hours on a computer. There are other ways to help you focus that aren't amphs. When I listen to music and get into a groove I can be very productive. Try to limit your distractions, that helps me.

You don't need to meds to succeed. If anything the meds will just make it harder for you. The more ADHD meds you take, the more symptoms you will have. Taking meds will also make it more difficult for you to focus naturally.

Yeah if everyone abused amphs we would all be super productive but no one is supposed to be able to sit at a computer and work for 24 hours straight. It's difficult to find focus and motivation the natural way, but it's worth it in the end. Exercise (running) and meditation help.

Good luck :)"

I thought I had seen stupid posts in here, but this one takes the 🍰. You're telling people to get to work, sure that's OK. Then you're telling people not to read? Lol, WTF? That's dumb. No one is reading so much that it's holding them back. Educating yourself and learning from people smarter than you is essential. Plus reading is a great hobby and helps you relax / destress / disconnect / find motivation to work. 

  
How about YOU stop circlejerking, get off Reddit and read a fucking book?"
