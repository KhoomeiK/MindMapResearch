AskReddit,fegayuu,t3_eou6il,1579085592.0,Used to wish there was a mix up at the hospital and my real family would come rescue me and love me.  At 42 Iâ€™d take that still.

aww,fdsjjuy,t1_fds6vwf,1578703950.0,"We lived in a house with a low fence in the back yard and it backed on to the neighborhood greenway.  My little Malti-poo is super sociable and friended a squirrel.  They would chase each other around the yard.  Watched my dog chase the squirrel along the fence, theyâ€™d get to the end and then the squirrel would chase Lulu to the other end. They would do this for hours on end.  Was fucking beautiful.  

Squirrel had a drinking problem though. We had crab apple trees that we couldnâ€™t keep on top off the fruit falling off so good as I was always working. Iâ€™d rake them into a pile at the end of the day and then just never really cleaned them up. Squirrel would tuck into a fermented apple and get all fucked up. Stumbling, slurring words, falling out of the tree. So now I had a squirrel to drink with!  Was fucking great.

Unfortunately. Story dosenâ€™t end well. Saw it try to climb a tree and it fell off. I ran outside to check on it and it had been hit by a car. Back legs where broken. Was a mess. And. Letâ€™s just end it there.  Broke my heart though."
