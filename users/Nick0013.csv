Pennsylvania,ffb18yq,t1_ffargh5,1579749285.0,The article you linked states that it’s due to a high cost of living and it’s mostly poorer people leaving the state. Taxes for a low income person are pretty comparable state to state and housing is much more likely to be a driving factor here.

This specific devolution from order to disorder indicates to me that there is no god."
YouShouldKnow,ff29jyw,t1_ff27qw8,1579497839.0,"Eh, I’m a science folk and I’m not a fan of Interstellar. It was kind of boring. Also, it did fairly well financially didn’t it? I remember *everybody* was going to see it when it came out. 

Science fiction movie quality is independent of technical correctness. They’re works of art, not technical documentation. Take 2001 a space odyssey. Huge inaccuracies everywhere but it’s still a fantastic movie partially because of those inaccuracies."

ControlTheory,fdw8v5j,t1_fdoqhpf,1578756246.0,"It’s a geometric series problem. Each time step has a constant ratio between terms. So the stability condition for a discrete system is the same as the stability for a geometric series for the same reasons. 

In general, it’s helpful to view discrete problems as series and sequence problems in the same way that we view continuous problems as function integral problems."
Damnthatsinteresting,fcwdf12,t1_fcwd8u4,1578022838.0,Yeah maybe but it really doesn’t feel like the best tool for the job
Damnthatsinteresting,fcwcq9f,t1_fcw9oly,1578022375.0,Image processing is slower than encoders which means a slower control loop rate and worse control. Camera setup is also a pain
ControlTheory,fcvlbcs,t1_fcu9t73,1578004548.0,"Nope, read the full page. Because the rocket engine is fixed, it provides a constant moment about the center of mass independent of attitude. Contrast this with an inverted pendulum which has a moment acting on it that is a function of the angle of the pendulum. Putting the engine on the bottom doesn’t make less stable just as putting it on top doesn’t make it more stable. 

Idk if you’re familiar with control theory outside of an interest or hobby. But if you’ve taken some kind of controls class, try finding the open loop transfer function of both with Newtonian methods. It’s relatively straightforward and you should see the differences pretty quickly. 

Also, I would highly recommend not taking offhand remarks from an introduction as hard truth. Authors will sometimes just think of an application that sounds like it fits when they’re doing something theoretical and feel like it should have a real world example. Case in point, that paper which is about inverted pendulum analysis and mentions stabilizing a rocket in passing. Look for rocket and missile stabilization sources for better information on that specifically."
ControlTheory,fctckau,t1_fct5h1c,1577939024.0,"That paper describes optimal flight path control, not attitude control. Also, viewing attitude control of a rocket as an inverted pendulum is incorrect. But it’s such a common misconception, there’s a Wikipedia article on it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy. Also, inverted pendulums can be pretty easily controlled with PID."
AskReddit,fcmyl4w,t1_fcmohw7,1577797765.0,"I don’t think so. A *lot* of authors have already jumped on this bandwagon. If you go into the life help section of any bookstore, it’s absolutely filled with books with swear words in the title. Idk if they’re all selling well. But it’ll be competing against a lot of the same."
space,fc6tm48,t1_fc6icrm,1577489172.0,"Oof, I mean maybe they made some poor nautical decisions to lead them to that point, but you’re really gonna strip them of the title of sailor?"
space,fc6fx4e,t1_fc6e1zb,1577479633.0,"Okay, I edited the comment to make sure that sailors were included as potential shipwreck survivors. This was always intended but extra clarity can’t hurt I guess."
space,fc6cndy,t1_fc6a0f3,1577477447.0,"Alright, so I assumed that we could lump sailors in with passengers. I am sorry that this is not an acceptable grouping. So anyway, the “unnamed collection of individuals who will in the future become shipwreck survivors which may or may not include sailors” have other safety communication methods that are more robust to aquatic conditions than phones.

Edit: changed the name of the group for clarity I guess?"
space,fc69ely,t1_fc66w7y,1577475306.0,"I mean, what? Your original meaning was pretty clear. And still, castaways (who were previously sailors) already have access to electronic communication. 

Do you take issue with me calling them sailors instead of shipwreck survivors? I only did this to emphasize that sailors have other safety measures available to them before they become shipwreck survivors."
space,fc67v66,t1_fc6665u,1577474289.0,"Yeah, it should be pretty close too it. Throughput is gonna be tough though. Most quotes I see are only in the range of a 10s of gigabit. Which is not great if you want any significant portion of a populated area to be using the local satellites as a relay and hoping to compete with the bandwidth provided by wired connection."
space,fc66fuy,t1_fc5e3pj,1577473345.0,Sailors already have electronic means of communication. That’s a big stretch to imply this is a life saving technology
space,fc6308k,t1_fc60j5r,1577471116.0,"I mean, sure. Which will help in some aspects. Still gonna suck compared to a wired connection. It’s not really meant to be better. It’s meant to tackle a different problem. Not really a controversial statement lol."
space,fc5iihv,t1_fc5b1wj,1577458537.0,Are they competing with Comcast? Because that’s not going to go well. Satellite internet is going to suck butt compared to any wired network connection. It’ll be great for getting internet to areas with poor internet infrastructure though.

aviation,fc12jn1,t1_fc0zx9s,1577306424.0,"Isn’t linearization of the problem the whole point? Like we don’t just make small angle approximations just because we can lol. If you wanted high fidelity at all angles of attack, you shouldn’t have chosen Thin Airfoil Theory to begin with."
space,fbz8l9x,t1_fbyf5ei,1577238484.0,r/space is generally kinda dumb about aerospace concepts. The fanboyism for SpaceX is also pretty excessive. Don’t set your expectations too high here lol.
gifsthatkeepongiving,fbxmi58,t1_fbwodcs,1577193927.0,"He’s getting downvoted because it’s just so wrong. Loss from habitual criminal activity (assuming that’s what’s being lumped in with this shenanigan) is soo incredibly small on public transit compared to every other cost that determines price. Operating costs, salaries, expansion, maintenance and replacement are *far* larger and more volatile costs that actually drive price increases."
dataisbeautiful,fbtdepu,t1_fbrzonr,1577075241.0,"To add to that, you need to increase your speed *again* at Mars to match orbit. So you artificially change your speed twice, both times increasing your speed, and end up slower"
