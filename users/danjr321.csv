DetroitRedWings,ffckh5z,t1_ffchuix,1579801376.0,I did not know that actually. I am trying to come up with a way to elevate the food/shelter for the cat while also keeping the Raccoon from getting to it. Just elevating it keeps pretty much everything else away except the raccoons because they climb fairly well.
DetroitRedWings,ffcbgfc,t1_ffc8sp6,1579795833.0,Yeah. Wasn't the biggest I have seen but definitely had size on my 13 pound cat. My dad and I trapped a 30+ pound female once that was mean as fuck.
DetroitRedWings,ffc1qno,t3_ess3t9,1579789337.0,"Found out a raccoon has been taking food from the outdoor cat we have been feeding. The raccoon must have been at least 20 pounds, and didn't bolt when I went outside. It went under my porch and stared at me through the hole for our outdoor faucet.

One of my indoor cats tried to go outside to fight it though. Think we are going to change up how we feed the cat to make it more likely that it gets the food. I had also built a little shelter but we think the cat hasn't used it because of the raccoon."

He is very protective of my 3 year old nephew and has to be near him all the time. When my nephew was a baby in the bouncer Zeus would lay with his head as close as he could get. Really good with kids, tolerates just about everything they do to him and always has. If any dogs I get in the future are even half as good with kids as he is then I will be happy.

I have been cracking packs and cards I won't use I have been trading for EDH staples or whatever. Last night I traded one of those Life Counters from the Anthology box set to a guy I play with for a card. We don't even always trade big stuff but little cards that we need for decks we swap around. It's another social aspect of the game IMO.

I have lost to that before as I wasn't able to get my answers since someone else at the table was messing with my tempo. It happens just move on, adding a couple counterspells or removal to a deck can make a difference.

EDH,fdnobx3,t3_em9es1,1578589881.0,"The social contract aspect is why I have decks of varying power levels and am going to cultivate lists of cards for some of my decks that can be swapped out for others in order to tune the power level to play with different people. My regular group at my smaller LGS has about 20 or so people that come either regularly or semi regularly. We can get 4 pods going most nights and have had every table full before.

I love when new players show up and enjoy themselves so much they keep coming back. We get some people who show up that were put off by another store in the area where everyone had expensive decks and they got stomped. We have a healthy mix of not only player types, but decks within those player types.

In our meta we have a coin flip deck, Sea Monster Tribal, Big ole dinos, Big ole dragons, a chaos deck, lifegain, tokens, and more. Even the guy with dual lands and super strong simic decks has an Orzhov Cleric tribal deck.

I am currently brewing a Jund shell that ideally will be some staples and rotational pieces that can be used for different commanders.

With the year of commander and all the commander product coming out we are sure to see an influx of new players. We need to make sure they enjoy their games and learn to love the format as much as we do."

Merchandise is a huge money maker and even bad Star Wars moves merchandise.

Mandalorian may be, fingers crossed, what changes how they view the product. A Star Wars expanded universe like the MCU would be printing money and create a new level of hype for Star Wars. With the MCU movie releases slowing down Star Wars would definitely work to fill in the between periods."
