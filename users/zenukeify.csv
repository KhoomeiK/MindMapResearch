OnePunchMan,fd0ejs2,t1_fcze14n,1578117695.0,"Lol, the 1000% Reigen is just to show that he absorbed all mob‚Äôs power and is now operating at a far higher level than he‚Äôs normally capable of. It‚Äôs ‚Äú1000% Regien‚Äù, not 1000% mob. Why are you doing math and extrapolation? ...
You completely misunderstood it, Reigen 1000% is equal to mob‚Äôs 100%, he literally just transferred
 all the energy. Christ."

whowouldwin,fc48ikv,t1_fc3xj1g,1577409499.0,"I think it could be closer than you imagine, I‚Äôm not sure if any of the humans can actually do enough damage to put the gorilla down with strikes. Their spine and skull are just much thicker and probably far more resistant to shock. I dont think body strikes will put down a gorilla either. Grappling wise I wonder if the fighters can hold it down enough to strike it at the back of the skull or something, or kick it/knee it on the ground which could do more"
