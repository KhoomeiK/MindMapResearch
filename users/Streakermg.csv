science,ff5sahe,t1_ff5nu8j,1579608329.0,This. This has always been my life's biggest mystery. What in the fuck was the dude doing when he figured it out.
NoStupidQuestions,ff2lcb0,t3_er1vm8,1579511546.0,I don't. But I'm also avoiding a lot of people.
TheExpanse,few2407,t1_fes6orx,1579404415.0,"To add to this, the sequel 2010 does actually explain what's going on in the first film. And in my opinion it's a pretty great film /novel."

TheCulture,fef762z,t3_eoreoh,1579049783.0,I started with Look to Windward. Great place to start in my opinion. The series is now my favourite series.

MelbEnts,fe7p5ug,t3_eo0ju5,1578917608.0,"The other guys are probably right, try some and find out. Though I've had bud that looked like this that was just flavoured with port during the grow process, though that doesn't seem like it would be common. Just try it though."

scifiwriting,fdjw314,t1_fdjutqy,1578489391.0,"All your organs are going to take a hit. Brain included. Heart as well. I think it's good to keep in mind you want them to have weakness too. Otherwise it's just a story of an immortal god. Far from a sci fi about a super soldier. Try to think of ways that he would stop the bomb going off, and for other attacks too. If they're able to just withstand any and all blows it's going to have no reason to keep reading and get very old very quick."
scifiwriting,fdjth6d,t1_fdjtdhi,1578486917.0,"It doesn't sound very plausible to survive having your organs turned to jelly even if they ""regenerate"". You'd be dead before the regeneration so you're saying essentially they can come back from the dead and regenerate. If that's the case then that's the umbrella for all injuries and attacks. He's now just immortal.
Vaporise the guy and he just comes back together? It's not really sci fi anymore."

All the things you're saying I've ran through. I've ran through every option. Every option. I wouldn't be deciding to euthenize if I hadn't. Thanks man, keep it up for those that can find answers though. You'll get through to some of them I swear."

SuicideWatch,fddad85,t1_fddabs2,1578302380.0,"I don't think so. And that's just putting my problems on someone else, and I do t want to combat my misery with even a modicum of misery on anyone else."
SuicideWatch,fddaacm,t1_fdda4df,1578302261.0,Yeah there is. But that seems to have no consequence. They're good for a chat. And to tell me that everything will work out. People love saying that. I think after almost 30 years I can say that's just not likely or true.

dankchristianmemes,fcyt36r,t1_fcwu83w,1578086486.0,You mean the sub dedicated to atheism? Yeah. So would r/Christianity be the sub for similar but opposite memes?

dankchristianmemes,fcw7k3j,t3_ej3pxx,1578018956.0,"I, respectful, disagree. How is it that they can't help themselves when all these memes are about atheists being snarky, and none from atheists about opposite. Seems a tad ironic and hypocritical."

printSF,fccqal3,t3_eh0uoz,1577601375.0,"Tor.com seem to have a couple of new ones a month and you can go back through old ones. Also dailysciencefiction.com have a new one everyday, though of slightly less quality I have to say. They do however have a very good categorisation of their stories (Aliens, dystopia, time travel etc.) so that helps

I'm really into short sci fi and I have to say the best methods so far is buying one of those big compilation books. Someone's already done the job of picking the best. It's fairly unlikely you'll find a crap story in one of those. There's an obscene amount out there so just go second hand, usually lots in thrift shops and second hand book shops. (I can recommend some particular if you'd like)

Hope this has helped, and please let me know if you find any other sources!"
