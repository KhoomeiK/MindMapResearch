Look into [high intensity exercise](https://youtu.be/ieyzL5OaPZk) for when you feel agitated and restless, and meditation at night ([Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/fVehL8oCOeY) is a good introduction). Listen to [sleep hypnosis videos](https://youtu.be/wNfyu2yV4l4) when your withdrawal keeps you up.

Keep a journal and write whatever’s on your mind. Write down your positive qualities (strength is an obvious one). Write down things in your life you’re grateful for. This will help you stop wanting what you don’t have (more weed).

Addiction is not you, it’s something that happens to you, and it’s only a perception based on chemicals. Don’t try to visualize the rest of your life without something you crave, just take it one day at a time.

It’s ok to be alone to work on yourself, but you’re never alone here. We’re all in your corner OP. You got this. 👊🏻"
