The fur doesn’t look cut to me except for maybe the feet have been trimmed, which I did for my boy else they got really shaggy. Otherwise, it looks like it’s grown out to its natural length. I don’t see sharp edges.  Anyway, it just looks very much like my boy, who died a couple years ago."

Rowing,fenzgbe,t1_fenwdan,1579293024.0,"Yes I live in the US, and I’m familiar with how insurance works — both medical and general liability. That’s why I wonder about what this is for. I want these injured athletes to get what they need. But I question the practice of setting up a gofundme account for every unfortunate event because there’s no accountability for the money. And there’s no way to even know whether the person who set it up is authorized to act on behalf of the people who are supposed to benefit."

By the time she was a year old she started turning into a nice little companion.  She’ll be two inMay and I feel more bonded with her every day. I don’t remember it taking this long with previous dogs, but each dog is different and our circumstances change.  I take my dog to dog day care once a week or so to give myself a break and that helps."

It helped me to find a good dog daycare. I take her one afternoon a week and it costs $20. If I could afford more visits, I’d take her more. She doesn’t love it, but it’s good for her because she needs to be around other dogs and other people. And it’s good for me. When you live alone with a dog, it’s too easy for it to become overly attached, I think."

Dogtraining,fecn4ry,t3_eogj4s,1578978068.0,"Nobody likes everybody.  People don’t. Dogs don’t either. My suggestion would be to make your dog pay attention to you — look you in the eye — instead of paying attention to the dog he hates (or whatever other distraction might be bothering him) until you’re a safe distance away from it. Reward him with high value treats for looking at you, not the rotten dog.  If you don’t already know how to use a clicker for training, this would be a good project to learn it for."

Put in the work early to teach your puppy what is expected and be consistent. It will pay off quickly. My puppy was pretty good as puppies go  — slept through the night, liked being in her crate for long naps — but she was still horrible because she required a huge time commitment. She’ll be 2 in May and now I can honestly say it was worth it.  It probably would have helped to have someone sharing the burden, so I’m glad you have that going for you."

Dogtraining,fe3j8yu,t3_enpufg,1578849705.0,"You have to go out with the dog on a leash rather than just sticking them outside. Watch ‘em like a hawk inside or stick them in a crate. It’s torture, yes, for a while. I forgot how hard puppies are but now that mine is coming up on 2 yrs, all is forgiven. Put in the work early and it will pay off."
Havanese,fe3i4hw,t3_enpoci,1578849443.0,"Well, I sat in my kitchen with my Havanese puppy until I was sure she was reliable. I had baby gates and only gradually expanded the area in which she was free to roam. I trained her to ring jingle bells when she wanted to go out and that helped bridge the communication gap. It got abused eventually, but I still took her out when she rang. If you’re sticking your dog outside alone, switch to taking her out on a leash instead and tell her “go potty.”  When she goes, say “good girl, go potty” so she learns the words. I watched my puppy like a hawk when she was inside and, when she had an accident inside, I’d gasp loudly if I saw her doing it. She eventually got the idea.  I think she was 9 months old or so before I trusted her completely.  Frankly, I thought I’d go crazy before she was trained but now that we’re there, all is forgiven. 

I have to say that I think it took longer for my girl bc I was trying to get her to go on a grass patch on my balcony. She hated it. When I finally gave up and started taking her outside, it got easier."

You can get from one side of the mountains to the other on Tioga Pass Rd, which goes through Yosemite. It’s closed in winter (generally opens sometime between Memorial Day and end of June), but it’s a gorgeous drive and well worth your time.
