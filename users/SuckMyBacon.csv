AskReddit,fem6sz6,t1_fem4on2,1579241797.0,"Alright so I’m gonna keep this brief because I’m not gonna waste anymore time on toxic trolls like you. I assume you were some frat guy back in the day so maybe I hit a nerve with you. I’m not saying all frats are bad some are great, but there is and has been a lot of sketchy shit going on with some university fraternities. Also I never applied to any universities and don’t have any gripes with anyone from a fraternity. 

Nice you dug into my post history too. That comment you linked was me referring to my job as minimum wage. Yes some of the people I worked with did make minimum wage. But I did not, I made more than minimum wage because of my prior experience in that field of work when I got hired fyi. I no longer work there. 

Also I don’t know what your trying to get out of this. Whether you’re trying to get a rise out of me or if you’re trying to start an argument I don’t know. All I know is your probably in your 20s and you’re still digging into people online like this and that’s pretty sad. Grow up man. 

This is my final reply to this. I’m not wasting anymore of my time into negativity. I got better stuff to do."
AskReddit,felmvrf,t1_felhzb1,1579225980.0,"I’m not saying what I’m saying just to say it. There is truth and evidence behind what I’ve stated. Even things I have experienced first hand at real frat parties. Here’s a decent article  you since you can’t look it up yourself: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/the-dark-power-of-fraternities/357580/

Also buddy don’t take out your bullshit on me here. Take your shit somewhere else or learn how to deal with it properly. You obviously have some personal problems going on in your life to be toxic enough to reply to me twice. I am not the shitposter here you are. Also I don’t work a minimum wage job so get bent."
AskReddit,felguc8,t1_felggqg,1579221849.0,No conspiracy theory. There’s been numerous documentaries done on this subject. Corrupt shit goes on at a lot of these frat houses including the deaths of students who were “hazed” in order to join certain frats. They would often force them to consume enough alcohol or drugs to the point of them passing out and dying. Don’t even get me started on the amount sexual assaults that go on there aswell.
AskReddit,felg2rx,t1_fekrlkl,1579221342.0,Could make an even juicier story about the corrupt things that go on at some of the frat houses around those universities. Some really illegal stuff goes on in those places and it’s not just the hazing of newcomers. Guaranteed many schools have covered up bad things done by high ranking students especially the sports stars at these frat houses.

In order to cremate a body the temperatures need to be very high meaning the kernels will burn up on contact with the machine. Either that or they will pop into popcorn and instantly turn into ash from the heat. Meaning it would barley even be visible after the process.

GetMotivated,fcjnknv,t1_fcjglaa,1577695355.0,"Yeah. I think what hurt the most was everyone’s ignorance towards him treating me like that. There were a few guys that stood up for me and told him to screw off about it. But besides that everyone sorta got used to his behaviour. Last time I had a hangout invite from one of my closer friends it was, “Hey you wanna hangout with me and ‘toxic guy’?” Obviously I declined. But it’s like why would I wanna be around that? He knows how the guy treats me and he tries to invite me out with him... Hell no. It’s a shame cause I do actually wanna be around those real friends sometimes. But burning a bridge means sometimes you gotta limit yourself from things you actually like."

GetMotivated,fcj8xja,t3_ehdo84,1577680229.0,"Definitely agree with this one about my last friend group. We’ve all been around each other since high school, some even since middle school. But there was always this one asshole guy in the group who picked on me like no other. He obviously had some sort of sheltered problems going on in his life for him to behave like that. Of course I was the main target of it, partially cause Im generally a nice person. I wanted to be with my other friends but he was always there. Every single hang out or group activity he had to be there. I’ve told him to stop it in the past and he half ass apologized for it at one point. But he went back to old habits and one day I got sick of it and distanced myself from the whole group ever since. I had to burn that bridge for sure. Maybe one day I can hang out with a few of my real friends again but for now that bridge has got to stay burned. Adios to the toxic assholes."

AskReddit,fcit95r,t3_eh8gs2,1577669265.0,"Edibles can fuck you up.

Do not underestimate those tiny gummies or baked goods. They can send you to a whole new world that can be very terrifying. I remember having lots of fun the first time I took edibles. They were still pretty strong but quite an enjoyable experience. Of course I was very eager to try them a second time at a party with friends.

 They were these baked peanut butter weed crackers I ate half of one not even. That shit hit me like a train and I was sent into a world where I could barely even walk let alone talk. It was a terrifying experience and I didn’t know how I would get home. Each minute felt like 10 minutes, it was almost like I was being tortured or something but no pain involved. At the peak of it when I went to the bathroom because of how I felt I saw myself in the third person. It was a brief moment but it truly happened. I kept telling everyone around me that I felt like I was on acid and I felt like I was dying. Luckily one of my sober buddies was able to take me home because at that point I was so fucked up i couldn’t even call a cab. I finally got home to my mom and threw up. Definitely a 4/10 experience would not do again, but it is entertaining to remember what I saw that night.

My eyes seriously opened up to how dangerous edibles can be. I remember being in high school at the time and hearing 14 year olds talk about doing them like I couldn’t even imagine some poor young kid getting that screwed up. Especially here in Canada they’re easily accessible now. There needs to be more awareness about the dangers of them. Although the experience changes from person to person."
AskReddit,fcipmwe,t1_fcgrn2w,1577666837.0,The opposite for me I start talking about stupid shit for hours.

teenagers,fc8gfwn,t3_egmtfq,1577534363.0,"My mom does this type of stuff all the time. One time we were in the city for an event and we left mall which has open bathrooms. My mom wanted to check for something at the mall but the last time we wandered around we got lost which was extremely frustrating. I was on a time limit for the event anyways so I just said “Let’s just go”. 

So we left and my mom starts acting all moody and I ask her why and she says she has to pee really badly. I’m like “Well just use one of the bathrooms at Starbucks or somethin” she said no because the bathrooms in the city often require you to buy something first or are in use. But I say bullshit to that because public bathrooms are public bathrooms. Sure some places will make you buy something but most brand name chains won’t give a fuck. Those minimum wage employees aren’t going to stop you.

 She refuses to go anyways and is moody the entire way there saying I didn’t let her use the bathrooms at the mall. No I didn’t stop you from using the bathrooms I just wanted to leave the right way so we don’t get lost like last time. She said nothing about going to the bathroom at the mall. When we got to the event there were public bathrooms but still god damn speak up when you need to go to the bathroom. 

All I know is if this happens again I’m going to any fucking place with a toilet even if I have to spend $5 on something idgaf. Just so I don’t have to listen to that bullshit."
