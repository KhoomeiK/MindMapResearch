LivestreamFail,fcuotwy,t1_fcum35p,1577985526.0,wow thats incredibly selective
LivestreamFail,fcuosp5,t1_fcucd3x,1577985507.0,"Yeah, its her fault for being around a predatory guy who she met at 14. I mean it was New Years, obviously that somehow makes this her fault."
LivestreamFail,fcuf1nx,t1_fcu1xa6,1577979392.0,"Not according to the article that came out an hour ago where she basically said ""everything is fine, fuck off"". Which is obviously super clearly bullshit."
LivestreamFail,fcuc4d6,t1_fcuasyy,1577977514.0,"> You shouldn't be drinking with old creepy guys you know you are vulnerable to

Maybe go back and reread this and think about it"

LivestreamFail,fcualrf,t1_fcua0cz,1577976510.0,"That was kind of my point here, it wasnt the same situation at all."
LivestreamFail,fcuainb,t1_fcu9qe6,1577976447.0,"That was low key my point, the other commenter was being a dunce. It wasnt at all the same situation"

saltierthancrait,fcu6ry3,t1_fctp22u,1577973910.0,This makes sense with an interview I saw with Boyega where he *completely* shut down any idea of him coming back to do anymore disney/star wars.
LivestreamFail,fcu0mm1,t1_fctuh7e,1577968418.0,Wow victim blame much

aww,fcmk979,t1_fcmcc6d,1577778719.0,Wary or leery (suspicious) but not weary (tired)
todayilearned,fcm2p0r,t1_fcm0sih,1577762674.0,That's not an acceptable level to control pain at for a lot of people and thinking that's an acceptable quality of life for a number of people is not ok
todayilearned,fcm2hg0,t1_fcm1pyw,1577762514.0,"Exactly. I have high tolerance, most of my family does, but my poor uncle is worst. They accuse him of being a recovering addict every time and every time they have to give him herds of drugs because he has an unusual resistance. Not cool"

todayilearned,fcm29oq,t1_fclvt6b,1577762352.0,"Frankly, I beg to differ. I'm genuinely, honestly sorry for all the people with a propensity for opioid addiction, but I do not have that problem and I dont like being in pain or my loved ones being in pain because the doctors are afraid."

worldnews,fc1jukz,t1_fc1eymf,1577320920.0,I thought presently the decision was made to extradite her?
todayilearned,fc1awkb,t1_fc0svo2,1577313299.0,"Yeah, people here are uncomfortable with the reality that what 14-17 looks like is damn near identical to the manufactured image of 18- 27 yr old in ""barely legal porn"". 

They want to feel like they can see a difference. Nope."
todayilearned,fc1am8a,t1_fc0rkj7,1577313059.0,A lot of uncomfortably young women have curves
todayilearned,fc1ajf1,t1_fc0tyji,1577312992.0,"Yeah, I honestly think people *want* that to be what someone of age looks like so they don't feel weird about the fact that they watch a lot of porn where the actresses, realistically, look very young."
todayilearned,fc1aciy,t1_fc0nihe,1577312832.0,She looks iffy for sure
todayilearned,fc1aahs,t1_fc0lgjs,1577312785.0,"What could possibly make you think that? Her appearance totally looks like she could easily be underage in some of her older pictures. A lot of girls get serious curves at 13-14 of even younger. Frankly I was one of them, she is not unmistakably of age"
AskReddit,fc0rmr8,t1_fc052zi,1577297996.0,"Cities in the USA are obviously much, much younger. Maybe they shouldn't have been built around people having cars, but the reality isn't such a crazy thing"

AskReddit,fc0n0z8,t1_fc013u1,1577294929.0,"That confuses me. My default setting is friendly and people are always *very* friendly towards me, and that explains why I felt so uncomfortable in a few places in Europe. I thought I had to be doing something wrong, I felt like I was getting the cold shoulder."
