Advice,fezaev5,t1_fez505n,1579455329.0,"You could try at home coloring, try something to see if you can find something else that looks better, if she doesnt want to go to another stylist. 
One idea is, before seeing her next, go get a bunch of home coloring kits in several different colors and shades, then when you see her, show them to her, give her the chance to look through them as you two talk. Give her options of what she might like to try, and which color she might like. Make it completely nonconfrontational, just give her plenty of options to choose from.
If she chooses, you color it, and she looks good, all for the best, if it doesnt look right, then try to talk to her about a different stylist.

Advice,fez8l6f,t3_eqyqcg,1579454838.0,"The human brain is the most complex and complicated thing on this planet, you toss a wrench in a car engine, you damage it, possibly destroy it, and need to get it fixed. The brain is a million times more complex than any engine, it can heal itself when damaged, sometimes remarkably so, and it can also make some serious mistakes,  and have bad problems.
Shame about mental health is a long standing stigma because of fear about mentall illnesses and being associated with ""insane"" people. Your mind, your emotional wellbeing absolutely deserve respect and care just like the rest of your body, and mental and emotional problems cand and are more disabling to your life than nearly any physical impairment or disability.
When you have the flu, (or any physical illness), you see a doctor. When you are having problems mentally/emotionally, you absolutely should see a therapist or psychiatrist. Never feel ashamed trying get to a better place and improve your life, its yours, noone elses, and they have no right to determine the value of your mental wellbeing. Only you have that right. If you are in a bad place, please, do seek out help. Evryone needs help sometimes.
Also, consider that everyone, and i do mean everyone, has some sort of mental health problem, just that most are undiagnosed."
Advice,fez5vjb,t3_eqyrgu,1579454087.0,"Tricky. You can talk to her, tell her about your thoughts, but phrase it in such a way that she knows you are concerned about her, worried about her and want to help. What happens afterward depends on her reaction. If she changes, all for the good. If she continues acting this way, you will have a difficult choice to make. If she continues to act this way, you could call her out on her behavior, but unless you do it publically, she probably wont change, and publically outing this behavior could have repurcussions, she might and probably will try to play the victim, might try to sway your other friends in her favor, and might try to backstab you by talking about you to your other friends when you are not around, or by spreading rumors.
If you do decide to end the friendship, the safest way might be to slowly phase her out, talk to her a little less when you see her, take linger to respond to her messages and say a little less in them when you do reply. Give her legitimate excuses why you cant meet up, so she doesnt think its because of her, and doesnt take offence."
Advice,fez38tr,t3_eqynbh,1579453483.0,"You may have talked her into it, but ultimately  it was her decision. That sai, consider splitting the cost, paying a lortion of what she is being charged.

Aside from the obvious of possibly growing close to someone, if you are careful enough, interacting with her and showing her the world, guiding her to new things, (assuming that she wants to do so, and has and further develops growing interest beyond texting on her phone, which isnt necessarily a guarantee), your personal skills, communication, the way you deal with other people will grow and you will gain wisdom simply through interacting with her. Remember that everyine grows and develops nkt simply thrkugh experiencesm but interactions with other people, probably more from the latter than former.
If she has just led a closed and sheltered life, you dont even really have to go ouf of your way to show her more.

Advice,fe5s2eo,t3_envmxy,1578873719.0,"Try alternating heat and cold. Heat some water up, soak a wasrag or small towel, hold it to the affected skin. Switch to ice or an ice pack , then repeat. Warmth opens the blood vessels wider, then the chill makes the body withdraw blood from contacted area. It might help.
If nothing else, at some point before the end of the day, when noone is in the same room, make a loud sound, drop something heavy, and then say you stumbled and fell against the corner of something like a counter.
Try also putting pressure betwenn repetitions of the heat and cold, after heat but before cold. Not a huge amount of pressure, but press against the spot firmly. Supposedly it helps bruises to fade quicker.

Advice,fdy5rsh,t3_encykv,1578776410.0,"The grandparents are the problem, solely and completely. In my mind, its always best to have as much information about a situation as possible, so, i think, its best that your uncle knows all that is going on. You and your mother, him and his wife, all of you should get together and tell him all of it, so everyone of you is in the know. Make sure he knows you all are there for him.
At this point, its very unlikely your grandparents will change significantly for the better, and if disowning him is what they intend to do, then so be it. You can all let your moms parents know thag disowning hi. Is a terrible thing to do, using clear and concise words, no swearing or insulting them while you do so. Be clear in what you are feeling, but do so in such a way that tells them you dont support what they are going to do. Make that, whatever happens, it will be from what they choose to do next.
It is very possible that, instigated by you four, or even by your moms parents, that any relationship between them and any of the four of you will be ended, and that might be for the best. If you all went no contact with them, thatmmight actually be such a shock that, after some time, they might actually at least begin to realize what they have done, and what they have done in the past.

The only exception was more certain elements summoned, namely from fire, because fire was the epitome of pure uncontrolled power and chaos.
The thing with Stregobor, I dont think it was that he was powerless against those people, more that he so believed that Renfri was a mutant and herald of the Big Bad Forces of Evil, he was so convinced she was, that he was just scared shitless, and didnt want to be near her, while she was still alive, at least.
And, part of it, if he didnt believe she was an agent of the Big Evil, he was still probably terrified of the woman because of all that she had suffered because of him, i.e. rape, attacks, imprisonment, torture (i think), and she had somehow survived all this, and was now hunting him.
