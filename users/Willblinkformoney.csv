LifeProTips,ff3mzde,t1_ff2r6k8,1579544513.0,I usually have to see something more than once to grasp it fully regardless. So I use 1.5-1.75 (sometimes even 2) depending on the person speaking and then I either rewatch or use other sources as needed.

leagueoflegends,fcvzxtf,t1_fcur3t0,1578013944.0,"Being a pro in league definitely seems a lot better than dota 2, unless you're top dog. However, as a player of both games - dota 2 esport is way more fun than League. The league format is just simply pretty boring, doesnt feel like there's any real stakes until playoff and usually playoff is about at most 1 or 2 placements, who gets enough points for worlds spot and who gets direct qualifier.

That means supporting any teams but the top 2-3 team and you're really only looking at hoping they play well, maybe they can surprise? Meanwhile in football, you have league winner, CL qualification, europa league and relegation. You also have transfers mid-season and pressure on teams to change players. LoL esports lack these factors and that makes the format much less exciting than Dota 2, because all the majors are really important. The biggest teams slack and just wait for TI, maybe even skip a major. The smaller teams you can follow in minors and in majors where they scramble to do well and improve. A lot more excitement, for big and small teams alike.

But its unstable, and your favorite teams disband and reform all the time in various setups. That could be changed with Valve enforcing some more rules for stability, cause I dont think the format of circuit is the problem."

underlords,fc73xsz,t1_fc6y64a,1577496887.0,"You'll end up with a very similar build every game, and each comp in league is much more ""similar"" than a dota comp is. There are perhaps 2-3 defined item build paths for your hero, depending on which role you play. Some heroes only have one. And your role in the game is largely determined in champion select. You'll rarely suddenly decide to build support/damage items if you were designated the opposite role in champion select. 

League is neither harder nor easier to become good at than dota2 - i've played much more league. But it's relatively predictable and much less complex."

hearthstone,fc1kgif,t1_fc1ge44,1577321447.0,"But it's necessary. I'd rather have face hunter be part of the meta than have a meta designed around who puts the most greedy dragons in their deck. It fucking sucks to lose a 10 min match because you realize your opponent cut so many anti aggro cards, nothing you did would matter in the end."
hearthstone,fc1kaif,t1_fc1bw52,1577321301.0,"Priest is indeed in a fine spot right now. However it is a very polarizing deck. Once you load in and see your opponent, you either have a very significant advantage or a not insignicant disadvantage. It's not as bad as old freeze mage, but it's still annoying. HS is healthier if the game is decided by what your opponent does, not which class he plays."
hearthstone,fc1k4vo,t1_fc1aw6k,1577321164.0,"Put a tinkmaster overspark, silence or leeroy in your deck. Dont attack until you have a significant board. Win at least 50%. 

Leeroy spawns to 1/1s, fucking up their ressurection (and trades well against 2/6). Silence gives you surprise lethal, tinkmaster overspark is fun tech."
