homestuck,ff3oahd,t1_ff3mg0s,1579545321.0,I would expect a universe controlling program to be cross like computing thing. Like I expect this to run on a calculator made out of stones. To be fair it probably doesn't have any non-universal (pun absolutely intended) dependencies.
homestuck,ff2de1s,t3_er8moo,1579501611.0,Another is to make the whole thing happen in the first place and potentially manipulating the whole universe (multiverse?)
homestuck,ff20fba,t3_er29my,1579490488.0,Linux support anytime soon?
chromeos,fet35zu,t1_fess9k6,1579371348.0,I don't think this will work since crosinti doesn't support virtualization which most VMs use
chromeos,femkway,t1_felj1ix,1579260656.0,The whole point of chrome os is that everything is in the cloud. That's the only reason this level of encryption is accepted. As even the files app says the downloads folders contents are not 100% guaranteed to be there the next day.
chromeos,felbmhb,t1_fel9h6x,1579218374.0,Post it to a image sharing sit you can link to. imigur.com is a commonly used one.
ProgrammerHumor,fel9yqg,t1_fekzho8,1579217295.0,"That's basically a gray hat. You don't ask permission, but you don't steal or brake things (too much.)"
chromeos,fel9dl7,t3_eppglx,1579216917.0,I am confused can you send a screenshot?
Piracy,fei7vh2,t1_fegud6o,1579132242.0,was it a zip bomb?
chromeos,fegucpe,t1_fegis71,1579102726.0,"Or to install chrome through Android or Linux, but these are not as optimal as the built in chrome."
chromeos,fef0iix,t1_fedbhan,1579045316.0,This is one of the worst parts because if your chrome os expieres so does the chrome browser. However they have been extending the deadline so some devices which have received the last update got extended further.
chromeos,feezuqs,t3_eom42c,1579044884.0,You can just hit enter it will log you in without clicking
chromeos,fdsls4r,t3_emonnz,1578704847.0,"I updated to beta just now. I might be experiencing issues, but launching chros and starting the container with vmc start termina worked"

chromeos,fd01emz,t3_ejqyf1,1578112194.0,You can open Microsoft office files and allows somewhat limited editing while leaving it in doc format.
ProgrammerHumor,fcw5nhu,t3_eix4u2,1578017723.0,I am new to git. And I am wondering who would you fuck up that much.
ProgrammerHumor,fcw5c6n,t1_fcvp3gm,1578017512.0,Ohh 100% confidence that's rare
chromeos,fcvrx2c,t3_ej48i3,1578008726.0,"Adb should be installed in the default shell if you have developer mode enabled. If you don't want developer mode than I would try to install ADB like how you would on Ubuntu and see what happens.

I have never done this and don't know what I am doing so take this with a grain of salt."
chromeos,fcvre0b,t3_ej4j9a,1578008383.0,This is dark mode right?
chromeos,fcp1sn9,t1_fcp1o9z,1577847850.0,Here is one I use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.usurvey
chromeos,fcp17bh,t1_fcp0u8b,1577847336.0,Use an Android app for that
chromeos,fcoawlv,t3_ei7sry,1577827777.0,I am surprised that website still uses flash. Since the whole reason flash is being shut down is because it's so insecure and a bank is still using that?
WearOS,fcoahn6,t3_ei4d9x,1577827492.0,I get these all the time for as long as I can remember.
chromeos,fcjhfcr,t3_ehhjyt,1577687710.0,"What kind of app is that? You can try deleting the app and re adding it, but you might have already tried that."
chromeos,fcc4r9e,t1_fcbswtc,1577594399.0,"Commenting ""not true"" is not useful in any kind of sense since you didn't even try to give a reason why I am incorrect. 

Since I seem to have some skeptics here is some evidence: [https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1700055?hl=en&ref\_topic=3415535#save](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1700055?hl=en&ref_topic=3415535#save) this official help post gives an example of saving a file to google drive using the files app. Other references cannot be found on the help forums as saving and using files on Google Drive should be seamless and self-explanatory.  

Additionally, your drive is mounted inside Chrome OS at /media/fuse/drivefs-\[your-super-long-hased-google-user-id\]/root/ meaning you can browse Google Drive on a Linux command line if you have developer mode enabled."
chromeos,fcb7za9,t3_egvd7b,1577583546.0,If it's in the Google drive folder it will sync after a bit. This will only show up if you refresh the page since the webapp doesn't sync on its own.
chromeos,fc7lvcr,t3_egmc9k,1577511684.0,Probably something went wrong or is taking too long on launching the app that's why ARC is showing up. It might have also crashed so I would say restart the computer and try again.
chromeos,fc7jwqk,t3_egi8px,1577509784.0,VLC player (the Android version because the Linux and native versions all have their various faults) is the best player for general media. It can play files while it is being downloaded and should be able to detect a misnamed file too. It also has many customisations for playing videos or audio.
facepalm,fbytq88,t3_ef6fwc,1577226082.0,r/woooosh we need to start putting these here
blackmagicfuckery,fbx32th,t1_fbx2r90,1577167390.0,"Probably has been said, but I am not about to taint my search history with that."

ProgrammerHumor,fbwmwtm,t3_eel58w,1577154123.0,Anyone else pissed at the muli-line comment being used here?
chromeos,fbwi9mk,t3_eetk18,1577150638.0,Does the task manager show high network usage?
chromeos,fbtcx09,t3_eef8gm,1577074816.0,In the drawer or in the tabs? For the tabs it's cards and for the drawer it's something containing overview if I can remember correctly. I will come back later and update this
