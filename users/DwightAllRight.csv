explainlikeimfive,feom9dj,t1_femsclw,1579302033.0,"But if the engine is running at the same rpm, regardless of road speed, how is more fuel burned? As the guy above said. 2000rpm is 2000rpm. In 3rd gear that's 25mph, in 6th it's 55mph. Engine rotates same amount, injects the same amount of fuel, etc.

Unless because 6th has less torque it's actually increasing fuel flow for the same rpm to gain more power."

tifu,fe47n9g,t1_fe3x5un,1578856491.0,"Right? Even when my last girlfriend and I broke up, since it was late and stormy outside she invited me to spend the night in bed anyways. We just cuddled, nothing beyond. It's like, if we're not in a relationship anymore and we can get over sleeping in the same bed, like damn dude.

Edit: To clarify some questions I'm getting. Neither of us were happy we broke up, and we agreed to stay on good terms afterwards. The breakup was not because we stopped caring about each other, it was cordial, there was no animosity, and in a way we were consoling each other. Don't judge unless you know the closer details. Thank you."

I don't pretend vaping is healthy, but it's far better than the alternative. And you might have missed the part where I said I don't support underage vaping and actively prevent it myself. Plus, I'm trying to have a genuine discussion, you're just calling me names. Not a very strong position you have."

worldnews,fdkt3rc,t1_fdkkbaw,1578510590.0,"So by your logic not being completely politically binary is an issue in the US? You must be fully left or fully right? No middle ground? No compromise? I'm not personally a centrist, but that belief is most of the problem right now. People are allowed to, and really should have a diversity of opinions. Otherwise you get the partisan warzone that is our current political climate. Independent thought I guess really is on a downward slope."
