aww,fclneyr,t1_fclfvdy,1577751891.0,Click on the image then see who posted that and then back out the see who posted it again. Drown in the void is the guy who reposted the video. And all the team2 is the guy who was the first to post unless he got it from youtube or somewhere else.
aww,fclebd0,t3_ehsgi9,1577745816.0,This dog is awesome. But stop reposting other stuff your account is just reposting stuff or taking other people video. Stop greeding over karma. Just because you reposted someone else video and got awards and likes and the original post didn't doesn't mean you keep stealing other post. I really don't care if you dislike this but if you do look at the guys account who posted this video and think to yourself is this ok.
