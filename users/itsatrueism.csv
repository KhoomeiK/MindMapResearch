TwoXChromosomes,fesk9t3,t1_feshiyy,1579366112.0,"I can relate to your comment on the sense of entitlement  and of the men being the aggressor giving women a sense of vulnerability. Of course
all valid.

After saying that, when this woman launched at me in the lift, I suddenly realised my options were
limited. If I attacked back, it could back fire on me as then it’s her word against mine.
As it happened I did nothing and when the lift door opened two male colleagues saw my shirt
and tie all disheveled and immediately understood what happened. 
No recourse resulted.

Another incident I witnessed was a female boss
smacking very hard the bottom of her male employee.
I looked at her and she smiled and said I can do that to him but if he did that to me, he’s fired.

I have seen women batter there husbands and then call the cops to say he attacked her.

I think both your and my comments have validity
as both sexes can exploit dynamics.

Perhaps male prevalence of sexism is higher and has a different form but it doesn’t detract from
the other way around."

A better analogy would be if a woman came up to a man and said “nice ass” or” great abs”. How would the guy feel.

Going by your example how would you react if a woman came up to you and said “ cute ass” or “ nice tits”.

Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

try and rip my tie and shirt off when we were in a

We are really only talking about the extreme orthodox Jews here.
In a way the Holocaust made it clear to them that no where in the world is safe for Jews . Actually that’s more relevant in current times since the end of the Holocaust.
So several things are going on here.

1. Israel is the only safe place for them and they want to hold on to it.

2. Arabs  in the Middle East generally want them
    out if Israel and dead if possible .

3. Because they are orthodox they believe  as it’s the second holiest city it belongs to them.

Most non religious Israeli’s want to live in peace
and the 2 million Israeli Arabs enjoy living in Israel.

Now. ask this question .

If the shoe was on the other foot, do you think the Arabs would allow a single Israeli Jew  to live peacefully in Israel ?

800.000 Jews were expelled from the Arab countries where they were hanged for reading Hebrew.

So no Jews in:-

Syria 
Jordan
Egypt
Lebanon
Iran
Iraq
Gaza
