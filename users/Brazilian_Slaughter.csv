1. O RU é muito dependente da Europa, comercialmente.

2. Como retaliação pelo Brexit, a Alemanha vai fazer de tudo pra UE comer o cu do RU com farinha. Até pra mostrar como exemplo aos outros que tentarem sair - como a Itália.

3. Brasil no governo Bolsonaro tá super-interessado em novos parceiros comerciais.

4. O RU também tá super-interessado em novos parceiros comerciais, especialmente os que não forem EUA e Europa.


Não é coincidência que eles sugeriram um acordo de comercio e apoiaram nossa entrada na OCDE praticamente ao mesmo tempo. Substituir Europa com Brasil é bom pra eles. E é bom pra nós também.

In my language, the tendency seems to be against linguistic divergence. There has been a lot of effort towards unifying the language with gramatical reforms and whatnot. The Portuguese seem to dislike it because they believe the language is being led to Brazilian Portuguese being the defining standard, the ""main"" form of Portuguese. African portuguese sounds a lot more like Portugal Portuguese, but recently more brazilian media and general contact is apparently making their language more Brazilian-like.

Of course, ""Brazilian Portuguese"" is relative. Brazilian Portuguese is very diverse.

And then there's the issue of wherever Galician is Portuguese or a very close language. The current consensus seems to be leaning that Galician IS Portuguese.

That said, these reasons don't apply to the Fallout world, which suffered a serious world-wide cataclysm. Isolation and loss of contact are good reasons that lead to Linguistic Drift."

Fallout's story was just fantastic. The Water Chip was a excellent yet grounded motivator, the Time Limit was a perfect fire in the player's ass to get things done. Act 1 was finding the Water Chip, and in the process there was a good amount of foreshadowing about the Super Mutants, the Children of the Cathedral, etc. Then there's the simple yet quite logical objective of destroying the mutant armies and their leader, which led the Vault Dweller on a epic journey across the sinister Mariposa and the horror that lies beneath the Cathedral.

The game, even in its sidequests, just oozes good story.

Then there's The Master, who is still the best Fallout antagonist and the one who sets the bar for all the others. Seemingly evil, he is yet intelligent, calm, utterly chilling and makes a damn good point.


Fallout New Vegas also has a fantastic story. The simple but effective motivation of getting the Platinum Chip. Waking up in Goodsprings to find yourself in the middle of a war zone.

Fallout,fewme2s,t3_eqrivf,1579414570.0,"Technically, FEV cure has been said to be possible since Fallout 1 by ZAX. 

Dr. Henry in 2 also tried to cure Super Mutation but it just melted the test subject.

I think the biggest group affected by the concept of an FEV cure would be... The Enclave. No, really. The whole thing about the Enclave's racism was because they saw the mutated genome of mainland humans, altered by radiation and FEV, and became convinced that mainlanders weren't even human anymore. 

We also know from Vree's autopsy of a Super Mutant, that Super Muties are literally overflowing with Forced Evolutionary Virus.

So yeah, if healing Super Mutants is possible, then healing the more discrete mutations of mainlander humans should be possible, at least the ones caused by FEV. Hell, it might be possible to immunize them against the FEV.

That could change the Enclave's plan entirely.

Agreed.

I would say its also a pioneer in totally destroying the mold of the old super-hero movie trilogy. Remember all the old stock tropes? Lemee see:

- There are three movies

- First movie is a origin story movie

- The central super-hero is pretty much the only one, maybe barring a few other allies.

- There's no wider universe.

- In the second movie, the hero fights two villains.

MCU really brought a lot of cool super-hero comics elements to the Big Screen.

alphacentauri,fej7prg,t3_eiuurn,1579160423.0,"Honestly, when it comes to mods, I have three suggestions:

1. If you are an SMAC purist, go with Kyrub's AI patch. It vastly boosts the AI. Its only compatible for SMAC. It builds upon Scient's patch, so its Scient+++.

2. If you want to play SMAX Single-Player, go with Thinker Mod. It was a joy to play with it, the AI really got strong.

3. If you want to play SMAX Multiplayer, I recommend Binary Dawn. Its the best SMAC multiplayer experience that I had. It also fix a number of easy exploits and makes combat far more tactical than ""Chop 'n Drop"". Its built off Yitzi's patch."

Espera algumas horas até parar de aparecer barata viva correndo. Dai joga todos os cadáveres fora, limpa e arruma tudo, e joga fora coisas que atraiam barata. O fim."

writing,fej5z9z,t1_feisz75,1579158265.0,"About fanfiction: I think it works best if its very much an Alternate Story fanfic that takes the story to different places, and explores concepts that weren't given much space in the main work. Or just a ""Same Universe, Different Place"" fanfic. Normal fanfic generally bores me.

For example, I'm in a TOTAL Dragonball Z mood (don't ask me why, don't know), so I've recently taken to reading fuckloads of DBZ fanfics. Current one I am reading is Future Trunks deciding to make his own ""Z Warriors"" in the Future Timeline so he won't have to bear the burden of protecting Earth alone. Author manages to:

- Create his own new cast of characters and integrate them with older ones seamlessly

- Work content from both DBZ and the DBZ movies. For example, a lot of stuff involves the Tree of Might movie, and even hilariously, the reason the Tree of Might movie is not canon is actually plot-relevant.

- Make the Future Timeline very different from the canon present.

- Explore new concepts which are rather cool and perfectly in-tune with the Dragonball universe. Like an entire world dedicated to arena fighting by slaves.

- Manages to make lots of enemies that by all rights would not challenge Future Trunks give him constant headaches, by being smart.

- Everything simply works with Dragonball Z


The thing I've written the most recently (not much, really) is for a ""Fallout in the Caribbean"" collaborative project and its an absolute blast. Its pretty much Fallout IN THE (NEW) AGE OF SAIL. No old factions or characters, just new ones. Its the same setting, but its being taken to totally different places. Its the kind of wacky setting where flintlocks and 18th wooden ships hang together with sonic pistols and underwater power armor, hive-minded brazilian super-soldier mutants fight mutant crocodiles in Florida swamps and the seas are awash with trade, piracy, slavery and privateering, all to the tune of Calypso music.

(btw all the research I've done for it is fantastic material for future writing projects. Never thought I would research about sailing ships for writing projects, or improvised weaponry)

So yeah if you're going to fanfic, PUSH IT to new weird directions. Otherwise you're just retreading what was done before, and that's BO-RING! The OG author would find that boring, do something weird yet interesting with it that still honours that universe."

writing,fej4b25,t1_feiow7d,1579156375.0,"Ah, don't even tell me about Watchmen. I mean we all like it, but its not like its 2020 and the super-hero has not been reconstructed like ten times since the eighties. Geez, have these people not read Kingdom Come? I thought this was the 20s not the 90s, did I time-travel?

Also have no idea whatwith the recent interest of doing more material in the Watchmen universe. Watchmen makes a good single-shot comic, sure, but as a universe its pretty boring and mundane. So there's, uh... one God-Like Guy and one super-genius. Aaaaaand that's it, everyone else is 100% boring and mundane and there's no superpowers.

Uh, can I get a Warlord HBO series instead, pretty please?

> But what we get when DC tries to follow up on this is stuff like Batman v. Superman, which is just dour and clunky.

I think the problem with Batman v Superman is the tone. I mean, it works fine as a Batman movie... but that's not a Batman movie, its a Batman Fights Superman Movie. So Batman is old and mean and cynical, got it... but Superman should have been the opposite, he should have been bright and happy and nice. Feels like they didn't let Henry Cavil shine with that part of the character - you know, the super-powerful guy who is immensely polite and picks cats out of trees with a smile on his face before flying up and away. Angsty Superman works fine for five minutes of deserved angst... but then he should and get shit done with a smile on his face.

Also BvS really suffers from that unnecessary third act which was like a badly-done version of Death of Superman and having to cover Wonder Woman. It should have just been Bats and Superman vs Lex, maybe another Batman villain alongside Lex - Joker/Lex team-ups are a classic. Hell, if they just wanted something powerful for Supes and Wondy to hit violently, I would say Bizarro would have fit far better, he IS a Lex creation after all.

I like Death of Superman, but you don't do the Death of Superman as a origin story movie for the League, you do that when Superman is already a big hero and there are lots of others, and people who can take up the mantle. Geez!"

Anyway, one of the planets we visit in this tale is a world full of small islands and rivers and swamps, and such. There's no great ocean, more like this immense mish-mash of water and land. 

If I remember right, that world had HRE-levels of political cohesion, with lots of smaller polities rather than one big polity, because the geography made larger state non-viable."
