This is a similar interaction to what terran players have with scans. Also Command Centers have three abilities, I don't see why a nexus could not have more than one, right now chronoboost is just a refresh ability that you always throw down.

I really don't think so, being pro-immigrant is fine and I support being pro-immigrant nationwide but that doesn't specifically solve the problems this city has. There are more than enough low-skilled workers in Detroit that want good, livable paying jobs. People need opportunities, companies bring opportunities.

Detroit needs to continue to fix it's education and entrepreneurship opportunities for people in the communities right now. The Detroit people needs to feel empowered themselves, and need investment, the need safe homes and good education.

You seem to be saying that bringing in immigrants from war-torn counties will just fix our problems.

>encourage the smaller scale immigrant entrepreneur that will stay in the community and help build it. 

This theory of the economy is just outdated and doesn't exist with the current structure of the economy around big business stores and food chains that undercut any ""smaller scale"" store you can think of. Detroit needs a Walmart and Meijer, and some other shopping centers that provide jobs and low cost goods. And Houston's problems were at a different time when the economy was much different, I don't think we can draw similar comparisons."

You need to macro really hard and get a lot of production going into the late/mid game.

Get cannons at your bases to defend against hellions. get 75~ probes mining.

Get blink and around 7 gateways to stop early BCs, he will probably only make a couple in the early game instead of going only BC. If he goes only BC stop making gateway units and start with the tempests, or you could try to jump in, snipe his tanks and kill his BCs. I can never get that to work because tanks are so good now. You can also place a shield battery in your main to help defend and not lose stalkers early game.

If they make a lot of tanks you need to make zealot/immortal/archon with storm. Immortals will help you snipe bases and storm will kill the workers trying to repair the buildings. You make the archons because you will have a lot of extra gas and they tank well.

By then he might be making only BC/thor, which means you want immortal/tempest/storm. You should just be able to beat him if you make him fall behind by staying active on the map.

Also you need storm if he starts making mass widow mine because that can just 1 shot your air army.

So, you have to react to whatever the mech terran is going, because mech terran has a lot of different styles that all work, and you are the one who has to play reactive. This is why you macro so hard and why it can be difficult.
