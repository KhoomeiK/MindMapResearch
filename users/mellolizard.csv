I will argue Luke hitting Vader on the shoulder wasn't a lucky shot but a good hit by Luke. However, Luke was still outmatched by Vader and he paid for it with his hand."

LoseitChallenges,fdc8nxe,t3_ejf7rf,1578269268.0,"Hello fellow bathtub ginners. 32/m 5'10"" at 230.  I've always struggled with my weight but this past year was wild.   Between losing my job, wife having a baby, starting my dream job I forgot to take of myself.  

My biggest struggle is watching what I eat because really food is so yummy.  With my past job going to the gym was a struggle because I use to travel a lot but now with my current job I no longer travel so hopefully I can maintain my workout routine.  Though with the baby at home I am still going to have to be disciplined with my time management.

Anyways I look forward with journeying with you all.  This should be both challenging and fun."

I get societal play a big role and extreme poverty can drive any sane person to the brink.  However multiple football players that committed suicide had CTE, Tyler Helinski for example.  

I am just wondering out loud whether CTE played *a* role not necessarily *the* role.  Even the article admits that there are usually multiple factors that lead to a suicide.  Gowdy's family situation compounded by CTE may ultimately led to his death."

politics,fcot03o,t1_fcofmec,1577840729.0,Superfund is a program within CERCLA that is used to fund contaminated sites that do not have a responsible party. Superfund doesnt mean the site is ultra contaminated just the site is contaminated and doesnt have someone to pay for the cleanup.  Military bases do have a responsible party and doesnt qualify for Superfund because the DOD foots the bill.
