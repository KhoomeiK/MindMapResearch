gifs,ff7vezk,t1_ff7rxza,1579659281.0,"the underlying problem with these fires is poor woodland management, in most places in the united states, fires are put out ASAP, this prevents the fires from clearing out the under growth, and it kills trees that otherwise would have been fine in such a fire. I live in the black hills, and since this entire mountain range is a huge tourist trap, and there are many towns nestled into the forests here, the forestry service goes around and manually clears out dead fall, and crowded trees, when there is a forest fire here it usually doesnt last long (last one i saw lasted a day before it was put out), the trees are still alive, and the forest recovers in less than a year, though if you go to the south west side of the blackhills you will see evidence of a very large hot fire, this area has been like that for decades at this point and im pretty sure this was a turning point in how this forest was managed. There are still charred trees, the forest hasnt really returned yet, and the whole place is covered in tall grass and sparce trees/ burned out trees."

blackmagicfuckery,ff6wxjb,t3_eru246,1579636577.0,"assuming this is real: I think this is the result of a few things, one would be capillary action in the wood, it also looks like the wood is soaked in the fluid up to where you are holding it, and the fluid you said you are using either out gases fairly quickly, or it evaporates quickly, and finally the warmth of your hand might lead to this.  First the fluid gets absorbed into the wood, and travels up the wood through capillary action this would create a fairly airtight space in the wood, then the heat from your hand increases the heat of the wood, this evaporates some of the liquid, pushes some of the liquid from the tip out, and then more liquid goes into the channel once everything cools back down again, until you run out of liquid on the tip and you have to dip the tip back in the pool of liquid.  
But this is just a guess. If there is some trickery involved i would guess some sort of small needle and a syringe of air on the side we cant see is blowing little droplets of the tip of the stick and is attached on the side we cant see."

nononono,feee3jz,t1_fedzr8o,1579031862.0,"i cant reach my toes usually when i get leg cramp because i cant fully extend my leg, the reason i have to bend my knee is to sort of situate my fist in between the bottom of my thighs and my calf muscles, because on my own i dont have enough leverage to massage deep inside the balled up muscle, which is an alternate way to relieve cramped muscles, you sort of have to go slow though because if you go too fast it will just re-cramp. if i were able to get my self to a wall i could probably do calf stretches there, but i usually cant support weight on that leg, so it can be hard to get to a suitable wall for this."
nononono,fedrbvf,t1_fedan6m,1579018220.0,"it can also be because of electrolyte imbalances, in order to understand muscle cramps you need to understand how your mucsles expand and contract, to contract your body sends a signal to your muscles to start pulling in calcium and sodium ions present in your body, they do some chemistry in your cells and the muscle cell contracts, then when you want to relax that muscle your cells start pulling potassium ions, these sort of force the calcium ions and the sodium ions to leave the cell to maintain an isotonic solution gradient from the inside of the cells to the outside of the cells (this means there is an equal amount of ions in the cell as there are outside) the potassium does some further chemistry and the muscle contracts.  
When you get a cramp what ends up happening is you dont have enough potassium present around the muscle cells, when your body goes to relax the muscle it cant because there isnt enough potassium to push the sodium and the calcium out of the muscle cells.  
This describes the mechanism behind muscle cramps, but it doesn't really describe the trigger for morning or night cramps, this is mostly speculation on my part but i think something about how your body wakes up how it goes from sleep to wakefulness. When you are asleep your body is more or less paralyzed the signals from your brain dont really reach your muscles because this is a safety system your body developed so you dont hurt your self, but what i think happens when you wake or you go from a deep sleep to a very light sleep is after a certain point in order to test if you are paralyzed anymore your body tenses every muscle in your body very slightly this sets off the whole reaction and you get a cramp."

I know the feeling because every once in a while i wake up to one of my calf muscles cramping up, it is excruciating, and there is only one real way for it to stop, and that is to bend my leg with all of my weight and then take the knuckles of my closest hand and dig them into the cramped muscle."
