Pomodoro technique interspersed with meditation makes coding less error prone. Git commits help to re-hash progress. I don't think you understood the comment."
productivity,fdqpea8,t1_fdpnrq7,1578672012.0,"Detail git commits give you a solid record of all the changes made in each commit AND help you to re-hash your progress during a pomodoro/focus-time session. It's a great way to track your rate of progress and set realistic expectations, and sometimes feel super accomplished if you got a lot done quickly and efficiently."

Probably wise, better to be general and accessible. 
Being disciplined about the breaks is probably the best thing about Pomodoro. It's so easy to slowly breath less and less the longer you stay at a task, and the mental fog/confusion just gets greater and greater.
In coding, and probably other tasks, this leads to fucking a lot of things up and having to revisit them later. It's a major pain point that can be avoided with diligent breaks."
productivity,fdpetmg,t3_emeiqg,1578626795.0,"Well articulated, this definitely works. I do it pomodoro style - 45m meditation to get clear on the larger picture accomplishment for the day - usually a visual on the way I want a GUI to look, or a visualization.  50m on task1 , 10m meditation on next task, 50m on task2 (for a total of 4-5 50m sessions). It works for any task but it especially makes coding a lot easier, more focused, and less error prone - that's for sure. Highly recommend.   
Writing detailed git commits is then a great way to re-hash progress and assess what's feasible (or potentially not feasible) to finish by the end of the day and adjust expectations accordingly."

> What's something hard you challenge yourself to do everyday? 

Physical challenge - HIIT runs, it's very difficult to keep a good pace after pushing yourself as hard as you can multiple times  
Mental challenge - staying focused for at least 4hrs a day on technical deep work. New technical hurdles to overcome and skills to learn come up regularly.  
Emotional challenge - being grateful O\_o .. Difficult on some days"

I think the issue more so revolves around your perception of it. Have you tried simply witnessing your productivity and focus throughout the day and trying to time your ""deep work"" when you have the most clarity and focus?   
Here's a short to-do list of how you might go about achieving more by reducing your resistance to what is:  
1. Stop, take a couple deep breaths, drop all expectations.  
2. Just watch your breath and feel anything and everything there is to feel.  
3. When your mindset has shifted from **doing to witnessing**, go on with your day.  
4. Try pomodoro technique - set aside 25-55m for a work session that has a very specific intended outcome but stop when you reach the end of the session.  
5. During the break, release what you were working on and just make a mental note of your mental clarity about what you are doing, the emotional tone, your overall attitude, and your general sense of self-efficacy.   
6. Repeat and observe.  
7. At the end of the day, look back on all your mental notes (write them down with timestamps if need be) and assess:  
 \- when did you feel most clear about your intention, when did that start to fade, when did you feel objectiveless  
 \- when did you feel most emotionally settled, when did you feel emotional turbulence (resistance, judgment, etc), when did you feel accomplished, satisfied etc?  
 \- when was your attitude the most conducive to your goals, when was it least conducive to your goals?  
 \- when was your self-efficacy on the up trend? When did it peak? When was it on the downtrend?  
8. **Accept what you observe**

9. After reviewing your day, consider how you might plan specific types of tasks to suit the natural flow of these events throughout the day.  
 Consider the different types of things that can be done in a day:  
 \- Creative output - production/ deep work (whatever your primary task is)  
 \- Learning / skill acquisition  
 \- Physical activity  
 \- Leisure time / passive or semi-relevant reading  
 \- Socializing/relationships  
Based on the 4 parameters you observed at regular intervals during the morning/day/evening, when would each of these activities fit into your day harmoniously to create an overall sense of peace and productiveness?
