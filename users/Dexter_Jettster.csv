homeless,feff0ea,t3_eotqu8,1579054930.0,"No shit.  I was homeless for a while, female here, lived in my car, still did Uber/Lyft for work.  I even have mental health issues and did at the time, and I busted my ass to just keep going.  Having my car was definitely a benefit, and as well, it was paid off, so not having to deal with a car payment was nice, otherwise Uber/Lyft would barely cut it.  Just having to pay my car insurance and cell phone bill, on top of eating, gas and whatever other essentials, I was barely surviving that way.

Something to also to be looked at is how single, and alone, females, like myself, deal with being pursued by men just assuming that we're looking for something.  There are many men that will see women and attempt to prey on them.  I chased some asshole down the parking lot of a Walmart one night, with a fucking ball--point pen, screaming that I was going to kill him.  He wouldn't leave me alone, and I just went crazy on his ass, which is what I have read to do when you want to scare someone, just go total psycho, and it worked.  The last thing I yelled to him as we got near the Walmart store, itself, I quit running and yelled at him again, ""I'll fucking kill you, believe me????"", he yelled back, ""yes!""  He wouldn't leave me alone, and at the same time, why did I even have to do that?  And that wasn't the first time, that was just the worst one, and I had to act like a fucking psycho, he could have just as well had a gun and killed me.
