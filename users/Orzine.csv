DnD,fezv1vt,t1_fexxj9z,1579462027.0,"I’m trying to think is something that would match the milky green stone. To me the stone could represent vision or blindness.

Darkvision could be nice, make it so you only need a sip so the whole party can share. No torches for dungeon.

Invisibility could work too. I like normal invisibility for potions as they’re more utility than a damage boost. Pass without trace also fit this theme."

If we’re going to lose dev support soon the last thing to come should be something the hardline players are going to want to do over and over again until the next game. Having hard enemies that get closer to impossible with less people sounds like the challenge monster hunter drew me to."
