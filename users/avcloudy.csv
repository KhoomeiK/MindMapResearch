But it's not on the same level as actual allergies. You die from that shit. You get annoyed when people pretend to have them. It's not the goddamned same, it's not even close.

And, the reason why people pretend to have allergies like gluten is that people lose their goddamned minds if you don't want to eat something. No, not everyone, maybe not you, but a polite refusal just gets ignored. People sneak shit into your food because they can't believe you really have an issue with it. If you think it's annoying that your brother-in-law Bill won't eat gluten, imagine how annoying it must be for him that he has this preference and everybody's first response is to try and disregard his boundaries and convince/trick him into eating gluten.

It's not that nobody sits down and thinks about it, it's that the way things 'really work' is so far from how we intuitively understand things as to be nearly useless. The best way to describe how QM really works is to shut up and calculate.

I recognise the irony of telling you this, but it just looks more and more true. Philosophy of quantum mechanics isn't useful or an easy shortcut to understanding. It doesn't make any useful predictions, and any gains you might make in conceptual understanding are underwritten by the fact that many of those gains are just plain wrong.

I'm sure a lot of physicists are vaguely uneasy by the lack of convenient hooks in the theory for our brains to grab on to, and so they get a little bit defensive when people come in and say 'but actually, we don't understand anything about it except some maths', but, well, it's not as important as the practical side, and nobody has any good answers anyway."

This is in the film, I thought. The Trade Federation has a seat on the Senate, and it's been captured by special interests like them. The Senate is not so corrupt as to deny Naboo aid, but they are hamstrung enough that allies of the Trade Federation can drag it out long enough for them to force the Queen into signing a treaty that will make the occupation legal."
AmItheAsshole,fdjqixd,t1_fdjpehj,1578483595.0,"I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to say the op was doing something sensible, just that I get why he was doing this stupid fucked up thing, in the same way that I get why people drive drunk (but they shouldn't). People are worried he's trying to stealth, but even if he wasn't he's increasing the chance of std infection and pregnancy. Anything that causes more movement and friction is likely to cause problems. I think this is basically a form of stealthing in itself (or like, deliberately poking holes in a condom).

I'm not trying to rant about how men are getting the short end of the stick because it's so unfair, either, but complaining that men don't want to use them without trying to understand why kind of sucks. It's kind of like when men complain random women don't want to sleep with them with no understanding of what could possibly cause that."
AmItheAsshole,fdjp69j,t1_fdjepm6,1578481833.0,"I'm not justifying stealthing or giving people stds knowingly because that's fucked, but it's important to realise that a) men take a risk too, men can get stds as well and b) the drawbacks of using a condom are less relevant to women. Like the guy in the op, using a too big condom, they feel tight and they reduce sensation and distort it. 

I think it's dishonest to say men 'just don't have to deal with the consequences' when women don't really have the kind of disincentive to using them men do."

Okay, but surely you must realise how personal a lot of Americans take exactly that right? There's a bit more of a disconnect in the government = the country = the people stuff, but specific parts of the government (like the constitution and the bill of rights) are so entrenched as to be culture.

This isn't (just) an asian thing. You can point out social issues anywhere and be told to 'go home'. People who don't have that strong attachment are often felt not to be real patriots by people who do."
