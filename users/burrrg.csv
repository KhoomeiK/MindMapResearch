Edit: did hold onto my bike so it didn't hit the pavement tho"
ReadyOrNotGame,ff8mkrg,t1_ff7j1nx,1579686010.0,That's cool as fuck damn.

EscapefromTarkov,ff3djkf,t1_fempj1d,1579538949.0,Same. My go to weapon and I love shotguns in general. I just love wiping geared players with the ap-20
EscapefromTarkov,fesn3xr,t1_fesmk3u,1579366991.0,I say Tarkov f*ed me. If English is not your native language I can understand.
EscapefromTarkov,fesmbrg,t1_feslu2v,1579366745.0,"Yeah I never said Tarkov f*ed up. I did, hence I wrote ""made a mistake""."
EscapefromTarkov,fesm6mb,t1_feslb14,1579366696.0,"No, I fucked up, Tarkov f*ed me. Gotta avoid Tarkov f*ing you. Hence the mistake"
todayilearned,femvecc,t1_femuhlg,1579270629.0,Removed all his trails but his own brother...
todayilearned,fejbhly,t1_fej4drg,1579165629.0,I must say that this article kinda simplifies it. Any active ventilation will give side effects after 1 or 2 days of ventilation. Your breathing muscles die off fairly quick if you don't use them. 15 hours might be safe but if someone needs to be kept in a coma for longer that would be a problem
todayilearned,fejbcij,t1_feja00u,1579165413.0,"Yeah this is the case for cardiac arrest etc. I don't know how this poison works, but if it just blocks your breathing I can imagine it would be the opposite"
overclocking,fejaktj,t1_fed0brw,1579164298.0,"Well, I restarted the game, no issues, overclocked again.. no issues lol. I guess it might have been patched or serversided issues with the game"
thenetherlands,fej4hlo,t1_fegh4um,1579156572.0,Zo gaat het nu op de huisartsenposten ook.. ze verwachten dat men non stop blijft bellen want ja die wachtrijen moeten korter worden. Meer werknemers ho maar dat kost geld
EscapefromTarkov,feg4u9t,t1_fdo8cxc,1579076978.0,Hey thanks for this tip! I now only get dips to 80-90 with an average of 100 on reserve! Amazing
news,fee8gr7,t1_fedrqtc,1579028558.0,So Iran already solved it?
EscapefromTarkov,fed5oan,t1_fecxqdi,1579000114.0,"I did this, it was amazing to not play Tarkov and suddenly return to a much better game with more content."
overclocking,fed1j0d,t1_fed0brw,1578994010.0,"Oh wow, I didn't even try this lol. Thanks will do and update after!"
overclocking,feczwsx,t1_fecwnje,1578991731.0,"Yeah I did, still the same issue, I even came back from dinner to see that the menu froze for like 5 minutes. No real issues noticed in game."
EscapefromTarkov,fect08k,t1_fecseog,1578983460.0,Ooo that's what he meant. Here I was thinking that his arm would get tired from nade spamming lol

EscapefromTarkov,fe4xtn5,t1_fdodg2e,1578863851.0,"Hey man, I sold the 2070 for about the same price as I got it, and bought the 2070s with a black friday deal for 50 euro extra lol"
simracing,fe2s7pj,t1_fe2j72d,1578842330.0,He never felt the need to upgrade it seems
EscapefromTarkov,fdps3i7,t1_fdppqp2,1578638334.0,"The train is how should I say it... About as long as the front side of OLI? And the width which is the real problem... You can just hide next to the door to the next wagon on both sides, it's about 3 players wide if you can visualize that. I'd say just hop on it as a player scav and find out!"
EscapefromTarkov,fdnri78,t1_fdngsf8,1578591395.0,"I run it on samsung evo 850 ssd, I got late into a raid once 2 wipes ago I believe, connection issues. Friends had to wait for me. It seems to be different for people tho, some of my friends join a minute late with similar specs."
EscapefromTarkov,fdnr1bp,t1_fdnlhcs,1578591166.0,"Maybe I run the wrong settings? I have 100-120 in woods, customs labs interchange but reserve isn't too smooth for me... [https://i.imgur.com/lA5hVa7.png](https://i.imgur.com/lA5hVa7.png)

Edit: another important note, I upgraded from 2070 to the super version, the game didn't run much better, one of the big optimization patches did that for me."
EscapefromTarkov,fdnqxqw,t1_fdnfi9b,1578591118.0,Here are my settings: [https://i.imgur.com/lA5hVa7.png](https://i.imgur.com/lA5hVa7.png)

EscapefromTarkov,fdnhkiu,t1_fdnfi9b,1578585958.0,"Will edit this once I get home with my settings, I have a Asus strix 2070 super + i7-8700

Edit: https://i.imgur.com/lA5hVa7.png"
EscapefromTarkov,fdn1yfx,t1_fdn1uq7,1578574831.0,Yeah definitely. I had to tweak my settings a lot to get more than 60 fps in reserve. Still get drops to 40-50
EscapefromTarkov,fdn1eou,t1_fdn10nu,1578574325.0,"I would highly suggest them. Start reserve with pistol runs or scav runs. I don't find the map intimidating at all. Lot's of snipers tho so never walk free in the open. Just imagine that anytime you are in the open, someone has you in his crosshair.

Labs is a different vibe. Close quarter battles map, heavy armored raiders all over the place. It feels like a horror game to me there."
gaming,fdmzpxz,t1_fdmzd8s,1578572676.0,"Same with tarkov yeah, double tap R (reload) to just eject the mag and smash a new one in it. The more reloads you do the more skilled your character gets at reloading (faster and smoother)"
dankmemes,fdmwzyz,t1_fdmtosi,1578569632.0,Big brain
nottheonion,fdmtsm0,t1_fdmiz0k,1578565432.0,Or.. maybe she wants money especially now that dad is out of the picture.
EscapefromTarkov,fdmqzht,t1_fdmo09t,1578561465.0,"That's why you don't follow your teammates like ducks, but communicate and clear rooms. One person goes in front maybe 2. They ""clear"" the area and hold position untill others are in position as well. A squad should play like 3 times as slow as a solo dude if executed properly"
EscapefromTarkov,fdkgjvt,t1_fdkbsp0,1578503410.0,"I am the player scav on reserve lol, I get into blind spots of pmcs fighting. Can't argue that, but in Tarkov you always have multiple angles to push someone. The one who is occupied fighting into one direction is the easiest to surprise. I know you mean it well but you can't deny that it's an easy way to kill even heavy geared guys, just gotta time it well. That's how the game works and I'm not saying to remove that, it's realistic.

Edit: That's the battle royale aspect of the game, it's free for all from everywhere. Not like CSGO or BF/COD where you have a general direction if enemies coming."
EscapefromTarkov,fdkbjde,t1_fdkabnr,1578500389.0,It's pretty hard to shoot into 3 directions simultaneously tho
EscapefromTarkov,fdkb90v,t1_fdk3cuk,1578500213.0,"That's where ya wrong, I spawn with high pen ammo with scav on the regular, I love it as I don't play much anymore but it feels dirty"
EscapefromTarkov,fdkaz2k,t1_fdk456b,1578500042.0,"True, i spawned with m700 with m61 crazy shit, absolutely wrecked the geared up level 40-50 players, I felt dirty"
EscapefromTarkov,fdkatbx,t1_fdjrmai,1578499944.0,Or a special player scav dogtag that is priced according to the gear the scav was spawned in with!

EscapefromTarkov,fdequnc,t1_f5ix8uk,1578344705.0,Mind sharing your settings? Getting 40 here with 2070 super while I have 120 in interchange
EscapefromTarkov,fdbc625,t1_fdb5yoq,1578255926.0,"True! Since this wipe I totally changed my style (haven't played this wipe untill this week lol), I just go in looking for action, going in for a fight even against people way above my gear. It makes the game so much more fun, instead of cowering bc of my gear in a corner for minutes."
EscapefromTarkov,fda5jg1,t1_fd9s3c1,1578241975.0,"Perhaps it's how it feels like to me, as getting in and out of prone is the thing I hate most about this game.. but yeah it should be no issue if you keep it in mind"
EscapefromTarkov,fd9j3i0,t1_fd9fn5d,1578234113.0,"No I mean, most people I notice die to it, as do I, but I kill about 40% of my enemies whilw they are busy looting. I don't think looting is an issue on itself, but the speed to get up etc"
EscapefromTarkov,fd8wu9d,t1_fd6j2jg,1578224622.0,"I'm afraid it will be like pubg.. super successful in audience and sales, but still not streamlined. That made me stop playing Pubg after 300 hours or something. I hate clunky animations in a game that has very short ttk."
EscapefromTarkov,fd8wa5j,t1_fd77gjz,1578224360.0,Reason why I don't play seriously anymore.. just rush in guns blazing and see what the God of War grants me; death or sweet loot.
EscapefromTarkov,fd8tpw1,t1_fd4oh6c,1578223307.0,"I'm guessing that a lot of players die during looting as I do myself (even if I have 200+ hours in the game and loot pretty quickly). Even then, the mechanics of the UI and movement need to improved. It feels like I'm playing an 80 yr old with arthritis when I try to get up or get down"
samsung,fbm0wcg,t1_fblzd9r,1576975363.0,Yeah so I read! Hope it gets better with updates but... Doubt (x)
