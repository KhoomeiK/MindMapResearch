dogs,fep2b03,t1_femzr3x,1579310546.0,thank you. Wish you and you dog health and luck :)
dogs,fep2428,t1_fen1jgn,1579310421.0,"Thank you. I agree. I thought we won this fight against the tumour after successful operation. And when she was home and eventhough she was making weird sounds, I did not totally expect that somehing like that could happen. I was really ready to take her to vet, when something would be wrong, but this was so fast that I did not even have a chance to do that. :("
dogs,feoz5oj,t1_fenmaue,1579308557.0,"Thank you. I am a little bit sad about it, because she might have lived a little bit longer without that operation (that tumour was bigger every day, so she would not definitely survive for long), but she might have lived for 2 more months for example... but she was a fighter, she did not give up on anything. Unfortunately, she wasnt able to win this fight after the operation."
dogs,femzcx3,t1_femxzxr,1579273451.0,"thank you :), its funny. We found out that she had that tumour when she was 12 y.o. But operation wasnt necessary back then. :)"
