fatlogic,fekszdr,t1_fekrgjr,1579206970.0,That makes this funnier tbh
fatlogic,feksg15,t1_fekp5lc,1579206649.0,"Same. I'll always tell people to ask whoever they like out, you never know if they'll be into you or not. Don't rule yourself out cause your fat and they're fit. But it's a little messed up to rule out fat people and only go for fit people if you are fat. That's where I was. Getting to the point where I wouldn't date me."
fatlogic,fek7pe6,t3_eplsn1,1579194343.0,"Oh no, you might have to be reminded that that super yummy cake you're making is 1000 calories a pop! But sure, you'll starve without it / if you cut it into smaller portions."
fatlogic,fehf008,t3_ep2rum,1579115177.0,"The love your body one is tough for me. I hate seeing people get down on themselves, and discourage actively hating your body/calling it disgusting and so on. But I never got more than obese. I  can see where it's more realistic to aim for body neutrality / actively work on what your issue is where possible / make peace with and not dwell on the unchangeable, depending on the situation.

Telling people in more extreme weight situations to love their bodies, when they're telling you plainly that they don't, is some creepy forced positivity."
fatlogic,fefullz,t1_fefpzrn,1579065700.0,"I was amazed when I first looked up what obese actually was. I think I had the same exaggerated mental image a lot of people have. It looked like just ordinary fat to me. I can kind of understand her denial, but only as a first reaction."

fatlogic,fdradrq,t1_fdqlws4,1578681614.0,"It's a mix of them trying to deal with their own, entirely different set of food and weight issues ( someone who is thin and stressed about a tiny bit of pudge on their lower belly still has no business applying their personal advice to obese people), women who trying to do the right thing and fell for the surface level SJW aspect of FA, and outright scam artists.

I think some of the scam artists half believe their bull. But not to where they'd stop the habits keeping them slim."
fatlogic,fdqz5iv,t3_ems7pb,1578677183.0,"I relaxed and just let the booze and sweets happen over Christmas, and the scale went up 3 pounds. It's hard to tell how much for real weight gain was happening, I was aware some of that may be bloating. Two pounds or so seemed in line with what I'd been eating. I didn't want to worry too much about a small fluctuation, but also didn't want it to be the start of more gain.

I'm back down to my lowest weight today! Back to figuring out this maintenance thing. Telling myself this can be the new normal with vacations and holidays from here on out."

Totes what living in peace looks like."
fatlogic,fdnt0oa,t1_fdnhcpn,1578592240.0,"It's painful watching my roommate get up to our third story appartment. Out of breath, needing a few moments to recover. She looks like she's at my highest weight, maybe right at the obese cutoff.  I can't help but think it's not just her weight- equally fat girls who workout more would have an easier time of it.

I really dislike the idea that stairs should be hard for your average adult."
fatlogic,fdnokl2,t1_fdn36e2,1578589996.0,"I suspect NEAT has gone down significantly too. There are so many little daily things that take less physical activity now, in addition to all the time spent playing video games/ online/ on our phones.

As opposed to this hypothetical scenario where one could solve the long hair issue by just cutting it? Within seconds? For free even, with very little effort, if style isn't an issue. Exactly like losing fat!!!"
fatlogic,fdha0xo,t1_fdh7xj4,1578418607.0,It was so comforting when I did research what effects your calorie needs. It all seems obvious now. Smaller bodies need fewer calories *forehead smack*
fatlogic,fdgwk72,t3_el8kky,1578410097.0,"I've been surrounded by FA noise for the past ten+ years. I've heard it all. Some of the myths and fears started to get to me despite me knowing better. Fuck your alternative science and concern trolling.


 It's why this reddit is a welcome release valve."
fatlogic,fdeiz69,t1_fdecdvz,1578340032.0,"Congrats on the 100 pound weight loss! And the kiddos <3 

The message that anything less than staying at your goal weight forever effortlessly = weight loss is doomed to failure bugs me so much."
fatlogic,fdeb09d,t1_fdczi4o,1578335088.0,"You need enablers to get that large though, don't you? You may be on the poorer side of things and feel helpless about your propects/ be dependent on someone else's income.

A wealthier person who could afford delivery and personal assistants to help them function at that size might have a greater ability to hide themselves from the rest of the world. 

Just random thoughts. Now I'm curious too."
fatlogic,fde6g84,t3_eku29n,1578332217.0,"Even if you get in a good groove with maintenance, it's always possible that life will throw you off. New job, an injury, death in the family, whatever. You're not a bad, weak-willed person if you gain weight again. It's okay if health takes a backseat for a little while. But the only person who is going to get you back on track is you."
fatlogic,fddtp4n,t3_ekn7m2,1578323720.0,"While I'm flashing the gym my hairy pits, sure. Go back to your makeup tutorials.

fatlogic,fd3i3hu,t3_ejncnr,1578158499.0,"I would be 200 pounds or over if I never went through any weight loss stints. Do they ever stop to think these weight loss 'failures' have maybe just prevented themselves from being as far along with weight gain as they could have been?

Every 5 or 10 years so far, I've put in the effort to knock my weight down. So far, my tendency is to put on a few pounds each year if I'm not paying attention. Then I had one or two weight bombs that came from job / life changes. I'm resolving to stay in a tighter weight range from now on, instead of going back to not paying attention when I've reached my goal weight."
fatlogic,fczmpef,t3_ejn57h,1578104590.0,Friend probably has a better claim on the word 'thicc' if she's just a little overweight and carrying it well.

Later on get called 'naturally thin'."
fatlogic,fcy4lx9,t3_ejgni9,1578074688.0,"My FA friends are going hard against the new years resolution messaging. They go on so much about not having to feel guilty around food, not punishing yourself through exercise... I kind of get where they get these slants on food and working out from, but dude. If feelings of guilt and punishment are seriously weighing (har) on you, that's a food relationship issue you should be working on. 

It's just food. It's just physical activity. Both do predictable things to your body. It doesn't have to be so emotionally loaded."

fatlogic,fcug88w,t3_eiy3y2,1577980214.0,This is such a defeatist way of acknowledging the role mental health plays in obesity. Address your physical and mental health issues? No! Getting better is impossible!
fatlogic,fcufyzi,t1_fcubar9,1577980038.0,"Thank you! The actual social justice issue! The worse off you are, the more of an uphill battle fighting against the food industry's bull shit is going to be."
fatlogic,fcshboi,t1_fcses7f,1577916556.0,"Yeah, I'm happy I had my wakeup call before I got bigger than a size 16. A bottom heavy size 16, I didn't go beyond a large for shirts."

Part of me keeps trying to make that argument."
fatlogic,fcod79o,t1_fco7nhh,1577829365.0,"Bring it back around to the ones who said they wanted to lose weight? Beauty shouldn't come into it. If someone calls themselves ugly, reassure them that they're not. But otherwise focus on the specific weight concerns. Do they not want to keep gaining weight / feel held back in some way / feel unhealthy?"
fatlogic,fcnmlx7,t1_fcnhy9j,1577814367.0,"CICO is simple, but finding ways to make it work for any given person can seem complicated at first. I learned to out wait hunger, but also find foods that were more satiating. Researching nutrition, undoing old food habits and developing new habits took some work and trial and error. But I now enjoy what I eat, haven't felt that 'OMG HUNGER MUST EAT NOW' feeling in almost a year, and all around feel better eating nutritious food.

Knowing that it's CICO making weightloss actually happen was always helpful though. Nothing mysterious."
fatlogic,fcnccmj,t3_ei0j84,1577808648.0,"Eh, I'm fine with those photos. They're humblebrags, sure, but still reminders that trying to get rid of every last imperfection is a fool's journey / everyone has some part of them that they're insecure about. It's helpful to women on the thinner side that are still freaked out over whether they should be five pounds lighter. It's easy to roll your eyes at that, but I've got thin friends that have to talk themselves out of body hatred. Girl, you have defined abs. Chill about your stomach folds when you sit."
fatlogic,fcivat2,t3_eh89po,1577670670.0,"There isn't a damn thing I'm eating that I don't enjoy. Unless you're seriously hard up, you have the ability to pick things that are healthy, calorie appropriate, and tasty. And if I eat something tasty that makes me feel like crap after, that takes away from the overall pleasure."
fatlogic,fc6txds,t1_fc65k99,1577489403.0,"No one commented on my weightloss till the very end of my last Christmas party, when one person complimented me on it. Then there were a flood of other comments from a bunch of other people. It was like they were waiting for permission, or a go ahead. It's often better to err on the side of not talking about people's bodies for general politeness sake."
fatlogic,fc2ts04,t3_efsm11,1577373816.0,"It's unrealistic to think that your goal weight will be effortless to maintain in the same environment that made you fat in the first place. You can try to build habits that will make it easier, but regain is always a possibility. Try to get on it when you're up 5 pounds instead of 50 pounds. 

I hate how they're so gloom and doom with long term weight maintenance. Going back into a calorie deficit every so often as needed isn't torture."
fatlogic,fbapkx1,t3_ecdzcl,1576683944.0,"My hips came in at around 17, so yeah those 16 year old jeans are a thing of the past. I'm thinner than 18 year old me though. 

I think you do need the right bone structure for a size 0?"
