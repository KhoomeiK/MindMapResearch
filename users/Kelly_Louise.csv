What we did didn’t matter to me much. Who pays for what, I don’t care (Until he starts mooching off me). I was fine with watching movies and drinking beer, I usually enjoyed those dates more than the traditional dinner date because it was a lot more casual."

relationship_advice,ff8wd04,t1_ff8va37,1579698271.0,"Haha most of my college dates consisted of watching Netflix and drinking cheap beer. But when I did get asked out to dinner or drinks, I just always offered to split the bill because I thought it is only fair. I thought that was the dating norm these days. And usually I was the one being asked out so I didn’t have a choice in venue. But I always had money set aside for myself to have fun. And like I said I always offered to split the bill."
relationship_advice,ff8vzur,t1_ff7ynej,1579697943.0,"When I was dating I used to always offer to split the bill (I’m a woman) because we were in college and everyone was poor. I really thought that was the norm these days, I’m surprised by some of the comments here. When I had a guy actually offer to pay for both our meals I was very surprised. But it didn’t really effect the way I felt about him romantically. 

But I’ve also had guys take advantage of my financial situation. I was poor, but I wasn’t flat broke. I was good at budgeting, unlike many of my peers so I almost always had a little extra set aside for having fun. I had a bf in college who totally took advantage of my money, always asking for me to pay for food, gas, booze, etc. he always said “I’ll get it next time” or “I’ll pay you back” but he never did. Wonder why that relationship didn’t work out lol."
relationship_advice,ff8u5br,t1_ff8ldsw,1579696177.0,Or maybe they’re in college and super broke? Most dates I went on in college we paid for our own meals or took turns paying because we understood we were both broke af.

One was from Brazil, from a pretty modest family, they weren’t rich or anything. But I guess mom did everything, and that was just the way it was. The other was from Sweden, from a more well off family who had a housekeeper. I found it really interesting that they both had very different backgrounds, but the one thing they had in common was they never had to do chores growing up. That changed immediately at my house, my dad wouldn’t put up with it lol. Doing your daily chores was a big deal in my household."

Fast forward 7 years to now, and I’m 29 and 140 lbs. I’m not obese, but I definitely don’t look like I used to, and I don’t turn heads anymore that’s for sure haha.

Every time I take my shirt off he acts like it’s the first time he’s seen me naked haha it’s cute af. If he looks at other women, I don’t see it.

I was like a size 0-1 for a long time. weighed like 115 lbs.  I could eat anything and never gained weight, maybe a lb or 2 here and there. then I graduated from college and started dating my now fiance. suddenly, I started gaining weight. it kinda snuck up on me...fast forward 7 years and I weigh 140 lbs and am a size 8-10. probably because I never changed my eating habits. I know that isn't that fat.  but to me, I am fat.  now, my fiance still finds me extremely attractive, he tells me every day how beautiful I am, can't keep his hands off me. He thinks I'm crazy that I think I'm fat.  But I don't see it. I'm constantly comparing myself to my past self, I liked myself so much better when I was skinny.  Now I have a subtle double chin that I HATE and my belly hangs over my pants/underwear. I HATE it. I don't wear bikinis anymore.  I haven't even had a child yet! I should be able to lose this extra weight. I have started slowly exercising, so far just walking every day. I haven't lost a single lb and its been 4 months. I know I need to do more but ugh why can't I just do nothing like I used and look super hot?? why does it have to take so much effort?? I hate it. I hate getting older."

AskReddit,fe3loy1,t3_enjzki,1578850443.0,"I’ve never told anyone this except for my little brother.

When I was very young (must have been 4 or 5 since my brother was in my dream) I had a dream that my brother and I were playing in my moms car, like in the back part of the station wagon. It was dusk, like right as the sun is setting. And suddenly I looked up there was a lion walking down my driveway on two legs and playing the drums (???). My driveway was very long, almost a quarter mile. I remember trying to scream out for my mom in my dream. I could see her through the glass front door of our house washing dishes wearing yellow rubber gloves (never in my life has my mom ever worn rubber gloves to wash dishes lol). She didn’t hear me. I couldn’t move. The lion was getting closer and closer. My brother didn’t seem to notice. Right before the lion got to where the car was, I woke up. 

That dream has stuck with to this day. I remember all the little details. I’m almost 29 years old. I don’t know why it was so scary to me. Probably because I couldn’t move or cry out to my mom. Or maybe because any 4 year old would definitely find a lion playing the drums on 2 legs scary and creepy lol."

If I started blowing my bf while he was sleeping and he woke up and told me to “stop” (which he has before) I would stop. Gender doesn’t matter. No means no."
depression,fdpxrd6,t3_emmfkf,1578645031.0,"For me it’s just a constant tired feeling. Tired of trying. Tired of doing basic tasks. I could/would sleep for 12-15 hours a day in my deepest waves of depression. Like others have said, nothing feels enjoyable and that makes me feel even more tired of life. Like I have to try extra hard to have fun. What’s the point?

I also pull away and isolate myself from people. They’ll ask me how I am doing and for a split second I consider actually telling them, but then I feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the thought of explaining it so I end up just saying I’m fine or I’m great. This causes me to avoid talking to anyone so I don’t have to explain myself. And then I feel guilty for essentially lying. On top of that, people tend to irritate me and annoy me more when I’m depressed. I’ll sometimes have explosive feelings of anger or frustration with people for them just being human. Idk it’s hard to explain. 

I tend to come off to most people as happy and even bubbly, but I just put on that mask so they won’t worry about me and so I seem “normal”. My fiancé is the only one who truly sees what I go through. I know it’s extremely hard for him to understand, and I often still try to pretend like nothings wrong. But he always can tell. He’s very supportive but I can see that he gets frustrated when I isolate myself and shut down. I’ve learned I need to just tell him “My depression has been getting the best of me lately and I’m sorry”. That way he can at least know why I’m acting weird or sad. I can see how it can be very frustrating to watch depression from the other side, especially if you love them very much."

I don’t even like hanging out with friends most of the time, except my fiancé...and sometimes I can’t even stand being around him, although I’d never tell him this! I also get super annoyed and impatient with strangers and crowds, especially in the grocery store. This irritation only seems to get worse and worse as I get older. 

I also relate to what you said about empathizing with animals and your parents, so much that it’s overwhelming. Last year I went through a period of intense homesickness, which now that I look back is probably what has sent me into this spiral of depression for the past year...I cried almost every day thinking about my parents and my childhood, getting so nostalgic it was unhealthy. It was almost like I was grieving for my past/childhood. I’ve finally started to get a little bit better in the past month or two. I don’t feel the same pangs of nostalgia day in and day out at least. But I still have a hard time feeling/showing affection for people. I always just push them away instead."

I am feel anxious because I am supposed to be planning our wedding that is supposed to be in August but it’s sooo overwhelming.

depression,fd3dyyl,t3_ejyd1z,1578157382.0,"Definitely. I went thru a period last year of basically feeling numb because of my depression (still kinda fighting my way out of it). I didn’t feel anything for anyone or anything. No passion or love for anything. I also have an amazing fiancé who I love. But our relationship suffered a lot last year because of me distancing myself and basically just going through the motions of our life. My sex drive was basically gone. I am not good at showing affection at all. I had no hobbies or interests, I was (maybe still am) boring. I often feel so bad for him, like he doesn’t deserve me to be so dismissive and distant from him. I often feel like he would be happier with someone else, someone who is actually loving and affectionate like he is. But I also I don’t know what I would do without him. He is my rock, my one constant in life that I know I can count on no matter what. I know he will love me no matter what."

Only reason i say this is because I was raped at an annual party I had every year in college. The next year I was determined to still have the party because I was pretending the rape never happened. Rape does weird things to your brain. You make irrational decisions to try to make yourself forget about it.

He would get so nervous he couldn’t stay hard. The amount of booze he drank probably didn’t help either. But I really liked him so I was patient and we would still fool around.

You could try doing that for a bit and then when you are a little more confident try going to the gym. Or you could get an online subscription to a workout app like dailyburn."
