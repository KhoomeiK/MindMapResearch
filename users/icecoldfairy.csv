FragileWhiteRedditor,fet0ecj,t3_eqehb1,1579370671.0,I literally had a group of guys follow me around to repeatedly kill me in RDR1 because I was playing a female character. Had to leave the game because I couldn't do anything without being killed. I don't really play online anymore.
AskMen,feq47bx,t1_fep8qvd,1579337481.0,Yeah I'm pretty into androgynous looking guys but my male friends aren't into it at all.
AskMen,feq3ypc,t1_feprxqz,1579337361.0,It's an interesting one. Henry Cavill is very classically handsome but I'm not very attracted to him. As Geralt in The Witcher though he is a straight 10/10.

If they wanted to go completely in you could choose from different paths/professions - Pokemon trainer, breeder, researcher, photographer, performer, etc.

unpopularopinion,femeczy,t1_felzqly,1579251120.0,"So people can't play a character that is a different nationality from themselves? You can't even tell that Yen's actress is part Indian without googling it. She's definitely white passing. 

I was a bit taken aback with Triss too but I'm keeping an open mind because the actress is doing a good job.

Trying having an open mind sometime."

aww,fdprd8a,t1_fdpqffh,1578637575.0,It's a method to reduce stress. Kangaroos are very stressy animals and this makes them feel secure and much less vulnerable than they would otherwise. It helps with raising and recovery.
aww,fdpr8g9,t1_fdpq7tm,1578637437.0,"Yes it's called embryonic diapause and allows kangaroos to ""pause"" a pregnancy if there is a lack of resources and restart again at a more convenient time. A lot of marsupials can actually do this but it is a better known characteristic of the kangaroo family. Very interesting."

AskReddit,fdhmof2,t1_fdgy83f,1578425895.0,"When I was a kid we would always get a pine tree from a tree farm and set it up in our lounge room (it was full of small black spiders once which then proceeded to run over the whole ceiling, that was a fun Christmas). We would decorate the tree and the house - usually just my sister and I. 

Wake up Christmas Day and open our presents, then we would go to my grandma's house for a big lunch, or my cousins house for a big lunch. Seafood, especially prawns, was always a big part of this.

Dinner was usually leftovers and we would head to the beach and spend the day there for Boxing Day. 

My boyfriend's family have a park picnic every year.

As far as decorations and stuff go we get a lot of winter Christmas stuff with snow and holly  but there is also the Aussie Santa surfing in thongs and boardshorts - I always found this kind of tacky though as I prefer the more traditional (Northern Hemisphere) stuff.

pokemon,fdbcww5,t1_fdat44c,1578256147.0,"That's fair, I just finished Shield last night and had a great time with it. I think that draw distance for Pokemon does need to be improved and they definitely need to add difficulty levels to allow people a more challenging and less hand holdy experience. Skippable cut scenes would go a long way as well, and bringing back random wild encounters with legendaries. 

I wish Game Freak would be more innovative and bring something revolutionary to the table, but I'm still enjoying the series as is."
pokemon,fd8figu,t1_fd4w8rm,1578217795.0,"I honestly think people have too much nostalgia for old Pokemon games. IMO the series hasn't declined in quality like people are saying and I still enjoy every game that comes out.

Im not saying that i always agree with Gamefreak's decisions, but as far as im concerned it's not trash if I'm really engaged and enjoying it."

They're angry. Obviously remaining cool and objective is important to solve problems, however that first girl was pretty calm and was asking reasonable questions and he literally turned his back and walked away.

The government needs to find a solution to help these poor people, they're hardly the problem."

worldnews,fcwhwrw,t1_fcwch14,1578026067.0,Be present in the situation. Listen actively to people's concerns. Pass some kind of emergency bill to increase funding or resources for the fire service. Release packages to financially support people who have lost their homes. Donate some of his own money to disaster relief seeing he has so much of it. Release a media statement about the people who have lost their lives in this emergency. Show one once of compassion to these people. There's a long list and it's not fucking hard.

-He took a vacation in the middle of a crisis and only came back when he received severe backlash.

-He decided to visit a bushfire ravished town with no aid, plan or policy to help with bushfire mitigation, forced people to shake his hand instead of respecting them telling him no and literally turned his back and walked away without even showing a shed of human decency or compassion for their situation while they were asking him legitimate questions and asking for help. He has handled everything about this wrong."
sydney,fcwgvup,t1_fcvwa8n,1578025300.0,"And the correct response to this is to literally turn your back and walk away? As the leader of the country?

I wouldn't do that to anyone in the middle of talking to me  let alone one of my people begging me for help. Fuck him."

That I can't  try to reassure people or do anything at all to show that their suffering is meaningful and I feel for them? If he can't even do that he shouldn't be representing this country.

This is a bullshit cop out excuse, he literally turned his back on this woman after forcing a handshake on her. Disgusting, and you're disgusting for defending it."

AustralianPolitics,fcm9avl,t1_fcm85lw,1577767714.0,"It's the attitude and lack of care shown by our government. It's disgraceful. Even if we aren't contributing on a worldwide scale we still have some of the highest emissions per person in the entire world. As our population increases this will continue to contribute. 

During the Paris COP21 agreement most of the countries in the world made commitments to meet targets to stop climate change. Australia is barely doing anything and are performing worse than most other countries.

I just like being a world leader. I like feeling proud of my country and setting an example. I'm just so disheartened and disappointed that we aren't doing anything meaningful or positive about climate targets, and are in fact building more coal mines to export dirty energy into those countries that are contributing a lot of emissions. It's poor policy and shows a lack of care or regard for our countries future and the world's future.

Just because other countries are doing the wrong thing doesn't give us a right to throw our hands up in the air and absolve ourselves of responsibility. It's short-sighted and close-minded."

My best advice would be picking out a sub series that sounds interesting to you and reading the first book of that series. I started with Mort and Going Postal  and thought they were a great introduction to the series."

Matthew Rielly is a good one if you like action (I especially recommend Ice Station).
The Strange And Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender is a great in between. I also believe Night Watch by Sergei Lukyanenko was pretty good."
