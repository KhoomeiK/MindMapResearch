AmItheAsshole,fe7evnb,t1_fe74udv,1578913652.0,"Damn I had no idea that white wedding dresses came from Queen Vic, thanks for the link! Really really interesting section in the article about [the dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress_of_Queen_Victoria), about when/where the purity stuff came from:

> Wearing white was quickly adopted by wealthy, fashionable brides. Less than a decade later, [*Godey's Lady's Book*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godey%27s_Lady%27s_Book) would incorrectly claim that white wedding gowns were an ancient custom reflecting a bride's virginity, writing ""Custom has decided, from the earliest ages, that white is the most fitting hue, whatever may be the material. It is an emblem of the purity and innocence of girlhood, and the unsullied heart she now yields to the chosen one"", even though white had been a distinctly uncommon choice for bridal gowns before Victoria's wedding and was not chosen by a majority of brides until decades later."

RealLifeShinies,fe2joed,t1_fe1yq35,1578839184.0,">This is a subreddit for images of things that are a different color than we are used to them being, and because of that they are ""rare"".

It's not meant to be literal shiny things - otherwise there'd just be, idk, photos of a roll of aluminium foil. All male golden pheasants look like that - it's not a different colour to normal. To give OP the benefit of the doubt, possibly they didn't realise that it isn't just some weird ""golden"" common pheasant, but a completely different genus (let alone species). The females of both all look drab so I can see why they might have thought it was just bog standard common pheasants."
onejob,fdl9vf9,t3_elusi6,1578519528.0,"Have you considered that blindness isn't only ""seeing nothing whatsoever"", and legally blind people who may need to use the braille to read the sign may still be able to appreciate the warped mirror - even if what they see is blurry."
AmItheAsshole,fdjmnb6,t1_fdjgmud,1578478253.0,"Now I'm thinking we really need an informal, one-syllable word to use for adult women or age-unspecified people of the female persuasion in general. Because - and I'm not criticising you, you just got me thinking because this is a common usage - you see that ""girls"" has an inherent age component and ""guys"" does not, right? The true equivalent of ""girls"" would be ""boys"" - and I know that does get used, but not nearly as much. This is probably why a lot of younger people (I'm thinking 30s and younger, but I have no proper data; I'm mostly working off my own peers) use ""guys"" as a unisex term.

Gals, ladies and such don't really hit the mark. Hmm."
pokemongo,fdej9he,t1_fde4vai,1578340205.0,"You know that the type lures have a specific mon pool that they draw from, right? It's not just ""all the pokemon of a particular type"". I think there's a lot of posts about it on r/TheSilphRoad from when they were first introduced."
aww,fdbpols,t1_fdbl5vn,1578259902.0,"Oh yeah I'm not saying there's not numbers on the orange males' side! I'm mostly just saying I wouldn't call the numbers skewed far enough to say it was ""probably dad"" - even before considering that even if it was male, it's pretty unlikely to literally be the kitten's father. I mostly just find it odd when people imply that orange females are super rare, to the point of doubting a cat in a photo is one, when they're really not rare at all! Nobody says that about black cats, and they should have a similar numerical distribution."
aww,fda5nvf,t1_fd9opa9,1578242032.0,"Yes, I was talking about the genetics of it too! And was acknowledging that there will be more orange males than females. Either way, I'm not personally sure of the distribution, but if it *is* as even as 80-20 I wouldn't feel confident stating ""that's probably the dad"" especially in this post's kitten-related circumstances.

As a side note, the O gene is co-dominant rather than recessive, and there should mathematically be the same discrepancy in the number of pure black females compared to black males, but nobody ever says anything about that. I think there might be some confirmation bias in people's perception of the numbers. Certainly having voluteered in a rescue I have met plenty of orange female cats!"
aww,fd9g57t,t1_fd9f3ia,1578232929.0,"Not necessarily! There are plenty of orange female cats out there - it's just that female cats have a third option besides black and orange (black+orange, ie tortoiseshell), so the number of black OR orange female cats will be fewer than the corresponding number of black OR orange male cats, simply because they have a third option. In short there will be more orange males than orange females, but the numbers are not so skewed that anyone could accurately make a blind sex call!

(Obligatory note that tortoiseshell males are possible but since they're necessarily the product of chromosomal or somatic abnormalities - for example XXY (Kleinfelters) or chimerism - because the orange/black O/o gene is sex-linked, they're orders of magnitude rarer.)"
AskReddit,fcx17sp,t1_fcwijso,1578046662.0,"Definitely. Plus, the ends of untrimmed hairs are tapered, whereas trimmed hairs have that cut off and thus appear thicker because the whole length of them is more obvious. *Plus*, as someone else on this thread said, it allows the hairs that were shorter to ""catch up"" with the hairs that were longer."
nottheonion,fbj5elu,t1_fbj4aov,1576925159.0,"Oh definitely, the misinformation is rampant. But someone in a position of such power should really be researching this shit and staying current."
