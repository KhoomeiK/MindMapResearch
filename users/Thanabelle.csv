FundieSnark,ff86gfy,t3_erzyng,1579667326.0,I think all the girls are pretty until Jill ruins them and makes them do that skelator smile. I hope they break free but don't see much hope....

cats,few9zi5,t3_eqg0lz,1579407358.0,OMG! My brother used to have a tiny pair of handcuffs he'd put on our cat. Only when the cat was totally chill but it always cracked me up.

FundieSnark,fepedon,t3_eq2qvk,1579318426.0,"You are doing the right thing. At some point you have to protect not only your children but yourself. Stay strong, there are many of us dealing with similar situations, you can break away and have relationships with normal, older (grandparent types) for your kids."

cats,fe8hd2r,t3_entppo,1578926146.0,Happy birthday to Steve!
cats,fe6pkri,t1_fe4ov5q,1578899487.0,Lol! We have a completely open house with a loft and a beam across it.  One of my cats loves to barf while sitting on the beam! I think she's figured out I can't grab her and put her on a newspaper or paper towel if she's on the beam.
blackcats,fe6o46o,t3_enxwjl,1578897748.0,"I can't have houseplants. One of my kitties is fine with them the other chews, digs them out or knocks them over. I have one houseplant...the naughty kitty doesn't like to destroy it, silly boy tried to nibble a leaf right after I treated it with soap spray for spider mites (organic, non-toxic for animals). He has a serious aversion to my only plant!"

flowers,fdfsgvo,t3_el4hpv,1578369083.0,"I love their dahlias. Planted 22 3 years ago for my sons wedding. It was a bad spring/early summer for them, 2 weeks after the wedding they were in all their glory. Oh well."
DuggarsSnark,fdfs1hv,t1_fdepx65,1578368791.0,Never used them with my daughter but they don't seem to be as popular in the PNW.  I see more kids with real hats. My daughter had very little hair and one day mom said when I was little they would stick tiny bows on little girls with Karo syrup! You know we tried it just for fun. LMAO
cats,fddszcb,t3_eku2g1,1578323199.0,"Ah yes, the sexy look..."

aspergers,fdcs2iu,t3_ekl3sv,1578282689.0,"My daughter has 2, one is 16 lbs, the other 20lbs. She weighs in at about 130. Her anxiety level determines if it's a one weighted blanket or 2 weighted blanket night. She's always liked weight on her we just didn't realize it was so important until about 5 years ago. You can test the theory by sleeping under something heavy and decide if it's for you. Over heating is a thing too."

cats,fd5n8e9,t3_ejw6ot,1578179311.0,"My cats love the vet! One was rescued by the vet at about 1 week old, she would take the litter to work with her everyday so it was home until I got him at about 7-8 weeks. Sadly his litter mate that I adopted died (I  hate FIP!) And I adopted another kitten from a rescue group. She's sort of ""meh"" at the vet. Their only real complaint is when the thermometer is used! Lol"
FundieSnark,fd5m709,t3_ek1fa4,1578178979.0,"My mom was very conservative but I remember when she heard about people not holding hands, hugging or kissing before marriage (being a virgin was still important to her) and she told my daughter that she'd better at least kiss a guy to make sure he was a good kisser. Lol! My daughter still giggles at the memory. For the record,  my conservative, Christian mom was pro-choice and had a pure, loving heart."

cats,fczhgng,t1_fczgfwg,1578101343.0,"Awww, I would so hug you right now! No cat is ""just a cat"".  I still get teary over my first boy, Chester, and he's been gone 20 years."
cats,fczfmbd,t1_fcy05dj,1578100179.0,"No! You can't ever replace the place Harry holds in your heart, you're making new space for Murphy.  I felt the same when I lost my first and second cat, I did not want to ""replace them"" but I didn't, I just added my current two. I think Harry would be happy to know you've opened your heart and home to another."

DuggarsSnark,fcp523k,t3_ei06tp,1577850706.0,"I sort of have a love/hate thing with this podcast. Really like the deep dives, love the theme song but really can't stand when the sister is there and her maniacal laughing. Really, really can't stand when Kate eats, yawns and just makes rude sounds during the podcast. I know it's not ""professional  level "" but it never will be if she keeps that up. I kind of like Chris, he throws out some real zingers.  She does seem to defend the Duggars too. If you're going to make a podcast about snark then snark unapologetically!"

DuggarsSnark,fcoxvs8,t3_ei7sjx,1577844602.0,"I've had 2 children. My first was minutes away from a c-section (huge head and slow heart rate). My second was a piece of cake but I never considered a home birth. Both were years ago and if I was doing it now, if I was low risk, I would probably go the birthing center route. Granted I work at a hospital with our birthing center attached, md available but midwives do the majority of the births.  Tubs in room, very flexible birth plans BUT a surgery suite steps away if necessary. I don't understand why these women with the historys they have would risk it. Mother and baby mortality is a real thing in our country."
cats,fcoxbig,t3_ei7ums,1577844146.0,Congratulations! Wishing you many happy years.

FundieSnark,fcjcgw6,t1_fciznst,1577682965.0,"I just posted something similar. Not that I'm not doing my job but it's my job, not a movie production. My hospital is very serious about no images without consent."
FundieSnark,fcjbhtk,t3_ehde8k,1577682160.0,"I can't begin to express my outrage at this. Why would you take a video like this and post it? The hospital I work at won't let people video/take pictures without signed consent from every provider involved. I refuse, not because I don't do my job well but I don't want my image out there. Period.  Most providers decline. We will allow people to audio record so they understand the discharge directions."
blackcats,fcfiyd6,t3_eh5tq4,1577630499.0,No cats harmed but was the human harmed?
blackcats,fcfiqyy,t1_fcbm7dj,1577630431.0,My daughter had an entire flock of Firefly chickens. Book and River turned out to be roosters so they had to be rehomed.  I think my favorite was Cap'n Tight Feathers. Lol
