kansas,ffbb08j,t3_er7zzt,1579758027.0,">How are you?

Doing well! Thanks for asking!

>Are you actually back on track?

With the amount of damage Brownback has done, I don’t think state gov will ever get back on track. We still have a teapublican government with some pretty insane people in it. Right now they are seeking to undo the tax hikes and they are trying to shit all over Laura Kelley, by projecting the shit they caused as her fault.

I was a state employee during Brownback’s years and he did a number of permanent changes to the civil service system. Employee health insurance plans have also gotten considerably worse than when I first started. I think the copay to see a doctor is $45. It used to be $25. My premium when I started and left was about $9 per pay period or something insanely low. All the premium discounts are gone. I believe but I haven’t looked at the SEHP documents since I don’t work for state gov anymore.

There are also lasting effects, from what other people have posted, with increasing caseloads and being overworked. That will not go away. State employees always have to do more with less. The legislature acknowledges the problem but doesn’t want to do anything about it because that means spending more money.

>	Did it affect anyone’s relationship with the GOP?

I think the GOPers are currently in an identity crisis. Kobach would have been a continuation of Brownback. Actually, what I told people was that he would be someone if Trump had a brain. For the state to vote Laura Kelly, a democrat in, was really big. She didn’t even win by a small margin.

>	Tax deficit problems were overblown in the media, let me know that.

They were not overblown at all. It was really bad. The state was shuffling funds around, robbing funds from the DOT to make up for shortfalls. The cut to employee benefits was significant and at the time, I don’t think anyone had pay raises until after he left. It also was not fun getting a furlough notice while the legislature was battling the budget in 2015.

The tax cuts never did anything. Kansas had the lowest growth rate in the United States in 2015 I think, or at least one of the years the law was in effect.

It was so bad that the conservative legislature overrode Brownback’s veto of rolling back the tax cuts.

Expanding on the impact to state employees.... I’m single so I could make do, but for my coworkers who had families it was very hard. Well, it’s actually still very hard for them. They were all demotivated. Why do well if there are no raises to at least keep up with inflation? My ex coworker complained to me that it was a pay cut every year. I never thought about it like that but it’s true. The health plan cuts made it worse."

The truth is that all employees are disposable and that because one cog breaks or goes missing, doesn't mean the rest won't. 

Your coworkers will be fine but it is really up to the boss lady to decide how she wants the work environment to be. That shouldn't be your worry though.

Also remember to keep in touch with those peeps if you see each other as friends. I still keep in touch with my close ex coworkers

If your friend gets really mad, well, again just remember that she is in control of her emotions. Hopefully she won't be resentful."

I guess really you need to decide what you want to do. It sounds like you really want to go so... but do you really want to go that bad?

If yes: Is there a possibility to return the favor later down the road? Start putting some money away monthly, then maybe next year or in two, pay for theirs!

If you feel a bit guilty, maybe clarify your financial situation. Just to pay down debt NOT because you can't afford it.

If no: Thank them again and that you really appreciate their friendship but it's too big of a gift to accept. And that you'll have a good time next year, or whenever you decide to go next!"

jobs,felx7pj,t3_epuuq5,1579233211.0,"Leaving a situation is hard when you're upset with management but not the team. It feels like you're letting everyone down. Then you start to think about how much knowledge you're taking away with you.

But remember that in the end *you have to look out for yourself and do what's best for yourself*.

I know that sounds incredibly selfish but dealing with a stressful boss is a really bad situation. Especially when they are horrendously toxic. Keeping Mary and Bob happy will not change your situation.

Remember that as far as you're concerned, once you leave, *it's not your problem anymore.* Just remember to deflect any shit hurled at you from the shit manager and any attempts to shove work onto you from the manager or your two underlings.

Don't feel bad if you fear about causing her stress. *Boss lady did it to herself!.*

I don't really follow your situation with your friend. Did they apply for the job that you applied for, and for sure got? 

It really is best to keep it under wraps. Not only because of your manager but to not leak info early. How your friend reacts to the news is up to them. I've been passed over for promotions before and my friends have gotten them. I've felt no ill will.

You shouldn't hold yourself back due to fearing that you'll hurt someone's feelings. Besides, it's not just you or her who would have applied right? If you didn't apply for it, she may still not have gotten it."
