bestof,ffc24ma,t3_esq551,1579789626.0,"Well, they've publicly horded donations. Like rebuilding that city in Haiti after that massive quake only for it to never happen after collecting hundreds of millions. 

I'm sure the people that actually do the work are fine folks . Management, not so much."
todayilearned,ff1k9pw,t1_ff0q5eh,1579480537.0,I'm 44. I think I used Prodigy. I ran up a phone bill because it was long distance and go into trouble. I also remember running like a 50 foot cable from my modern in my bedroom to the jack in the kitchen .
videos,feyv5yr,t1_feype9t,1579450931.0,Puerto Rico might take handouts like a state but they also want to maintain some independence. Having the federal government come in and save the day would weaken those in power and maybe slip the country closer to statehood. That's why you can find a warehouse full of aid that never went anywhere.
tifu,fexqd90,t1_feuenw3,1579434670.0,"Yeah I had that problem when I was a teenager. Doctor said pretty much anything could cause this. Some people are born without the things that keeps this from happening.

As for me they caught it in time and I had emergency surgery where they permanently stitched something another. This was around 30 years ago. And OP isn't exaggerating about the pain. Worst I've ever had in my life. Like getting punched in the balls by 12 people and that pain never letting up."

pics,fejfc4h,t1_fejbkw7,1579171455.0,"The only tasteless part was her visual representation because she was acting like she couldn't think of what it's called. Reddit can't tell the difference between a rich, famous, good looking actor and the beloved character he played in Joker. If this was after the movie Signs it would have been a total non story here."
pics,fejey4a,t1_fejdrhu,1579170869.0,"Yeah, MJ just had a fucked up childhood that was nothing but abusive Joe Jackson pushing to make the kids stars. He never got to be a kid so as a rich adult he got to see normal kids being kids by hosting them. But of course people start wondering why someone like him was focused on kids so much and the rumor of him being a sexual predator started and never let up. And still survives till this day with people above me stating he was a sexual predator as a fact."
SandersForPresident,fegzdph,t3_eow81y,1579105894.0,Better off buying $27 worth of lottery tickets and have a better chance at winning.
news,fegb15j,t3_eow82n,1579085682.0,"Well, I mean the HOA has a point. If they allow the teen to stay they open themselves up to lawsuits from homeowners that won't like it. If I were the grandparents I would get each home to sign a petition to say they are okay and forfeit their ability to sue. Otherwise the HOA could be on the hook for doing a good deed."
AskReddit,feel29s,t1_fee06n1,1579035919.0,"All of my uncles on both sides of my family, 9 of them, worked in tire plants. Two different plants for two different brands but only 30 miles apart. High school was their highest education. They're all in their 70s now living off a fat pension comfortably. All of the wives were housewives. All raised multiple kids and put most of them through college. Lived in nice middle class homes. They spent their entire adult working life doing entry level-type work and were making bank towards the end. Those two plants closed down 20 years ago at like the same time.

I'm Gen X so I don't really shake my fist at Baby Boomers as much as Millenials but they really did have way more opportunities to make a nice living right out of high school that is pretty much impossible to duplicate these days."

technology,febtw7p,t3_eo6574,1578962641.0,"It's total speculation unlike the title suggests. Space X didn't make this statement, in case most don't read the article. It's someone guessing that if they continue sending up satellites at the current rate it could possibly be enough for them to offer moderate coverage before the year ends."
AskReddit,fe7cycm,t1_fe79hzc,1578912895.0,They don't advise. They're basically an official government witness that maintains integrity. Usually some kind of transaction. A typical notary is just someone available on the side that will put their stamp on it for a small amount of money. I suppose in big cities people might do it fulltime but most notary have a day job.

todayilearned,fdsizmq,t3_emw9a7,1578703665.0,"Yeah, someone introduced Asian Carp into a large local freshwater lake and over the years the carp are wrecking havoc to the native fish. People are idiots.

Also reminds me of the snake problem in Florida.  To the point they have to pay bounties.  All because people release or lose their pet snakes."
AskReddit,fdl7jzh,t3_elssvy,1578518387.0,I though women had balls for a while. I got ahold of a girly magazine that was explicit like Hustler or something. The woman was doing a doggy style pose with her butt facing the camera and her beef curtains were plentiful and hung low. I thought that for years until I went through puberty and started obtaining my own porn.
pics,fdjv22f,t3_elnfci,1578488447.0,"Use it to buy an even spread of the top 5 cryptocurrencies and chart and share it's demise over the course of 2020. One guy did that for 2019 and shared it with the crypto subreddit. I guess it's sort of a PSA of how it's just gambling and you'll likely lose but who knows, you might get lucky."
AskReddit,fdhxmkk,t3_eled64,1578432013.0,Meme culture. People who identify themselves with the memes they see and act like they hold that belief dear like it was an original idea in their head. Like some twisted mashup with Black Mirror and Inception. They don't realize it either.  Like being manipulated to think or feel a certain way about something and trashing anyone that thinks or feels differently about it. Shit's weird.
technology,fdetc3h,t1_fde2x4g,1578346176.0,"Sure, but the opposite is true too. People judge an actor's inner self based solely on the roles they play. Like Tom Hanks. Plays mostly wholesome roles or men of integrity so that must be his personality. I mean I would guess he's not into kids or an asshole but he is a guy that keeps his private life private. I doubt most people could name one fact about his personal life. The only thing I can think of is that he has a son that seems to try to show the world he's not a square like his father is perceived to be. That's it off the top of my head."
pics,fddou1z,t3_eks6jx,1578319879.0,And what if it's true? Do you expect some rich people are going to grow a concious and confess? I don't understand the point of beating it into the ground. Suicide? Murder? The guy is dead and unable to provide names regardless of which it is. At this point it's just a meme that has lasted past it's expiration date.
pics,fdbusld,t1_fdau035,1578262298.0,"It still has no logic because the War on Terror expanded under Obama and with a record number of stuff going boom in 2016. So, vote for nobody? 

This is more /r/im12andthisisdeep territory."
worldnews,fdax9ju,t1_fdaggfd,1578251468.0,When he or she makes that move it will be a time of the supernatural . Christ will have called up all believers and split with them. Antichrist doesn't really mean against Christ like the name implies. It means closer to fake Christ. People will think they are a god. I don't think they would have opposition like some run of the mill political person.
worldnews,fda6lld,t1_fda52ec,1578242301.0,"In the beginning,  yes. Israel will think he's the Messiah too. Halfway through though he defiles the temple and turns on the people with a side of God's wrath kicking in too.

The latter part is your opinion. It's interesting to note from a educational perspective though who is included in the Biblical end times and who is not mentioned then look at the current state of the world."
mturk,fd9jtyj,t3_ek8630,1578234358.0,"I did Mturk 5 years ago or so then stopped. I've signed in occasionally to see if I'm still active and do a easy hit. I can't really comment on if it's still like I remember. You could spend an hour or two and make $5-10 just casually looking for hits.

I think things sort of went down a bit when they stopped being exclusive and inviting everyone that pretty much signed up. That and India started participating maybe? And driving the money down happily doing hits cheaply? Not sure. I don't keep up with it much but check in once or twice a year."

worldnews,fd8ygmk,t3_ek2aeq,1578225370.0,"I realize most of you are atheists but in Revelations it mentions how nations start flipping out during the Tribulation towards what is happening in Israel. Strangely enough Iran, Babylon, isn't mentioned. Through symbolism it's accepted that it's Russia and/or China that takes action. And gets squished. It's also of note that nothing describes the US in this either."
science,fd65rch,t1_fd49dec,1578185911.0,That would reduce the number of fentanyl and meth users for sure! /s This is like a post saying there's a problem with an increasing number of people using meth and fentanyl and you say let's make it easier for people to get and use said drugs? And the 25 people that upvoted you and apparently agrees......
pics,fd5f9r0,t1_fd4wmdq,1578177044.0,"They don't get the irony ,or the insulting factor, of trying to educate you about the effects of war when you were a victim of said war. You're having this discussion with sheltered white boys that are okay with turning your nightmare into political bullshit. 

I didn't serve in Desert Storm but I did afterwards in that region briefly and I met countless Kuwaitis that had nothing but gratitude. Shame on these cuddled kids trying to dumb it all down to indiscriminately killing innocent people for oil. That's pretty much the message looking at all the top comments and you're even getting heavily downvoted. War does suck but sometimes it's necessary. That's just life and has been since we crawled down out of the trees."

todayilearned,fcyrp0o,t1_fcxne3z,1578085657.0,"I remember him challenging Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit)) to a boxing match because Fred was talking shit....or something. It never happened obviously. People that thought they were hardcore,  or at least pretended to be playing their role, would talk shit because Creed was popular and had sort of Christian undertones so there was a lot of "" you're a poser!"" ""Am not!"" kind of stuff. Spoiler, they were all posers.

Edit- Limp Bizkit not Linkin Park."

Shouldn't take junior league stuff too seriously."
funny,fcqoa9s,t1_fcqbh07,1577889480.0,"I used to sack the coach's kid, the quarterback of course, quite because the coach would tell the offensive line to hit low around the knees to slow them down. I said to myself why not launch myself over the nose guard and grab the quarterback? It worked like 4 times in row but it felt cheap to me so I stopped it. This was like 8th grade and practice too."

trashy,fcorae6,t1_fcomut3,1577839435.0,It's called loitering and illegal in most places. You can't just hang out in a business's parking lot.  Well you can but the police can ticket you for it. Most likely they'd just tell you to leave.
trashy,fcoqpxl,t1_fcofvtj,1577839020.0,"Never seen a sign that says ""no loitering"" in a business's parking lot? It is illegal in most places to just hang out in a parking lot ."

Don't know song name but it's country and that's the chorus. I was sort of busting his balls in a friendly way. I change the lyrics to ""(kid's name) is in love with his stepsister. He says with a deadpan face while looking at me, ""Well, not anymore after my dad and stepmom had a talk with me"""

extramile,fcfecxe,t1_fcb70dx,1577629096.0,I seriously doubt it. Men wear a special sock-type thing and women wear a maxipad kind of covering. At best it probably less than a lap dance. They were both A listers at the time. And in relationships.  So....doubt.

AskReddit,fca9ldh,t3_egroo0,1577565204.0,"Whatever song my neighbor on the other side of the thin wall would play in the early AM hours, almost nightly, while I was working 12 hour shifts that started at 6am. I don't know what the song was as I could only hear the bass. Beating on the wall did nothing. Knocking on his door went unanswered. The only thing that actually worked short term was calling the cops a few times over the course of a year when I was to the point of having a breakdown. That only lasted a few days before that same song would start resonating through the wall again.

This was like 15 years ago but hearing that specific beat today would most definitely raise my blood pressure."
television,fc8a9fx,t1_fc6mjx5,1577530385.0,"As a middle-aged man who never played the game, but I do like this type of fantasy, I'm a few episodes in and I'm not feeling it yet. I think it looks pretty and has a handful of cool looking scenes but the story is all over the place. I'm look who is this and why do I need to know it and just when it seems like something significant is going to happen it switches to another story where I'm again wondering if this has anything to do with the main story.

I can imagine going into this already knowing characters and plots it might be a fun ride but I can totally understand why unbiased critics are not really liking it."

If it's 5% then you owe 5 cents on every dollar. 50 cents on $10 and so on. Easy to figure out a pretty precise final cost in your head.

It's like saying why not switch to metric like the rest of the world? Because the headache of implementing the changes and dealing with all of the confusion isn't worth the benefit,  if there even is one."
