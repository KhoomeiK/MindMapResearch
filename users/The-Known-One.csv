survivormalebeauty,ff5l841,t1_ff5l5v7,1579598305.0,"What are some of his politics? Can I know some please? But yes, he’s super bangable when he has that dad bod. But I wouldn’t mind banging him when he’s island fat, too because at least he seems huggable. He can be my teddy bear. I always wonder how big he gets when hard."
survivor,ff5kwnr,t1_ff5gklb,1579597825.0,Well the cast photos used to be like that since it was the early 2000’s. It was a vibe back then. Oh how times have changed‼️

survivormalebeauty,ff43d1j,t3_eriqnq,1579554649.0,The only 3 I’d bang are 1) Nick 2) Ethan 3) Rob. Nicks face when he smiles and because he’s just island hot. If use his island hot bod as a plate to serve my five coarse meal. Ethan because he aged like fine wine. I think he’s a lot hotter now; I want to drink him. Rob because he looked so fuckable and juicy in RI. I just wanted to bang him super hard at Ometepe because of how dominant he was towards players.

survivormalebeauty,feeqhv8,t1_feepqkc,1579039062.0,"Oh yum. I like your freaky thoughts. I agree. He’s so introverted in that season, relaxed and laidback. It makes me feel at ease and calm. Almost as if I get a sense of clarity if I were to be around him. Now in 2020, seeing his preview how he’s so pumped and excited for WaW in the trailer gives me vibes that he’s learned to be super extroverted now. It makes me pumped and excited for him to play this new revolutionized game. Can’t wait to see this stud take over our screens‼️"
survivormalebeauty,feeowvp,t3_eor5dg,1579038151.0,He is so handsome. I always thought he resembles Jesus Chris.
offmychest,fee7cvn,t3_eojf0n,1579027910.0,"First off, I’m sorry for your loss. He will be watching over you as your guardian angel. Next. I want to empathize and advocate for you: I’ve attended rave parties and music festivals for about 4 years trying to fit in and find belonging while I didn’t realize everything I ever needed were the people I had in my life outside of the rave scene. This rave culture is all a deceitful way of manipulation and I truly felt like during those four years of living with an altered state of mind, I felt like I was possessed because I felt controlled by the substances. Now I’ve been clean from drugs (ecstasy) for almost a year and I couldn’t be any more happier to have some sort of normalcy in my life again. Addiction is real. I commend anyone who is fighting through it and remaining strong against any potential relapse. I testify for my experiences and actions. In religious views, for me, Jesus is the way for eternal love and happiness (Note: It may differ from your religious views and background). Everyone who read this, seek love through people; not substances! I will be praying for you and everyone who ever is going through addiction or have beat it. All love ♥️"

It sounded very condescending that he made it to the top and kind of forgot about how everyone else feels.

offmychest,fee5oxi,t1_fedd2k6,1579026927.0,You’re great at editing your original post. You took out how you had a better family who took you in and you sounded very belittling before you made all your revisions. Very smart of you to do such a thing.
offmychest,fee4zp7,t1_fedd2k6,1579026509.0,You need to change the articulation of your choice of words because the way you talk makes it seem as if you “made it” compared to others. Expect to get backlash with the way you talk. Maybe you need to re-read your post before positing to not make it sounds so sensitive and offensive to those who are going through hardships? And maybe show more compassion with your post?

offmychest,feczv9h,t3_eog7oh,1578991672.0,"1. You’re sick of everyone else because you “finally made it”?
2. You forgot your “roots” and where you came from.
3. Thus, you are sick of yourself because you were once that person who faced hardship in their life.
4. Look in the mirror and say this to yourself, “I will not let my past hardships invalidate others trauma & I will understand all perspectives of others’ trauma because everyone’s situation is not the same”."

And my post does not revolve around those who already know the show is going to end; I’m just trying to make a point that we should appreciate the show while it’s still up. Me giving an example, that we never know it could be cut from us within the next 5 years and I even openly admit that I can be wrong. It’s not that deep. All I was stating an opinion and people don’t know the definition of what an opinion is. You, sir, are basically stating opinions yourself, too. Welp, this escalated quickly. No ill-intent here. Sorry if I offended you."
survivor,fdjdzmx,t1_fdjdv1u,1578466866.0,"It’s an opinion, sir. I’m phrasing it as in a way for the superfans (like you) to be keep an opened-mind and be prepared and aware for a cancellation of the series. You may never know. Keep your eyes peeled.

survivor,fdiwi9m,t1_fdirnku,1578452627.0,I don’t think I’m being a dick. I just think the superfans on this sub are overly sensitive to others bold thoughts and opinions.
survivor,fdiwby7,t1_fdisysr,1578452513.0,"Well. thats what I interpreted from you. See how interpretation works? Apology accepted. I just think all the super fans of this show are downvoting my claims because they are hurt from what my thoughts and opinions are. I don’t even think I sound certain because it should be natural from the original title that the viewers would already possess the mentality of understanding someone’s opinion, but clearly it did not. Well, at least I think all the super fans who are obsessed with this show are downvoting. I’m a fan of this show and I believe that the show will end in 5 years. However, I do not want it to. I’m just being prepared for the future cancellation of this show. It’s inevitable."
survivor,fdiq17b,t1_fdipo44,1578448469.0,"Yeah, thanks for pointing it out. And it just proves how literally everyone jumps on the bandwagon to attack me because they simply all misinterpreted the title by forgetting there was a “probably” in the title that they have missed. Btw there was no need to bring up the English as my first language. I thought that was quite rude to try to inflict something like that on me as if I was lacking something, which I clearly did not. It’s the eyes of the viewers who misread because of a simple word that they missed."

survivor,fdihy8x,t1_fdihnxj,1578443320.0,"First of all, English is my first language. Second of all, I did put “probably” in my title to enhance a possibility. Third of all, I do feel like I am using the appropriate language for it; maybe you just missed a few words while reading. Fourth of all, I want to see everyone else’s reasoning and not just mines. Fifth of all, I agree with you that the show can surpass s50. Sixth of all, I stand by what I said. Ultimately, there’s no need to apologize if you simply can’t understand what an opinion is."
