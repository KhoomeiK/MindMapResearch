SweatyPalms,ffcchsm,t1_ffcb1r1,1579796482.0,For sure! The sting would be horrendous.
SweatyPalms,ffccd6q,t1_ffcaisr,1579796402.0,Yeah! They're a really cool and fascinating animal.
SweatyPalms,ffcacsk,t1_ffc9dby,1579795139.0,"Yeah, they have a bad rap, so I can understand why your snorkel guide asked you to get back in the boat. I think tiger sharks are notorious for eating a variety of things. Unlike great whites, tiger sharks won't swim away after biting a human because they aren't selective in what they eat. But, given the number of people recreating in the ocean and the number of shark attacks. The probability of being attacked is super low."
SweatyPalms,ffc9pbv,t3_esr850,1579794729.0,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation rolling around this thread.

1. It's a tiger shark.

2. The person is a free diver, trained to hold their breath for long periods of time.

3. It wasn't going to eat him.

4. The nictitating membrane moving across the eye doesn't signal imminent death for the human. It's for protection.

6. Contrary to popular belief, a shark's first thought isn't, ""how will this human taste?""

5. If you're interested in learning more about why many shark attack survivors are shark advocates watch this video: https://youtu.be/BqIduefkijk

SweatyPalms,ffc91uw,t1_ffc3o1s,1579794316.0,It's a tiger shark.
SweatyPalms,ffc8vyt,t1_ffc1izf,1579794211.0,Tiger shark striping disappears with age. The older the shark the less prevalent the stripes. It's a tiger. Look at it's jaw structure compared to a bull or a great white.
SweatyPalms,ffc8nul,t1_ffc4zyq,1579794064.0,"It's a [nictitating membrane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane) that serves to protect the eye. It's true that while attacking you see the membrane cover the eye, but it's for protection and does not necessarily signal the shark is about to attack. Nothing in this video indicated the shark was going to attack, it seemed curious."

CampingandHiking,fesl9g4,t3_eqfj7e,1579366404.0,That was a great hike and some killer scenery! I hiked in July so started at 0400 to avoid the heat. Was this a recent photo?
vaxxhappened,feskilc,t3_eqcpwv,1579366194.0,"My partner and his former wife were pretty wishy washy about vaccinating. My MS work focused on zoonotic diseases, so I had some pretty strong beliefs coming into the relationship. Not vaccinating would have been a deal breaker for me. I don't understand how you can ignore basic germ theory. Thankfully, dad has a good head on his shoulders. 

That's a logical question for a dating app, because for many it would be a total deal breaker. I've often wondered how folks dating discuss that touchy subject. This simplifies the process and I love it."
relationship_advice,fes69c3,t3_eqfcej,1579361887.0,"Honestly, I would do what my partner asked if it fell within the range of legally and financialy feasible. It's his body. But, I understand you're left to deal with the details after he passes and your grief. Perhaps  you could use that argument to find a good compromise. I'm sorry, he seems rather obstinate. I hope you get to a place where you each feel honored.

My dad gave us a list of places he wanted his ashes spread, and dictated how his after-life party would go. I have him in an old coffee can (Ã  la the Big Lebowski) on our mantle. We didn't question his wishes. My partner, in a more extreme twist, wants me to limb him after he dies and backpack into a wilderness to leave his body as carrion. Obviously, not feasible or legal so he has to decide on an alternative. I plan to donate my body to a body farm for research. If sky burials were legal, we both would opt for that."
thanksimcured,fegrxwf,t3_ep2dul,1579101134.0,"If I had a nickel for every time I heard someone say that to me, I'd be able to pay back my loans. What most people don't understand is that I'm totally fine paying back the principal. It's the astronomical interest that gets me. When I make a $350 payment a month and none of that goes to principal, damn that's super discouraging."
Awwducational,febuk20,t1_fe987mg,1578962881.0,"Well played. I would give you gold for that comment. Yeah, I liked the cuteness and then thought it was a good moment to get on my soapbox as people would invariably start talking about how tasty they are. I felt like a jerk after I ate conch in Belize and then learned how bad their populations were doing."
Awwducational,fe66ewl,t1_fe5nfnz,1578882827.0,"That's a really good question. I had to Google it! I read that there is only one [conch farm](https://www.visittci.com/providenciales/things-to-do/attractions/caicos-conch-farm) but it is currently closed due to damage from previous hurricanes. It's on Turks and Caicos (Providenciales). So, it does seem like they are farm-able. I learned something new today!"
Awwducational,fe65qel,t1_fe5jibj,1578882393.0,You're welcome and it is delicious. I had it once in Belize but stopped eating it after I saw that graveyard of shells. Belize and Honduras are okay places to eat conch but Seafood Watch recommends avoiding the Caribbean conch population. It is illegal to harvest conch in Florida.
interestingasfuck,fe64kit,t1_fe5bbxw,1578881644.0,"Thanks for posting this comment. I dislike it when folks post videos thinking one animal wanted to help another. That's rarely the case. More often than not, we're projecting our perceived/desired altruism."

menwritingwomen,fe3xhpf,t1_fe3p76w,1578853763.0,For real! The kids were looking at me funny as I cackled maniacally.
Awwducational,fe3bp6z,t1_fe31juz,1578847844.0,Mostly for meat. Occasionally shells.
Awwducational,fe3bmk3,t3_enoqfs,1578847820.0,"Cute! For folks travelling to areas where conch is in the menu, conch over-harvesting is a huge issue. They have a specific number of animals needed to mate, and over-harvesting and lax regulations have pushed many populations well below that critical threshold. We were in Belize and the area north of Hol Chan was just a massive conch graveyard. Please, think twice about eating [conch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations/groups/conch) when you're vacationing in areas like the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Puerto Rico."

vaxxhappened,fdqhs95,t1_fdps22g,1578667001.0,"More importantly, have they never seen a [human](https://youtu.be/lLDNO3PHCe0) infected with rabies? Rabid dogs infect 1000s of children in places like India and Pakistan. Different story but same outcome, and it's absolutely horrifying. I'm at a loss for words when someone tells me they don't want to vaccinate their pets."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdncxun,t3_em96an,1578583120.0,I love these pens and use them for field work.
