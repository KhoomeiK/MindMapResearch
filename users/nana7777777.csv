iamverysmart,ff08z1z,t3_equjmf,1579466476.0,My brother is a lot like that 🤮 he visited for three days and all he had to talk about is how smart and precise he is and how he is the best among his friends in business even though he started later and how they all depend on him now even the oldest and the wisest and how SMART he is with every little damn thing like how he took the menu from a shop we visited and how that makes him so smart (he himself mentioned how smart that makes him right after we left the shop) because he had the brains to think we might need it later even though we never needed it after 🤮🤮🤮 similar things like that happened constantly while he was here and I was literally suffering throughout these three days but he has a massive ego so he would get hurt and super pity if I even attempted mentioning it so I have no idea what to do with him.
