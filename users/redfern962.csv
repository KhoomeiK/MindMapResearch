SkincareAddiction,ff9eat3,t3_es78hh,1579711151.0,"I (22F) am branching out a bit with my skincare after spending a year or so with very minimal products, and I have recently added Niacinimide to my routine for texture but was also thinking of adding Azelaic acid for combating redness. My skin type is definitely oily and somewhat acne-prone, but my acne is hormonal so really the only thing that helps it is birth control. 

**My current AM routine:**  
\- wash w/gentle cleanser  
\- CearVe tub moisturizer   
\- Neutrogena UltraSheer Sunscreen 85SPF

**PM Routine:**  
\- oil cleanser to remove makeup  
\- wash with a gentle cleanser  
\- TO Niacinimide  
\- CeraVe tub moisturizer  
\- Jojoba oil occlusive (this is specifically a winter product as I live in a very cold and dry climate)  


\- 1-2x a week I use the DermaE Instant Radiance Facial Peel Mask (Vit C/Glycolic acid)

I have been doing this routine for over a month now and have seen improvements with it, but I still have some redness in my cheeks and over the nose (I'm a redhead) and was thinking if adding Azelaic acid to combat some of that. The redness has not gotten worse or better with this routine, and it's not irritation based. I'm just very protective of my skin so adding any new products is like a heart attack in a $6 TO bottle. Would it be worth it to try? Is there another product I should try first?"
BeautyGuruChatter,fervti1,t3_eqeoyr,1579358886.0,I’m changing my major and it’s a giant headache. It’s been one week and I’m already ready for school to be over for the semester
Horses,fdl8p78,t1_fdkbp45,1578518943.0,"A hole in the shank would have had to have been big enough to fit leather cheekpieces, which are often .75 inches wide, sometimes wider, so it probably does not exist. Plus an early Baucher would be an incredible find, as military outfitters would most likely not use ""new"" equipment or ideas, so it would have to be a privately owned riding horse, meaning it would most likely be a very expensive animal. 

It's an AWESOME find! I'm a horse history and archaeology nerd (if you couldn't guess) and finding old horse equipment is rare as it's almost always made of leather or cloth and degrades very quickly, so only small fittings, buckles, and bits would be left unless they are specifically preserved or you get very lucky. I'm interested as to why it would be found on an old road, as the bit would most likely be in the horse's mouth, and would rarely be left on the ground. Even in modern days, finding just a bit on a trail or something would not be very common as usually\* people don't carry extra equipment on trail rides beyond a halter and lead. I would go back to the site and see if there are the remnants of a building next to the road, as the bit would most likely be found near a stable or some other rest stop along a well-traveled road. If you can I would totally go back and explore around the area to see if you can map out any sort of structure around the road! 

\*on longer treks people will bring extra pieces for bridles (usually reins), but bits rarely break so bringing an extra will just add weight and take up space"

Equestrian,fdjah86,t3_el8otb,1578463257.0,"Sounds hormonal. Studs who are cut late in life often have gelding aggression, and do better in a herd of mares. I would also see if he may have a testicle that never descended, as sometimes people will only remove the visible ball in cryptorchid studs and leave the undescended testicle int he body so while he looks like a gelding, he's not. 

I would also rule out pain, but really it sounds like a hormonal issue."
Equestrian,fdja9f2,t3_elmoqv,1578463055.0,"Could be so many things. Saddle fit, lameness, allergies, tooth pain, an aversion to the bit, bad habits. He could have learned that head tossing means he gets thrown back in the field and not made to work! He also may not like the wind in his ears; I knew a horse that needed to wear a bonnet because of that.

If you go through all of those options and can find nothing wrong, a product I would try would be a [muzzle net](https://www.equilibriumproducts.com/product/net-relief-muzzle-nose-net/). The muzzle net that has been proven by researchers at  De Montfort University to prevent head shaking in up to 79% of studied horses."
Equestrian,fdj9wx6,t3_eln69w,1578462736.0,"I'm very confused as to why your first lessons would be bareback. Even with experienced riders, riding bareback is not a great way to teach correct riding, and can cause back soreness due to incorrect balance. You should ideally be learning in a saddle, as it helps put you int he correct seat and will keep you more balanced. 

What discipline are you riding, and how old are you? I would say for any first-time lesson you will want jeans, boots with a heel, a fitted t-shirt or polo, and an ASTM/SEI certified helmet (no bike/motorcycle/skate helmets). Every instructor will require at least boots with a heel and a certified helmet even if you are over 18. If you are learning English, I would recommend switching jeans out for a pair of breeches or workout leggings, as the rivets in jeans can damage English saddles. Personally I also ride with gloves, as my hands are very sensitive, but gloves are definitely a personal preference thing and are not required by any lesson program I know."
Equestrian,fdj9hk7,t3_elo7w8,1578462353.0,"He is super cute! (I'm partial to chestnut OTTB gelding though sooo) I love love love his chunky head!

I would agree with you that he is weak through his topline and neck, but he's also just a bit fat all over and I wouldn't be surprised if he was a bit out of shape. Lots of slow hill work and proper work through the back should build that muscle up quite well. He is a bit shallow through the chest but has a well-rounded barrel, and has a correct, upright shoulder. His croup is well angled, and his legs look rather straight. He is well-balanced and isn't too downhill or uphill. With the sand, it's hard to see his feet but the far forefoot might be a bit shorter through the toe, but that could very well be the angle at which he's standing.

I would say for everything you have mentioned you are interested in he would be a great candidate! He's a solid, correct horse who is just a little out of shape."
college,fdj92cq,t3_elo4pb,1578461979.0,"Yes! Take it! You said that you know exactly why you want to go to Yale, and you've gone further than most other people in the application process. Forget about it being another person interviewing you, focus on you and why you want Yale for your future, and what you can bring to Yale. 

They most likely want to interview you because of your non-traditional schooling and ask you why you took that route instead of traditional schooling. You can explain exactly how you have here: ""I had a contentious home life, and a traditional school did not work well with my mental health and my home life. I worked very hard to pull myself out of that situation by doing independent study and dedicating myself to my work even when faced with inward and outward adversity. I feel that this dedication to myself and my schoolwork is an excellent example of my character, and how students like myself can achieve academic success despite the world telling them they can't."" 

This will sound cheesy but you're the ""story"" they're looking for. No, you don't have a legacy daddy or a 5.0 GPA (/s) or a million extracurriculars. But you have the grit, the smarts, and the discipline to be a good student no matter the circumstances. That's what makes you stand out from the crowd. From one internet stranger to another, I'm proud of you, and you should absolutely take this opportunity and run as far as you can with it."
Equestrian,fdj8dok,t1_fdj5zda,1578461379.0,"I'm glad I could help. It can be difficult to work out of old habits, I also used to be quick to frustrate and not know how to control my actions when I felt that way. It is a long road up, but every day that we make positive decisions for those that rely on us is another huge step. I hope you find someone worthy of working on your horse, and that farrier day can be as pain-free as possible for both of you."
Horses,fdj7uby,t3_elnu4j,1578460920.0,"This is most likely a mid-1800's bit. It could be two different styles, depending on one small detail:

This is *most likely* a mullen mouth half-cheek driving bit. As the name suggests, the half-cheek driving bit is a bit used on driving horses, particularly single horses that pull a buggy/sulky/carriage, and would not be used on a working horse with a plow\*. They work much like a full cheek snaffle bit by applying pressure to the bars of the mouth, leaving space for the tongue, and the shanks on the side apply pressure to the outside of the lips, which is helpful for turning a stiff horse - for instance, if half of the body is connected to a cart of some sort.

This bit would be English in origin and was originally popular with racing Trotters/Pacers, and the bit would be oriented opposite as you have here, with the shank pointing towards the ground. It is most likely that this bit then branched out from racing to other forms of driving, and it became known as a driving bit. Trotting races also became popular in the US in the mid-17th century with the development of the Standardbred Pacer, so again your date estimate would be correct.

\*I make this distinction because at this point there were many different types and breeds of horses, and a single carriage horse would not be a heavy draft plowhorse. It would be a light hot blood, like an early Standardbred, Saddlebred, or Morgan, most likely of Thoroughbred or Arabian ancestry. These horses would commonly be dual riding and driving horses, and one would use the same bit for both uses.

However, it *could* be a very early [mullen mouth Baucher](http://axwoodfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/BaucherMullen.gif). Is there a hole at the top of the shank on the right? If so, then I would say that it's a fairly positive identity. The Baucher is named after Francois Baucher, who was a French classical horseman in the mid to late 17th century, so your guess of it being from the mid-1800s is most likely right on the money. Baucher's methods were not exactly what modern equestrians would call ethical or kind, but he did bring about the idea of lightness through the forehand and bridle, and his methods did soften over time.

This bit provides more leverage than a snaffle, but and is considered a ""hanging cheek piece"" rather than a leverage bit. In modern days it is legal in every English ring but the hunters, and is a popular bit in low-level dressage, even though it's use is somewhat controversial as it does create leverage on the horses poll which can create a false frame instead of encouraging correct riding through the back and hind end. This is a riding bit, and so the horse that would carry this bit would have been a riding horse only, meaning it would have most likely been a very well-crafted and expensive piece of equipment."
Equestrian,fdj5jk5,t1_fdj4clw,1578459038.0,"I think the fact that you're so torn up about it a) makes you a great horse owner and b) gives you the answer you need. Don't worry about the farrier - farriers will always find more horses to shoe, you're not going to lose any sort of positive reputation by changing farriers, and by making a change that is healthier for you and your horse you will both be happier in the long run. Your farrier should know which horses can present with misbehavior, pain, or anxiety, and should have the proper and ethical behavior to work with those behaviors. You wouldn't want your vet beating your horse, and your farrier is as important as your vet. 

I would also recommend getting Dormosedan from your vet. You can get it in an oral gel, which means it's much easier for you to administer and you don't have to worry about IV/IM injections. It goes under the tongue, and you do have to give it approx. 40 minutes before the visit, but it can last 90-180 minutes depending on the dosage, which your vet will be able to recommend to you."
Equestrian,fdj4176,t3_eln0hh,1578457863.0,"I'd fire the farrier, hire a new one, and always tranquilize. Especially because your farrier used to have him sedated during shoeing, stopped sedation, and instead of going back to sedation, hit him with a *hammer*. That doesn't bode well imo, for someone to know the horse and still act the way he did.

One of our boys is a perfect angel but gets bored. He likes to nibble on the farrier's shirt, and a firm no or a smack if he nips is enough to put him in his place. Another needs full sedation, like *drunk drunk* to even get down to the area where the farrier works. You should be advocating for your horse, and sometimes sedation is the right choice."
Equestrian,fdcpjmp,t3_ekdkl0,1578280806.0,"Do you ride gaited Morgans? If so that will probably be the biggest difference between the two. Horses can be taught a gait, but Arabs are not naturally gaited so you will be riding walk/trot/canter. If you don't ride gaited Morgans, then you should have zero difficulties changing over!

Arabians are stereotypically hotter horses, but no trainer worth their money is going to put you on a hotter horse than you can be comfortable on. Spook wise, it's totally dependent on the horse and also the day. If it's colder or windier than it has been, a horse is more likely to spook. If it's hotter and more humid than it had been previously, the horse is more likely to be sluggish! I would bet that any lesson horse you're put on will be a solid, dependable partner. 

Like another commenter, I would suggest finding non-breed specific barns to start out in your chosen discipline(s). This will help you ride all different types, breeds, and temperaments of horses while you're still figuring out the basics. If you find a breed or temperament you like, then go from there! For instance, my hunter/jumper barn has Warmbloods, Thoroughbreds, Quarter Horses, Paints, a sport pony, and a draft cross! Having these different horses also helps cater to our riders and their needs. We can support a wider diversity of riders from age to body size to experience because our horses are also incredibly diverse!"

Except he didn't really have great dexterity and would often tumble past me with my pants still in his mouth. 

Something instinctual that I've turned into a command was his tendency to lie down when he saw another dog. I trained it into a cue, and now when we see another dog, he moves off the side of the trail/road and sits or lies until I let him go. PERFECT boy."

Equestrian,fcvbdiv,t3_ej3a9y,1577998552.0,"* How many horses do they have? What is the ratio of school to boarded horses? If they have only a few school horses and many boarded horses, this means they are more focused on training and less on lessons, meaning you could possibly be pushed aside to cater to other people.
* How many shows do they go to a year? How long are they gone? Who teaches at home when they are gone or do lessons stop? 
* What is the highest level they teach? The lowest? If a barn only has beginners or teaches basics, I would avoid them if you are looking to become more advanced. As an adult, I would also avoid a kid-dominated barn, but that is just my preference.
* How well-kept is the property? Nobody *needs* Wellington-style perfect landscaping and manicured barns, but are the aisles clear, the wash racks clean of poop, the tack rooms organized? 
* Are the other riders friendly? Obviously, I would not expect to be best friends with them on day one, but every rider completely ignoring you is probably a sign that the barn doesn't foster a very friendly environment. 
* Does the trainer own the barn, or is it owned by someone else? 
* I would also consider how many time slots they have open and what type of lessons they offer. Do they only offer group lessons, only private, or a mix of both? How are the groups organized? 
* Are riders doing things for themselves? In my personal opinion, I want to see lesson riders tacking up their horses, grooming, wrapping legs, etc. A privately owned horse is different, as you don't know the backstory - can this person not lift their arms high, do they only have a short period of time to ride that day, maybe they just appreciate the convenience.

I would also ride a couple of times at each barn. First impressions are super important, but they may put you on a lesson horse you don't suit the first time and your ride goes poorly, or you may be nervous and that could affect your riding as well. I would see if you could be added to a group lesson on a weekend as well, as there you'll be able to understand the barn dynamics and meet more people as well. 

Good luck on your barn hunt and with your riding!"

socialskills,fcg6wvh,t3_eh7gm4,1577637003.0,"Yep. It’s not the rudest thing in the world, and sometimes it is helpful, like in situations where time is of the essence like calculating a tip. However if the person is trying to learn, it is definitely rude.

It also depends on the person. So it’s best to avoid making games out of something others struggle with, as it can be humiliating to always be talked over or “beaten” in a game they aren’t playing."
Equestrian,fc600f4,t1_fc5v7se,1577469312.0,"Yes I would! I am a very small woman who can comfortably wear children’s gloves so I get a size S, and the fingers fit me perfectly but are often a bit long. For instance I also wear a size 7 in Roeckl gloves, but the thumb is almost an inch too long even though the gloves fit everywhere else."
dogs,fc5qolt,t3_egd1xw,1577463865.0,"The baby stage is easy. You’re going to have much more issues from 6mo-3years. My dog was a perfect puppy up to 6mo. He then turned into an absolute tyrant, and did not stop his quest for tyranny until he turned 4. He has definitely mellowed out in the last year or so, but I thought that the baby stage would be the hardest and I was swiftly proved wrong.

This may also be different for different breeds! I have a working mutt who is mostly ACD which are known for their attitudes. He’s sweet as can be but is definitely full of sass."
Equestrian,fc5q62j,t3_egc2lf,1577463571.0,"I love my leather SSG gloves, as well as Heritage brand. There is a French brand called Fouganza that also makes excellent gloves, but I find that the fingers are quite skinny. Great for people with smaller hands but not so much for those with larger hands!"
