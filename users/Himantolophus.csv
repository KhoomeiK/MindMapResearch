I knew when making my comment here I'd get downvoted but it's quite hilarious to see just how many have objected to my comment. This looks like such a generic by-the-numbers film, one we've all seen a thousand times - the gender imbalance is a symptom of that and a pretty damn obvious one. That so many have objected to me pointing that out is incredibly telling"

AskFeminists,femstox,t3_epu3x9,1579268609.0,I recommend reading Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez. It's documents in great detail all the ways that western society is shaped for men and ignores women. There's a chapter on healthcare and how women have historically been excluded from medical studies due to a fear that it'll affect their reproductive potential (regardless of whether or not they want to reproduce).
AskReddit,fela9e4,t3_eppn2i,1579217483.0,If you were a kid the pilot would sometimes let you visit the cockpit once they got to cruising altitude. One flight when my sister and I were both teens we got to do that and then just before we started our descent an air steward asked if we'd like to sit there for the landing. It was a night landing and it was just like the [Krypton Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Krypton_Factor#Response_(1986%E2%80%931995)). It was awesome!

AskUK,feggv7l,t3_eoznty,1579092336.0,"WIs and farmers markets are great for good jam but if you are in a supermarket it's best to check the ingredients. Good jam should be just fruit and sugar, with a roughly 50:50 ratio. If there's other additives or a lower fruit content the jam is going to be less good. 

I mostly make my own. I did apricot jam last year for the first time. I'm not a fan normally but the homemade stuff was incredible! And so easy, it set really quickly."

AskUK,fedlg2w,t3_eombsm,1579014440.0,"You shouldn't need a drill unless you're attaching them to the wall. I highly recommend getting the [IKEA toolkit](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/fixa-17-piece-tool-set-00169254/) as it has everything you need to put IKEA furniture (and much more) together. If you do want to attach to the wall then the pieces you've found look fine.

One piece of advice with IKEA furniture if you've not put any together before. Take your time! I think I'm probably odd as I love putting IKEA furniture together and every time I get something from somewhere else I find myself wishing it was from IKEA. Their instructions are the clearest and their construction methods are the easiest I've seen. Make sure you've got space to spread out, put some gentle music on, get everything out and work out what each piece is (match it to the contents at the beginning of the instructions), make sure you know which way round pieces need to be and take it slowly.  Good luck!"

FriendsofthePod,fedck55,t3_eojqot,1579007621.0,"Brilliant post! I totally agree. For a pod and an organisation that talks the talk about the benefits of diversity, they really need to walk the walk. I love the podcast - I'm British and really wish there was something similar over here (if anyone knows of anything please let me know) but the lack of women and POC on it gets more and more obvious and less and less understandable. The way that the other podcasts have been separated out - Pod Save the People, Hysteria etc does make it feel like it's siloing these subjects.

Offering to help pay seems more than reasonable. I'd go round and introduce yourself and then say what you've said here - just want to lower the height a bit, would offer to do it yourself but scared of ladders so would be happy to contribute to the cost - and see what they say. If you're polite and don't make it sound like you're judging them (not that I get any sense of that from your post) for having an overgrown garden it should be fine. Good luck!"
GardenWild,fe8zvue,t3_eo449d,1578932740.0,"Yellow rattle is a good start. Rye grass is a very vigorous grass and isn't hugely suitable for wildflower lawns. Trying to cut it without damaging the wildflowers is going to be a challenge. Your best best it to remove the rye grass and replace with less vigorous varieties (I'm not sure where you are so can't recommend anything specific but my UK wildflower lawn has sheep's fescue, slender creeping red fescue and crested dogstail) but that could be challenging if you've already got seeds and bulbs planted."
GardeningUK,fdx2yxh,t1_fdwtaa5,1578764733.0,"I'd do the same. Might be worth getting a tree surgeon if you have the money as they'd know the best move but if you can't do that I'd cut back the main branches to form a more shaped crown then trim the other branches back. You're not going to be able to lower the height of the crown but you can definitely get it more under control. 

I'm wondering if you can remove the side-trunk. If you're ok with it I'd leave it but if you do one just one trunk then I'd probably leave it for a year or two so the tree can recover from the major pruning first. And it would definitely be worth consulting a tree surgeon if you do want it gone."

I only met her after I'd moved halfway round the world to do the PhD. It was a bit odd meeting her for the first time! And I've slowly met other internet friends. It's always been a bit odd to start with because I'd never actually spoken to any of them before meeting in person, it had always been text-based, so hearing their voices and realising they were completely different to the ones in my head was odd. But they're proper friends now and I see some of them as regularly as is possible for people living in different parts of the world."

I know it's completely beside the point of your OP but medicine has changed so much that the idea of med students using such outdated resources is really concerning. I'm sure there's going to be other, newer, stuff out there."
TwoXChromosomes,fdkc3il,t1_fdkbugw,1578500729.0,"Were they recommended by your lecturers or something? I really don't like the idea of med students learning info from 18 years ago.

That's so old I'd be complaining that I'm being given out of date course materials even if there wasn't the sexism aspect, which there most definitely is. Find the course co-ordinator or someone you feel comfortable talking to (if you're not sure who maybe approach one of the female lecturers for advice) and put in a complaint. 

And just on the 2002 stuff, unless it's being given as a ""this is how people thought at the turn of the millennium"" it has no place in lecture. The advice I was given as a graduate was to use papers published within the last decade unless you're discussing a historical context and lecturers should be following the same rules. This suggests to me he hasn't updated his lectures in a seriously long time which could mean that you're being given out-of-date information. Not something you want about something as serious and fast-moving as medicine."

GardenWild,fdk789v,t3_eltyje,1578497664.0,"I would wait until the spring, and then if nothing comes up buy some snowdrops and bluebells. Snowdrops are best bought 'in the green' (with leaves on) rather than as dormant bulbs. You can buy them in bulk online (I used [Naturescape](https://www.naturescape.co.uk/) last year and was very happy with what I got) for not too much money, plant them in clumps and then let them naturally multiple to form a beautiful carpet. 

Once the trees come into flower need plants tolerant of shade. Ferns can be really nice and there are native flowers that don't mind shade. Foxgloves in particular. I redid my lawn last spring and decided to get some meadowturf as I couldn't wait for seed to grow due to having a dog. I got a [woodland mix](https://www.turfonline.co.uk/meadowmat/woodland-shade-mix/) for under my tree and it was really pretty. It's definitely more expensive than seed but it came into flower pretty quickly and while it dies back over winter, I can already see new life coming."

I live in the south-west and ""love"" is very common round here too, and it drives me fucking crazy. I try not to get mad at people when it's clear they say it to everyone but there are times when it feels inappropriate and I have started calling it out. Certainly when I'm in a professional setting being called ""love"" can make me feel like I'm being demeaned, or at the very least not being seen as an equal. Would you call your boss ""love""? If not then ask yourself why you called this woman ""love"". 

I think you just need to say to your boss that it wasn't intended as anything other than friendly but that you'll try to refrain from using the term at work."

Fortunately I've been able to find some decent ones again so I'm back to having my phone in one back pocket and my keys in the other. 

So maybe you have one sample and I have another, and maybe, just maybe, retailers could put pockets on their jeans and allow those of us who want them to use them and those who don't to, you know, not."

You can give them a bulb feed in the autumn if you feel like it.
