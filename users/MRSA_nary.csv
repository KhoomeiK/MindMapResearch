BabyBumps,ffe0amb,t1_ffdrcgc,1579833387.0,"Did you ever read The Hospital By The River? I read it a long time ago and it's definitely stuck with me. It's from two married doctors who specialized in fistula repair after childbirth in Africa. I was in nursing school when I read it and sort of aware that it *could* happen, but I remember being completely shocked that as recently as when they were working (the 1970s-90s?), fistulas were happening as often as they were. It's been awhile since I've read it so some details might be fuzzy.

I'll definitely have to read A Midwife's Tale someday too. Thanks for the recommendation!"

In short, baby got vaccines. Mom put baby to bed, had a drink, then went to sleep co-sleeping with the baby. Baby suffocated face down overnight. Some evil soul convinced her that it wasn't actually the co-sleeping, it was the vaccines. She became quite radicalized. She lied about the autopsy. Now she sells tshirts and has a billboard about ""healthy babies don't die"" and harasses other people online."

FundieSnark,fezxp7q,t3_eqxef2,1579463057.0,"I've wondered the same thing. For example, many of them (ahem Duggars) have TONS of experience with pregnancy. They love pregnancy and babies. Awesome! Go to nursing school! Work on a labor unit and make a career out of it. Get experience caring for others, make some money to set yourself up before you take time off with your kids. Nursing is actually pretty flexible for families. Some nurses work a lot and make lots of money doing it. Some work as needed and just fill in every now and then. You can have entire days off to spend with your kids. You can work days or nights, if your unit has openings. You can arrange your own schedule and go to the after school concerts and stuff with your kids, or take several days off in a row without even using PTO. Yeah, it's hard work and really stressful sometimes. But as far as their interests and flexibility for families, I would say it's a great choice. 

Oops, I forgot. Nurses have to learn about evil biology and see genitalia all the time in an utterly non-sexual way. Can't have that."

You are endangering the lives of my patients and the world around you. The young, the old, the immunocompromised, the sick, and yes- even those of us who are healthy are protected by vaccines. You choose to ignore reality and it kills people. When toddlers get pertussis and cough until they pass out- it's on your hands. When babies die of fucking measles in 2020- their blood is on your hands. When cancer patients survive chemo to die of the flu- their blood is on your stupid hands.

You choose to ignore reality and it kills people. You choose to put other parents in the position of burying their infants so you don't have to experience the discomfort of watching yours get a life saving shot. You choose to not see the value in another human's life, to see that life is worth protecting.

exchristian,fehjtui,t1_feh8ci8,1579118008.0,"The idea that second and third trimester abortions are happening all the time out of choice is something the conservative right has spun to rile people up. Does it ever happen? Yes, but it's by far the outlier. Abortions that late are extremely rare, and usually occur in extreme circumstances. ie, your baby has a major anomaly, like it doesn't have a brain, they will not survive. You can either continue the pregnancy, feeling a baby growing and kicking and dealing with people touching your belly and telling you how excited you must be and how they just *loved* being pregnant, all the while knowing your baby will die before you meet them. Or you can end the pregnancy and mourn on your own terms in your own timing. Either decision is terrible because it's a terrible situation. But I'm certainly not going to demonize people who have to make that decision. I'm also not going to support legislation that would try to limit these choices for a family going through the worst possible thing imaginable on the off chance that 1/100 was a choice."
