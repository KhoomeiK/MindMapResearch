ENFP,feeliuo,t1_feel8d7,1579036186.0,"I totally agree with that but the point about quotes is that, like what happened here, people can interpret them in ways they weren't meant to be interpreted in. I just posted this comment to help steer ppl away who understood it in a wrong way but I definitely support your point."
ENFP,feekjto,t3_eom0ji,1579035618.0,"That doesn't sound rational at all. News flash, if you're abnormally kind that means you're not kind to everyone and you're not kind without a reason. If you're abnormally kind and you don't want anything for exchange then props to you. For the other ones who claim they're better than everyone else while they just use too much kindness to hide that they have flaws like everyone else, wake up."

SuicideWatch,fdpwlar,t1_fdpw69g,1578643528.0,I get that man. Don't push her to say anything.  Just try to be next to her as much as you can so that she is convinced you care. She'll open up because she already needs to. She just needs to trust someone.
SuicideWatch,fdpuv24,t1_fdpurio,1578641432.0,Hey man I'm suicidal lol 10 mins ago I was gonna throw myself off a roof so dw ill understand
SuicideWatch,fdpupaq,t3_emnkzq,1578641245.0,I RELATE SO MUCH. Like how am I gonna tell people I'm suicidal without making myself looking like an attention whore or making a joke out of myself.  Despite all these ppl preaching suicide awareness people need to learn alot
SuicideWatch,fdpulbk,t1_fdpuazx,1578641113.0,Yeah man. I really hope everyone on this subreddit sees the post so that we can all start helping each other. I PMed someone right now from this subreddit.
SuicideWatch,fdpueod,t3_emnkja,1578640891.0,Not to talk you out of it but could u pls tell me why? I'm happy to listen.
SuicideWatch,fdpuchm,t3_emnjyj,1578640819.0,Give them a hug. Just listen to them. Be around them even if they don't make u feel they appreciate it. They gave up on life so don't give up on them.

self,fdkb8s9,t1_fdkb1fs,1578500209.0,If i were a trust fund kid I think I'll just spend the whole day watching memes. Well I wanna spend my life doing something i love so that I'll just make time pass by and not kill myself so that my family doesnt get sad.
self,fdjqdua,t1_fdjqar8,1578483416.0,I get that man the 30s are usually the age when ppl start feeling your feeling but if you want to feel less like that check the story of steve harvey the comedian.  I know we're only focusing on one part of the problem but come to me after u check out his story and we can sure help u feel better
self,fdjptcj,t1_fdjpra4,1578482682.0,The race of life is at least 100 times longer than u can imagine
self,fdjpra4,t1_fdjpofp,1578482606.0,I think that's enough stuff to make you feel bad so you're not really that behind. Hardships are not distributed over people with the same intensity and timing

offmychest,fdjni6v,t3_elqel9,1578479503.0,Idk man I really don't know what to say. This world is fucked up
offmychest,fdjndzs,t3_elqirg,1578479338.0,Assholes exist and we have to get attached to one of them so that we know not to get attached to assholes again.
offmychest,fdjnbn6,t3_elqj7x,1578479246.0,"Well I opened this post cuz I felt it was speaking to me lol. I got one lesson I learnt from the period of loneliness and dullness in my life though. Don't bother asking ppl to help u out of it. No one really cares. Everyone is dealing with their own shit and no matter how much they care, they don't really give a shit. I'm so sorry to hear about what's going on with u and I really understand the toll it can take on u to live like this. But just take one thing from my longass comment. The person who depends on humans in anything is building a castle of sand. People are not to be depended on and this is life afaik. I've tried so much to get love from ppl and all that just hurt me more. Not saying people are bad I'm just saying they are not the ones you should depend on. I'm not sure if what I'm saying has any meaning to you maybe I'm just talking shit about my own experience but even tho idk u I just don't want u to feel hurt by getting betrayed by a person u trust. U can pass your time definitely by exploring new cultures. Watch some anime to have a conversation with your brother. Listen to a new type of music and learn about the culture of its fans. Watch a new genre of movies and join the forums of its fans. Every type of art has it's own distinct beauty and exploring every type with no biases really enriches your soul. Also if you wanna pm I wouldn't mind as well I can help u learn about the cultures I'm in"

gatekeeping,fd8xka4,t1_fd8x2sw,1578224956.0,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha omg that is so damn accurate
gatekeeping,fd8wpol,t1_fd8wlhi,1578224562.0,Noiceee then i guess thrash is the one I'm talking about. Thrash metalheads are the worstttt
gatekeeping,fd7wbba,t3_ek7w2l,1578211126.0,Thrash Metal is 99% gatekeeping and 1% Music

self,fd7soqq,t1_fd5fnbn,1578209493.0,I don't think therapy would be that hard or at least it shouldn't be. I didn't take it personally so I dont really know.

self,fd2x60y,t1_fd2u60w,1578152525.0,Wow. Just wow. I really appreciate your help tbh. Thank you so much. Unfortunately weed is hella illegal in my country so it's really difficult to get and I got some religious reasons not to use it but I appreciate you taking your time and putting this comment. Thank you. I might pm you later you seem like a great person
self,fd2wmn2,t1_fd2vjjz,1578152319.0,Wow I can really relate to that. Therapy is really difficult to go to even if you were able to seek it and it's really all sad. Im sorry for you feeling like that and I read that you're depressed with your new job. If you would like someone to listen im door is open
self,fd2fibh,t1_fd2b9u0,1578146469.0,It actually is the last thing on my mind but now I might actually try it. Thanks a ton mann
