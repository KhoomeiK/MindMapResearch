I'm am experimental artist and I've had a blog with the background but I've been considering doing an audio commentary or maybe a video breakdown of the process and philosophy of the pieces. It's that something that listeners would be interested in or is it more of an artist thing?
LetsTalkMusic,ff663yr,t3_erfy38,1579620036.0,Many experimental musicians write about the pieces they create which can help listeners get a handle on what they are listening to. The process is often as interesting as the music itself
