>King and Malcolm clashed over the best tactics to end racial discrimination and prejudice. Malcolm was highly critical of King’s non-violent approach, believing King’s actions to be too slow-moving and too accommodating to white Americans and going so far as to refer to him as “a 20-century Uncle Tom.” Malcolm called for a more militant approach, achieving equality and black liberation by “any means necessary.” King attacked what he considered Malcolm’s dangerous radicalism, writing, “Fiery, demagogic oratory in the Black ghettos, urging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief.”"

He said it was “clearly aimed at empowering small groups of parents to appoint themselves as censors over their state’s public libraries”

I think he nailed it."

*Cry, the Beloved Country* by Alan Paton. The book is a story of a family in South Africa in the time just before Apartheid. It delves into the cultural clashes, the poverty, the inequality, and above all the fear. The mutual fear black and white men had for each other during this time. ""Cry, the Beloved Country, for the unborn child who is the inheritor of our fear."" 

The book turned out to be eerily prophetic too. Mere months after its publication, Apartheid was passed into law, and South Africa began one of the darkest periods of its history."
