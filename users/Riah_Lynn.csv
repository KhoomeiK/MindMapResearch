AskReddit,ffd6o7m,t1_ffbs5vx,1579814464.0,I feel personally attacked right now.
bipolar,ffcjggj,t1_ff7ak1v,1579800761.0,Well at least I have some hope. Today is particularly bad. Literally repeating something to myself so I don't forget walking across the room..... by the time I got there I forgot. Was I supposed to grab something? Look for something? Turn something on? No clue. So afraid.
fatlogic,ff8tvj4,t3_es2fu7,1579695896.0,"They always warn about ""starvation mode"" and how it can make you gain more weight as a consequence. But they think fat is beautiful and that you should strive to be ""more beautiful"" (ugh). So shouldn't they advocate for small bursts of dieting so they can push through that weight plateau and reach their full potential?"
bipolar,ff79t6q,t1_ff73ire,1579644093.0,Does it get any better? I can't handle this forever.
bipolar,ff79rs6,t1_ff6tz5m,1579644065.0,"I have had issues with memory all my life. But this and the cognitive issues with speech and word recall have gotten worse as I upped the dose. But kinda stuck here, because at lower doses I was using all my energy to appear normal at school and work. Now I don't want to die QUITE so bad, I can do some school work, and I am not full on sobbing and breaking down multiple times a week...... 

I am hoping to decrease once I'm done with school, I am hoping that I get so sick because the stress makes my bipolar worse. So maybe less stress = less meds? 

Rambled a bit there....."
uofm,ff6innr,t3_erv1fl,1579628017.0,"Yeah I only have 2 of those, and use 1 regularly since I moved from North to Central....."
bipolar,ff6i20k,t1_ff6d1ul,1579627651.0,"I am in my final semester at an R1 University. My memory is a former shell (so not much because years of undiagnosed episodes) of itself, becoming non functional. The bigger issue I am having is other cognitive stuff. I am having issues recalling words, having them come out properly, and holding onto the train of thought long enough to get it all out. But I want to die slightly less, and am able to do more than exist..... So that's cool?"
bipolar,few200z,t3_eqo73y,1579404368.0,Sun touching my skin.
fatlogic,femscep,t1_femoo4c,1579268221.0,"Seriously, when people say I'm thin only because I am vegan I laugh a toooooon. I choose not to inhale a package of oreos more than once in a blue moon. I make most of my food, with like those green things (vegetables) in the weird part of the grocery store. The hard part for me is limiting some of the peanut butter. Unrestricted I get peanut butter fat.... not a great look."
fatlogic,femnrx6,t3_epyxiy,1579264007.0,"Sometimes I forget what subreddit I am on. Was about to downvote, then saw where I am. Just delusional."
fatlogic,femnn4v,t3_epwfvv,1579263869.0,"Of course I live plant based, to make fat people feel bad. Not because I am horrified by the animal product industry. It is just to piss of people that I don't know. Seems right."
uofm,fek8oh9,t1_feh81w6,1579194921.0,"Yeah that doesn't mean that they always accept it. For me, it became easier to just take it than to keep jumping through their hoop. But, I am also graduating and needed some credit to stay full time anyway."
fatlogic,fek8jdr,t1_feiyqum,1579194837.0,What the actual fuck?!?!?
AskReddit,fei5738,t1_fehgsqt,1579130536.0,Discovered this about a month ago. Music non stop all day now. Love.
AskReddit,feh3b8d,t3_ep0nt8,1579108270.0,Continuing life.......
uofm,feh2oor,t3_ep2c7r,1579107890.0,Getting any waiver is a nightmare. I had 2 semesters of writing at a community college....... still not enough for them...... aaaanndddd now I am a senior in a FYWR. So that's fun I guess.......
fatlogic,fegl6tt,t3_ep0zzr,1579096198.0,"Mom keeps claiming that I will get fatter as I age, like she did. I am 27 and am skinner and stronger than I have ever been. She has an interesting (mostly rude) response whenever she talks to me."
fatlogic,fedz1ri,t3_eobdi8,1579022899.0,They should take a biochem course and learn how metabolism really works.....
fatlogic,fe7z5wv,t3_envvez,1578920723.0,"What if art is used as therapy? Think jack skelington, that is the average body type in my art. 

It is not helpful as therapy if I am constantly worried about other peoples expectations. Very few people ever see my art, and I would not appreciate this kind of ""constructive"" criticism if they ever caught a peek....."
fatlogic,fdwavri,t3_en29tf,1578756857.0,"Fave thing that just happened. The skirt that I bought 10 years ago in high school that was waaayyyy to small? Few years ago, fit properly, now it falls off. My hips and ass have gotten small enough that it just slides off walking. So yeah......"
fatlogic,fdn7aa8,t3_em9kad,1578579231.0,I AM THE HEALTHIEST!!!!! BECAUSE..... because doctors?
fatlogic,fdgrof4,t1_fcyv5c7,1578406573.0,I already know that bipolar will be the thing that takes me at some point. She was amazing and inspiring for living that long. Plus the benefit of her speaking on mental illness.
fatlogic,fdgpv9w,t1_fdat0ru,1578405166.0,"Just discovered oatmilk. My coffee is delicious right now. And even though it has more calories than my usual almond milk, I use way less of it."
bipolar,fc31t5o,t3_efszac,1577379498.0,"After explaining the base of the mood cycling, I have started to explain how these things color the filter of how I view the world. Helps people understand that it isnâ€™t just happy sad, but it fucks with my mind and perception."
EverythingScience,f9n5rd2,t1_f9mw2x0,1575477596.0,I think I'm gonna do that instead of getting my IUD replaced. I love the light/nonexistent periods. But pregnancy is 100% deal breaker not happening kind of thing.
