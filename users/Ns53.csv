Well make sure you're flow is going pretty good before you insert it. Try tampons hurt me and I'm a pro. lol  
Also if you're not already, make sure you're using the plastic applicator kind. They help a lot. If you have any problems inserting the applicator you can try twisting it, gently pushing it side to side. And keep in mind the vagina (the tube area it goes into not the outside) angles up toward your head. so inserting straight back is going to force it against your wall. You have to angle it. Also try standing up and putting your foot up on something. Lot of women think sitting is best way but it actually can make it harder. Gotta give it room.

As far as the sickness goes.

Your cervix actually lowers when you menstruate (That's the entrance of your uterus) and some woman only have a couple inches in there during that time. This would make inserting a tampon very difficult and it would painful if anything jammed against it or heaven forbid into it. As gross at it sounds you can actually test this by washing your hands well with JUST WATER, and then feeling around with your index finger. If you suddenly get nauseous or feel pain, or it feels like smooth round bump that is the cervix and its low. If you don't feel anything then that's not the problem.  


That's all I can really think of off the top of my head. You'll get it. I'm sure."

unpopularopinion,ff2jtzt,t3_er9ffh,1579509399.0,"I've heard of this before but it's usually in very rare circumstances. Usually the circumstances that it covers is if a father was in the child life for long enough to be considered that child's long term caregiver.  So the court's decision in that circumstance would be to have the father continue to pay child support even after separation because he should still be acting as a father to a child. I mean how would you feel if you found out that your dad wasn't really your dad. Then after knowing him as nothing other than your dad for 7+ years and he just bounced. Is actually happening my (step) brother and it destroyed him. He's still messed up over it and he's 40.

That being said I don't want hundred percent agree with the outcome. Putting the child first should be priority. I think we should make an effort to wean care off. Like making the mother have a job within 3 months or providing services with childcare so the mother doesn't have to be as dependent on child support to a father that's not really the father of her child. You also have to consider that courts love child support because it gives an extra tax money."

AskReddit,fe1yyh7,t1_fe01dby,1578832534.0,"I saw something like this.   
I was working at a small shop across from a grocery store when I see this guy holding his gut running across the parking lot. A Security guard was on his heal and dove at him. They both went down hard. Next thing I saw is him lifting this guy with his arms behind his back and blood and meat allover his shirt. I thought his chest had exploded. No. this guy tried stealing a giant Beef roast under his shirt. Tried to pass it off as if it was his belly. XD"
