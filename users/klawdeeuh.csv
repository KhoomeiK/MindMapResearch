Find something else to do on your phone. Download some books, download a game, eventually you won’t be on it as much. Honestly if it wasn’t for texting, at this point I probably wouldn’t be on my phone hardly at all anymore."

I wish we could have had firefly the way Joss wanted it originally. It would have been a much better show than what we got (which of course was still AMAZING) So fox made Joss change the show and how everything was presented, didn’t air it at the same time every week, and played them completely out of order. They wanted it to fail before it aired. Fox is ridiculous. Pure sabotage. I swear by my pretty floral bonnet it makes my blood boil just thinking of it. 😂"

If they didn’t do it just right people would freak out. I mean, I might would. Firefly is my absolute favorite show. If they ruined it I might be liable to whoop some butt, pretty floral bonnets and all. 🤷‍♀️ we’ve had too many years to think about all the aspects of the show.

Also, humidity. You’re basically going swimming when you go outside. 

We also have Pterodactyls. Some call them mosquitoes but I mean we really know what they are...

Insurance is higher on vehicles but costs of license plates etc is very cheap (my last one was like $20🤷‍♀️ and in Mississippi I used to pay like over $400 yearly for that)

Also, Louisiana floods a lot in most places so be prepared to pay a lot in flood insurance (probably) if you buy a house. 

But that being said... I freaking love Louisiana and proud to be from here. People are generally nice, it’s also a super fun environment. I live in a small town now. I used to live in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. I would like to eventually move back to the Baton Rouge area (but on the outskirts, maybe Livingston or Prairieville)
