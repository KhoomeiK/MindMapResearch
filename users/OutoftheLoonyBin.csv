It's very common for hoarders to have a lot of resistance to change. Does he sit back and let you clean when you start picking things up or having meltdowns at that possibility? If so, those are bad signs.

My experience is that in order for me to change, I have to see a benefit to it. Hoarders often have very black-and-white thinking. The house is either as it is or perfectly cleaned up, with no room for a transition state where things are being thrown out or given away and the piles are shrinking in size.  I lived in a cluttered home for a long time. What got me to change was the desire to have room for exercise equipment, and secondarily, to have to move less stuff to wherever I move next. I've moved an average of once every 30 months as an adult, so there were a lot of winnowings down of my stuff. I've been in my current home for almost eight years, and I enjoy having cleared-off floors and surfaces. 

The payoff for cleaning up has to be greater than the payoff of keeping existing stuff and adding to the piles, and it doesn't look like that will happen anytime soon."

She would have needed to live in the house 2 of the last 5 years to qualify for that benefit. If she did a schedule E (rental income), she was eligible to depreciate the house to reduce the amount of tax that she would pay on the rental income.

He needs be careful that enough tax is withheld every quarter to avoid underpayment.

If he is claiming more dependents on his return, he needs the SSN of the spouse or dependent. Something like 6 million dependents in excess  of what the IRS expected disappeared when the IRS implemented this requirement.

The IRS is VERY good at matching income to your SSN. I've gotten a letter audit for failing to declare under $20 in dividends. I wrote a polite letter to the IRS, apologized, stated that I had moved out of the country and failed to get the 1099-DIV, then pointed out that my failure to declare the dividend made no difference in my tax liability because I was required to use the tax table that gives a value for the amount of tax that you owe based on $50 increments of income.

You recognize income for tax purposes  when you receive it, not when you earn it, and your residency status at the time that you receive the money will determine what state, if any, levies income tax on a payment.  One thing that I would check is whether you had changed your state of residency to Nevada with the company by  filing a new W-4. If you are still listed as a California resident, they will withhold California taxes from the payment, but you can file a  2020  tax return in 2021 to have that money refunded. 

Look up the California state income tax return instructions for their definition of residency. It might take writing a letter to go along with your 2020 nonresident return in a year that explains the situation.

tax,fejdz05,t3_epc5b0,1579169390.0,"1. EVERY job presumes that THAT job is the only one that you will have for the year, and the withholding tables presume that  you will hold that job the entire year, which affects the amount that is withheld. Suppose that you earn $3000 at one job, and $6000 each at every other job.  NONE of the jobs will withhold for income tax, and presuming that you are single with no dependents, you will owe about $900 in tax for 2019. The fix is to have at least 5% of your income withheld at each job.

2. Look up Form 1040-ES, because when your income is not steady through the year, it's easy to owe tax at the end to the year.  Figure out how much tax that you are likely to owe, based on the standard deduction (not itemizing). 

3. ALWAYS have federal and state tax withheld from unemployment payments in an amount proportional to your expected income from the year. The default withholding rate of 10% is often not enough to cover the tax that you are likely to owe on the unemployment insurance payments,  but it would be in your case."

Suppose that OP took 100 ATM withdrawals for $600 each over the course of the year from casino-based  ATMs. Often the ATM withdrawal will have the name in the casino on the bank statement that shows the ATM withdrawal.

OP will need to file a Form 1040 and Schedule 1, which covers miscellaneous income.

Label this deduction ""gambling  losses"" and make it equal to the total of your W-2Gs.

I don't know your filing status, but the expansion of the standard deduction and elimination of the personal exemption made gambling that much more expensive if you don't have enough other deductions to be able to itemize, because part of your gambling losses will go toward making up the difference between the standard deduction ($12,200 if you are single, $24,400 if married in 2019) and the amount of itemized deductions  that you have.

If your state uses federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income as the basis for assessing state income tax, you should be all right. There is the possibility that you underpaid your taxes, even though tax is not ultimately due on you gambling winnings net of losses (or $0)  because you can only deduct gambling losses to the extent of your winnings. Look into Form 2210 (underpayment of Tax by individuals, estates, and trusts) to see if you owe any penalties.

A drawback of taxable IRAs and 401(k)s is that they turn money that should be taxed at a capital gains rate into ordinary income."

Things that I didn't want to give up, but no longer needed or would use,  became possible to give up then fairly easy to give up as I cycled through the items. It did make me sad to put a trash bin full of my old textbooks out on the curb, but they are too old to have any value. 

ONe of the librarians told me that a guy comes in and takes all of the books on the ""leave one, take one"" shelf that they have. He wondered why, and I said, ""Maybe he burns them in his wood stove."""

I love books and I read all that I acquire, but I learned years ago that I don't need to own every book that I read. Maybe 3-5% of the books that I have read I need to keep, either to reread or for reference.

I gave away too  much stuff when planning a move recently that fell through, and I wanted some small plates. I went to a thrift store on one of their sale days and saw dozens of people filling their cart with other people's stuff. I got my plates and left."

Another issue is that these benefits are often taxable, at least in part, so if she was being paid on a credit card, which seems odd, there may be a substantial bill for back taxes that she owes. Usually the government requires you to have a bank account to which the benefits are deposited."
