TIHI,ffdwu24,t1_ffdrgnb,1579830898.0,"Yes and no. Typical dance tights are a strange shade of orange/tan what is difficult to match to anyone’s skin tone, they’re just to help your legs look the same and help aid symmetry. As far as I remember this girl was very pale so they definitely looked like tights, but with every fan kick and leap it was clear that the tights were the only undergarment she wore."
TIHI,ffdncqp,t1_ffdn4dq,1579824553.0,"No, you definitely could. Dance tights aren’t like the thick opaque things you see in stores, they’re rather sheer especially when stretched like in a kick or leap."
TIHI,ffdffra,t3_esxot6,1579819752.0,"This actually happened to me, but I was the kid with the metaphorical spankies watching someone without underwear on stage. It was a competition and she had tights on, but no spankies. Going without underwear is normal and expected but that’s why spankies exist. I’m not sure if she forgot them or didn’t know about them (she mentioned to someone it was her first competition) but it was grueling to watch. Really uncomfortable and the stage hands let her know when she got off stage.

lgbt,ff5bjb2,t1_feghvyc,1579586256.0,When you’re famous it’s the personality that you present to the public that matters. I don’t need to know James Charles to know that his time in the spotlight has been fraught with scandal whereas Nikki and Tati have never had that issue. That tells me a lot.
DungeonsAndDaddies,ff5bf82,t1_feieqmv,1579586144.0,I’d have to go back and check honestly. I always start over at the Lord of Chaos pt. 1 but I’ll go back tomorrow and see if I can’t figure it out. I think it’s episode 1 if I’m taking a guess.
AskReddit,ff5b3f2,t3_ero8mj,1579585818.0,"I think there’s a couple of sides to this for me personally; the first is that my 13 year old self would be disappointed that I haven’t worked through my mental illness and past trauma and that it’s still effecting me. Which I can understand. It was then that my mental illness really started acting up and I always hoped 14 years later that I would have it under control to the best of my ability.

On the other hand, as a 13 year old I was very insecure with my sexuality and gender identity and since then I’ve embraced that and allowed it to reflect in my personal style which would make the 13 year old version of myself incredibly happy. Overall I think it would be an even give and take. I always knew I would struggle with mental illness (runs in the family) but I never knew if I would ever embrace myself and my wants and needs fully. 

In short, the younger version of myself would be happy/sad with different aspects of me and would likely be grateful for the strides I’ve taken in one area while struggling in the other.

Dachshunds are especially known for being incredibly territorial and aggressive but people don’t take it seriously because they’re small and ‘just playing’. Not saying those are bad dogs but they do have some bad tendencies if not bred or occupied correctly."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fbxxxik,t1_fbxw3rs,1577203354.0,I’m well aware why they’re endangered. My comment was about natural predators that could easily be fooled by the spots on the back of tiger’s ears. I don’t disagree that humans are a threat but that’s not what’s being discussed here.
