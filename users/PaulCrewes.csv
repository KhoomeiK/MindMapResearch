fargo,fenmht6,t3_eq37gs,1579287853.0,"Superintendent Ghandi is a California native who got his schooling in Arizona and Texas, and began his educational career in Houston. Anybody sense a theme?

If you don't have experience with cold weather and hazardous travel, defer to the experts, Dr. Ghandi."
television,felkfio,t3_epotfk,1579224311.0,"This is perfect. Lindelof doesnt really believe in resolution in his stories anyway, so let the cliffhanger hang forever."
Traeger,fejvuec,t1_fejvje5,1579187028.0,"Well, sorry for my poor wording. I've cleaned it three times. Makes no difference. Last time I cleaned it, it told me it still needed to be cleaned when I fired it up again. If I have to clean my Traeger after every use, or every three uses, then I am not a Traeger guy and it has to go."
Traeger,feipjzy,t1_feihfud,1579144033.0,Who said I haven't cleaned it?
Traeger,fehslx6,t1_fehrqb4,1579123055.0,"Alerts? Settings? I can't even get mine to stay connected to the damn grill. I'll be honest, and I know the Traeger worshippers will destroy me for this... I have TERRIBLE buyer's remorse on my grill. It is one of the worst products I've ever purchased. It shuts down in the middle of cooking, tells me it needs to be cleaned, which is strange since I just got it last spring and I've used it MAYBE ten times...

I might just get rid of it next year. I'm happy for everybody who loves theirs, but mine is hot garbage."
Traeger,fehr38y,t3_ep8af1,1579122194.0,I hope this update fixes my app access because mine has been total garbage since I bought my grill.
fargo,fedqewg,t1_fe6aggr,1579017643.0,Correct.
todayilearned,fcocqh4,t1_fcmsixt,1577829042.0,"You're exactly right. And once that video became widely shown, people who WANTED to believe suddenly came up with all kinds of descriptions and accounts to claim ""that's not what I saw"" and now the legend has become widely distorted as two supposed events and reports of black triangles, etc... Some people just WANT to believe."
todayilearned,fcocgee,t1_fckgn99,1577828851.0,The explanation became two separate events after the real event was plausibly debunked as flares and people who WANTED to believe suddenly came up with a second event.
todayilearned,fcoc0n2,t1_fclg0fr,1577828551.0,"Yes I love how it started as UFO phenomenon and when they explained it as the flares that were actually dropped that night, and TV reporters superimposed the dropping flares at night over a landscape shot in daylight and the flares winked out right at the moment they dropped behind the mountains, suddenly there were THOUSANDS of people saying ""No, that's not what I saw... there were TWO events, and I saw a black triangle fly directly overhead.""

fargo,fck9wif,t3_ehde9c,1577720473.0,"Came out this morning, totally plowed in, and the ridge was frozen solid like concrete. Snowblower *barely* handled enough of it for me to get out of the driveway.

Tonight, I'll have to get out there with my ice chopper and chop it up so I can blow it in front of my neighbor's house,"
fargo,fc6fyik,t1_fc6fi6z,1577479659.0,"Last time I was there for a comedy show they had the volume on the comics' mics so low that the guy next to me ""shushed"" me for talking to the person sitting on the other side of me. I left. Not my idea of a great comedy venue if I can't even talk to the person I came with."
FargoMoorhead,fc2ttur,t1_fc13mol,1577373858.0,"I would try to redirect it with a long PVC pipe to a different spot... somewhere in the back yard, or something?"
FargoMoorhead,fc2tqdp,t3_eauc86,1577373778.0,"Mine runs off and on throughout the winter, especially when it hovers around the freezing mark. Also, with the wet summer we had, the ground was already saturated so some of what your pump is pumping is probably left over from this summer... after that wet summer, I would expect it to kick on and off most of the winter."
tipofmytongue,fb83ruc,t3_eblduv,1576605510.0,Looks like the dog from Steven Spielberg's Family Dog TV series from 1993.
