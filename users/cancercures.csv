We have a political tool called Eminent Domain which has been used to build malls, ports, highways, rail systems, airports, sports stadiums. Huge projects. That's the type of scale that would be needed. 

Now, it would appear that we already have a 'socialist government to seize property, pay people at a loss to build tons of XX' because all of the above projects are some examples of eminent domain already being used.

And yes, Vienna was fortunate enough to have a socialist government to see this successful housing project started. Not 1 councilor, but an entire council of socialists. That project still exists to this day, thanks to the political work during that period."

Its ludicrous of course. But it is interesting to think about the effects of hundreds of thousands of shares suddenly in the hands of the people. Democratic control of the company would shift as a result. I'd imagine the price would drop as well, as desperate people are willing to rid stock cheaply, in a pinch for rent or healthcare or other goods/services.

I've always liked the idea of democratizing company ownership and putting them into the hands of people and workers. Greenbay Packers stock owners can't sell their stock - they own that for life.

EnoughLibertarianSpam,fdrefaq,t1_fdr1dah,1578683358.0,"> He even saw the UK and other European countries as potential allies in this!

You can get glimpses of this during the Spanish Civil War. On one side of the civil war was The Spanish Republic - the elected parliamentary coalition of socialists, republicans, unionists and braceros, bourgeois, and anarchists. The other side was Franco Francisco's military rebellion, backed by The Catholic Church, the landowners, and a Smorgasbord of rightwing fascist parties (Falangists, CEDA, etc).

When the civil war first kicked off (when spanish landowners/fascists realized they would no longer be able to win electorally in spain), Mousoulini and Hitler did not immediately want to side with Franco Francisco's rebellion, because they did not want to tilt France and UK's hand by compelling them to side with the Republic. Already there was concern about Fascism in Europe, and an outright support of military rebellion for another fascist state could tilt France/UK's hands against the fascists. But here is where the pre WWII ""Realpolitik"" began - France and UK were *also* fearful of a leftwing spain. Mousoulini also got word that the USSR was 'embarrassed' by the spanish republic and did not want to immediately help the Republic against the rebellion. Internally, USSR did not want to support the Republic too swiftly, because they thought that it would force France and UK's hand into siding with the fascists over the USSR! USSR could not compete if all of western europe was fascist-aligned. Yet, Germany/Italy could not compete if all of western europe was Republic/USSR/communist aligned.

Once Mousoulini reached this conclusion that France, UK, and USSR would not assist the Republic, he backed Franco Francisco, providing air support which helped bring a bulk of Franco's army in Morrocco over the strait of gibralter (which was blockaded by the Spanish Republic's navy). With Mousoulini's military aid, Franco's rebellion went from hopeless, to achievable. Then Hitler backed Franco with military aid as well.

France and UK and other powers in Europe (and USA) decided to form a non-intervention pact. They bravely announced that no one should get involved in the civil war. In spite of the fact that Germany and Italy had already committed troops and air support to the rebellion. In many ways, this interventionist pact was bullshit anyway. My favorite example is how in USA, aerospace companies were prohibited from sending supplies to the Spanish Republic, but oil companies were allowed to transmit huge sums of $$$ and oil to Franco's side.

 USSR then decided to back the Republic with shipments of military equipment, but it was too late. 

Churchill would later chastise UK for not intervening on the Republic's side but it was too late - The Republic had been overthrown. He lamented that UK's inaction created another Fascist state. Germany and Italy also used Spain as a 'training ground' by creating battle-hardened veterans as well as improving their technology in their air force. All of which would bite UK and France's asses once the fascists turned their sites on the rest of the 'centrist' powers in Europe.

Franco's rebellion won, and tens of thousands of spaniards would be killed and executed by Franco's side. (Paul P. Preston would write on this in ['The Spanish Holocaust'](https://www.amazon.com/Spanish-Holocaust-Inquisition-Extermination-Twentieth-Century/dp/0393345912) ). To this day, mass graves in Spain are still being discovered.

Long story short, Hitler (and mousoulini) were very concerned of the opinions of UK, France, and other centrist countries. They played politics better than the communists though, by stoking the fears of the centrists that the commies were just as bad, or the real danger. We get glimpses of that rhetoric these recent years (IE. ""Antifa is just as bad as the fascists"" ""both sides are to blame"" etc)"

I can only assume this argument was made by people who threw like Garo Yepremian. The second theory was that shoes and socks absorb kinetic energy, so kicking flesh-to-leather created more torque; proponents of this hypothesis claim barefoot kicking naturally disappeared after the advent of the American soccer shoe (soccer cleats have less padding at the point of contact).
