> Or they just put it in the cage to just air dry for hours and hours.

My dogs have always been done in 2-2.5 hours

> It’s a very stressful room in the back it’s very very loud.

Most groomers I've been to get very loud. The last place I went had the crates right in the room where they groomed everyone. I'd often walk into a barking fest. Loud happens when you have a place with multiple dogs in the same room. However, that's not exactly my experience with Petsmart. The Kennels are in a separate room so that noise doesn't affect the grooming happening and the grooming noise doesn't affect the kennel Ed dogs.

> They never ever ever brush their teeth, barely clean your ears. They’ll maybe attempt their nails but they’ll usually say oh I couldn’t do it they were too difficult.

Nails and ears have always been done.

> They one hundred percent will never ever take your dog outside to relieve itself

I have never expected a groomer to do this. When I drop my dog off at a groomer I expect them to get groomed and kept safe inside and that's what happens. Plus, they can hold it for 2-3 hours.

> They’re all supposed to have water but it’s disgusting because of all the blow drying it just blows all the fur around the room and there’s literally just an inch of fur on top of the water bowls unless someone takes the time to constantly clean them which they don’t.

Again, the Kennels with water aren't in the room with the blow driers.

> I can promise you most of the dogs are too stressed out to even drink water anyways.

This happens with many dogs anywhere. My dogs don't eat the first day of boarding anywhere. For a few hours, they don't even need to drink.

> Spend the extra $10-20 and go to a private groomer where you can make an appointment bring your dog and pick it up as soon as it’s done there’s no need to leave the dog in the crate all day long in such a horrible environment.

A private groomer is actually cheaper for me, but I haven't been as happy with the job as I have with petsmart. Especially since what you describe is what I get at Petsmart - Petsmart is actually faster than the last private groomer I went to, too.

I'm sure there are petsmarts and petcos that aren't together, but clearly some have their shit together. One of my dogs has had a rough groom - just not even and missing spots - and petsmart was quick to correct it. But the groomer we typically go to has been nothing but professional and wonderful with my dogs. 

There's always a risk anywhere - private groomers aren't automatically going to do everything right. My dog got his worst groom at a private groomer. The best thing is to talk to other people in the area that are also getting their dogs groomed; find what works for them and how their dogs are. That's actually how I ended up with my particular petsmart groomer. In other areas it might be a private groomer that is recommended. Either way, I felt that such a bold rejection would be complimented with a much different experience."

That said, like with a normal dog, during that 'teenage phase' a lot of that gets thrown out the window. Sometime between 8 and 18 months (depending on the dog and maturity level) that phase starts and a wonderfully trained dog can appear to be a menace. A lot of times this really is just a phase, but maturity can bring out behaviors not seen in youth - fearfulness, aloofness, aggression, etc. And that's a big reason why no reputable service dog training program will release a dog younger than 2 or 3.

I do think a smaller dog would be best for you, mostly because you want to bring the dog places with your child and, honestly, it's just easier when the dog is small. Not to mention, less chance of a dog knocking everyone down. 

If you're willing to give up the off-leash requirement (at least off leash outside of a secure area), a Cairn Terrier is a wonderful family dog. They're great around kids, very forgiving of stepped on toes, tough, but also sensitive. Probably one of my favorite smaller breeds to recommend to a family. They're going to be a little more stubborn with training, but with plenty of motivation (I'd recommend doing at least a puppy and/or beginner class) are actually quick to pick up on things. My sister's Cairn goes everywhere with her - sometimes that independent comes in handy, since he typically doesn't care at all about what's going on around him. Being more independent, they're also pretty good dealing with family life - they're not constantly 'up your butt' when you're dealing with a tantrum-y kid.

Miniature Poodles and Bichons are also good, smaller family dogs. My personal preference of the two would be the Bichon, but both are great little dogs. Smart and pretty easy going. They're going to be a bit more closer to you when home, but should be fine with the sometime hectic family life that comes with children.

I'd recommend seeing what's around you in terms of these breeds and talking to breeders and/or rescues. I also don't think it's too early to look; just be upfront with breeders that you're trying to get an idea now so you're ready when your child is 2+ years old.

dogs,fc5k52d,t1_fc5hd3q,1577459776.0,"For my Standard Poodle, year one is a ton. My vet had a wellness plan for puppies that spread out the cost of everything, so it was $75 a month for all vaccinations, checkups, and it went towards the eventual neuter. Food was $30-45 a month depending on how much he ate (plus some free bags after contacting the company about getting a new puppy). Supplies is where money went flying. I'd say roughly $75-100 a month for supplies, but that's broken down - really it was more like $500 to cover new items (he was my first big dog, so I needed a lot of new stuff) and then every month there was ""Oh, I need this. Oh, I need that"" plus training classes. 

Basically, I try to have $2500-3000 saved up on top of whatever I'll need to pay for the puppy before getting a dog. You don't need as much if you're getting an adult dog, but if you're rescuing I'd still have $2000 saved up for any unexpected medical or behavioral issues that might pop up. What you don't spend of that saved up money is a great start to medical savings and/or can be put into insurance."

$30 for Flea/tick

$20 for Heartgard

$50 for Food (30 lb bag of Purina ONE or Iams, 6/7/small lb bag of Purina, Eukanuba, or Iams Senior food) 

$120 for Medical (Split between savings and wellness plan)

$40 for Other (and what I don't use from this category also goes into savings)

$40 toward the Poodles' eventual grooming needs, though I don't always pay for grooming so this also sometimes ends up in savings or just used for other things 

So, in total, I budget about $260-$300 a month depending (unless, I'm missing something)

I'll break it down below, but things aren't going to always add up the best because not every expense is split evenly between them all. 

For training classes, I spent about $600 on Louis in the first two years. Not sure what we'll do with classes moving forward. I know they'll happen, but not frequently enough that I'd tack it on as a monthly expense. 

------

For just the Dachshund:

$10 Flea and Tick

Roughly $7 for Heartgard

$15 for food

$40 for Medical

$20 for other (treats, toys, etc)

Total: $92, so I'd say $100/month

-----

Standard Poodle:

$10 Flea and Tick

$7 Heartgard

$15-20 for food (the bag that lasts both poodles a little over one month will last one Poodle roughly two months; I'll round up for the total) 

$40 For medical

$20ish for other (toys, treats, etc)

$20 towards eventual grooming needs (again, not always needed)

Total: I'll round up to $120/month

dogs,fc5gmt6,t1_fc4xmn6,1577457042.0,"The only one that says ""Friendly and outgoing"" is Dogster. That's not a breed trait website. It's also not the first list that comes up, it's the fourth. The first three don't say ""Friendly and Outgoing"" and the second and third echo the dog aggressive tendencies of the breed. However, I still prefer to get my information from the actual breed clubs and kennel club websites.

> And yeah, of course some bulldogs are aggressive and dog-aggressive: but so are other breeds of dog

The difference is being dog aggressive is an acceptable breed trait in the American Bulldog, meaning dog aggressive American Bulldogs will continue to be bred. In other breeds, aggressiveness can happen, but they won't be bred by reputable breeders. And, to be clear I never said generally aggressive - I'm talking dog aggressiveness. They're aloof with strangers, not aggressive with strangers, and they should be loyal and not aggressive to their human family. 

> It's said of all dogs that if they suddenly express aggression towards anything that you go to a vet

Of course! And I'm glad you went and found what was wrong. That doesn't change the fact that American Bulldogs are prone to dog aggressiveness as a breed trait. 

It is more harmful to a breed to deny actual breed traits. If someone who owned a German Shepherd that kept escaping to the neighbor's farm and tending their sheep asked for help on how to stop it, would you say ""He's only doing this because it's how you raised him.""

If someone came for help because their Pointer would freeze and point at every critter they encounter on a walk, would you say ""Well, this just how you raised him.""

If someone asked why their Golden Retriever was a natural at fetch, but their Cairn Terrier showed little interest would you tell them ""well, it's just how you raised them."""
