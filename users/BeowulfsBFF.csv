>  
>I  transferred to SU in the Fall of 2018 after some time at a community  college and working full time. Because of the distance from my parents’  house and where the university is located, I had to rent a town house  with 3 other occupants. It went well but as time went, I faced some  financial difficulties in 2019, which forced me to borrow from my parents at the beginning of 2019 as I didn’t have enough for rent or books.  
>  
>This situation worsened soon after as my grandfather, on my mother's side, unexpectedly passed away in February 2019, creating further financial strain as more money had to go to funeral preparations and travel expenses, as they had  to travel to Ghana for the funeral.

**\[You need to explain then what happened following this paragraph, briefly. Did you fail units in this semester with what was going on? All you have is that you worked....and then suddenly you're being put on academic suspension. Just a sentence about what happened before the following paragraph\]**

\--Shortly after  summer, I was made aware that I was to be placed on academic suspension  due to my poor academic performance. I was determined to do what I  needed to get things back in order and sought out the aid of an academic counselor. A success plan was mapped out that would allow me to focus  and make improvements on my grades. The plan was prioritizing my  coursework, which meant taking a 12 credit coursework. Due to the  expense of classes, the amount of money saved and rent, I relied heavily  on loans provided through FAFSA for my classes during Fall 2019 and I  took a job to help with rent.--

\[**The above can also be cut down, but I am not familiar enough with the US system to do it.\]**

>As a result of financial stress, and the requirement to work to make up for it, I fell back in my academic progress and neglected my coursework. *I developed negative thoughts because of my financial situation, which didn’t  reflect well on my classes.* **\[Are you talking about having a diagnosable mental disorder like depression?\]**

\--Along  with better time management and with the opportunity given, I intend to  enroll in the courses that will help me towards my desired degree,  International Relations. Looking to the coming semester, the plan  extends into the fall semester where I intend to enroll in 4 courses. I  again take full responsibility and  blame no one but myself for not  trying and taking my education and the chances I’ve been given  seriously.  I will change that and do better. Giving the opportunity,  I’m confident my performance throughout will be a success.--

**It's not enough to blame yourself for your actions. Yeah, we get it, but more importantly what are you going to do about it? You've said that one of the chief problems you've faced is financial difficulties, and you have neglected your coursework because of it, but you don't really provide an action plan as to why this time will be different. Are you going to be taking fewer units? Will you be working full time and studying a part time load? Are you seeking help about your negative thoughts, if they indeed are ideation or something similarly intrusive and disruptive?**"

There are ways for you to have your future trashed by bad reviews and disciplinary actions following you, but you have to be a massive fuckup and people have to actively be warning each other not to have you in a postgrad position (although the chances you even graduate in circumstances like that aren't that great either, you'd probably be expelled from the institution first unless there was nothing they could do about it.)"

Yes you can do a double major, though it's not the most common path. A major is usually pretty broad in it's title, but there can be some focus within it depending on the units you decide to take. So there is a major in economics, or a major in politics, or history etc. In my case my major is history, and if I was going to a different uni I would have had more choice in the path I took for it, but I go to a smaller place that doesn't have that large a faculty so whilst I had some choice, it was focused more on modern and Australian history (but I loved it). If I went to a different uni I would have had a choice within my history major to focus on a number of different areas, like Ancient Near-East, Australian, American, Medieval or one or two others, choosing units from those streams within the faculty.

For choosing a university, you would be better off having a general idea of the studies you want to do (rather than being dead-set on a particular major), and choose the institution you want to attend from there. You still have two years (? if I'm remembering the UK education system correctly) before you finish, so there may be some changes along the way. Your final choices will be a mix of pragmatism and a wish list, as ultimately you have to apply to unis and courses that will actually accept you (this isn't to say aim low, just that unless you are going to be in the top 5% or less you need to choose between more than just your ultimate dream university)."
