destiny2,feqihhp,t3_eqa33l,1579342234.0,Maybe I've been lucky as far as I've been raiding 'cause everyone's been nice to me. They even teach me tricks and tips. I let them know that it's either my first or that I've only read/watched some of it so at least there's some middle ground here.
GetMotivated,felmt7t,t3_epjjl6,1579225933.0,You can't just stop overthinking. It's like that seed. It's also being watered and growing. We have to know how to uproot that but it's already grown deep that it's become part of who you are and you can't just escape from it.

Lisa though seems very concerning if it were such a concept. Was thinking that she'd be Wrath if anything"

elsword,fciyuqv,t3_ehed3m,1577673117.0,"Elsword > Magic Knight route is a good option and fun to play. Requires some pots spamming at some point but it's just a wall to get over. You could also go the Infinity Sword route which is isn't that reliant on MP pots cause of his Command Attack speed

Eve > Escania route is another PVE friendly one. Once you reach a point where your summons get mana back for you then you'll just be sitting back spamming skills as long as your summons are hitting something. 

Rose > Prime Op, Minerva, or Tempest Buster. Good mana management and clears for these. PO is the one I play here which is the same as Escania. Minerva has a sort of flying mechanic to deal higher damage and mana management is ok. TB is like a burst type character with heavy hitting skills. Buff management is needed."
destiny2,fc52oi9,t3_eg31m2,1577439994.0,"Things that somehow get it back to work. 

* Having more than 4 guardians at it.
* Fast travelling back and forth locations in the EDZ.

Just from experience. It works randomly though so it's not really a workaround."
grandorder,fc4u48t,t3_eg2vgf,1577428498.0,"**Tamomo Cat** \- Like a starter Pokemon. Been my partner (outside of Mash ofc but we'll get to her later) since the start. I really like that somewhat free spirited personality and she can cook too!

**Elizabeth Bathory -** She's an idol and although everyone makes fun of her singing, I really appreciate her effort to try and change herself. The Halloween events are fun as well as her alters. Would like to add them here as well but I'll stick with her.

**Kiyohime -** Got her on that first FP roll and my partner in farming along with Cat. Craziness aside, I like that, despite her being a Beserker, she's somewhat calm which isn't a rare thing now that there are other Berserkers that can hold a conversation and aren't all ""ARRRRTTHHHUUUURRRR!!!"" or ""===---===--------\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"". Not that it's a bad thing but getting introduced to Fate/Zero first made me think that all Berserkers are out of reach and just have destruction in mind.

**Leonardo Da Vinci -** First 5\* as it was just on a whim that I tried and spend a ticket on a banner with her in it. Wasn't even expecting to get something grand but lo and behold! She really grew on me as the story progressed as the acting director and a big sister of sorts. Was really bummed out at first during the Camelot Singularity when I thought she was gone and (I think or maybe I'm wrong) there was only a hologram of her on the Workshop. She messes around with you from time to time but that's the fun of it!

***Honorables*** \- Mash isn't a servant right? I mean that's what I've come to understand since Galahad just lent her some of his powers so she's a pseudo-servant right? But either way I'd include her with Holmes as I've come to a conclusion that she idolizes him very much so I'll include Holmes as well. I might mention everyone here so I think a last Feast would be nice but if it's just really four then those are mine."
