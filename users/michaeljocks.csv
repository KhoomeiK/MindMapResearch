depression,fdc2ej7,t3_ekby0j,1578265754.0,That sucks ass. Itll take a while to move on but keep your chin up. Work on yourself and try to do fun things. Good luck
howto,fd5gt9u,t3_ejomel,1578177475.0,Cut it where its attached to the hood maybe? Thrn you can replace it. You gonna need tiny snips. Good luck
howto,fd5fbfe,t3_ek15x3,1578177061.0,What erebus said. Then theres the finding work and accomodation part which can be challenging. Write a good cv. Having a translated reference/recommendation letter helps as well. Good luck.

Adulting,f7dt1my,t3_dvavnz,1573628612.0,Just my 2 cents but I'd try and find something else or you might end up screwing up your body and mental health. I used to have an inverted sleeping schedule and it's REALLY hard to set it back to normal. Your eyes and body need sunlight to be healthy and function properly. You're already feeling the side effects let like being tired all the time and crashing. Good luck
