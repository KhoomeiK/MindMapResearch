Economics,ff221i6,t1_ff1x1ic,1579491681.0,"Where in Angola would she have gotten a loan? Angola is a desperately poor country. She would have had to go to a Western bank to get financing; I seriously doubt they'd loan that much money to some random non-connected local woman. 

That's why oil E&P in poor countries is basically always done by Western firms, by the local state-owned oil company (which got its initial capital stake through expropriation and/or taxation), or some combination of the two. There are no individual private oilmen in those countries because there would have to be functional private capital markets to make that possible. 

So basically, if Isabel dos Santos really followed the rules, she would have applied for a job at the state oil company as an engineer or a manager of some sort, and worked her way up the corporate ladder to become the CEO. And at that point, she would probably be making a very high salary, own some stock in the company and have a nice life (as do CEOs of majors like Exxon and Chevron) but she would not be a billionaire. The only way to become a billionaire in oil in those countries is to be a relative or friend of the ruling government and to lie, cheat and steal your way into that kind of money. 

I would say the structural issues in most impoverished countries result in it not being possible to become a billionaire there without engaging in corrupt or illegal practices."

It wouldn't be possible for her to become as wealthy as she has if she had done nothing corrupt.

She didn't produce or invent anything. The oil was in the ground in Angola before she ever existed as a living organism. 

In order for her to become wealthy through resource extraction legitimately, she would have had to buy drilling rights on land and hope that she drilled a particularly productive well, use the profits from that venture to buy more rights and drill more wells, and so on. Who would loan her the money to buy the first drilling rights if she weren't the president's daughter? Even the most successful wildcatters nowadays don't become *billionaires* doing that - we're talking hundreds of millions at most. 

Isabel dos Santos is wealthy because she did the equivalent of if, say, Ivanka Trump were named the CEO of ExxonMobil because Donald Trump ordered the board to do so, and then he also ordered the board to issue new shares in the company to give her a massive ownership stake. And then he told the Treasury Secretary to issue a loan to a shell company she controlled so she could buy more businesses - say, telecoms.

I'm the business manager for a specialist physicians group. We don't do anything involving surgery so I'm not sure what you were told, but when a patient asks us for an estimate of how much something will cost, we have an online system we use where we enter their insurance info, and then enter the codes for the procedures they would be having and it shows us how much of that the insurance will pay and how much the patient would be responsible for. But it's assuming everything is in network (which is fine for us because as I said we aren't dealing with anesthesia and all that). 

In the future, the only thing I can really think of would be to ask if anesthesia/pathology is in network for your insurance. One of the issues is going to be when the surgery is scheduled: hospitals may have a certain anesthesiologist available at a certain date/time who may be in your network, but on another date/time they won't be there and it would be a different anesthesiologist who's not in network.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with all this and for what it's worth I tend to think there should be a rule that everyone who's working at a given hospital should take whatever insurance the hospital does so you don't have to ask all these different people (particularly in an emergency when you might be unconscious let alone have the ability to check)."
personalfinance,fdliwy7,t3_em0azq,1578525020.0,"There are, broadly, two kinds of medical bills you encounter after a surgery: hospital bills and professional bills.

Hospital bills are from the hospital to cover the cost of the surgical room, recovery, equipment, supplies, the nurses and other staff, etc.

Professional bills are from the actual surgeons and doctors who treat you. What seems to have happened is that your surgeon was in-network for your insurance, but your anesthesiologist wasn't and the pathologist who analyzed any biopsies also wasn't.

Your insurance company won't pay for the anesthesiologist or the pathologist because they probably aren't in-network. 

>The hospital is saying they can't see these bills or do anything about them.

That's because they only send out bills for hospital charges (the operating room, supplies, etc). They don't have anything to do with the doctors' bills - those are handled by their own medical practices. This is really confusing to people because those medical practices are often located in/near the hospital and may have a direct relationship with the hospital.

Did US Anesthesia Partners actually bill your insurance? Does the bill you got from them include any line indicating an insurance payment or adjustment? If not, you may need to provide your insurance information so they can file a claim. (You will be financially responsible for what's left over after insurance pays, or if they are not in-network for your insurance.) I would do the same thing for the pathologist.

Once that has happened, you will still need to figure out a way to pay whatever balance you do owe. I would contact them directly to work out a payment plan. If you don't and several months go by, there's a good chance they will send the bill to a collections agency and those people are a lot more unpleasant to deal with."
