facepalm,fckwun0,t3_ehm5vj,1577734910.0,"I mean, to be fair. BP didn't cause the oil spill, the company they hired (TransOcean) caused the spill. If you watch the official safety report/breakdown of the event. Many many many safety features and fail safes failed, due to improper installation and operation. If you hired a tree cutting service to do some work in your yard, and they dropped a tree on the powerlines, that wouldn't be your fault, would it? So imo BP gets more blame than they are due"
