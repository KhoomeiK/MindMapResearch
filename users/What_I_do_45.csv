misanthropy,ffao3fr,t3_ens9ep,1579740501.0,"The thing is, American culture has BARELY changed in the last 50-70 years. The only significant improvements we seem to make, in a cultural sense, are accepting a more egalitarian view of the world and other people, while rejecting hate and xenophobia. Even then, those social improvements are slow as hell to come to fruition."

AskReddit,ff7q6k8,t1_ff73tp1,1579655672.0,"A lot of people will construe having certain kinds of debt to be ""good"" debt, in that the debt is meant to have some kind of significant pay off. Examples include a mortgage or student loans. The problem with this thinking is that, no matter what kind of debt you're talking about, the debt itself in not necessarily supposed to ""pay off"" at all; it's just a means of paying for something."
AskReddit,fep5k3u,t3_eq1wzh,1579312617.0,"Having absolutely no problems whatsoever in regards to interacting with other people. Mumbling, social anxiety, self consciousness, etc. These things ruin whatever chance I have at a decent life, and it is damn near impossible to fix any of it."

depression,felo2et,t1_fe63xk8,1579226794.0,"I just can't do life. I feel defeated at just the thought of doing anything more than purely coasting through life (although I do the best job possible at work). The unpredictability and fickleness of life's circumstances are not something I believe myself capable of overcoming. I don't necessarily subscribe to the view that my life is dictated by extrinsic factors, but I also do not fully believe that my own actions are or will be enough to do anything with my life. 

I'm also just too weak to let go of every hedonistic pleasure I squeeze out of life just to start being able to support myself somehow. I'm all for working full time and more to earn a living, but at this point in my life I've taken myself to a place where I have no friends, no connections, no skills, no assets, and a metric shit ton of psychological problems that make it difficult for me to get along socially with people beyond basic pleasantries, which never really feel all that pleasant anyways, again due to shit I suffer from like social anxiety, which I don't think will ever go away. I've followed advice, it hasn't gotten better. 

I just can't start from the bottom. I'm too weak to even try and I have absolutely no faith that I will figure things out anyways, and NOT for a lack of trying. I feel humiliated, I feel like a coward. I definitely can't call up any old friends to catch up, for instance. I just don't have the courage, and frankly I don't seem to have the mental capability of steering any kind of social relationship any which way. I don't really understand why I'm like this, and I can't exactly afford to be able to figure it out, not that I want to ever be studied or evaluated. If I find out I'm anything apart from ""normative"" on a fundamental psychological level, then I'm not even sure I'd have anymore will to live anyways."
politics,fei93s1,t1_feh1nwo,1579133034.0,"The only time the media was able to truly boost Trump's candidacy was in 2015 when his campaign was young and it was still possible for the media to either flush him out among the numerous other 
Republican candidates, or push him to the front of everyone's minds. The dynamics here are completely different with Sanders.  The only kind of media coverage that would help Sanders is that which is not biased against him. Good luck convincing huge mainstream media conglomerates to give Sanders any significant positive coverage."

depression,fe5yevb,t1_fe5scia,1578877717.0,"I don't have the strength to ""be"" anything. I just don't want to play a part anymore. There's nothing I want to be because I'm not strong enough to be a willful member of a community/society/family/group."
depression,fe5og6y,t1_fe5ndmm,1578872159.0,But if I care about my life then I have to care about other people due to morals and I just can't handle that kind of emotional weight in my life anymore. I can't deal with other people in this life anymore. I just don't want to. I don't have the courage or the ressiliance to even be a part of society or a community. I just can't let anyone in at the most basic levels. And on top of that I'm just not cut out to navigate this here modern economy. There's just too many people and I'm so much lesser in terms of capability than most of them.
depression,fe5n4bd,t1_fe5jrpm,1578871581.0,"I mean, what about any of it? I guess I can come up with arbitrary reasons to keep going, but I don't really want to be in that headspace. I don't want to go back to a place where I am happy in spite of my problems. I don't want to go back to a place where I am happy to accept the responsibility of life. I just can't go down that road. I can't lead a life."

depression,fe5kc4h,t3_enfyh1,1578870487.0,I don't know. All I know is that for the last several years of my life I have had an at BEST completely neutral role in everyone's lives because I can't tell if I'm liked either. Well I'm insecure about it so that's one part of the problem but at the same time I just can't vibe with people like I used to.

depression,fdfdcmv,t3_ekwbox,1578359037.0,"I mean I just don't have any faith in myself or my life and I have been at this point for years. I don't ever actually think of my life in terms of ""when will it get better"", because ""it"" is very simply my life. I guess I've pretty much resigned to moping about it, but to me it's not moping. I feel it's logical and justified that I feel the way I do so I don't really see it as a ""thing"" i.e. ""depression"". I just haven't really had a reason to believe I have the power/capability to either change my life for the better or to just feel calm and happy."

movies,fcs1cfz,t3_eiaa06,1577909898.0,"I never even really considered relatability THAT much of a factor in whether or not I enjoy a movie, unless the plot contains elements that are SO foreign to the human condition that it is perplexing, and that's a hypothetical; I can't really think of a film I've seen that's that weird. 

It seems like the main complaint people have with the movies you listed are that their main characters are very affluent, and they're turned off by that for personal reasons I guess."

depression,fcdhlct,t3_egzppn,1577610097.0,I did a lot of lifestyle shit but none of it is substantial and it's actually really hard to give a shit about any of it when your very means of having something to eat or a roof over your head are tenuous.

depression,fcdfmoz,t1_fcd1zgy,1577609557.0,"The only thing that went well for me this year is that I got a job and I've had it since. But I think that being a good thing is subjective since I'm still a goddamn wage slave. There is nothing good that can come of the future. I just want death. I just want it all to be over. To where I just don't have to think about anything anymore, or do anything."
depression,fcdd9ub,t1_fcd3ys0,1577608979.0," Minimizing my problems does not absolve me of them. It does not absolve me of my responsibilities, nor does it actually change the bleak reality in front of me.  I can try to fix those problems all I want, doesn't mean they will be solved. I can't accept life. I can't deal with all of the shit in it. I just can't. I don't want a fulfilling life. I just want to be strong enough to be confident in death, because nothing good can come of life.

And all of those things are real concerns. I just don't want to exist anymore, to even have to think about life."

depression,fc41d5q,t3_efukvu,1577404059.0,"I can't even really confidently ""make"" a joke. Sometimes one will come up, but most of the time, I feel like humor in general just falls flat for me.
