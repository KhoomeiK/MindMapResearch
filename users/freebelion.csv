The better one among the two becomes obvious and most-preferred choice, while dissimilar items/people are ignored.

I am thinking that the same theory may explain why poor citizens are more likely to blame poorer immigrants for unemployment and loss of welfare, because the immigrants seek for similar jobs and welfare support. Extremely wealthy individuals will be too few and too distant to be suspected as the culprits, though they may be the ones who are hoarding the wealth that will not trickle down."
