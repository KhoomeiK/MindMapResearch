depression,fdzbx8a,t3_cml6ni,1578788585.0,"I’m so close to giving up, all I ever feel like is that I’ve disappointed everybody around me. I can’t seem to make anyone happy, let alone myself."
depression,fdp3mxu,t1_fdl5ddq,1578619219.0,coffee always makes my anxiety 10000x worse
depression,fdl4vyi,t3_cml6ni,1578517086.0,"My therapist brought up possibly going on meds again, I’m really very hesitant against the idea. 


Gonna give myself another month or so, and if I still feel like this, will re consider"
depression,fdgthmc,t1_fdgtdrj,1578407914.0,Do you find that you end up staying up because of it?
depression,fdgsy39,t1_fdgbcwm,1578407514.0,"I relate super hard, don’t know if I’m just much more socially dependent than most, but the second I’m alone for too long, the unwelcome thoughts make their appearance again"
depression,fdgsux8,t1_fdg0qtk,1578407449.0,"A few of my friends who have done study abroad and said they’ve found it isolating as well usually say the second semester goes better than the first, I’m not sure why though, but hopefully you’re able to relax and recharge at home :) best of luck with everything, you’ll get through this!"
depression,fdfkoz9,t1_fd6l40g,1578363944.0,it's unfortunate that ghosting is now almost socially accepted
depression,fdfkmmv,t1_fd88446,1578363901.0,"Studying abroad can be an amazingly enriching experience, or also terribly isolating... i'm sorry its more of the latter for you. How much longer do you have at this place?"
depression,fdfju6a,t3_cml6ni,1578363389.0,"my usually innocent dreams are now plagued with horrible, horrible nightmares of awful things happening to those closest to me - sleeping was my only safe space :/"
depression,fdfjk88,t1_fdey1mh,1578363203.0,"hi, do you find that this comes about when you're alone? Or when you're with your friends/bf"
depression,fdfjhfa,t3_cml6ni,1578363150.0,"constantly stuck between a loop of not wanting to be labeled as a drama queen (i.e. people have it worse, suck it up), not wanting to be a burden on anyone (nobody ever owes you anything), and not wanting to become codependent on someone (if they leave, you're in an even worse place than where you were before)

seems like the natural answer is to do things that feel good for ME... but in a world of balancing friends, family, jobs and education, I always feel like it's just easiest to put myself at the bottom of the ladder."
depression,fdfj0mu,t1_fdezai3,1578362835.0,"hi, i'm going through exams as well this week and definitely do relate to a lot of what you've said, baths are fantastic, hope you manage to have one tomorrow - best of luck with your exam :)"
depression,fd6lnvj,t3_cml6ni,1578192818.0,"Not to sound like a stereotype, but the only way i've managed to get myself to sleep the past few nights is by crying myself to sleep. 

It worries me, but whenever I bring up my emotions to those around me, I immediately feel like they're invalidated or I feel like a burden for bringing it up in the first place. 

It's a shame I feel like this, because on paper I have it all - a roof over my head, supportive parents, a promising degree, a loving boyfriend and some really incredible friends, but if I'm honest none of these things truly make me feel better about myself. 

I have a therapist but I struggle to even be truly honest with her. I'm not sure why I feel like I have to maintain appearances with her. I guess I'm scared to disappoint her, or that she'll realize that there isn't actually an objective problem with my current life, and cut the sessions we have together. An irrational fear, I know. 

I have a personal journal, but there's something about shouting this all into the internet void that's more cathartic."
SuicideWatch,fd6d9jt,t3_ejysqk,1578189204.0,"Interesting, i've felt this way but never actually seen it put into words. I always fantasize about abandoning everything and everyone I know and running away to the farthest place possible, so I guess it's kind of similar - don't want to die, but also don't want to continue existing in the world I'm in."
LoveIslandTV,fd6b5d8,t1_fd3l4jj,1578188287.0,you can't seriously believe that alexandra is all natural...
