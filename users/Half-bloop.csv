OCD,fe5sxnn,t3_envsrp,1578874242.0,"The only way to know for sure is to be diagnosed by a qualified professional. But the key components are

- obsessive, intrusive thoughts, often accompanied by anxiety.

-compulsive actions (usually repetitive) usued to stop the thoughts/anxiety

From BeyondOCD.org:

A.¬†¬† ¬†Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:

Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):

1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or impulses that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.

2.The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).

Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):

1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.

2.The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive."
OCD,fe5ry8r,t1_fe44fk1,1578873651.0,"That first sentence after the colon should be broken up. It's honestly still hard to read tbh.

I used to have the obsession that I might have NPD, and at one point was convinced. I eventually let go of that obsession or I switched to something else. I think we with OCD can have knee-jerk responses in conversations, such as confessing to something we didn't do or lying for no real reason. That being said, asking for reassurance is counterproductive to OCD recovery."

OCD,fe3owbe,t3_enq6sc,1578851450.0,"I have the compulsion to overshare about things I go through. Like when I did inpatient at the hospital, I got home and told all my friends, anyone who would listen. But it created for many a lens through which they would see me from then on. I regretted that. Or when I am having a conversations with someone close I may over explain my actions and the motivation behind them. What I have found looking back is that there were some things that I should have kept to myself. It complicated relationships."
bipolar,fe3nhya,t3_enq887,1578851007.0,"I think he has a very misinformed perspective about mental illness and medication. Maybe it is someone who has been raised by strict parents who had the ""handle your shit"" attitude. It sounds like they are suffering greatly üò¢. Lashing out at you because they are envious of how good you are doing with the help of medication. That you are okay with being on medication. I think it's important that you keep your distance with that person. And like another commenter said, talk to h.r. or a manager you trust about it."
