True.  But remember it started with this claim: ""That may be true, but good luck getting a good job in game dev if you can't use some trig to get an object to rotate towards a mouse cursor, let alone harder stuff.""

Except, as proven, it's quite possible to get a game dev job while failing that criteria."

Used to be a game dev, actually ran a small studio and hired other developers as well.  Never used that as a screen.

Heck, in 3D it's relatively trivial:

     Vector3.RotateTowards(transform.forward, targetDirection, singleStep, 0.0f); 

[https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.RotateTowards.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.RotateTowards.html)  


No trig needed.

Turns out there's no built-in 2d method I can find, instead, a google finds this:

`Vector3 vectorToTarget = targetTransform.position - transform.position;`

`float angle = Mathf.Atan2(vectorToTarget.y, vectorToTarget.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;`

`Quaternion q = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);`

`transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, q, Time.deltaTime * speed);`

While this answer does involve more complex math... the solution was achieved by google-fu... not math-fu.

&#x200B;

Which is interesting on a couple of levels:

1. I'd not be able to solve this with a pencil and paper.  It's not my specialty or skillset.
2. Any remotely decent developer would have found the same answer within 2 minutes with a google search... rendering the challenge somewhat mute.

Summary:

While it's not a bad skill-set to have... developers are not made by trivial knowledge.  Developers are made by being able to provide solutions to problems.

For example - if I was interviewing as a game dev today - the very first thing I'd do is to research the kinds of interview techniques and puzzles that are popular.  Then I'd practice them.  Then I'd nail them in the interview, as well as selling my other technical and soft skills.

Does this make me good at math?  No.  It makes me good at recognizing a problem, researching it and implementing a solution."

If someone can't live within their means, that's usually because of one of two reasons:  


1)  They literally just don't have enough resources.  This sucks but can be solved by applying more resources (e.g. better job, social safety nets, etc).  


2)  They aren't wise with the resources they have - the poverty mindset.  This is primarily a mental condition... and it doesn't matter how many resources you give them, they'll end back where they started because you haven't fixed the mental/educational issues first.

Agreed, but that doesn't mean that you can't make an effort to explain your position.

Dihydrogen monoxide is capable of killing large groups of people in very short periods of time (for example in 2004 it killed over 200,000 people in a single event).

Yet I'm not seeing you call to ban it.  So simply killing large numbers of people in a short period of time is not, in itself, unique to 'assault rifles'.  What is it you are trying to achieve?"

And?  

>could it be because that time of force has been used by random people in the past to kill 50 people in 2 minutes?

And?

Dihydrogen monoxide is commonly available, kills thousands every year in us alone (including mass deaths) and causes billions of dollars in damage.  Yet rather than banning it, governments around the world fund it and use tax dollars to put it in every home.

>Here's the fact though, they are used for mass shootings. That's why we are having this argument. Vegas and El paso, two very deadly shootings, both used an assault weapon.

First off, what is an 'assault weapon' - it's hard to have a discussion when we're using vague, poorly defined terms.

Second, they are just \*one\* weapon that is used in mass killings - which is just a small fraction of all killings.  For example, from the reporting so far no \*rifle\* was used in this church shooting.   Why this obsession with one kind of weapon?

>These are cases i remember off the top of my head.

So you're relying upon your own 'top of head' memory to form an opinion about an entire class of weapons.  I wonder, why are these the ones you remember?  Is it because they are statistically significant, the greatest causers of death... or just the most popular events in recent media history.

At this point, I'm not even clear on what you're trying to achieve.  Even if we banned 'assault weapons' (which is a poorly defined term, actual assault weapons e.g. those used by the military with fully auto-fire aren't actually used in these shootings) - what do you think that would do?  Do you think it'd reduce gun deaths?  Reduce homicides?  Reduce mass killings?  Reduce media hysteria?  Make you feel safer?
