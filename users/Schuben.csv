 For Elite I mapped tons of button combinations (through the game menu mostly) but also setup Steam controller functions and layers to access all of the controls a normal controller wouldn't be able to do for when im in different situations like mining, combat and planet exploration. It was also great for using for mouse-look and I briefly setup the gyro to be used as mouse-look but I found that more frustrating just because of the sensitivity. 

 For Rocket League I setup custom trigger zones for boosting and changed the assignments for air rolling, etc so I never need to move a finger from an individual button. Works great.

I also played around with some of the macro functions and was able to program the palm triggers to do a half-flip then half roll to change directions quickly and do a flip-cancel for fast kickoffs.

It also helps signify that you no longer need the variable or don't need to use the current reference stored in the variable. This can help represent the process of your code, free up memory, or reduce the chance that you use the wrong reference if you forget to reassign the variable the next time you need it.

Imagine in excel that you assign the 'wb' variable to your current workbook to perform a function.  In the next section of code, you need to reassign 'wb' to a workbook with a specific name or property.  If you assign 'wb' to Nothing between these actions it ensures that you don't accidentally carry over the current workbook reference into some other code that shouldn't be using that reference or could cause harm if your re-assignment doesn't work as intended.  You were done with the code that specifically requires the 'current workbook' so you clear that reference.

Im also assuming some other bad practices like using the same variable for different purposes, but we'll ignore that for the sake of argument!"

With a 7-segment display there are 128 different combinations that can be recognized (yes, even completely blank counts) and I programmed in 36 different characters.  I could probably do more but at some point it would make some characters impossible to enter.  For now it is possible to enter every number and (I think) every character below.

The full list of recognized characters:  0123456789AbcCdeEfghJlLoquUX °\_-\`',""=

'=' and 'X' are special because they trigger the input check and reset functions, all of the others are character inputs.  The space "" "" character actually inputs if you check a box and then uncheck all boxes and is nearly impossible to spot that it recognized it.  I realized after I recorded this that I screwed up the placement of the double quotes, which should be on the top left and right segments instead of the bottom left and right.  Oh. Well.  My first iteration of this included a ""Submit"" button to confirm the character entered, but the instant recognition was certainly much more dickish.  The only 2 possible starting positions are the top segment and the bottom right segment, all of the others will input a character: grave for top left, single quote for top right, hyphen for middle, comma for bottom left and underscore for bottom.

I'd be willing to share some of the code if someone wants to play around with it, but since it's tied to an excel workbook with a user form it probably wouldn't be as easy to do.

Edit: To provide more info on how it works--It encodes each display as a binary bit and then compares the resulting integer to a list of recognized integers and then executes the code to insert a character or perform a function.  I didn't do it in the traditional 7-segment order of starting at the top, going clock-wise and ending in the center, I did mine top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

Does your code have Application.ScreenUpdating = FALSE  at the start and = TRUE at the end to keep the screen from flashing and cell value updates from being displayed as they happen?

Edit:  Fixed it to ScreenUpdating.  It's still early, coffee hasn't kicked in and I'm on mobile.  Oops.

Another helpful setting is Application.EnableEvents = FALSE/TRUE but depending on your code you might not want to disable this but it can make execution faster."

excel,fcxsll4,t3_ejhr0e,1578069879.0,"Is there only a single matching line for each WO# on sheet2?  If you only need a single result (row) on your lookup than VLOOKUP should be fine.  If you need to return ALL matches to a particular WO# then you'll need something a little more dynamic or even a VBA macro.

VLookup(lookup\_value, table\_array, col\_index\_num, \[range lookup\]) works like this:

* lookup\_value:  This is the value (on your assigned list of numbers) you want to search for.  Pretty straightforward.
* table\_array:  This is the array (""selection box"") of cells you want to search in.  The leftmost column of the selection is where it will try to find your lookup\_value.  You can't look up a value in any other column but the leftmost column.  You need to expand this selection as far as the column you want to return, even if it includes columns you don't care about.
* col\_index\_num:  This is the column inside of your table\_array selection, from left-to-right, the formula will return a value from in the same row where it finds a match to your lookup\_value.  If your selection is 3 columns wide and you want to return the last column, your col\_index\_num will be 3.  You can also have a selection that is 3 columns wide and still return the 2nd column.
* \[range lookup\]:  This is in brackets because it is optional, and the default is TRUE if it is not given.  It is basically asking if your lookup column is sorted ascending A-Z so it knows whether or not it can stop at the closest (approximate) match or if it needs to find the exact result.  You should set this as FALSE so the WO# needs to match exactly."
