And as you know the waiting list, as well as the process of diagnosis itself usually is super long, and often exceeds 1 year. This combined with the fact that people that realize, they might be on the spectrum are often at a bad time in their life, as it means they might be depressed or burnt out or something like that. Thus not being willing to accept (well informed) self-diagnosed people in the community most likely is cause quite a lot of unnecessary harm and suffering to people that are in a relly bad spot anyway. And the change that an informed self-diagnosis is actually wrong is not that big as many thinks, and no matter what, the person seeking diagnosis/explanation by definition are experiencing struggles, and if they are not on the spectrum most likely do have another neurodiverse condition (like ADHD etc). So why not just accept these people (even temporarily) and show a willingness to help? They'll move on to the 'right' community after the diagnosis anyway, so the community would not be flooded with 'wrongly diagnosed' people.

            "Well, if your ADHD examiner is not highly experienced in diagnosing adults on the milder end of the spectrum, they are not qualified to judge no matter what. It's very very tough to diagnose 'high functioning' (sorry for the term) adults. Just keep in mind that Tony Attwood, the world-leading clinical psychologist in the field of  aspergers, did miss to see that his son is on the spectrum until his son was like 30 years old or so. Just that shows how hard it can be to detect it. Also, even ASD experts are not always able to reproduce previous diagnoses from other experts. So it's totally healthy to keep a reasonable skepticism of the clinical diagnoses (as we are talking about arbitrary categories that change on a regular basis anyway).\n",

            "\n",
            "Number 1: Issues with eye contact are 100% explainable with a diagnosis of ADHD, it's a vital part of it too. (I found out during my research, as it was one of my arguments too).\n",
            "\n",
            "Number 2: Also perfectly explainable by ADHD. Stimulants are in no way a wonder drug that cure ADHD. They just improve certain aspects of everyday life. And also the response rate varies widely and finding the right dose of the right drug might be a long journey of several years\n",
            "\n",
            "Number 3: Sensory issues are very very common with ADHD too. Could be smell...touch...or hearing (as it is for me). It is very common to be a symptom of ADHD. Or might even be a sensory integration disorder that is comorbid to ADHD, which is very common too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Number 4: Actually that one point I cannot explain in my case either. Most of the time ADHDers are described as lying very often to hide their failures etc. But I am also pathologically honest. I cannot lie and I do never lie. I do not see the point in it. And I expect the same from my surroundings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Number 5: Also perfectly explainable by ADHD. ADHD symptoms might lead to a clinical presentation that is pretty much indistinguishable from ASD regarding social difficulties. It might have several reasons, e.g. always having been rejected because of impulsive behaviour like anger, or interrupting onversations etc. But ADHD also means that you might actually no pick up social cues because of your lacking attention. And as you can see, that's pretty much the same thing as not understanding social cues at all, at least in the consequences. This might lead to a very similar presentation to ASD symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Number 6: Yep you said it. One prime symptom of ADHD. And again, sounds like you might either not be respondig to your medication, or no thave found the correct dose yet.\n",

            "But it sounds like we are veeeeeeeery close to each other. Your post could have been coming from me. I'm currently mentally assessing if I should go for an ASD diagnosis even though the ADHD expert was disagreeing. But I still had the same thoughts as you did. It just felt like it was pretty accurate, but there was that feeling of not being the perfect fit. Where ASD actually was pretty much explaining all of my struggles. After hearing a lot of experience reports by ASD people and ADHD people I end up identifying with the ASD people almost 100% of the time.  \n",
            "My core thoughts are also the part about lying, which according to my knowledge is not explained by ADHD. But also the special interests. This is also a tricky part, because special interest are also a part of ADHD, expecially due to hyperfocus and deep interest. However they thend to be short-lived and change quickly. However, for me it's way more than a consequence from hyper-focusing or so. It is a clear coping mechanism. And the interest is to such an intensity that I totally freak out if I'm interrupted and that I end up knowing EVERYTHING about certain topics in a very short time.  \n",
            "However, I realized that I will not find an answer to that question online. But I found quite some reports of experts and some primary research that showed me that ADHD and ASD are in no way independent. And that ADHD is a spectrum too, and the two conditions overlap quite a bit. And I've heard experts state that it is not possible even for the biggest experts in the field to distinguish heavy ADHD from mild ASD reliably. One Expert would diagnose one and another one the other condition. Thus, I grew a healthy skepticism of clinical diagnoses as they reflect an arbitrary cutoff. Imagine you just bein a tiny bit below the clinical threshold: it does not mean that your struggles do not exist. There might still be significant autistic traits, but because of an arbitrary cutoff you would not get a diagnosis.  \n",
            "Additionally. What is the reason to get diagnosed after all. Why is it that important to us? Shouldn't it be to get help for our struggles and our symptoms? Having an ASD diagnosis likely would not change anything regarding the treatments you'd receive. So maybe it does not matter what label we carry...it should rather be about getting help and validation for/of our struggles.\n",

People that are sure they've got ASD.

He also pointed out that it is very hard, or basically 'impossible' to diagnostically distinguish mild ASD from ADHD with comorbid social anxiety/ or general anxiety.  I realized that I actually did not know what ADHD actually implied. Long story short: After diving into the scientific literature about ASD and ADHD I realised that quite some experts in the field think that ASD and ADHD together is some sort of a Spectrum. Imagine a Venn-Diagramm with 2 Circles that have a big intersection (see for example [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/63cCOZhzrqo); around minute 2 you can see the diagram).

Obviously it was released in a time of a lot of political upset and protests for women’s rights but in a way I think even if that was her intention in writing the book, it takes away from the purpose of THT because it is supposed to be a cautionary tale of what could happen even in our world.

I thought it was too predictable because from the first chapter of Daisy I knew from a mile away that they were going to make the connection that she was Baby Nicole. And so it all felt really forced and like there were too many connections between the characters. Part of what I love about her writing is that she leaves enough details out of the story and still effectively gets the point across, especially with ambiguity. I would have been fine with the plot if it was told in a different way, because I absolutely love in some of her other works (Oryx and Crake, and even a little bit in THT) where she tells the story of the past and the present simultaneously. I don’t think Testaments had as deep of an effect as she intended by having all of the testaments from people who knew and worked together in the same time frame. There was not a whole lot of variation in the time period covered by the book, and I think it would have felt more multidimensional if the stories and recollections also included more recent reflections, such as Agnes and Nicole telling their recollections in light of recent events. That could’ve shed some light on the turmoil and political atmosphere when and after Gilead falls, and I think that could’ve been more effective, instead of just “they did it, May Day was successful and Gilead falls, The End” \n",

            "There’s nothing wrong with drawing the female form. I take issue with the fact that there’s a homogenous female body type permeating art right now. Women come in tons of shapes and sizes, and fine art/life drawing usually emphasizes this by encouraging drawing a range of nude models (by age, weight, height, bone structure, posture). But popular art hones in on the most classically sexy figure and shoves it down your throat.\n",
