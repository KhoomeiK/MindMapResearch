# MindMapResearch
Development of an NLP algorithm to temporally track patient emotional state using digital footprint

# TIMELINE:

X Start of:

X Week 1: Meetings w/ narges, meetings w/ each other, work schedule all set; Stanford 224n course close to if not entirely completed (Rohan and Kamil); identify professors who could give advice (psychology etc)

X Week 2: Data collected; database and management system in rough stages

Week 3: Data cleaned; database complete and functional; exhaustive list of ideas for implementation of model created and narrowed

^^ very meeting heavy week, can be distributed across week 4 as well if neeeded

Week 4: Papers read to finalize few models to try, tasks delegated as necessary; evaluation metrics set; human accuracy estimated; any data needing labeling labeled; any learning needing to be done identified (torch, deeper research into particular topics or implementation methods)

Spend Week 4-5 learning and implementing/modifying other models on data

Start of Week 6: benchmark results acquired, identify and consolidate where gains and improvements can be made, divide work as necessary

Week 6-9: continue improving model and pivoting as necessary until results are achieved

Week 10: Clean up, comment, and optimize code; throw together react to demonstrate results on real graph (optional)
