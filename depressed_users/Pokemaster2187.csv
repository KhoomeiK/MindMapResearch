SmashBrosUltimate,fdqflx2,t1_fdqdl53,1578665429.0,"I didn’t pick Grookey on my playthrough... regardless, stupid mistake. I was also imagining it without the drum."

I’m almost proud of it, actually."
SmashBrosUltimate,fdq6usd,t3_empm18,1578657400.0,"I don’t actually think Grovyle fits thematically as Sceptile’s echo fighter. They’re very different in design despite being the same evolutionary line, and it’s hard to imagine them the same size. Ideally, Sceptile’s echo fighter would be another starter that had a long tail and similar build to Sceptile...

[EDIT: I’m dumb and thought Rillaboom looked close enough to Sceptile.]"

HongKong,fdlncn6,t3_elvxj9,1578527939.0,"No offence to your excellent compilation, but I think more people would start supporting HK if they could read grammatically correct and precise English."
TruePokemon,fdlmucv,t1_fdkxrla,1578527603.0,"I really don’t mind getting gen 4 remakes as DPP runs very slowly. A 3D, smooth Sinnoh is my dream at this point."
Persona5,fdj4cp4,t1_fdin3ty,1578458106.0,Then what would Blooming Villain be? It sounds very dissonant at first but I can’t name the music genre
HongKong,fdj3uum,t3_el8vcy,1578457730.0,I just wish Furby Lamb has enough brainpower to think her decision over again
depression,fdab92z,t3_ek60m6,1578244029.0,"It’s almost funny how opposite of this I am. I’m a huge piece of shit, always bullying people for basically no reason. I mean it has nothing to do with my depression, I’m just an asshat."
HongKongProtest,fczqv8b,t3_ejg7vd,1578107054.0,"Ignore the other wumao’s comment, he’s just trolling. Realistically, if the protestors were to show up at Govt house (where Carrie Lam resides), there’s a high chance they would get gassed and shot at by police. Both roads nearby are heavily protected by popo and live ammunition could be fired if protestors so much as step near govt house. So yeah, it’s way too dangerous."
GameTheorists,fcwog18,t1_fcsokvn,1578031597.0,"My theory about Arceus and Mew is that Arceus created “all” Pokemon via Mew. First, Arceus created Mew, and then somehow had Mew genetically alter itself into different forms until different Pokemon are formed and they can no longer return to Mew form. Excluding Arceus, this does make Mew the ancestor of all Pokemon. This might not apply with the Creation Trio though.

Disclaimer: I haven’t read OP’s theory yet, but I will go and do so now."

SmashBrosUltimate,fcoj6do,t3_ei7lu3,1577833542.0,"Tbh I don’t like the GC. I think joycons are more suited to my hand size, and the Pro Controller is a step forward for all controller users. Not saying GC is trash, but I think it’s high time people moved on."
HongKong,fcogbpd,t1_fcog3vj,1577831545.0,"Maybe it’s just the internet and my skewed mind. Sorry for being responding aggressively, shoulda thought about the context."
HongKong,fcmtk4k,t3_ei0soz,1577791580.0,This makes me shake with rage. What the fuck? What kind of cum dumpster fire shitholes do this to people?

depression,fcmeqxy,t3_ehs8g5,1577772577.0,"I’m pretty terrible, and situations like these spite me into forgetting about other people’s birthdays. I mean, it’s not like they’ll care whether I celebrate with them or not. I’m a background nobody, and I’ll stay that way."

insaneparents,fbxqrr9,t1_fbx7bji,1577197891.0,You deserve a lot more upvotes for this comment
depression,fbw6i4c,t3_eerge2,1577142064.0,"This makes me feel extremely guilty since I am normally the one dishing out hurt to others. I try not to, but deep down somewhere I know I could stop it if I tried, however I don’t put enough effort into it. It’s fucking disgusting (lol the hypocrisy) and I’m sorry you have to go through that."
TheSilphArena,fbpcx8y,t3_ee3or7,1577019844.0,"At first glance, your team seems pretty weak to RL/grasses- three on the team are weak to it, and assuming your Blaziken runs counter, it will be pretty tough to deal with them. I suggest a harder counter instead of Blaziken and dragonair, as dragonair mostly checks the grasses and can lose to a well placed sludge bomb.

Take this advice with a grain of salt, as I’m not sure what set your Sealeo and Lapras are running. (Actually, both of them seem to have overlapping roles, so maybe dump one of them for a harder grass counter?)"
