starwarscanon,fejgouz,t3_eped05,1579173405.0,"You should definitely watch The Clone Wars, and then Rebels. You might be a little put off as they both start a little rough, but just keep watching and eventually you'll love them. They expand greatly on the films and fill in many of their gaps and give you lots of lore, as well as having some of the best stories and characters of the franchise. (my username says as much.) Of course also check out The Mandalorian too.

For video games you should play Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2. I consider those two quintessential. They will give you a ton of lore and really suck you into the SW universe more than you thought it already did. Other great games to check out are Battlefront 2 (classic 2005 game), Jedi Fallen Order and the Jedi Knight series. If you like RTS (which isn't really my cup of tea personally) check out Empire at War. Perhaps if you like mobile games then Galaxy of Heroes is pretty fun. I also wouldn't cast out the 2017 Battlefront 2, not as good as the classic but definitely still worth playing. I've personally put like 90 hours into it lol. I might also say check out Republic Commando as a lot of people love that game, though me personally I didn't care for it.

I'm not too well versed with the novels but as far as I know you can sort of just pick up any one and start reading. Check your local bookstores for Star Wars novels and read the blurb on the back, and if it sounds interesting then read it. I usually pick up novels set in an era I like or ones that are about characters I like. I kind of take the same approach to the comics.

Some advice I'll also give you that nobody else might mention is that you SHOULDN'T stress about canon. The films and TV series barely acknowledge any comic or novel, if at all. There are many that are no longer canon, but don't obsess over it. Make your own canon and like what you like. The films and TV series are 100% canon, while the other media should be seen as more like bonus content.

Also, check out the 2003 clone wars cartoon too. It's worth watching at least once because it's pretty awesome. And under no circumstances should you watch the holiday special. You'll be happier if you never watch that pile of garbage.

This is my advice to you from a fellow veteran. Welcome aboard! You'll probably never leave now that you're here. I never left. Star Wars still consumes my life to this day."

2meirl4meirl,fe7a33s,t3_enq82e,1578911996.0,"As a kid I always did what I was told and didn't cause trouble. Always focused on school, not on partying or drinking. Always quiet, never being annoying or loud. I thought I was the best for doing that.

Now I'm 20 and yep, here I am. Depressed as fuck and my teenage years wasted. Lonely as shit and aimless. All the highschool friends I had are pretty much gone. 

Good meme."

depression,fdigeci,t3_elhhgz,1578442313.0,"I feel exactly the same way. Can't stand crowds of people and most of the time don't even like communicating much. I crave some alone time, but then I feel too lonely and need someone. I'm a walking contradiction."
depression,fdgye6w,t3_el23c3,1578411356.0,Yep. Every day is the same. Nothing feels real and it feels like I don't exist. Just drowning in despair and loneliness day in and day out.

It's clear this meme was made by a normie. ""Hurr durr just join a community all problems solved!!""

Honestly I'm close to leaving this sub. I really liked this sub for a long time and it was one of my favourites, but with this garbage that has been posted lately it's completely gone to shit."
