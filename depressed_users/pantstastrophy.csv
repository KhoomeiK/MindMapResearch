depression,feksj91,t3_epileo,1579206704.0,I agree with you.  Maintaining life is soooooo much effort.
antinatalism,febnnlb,t3_eo7u21,1578960757.0,I was a planned pregnancy and I feel the same way.
doctorwho,fdlqygh,t3_elzsb2,1578530392.0,"I am one of the fans who was very disappointed with series 11. Series 12 so far has been a step up from the previous. I'm thrilled! Now I am eagerly awaiting the next episodes instead of watching out of obligation.

Some huge improvements:

The companions actually question the Doctor's character instead of just asking plot questions.

Finally, a great villain that allows the Doctor to show what she's made of.

Less expositional dialogue (it's still there but it's acceptable)

The Doctor showing more depth when she sees >!the ruins of Gallifrey!<. I finally see her, without a doubt, to be the Doctor."
doctorwho,fdlq1lh,t3_em00mq,1578529766.0,"Yes, I caught that too. It was great! This was the episode that Jodie became ""The Doctor"" for me. I completely see her as the Doctor after seeing her interactions with the Master and her reaction to the ruins of Gallifrey. I'm thrilled!"
LiveFromNewYork,fdjajbq,t3_eldk8b,1578463313.0,"I personally think the cast is great currently. If the men seem weak is just because this is the strongest group of women in the show's history. Kate,  Aidy, Cecily, Heidi, Melissa constantly are killing. The men are great too though."
depression,fcshczj,t3_eimq4s,1577916573.0,"""It gets Worse"" by Mindless Self Indulgence. I'm not a fan of the band but this song just gets me"
antinatalism,fcpgu93,t1_fcpdk0e,1577863424.0,Well said.  I wish my parents could have seen this comment 32 years ago
Documentaries,fcpflmd,t1_fcp9i45,1577861825.0,"Taking to someone is useless.  I've talked to my parents, my sister, and my friend.  They either say ""cheer up"" or ""that sucks"". My therapist offers good advice but nothing had changed. I know people care but caring does nothing to help."
TalkTherapy,fbnmtcq,t3_edyeu4,1577000178.0,"On the deck of a boat in the middle of the ocean. Sun is shining, no clouds, water is calm."
doctorwho,fbkjlf6,t3_edsd0f,1576951378.0,I think the old episodes are fine as is.  The production errors add to their charm
doctorwho,fbk9xg1,t1_fbjynf1,1576947061.0,"To me, the scene is with the Curator is a non diagetic element added for fan service."
LiveFromNewYork,fbhor5a,t3_edbqlw,1576878756.0,Thank you for reminding me of this sketch. I cracked up just thinking about it!
doctorwho,fbhi5ux,t3_ede1up,1576874224.0,I disagree that the Doctor is a facade. Any version of her is the Doctor
depression,fbe4zb8,t1_fbe3ffp,1576778307.0,"I don't know why they deleted it. It basically said being depressed was like a phone that could only charge to 10% battery power and ""battery saving"" mode was always enabled so its functions were always decreased/limited."
depression,fbd7bcm,t3_ecr9zo,1576750524.0,That's a great analogy
LiveFromNewYork,fbd3a6m,t3_ecp6op,1576744595.0,This is wonderful
depression,fbcx0am,t3_ecnucn,1576736855.0,"Oh yeah. I often used to avoid replying because I have nothing positive to speak about. Eventually, you don't have to worry about it because people will stop contacting you."
depression,fb816aa,t1_fb7zj1z,1576603886.0,"You are so cool for doing so much research. 
I have read that book too and really like its ideas. I believe that depression is downward spiral or ""vicious cycle"". I have tried making the small changes and exercising to start an upward cycle. I had slight success but always slipped back downward."
