The advice to simplify your routine is good. Ask your derm what you should use as basic skincare, that will at the very least least not make your acne any worse. After that, ask them what you should use to treat your acne. Follow their instructions to the letter, and give it at least 3-4 months to see if you can see a difference.

Career,fck2ihb,t3_ehlwua,1577714625.0,"Only give information they ask you for, don't tell them anything they don't need to know as a part of their hiring process, and remember that desperation is as deeply unattractive to employers as it is to a date."
childfree,fck0ajb,t3_ehjzrx,1577712520.0,"Pregnant women creep me the fuck out. All that smugness and stroking themselves and their distorted abdomen. And you just know that either they were tedious, dull and irrelevant to start with, or that they are going to jettison their character and personality at the same moment their vagina rips and they develop lifelong incontinence. Just ugh"
antinatalism,fciqc0p,t3_eh76li,1577667297.0,You should report her to social services (that’s what they’re called in the UK - assuming it’s something similar where you are.) She is abusing the kid and someone needs to intervene.

askwomenadvice,fcff6vm,t3_eh69ha,1577629352.0,"He likes the attention. He gets off on the idea of two women fighting over him. She's annoying, but he's the problem. He could have blocked her months ago, but he chose not to, and instead enables her. He knows this causes you distress, but he doesn't care enough about you to fix it.

You can't change people, but you can change how you deal with a situation. Clearly something needs to change, and in the spirit of ""be the change you want to see in the world,"" that change needs to come from you. You need to decide whether you can live with the current situation, which means no longer finding it distressing, or whether you can't, which means removing yourself from it."

I have commuted in London and NYC, and in terms of logistics, I would say that a regular back pack for your laptop and day-to-day stuff, and a separate bag for your yoga mat, would be the best combination.  Take the back pack off your shoulder when the train is crowded, and you'll be fine."
aspergers,fcbm7ea,t3_egyn5p,1577588470.0,"It depends, as you’d expect. There’s no point in alienating people unnecessarily so I can dial it down a bit if the situation calls for it, but equally I can dial it up if I want to. I don’t dumb down for anyone but I tend to be careful about whether I get my full brain power out in public. It’s easier that way,"

Just because she gave you life doesn't mean your life is hers in perpetuity and you have to do everything on her terms. Live your life, and if she calms down, so much the better. If she doesn't you might need to give her a bit of space so that she doesn't intrude too much on your well-being. Enjoy your trip!"
