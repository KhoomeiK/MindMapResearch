depression,fel8xtj,t3_epm2ch,1579216637.0,"I stayed with my girlfriend while she had depression issues, she had trouble with intense anxiety too. I tried to help her feel better, tried to elevate her mood tried to be there for her. She eventually felt better.
Unfortunately I gave every bit of energy towards her and it made me forgot about how I was feeling.
Eventually I got depressed and she decided to leave me because she ""wasn't able to deal with it""
I hate her for that but I'm still in love with her and that really kills me.

To quote one of my favorite song from Eminem - Kim
I hate you! I hate you! Oh my God I love you. How the fuck could you do this to me?! How the fuck could you do this to me?!"
depression,feiwp0a,t3_epdnfo,1579149279.0,"I fake it everyday as you do.
I work extra shifts because I don't want to be home.
I stopped smoking weed because my therapist suggested it'll help. I still cry everyday
I go to the gym every day, it helps for a moment but I still feel unimportant and dead inside. 
I feel I wasted the last ten years figuring out what I like, what I am, what I want but still feel far from having any answers.

My mind doesn't know what to do with itself."
depression,feival8,t3_ep7rm5,1579148172.0,I work 12hours a day because I don't want to be home. I literally cry when I get back.. I just want to feel something real. I used to play pc but even gaming doesn't give me joy anymore. I go to the gym every day.. At least it gives me something for that moment. I feel I'm waiting to die.

depression,fe8k6jy,t3_enrs4c,1578927060.0,"1. Start with one friend.
2. Write what you really feel. Tell him/her that's how you feel
3. Send your message
4. A real friend will be glad that you messaged him/her
5. People aren't necessarily great at understanding human emotions, so you might need to try with another person.
6. If one juges you for that, you know that person isn't really there for you. 


For the last 10 years I kept everything for me. 
It destroyed me because I expected people to come towards me and help me. You need to go forward and talk.
You're not lying or melodramatic.. You just want to feel better."

teenagers,fclzk5p,t1_fclvsva,1577760358.0,"I'm left speechless.. It's a crazy story. I'm really sorry you had to go through this. It seems it's still not over (if I understood correctly) but I know you'll get through. There is so much you already done! This is the final part, hang on ❤️ 
As for those ""wasted years""? You learned, you adapted and you overcame. Stuff you'll never learn in schools and it makes you stronger than most people your age. I really wish you get out of your ""place"" ? So you can really start enjoying a real life with the real you."

Happy holidays."

We left the movie 40 minutes in and I convo ced my dad to get a refund which he did.

Simply don't go."
