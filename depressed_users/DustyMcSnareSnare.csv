OpiatesRecovery,fef3jxi,t3_eor739,1579047342.0,I have neuropathy/spasticity among other symptoms (multiple sclerosis). My onset wasn‚Äôt until I was in my 5th year of recovery from opioid use disorder. I‚Äôm a medical cannabis patient and this is my chosen form of pain management and symptom management. I‚Äôve found it immensely helpful and provides enough relief to keep suicidality at bay. I do find it alienates me from the recovery community somewhat but that‚Äôs just going to have to be alright.
HSVpositive,feeyaq5,t1_feevs3n,1579043876.0,"Yes I did do additional blood testing lol. Here‚Äôs why. I was seeing multiple physicians at this point‚Äîa gynecologist who then referred me to a dermatologist (and psychiatrist, more on this below) who then referred me to a neurologist (the nerve pain! Omg), and then finally a ears nose and throat specialist who did the biopsy. This was an incredibly frustrating process spanning many months. 

Anyways...why I did the blood test despite the biopsy confirming HSV2. It‚Äôs kind of petty. the gynecologist who I initially saw for the symptoms thought I had ingrown hairs I ‚Äúinterpreted as HSV‚Äù due to sexual trauma (full disclosure, she did a surgical procedure and clinical care following a sexual assault that happened not long before by someone who was known to be hiv positive, this is why but no excuse for this subpar care). She completely negated my symptoms and concerns and while I was following up with her she refused to do any further HSV testing or prescribe antivirals. She was adamant that my antibodies would show on the test in the first 4 months. She kept going on and on about how ‚Äútrauma is stored in the body‚Äù. It got to a point where I thought ‚Äúam I delusional?‚Äù 
I‚Äôm not. I just wasn‚Äôt being heard. 
Anyway, I went back to her and asked for a blood test for HSV and she refused again like all the other times prior. Then I used a strategy I saw on a meme (lol) asking it to be documented in my chart that she refused to order the test and she acquiesced. About 7 or 8 months in...antibodies finally showed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would but I had lab reports in hand from my ENT. We had a long talk about dismissing pain as being related to trauma and how invalidating that is in a pretty vulnerable setting. 
Sorry for the long winded response. This shit has been so ridiculous."

I have ocular, throat and esophageal, and genital HSV.

My doctor told me it‚Äôs not one bad outbreak I have to worry about with my vision but rather my repeated ones.
