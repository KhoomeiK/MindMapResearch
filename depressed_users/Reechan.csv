depression,fekv385,t3_cml6ni,1579208209.0,"Did anyone else notice their voice changes when depressed? Like it's lower, duller, softer, even when an exciting stimulus raises it.  
  
I went to a health center near my house today and feel a little better for pushing myself to go there. Learning something new helps a lot."
depression,fekup8l,t3_epm2ch,1579207980.0,"His belief system is so fucked up. His words say more about his issues than yours, and most of them spell danger.  
  
You were given the opportunity to find someone who loves you for who you are, regardless of depression. Don't give up."
infp,feks09c,t3_ephexq,1579206395.0,"I tried to go to sleep the right way this time by going to bed during that sleepy period my mind goes into around 11 to 1 AM. Usually when I am sleepy, that means it will be a 3 hour nap. I did wake up around 3 because I saw my brother playing on his computer, but I managed to fall right back. However.. I woke up to an intense morning storm outside with hail and the loudest rainfall I heard in a long time. At least I made the goal of waking up early and not as tired as usual!"

infp,feb86jc,t1_fe9st4r,1578956281.0,"Exactly, nobody even knows what I'm saying anymore because I've already lost myself to the fear of the outside world. I just want to get help but I've been too far gone since last year.  
  
I happen to live a block away from the closest health center which is the newest place I'm looking at for my deteriorating mental health. Should have gone there years ago despite people telling me they might not help. Surprisingly, they haven't called yet and I'm supposed to be expecting one today."

fakemon,fdsia4c,t3_emzydd,1578703269.0,"Gladynasto (Gladiator and Dynastinae), the Warrior Pok√©mon. Nearly 5 feet tall and 179 pounds. Bug and Steel type. Evolves from Pupala by level up. Abilities: Heatproof, Battle Armor, and Justified.  
  
Lower ranked Catermor evolved into stoic guardians of Palaeogon's hoarded treasure, but later on in history they rebelled and formed their own organizations to protect victims from their thieving cousins.  
  
Its design enables it to detach its wing covers to fight with 2 shields, 2 swords, or one shield and a sword. It mastered close quarters combat and trained by fighting anything that threatened the metallic trees that raised it."

I can't handle the more intense interactions in which both the ENTJ and I have our heads so far up our asses. I know I could have done better but I so quickly become an animal that needs others to tame me. Most people say they will forget it and move on, and that is true because they are neurotypical healthy people.  
  
I can't help but be the kind of idiot that gets people to step in all the time to mess with me. I have no control or any sense of it and knowing this truth gives me a lot of self-inflicted pain and anger. I just can't make anything out of these stressful situations."

Like Crobat, it uses its second set of wings when its first one becomes tired or damaged. 
  
5% of Catermor are able to tap into their latent ancient genetics to evolve into Dreggoon. To check for this trait (which can be bred for), take a Catermor that is within 3 levels of evolution to one of some metallic trees where wild Catermor are more commonly found. A Catermor that will evolve into Dreggoon will have different dialogue.  
  
""Catermor no longer wants to eat from the tree."" This is the dialogue to go for.  
  
""Catermor is full and doesn't want to eat from the tree."""

Silence is good, but my energy still lacks restraint and needs an outlet. Getting myself to walk, draw, and cook has been hard because the intense fear I have has been worsening due to some changes at home. I'm just a vulnerable kid with nothing of value to give at this time."

infp,fcn08oi,t3_ei113h,1577799425.0,"My pink lenses are starting to have the drawn on red Sharpie rub off. I'm not seeing the beauty in all these sky pics, likely from feeling too afraid to leave my room to take a walk and being exposed to my abuser. I'm not good at letting go of things like broken glasses, but patience is one of the hardest things to hold onto."
depression,fcmyhff,t3_cml6ni,1577797658.0,"I'm not suicidal anymore, but I'm still too scared to sleep. Never being alone is something most people would want, but for me, it's all wrong. I am merely an accessory to my family, not a part of it. I cannot sleep when the potential of having a whole day disturbed by my abuser or my extroverted mom continues to linger in the air of this rotten shack of a home.  
  
Not being able to do anything out of a potent mix of smothering love and severe anxiety makes me numb to joy as well as the will to do something today. I become overwhelmed when I can do something because 65 possible tasks will pop up at once and I am unable to decide the order.  
  
There are so many things I'm not supposed to say. Things that will not be believed. Things that to most aren't real. Yet I have to get myself out there to confront them. If this life is contradictory, how can it be real? How can it be solved?"
infp,fc8kfdm,t3_egp5fh,1577536772.0,"The other day, my mom dragged me to a Christmas dinner with her friends and cousins who I wouldn't care less about. This one lady in particular annoyed the heck out of me and being the silent one, I didn't bother with telling her she was annoying. I knew I would come off explosive and inappropriate, so whatever. I just kept looking away while she shoved my chair with me sitting in it and the table I was using to eat my food a few inches from the old spots because I was in the way of the main dinner table. She also touched me without my permission and tried to talk to me a lot. Also said something every time our eyes grazed. Typical ESxJ behavior, amirite?"

Free of rules, expectations, and guidelines, but also experience and structure. I'm still a cold person stripped of my ability to love and embrace what I have in my life. I am unable to feel grateful, appreciative, and I don't have the strength to give back without expecting to take something soon after.

I wish I wasn't surrounded by so many people who tell me I shouldn't do things the way I do them. Like why even try if it won't end up the right way. My sensitivity just makes experiencing something appear so dangerous to others and in the end everyone hurts."

I hope people like the names, because I rarely come up with them as designs become finalized. Dreggoon comes from dragon, dragoon, egg, and cocoon while Pupala comes from pupa and paladin.
