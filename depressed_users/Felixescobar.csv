depression,fel5rl6,t3_epm2ch,1579214654.0,He sounds retarded. I've been in hospital for drug use and mental issues and now I have a job a car and going to the gym. They're there to help not to keep you there.
depression,fejk2y5,t3_epergw,1579177501.0,I laugh a lot in public mainly because I don't know how to keep a conversation going. Anxiety and apathy
phenibut,fejbor3,t1_fejbef0,1579165927.0,Yeah I bought some and ended up throwing it out. Wish I didn't now and dosed at 2g or something because I'm good on a gram of phenibut but I had 2 grams yesterday
phenibut,feja38h,t3_epgivb,1579163601.0,I threw up from it last night. Phenibut just isn't for me just like Kratom isn't.
LSD,fej3mxk,t3_ep7wy0,1579155658.0,My idea of a man cave
phenibut,fegu21f,t1_fegpwoa,1579102535.0,20mg
phenibut,fee6sk9,t3_eomy15,1579027578.0,I'm on olanzapine and felt effects from phenibut used capsules and took 2grams other times 1.5
Vaping,fdyq1og,t3_en7rx5,1578782433.0,I had an old prince tank that had a shitty thread but one coil managed to fit. Bought a new one and the coils worked but I imagine since yours is new it must be the coils themselves
CBD,fdr1w9u,t1_fdqub1m,1578678360.0,No worries
CBD,fdqpphw,t3_emqff1,1578672208.0,Are we allowed to post links here?
depression,fdq7bp0,t3_emnl5m,1578657940.0,This resonates with me a lot I've often thought about this. My grandfather suffered with depression and had lung cancer twice. He managed to deal with it very well to be fair and is all clear now
Vaping,fdots8r,t1_fdosi8d,1578612698.0,"Dropped it, don't really notice it though so all good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Vaping,fdopjju,t1_fdoo0u3,1578609994.0,"I was the same mate for a long time on and off smoking for a bit but for my teeth, smell and general healths sake I finally said no to it and eventually bought a decent mod that finally worked. Changing jobs also helped as my previous job I had smoking buddies"
phenibut,fdoowsu,t3_emgk24,1578609612.0,I'm on fluoxetine too never did me any harm to be honest
Vaping,fdomqve,t3_emfw64,1578608308.0,"Innokin t18 and t22 are alright for small vapes, nice flavour too"
Vaping,fdomabs,t3_emgb3v,1578608033.0,"Awesome man I can't stand cigarettes now hope you get to that point too, nice batteries"
kratom,fdodjwm,t3_emf678,1578603171.0,And there's me throwing up taking 5 grams. Jesus Christ
LSD,fdnt4bj,t1_fdnslce,1578592298.0,It's okay the wall behind my monitor is currently blue whole the rest is white. Nothing special but if I had this with blue neon lighting it would be quality
LSD,fdnsxyu,t3_emb2e5,1578592197.0,I felt enlightenment by listening to Alan Watts and taking acid. I listened to him prior to taking acid and once I tripped a few times it just made much more sense on a whole new level. I won't trip until the end of the year now but I miss that feeling. Had bad experiences after this feeling but it doesn't take away the experience of feeling at one with everything. I cried over a baby slug for fucks sakes it looked beautiful I felt like we were related.
Anxiety,fdnsjve,t3_embmud,1578591971.0,Personally I'm trying to implement both by doing cardio either on rest days or leg days. Just a jog around the block. it'll help lifting too because I was knackered after deadlifting today. Both will help but lifting Id prefer over running because you do have to focus on form as another post says. I'm also skinny so that too.
LSD,fdnrtls,t3_ema3mp,1578591551.0,Would love this as wallpaper behind my monitor
Vaping,fdnr2eq,t1_fdnqwq6,1578591181.0,Yeah fell to the ground when I got out of my car. Still works. It's also red from my older one as I misplaced my other one in work ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Vaping,fdnqcsp,t3_embp95,1578590835.0,Lush!
gainit,fdnq2vj,t1_fdnpa6x,1578590707.0,"Ah fair enough it'll probably all show once you become leaner, I'd treat it like every other muscle, build it up then watch the lines show when cutting"
phenibut,fdnf5lb,t1_fdnddso,1578584489.0,To be honest if I didn't vomit after 2.5 grams I'd probably be more inclined to take it often. I know what you mean though it's not like valium etc but it does give a nice effect and more outgoing and a social effect. I guess it just hasn't lived up to your expectations of it
phenibut,fdncfh7,t3_emag0a,1578582793.0,I've taken lsd mdma and other substances and sure it's not like those but I no longer take those substances and 2 grams gets me feeling good. Idk if it's cause I get anxious and depressed that I appreciate it. Can also drive and go to work with it which is why I'm a fan. But yeah it does take a long time to kick in so maybe that's why. People also suggest splitting doses up like taking a gram and then taking another gram an hour or more later. The half life is long too as well as the come up
phenibut,fdmxcg1,t3_em8aig,1578570046.0,I would go with full spectrum CBD for a daily dose and keep phenibut to once or twice a week. Maybe look into Kratom as well but I couldn't handle it myself kept throwing up
gainit,fdmvnib,t3_em5uio,1578567945.0,Ideally if you can get an ab workout in I would do it. Won't show during a bulk but when you cut it might make all the difference. It's activated during compound lifts anyway but no harm in hitting them on they're own
depression,fdmvlh9,t3_em1ggo,1578567871.0,Reddit is my favourite because it's not a highlight reel of everyone's life. It's both the good the bad the funny and people talk honestly.
stopsmoking,fdmvjc7,t1_fdmjvzz,1578567793.0,I may have to purchase this book I've been vaping for months now and I'm down to 3mg but I'd like to quit because my goals are to eat more and I don't eat enough when I'm blowing clouds all day
stopsmoking,fdmvfjo,t3_em3wrh,1578567656.0,"I agree, vaping has saved my health and teeth from falling out, I vape a prince tank with a voopoo drag mod currently on 3mg and I wish to eventually give this up too. But I no longer have the thought of cancer and fucked up teeth in the back of my mind. As far as it's criticisms go you can tell from vaping that it's not like cigarettes in terms of the negatives, it just isn't. Whether it's good for you of course not, ideally quitting both is good but it's a great alternative if you can't give up the nicotine cold turkey"
CBD,fdlkdcc,t3_em0m1w,1578525986.0,"You'll be fine. I thought at first you were anxious about it not working instead of the thc part. Try it, it might do you wonders. I haven't had any in days but I have half a bottle left which I'll take before the gym tomorrow (second time going) hope it works for you."
gainit,fdlaeuv,t3_elzaij,1578519844.0,I'd just keep hitting compound movements and work on your shoulders also. Maybe traps and Lats too but working your whole body will benefit you
depression,fdk076s,t1_fdjzsif,1578492764.0,That's good mate I've been there taking mdma and acid and one time I messed my head up from taking both after I was already on a comedown. I value a sober mind much more now but I was afraid to tell anyone for a long time I couldn't hear what people were saying to me sometimes. I'd say find a hobby if you can like lifting or something but I get how difficult it is I only started again yesterday
CBD,fdjz62y,t3_elsu4b,1578491961.0,My doctor said that there have been reports of people getting angry off of CBD. I was like nah you've got the wrong end of the stick here there's no way that's the case. Idk.
depression,fdjyv0n,t3_elskto,1578491718.0,The only thing stopping me is money and the realization of once the drugs wear off and I'm out of pocket I'll feel even worse. So I tend to only use weed occasionally. I miss it too
phenibut,fdjyo54,t1_fdjxjcp,1578491567.0,Mines called repp sports black and yellow bottle. Some people have talked about taking a low dose daily or almost daily while the majority prefer to take 750mg/gram+ once a week etc.
phenibut,fdjxbqc,t3_elsosd,1578490470.0,Mine says 1 capsule (250) a day. It varies a lot but a gram is a decent dose
Nootropics,fdjx9s3,t3_elsii1,1578490424.0,Citrulline malate is good for blood pressure I believe. If that's a concern of yours
phenibut,fdjx7iw,t3_elshac,1578490371.0,Last night I dreamt I was in a torture room with hooks and needles going through my skin and I remembered in my dream about meditation being better than swearing for pain so I meditated in my dream and felt better. Never got sleep paralysis tho and can't say mine was phenibut related it's mostly from quitting weed dreams go a bit weird. Sorry for this useless post
gainit,fdjuyjk,t1_fdjrdt5,1578488358.0,I'll probs give it 3 days at the least after 2 weeks training once a week. If I feel I can bring it down to two I will
gainit,fdjqkof,t1_fdjpwrl,1578483656.0,"I just figured more rest at the start is good to get into it without hindering recovery and then later on I'll train each bodypart every 5- 6 days like:

- chest, shoulders tri's
- rest
 - back and bis
- rest
- legs 
- repeat

Or I'll do them consecutively and have a break inbetween the whole thing"
Nootropics,fdjmtpr,t3_elqnco,1578478518.0,"I thought I was schizophrenic before but it was ocd. However I did end up having psychotic delusions and sought after supplements that helped with it or any schizophrenia (as I was still concerned at the time) here's a main list of supplements I discovered.

- Niacin
- Sarcosine
- CBD


I'd try all of these if I was your dad. There are many studies with these supplements relating to schizophrenia. Niacin 500mg does cause flushes but it's better than the no flush version and it'll subside with continued use

Edit: didn't realize you mentioned Sarcosine I tried it before but I couldn't really tell much of a difference. But that was because I wasn't having any episodes at the time I was just being paranoid. So it could in fact help a lot with your dad. Best wishes."
gainit,fdjlj9b,t1_fdjlhy4,1578476647.0,That's something I've dabbled in and wish I still did. I went to the gym first time on my own yesterday so I'm close to implementing it again
weed,fdjkldl,t1_fdiokk4,1578475276.0,"I live in the UK so their a bit hard to come by. I do remember when I was in hospital though this old gentleman with a black leather jacket told me to ""try this"" and it was a cartomizer ecig with THC liquid. It wasn't near as thick as the stuff I bought lol"
Nootropics,fdikiej,t3_elktm5,1578444937.0,CBD may be something to try. Others could be magnesium zinc and b6 (zma) or ashwagandha (for anxiety mostly I believe)
gainit,fdik4zg,t3_elij9j,1578444705.0,I'm really skinny and due to depression I relied on milk to sustain the little amount of weight I gained through medication. Ideally I'd like to give it up but it doesn't really give me any problems so if you want my view on it I say go for it. In future Ill probably substitute it for something else but I do love whole fat milk
weed,fdi85sc,t1_fdi7dgc,1578437454.0,I was vaping it on a prince tank and an rda vape so I basically hotboxed the room until it clogged the coils. They clogged too much so I'd rather smoke it
weed,fdhkpgv,t3_elemms,1578424698.0,"I vaped weed thinking it would be odourless. Was it fuck my step dad shouted up the stairs ""you're smoking cannabis!"". He works for the police but it's all good because it's just weed it's quite lenient over here nowadays"
Nootropics,fdhal5e,t3_ele6ex,1578418925.0,Ever tried time release melatonin? I imagine it would help with staying asleep
phenibut,fd1l8kv,t3_ejsufb,1578132818.0,I threw up blood on 3 grams yet 1.5 grams is fine
CasualConversation,fd15ors,t3_ejrv6w,1578127799.0,That's amazing! My boss told me the other day that a customer had told him that I was great with them. Small victories like that are what make work more enjoyable. Happy 2020 to you
Vaping,fd149g6,t3_ejkn0s,1578127404.0,Love my drag too your skin is better than mine tho loving it! Using the prince mod myself
gainit,fd13yl0,t3_ejp9yl,1578127291.0,"I would look into weight you can do higher reps on and then over time increase the weight and eventually do lower reps. Good to get good, slow and controlled form before moving up the weight to for example 5 sets 5 reps."
gainit,fcuty9e,t1_fcuiay0,1577988433.0,"This was me, I built an ego on top of feeling what I would say enlightenment. At first it wasn't like that it was beautiful at first just amazing."
gainit,fcutr4b,t1_fcugt3s,1577988320.0,Me too I've lost nearly a stone in the last month due to work and just not taking care of myself
Supplements,fcun83w,t3_eijx5s,1577984606.0,I sometimes took 10 grams at night for growth hormone levels.
depression,fcrfpdh,t3_eijfgb,1577901224.0,"You do deserve love and care. I was in a dark place at your age but an even darker one last year when I was admitted to hospital with psychosis. Things have improved for myself recently but I still think about suicide sometimes and wonder who will miss me when I'm gone.

 I'm too afraid to do it and taking acid and listening to Alan Watts made me sort of believe that after death life will happen again as another form of consciousness whatever that may be. For all I know it could be a worse life than what I have now. Reality is infinite so there's no telling what it would actually be but having a roof over my head and being in good health physically is what makes me grateful. I don't have psychosis anymore it  was brought on by drugs. I have ocd too and thought I had psychosis before actually having it which is kinda fucked. I hope 2020 will be a better year for you be healthy and love yourself more. I wish I was your age so I wouldn't make the mistakes I inevitably made. Sorry if my story didn't help much I will say that in these 10 years I've had amazing moments also. It can get better (hugs)"
phenibut,fcrdve0,t1_fcr90m7,1577900503.0,Accident lol is HCl better then? Because I do like the effects and I'm not a lover of alcohol
phenibut,fcr6cm0,t1_fcqbyxj,1577897433.0,I take capsules
stopsmoking,fcp0bki,t3_eib3cv,1577846588.0,Same here. Was vaping 6mg on a prince tank with a voopoo drag mod. Put them in their boxes and in the cupboard. I'll miss it but I need to prioritize food over nicotine. If I didn't have a goal of gaining weight I'd probs just continue vaping
phenibut,fcozrvs,t3_eibttu,1577846137.0,I threw up loads on 3.5 grams I think that's the only issue with that dose but most people can probably handle it
depression,fcntg9s,t3_ei5kkh,1577818081.0,"I was in a psych ward at the end of 2018 and 2019. 2020 will be a clean slate for me, going nicotine free and hitting the gym. Those are my goals as well as showering more and brushing my teeth (it's been like once a week or more)"
phenibut,fcnsntp,t3_ei6geb,1577817660.0,NAC is good as well but it's too late for that now but in future check it out
stopsmoking,fcncz60,t3_ei2vkq,1577809061.0,I haven't smoked cigs in a while but tonight I'll be vaping for the last time before I put my mod in its box and into the cupboard. Will also have a cigar tonight because it was given to me for Christmas even tho I don't care for them lol

depression,fc2tptw,t1_fc1t1on,1577373765.0,Yeah fair enough. It won't kill you but if it has negative effects id do neither
depression,fc1oymj,t3_efopeg,1577325133.0,I'd rather someone smoke weed than drink any day not good on the system and more addictive
stopsmoking,fc1or7z,t3_efksz5,1577324965.0,Ive been vaping my prince mod but plan to stop using it in order to eat more in the new year. Merry Christmas
Anxiety,fbs5xz7,t3_ee2xln,1577050709.0,I have intrusive thoughts that I'm a pedophile or I'm a serial killer psychopath even though I'm a good uncle. Intrusive thoughts can be devastating when they go dark I've been suicidal over it thinking I'm capable of evil things. What keeps me going is the knowledge that the internal war I face is in a way why I'm a good person at heart. A monster wouldn't have this internal conflict. Stay strong brother
depression,fbs2fzc,t3_ee0wk5,1577049333.0,If I killed myself I don't know how it'd affect my mother. For that reason alone im stuck with my fucked up life but I'm looking at the positives. Trying to anyway
