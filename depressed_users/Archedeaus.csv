StarWars,fec8ze0,t3_d742c9,1578968760.0,"I would love to see a short film about Callista Ming's encounter with Abeloth.  Maybe somehow her and her crew get stranded on Sinkhole Station and it all goes downhill from there.  The last shot of the film being Callista being dragged into the dark tendrils of Abeloth while screaming for help through the force, only to find her cries for help being muffled by Abeloth.  She tries to end her own life to become one with the force before Abeloth can completely engulf her before she realizes the horrifying truth: there is no escape from the mother, not even for her spirit.  The epilogue of the film would be Luke Skywalker waking up in a cold sweat as he and his son Ben begin their journey to find out why Jacen Solo turned to the dark side."

It could be something as big as a car wreck or something as small and as insignificant as a penny on the ground.  These are called ""Catalysts"".  By engaging one you will trigger a separate path that can be taken to break the loop."
