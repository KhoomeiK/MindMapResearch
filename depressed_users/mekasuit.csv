depression,feks03p,t3_epm2ch,1579206392.0,Did someone close to him commit suicide when he was young or something? This seems like a very extreme view to have without some kind of reason.
SandersForPresident,fefic5n,t1_fefhxlw,1579056926.0,It does but on BOTH asides it seems really petty considering what? It’s February and elections are in November so a ten month difference? I have been Bernie since last go around and donated as much as I could and canvassed and phone banked but on both sides that just seemed really petty and outside of the issues. Bernie still number one on the stage to me though
SandersForPresident,fefi2m3,t1_fefhv7v,1579056766.0,Sub seems to think Warren is fucking up. I’m not impressed but don’t think it’s bad enough to be how they’re making it. I tuned in a little late and am hoping to see Bernie’s performance pick up
SandersForPresident,fefhsnv,t3_eot9ju,1579056603.0,Oh no that 30 year gaffe was not really a good one in my opinion
AskPsychiatry,fdwj674,t3_en8lwm,1578759219.0,"Is it because you identify as that age like you actually feel like a sixteen year old? It took me a while to be comfortable in my skin that I’m a 30 year old who enjoys sleeping until eleven on my days off when possible, playing video games, etc."

keto,fdmiz6j,t1_fdk5und,1578551621.0,"It’s just generally considered safer than aspartame. If you look up the dangers of aspartame and “aspartame vs sucralose” there’s a lot of information. I’m on mobile and just had a tooth pulled and I don’t fancy digging around for it right now but the information is easy to find. Some people may disagree with t or feel there’s no difference but I’ll stick with my Coke Zero, it tastes better anyway"
keto,fdmit45,t1_fdk9ohp,1578551439.0,"I have never heard of them I’ll gave to look into them. Tonight sugar free jello, a couple pecan pie fat bombs and some lower net carb peanuts were enough because my mouth was still so sore. Tomorrow I can definitely try this, and I can definitely manage cheese and sliced deli meat on the other side I think. Thanks for the ideas!"
keto,fdmipww,t1_fdjxcq5,1578551346.0,Thank you!!
keto,fdmio44,t1_fdlo16q,1578551293.0,Not too late! It was a large back molar so it’s probably going to take a few days to really recover and I’m supposed to take it easy with food etc the next couple days. Thank you!
keto,fdjv8yo,t1_fdjnwx0,1578488628.0,"I wouldn’t have survived the transition without them, but try to stick to one’s sweetened with sucralose like a Coke Zero. The old school diet drinks have aspartame which tastes nasty and is terrible for you. The Coke Zero vanilla and cherry are great too. And I love going to the freestyle machine and getting flavored Sprite Zero!"

AskPsychiatry,fdesa1r,t3_ekz4jh,1578345551.0,"I do not suggest it if you do not have a prescription for it. However I truly need benzos and already had a script when I switched to my new psych. They don’t sedate me heavily and I do take one because my anxiety about doctors is so bad I have what they call white coat hypertension. My blood pressure sky rockets in a medical atmosphere but is normal otherwise (I had to track it a while at home for my doctor to acknowledge that’s what it was).

If you have a tolerance and/or they don’t sedate you heavily and they are prescribed I don’t see the issue because psychiatrists are there to help. If doctors give you anxiety it would be normal for you to want to treat that. I can’t even speak to my doctor without stuttering and I am not brave enough to disclose real symptoms without them. 

I’d say use your discretion and be wise about it. I was able to explain the worst of my panic attacks hives etc because I wasn’t panicking during the visit. That being said I’m a patient not a psych and this is only my personal opinion."
keto,fddnq7o,t1_fd8omh7,1578318907.0,"I started out dirty keto. Lots of sausages from McDonald’s, Sausage McMuffin no muffin, burgers plain with no bun. Still did very well losing weight. If you want to go clean keto you have to cook more but you can find it other places. If you can find places with wings that aren’t breaded at all, try to find out what sauce they use or bring your own. Lots of buffalo sauces that aren’t sweet are low carb. But the first time I started keto (just back on the wagon myself) doing completely shamelessly dirty keto helped me build the habits. I never really cheated because SOMEWHERE near me there was a McDs or a Burger King so I told myself no matter how lazy or busy I was I didn’t have an excuse"
keto,fddnifi,t3_ekb8q4,1578318715.0,"None of my family cares so I just wanted to share somewhere relevant... the ketostix have ketones and I’m back in business! I had gone down from 182 to 153 before the end of last year. I knew I’d probably fluctuate some but wanted to enjoy the last three months, my birthday is in October, so that lets me enjoy Birthday through Christmas without really worrying about carb counts. Think I’ll make that a yearly thing.

I did go back up to 165 but I count some of that being both off keto and moving from bartending to a desk job. But I know I can lose the water weight quickly and at least be back on the 150s.

So happy to be back on keto! Just starting and I feel an energy difference already"
vita,fddhhzr,t1_fdbg18l,1578312494.0,"They spiked for a little bit when they announced production was over then stabilized around that price. I hope you don’t have to sell anything else but I always have gotten more profitable results on eBay than locally, if you have other things that are more niche than the Vita it may be a thought. I also flipped stuff from thrift stores when I wasn’t employed. for instance those old VHS that came with Nintendo magazines and got them for like 99 cents a piece. Sold them for 20 or so on eBay. Every dollar adds up, just make sure to not include shipping unless you’ve jacked prices up.

Textbroker is far from minimum wage but I used to do it on the side here and there. If you do have credit cards etc call them NOW and ask for hardship programs, don’t wait until you’re in the hole. I can’t say what my company is or what we do hardship wise to keep my job but I’ll say that the policies are more proactive than reactive. So calling anyone you owe now and saying you may have trouble paying is better than avoiding them for a few months even if you’re hoping to get back to work by then.

Sorry just my two cents. Hope y’all are doing better soon."
SandersForPresident,fd6x5wq,t1_fd67nnk,1578196831.0,I was just wondering if there was something about this. Trying to look into how much it’ll cost me to drive there now and go on a budget.
IWantToLearn,fcu8mlr,t3_eiwz55,1577975143.0,My best thing I’ve invested In lately is lint rollers and a garment steamer. With three cats in my room I constantly had a fear of smelling like them. A steamer helps eliminate smells on your clothes through disinfecting and it only takes a few minutes. And you’d be surprised how much cleaner a good lint roller makes you look.
IWantToLearn,fcu8ise,t1_fcu86n2,1577975072.0,"You can get away with twice. I personally “bathe” twice a day but in the morning it’s without soap just to wake up. I actually wash at night, and I only wash my hair every few days (female) and supplement with dry shampoo if needed. My hair feels better than ever with this and expensive shampoo together."
depression,fcu6g12,t1_fcta7i0,1577973691.0,I said it in another comment but it wasn’t until forcing myself to find out what I was avoiding and change it that I stopped wanting to avoid going to sleep to avoid waking up the next day
depression,fcu68m2,t3_eir5wa,1577973550.0,All I can say is figuring out what I was really dreading about the next day and changing it was all that helped. I changed jobs and that truly helped then changing my meds after thanks to new insurance was truly a life changer
callcentres,fck3vi5,t3_egn3g9,1577715814.0,Keto. I am about to go back on it after losing some of the weight I lost. But if you count calories and track your macros you can lose weight with no exercise. It takes a week or so of getting used to but you can even fit in fast food burgers with a lettuce wrap or no bun etc

AskPsychiatry,fc1pgpn,t3_efniht,1577325587.0,"Not a psychiatrist but drinking while on any benzo is highly dangerous and any doc will tell you to avoid it. I’ve done it too stupidly, but to my knowledge Ativan is a longer acting benzo. To be on the safe side, not risking it would be better. Benzos and alcohol lead to people dying in their sleep. Not a good look for Christmas."

AskPsychiatry,fc1dwp5,t3_efmq79,1577315848.0,"Shutting down to protect yourself is a good way to put it. Our brain has defense mechanisms... if we think we can’t help it or it’s overwhelming some people “turn off” in order to process things without going crazy. Now there’s different forms that can be symptoms of stuff like disassociation (where you feel like things aren’t actually happening to you or you’re almost an observer of your own life rather than a participant kind of). Also those large fights and events can be a way to release pent up emotions and feelings and when they’re out you kind of have to process things in order to know how you feel about it.

I’m not a psychiatrist, just a mental health patient, but I’d think in small doses this is normal. When it becomes larger stretches is when it becomes problematic. I had stretches during my depression where I almost felt nothing and felt completely detached from myself and the world. It’s in the times when it becomes a longer period and makes every day life less fulfilling or manageable that it’s really a problem"
vita,fc1dha1,t1_fc0qdkb,1577315484.0,I study Japanese as a hobby so I understand a portion but not enough to not need google translate.

callcentres,fbwv0fo,t1_fbvmq5i,1577160165.0,People who haven’t had a truly miserable job don’t get that it can truly make you not want to live. My experience is similar. I was lucky to get this job and I actually like my CC and my benefits. I’m much happier there than I ever was in restaurants and years of no insurance and no weekends off made me so grateful for insurance and Fridays and Saturdays off.
callcentres,fbwuqrt,t3_eemvja,1577159967.0,"Found out through friends at my restaurant who also worked there. I don’t state my company but I do say I’m lucky and I work at one of the few good ones, from what I’ve seen many people are unhappy at theirs. Needed insurance and other benefits and took a chance and applied with no previous call center experience but plenty of customer service and got in.

My situation may be unique; I was really tired of restaurants and not having health insurance and not being able to have visible tattoos or colored hair. I didn’t feel like myself and I finally have a job where I can do those things and decorate my desk to fit my personality. I personally am much happier."
AskPsychiatry,fbpby24,t1_fbnc13h,1577019568.0,"Yeah, that’s definitely a bit much for daily use. IANAD but I take 1mg a few times a week and I get nervous about how much I take even though it is prescribed. I couldn’t imagine feeling completely comfortable with taking a bar a day unless this isn’t OP’s starting dose and he just has a tolerance. Benzos like anything else are benefit/risk weighed. Mine helps me function in public situations, which helps my depression. I have started to supplement with CBD and find that it has similar effects when used as a preventative, but not to stop panic attacks. As soon as I can find a cost effective source of CBD tincture I hope to move to CBD more often and use the Xanax only for the worst panic attacks."
AskPsychiatry,fbm2dai,t1_fbkw36g,1576976504.0,IANAD but I’ve been on and off Wellbutrin multiple times. Tolerance is lower and hangovers are HELL but other than that no severe interactions (and I drink wine regularly)
AskPsychiatry,fbdi3so,t3_ecs0n6,1576762829.0,"IANAD but if your psych has any ethics they would not misdiagnose you in order to have you realize something else or seek more/different help. Psychiatrists are mainly medication management only but even then anyone in the psych field should, if anything, be helping guide you to realizing what you need, and to help you manage symptoms in the mean time. To clarify, they would not use a bait and switch or reverse psychology but do things like asking if you have considered certain things or asking you to think on it for a little bit. 

If you don’t agree with the diagnosis, I would suggest going to a different psych. You can choose to tell them what the other psych said, or just be honest about your symptoms. I had a psych tell me I was a drug seeker because I tested positive for marijuana when I was 18 in their associated ER, I was 28 when she told me that. I never went back because I knew it wasn’t true and I thought it was unethical for her to admit she believes I should be on certain things but saying I can’t have them because I smoked weed as a teenager. Never felt the need to mention it to my new doc who is awesome. 

It can take a lot of trial and error with psych medications. If the side effects are worse than what it is supposed to be treating AFTER a reasonable titration, make sure you tell your psych that. You’re your own advocate. I’m having trouble determining if the he was a typo and your mother yelled at you or if the psychiatrist yelled at you. If your psych yelled at you rather than simply talked in a firm voice, that is not acceptable.

It took me a while to get here to the mix I have. Wellbutrin, Viibryd and Xanax. I do take Xanax almost daily. My anxiety is so high that it never even made me sleepy or anything from the beginning. I just feel normal. (Funny enough when I tried Xanax recreationally in high school I wondered why I just felt normal but I haven’t done anything recreational in years). It may not be the first few tries of meds, it may take five or so. Everyone’s brain is different. The important thing is not to give up until you get some kind of relief.

Have they offered you anything even short term for the anxiety part? Anxiety and depression have high comorbidity. In my case I can’t really function in crowds without Xanax (and never could) and that inability would upset me therefore making
me more depressed. It was a cycle. If one medicine isn’t cutting it sometimes they need to supplement it. For me, I’ve finally found the perfect mix unless my tolerance gets too much for one of the meds. I hope you find yours soon!"
politics,fbacic7,t1_fbabukl,1576674033.0,Yep. The few good employees pay a living wage and give more than enough time to protest but aren’t scared of their people jumping ship. Now that I finally have one of those jobs I’d like to protest the 2.13 an hour bullshittery that is waiting tables.
politics,fbacef2,t1_fb9jibx,1576673927.0,People not in these states or who aren’t close enough to the rural areas of their state don’t understand how deep the Clinton hate runs in some areas. It goes beyond party lines.
