And I know it makes it more dangerous for people with mental health because they’d much rather die than have to deal with that during a crisis. Maybe people are in danger, and maybe they need professional help, but next time they aren’t going to fail at killing themselves because they will be twice as motivated to make sure they succeed."

NoFap,fdp6unf,t3_emjvq9,1578621371.0,"when you first decide to stop masturbating, it’s never going to be the last time you masturbate. i feel like kicking the addiction is a mind-state change where everytime you relapse, u should accept the regret and shame and use it as a driving force to keep yourself from relapsing again. And hopefully taking more time before u PMO again, because chances are it will happen again. And it’s okay. it really is, because you are trying and that’s already 1000x better than not trying at all."
NoFap,fdp6ldf,t3_emjw97,1578621202.0,"im also close to relapsing and i came onto this subreddit to see if i could spurn my urges.

tell me why have u tried to quit in the first place? what’s driving you to not PMO normally?"
depression,fdk9yvo,t3_eloddk,1578499409.0,"The unwelcome stares are your mind telling you that you don’t belong. When you are at your most happy and least depressed it’s very probable that you never feel that way and never notice it because it’s difficult to notice the absence of something, it’s much more common to notice the presence of that feeling. I could make a very solid bet that you, when serotonin is flowing through your brain, are much better at socializing with people because you stop worrying about how people think about you and it shows. Your entire demeanor and energy changes and you stop presenting yourself as someone who doesn’t belong but instead someone who should have been there the whole time but was unable to because of depression/anxiety."
depression,fdk9jg5,t3_elpxkm,1578499141.0,"That’s the depression that is making u think that. Also if you ever find yourself in that state of mind while talking to people, chances are you are not talking to the right people. The right people are going to go out of your way to make sure you know that it is okay not to be okay. And they will know that it is absolutely imperative that you have outlets and therapy sessions (whether or not they are with an actual therapist) because you need that allotted time and energy to vent your frustrations and come up with reasons and causes (and more importantly) avenues for your plan to ease your depression. You are not craving attention, depression is a bunch of uphill battles in an incredibly strategic war. You need to be able to talk about your problems. Otherwise, If that was the case and all depressed people were “craving attention” then no one would get better and everyone would stay depressed."
depression,fcmhbqn,t1_fclldvi,1577775273.0,"Your negative feelings I think actually lies in your flawed thinking. It’s based on the idea that you are (even subconsciously) allowing people to who have nothing to do with your birthday, have power over whether or not you are happy that day. I mean how many people that you supposedly care about have you forgotten their birthday this year? (or not even known their birthday to begin with?). Because chances are there’s a ton. And either they were JUST as upset as you are about their lack of attention, or they didn’t care and enjoyed their day.

The thing is, no matter what, (unless you are an absolute monster of a calendar-updater) you forgot someone’s birthday who is important to you. But the thing is THAT’S NOT YOUR FAULT. Because it’s not your responsibility!!! Even if you flip flop between whether or not you deserve to feel pain about people forgetting your bday, the problem is you shouldn’t even be allowing anyone else to cause you pain on a day that is ENTIRELY dedicated to you. Just go enjoy yourself and do what YOU want to do. Stop worrying about if others are going to stop and (consistently AND annually) recognize some day that isn’t even remotely important to them. Just have a good fucking day man. Do what you want and be with who you want. Stop letting other people dictate your happiness!!"
depression,fcmck0q,t1_fclx37u,1577770521.0,"that’s a beautiful way of thinking and i completely agree. It’s my birthday today and it’s been one of my best, specifically because I changed my mindset."
depression,fal83kb,t3_e9ouva,1576179978.0,You fucking beautiful soul. I’m so sorry. That’s the biggest fucking gut-punch I’ve read in so long. Jesus Christ I’m so sorry.
