antidepressants,febqdue,t3_eoaq9e,1578961577.0,Idk man I was put on Zoloft when I was young and it fucked up my memory and attention span. I don’t think it’s good to try when your brains still developing so much
mentalhealth,fe8wpt0,t1_fe8w5ox,1578931919.0,You know that feeling you get when you hold your breath for as long as you can. Not exactly painful but horribly uncomfortable you know what I’m saying. Having that feeling get more and more intense for a few minutes as you die would be awful. It’d be about my last choice on how to die personally.

antidepressants,fe868cc,t1_fe7vvld,1578923001.0,I’d try Wellbutrin if I didn’t already take adderall. I love adderall
antidepressants,fe6iwaq,t3_enyk2f,1578892334.0,"Use them only as a last resort because they’re a lot more powerful than people think. They have the ability to permanently alter your brain and sexual function. It may be a small percentage of people this happens to but it happens. I used to be on a variety of different ones and although I’m still depressed I won’t dare try another one because I’m terrified of the effects. Since taking them I’ve developed adhd, anhedonia and short term memory loss and I’m not positive that those were all developed because of antidepressants but I’m not gonna take another chance. Edit: I’m taking about ssri’s and snri’s. Wellbutrin seems like a good antidepressant with a lot less potential to be dangerous although I have never taken it."

antidepressants,fdjybh5,t1_fdjvn4k,1578491287.0,"Probably, but a benzo would be really helpful in your situation. Most people say bad side effects subside after a couple weeks but I don’t have personal experience because I’ve never really had side effects from antidepressants. If the panic is lasting all day than maybe klonopin would be better than Xanax because it lasts all day. If you wanna talk let me know cause I’m lonely af"

weed,fdj5fqb,t1_fdixrov,1578458954.0,I’ll need to construct one of those. Even just the weed being out makes the room smell pretty quick though
weed,fdirc0n,t3_elemms,1578449306.0,"Man I miss carts. So tempted to pick up a fake one just for the convenience. I could hit them in my room and the smell went away in a few minutes. Now with bud I have to smoke outside my window, leave the window open, turn on the fan, and then give it about 15 mins for the smell to go away"
Drugs,fdiouxg,t3_elfrxj,1578447718.0,It’s because weed is the most widely used illegal drug by far. If all illegal drugs were used the same amount weed would be near the bottom of the list. Shit may be addictive but it’s easy as hell to quit. Harder to quit caffeine than weed
socialanxiety,fdi313l,t3_el8o5f,1578434831.0,What’s fucked is that I wasn’t even quiet and well behaved as a child I was a normal kid but something went wrong and now I’m a fucking loser
antidepressants,fdfwnay,t1_fdfugpc,1578372222.0,I’ve never actually taken wellbutrin but you could start at a very low dose and slowly increase until you feel that it is helping your depression but not making you feel high. I’m pretty sure no therapeutic dose of Wellbutrin would make you feel near as high as speed/amphetamine does.
NoFap,fdft3l7,t3_ekzbdh,1578369525.0,It’s so discouraging that urges never go away even after that many days.

antidepressants,fdfrh1e,t3_el3iw9,1578368411.0,It’s much much weaker than cocaine therefore loads less addictive. Hell I take adderall which is stronger than coke and I don’t find it addictive. I take breaks with no problem. Just major fatigue for a couple days then I’m back to normal.
antidepressants,fdfpn7m,t3_el1zg0,1578367198.0,Generic testing isn’t always right it’s more of a guess. Give other antidepressants a try if you need

Drugs,fdbuzc4,t3_ekfega,1578262395.0,Normal if you have a lot of anxiety. Be careful though it’s highly addictive. I hear withdrawals are terrible. It’d be better to stick to use three times a week max. That way you wouldn’t build a tolerance and wouldn’t have withdrawals upon cessation

I can’t make friends, can’t seem to have fun. I’m used to being by myself all the time but I know there’s so much I’m missing out on. And I’m gonna regret it in a few years. I’m 17 and a senior in high school. I should go to parties and have fun but I can’t. And even if I could, my parents would bust my ass for drinking.

antidepressants,fcwdnc4,t1_fcvnrgd,1578022996.0,The headache lingered until the next morning and that entire next day I had a slight headache. Then it went away. I’m thinking it may have been an aura migraine but I’ve never had a migraine before
antidepressants,fcvkq40,t3_ej3wxz,1578004178.0,"I started it last week and I really want to give it a good try but a few nights ago I had a weird ass vision change that I believe was caused by remeron. I had a blind spot for a good 20 minutes and then a bad headache following. I messaged my psychiatrist but he’s on vacation right now, so I stopped taking it. I’m hoping it probably wasn’t from the remeron so I can try it again. Waiting for feedback from my psych."
antidepressants,fct5s93,t3_eiqiqj,1577933608.0,"I haven’t heard that before but it could be true. I started Zoloft at 12 years old and took it for probably four years, and then took multiple other antidepressants too. I was super short growing up, I don’t know if taking antidepressants had to do with my delayed growth or not. Freshman year I was probably 4’11. Now I’m 5’11 as a senior. Grew a foot in three years. I definitely look younger than my age as well and I don’t have a lot of body hair either. If I had to guess I would say it’s just genetics and the antidepressants didn’t have anything to do with it."
antidepressants,fcr7eg2,t3_eigcn9,1577897854.0,I agree 100% these drugs aren’t to be fucked with. They are more dangerous than people think and should be used as a last resort only.

antidepressants,fcpb1md,t3_eiei26,1577856725.0,"You may not even have any side effects unless you think about it constantly, then you will start to feel them. The mind is very powerful you can convince yourself that you are having side effects even when you aren’t. For example I was put on Zoloft in seventh grade and because I knew nothing about the drug and had no concern, I had zero side effects and zero withdrawals when I stopped taking it.

It’s best to not even worry about it."

pharmacy,fchigpu,t1_fchi9h3,1577650743.0,Of course it’s more dangerous than either one alone but I’m saying there’s more dangerous combos out there. I don’t use them together I’ve never done coke

fakecartridges,fcg5o7y,t3_eh3q52,1577636716.0,I’ve had disposables that look really similar before and they’ve always been good. I don’t think the danger is in nicotine vapes
pharmacy,fcg4lei,t1_fcfzy5l,1577636405.0,Coke and alcohol isn’t a very dangerous combo. What’s much more dangerous is the morphine and alcohol combination. Opioids/benzos with alcohol are the most dangerous combos
DiagnoseMe,fcfb4lb,t1_fcczba9,1577628270.0,"I have but not like this. Shortly after this post the vision problem went away but then I got a really bad headache where I could feel pain right behind my right eye. I will look into it, thanks!"
oilpen,fcbwl5h,t1_fcapqzx,1577591772.0,"Before you even try it you need to know this (I’m assuming you don’t know this because you’re new). Most carts are fake. Unless you know 100% that this cart was bought from a legal dispensary then I’d strongly advise against using it. Have you heard about the deaths from vaping on the news? Those are all from fake carts. Fake carts can contain all sorts of shit that’s horrible for your lungs like vitamin E. I could be wrong but, off of looks it looks fake to me. I’ve never seen a cart shape like that and the oil is really yellow. If it’s not real throw that shit out."

Beer tastes good, I’ll definitely drink beer when I’m of age. Wine is okay but I don’t love it. Hard liquor is fucking nasty and I don’t see myself ever enjoying drinking that shit. The high is very strange. I’ve never been wasted but the buzz is weird. It makes me feel like my perception and pov is all fucked up. Turning my head feels weird. It feels like everything is lagging. If I drink when I’m tired my muscles feel extremely weak and I just want to collapse and never move again. Not a big fan. 

Don’t mind me, I’m just rambling off the adderall"
antidepressants,fc6ixvz,t1_fc5ask2,1577481681.0,"It’s true, but keep in mind it’s a drug itself. Not a particularly dangerous drug but if you are able to stay healthy without it, then taking it would decrease your life span."
antidepressants,fc4uaym,t3_eg64ua,1577428706.0,You can but I would guess that being on any medication for life would decrease your life span.
anhedonia,fc3ipiq,t3_efzx38,1577390674.0,Antidepressants can cause side effects immediately but I doubt one week worth of taking it gave you anhedonia. There’s really no way of telling the source. Anhedonia and depression stick together all the time though.
Stims,fbmve19,t3_edzc46,1576989332.0,Most prefer them because of the big boost in productivity because with uppers you can feel really good and get shit done while on downers you feel really good but don’t do shit. Personally I like both and don’t really have a preference. I have it both ways because I’m prescribed both adderall and klonopin for adhd and anxiety. I love both. I think uppers are much less likely to cause addiction because there are no withdrawals except slight fatigue for me.
Drugs,fbmhiuv,t1_fbm2888,1576983851.0,It’s not inside it’s outside my window. I’ve done it probably 10 times before without getting caught. All it takes is 10 mins of leaving my window open and the smell is gone.

I feel like even if my dad didn’t get really mad he still doesn’t want me smoking so if he heard me go outside he would follow and take my pipe next time. I don’t really know if he knows if i smoke often or not but he’s a really smart guy so he may know. I should have a conversation about it but I’m pretty sure he would just make it clear that he doesn’t want me smoking and then he’d be more pissed if he caught me again. I’ll definitely talk to him about it someday lol, before I move out at least. Thanks man"
trees,fbm2jwg,t1_fbl88sl,1576976651.0,"I wish I could but it’s hard to get outside. Our house has really shitty insulation so my parents are likely to hear the basement door or the back door open. They don’t sleep with a fan or anything so it’s dead silent in their room, they can hear anything. The front door is off limits because we have one of those doorbell cams and it see me.

Valium isn’t even a painkiller so idk why you got those maybe for anxiety before the surgery. If anything you should double your Percocet dose and don’t take the Valium. But that’s just my advice talk to your doctor if you can.
