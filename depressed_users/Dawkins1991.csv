If you try to put an action figure with movable bodyparts that doesn't have that flat leg support to stand still, it is not that easy and you need to find the perfect balance. 

Now try it with Playdoh. Make a human figure, a realistic one with human proportions, no treetrunk legs. Well, not going to happen. 

We are able to stand still because our muscles are doing micromovements contantly and unconsciously to keep us balanced. Try to ""deactivate"" those muscles and you instantly start to fall."

It kind of worked for a time, then slowly everyone forgot about it.

It was also good to connect with people I ""might know"". Like when I saw a guy with a familiar face but wasn't sure that we actually met on last friday's party  or he is just a random dude I passed by in the shop. 

I think the intended function was simply to get someones's attention first without texting or sending a friend request which may be too intrusive for some.

I'm not sure about the business side though. It seems like a very simple function which is simple to code and implement, so it worth to add it for the user engagement. In the end, the more time you spend on Facebook the better for them, and even those few second can add up a lot over time. 

It was also kinda fun for some time. I had some friends we poked each other dozens of times a day for no reason just for fun. During all that poking we probably saw dozens of ads."

NoStupidQuestions,fcwrb75,t3_ejbe3i,1578034507.0,"Back then when I worked in a factory, they made new rules and basically took all the break, which meant the only break was lunch in a 12h shift (illegal but somehow they got away with it)

A lot of employee threatened to strike, the boss said those who want to strike can choose between leaving now with a mutual agreement, or getting fired for bad behaviour and not breaking the rules of contract, which would cripple everyone because probably noone will hire you after that (no employer wants someone with a history of strike).

Guess what happened? No strike, obviously. Some of us, the lucky ones just left in a few days and the others who had rent and debts to pay, family to feed etc kept on grinding. 

This was 10 years ago so probably they couldn't get away with this, but I'm sure the same would happen.

You go to your miserable school / job, go home, do some crap to distract your mind, rins and repeat until you die.

And again in capital: NOTHING FREAKIN HAPPENS which would distract our minds from thinking about this meaningless existence. Back then, people's minds were occupied by thinking about how to survive a war, or even just how to survive one more winter. Well, not anymore. We have way too much time to think, and that 90% of the jobs are boring, monotonous full of useless bureaucracy won't help that either. 

The free and near unlimited amount of information makes it worse.

After that, I kept asking for it when we were waiting for longer times, then eventually I bought for myself, and there was no turning back from there.
