When you've struggled with depression for a long enough time, theres a certain sense of comfort in staying sick and it becomes frightening to think about moving beyond it, because we dont know what's beyond the depression and we dont know who we are without it. Our minds rationalize that while being miserable all the time is unpleasant, it's something we know, and therefore it's safer than trying to recover. 

For me, theres also the fear of being expected to do more once you've recovered, and not being able to meet those expectations because my energy levels and ability to do things has always been very shallow, and not meeting expectations would send me spiralling again."

My heart breaks for you and what you're going through. There are many things a parent needs to suck up and deal with when they choose to be a parent, but your ex and his mother poisoning your son and basically treating you as a punching bag and an ATM is not one of those things. Your son, as much as he is a product of a shitty environment, is not entitled to treating you like this, and I actually really dread the kind of adult he'll grow into. 

You've done everything you can to try and be a good mother, but you not only have to think of your own well being, but the wellbeing of the son you still have as well. Cut your losses and walk away and let your piece of shit ex and his mommy (seriously, he sounds like a pathetic mommy's boy, and his mom is even worse for enabling this deadbeat, entitled, spoiled brat behavior) deal with the monster they're creating."

You sound like an entitled, spoiled brat who can't be assed to stick to what you agreed on. And ""let's remember to remove our laundry"" is not a passive aggressive remark. IT'S A REMINDER TO DO YOUR FUCKING LAUNDRY because you apparently can't figure out how to do it on your own initiative. That was the gentle, civil way of her trying to communicate to you, and you're responding by throwing a tantrum and threatening her, and escalating a situation, and then threatening her for not taking your shit. Grow up. YTA, MAJORLY."
