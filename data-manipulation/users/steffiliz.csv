At some point, I just finally had to accept that it was foolish to think that extra effort on my part could make up for zero effort on his.  What do you say to a person who acts like you don’t exist then says ‘keep in touch’?"

When I finally got to the post office to mail the bracelet back to him, I looked down and realized it was the same day of the year that he had been captured.  That fact was not lost on him when he received it either."

OutOfTheLoop,fei1xxv,t3_djtazt,1579128500.0,"I don't like them playing the 'Diana' card by suggesting the press is hounding Meghan just as they did Diana.  It seemed rather early in the relationship for them to be going public with all of their woes, and the 'I thought they would be fair' comment sounded like something a 13 y.o. would say.  I hope she is really devoted to Harry because he's definitely burned some bridges back home."

Keep in mind he does not live there and does not even visit the beach.  But he is going to extraordinary efforts to prevent others from enjoying it.  Therefore, all possible worthy contributions he has made in his life have been erased and he will forever be known as the beach asshole.

His stage presence even at that early stage of his career was amazing, and the entire concert is a good listen."
