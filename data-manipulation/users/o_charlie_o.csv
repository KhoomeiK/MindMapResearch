FemaleDatingStrategy,ffck0lu,t1_ffc88wy,1579801099.0,"Agreed, I’m a highly sexual person. I’m in my mid 30s and for the first time I have a consistent partner that our sexual energies match up. I also don’t give af who sees me naked, you can’t hold shit over my head, I sent that because I know it looked amazing. I’ve been to lots of nudist spas, swimming places and even a nudist dinner party (that was hilarious and a great time) My relationship is healthy and I am respected and extremely desired and I feel safe. But even if this wasn’t the circumstances if I felt like being my good Ol sexual self and entertaining myself in those manners I will with confidence. No part of me ever give 1 single shit what some dude I don’t talk to anymore thinks of me or says about me. How could it possibly matter what they think? If you wanna show off my nudes to other people fine, you look like an asshole and I still stand by the pics looked great. I support 100% anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable sharing nudes, but I will NOT be repressed and I will NOT be ashamed for being naturally a highly sexual being. What is right for me isn’t right for everyone else and that’s ok. But I’ve never had a moment of regret living my life to the fullest. I’m a sexual goddess thank you very much, worship or move LVM’s"
