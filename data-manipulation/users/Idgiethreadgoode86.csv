AskCulinary,ffgbqui,t3_eta5lw,1579902735.0,I like the youtube video idea mentioned before. Maybe watch some demo videos before you get into the kitchen. I think another great lesson would be to talk about kitchen safety. Basically a what to do when things start to go wrong. It all works hand in hand.
AmItheAsshole,ffaht6q,t3_esfxc0,1579736063.0,"NTA - I was in a similar situation where I was helping an old friend with her kids. I wasn't even close to making minimum wage for the couple of days I was there, but she was single and I wanted to help her out. Things started to go south after she began to complain about every little thing I did wrong. Another mutual friend reminded her that she wasn't even paying me minimum wage...that I couldn't survive off of what she was giving me. She agreed, but still did nothing about it. In the end, I was ultimately labeled the ""bad girl"" because I was either doing too much or not enough. Anyways, sounds like your ""friends"" are going to be broke within a year."
EMDR,ffa4v6m,t3_es94rh,1579727923.0,"I can say that EMDR has been working wonders for me. My trauma deals with a lot of family deaths  almost every year since I was 8...I'm in my mid 30s now. We just recently had another death this year...yeah 2020 sucks big time so far, but I've been able to cope so much better than before. I told my therapist that I feel weird because I've never processed death in such a healthy way before. I've got other issues that need dealt with, so I haven't been able to measure that progress yet. I don't feel tired after my sessions...and sometimes I find out more about my anxieties when doing EMDR with my therapist. Even have new ones surface that have been suppressed. It works for me...just give it a little longer."
pettyrevenge,ffa4082,t3_esat25,1579727437.0,I was always told that no one ever looks the exact same as they do in high school. Some people who were considered the hot popular kids are not so hot and popular now.

NoStupidQuestions,ff0rn45,t3_eqx1cv,1579471675.0,"I think it is completely fair. I had a friend once say that she couldn't take an extra break unless she was going outside to smoke. So smokers got extra breaks whenever they felt the need to feed their habit, but those who didn't have that habit had to wait till their actual break time to even go outside. The smokers received way more break time than the non-smokers. To make up for it the non-smokers should be allowed to have more time off."

I'm a little confused by this conflicting info. I thought the kitchen door was locked, but you start off with saying he went back through the kitchen door. But then you say he went through the car entrance...so which one did he really go through? If you wanted to go through great lengths to keep others out then why did you leave the biggest door unlocked? Was the kitchen door locked from the inside of the garage? I don't know any houses that have locks in a garage to keep people from entering from the attached house. I'm sorry, but none of this makes sense to me."

She would always bring up certain topics that made me teary eyed...then she would tell me that my tears were the reason she never talked about those topics with me. But she always found a way to bring them up and then would scold me for my reactions fully knowing what she was doing. I kicked that narcissistic bitch to the curb. It was a hard decision, but if you can't handle all of me then you don't get to have any of me. I may not always enjoy being a HSP, but I know that those feelings will always be apart of me. They are apart of who I am."
pettyrevenge,fenemat,t3_epp0gb,1579283033.0,"I peed my pants during gym class in first grade. Not on purpose though...sigh. We had to go outside and run on the track. Once outside, you really weren't allowed to go back in to the bathroom unless it was an emergency. I was too embarrassed to ask the gym teacher if I could go because I truly didn't want to miss gym class. I tried to play off my wet spot as sweat when a friend had asked what was wrong. Eventually, my 1st grade teacher noticed the spot on my shorts and she didn't buy the sweat idea...so off to the nurse I went to get new pants for the day. They phoned my mom to let her know what happened, but I was never sent home. I thought my hot pink Miss Piggy shirt went really well with the bright blue sweat pants the nurse let me borrow."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fencmdl,t3_eq11n1,1579281821.0,The best thing you did was remove yourself and your daughter from that abusive setting.

That is some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard of, and your post is the 2nd one I've seen of this nature. You aren't cheap...the bride and groom are. I could understand others paying if it were a destination wedding far away from home...but this doesn't sound like that kind of deal. If they can't afford their wedding then maybe they should have downsized. But hey, they will learn come Sunday when people don't show up or refuse to bring a gift because $50 a person is a lot of money to ask guests to pay for."

If deep in your heart you truly want children then you know you have some choices to make. Do you keep mom out for good? Do you slowly let her back in?
