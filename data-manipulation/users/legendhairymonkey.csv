iamatotalpieceofshit,fetevpm,t1_fetaj2r,1579374724.0,"I never said that thought was the crime. Having pederastic thoughts isn't a crime until you act on those thoughts or try to draw others into your way of thinking. Trying to spread a thought to others, drawing them into a system of thought, a way of thinking that has already been determined to be harmful is harmful in itself, and should be considered a crime. 

As for your other point ""ensuring nobody can gain enough power to create institutional violence"", isn't that the point of making the promotion of murderous ideologies such as nazism illegal? Aren't you contradicting yourself? And how does ""arming the populace"" help you now? Won't those fanatics be arming themselves too?"

lifehacks,ferjxey,t1_fericap,1579354836.0,"That's a fair point. I copied cassettes when I was a kid and think that a child's ability to enjoy free music is an important element of the music industry. An appreciation for music starts at a young age and those kids then go on to invest in the industry and spend money to enjoy it. My argument is more with the numerous people who can afford it but refuse to and think that they're entitled to shit for free, those who makes excuses for how $10 is too much money for them to pay."

I did use Napster a bit back in the day (when CDs were $12/$15 a pop), and If I can't find what I'm looking for anywhere legit I'll probably resort to a dodgy streaming service. I'm certainly not perfect. But with music at least it seems like we have a fair solution now that works for everyone. Looking for excuses not to have to pay $10 or listen to the odd advert is just cheap."
