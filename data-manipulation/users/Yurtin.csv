Kanye,fetv356,t1_fetsq08,1579380336.0,"I mean it depends on the belief, if you're gay you're not obligated to be friends with a homophobe. There's not really a hard rule on that stuff imo, you can't stick with someone if you have some irreconcilable difference and neither of you can change, but you can't drop people over any disagreement either, especially if they're close to you"
Kanye,fetr2xn,t1_fetptpe,1579378643.0,"Bernie and Trump is such a weird combo, I gotta ask, presumably you like both of them because they both would be considered ""outsiders"" as in anti establishment and stuff. Would that be accurate?"

Kanye,fet5519,t1_fesz7qe,1579371888.0,"I'm sure he would have done it back then too. I don't think he's homophobic at all but he probably doesn't think about the views of people he associates with, which is a different argument imo. Kanye has said some true shit but even when he called out Bush I'm not sure he was 100% educated on the subject"
Kanye,fet40oi,t1_fet254d,1579371621.0,"Trump's whole schtick was being an outsider, people that support him probably see him as different than normal politicians. Kanye definitely only likes him as like a contrarian thing, I can't remember the interview but someone asked him about the Muslim ban and he clearly had no clue"

ElderScrolls,fca3nij,t1_fca25uk,1577562607.0,Random question but your username is hardly based off Brian Boru lmao
ElderScrolls,fca3if5,t1_fc9wz0u,1577562547.0,Just depends where you started I guess. All of us who started with Skyrim are going to be having the same arguments with the ones starting with TES6
ElderScrolls,fca326y,t1_fc9muk7,1577562358.0,"I would argue that the Witcher offers choice in quests but literally nothing else. The exploration loop is non existent, you're just crossing off question marks on a map and they all fall into one of these categories:

1. A bunch of enemies and a chest
2. A bunch of enemies and a nest
3. A dead body and a treasure map

There's absolutely no reason to explore beyond looting. You'll never encounter anything interesting on the road so there's really no reason not to fast travel everywhere after you've done the points of interest on the way to wherever you're going. The only time I was ever remotely interested in a location was Novigrad (which blew my mind and is ten times better than any Elder Scrolls city), but again once you've done all the quests there's not much to offer. No interaction with NPCs outside of quests, shopkeeps and prostitutes lol. 

Skyrim has countless dungeons with marked and unmarked quests, a much more varied soundtrack and way more playstyles. You can join in defending a village from a dragon or just straight up kill everyone (asides from essentials, but still better than clicking your fing er in people's face). You can leave a city at one end of the map and go to the other end and have different encounters every time. Sure, the quests aren't as good, but you'll never get that undescribable immersive feeling from the Witcher that you get every playthrough in Skyrim"
ElderScrolls,fca18l1,t1_fc8jho4,1577561394.0,"I wouldn't call it an interactive movie but I completely understand your point, it's a lot less immersive and definitely discourages exploration beyond surface level ""go to question mark, kill enemy, get chest"". The quests are so good though"
ElderScrolls,fca10lz,t1_fc7xquh,1577561264.0,"Honestly the Witcher 3's open world is definitely bigger but it's not nearly as good as Skyrim's, you have literally no reason to ever revisit places of interest because there's only ever 3 enemies and a single chest there with no hidden stories to find. Quests are definitely way better but that's a given and I can't imagine anyone arguing. The only reason to go anywhere in the Witcher is for questing or to loot and I'd never do a no fast travel run like Skyrim because there's basically no point."
ElderScrolls,fc9zmgn,t3_egny7a,1577560593.0,"Skyrim was like my Oblivion/Morrowind. Sure, better games were made before and I've played better games since but I can't imagine myself ever getting that feeling back from first playing it"
