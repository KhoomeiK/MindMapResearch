Every nation has people who say things that are redundant or talk about stuff without research, I’m sure your country has plenty of people who do the same thing, it’s just that Reddit is an American website so you’ll see way more Americans than other people"

deadbydaylight,ff7je90,t1_ff74prd,1579650947.0,"Getting rid of ruin was a good thing IMO because of this:

When I started the game I could not play through ruin because of the skill checks and it was terrible and players forget that, Quality of Life for new players aside what this ruin change means is that the Devs can begin to balance killers in a way that does not include ruin. Without doing away with old ruin they could not do anything concerning Gen time without it becoming terribly OP."
enfj,ff79op9,t3_es12l7,1579644004.0,"My dad use to be mega stressed from work and home improvement and my mom had chronic migraines and those two factors led to a lot of fighting between them when I was like 8 to 14 and along with that my sister had downs so she was always favoured over me in everything which I didn’t understand at the time. 

So I guess I did have a form of trauma but I’m still figuring things out (18 now) I think because of all those factors (mostly the fighting) it caused me to learn how to read emotions so that I could try and curb any fights which translates to Fe which translates to ENFJs."
