AmItheAsshole,fci92wv,t3_eh6n83,1577659238.0,"NTA. Times infinity. It’s weird that she’s making your 11 and 13 year old bros call her “mom”, let alone a 17 yr old. The fact that your dad won’t talk about your mom, and just wants everything to be perfect, is concerning. Two pieces of advice from someone who went through something similar in their teens and is still dealing: 1. Try to get a counselor/therapist on your own, who you feel comfortable with and trust. There may be some free and confidential services ( great thing about the internet). 2. DO NOT LET THEM USE YOUR BROTHERS TO CONTROL YOU! Unless you are abusing them in some way, you are all separate individuals. They’re trying to control you with this nonsense. Get a therapist or something and be completely honest with them. And if anything the therapist suggests makes you uncomfortable, get a new one. I did not do either and suffered for too long."
