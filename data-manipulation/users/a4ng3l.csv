nottheonion,fff9v0s,t1_fff1lqm,1579879255.0,This was an interesting read. Thanks.
technology,ffcl6yx,t1_ffciufy,1579801811.0,"Well the one of your router is personal as well as far as I’m concerned... 
I work for a large Teclo/ISP and the internet sessions from customer devices - router, whatever the fuck behind their internal nat, their tv decoders... all of that is PII for us. Especially since as ISP we can link those to individuals. So no touchy unless we have a reason to, like support customers.
That’s obviously our internal assessment of GDPR but it’s a fair one I believe that is common in other similar companies."
technology,ffchvc9,t1_ffcgs6b,1579799798.0,"Why would IPs not fall under GDPR?
As soon as they can be linked to an individual they are PII. 
They are technical identifiers, especially when together with a timestamp, a mac address (one of the many device identifier btw)... 
At least that’s the guidance I gave in the company I work."
psytranceproduction,fezczde,t3_eqyrxn,1579456040.0,"Love it.
I’m going to try it using my peak. It’s filters are filthy enough to make it scream hopefully :)"

worldnews,feng9qn,t1_fenfgp8,1579284040.0,"Most likely indeed :-/
Unless a good dose of appropriation by states happen or maybe some regulation push?
Also sometimes I wonder to what extend some very good software would not work magic for small shops together with saner pricing with delivery services."
worldnews,fendere,t1_fen6lle,1579282298.0,"Well yeah online shopping > most physical places but amazon is far from being the ultimate shopping experience either.
I’d like to see more small shops having similar logistics than amazon though."
worldnews,fenck1g,t1_fenb5pe,1579281781.0,Or they are so close to full automation that the benefit PR wise is outweighing the risks of getting minimum wage raised...
todayilearned,fekvvj3,t1_fekvc3l,1579208676.0,"Well you should now European stuff better then :)
The e-privacy concerns cookies specifically while GDPR aims at personal data im general. A cookie not allowing for identification of an individual would not fall under the scope of GDPR but still in e-privacy. 

In french a detective is the shortened version of “private detective” hence my remark. I have no power similar to those of a police officer. Swedish is closer to English it seems making your quote more sensical to you I guess."
todayilearned,fekuohv,t1_fekuchq,1579207967.0,"What? No that’s not the same. Different sets of rules, controls and authorities.
And police and detectives are not the same thing either in europe... I’m technically a detective but clearly not a police officer.
You’re American?"
todayilearned,feku5wh,t1_fektzn7,1579207667.0,What? Nha that’s the e-privacy directive on top of the GDPR. More specific.
todayilearned,fektus8,t1_fekt8dv,1579207485.0,Well beside GDPR there’s also the cookies regulation and soon more :-/
synthesizers,feg6p71,t3_eormrt,1579079538.0,I’m doing that on my push 2 and it feels great. Admittedly I have no comparaison point...
cyberlaws,feg4tn4,t1_feg4gz0,1579076955.0,"I fully agree. Also the statement came from one of those contractors company directly impacted by third country transfer... 
It’s a funny time to work in data governance."
cyberlaws,feg1lbu,t1_fefyz8i,1579073006.0,"When you maintain large IT systems you often work with copies of your systems to test their behaviour after changes.
One copy for developers to work into, one for tests to be carried out, one for training purposes... and potentially more.
Those would be referenced to as non-production to contrast with the instance used to actually serve our customers.
The drama is that non-production systems generally use copy of production systems but with less security controls making them even more risky..."
cyberlaws,feee60q,t1_fedhrmz,1579031903.0,Territoriality is a bitch... But yeah... Not the worst I’ve read thought. Yesterday I learned that GDPR only applied to non-production data. Go figure.
namur,fdsa0wm,t1_fds9ytu,1578697800.0,En me relisant ça fait quand même vieux con ce commentaire -_-
namur,fds9ytu,t1_fds9kze,1578697761.0,"Honnêtement j’y ai trouvé assez à faire il y a 10 d’ici pour pas m’ennuyer... entre les bunker, les concerts et le reste c’était plus que suffisant même si c’était pas non plus le carré à Liège.
Maintenant je n’y vois plus grand chose comme vie nocturne ou activité mais c’est probablement moi qui ai mal vieilli ;-)
Quoi qu’il en soit ca reste une chouette ville et c’est aux jeunes d’en faire quelque chose de chouette."

MachinePorn,fderr8z,t1_fdeqtue,1578345240.0,"Don’t even the small ones requires a permit or something ?? I’m somewhat clumsy and am afraid to bust an hydraulic part by forcing too much is too compact dirt or something.
I’m conspiring to get the contractors that will do some digging for some transformation in my home to let me assist them though. I’d feel safer with some experimented operator. 

This being said you really have an awesome job."
MachinePorn,fdepg1w,t1_fdejbgn,1578343874.0,"Having a purpose is son satisfying whatever we do indeed.
On a side note I so much wish I could use an excavator just once... it seems so fucking epic. Do you get feedback from the bucket in the command or do you have to guess when you’re applying too much force?"

books,fd3nxzw,t3_ejwden,1578160135.0,"Thanks to transportation to work I have the opportunity to read 3 hours a day. That with reading in my hour-long bath means I get about 4 hours a day. 
I never got that much time to read younger :)
Also with the kindle it’s much more easy to get new books - no ordering that takes weeks for good SF books. I’m a bit sad about not collecting books anymore but space was becoming an issue anyway."
printSF,fd03kct,t1_fcypzpp,1578113110.0,And there’s like 2 encyclopaedia in the series of book that explain somewhat how magic works and it is at least consistent. Plus the whole system is hilarious :)
Wallonia,fcwup7f,t1_fcwltwp,1578038383.0,"Ca a le mérite de faire prendre l’air aux jeunes plutôt que de les taper devant un écran. Et les zoos jouent un rôle dans la conservation des espèces.

Wallonia,fcmpon8,t3_ei0giu,1577786051.0,Triste de voir dans le rapport à la source ( https://aim-ima.be/IMG/pdf/binge_drinking_2019_annexe.pdf ) que les statistiques sont largement influencées par les jeunes avec intervention majorée (population plus fragile) :-/

De mon avis tu dois pas absolument les lire dans l’ordre de parution mais plutôt par cycle. Mon préféré étant celui de la garde avec Sam Vimes qui est franchement grandiose et dans les derniers publiés (et donc plus mature ds l’écriture aussi)."
