Very happy I’m a member of a union that gives equal treatment to both men and women. An acquaintance of mine who is definitely a “teacher hater” scoffed at the idea of me taking time off. He even asked about my wife’s 12 weeks of disability and remarked and I shit you not with this quote “whatever happened to women giving birth in the field and getting right back to work”.

The amount of looks and what I saw as unnecessary praise from the older generations as I was out in public was ridiculous. I had people ask me “if my wife passed away” or would say “oh your doing a mother’s job”. I was proud to stay home with my daughter, and I’d do it again if I had the chance."
