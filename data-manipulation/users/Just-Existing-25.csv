Companies in your prospective field can peruse through resumes and screen candidates they feel are a natural fit. Don’t beat yourself up, shit happens to the best of us, you WILL bounce back from this."
offmychest,ffej3cu,t3_et3we3,1579850079.0,"Understand this, the right woman will love you for who you are, looks included. She’ll love and adore you to the point where you don’t have a choice but to love and appreciate yourself for attracting someone so genuine at heart. Until the time comes, continue to build yourself. Work on being the friend you’d like to have, and demonstrate the characteristics of which you’d like to see in a partner. There’s always going to be shallow people out there, but remember this, there’s plenty of fish in the sea, and the deeper the ocean, the more room you have to swim. Love yourself, buddy. Cheers!"
