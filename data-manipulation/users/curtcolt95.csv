nba,fg7f3a3,t1_fg6lz80,1580590960.0,"I'd actually put Tiger ahead in terms of player who absolutely dominated their sport. Tiger put up numbers that were so insanely far ahead of the pack that courses had to be adjusted to make it fair again. There was a period of time where he was so incredibly dominant that the numbers honestly don't seem real, see [here](https://www.golfchannel.com/article/golf-central-blog/stats-incredible-tigers-40-greatest-numerical-records). Not to mention the comeback story he had last year after all that time."

I like building my agility level up in order to regen run faster, it feels like my character is actually slowly getting better. Same with being able to buy or make stamina potions to forgo that, these things personally add to the fun of the game, not take away."

pokemon,fefmubf,t1_fef76kx,1579059753.0,"the wild area had potential to save them some face from the terrible routes but it was so disappointing. You could explore the whole thing in an hour and there was barely anything that couldn't be explored right from the first time you find it, the only thing is the one area across the water. That's the main thing the game lacked, there was no reason to ever go back and explore places. There was like 2 side areas in the whole game that you could go explore after getting the water bike. Not that there would have even been room to put them in the super small routes of the game. The game overall just felt like it had so much less exploration than the others, even if it's just fake exploration that's only a side path it still had way less. The main thing I enjoy in pokemon games is that exploration so to say I was disappointed in sword and shield would be an understatement."
pokemon,fefm3ok,t1_feexwoa,1579059265.0,"Glimwood is quite possibly the most disappointing route in the game. I actually had to laugh at how short it was, like I legit couldn't believe they would even consider that its own route it was so short."

pokemon,fdtr3q8,t1_fdtpmpp,1578720893.0,Yeah this is kinda the reason I said this gen was such a bad time to introduce dlc. It's this weird situation where had the base game been good people would have been extremely happy but now we're at this point where getting it all in a third game is actually preferable.

pokemon,fdtifvg,t1_fdt5jcd,1578717216.0,I think almost everyone would agree that going the way of dlc is much more favourable than making a full priced third game that's just a glorified expansion. That being said they probably couldn't have picked a worse generation to start doing this model because of all the complaints about the base game not being worth the price.
pokemon,fdthzb2,t1_fdsg9x3,1578717027.0,"Sword and Shield are absolutely not worth the AAA console price tag they were given. They have some of the shortest routes of any game and the wild area doesn't even come close to making up for it. I'm incredibly happy that gamefreak are moving to the dlc model but it's also a bittersweet feeling because I don't feel it's worth it for this particular pokemon generation. They probably could have won me over by releasing one of the expansions for free then charging for the second but as it is now it only really leaves a bad taste in my mouth, which sucks because I feel the need to support it because I'd like them to do dlc in the future, just with a better base game."
