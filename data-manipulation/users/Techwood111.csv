Keep in mind Leafs were the first mass-market EV, paving the way for Tesla and everyone else.  Yes, Tesla had the electrified Lotus in 2008, but those 2,500 niche cars didn't change the landscape anywhere near how Nissan did, and Tesla didn't even touch the numbers Nissan was putting out until very recently.  The Leaf is still the best-selling EV of all time.

I have looked at lots of different temperature controllers, and have a level of familiarity with them, but I am not seeing any that would allow me to have a second temperature setpoint after a variable time period.  While I see several that have programmable ramp/soak thermal curves (like for  surface-mount soldering baths), I don't see anything that allows for the pattern to be easily adjusted.

Similarly, temperature controls I've generally worked with tend to be made where it is not easy to adjust their setpoint.  Doing so repeatedly could stand to break the membrane switches, for instance, where a nice knob would be great.

Ease of adjustability, two setpoints, and a timer between those setpoints seems like it would render a temp/process controller insufficient for the task."

I'm not sure why you are controlling speed, or even powering the wheel for that matter.  But, hey, your project.

Keep in mind that there are ways to do things wirelessly.  You need not have wires.  But, there are also ways of ""wiring"" to things that spin.  Slip rings are an example, as are things like carbon brushes against a commutator.  You might be too young to have ever seen a telephone handset cord, but they get twisted up over time due to how people handle the handset.  In any event, [a product was made to deal with that](https://www.google.com/search?q=handset+de-twist&safe=off&tbm=isch).

Amazon has some 12-wire slip rings for about $20.  This isn't my strong suit, but I think that'd almost give you what you need to uniquely identify 36 spaces.  Imagine you used a steel ball bearing for the ball, and each ""number"" had a hole in it where the ball would come to rest.  Put a pair of contacts in each hole.  For six adjacent holes, wire ""Wire 1"" to one of the contacts.  Then, wire Wire 7 to the other side of the first hole, Wire 8 to the other side of the second hole, and so on, up to Wire 12.  Then, do this with the next block of 6, using Wire 2 as the first contact.  Something like:
  
Number | Left Contact | Right Contact
---|---|----
1 | 1 | 7
2 | 1 | 8
3 | 1 | 9
4 | 1 | 10
5 | 1 | 11
6 | 1 | 12
7 | 2 | 7
8 | 2 | 8
9 | 2 | 9
... | ... | ...
35 | 6 | 11
36 | 6 | 12

Those wires would then go perhaps to a 6 x 6 matrix of LEDs.  Each LED could represent one spot on the wheel.  Each combination of (1-6) and (7-12) would make a single LED light, *somewhat* like [this picture](http://lednique.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Multiplexed-display-all-switches-open.png).

I guess you could also do that with some decoder ICs like the 74LS138.  You can also use some critters like BCD to 7-segment display drivers.  Anything's possible, really!

You could simplify the whole damn thing and still prove your concept by having a much smaller roulette wheel, like 16 or fewer holes.

Maybe some of this will give you some ideas.  Good luck!"
