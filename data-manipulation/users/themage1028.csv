Further learning on it has led me to understand that thorium is turned into uranium to be used as fuel. After that process, it's basically the same thing.

There's still less environmental impact because thorium is MUCH more common in the Earth's crust, so we're not doing any invasive mining to get it. That, as I understand it, is the only change.

But my understanding is also basic."

Full bodily autonomy cannot override the right to life of another human being. Both parties have to adhere to the NAP, not just the unborn child.

Since the fetus is not behaving in any way that is unnatural or outside normally expected behavior, the fetus is not in violation of the NAP.

A lot of people sleep through the night and wake up feeling like they haven't slept well, when actually, they have low blood sugar instead because they haven't eaten since supper and what they ate wasn't necessarily long-term stabilizing to blood sugar.

A handful of raw almonds literally just before going to sleep might help."
