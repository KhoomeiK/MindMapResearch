BorderlinePDisorder,fcqzuxt,t3_e80chc,1577894695.0,"I've been taking it two weeks now and I've had nothing but a positive experience. I take 300 mg 1 tablet at night and yes I slept like the dead for the first 3 days or so but now it just gives a good nights sleep and I wake up fine. I was also hungry the first few days (weight gain is also a concern for me) but that tapered off and now I don't feel any more hungry than usual. I even feel motivated to start my January diet! 

What the biggest thing for me has been is the anxiety quelling effects. By the next day it was like my ball of anxiety (that not even copious amounts of propanolol could touch) in my stomach was melted away. After being indoors for weeks I even went out to a busy high street and only felt slight discomfort. For me this is the most massive night and day change compared to how I was struggling before being put on this and I'm so pleased with it. Overall I rate Seroquel as being positive and the thing I've needed in my life. 

My advice would be that everyone is different but try taking it earlier in the evening so you sleep it off during the whole night and get some healthy snacks in now its post Christmas like fruit or rice cakes if you find yourself still hungry. I hope you're doing ok OP"
