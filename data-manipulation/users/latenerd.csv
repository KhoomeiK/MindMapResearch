Like, did OP even read the article? There are very valid criticisms of the movement and several stories about activists of color treated unfairly.

The writer walked away to work on a BETTER movement. That's not insane.

PoliticalHumor,fgxzgqw,t1_fgxw20r,1581177982.0,Spending all your time on Reddit trolling for a man who doesn't give two shits about you. He'd sell your ass for a single Sudafed. Find something better to do with your life.

Enablers are often narcs in disguise.

I can tell you with certainty that your grandmother is not a good person because she never tried to get you out. She does not deserve your sacrifice. Can you imagine watching a child you love being abused that way and never trying to save them?

Please, please SAVE YOURSELF. You don't deserve this hell. And it is within your power to get out.

You won't be as selfish as your father if you just leave. You'll be a survivor. You'll be doing the right thing. And if you are worried about her still, you can report him for elder abuse.

I wish you the best of luck whatever you decide to do."
