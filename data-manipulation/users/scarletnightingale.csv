It feels more like he was always trying to run out the clock by constantly saying ""Soon, but not now"" and now by giving the excuse of ""You're too old"".

AmItheAsshole,fg0534i,t1_ffzh108,1580400397.0,"You aren't so much a bridezilla as the wicked stepmother who somehow doesn't see that she is the wicked stepmother.  She only lost her mother 2 years ago and you are systematically going around trying to erase her, and somehow sending her away for school to remove her dad from her life as well.  Congratulations on being the thing every child who loses a parent at a young age fears the most.  Also, the wedding isn't just about you, it is about all of you becoming a family.


Also, are you seriously going to try to throw out the mother's clothing and pictures?  That is all this girl has left of her mother.  And why in the hell do you think you know better than her therapist?  The person who went and studied for this for years and who does this every day?"

Basically you should never blind-side the couple, and the couple has to be in on it and on board, both those criteria were more than met."

Your wife had her hours cut and told you that she is struggling with depression to the point that she can't even get out of bed and your response was to scream at her, throw things, insult her, tell her she was ruining your life, destroy things, then demand a divorce?  I hope for her sake that you do end up divorced because she deserves better than you.

This went on over the course of several days, and if she was drunk that entire time, well, then she has a serious problem.  She likely had this planned for a bit and decided to act on it the moment she took his number out of your phone.  She wanted to cheat on you, she tried to cheat on you, and who knows, maybe she has cheated on you in the past.  Her being drunk does not justify several days of inappropriate behavior and her begging your friend and his girlfriend to sleep with her."

Another one was fired because well... she was terrible, constantly overstepped bounds, refused to talk to people who had HR issues (like slammed her door in their face so she wouldn't have to talk to them), made errors then tried to blame everyone else.  Another one saw someone being sexually harassed and told the boss of the harass-y to tell the harass-y she needs to dress so she doesn't get harassed (AC was broken in the middle of summer in 90-100 degree weather and it was a tank top).

AmItheAsshole,ffv0vq2,t1_ffub599,1580253124.0,"So... for the last 5 years you have been working and raising his daughter while he did nothing.  Then a year ago you had his twins, have been raising them, and his daughter, and taking care of the house work, while he still did nothing.  He's taking advantage of you.  Why do you put up with this?"
AmItheAsshole,ffv0nt8,t3_ev8oh0,1580252990.0,"NTA.  Your husband however is.  He doesn't get to ignore his children because they ""don't have personality right now"".  Children are not toys, they are things he helped bring into this world and he needs to stop up and take care of them whether he thinks they are interesting or not.  Also, while that is the excuse he is using for not helping with the babies (who at 10 months I am sure are exhibiting personalities), what exactly is his excuse for not helping with Emma?  She certainly has a personality at the age of 13.  Your sister is also being an asshole by trying to make you feel bad rather than realizing how clearly strained you are.

AmItheAsshole,ffu92cm,t1_fftcwbj,1580237048.0,"Also, the part about ""Samantha doesn't even like soda!"" as if that somehow removed the possibility of her daughter even being near the desk and accidentally knocking the soda over, possibly while reaching for the computer.  I wouldn't be shocked of a kid who spends all her time watching tv and playing on her phone wanted to watch some videos on youtube and went directly to the closest computer."
AmItheAsshole,ffu8rum,t1_fftb5p5,1580236875.0,"But her child is and innocent angel who would never do anything wrong, unlike her horrible niece who didn't even want to provide her with free babysitting services! /s"
AmItheAsshole,ffu8lmq,t3_ev4r6c,1580236772.0,"YTA.  Why was her mother forced to pay her instead of you?  You are forcing your niece to babysit your child and expect her to do it for free because... what?  Because she is family (that you clearly don't like)?  Because you claim your daughter is easy?  Frankly i'm inclined to believe that your daughter did spill the soda.  You say that Sam had a history of lying, when she was a little girl.  She's an adult now, not a little girl anymore.  You claim your daughter never could have gotten up to the computer, but one thing I know about kids is that they do have a way of getting into places you would never expect.  Your excuse that your daughter doesn't drink soda doesn't change that she could have knocked over the thing of soda even if she wasn't trying to drink it.  Also, I would be very inclined to believe that a kid who spends a lot of time playing on her phone and watching TV would be very interesting in a laptop.


Also, still, just because she was going to be home does not in anyway entitle you to Samantha being your unpaid babysitter, especially when you have so much contempt for her, calling her prickly, a liar, rebellious, guzzler of soda...  She literally does the same things that your daughter does, which is watch and read things on her computer which you hold in contempt and use as a reason to exploit her for free babysitting while the same things make your daughter sweet and innocent and barely need watching.  Lila wouldn't be the first child to lie when they did something bad, as you know, since you clearly haven't forgotten that your niece used to do that when she was young."

Do you know what kind of ring you would want? I've always wanted this style..."", if you wanted it to be a surprise.


In terms stones, if you were sticking to the type of jewelry she has now, sapphire might be a good choice if she actually wanted something non-traditional.  Based on her being a Virgo, she'd be born either at the end of August or the early part of September, blue sapphire is the birthstone for that month, it is also fairly hard which would make it a good choice.  Sapphire also comes in lots of other colors including all the ones that you mentioned.  You could research vintage sapphire rings or you could order a stone and a setting separately.  However, before you do this, see if you can find out if she actually wants a non-traditional ring first.  You could research art deco and art nouveau style rings or nature inspired rings.  While moonstone is pretty and I know that some people get it for their engagement ring I wouldn't personally just because it isn't as hard and I tend to be a bit rough on my jewelry (I'm clumsy).  Sapphire is a 7.8 on the Moh's hardness scale, Moonstone is a 6.0; diamond is 10, moissanite is 9.5 which is part of why they are more popular, they hold up well to daily wear.  Whatever you end up going with, make sure to research the stone type and see if it would mesh with her lifestyle."

Do you really want to guarantee that she is mocked and bullied about her name for the rest of her life?  Honestly, you're either a troll or you are only seeing what you want to see."
AmItheAsshole,ff9zhxh,t3_esbrn4,1579724822.0,"YTA.  I guarantee that if you do this your children are going to feel like you abandoned them to start a new family with your new partner.  Also, you say that you would be willing to drive 15 hours to pick up the kids and visit once in a while.  You aren't accounting for the fact of how much that 15 hour drive back is going to suck for your kids.  I've done it, my grandparents lived 12-15 hours away.  You know how often I saw them?  Once a year if I was lucky, and that drive to see them was excruciating.  Also, right now you are splitting your time with them between you and your ex equally, you are now planning on leaving them with her for the vast majority of the time which is incredibly difficult since she is now going to be in essence a single mother with no help from the children's dad except when he shows up on Saturdays to be the cool dad.


Also, something else I don't think you have considered, you are going to be taking off driving there on the weekends to hang out with your kids for... 1 day since you will be presumably driving all day Friday and all day Sunday, is your partner going to be cool with you just leaving her alone with the new baby for three days all the time?  If you want better pay, look for a job closer to home.  That is the consequence of having children, you don't get to put your wants and needs first."

I know not everyone is good at baking, no judgement there.  That's the thing though, you have to know when it isn't your strong suit, enough so that you go ""Hmmm...

Your husband was a jerk, he unapologetically ate her dinner, that she had made herself, then demanded you make her some more.  You're right, he should have made her some dinner after that.  Where you went wrong was that you chose to continue arguing over who's job it was to feed your child, to the point that you child went to bed hungry.  You both got so caught up in your own argument and pettiness that you neglected the person who it was actually about and left her to suffer the consequences.
