aww,ffbi47p,t3_eskzi1,1579766345.0,"Boot acclimation should be done VERY slowly, with lots of whatever high value reinforcement the dog finds as motivating as possible. The more exciting, the better. Think hitting jackpot prizes at the slots in Vegas. Literal baby steps of playing with feet while the boots are out in sight, putting one shoe on, letting dog walk or move around normally, two shoes, etc, etc, over many training sessions (sometimes spanning a few weeks). There's lots of really great YouTube videos that go through a step by step process, but strapping them on and letting them do that weird 'these things are eating my feet!' dance is just a dog panicking and creating a negative association.
