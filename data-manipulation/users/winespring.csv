gaming,ffdiwuh,t1_ffdgw66,1579821829.0,">You're being very naive here. I'm an actual VR developer, so I'll give you the industry standard take on what it's like.
Building a flight simulator without VR in mind doesn't provide any benefit aside from that it takes less time to complete.

From a consumer point of view it means that the game has to be on par with all of the other flat screen games in its genre, graphically, game modes, replayability etc. They can't rely on the fact that VR gamers will happily buy less polished games.

>So is the extra time required for VR worth it? Well it would ensure that immersion is better catered for and the game would be more optimized, so as long as you want a better game, then VR first is the best way to do this.
>It's a difficult development process, but if you're asking for the best game, it makes no sense to add VR support later on even if you don't use VR, because when the game does launch, it means you'll get better spatial audio, better performance, likely more realistically modelled cockpits without bump mapping, etc

Again as a consumer, why would I care about how much extra time it takes? All I want is for them to commit to making the best flight sim in the franchise, and then do whatever it takes to make it work in vr. If they succeed I'll happily buy it, if not I have plenty of games in my backlog."

I have an index, the best game experiences on it have been skyrimvr(heavily modded),project cars 2, elite and dangerous, and no mans sky. The trend is that they were all big budget expansive games that have had vr added to them. Probably because it is easier to add vr to an existing great game than it is to get AAA funding for a primarily vr game. One of the best vr games of last year(boneworks), has almost no story, no AI, no multiplayer, etc, it's a great experience  but it definitely does not have the depth of its flat screen peers.
