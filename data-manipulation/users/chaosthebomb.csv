My allergist said I was a good candidate to at least try living with one. My mother however, is much more severely allergic and would never get the same recommendation."
aww,ffcogxt,t1_ffco4no,1579803816.0,"They produce less of the protein which causes allergies. They aren't free from it, but it is greatly reduced. My allergist recommended I get one when they're a kitten so I can build up an immunity to the small amount she does produce. I've had her since April last year and aside from a little sneezing the first week I've had no other symptoms around her. I've heard there is no guarantee depending on your level of reaction to the protein but my allergist thought it would at least be worth trying."
aww,ffcneex,t1_ffbtawm,1579803153.0,And they're hypoallergenic. Which is why I recently added princess Sibertron to my family https://imgur.com/6XZXSaL.jpg

Calgary,fdo5s2y,t1_fdnpqxt,1578599393.0,"I had a rental a few years back and all the dash lights came on with the car. I legit had no idea my lights weren't on since I was driving in a well lit part of th city. Someone pulled up beside me, rolled down their window and politely let me know. 


I try and pay it forward by flashing my high beams behind people with lights off, but they never seem to get the hint."
Calgary,fdnckc1,t3_em579t,1578582880.0,When Sobeys bought Safeway they had an integration plan to evaluate all the store brand products and keep the 'best' one. It's amazing how compliments always was superior! /s
worldnews,fd7x8zg,t1_fd7lyxh,1578211369.0,"I wish this was true, but a 2 party system controlled by lobbyists with the most $ has really ruined the idea that a vote matters. I fucking wish it did, but no matter who gets into office, they'll push an agenda that helps the people that sponsored them to get there."
AskReddit,fcuiinz,t1_fcu2pnh,1577981766.0,"I found with tinder it was just a numbers game. First off if you read their profile and are very selective with who you swipe, you're going to get waste time on someone who may never match with you. I only ever bothered to read profiles after a match, and unmatch if I needed to at that point.


Out of every hundred or so swipes, I would average about 6 matches and out of those 6 I'd say only 1-2 of them resulted in dates. My chances were low so I diversified with other apps, coffee meets bagel, bumble, etc. That greatly upped my swipes to date ratio but I still found that most the people I met didn't have that spark I was looking for. Eventually I matched with my dream girl about 3 years ago. She ghosted me after 4 months so I settled for my second choice and have been with her since :p just kidding I'm glad things worked out the way they did."
facepalm,fc36t3h,t1_fc28ntz,1577382843.0,"I used to attend church every Sunday while I was younger. My pastor during his sermon one day told me god had granted him the power to walk on water. He was very engaging and singled me out and asked, did I think he could. He proceeded to pour a glass of water on the floor, and then walked across it. I believe the message of the sermon was that you should be skeptical of what you hear as things can be twisted. Out of all the religious people I met, especially for someone who was a pastor. He was the most open minded when it came to literal interpretation of the Bible."
