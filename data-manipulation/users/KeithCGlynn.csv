reddevils,ffmeej6,t3_eu7oso,1580053319.0,One thing that is clear to me today. Perreira has no business starting for United.
reddevils,ffmau5g,t3_eu7oso,1580051537.0,"He was lining that up a while. If he can easily score a screamer like that, I think we might be able to destroy them."

ireland,ffir0g1,t3_etq8w1,1579980544.0,I think the type of person who cares about the colour of a passport has no use for a passport.
reddevils,ffipg51,t3_erbmfb,1579979450.0,Do we have an actual scouting system? Did all the scouts go after Ferguson retired?
ireland,ffcoei1,t1_ffco9c3,1579803774.0,Probably not.
ireland,ffbm0a6,t3_esql27,1579771954.0,"I doubt Martin will engage in corruption himself like Bertie Ahern. That said, if it exists amongst his ministerial ranks or TDs would he be the one to rid it from the government? Unlikely. He will turn a blind eye to it and we know some back benchers have no issue with being a little corrupt."
ireland,ffblugx,t1_ffbldlu,1579771706.0,He could have just remembered this and decided to look it up. Google is an incredible tool.
ireland,ffaizyx,t1_ffaffun,1579736900.0,"I doubt that tbh. 

Ireland's Theocracy was what the people wanted at the time and I think Collins would have done the same thing as De Valera in giving the Church power."

todayilearned,ff1m28y,t1_ff1j33k,1579481415.0,I need to believe this. I want to live to be old.
reddevils,fez4oxr,t3_eqy9sn,1579453826.0,Can we stop being like pool fans and believing there is a global conspiracy against our club. Pool are the better of the two clubs today so far.
reddevils,fez0gpn,t3_eqy9sn,1579452736.0,"I know this sub is super defensive of him because he is a fan of the club but so am I. That said, I should be no where near the team. Can we please stop playing Perreira?"
ireland,fesmuuw,t1_feshkd4,1579366914.0,"You are 50% right.

He is doing a good job on brexit and keeping business happy.

On issues relating to the people like housing, there has been no real effort to improve the situation. None that I can see. He is very much a conservative in the sense that he believes government intervention in the market will cause more harm than good. That is his belief.  In this sense, he is doing a good job because he is standing by what he believes. The problem is if you want ireland's housing situation to be fixed, healthcare to be at the same level as other EU countries and other urgent issues, don't vote Fine Gael because it will not be fixed with them in the immediate future (next 5 years). If we go into another recessions, chances are these things will actually get much much worse."
reddevils,femmsrg,t1_femhjhj,1579262951.0,I assume you are joking but Rooney was pretty bad near the end. I can't imagine what he would be like now.
ireland,fejvr9q,t1_fejdpz3,1579186970.0,People say that because they actually want to vote fg/ff but don't want to defend it or argue about it.
ireland,fejt5o4,t1_fejqsq2,1579185228.0,People of Dublin were annoyed by the 1916 rising initially. It was the deaths that changed people's perspective. There is no way to protest correctly without being inconvenient to the general population.

ireland,fef0nsq,t3_eotoju,1579045413.0,"The Third Man is my favourite movie but I will admit he after reading the whole article that he is guilty of British misunderstanding and bias. He seems to be misinformed on the role the british army is playing in the situation and other things. That said, I find this line striking as to how bad the situation was. This is based on what he saw and experienced. It is interesting to see the troubles through the eyes of a english catholic who saw the irish independence movement of the 1920s and experience world war 2."
ireland,fdq9gz5,t1_fdq85ty,1578660196.0,"We need to also acknowledge that it isn't all English we should hate. Most of their working class is filled with people whose ancestors were forced to leave Ireland during the famine and other hard periods of our past. If you look at Liverpool for example: Gerrard, Rooney, Lennon and McCarthy all have Irish ancestry. We need to focus on the people still profiting or benefiting from colonialism. For example I don't think May, Cameron or Johnson have any Irish blood in them. If it is possible, we need to make brexit hard for these people. The swine of society."
ireland,fdq6eyr,t1_fdosw0c,1578656888.0,Tbf that is true for most of us.
ireland,fdk5wv7,t1_fdgzw2t,1578496798.0,I was in a pub in Galway and the old bartender told me I looked just like him. Never felt prouder to look like this.
todayilearned,fdjw7h2,t1_fdjmra6,1578489500.0,"That said, it was a British newspaper that started the epidemic. I think it was the daily mail that ran the article."
ireland,fdjqamx,t3_elqvc4,1578483303.0,"There are some very obvious things you never do in Ireland:

Honour Cromwell

Honour black and tans 

Blame the farmers for the famine


The way this government is going, I wouldn't be surprised if they end up doing all three"

videos,fdf6nla,t1_fdes27m,1578354528.0,I am a massive Orson Welles fan. I think Vincent Donofrio is a terrific voice actor but his Orson Welles isn't very good. The worst part is so many people do his version of Welles. I feel Candy's version of Welles is much closer. I know I will get downvoted for this but watch Welles on Cavett and watch this clip and you will notice the difference.
worldnews,fd7jomr,t1_fd5xvvn,1578205569.0,People forget one of the reasons the league of nations failed is because the US refused to join. America isn't interested in peace. It's only concern is power.
gaming,fczibgo,t1_fcz6g70,1578101876.0,"It was a power grab from Russia. The czar wanted to maintain Russia status as a great power.  Serbia was a disputed zone and Franz Ferdinand was unwise to visit it. A lot of mistakes were made and a lot of assumptions were made. Austria and Russia would not have fought the war if they knew the world of 1919. It was absolutely not worth it for either powers. None gained. Both lost greatly. 

I can see Iran being a similar situation. What do the US and Iran gain from an all out war?"

reddevils,fcsy6sz,t1_fcss7no,1577928079.0,"It is obvious because you have heard it now. Do you really think that every manager thinks to say to players if they don't pass the ball to player X, they will not start? Ferguson knew what he had and what to do with it. Just because it seems obvious, doesn't mean it actually is."
todayilearned,fcsxchl,t1_fcsnz6o,1577927487.0,"I am sure this isn't just a crazy idea from one person but something that was in discussion among many people, even educated people. It was a theory and he wanted to explore it. My confusion is why did he assume they were intelligent beings that we could trade with? Proving they exist is one thing but it is another thing to assume they were intelligent along with it."
