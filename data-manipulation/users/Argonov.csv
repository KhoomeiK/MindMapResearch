My boyfriend is a total twink. A lot of the people we hook up with are definitely skinnier. Male and female. Idk, people like the chub. Especially in the winter.

I think you're right. A lot of it is confidence. I dont care as much about the size as I do what they're like and what they're into."

Bossfight,fckzozv,t1_fcks4ot,1577736650.0,"The US has some amazing pizza but depending on where you are it can be hard to find. Then you have the blood feuds between the Chicago style people and the New York style people (New York is giant triangle slices, chicago is pizza casserole). Many states are a neutral battleground between the 2 ideologies, with shifts usually based on location. I live near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which is closer to New York so there is a bias towards NY style pizza but Chicago style does have footholds. This would matter more to people but Pittsburgh doesnt have very good pizza anymore. My guess is that the family places all use the same supplier because it all tastes the same. Chain pizza is really popular around Pittsburgh because of this. Through this wasteland, pizzahut and little caesar's among others have managed to prosper. Any hope of good pizza requires a trek further north to NY or west towards chicago. But you could end up sucked into an ohio pizza place and that's honestly the same shit different day of Pennsylvania. 

So to answer your question in short, Dominos is probably better in the US if you dont have any other options but it's probably not much better than UK Dominos."
