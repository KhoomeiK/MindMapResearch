worldnews,fgmbn2l,t1_fgm55mo,1580921507.0,"My point is that the virus exists.

And its going to kill people. 

These are unavoidable facts. 

Now that we've come to terms with these facts, isn't it nice that it doesn't kill everyone? 


What did you expect people to do? Go to sleep and dream of a world without the virus?"
worldnews,fgm45ta,t1_fgm38gk,1580917670.0,"People die. Its an idea you need to get used to.

Another idea : silver linings. 

Healthy young people are spared. The problem already exists. Why are you still dreaming? People are dying. It's good that young healthy people probably won't. 

 Wouldn't it be great if no one ever died and we had free energy? We don't. Too bad. It would be great if this disease doesn't exist so no one's life is cut short. Wake up. It exists."
AskReddit,fgm34kf,t1_fglppx9,1580917065.0,"I'm sure you'll encounter some ice on the way.

Could use that."
worldnews,fgm2oxe,t1_fgm09b4,1580916791.0,"And 30s dying from this isn't the norm either.

I'm not sure what your point is. 80% of the deaths occurred in patients who were over 60 AND had preexisting conditions. 

A friend of mine passed away from cancer last year at 35. It's rare, but it happens."
todayilearned,fglx1lf,t1_fglwyze,1580913016.0,"Pfft here in reddit, anything you can't disproof is fact."
worldnews,fglwyf4,t1_fglwjk9,1580912953.0,"Wait.

How old did you think I was talking about when I mentioned cancer age bias.?"
todayilearned,fglrvpb,t1_fglrfh1,1580909358.0,You guys need to chill. Hitler didn't.
todayilearned,fglr63n,t1_fglr08i,1580908774.0,"At one point Hitler was also just an artist.

Did I really need to clarify it was a joke?"
todayilearned,fglqxr3,t1_fglq76w,1580908580.0,"Give trump time.

He can probably do that war crime shit faster than Hitler managed to."
worldnews,fglqeum,t1_fgl4wzg,1580908132.0,"This is true for many illnesses and it gives me comfort. 

For example, cancer is very biased to the old. Live long enough and you'll get cancer. 

I'm very much comforted that the ""live long enough"" part exists in that sentence."
worldnews,fglq8l3,t1_fgkyq5b,1580907978.0,"When there's not enough test kits to test everyone, the confirmed case number is a function of available test kits, not the infected population."
worldnews,fglq4bg,t1_fgll85e,1580907873.0,"They are super efficient at everything they want to do.

The problem is doing things that will move them forward. 

China has been doing many right things, which is why they are growing so fast. They did many wrong things a few decades ago very efficiently too, which left the world scratching its head. You did what to all your tools?"
nottheonion,fgln2v9,t1_fglld2o,1580905012.0,Life expectancy if I recall correctly is actually longer if you get aids because you take care of yourself better and go see the doctor regularly.
worldnews,fgkjp40,t1_fgkfyht,1580867138.0,"And if you never go there, you'll never have to say you didn't get arrested for saying it."
worldnews,fgiak4d,t1_fgi9vw9,1580814191.0,"No there are fires in some theatres.

You can't shout fire if you don't see fire in your your theatre."
worldnews,fgi9kmz,t1_fgi91ys,1580812795.0,"You build an emergency hospital not based on how serious an illness is, but how much you need to increase your facilities to handle the new load.

In a way, the heavier load is due to people panicking too, and I think every nation in the world would do the same thing if their hospitals suddenly overloaded like that.

The problem with videos like the one you posted is that it's a video with context completely supplied by the poster. He doesn't couldn't possibly know it's the corona virus, and on some level everyone knows he couldn't know that. But people believe him anyway."
AskReddit,fgi7g3k,t1_fghjidk,1580809547.0,This never occurred to me. You're allowed to drive if you only have use of one hand?

worldnews,fgi6ryp,t1_fgi5wv1,1580808500.0,"Actually all you have to do is look at the death toll outside China.

If China is underreporting, everyone else is in on the game."
worldnews,fgi6q3o,t1_fgi4kn2,1580808417.0,"People actually die when panic starts and the hospitals get overwhelmed.

7 years is light."
worldnews,fgi6nvb,t1_fgi1913,1580808321.0,"Fake news regarding the virus to in this current climate is really just a ramped up version of shouting ""fire"" in a theatre. It causes mass panic and people can actually die.

I have no problems with people who get caught spreading misinformation being locked up and the key thrown away. 

This includes the asshats who shout ""fire"" but just happened to save everyone because there was a fire they didn't know about."
worldnews,fgi6itx,t1_fgi2wp8,1580808103.0,"I love it when experts on reddit make fun of people actually living there for their ""ignorance"".

Seriously, did you think he would miss the censorship if he has to actively use euphemisms in his chats?"
todayilearned,fgi64oo,t1_fghy5sj,1580807492.0,People buy 11 year olds the latest iPhone?
worldnews,fghnad8,t1_fgg0and,1580788768.0,"So much this.

So many governments are ""covering up"" each year if staying at home and not being treated is considered covering up."
worldnews,fghlmvx,t1_fghhttj,1580787627.0,And I was agreeing with you.
worldnews,fgh9tkq,t1_fggrehr,1580780025.0,"The other conclusion to draw could be that other countries are also underreporting. Its a global conspiracy!

That's why we shouldn't jump to conclusions. You could conclude anything."

worldnews,fgfww7w,t1_fgfu9rd,1580749378.0,"None of what you listed is proof that China is underreporting.

That's why it's fake news. 

Like I said, being skeptical and spreading misinformation are very different things."
