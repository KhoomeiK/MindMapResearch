funny,ff87rbo,t1_ff7tb5d,1579668426.0,"Without sharing my opinions on the matter and trying to keep any personal bias away, let me say this:

As we all (should) know, interpreting laws is the duty of the judicial branch of government, and it accomplishes this via several different levels of courts. At the top of the hierarchy is the Supreme Court: if a case gets that far, the ruling of SCOTUS is the official interpretation of the law in question.

With that out of the way:, in the case of *[District of Columbia v. Heller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller)* in 2008, which concerned a 1976 law which effectively outlawed civilian ownership of handguns in DC as well as requiring long guns to be unloaded and either disassembled or locked up in some fashion, the SCOTUS addressed that first part of the Second Amendment.

Paraphrasing here, but the gist of it was that that first portion of the 2A is not intended to limit the scope of the rest of it, but as an explanation/justification: essentially, primarily using the intent of the framers with respect to the circumstances present at the time (fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to increase its power over the states, so they took Congress's ability to disarm the people away) along with present circumstances, they decided that it was incredibly difficult to raise a militia in times of need when the population lacks weapons or the knowledge to use them.
