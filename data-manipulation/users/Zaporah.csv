Therapy and meds are great tools to help get you there, but it says a ton about you and your own internal drive and determination! You are obviously a brave, beautiful person and don't be afraid to share your story. It is part of what has shaped you into who you are today. Maybe without all that, as awful as it may have been at the time, you wouldn't have that great sense of determination you have today."
