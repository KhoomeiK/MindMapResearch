Feminism,fdpgai4,t1_fdp8xdw,1578627864.0,"Yes, we do know that men get sexually assaulted. The rate is not even close to competing with the number of women who get raped. It’s ignored, I suppose, but I’ve had veterans in my college classes write about theirs, and I didn’t laugh at them. One guy let his peers workshop his essay (I always tell students writing about trauma in my introductory writing courses that, if they feel uncomfortable sharing with strangers, I’ll look at the paper and discuss it with them instead); he wanted to share, and no one laughed at him. I’m sure some immature, asshole guys do laugh at their friends who get victimized, but those are shitty friends. Most people in positions of authority who aren’t beat cops understand that men have a particularly hard time reporting rape because they feel ashamed and emasculated and treat them with empathy. If this has not been your experience, I’m sorry you had to go through that. 

But mostly men rape other men AND women. There are outlier cases in which women rape men, but rapists are majority male. 

The primary cause of men’s sexual assaults is also patriarchy and its gender norms , and that’s what feminism seeks to dismantle. We don’t want people to laugh at men’s trauma. We want it all taken seriously. Women are also often laughed at and not believed when they report rape. It’s not a zero-sum game. Most of the time, feminist work also helps men because men can also be hurt by patriarchy."

But, mostly, I think you dislike women. How do you feel about strip-club owners? They make much more than the women. have all the power, and don’t do that much."
unpopularopinion,fdp98qt,t1_fdp5v5f,1578622975.0,"But you told me what’s in it for the man. In the strip club example, the man is more like the woman in the financial kink scenario. Like, she gives something (her fucking body) to the man, and the man gives her money in return (kind of the way the financial domination guy gets pleasure from being financially dominated by a woman). 

Many men, especially high earners who make a lot of decisions at work, like to have someone tell them what to do with their money. In contrast, many strippers get abused, have to do drugs just to get through a shift, get followed to their cars and raped  (or have security escort them, but that doesn’t say much for the men who go to the club—it still means they are likely rapists among them), and were abused as children. It’s fine if a woman feels empowered stripping, but I don’t know that it’s “good” for women. At least with financial domination, they don’t risk getting touched and fucked with by men. I figured your view of strip clubs would be naive and idealistic, which is why I challenged you on it. 

I just think you’re prioritizing the man’s pleasure. And I don’t think you understand how kinks work. If financial domination is someone’s kink, he likes it. No one held him at gunpoint and took his wallet. He gave the money of his own volition. In the strip club scenario, the women have less power (even the financial domination guys have more power; they can always move on to another woman or another kink, but the woman has to maintain the relationship, which often includes more than just “Give me money”) because they don’t have other options. The men who visit the club don’t have to do anything to get to watch the women except buy a drink. They don’t even have to tip. I think you are actually uncomfortable with women having power, not necessarily this particular kink that in no way affects you."
self,fdp7nxm,t3_emdcb6,1578621913.0,"I totally do this, too, and I know it’s because of the first two people I dated seriously: one was addicted to heroin and treated me like shit, but I was young (and younger than he was), so I was all, “Us against the world! He can get better!” (17 years later, he is still in and out of rehab, shooting his Suboxone, doing meth; it’s been so long since he contacted me that I wonder if he’s dead now—and this is really mean, but I hope he is!), and it was us against the world, but it was also him against me since he was emotionally abusive and a huge narcissist and gaslighter and just general user—like, it was always my money, or his drugs were my problem, etc. He’d say he’d cheated on me or found out he was HIV+ or possessed by a demon (he knew I got scared by The Exorcist!), and he’d say it and say it until I believed it, and then he’d say “I didn’t really cheat on you. I’m just fucking with you” or whatever applicable thing, and sometimes when I believed that, he’d tell me again that, actually he hadn’t made it up, and I’d get so confused and upset that I’d end up in tears and go to him for comfort. It was fucked up.  

The next guy I dated, who was also the first man with whom I had penetrative sex, seemed nicer—he taught in the women’s studies program! How was I supposed to know he was a dick to women?—and I kind of blame him more. He’d  say he was going to do things but never ever do them—like, anything from “I’ll call you back” or “I’ll be there at 9:00” to NOT CALLING ME FOR OVER A WEEK AFTER THE FIRST TIME I’D EVER HAD SEX! He knew it was my first time, and I bled all the way through his mattress—I totally ruined it—but he was nice about it and gentle and understanding when I cried, so I thought he really loved me and that things would change. And what kind of an idiot doesn’t know he should call after someone’s first time? He’s a lot older than I am—or, nine years, which was a huge age gap when I was 20 but wouldn’t feel too big now—so I understood that he didn’t value it the same way I did, but he should have known to do the bare minimum and fucking call. Once, we went home together, spent the whole next day fucking and watching TV, and decided to go to a party together that night. That surprised me because he hated going anywhere with anyone (he wanted to be in control of when he went home and stuff), so I kept saying, “But you won’t leave me in [neighborhood] without a car? You’re sure I shouldn’t drive my car? Are you sure? You promise you’re going to at least drive me home?” and he said “No, I’m not going to leave you there. No, you don’t need your car. Yes, I’m sure. I promise.” And then it’s 2am, and he decides he wants to go home with this fucking stranger and that I can get a ride (I made him take me home! The girl thought I was insane!). And he kept doing stuff like that until I said I didn’t want to hang out anymore and then, every time we lived in the same city or he was suicidal and needed to talk to someone, he’d call me (I literally saved his life), and I was ALWAYS there and supportive because I believed that, if I could just be perfect and always do what I’d want him to do, he’d get it and reciprocate. Finally, when I was all but suicidal over my undertreated chronic pain, he said he was “too fragile” to talk to me, my pain was all in my head (I have headaches—like, 24/7 debilitating headaches on normal days and at least one full-on migraine a month, usually more—so, technically, it is “in my head,” but that isn’t what he meant), I was just using the pain as an excuse to take opioids, etc. Nothing I did ever made him treat me like a person with feelings that are just as valid as his. When I’d do the crazy call/text too much, he’d tell me I was crazy and a bitch, that he loved me, that I was making all this up and being dramatic. Constant gaslighting. I just really wanted him to love me because he could be so nice, but he wouldn’t even admit we were dating. We were friends who had sex off and on for ten years, so this kind of emotional abuse went on for ten years. Maybe 12. He called last night for the first time in two years to tell me he‘d been a dick and felt bad about it, but it means nothing; I yelled at him for fucking up my only good relationship ever.

Which brings me to: my only healthy relationship ever. I was 33 and dating this guy who was steady and kind and really did love me, but I couldn’t accept it. He wasn’t affectionate at all, and I kept telling him I needed more affection, and he kept saying he was trying to give it to me (I couldn’t see it; his “love language” was doing nice things, and that didn’t register with me because no one had ever done nice things for me before). I was so happy, but I was also terrified of losing it and so fucking insecure in relationships that I fucked it up by asking for too much reassurance. Or, so he said. I still think that, since I’d told him about my history (and the guy I’d been dating before him died, so I was especially fragile), he should have been more understanding, but I can’t entirely blame him for it since he was always nice to me, always called when he said he would and did what he said he would, gave me presents, talked when I wanted to talk even if he didn’t want to. I just couldn’t get it through my head that this person actually cared about me, and I let it ruin the only good relationship I have ever been in. 

I don’t know if I’ve gotten over it. The last person I dated (the first since the last guy, who broke up with me when he got a job in a different city in 2017) was an alcoholic, and we were actually weirdly good together, but we were also together all the time, so he didn’t really give me any rope to hang myself. If his drinking hadn’t ruined it, it would have been perfect; we’d probably still be together. But I don’t know how I would have done for more than five months (I’ve never had one last more than five months). I was better, though, because I’d seen myself ruin it, so I tried to not let myself do it (and it was pretty easy to not do it since he was an alcoholic, and any argument or misunderstanding or abandoned feeling could be blamed on that). 

So, I’ve written all this basically to tell you not that it is possible to change (though I believe it is) but that you’re definitely not the only person who does it, I totally understand. Do you think it would help if you had a person you weren’t that invested in to whom you could send the texts you want to send to the person you’re obsessing over?"

unpopularopinion,fdj4v5e,t1_fdhpja2,1578458500.0,"I teach first-year college classes sometimes, and a lot of 19 year olds share your views, especially that it’s a parental problem. But a friend who’s taught long enough to have taught people born in the early/mid 80s (my age bracket), who grew up without the internet—definitely not an internet we would really even recognize now—and didn’t get real, sustained access to it until middle or high school or see a YouTube video or Facebook profile until college, says that students now just can’t do the kind of critical thinking and writing/articulation that we could do. She’s used versions of the same assignments, and students now say they literally can’t—not won’t or don’t know how but can’t—do some of them now, and we all think it’s phones. Having the internet in your pocket is in some ways great but in other ways conducive to shallow thinking and poor attention. 

Even I hate my fucking phone. I wish I were on it much less and hope I can change that over the next few months (maybe it was a bad idea to put reddit on my phone). If I could only get online on my computer, I would almost never do it. But I look at my phone when I smoke, and now I’m used to it, and I do it too much—not just when I smoke anymore. I’m sure it changed the way my brain works. There are also studies and books but more about the internet than phones, I think; research always lags a little since you have to gather data, analyze, write, revise, and publish it, and you’re always already behind the data. 

But because so many 18-24 year olds have made the parental argument to me in papers and class discussions, I think there’s definitely something to that. Probably a lot. Helicopter parenting, of course. Attachment parenting? Some change in family structure?

I do think your missing older millennials who can distinguish real from fake because we watched all of it roll out and that there are just as many people your age who wouldn’t know a good from bad source if one was goodfactsandanalysis com and one was badinfo org. But I believe that you can spot them. You should be able to. I’m always surprised when my students are barely internet literate. Like, “You guys grew up here!”

ETA: There is also a whole cultural shift going on or a zeitgeist that probably puts a lot of pressure on teens. You have social media, all these abuse scandals, people who are actually discovering themselves and people who want attention more than anything, a lot of economic changes, new awareness of social justice problems but not a lot of new or always-good decisions about how to deal with them.

unpopularopinion,fdizh7w,t1_fdinsh7,1578454629.0,"I guess I feel like it’s becoming something of a norm, especially among people in the arts or freelancers, who ought to do Patreon if they want/need to use crowdfunding as an income stream, and that the idea that I should just give you (general you, not you personally) money because you’re struggling suggests a level of entitlement that is just weird and exposes major problems with the economy that we’d rather not deal with on a structural level. I don’t even think the people are greedy. It’s usually people who don’t have or make much money, not people who want walk-around money from friends, but they’re also asking for money from people who mostly don’t have it either. Like, I’m struggling financially, and it would never have occurred to me to set up a crowdfunding page for my normal life. 

It’s one thing if you have some kind of emergency or an opportunity you can’t quite afford but don’t want to pass up. But now I see, like, “PLEASE put money in his Venmo so he can pay his rent/get his kids [whatever kid stuff]/make his student loan payment” or etc., usually followed by a description of how nice and deserving the person is (so...I should give you money because you’re nice?) and, more and more, it’s not just among friends. I’m not against people eating or paying their loans or buying their kids stuff, obviously; I just don’t think this is the way we should or have to do it. I get why people need to (I’m disabled; it’s hard for me to work, but I do as much as I can, and I don’t ask my friends or strangers to crowdfund my life), and I can’t even fully say I’m against it given the circumstances, but it sets an unsustainable precedent and shouldn’t be as prevalent as it is. It’s crazy that this is what we’ve come to, and we think it’s normal (from what I can tell). 

Now I’m seeing more and more “I work but can’t pay my bills” GoFundMes or “If you like my FB posts [seriously, your Facebook posts?], go buy me something off my Amazon wishlist” links, and I feel like it’s a problem in that, like, isn’t this kind of why we pay taxes? Why should I subsidize businesses that won’t pay the people they hire a living wage? It should not be up to your social network to help you afford everyday expenses. It’s indicative of major problems in society that the GoFundMe bandaid both hides and exposes. 

But, basically, I just think it’s weird to think that other people, most of whom also struggle, should give you money for nothing. If they want to do it, I don’t actually care, but I don’t think it’s a good sign for us as humans, and I kind of think that doing it allows things to continue as they are. I would rather donate to employees’ unionization efforts than give people $5 at a time. I guess I kind of wanted to see if other people think it’s as weird as I do. And I understand why it became a kind of norm: low wages, stagnant wages, entire segments of the economy disappearing or taking some new shape (especially in a gig economy)—all that. I just can’t imagine having the gall to ask my friends and internet acquaintances to pay for my ordinary spending. I don’t blame people, but it’s weird both that we do it and accept it as okay in a rich country. 

Does that make sense? I just saw one before I posted and kind of wanted to say, “Am I the only one who thinks this is out of hand?”"

It’s weird because I have a Master’s in women’s studies, majored in English, vote Dem because I have to even though most if not all of them are just right-of-Western-world-center neoliberals, support trans rights even though I don’t quite get it (the whole idea seems essentialist to me, but people can do what they want, and I won’t question their ideas about their identities up to the point at which it admittedly can get a bit absurd), identify as a feminist and anti racist and am intersectional—like, I “should” be a “That triggers me/is abuse/etc.” person, but I’m not for the most part, hate cancel culture, and (more to the point) really like Dave Chapelle and Ricky Gervais and Bill Maher and stuff (I draw the line at, like, “I’m just doing this to be offensive”-style, jock-y Anthony Jesselnick guys, though).

I think it’s because I have a sense of humor, had learned all the stuff people are just learning now (like, I remember when “intersectional feminism” was mostly academic jargon) and have a fucking sense of humor. And I’m a free speech absolutist. That’s what bugs me most about “canceling” and “He shouldn’t have a platform” or whatever. Like, Dave Chapelle earned a platform. You know what Bill Maher does. It was in his fucking show name (and he’s not even a jerk about it). You don’t have to listen to him, but people aren’t terrible if they can watch a comedian and laugh at things they don’t always agree with, and HBO or Netflix has every right to give them a platform, which they all earned anyway by building audiences on their own. 

The thing that bugs me most about the uber-woke is that they have no respect for the right to free speech. Do they not understand that the most oppressed people will lose the most should anything bad happen to the First Amendment or that the most marginalized most need speech protections? It drives me crazy. It’s hypocritical and antithetical to their own goals, and the only thing we gain from listening to actual bigots is that we know who is an actual bigot.

Songwriting is an art, not a math problem. The timelines don’t have to add up for me to believe they’re dating.

They’re rarely seen together, don’t talk about each other, and have only done one thing that seemed overly staged to me (hiking pics); he doesn’t appear to use her name to increase his profile the way he would in a Shawmilla-type PR relationship. 

I just don’t know how you could come to the conclusion that they’re using their relationship for PR based on their actions. It’s not like they’re loud about it. Most people don’t even know his name or that they’re dating. 

To decide it’s better to not believe Taylor and to scrutinize her relationships this way reinforces a lot of sexist ideas we’ve heard the media float about Taylor (she’s a liar, she dates for publicity, “Watch out, bro, if you date her for three years, she’ll write A LOT of songs about you”). Would you want your own fandom, to which you commit in a way that no other artist at your popularity level does, to have conversations that mirror the articles and slideshows she dislikes? To say “Now she’s too private,” “Now she’s throwing him in our faces,” “They look [sad/happy/perfect/#goals/fake, etc.]” creates in her own house—among her fans—the same type of stress the media creates or used to create (she doesn’t give them as much to work with these days) and that she’s said she doesn’t like. This is a version of “That ‘hello’ was passive aggressive. Why is she greeting us? She greeted us too early, She greeted us too late” and kind of goes against the wishes she expressed in her Vogue “dollhouse” metaphor (clearly aimed at Kaylors unless I’m missing a more vocal group of shippers that would be loud enough to bother her). I’m not crazy about fan fawning, but I get that people are happy she seems happy. I don’t care whom she’s with as long as she‘s happy, and she‘s been telling us that her current relationship makes her happy in lots of ways since 2017. It’s not my place, especially as a fan, to say it’s fake (and I don’t think it is), and it’s objectively untrue that she throws it in our faces all the time. 

But, really, my point is that we don’t need to take her songs and the dates they were written or on which she recorded them or every word as some kind of documentary-style gospel truth. The rep prologue also reads “...as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test.” The existence or non existence of a song doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Details might be metaphorical or conceived during one time in her life and used during another. For example, she’s said she’d had the choruses to NYD in her head for years; that she waited to use them doesn’t make them “about” whoever she was dating when she came up with them, if anyone, or mean that they apply to her current lover. 

She’s a storyteller. Sometimes storytellers need to condense or create composite characters or use symbolism or metaphor to get at an idea or image or feeling or to sell a narrative not because the narrative is fake but because blurring it makes for better art. Sometimes you write about the past in past tense and sometimes in present tense. Sometimes you write from a different POV or about a mix of experiences. Sometimes it’s not your experience or even a literally real one at all. For all we know, reputation’s love story is almost totally fictional. We don’t know. But I do think she is an earnest writer and that she writes about her real feelings even if she doesn’t always tackle a specific situation head on and even if sometimes the details are hazy or fudged or mismatched with what we know about her life. That’s in part what makes her a good songwriter: she takes her experience and makes it singular, relatable, and catchy. Just because she claims “King of My Heart” is about Joe doesn’t mean it is, and just because it isn’t doesn’t mean they aren’t really dating or that it’s all PR."

People hate teenage girls. I’m not totally sure why, but I think it has something to do with their liminal sexuality and the power it gives them over men. They’re sexual, but men aren’t allowed to fuck them, and if men can’t fuck something, they hate it. Teenage girls aren’t“corrupted” the way grown women are (like how incels talk about women as if they’re evil), which makes them even more attractive and more out of reach, and that gives them more power over men.

unpopularopinion,fcwdpng,t1_fcshvuk,1578023038.0,"It doesn’t have as much to do with getting a degree as, say, your coursework, but colleges are not supposed to be trade schools. They’re supposed to give students well-rounded liberal arts educations in the sciences and humanities. I don’t remember everything I learned in college because that isn’t the point of college. The point of college is to make graduates critical thinkers with knowledge of history and culture and an ongoing curiosity they take out into the world and use to solve problems. Diversity of thought is important, but you get more of it if you have a more diverse student population (on all counts—race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, etc.). Having people around you who aren’t like you increases your empathy and makes you more open to and aware of different viewpoints and experiences. 

You guys are also acting as if colleges go “Ooh, this white guy and this Latino guy are the same. Whom will we admit?” Probably, they’d let in both. “These students are basically equivalent, and we only have one spot” is more a factor in graduate school admissions and at the most elite schools, which most people are unlikely to get into anyway. 

I know it’s harder for US Asian students (colleges love foreign students because they pay more in tuition), and that’s shitty, but I don’t know how hard it is, and I don’t know how to fix it or if it’s an anti-affirmative-action talking point. Surely they still get in somewhere good. You don’t have to go to Harvard or any Ivy to succeed. In some ways, state schools are actually better (like, I went to a state school and never took a class taught by a grad student; that’s not true for my friends who went to Columbia or Brown or NYU). I’m not saying it’s totally fair. But it’s more fair than looking only at numbers. Standardized tests only prove how good you are at taking the test, not how smart you are. And diversity matters, especially as the population gets less white 

Affirmative action isn’t about individuals. It’s about a society founded on slave labor that let white people accrue wealth and power they accrued and passed on to the next generation during the hundreds of years during which black Americans weren’t allowed to own property or make money. It’s not about making up for one family or neighborhood’s poverty. It’s about making up for inequality that spans generations. 

All that said, I like Texas’ model: if you’re in the top 10% of your high school class, you’re guaranteed a spot at one of the state colleges. I don’t know how that would work for a Harvard or Yale, but it seems the most fair: you did well at your high school, so you get into a state college (and the UT system is good)."

I don’t have anything but anecdotal evidence to back this up, but the people who go to heroin tend to be people who weren’t going to be long-term pain patients anyway.
