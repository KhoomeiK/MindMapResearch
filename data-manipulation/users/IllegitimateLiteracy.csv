Look it up.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Capacity  . I'll give you a hint: A phone number is about the max length for everyone. Anything that exceeds that length has to be memorized through ""chunking"" ie remembering ""CBS"" as a single entity vs three letters. See lmnop for details.

No one is actually using the dozens of pieces of information on the current screen. No one. The problem is people are trying to make it like they are some galaxy brained genius able to take in dozens of pieces of information and make sense of them.

They can't. But people like to pretend they do. That is why UI has shifted to reducing elements over the last few years. Because they started doing eye tracking user testing and all that jazz and realized the people who said they used the information didn't. There are some great videos on YouTube about this you can watch. They started hiding things like  ""Weedlord von Boner"" in text on the screen and all the people who claimed they were taking it all in missed it because really what their brains were doing was filtering it down to 5-10 things they cared about."

badhistory,fclvzy3,t1_fckw6xl,1577757820.0,"I mean, the invasion of Poland was the direct cause of WW2 in Europe.

The Molotov-Ribbentrop's secret protocols planned for the invasion.

Claiming that the plan and treaty to execute an action didn't ""cause"" that action is splitting some mighty fine hairs."
badhistory,fclu131,t1_fclt3m0,1577756446.0,"That is *exactly* what the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was. It was an Alliance of conquest from two totalitarian empires bent on world domination. It specifically setup who could conquer where. 

That the Nazis stuck a knife in the Soviets back first doesn't erase the fact that they were allies.

Your argument that it didn't cause WW2 is bullshit.

Two countries planned to invade a third country and then did. Invading that country caused WW2. But for some reason that plan to invade the country wasn't a cause the war.

RIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT"
badhistory,fclqska,t1_fcliu4q,1577754209.0,"The Soviet Proposal wasn't for an Alliance to fight the Nazis, it was for them to expand their empire to eastern Europe. Which, by the way, they did with German assistance. 

It was a plan that everyone knew had no chance of working because it required Poland to be absorbed by the USSR and they completely refused to be re-subjugated by Russia.

The European parliament is completely correct. If Britain and France had been able to mobilize to defend Finland WW2 would have been the ""Allies"" vs a Nazi-Soviet alliance. Japan may have even been on the Allies and China on the Axis. 

WW2 is taught as ""The Allies"" vs ""The Axis"" like it was set in stone from 1939. It wasn't, the alliances didn't shake out until 1941 at the earliest."
badhistory,fclq92c,t1_fclkc9p,1577753835.0,"That ""alliance"" involved cedeing the entirety of Eastern Europe to the USSR. Stalin overplayed his hand. 

It also required stationing over a million soviet troops in Poland which completely refused. And which Stalin knew they would *never* accept.

The talking point you're repeating is pure Stalinist apologia."
badhistory,fclpyaq,t1_fcld7nl,1577753629.0,"> But 1., that's not true. It didn't cause the Second World War, any more than general mobilizations in European countries caused the First World War. And the idea that it was done because the USSR and Nazi Germany were dividing things up in a ""shared goal of world conquest""


That is exactly what the purpose of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was. It split up eastern Europe into German and Soviet areas and then both powers went about conquering the states in their areas. 

Your post is textbook bad history."

The main issue was that under Keynesian economics it is impossible to have high inflation and a recession.


And then there was high inflation and a recession.


People argue it was because they didn't follow the policy recommendations, but  it was theoretically impossible. And then it happened.


When a core aspect of your theory is that X and Y can't happen together and then they do it becomes clear that there is a bit of a problem."
