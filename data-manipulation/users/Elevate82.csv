I could see it being bad if we were extremely undervalued, but if we are giving dilution to get $100mil isn’t that kind of a non issue?"
weedstocks,fffa48u,t1_fff9uma,1579879421.0,Don’t we as investors get $100mil in return though...?
Elevators,fej2a15,t3_epaoix,1579154247.0,You guys have drug testing???? Da foook??? Haven’t come across anyone that had been tested in my local.
teslainvestorsclub,fefxmlg,t1_feeyo8f,1579068602.0,I worked for a airline in Canada that had a share purchase plan that matched 100% up to a max of 20% of your income. The good old days...
Elevators,fdefsgz,t3_ekwpod,1578338079.0,Should tell you what is required in your local code.
Elevators,fdcqf02,t1_fdc4fq8,1578281447.0,"Lol. How many safety features did buddy defeat to open that door and let her out, while exposing her to the fall hazard between your “toe guard” and the sill."
Elevators,fdbvr7y,t1_fdaqw90,1578262698.0,There is definitely no toe guard. Look around 2:30. That’s the thickness of the platform. A toe guard protects someone from falling into the hoistway in that scenario. A proper toe guard would be at least a couple feet long. Looks really unsafe to me.

todayilearned,fc7pzi6,t1_fc74zd8,1577515625.0,"Can confirm am elevator mechanic. However, it’s not reserved for high rise. All elevators I have installed have the sliding clips."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fc2buyl,t1_fc1dys4,1577350984.0,Not though because the tread heights vary. Top and bottom transition causes the difference and messes with people.
