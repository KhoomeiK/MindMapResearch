migraine,feepth2,t3_eopkvf,1579038672.0,"I warn all my new docs up front.  I get migraines.  Debilitating ones where I can't see enough to legally drive.  (AKA they might have some liability if I feel forced to come in)  In a bad month, I might have 18+ days of migraines.  I WILL miss appointments, but I WILL pay for my missed appointments if you cannot fill my slot.  I also ask for the last appointment of the day or the first appointment of the day to limit their schedule screwups.

I also ask them to put me on their last minute list for the 5 days before my scheduled appointments.  If they have a last minute cancellation and I can make it in and I feel well, I go and cancel the later appointment.

This practice has prevented me from being fired by doctors.  It has cost me money with a rare provider, but I've not been fired.  (Have had migraines for 35yrs)  Actually the doctors I see most often (therapist, neurologist, and GP) have given me their cell phone numbers so that I can send them a simple text saying NO and they know what it means.

99% of the time the doc doesn't charge me.

I run my own business that relies on scheduled appointments.  A cancelled appointment means I don't earn any money for that hour time slot.  I charge my clients a 50% cancellation fee if I cannot refill their time slot.

Recognizing how you can help them help you goes. LONG way.  I especially recommend getting on the noshow/last minute list before your scheduled appointments if you can.  This one has worked wonders for me!  

I hope you feel better soon.  I have a monster starting up right now actually.  I figure I have 45min before my aura blinds me enough that I can see a clear spot about the size of my pinky on my cell phone or a few inch across spot on the wall across the room."

Please note - this is loose data and not well studied.

12-18% that's it.  It's not 100%.

Part of what allows depression to get bad is never having been taught the tools and techniques to deal with it.  I've learned with therapy how to manage my depression.  If I'd had learned these tools when I was an adolescent, I doubt I'd have had a MDD bout as an adult.

Here is the difference: you can see the signs of depression early.  You know (or are learning things like CBT, DBT, etc) and can teach these skills.  I strongly believe your influence can reduce their risk to that of the general population by parenting.

I hope this helps."
