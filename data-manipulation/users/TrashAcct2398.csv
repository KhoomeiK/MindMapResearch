depression,ffdzbwi,t3_et3r2n,1579832688.0,Nah bro you gotta keep interacting or it’s gonna get worse. I’ve been struggling with social skills for years and it’s not a thing you wanna stop working on
depression,ffdxkk1,t3_et39qe,1579831424.0,"The reason I can’t remember the last time I was happy is because I spent my whole life like this. I grew up unhappy and I’m sure it’s one of the roots of my chronic depression and social problems as time passed. When you’re feeling like that fight back, although being productive is a good thing when you’re feeling okay, it’s even better doing it when you’re feeling depressed. Also I don’t think there’s any special way to motivate yourself during this, you just have to combat it and stick to a routine. Hell I haven’t even started yet."
depression,ffatory,t3_esm3yl,1579744248.0,Same :(
socialskills,ff5bv9f,t1_ff5bib1,1579586595.0,"Same, realistically I’d say I’m above average on a few games. I can’t help but think that if anyone had as much practice as I, they probably could have done better. If I have poor performance sometimes I’d refuse to team up with the same person out of shame. Tbh I think this is a hint towards a more personal problem irl like you said but yeah I get you as well. I usually try to compliment my teammates when they are doing well and sometimes I get it back which is nice and helps :) Also what games do you play?"
socialskills,ff5b65g,t3_erq9zu,1579585892.0,"Yup, every match I play. I guess they just want to feel better about themselves. I end up not even feeling bad because after all we’re in the same rank for a reason and the win rates are always about the same. Everyone has their good and bad runs. I just ignore it or poke fun if they are telling me off and they’re doing worse lol"
depression,fepsze4,t3_eqcowe,1579330226.0,"Yeah it has, I’ve noticed that it usually happens when I’m feeling anxious, very tired or both. When I get like this I also end up dwelling on mistakes I’ve made in the past, how I see myself and stuff like that. Although I don’t think it’s triggered by it because I’ve even tested dwelling purposely to see if it would happen again and it had almost no effect. I always feel somewhat low, discontent but there are a few things that usually lift my mood."
depression,fepqcne,t1_feppcb7,1579327758.0,"Pretty much this, but I’ve noticed that I get these way more often when I’m alone than with company"
depression,fepq6mp,t1_felk9ey,1579327607.0,If that was true I’d rather just not make an effort lol
SuicideWatch,fepptew,t1_fepppyh,1579327278.0,You okay?
depression,fepp3v1,t3_eqcju4,1579326641.0,"I haven’t really tried telling my parents but I know they can tell when it’s getting to me. They seem annoyed which is understandable because I can get stubborn and stuff. Although sometimes they tell me that the way I’m acting is not normal in a condescending manner. Also just today I got woken up since I slept past my alarm and the first thing my dad said was “get up, smile”."
socialskills,femhj9l,t3_epyhcs,1579255861.0,"It’s hard to believe it when I don’t love myself, I end up brushing it off."
depression_memes,femhdwl,t1_felkd4s,1579255635.0,Y’all ever feel okay for a few hours and you’re just like wtf I’m not depressed. Then feeling somewhat low and tired most of the time with periods of intense sadness and guilt.
depression_memes,fed3o3u,t3_eoj1xg,1578997209.0,Life is just one long continuous bruh moment
