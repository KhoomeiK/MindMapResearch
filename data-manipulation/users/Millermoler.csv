DebateAChristian,fcy20vw,t1_fcxpik4,1578073690.0,"I was mostly trying to explain why the question of “why christianity” is not really a good question imo. Like asking someone why they love pineapple.

A belief is not rational, that’s kind of the point. It’s not like choosing your insurance plan and taking the best possible one. You’re simply convinced of the fact that God is real, and he’s the only way. 

I guess the whole confusion comes from what I read in your last paragraph about “believing in Christianity”
Nobody believes in Christianity. We believe in God.
And no, there really is no way to explain it. I can try with different comparisons, but I can’t reason with you why I believe in God.
I have a little niece who’s 16 months old. I love that little monster so much. And sometimes I wonder why. She’s not done anything for me, she can’t do much at all anyways. And she’s not my own daughter. I really don’t have a coherent reason to love her. But somehow I do.
Again, this isn’t a perfect comparison that you can spread over the whole subject.
But I’m just trying to show that the question is just not the right question"
OpenChristian,fcxo3v8,t1_fckkih8,1578067532.0,"Nobody said God hates gays. What some here are trying to say is he hates homosexuality, which is a sin.

What would you say defines a moderate religious person?"
DebateAChristian,fcxnk6g,t1_fcxlaf8,1578067181.0,"Why? I’m not sure that’s the right question. Why do you like a particular type of food, why do you support a certain sportsteam? It’s not one of the things in lofe where you weigh your options and go for the best possible way. If you like pineapple you just do, it’s hard to explain. You also follow a sportsteam because you feel attached to it for some reason, not because it’s the best one. And if they loose, you won’t just switch to the next one.
I think becoming a christian is a similar process, you’re just overwhelmed with conviction that this is the right way. Not because you’ve tried them all, or because if you choose Christianity you win.
Similarly to how you choose a spouse. if you choose a spouse because of a reason like : He/She is goodlooking, or he/she is rich, that’s just not a good foundation. But truly feeling drawn to them, often unexplicably so, that is usually a good building block.

Luxembourg,fc7qc2x,t3_eglvgo,1577515941.0,"French is spoken quite a lot here. There no language that is more useful in Luxembourg than French, you can survive with English, and German, but French is basically a must. Unfortunately it’s even more important than our national language Luxembourgish. I’m not saying that because I have something against the French languge, but simply because a foreign language topping the main mothertongue of a country is not particularly great for the cultural future of that language.

French has influenced a lot of the Luxembourgish languge, it’s originally derived from German, and has a bunch of French words sprinkled in. If I’m not mistaken, the tendency towards more French words happened after the second world war, where we understandably weren’t too fond of our German neighbours, and tried to move away from that language. Fun fact, we also call white bread “French bread” sometimes, this aswell is from the post 2nd world war, where we decided that the German more dense and dark bread was nazibread, and we leaned towards the white more typical french bread.

Overall our food culture is a mix of French and German. We like to say “Germans like to eat a lot of food, the French like to eat good food, and we Luxembourgers like to eat a lot of good food”
For  Christmas for example we have both the bûche cake,  rolled up sponge with buttercream; a tradition borrowed from our French neighbours, and the Weihnachtsstollen; a more dense cake with candied fruit, a german tradition.

In terms of entertainment I would say it depends a lot on your family whether you watched more french or german tv, listened to more french or german music, etc.

I’m not sure if this helps, feel free to ask more details.
