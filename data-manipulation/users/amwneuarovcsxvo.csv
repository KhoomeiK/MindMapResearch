These push notifications are specifically designed for reengagement - you send them to inactive users and a percentage of them will open it and may be tempted to start using the app again. It's especially effective if you've just done a big update or have new pricing or discounts to offer. This will generally be tweaked based on the engagement data, this is part of my work.

If they *really* just wanted to leave you alone then they would just leave you alone. There's no reason to tell someone you're going to leave them alone unless you secretly hope they'll turn around and say ""oh sorry I'd lost track and forgotten but now you reminded me I'll be back""
