facepalm,fey4czd,t3_eqrzfs,1579440724.0,"Once at a party around 15 of us were all really high and drunk, we decided hide and seek would be funny since we're mature adults and we were all having trouble seeing straight.

After a while of hiding when we heard footsteps and running to another spot when it was quiet, we all ended up hiding in the bathroom for some reason, the longer we were there the funnier it got and we couldn't contain our childish giggles as it started to near half an hour of us hiding there.

It was obvious, whoever was looking for everyone was not very good at hide and seek.

Then the logic hit one of us, ""wait, who's looking for us?"", ""How many of us are in here?""

After a quick head count we quickly realised that we forgot to choose someone to look for us.

Don't mix drink and drugs with hide and seek guys."

It doesn't have to be a motorbike, you just need to have the freedom to pick a direction and go for the day. I used to use a skateboard to do this and it helped my mental state a lot, then after moving to a country with less than ideal surfaces for a skateboard I started cycling when possible, luckily here there are plenty of beaches so whichever direction I end up going, I arrive at a beach ready to relax for a while before getting back on the bike and going home."
