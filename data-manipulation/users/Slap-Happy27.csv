*MAJOR SPOILERS*

Leonard's innate ability to explain his condition to people ruins the film. He does it explicitly, and repeatedly, sometimes right after a memory relapse (such as when he tells the hotel manager). He's got the tattoos all over his body, including several directly referring to John G., the accident, and his impairment, but on numerous occasions he elaborates on these matters in detail without even glancing at them. I've seen the film twice, with a couple years in-between so as to give it another fair shot, and it's spoiled the entire film for me both times.

A lot of people argue that some or all of his memory impairment in self-imposed, but how about when Natalie tells him that Dodd beat the shit out of her? Leonard needing to be on a constant hunt for some John G. to enact his vengeance upon is one thing, but then the film asks you to believe that he's subconsciously trained himself to fully believe what he should immediately recognize as a bold-faced lie if it could even indirectly lead to him undoing any part of his own self-delusion.

Even if I could allow that, it's further unraveled by the common argument that his previous knowledge of the condition from the Sammy Jankis case would allow him to explain it to people after his own accident.

We're asked to believe, all at once, that he's...

A: Totally unable to remember anything after the accident (save for self-contained, inconsistently-timed moments of awareness), except for the precise specifics of his diagnosis, because of a cursory association he had with one person he knew before his accident who had a similar condition;

And B: Mandated to unquestioningly trust anyone who tells him anything that could break down his mental lock, even if he should know without a shadow of a doubt that they're lying to his face in an attempt to exploit his condition.

There's a common literary concept of an ""Unreliable narrator."" The idea is that, if we're being told a story in first-person, we're susceptible to being deluded or misinformed, regardless of whether it's deliberate or due to the narrator's own self-delusion or misinformation. This is the case in Memento, since we're constantly listening in on Leonard's real-time thoughts, even during some of the moments where he ""Wakes up.""

The problem is that Leonard's self-delusion is deep enough to be totally impervious to logic, except in regards to his ability to explain the finest details of his condition whenever it's necessary to advance the plot. He's such an unreliable narrator that he becomes the film's greatest internal contradiction in and of himself."
