halo,ffcu88f,t1_ffctnih,1579807362.0,"I was way too young to enjoy it properly but I do have memories of that time. By 3/Reach I was getting old enough to actually enjoy the games more. Funnily enough when I got MCC i played through Reaches campaign for the first time on a difficulty above easy, that story will ring true for all but 4 which I played on normal when it came out.

I get on to play a few games of multiplayer a day (waiting in a lobby now) and I really hope the community gets bigger as more come out but I am worried as these are old games. I think infinite is a good bet going forwards, and may reenergize people to go play the older ones, but again I just don’t know."

RX7,ff96dn0,t3_es7p35,1579705913.0,"I got my 86 when I was 14, so you can definitely make one work. As for the financial situation I would highly recommend not doing anything to put yourself in a bad position. If getting that RX7 would do that then skip on it and get a car that would better fit your position. They made over a million RX7s, so later when you get more money there will still be plenty around."
halo,ff6cded,t1_ff6bwxb,1579624118.0,"The element of choice I don’t remember lasting beyond the initial levels. I got to a point where I had bought all the armours I had unlocked, with the ones I really wanted still wanted behind leveling up more. I agree that the early levels provided more variety which was a good thing, but that would quickly go away.

You’re right that a heavily sped up reach unlock system would be better than MCCs, or keep the current system without the specific level to unlock stuff. That way you’d only need to earn a handful of season points to get what you want."
halo,ff6922i,t1_ff5lgp5,1579621991.0,That’s true but the only thing that means is that you’ll end up having less stuff even if it’s stuff you don’t want. The new system gives you everything at a faster rate than the old one gave you a singular thing. The only way the old one was better was that the first few levels had a little more variety.
halo,ff58b68,t3_erpj6w,1579583202.0,"Just play on easy, forget the skulls. When you play with her it should be about letting her have an enjoyable time, you have plenty of time to play legendary with skulls on your own time. You can let her do most of the work while playing a backup role and maybe doing some glitches if she’d find that fun."
halo,ff57xql,t3_erpi9v,1579582867.0,"The old system gated stuff behind levels too, it just made it so you had to choose what to spend the CR on. Overall it was a far worse grind with far more gating of items. 

I’m not the biggest fan of the current system, but it’s way better than the OG Reach one."

halo,ff219ng,t1_ff1p3oc,1579491100.0,"This is it. It’s not because Reach bad or any of the issues people like to throw around, and no Halo 3 won’t bring back a massive population. We all need to admit these are ten plus year old games that only people fairly into halo will get enjoyment out of playing for an extended period of time."

uboatgame,fetwmd2,t1_fetwdhw,1579380778.0,I honestly can’t tell you how the game calculates it or how you would figure that out. I know it does model it in some way because an in game tool tip told me about it.
halo,fetbiu4,t1_fesrk9a,1579373635.0,"Tbh we don’t really know how much it costs them to make the separate versions, as far as I know no lore has ever covered that. Seems like the chassis is the same though, only the gun and paint are different. The main issue I can see would be storing all the ammo for the fuel rods."
halo,feryl5j,t3_eqf7qb,1579359660.0,"Why did the covenant even make normal wraiths, just mass produce these bad boys and win the war."
halo,ferxbao,t1_feourhf,1579359316.0,"Preferred species should make the matchmaking try its hardest to get you into games where you can play as your species. So if you pick elite then the system will try its hardest to put you in modes like elite slayer. Keeps things balanced as everyone is the same in the specific game, and it allows people who want to play as an elite to do so without messing with people who want to be Spartans."
halo,ferwoo5,t1_fepsig1,1579359084.0,"Funnily enough I would probably play more if everything was unlocked already, or xp went up faster. The introduction of a grind seems to wear me out, making it harder to enjoy the game. I’m with the guy you responded too, I play a few matches then get tired because of the xp, if it just wasn’t there I would play more. If I wanted a grind I’d go play Runescape."
mildlyinteresting,fertaz7,t1_fep7ygb,1579358164.0,This is very accurate. I’m into classic cars and when I’ve gone to look at 90s ones most just have a steering wheel airbag. Wasn’t until about 2000 that cars started to get both a drivers and a passenger airbag. Very very few cars before 1990 had any airbags at all.

kingdomcome,feo76ux,t1_fenjxoh,1579296029.0,I think he went ‘hunting’ but didn’t really do anything. Remember how Henry told him to not shoot the boar but to stab it with a spear?
flying,fenfill,t1_felz4jy,1579283584.0,"The ACS just requires recovering at the first signs. Although you should go over with the DPE what he wants, for example on my checkride he asked for a full stall."
flying,fenf1x2,t1_fem12w5,1579283299.0,"I can chime in with how a 152 flies, I soloed in one back in the day and did my private in a 150 not long ago. 

If you don’t really pull the controls back it won’t stall but will mush towards the ground, you can get one to stall by just pulling back a bit more, really not too hard. My guess is OP either didn’t have it at idle or didn’t pull back hard enough. Had he recovered when he heard the stall horn he probably would’ve passed unless the DPE specifically asked for a full stall."
flying,fen3d8d,t1_feky26u,1579276069.0,"No reason to be disappointed about any of that. Sure you went up on a day that was probably not a good day to fly on, but you got it back down no problem. I can’t see any decisions you made that were bad though, turning back when the bolt came off was a really good idea."

halo,felve4t,t1_felpg0s,1579231888.0,Could’ve had a hilarious legendary cutscene with an elite hitting himself in the head with one of those cartridges.
halo,feltk77,t1_felta69,1579230588.0,"I’ll agree not everything needs to carry fighters. In the Halo universe I’m conflicted if the cruisers should have the capability, and I certainly don’t think the frigates should. Nevertheless the Infinity should be the Halo equivalent to a super carrier, the upscaled version fits that role better while the ‘normal’ size would more fit the escort carrier (which I do agree the Halo universe needs)."
halo,felryth,t1_felqd4u,1579229468.0,"That’s like saying we can make carriers smaller because 172s are smaller than F16s. I’ll agree the scaling being off isn’t 343s fault, and I don’t even think all ships need to carry longswords, but the reality is a lot of Halos ships need to grow."
halo,felaptz,t3_epro8i,1579217777.0,I think this is showing just how much the majority of the community hated DMR starts.
halo,felajsz,t3_epr9nq,1579217668.0,They just changed it so Social games have a much higher rate of AR start and moved DMR to be in the ranked playlists. I guess this shows how people really felt about the DMR.
halo,fela3dt,t3_epr66j,1579217377.0,"Love em, they all have the classic Halo look. Also I see you took 00’s 3.5x scale up into account."
halo,fek6rm7,t3_epkx11,1579193782.0,"I’m very happy with the new playlist changes. The only thing I can think of that I really want now is to get the custom emblems to display on the armor like they did back in the day.

I know it has the same name, and canonically is the same ship, but the visuals are so different. It really threw me off when I played 4, and sadly set the tone for the rest of the series."

Here is a real life example of an Infinity like ship. It was massive for its time and was a last ditch attempt to save japan, even though construction started before the war.

There should’ve been no infinity, no strong humanity, none of that after 3. 4 should’ve shown us a fractured galaxy with no strong players left.
