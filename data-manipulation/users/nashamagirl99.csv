It must change quite substantially for men (at least for men who can hear). Now I’m wondering about whether that happens at the same time as the physical voice or if there is a period of adjustment.

I was born in 99’ so this is all secondhand knowledge, but the main reasons were probably the strong economy and pre 9/11 peacefulness (there was the Gulf War but it ended early in the decade). A lot of good movies and music also came out in the 90’s. Of course the 90’s were far from perfect. Politics were just as messy as today, drugs and crime were rampant, and people wore some pretty ridiculous clothes."

Certainly using them every single time in a marriage except when trying to get pregnant was a nonstarter for many people at the time. If you are going to suggest abstinence, sex is a normal, healthy part of life that poor people should be just as free to partake in.
