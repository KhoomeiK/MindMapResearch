Lots of people don't shower everyday, especially if they're trying to conserve water or whatever. Try making things a little easier, like using body wipes and dry shampoo for those days it's too hard to shower. On the days you can't brush your teeth, just brush your tongue and you'll feel a bit more presentable. Sending you hugs!"

I can totally relate and it sucks. I felt like that for almost a year and thought I wouldn't ever re-enter the world of the living, but I did. One day I took a small step and the next day I took a bigger step and so on until I finally came out of the fog. It's still not easy, but there's hope.

depression,ff7cnip,t3_ersvbk,1579646462.0,I know it feels as if nothing is working out and I'm so sorry. How about student loans?

studyAbroad,ff6fsfj,t3_erv503,1579626251.0,"She is being totally unreasonable. Sounds like she was running late and then blamed you for being in a rush and not being able to finish getting ready. It's her responsibility to make sure she has enough time to brush her teeth. She can't live as if she is the only person in the apartment despite her attitude. 

Easier said than done, but try to ignore her. When she's telling you off, walk away, shake it off and go on about your day. It's tough when you have anxiety, but she needs to get the message without you feeling drained every time you have to deal with her irrational mindset.

When she can talk to you politely without telling you off, then you can make the time to communicate.

Good luck!"

Mindfulness,fehi5qm,t3_ep0jlm,1579117027.0,"I'm in a very similar situation and can sympathize with you. Sleep deprivation makes me feel like I'm going crazy and it seriously affects my health. I read in the comments where you may change your sleep schedule so good luck with that. Taking power naps throughout the day helped me regain some of my sanity. It doesn't always work, but sometimes taking a generic benadryl lets me fall back to sleep faster.

I'm also thinking about asking the upstairs neighbor if I can buy him extra carpeting for just the area above my bedroom so it will soften the sounds. We'll see how well \*that\* conversation goes over.

Keep pushing for another apartment even if it seems unlikely. You'll feel as if you're being proactive and you never know what will open up as some students will leave or move. Find someone in charge and sympathetic towards your studies who will allow you to modify/change your lease.

Wish I could be of more help. Remember that the situation is temporary."

You and your husband both. Communication is key here and neither of you have been proactive so now you’re complaining.

Just talk to them already."

I'm honestly shocked at the number of people who think you're TA. I work at a university and that most certainly was an unnecessarily snarky remark from the professor. I don't care how long they've studied. They have a sense of entitlement that is not attractive. You addressed the email in a formal way and that should have been sufficient.

Your response tho makes it ESH. If you were writing to request something, like adding a class, you're now SOL."

I gained about 60 lbs this year, but recently went back to the keto lifestyle and intermittent fasting. Feel so much better.

I think we have addictive personalities in general. Meditation helps me calm those triggers."
