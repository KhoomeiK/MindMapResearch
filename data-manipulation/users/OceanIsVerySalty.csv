He absolutely should not buy moissanite unless his girlfriend has specifically mentioned being interested in it instead of a diamond. There’s nothing wrong with it at all, but it’s not a traditional choice and should definitely be discussed beforehand.

Edit: to the people who have moissanite and are going to say “nobody has suspected it isn’t a diamond,” basic politeness dictates people don’t tell you your engagement ring doesn’t look like a diamond."

It gives you a good idea of what has been done to the property and when it was done, both with permits and without, which can be invaluable information to have. It’ll help for your inspector to know if there’s something they should pay special attention to as well.

For example, I found out my home had been partially burnt down (cosmetic damage only), and ended up being totally rewired less than 25 years ago.
