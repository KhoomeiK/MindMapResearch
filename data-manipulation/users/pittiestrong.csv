You will likely need another person, or even two people during this time to help setup the distractions...

dogs,fdiy2q1,t3_ellqd6,1578453669.0,"Many dogs who exhibit this behavior at such a young age simply learned it... there wasn't enough food, there never was enough treats, they were the smaller dog in the litter, so they have to fight to get what they want. It is just like a switch. When trainers say dogs will always be that way its because they are trying to train the wrong way (ie alpha rolling etc)  They don't understand the mechanism behind it.

So there comes a time in their life when the dog will realize that A.) there is no longer a reason to attack for food/bones/toys etc because they are always available or that B.) their current freak out reaction then causes adverse actions on your part -- ie crating, taking away of treats, less playtime because you are injured from a bite etc and they simply STOP.

Dogs are like people - the same way humans learn differently, all dogs dont learn the same way. Thats why some dogs seem super easy to train and get a million tricks like right off the bat, while others can't even learn to sit. They just aren't being taught in a way that they understand. Anyone who suggests ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" training - don't walk, RUN away! Just like people, if your kid forgets to do their homework should you punch them in the face? Sure, you get the desired outcome of they likely wont forget to do their homework ever again... but the reason isnt because you taught them, it is because they are afraid; and what are the negative effects down the road from this behavior instead of an appropriate one?

pitbulls,fct86wi,t3_eikesd,1577935445.0,"Obviously the advice given to seek professional help has already been said - especially being a new to you dog you need to slow your roll. I have personally taken in several fighters (trained to do it), human/dog biters (simply attacks) and plenty of shelter dogs with issues. You want to give your new dog a few WEEKS to settle in to your home and new routine.

I start off with a minimum of 10 days including crate training during this time. As mentioned they need to be aware of the other animals, but absolutely NO interaction during this time. This gives them time to learn the new routine, when food time is, when potty breaks and walks are, the noises in the house / coming and going of the mail man and other visitors etc. Speaking of visitors, NO interaction with guests - PERIOD. Feed them in the crate and completely separate from other animals. You can feed the other animals in the same room with the other dog crated, that way they can see there is plenty of food to go around and there is no need for food aggression.

Keep your own interaction with the dog to a minimum during this time as well. Although you have already mentioned face kisses and such, remember this dog is strange to you - im not saying hes going to rip your face off, but at the same time your head/neck are the absolutely most vulnerable places and you don't want them near you like that right now. No games like tug of war, no high value treats like bones or other things unless they are crated and away from everyone. Anything they put in their mouth, DO NOT try and take it away. ""Drop it"" command, and then back them off it before reaching in to grab it. (i.e. like playing ball, have them bring it back to you and drop it and take a step away before you pick it up to throw it again. Dont try and pull the ball from their mouth and then throw it)

I don't know how long you have had the dog already, but its not too late to reset the clock and start over with a new beginning. Work on voice commands during this time, simple stuff. Sit, Stay, Come, that sort of thing. Start building a relationship of trust, and seek out a trainer to start taking it to the next level. Have a yard? Build yourself a doggy gym with some ramps and balance beams, they will come in handy once you start working on his issues. He will have to trust you when doing this work  - and you then introduce the triggers (i.e. other dogs) - his focus will have to remain on the balance work and the obstacles, and will be rewarded for doing so and not breaking from it to pay attention to the triggers. I wish you all the best! Even dogs with troubled pasts can make wonderful companions, it just takes time and trust!"
