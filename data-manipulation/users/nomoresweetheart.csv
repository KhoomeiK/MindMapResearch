FantasyWorldbuilding,ffg6654,t3_etf2pb,1579899300.0,"I have episodes of compulsive writing, so I stick to paper a lot of the time.

Get some different coloured sticky notes, a folder (I like the ones with pockets), and some highlighters or felt tip pens. When you’re writing and want to go back and add things, try adding sticky notes - sticky dots help them stay on better if they’re not very good. When you revisit and find a page covered with sticky notes, rewrite it to include the notes. You can get ones that aren’t very wide that function as tabs if needed too, so that when you organise your folder into sections you can find the right one easily. Organising my folders intimate sections usually comes over time as I expand on each area, so it comes naturally as I progress.

Revisiting my notes and reworking them helps me a lot, and later I highlight key concepts or characters in relevant colours and then add in a page or so for whatever brainstorming used to further the concept or character. I usually use spider diagrams/mind maps for that, and then turn that into written notes later.

Square paper is good for maps, tracing paper is great for revising sections of the map until you redraw it, etc.

I usually pick a project book as there are some I can easily get in my country that are divided into three sections with moveable plastic sections that have a pocket in them, and then I use A4 paper for my folder. Usually I start in my smaller size project book and then transfer them to my folder in bursts."

I have the same age gap with my own brother, and I also checked in on him because he took longer to become independent with bathing and in some areas. I used to help him wash his back and soap up his hands when he needed it then leave him to it because he needed that help with coordination sometimes. We still taught him about privacy and what is and isn’t appropriate, it’s just that we were safe and he could rely on us when needed. However, I was bathing myself at 5. Every child is different."

confession,ff39byz,t3_erc2dd,1579536738.0,"I want to say to leave him alone, but it may be that he misses the rest of the family that he is probably not seeing so that he doesn’t risk encountering you. You weren’t a little kid, you knew what you were doing, and it sounds like you want to reach out for your own sake rather than his. Why would you think he’d show up at your birthdays? There’s no guarantee he’d want to hear from you, especially as he’s gone pretty far to get away from you. Think about how many family events he’s avoided just in case you’re there. There is no taking back what you did, and in his shoes I would never want to be around you again.

If you do reach out, it should be in writing, shouldn’t ask for forgivenesses and shouldn’t make excuses. You could acknowledge that you lied, that you know it was wrong, that you know you have caused him a lot of pain and to miss out on a lot of family things. You could tell him that if he chooses to come to family occasions you won’t force him to talk to you or put him in situations that might make him uncomfortable. But after that, leave him alone."
AskReddit,ff2sieg,t3_er59yq,1579522253.0,"It’s hard to pick just one, really.
Threats of sexual assault and murder are the norm. I’ve been team killed in some games because I don’t play along with 14 year olds (or anyone) hitting on me - I was nearly double their age.

I mostly play MMORPGs and survival games. I almost always play as a male character and don’t use voice chat often without lowering my voice or using a voice changer because that’s the best way for me to avoid creeps, which is a shame as female characters often look better. In MMOs there are always the lonely guys who assume any female bodied person, whether adult or child, must be up for grabs - those guys always go on suicidal rants, threatening rants, or turn full stalker when turned down. 

The worst time in recent years was when I could still hear mics if people activated them and one guy shot a gun in his room so that I’d think he died. His character didn’t move at all for the next hours, but I saw him hitting on a 13 year old girl a week later.

Not all the creeps are obvious either, it’s very disturbing how common it is for guys to think they’re entitled to information about me offline just because they’re not hitting on me. They can identify my country from my accent and ask me where specifically I live, and what my name is - on the surface it seems fine, but younger me was stalked by guys who asked those questions in an equally innocent seeming manner so I certainly don’t give out that information within the first months (if ever). They usually push at it and then blow up like a jilted lover when all we’ve done is party up with others a few times to fight bosses or raid. They’re not entitled to my real name or location no matter how nice they think they’re being. Not hitting on me/not creeping me out isn’t a high standard of decency - it’s the most basic."

I think that if you feel up to it, you all should talk about what will happen if one of you struggles to conceive while one is pregnant, or if there is a miscarriage.

From your posts it sounded to me like she had little to no support over her miscarriages, and that you accidentally got pregnant and were probably all baby baby baby while she was trying to process her grief. It would have been a difficult situation because on one hand you and your bf would have been happy about your baby, but she would have needed support for her miscarriage too. Every stepping stone in your pregnancy - every symptom, would have reminded her of her loss, though that isn’t your fault. You’re nearing the end of your pregnancy - that is a long time for her to be suffering, and that kind of wound is like poison - it’s probably too late to save the relationships between you two and her. You have every right to be happy about your pregnancy, but it doesn’t sound like you two have really considered her feelings during your pregnancy until too late - you only recently started posting about her needing help, she has needed it almost from the beginning.

The ultimatum is insane, it clearly comes from a lot of pain that has been going on the pretty much the entirety of your pregnancy. You guys are incompatible. It is most likely that her marriage won’t survive - it sounds like it’d be better for you all if you both left her."

Besides, it’s just setting you up for pain if you participate in them.

Tell her and then keep away from them and find someone good for you - someone without a partner.
