They were like, be a druid, that's like playing each of our classes but all at once so I can fill in where needed. Druid was also one of the few classes I didn't 60 in vanilla so I figured I'd do it. Little did I know I was signing up to the weirdest class in the game, I do nothing great, but I do everything fine. Bringing the utility and filling in where needed keeps my class fresh, tanking is different than DPSing, is different than healing, tho I'm feral so I do significantly less of the latter. My only gripe is I feel like an awesome assist in PvP, I tank Drekk most times but man, those PvP centric classes/specs just eat me alive, I spend most of my non tanking time rooting people and tossing 6 or 7 heals before I go oom."

This is a game that you can legit have a scout sneak up to an enemy base, detect an enemy behind a wall (makes an ear icon) and then dump your prone soldiers heavy MG into said wall killing the guy in the other side.
