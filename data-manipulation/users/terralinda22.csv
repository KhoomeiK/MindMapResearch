aspergers,ffnbyg1,t3_eu9idr,1580064159.0,"So, when I was in my early 20s, I was pretty angry. I believed that people were evil by nature. In my immediate world, this was true.  One day, I decided that whenever someone would say something nice, I would accept it and own it, such as “thank you” and not question their intentions. I transformed from a bitter person to a more positive one.  I viewed people who were mean to me as missing out on knowing wonderful me.  

So, I know everyone has a different growth pattern, but I truly believe that you’re not a bitch. This will pass over time. You’re reaching out to a supportive community. Maybe you could spend time figuring out what triggers your anger, but it’s not absolutely necessary. Or you could make small changes and transform yourself into the rare gem that you are.  What is it like to be a great version of yourself?"
aspergers,ffmxuvp,t3_eu6tws,1580060034.0,Licking photos. Is that pica? I did that as a kid.
aspergers,ffmx96z,t3_eu59l3,1580059821.0,"Sounds like you’re stuck. There is no need to compare yourself to anyone, especially NTs.  For example, I always knew I was a few years behind, yes that is delayed, but I accepted it. Create some space so that you can hear yourself think about what you want to do next.  You haven’t given yourself a chance yet. 

Try different hobbies or interests. Maybe play basketball or ping pong with someone. Or if not, then go running. Run until you feel good. Keep changing your approach until it feels right to you. Time moves us forward. Stay in the present."
aspergirls,ffmrb6k,t3_eu70bq,1580058099.0,"There’s not just one solution, but for a start stop judging yourself. Whenever you do, think about it, then correct yourself. Say to yourself, I can do this. Let me try again.  I am not (whatever you said).  Say out loud that you are capable. 

Also, pick up a hobby that you love. I used to run because it made me feel powerful. Also, it’s a small daily or weekly goal that I could say that I accomplished. Try running for a week. If it’s not running, then try something different."

aspergers,ffjq6bp,t3_etoyg9,1580004145.0,"Yes, the “r” word is how people would describe me. Also, dumb, mute, stupid, and weird. Funny thing is that I didn’t know what all of it meant back then. My parents didn’t want me around so what’s one more insult. Sad, but true. Thankfully, I had grandparents who loved me.  Love is everything."
aspergers,ffj1ll1,t3_etryqh,1579988097.0,"I think it’s a good time to recover from this break up. Maybe also think about what kind of relationship you would like with yourself. If you’re in a good state of mind, then in the future you will attract like-minded people."
aspergers,ffigblo,t3_etpo9n,1579973193.0,"I notice both logical and abstract patterns. I did consider detective work, but settled with IT."
aspergers,ffhjw7p,t3_etjkvt,1579938630.0,"Yes, this was me when I was in university. I majored in literature to overcompensate my poor comprehension and communication. Work diligently on the essays. Focus first on the introductory paragraph. This is the essay’s entire outline. Edit each line until it is crystal clear to you. Then flesh out the rest of the paper. It was not unusual for me to spend roughly 80 hours total for each essay, but I couldn’t always because the workload made it impossible. 

Reading and writing helps with communication, as in it helps you get outside of your mind, and then talking aloud. Having trouble with starting your essay? Then start small with something easy such as transcribing lyrics in a song or what’s being said on the radio or television.  This is like warming up. Then go back to the essay. You may want to read aloud also so that you do not become mute. Singing a song to yourself works, too. Also, you might want to go for a jog to relieve some of the anxiety or meditate for 5-10 minutes a day. Soft ambient music used to help me stay focused while writing. Ok, that’s all the advice that I got!"
aspergers,ffebb07,t3_et4wj9,1579841987.0,"Change your language to the positive. “I’m not sure of what to do” becomes, “I’m going to try something different this time.” Keep improving an aspect about yourself until you don’t experience too much anxiety, such as focus, patience, calm, discernment, visionary, etc.  Google “qualities” to select the quality that speaks to you. Try to work on one quality a year.  Write about it or talk to someone about it. 

Lastly, always create choices for yourself. Look for a way out so that you’re never stuck. So, for example, I was in a situation that I didn’t want to be in. I could have stayed or left. I decided to leave.  Think of yourself as a sculptor. You are also the slab of marble yet to be chiseled. Everything you do to improve yourself shapes your Self, your statue.  You are a work of art made of care and love created by you."
aspergers,ffe4y2e,t3_eszltl,1579836813.0,"I watched jack Stauber’s video, “Love Will.”  Interesting music, not that I like it, but it’s really different. Sounds like you put in a lot of effort for this speech.  Sure, it could have been smoother, but that’s just how it is, especially with public speaking."
aspergers,ffe0cb6,t3_et3nkb,1579833421.0,"The answer should always be positive.  Say something like this: “It’s great. I’m almost done with my shift and can’t wait to get some fresh air outside, but not for too long because it’s so cold out there. By the way, how is the weather where you are? “ Wait for them to respond."

aspergers,ffdx47h,t3_esl2pf,1579831101.0,"I had to learn differently in uni. I hand wrote papers, then typed to edit until final draft. I read aloud when I couldn’t focus.

aspergers,ffdvvri,t3_esvcj4,1579830223.0,"How about you call some place else before the bank? So, you could call a store for example. Ask them what are their hours? Say Thank you very much, then hang up. Then call another establishment, etc. until you feel comfortable with calling the bank. Practice is very important."
aspergers,ffduiky,t3_et2fgf,1579829255.0,You’re funny. You should ask him out for coffee or tea or cake or something.  Find out more about him. That sounds friendly enough and it’s unassuming.  You sound so in love. <3 Good luck!
aspergers,ffdtdmi,t3_et1tzx,1579828448.0,"Yes, I used to read these novels where all the heroines were just impossibly perfect. I wished I could be them. On a lighter note, I also gave up being competitive with others so that cut off some of the source of my anxiety. However, once I focused on what I truly wanted in life, I then forgot about this fear of failure and just rolled up my sleeves and started over again."
aspergers,ffdsbnj,t3_et271o,1579827694.0,"I try to avoid the anxiety that I get that comes with things I did in the past, so I look back at it only lightly and just for reference.  Creating a distance from the past helps me deal with the agony of what transpired. Then I try to improve by being more careful about what I say. For the most part, people move on fairly quickly from social interactions, so if you see the person again just begin again. I don’t have context about what you said, but you might what to apologize, if you absolutely feel that it is necessary. Once you do apologize, take a pause, then move onto another topic. Now, if it’s a girl you admire, say something to make her laugh ;)"
aspergers,ffb8cn3,t3_esmeph,1579754831.0,"Oh hey, that’s me, too, but in the past. You’re being your authentic self, but not a lot of people can understand that. So, the truth is, there is no right time for discussing life traumas, unless it’s your therapist or special people who genuinely care, but that’s it.  So, natural casual conversations are usually light-hearted and pleasant. One person might say something, then ask about you, then you say something, then you ask about them, etc.... That’s how it should be.  Balanced and easy; it just takes practice."

aspergers,ff3w2cx,t1_ff3qwus,1579550106.0,"I was 16 years old and I lived with my narcissistic mother and her abusive boyfriend. They had an argument one night, books and things were flying across the room. A book hit me, then in a blur I started punching the boyfriend until my knuckles were bloody.  I wanted to protect my mother, but I was too young to fully understand the bigger picture that I was verbally abused. She was also my enemy, but I didn’t realize it until much later.  Anyway, he came back at me with a big knife but I locked my bedroom door just in time. My mother and I moved out the next day. 

I grew up with so much yelling and verbal abuse that I knew I needed to unravel all of it; it took decades and I’m still working on it. I’m finally in a better place in life and it took so much self awareness and constant tweaking. Life is not always easy, but just don’t lose hope."

I mask better these days because of so much practice at work. Whenever I get invited to a party, I used to go for maybe one hour to three hours at the most. The longer I stay, the more silent I am, eventually I get upset and then maybe I get angry, then I vow to never see these people again, which is what happened.  I have a few friends now, but it’s on an individual basis and I see them every few months."
