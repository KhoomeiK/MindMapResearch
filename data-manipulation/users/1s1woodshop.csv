It's a forum full of papa bears with our own shit going on, so while we may be a bit rough or straight to the point, a number of us do try to help. Feel free to reach out to me in a chat anytime if you want to talk. I am always interested in doing my best to help. 

It sounds like you guys have a better idea about things than you might realize.  You need a change. Or a few changes. And you need to follow through with them. There will be sacrifices to make the changes. But just remember the sacrifices you are making now with your health, relationships, and happiness. 

Lastly, do your best to listen to your kids in a way that really lets them express themselves. I'm a man of values myself. I'm a 250 lb bearded bloke, combat veteran, woodworker, and a scientist. And I have a lot of views and opinions. But those are mine. Of course I'm going to guide my children and share them with them, but at the end of the day I need to allow them to develop a sense of their own and to develop who they are. And I need to listen to their perspectives as if I might be wrong. So if my son turns out to be a Broadway dancer and a vegetarian who doesn't own a wrench, so be it. He'll still be a man that does right by people and his family and at least knows how to change a tire, even if he never does. And I'll be the proud old bearded fat guy in the front row on opening night."
daddit,ffkeute,t1_ffkccc5,1580021606.0,"Let me ask you, what does your daughter love to do? The 10 year old. What are her interests? And I mean interests that she discovered on her own. Interests that you haven't introduced."
daddit,ffkeme1,t1_ffkbgy5,1580021501.0,"These are much needed details, thank you. This is a different perspective.

It sounds like there are two distinct, but overlapping issues here. First, the conflict with your daughters behavior. Second, your inner personal conflict with life satisfaction.  Both completely understandable and valid.  I can identify with both of them, as many of us here probably can. I hear you on both of them. You aren't alone. 

That said, the amount of information exchange necessary to work both these out isn't possible on an online forum, so I'll ask some questions and provide some brief insight that I have found useful and I hope you do too.

When was the last time you questioned your values, views, and lifestyle in a way that truly considered what was best for your family? Are they still in alignment with your desires? Could you be causing self detriment and detriment to your family by not reassessing whether your lifestyle is conducive to a happy you and happy family? 

I ask because it sounds like the ubderpinnings of conflict could be the result of unmet desires and needs that have arisen as your family has changed and grown and as you have changed and grown. Your values, views, and lifestyle should change and grow with age and life experience. It's crucial that they do. I'm not saying you have to change everything about yourself in an instant or do a complete 180, but you should drift over time and navigate them with an understanding that the values, views, and lifestyle of a single man (or couple) are not a one size fits all for a family. You should always be checking to making sure all is in alignment. Your kids should have said or done things that make you question your own logic and beliefs by now. And some of them should have changed, even slightly, as a result. If they haven't, you aren't parenting, you're dictating. Right now, it sounds like there is a significant mismatch. And I suspect it's because of this. In short, if you need to loosen the belt on the boundaries you put in place for yourself and your family in order to be happy, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
daddit,ffkawjp,t1_ffk91e7,1580019793.0,"No one here is trying to tell you you shouldn't speak up man. I'm sorry if it feels that way. It's important to distinguish between not being heard and not getting the response you want.  We hear you. We are listening.  Hell, I even empathize with you. But we aren't going to blow smoke up your ass. You made a decision to create two human lives. Now you have to live a life that accommodates that. Want to be minimalist and live where there is no childcare? Go for it. But that means you live with the repercussions.  

I think a lot of us would be more open if your post and comments didnt come off as someone who wishes they didn't have kids or wishes they could have a different life while blaming the kids for it. This is a reddit for dads, and for a dad like myself who was almost killed in combat and almost didn't get to meet my kids, what you are describing is aggravating. 

We want to talk to you about your problems man, but you gotta take some responsibility up front and start being realistic about your own contribution to the problem."
daddit,ffk9eco,t1_ffk5f9y,1580019121.0,"I didn't say you're not doing enough. I said that's parenting. The idea of a parent of 2 children, one of a decade, looking at me and saying ""I don't get to do what I want to do"" as if thats news baffles me. I would first question how they made it that far in the first place. I'm sorry if I came off as insulting, but I was trying to be honest from what I saw in the little glimpse you gave. 

Listen man, when you have kids, that's it.  It's a grind. That doesn't mean you don't have a life (which I never said), it means they are top priority in every way. You can have a life when they are sorted. Right now, at least one of them isn't sorted in a major way and that comes first. Saying your kids have it better than you did isn't a pat on the back or gold star moment, that's how it's supposed to go. That's the bare minimum. I had functioning alcoholics with racist tendencies and serious control issues for parents. Is it good enough that I don't do those things to my kids? Fuck no it's not. Because that would have me giving them barely baseline decency. They deserve more than that. So I don't look at it as ""they have more than I had"", but rather ""they should never be able to guess what I had"". 

When you say things like 'fit into society and the family', that's what gives me an even further glimpse into what pandora's box might have waiting when it comes to your attitude toward your children and family as a whole. Your kids don't fit into a family. They ARE your family. And you theirs. They are literally completely ignorant to the world and it's your job to guide them, form them, and prepare them. They literally know no better or worse than what you teach them. They shouldn't have to 'fit in' with their family. Their family is defined by their presence, and it's not a family without them. The idea of marginalizing a 10 year old is terrifying and good God I hope that isn't happening. Sans some major mental health or personality disorder, they are acting that way for a reason. Figuring out that reason and helping them through it takes priority. Not to mention, you seem to value being on the margins of society (anit-consumerism, minimalist, open marriage, dont care what people think, etc.), so what are you teaching them about fitting into society with your own behavior? To be clear, I'm not saying your values or lifestyle are wrong in any way, you do you. But be aware that you may be sending seriously mixed messaging to a child in their formative years through cognitive dissonance about your positions on society. 

I'm going to be straight with you man, given your post and comment history and this post it seems like you are going through a time of some serious self exploration. Normally I'd be on the sidelines cheering you on, because I'm all for people figuring themselves out and being happy. But what you have written here makes me feel like there's a serious disconnect in expectation when it comes to how a 10 year old is supposed to act as well as how a parent needs to act. Your children did not ask to be here. They did not ask to be your children. YOU made that decision for them. YOU were what you gave them.  So be what you would want to be given if you were 10.

Again, I recommend seeking professional help. I wish you and yours the best. I sincerely hope you get all worked out and find the joy and happiness you and your family deserve."
daddit,ffk49n4,t3_eu24xm,1580015369.0,"I hate to say it, but the irony in this post is next level. I sympathize with you man. I really do. But if you can't see the source of the selfishness in your 10 year old, you might be looking in the wrong place. You just wrote a post about how your 10 year old is selfish and needs to have things their way, while complaining about your sacrifices and not getting to have things your way. The differences: they are 10, you, are an adult. You chose to bring them into the world, they didn't choose to be here. You should know by now that what you want and what you get are often two very different things. 

10 year olds are supposed to be needy and a pain in the ass. And they learn a LOT from their parents in the years leading up to becoming 10. In short, I would consider asking yourself if you are displaying model behavior yourself. You are a parent. In charge of another life. And while you say you knew what you were getting yourself into, it's clear you didnt. When you become a parent, your life is OVER for the foreseeable future. You are responsible for raising another human being. It's literally the hardest thing a person can do. 

Being a parent is a thankless job and it absolutely sucks if no one told you that beforehand. But you're in the thick of it. Questioning regretting having your kids goes beyond anger and frustration and signals a very serious disconnect from the bonding between child and parent. I would seek professional help ASAP."
