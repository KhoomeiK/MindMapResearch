cosplay,fftfvfr,t3_euvzmt,1580219367.0,This is awesome dude. I gotta ask how did you do the arms?
LegendsOfRuneterra,fftcj6n,t1_fft7wb2,1580216422.0,"I'm not basing my argument on length, nor on the fact that it's pop culture. Lore writing typically has much higher word count than novels.

I'm basing it on the fact that lore is most often written in the form of historical account and books(novels) are written as narrative.

I don't think it's a controversial statement to say that, for example, The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a much more compelling story than The Silmarillion. LOTR is certainly a more compelling narrative than articles on the middle Earth wiki.

The same can be said of any ""Lore"" writing."
LegendsOfRuneterra,fft6nzg,t1_fft53hy,1580209863.0,Look are you actually trying to understand my viewpoint and have a conversation or do you just want to poke holes and nitpick everything I say?
LegendsOfRuneterra,fft52yf,t1_fft0zxi,1580207551.0,"I think it's pretty fair to say video game lore writing is generally speaking going to be inferior to books.

This is apples to oranges though. Video game lore is meant to inspire game designers to create a fun game, while books are meant to read as a stand alone story in and of itself.

This is not in regard to video game narratives though. Some games story are superior to books, but lore is not the same thing as a narrative."
LegendsOfRuneterra,ffqphmy,t1_ffqpclc,1580140603.0,Bro think of how many books you could have read in that time. Highly recommend it
LegendsOfRuneterra,ffqp891,t1_ffq8o4u,1580140424.0,"Well they do plan on expanding the lore much further, but through other games."
DnDGreentext,ffmfy6o,t1_ffku1by,1580054148.0,"TBF, as DM you can choose to allow, or not allow anything you want at the table.

If you want to, don't RP seduction attempts, Just make them roll Char and if they succeed you fade to black and narrate the results."
wholesomememes,ffbm7v5,t3_esnzjq,1579772276.0,Hell yeah brother!
DnD,ff52w1f,t3_erorbf,1579578746.0,"1. Matt Colville's advice on this is to stay silent until they say the idea you want, then say, ""Well you could do that but..."" And this will get the players gears turning on how to solve the next part of that sentence. This works with most groups, some players want or need more direction though and sometimes it's nesessary to have an NPC say, ""Just do this""

Added on this this, when players get stuck in their own heads and end up in analysis paralysis, ""ORCS ATTACK!"" Having another immediate problem to solve will take their mind off the problem and they'll know what to do next.

2. Failed animal Handling checks makes the spider aggressive or scared. Spiders also don't kill their pray immediately, so you could have the spider attack a player by paralyzing him and dragging him off. A very easy consequence for the players to overcome.

3. That's totally up to your discretion. If you don't want your players to roll, you can say, ""Oh, you don't need to roll for that."" If you want your players to roll for something, call for a roll. Generally speaking though if a character has a chance of failing, and there is a consequence for failing, you should make the player roll."

notliketheothergirls,fem4dtb,t1_felqzgv,1579239364.0,"I think there is a relevant distinction between core gamers (The ""hardcore"" PC gamers who play games for 6-15 hours a day, usually competitive multiplayer games or MMOs) and casual gamers, but only for marketing and selling games. In terms of labeling yourself... Who cares?"
mattcolville,felmgfj,t1_felh0bm,1579225690.0,"That's not what the guy above you is saying. 

OP's title is not accurate. OP's title is (imo) inflammatory and flat out false."
DnDGreentext,felklxx,t1_fektxpz,1579224430.0,"I was under the impression was that Nihilism is the belief that there is no meaning, created or inherent, and optimistic nihilism is that because nothing really matters ""at the end of the day"" you can relax.

Which contradicts what you described. Created meaning is a concept of existentialism, not nihilism."
learndota2,feg38xu,t3_eoxy74,1579074970.0,Gyro has huge early and midgame damage and scales decently.

I think it's just a meme representing the people who relate to it growing as people.

People don't look at doomer memes and laugh at the guy. Most people who look at them think, ""that's me."""

Honestly the entire Idol industry in Japan is waayyyyyy ahead of the game when it comes to selling young beautiful women to sad lonely men. That shit is industrialized compared to the small time crop tending of western ""idols""

Great art though OP :)"

DnDGreentext,fe5iogz,t1_fe3tlfm,1578869947.0,"The Buddhist solution to suffering is to perform a strict daily regiment of meditation until you reach an enlightened state of mind.

What an enlightened state of mind means is that your brain is so highly trained to just focus on one thing (the meditation object, usually your breath) that you can then process everything that currently is happening within your mind and to your body from a removed, objective standpoint."
DnDGreentext,fe1tddc,t1_fe1hylx,1578830670.0,"Many philosophies and religions have explanations as to why suffering exists and what to do about it.

If you really are taking up the viewpoint (or something similar) of that dude's BBEG, I would suggest looking into western philosophy about ""The Human Condition."" 

*Man's Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl is a good place to start. You don't have to even read the book if you don't want to, just reading a summary of the main points of Logo-therapy would at least get you started. :)"
DnDGreentext,fe0m4u3,t1_fe0ievd,1578815902.0,Yup
learndota2,fdoy6oq,t3_emi64r,1578615576.0,"Definitely better to learn the game in All Pick, as that is the default pacing for the game.

Towers in Dota will first aggro what is closest unless the enemy hero auto attacks you (NOTE: Spells do not draw tower aggro). You can also de-aggro towers by spam attacking moving onto your own creeps.

Guides in the game are Ok. They are generally better than Valve's default guides. Itemization in Dota is pretty situational, so I wouldn't worry about ""correct"" item builds too much until you get more experience, just using whatever the top rated guide (Torte de Lini's guide in the case of BH) should be good enough.

As far as advice for bounty hunter he's a weird support/core hybrid hero. He's designed to be a roaming ganker who wants to constantly set up ganks and never farm. Sort of like what a Jungler does in league if they supported instead of farming jungle.

From what you described you're pretty much playing the hero correctly in the midgame.

For your last question about ranged heroes, blink dagger used to be meta on Bounty Hunter (not sure if it still is, but that would be one way to do it). BH also used to be a decent gem of truesight carrier (but be careful with this item because it drops when you die and enemies can steal it). You can also build Ethereal Blade and Dagon on BH to just try and burst down squishy ranged heroes before they can kill you.

Dota is a really complex game with tons of options and no single item build or hero is going to be good in every match. My advice on learning would actually be to play as many different heroes as possible until you get a feel for what all the items and abilities do."
