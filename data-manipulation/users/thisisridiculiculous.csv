aww,fgichq8,t1_fgi2pv3,1580816712.0,"I have zero idea why you're getting down voted, PuppieWayne.  That was one of the first thoughts I had, too.  No one knows how dogs come to choose their people.  And I could care less how I'm chosen, just grateful that I am (proud mom of countless rescue floofs over the years)."
