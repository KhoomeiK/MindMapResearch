bipolar,fcjd7cu,t1_fcjbuxi,1577683589.0,I’m a dog Trainer (which I LOVE) but it’s unfortunately through a company Im no longer a fan of. I’m working on doing it independently but it’s a process. I paint as a hobby if that helps. I have a lot of knowledge about animals and animal nutrition. No college experience though.
