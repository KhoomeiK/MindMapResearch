deadbydaylight,ffe86ai,t1_ffdzfqn,1579839325.0,I didn’t even think of it that way. Thanks for clearing that up for me
cats,ffdykhi,t1_fdprb2e,1579832139.0,"Unfortunately it cannot change my view completely. Cats that live outside for most of their lives can have a hard time adapting to domestication and that’s true. Though if the cats are used to coming inside more frequently during the winter, I would say that becoming “full time” inside cats is still in the realm of possibility"
deadbydaylight,ffdwirl,t3_et1e7r,1579830675.0,"Someone needs to explain to me what tunneling is and why it’s a big deal. To my knowledge, it’s consistently sticking to one survivor. If that’s the correct definition, why is that such a bad thing? If the killers being so oblivious to everyone else doesn’t that help the survivors focus on gens?"
cats,fdol0vp,t1_fdns0nf,1578607281.0,Gonna give it to you straight here. You wouldn’t let a dog outside wandering around wherever it is you live. You shouldn’t with cats. It is 100% being negligent to their wellbeing.
cats,fdokm8j,t1_fdn84ii,1578607045.0,Or keep domesticated animals in your home where they can be supervised and cared for adequately.
juul,excl18o,t3_cro7c5,1566153257.0,"Random idea that may or may not work

Try putting tape over the juul, lay out your idea in a fine point pen (a pen that has that nice ink to it) and then use the dremmel on it with the tape still on. Then you could go over the design with some kind of paint. 

If you do that it might last a bit longer since sharpie could rub off quickly"
