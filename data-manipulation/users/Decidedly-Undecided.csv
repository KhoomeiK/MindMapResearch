MurderedByWords,ffdm8ci,t1_ffcyzqw,1579823868.0,"I lived in a suburb of Flint (ya know, the place that knowingly poisoned the water supply). For a 2 bedroom apartment it was $900+. I got a 3 bedroom trailer for $820. After my divorce I went underwater so fast... my daughter and I had to move back home with my mom. It’s been two years now. My ex husband racked up a bunch of debt in my name that I just said, “fuck it” and took during the divorce because I wanted to be done with his abusive narcissistic ass.  So, my credit is shit and I don’t make enough money to get approved anywhere anyway. I guess I’ll just live with my mom for the rest of my life? 

Unless something changes... that’s exactly what I’ll have to do. I can’t even attempt to go back to school because I defaulted on my student loans. I couldn’t afford to pay and didn’t know you could apply for hardship. This is my life now."
AmItheAsshole,ffd6evm,t1_ffc1knj,1579814320.0,"I took a temp job at the front desk of a local school district. One of the admins *hated* me from day one. I have no idea why,  but I didn’t report to her so *shrug.* The big boss of the building was my upline. She was crazy, but I didn’t know it right away. Like one days she telling me how great I am and the next how worthless. But I had just gone through a divorce and needed the money. She would bring in hundreds of dollars worth of gifts for my daughter and wouldn’t take no for an answer. After two months she called me into her office and offered me a permanent position in accounts payable. I was already doing that job and my job and half her administrative assistant’s job, so I took it. 

She told me I needed to stay on the front desk while they tried to fill it, but I would get the pay raise immediately. It took six months to get a replacement. I trained her for like 15 hours a week for a month (she was a transfer from another department in another building and still had to do her job). At that point I had to start reporting to my new boss. Turns out... my new boss would be the admin that always hated me. After a month of working under her I was let go. On my termination paper work it says I was let go for “misappropriation of funds, lack of accuracy with data entry, and lack of customer service skills.” 

I was devastated. Shocked. Hurt. Like I don’t cry in front of people, but I broke down in front of the HR guy. He not only felt bad for me, but he personally knew some of the people I worked with directly and knew they all loved me. He told me straight up he wouldn’t fight unemployment and gave me his business card and told me he would give me glowing references. 

I worked my ass of for this place. I made it more efficient, I took over three major credit accounts on my own and they were always paid on time (they had always been late in the past), I answered emails after hours and on weekends. And they let me go like that. So I pulled myself together. Packed up my desk and left with my head up. 

The funny thing is, I pulled up the directory of employees after a friend that still worked there told me the place was insane (she was hired two months before I was fired and we bonded immediately and became really good friends) and I didn’t recognize half the names. Over 50 employees and I didn’t know half. That’s pretty telling, IMO. This friend told me the biggest account we had almost defaulted because no one else could figure out how to do it as efficiently as I did. I told her I’d tell her how if they tried to stick her with it, because I didn’t want that on her, but other than that I didn’t care."

AmItheAsshole,ffc57uc,t1_ffbh6e7,1579791808.0,"That’s so awful! My grandma will be 90 in about 3 weeks. She married my grandpa in 1955. He died in August of 2001. She hasn’t even thought about another man because she said my grandpa is her soulmate, why would she want anyone else. But I can tell you right now... if she met someone tomorrow and wanted to date, I’d be 100% there for her. She deserves to be happy. And I’ll always support her in that. I can’t understand anyone that wouldn’t wish their parents or grandparents happiness."
AmItheAsshole,ffc4ea0,t1_ffbgqer,1579791252.0,"My grandpa’s first wife died of breast cancer. They had two kids together. When my grandpa met my grandma, he knew he loved her pretty fast. They met in mid January 1955 and were married March 25th of 1955. They had two kids together. His late wife’s parents were always involved. They loved all four kids equally and completely. When my mom was about 6 she say a picture on their wall of their daughter and asked who it was. They panicked and got really upset thinking my mom wouldn’t love them anymore since they weren’t her “real” grandparents,” but my grandma and grandpa explained it to my mom and she was pretty much like, “oh. Ok!” And that was it. 

I never got a chance to meet them, but my mom loved them so much, I actually named my daughter after her. She might not have been my biological great-grandmother, but she will always be thought of as grandma to me. 

But in their case... they were loving and accepting of my grandpas life and respected his decisions. He married my grandma 18 months after their daughter died, and they never made a fuss about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffc3i2n,t1_ffbuav3,1579790629.0,"I’d like to gently disagree. Grief doesn’t make you run around and be an asshole to everyone, but it can cause a more emotional response to things since you’re already dealing with a lot. 

My uncle died a few years ago. He got a rare form of blood cancer that isn’t really cancer. I can’t think of the name right now. His wife turned into a raging psychopath. While he was in the hospital dying she made up all these rules about going to see him. I wasn’t allowed to go because I wasn’t “close enough family.” She told my grandma, my mom, and his other siblings that could only stay for 10 minutes a visit and they weren’t allowed to cry or get emotional. She then banned my grandma from seeing him because she teared up twice. She went on to say she wasn’t his real mom anyway. 

My grandma met my grandpa in 1955. They had known each other three months before they got married. Not even, they met in mid January and got married on March 25th. He already had two kids (my uncle was about 5) from his late wife. She had died of breast cancer. My grandma raised my uncle. She loves him like her own. He brought her flowers every year for Mother’s Day and her birthday. Those words destroyed my grandma who is the nicest, kindest, most loving person you’d ever meet. 

Now, his wife was just a bitch. Nothing justified that response. But my mom’s and grandma’s tempers ran a little hotter and their patience a little lower. Like, going to get cereal and there isn’t enough milk, normally my mom would shrug and maybe be a little annoyed... but during that time she’d be upset (not screaming upset, but more grumbling under breath and slightly aggressively putting the cereal back).  Things annoyed her more often than they ever would have before. 

Grief takes away so much of the energy you would usually use to self regulate your emotional state AND your brain is overloaded with emotions anyway. It CAN make people act out. And everyone response differently. For my mom... grumbling under her breath and aggressively do anything would be like screaming and crying and throwing a tantrum for most people. She is always so put together. She is the most well adjusted person I know."

boomershumor,ffbx3mu,t1_ffbh2f7,1579785603.0,"This comment gave me a little bit of hope back. Like so many people in this string of comments have been bashing the homeless like they deserve it. Like damn, most of us are one strike of bad luck away from being homeless too, but sure let’s act like we are so much better than they are. I just can’t figure out how people can be ok with having such a lack of compassion."
boomershumor,ffbwn7u,t1_ffbcxq0,1579785202.0,"That mindset makes me so sad... like you have no idea what they’ve been through or what they need and are going through one of the hardest times of their lives.. and then there are all these people with this mindset of I won’t give you money because you’re probably a terrible person that is begging for drugs or smoke. 

I saw a quote once about this kind of thing: If someone lies about what they need money for that says something about their character, but if I see someone in need and don’t help when I’m able, that says something about mine. 

I’ll give cash every single time. If some of them decide to take that money and buy drugs or alcohol, that was their choice. But I refuse to sit back and judge what they might do with it."

tifu,ff6r0vb,t1_ff571df,1579633074.0,"I also have a super fun puke story! 

When I was in 7th grade we went on a trip to Toronto to see A Lion King play. I live in Michigan, so it was kind of big deal to us. We got to ride a charter bus, cross the border, stay in a hotel, and see cool stuff. So, the second and final day we’re there we go to see the CN tower. But I’m feeling kind of awful, so I choose not to go up since I’m already a little afraid of heights. 

I spent that time sitting at a table with a teacher that also didn’t want to go up. I’m sweating, my head hurts, my stomach hurts... I’m just miserable. We leave there and go to Hard Rock Cafe. I still feel like shit. So one of my favorite teachers braids my hair for me thinking it might help me relax. It did help, but like.. it wasn’t a cure. 

I put my forehead on the table and it’s metal and cold and feels so good. She tells me I need to eat, that will make me feel better. I tell her no like four times. She orders me a burger and fries anyway. 

When the food gets there I reluctantly take a bite of a French fry. And guess what! I start to feel a little better. I start eating more and more. I’m fine! This is so much better. 

And then I projectile vomited all over the entire table. Like all in everyone’s food. It’s running off the table on to people’s lap... and the only thing I could think about was I *told* Ms White I didn’t want to eat! 

So that’s the story of why I can never enter any Hard Rock Cafe again. I never lived it down either. I’m 30 now and I recently had someone message me on Facebook to reconnect and they brought up the Hard Rock incident lol"
tifu,ff6pfgx,t1_ff5gtjn,1579632126.0,"It’s all personal preference. My mom almost never swears. She just doesn’t like to. Cursing makes me feel better, so I do it. I also hate the misconception that people curse because they don’t have a decent vocabulary. I’m a writer. My entire career is staked on my ability to know words and how to use them. My two favorite words are audacity and epitome. I just happen to like swearing like a sailor. 

As a tip: dictionary.com always has a word of the day, and thesaurus.com is awesome to help expand your vocab, just make sure you pay attention to denotation and connotation...  the best example I have of that is I was trying to write a scene where a main character was giving a bad guy an extremely emotional look of deep seated hatred. The word “smoldering” works perfect by definition! Except... the connotation of a smoldering look implies sexy time stuff... so I couldn’t use it lol"

I have a general direction and vague end game... but Vanessa, my MC, tells me stuff and I write it down. One of my characters was supposed to be a one scene and done character.

Then again, I’m one of a rare breed that does three beta runs. The first one at about 30% completion, the second around 60-70% completion, and the final one when it’s done. That lets me modify on the go. The first two beta runs are with four close friends that are excited to do it, and the last one is with 8-10 people. It goes back to the weak foundation thing. If the consensus is something sucks, I’d rather know before I start building on it. I also edit myself constantly. But that’s what works for me. I’m currently 78k words into a third novel, 125k is my target so a second beta run is about to happen!"
