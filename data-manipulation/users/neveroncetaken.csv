netflix,ffuyifk,t1_ffu7ca7,1580251780.0,The ending is great.
netflix,ffuyhj5,t1_ffuas5m,1580251766.0,There should be a spoiler tag on this reddit post.
earthbound,ffu2orm,t1_fftzj2c,1580233200.0,Thank you
horror,ffu2o8l,t1_fftzmt7,1580233191.0,That makes sense. For me it is the original Nightmare on Elm Street. I still remember the night watching it like it was yesterday. I was WAY too young to be watching it but my cousin thought it was a good idea. It made me ma movie buff.
horror,fftznav,t1_ffsq5z2,1580231232.0,That's awesome. I rented it at a video store but the clerk didn't care how old I was. He used to allow me to rent anything I wanted.
horror,fftzlgu,t1_fft0al8,1580231196.0,"I hate RT. Most of the reviews from this movie are dated and reviews that were published when it was release after a critic sees it once, comes home, and whips up a review in 30 minutes without really thinking about what they just watched. It is a problem with reviews in general. Reviews are just first impressions. You can't trust them."
horror,fftzi12,t1_fftl7kt,1580231132.0,#1 ? Wow. I love it but not more than The Fog or The Thing.
earthbound,fftzfzm,t3_ev0qux,1580231093.0,This is awesome. Is there a website where we can see more of your work?
johncarpenter,ffsgjky,t1_ffsgi72,1580181174.0,LOL - I just spoke about how bad it is on our podcast.
KobeBryant24,ffsg8wu,t3_euut9s,1580180962.0,Thanks for doing this.
horror,ffscazh,t1_ffsc8nl,1580178303.0,So jealous. I've never had a chance to watch it on the big screen.
horror,ffs9kfn,t1_ffs902v,1580176468.0,"When writing it, I actually meant to just say Sci-Fi. I updated it either way. Thanks!"
horror,ffs33au,t1_ffrzjua,1580171937.0," On a filmmaking level, Dark Star unfortunately, shows his inexperience but I think it is worth revisiting since it shows the potential of what he could and would become as a director."
horror,ffs1x8k,t1_ffrzjua,1580171130.0,"Well according to Carpenter, he set out to make a sci-fi horror film but I guess I could edit that sentence."
horror,ffrqoxk,t1_ffrqh9g,1580163691.0,"No, I think the best scene is the final scene. I also love the scene when Cane tears himself apart like ripping a page from a book."
horror,ffrmojl,t1_ffrluz8,1580161217.0,I think that is the second best scene in the movie.
CultCinema,ff7txyl,t1_ff5j3sf,1579658288.0,It is playing on Sci-Fi channel and it is on Netflix.
SquaredCircle,ff19y8t,t3_eqwlz9,1579476693.0,That hair  :)  That Stare
CultCinema,fezrpx1,t1_fewj49m,1579460796.0,"I really think this is a perfect movie to teach in film school. Clever, tight script, simple premise ... they can uses this to show aspiring filmmakers how to make a small creature feature with little effects and a small crew."
CultCinema,fezriiy,t1_few6wn4,1579460727.0,It stands the test of time too.
nostalgia,few2nh9,t1_fevwavx,1579404621.0,Netflix in Canada sucks. We have none. I at least own the DVDs
Tremors,feu2tm8,t1_feu1jha,1579382600.0,I'm glad it is still finding an audience after all this time. I love the chemistry between Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon.
SquaredCircle,fet4a6h,t1_feqdxoi,1579371704.0,I've actually seen this. Thanks for sharing either way.
SquaredCircle,fet1z6o,t1_ferwx11,1579371063.0,No. The article is about one of the greatest Royal Rumble matches. It is part of a series in the works.

SquaredCircle,feplhyg,t1_fephh5j,1579323639.0,"I'd have to think about my favourite Angle matches --- there were so many good ones, but it is for sure on my top 10."
CultCinema,fepl5i8,t3_eq1m5u,1579323377.0,I totally forgot about this film. I remember loving it when it came out.
SquaredCircle,feph2gf,t1_fepgxbw,1579320313.0,"I read a lot about the situation and listened to plenty of interviews from friends and family. Something caused him to do what he did. Was it mental health issues or drugs that messed up his brain or a combination of things? Who knows? I don't think he was born evil or anything like that, but it is a truly sad story. I feel bad for his family."
SquaredCircle,fepgo9e,t1_fepgma8,1579320025.0,You don't think he was a good wrestler?
SquaredCircle,fepgl7d,t1_fepgipd,1579319968.0,"I think it is the best match of 2003. If I remember correctly, the Wrestling Observer placed it number 2. I think they were robbed that year."
SquaredCircle,fepgcvo,t3_eqbhnk,1579319809.0,"I'm excited for the Royal Rumble this year, and in anticipation of the event, I figured I should share this!"

HannibalTV,fehcdbp,t1_fegmsgs,1579113656.0,"I personally hate the streaming wars. I don't like to binge watch TV shows in one day. I hate having to pay for so many different subscriptions. Hannibal is one of my five favourite shows ever, and I'm not sure that is enough to get me to subscribe to yet another streaming service."
scifi,feg27sc,t1_fef0ne0,1579073727.0,"I would say it is one of the top three episodes along with ""Balance of Terror"" and ""The City on the Edge of Forever"".

I'm not a big Star Trek fan but now I want to go back and watch that first season. I just remember a few episodes that really stood out when I watched it for the first time a few years ago."
cats,fefyd22,t3_eov3v8,1579069374.0,So CUTE!!!!
HannibalTV,fefyc96,t1_fefya66,1579069350.0,"But wait, if NBC is going to start their own streaming service, I'm assuming at some point, they will take back the rights, much like how Disney is slowly taking back all the Disney films that are on Netflix."
HannibalTV,fefya66,t1_fefn9ki,1579069289.0,"Wait, Hannibal is on Amazon? I did not know this."
MichaelJackson,feffx28,t3_eoprxp,1579055482.0,Nice!!!!
Koreanfilm,feff0ag,t3_eovtsk,1579054928.0, The Sordid Cinema Podcast makes its return with a discussion of Parasite.
misfits,fee89mt,t1_fee6llh,1579028442.0,Thanks
startrek,fee7zjr,t1_fed7uq6,1579028279.0,I respectfully disagree. I'm not really a Star Trek fan and this article has made me want to watch that entire first season. That to me is a sign of a good article --- one that inspires a reader to take some action. And I'm not alone. It's received a ton of positive feedback. I also like the personal angle he took.
scifi,fee7cg6,t1_fedg23c,1579027903.0,Wow. I don't know many 14 year olds who love Star Trek.
scifi,fee7ata,t1_fedi5ig,1579027876.0,Star Trek was groundbreaking despite the lack of resources and technical limitations but I still think many of the episodes stand the test of time. Age doesn't diminish the performances and writing.
scifi,fee750m,t1_feda4qy,1579027782.0,"As someone who's recently watched the first season, I am curious about what your favorite episode is?  I think my pick might be  ""Balance of Terror""."
scifi,fee70t3,t1_fed1lim,1579027712.0,I'm not a big Star Trek fan but this article really made me want to go back and watch the first season.
startrek,fechzcq,t3_eofxa5,1578974371.0,"Just sharing this article by Bill Mesce because I think it is fantastic. Hopefully, that is alright."
SquaredCircle,fe6n6kd,t3_ens3wr,1578896713.0,This was such a great PPV. Takeovers have always been great. I think that tag team match may go down as a contender for match of the year.
misfits,fe67ofc,t1_fe67juq,1578883624.0,I wish. I'd get it as a t-shirt.
residentevil,fe3744e,t1_fe0c4xb,1578846563.0,"""Devil May Cry famously started life as the original version of Resident Evil 4 before being reworked, and there are websites dedicated to Resident Evil 1.5, which was the original build of the second game that was scrapped when it was around 70% complete.""

Also, I believe the original game was inspired by the supernatural twist from Adrian Lyne’s horror film Jacob’s Ladder."
residentevil,fe317v0,t1_fe2lfzf,1578844933.0,Thanks for clarifying this.
residentevil,fe05cwf,t1_fe00zmp,1578803448.0,I'm glad. RE4 was refreshing for the time.
residentevil,fe05boj,t1_fe01pow,1578803426.0,"There is a great article over at Den of Geek about the original plan and why they decided to scrap that idea and do something completely different. I can't remember the link but I'm sure if you look hard enough, you can find it."
CultCinema,fdxg0tm,t3_en7tmg,1578768383.0,"Does this generation have movie like this? I know there are great genre films released every year. I know because I watch them, but they are all mature, dark, twisted, and not for a younger audience. 

Does this generation have movies like Teen Wolf, Gremlins, Terminator, Ghostbusters or even Evil Dead 2? I'm talking about original properties and not Marvel films."
MichaelJackson,fdx52vu,t3_en5frb,1578765445.0,Wow. I listen to a lot of music and I had no idea this was originally a Jackson 5 song. I always thought it was a Fugees original.
malcolminthemiddle,fdx4i6t,t3_en7y2n,1578765251.0,LOL. His conversation with Francis was one of the funniest moments in the entire series.
Gamecube,fdx2t0v,t3_en2bmt,1578764672.0,I wish they would port all these games to the switch. I really miss playing GameCube games. It is such an under-rated console.
malcolminthemiddle,fdu57qe,t1_fdqoban,1578727756.0,"Completely agree with everything you wrote. 
I'm wondering who your favourite characters are?
I would have to say:
1- Hal
2- Lois
3- Reese
4- Stevie
5- Malcolm
6- Grandma Ida"
malcolminthemiddle,fdp2e7g,t1_fdp25p9,1578618371.0,I can't stand laugh tracks. One of the reasons why it bothers me when I watch shows like Big Bang Theory.
malcolminthemiddle,fdp22bf,t1_fdovbny,1578618145.0,"I like all the episodes you mentioned but I've always felt Boys at the Ranch was slightly over-rated and appeared to high on other lists. I haven't watched Block Party in so long so I would need to watch that. 

Bowling is the episode however that won the series the two biggest awards."
malcolminthemiddle,fdolgs7,t1_fdobcef,1578607547.0,What is the other article that it is tied with?
malcolminthemiddle,fdolfst,t1_fdo7gfv,1578607530.0,Yeah. Disney own Fox now. I found the news on the MITM fan site. Check it out there.
malcolminthemiddle,fdo05um,t1_fdn48of,1578596395.0,It is easy to write when you are inspired and love whatever it is you are writing about.
malcolminthemiddle,fdo043n,t1_fdnjp2m,1578596366.0,"It is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time and one of the few shows I own the DVD set for. I was a huge fan of Bryan Cranston way before Breaking Bad because of this show and I've always thought that while many other shows like The Goldbergs have tried to replicate MITM, the cast just is never as good as the cast for MITM."
cats,fdmle73,t3_em2tbh,1578554321.0,So cute. And I love the name!
television,fdmbe07,t3_em1k83,1578544633.0,I love this series. I just binge-watched the first four seasons and most of the last three seasons just so I can write an article about it. I also just found out that it is going to be added to Disney Plus soon.
cats,fdmb5hn,t1_fdm6e1a,1578544445.0,I know right. I was thinking of just getting it as a Halloween costume but I think my cats would freak out if they saw me wearing it.
CultCinema,fdltxua,t1_fdiwr3c,1578532416.0,It was one of the first VHS horror films I bought. Found it in the discount bin and never heard of it but bought it because it was so cheap.
SquaredCircle,fdcvk8h,t1_fdcc2np,1578285550.0,So good. I had no idea that voodoo wrestling was an actual real thing. I thought that was stuff you'd just see in a Papa Shango act in the WWE.
SquaredCircle,fdcviqo,t1_fdcdlme,1578285514.0,"Yeah, the Death Match episode is a little much. It is the only episode of the bunch I wouldn't recommend to non-wrestling fans."
SquaredCircle,fdcvgsi,t1_fdce7df,1578285470.0,"I agree. It is way better than Dark Side of the Ring. 

DSoTR is so similar to so many other documentaries I've seen in the past whereas The Wrestlers was mostly all original."
SquaredCircle,fdcveaf,t1_fdcm77m,1578285411.0,I love the DDT Japan wrestling episode. The Stardom episode was great too. The only episode I wasn't crazy about was the MVP episode.
SquaredCircle,fdcv8fa,t1_fdcnmo4,1578285275.0,I found it by mistake on Crave. Some episodes are available on Youtube. You can also watch it on Viceland and other streaming services. I never even heard of it. I just found it by mistake.
SorayorimoTooiBasho,fdaamu6,t1_fd6dhly,1578243758.0,Do it!!!
cats,fcm8swy,t1_fclxvht,1577767305.0,They also have the best personalities. All so different. They are like the Breakfast Club.
