PleX,ff2mmiv,t1_ff0fd9t,1579513506.0,"To me it makes more sense than file size as the encoding can make the same content vary massively in file size.

I have ~3400 movies, ~16000 tv episodes, almost a thousand audio books, and ~20k mp3s (*I actually have them in cold storage temporarily because I needed a smidge more space as I wanted to convert my array from raid 5 to raid 6*). I've been a data hoarder for more than two decades now."
PleX,ff2m8tf,t1_ff27n0d,1579512912.0,">NVENC still looks disgusting, as does VCE or whatever AMD calls it these days. When you compare either x264 or x265 at the same file size as a HW AVC or HEVC encode, respectively.

I think that you're being a bit hyperbolic when you use the word ""disgusting"" but yes - for a comparable setting nvenc is noticeably lower in quality than the same setting otherwise.

However, what you are missing is that nvenc is much faster and on a scale such as mine that makes a difference. 

I found that quality wise I had to encode 1-3 stops higher (*although rarely 3*) to produce an equivalent quality video to standard - however the encode time per hour dropped from about 15 minutes to about 5.

So in my particular case - it was worth it to run nvenc at a higher quality setting and much faster encoding time.

I realize that it may not be the ideal choice for everyone but it is what worked best for me."
PleX,ff2m2wt,t1_ff1l8nd,1579512659.0,">Have you compared nvenc to handbrake x265 on quality?

Yes - I ran comparisons on quality levels 20-34 and h265 nvenc vs h265 (x265).

In my opinion the degradation level for quality became severe at around 27. As for difference between nvenc and standard, while I did notice about a 1-2 stop difference on the quality meter - the difference in time to complete encoding and file size made it worth it to me.

I was fortunate enough to get a free RTX 2080 founders edition from NVIDIA and with my current system that reduces the re-encode time per hour of video to about 5-6 minutes.

What I found was that an encode using nvenc 24 was close enough within my parameters to a standard 26 but shaved about 10 minutes per hour of encoding time.

Since I'm encoding over 13,000 hours of video, reducing the time per hour from 15 min to 5 mins on average is a massive advantage (*I do like to actually use my computer from time to time and you know, rebooting it once a quarter would be nice.*) Using nvenc means roughly the difference between 140 days of processor time and 47.

I want to be clear lest some pedantic ass lose their shit - I am not saying this is the best encoding settings - only that this is what worked for me given my particular situation.

If I am playing both videos side by side and looking for differences, I can see them - but when I'm watching a single video it looks great and I don't notice any quality loss.

Some people have larger and more splintery brooms up their asses and therefore may find my particular decisions unpalatable."

My standard is 1080p at Quality 24 using nvenc & it comes out to about 1.5gb an hour.

I tested out higher quality settings and while I could see a difference it was trivial to me as I don’t need to see each individual hair of stubble and with the size of my library (*~13,565 hours*) each gb in increased file size is 13.5 tb of additional disk space.

I’ve got a 60tb r6 array but I need about 20tb of that for work files so at 1.5gb an hour it takes up half the remaining space and leaves plenty of room for non-video media & other files.

For me it’s about finding a balance."

No, spilling an expensive bottle of bubbly because you're trying to show off instead of opening it correctly and with appropriate support to avoid exactly what happened.

I don't take my dog on transit with me because I dislike crowds and if I'm unhappy or agitated my dog gets anxious so it would be setting her up for an unpleasant experience.

That said, she will do anything in her power to avoid an accident, the only time she's had an accident since we got her was once when we moved and she managed to grab an entire bag of greenies, hide it then eat the entire bag in the night like a sneak.

I woke up the next morning and walked into the bathroom and it looked like I'd unknowingly offended a pack of drunken leprechauns as she'd clearly had several episodes of explosively green and foamy diarrhea during the night.

That said, she managed to contain it to the bathroom and she looked so mortified and ashamed I couldn't even bring myself to yell at her."

First 6 actually - but each bank has a public list of possibile prefixes.

That is even easier (*at least for most debit cards*).

Out of the 16 digits - the first 6 are assigned to the issuing bank - you can google to find a complete list of those used by a specific bank. 

The next 9 digits are the account number - so for a debit card that will usually be the checking account number (*conveniently located at the bottom of a check*) then you can use a Validation tool that will use the standard Lund Algorithm to calculate the final digit which is the checksum.

That wouldn't work here because Chase assigned different account numbers for the Visa Debit cards but it does work for BOA and many others."

Actually the first 6 are easy to narrow down - We know the bank (*Chase*) the Brand (*Visa*) and the Product (*debit*) - we can look online and find the first 6 digits for  all Chase issued cards. Then we filter that list down to only include visa cards and debit cards and that leaves us with...

The following number sets:

406032, 406042, 406045, 406068, 412451, 412453, 420767, 428208, 430326, 431231, 434769, 441103, 441105, 442732, 442742, 442755, 450952, 456323, 456331, 461046, 473622, 475055, 475056, 478200, 483312, 483316, 483323, 483324, 486742, 486796, 490070, 490071, 406032, 406042, 406045, 406068, 412451, 412453, 420767, 428208, 430326, 431231, 434769, 441103, 441105, 442732, 442742, 442755, 450952, 456323, 456331, 461046, 473622, 475055, 475056, 478200, 483312, 483316, 483323, 483324, 486742, 486796, 490070, 490071.

Since we already have the last 4, that just leaves 6 unknown digits (*out of a total of 16*) which are the first 6 digits of their account number. 

This might leave the OP reasonable secure if it was a random string of digits, but since credit card numbers follow the Lund formula for checksum verification, it really narrows the potential numbers down to about 20% of initial random number groups.

Anyone with a decent credit card validation program could write a script to validate the remaining possibilities fairly quickly and come up with a short list  of potential 16 digit numbers which could be his debit card number to start testing.

Then we need to determine the expiration date which only has a maximum of 60 possible options. Fortunately you can validate card number and exp date without throwing up red flags (*see below*) they could fairly quickly condense the initial list even further.

Finally we need the CVV which seems like it would be a bit trickier as it has 1000 possible choices and credit card validation system throws up an alert if you enter the wrong CVV too many times. However, as that is only on a single site or merchant processor - so all someone would need to do is write script which distributed the 1000 potential options through multiple sites and merchant operators and they should be able to determine the CVV within a few hours at that point.
