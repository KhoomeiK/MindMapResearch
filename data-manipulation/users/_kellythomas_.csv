xboxone,ffjszse,t1_ffiacmx,1580006126.0,"I was playing Lego Star Wars on the original Xbox  (almost 15 years ago now!).  My son is unfamiliar with the star wars brand and didn't show much enthusiasm when I showed him TCS.

He has asked to play Lego Batman a couple of times so we tried the first one but he found the shared screen a bit of a hassle, we spent a far bit of time having stand near someone so the other could perform an action without playing tug of war with the screen border.

Since we finished Undercover we have been alternating between that and The Lego Movie Videogame. He has been enjoying the movie tie in but finds the co-op level design and character abilities to be a bit restrictive.

In comparison Undercover was originally designed as a single player game with a single character wearing costumes.  None of the puzzles required any two player coordination and we can both play the same role (robber, astronaut, etc) at the same time.  This was great because I can play through a puzzle while the 3 year old spends 5 minutes running up the stairs and sliding down the bannister (or whatever else catches their eye)."

This is difficult.

Popular games have by definition sold well.  

As far as I see they really only have three options:

 1. Use popular games and accept that for many gamers they already own the title. *""Nothing but dupes""*
 2. Use unpopular games so that fewer gamers own the title. *""Why don't they have games I want to play?""*
 3. Negotiate with publishers to include a title at launch.  This worked well for Rocket League but it only provides such a strong benefit for multiplayer games, and for many players it leaves the impression that it should have been FTP anyway."

xboxone,ffhvmaf,t1_ffgymzb,1579955964.0,"My 3 year old loved that game.

He has since moved on to Toy Story 3 and Lego City Undercover but Rush was the game he learnt to play 3rd person action games on.

 (His hands are too small to hold the gamepad properly so he sits it on his lap and uses his whole left hand for the left thumbstick and hits the face buttons with his right hand like his playing an arcade game.)"
