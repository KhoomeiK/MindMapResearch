movies,fe60y66,t3_enrh8c,1578879331.0,"I think live-action anime has a chance to become the Next Big Thing in movie franchises. Probably not from one single anime franchise, but imagine if Warner Brothers (or whoever--I don't know who if any owns the rights now) was able to get the rights for Evangelion, Dragonball, and One Piece all at once. 

They could do really well if the writing, acting, and effects were great. It would be something slightly different in Hollywood, and an opportunity to get away from the well-established franchises. 

The last Dragonabll live-action movie was very poorly done, but it didn't need to be. Starting with Vegeta, movies spanning Dragonball Z could be incredibly fun."

Inside, I had to climb over the Pit of Cobras, and after that, I swam the Pool of Healing. Then I had to figure out a way to crawl under the Magma Waterfall of Divine Wrath. Finally, I came across the Chamber of Wondrous Treasure, and had to answer the riddle of an ancient Sumerian ghost.

AskReddit,fcmdrre,t3_ehxviz,1577771640.0,"Not sure if most people in America consider this a bad thing, but living with your parents.

You'll save a lot on rent. Have a great support system. Your mom will make you food and do your laundry (well maybe). 

In fact, it is ok to do it even when you are married! Chinese people do it all the time. Free childcare. More free food. etc.

Most people in America (including myself) probably would like to live apart from their parents. But it certainly doesn't have to be something ""bad"".

My own personal opinion on the main reason that men don't want to, is that it can be a total buzzkill if you're dating. I think a lot of women are turned off by guys that live with their parents, so a guy just has to get his own place."

It's really unfortunate, and I wish he had understood that there were many people who would have rooted for him. I'm glad he was able to make an impact on your life."
