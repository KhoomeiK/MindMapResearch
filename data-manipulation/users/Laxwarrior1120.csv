1 human year is 365.25 days

365.25 x 7= 2556.75 dog days in a human year

Since our 7x has already been taken into account we can go back to normal math at this point

24 hours per day

2556.75 x 24 = 61362 dog hours in one human year

Compare that to 8766 human hours in a human year


Let's assume a 6 hour school time constant 

8766/6 is 1461, meaning that one in school day is 1/1461 of our total year (or 0.068%) 

Now for dog time 

61362/6= 10227, so 1/10227 or 3.5%  assuming that our school hours stay consistent as human across both calculations... obviously a ridiculous number that in no way reflects the actual time frame, so let's try it with the dog year timeframe for the second equation.

61362/(6x7)= 1/1461, same as the first eruption, proving that the time experienced by both dog hours and human hours is statically the same.

Also side note: assuming that we get a generous 90 day summer break and all weekend off and 45 days off for other random days off (125 days in total that we have school).

Under those extremely generous breaks we spend 8.5% of the year in school."
