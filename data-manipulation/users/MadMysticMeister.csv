codevein,fdicbe4,t1_fdfy53n,1578439687.0,"A arena mode could do but I just wanted to know about the census on a invasion system, I didn’t expect such a rejection of the idea."
codevein,fdib3ye,t1_fdexn1s,1578439015.0,Well a dark souls invasion isn’t balanced and that’s ok because it gives the host the advantage because you know... forced participation.

darksouls3,fdenl8u,t1_fdek81z,1578342794.0,A Group of players attacking one player at once.
codevein,fdelnyx,t1_fdehom6,1578341654.0,"Well ok first off In ds3 I think invasions were meant to balance out having summons help crush levels and gank bosses, darksouls is meant to be a challenge why should the game let you have it easy with no consequences? Secondly, dying to a invader isn’t an issue at all you lose nothin but a little bit of time. Third your not gonna be invaded unless you’re ember or have summons helping you so yeah accept the game’s consequences. 

Now my question was if a darksouls like invasion system could work or if one should even be implemented. I originally asked because I was thinking about how the game could have pvp implemented and invasions was the obvious and only system I thought could work. I apologize for any transgressions on my end, I did not mean to offend or be rash."
codevein,fdehy4m,t1_fdeh9r7,1578339409.0,Yeah I think that’s a issue in general! This game has a few issues when it comes to damage.
codevein,fdehlbk,t1_fdeh2te,1578339189.0,"I understand you but I think we’ll have to agree to disagree, In ds3 I love being invaded and invading because of the surprise factors."
codevein,fdeh7o3,t1_fdeeok5,1578338957.0,“OH YOU SAILTY BRO” that kind can be toxic but invasions aren’t that bad.
codevein,fdegyxh,t1_fde80w9,1578338808.0,"I suggested a few times that invaders could be limited to a few select abilities while the invaded could use whatever they wished and they’ll have their partner too. There can be nerfs too for the invader, like less healing but I don’t think anymore nerfs would be necessary to the invader. Of course souls levels should still determine who you invade. 

Pesky blue, I bet you kill mound makers for no reason.."
codevein,fde9r5o,t1_fde4sgx,1578334295.0,"Ok I already said this a few times so please go look at my other comments. To summarize what I said I think invaders could be limited to specific abilities, while the invaded could use anything."
codevein,fde9czi,t1_fddwgbc,1578334045.0,"It won’t necessarily need balancing if the invasions aren’t meant to be balanced. Like dark souls 3 the invaders are always disadvantaged to begin with and that’s fair because the invaded didn’t have a choice in the encounter even happening. I think invaders could only use a few select abilities and have less healing, while the invaded could use whatever, and that would be fair. 

There shouldn’t be a opt out but requirements to be invaded. Now I’m not sure how arenas could work that would require some actual balancing!"
codevein,fde81f1,t1_fde4b9q,1578333209.0,"I suggested the invader could use certain select abilities while the invaded could use there op builds. I want the invaded to have the home field advantage to make up for not having a choice of being invaded, yeah I don’t think there should be a opt out, because if you’re playing online then what else are you doing?"
codevein,fde75oj,t1_fde2gfo,1578332660.0,"You’re friends sound weak haha, I understand though."
codevein,fde6zgu,t1_fddw0pr,1578332552.0,"Yeah I’m thinking the invader could only use select invasion abilities (maybe covenants could provide different load outs) while the invaded could use whatever and there partner, this will give the invaded the home field advantage.  I think everyone playing online should atomically be targeted though, because what is an invasion if expected? I just don’t know how a ember system could be implemented, I don’t want completely random invasions, but maybe a bloodborne invasion style could do."
