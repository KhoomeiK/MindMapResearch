todayilearned,ffi6y2c,t1_ffgdlt0,1579966709.0,I grew up in Cape Town but we called it Diesel.. Funny how these things develop a mysticism of sorts. Heard it called Ketemba too.
todayilearned,ffglzhx,t1_ffgdlt0,1579909329.0,Cape Town? Tassenberg?
todayilearned,ffgamn3,t1_fffs8fr,1579902054.0,"Called ""Diesel"" in South Africa.. Was pretty common when I was a teen."
nottheonion,ffa6dl2,t1_ff9xqr7,1579728762.0,What do you have against chicken breasts?
nottheonion,ff9vgqm,t1_ff9v89x,1579722374.0,True but irrelevant to the context.
nottheonion,ff9somd,t1_ff994yb,1579720395.0,Plenty people of colour with short hair. The issue is the length of his dreads not his race. Archaic policy but it is policy. All of the students are held to the same standards.. That seems like equality to me.
nottheonion,ff9r84k,t1_ff9lfi8,1579719308.0,Same where I grew up. Pretty sure this has nothing to do with race.. If a Caucasian male had a ponytail they'd be required to cut it too.
