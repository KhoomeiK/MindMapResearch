minnesota,ff9y3ve,t1_ff9xndj,1579724007.0,"Yes I live in Minnesota. Ive lived here for 2 years. I lived in south Texas for 18. I've been to Austin many many times, I've been to the DFW are many many times. My family live in both cities and I can tell you that both have great transportation. Austin has a huuuuuge population, especially thanks to how many California transplants there are and UTA. I can tell you now driving is way worse than taling the many buses or trains. As for the DFW area, transportation is amazing. Dallas itself is pretty good, and the trains stop at most of the surrounding cities, even if they are tiny. San Antonio does not have a system for trains but there are bus stops literally everywhere."
minnesota,ff9r4um,t1_ff9ho2x,1579719234.0,You could literally find articles like that about anywhere but I don't really feel like speaking to someone who doesn't have experience with both states. Youre dismissed
minnesota,ff99z4j,t1_ff8w1t1,1579708223.0,Are you serious? Austin has the best public transportation by far. They started implementing it way before each of those other cities. You obviously have no clue lmao. You're dismissed.
Advice,ff8k64h,t3_es7q1z,1579682342.0,"Something similar happened to my sister. She was visiting me from another state when a girl that was on her phone ran a light and totaled her car. Girl lied and said my sister ran a light. Unfortunately there were no witnesses/cameras and both parties had liability insurance, so nothing happened. This is all pretty messed up already since the girls can was minorly damaged. My sister tried also reopening the case, etc but unfortunately they can't really do anything. If you may be able to get some surveillance/witnesses, I would. Otherwise, you'll just have to get it fixed or move on to trying to find another way of transportation."
minnesota,ff8jazi,t1_ff8j0bu,1579681111.0,"I don't live in a rural area and the closest bus stop is a 20 minute walk. That isn't good public transportation. I live in a big neighborhood as well. Also, grey hound bus stops are not as frequent and there aren't as many. I used to walk those few miles and I've had to take the grey hound distances."
minnesota,ff8ibww,t1_ff8hy40,1579679804.0,"The heat in Texas definitely does not bother me. Its hot and humid but I grew up in that and at least it doesn't limit your options as much. Bugs are eh, never had a problem with mosquitos, roaches can be common if you're not keeping clean all the time. Crickets are a problem. Can't agree on public transportation though, we have tons if greyhound and other bus services as well as city transportation and trains both locally and across the state. Also, yes we call people from Minnesota yankees but not much different than the people here assuming I'll actually be going yeehaw. Texans generally just wanna eat, drink, and party. Theyre loud, but welcoming."
minnesota,ff8i40v,t1_ff8hzp7,1579679511.0,"Yeah even if I did enjoy my time here I probably wouldn't stay past 5. To me its kinda like feeling trapped at times, having not much to do or no one to talk to. The twin cities are a whole lot better than these smaller ones though."

minnesota,ff8er0m,t1_ff8akbq,1579675358.0,"2 years I've been here. I think its only great if you're a middle class family. I still work 3 jobs on top of school. Its hard to make friends here since people are generally unpleasant. I've never ever been so unhappy in my life. I've hated it the entire time, but I thought I'd give it 2 years and see how I like it, but I just hate it even more. People go on and on about how pretty it is and the lakes and whatever, but there are lots of prettier states with more to offer. Even my home state, Texas, has such diverse landscapes, a beach, little to no snow, people are much nicer, and theres so much more to do. This was such a mistake on my part, I guess you live and you learn. Do you plan to move?"
minnesota,ff8c4l1,t1_ff8bttj,1579672519.0,"Though that is something that is offered in most states. There are people that will help in dire situations everywhere. I don't mean this in a bad way, but have you tried living in another state for a minimum of like a year?"
minnesota,ff8bjd9,t1_ff8baws,1579671920.0,Not really. I thought people would be nice here because of the rumor of that being the case but no its ridiculous how much people go out of their way to fuck up your day. Gotta go back to that southern hospitality
minnesota,ff87zro,t1_ff87p2m,1579668630.0,"I cant say I've enjoyed any of the time whatsoever. Compared to TX theres way less to do, people are a whole lot more rude and some just all around selfish. I've had more bad times than good. I really did try to like it, but my property management is bad, my school was bad and tuition went up $1k in a year and no one really cares about out of state students, some girl totaled my sisters car while texting and driving and thats something I've seen happen right in front of me before here, it's too cold and since theres nothing to do but go to a park or something that makes it boring, no public transport, etc. Only good thing in comparison is that minimum wage is higher. Otherwiss I can't handle how rude everyone is."

I'd loooove to live in Colorado, Oregon, and lots of other prettier and fun states that happen to have snow."

TwoXChromosomes,fet0waw,t3_eqhi8w,1579370826.0,"When I was 17 I got pregnant. We used a condom (which broke), and I took a Plan B pill. I'm sure the condom broke because neither of us really knew how to use them, thanks Texas for the abstinence only sex education. After this I didn't think anything of it because I thought I took the right steps. It wasn't very long before I had the feeling of just knowing that I was pregnant. I had no symptoms yet because I caught it very early. Took 3 pregnancy tests and yep, I was right. A lot of the time, we don't WANT abortions, but we also don't want to raise children in the wrong environment. I grew up ver very poor and became a manager at a pizza place when I was 16 to pay for all my personal finances and take some pressure off my mom. I wasn't going to put that pressure back on her. I also just began dating my boyfriend, who I knew wanted to go out of state for college. I was too young, too broke, and mentally and physically not prepared. I went through a long process of meeting a lawyer, a judge, and someone to act as my guardian. I opted for the surgical abortion over the pill because I wanted to get it over with quickly. This was the worst pain I've ever felt and I felt so relieved, yet so sad. I still think about it, but as a 19 year old struggling with 3 jobs I know I made the right decision. This was tough for me to do, but I don't want my own child to grow up the way I did. Sometimes this is whats best for yourself and the child that would come to be. Dont feel guilty and good luck"

Advice,fe5urla,t3_enrf6h,1578875407.0,"If it is safe to tell ypur parents, then you should do so. I have never shared this but when I was 17 I had an abortion. It was too close to myself and my boyfriend moving across the country for college, and even now I work 3 jobs on top of school. It is your decision, but both choices will have a huge impact on your entire life. You are young and keeping the pregnancy will definitely mess with your plans for school, and you will need to somehow support said child while still growing up yourself. If you choose to get an abortion you may not be hugely affected, or it may be something you think of daily. In my case I cried for months after but I was also so relieved. Time is also important, as different states have different laws for/against abortions. I chose not to tell anyone at the time and had to see a lawyer, judge, doctor, etc. Janes Due Process helped me a lot with this. You may have to tell your parents, but explore all of your options. It doesnt matter if the boy wants to keep it or not, this is a decision tbat will have a huge impact on yourself, way more than anyone else. Good luck."
