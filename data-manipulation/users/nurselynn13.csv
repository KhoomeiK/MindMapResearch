BipolarReddit,ff47wve,t3_erczve,1579557479.0,I think with bipolar you are always at risk. I mean yeah the meds help but they aren't 100%. Weed works differently for each person. If it has triggered you in the past I would stay away from it.
Art,ff45877,t3_eriun4,1579555812.0,Wow. Amazing work.

BipolarReddit,ff3yzzo,t3_eridqp,1579551941.0,I self admited to a private behavioral health hospital.  I just called and made sure they took my insurance then went in for intake and was admitted.
FriendsAndShit,ff3v51m,t3_er462h,1579549528.0,Hey! I'm right there with you. Anxiety can be a killer. It's hard to start a relationship as adults to begin with anyway.  I'm in Phoenix if you wanna talk.
bipolar,fesikdk,t1_fer4g93,1579365574.0,I haven't had to use it for my self but I have used it for a patient as a nurse. It is binding in the state of Arizona. I'm not sure how it works elsewhere.
bipolar,fepmsi4,t3_eq8llk,1579324673.0,I have one. It's incase I get to the point that I need to go in patient but am not ok to make that decision myself.
lgbt,feor840,t3_eq7zs7,1579304338.0,Thank you for always being wonderful!

bipolar,fdll16r,t3_elwsnn,1578526413.0,I struggle with this as well. I showered today but the last time I did before today was Saturday.  It sucks. I'm sorry we share this.
bipolar,fdgyzmq,t3_elbjna,1578411741.0,I'm in the same boat. I need friends.  It's hard as an adult to make friends though.
bipolar,fdeq3ol,t1_fdeogju,1578344261.0,Thank you. And thank you for being awesome for your bf.
bipolar,fdekruk,t3_ekvjlq,1578341120.0,Thank you everyone for the support. I wish you all the best.

bipolar,fdejv9c,t1_fdehf49,1578340570.0,Oh I was crying as i typed it. I am truly blessed.
bipolar,fdeesul,t1_fde943l,1578337461.0,I'm sorry about your boyfriend.  There are some great guys out there. I hope you find one. You deserve nothing less.
FriendsAndShit,fcub3tq,t3_eit9lr,1577976839.0,I had a friend I was super close with. We saw each other several times a week. Talked all day every day.  We were super close. She was toxic. I dropped her. It was hard. And i still miss her occasionally but no one deserves to be treated that way. Especially the stuff with the guy. Hell no! Who's to say she won't keep doing that with the next guy you like? Sounds like it's time to move on. It will suck but you deserve better.
lgbt,fcu9svt,t1_fct6x9s,1577975941.0,Sleeves for your arms. Think leg warmers but for your arms. Thumb holes would help if you decide to give it a shot.
lgbt,fct6o6a,t3_eir4sb,1577934276.0,I second dice bags. Also sleeves.

lgbt,fcklgx2,t3_ehbzbg,1577727911.0,I met my amazing SO on plenty of fish.  Dont get me wrong there is plenty of rift raf to sort threw but there are good people there if you look hard enough.
FriendsAndShit,fbhtfpv,t1_fbht1ey,1576881882.0,Not nearly as exciting.  So far so good. Just got home.  Boring day really. Tomorrow I'm going to Albuquerque though so that's something.
