kratom,ff0c2np,t1_fezct0a,1579467486.0,"I was a daily user for more that 4 years. At times my use was as high as 15g/day, but for the last 6 months or so I've been down to about 4g/day. Recently stopped for a whole slew of reasons and felt almost no withdrawals other than crankiness and lethargy. Couple of days of that and now nothing. It's really not that bad, at least for me."
trees,fewe5vt,t1_fevow7k,1579409089.0,Fuck. I took 60mg once and thought I was gonna die. Can't even imagine 1000mg.

kratom,feltdhj,t3_epjono,1579230454.0,I'm in the middle of a couple of months long break after years of daily use. The first weekend I felt absolutely no motivation to do anything. By Monday I felt loads better and by two weeks I was 100%.

Part of the reason I've stopped taking it daily. It's kinda a bummer because I really miss taking it every day"

kratom,fdrz7nb,t1_fdqiqja,1578691887.0,"I second this. Try taking 500 mg - 1000mg of Agmatine about 45 minutes before dosing. Worked wonders for me. 

**But**

The single best way to reset tolerance is to take a couple of weeks off.

Good luck."
kratom,fdouf8x,t1_fdodq9b,1578613118.0,"My primary care doc knows I take kratom and has no issue with it. But yeah, because I work with the anesthesiologist who was assigned to my case I was hesitant to tell him. 


I wish that there wasn't so much misinformation out there about kratom because it really is a miracle plant."
kratom,fdo74hw,t1_fdnhhcv,1578600046.0,"I’m a surgical nurse and all of the information you’ve provided (via the anesthesiologist) about propofol is very accurate. I really appreciate you posting this as I know many people are concerned about it.

Over a year ago I had propofol for the first time and I’m a daily kratom user too.  Because I work at the hospital where I had my procedure I did not tell the anesthesiologist (I know, I know, I should have) because I didn’t want my coworkers knowing my business. But I had NO issue with going under easily, and I woke up just fine."
kratom,fdo618u,t1_fdnshvh,1578599513.0,"Eh. Unless you’re taking huge amounts of kratom daily (like upwards of 20 grams per day) you should be good. 

I’m a pre-op and post-op nurse. We see poor pain control after surgery in patients taking lots of narcotics daily."
kratom,fdo5mgq,t1_fdnjx17,1578599311.0,"We see this in patients who either drink a lot of alcohol, or take a lot of pain meds, or smoke a lot of pot. Makes them need more to sedate them.

Or as punkypoo says, people with red hair."
kratom,fdo5fwc,t1_fdo0pvj,1578599218.0,"She had salmonella, so most likely that’s what caused the diarrhea. The morphine and kratom combined is what dropped her pressure and heart rate.

kratom,fdhzn8c,t1_fdhm408,1578433083.0,"And I’ll add to this. Smaller doses (1-4 g) usually stimulate, and you generally need larger doses for pain relief (4-7 g), although many people take less and feel pain relief. I need at least 4 g to get pain relief. 

I second the scale suggestion as eyeballing kratom never worked for me."

kratom,fdf3qwt,t1_fdegbgq,1578352625.0,"I'm sorry about your situation but **do not start taking phenibut.** It is highly addictive and has one of the most awful withdrawals ever. You can become addicted to it after taking it only a few times. Sometimes the withdrawal is so bad it requires hospitalization. 


This drug is bad news. It was created in a lab by Russia in the sixties and is illegal in many countries. Please don't pick this up when you run out of Kratom."
