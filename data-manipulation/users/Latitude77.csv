bipolar,fef1nua,t3_eop42d,1579046076.0,I believe you!!  I followed the same path.
bipolar,fdg8a1m,t1_fdezghx,1578384232.0,I agree. There are many of us don't have the strength to push through.  You should be proud of yourself.  Yes it is hard but remember it is  worse going back.

bipolar,fd8i0sh,t3_ek9bmy,1578218558.0,"Just remember if you  plan to drive out at the last minute your standard car needs air or it will die with you in it. Rescue vehicles don't have the same problem.  Leave early...it is just stuff. Your life is not stuff.

I so feel for you.  The intensity is insane. I  have never seen anything like it."

bipolar,fd8ego5,t3_ek5uwo,1578217504.0,"Welcome to the medicated world of bipolar.  Accept it. I'm still struggling after +5 years but it is what it is.  Hold down a high paying job and live a ""fruitful"" life.

Sorry if I sound bitter/indifferent but I  could not lead the life I do without sucking it up"
bipolar,fd8crbd,t3_ek9bmy,1578216947.0,Watching from Sydney. I can feel the  suffering of many. I can't imagine what it's like being close. All we have to complain about is the smoke and never seeing blue skies.  RAIN! RAIN! RAIN!
bipolar,fcwmrb8,t3_ej70r6,1578030047.0,I'm right with you. But change to 30 years (yep a tough old girl) and 4 years medicated.  It takes time to find the right meds but much more is the time to  adjust being on the meds. It is a whole new world.  KEEP TRYING you are worth it!
bipolar,fcdhxs9,t3_eh0cw5,1577610216.0,It is  very brave to do what you have done! Stay strong
bipolar,fcdfoif,t3_eh3gby,1577609575.0,It was years ago when I first heard it. It still  is funny. If you can't laugh at schitt you need to reassess...to put it in perspective I have been bipolar for +30 years. Yes still amazes me I am still alive with a high paying job...take your meds kids...You gravitate to humour more and more...no point on wasting it on schitt
