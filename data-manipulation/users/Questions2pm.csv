povertyfinance,ffdjw1f,t3_esv6lr,1579822433.0,"Unpopular opinion maybe (made without reading the other comments) but if your parent raised you well and has always been kind to you, I think it rather heartless not to help them as they get to that age where they need help. If your parent is in anyway abusive disregard this comment.

I think the real concern would be with setting proper expectations and boundaries.

I think this is something many people are going to have to contend with and many in the United States (and other areas where young aren't used to caring for elders) are going to have to adjust to. There is increasingly a generation of old folks needing help that have limited pensions, social security, disability, and access to health care and assisted living services."

If the strawman exists it certainly paints the woman in a more sympathetic light. I know many people struggle in abusive relationships and it's tragic. However, the actions taken by the woman would still not be legal or reasonable - it's not acceptable to steal every single financial asset in a marriage even if you plan to divorce. 

So basically I'm still not seeing it, sorry."

Because you're right that is important. We as a society don't treat people with mental health problems right or understand their symptoms. It has been like this for a long time

I think one reason to be supportive of what the article describes is that many people with mental health problems are still capable of understanding and providing consent. Many issues like depression are not always curable and i totally understand how after decades of aggressive treatments with no improvements and no other options someone making this choice. I think my place is to respect that"

Tulpas,fekno7x,t3_epnv1d,1579203830.0,"A tulpa is essentially an imaginary friend. People in this community would generally add 'sentient' imaginary friend. 

Creating sentience or even the illusion of sentience requires great imagination and attention to detail. Creating a full illusion where you see, hear, smell, and so forth requires actively imagining and stimulating each of those senses. 

Let's contextualize this. 

When you encounter another person you see them with your eyes. You smell their perfume. You hear their voice.  You feel them if you hug. And if you're close enough perhaps taste them when you kiss. 

All of your senses in this case come from stimulation of nerves, allowing you to feel, to sense. 

With a tulpa, each of these senses have to manually be stimulated by imagination or 'forcing'. Depending on how imaginative you are this may come naturally or require frequent effort and attention. 

In  short: it's not creepy but necessary.  It's the tulpa handshake. When you meet another person they stimulate your senses naturally because they are physical reality. 

When you meet a tulpa (many) people have to do all that manually. 

I do believe that through effort this is supposed to come naturally as your tulpa 'becomes' a person. For some this happens instantly but from what I've read, for most it takes effort and time

Disclaimer: I'm not actually a part of this community. I study social work and psychology and find tulpamancy fascinating. A lot of my answer comes from that background and understanding and I just wanted to make that bias clear"
AmItheAsshole,fekjyxq,t3_epjirr,1579201631.0,"These are the posts I feel uncomfortable answering. Because you are legally responsible for your child's (and I know 16 isn't a 'child'), it's best not to lock them out. Some will agree, disagree, whatever.

I think that's missing the point a little. Some teenagers go through a very difficult development period. I believe your child needs professional help, support, and guidance. I also think being more strict about the marijuana is a good idea if you are searching for where to be firm. 

Some teenagers need time. My brother was a very troubled child and teenager. He smoked pot everyday, got black out drunk, struggled in school, lied to therapists. It was my mother's patience, sterness only when needed, and approaching him and having discussions that finally got him to open up about some spurs serious issues.  He eventually did a complete 180, completed university, and works a good job at a hospital. Success might look different to your child and it might not come on a conventional time table. 

My point is to focus on supporting your son. Does this help him? Make that the core.

TrueOffMyChest,fe999hm,t3_eo4qkr,1578935514.0,"I don't think sharing is bad - it's important and good. A supportive network is one pho the most amazing and protective factors against some ailments like depression. But advice I often see on here is terrible and conflicts with expert advice. Plus no one should ideally be fighting a serious health problem without seeking professional advice/ opinion. 

Now sometimes professionals be wrong, be asshole, or disagree but many folks on here use that as a reason to not get help when they are suffering from serious mental health problems, which is my concern. That means needless suffering, intensifying of symptoms, more difficult treatment when the person needing help finally seeks it, or even death. 

I wish people related, shared, and got help and advice from experienced helpers in their fields"
gayyoungold,fdsgg1b,t3_emz0hv,1578702235.0,"The short answer is yes.

trashy,fdoayy6,t1_fdnm4mr,1578601929.0,"It's not that they hate being educated but that everyone has their own educational and cultural context. I think this thread is a really good example of everyday people rejecting the educated/ expert opinions on a topic. 

Why is this?

Would you dress the same way for a funeral as to the beach? Talk to a childhood friend with the same language you'd use to talk to a work colleague?

If some child is rude to another child on the basis of race and the rude child is black, the most correct terminology would be to use the word prejudice to describe the behaviour. But the white child's parents are going to call it racism. 

In my mind I am very practical and if I was an educator I'd be more inclined to just start working on the problem that is happening. I could get into it with the parents about what word is right and educate them on the concepts but it would be inappropriate because they want to be heard. I'll put in my notes the correct wording and use it if I run an educational campaign... But to argue with emotionally upset people on the subject is futile. 

The people in this thread are the same. I feel the frustration too and did leave a few comments but I'm just trying to say there's a time and a place."

trashy,fdo8av8,t1_fdnt90n,1578600628.0,"I notice that you really want racism to be simple but it's not. You are also misunderstanding in that anyone can discriminate, have prejudice, etc. 

Racism as a concept deals more so with the construction of a racial identity that is less than and about systematic power. Sometimes is misunderstood as ""white people can't be victims"" but of course they can.  

I can understand where the misunderstanding comes from because these concepts are often poorly taught and this is a very sensitive topic. But I wanted to comment just to let you know that."

If you as a parent are the latter you aren't a bad parent if you consciously take the steps to bond and learn to parent well. This is why there are parenting classes, child welfare specialists , guides on bonding to your children, etc.

Canadians receive less social security.  You have forms of social security there that aren't on the radar here. 

We receive public healthcare but in comparison to Finland it is more limited. 

Work culture depends on where you work. 

Finland for the average person is a better country to live in. That said we do have less crime :)

We also have an incredibly difficult immigration process which may be relevant tu know. 

I've studied and compared our countries.  Also there are numerous websites that specialize in comparing countries if you want more information. 

Don't get me wrong we aren't a bad country.  We're pretty awesome but I'm giving to an honest answer. If this is that only way to be with your spouse he or she picked a decent country to settle it, but think about it carefully.

I just wanted to say I'm really sorry that your parents don't listen like they should. My perspective was more or less if you aggressively seek help they'd have no choice.  I'm really biased because i was abused growing up and one of my regrets will always be not coming forward sooner.  But that's my life and not yours...And therefore I missed your perspective. So just wanted to comment back to apologize

And I still think you should seek help if you ever want or need to because you deserve it, but it's something that is your choice entirely and there are many ways to seek help, including just talking about it. Some people never do so even what you're doing now is incredible

I also just hope that things get better."
