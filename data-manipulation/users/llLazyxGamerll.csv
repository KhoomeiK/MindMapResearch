depression,ff25wp9,t3_eqs4h8,1579494696.0,"Honestly dude, I thought I was doing something wrong by not getting better from ""help"". I guess the truth about depression is that it doesn't wear off like the flu but instead stays with you like a type of cancer. It takes more than medicine and rest to cure it. Wish life would be easier though and that it can all go away but reality sucks.

I mean it's not just me, right? the one on the left, the guy has a ginger beard and the lady has light brown wavy hair; the picture on the right however, he has a dark brown beard and she has black straight hair.

depression,fec64bx,t3_em9wpt,1578967263.0,"Honestly, that guy is a piece of garbage. Screw him and his stupid life. You are in no need to ever feel that it's your fault when terrible people like him come your way because honestly, that guy is a predator and he will do anything to get close to good people who don't deserve it.

 Just understand that if you ever feel like you can't trust someone then just make a mental checklist. Such as, if the person is nice to everyone, are they respected by others, do they make you want to be more open to them, do they give off good vibes? you can even ask others about the person you meet (if possible) before you share any private info or anything with them. Hope this helped and good day to u \^w\^"
