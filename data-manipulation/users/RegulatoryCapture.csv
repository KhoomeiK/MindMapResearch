And you know how you know it is extremely unlikely?  Because Apple is able to sell you the insurance, at a profit, without doing ANY sort of check on your past behavior or risk profile.  They have already built into the price the fact that people who *know* they are clumsy are going to buy the insurance.  These plans are no different from the crap they sell you at Best Buy that is designed to prey upon uninformed customers and people who aren't good at evaluating overall risk.

They don't sell these things out of kindness--they make a boatload of money on these plans.  Don't buy insurance on things that won't bankrupt you if they go bad.

Showerthoughts,ffcc7k7,t1_ffc1i55,1579796302.0,"My tactic lately for quantitative classes has been to start from the sample exam (there is almost always at least one).

First, I will make a rough cheat sheet with all of my formulas, facts, and reminders that I think I might need.  I'll use that cheat sheet to take the sample exam.  I'll keep note of anything I thought I was missing and add it to the list as I view the solutions.  If there are multiple old/practice tests, I will repeat with those.

Then I take the copy of the sample test that has the solutions into Acrobat. 
 Crop out all of the margins/whitespace and then set up the ""multiple pages per sheet"" print mode so that the sample exam will print into neat columns and leave the rest of the page blank.

With a laser printer, you can get this pretty small while still being legible and by cutting out the extra margins, you can easily fit many pages into a small space.  Then on the rest of the page, I copy down all of the formulas from my rough cheat sheet.

This ensures that I have all of the right formulas, but it also means that I have the practice solutions which contain explanations and examples in the professor's own words. 80% of the time I barely even glance at the sample tests because I've become familiar enough with the material that just looking at occasional formulas is all I need.

But 20% of the time...the sheet is clutch.  The professor will ask some question where the logic or explanation is tricky but for which some thing very similar was on the practice exam.  With my cheat sheet, I can make sure I use the exact terms and touch on the most important points.  Sometimes they just repeat questions from prior years as well (especially tough ones where simply having read the solutions a few days ago wouldn't equip you to actually write out the finer details)."

funny,ff9kfq6,t1_ff9fjkx,1579714887.0,"It is generally perfectly legal for people to detain thieves.

Companies don't want you doing it for a few reasons:

* The thief could hurt your employee--you don't want your employee hurt and you really don't want the workers comp claim or lawsuit that accuses you of putting your employees in dangerous situations with insufficient training.
* The thief could get hurt and try to sue you.  Sure, it is probably bogus, but what if they try to argue that they weren't really stealing?  They forgot the item was in their pocket and the employee spooked them and put them in ""fight or flight"" mode.  Even if the thief loses the lawsuit, you have to spend more money on lawyers than the item they stole cost.
* Employee could be mistaken.  Unlikely in this video, but I've been in situations where I felt like it looked like I was stealing.  A few weeks ago a store didn't have one of the items I needed, so I bought the other stuff, and put it into my backpack without a receipt.  I went to another store to try and find the missing item, but I had to pull out my prior purchases to make sure everything fit together.  Found the $.75 item that I needed, slipped the other items back into my bag and paid at the self checkout.  If you only saw the second half of that, you would have seen me slip a $50 item into my backpack and then go through the self checkout with something cheap (a common method of theft).  If you waited to review the tapes to send to law enforcement, you'd realize I never even went into the aisle where the $50 item is stocked...but detaining me for an hour while you figure that out is going to royally piss me off, lead to me shitting on you on social media, and possibly contacting local news media and lawyers.

Follow someone else.  When I've hit big jumps (which, admittedy, has been a while), there were always other people doing it.

The most important part of a jump like this is making sure you land on the sweet spot of the landing.  Too short and you smack into the flat spot (OP's video looks a bit short on jump #1).  Too long and you miss the landing and/or pick up more downward velocity than you wanted.

If you are hitting the sweet spot, even if you end up in the back seat and spin out on the landing, odds are that you will be fine.  The slope gently comes up to meet your direction of travel (unlike a flat landing that just smacks you) so a bad landing isn't too rough.

4 and 5 are almost mandatory although List and Thaler continue to be exceptions (who eventually completed step 5, but with some time at ""lesser"" institutions first). If you're really that good and have great ideas, that's probably going to get discovered while you are an AP and you'll be provided with opportunities to upgrade to a top university making step 5 inevitable if you are actually becoming ""one of the most prominent economists in the world"".

That being said...**all of these steps are kind of bullshit**.  They are like saying the secret to being a successful nascar driver is to drive fast and turn left.  Tons of people go through these steps and never become prominent.

Dunno about once they are in the air, but already, airlines don't even use the most efficient boarding processes because consumers don't like them as much.  On assigned-seat flights, it is much faster to board people in groups that correspond to where they are sitting in a way that reduces congestion and holdups in the aisle...but people would rather be boarded based on things like status, how much they paid, and as a family.

Even on unassigned seats we could do faster if we just don't care.  Southwest is the fastest big airline and manages to turn their planes around in 30+ minutes (measured from docking at the gate) with their A/B/C boarding and free checked bags that reduce the number of people fighting for overhead space...but they used do turns in like 10 minutes when boarding was simply a first-come-first-served line.

If we were to start treating planes like a giant bus or train in the sky, we could speed up a lot of aspects of flight.  Just have everyone line up, get on, and sit wherever.  Sure, keep first class for people who need a reserved space (like sleeper cars on a train), but have everyone else just be general admission using both the front and rear doors of the plane."

skiing,fdojn4s,t1_fdoe0e7,1578606486.0,"People who ski a lot have seen a huge drop in prices in the last few years (as long as they ski at a resort with epic/ikon access, or which cut prices to match).

People who only ski a few days a season are getting squeezed hard (like someone who flys out west to do 4-5 days).  Unfortunately, that includes people who are just starting to ski or learning to love the big mountains after only seeing little midwest hills.

Personally, I'm more worried about the long term...who is going to start skiing today if they didn't grow up skiing or learn somewhere cheap?  You heard how great Vail was, so you checked it out and realized it was gonna be $200/day for the lifts, $50+ for the rentals, $230 for a full day lesson...that's almost $500 before you start adding in food, transit, lodging...all for a sport you're not even sure you really like.

On the flip side...it has been great for the business operations of the resorts (and they are able to invest in infrastructure upgrades).  If the resort goes bankrupt and shuts down, we all lose out.  Given a lot of these resorts were originally built to sell condos, and those condos are all long since sold off...the resort needs a way to make money to stay open.  Better for the dirtbags if that means $$$ restaurants and no free parking, because at least those costs are avoidable with a sack lunch and carpool/shuttle from the free lot."

AskReddit,fdnpn3w,t1_fdni1bc,1578590504.0,">Digg came along and had a neverending torrent of posts, but comment threads there had a maximum depth of 2, so attempts at real back-and-forth quickly got confused and the quality of conversations suffered (FB suffers from this as well, much to the detriment of society- if they had real threading it might actually foster some meaningful discussion. Being able to downvote would be helpful, too).

I have always felt weird about threading.  On one hand, it is necessary on any massive site because you just can't handle that much content in a linear thread (like a regular forum).

On the other hand, I think it actually cuts back on the quality and depth of conversations.  Conversations with more than 2 people on the same topic don't flow well because they end up branching over and over again, and without any way to tie together or notify on new posts (new comment highlighting is a reddit premium feature, so most people don't have it), it turns into more of a situation where one person leaves their thoughts on what has already been posted, and then never returns except to follow up on direct responses.  It doesn't encourage engagement on a thread.  

Contrast this to a forum where you might have a thread running with 10-15 posters that can go for days on the same topic.  People pick up where they left off and read the comments in chronological order.  Direct responses make use of multi-quote features rather than creating new branches....and this allows multiple threads of discussion to be held together.  My main complaint about the smaller subreddits I visit is that you rarely feel like you get to know the other posters...the branching (and the fact that there is no bumping so comment threads die off fast) just limits how much you interact with the same users in a repeated fashion.

But that breaks down at large subreddit scale...just too much happening at once to use straight threads.  Limited comment depth is one approach that can help this in mid-size communities (like topic-specific facebook groups, not viral posts with 1k comments)--topics get branched based on the original comment but everything beyond there is a singular linear thread.  Unfortunately people don't generally know in advance which posts are going to generate a lot of discussion, so you don't end up with the ""right"" threads being formed.

Different subject matters also have different issues.  Car forums are so much better than car subreddits...some troubleshooting or modification processes just take time and being able to actively engage with a topic that was started a year ago makes sense."
