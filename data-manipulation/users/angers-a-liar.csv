rant,fez4vlm,t1_fewq3e1,1579453884.0,Ok sorry if that came off wrong still was in bad mood. But nah she is over me shes dating someone else. It’s just she has something called BPD and plus she gets jealous easy. So every time I get something and she don’t shes mad over it. She’s always been jealous of people who “tried to leave her” so I’m just one of them now. But that’s for the advice and trying to help.
rant,fewrmqz,t1_fewq3e1,1579418464.0,She is she has BPD. Sorry I was a little like annoyed still so needed to complain. Keep getting like mad on and off. So if anything in this sounds stupid sorry but Ik she didn’t care. She don’t give a fuck about me never will but that’s fine.
Anger,fet2bj8,t1_fesyuam,1579371177.0,I am it’s just that I lost control and I need to get that back. I’m doing better thanks. I’m trying books too.
ADHD,fet24ts,t1_feshic4,1579371117.0,I’ll try to do that cause I do the same thing
ADHD,fes5rxa,t3_eqgscl,1579361717.0,I always do that stuff. My mom told me to write on sticky notes what I’m supposed to do so I don’t forget stuff and I always forget about the sticky notes.
rape,fes59yx,t1_fes1aqy,1579361531.0,All I said is I don’t have PTSD. I do take fucking help. I have a therapist. I calm down from everything everyone says. I get books when I hate reading anyways. I write when I’m not ok. I write here when I’m upset and/or have questions. What do you want me to do? Tell my therapist I have ptsd. I literally only said I don’t you don’t need to attack me. I am getting help I do listen to people. What makes you think I’m not? And no I don’t want attention if I did I wouldn’t be anonymous and I’d tell you who I am. I’m sorry that I’m being open here cause I don’t wanna feel alone and I want help. I do not want attention you don’t need to reply or talk to me no one do. Half of my things don’t have comments on it. And idc if I was looking for attention I’d post more dramatic stuff not just about what I do. I can think of a lot worse than anger. And I’m saying I don’t have ptsd? How’s that looking for attention? If I wanted attention I’d tell you I probably do and be all dramatic.
Anger,fes3sem,t3_eqhe1o,1579361089.0,"That’s so relatable I always feel that way. But it isn’t your fault you didn’t give it to yourself. Shouldn’t beat yourself up for it. I always get mad at myself cause I got mad. I’ve had anger attacks cause I was getting mad then got more mad cause I was getting mad. It’s annoying as hell but just feels like normal at this point. Yea it’s annoying and I get it you wish you could control it but it doesn’t just happen. For one try to not be hard on yourself. I get it if you still are a lot and you’re trying hard to not. I try not to blame a lot on myself but I still do. Just less, try and do it less cause it helps. Two try to get help see a therapist if you can, and try stuff like writing down or read about anger management. That’s what I’ve been told helps. I find writing before I get really mad helps a lot. Just write when you feel like you’re going to explode. Ofc your still going to have anger attacks but that’s ok. They’re get better. I’m here if you need to talk."
rant,fes223e,t3_eqfdtp,1579360622.0,I completely agree with everything you say. It’s so stupid I don’t get it. Pedophilia is a literal disorder I’m not even trust saying that. They see kids as always sexualizing themselves. They should at least be sent somewhere to get help if they do that. Cause yea it’s dangering people. No they can’t control it but it can hurt people. There’s this movie called Lolita or something and it’s about a pedos prospective on how they see the child. It’s scary but there’s little hints you can see in the moving that she don’t want it. The whole movie looks like her just sexualizing herself because that’s how a pedo would see it. In reality she isn’t really sexualizing herself. Why’s that legal? Why’s a disorder that can hurt people legal? There’s stuff like psycho paths and other problems where they feel like killing people. Cause they don’t feel anything. They don’t feel taht it’s wrong. That doesn’t make it right to kill someone does it? And tbh being killed over raped I’m sure anyone would take. Rape hurts like Fycking hell tbh more mentally than physically. It’s something that sticks with you and don’t go away. When you’re killed it’s all over you don’t need to have a lifetime of pain. (No one who was raped should kts btw just saying that cause well it’s true. No one deserves to die tho. Just saying I’m away rape can be considered more hurtful then being killed.) idk what’s wrong with this world. They’ve even added pedophilia to the LGPTQ in some parts of the world. That’s soooo stupid. I have anger that doesn’t make me apart of the lgbtq. LGBTQ isn’t supposed to be fillied with mentally illness that’s for liking people in different ways. How’s a mental disorder apart of the lgbtq? What are they gonna do had anxiety next? I really hope that never happens in the us. I never want my kid to come to me and say I’m part of the lgbtq I’m a pedo. Like that puts people in danger and creeps are going to use that as an excuse to rape. No one in the lgbtq can hurt people cause of their sexuality a pedo can. I feel bad for them tbh because what they see isn’t what we see. Every little thing a kid does is sexualizing even the little stuff. Like licking a lollipop pop or putting on their shoes. They need help they can’t be told they’re lgbtq they aren’t that isn’t right. Yes they matter but mentally not like that. A gay person isn’t going to hurt someone cause they’re gay. I think they should send them to the mental if anything. Or at least get them a therapist and meds if there’s any for that. Probably isn’t but whatever. Imagine living in a country where pedophilia is legal. That’s be so scary it’d be so easy for someone to get advantage. That’s similar to someone saying “I have a killing disorder so I needed to go on a killing spree sorry”. Would they make taht legal? I hope not.
rape,ferxfnv,t1_ferhb2j,1579359347.0,Nah Ik I don’t have that it’s just stress and anxiety

depression,fep40ty,t1_fep3t8a,1579311639.0,I do reduce it. I’ve almost gotten mad a lot more than what I have. I’m controlling myself rn and not getting mad rn. And I have seen one I am trying my hardest.
depression,fep3oxg,t1_fep2vts,1579311432.0,Ik I hurt her known stop I fucking know that. I hurt everyone I should just block everyone out. I’m a piece of shit I hurt everyone. And no I can’t do that if I hurt someone I apologize. I can’t wait that long of I beat myself up.
depression,fep36sy,t1_fep2ph0,1579311107.0,I didn’t fucking mean it like taht why are you being such a fucking asshole. At first she said it’d hurt her mire if I blocked her. I’m scared of people committing suicide I’m sorry I have fears. You probably don’t you probably wouldn’t give a fuck if someone tried to kts. Yes I can control my anger a bit but I can’t control anger attacks those won’t fucking go. And I still have fucking problems going on I’m sorry you dknt fucking get that. Kind of stupid for thinking I can just stop having anger I can’t. That’s isn’t how it works. That’s like saying change the way the world moves like wtf ok have fun trying to do that.
depression,fep2eet,t1_fep1zr7,1579310607.0,She probably hates me probably wants me dead. And I am working hard I said this. And I’m always gonna cause harm I traumatized her. I made her a fucking addict and I made her sell herself.
depression,fep294c,t1_fep1lyc,1579310512.0,I’ve tried everything I’m doing all I can. Ik all I can isn’t enough never was never will be Ik that. I don’t wanna fucking make people suffer. Where do you see that? Where did I say I want others to suffer? Where Tf did I say that? Tell me now. You’re going to piss me off. I’m sorry that no one wants me Ik that but I can’t change it right away it don’t work like that. Ik it’s selfish but I don’t fucking want it. I don’t want anger I don’t want anything I wanna die that’s it. Idk why Tf I’m here that’s a good question I ask myself that daily. Im trying to change I’m trying to improve. But I’m always going to get mad that’s just how I am I can’t control that. It’s a mental illness it don’t go. It can only improve.
depression,fep1cgh,t1_fep0waa,1579309940.0,I can’t fucking control myself. I’m sorry I get mad at everyone and fucking kill them. If I blocked everyone out for hurting them I wouldn’t have anyone. You don’t understand me you don’t get it please don’t tell me to change myself. I’m trying I hate myself more than you hate me. You don’t even know me. I can’t just change I’m sorry ok. And I don’t wanna fucking block her out. That’d hurt me more because I wouldn’t know what she’d doing I need to know she’s fucking ok what Tf do you not understand. Don’t get it at all. I don’t understand why you don’t get what I’m saying. I have a stupid ass mental problem I can’t just change that. I’m sorry I get uncontrollably mad. If I could change that I would. But I can’t.
depression,fep0kj3,t1_feozpom,1579309449.0,I’m sorry she said that and her bf was upset so he felt bad cause he dindt compliment her boobs. Don’t think I should be apologizing for that.
depression,fep0i0w,t1_feozpom,1579309404.0,Why are you even saying taht here I didn’t say one thing bad about her here
depression,fep0ggz,t1_feozpom,1579309377.0,I’m sorry that I get anger attacks cause I made my ex a prostitute and heroin addict?

depression,feorikb,t3_eq8gy7,1579304445.0,You might just be sad but god knows. Are you stressed rn? Anything bad happening in your life? Is it only and night and when you’re not distracted or is it 24/7? Lots of questions sorry not saying you’re faking just questioning cause well you did say you don’t. Whatever’s going on it’ll be ok I promise. Depression and even sadness is hard to deal with. If you ever need to talk about anything I’m here. I deal with depression and anger and it’s very annoying. And I’m not used to it yet only had depression for a few months and it’s a long hard journey already. But it’ll be ok for both of us. I promise. You got this.

Anger,feok3sx,t1_fenvexw,1579301294.0,"I’m pretty sure it’s cause my ex and her mom and stuff. Just the pain in missing them and so much stress. I think I was reading stuff and someone called me a horrible person so I started thinking. And I lost one of my friends and got mad over it. A bit of the reason we’re not friends anymore and why he left js cause anger and that feels like crap.  I’ll probably try to find the books you mentioned and read them but I also have ADHD so hard to focus long enough to read. But I can get through a few pages a day. I’ve had anger forever. I got depression because i had a gf and her mom was very abusive physically, mentally and sexually. She didn’t physically or sexually in front of her but mentally yea. She was used to the mental abuse so ig she thought of it as nothing. She also didn’t understand why I got so mad at that time. She didn’t understand anger. Now I think she do cause she has mental problems now. She hasn’t physically abused her daughter tho just grabbing. She’s fucked her when she was younger too which would be sexually. But her mom also raped me and yea so very toxic place. I finally got out of it and my anger went crazy cause I was upset and stressed felt like everyone was attacking me. So I’d say stuff I didn’t mean and stuff. And then she became an alcoholic so when I got very mad at myself I’d be like wow now you’re an alcoholic and stuff. And she kept getting worse. So I got a little depressed it was like the beginning of it. But didn’t realize. I mean I realized I cut more but I’ve always self harmed cause of being upset after hurting someone so didn’t think anything of it. Then she did more and everyone kept denying everything I said so started pissing me off cause everything I said happened. I still get mad over how she does heroin about she’s a prostitute and how she has someone better than me and all that. How people didn’t believe me. Just everything stresses me out and it hurts. I was probably diagnosed with depression in October maybe a bit before so like 2-3 months after we broke up. I’ve attempted three times. Slitting wrists, overdose then wrists again. And it’s not cause her I hope you don’t think I’m saying it’s her fault. It isn’t it just all feels like mine cause I feel like I shouldn’t of left her and I shouldn’t of told my mom what her mom was doing. Feels horrible. I hate it. I’ve also always been the person who beats himself up over everything. Everytime I say something wrong I just feel so much guilt. I still feel bad for things when I was younger. It feels like crap. And when my anger got worse again it felt so terrible. Cause it was bad when I was 9 and 10. Those were terrible times and I feel bad for everything I did those years. I got better and then I feel like I’m back in that time all over again. Small things always pissed me off but now I swear it feels like I can’t even talk to people or I’m mad. I hate it."
depression,feofeg4,t1_feo8gq9,1579299426.0,What way

Sober,fel5m7j,t1_feke7pq,1579214563.0,Thanks and Ik I feel like she did but she’s alive. Ik she has overdosed on it and a lot of other stuff. Apparently 3/4 times was my fault that she attempted. It sucks cause I can’t remember what I said to make her attempt cause I have bad anger idk if I said that but when I’m mad I can’t remember what I say and it’s so scary. Especially that it has to do with drugs and all that. And I always was scared of any type of suicide since I found out like what my brother actually did.
Sober,fejgh0p,t1_feiy34q,1579173102.0,Yea she’s my ex now she didn’t do anything while we dated. And I agree everyone acts like weeds nothing. Like it’s just some energy drink from the store and likes it’s not a big deal. I’ve made my mom cry many times cause my mental state and because I used to sneak out to get high. But I’m doing a lot better and realize I shouldn’t of done that. I’ve made my brother cry the most tho since that’s how he started. He’s scared I’ll get worse Ig but in that way I’m doing better. And yea about the ex it kinda sucks cause no way to help her. Me and her aren’t close enough and felt like my fault that she did it. But she’s dating someone else who apparently made her not doing it as much.
ADHD,feikyot,t1_feiiae3,1579140954.0,ADHDs linked with a lot
ADHD,feikxq9,t1_feiiae3,1579140937.0,Yea everyone says they’re linked and searched it up just to learn more and a lot of things say it
Anger,feig2gr,t3_ep7ocl,1579137697.0,Aw I’m sorry break ups suck I went through one too. Especially when anger gets involved. Idk much ways to help but people just tell me to write things down and try therapy. Normally people also mention meds. Also I’d try to stop drinking. Drinking depresses me and makes me mad. When I do it I go crazy. Idk if you do it a lot I didn’t so didn’t take me a lot to stop. Especially since I hated being more depressed than I already was.
Sober,feifg95,t3_ep7dh0,1579137281.0,"Dude I’m so proud of you. I seen that it was weed and I was like I need to read this. I got very depressed when me and my ex broke up and I just needed something to keep me happy so I’d go to weed. And I felt like that’s all I had. Eventually I got addicted and felt like crap. But at the same time when I was upset (since my ex would call everything a baby drug cause she was on like heroin). I just felt like I deserved to be worse. I’m proud I didn’t tho. A lot is because I was traumatized from needles at a young age and also drugged so I was scared to do anything like that. My brother was also a bad addict. He’s doing good now. But he still has on and off relapses but not bad ones. Me and him were never close but I knew he was fucked and I was always scared to be like him. That sounds mean but it’s true cause he attempted a few times so in my head since I was little all I understood was he did drugs. And I’d get told he was sick cause don’t wanna twll a little kid that their brothers trying to die. But I’d just figure if I do deugs I’ll be like him and I’ll feel like him. I feel like that scared me and makes me so happy. Sorry I’m going on about myself even tho you’re much older I love that someone is openly posting about it. It makes me so happy to know I’m not alone even tho it isn’t a hard drug it still affects you. And I wish it didn’t but it makes me feel like I’m not stupid for wanting to stop. I am only a teenager so I do make a lot of stupid decisions and I’m trying to get better. Just wanna tell you, you can get through this. Ik it’s hard and it takes time. You might relapse but that’s fine. Just have to try again. I hope it goes well for you."
ADHD,feiecbe,t1_feie9d6,1579136531.0,Maybe I had meds for not even a year
ADHD,feidzxq,t1_fehtvwo,1579136301.0,Or do you think it could be cause my age. I’m 14.
ADHD,feidyk9,t1_feidumc,1579136276.0,No problem and I mean it not just trying to be nice
ADHD,feidst7,t1_fei9eyg,1579136168.0,I had ADHD first and also along with anger. I was in toxic environment and I had to leave my ex. I loved her and still love her more than anything. And I felt like I kept hurting everyone cause my anger got out of control. And then I’d get mire mad cause everyone would be like why are you acting like that and it was more often. And my mom was also very stressed so stressed her out. Yea a bunch of things happen so I got diagnosed with depression probably like a few months after.
ADHD,feidlz0,t1_fei8gmt,1579136038.0,Aw Ik it sucks. If you ever need to talk just reach out to me. I’m here.
ADHD,feidivy,t1_fehtvwo,1579135980.0,Weird I think mine probably is caused by more of my anger then. Plus I could get hyper to distract myself. I’ll talk to my therapist about it.
ADHD,feidfpu,t1_feht2si,1579135922.0,Yea I have help and I also have meds for ADHD and anger. They said they don’t want to give me anything for depression since it could be caused a lot by the other two things mainly anger. Cause I was in a toxic environment for a while and it messed me up completely especially my anger. And ig all the stress from that just made me go crazy. ADHD just adds to that and it’s very annoying and tiring.
ADHD,feid1id,t1_fei7np7,1579135657.0,"Thanks I do get help for depression, ADHD and I have anger so anger. I got depressed over stupid things people did to me but I wasn’t ever a positive person. Yea same sometimes I don’t wanna get out of bed to do anything. Everything just hurts. I feel empty but at the same time I always wanna yell and hit things, hurt myself and just cry all day. But I’m getting better hopefully."
depression,fehltri,t3_eoxun3,1579119161.0,I don’t think that’s what you want I think it’s that you’re scared to be happy cause you were depressed for so long. My brother had very bad depression and he was like that too. But he said it’s not that he wanted to constantly wanna be dead. He wanted to be happy. But he was scared to come out of that state cause he was in it for so long. Once you’re happy you’ll probably never wanna turn back.

Anger,fehb2m9,t1_fefpkeb,1579112884.0,Thanks and yea you’re right it is very hard. Took me a loooong time to get used to it I’m still not tbh. I just always tend to let out my feelings and tell people what’s wrong and that scares me. So could be a lot of the reason I felt pushed to do it. Even just writing in notes. Talking to people helps too. Sounds like it don’t but having someone you can tell your problems to and have them just listen is the best. Also I’d stick to therapy. At first I did the exact same thing. I was always in and out of it. Not sure if it’s helping I think I’m just getting over stuff that happened and that thing made my anger way worse and I’m finally getting back. But last night I seen something and had a very very bad anger attack. It’s annoying and it’s hard to stop. But all you can do is try and get better with time. It’s ok to go and scream in your truck sometimes but it’s good to have people to talk to. We all need to just let out stuff Ik i feel like your best bet would be having someone to talk to. That helps me Ofc there’s times where I really don’t wanna talk. But sometimes just gotta push yourself to do it. That’s hard too tho. It takes time get better and learn to control stuff but you got this. Once again I’m here if you ever need me.
rant,fefpvex,t3_eox9qx,1579061842.0,I wish she still loved me so I didn’t look as stupid
Anger,fefnqux,t3_eovtmn,1579060359.0,Man I can’t say much cause I’m learning to control mine as well. I’m just gonna say what people have told me. Get therapy which I have. Idk if it helps people say it do but idk if it’s that. Try and be more positive cause the more depressed or bad you feel more angry you feel. Ofc being positive is really hard especially on a bad day and when you feel like you have no control over yourself. But just generally being more positive does help. I’m not a positive person at all but when I’m being positive I realize there’s a whole change in my mood. Ofc it doesn’t always work but worth a try. And most people said try writing stuff down. Idk you so idk or if you like writing Ik I hated it. I have ADHD and I have trouble focusing when I’m writing or doing anything really. But I honestly found writing my feelings has helped a lot tho. Even just in notes. Idk if this is gonna help but I hope it does. Lmk if you ever need to talk.
Anger,fea28qv,t1_fe7t2xo,1578943625.0,I do the same thing and yea I lot of people told me I should start writing how I feel so that’s what I’ll start doing in like a journal or something thanks

Anger,fcks773,t1_fckkmb6,1577732047.0,Thanks yea it’s hard to get better. I have therapy and stuff I used to get mad at my mom Everytime she’s try to take me and I’d do everything go try and get out. But last month I finally decided to go. I go every week now and it’s helped a lot but I still get very angry and go insane. Idk it scares me looking back I got netter but just doesn’t feel like it. Maybe I’ll try to download that app I’ve heard of it seems pretty good.
Anger,fckbg6q,t1_fck6t7o,1577721540.0,Glad you think that cause it’s true. No one here’s a terrible person we just have a problem and that’s ok. We can get through this.
Anger,fcj75p5,t3_ehf8s3,1577678948.0,"Aw I’m so sorry. I feel so bad I can relate. I mentally abused mine cause we were forced to break up. Her mom abused me obviously that pissed me off. She did stuff and idk it just all made me so angry there was a point where I apparently said “how do you think your bf would feel about you doing heroin” cause she also got a new bf. Yk all that stress can piss you off. Idk whats going on around you or if anything is. But it’ll be ok. I’m here, I get hope it gets better. Ik it sucks feeling like you’re hurting someone you love more than anything. But none of it is your fault. Ik it feels like it but you can’t control it. It’ll be ok just need to try to find things to help it and learn to control it. And oh jeez trust me Ik that’s hard I can hardly calm myself to save my life. But I promise it helps. It helped me a lot, I still do say stupid things by accident to her but I’ve gotten better. It helps I promise takes a lot of work but it helps."
