Steel_Division,fes4rue,t3_eqfab6,1579361425.0,"I could have written the same exact post. I tjink that the game devs themselves are confused about the proper scale. Micromanaging single tanks, machinegun nests, an airplane and a 10 person squad while having to manage 3 battalions is insane. If the game supposed to be macro managed by smart orders than it's bad too since a - smart orders are not very smart and the AI just wastes your units with mass wave attaks and strange choice of defencive positions  b - you don't see the terrain and units with all it's beauty just some ant sized formations on a map. 
So like you I love the toy soldiers feel and the historical accuracy but the gameplay...
In wargame which also has its problems you can at least concentrate on attaking a sector with a manageable force. In SD2 you have the whole front with multiple objectives.
SD2 really feels like a game that should be played by multiple human players when each side has 2-3 players each controling a battalion. The scale for solo plays should be decreased in my opinion."

SSRIs,fe0gfke,t1_fdxl2qg,1578813031.0,That's great. I'm familiar with a lot of people that take both and in addition to that even benzodiazepines (according to need).

zen,fcx1f1l,t1_fcscsu7,1578046925.0,"No, because contemplating and exploring an emotion instead of repressing it allows you to bring it to the surface from the unconscious and get insight into the reasons for its appearance which will allow you to resolve it."

Mindfulness,fc0all9,t1_fc05jpj,1577285088.0,Second that. It may seem a bit shcezopfrenic but I found the practice of learning about Jung's archetypes and than let them speak their mind very useful. Its dramatizes and gives character to certain views and parts of your mind and let's you arbitrate between them consciously instead of repressing them.
