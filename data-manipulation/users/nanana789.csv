interesting,ffbrl5u,t3_esownk,1579779997.0,Thats actually very satisfying
aww,ffaao0j,t1_ffa7oy8,1579731174.0,That is so sad... that genuine breaks my heart... how can people not feel guilty about treating them that way...
shittyaquariums,ffaah2t,t3_eqo0kq,1579731063.0,Aww that is so sad..why don’t people do any research before getting a pet? I know I read so many online threads and a lot of encyclopaedia about my koi fish. Still some of them did get hurt because of my ignorance... But if I notice something different I immediately research it and see if I can help them. Why do people assume that frogs and fish etc don’t feel anything or something? My koi recognise me so that must at least mean that they’re actually quite smart.
shittyaquariums,ffa989h,t3_esbz5f,1579730351.0,"This is the second video on this sub I’ve seen of someone thinking a fucking bottle is suited as an aquarium. What is wrong with people, are they just that stupid and ignorant or do they just not care about their pets"
shittyaquariums,ffa944j,t3_es98vt,1579730287.0,Thanks so much for saving this fish! We need more people like you
shittyaquariums,ffa8vuw,t3_es2cxi,1579730159.0,I know one time at a shop there was this huge goldfish in a tiny glass bottle. It could only swim in circles. I was very young back then but I do remember just wanted to cuss at the woman working there. Poor fish. I read somewhere that if you put goldfish in a round tank or cilinder that their spines and organs would grow bended and they would die a painful death.

shittyaquariums,ffa7nya,t3_esapvc,1579729478.0,I saw a similar condition for a turtle on exotic lairs youtube. Luckily he took the turtle in and now it’s happily swimming outside in a big pond.
