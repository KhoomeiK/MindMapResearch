2meirl42meirl4meirl,ff3wos8,t1_fdi1bhw,1579550491.0,"Looking back, my life circumstances made me stop commuting via train/subway. I drive now, and don’t have to face the distress of wanting to jump in front of a train for those 10-15 minutes I’d be at the station. 

Instead, these days I get to face distress all day and night by with continued suicide idealization wherever I am.

So much for progress and hope for a better tomorrow, right ?"

Haven’t tried gabapentin, but seroquel was awful - one of the worst meds I’ve ever taken. It sedated me 24x7, basically slept all day and gained a ton of weight."

therapy,fc4hru6,t3_eg5h0r,1577417031.0,"I've struggled and struggle with this as well. But over time, I've come to understand that a therapist's office is one of the safest spaces where you can speak your mind without worrying about what your saying and how it makes you look. If you haven't had much luck with that in your attempts, maybe communicate that to your therapist, either by writing it down on paper and handing it to him/her, or sharing it in the beginning of the session. Perhaps there's something they can do you make you feel comfortable and at ease with sharing."
