ThatsInsane,ffavjju,t1_ffalq8f,1579745478.0,I’ve seen a pair wandering in a park in LA that were the size of a German shepherd. I’m certain they were coyotes and not random dogs. In the eastern part of the country many coyotes are actually coywolves (coyote/wolf hybrids) which can get really large
ThatsInsane,ffauyra,t1_ffaguhk,1579745095.0,"So European colonists are to blame for India’s out of control population growth and them destroying their forests? 
Also, in North America at least, deer are plentiful and in many areas need to be hunted to keep populations down. There are more deer alive in NA now than at any other point in recorded history. So I wouldn’t say the wolves here are starving. More like they are opportunistic and if they see something they think they can eat they will attack it."
trashy,ff6wicp,t1_ff5gk7s,1579636330.0,"No she didnt throw a punch. But to answer your question why lots of people settle things using the police it’s because a physical confrontation at best can land you a night in jail, at worst a lot more."
AskReddit,ff6q8e0,t1_ff6bsf6,1579632607.0,I’m so sorry.
AskReddit,ff6okok,t1_ff61q82,1579631612.0,"Medical malpractice. Happened to my mom after a surgery where she had severe scarring on her scalp and lost a lot of hair. This was I think a facelift she got, in the early 2000s. No lawyer if I can recall correctly would take her case against the doctor/medical practice even though she wasn’t the only person who experienced malpractice there. Fortunately I worked in a salon at the time and got her some really nice hair regrowth shampoo/conditioner and vitamins (Nioxin in case anyone’s wondering) and she looks normal now, but I can’t imagine what she went through for 2 solid years. She never got justice from that situation."
trashy,ff5ckwg,t1_ff4rdcq,1579587338.0,Sidewalks are public. And yes what she did was theft/assault.
trashy,ff5ci95,t1_ff4gwi6,1579587259.0,Because just throwing punches here will land you in jail with charges.
trashy,ff5cgn9,t1_ff4kfsm,1579587212.0,"Legally, as long as the protestors are on public property they are protected by the right to assembly. What this bitch did amounts to assault. Absolutely she should be held accountable."
unpopularopinion,ff3onus,t1_ff32dr9,1579545549.0,Doesn’t make it ok. The child isn’t entitled to support from a man who isn’t his father any more than the mother is.
news,ff2w3tc,t1_ff1y7m0,1579526386.0,"These campsites are literally infested with diseases. In SoCal we have had hepatitis outbreaks amongst these camps so bad two major cities had workers in hazmat suits spraying the streets near them with bleach. Police officers dealing with vagrants/encampments have contracted both typhus and typhoid fever. There is real talk of bubonic plague making a comeback and these encampments would be ground zero due to the rat infestations they are synonymous with. This isn’t even talking about the myriad other diseases/illnesses like cold, flu, etc or the dangers of the needles themselves (HIV, AIDS)."
news,ff2vnl3,t1_ff2fecv,1579525916.0,Los Angeles here. The homeless situation on the entire west coast is so grim many would not believe it unless they saw it first hand. Seriously talking 3rd world/ medieval conditions. While I have sympathy for them I really really hate watching them destroy my once beautiful city.
news,ff2uvym,t1_ff2ujp4,1579525099.0,"It’s a fairly easy assumption to make given that statistically most homeless have drug/mental health problems. Not saying this man in particular did. There was probably a language barrier assuming he didn’t know any English, but the likeliest reason a homeless person might pass out to the point of not knowing they are being lifted into a garbage truck would be drugs or alcohol. I live in Los Angeles and we have literally tens of thousands of homeless people in tents here. It’s a sad sight to see."
Wellthatsucks,ff2tvkx,t1_ff2lmlq,1579523960.0,Same here.
castiron,ff094b9,t3_eqz0wd,1579466529.0,I have one too! I inherited it from my mom but it was her moms. Who knows how old it is. These things are treasures. None of my housemates knew what mine was for (also tortillas)
aww,fezwlvp,t1_fexhxvy,1579462610.0,The lemons are actually pretty sweet! A housemate of mine baked some into a pie and it was heaven. I’ll eat them raw though.
aww,fezvx8l,t1_fey2m2e,1579462351.0,"No, it’s in my yard. It’s nowhere near the pipes. The house I rent at is over 100 years old. This is a decently sized tree. I think it just has good enough conditions that it survives. One year half of it died and it only produced tiny lemons with little juice. This year and the year before last it’s grown some massive ones (but they are all far too high up in the canopy for me to reach for the most part)"
aww,fewnpou,t1_fewl6jt,1579416028.0,I just picked one off my backyard tree and I could hardly hold it in my hand. It was grapefruit sized. This is in downtown Los Angeles. I’m convinced the tree grows out of spite because it’s literally growing through cement and is completely ignored aside from rare trimming/pruning.
PublicFreakout,fen9u0w,t1_fek674r,1579280098.0,The theft in that city now compared to when I lived there ten years ago (mind you- I grew up there) is insane. I think it’s got the worst car theft rates in the country these days.
PublicFreakout,fejyv7s,t1_feih9ov,1579188968.0,Haha I’m originally from there and I noticed the yellow house and the sandias and instantly knew. Plus with all the theft there now
blursedimages,fe0445a,t1_fdyasfk,1578802594.0,It’s not too uncommon. I have a thumb like this. Fun fact: they used to be called murderers thumbs
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdsfdew,t1_fds5oy2,1578701480.0,Not exactly. Taiwan saved lots of Chinese art during their Cultural Revolution that was intended to be destroyed. Now China wants it back. But since China was going to destroy it anyway I don’t think they deserve to have it back.
AskReddit,fdpveye,t1_fdp22qu,1578642092.0,I’m a registered Democrat who lately has been finding myself agreeing more with the republicans than the radicalized left. The only real issue I have with trump is his lack of environmental policy. I completely support him otherwise. Do you have any information for me I may be missing?
AskReddit,fdljx66,t1_fde34zr,1578525694.0,"San Diego has better Baja-style Mexican food. LA has better everything else, especially Oaxacan."
AskReddit,fdlin2b,t1_fddb6si,1578524846.0,I’m really curious to see how they’ve altered the menu to foreign tastes. Does this place have a website?

LosAngeles,fdkmwju,t1_fdkiexz,1578506880.0,This is it. I’m a 118 lb woman who relies on public transit daily. I carry pepper spray with me anytime I’m on the train especially after 10pm. Although to be honest I’m more freaked out by the walk to/from the station than I am of the actual subway.
Cooking,fdhxk8z,t1_fdgwkhn,1578431981.0,"Here’s the basic recipe I follow. I don’t believe it asks for HP sauce but I add it in mine anyway for a bit more of an “authentic” flavor

Cooking,fdhxco1,t1_fdfqrov,1578431868.0,I did not know that! Thank you
Cooking,fdhx7te,t1_fdgwkhn,1578431794.0,"It’s literally just a brown sauce called HP sauce. It’s a bit tangy. You can find it in the condiments isle of most grocery stores, they also sell it in the British section of international cuisine (if your store has that) You can also order it online."
Cooking,fdfbqfh,t1_fdfa12f,1578357938.0,"I sauté my mushrooms with shallots and deglaze with red wine, of course you don’t have to use the wine. Even a couple spoons of HP or Worcestershire sauce really bumps up the savory factor you might find yourself missing if you are used to beef. I use both wine and HP in mine. A-1 sauce is a decent substitute for HP if you don’t have any on hand"
aww,fdfbbgw,t3_ekzkdp,1578357664.0,It looks like a Furby
pics,fdejgkv,t1_fdef4j8,1578340325.0,"It is hard, but I promise, the cravings do go away. I haven’t craved meat in 20 years and there are a ton of great alternatives on the market now. When I started my meat-free life there were only about two options and they tasted like cardboard. Have you tried the Impossible burger yet?"
Cooking,fdeihxz,t3_ekvwmj,1578339743.0,"It’s awesome you are being supportive of your kiddo! I gave up meat at age 12 so my mom had the same dilemma you do. In our house we ate lots of Mexican, if you aren’t a fan of beans you can have rice instead :) cheese enchiladas and meat-less (meat substitute- I like the Morningstar Farms crumbles!) tacos. The same crumbles can be used to make sloppy joes! They are delicious! Most pasta dishes can be made without meat as well. A quick lunch favorite of mine are homemade pizza bagels (English muffin, sauce, mozzarella cheese throw it in the oven for ten mins, you can add pepperoni for your meat eating family if you want) 
Vegetarian shepherds pie is delicious, I use either the crumbles and/or sautéed mushrooms as my base. Tons of delicious soups and stews as well. I make a great one in the slow cooker with potatoes, carrots, onions and cabbage. You can buy vegetarian bouillon cubes for added flavor in sauces and soups. 

If any of these sound good to you let me know, I’m happy to share my recipes. I’ve been cooking meatless for 20 years now and while I’m no professional chef, I’ve gotten pretty good at it!"

Whatcouldgowrong,fcvc0le,t1_fcv78kj,1577998931.0,Black ice is something they don’t prepare you for in the desert Southwest. I lost control of my car and so did two other vehicles in front of me. Luckily nobody crashed into each other. It’s so sketchy.  But on the positive side they close the schools for like 2 inches of snow.

recipes,fcjdehq,t1_fchiixo,1577683762.0,"Also born and raised in NM. This very much is NM green chile stew, as long as there’s also beans or potatoes. Every family seems to have their own recipe and they can vary. 
I’m also vegetarian and my recipe seems to be pretty similar to this, mine is just beans (or potatoes), green chile, stewed tomatoes, and onion. 

Edit: I just read their actual recipe and you were right lol. Paprika and cumin? Bouillon? Not NM in the least."
Cooking,fcjatbp,t1_fcgw8b4,1577681615.0,"I make this dish. I’m from New Mexico and so the green chile is required. Basically you shred a bunch of corn (not flour) tortillas into little bits, layer them in a casserole dish, then pour the condensed soup, green chile and meat mixture in an even layer, more shredded tortillas, and repeat until the top layer (make sure you use tortillas only on the top layer, no soup mixture) and cover in cheddar cheese and bake it. When it’s done right it’s amazing. I’ve only ever heard of my mom making this dish before, so I’m curious where you are from? :)"
