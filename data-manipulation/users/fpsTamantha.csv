science,ffd6tru,t3_estvqu,1579814552.0,"Jesus no one actually read the article so I'll paraphrase it here.

>When espresso is very finely ground it randomly creates channels through the puck that get more heavily extracted. This means that some coffee sees a lot of water and is over-extracted, and some coffee sees little and is under-extracted. The key finding is that there is an ideal grain size that promotes uniform water flow. That grain size is larger than the common wisdom of blasting the coffee to dust. The randomness introduced by the small grain size not only creates waste, but leads to cup-to-cup variations.

Even if you don't care about saving coffee or think that Extractable Yield is a good or complete descriptor of quality, you should care the decline in cup to cup reproducibility associated with fine grinds."
science,ffd56pd,t1_ffcijek,1579813639.0,"You either didn't read the article or didn't understand it. The key finding is when espresso is ground too fine, the water randomly forms channels through the puck so there are areas of coffee that are exposed to way more water than others. This creates a drink that is over-extracted (more prone to bitterness), and leaves grounds that are under-extracted creating waste. If it was more coarsely ground, you could make the same drink with less coffee by promoting uniform flow through the puck.

Your criticism also doesn't really even reflect the current general understanding of coffee brewing. Caffeine is almost completely extracted early out of any reasonable grind size. How their findings jive with with real world practice are still unresolved, but your criticism with little explanation is baseless."
