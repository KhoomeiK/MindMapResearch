FAFSA,ff99skv,t1_ff68fwp,1579708108.0,"Exactly! I like to believe that there is free money for everyone who is willing to put enough effort in finding it! After all it's not hidden it's THERE, you just have to have someone to show it to you. Online search tools are great for that because they will show you the list of unique scholarships.

Btw I used to work for like two months in Oregon-Portland. I like the vibe of that place a lot."
FAFSA,ff67fqz,t3_erv1ru,1579620926.0,"If you are eligible It does cover Pell but the Perkins loan as someone already wrote has ended in 2017. 

You have other programs that you can apply to if you are looking for scholarships.. Try ScholarshipOwl website. It will give you a list of all scholarships you are eligible for based on your personal information.

Good luck!"
TooAfraidToAsk,ff673rs,t3_ertrnm,1579620702.0,"Like everything in life BALANCE is the key.

My parents are restaurant owners and I know for a fact that the employees working for tips will  have better results then the ones working for only a monthly salary. Look at it this way..

 If you have the same amount of money every month, why would you try harder or be better at your job ?  If you have bonuses or tips that are directly results of your work and how much you are working then you will try harder to be the best on your job. With that in mind owners will encourage you to be better with customer so that you can get more tips, which in the end works the best for both owner and an employee. 

Also, I don't think that it is ""kissing someone's ass"" (As someone wrote in the comments). Getting tips by being polite with good manners is just doing your job better. 

As I mentioned balance is the key.. So I don't believe that tipping should be an obligation but rather a conscious choice of a person to pay for the service that someone has provided to you."

I don't want to mock financial aid or anything I won the full ride scholarship using the ScholarshipOwl webiste and it help me get the education that I wanted. But, debt FREE, which was more important to me."

Baruch,fc2fn3f,t3_efs37e,1577357487.0,"I think that ""easy"" is not a great word to start with, when applying for scholarships.

Based on your personal information and you need every information in one place, you can try online search tool engines. Most of them are free and you can create a profile very quick.
