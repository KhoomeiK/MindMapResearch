selfimprovement,ffte32p,t1_ffl2ja0,1580217840.0,"I had the typical chopping my hair off phase and it did switch things up a bit and feel fun. Maybe I’ll try out a different style like you said, maybe it will have the same effect? Thanks for the reply by the way. It makes me happy to see people like you try to make the world a better place by offering advice like this."
AskReddit,ffk3arf,t3_etts4s,1580014494.0,"I always think about the times that I was genuinely happy, and I hold on to those memories in hopes that maybe one day things will be like that again. I also tell myself that if I can get through this, I can get through anything. And I want that kind of strength, I’ve always wanted to be able to tell someone one day that “I survived, and I’m here”. I haven’t lost hope for my future because I know what happiness feels like, and my imagination is probably the most important thing to me as fantasizing about my best self gives me hope."
selfimprovement,ffk2obn,t3_etvf6k,1580013942.0,"I find that when I surround myself with people nore often and go out even when I just want to lay in bed, my mood improves drastically. The way I look has always been a huge trigger for me too, and when I don’t look my best I get extremely depressed and I isolate myself, but when I look my best I’m extremely upbeat and social. I wish I could feel that way no matter how I look though."
