You can pay about $11K to get your pilot's license, and say $2500 to join and $100/mo then for each flight it's ballpark $60/flight hr and 9 gallons/hr and you can fly usually smaller Cessnas and Pipers.

Do you need a screen that folds out, because that's the only real difference?

If you were talking about professional gigs, the D7100 and D7200 might be nice because they have body focus motors so they ~~work~~ autofocus with older (cheaper/used) lens and they have two card slots, so you get instant backups.  Also, the manual focus light is a ""turn left, turn right or is in focus"" rather than just a single ""thing at focus point is in focus"" like the D3200 and D5600.  You can also get more frames-per-second with the D7000-series which matters in sports more than protraiture, but you can still put it on continuous high and catch momentary expressions if the person you're working with isn't a model.

Just remember when picking the lenses that unless you want to manually focus, you need to pick ones with internal focus motors.

edit: ""work"" was a bad choice of words because you can mount and shoot (and usually meter) most lenses on most cameras (not AF-P on some older bodies), but won't get autofocus with lenses with no motors on cameras with no motors."

For example, you can say a signature isn't autopenned because it's not a consistent pressure; but you can't say it's autopenned because it has a consistent pressure.  But, also autopens miss and mess up a fair amount and for instance may miss the entire dot of an i.  People also make several templates of slightly different signatures to do a run sometimes.
