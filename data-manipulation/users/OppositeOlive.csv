It is $25 to buy (which is expensive but airing seasons are always expensive). Or you can choose to pay $1.99 per epsiode as it airs (which you will end up spending more than just buying the season upfront). 

Or you can check if TLC has a subscription service option. I'm pretty sure it doesn't but you can check."
college,ff9vi4o,t3_esbzv9,1579722400.0,"I think sometimes people view having free time as a negative part of life. Like if you're always busy it means you're successful with friends, work/school and extra hobbies. When in reality that can be exhausting and wear you out. I think maybe you should start trying to look at free time in a different light? As time to do what you like; whether it's reading or Netflix or anything really. It seems you have a full rounded schedule so try not to push yourself to far"
college,fesm12w,t1_fembnyf,1579366657.0,"I'm not sure what consequences if any that he faced. The professor was pretty amazing with talking him down from the situation. He had obvious mental issues that played a key role in all his behaviors. I can't picture that if he pulls anything like that again he will be allowed to still attend. I wonder what will happen to him and if he was actually able to withstand the university environment. 

Wow that sounds extremely inappropriate! I'm shocked with how your dean handled that situation (or lack off). It is definitely a red flag if someone would need to hide a game they were playing for a class"
college,fem8l9h,t3_eps7yi,1579243720.0,"Last semester I had a similar weird kid sit next to me and I hated it. He would also mutter things that he thought no one could hear. Like calling the professor an ugly idiot. The worse thing he did was threaten to stab the professor with a pen and then ran up and pretty much cornered him with a pen withdrawn. 

What I got from that experience was that if you feel a fellow student is acting inappropriately that is taking away from your education and/or making you feel your safety is at least you should reach out to the dean of students."
college,fdjicuz,t3_ellmuf,1578472158.0,I agree! I have both lived on campus and now commute 10 minutes. I feel living on campus was bad for my mental health and I was just not one for the whole big college experience. My student life is a big part of my life but it's everything to me at all. Like I do not relate at all to the tons of posts about missing college and about people hardly able to wait to get back. I have so much more in life that it was just nice to be able to step back for classes for a bit. Commuting is a much healthier step up for some individuals.

I have since learned to not eat in this parking lot."
NintendoSwitch,fcayv4d,t1_fcavnuw,1577579337.0,Thanks! I have heard of this one and think it's a good fit. I am planning on getting it.
miniatures,fcayqoq,t1_fcax0p2,1577579268.0,Thank you so much! This is extremely helpful!
miniatures,fca6vrs,t3_egm7my,1577563940.0,So pretty! Thanks for sharing your album! I love looking at all everyone's miniatures. I just got my first one for Christmas and am wondering what glue to buy? Anything else that I might need?
NintendoSwitch,fc8zshn,t3_egpjw1,1577544731.0,"Recommendations please!

Hi all!

I just bought the switch and am lost about what games will suit me. I have never been much of a gamer (the only thing I have played a lot is the sims on PC and some Mario kart on d3s and wii). I really want to get mario kart but other than that am open to ideas! Note I don't think I'll like games like pokemon (not that i don't like pokemon) and such. With games where you have to find things and have conquests, i am always just googling how to complete them (i find it's not very fun but i cant help it). 

All input and ideas welcome!"
college,fb9qe9h,t1_fb8djsu,1576646150.0,I had people basically tear me apart (not on here but a college message board) when I asked for advice on financial aid after mentioning my extremely low gpa. It was horrible and made me feel like i couldn't do it. Seriously screw everyone who discourage people from going back to school.
