I don't know your background, but since you're interested, I think the Proof-of-Burn paper is readable without enormous effort (excluding the appendix), so you could give it a shot and see if you can follow it. For some of the rest, there's some accessible resources [over here](https://nipopows.com/)."
todayilearned,feo0xdi,t1_femv8fc,1579293590.0,"I'm working on decentralized blockchain interoperability protocols for proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. In particular, I'm focused on bag-of-block methods utilizing superblocks to construct [Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/963.pdf)."
todayilearned,feo0f1g,t1_femvllg,1579293479.0,"Thank you very much for your comment and appreciation! :)

It does mean a lot and makes me feel better. It's useful to put things in perspective sometimes, especially these weeks that I'm deep into writing my thesis and it's easy to forget the broader context when you're focused on a particular topic.

One thing I noticed during my degree is that the more I learn and the more I work, the more I realize how little I know and how even less I used to know. Just because there's so much out there and always more to study."
todayilearned,fenzcgq,t1_fenypuj,1579293010.0,"No, even though it's a famous tool in the field. I understand the mathematics of its cryptography (RSA, DSA, AES, hash functions), but not the full protocol. The actual implementation down to the last details and file formats is quite complicated from an engineering point of view."
todayilearned,fenyvom,t1_femwzvx,1579292825.0,"Sure, I'll be happy to! I developed protocols that allow different blockchain systems to talk to one another (blockchain interoperability) in a decentralized manner. This is useful because different blockchains may support different features such as trade-offs between performance and security. My protocols allow people to take a coin, say a Bitcoin, that lives on one blockchain, say the Bitcoin blockchain, move it to another blockchain, say the Ethereum blockchain, while it retains its nature (it never stops being a Bitcoin), then bring it back to Bitcoin blockchain. While it's on the Ethereum blockchain, it enjoys the pros and cons of Ethereum (different speed and security, more features).

In particular, I developed the primitive NIPoPoWs ([Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/963.pdf)) which is a method one can use to ""compress"" a blockchain to a short string. The instantiation of this primitive captures all the proof-of-work that has been done but without presenting all the block headers, creating a chain (or ""proof"") which is representative of the original chain but only polylogarithmic in length (an exponential improvement). My method is without a trusted setup. I've developed similar constructions for stake ([Proof-of-Stake Sidechains](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1239.pdf)) and worked on using these for blockchain communication, either one-way ([Proof-of-Burn](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1096.pdf)) or bidirectionally using smart contracts ([Proof-of-Work Sidechains](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1048.pdf)).

My work also has applications to fast synchronization of so-called ""superlight"" blockchain clients, mobile clients that can boot really quickly even the first time they run, as well as exponentially improved storage requirements for miners (""logspace mining"")."
todayilearned,femrhat,t1_femhz48,1579267500.0,"To be fair, I'm finishing my PhD these months (in cryptography) and I'd say there's maybe 10 people who fully understand what I'm doing, but that's far from making me a genius. It's just that there's a lot of specialization and there's a lot of time needed to develop expertise when the topic is niche; most people really aren't going to devote that amount of time to understand something that they don't consider very useful or interesting. I think that's the case with most PhDs nowadays.

Additionally, being able to write your thesis in a manner that is interesting and understandable to a wider audience, while exploring a niche topic, is an art in and of itself. The lack of understanding of others is then just an indication of your inability to communicate effectively.

That being said, Kaczynski probably _was_ a genius after all."

When a rich house would have oranges and they'd throw away the peels in their garden, the poor kids would pick it up and eat it, giving them some of the orange taste! It was a delicacy for them. My grandpa included."
