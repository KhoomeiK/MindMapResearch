AskMen,ff8b2mp,t1_ff7drji,1579671467.0,I may be small but I definitely take stance!
selfimprovement,feuqm4c,t3_eqe792,1579389017.0,"Yes exactly! I’m naturally a people pleaser, and now that I’ve started to put my own needs/wants first some people in my life seem a little shocked. Good luck to you too!"
selfimprovement,fet3j9m,t1_feqtkul,1579371470.0,Perfect analogy!
selfimprovement,fet2y6y,t1_fern7m9,1579371319.0,"Not pretentious at all thank you!

I’m naturally a people pleaser and I’ve noticed that some people in my life are so taken aback when I actually stand up for the way I feel/do the things I want rather than going with the flow"
selfimprovement,fet2g54,t1_fes9iqm,1579371217.0,Love these quotes! Thank you!

dating,fdj1kg7,t1_fdj193l,1578456078.0,"We haven’t had sex yet, so it isn’t about his dick but I definitely agree that her feelings are valid and I’m choosing to respect them. I know it’ll eventually be fine and I’ll get over it but it’s still fresh and I’ll admit I’m still a little upset about it

(Edit): this is the mature and rational advice I needed, thank you"
dating,fdj1a53,t1_fdj14a9,1578455880.0,She says she thinks we aren’t compatible. Either way I’m only 20 and marriage is really not even on my mind
dating,fdj0ujl,t1_fdj0s6p,1578455580.0,"She says relationships either end in marriage, or one person hurting the other. And the odds of the first are slim"
dating,fdj0mjh,t1_fdj0fl3,1578455421.0,"Well that’s her conclusion not mine. 

She thinks it will inevitably result in us ending things, which she thinks will cause drama/make things away between us.

But I honestly am not one to cause drama or hold grudges and feel that even if we were to end things, we could still be around each other without things being uncomfortable."
dating,fdj04ea,t1_fdizqlj,1578455070.0,"She thinks that we’re not compatible and that it will result in him and I ending things, which she feels will make it awkward between us. 

I don’t want to sacrifice the relationship but I’m honestly not sure what the right thing to do is.

Letting a guy come between you and a friend isn’t the answer, right? (Genuine question)"
dating,fdizkxu,t1_fdiyy9y,1578454699.0,She and I were friends before we moved in together and we’ve gotten pretty close since. I just don’t want to upset or disrespect her but I’m still sad lol
dating,fdiyo74,t1_fdiy43q,1578454075.0,"He’s my roommate’s brother and even though she originally said she was cool with us dating, now she’s saying she isn’t 

Sorry I wasn’t very clear!"

self,fc64y98,t3_eg6n8z,1577472374.0,"Yes, I feel like a pure and clean lil goddess."
AskWomen,fbx6bv7,t1_fbwfps3,1577171256.0,"I definitely agree with this! 

Love not having to leave my apartment and being able to go straight to bed after. The boys buy the alcohol as payment and my roommate and I are glad to host!"
