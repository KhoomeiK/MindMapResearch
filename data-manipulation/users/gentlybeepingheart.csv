bestoflegaladvice,fgiy1bt,t1_fgitrfh,1580833293.0,Last time I got drunk I just ended up sobbing into my cat's fur because I loved him so much. This is only slightly different from my sober reaction to my cat doing anything.

Iamactuallyverybadass,fgid95m,t1_fgibzs8,1580817604.0,He actually didn't want any help with the surgery itself. He had them hand him the tools and gave them instructions to inject him with adrenaline if he passed out. Other than that they couldn't do anything.
SubredditDrama,fgh2jpn,t1_fgfops6,1580775167.0,Sort of in her defense: Eric wasn't the only reason. We're shown her interest when she sings *Part Of Your World* before she even meets him. She was a teenage girl who felt trapped by her life as a princess and Eric was a way to help her escape.
moviescirclejerk,fggkg9w,t1_fgfpe6c,1580763730.0,Really liked how they portrayed imaginary Hitler. Started off as a goofy joke and then by the end gets more and more unhinged the more Jojo realizes the propaganda he's been fed is wrong. By the end he's straight up mimicking real Hitler's speeches.
worldnews,fgfqjo7,t1_fgfq5wp,1580745348.0,Religious extremism *is* a far right ideology lmao
BoJackHorseman,fg7ts0t,t1_fg5klmx,1580601268.0,The fact that he still considers Bojack his friend after every single thing Bojack has done is really sort of heartwarming.
BoJackHorseman,fg7ogsq,t1_fg5rj6p,1580597489.0,"There's also the scene where Sharona is doing her hair in Bojack's dressing room because her stepdad is in her room acting ""weird"""
BoJackHorseman,fg7nnno,t1_fg6g41z,1580596924.0,"""Life's a bitch, and you keep living."""
BoJackHorseman,fg7nhrl,t1_fg703az,1580596806.0,"I really liked that line, for some reason. The idea that sometimes it's not going to end up with a big event or dramatic finale. Sometimes stuff happens and then it just...keeps happening."
BoJackHorseman,fg7kzx8,t1_fg6wo2n,1580595066.0,"Yeah, as someone who attempted suicide in the past it was fucking heart wrenching."
BoJackHorseman,fg7kf49,t3_ewl6mf,1580594662.0,"Everyone was theorizing since season 1 that that painting of Bojack in the pool was foreshadowing but it still hit me like a fucking truck when he said his water tasted like chlorine and I realized what, exactly, was happening."
BoJackHorseman,fg7efu3,t1_fg7dsye,1580590512.0,That's preposterous. Vincent Adultman is a grown up adult man and that was a child.
BoJackHorseman,fg7bx2r,t1_fg6k87j,1580588806.0,So far that revelation is the one that hit me the hardest in this season. The fact that Bojack knew she died in the hospital the whole time.
SubredditDrama,fg424pp,t1_fg3pdmb,1580494570.0,I swear I think of Magic the Gathering every time I see the acronym. I'm not even into MTG. Throws me off every time lol
SubredditDrama,fg41fd3,t1_fg3wc3o,1580494144.0,"It is. And their sidebar has ""Quarantined our community, but we are still going our own way."" in the description. I'm surprised it's lasted this long."
SubredditDrama,fg41al7,t1_fg3ih3z,1580494063.0,">Quarantined our community, but we are still going our own way.

lmao did they serious admit to their sub being a quarantine evasion right on in the sidebar. very big brains over there."
