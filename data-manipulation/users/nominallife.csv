In fact, propranolol could take the anxiety edge off for OP, so he's comfortable to engage in exposure therapy.

It enables a person to maintain engagement without anxiety overpowering the individual, allowing them to withstand the situation long enough to condition themselves to realize it's safe."
StopGaming,ffdm306,t3_et0o2r,1579823775.0,"I quit gaming without quitting gaming media several times, particularly following professional gaming matches. Both media and match watching eventually enticed relapses.

If manage to abstain from playing while digesting media, great. If not, it's probably best to abstain from all gaming content.

As far as figuring out what to fill your time with, go explore and try new things until something sticks."

stopdrinking,fdfu2d0,t3_el4luv,1578370226.0,"Good job. 

I'm in a similar boat. Decided to completely quit alcohol and the major problem area came from sneaking drinks while the family wasn't around. Volunteer to take the kids to extracurricular activities after school, so that the wife picks them up. This enabled me drop off the kids and pick up something on the way home. Then when the wife went to pick up the children, I'd have about 30 minutes to drink.

Kinda sad looking back on it."

AdultChildren,fcopnhd,t3_ei8h0t,1577838241.0,"All of these strike home except for 13, yikes.

It's odd how these similar experiences in our youth impact us similarly into adulthood. As sad as this is, it's also a relief to understand that these ""shortcomings"" aren't the result of ourselves, but the forces we had no control over. When we escape those negative forces and begin to realize that we CAN improve, positive change can start to unfold. This is assuming that we haven't allowed ourselves to fall into the same pit of endless despair that our parent(s) became entangled with.

To clarify 13, I'd say that I have a strong potential to become an alcoholic, but my addictive tendencies grasped video games instead--thankfully. A less destructive habit, but still a destructive habit if not moderated."

depression,fcklcgz,t3_ehg7l8,1577727835.0,"Yep, this decade started off great and descended into depression and anxiety. Took a risk on a career change and it ended miserably. Lead to a decade of unemployment and failure, then subsequent depression and anxiety. Lost 10 years in a flash. Insane to think about.

I'm not hoping for a better 2020, I'm actively recovering from my depression and working toward making the upcoming decade my best. 

Good luck to everyone in their own unique battles."
AdultChildren,fc0hq1e,t3_effxls,1577291094.0,"After decades of reading self-help topics and philosophy to figure out why I turned out the way I did and to try to find a meaningful purpose in my life; I realized a lot of what I was reading was great advice, but, I was terrible at putting it into practice.

I finally hit a low enough point in my life where I was extremely depressed and miserable in a seriously untenable, self-destructive sort of way. If I continued to be fatalistic and not try to improve my mental well-being, I wouldn't have lived for much longer. I decided to forgive myself. It seems cheesy saying that you forgive yourself, but I'll try to explain my perspective. 

I couldn't control my childhood and to some extent the residual effects that carried into adulthood due to never learning healthy coping mechanisms for processing what happened. It took me a LONG time to simply figure out that my childhood was not healthy. The volatility my parents injected into my life through a mix of abuse and isolationism wasn't in my power to control. I missed a substantial number of developmental milestones people generally receive from caring parents and this really can have devastating effects on your life, it did for me.

I blamed my failures and shortcomings completely on myself. I was often blamed for everything going wrong in my parents lives and after awhile you genuinely start to internalize it. I hated myself. I constantly compared myself to successful people who seemed to have it altogether who grew up in supportive, caring families. I did this because I was ignorant to the MASSIVE disadvantages imposed on me and the MASSIVE advantages this provides to people with healthy and supportive families. After figuring out how severely flawed this form of thinking was I altered my thinking.

From now on, instead of comparing myself to everyone around me, I compare myself to who I was yesterday. Am I a better version of me today relative to yesterday? Yes, great, keep doing you! No, what happened and can it be improved upon? 

The combination of forgiving myself for the stuff I couldn't control and developing a healthier way to perceive myself is producing positive results. If it starts to falter, I'll stop myself before I get caught up in a negative feedback loop and diagnose the problem as objectively as possible to help facilitate a new solution for a temporary setback."
