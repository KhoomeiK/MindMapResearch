Cruise,ffeknd9,t3_esrt6i,1579852025.0,My personal best was St Thomas. My first cruise. You wake up and you’re pulling in to an island. Mountains in the water all around. Looks like Fantasy Island. Go to Meghan’s Bay. Most gorgeous beach in the world. Great day. Tortolla was the same. Great places.
EnoughTrumpSpam,ffegpcj,t3_et0tav,1579847324.0,Why did he leave? Did he not take his oath seriously? should be the first question anyone asks him for the next ten years. His great grandchildren should ask him that.

So some people do their purchases through the year on the NCL credit card and then use the points on the cruise. I donâ€™t know why you wouldnâ€™t just use that balance to pay for the cruise. Maybe they paid the cruise balance earlier. Iâ€™m not sure if they give you 3% on cruise cash purchases. I think thatâ€™s what they give for cruises but how many of those do you buy a year? 

Personally, the NCL card has a pretty lousy program. You can do a lot better with other cash back cards."
