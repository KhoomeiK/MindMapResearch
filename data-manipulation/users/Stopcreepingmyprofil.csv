No worries there, I think you'll find their extensive security detail will be paid for by the taxpayers of Canada. Harry is still a royal, the government here will be responsible for them."
gifs,ffro0f9,t1_ffr95iv,1580162022.0,"You don't sound like you know or understand much about wildlife or the north. Why bother making such confident and incorrect statements and then keep arguing them after being corrected?

It makes you look kind of fucking stupid, tbh."
EarthPorn,ffqzukz,t1_ffpzleg,1580147354.0,It's really strange that you collected downvotes for answering a question in a straight manner. This place is weird

You're a good man, anon. 4chan would still be one of the more interesting places on the internet if more anons had done the same.

I think the influx of people on/after the last US election overwhelmed the site and finally killed the culture, more or less. Too many people all at once, killed by popularity."
