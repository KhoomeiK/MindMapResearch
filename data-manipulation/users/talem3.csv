fatlogic,fdsn14c,t3_emyjd5,1578705353.0,"I can’t believe they actually compared dieting to famine... i’m actually at a loss for words. These people are so fucking privileged that they have to make up shit to be offended about and then have the audacity to compare eating a normal amount of calories to starvation?? There are actual starving people in the world, as in people who don’t eat for days (not hours like these idiots) and they’re mad because they can’t eat a cheeseburger in public w/o getting looked at?? It’s unbelievable"
