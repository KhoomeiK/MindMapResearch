getdisciplined,ff4tccp,t1_ff4ptgi,1579571960.0,"It has to do with a couple of things:

- Growth mindset vs fixed mindset 
- Things like grit, embracing adversity, not giving up, etc.

Growth mindset just means you believe you can get better. It sounds simple but people hold limiting beliefs and think limiting thoughts all day long, and growth mindset is about observing those things in yourself and identifying those beliefs you didn’t even know you had that need to change. Like people will say, “I’m not a math person”, when they should say, “I could get better at math, but it would be a lot of work and it’s not important to me”. The difference between “I can’t” and “I could but I choose not to” is night and day. “I can’t” means you believe it’s impossible, so it’s a guarantee you’re not even going to attempt it, and it reinforces all kinds of other negative mindsets like being a victim. Even if you are a victim, it’s not helpful to have a victim mindset.

Grit and adversity are just doing hard things, often failing, not giving up, and trying again. And again, you don’t tie your self esteem to succeeding at those hard things. You just tell yourself, “I’m the kind of person that does hard things”, and you build your self esteem and confidence around your choice to face hard things, struggle with them, fail at them, and decide you won’t give up. This is why things like exercise and meditation can be so powerful. Exercise is especially powerful because it hits on multiple things, it’s hard, and it has tangible visible benefits if you stick with it, and that can be a powerful virtuous cycle of self-reinforcement. Meditation is hard, it’s almost impossible to sit with an empty mind for long, and in my case I use guided meditations that really make this clear. The guide will give you like 60 seconds of silence, and I’m like, yeah that’s easy I can focus for 60 seconds. Then after 60 seconds he chimes back in, “if your mind started to wander, just bring your focus back to the breath and begin again”, and every time I’m like, “Dang it! I thought I was focusing but I was actually thinking about those tacos I had during our road trip 2 summers ago!”. Meditation is just practice at failing constantly and starting again, and it helps you to notice yourself a little better, which helps with catching those limiting self beliefs you don’t even realize you have.

If you want more of this check out Tom Bilyeu and Ben Bergeron. They both have podcasts. Ben has a book, and Tom has a book list that’s great. They both go way deep on mindset, and would agree it’s the foundation you build other things upon. I’d say Ben gets more into specifics of individual topics like confidence, discipline, and so on."
getdisciplined,ff3qmy6,t3_er9ldo,1579546751.0,"> Self-confidence is not a requirement for success, it is the reward we get once we’ve succeeded despite our fears. It comes as a result of successfully pushing through our discomfort.

You are spot on about fear and courage. Unless you are in danger of physical harm, you should move boldly forward and courageously face life head on.

Confidence, however, needs specific clarification around how it is built.

There is this success equation: **E + R = O**

E + R = O is: **External events + Response = Outcomes**

Durable confidence is based on things within your control. External events and outcomes are not within your control. The only things within your control are responses, and maybe your effort.

Fragile confidence can be built up by a string of successful outcomes, but it is useless. If you are the best athlete in your city, you could build up quite a large amount of confidence after years of dominating everyone you face. But this is fragile and eventually detrimental. When you face more talented athletes, your confidence based on outcomes will be shattered. This is all completely out of your control and unsustainable.

Durable confidence is based around controlling your responses, and giving your best effort. It is not easily broken. Durable confidence is the ability to maintain your character despite any external events or unfavorable outcomes you face. When you can maintain your character in the face of unfavorable outcomes and unexpected external events, because you've tied your definition of ""winning"" and ""losing"" to your ability to control your response and to your level of effort, that's confidence. That's the confidence we see in others and admire, and should aspire for. Those people move confidently into uncertain and scary circumstances not because they know they will win, but because they know they are competent at controlling their response and giving their best effort, and they know that's all they can control, so whatever the outcome, they know their best is enough."
Forex,ferrgx5,t3_eqayau,1579357507.0,"There are no good indicators. Only good interpretations of indicators within specific setups.

It doesn’t matter that much what indicator you pick. It matters far more how much screen time you get looking at how the indicator behaves when price shows a specific setup.

You will make progress much faster if you stop looking for the right indicator, and instead just pick any random indicator, pick any random setup, and look at 1000 chart examples of that setup to see how the indicator behaves.

As an example, pick a 50 EMA as the indicator and flag patterns as the setup, and figure out how to zoom into the right timeframe, and after you look at a ton of charts, the 50 EMA in flag setups will be a tool you can use. Maybe it’s not the final system, and maybe you’ll need a dozen other tools to build something robust, but that’s how you can make progress with indicators and how TA can be useful.

All of the value comes from you doing the work. That’s why most people say TA doesn’t work. They are lazy. They read a book and look at 3 charts and conclude it doesn’t work, and well, of course that’s not going to work (but the problem isn’t with the book or the indicator in that case)."

Forex,felnz3t,t3_epite9,1579226731.0,"There is a paradox here.

There are always setups forming in both directions. This is true for Elliott Waves and Fibonacci.

Using these methods, a successful trade in one direction is often a failed trade in the opposing direction using the same method.

That is the paradox, which if you can learn to navigate it, you will find Elliott waves can be a potent tool.

Elliott Waves are subjective, as some like to point out. Some mistakenly believe this subjectivity is proof that Elliott Waves do not work. Well, sort of. They don’t “work”. But, if you can put some objective measures around them, they can be a powerful map-building tool. If you have the map, you can think through how to strategically navigate the terrain to extract the most profit relative to the risk, on average.

You must have a way to analyze a chart objectively and consistently, where if you analyzed the same chart twice you would produce the same assessment. You need ways to know what timeframe to analyze a wave setup, what particular indicators look like under different wave regimes, how far waves retrace and extend, relationships of the durations of waves, and things like this. If you have that sorted out, then you can look at a chart and know straight away, “this timeframe is too high, I need to drill down to a lower timeframe to analyze these waves clearly”. Just getting the timeframe right gets you a lot of way there in EW trading. Tools like Tradingview or TC2000 help significantly here, where you can specify odd timeframes like 78 minute bars or 3 day bars or whatever number you need to bring the wave into focus.

To your question, two opposing setups on different timeframes are two different trades. You could take them both. The key is to recognize both, where each might take price, so that as one setup plays out, it does not sabotage the other.

In fact, this is a very useful method of analysis, to look at all of the possible opposing setups and recognize the levels they might touch. At some points you will see that there are no more opposing setups in play, at least none relevant to the trade you are considering. For instance, if you see that a fib extension is setting up in the opposite direction to your trade, and that extension level would take out your stop, you may choose to postpone entry until later. But later, you notice that the extension levels have changed, and now it would not go further than your stop loss. If those levels still permit you enter a trade with good reward:risk ratio, those tend to be great trades."

Forex,feckhpg,t3_eo52kc,1578976127.0,"Try analyzing your trades in the context of setups.

A setup might be, price makes a strong move then pulls back, now see what your indicators do after that. Find a ton of the same setups, categorize the setups into wins and losses, then look at all of the winners, and see what they have in common, and do the same for the losers.

If you can put metrics around your setups that’s even better, like you’ll need a way to dial into the right time frame chart, since your indicators will say very different things if you are on the wrong timeframe. In other words, use indicators to define your setup objectively. Like how many bars are in the strong moves up, and in the pullback? How much pullback do the winners have vs the losers? Stuff like that.

When you first start trading you explore and see what’s out there and try everything. But at some point you have to pick one thing that seems to work a little bit, or something that is obsessively interesting to you, and have the grit and determination to stick with it and figure it out. It takes time to go through that process of looking at tons of setups and learning how to define your setups to begin with, and then how to have a consistent entry, exit, stop, profit target, and how you will manage trades and move those stops/targets around once the trade is open, a lot of which is focused on minimizing your losses on the losing trades."

If you look at any indicator and see how it typically behaves in a given setup, the indicator can tell you a lot, if you’re willing to (A) spend the time to learn to objectively identify a setup, and (B) look through many examples of that setup and how the indicator behaves in that setup, then you will see patterns that are helpful. I don’t find indicators that useful unless you identify the context of a specific setup first, but having said that, you can use indicators to provide the context to more objectively identify a setup.

In one setup I use a series of fib extensions as a way of determining stop placement, and also delay entry until I see certain fib criteria, and estimate if the move will provide sufficient risk:reward, but there’s nothing magic about fib there. It’s just one way of many that could show a slowing of momentum and give me some price levels to consider. I could probably substitute a number of indicators to get similar signals."

getdisciplined,fcj566y,t1_fcire5x,1577677536.0,"Yes I’d recommend the Carol Dweck book as one of the most important books everyone should read. The examples in the book which show how critical mindset is, are really shocking. In one study, a bunch of students were given an easy test, and half were told, “you did great, you must be smart”, and the other half were told, “you did great, you must have worked hard”. One sentence. That’s the only difference. They followed the students for some time, and I think even years later the “hard work” group was significantly outperforming the “smart” group. The “smart” group even went on to perform worse on the same test when they took it a second time, and many of them resorted to cheating and lying about their test results in order to try and continue appearing smart and protect the ego. One sentence instilled a fixed mindset vs a growth mindset. It’s that powerful. It sets the trajectory of your life.

I didn’t intend to predict you being defensive, but rather, I didn’t want you to dismiss it because you logically agree with it. A lot of people think, “yeah sure, obviously people can learn new things”, and they miss the point. There’s a large difference between believing that people can improve, and living it daily. If you accept that eating fewer calories will lead to weight loss, that provides you zero value if you only accept it as logically true and don’t apply it through your actions. When you do pay attention to the mindset of yourself and others, you see this mindset dichotomy everywhere where people limit themselves constantly and in drastic, life altering ways. In a real sense people are lying to themselves constantly.

The general idea you’re describing with sticky notes, I have heard called several things, habit loop triggers, pattern interrupt, or “crushing ANTs” (ANT=automatic negative thoughts). It’s exactly the right strategy. You use undesirable outcomes as the trigger to remind you to do something more productive. Negative thoughts and emotions become nothing but signals and reminders to look at your sticky notes to yourself. You’re on exactly the right path, and your job is to stick to it. Like exercising a muscle, every time you try, and life throws you off track, you still get stronger each time, even if only a little bit. As long as you don’t give up for good, you eventually succeed. Deciding not to give up is the difference between impossible and inevitable.

Look at these words. You have a fixed mindset. At some level you believe people are what they are and they don’t change much, that people are talented, or they’re not. That is your belief. It’s a false belief that sabotages you 100 times a day without you even realizing it.

You might say you don’t really believe that. But your actions say otherwise. Actions flow from your beliefs, and by your own words, your actions show that you choose to believe this. It’s a choice you make 100 times each day for some simple and useless reward, like protecting your ego, or making yourself feel better for only a moment. By playing the victim you get to feel good for a moment, and that’s it. That’s the full reward of your choice to continue believing that people are fixed.

The good news is, it’s *only* a belief, and you can change your beliefs at any moment. Your habits from this unhelpful belief will stick around temporarily, but those fade with time. Change the belief first, the actions will follow.

You need growth mindset instead, a learning mindset. Choose to believe that people can learn and become better. Choose to believe this *to an extreme*. Humans are not pre-programmed. We have to learn everything. Some animals are born knowing how to run, but they do not adapt and learn new skills. Not humans. Humans are 100% incapable of surviving on their own at birth and must *learn new skills for many years* before they could survive on their own. Humans are learning machines. Given enough time we can learn anything without limitation. That means, it does not matter where you are today. It only matters where you want to go, and how hard you are willing to work to get there. Believe you can, and you will.

You must choose to believe this to an extreme. Someone might think, well you can’t change how tall you are, that’s fixed. But that’s not true at all. Someone out there chose not to have that limiting belief, and they came up with a surgery that can make you taller. There is not much that we can imagine that is impossible by the laws of physics. So never think something is impossible.

Instead, always think, if this were possible how much work would be required? Then decide if that amount of work is important enough to you to justify doing the work. Most things will not be important enough to you, and that’s fine. But there’s a world of difference between saying “this isn’t important to me” and saying “this is impossible”. One is true and empowering, and one is a lie that keeps you perpetually weak.

If you’re Elon Musk and wanted to colonize Mars, don’t think “I can’t do that”. Instead ask what would be required, and the answer might be, you take several exponential steps forward, first becoming a successful business person, then sell  PayPal to make hundreds of millions of dollars, then work 100 hours per week and start other businesses like Tesla, and one of which is SpaceX that can actually take you to Mars in the near future. Most of us will say, “that will take me 30 years of working 100+ hours per week and that goal is not important enough to me to do that amount of work”, and that’s fine. Decide what is important to you, what you want to get out of life, and work toward that goal instead. But be honest about it. Never say “I can’t”. Instead say “that’s not important to me”.

Flip your mindset to being a learner. You don’t care if you are seen as right. You care about discovering the right answer, even if that means you ask dumb questions in front of other people. They will judge you for a day, but you will get your right answer, and you will do it again tomorrow. And one day you will have gathered thousands of right answers and be a thousand miles ahead of all of those shallow souls who judged you. You will be happy and fulfilled because you are moving closer to what’s important to you every day.

You do this by focusing on empowerment instead of results. Focus on your effort, and your responses. Try hard, and if you fail, that’s fine. Control your response by choosing to begin again. Your response is really all you control anyway. When you decide to never give up permanently and always try again, you are, in a very real sense, unstoppable.

Your new master in life is your goals. You move toward your goals, and you avoid anything that moves you away from your goals. As you grow, your goals will change. That’s fine, move toward the new goals. If you fail, it doesn’t matter, because your self esteem is defined by whether you are moving toward your goals. Do things that move you toward your goals. Believe things that move you toward your goals. Avoid everything else.

Your mind will play tricks with you. It will say you are a failure, that you’re dumb, and worthless. The incredible thing about making your goals your only master in life, is that those negative thoughts can even be 100% true, and you don’t have to care one bit. Choose to care about learning, about acquiring new skills that move you closer to your goals. Maybe you are actually dumb. Who cares, you’re moving toward your goals. Maybe you are actually a bad person. Who cares, you’re moving toward your goals. You’re doing it. Everyday you’re moving forward, even if only a little bit. And if you fail one day or one week, and your mind tells you what a screw up you are, it doesn’t matter, because you are the type of person that never gives up, not permanently. You are the type of person that begins again after you fail. You are the type of person that enjoys failure, because you are a learner and failure always teaches you something new, and you love learning new things.

It’s really simple. But it’s not easy. Avoid limiting beliefs and actively seek empowering beliefs all day long. Your mind is really good at playing tricks on you. It doesn’t want you to take risks. It thinks it’s keeping you safe. And 1000 years ago when humans lived in tribes, taking a risk and looking foolish might actually mean you get kicked out of the tribe, and at that time being alone in the wilderness meant you would die. So there’s a really good reason your brain sabotages you all day long. But those reasons are no longer true. Take risks and look foolish all day long and learn something. Decide what’s important to you, set some goals, and get after it. Only fear if you are in physical danger, that’s still a real thing. Never fear someone thinking you’re stupid, that’s not real anymore.

If I had one piece of advice on how to fight the limiting self talk your brain will throw at you all day, I would say to fill your life with empowering and practical words through podcasts and audio books. The two podcasts that have been the most empowering to me are:

- Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu. Specifically the [Q&A and AMA episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8qcvQ7Byc3PQTbPqra60GsQaf8Hmh36E) are gold. 

- Chasing Excellence with Ben Bergeron. This is a really good complement to Impact Theory, because he says many of the same things but from a different perspective, often with real examples from his coaching of high level athletes.

That’s hundreds of hours of empowering words you can have constantly going in the background of your life. If you want to make that change in mindset, I don’t know of any better way. It’s like having a personal coach keeping you on track.

- **Eating**: I stopped eating sugar, at least on work days. One problem if you’re eating carbs (sugar) is your body releases insulin to keep your blood sugar from getting too high, and insulin makes you tired. So people think they’ll eat a “healthy” breakfast of oatmeal, yogurt with fruit and granola, and whole wheat toast, but that’s all sugar and starch (both of which quickly turn into glucose) and you experience insulin crash and get tired unless you are very active and your body is burning off that glucose. A couple diets I’ve done which are both low glycemic (meaning low sugar, so minimal insulin crash) are Tim Ferriss’s Slow Carb Diet (SCD), and the keto diet. SCD includes 1 cheat day per week where you can literally go wild and eat whatever you want, and it’s easier than keto. But for me keto provides the best sustained energy by far of any way of eating I’ve ever tried, which makes sense because you’re literally using fat for fuel, and you have weeks worth of fat strapped to your body at all times, so you can go all day without eating and not feel tired at all. I went from literally leaving work one day at 2pm because I couldn’t stay awake, to being able to focus for 16-18 hours in a day if I needed to. A simple thing you can do to check this, is see what you eat for breakfast one day, and just add up the carbs, and that’s how much sugar you’re eating for breakfast. On most working days I only eat around 30g carbs for the entire day. Most people’s breakfast alone is probably way above that. Eating a high carb breakfast at home isn’t necessarily any better than hitting the drive through.

- **Sleep**: Learn to sleep without an alarm if possible. This means, for a while, going to bed really early so your body gets the sleep it needs and you still wake up on time. Eventually your body gets caught up on sleep, though it might take months, and eventually you can go to bed later and still wake up on time without an alarm. I wish it weren’t so, but the body needs however much sleep it needs, and that’s that. Some people need more sleep, and if that’s you, there’s no avoiding the negative consequences. Just gotta get that sleep.

- **Exercise**: just do something daily. Even if it’s going for a 2 minute walk outside. As you build the habit, you’ll eventually start doing more. Build the habit first. The most important part of this exercise advice is the **daily** part. Do something that’s sustainable enough for you to continue doing every day.  I also found working out in the morning made me less energetic during the day, so I started working out in the evening, and since it makes me tired it helps me get to bed earlier :-)"

For most people, control is absent, so their lives are dictated by what’s important to other people, or whether someone cut them off in traffic, or the way the wind blows, and every other external factor outside of their control.

Gaining control really just lets you focus on what’s important to you, with minimal stress and anxiety, instead of wasting your life on someone else’s priorities. Control gives you the backbone to say no, just like a budget gives you clarity to say “no, I can’t buy that, yet”. It prevents you from being trampled on by the world. 

If your definition of being highly productive is getting a lot done, then no, I don’t think that generally brings fulfillment at all.

Essentialism is preferred: Less, but better. That’s closer to Covey’s definition of highly productive."
getdisciplined,fc35c3o,t1_fc2xj0q,1577381816.0,"I find it’s best to do something ”busy but mindless”. The 5 minutes shouldn’t be productive or rewarding. Actually I think using it for a reward is detrimental to the process. It’s more of a mental break/reset than a reward.

So I usually go to the bathroom, do some chore like dishes/laundry (if I’m at home), do a quick cleanup of my desk, do some quick exercises, meditate, or just get up and walk outside for a few minutes.

What I find *super* counterproductive is using the 5 minutes for stuff I’m really interested in. I can spend all day checking my investments and looking at stock charts, so if I spend 2 minutes doing that my brain is now pulled hard in that direction and I’m not going to be focused on my work once I get back to it. So I focus on work and mindless breaks, and since I usually get more done that way for the day, I have time later to nerd out with whatever my other interests are."

- Never think, “I’ll learn this method, then I’ll be able to trade”. That never works. You can’t copy someone else’s method. This only ends with you disappointed, saying “this doesn’t work”.

- Instead of the mindset that a learning resource “works” or “doesn’t work”, just approach each resource with the goal of learning something. If you watched 100 hours of “VP” and learned 1 thing that’s a win.

Ultimately you have to learn how to think about the markets in a way that makes sense to you. You can’t copy other people completely. So it doesn’t make sense to try and copy his “algorithm”. Pick parts that make sense to you and try to build something.

“VP” has some decent things to say, and plenty of nonsense as well. Like he says all of these indicators “don’t work”, which is obviously false as there are people using them just fine. I think maybe he’s just an attitudinal, poor communicator. Like it’s obvious what he means is, “I couldn’t get it to work”, or “based on my testing this indicator did not perform well within my algorithmic approach”."
