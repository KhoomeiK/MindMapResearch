pcmasterrace,ffb9f5z,t1_ffb9dt9,1579756062.0,Wouldn't a 6 to 6+2 pin adapter be better? Because I'm kinda broke

pcmasterrace,ff78dz6,t1_ff4ls1s,1579643142.0,"Thinking about getting 32 gb of ram could you recommend some? And are you sure I don't need a new cpu? I kinda wanna get one to help with everything bc I feel like my computer is pretty slow tbh, is there one you can recommend me that's reasonable?"
pcmasterrace,ff4ibg7,t3_erdlg0,1579564297.0,I ordered a new GPU (Nvidia GTX 1080) and my old one was a 970 and I felt it couldn't do well enough with most games. Anyway I have a i7 7700 and 8gbs of ram. I was wondering if I need to upgrade those as well to keep up with my new GPU?
