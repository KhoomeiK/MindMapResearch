Tinder,ffbvs0h,t3_esoodq,1579784411.0,Gold gets less matches after. They want the paying customers to keep paying. Matches make them stop paying
UndoneTV,ffbufiq,t1_ffbhsbq,1579783119.0,I agree.
ThatsInsane,ffaxxca,t1_ffaxm9b,1579747057.0,"That's like a top out. The average is less than 100 pounds, my Shepard is 130. The wolves in this video were not 180."
ThatsInsane,ffapqo2,t1_ffapgyn,1579741608.0,"My dogs got like 30 pounds on the average wolf. Probably would have to charge one first before they charge you, they don't usually want to fight and will back off quick when they realize they could be injured. Not saying it's a good idea but it could work."
ThatsInsane,ffap7h4,t1_ffanvc4,1579741248.0,"True, you'd have to charge one, get a headwack in, it wouldn't be able to stop you unless it jumps too.a spear would be ideal for defense vs all 3"
ThatsInsane,ffanfan,t1_ffamllq,1579740048.0,I bet with a baseball bat the average man could fend off 3 wolves. I'd be more scared of 3 German Shepards

coolguides,fezsby5,t1_fezhv2x,1579461020.0,Bag compresses under the weight of your food and other heavy items. Also most packs tend to have a bottom zipper for easy access.
coolguides,fezrv5h,t1_feyrahd,1579460846.0,"Dunno if someone said this yet but the heavy stuff tends to compress the bag, especially if it's down not synthetic. Makes more space in the pack."

snowboarding,fd4r6w5,t1_fd3gpxs,1578170285.0,"Casey Willax has been snowboarding a while. Revert or 180 into switch, then ride until you're about to catch an edge, and pop a 180 back. Do this as much as you can through the season and your switch riding will come along pretty quick, and you'll be preparing yourself for smooth and stylish riding"
HumansBeingBros,fcujf0g,t1_fcuisns,1577982362.0,Maybe. For me trout fishing is more being in the right place at the right time. It's all about knowing which holes to hit. And the best trout streams usually more effort is spent navigating to them and through them than the fishing itself
HumansBeingBros,fcugvk7,t1_fcu0nih,1577980655.0,I'd argue it's easier with a fly rod if you know what you're doing. Spin reels see usually limited to larger presentations and trout aren't always biting big lures
aww,fclbmko,t1_fclb3y3,1577744078.0,"Yeah but you're claiming this water has more debris than rivers I fish, which you know nothing about. Also it floods all the time, causing conditions just like this. As a raft guide I'm sure you know while this water is certainly sufficient to knock you off your feet, with some good prep and experience its not difficult to navigate ankle deep. Especially in this scenario where the kid literally staged a puppy rescue"

Dynavap,fcl4z5b,t1_fcl3nx9,1577739921.0,If it's not combusted it ain't heated too much.
aww,fcl4x6h,t1_fcl40no,1577739887.0,"Mature riverbed sure, but less visibility and less debris is a claim you cannot make."
Dynavap,fcl34le,t1_fcl2z5k,1577738774.0,Well you just proved my point I think. Whenever I heat a fat rip up the dynavap starts fuming vapor everywhere before I even rip it. And theres no grooves on my dynavap tip.
Dynavap,fcl2ksm,t1_fcl1wyu,1577738433.0,"Yeah but it's not pulling preheated air over the herb. The heat is passed conductively. I will admit however that if you only pack a pinch it does still vape, and usually pretty well, and that may be from convection forces but I really struggle to see how the dynavap is primarily convection when you look at how other convection vapes work."
aww,fcl0j5v,t1_fcl0h00,1577737170.0,Not lower than this guy running in ankle water...
Dynavap,fcl0c32,t3_eho04o,1577737050.0,Heat lower and the hit will be bigger. Experiment and you'll find you can get a nice flavor rip or completely brown a bowl with one hit.
Dynavap,fcl08qi,t1_fckgik8,1577736991.0,"I don't agree with this. The dynavap uses conduction which favors a tight pack. Just have to heat it more, and usually towards the bottom more. Big packs easily milk up a 20 inch beaker bomg"
aww,fckzxmt,t1_fckm7um,1577736801.0,Yeah water can be really powerful but this is like saying  I risk my life everytime I go fishing

StonerEngineering,fckwma2,t1_fckw7vy,1577734771.0,I mean if it's an unsafe vaporizer that's warranted. But I know what you mean cuz I've seen people get shit on for spending big bones on a Pax.

StonerEngineering,fckuy92,t3_ehnocv,1577733743.0,How's it rip though? Do you have another butane vape to compare to? And any offgassing risks from soapstone? Really like this design
StonerEngineering,fckuu35,t1_fckk60x,1577733673.0,As a mighty and dynavap owner I feel targeted... I'll always reccomend a boundless or healthy rips to anyone looking for a solid vape though. Many more vapes available for the enthusiasts..
