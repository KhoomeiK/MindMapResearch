bisexual,fgg03ea,t3_edvvc3,1580751349.0,"I can relate to this, kinda. I wasn't raised with homophobia to that extent because people here don't talk about homosexuality per se. It's not hated on but it's a hush hush topic. But O see myself confirming to heteronormativity as well and think a lot about what will happen if I come out to my parents (I'm out to my sister and she's super accepting). I come from a place where marriage is seen as a necessity to life and I'm afraid about what I'll do when I reach that age. 23m currently. Hang in there, op. I understand you."
