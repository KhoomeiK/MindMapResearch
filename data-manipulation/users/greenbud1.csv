happy,feden6r,t1_fedadaj,1579009417.0,"There's always more to lose until we're happy but looking at the before and after given the time period you should be very happy.  Not to undermine your efforts but I think you could ease off a bit, make sure you're eating healthy and have the nutrients to build muscle now that you're more active.  Also ramp up the activity slow as muscles get stronger way before your joints and ligaments catch up."

What confused me was when putting scallops and black pudding together became the norm.  Such a delicate flavour on one hand completely dominated by the other.  Never understood it."
ireland,fdduvax,t1_fda71n9,1578324552.0,TBH I usually go the speed limit + 5mph and am happy to block anyone trying to go faster.  Even if I'm only slowly passing someone going a few mph slower than me I'll stay in the passing lane until the left lane is clear for ages before getting out of their way.

AskReddit,fc5ykj6,t3_ega9qc,1577468535.0,"Wipe down the equipment before you use it.  

It's that time of year and gyms are great places to spread a cold.  People aren't too concerned with hacking or what's oozing out of them when they're busy exercising so I always thoroughly wipe down my elliptical before stepping on as I'll be spending a good hour there and might be touching it quite a bit all that time. 

*** also wipe down afterwards.  And not just the handles but if your sweat rained down then at least make an effort to wipe it all down."
