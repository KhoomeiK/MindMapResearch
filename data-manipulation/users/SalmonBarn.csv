NatureIsFuckingLit,ffb930m,t3_esjxcc,1579755665.0,Holy shit. My whole childhood I thought that moose had somewhat lumpy and rounded off antlers but this moose makes it clear that they are metal as fuck.

Minecraft,ffb84h5,t1_ffaqa0x,1579754603.0,You are my mom goals. I have a three year old and I actively want him to play Minecraft when he’s old enough
Minecraft,ffb81rb,t1_ffan9pg,1579754531.0,You should have pointed out that villagers have furniture in their homes so you were only following the trends!!
breakingmom,ffb7mk4,t1_ffar5p9,1579754090.0,Winter does make it harder to leave the warm warm bed lol. I have a robe next to my bed to make sure I can always be a little warm when I get up.
creepyencounters,ffaj8ya,t3_esjqvc,1579737086.0,Woah. I for sure would have fallen for that..... definitely sounds like a trap
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffahcn3,t3_esh3rn,1579735759.0,This has to smell so fucking bad.... oof. I feel bad for them.
raisedbynarcissists,ffah7gf,t1_ffa3nex,1579735664.0,"I’ve resorted to just telling people whom I’m not close with (like co workers and junk) that he’s dead. Legit is the easiest way, for me. But I like your idea, too."
relationship_advice,ffa1a0r,t1_ff8ln9i,1579725866.0,100% this comment.
AskMen,ffa0lop,t3_esdvhi,1579725467.0,"Huh. Love these comments. 
As a wife to an obese dude who carries most of his weight in his belly, he doesn’t mind when I play with his fat. As long as it’s more loving than patronizing lol. 

We both enjoy belly rubbing. A lot. It just feels good."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ff9y4fm,t1_ff9tohn,1579724017.0,"Honestly though, best wishes. That sounds like my personal hell."
raisedbynarcissists,ff9xgr2,t3_ese2us,1579723623.0,"Absolutely this is common. I hate it, too. 

My Ndad has been cut out of my life and when I tell people the short version of why they always come back with “but he’s your dad! Don’t you have any good memories to hold onto??”

First of all- no. But even if I did, what does it matter? Some people will never understand that emotional trauma that comes with some of what Nparents do. I swear, to some people it’s almost as if it’s required that I was sexually assaulted in order for my feelings to be justified. I’ve even had a friend hint at this very thing."
TrueOffMyChest,ff9eanm,t3_es5vqz,1579711149.0,"Damn, I’ve reposted too but never had that level of hate. 

It’s one thing to give a heads up that it’s a repost or if it’s reposted a crazy amount of times, have a complaint but those PMs? Damn. 

I just hope you know those fools are FOOLS."
offmychest,ff9b59g,t3_es81y1,1579708955.0,"Moments like this are what makes marriage/ long term worth it. I have little moments, too. I’ll try to explain and people have this look of like “well that’s... mundane” but it’s just the feeling they give you, it’s like those beginning butterflies all over again but amplified because of your amazing history together. Feels so good."
breakingmom,ff9ax12,t3_esbtt5,1579708810.0,"My husband made homemade habanero sauce the other day..... with about 10 whole habanero peppers. 

My butt hole sympathizes for your butt hole. I too, was poisoned!"
