> But regardless; which do you mean? How should antidepressants be stigmatized in your opinion? 

Their usage should be stigmatized. It must be seen as something barbaric and purely profit-driven. The cases where people take it for years and years without anything good coming out of them need to be more publicized. The way they work --- which is usually by messing with 5-HT receptors--- must be publicized. People need to understand that taking an antidepressant is a shot in the dark, because you can't ever know if messing with one of your 5-ht receptors will be good for you. People need to know more about serotonin syndrome. They need to know more about all the other negative aspects, about the unscientific prescription methodology, etc.

This type of medication should be just something to give you a little nudge, a little push to help you get things done, not something you need to take for the rest of your life. Like pain medication. If you break a leg, you don't need to be put on pain killers for the rest of your life, only while it hurts.

By now you must have read somewhere about how there are other ways to represent color. Chrominance would be Hue and Saturation, luminance would be the Value or Brightness in a HSV system.

Since everything in a VHS tape is analog, the VHS player needs analog circuitry to amplify the signals. Amplifiers such as that have a parameter called gain, which refers to by how much they increase the level (e.g: from 0.001mv to 1v the gain is 1000x). There are many forms of automatic gain control, which operate on feedback loops. E.g: if the output is too high, it will decrease the gain, if it's too low it increases.

That fluctuation is the VHS player's automatic gain control doing its job on a noisy signal. Notice how in the video you posted the guy's grey shirt remains kind of the same, but the background and his face changes color.

The thing is: no one actually believes that. I grew up hearing that you need to win people over, ""just be yourself!"", ""it's the personality that matters!"", ""just be nice!"". Then I went to university and went to parties where I'd see a dude just walk to a girl and start making out without saying a single word. Did he win her over? Was it because of his personality? Was he nice?

I need to ""better"" myself so that I can be good enough for a disgusting fat sow.


No, that's not perfect.

> Gravity's strength decreases exponentially as you get further away from the center of mass. 

And does it increase exponentially as you get closer into the center of mass? I don't think so. The gravity between two bodies would be infinite if they had their center of mass in the same point, meaning they'd be stuck together forever, which is what happens if you make a simulation using Newton's gravitational formula. But then again, it's wrong.

> In the simulation you linked none of the particles has the necessary escape velocity. 

And?

> However, if you enter the sphere of influence of a gravitational body, and do not slow down, gravity will inherently accelerate you past escape velocity. 

And that is the only thing that can happen?  That's so newtonian it's not even wrong"

Like this:

Things are so weird that only dark matter itself could be the cause of gravity, and not regular matter itself. E.g: regular matter forms clumps where there is this ""hidden matter"". If dark matter only attracts but isn't attracted by matter, planets don't oscillate with their ""dark twins"".

EDIT: this one is closer. Imagine the little ball is made of ""dark matter"".

You'd do it like this:

Clear the depth/color buffer

Set the camera clipping range to render what is in focus

Render it, put everything in depth/color buffer

Set the camera clipping range to render what isn't in focus anymore

Render it to a texture (maybe?) with a smaller resolution

Then you cheat by stretching that texture to fit the color buffer, applying a gaussian blur filter and then writing to the color/depth buffer.

This is a technique similar to what is used for doing depth of field on mobile games. You can either use it as a deliberate aesthetic choice, or ignore the limitations, in that case it will look like garbage.
