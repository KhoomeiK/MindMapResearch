Tinder,fffd914,t1_fffck8f,1579881407.0,Have you seen half of the posts here? They’re pretty mean or super vulgar too. I can respect your personal tastes tho but I feel like this sub as a whole hates when women joke too

elephantgifs,ffb3bjd,t1_ffayrel,1579750714.0,"He clearly doesn’t care about the structure considering he smashed through the handrails. You can see when he steps on the walkway, it wobbles, so I figured he’s probably trying to avoid tripping on it. Cute elephant but a horrible title."
