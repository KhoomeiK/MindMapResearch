There's someone who already commented that when talking face to face, we tend to stick to one language. 

Further more, we actually have different languages per region and each language has an off-shoot dialect. I am from Region V (there's 17 regions in the Ph) and we use the Bicolano language but in our region, each province/city is represented by it's own dialect. So imagine, a province/city separated by mere hours has an entirely different dialect is soo rad but confusing. :D"

So we sometimes switch to English when talking in a public forum where we want the audience to understand us. There's someone who already commented that when talking face to face, we tend to stick to one language. 

Further more, we actually have different languages per region and each language has an off-shoot dialect. I am from Region V (there's 17 regions in the Ph) and we use the Bicolano language but in our region, each province/city is represented by it's own dialect. So imagine, a province/city separated by mere hours has an entirely different dialect is soo rad but confusing. :D"

Kausapin mo na ayaw mo na, tapos go cold turkey. Change work, change number, change location. 

Good luck, hindi katapusan ng mundo pag matapos yang relasyon na yan. Thank God, di kayo nahuli ng misis nya (kami din naman, di nahuli ng husband nya). At wag mo nang hintayin na mahuli. OP, maawa ka sa sarili mo. I feel your pain, but it needs to stop."
