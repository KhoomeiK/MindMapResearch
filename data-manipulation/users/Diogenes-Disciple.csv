unpopularopinion,ffhkp9z,t3_etknhf,1579939769.0,"I feel very similar. As the daughter of two extremely ambitious people, I don’t think I have much of a choice but to get a job, so my plan is to invest in real estate, save up enough to hire someone to manage them, and then retire really early so I can get married and have kids and be a housewife, while also being financially stable. I’m not super hardworking, at least not now, but I like the idea of spending my days cooking, cleaning, and taking care of my children. It’s what I like to do now. I try not to say that that’s what I want in life because it makes me sound unambitious, but hey. I totally support anyone who wants to be a housewife. If you aren’t going to hire a nanny, a housewife is totally useful in a household. Neither of my parents cook, and we only recently hired someone to clean the house, which is a relief. Housewifing is never really made to seem like a viable option these days."

A lot of times neutral people do stupid or cruel things. And then the “good cops” are just as neutral as the “bad cops,” and they just happened not to fuck up. Sure some cops are real pieces of work, and some are real pieces of shit, but I think most are just as normal as teachers, doctors, etc. I don’t think most of us would do any better because if you think about it, the cops aren’t “cops,” they’re one of us. They’re people, and they’re apart of society just as we are. I think a lot of times when the media is mad at what some people are doing, they immediately group them off and forget that they’re the same as you and I."
