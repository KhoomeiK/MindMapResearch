UnresolvedMysteries,ffpt4by,t1_ffndb8z,1580104724.0,"The period blood is something that keeps me from co-signing on the suicide theory as well. Even if a lot hadn’t been made about Rebecca’s modesty, I just don’t think even the most enhanced sense of guilt and despair would have prompted her to ignore the cultural taboos of keeping menstruation discrete."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffpsppt,t1_ffp508i,1580104306.0,"I asked because it’s a little weird you randomly snapped at someone else—someone you initiated the conversation with—to basically shut up about a relevant talking point tangentially related to the topic at hand because a person not at all related to either happened to die. So yeah, I say again if you’re that upset, it’s super easy not to continue participating in a conversation. Or keep being unnecessarily hostile I guess. You do you."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffp4lhg,t1_ffotqt6,1580086097.0,"Similarly, I think it’s worth remembering everyone has their different breaking points. What I mean is, I can honestly say my mom friends pressuring me wouldn’t change my mind about something like this. Neither would pressure from my siblings or my own parents. My husband, however, or therapist? I admit there’s an exceptionally strong chance that yes; pressure from them to do this could be enough to convince me to flex my own parenting convictions. So I can’t really fault the McCanns too much in that respect."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffp35ww,t1_ffm05m8,1580085329.0,"So much this. My parents were abusive, neglectful...but two of my siblings died of medical ailments that were totally outside anything they could have said or done. It was a super bad roll of the generic dice. And yet I can’t tell you how many people have speculated otherwise."

UnresolvedMysteries,ffoi8gf,t1_ffndjwd,1580077862.0,"Admittedly, I think the “small realities of people’s lives seem strange when they suddenly get put under a microscope” is a point that gets glossed over a lot. Not with the Degree case, necessarily; but in general when families are suddenly thrust into the spotlight. When I was a teen and just getting into true crime—specifically reading a lot of Ann Rule and watching CourtTV and expecting I’d inevitably end up in the middle of my own murder story—I’d resolve to live as uncomplicated a life as possible because of how often I felt little things were blown up into big damn deals.

Now, as an adult myself, I realize that a) if you live long enough, there is no such thing as living an uncomplicated life; and b) what is defined as complicated is pretty damn arbitrary. As a mom now myself, there is no secret I wouldn’t spill to help locate my child, but what does strike me about this case in particular is that he was really forthcoming about getting the candy, so transparency may be a moot point regardless."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffodej8,t1_ffm7vbg,1580076556.0,"I don’t have a strong opinion on the involvement of the Degree parents, but it’s not an uncommon occurrence in my house for either me (35), my husband (36), or my 65-year-old dad who lives with us to occasionally go out to get junk food, just because we can."

CPTSD,ff3mpbt,t3_er2q5c,1579544340.0,"This touches on so much for me. I have been retraumatized by a therapist before, and in one case, I can say with absolute conviction the most significant experience should have resulted in the therapist losing her license. She broke my confidentiality in group, publicly severing the therapeutic alliance without giving me notice until the moment she asked the other group members to lambast me, and then failed to supply me with any referrals elsewhere. It was a long time before I was willing to take the risk of trusting another therapist after that. 

That experience was 13 years ago, and I’ve managed to do some really good therapy around it, but there are times it still gets activated. And when it does, it hurts so much more than any other trauma I’ve lived through. That’s saying something, because my trauma history even before that experience was significant.

I’ve encountered a number of providers, good and not so skilled, since. And what I’m sorry to say is that mediocre therapists, those who are either unskilled or inefficient, are a dime a dozen. Truly great therapists, like truly awful, incompetent therapists, are far more rare. The therapist who traumatized me accomplished some amazing things with other clients. We never experienced any breakthroughs together that I can recall, but I’m reluctant to label her a narcissistic or even “bad” therapist. Even as I recognize that validity in other therapists who have told me what she did to me was absolutely grounds to have her license revoked, I can look at her work around my community and see just how often she got it right. 

Does that mean she’s incapable of being wrong? Definitely not. What she did to me was objectively wrong. And all of her good work doesn’t negate the long-term traumatic impact she’s had on my life. That’s kind of the bottom line too, though. Whether or not she is a good therapist, her work with me culminated in a bad act that I have to continue dealing with, probably for the rest of my life. Fortunately, I am working with a therapist who is skilled in trauma by virtue of on the job education, who is also completely keyed into my (at times) ambivalence with therapy and need to be believed."

todayilearned,fe6ph48,t1_fe6hixq,1578899367.0,"I’m guessing that you’re probably joking, but you aren’t that far off. I live in California. My husband barely survived the Tubbs Fire three years ago. Then, last year, we were impacted by the Camp Fire. I absolutely had a nervous breakdown that included developing short-term, but extremely debilitating, agoraphobia. I still can’t deal with reminders of Fire without having an anxiety attack."

mentalhealth,fct1t7d,t3_eiqqy1,1577930668.0,"I’m...really uncomfortable with drawing parallels between mental illness and gender identity, especially with casual language about choice. Especially because a significant reason scores of transfolx deal with mental health struggles in the first place is due to the belief that their gender identification is determined by the body parts they were born with and they can simply opt out of the suffering by choosing to embrace that archaic thinking.

That being said, is mental illness a choice? That is a question a lot of us have asked ourselves, and I don’t think it’s one any of us can answer globally. I know I didn’t choose to have PTSD or OCD or ADHD, but how I have experienced each of these conditions has been driven, at least partially, by choices I did make. In example, just today, I spent two hours filling out a wipe off calendar for my family’s schedule. I didn’t choose to have perfectionistic tendencies as part of my OCD, but I did make the choice to skip out on my Prozac lately, despite consciously knowing that doing so makes my OCD more, well, obsessive-compulsive.

In other words, it’s a complicated issue. And it’s probably true that there is some casual glorification or actual mental illness. I know people who brag about having OCD because they like a neat workspace or something, whereas in its most extreme my OCD manifests in ripping entire patches of hair out. It can be upsetting because I think if people really knew what such conditions entailed, they’d see there’s nothing remotely cool about them in the first place. Mental illness isn’t a weakness, but it also isn’t something to dismiss for the way it can control a life or even derail it."

I spent decades of my life depressed. I fully believed I would eventually commit suicide. For me, it was a question of when, not if. 

Almost a year ago, I finally went to an intensive residential treatment program, and it saved my life. I came home after two months and everything had changed for me.

I still have some tough days occasionally, but nothing like what it was before."
