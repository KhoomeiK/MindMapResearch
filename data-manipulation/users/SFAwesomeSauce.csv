ChoosingBeggars,feab09o,t1_fe8rms8,1578946465.0,"Why? They're a professional, and it's what their time is worth. Most tradespeople I've dealt with have an hour minimum payment agreement. This individual made sure that the customer understood what they were paying them, as well as having them sign the payment agreement. Make sure you double check that you actually need the pro before calling them and signing anything."
ChoosingBeggars,fea8go9,t1_fe9jhn3,1578945598.0,"Not an asshole. They called you and it's what your time is worth. That's why you learn a trade and become a professional. That's time where a higher paid job could have been done; charge away. I work in a pawn shop, and sometimes people come back the next day and want their stuff back and only pay their borrowed amount, without the fees (Turns out I didn't need to do this, borrowed it from parents/friends/etc). That's not how it works, you agree to the cost when you initiate business and sign a contract, and if you don't like it after the fact that's too bad."

facepalm,fd2j4ev,t1_fd2fujf,1578147971.0,Likely Monk Gyatso from Avatar: The Last Airbender.
