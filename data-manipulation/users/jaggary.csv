I don’t give a fuck what you come to Reddit for. You’re an idiot. Sorry not everything in life is rainbows.

dashcamgifs,ff2d4k1,t1_ff24omi,1579501332.0,"You also can’t really compare the autobahn to *rural highways* in the US. “Rural highway” often means 50, 60+ speed limits, with stretches with speed limit fluctuations where people don’t even adjust their speed to the limit changes. There are perpendicular crossroads and driveways off of them. You can’t compare roads to that like consistently limited access highways, not to mention several other factors like stricter German license requirements, better road maintenance, stricter inspection requirements, and other drivers just generally being more competent and organized than drivers in the US. Just because there are stretches on the autobahn with no speed limit doesn’t necessarily mean that’s the reason for fewer accidents"
