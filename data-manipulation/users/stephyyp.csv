socialanxiety,ffffho9,t1_ff4v1gw,1579882826.0,YES.
socialanxietyfriends,ffffdac,t3_egwqo8,1579882752.0,"I agree, definitely sounds like general anxiety. (Which can be just as bad)

I suffer from both so that could be the situation as well."
depression,fd6dmt3,t3_ek60m6,1578189367.0,this. right. here.
depression,fd68iui,t3_ek5nig,1578187126.0,"anything with cookie dough in it...

or... just straight cookie dough. :)"
depression,fd67v09,t3_ek5kik,1578186822.0,"wow, I’m so sorry you had to go through this.

have you tried thinking of any side hustles? this is America and nobody gets rich by just having one legal job... crazy right?"
depression,fd67b4p,t1_fd66n0b,1578186576.0,"you just haven’t found the right thing yet. can’t be mad at you because I haven’t either, I’m a huge pothead but I love money so I chose to love to work. if nobody else makes happy, buying anything you want may. 

but still, I’m getting off point.. theres gotta be something you like whether it’s cars, or sneakers or makeup (this is me not knowing whether you’re a female or male)."
depression,fd672na,t1_fd66hq2,1578186470.0,"how come? 
dude, bums can barely click a mouse and here you are with your knowledge trying to talk to people for help. 

give yourself some freaking credit man, you’re not that bad."
depression,fd66ltt,t3_ek573m,1578186271.0,get some help hun. it’s okay to have a mental illness.
depression,fd66h6b,t3_ek5f6k,1578186208.0,do you have anyone around you? there’s nothing you love to do? we gotta find something for you to do besides poppin!
depression,fd66bpw,t3_ek5g05,1578186137.0,"shit gets better.

we don’t go through all this pain and suffering for nothing. do what makes you happy. not to at all sound cliche but.. I promise there’s light at the end of the tunnel."
depression,fd664q4,t3_ek5haq,1578186056.0,"SH*T GETS BETTER.

i don’t want to be alive either but.. with all the pain and suffering we go through, something’s gotta give right? hustle your ass off and don’t look back - my family is dirt poor but my vision is me in a mansion hopping into my car of my choice lol. I’ve seen homeless people do it and we can too.

just don’t give up."
depression,fd65tda,t3_ek5hvk,1578185932.0,"hi love, I also have this issue and unfortunately as far as I know, it’s extremely difficult almost impossible to stop yourself from crying (with our mental issues). so I choose to remove myself from the situation no matter what. not sure if you’re in college yet but, step out of the room, get some air and your thoughts together and walk back in like a motherf*cking boss."
depression,fcz7e8g,t1_fcrgq0k,1578095173.0,I’m a girl but thanks hehe.
depression,fcrcvxa,t3_eikx42,1577900130.0,"people suck.

i remove myself to be alone so i can make my own self happy because people don’t do that for me. nobody cares about you except yourself, so love yourself and screw everybody else."
depression,fcrcfdp,t3_eikk9a,1577899952.0,wow. i wanna argue with you but i literally cannot.
depression,fcrc7jq,t3_eikqo7,1577899865.0,"f*ck loving someone else. love yourself first. 

clean up nice and do something you think is dope (not drugs). somethings that makes YOU happy. once you’re okay with the fact that you can’t just go out and look for the love of your life, it’ll become much less heavy on your heart. I promise you, someone out there will love you sooooo much I swear. 

just be patient. focus on yourself, love will come. it always does."
depression,fcrbnyy,t3_eikqy8,1577899633.0,JUST. STAY. ALIVE.
depression,fcrbn38,t3_eikqy8,1577899621.0,"just wait... maybe sh*t will finally go right. this is how I’ve kept myself alive for this long.
 

if I pull through just a little longer.. maybe life will turn out totally alright. dude, fate is fate and that shit can happen tomorrow. I’ve seen people go from sleeping in cars to being billionaires with absolutely no effort. who says that sh*t can’t happen to us?"
