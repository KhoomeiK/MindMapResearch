And your feelings are important, regardless of where they come from, but in this case, it's because they're the asshole to quote AITA.

With the feeling of owning the house, as you have a cat it's always been their house that they are kind enough to let you stay in whilst you open the cans / are deeply loved but the cat really can't say that. So, make sure the cat feels like it's so they're home and you'll then feel mildly subservient to it again and the house will become your home again.

Sorry, I'm overly focusing on your cat, but a) I love my cat waaaaaaay more than myself, and b) please don't take this as trivialising your trauma or feelings they're valid and important.

Cat."
bipolar,fc83n2d,t3_egkkvt,1577526093.0,"It might be too late for this comment, but he should drive not you even though it's tempting.

I'm really sorry that this has happened and when something plays into the illness like this it's really really horrible. He should want to get home and secure the back door. Probably, as is the case with almost all break-ins, they were looking for unoccupied houses and checked yours with a ring on the door bell and checking through the windows before breaking in via the back for greater privacy, it is highly unlikely that you've been watched unless there is a recently spurned partner, or your house is very high value - so that bit is probably just the mental talking.

But you're right to be worried and agitated, anyone would be at this point. More so due to the past experience.

My biggest thought right now is for your cat, it's been a really tough time. My cat would probably recommend tuna, but she would recommend tuna if your cat had been having a nap, so is not a reliable source of advice.

Cat cuddles may also help, both you and the cat."

bipolar,fap6sya,t1_fap6bm9,1576281309.0,"Ask for the therapy not to focus on the trauma, but on creating tools to deal with the negative behaviours you have (we all obsess over things, some worthy of obsessing about but it isn't good for us), we all will drive our mania or our depression into worse states, and is about mental tools to stop it getting worse. However, it's hard enough to think through the tools, and much more difficult to put them into practice, but totally worth it. That way it will help with coping with the ups, downs and things like anxiety obsession etc."
