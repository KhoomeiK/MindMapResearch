I'm still relatively new to tabletop, I only started 2 years ago and the group I'm playing with is still on the same campaign. But the books I've ~~read~~ skimmed through generally say that the rules within are mere suggestions. That the GM/DM is free to decide how they want their game to progress. Flipping through the D&D 5e DM guide, I can't find any mention of tone policing. There's a part that gives a brief rundown on the types of governments you can utilize in a campaign. The descriptions are brief and neutral, even the ones on autocracy, dictatorship, plutocracy, and theocracy. The Pathfinder first edition gamemastering guide does have a page on tone policing, but it's basically ""try and gauge if your players would be cool with an antagonist who rapes children before dumping that shit on them, and probably refrain from that completely if you're playing with children or in public"". 

This right here is the first I've encountered an RPG guidebook that overtly tells you how you're supposed to play. Pretty sure even harpies who shrieked that D&D is the devil's tool for bewitching young minds weren't this judgmental.

Edit: ok, was at book store today and I thumbed through the core rulebook of Pathfinder second edition... that indeed explicitly moralizes how to play. ""Players should never be allowed to rape, torture, harm children, own slaves or profit from the slave trade, or use mind-control magic unethically."" You can ignore this and play the edgiest of edgelords and there's not a damn thing Paizo can do to stop you of course, but goddamn it's depressing  to see it go from ""edgelording is ok, you're all mature adults, but see if the other players are cool with it first"" to ""UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS EDGELORDING TO BE PERMITTED!"""

DnD,fdohh0f,t3_emapy6,1578605234.0,"I'm in a Pathfinder campaign, and the DM awarded us the chance to make a custom magical item. I wanted a cursed item that bestowed a 10% chance of triggering wild magic. Basically every time I cast an arcane spell, I roll a d10, and on a 10 I consult a homebrewed 3.5 compatible table for wild magic effects I found online. I can do it on purpose by expending an additional spell slot when casting. First time it triggered a portal to the plane of negative energy opened right above my head. Fortunately the negative levels went away on their own with several long rests. 

But the DM wanted to add some extra spice. My idea was that it'd be a bauble, but he made it a coat. It has many pockets, and it would randomly steal unattended items near me. So when I'd reach into a pocket, the DM would roll from his own table to see what I'd pull out. During some downtime, I started rummaging. First thing I pull was a live pig. Like I put my hand in my pocket, grasped something, when when I removed it a full sized live pig just materialized. I'm playing a gnome, mind you, so I collapsed under it. Testing fate some more, I tried it again. Out I pull a campfire. Upon materializing, it being a ring of stones and smoldering logs suspended in mid-air, it fell apart... all over the wooden floor of the room in the inn I was staying at. In a panic, I cast sound burst on it, thinking the concussive force would extinguish it. It just scattered embers everywhere. An NPC, some gormless cattle rustler we picked up very early in the campaign who works as a cook in the town we've established as our base, then burst in demanding to know what the hell I was doing. ""I didn't start this fire, I pulled it out of my pocket!"" was my response. I then invited him to each his hand into a pocket and pull something out (giggidy). What followed was 15 minutes of watching the DM's flummoxed expressions as he consulted his notes, a wiki from his phone, and rolling a whole lot of dice. 

Long story short, the NPC pulled out a deck of many things. The card he drew was ""draw two additional cards""... one of which was motherfucking ***WISH***. His wish was to be the greatest warrior in the land... so the classless NPC is now a level 20 fighter. The other one was a dilemma. He was to choose between his most cherished possession - his favorite spoon, and his closest companion - the rogue NPC we picked up along with him, whom another member of our party has a whole romantic subplot going and is a pretty significant part of the campaign. The DM put the onus on me to decide which gets snap'd. ""High or low"", he said as he rolled his percentile dice. Luckily it was the spoon that crumbled into ash. But the NPC was not too happy, and the level 20 fighter threw me through the fucking wall."

Slater and Jessie Spano, respectively, in the single-camera comedy that explores what happens when California Gov. Zack Morris (Mark Gosselaar’s role) gets into hot water for closing too many low-income high schools and proposes the affected students be sent to the highest-performing schools in the state — including Bayside High.

Doesn't that make this a sequel, not a reboot? Or will the two actors in their mid 40's be literally reprising their roles as high school students? Can we get a show about a recast 16 year old Zack Morris getting elected as the governor of California instead? That sounds 90's a fuck."
