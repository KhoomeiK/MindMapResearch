AskReddit,ffgvi3m,t1_ffguo9b,1579916111.0,"Yeah damn I was expecting you to be less reasonable my dude. 

My unspoken point was that, to me at least, I think the real reason that we hear all about toxic masculine and not femininity isn’t due to any actual objective truth or whatever, but is instead just a completely arbitrary and mercurial game of public discourse spinning that the “feminist side” has thus far been winning. This is the onus for the evidence ask. Is the rhetoric the means for disseminating truth or the proof itself?

Many of us think a lot of this stuff is just about power and control and “winning,” wrapped up in emotional and hyperbolic rhetoric that always takes the form of unfalsifiable sacred cows. (Unfalsifiable=can’t ever be proven wrong and sacred cow=you are a heretic if you try). Historically, those aren’t characteristics of strong arguments that can stand on their own. 

PS yes I do empathize with that anecdotal thought, but personally am comfortable with the idea of meaningful biologically driven differences in expression of gender, of which flexibility vs rigidness might be one of. I think the current day attribution of everything gender to social conditioning is far overdone and incorrect."

Like I get that it is something you can say and it might pass a sniff test and it might actually be correct, but also.... it’s completely out of your ass and you know it. None of this stuff has any provable basis in objective reality. It’s anecdotes and platitudes all the way down.

nottheonion,ff3pwqo,t1_ff3obo6,1579546308.0,"We agree more than we disagree! 

Respectfully, my point or belief certainly isn’t that “the free market will solve everything.” That’s blatantly simplifying and mischaracterizing what I said into something I also completely disagree with. And you’re obviously smart enough that it wasn’t an accident. I think all of our conversations could be more interesting if we all deal with the arguments people are actually making in lieu of rhetorical tricks. I’m guilty of this too but trying to do better in 2020.

I’m right there with you that markets are not panacea. No one should be checking Yelp reviews before they call an ambulance. 

What I *was* saying, instead, is that capitalist forces like the profit motive or consumer choice are forces that generally align with increased accountability and quality and efficiency. So on balance, there is less pushing in that direction in a public entity context. We can know this, and accept it, and deliberately build other artificial mechanisms to replace market forces where they can’t be used. We could then redouble our efforts at funding these now more accountable government structures, feeling more confident that it isn’t a bunch of black holes or unfairly inflated salaries passed down nepotistically by the public sector bourgeoisie. 

PS I agree on ultra wealthy. Agree 100% with https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1119985336308912128?s=21 and a supporter of universal income and medical care. I think we’ve tried trickle down for 3 decades and should
try trickle up. I think they’re different issues, we can do both."

nottheonion,ff3kbrg,t1_ff3j8w4,1579542877.0,"Good points, and they absolutely have merit. Will consider. Thanks!

To add though: 

We have to admit that people will often be as lazy as allowed. It’s a fact of all life that the lowest common denominator is an attractive path. 

We therefore need to realize that public entities do lack a big method of accountability and quality control: the market/consumer choice, which companies generally can rely on. And which customers of those companies can rely on. 

There needs to be accountability built into the base DNA of public entities and employees and salaries, and right now there often isn’t. So there’s the question of fair renumeration which maybe yeah let’s get everyone’s higher, but also the question of efficiency and quality of work/service. This is a two way street.

Just “more” isn’t a complete valid analysis of what someone should make. At some point it’s too little at some point it’s too much (if we agree that economics is about the efficient allocation of resources). How do we know when public employees are making too much? There’s no natural feedback mechanism.

In other words: I can’t vote with my wallet if a certain government agency is over paying its employees relative to the quality of work they produce. That is a fundamental difference between public and private entities and tied to my gripe about two tiers of worker currently."
technology,ff3gwmc,t1_ff3df1b,1579540784.0,"Agree with all of that. 

I will say though, if there’s a side of the political spectrum that seems to be embellishing small differences in a toxic way that drives away voters.... well... 

Many loud voices on the left seem happy to exclude anyone that doesn’t 100% agree with them, almost masochistically. Like they’d rather be smugly intransigent and see a Trump re election rather than meet in the middle in any way.

I was listening to the Chapo podcast about the Soleimani strike and they were effusive about the fact that there can be NO nuance or discussion around the legitimacy of it or whatever. That shit does not resonate with me, sorry. There is always nuance, and I get really wary when anyone insists on shutting down discussion. Both seem kindred to the left right now (insisting that there is no nuance, and shutting down discussion). 

The left needs people that broadly agree with it to vote against Trump more than it needs absolute adherence to every dogma and opinion."

technology,ff3alv2,t1_ff38yha,1579537472.0,"Agreed. Thinking of him as the root disease and not the symptom is simplistic and wrong. Trump is an indictment of the right, the left, traditional media, social media... everything.

nottheonion,ff37u11,t1_ff37amc,1579535747.0,"Right but your “business” doesn’t earn profit whereby some of it is used to fund your paycheck. It instead taxes a portion of everyone else’s profits and gives itself a bucket of money to spend each year. 

Doesn’t seem crazy that the people who are out there having to generate said profit would be peeved that those taking some of it to give to themselves decide they should have better pay and benefits than those who fund their existence.

As an anecdote for what I’m talking about check out this lady who earned $125K taxpayer funded salary a year.
