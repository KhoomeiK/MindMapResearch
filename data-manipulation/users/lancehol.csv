There was nothing wrong with me and I didn’t deserve that treatment. 2. I wasn’t stupid. I graduated second to last in high school. I went to college late and completed my degree with a 3.86 GPA. 3.

Afterward I took a short term position providing security for medical inmates who were in hospital for various reasons.  A group of us were watching several inmates in a more secluded part of the emergency room.  One of the inmates had made numerous visits.  After the nurses knocked the guy out with tranquilizer they showed us where he had severed his penis and inserted needles in his testicles.  Crazy stuff.  The inmate was to be extradited to another state for sexually assaulting a child.  It's tragic what people can do to themselves and others.

I thought I was lost and this news came over the radio.  So the whole effect had me creeped out and exacerbated my anxiety on if I was lost in the Yukon bush (I wasn't, they were rebuilding parts of the road and now it's all paved).  I wasn't but as the news progressed it became so shocking.  About 3 years later I was having lunch at the hotel on a business trip.  Afterwards we went down to see where this tragedy happened.

disability,femd814,t3_epplre,1579249528.0,"i found out about this a couple weeks before Christmas.  I've been in a state of panic ever since though the severity has decreased.  I'm 61.  My lumbar spine was injured in 2012 and has degraded over the years.  I cannot walk 20-30 feet using a cane.  I cannot stand more than 2-3 minutes without support.  I had a heart attack in 2017 and filed for SSDI in March of 2018.  I was finally awarded my disability in November of 2018.  Recently in the last couple weeks I contacted Social Security to find out how long they review my case.  I am on a 7 year review which would put me over full retirement by then.  If they change my review date I am terrified at how difficult it will be for me to remain covered.  I have no car to go to any hearing if that's how it's done.  All I can do is make sure my current doctor notates my medical record to make sure everything is covered sufficiently.  Still I'm having trouble sleeping, my stress level is over the top.  I know that if for some reason I were kicked off the SSDI that I paid in over my whole life I would have no where to go.  No money to buy food or medicine.  I would have to give my dogs (who are my life) to someone to make sure they are taken care of.  After that I can only imagine I would be on the street no medicine, no insulin.  I can only think my only alternative should this happen is to take my life.  It's that or a slow death on the streets.  I hate trump with all my being, I hate everyone who is associated with him and I hate the republican party all of whom have not one thought about giving the millionaires and billionaires massive tax cuts but begrudge me of the 1386 dollars I get a month to live on and it takes every penny.  I pray for their extermination.  I know I shouldn't pray for that as I believe it's wrong but it's survival.  I'm sure there are a lot of other people in my shoes or worse and I hope and pray for all of us that the evil in this government is stopped in its tracks but deep in my heart I question whether any higher power cares.  It's all so debilitating.  Last night for the first time I had nightmares about trump and him crowning himself dicktator or king or president for life.  I woke up around 6AM so nauseated I had to hold a trash bag in my hand incase I vomited.  This is not a way to live.  No, not at all!!!"

MorbidReality,fem5qra,t3_ehr0k9,1579240711.0,"I grew up on a family farm.  I was expected to take over.  Mom and dad didn't encourage me to do anything else and then when grandpa and grandma died the land was split with my mom's two brothers and my expected future was over.  My sister and I had to sell the homestead my grandparents build when our dad died in 2010.  I tried so hard to make a life for myself going into deep deep debt being the first in my family to go to University.  I had to leave school  a few short credits from my B.S.  Finally in 2007 I found a excellent job and one that I really enjoyed with my education in earth sciences in the oil field until some drugged up rig hands caused an accident that would leave me presently fully disabled.  It breaks my heart that our farm and homestead are gone.  It also breaks my heart what the people who have family farms are having to live through now.  I hope that people will see the first step to get re-oriented in the right direction with a government that cares is by getting rid of the current administration with their lies, abuse, and sheer incompetence.  Another 4 years of the same and we will not only have no family farms left, we won't have a nation left, at least one that we recognize.  My best hopes for those of you still surviving.

MorbidReality,feltdrp,t3_ekj0ji,1579230460.0,This event is a good argument to use against trumpies.  trump ordered that attack solely to distract from his impeachment.  Consequently the night Iran launched those missiles in retribution somebody in Tehran fucked up and fired missiles at the Ukrainian flight resulting in the horrible loss of life.  So it's basically boiling down to this.  trump is a loose fucking cannon who thinks he is above all law and everything he touches turns to shit.  While the ultimate responsibility for the plane crash is on the back of Iran the trumpies use this to justify the attacks on Iran that have been happening since trump occupied the White House.  Iran isn't the only country that has issues with it's government.  We do as well.  The whole region would be more stable had trump not fucked everything up in regards to the agreement between Iran and western powers in the first place.  Just like he's fucked up relationships with all our allies and other countries we have had agreements with that trump violated.  This story simply shows that Iran isn't the only one that fucked up then lied about it until they couldn't anymore.  I just hope and pray that the insane non-genius piece of shit that occupies the highest office in the land is replaced in Nov. 2020 and we can salvage the fate of our nation before it's too far gone.
