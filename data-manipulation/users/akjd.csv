DestinyTheGame,ffxcly7,t1_ffwggs0,1580322397.0,"Then have a premium season/subscription that costs more up front but comes with a nice discount on silver. People who just want to play and don't care about Eververse stuff get the cheap season, people who only want a couple silver items can do so for not too much, and people who want a bunch of silver stuff can pay more up front but still get the cosmetics for a reasonable price, instead of the ass shredding it is currently.

The first two groups would be unchanged, but you're effectively merging the whales with the people who want to be completionists, but either can't or won't pay the exorbitant prices we have currently. I fall into that group, and I definitely notice that the more things skew towards steep silver prices, the less interest I have in the game. It *will* lose me eventually."
niceguys,ffgtavp,t1_ffgn2x4,1579914512.0,"To be fair I have probably gotten about 75 notifications for people I might know on Facebook over the last couple months, and every single one of them without exception is an attractive woman. Currently they're taking up 5 of my last 10 notifications.

I stopped clicking on them a long time ago because as far as I can tell they're totally random. It's almost like Facebook is trying to sneak their dating thing in, because when I look at my people I might know list, they're mostly men."
ToolBand,ffg2vtz,t1_fffzzr5,1579897279.0,"Yeah, money's really tight for me at the moment, figured the highest I could go was $80 and I wasn't too hopeful, but I ended up getting one for $50 something. Pushing nosebleeds, but that's ok! Last time I saw Tool was in 2006 and I was on the floor but I couldn't see anything anyway cuz I'm a short fuck."
ToolBand,fffl7z7,t1_ffea2qe,1579886370.0,"I have mixed feelings on what to do here. I keep hearing that Tool tends to sell out quickly, so I don't want to wait, but if they don't sell out immediately and tickets go down, it's definitely worth it to wait for a bit. I checked tickets at a different venue just to get an idea, and it was like $30 for nosebleeds at their Jan 31 show. That would be way better than $100+.

I was also thinking in terms of Eugene since it's a smaller metro area, but I don't know if it's proportionately better than the Moda.

Guess I'll just have to check opening prices at both venues and go from there."
ToolBand,ff7z50t,t1_ff7xwuy,1579661836.0,"Fuck. I'm in Salem, was super excited when I heard they were coming, figured since I'm right between Portland and Eugene, I'd have options.

But Portland is in the $200s and Eugene isn't much better, for the cheapest tickets I see. Money is tight at the moment, figured maybe I could swing $70 or $80 or so, but pushing $200? No way, not right now.

Just, fuck."
interestingasfuck,fdsr62t,t1_fdsmtu4,1578706879.0,"The atmosphere is very thick and dense.

Earth and Venus are very close to the same size, but there's just *a lot* more atmosphere on Venus than Earth. To illustrate, nitrogen is the majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%), and only amounts to 3.5% of Venus' atmosphere, but there's still *four times* as much nitrogen on Venus. Overall Venus has around 90 times as much atmosphere as Earth.

The pressure at 50km above the surface is about equal to sea level on Earth."

AskReddit,fcrii9j,t1_fcr6tbr,1577902262.0,"Context and balance really matters. One girl I'd been talking to for maybe a couple of weeks, went to work really early. Sometimes she'd call me on her morning break, wake me up and wish me a good morning. It wasn't all the time, was just a couple minutes, but it was nice, a pleasant way to wake up, and put me in a good mood.

Fast forward a couple more weeks and she's calling me 3 times over the course of an hour while she's out shopping with her mom and sister because she missed me and wanted to hear my voice. That was decidedly less pleasant, and ended up being a factor in me deciding not to pursue anything further with her."
AskReddit,fcp3hi9,t1_fcoxv98,1577849324.0,Would've been half a candy bar in my case. Sounds like a pretty good deal for me tbh.
AskReddit,fclcysz,t1_fcl8chz,1577744938.0,"When I've been on keto, my appetite is significantly reduced. More calorie dense, but also significantly less volume. Works out to less calories overall.

You also gotta consider that, especially at the beginning, the weight that is lost quickly tends to be primarily water weight. So sure, you could be eating at a calorie surplus and still be losing weight, but not fat. That's gonna require a deficit no matter what."
