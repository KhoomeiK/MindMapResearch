Not the absolute best sex I ever had either, but definitely far from the worst. He took advantage of very stimulating positions, and just knew what to do to keep me riled up. That guy definitely knew how to please a woman."
dogs,ffdf6rs,t1_ffddugt,1579819600.0,"I was saying ""unlocks the jaw,"" as in opening the mouth. I know that scientifically a dog's jaw can't actually lock in place.

Also, you can kill or severely maim the attacker if you wish to, but I tend to not want to do that if nonlethal force is an option as a way to save my ass in the court of law. The only time I truly take advantage of lethal force with an aggressive dog is if I am absolutely sure there are already reports on said dog, the dog is a stray/feral, or if the attacker is going after my livestock (agricultural law is far more forgiving)."
dogs,ffddk2s,t1_ffc28vb,1579818625.0,"It works for a one-case scenario, but if the same aggressive dog keeps showing up it's worth to call police/animal control. Most of the time it is a case of somebody's dog escaping their property and attacking only once. Granted, it can take only one attack to kill your dog, but killing the attacking hound when it might belong to somebody can be a setup to legal troubles. I have had folks that have killed a dog attacking their own and that dog belonging to somebody and the owner get into trouble with the law for doing so. Laws are very icky in certain places so I often try to assume the aggressor belongs to somebody unless it's obvious it doesn't. Not to mention not every state like my own has open carry knife/gun laws.

I'm also definitely not a large or very strong individual. I'm 4 foot 10 and skinny, and have successfully used the scruff method on larger dogs. Granted, the scruff method may not work for me if it was an insanely large dog like a Chow Chow or a Tibetan Mastiff, so it's always just safe to have a backup plan. I also never said a dog's jaws can lock."

It also looks at the title and thumbnail. Problem is, I have already figured out that the bots don't often look through the entirety of the video, and it is not backed up manually by a person when said bot flags a video as such. Instead the bot goes through about halfway and is like, ""Well this is good,"" and slaps the child tag on it. What makes it worse is any video that is flagged as child appropriate is automatically thrown into the YouTube Kids app. I can unfortunately see clearly how this can be abused and how it is literally going to turn into another ElsaGate fiasco.

Also, not to mention Don't Hug Me I'm Scared was flagged as child appropriate. Which means it's on the kids app. We also know that even if the community complains and cries for the video to get the child sticker removed, YouTube won't listen until a kid gets traumatized and a mother screams lawsuit. It's fucking horrible."
dogs,ffagjav,t3_esg3ln,1579735227.0,"If you don't want her to open the door I would get a clip baby lock to set high on the door, but still in your reach. (Like those white baby-proofing locks parents put on fridge doors) That would outright curb her just inviting herself into the room if she has learned to open the door.

On the growling aspect, I would train her a command like, ""Down, get down, off, etc."" You can train her by getting her attention with a treat and throwing it on the ground while saying the command, and don't let her on the bed until you are settled. Eventually she'll learn that command without treating."
dogs,ffafo6e,t3_esje72,1579734646.0,"I would invest in a bite stick, but be aware that you can also dislocate a dog's jaw with it (although you might not worry about that if your own dog's life is in danger)

I would NOT suggest doing the wheelbarrow method where you pull the dog by it's hind legs. It's a dog, not a horse, and all its gonna do is shift the attacker's weight to it's front half and possibly put more pressure on the bite. There's also a common myth to poke or stick the attacking dog in the asshole. Doesn't work, won't do anything, especially if the dog is thrashing it's head.

A way I have done and seen others do to subdue an aggressive dog is to grab the attacking dog by the scruff as tightly as possible and to lift it up damn-near until all four feet are off the ground. It unlocks the jaw just long enough for either your dog to get away, for you to pick up your dog if possible, or even just to give enough time to absolutely get away. However, it IS easier if you have another person and works better if one is on a leash and somewhere to quickly tie the dog up. So it isn't always the most convenient option.

So essentially if you are worried about this happening again, I would look into a bite stick and look up YouTube videos on how to use it, and just have it on you every time you go with your dog. Mace is something people sometimes use as well, but it can also hurt you and your dog just as much as the attacker."

dogs,ff7ip5l,t3_es2npz,1579650471.0,"Unfortunately you have no choice. Either euthanize or go to the shelter and court. These laws can not be worked around no matter how great your dog is to you. It is unfortunate, but there is no way around it especially with the neighbor getting such a nasty bite. I would talk to the shelter about why your dog is there so there is extra precautions being made. I am unfamiliar with Virginia law, but I know that in my state a dangerous dog has to be fixed and microchipped. Even if this isn't the law in Virginia, I would do this if you haven't already as it will be more cushion if the dog escapes or shows aggressive signs again.

While the dog is in the shelter, I would check the fencing and make it as escape-proof as humanly possible. Make it tall, make it sturdy, add heavy brickage to the bottom to throttle digging attempts, etc.

I'd also invest in a durable muzzle, and start muzzle training your dog. Make absolutely sure that he has the muzzle on at all times outside the house. I know many owners think muzzles are cruel for the dog and therefore for-go muzzling. BUT once your dog is legally deemed dangerous there can't be room for error, as many places can legally call for euthanasia if too many attacks are reported on that dog. That, again you absolutely can not fight against once that happens. Your dog will 100% be euthanized at that point. So you really don't want to let it get to that point.

So, muzzle train your dog, make sure his rabies vaccination is up to date and have him wear a collar with the rabies tag attached, fix your dog and microchip him. Absolutely upgrade your fence and follow what the state tells you to the core. Even if some of these are not required by law, it will absolutely help you and your dog."

Shelters need funding too, because unfortunately not everyone is willing/can donate to the shelter. The $50 fee is pretty much to ensure food for the other dogs.

AskReddit,ff4f65t,t3_ergjyj,1579562145.0,"Worked at a gas station a few months ago. Was on night shift at the time, and apparently a mentally crazy dude escaped from the nursing home not far from us. Customer comes in and heads to my counter. He told me he had a gun on him. Trying to keep calm, I asked him if the gun was loaded. He said it was. I asked him if he needed anything, and he said no, he just wanted to warm up in the store because he had been walking in the freezing weather.

So because he said he had a gun, I got a coworker to keep an eye at the counter while I headed to the office to make a call to the cop. While I was trying to make the call I hear muffled shouting from the customer and the other two coworkers ran into the office and locked the door. Before I could even say what the hell, the coworker I had on watch duty said, ""He has a knife."" Still trying to keep my panic down, I continued the call and decided to ask questions later. 

The cop was mere minutes away, but those minutes felt like forever. We could here him screaming and shouting, nothing intelligible. We heard him get close to our door, which was behind the counter. He was still shouting, shouting for us to come out and that he wasn't going to hurt us. I thought I was literally going to lose my shit, my coworker silently sobbing beside me didn't help.

Cop came in with his partner, and apparently the guy charged with the knife and was tazed. Twice. Didn't slow him any in the store. I couldn't see anything, as we were told to stay put in the call until police told us it was safe to do so. All I had to go off of at the time was sound. Then I heard a gunshot. Okay, I faltered then. I told my coworkers that I am not coming out there to see a dead body. The man wasn't lethally shot, was shot in the leg just to stop him. 

Needless to say, I worked for a couple weeks after that, and left."

entitledparents,ff2tn3t,t3_epsrmz,1579523676.0,"I personally don't see this family as entitled in any way. They are within their right to work on a house they bought and most places do not allow construction between 8pm to 7am due to noise ordinance laws and safety. Also, you can be the best dog owner in the world and a dog is gonna get loose sometimes. Horses get loose as well. If this has been a one-case thing, it was just an accident.

 I understand horses spook easy. A Wal-Mart bag could even scare a horse, but don't assume these neighbors are automatically out to get you or are entitled because they're regular people with regular lives. If they aren't coming over and harassing you or the horses directly they can honestly do what they damn well please on their property regardless if the farm was there first or not.

Honestly, the only thing I could even suggest is to invest in some noise-cancelling fencing and maybe working on getting the horses used to these kinds of sounds. I know you can never train it out of them completely, but even if it's just to make them not react so violently to it that's progress. It's literally just kind of a, ""live and let live,"" situation. You have neighbors, they have neighbors. It's not a case of who was there first or anything like that. It's seriously just neighbors. They do their own thing. You do your own thing.

I personally don't see Arin ever getting off this horse he has ridden, but I very firmly believe that Dan will be the first to crack, as his engagement has been lack-luster and he's just checked out of it all. Not to mention his band has been making strides the past few years and I just don't see him compromising his 10 year old project to stay on Game Grumps. Music is his main passion after all, and it'd be kind of stupid to give up NSP.

I see this going one of three ways:

- Dan finally gets checked out and sick of Arin enough that he will finally be like, ""I quit. I'm done,"" and disappear quickly like Jon did. Arin will struggle to find a new host and it will probably be someone like Suzy or Allie. (Ross I'm not sure if he would do that.) It will end up being the ""Jon left"" scenario all over again, but with no strong subs or viewers the channel will ultimately either die altogether or fall into obscurity.

- Dan will try to do it right and give a proper send-off, likely stating he wants to concentrate on NSP. Arin likely won't say anything at first, but will ultimately lose Dan as a friend because Arin will likely take it too personally and be pissed off at Dan for ""hurting the show,"" in some way.

- Dan, being the people pleaser, will continue staying on the show for the sake of being the fan favorite. Arin will try to crank it tenfold to make up for lack of his participation. I can see Arin probably getting fed up with it and pissing Dan off enough for him to leave."

Also, symptoms of one mental illness can be shared with another mental illness. So what you THINK you might have might not even what you actually have, because sometimes the only way to tell one illness apart from another is a specific symptom or symptoms that you might not even be thinking about.

Also, about the mental health care... Even if you don't have insurance or don't make a lot, most places are very willing to do a payment plan for expensive appointments if you are self pay.

Also wouldn't hurt to subscribe to some reptile YouTubers if you haven't already, especially if you have quite the collection. They often put up interesting and educational videos.

This may not apply to you right now, as you plan on getting an older beardie, but if you do ever get a young one don't go with a small tank just to save room, they grow very quickly. I suggest on tanks to go for a 55 gallon, or a 75 gallon. For substrate, stay away from sand or that ""Repti-carpet."" Sand can cause impaction and respiratory issues. The carpet, which resembles felt, I have found gets tangled around their little toes or can rip their claws. Some people just use newspaper or paper towels, but I actually bought some cheap vinyl, cut it to size, and set it on the bottom. It is reusable, doesn't hurt the beardie, and easy to clean.

Cleaning is another thing that you do often. I spot clean weekly, and completely clean it once or twice a month. I recommend buying those one dollar broom and dustpans (those miniature ones you can find at the dollar store). They make cleaning easier and more effective. For entire clean-outs I let my bearded dragon out and let him explore my room (I ""reptile-proofed"" it so he can't go into any small cracks and escape). I'll take out his decor and clean them with water and soap, being sure to rinse out any soap that can get trapped, and leave it to dry. I take out his vinyl floor and simply take it outside and rinse it with a hose. For his tank, I'll dilute water with vinegar, and scrub it down and dry it. After all things are dry, I set it back up and put my beardie back in when the vinegar fumes disappear.

So yeah, can I tell them to fuck off I do what I want? Yes. Is it in my best interest? Absolutely not.

My parents aren't worried about the whole, ""Virgin until married,"" thing. They know I am sexually active as an adult, and aren't offended by it just because I live under their roof. However, they had that hard, in-depth sex conversation with me as a teenager more than once. Mostly because they were young once themselves and they knew better than to expect their own kids to wait until marriage. So, instead of becoming increasingly strict with my interactions with ANYBODY, they instead taught me to be safe, and told me what they wish they were told when they were younger. My mom even said that she'd rather be slightly disappointed that I had sex, but proud that I did so safely than to be strict and for me to do it in secret and never know if I was ever safe about it or not.

HOWEVER! As long as I live under their roof, they can tell me no on going to a trip with my bf/gf anytime. If I don't listen to that, I'll be given the boot. They are not doing that in malice, they are just wanting to make sure YOU are safe, and that they are looking out to what is best for YOU. 

You are an adult. You can say no, but I absolutely assure you, even if your parents aren't like mine, that you will not be sleeping underneath their roof no longer and there is nothing you can do about it because you are an adult.

Places will give you even less hours, lay you off, or even put in machines and technology to replace you. Not to mention the general fact that prices of everything will start to rise along with it.

Also, if what you said about the drug test thing is true, that's just sad. If he wants to have a better life, get off the drugs. Restricting yourself to a job that doesn't drug test will ONLY get you minimum wage jobs."

She even told me that they were told about this back in the summer, but it was never announced WHEN it was going to happen, just that it would happen during a meeting.

I'd suggest seeing a school counselor if you have one, or a trusted adult outside of your household. Maybe see if you can look into family therapy. Unfortunately, there is only so much you can do as a 14-15 year old, as you can't even check yourself into a hospital without a parent at that age."

This eventually gone around to everybody, and we were ALL at the front of the cafeteria, angrily telling the staff that we were given years old food, and that they better not be feeding this to the little kids. The staff of course brushed it off, and the high school organized a protest to stand outside the building and refuse to come in the whole day. It ended up being an entire week of us standing outside.

lgbt,fe48oh5,t3_enevk0,1578856846.0,"I have surprisingly gotten positive coming-out stories. (especially with living in rural America in a bible-thumping town) 

My parents I was never scared about coming out to. Ever since I was a child they taught me to only judge a person by their character, never in how they look, believe in, go to bed with. They also practice in what they preached, leading me to meeting very diverse people growing up. This lesson surprises me now in the sole fact that both of my parents were raised by their grandparents, who were born around 1907-1920. Both of my parents have said that their grandparents were very open-minded individuals, with my mom saying her grandmother saw the world change so much that a fight over sexuality or race just wasn't worth it to her. When I had asked why, my mother said that her grandmother stated that a fight over such things wasn't worth it because in the end everybody was affected by change regardless. Her struggles was also their struggles. My dad's grandparents, they just didn't have a mean bone in their body. I believe it, as they were very-much that way when I was a kid.

Thinking about this, I totally shouldn't have been as easily accepted as I was. Rural Christian town with old-world parents raised by their grandparents. However, I am happy to have parents as loving and accepting of me and my siblings. My coming out story was as easy as telling them about my day. I hurt for those who are unaccepted, and if my parents weren't just one person, I'd give everyone the love and acceptance I was given growing up and even today.

Coming out to my friends, was just as easy. Didn't even face judgement from the friend who's an avid Christian. He just said he loves his neighbors, and that everyone lives in sin. He said that he isn't going to banish me just because his sins were different than mine, or that I don't live a completely righteous life. I'm not religious, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't make my eyes watery."

- ""The Black Dog:"" There's an abandoned runway a couple towns over. It was once home to cropduster planes, but due to agricultural advancements it fell out of style. The runway is still there, but again, abandoned. There is no strange backstory, but strange happenings. It's said if you go to the runway in your car, honk your horn twice short and one long, a black canine will appear on the other end of the runway. The creature is said to have glowing eyes, and to be of unimaginable size normal to your average dog. Regardless of whether or not your car is running, the dog will approach your vehicle. It's heavily warned that when he's near to not leave your vehicle, and to lock all doors and roll up all windows. Do not make eye contact or speak to the dog. Do not shut off/turn on your vehicle. Do not move your vehicle. If any of these rules are broken, even for a second, the dog will attack. He has been known to be insanely powerful, tearing through the metal of even the most well-built cars. When he attacks, you'll have no choice but to drive away. If your car is still intact enough to, however. It's said that all people who have fallen victim to the black dog have never been found, not even their cars. However, there have been people who have escaped, albeit with a vehicle gnarled and shredded with claw and teeth marks.

- ""Big Bubba:"" There's a swamp popularly fished out of. It is home to the supposed ""Big Bubba."" It is unknown when this started going around, but anyone who fishes there regularly knows Big Bubba when you say it's name. It was thought that he was actually just a really large 100+ pound catfish caught by a local a few years ago. However, just a couple weeks afterwards, it began again. Big Bubba has been known to drag grown men pole-fishing into the water, straighten out/break the toughest of hooks, and even consuming 7 foot gar to the head. By this time, fishermen were convinced that this was no fish. Sounds like an alligator, right? Well, alligators are non-native. None have ever even been reported or even known to survive past the summer. Bubba, doesn't care what time of the year it is. Even in the winter he will continue his constant chaos, with a man nearly dying from hypothermia after being dragged into the water by him and getting caught in the undercurrent. My family has even searched after him, setting out cable lines, tying them around the toughest of trees, and even using high quality seahooks used to bank sharks. We gave up after he snapped the lines twice, fallen a tree, and completely straightened out 5 of our hooks. Strangely enough, nobody has ever seen him breach the water. Not even seeing a tail. Nobody knows what Big Bubba is."
