college,feilpvr,t3_ep1or8,1579141471.0,"My roommate is big on watching what he eats and working out daily. Me, not so much. Some days he struggles to find something healthy but most days he can find something that is acceptable for his diet. One thing I’ve noticed is that he avoids the salad bar which is a healthy option in my opinion. I’d imagine you will have a salad bar so take advantage of that. I know ours has different meat options on it too like grilled chicken or chicken salad so hopefully you will be able to figure it out. Personally I just eat whenever and how ever much I desire and (thankfully and hopefully it stays this way) haven’t gained any weight as far as I know since being in college. Plus I drink high calorie beer multiple times a week as well. Always been a big eater so not much has changed and honestly I do occasionally skip meals but I think my metabolism is high so that’s what keeps me from being overweight."
personalfinance,feei9ak,t3_eomsbc,1579034293.0,"Recently got my first credit card. I’m a 19 year old male. “Shopped” around for a while and decided to get a secured card. I know Chase has secured card options but I got a capital one card. 

Some advice I’d give is to make a credit karma account. She will already have an account to keep track of her credit and they have a lot of resources. Credit Karma showed me the cards that were the best fit for me and ones I was likely to be accepted for after applying."
college,fe6cjkd,t1_fe6c8gb,1578886984.0,Sure does.
college,fe6c5a4,t3_envjls,1578886686.0,"I agree. Didn’t even think about buying books over winter break and didn’t factor it into my expenditures for the semester. Got back and thought to myself “damn, I’ve got to buy books” and as luck had it, nearly all of my classes required a $100+ access code or a $100+ book. Asked around and had some people tell me for two of the professors I don’t need to purchase the book so that’s a plus I suppose."
guns,fdm5dk6,t1_fdlzx5l,1578540198.0,"My plan was just to have it as a backpack/truck gun and something to go to the range with some buddies and shoot for fun. 

Hearing a lot about it being uncomfortable when shooting. Maybe I’ll test one either just in my hands at a store or try a friends. Figured it wouldn’t be the best as far as being a regular shooter but I mostly just go to the range for fun and shoot targets with my buddies from college after class. Probably better off investing into something of higher quality plus the compact/folding isn’t a necessity."
guns,fdlx96k,t1_fdlstng,1578534687.0,That’s what I’ve heard. Just wanted something fun to shoot at the range. Obviously not gonna use it for more “intensive” things. Maybe as a backup in the truck or something. Heard the trigger isn’t the best and some of the earlier models have sight issues.
guns,fdlx2z8,t1_fdlswnf,1578534573.0,"That’s what I was thinking. Just something to shoot a few rounds with at the range and something small to keep in a backpack, etc."
guns,fdlsu2t,t3_em233s,1578531671.0,"Saw one of these in a YouTube video and it caught my attention. Looks like a cool gun. Been watching reviews and whatnot but wondering if any of y’all have any experience with them? 

Nice little folding carbine rifle."

Too specific."
marketing,fdh503t,t3_eldv8q,1578415508.0,"Fellow Marketing Student here. Definitely saving this and hoping some experienced folks in the marketing industry will weigh in. 

I’m hoping to find an internship this summer to get a little experience or at least be around the marketing work environment. I’m currently a freshman so my experience (or maybe knowledge is a better way of putting it) isn’t quite up to par yet and I’m hoping to capture skills, especially those modern day marketing industry professionals need. 

I had a professor this past semester. Required class for all business majors. It was “Business Analysis using Spreadsheets” and he really pushed Microsoft Excel. He was experienced in the business world and said that a lot of employers in the business industry requested that my university teach more about Excel because many students weren’t “fluent” and it was something used a lot in the workplace. 

Looking forward to more responses from experienced industry professionals."
southcarolina,fddo1rt,t3_ekqn50,1578319188.0,Definitely recommend Lake Jocassee. Very beautiful area with great scenery. Charleston area is nice as well. I enjoy Charleston because I’m a big history fan and there’s so much history down there!
