dogs,ffj6672,t1_ffj4mel,1579991394.0,"Yeah I mean Hitler liked animals too, and he's way fucked up. I do hope they didn't do anything. The vets are closed tomorrow anyway so I can only wait and see. If she's still all good, I'll rest the case. Honestly, I wouldn't know what to do without my dog. She's the main reason why I'm still going on. And 2020's gonna prove itself to be a horrible year if she met her end. So much shit has happened already and it's still January lol"
dogs,ffj5kyn,t1_ffj42jr,1579990966.0,"They left after 3 minutes when they were back downstairs to make their exit. They spent 30 upstairs. They had the right tools to cut our window grills open (a couple years ago some people tried doing this too but their tool wasn't strong enough) and even picklock our backdoor. 

But yes the electronics part is still weird af to me. They didn't even grab the switch or 2 phones on the table which are rather small. Maybe they only wanted to sell jewellery and not go through the process of resetting electronics to sell? If that's how it works.. They also headed straight to my parents' probably with jewellery in mind? 

I guess if my dog's still alright on Sunday, then I'd know they aren't *all* evil."
dogs,ffj4h23,t1_ffiu1j7,1579990159.0,"I was relieved when he gave her the cookies because distractions, but after watching the video a few times, it seemed unnecessary to 'distract' her in the first place. She just stayed at the sofa the whole time, even when they went back downstairs. But the dude took the next step to climb on the sofa to see if she's there, then drop the cookies out of the tin. It's just such an odd move to me. So I thought what if they went out of their way to poison her because they could be that evil and immoral. 

My friend's neighbour gave meat with rat poison to her pregnant cat because they didn't like cats. Just plain evil. I don't think it's crazy that a robber would do it..."
dogs,ffj3al9,t1_ffixly2,1579989304.0,"They're robbers who have stalked us for who knows how long. They'd know we have a dog and would be prepared if she ends up being too much of a nuisance. It's sadly not uncommon here and it's happened before. Besides, watching the cctv I thought it was unnecessary for them to 'distract' my dog because she didn't even bother coming out from the sofa when they were back downstairs. He went out his way to climb on top the sofa, check if the dog's there, then drop the cookies. Is that not strange? 

I mean, I guess they could potentially be immoral people who likes animals and *maybe* decided to give treats for not causing issues with their scheme. But at the same time they could just want to kill a dog for the hell of it."
dogs,ffj1hom,t1_ffioxss,1579988019.0,"Robbers usually stake out your house and schedule for days or even weeks. They'd know we have a dog and would probably come prepared if the dog happened to be vicious. It's not uncommon here for people to do that. And yes sadly it's happened to other people before. My first thought watching the cctv was, thank god they just distracted my dog with cookies and didn't abuse her. 

But tbh, I thought the cookie part was weird because my dog didn't even bother coming out from the sofa when they were back downstairs and about... It's like they took an unnecessary step to give her cookies! And that's when the poison thought came in."

Showerthoughts,fen94td,t1_felzckw,1579279669.0,I have a scar across the length of my middle finger. I flip people off when I show it. They don't realise it at first because the scar is on the side of the finger.

wholesomememes,fefbmsw,t1_feefe7p,1579052759.0,"I broke down crying last night just thinking about how bland my life is. I was beside my dog and she started nudging my arm with her snoot to put it over her. Every time I had my arm off her to wipe my face, she'd do it again. If I moved to another spot, she'd come over and nudge again. I went to bed a few times and she'd bark. I thought she wanted to pee/poop but she never did when I brought her out. She finally stopped her shenanigans when I was distracted enough by her and couldn't drown in my thoughts. Without her around, I'd usually cry for 3-6 hours straight, but with her distractions it comes down to less than 30 minutes. Dogs are too precious."
rarepuppers,fecervf,t1_featlxs,1578972188.0,This is my dog. She wouldn't accept treats from the vet. Then I try feeding the same treat later and she eats it. She's always super scared and nervous at the vet :(
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe6qsjg,t1_fe55qxm,1578901027.0,My dog too likes sneezing (not all the time) after a series of barks or whimpering like that. It's so strange and hilarious
IDmydog,fdv79y0,t1_fdqhuc0,1578744128.0,That's interesting. Black labradoodles with straight fur look really similar too. I hope my DNA kit manages to come before it's too late. I've always thought she was some Terrier mix
cats,fduhucy,t1_fdttp5u,1578733229.0,"That's only if the rock is lucky enough to end up on the surface of the poop though. If it was somewhere in the middle of the poop ball, all is lost..."

IDmydog,fdpgr2b,t3_emlarm,1578628198.0,"She's also going to be turning 12 this November. She was given to us by my dad's friend when she was ""around 5 weeks old"", but probably WAY younger because she still needed milk and be bottle fed. Thankfully the vets helped us through it!  

Honestly surprised she's still going on healthy because we have no knowledge of her bloodline or genetics, etc. at all.

Edit: one of the [youngest pics](https://i.imgur.com/lgNVQhw.jpg) I have of her"
cats,fdp8jg3,t1_fdnh108,1578622507.0,"Lol let me join you! I've always wanted to do that, but for dogs as well. I'd also want to adopt all the oldest ones from other shelters and just make them feel like heaven before they go :("
cats,fdmtd7g,t1_fdlyff7,1578564842.0,"I foster cats and kittens whenever I can. I try to stick to cats though because kittens are *too* distracting. Ended up not doing uni work for 3 days straight because CUTE PLAYFUL KITTENS! So I go for kittens when I'm on holiday

Anyway. Once I made the horrible decision to visit the shelter's adoption section. It was so hard and painful to just turn away... There was one black cat that kept playing with me through the small opening they had in their enclosures. And he would meow at me too... Too sweet... I would've totally adopted him if my situation allowed it :'("
dogs,fdmt5n9,t1_fd3k8p7,1578564536.0,"Just thought I'd give an update that I bought RC Mobility C2P a few days ago, and my dog ended up liking it! Even going as far as to eating it off the ground if some kibble accidentally falls. It's expensive af, around twice more expensive than the average food, but I guess that's what happens if it's a specialised vet diet! Although, to be fair it's just my currency that's small... (4x smaller than the US) lol

I am so relieved now though!"
dogs,fd6l7dh,t1_fd3so1i,1578192650.0,"Hm my dog never had any significant changes, so nothing was alarming me. I've decided on what to get and hope I can find it available here though!"
dogs,fd6keln,t1_fd3qog2,1578192348.0,"Tbh it naively didn't cross my mind that my dad switched to GF food since we've never bought GF food before! And she isn't allergic to anything AFAIK. But I should've known since he falls for marketing schemes and superstitions all the time ugh. Really glad I found out before it was too late. 

I think the raw diet is the only fad I was really leaning into and had me convinced was better, but for my future dog. It's been getting more and more popular though. Who knows how it'd be years later"

dogs,fd3jlpw,t1_fd3cxz9,1578158967.0,I've been reading from them! Wish I found the site months or even years earlier.
dogs,fd3jc39,t1_fd3a7zz,1578158886.0,"Oh thanks for informing me about that procedure. Just did a quick search and got a shock at the cost of it. Now I really hope 2 years on GF food hasn't done any damage... 

And I didn't know you could get dog food samples. I hope it's a thing in my country. That would make thing so much easier for my picky dog. Sadly she isn't a fan of Purina Pro Plan, Iams or Eukanuba (lol please tell me it is coincidence they are big brands!) so I think I'll try searching for the Royal Canin Mobility C2P this time around. I've been reading good reviews about their specific veterinary diet line, so I'm getting hopeful. In the end it all goes down to my dog liking it or not.."
dogs,fd3fw9t,t1_fd3byc4,1578157912.0,"That's what I've told her- I doubt the people working for those big brands want to poison the food and kill dogs. I guess it's disheartening to find out a close friend who I go to for advice doesn't see it the same way, just kinda throws the rhythm off!"
dogs,fd3cm61,t1_fd31thf,1578156897.0,"Royal Canin is actually really popular here with some retailers. I'm hoping I can at least find their vet diet here for joint care. If I do I'll hop onto that since I've heard people saying those really work. And hopefully my dog would like it. She doesn't like Purina Pro Plan and Eukanuba so those are sadly out. 

Do you know any other brands that are good options too? Or should I try different grain-inclusive brands and just see what my dog likes? I'm heading to a pet store tomorrow just to see what I can find in person.

There's my friend who's so against the big brands and keep saying to NEVER get them. I know she loves her dog as much as I do, I usually go to her for advice too because she's reasonable, so this makes me rather conflicted lol"
dogs,fd2rysp,t3_ejwjf1,1578151086.0,"My dog actually prefers sleeping on the floor rather than the bed. I've tried many times telling her to come up on the bed. She eventually goes down within a few minutes... 

When she decides it's time to pee and eat, and just has to come to my side of the bed. I somehow, magically, automatically wake up. She's literally the only one that can wake me up without really making a sound. It's a miracle because I'm a deep sleeper who can sleep through my brother playing drums.

Rarely if I don't wake up quick enough she'll softly whimper or more rarely, bark."
