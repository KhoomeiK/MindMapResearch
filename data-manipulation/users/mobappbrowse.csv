AskReddit,ffqzugv,t1_ffqtafl,1580147352.0,">	On the other hand, why does every single person get their behavior excused as mental illness, even when it’s just general assholishness like this?

It’s absurd to say that everyone gets there behavior excused by mental illness. I’m not even making excuses for anyone’s shitty behavior.  Bad behavior is bad behavior and should have consequences. 

>	But also, a lot of people are just selfish or weren’t brought up right. Some people are just assholes, and it’s ok to feel righteously indignant about them.

There’s nothing inherent about a person that makes them selfish or an asshole. It’s all learned behavior and it can be addressed. You can understand why someone is an asshole and it doesn’t mean you, on an individual level, have to accept or excuse their behavior. But, as a society, we can address the problem with these people and correct it. 

Everything we, generally, consider bad behavior is a social construct. Anyone who consistently violates those rules is mentally ill. That’s not an excuse, that’s understanding. If we understand the problems and de-stigmatize mental health issues we can address them."

It’s strangely satisfying to read stories of bad behavior and feel righteously indignant. Reddit is addicted to it. And, there’s value in people being able to express the shit they went through and have others support them. 

The people being shitty rarely get the attention they need—because they’re being assholes and no one wants to deal with them. It’s like we only treat the symptoms and not the disease."

news,fedrmqe,t1_fedngxl,1579018407.0,"I disagree. If someone cajoles, pressures a homophobe into killing a homosexual they can and should be held liable. 

If you can show that someone’s words were instrumental in motivating someone to commit a crime, they can be held liable. It’s incitement[incitement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement). 

>	The [US Supreme Court] ruled that incitement of events in the indefinite future was protected, but encouragement of ""imminent"" illegal acts was not protected.

Suicide is illegal and his suicide was imminent at the time that she encouraged him to do it. 

There’s a difference, established legal difference, between telling someone “oh, go kill yourself” and cajoling someone who you know is ready to do it to go ahead and do it already. 

In the first instance the person is just an immature asshole and if they did enough would be guilty of harassment. In the second they are inciting that person to commit the crime. 

The law is capable of making this distinction without running afoul of the First Amendment."
