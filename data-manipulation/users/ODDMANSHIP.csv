socialanxiety,fehll12,t3_eovvz9,1579119016.0,same...went to try to get a job today at a store. I misunderstood something and ended up accidentally asking for the manager's personal number trying to get a hold of her. I was so anxious that I forgot that's something a normal person wouldn't do and now she thinks I'm a creep. Yikes.

AmItheAsshole,fdz03ps,t3_en6jau,1578785378.0,"no, you're not the asshole. Bullying is a very serious problem, which needs a very serous counter measure. I'd say that a lot more needs to be done though than banning her from parties, the root of her behavior needs to be discovered and addressed, or it most likely will not be resolved."

depression,fdsev7a,t1_fdrxc3g,1578701117.0,"it definitely wasn't my fault, however...sometimes I let it turn me into someone i don't want to be. Someone who's distrusting and paranoid, quick to assume other people intentions. I guess that's hard part, haha."
depression,fdruwbh,t3_emnbdm,1578690167.0,"It's my belief that ""broken"" is a term we use relative to other people. I think you're very strong. It seems you have your daughter in mind despite it all. Keep it that way. It seems you maybe the only functional parent she has left. Keep going for her."
