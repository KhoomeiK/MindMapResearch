My ultimate point, and the one that many others have pointed out is that while c-sections can be more dangerous to women \*in the moment\* and right after birth, they have less risk overall of long-term complications to bladder and fecal control, and uterine/organ prolapse. A tough birth recovery is one thing- the point is that you recover, even if it takes longer than that of a vaginal birth.
