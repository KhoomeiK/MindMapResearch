About my other post, are you referring to the art that I posted on r/melanime? Well, It's not mine, but I have to write \[Original\] on the title because It's an original character that the artist created, It's not from any anime, game or something y'know. Sorry for the confusion, I can't draw like that, sadly :|"
depression,fejzy0j,t1_fejh2i0,1579189639.0,"Sorry, I know how you feel cuz I had a group of friends who agreed between them to disappear like this. I managed to find one of them, but I was ignored when I asked. To this day I don't know what happened... Since then, I've given up on making new friends and isolated myself. After a while I tried over and over but failed with everyone. I gave up again until this girl showed up and became my friend and I didn't have to do anything."

I hate myself and I've always depended on other people, it's like I'm only half and always need someone else to complete me, you know?

depression,fejyniq,t1_fej00ya,1579188833.0,"Well, I'd rather stay at home, but even if I wanted to play a sport, I can't because I have some problems that prevent me, without giving many details y'know"

depression,feikhw6,t1_feiissg,1579140642.0,"I dunno how to get into one in the country where I live, and also if I would like either. I'd rather stay at home, I just leave when I have to go to school. Sorry, I'm pretty ignorant about these things haha I'll be lost when I grow up, and that's one of my biggest fears. That's why I need someone so much to stand by my side and guide me, you know?"

depression,feihmcq,t1_fehwu94,1579138731.0,"Sorry... I know how hard it is.

Sorry, I don't think I need to talk right now, I'm bad at this stuff and it's kinda impossible to help me right now, the language barrier doesn't help much either, I need to think for a long time and sometimes use Google Translate to write decently in English, but thanks \^\^"

I haven't heard about Pen Pal before, but I don't think it's available in the country where I live. Dunno if that would be enough for me too, but thanks anyway :)"
