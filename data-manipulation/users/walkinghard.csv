It depends on so many factors as well. A book called 'Whole Again' helped me a lot with understanding why I hated myself, even if it was through pride-based identifiers to count the shame-based identifiers.

Childhood trauma (can be emotional, neglect) is often a reason for  this. I'd wager a lot of people in these self improvement groups in some way were traumatized by childhood events. 

Creating those good habits is hard, and it also requires you to cut down on the bad habits and on the toxic behaviors/mindsets.

Mindfulness, yoga are good to help center you. Self-compassion is super important too. 

And next time you feel like shit and your thoughts run rampant with negativity: try just sitting still, closing your eyes and noticing your feelings. Any thoughts that appear you answer with a compassionate lens. For example you think ""Fuck, I'm not good enough"" answer with a mindful thought of ""You are good enough, and you always will be"".

This shit takes practice and time. Patience too. 

I've felt a lot more liberated since I started doing this. Dealing with all this shit is hard, but we can all do it. 

Self-comparison is super important too; compare to your past self. Not your fantasy self or any others. Also realize you only see the parts of them that your shadow self wants to see, it feeds into your shame. It's often a self-perpetuating cycle of self hatred that exists to 'protect' you from connection.

I seriously recommend books on the topics of self love and mental childhood trauma specifically if you think it may be relevant. 

Since I started with this stuff, I've becoming more loving to myself and others. It's a slow process, and it has ups and downs, but I can see the light and it gives me a lot of hope. Bad days will always happen, accept that and be kind to yourself.

I wish you a lot of luck, you can do this. You have the inner strength, that's a fact of life. Finding it is the challenge you're faced with.  PM me if you want to talk more."

I'll give you my anal virginity."

Games,feh8k7o,t1_fegcv4b,1579111372.0,"I finished it the first time, but didn't the second time. I literally didn't want to finish because it makes the rest of the game feel a lot more bland :D."
CPTSD,fe9laj8,t1_fe9ial8,1578939014.0,"Hell yeah! Keep it up. Our inner critics' worst fear is for us to heal and improve, they want us to falter and give meaning to their existence. 

Like a shadow, bathing it in light will make it fade away. 
<- Okay, that sounds cringy as hell to me haha, but in light of the context I'm leaving it up."

aww,fe433ww,t3_enos20,1578855311.0,Charlie's a tactical genius. Going for the flank I bet.
selfimprovement,fe3oz1k,t3_eno12m,1578851478.0,"Probably 'Whole Again'. If you've dealt with trauma in childhood or in a really toxic relationship (think abuser/cheater etc.) then this book is apt for you. 

The concept of a 'core wound', 'toxic shame' and a 'protective self' have changed basically everything in how I view myself and others. The realization of trauma and healing of it suck, but it's as 'self improvement' as it gets."
selfimprovement,fe2244n,t3_enbpob,1578833692.0,"The heartbreak for sure sucks. Many of us are there too, right now. Like us, you can do this.

First and most important step is healing. This includes taking the time to feel and grieve. You'll make mistakes, practice self-compassion. It's so important to forgive. Practice self-awareness too, it helps a lot in identifying what went wrong from both sides. 

Quit your bad habits. It's okay to relapse now and then, forgive and try again. And again. And again until it sticks. Intent is important as heck here. 

Like others have said - hit the gym. Since my break up I've been working out pretty insanely and it's been great. Pick up new hobbies if you can, as well. (I started a sport called Padel, pretty nice even though I suck right now :D) 

Build up/rebuild your social life as best you can. I've been meeting new people and it's been wonderful! I forgot how nice it is to connect.  Eventually, this is also the best way to find new love eventually, when you're ready of course.

And any cheap/free hobbies I'd recommend: writing/reading/drawing. I've begun an old dream of writing stories, and it's actually fucking awesome to engage in a passion proactively! 

Learning new skills is cool too, there's tons of courses online/irl that you can follow even just occasionally to slowly improve your repertoire. 

Oh, and if you're bothered by mental/physical stress - meditation and yoga are great.

Just one more thing: Don't regret your time together. Regret that they gave up on you, but don't regret what you had. At worst it's an experience that'll help you become a better man, an opportunity to become stronger than you've ever been. Good luck."
television,fdo2amo,t1_fdnkxve,1578597579.0,"Indeed!

One of the shows where it literally just gets better and better every season, and the change of pace and focus does a lot towards that improvement."
BreakUps,fdnzhcl,t1_fdnye4w,1578595998.0,"Thanks for the kind words friend. And I'll try to consider that. Never really had faith in much having been a cynical bastard before. Trying to be more positive now and believing in myself and my path sounds pretty damn nice.

Good luck on your own journey as well."
BreakUps,fdnxh5i,t1_fdnw4cq,1578594832.0,"Appreciate it! I learnt about inner child healing and it's definitely something I try to work on. Some days I forget because I've been trying to keep busy :p

My inner child loves that woman so goddamn much though, thinking about it as her hurting him is a bit strange that way."
BreakUps,fdnvxc8,t1_fdng8ac,1578593931.0,"Yeah makes sense. I'm almost like a schizophrenic when it comes to feeling okay with myself. Sometimes it's all good, I can feel pride in my healing work and self improvement. Other times I feel like an impostor and that my value is nonexistent without her, it's a shit fucking feeling. 

Attention is nice, but it's not the attention I want right now, so I'll wait a bit. Thanks for your take."
BreakUps,fdnvjg8,t1_fdnep13,1578593705.0,"Yeah, I'm noticing a similar feeling. 

Honestly, I posted here looking for your opinion. I can't move on quite yet, but moving forward works. 

Cheers for your advice."
selfimprovement,fbxszm6,t3_ef0tue,1577199697.0,"Gotta disagree here. Certain character traits in some people were born out of necessity, due to traumatic experiences for example. Changing these traits can be incredibly beneficial to grow as a person.

No one is stuck in their ways, you can change everything about yourself and there's nothing wrong with that. As a very negative person I'm trying to be more positive, because however you spin it, one is simply a lot more fulfilling than the other and will lead to more happiness. 

What makes 'you' you is who you decide you are, and what you aim for."
