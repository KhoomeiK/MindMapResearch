addiction,fekr4gr,t1_fek3za4,1579205879.0,"Altered states make you feel good, or better. They make you feel like you just went home to mommy after a long day and she welcomes you with a warm hug and says “everything is gonna be alright”. But with drugs it’s more like “everything’s gonna be alright,, for the next couple hours at least. And then it’s gonna be hell after that, unless you use more...” and then it just bottles up. 

For me, I guess I’d say loneliness is what attracts me to being in an altered state. It fills the void in my head, and allows me to think in ways I’d never think if I were sober, and that comes in handy being a musician. But it becomes a problem when I have a hard time connecting with the world because it heightens my anxiety"
