I also love the rest of your face, how it's natural, and not heavy on the contour or the highlight. It's a beautiful look."

Just a small  point about your description: I don't know if your wife feels this way, but if someone told me that something they bought me was made from lamb skin, i would feel bad. It's a small distinction, but I personally would feel more comfortable owning something made from sheep skin.  Of course your wife may not feel the same way!"

Also, now i kind of want to see it where all the surfaces that would have been inside the guy are red..."

silentmoviegifs,ffwje1s,t3_evl4tm,1580302938.0,That's so cool that it's all physical effects! (It didn't occur to me that it's slides and not full-sized set pieces because I'm not that smart.)
