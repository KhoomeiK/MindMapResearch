You need to have like a 400 word novella to accompany your picture.

But what? That’s when I saw an advertisement from my local AD for a Tudor. My grandfather always wore a watch so I though to myself, “what a story this could tell!” And then I was done. I never picked up another cigarette again. But I promised myself I would save the money I spent killing myself and put it away for this fine Swiss craftsmanship. And I’ve finally got enough. After a quick trip to the doctor today I’m stopping by my ad (who groans at the sight of me now) to finally pick it up! Wish me luck boys, I’ll be sure to wear it in good health.”
