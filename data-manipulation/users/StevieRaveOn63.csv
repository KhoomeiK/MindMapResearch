I was holding and petting him (as well as crying all over him) and as I slid my hand down his side, I felt a palm-sized lump over his ribs.  (And, I stopped right here for a few minutes typing this... first few spent freaking out, then I calmed down enough to google it and now, I know more than I did before about lipomas.)  

I haven't been in the best head space the last day or so (pft, last 56 years or so, truthfully)- obviously or I wouldn't have clicked into this thread- and this is just too much.

I'll do whatever needs to be done for him in a way I can't find the strength to help myself.  And, ya know what?  In a way, it makes sense to me.

If it wasn't the first day he was home, it was within just a couple of days, he drank something like 10 Redbulls one after the other from when he got up until he pitched face first off the back step, dead before he hit the ground some time in the afernoon.

""Basically, his heart exploded"", is what I was told.  He was 47.

FWIW, I kind of think he messed up like River Phoenix did.  Only with Redbull.  He didn't know that his tolerance level had gone down in rehab and that his body wouldn't be able to handle the same amounts of whatever he did as before.  I honestly don't think he did it on purpose.
