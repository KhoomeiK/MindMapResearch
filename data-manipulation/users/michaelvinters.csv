explainlikeimfive,ff7hfwu,t3_es2wge,1579649631.0,"A thousand different ways. People looking to supress certain categories of voters will do things that make it harder for those type of people to vote. For example, purging registrations of people who haven't voted recently (favors people who vote in non-presidential elections), requiring a specific photo ID (suppresses people who don't drive, who are overwhelmingly urban dwellers), or underfunding polling places in certain districts (leads to long lines and discourages voting in those districts) are all common.  Basically anything that makes it harder to vote is going to disproportionately affect some people more than others. 

Generally the excuse given is that they're trying to make it harder for people to commit fraud, though study after study has shown that individual voter fraud is not even remotely a problem (there is very little upside to voting illegally, and tremendous downside to doing it in the form of harsh criminal penalties)."

Its more like he's trying to energize voters and activate new voting blocks, where someone like Clinton (both of them) or Bush was more about not offending people.  Obama's electoral power came from the fact that he could energize some voters by virute of who he was (a young, charismatic black man) while not alienating a significant 'swing' demographic (affluent suburban voters). 

Using this paradigm, Sanders is betting on a combination of activating young and leftist voters, swinging some traditional working class Republicans/independents, and not alienating the people who just hate Trump. And Trump won by activating a core Republican block (socially disaffected white voters) while depressing or swinging another block that may have gone to Clinton (less politically active moderates) by relentlessly attacking her."

Unlike Omni above, I disagree, af least regarding bringing people together.  It's not always obvious from the discourse arouns Sanders, especially from some of his more vocal supporters, and the media that covers him, but he is explicitly trying to bring together large chunks of voters from other candidates. Including Trump voters. He talks about it regularly. Polls show him with a lot of support as a second choice for Biden supporters. Unfortunately it gets lost in the coverage, in large part because he isn't playing along traditional party divisions. (Instead of courting suburban 'swing' voters, which is the kind of 'reaching out' Obama did, he believes he can speak to working class people who would usually vote Republican and get them to jump to his side)."

Basically, if Warren dropped out the race would presumably swing towards Bernie (though Buttigeg would get a boost too).

1-345: literally every other coach

346: Coach K

347: this guy"

TheRinger,fbwbft7,t1_fbhqn7j,1577145527.0,Eh...I think he votes for Democrats but I wouldn't consider him a lefty by any definition. And plenty of owners support unions in theory but don't want their employees in one.
TheRinger,fbwbb1d,t1_fbn1knf,1577145429.0,"If he knows that, the union will too, becsuse he will tell them that during negotiations. Despite their reputation, the union wants to stay in business just like ownership does. Fewer jobs means fewer members of their union."
TheRinger,fbwb3x0,t1_fbjhatk,1577145285.0,"That's a reasonable take, but I would also point out that much larger corporations make that exact ""we're a family, and we treat our employees well"" argument against unions forming at their businesses. 

Regardless of how well employees are treated, they're still employees, and they have a right to bargain collectively if they think that will help them professionally. Anti-union is anti-union, regardless of ownership's anti-union argument."
TellMeAFact,fbt2yds,t3_ee348v,1577066908.0,"His dark past preceeds the stuff you mention...he was a hooligan and a bully even as a child. But he also had a very rough childhood with an absent father and a purportedly 'wild' mother and they made him choose between them at a young age (he chose his mother, his dad disappeared more or less for good, though his mother was evidently not exactly the model of responsibility either and he was largely rasied by an aunt). 

He was also well aware of his demons (a large part of how we know his bad deeds was that he wrote songs about them: ""I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved"") and reportedly worked earnestly to become a better person."
