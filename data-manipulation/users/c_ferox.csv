bestof,ffq572d,t1_ffpsx0r,1580121132.0,"aren't the numbers for large donors quite low for both sanders and warren? i mean considering that large donations will naturally skew proportions of funding pretty quickly, and if you compare to the other candidates, around 18% and around 30% don't seem so high. also the our revolution thing seems like it isn't actually part of sanders' campaign. i mean if an org decides they want to back a candidate, should the official campaign tell them to stop? honest questions, it's the first time i'm reading about this so i'm curious"

actuallesbians,feokbbz,t3_epzqvv,1579301394.0,i had this exact interaction once and we ended up making out in a toilet stall
CorporateMalfeasance,feojhk1,t3_eq0tr9,1579300938.0,anyone have more sources? would like to triangulate
CorporateMalfeasance,feog4nz,t3_eq15ma,1579299618.0,of course he does
YouShouldKnow,fehq9jb,t1_fegyhdl,1579121720.0,"i agree it's a little elitist unless you are into world politics. most people are fine just knowing what their neighbour countries are and a bit of the history between them. beyond that look at countries whose politics might affect you, like the US and russia if you're euro"
TrollCoping,fegmdqu,t1_fefsump,1579097156.0,you could try into a pillow to muffle it maybe? or is that not allowed?
SelfAwarewolves,fedyc6n,t1_fedancx,1579022475.0,"well even the liberals and centrists push for privatisation where im from, so yes the trend is worrying"
SelfAwarewolves,fedy8md,t1_fedlsik,1579022415.0,"studies have shown there is in fact greater social mobility in many european social democracies than in the US, so no maybe not rich, but with real room for improvement. at least when the studies were conducted, who knows now"
SelfAwarewolves,fed4dux,t1_fed1ehy,1578998262.0,"european politics is not american politics. as a rule of thumb, assume conservatives are centrist or moderate on social issues and fiscally conservative. and liberals are not on the left generally."
AskAnthropology,fduo8cj,t3_en12do,1578736163.0,look up agroecology. the basic principle is to treat the agricultural system like it's a natural ecosystem. altieri is one of the big names for getting started
aww,fdqk77d,t1_fdphwik,1578668662.0,"its a super cute idea, but donating to organisations working on the ground is more effective, and in these climate crisis time mailing knitting across the planet is frankly counterproductive. i dont know how to phrase this more kindly, i just think its important. when it comes to emergency aid, efficiency and impact have to come first"
photography,fdqhm23,t3_empqy3,1578666877.0,"depends where you are. laws about consent are stricter in EU if publishing, but in US iirc it's something like can they reasonably expect privacy at that location. correct me if im wrong. maybe find a way to inform people that they can talk to you to opt out. eg ask the organiser if you can put up a sign."
Nordiccountries,fdq6tp9,t1_fdq2pyh,1578657365.0,this is true. our welfare is being privatised at alarming rates
truechildfree,fdq5xeu,t1_fdq2zna,1578656290.0,"as a queer woman, im not sure i would equate someone telling me to eat asparagus or that i will change my mind about children with being told i need the right dick. the former are annoying yes, but the latter is an unwanted sexual comment that would make me feel unsafe. i would prefer to make a difference even if it is a scale of unwelcome."

AskAnthropology,fddflgq,t3_ekp2id,1578310067.0,"i think the advice is different depending on the specific work you want to go into. a former colleague went into NGO work with her anthro background, but she had years of experience in project management from a non-profit she helped start. for journalism, relevant experience would be in communications i'm guessing. it seems you already know that GIS is a useful niche, so i suppose the advice is to make a decision on what job you want and begin building the relevant resume for it in a way where you fit the basic qualifications first, and then present your specific and unusual background as a bonus."

bestof,fclrpko,t3_ehrlaz,1577754846.0,add to this that mercenary company aegis was found to have recruited former child soldiers in sierra leone and sent them to iraq. they were unemployed and cheap. theres a video in a danish documentary film iirc where you see these men break down and cry as they hold a gun again for the first time since putting it down as a child. they would refuse but they cant afford to. this has undone years of rehabilitation work in the country. and this is just one case - there are many contractors out there these days as warfare gets increasingly privatised.
