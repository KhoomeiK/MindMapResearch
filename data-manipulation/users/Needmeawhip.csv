Ive played League for two years and got so toxic i actually started hating the game after a while, i enjoy overwatch too but i have no one to play it with. 

Problem with this is that i do really enjoy going fishing in the summers or playing games from time to time. Its just that right now, my only friend that i play games with isnt online and none of my other friends are ever down for anything."

energydrinks,fg0lpk0,t3_ewa018,1580410319.0,"Id call it something catchy. Like monster or rockstar. 

Flavors id go with a lemon lime flavor, something tutti frutti similar to monster original. About 50/50 sugar free and sugar filled. I really hate the aftertaste of redbull, powerking and nocco. So id avoid that taste like the plague. Other flavors id go is perharps a good cola flavor like monster assault. Coke energy and ive heard the bang one is trash so it seems like cola is a tricky one to get right.

I like a good punch flavor too and you need an orange flavor. Could also try something unique like rosé or similar to reach that niché part of the market. 

To stand of you have to do something that makes people want to buy it. Like the 3D brand seems to be pretty succesfull. Those have a really unique can design."
