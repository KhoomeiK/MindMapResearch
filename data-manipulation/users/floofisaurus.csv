A lot of middle management types, working in IT companies, but without a strong IT background themselves, are using it. So I hear it pop up from time to time in news articles and interviews by these so-called ""experts,"" and it takes me a few seconds to figure out what they're talking about."
todayilearned,fgsldl4,t1_fgsl8hn,1581087204.0,Not as a noun. This new usage is really only a few years old.
todayilearned,fgskvp6,t1_fgskk7m,1581086869.0,That particular usage wasn't at all common 20+ years ago.
todayilearned,fgsfu3j,t1_fgsffsd,1581083170.0,That's just using it as a prefix or an adjective. I'm talking about 'cyber' as a noun.
todayilearned,fgsduin,t1_fgsc7pw,1581081564.0,"I've most often heard it to mean cyber-security, second-most to mean ICT, and less often a few other general IT-related meanings, but sometimes you just have to work it out from context."

Also, local legend suggests that there are dead bodies in the lake, which were deposited there after a cemetery was flooded a few decades ago. There's also supposed to be a mass grave of thousands of uneaten meat pies."

Am I the only one who loathes it when 'cyber' is used as a noun?

I really hope it's just a fad in business jargon, and will pass in a few years."
AskReddit,fglxzbs,t1_fgkgk9w,1580913676.0,"""Triage"" is a great example of something I absolutely loathe: people using technical terminology as a metaphor for general things. The smaller the technical field, the worse it is, and the greater my loathing and contempt. In today's world of search engines, it makes it harder, sometimes borderline impossible, to find relevant information on that technical aspect. Some subjects just get completely drowned out by the metaphorical usage.

It didn't used to be this bad, even back with early search engines, because there was still categorisation. Search engine results these days are like wading through a pile of tangled electrical cords the size of Mount Everest.

Technical fields themselves aren't *""immune""* from this reprehensible conduct either, especially when it comes to the titles of journal articles. You see stupid shit like ""New engineering technique leads to *volcanic eruption* in production capacity!"" Now some poor geologist has that article pop up in their search results.

STOP IT!"

Animal husbandry is often the source of diseases, both old diseases (like measles) and new ones (like bird flu). But you're wrong in this case.

The current most likely source of the novel coronavirus is bats. There's no link to factory farming or animal agriculture, and there never was. I saw some early reports that it may have come from snakes, but never livestock, as the meat market it was thought to have emerged from doesn't deal in that kind of meat."
