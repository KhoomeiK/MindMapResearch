ChoosingBeggars,ffg7fj3,t3_etfkaf,1579900081.0,"Idk why you think this goes in this sub. He was super appreciative of the food. But remember that one meal is just one meal! He knew you were generous, what did he do wrong by asking for cash too if there’s a chance you might give it to him? If he didn’t want the food he would’ve said no. He probably wanted cash for food later. And even if he wanted to go buy a beer, who tf cares??? You don’t have to give him the money. Asking you didn’t hurt you and he wasn’t being choosy. Gtfo."
AmItheAsshole,ffg6nzh,t1_fffzs6l,1579899605.0,Hopping on here to tell you that she could pay someone to clean the thing. Maybe a neighbor or a friend or relative could come help. But NTA - kick her out!!!!!
AmItheAsshole,ffg09ha,t1_fffzw23,1579895666.0,It is true in some ways but not in the way op seems to think. Yes we jointly own property now that we’re married. But that doesn’t mean that I can take my husbands shit while he’s on vacation and sell it or give it away or destroy it. Ours =/= mine.
AmItheAsshole,ffftdan,t1_fffkz5b,1579891374.0,And he felt so justified to the cop. “Her property is now my property so I can give it away if I want to” uhhh dude are we living in the fucking 18th century here?? Her property is her property jackass
AmItheAsshole,ffft8g8,t3_etda8m,1579891290.0,"YTA bro. You know your wife is passionate about the beekeeping and you made the decision on your own to get rid of them because she’s pregnant? Why can’t she tend to the bees while she’s pregnant? What about when the baby is born! Guess what - she won’t be pregnant anymore. And even so, you should have talked to her about it before just getting rid of it!! Also, moms want to be a part of the nursery building process. Why you would do all this without talking to her is beyond me. 

The nail in the coffin is how you are so confused that you were wrong that you’re trying to blame it on her “hormones”. Wtf man. You are a terrible husband and I hope your wife leaves your ass."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffjdhj,t1_fffj08p,1579885223.0,"Funny that you didn’t catch thats what I was doing lmao. You did admit that because in response to my previous comment you said “I nEvEr sAid tHaT wHy WoULd yOu tHinK i BeLieVeD tHaT?!?”

Either way, if you think that the colonists could have won the revolution without slaves you’re either a complete idiot or you are lying. 

Anyway peace dude have a great day!"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffi4jr,t1_fffi049,1579884463.0,"Nope. Because if you admit that America wouldn’t have won the revolution without slavery, then you admit america wouldn’t *exist* without slavery. Which is the same as saying America was *built* on slavery. 

See the difference?"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffghx2,t1_ffffwzx,1579883449.0,Because you said that all of America wasn’t built on slavery.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffcrh1,t1_fffccxc,1579881100.0,Hahaha I do not blame you for that!
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffcot5,t1_fff90cp,1579881054.0,"It’s not though. The north owned slaves, most politicians in the north did anyway. Also if slavery was not legal back then, none of American history would have happened because the colonists wouldn’t have been 1) wealthy enough to become a world power or 2) enough of a power to win the revolution. And anyway, if slavery were illegal at the time most colonizers wouldn’t have come here in the first place because much of the draw was to own a plantation for either sugarcane or cotton and utilize slavery as a way of cheap labor and make a shit ton of money. If they had to hire employees they likely wouldn’t have taken the risk of being so close to natives or the trip in the first place. So yeah, it’s absolutely safe to say that **The United States of America would not exist if not for slavery.**"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffcaok,t1_ffey8wg,1579880808.0,"Not true though. The other half wouldnt have survived without the slave half and even so, the north *did own slaves* most of the politicians did and without slaves we wouldn’t have won the revolution so your original statement is correct. Don’t back down"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fffc1ek,t1_ffeuvtf,1579880648.0,Do you really believe that the US would have been the strength it needed to be to win the Revolution if it didn’t have the southern slave states (as well as the slaves themselves)?
aww,fffacbw,t3_etavx9,1579879568.0,Oh my goodness this is the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen
FragileWhiteRedditor,fff9df5,t1_ffepx0u,1579878937.0,TIL college educated folk would never use the word dude on reddit
FragileWhiteRedditor,fff9aw4,t1_ffeu1rh,1579878891.0,"Potosi were African slaves owned by the Spanish (white colonizers). Hispaniola were native slaves owned by the Spanish (white colonizers). Both were part of American history and that only solidified my claim that American colonizers created a race based slavery institution and that they were the first to suggest lifelong slavery. 

I don’t need to give you my sources in order to prove that I’m right, but yeah I mean I did recently do the research in both an American gov class and an American history class and wrote a paper on slavery. I’m not trying to use that info to teach anyone anything, and I’m not here to argue with racist resistors who will never agree no matter the education they receive. But I do know that I’m right. If you can’t do the research on your own that’s on you but just because I know I’m correct doesn’t mean I owe you or anyone else my emotional or mental labor in explaining it to you or giving you my sources (although all you really need is an American history book). Go do the research on your own. Or don’t. I don’t care. Lots of people are wrong about lots of things and it doesn’t bother me.

Edit to add: why do you all jump to the “aN eDuCaTeD pErSoN wOuLdN’t SaY dUdE” thing? I am from a surf town in California, I’m probably going to continue to say dude in casual conversation well past getting my doctorate. I’m not presenting my paper or in an academic environment I’m talking to the village idiot I can say dude all I want."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fff8jnc,t1_ffekyuv,1579878382.0,"For you to equate academic resources to the Bible is really funny because you’re basically saying that history doesn’t actually matter and all you care about is opinion.  

It’s not a statement of authority, or of privilege, it’s me saying I have actual sources to back up my claims and it’s irrefutable fact. You can say you disagree but it’s not a point of argument. For you to think you are right even though you haven’t done the research on the subject would be equal to me saying well I think the earth is flat. Why? I dunno, there’s no research to back up my opinion but I just feel that way and I’m going to die on this hill. 

Also yes going to college and having an education is a privilege and I will be the first to admit that. Doesn’t make what I’m saying less true though."

LifeProTips,ffekw36,t3_et6j25,1579852337.0,But I’m busy not doing anything. If I do something then I won’t be relaxing.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffekdhd,t1_ffek7mv,1579851670.0,"Lol. It means I literally just did all the actual academic research on this exact subject recently so I know what I’m talking about. 

Also, great job going from fragile white to straight up racist asshole because your dick measuring contest didn’t pan out the way you expected. Why am I not surprised?"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffejvjj,t1_ffeinui,1579851038.0,Dude I literally just wrote a paper on this you can say it’s wrong all you want but the facts of history are on my side I know it’s hard to grasp through 2020 idiot glasses but do some research.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffeic4x,t1_ffei5ag,1579849183.0,It’s not a stretch that was literally the intent behind only using African slaves at the beginning of American history and it’s why they did away with indentured servitude in lieu of that system. There is even writing from the time by the colonists who believed it was better to use a racial system to easily identify them and to put whites above every other race. It’s where the whole idea of whites being superior came from.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffeer8y,t3_et57c0,1579845261.0,"I’m so tired of this argument like yes lots of other races have been slaves at one point in history but AMERICA invented the institution of racial slavery because they wanted to easily recognize who was a slave and who wasn’t. Also, until America, most slaves would work for a number of years and have little control over their lives for that time but would eventually retire, and their children were free people. Slavery in America changed that. Plantation owners made it so slavery was for life and not only that but your children would be slaves as well."

AmItheAsshole,ffddgko,t3_eszfka,1579818566.0,A lot of women don’t wear their engagement rings and prefer the look of just the wedding band. It doesn’t mean she doesn’t love her engagement ring! I’m sure she will wear it often to dates and going out and family things but I’d she’s just going to work I don’t blame her for not wanting to wear a large ring and choosing to just wear the band. It doesn’t mean she’ll never wear it. NAH but also a reminder to try and understand what she’s thinking and talk to her before jumping to conclusions.

So I see where she’s coming from. HOWEVER. My husband and I both agree with those points and we still thank each other every time the other does something around the house. Even if it’s expected. Like, I don’t work (SAHP and student) so I do most of the household chores. But even so, my husband will thank me every time he notices I’ve done something and vice versa. “I noticed you took the trash cans down to the street, thanks love.” “Thank you for doing laundry last night.” “Thanks for making dinner.” Etc etc. I agree that if she wanted to make those points she should have clarified that a) you’re not one of those guys and b) she’s appreciative of you. Just because you rightly share household responsibilities doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a thank you or some appreciation."

AmItheAsshole,ff8k73x,t3_es8oxf,1579682382.0,"NTA!!! Your husband has fallen into the trap that many working spouses do when they are married to a stay at home parent. Caring for a baby/child is more than a full time job. Assuming you wake up early in the morning with the baby, that’s probably 6am. Til bedtime is most likely over 12 hours per day! Not to mention if your husband is expecting you to get up in the middle of the night to feed the baby. When do you get time off? When do you get a break? To assume that he can go to work for 8 hours and come home and take a break every night is assuming you will work 12+ hour days every single day. No. When he gets home, that time should be split evenly down the middle. Whether you care for the baby together or take shifts, it doesn’t matter. But you are both parents! You are both responsible for the baby’s care when you’re both home. Your husband needs a wake up call."
