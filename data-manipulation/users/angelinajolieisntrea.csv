bipolar,ffjk9w7,t3_etz5j3,1580000152.0,I’d really seek the opinion of a third psych if possible or at least request a re-evaluation. to me it doesn’t really sound like bipolar more MDD
bipolar,ffebghi,t3_et5hi2,1579842122.0,"In order to be diagnosed with Bipolar 1, you only need to have had a manic episode. There are many cases of people with bipolar having manic episodes with few to no depressive ones."
bipolar,ff6v4tr,t3_eryqoi,1579635519.0,i think with going off abilify this should get better. you can also try nootropics if you believe in those. i hope this side effect goes away soon!
bipolar,ff6u80a,t1_ff6tttw,1579634982.0,"my sleep is definitely better, I could go days without sleep but Seroquel pretty much forces me to. Glad to hear it works well for you!"
bipolar,ff6qpjv,t3_eryrfr,1579632888.0,good luck!! hope it goes great :)

bipolar,feprvio,t3_eqcej6,1579329167.0,I’ve recently started taking Seroquel daily and still smoke with it occasionally. Don’t really notice a difference but I fall asleep pretty much right away
bipolar,fenhbbq,t3_eq30o8,1579284684.0,"you’re definitely justified in feeling the way you do, I would too
. I really think you should bring this up to your boyfriend and if he’s the least bit understanding he would find a different therapist. It’s better you both have a meaningful conversation about it and resolve it rather than go with it and hope for the best (it won’t work)."
bipolar,feeyqrs,t1_feey8nh,1579044162.0,try your best to socialize and make friend study groups. it helps a lot especially if you have to miss a lecture etc + forces you to get out more
bipolar,feeqsno,t3_eorthe,1579039237.0,so proud of you! i contemplate dropping out every day so I love seeing motivational posts like this
bipolar,feeqk9v,t1_feelswl,1579039102.0,amen
bipolar,fedwm77,t3_eon5tf,1579021436.0,"YES! I used to get an extremely intense whole body rush that I’d almost pass out from hitting my vape, especially first thing in the morning. Now I feel nothing though"
bipolar,fdq9fwg,t3_emm9pq,1578660166.0,"I’ve been in a mixed episode from hell and yesterday my doctor decided to wean me off all my meds and add Seroquel every night to knock me out until we can figure out a better mood stabilizer, since I haven’t slept almost all week. Well instead of knocking myself out with Seroquel last night like my doctor expected me to I ended up going to a stranger’s place to share my weed with him. I proceeded to take out my meds and explain them one by one, including my antipsychotics, all the while repeatedly insisting that I’m not crazy. He ended up kicking me out and I’m now on a bus to go to my parent’s for the weekend. I haven’t even gone to any of my classes this semester yet. 2020 is off to a great start!"
bipolar,fdd8rjc,t3_ekndi3,1578300030.0,Just wanted to say that I also read through all of it and was genuinely interested and amazed. I don’t think you’re manic and you could probably try posting this on [r/glitch_in_the_matrix](https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/)  you may get more responses
bipolar,fdcdcw7,t1_fdbyzkq,1578272150.0,I’d grab the snacks from him first though
bipolar,fdb6g2q,t3_ekamem,1578254366.0,pretty sure this is due to meds. I’m the same way and have always been able to fake my way through seemingly mundane and immature conversations but now I can’t even be bothered.
bipolar,fdb479k,t3_ekfus8,1578253566.0,"I watched it all and loved it. There are so many relatable scenes and the acting is superb, although it is more mania-centric when it comes to bipolar without touching much on the depressive side of things"
bipolar,fdb3r97,t3_ekgh9t,1578253384.0,that face at the bottom tho lmao
bipolar,fd4oy30,t3_ek1jib,1578169565.0,amazing!! that’s all you and you should be very proud
bipolar,fd4a99h,t1_fd42jru,1578165762.0,I’m really sorry to hear that. Is that a common occurrence with Rhodiola? I’d love to hear your experience with it and what exactly happened. I’ve only been taking it for 4 days now but I woke up really motivated today after only 5 hours of sleep and my hands are shakey so maybe I shouldn’t be taking it anymore but I was also getting sick and tired of being so lethargic. Thank you so much for replying
bipolar,fcz2km0,t1_fcyzf5f,1578092381.0,I’d suggest asking your doctor for a Librium script while you wean off xanax. It has a ridiculously long half-life due to active metabolites and will help keep a lot of the withdrawal symptoms at bay (which can be life-threatening in the case of benzos)
bipolarart,fcyx3mu,t3_ejmf2e,1578088992.0,i really like this
bipolar,fcgf4ah,t3_eh83ap,1577639318.0,"Lithium CAN lead to such side effects, but the way you are explaining it sounds like hallmark symptoms of diabetes. I would definitely check with your physician just to be on the safe side, but hopefully it’s just a temporary effect that can be solved with a slight dosage reduction!"
