I went through chemo and had tons of support and love from my friends and family. No one shaved their head. You want to help out your assistant manager, you can actually DO something to help them. Chemo is exhausting, you could cook dinner for them, help around the house. Maybe offer a ride to and from treatments, or just hang out with them while they are recovering. All of that would be more beneficial then just shaving your head. 

Good to you both."

There's a lot of journal prompts that can help with this. If you aren't into journaling that's fine, even just thinking about how I would answer the questions helped me. 

You can try new things and hobbies. Volunteering for a cause you care about could help. 

Something to consider is how you talk to yourself. A positive inner dialogue is so important. 

All of this takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Try not to be to hard on yourself if/when you slip up. Just try again.

I think it's admirable of you to help her out now. 

You admitted that you don't think she should have to ""struggle anymore"". Meaning that you knew she was out there struggling this whole time.
