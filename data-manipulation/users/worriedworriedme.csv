I wake up hurting and fall asleep feeling the same pain, it wakes me from my sleep (like now) but then I look at my dogs face and think the same exact way that you do and it makes facing another day worth it. 

Hang in there. I hope you and I will both heal and be able to get past the pain we are in."
mentalhealth,ffms4pp,t3_eu6zak,1580058323.0,"I usually do. The type and extent of crying varies though. Sometimes it’s just tears rolling down my face while I’m talking for a few minutes, sometimes it’s heavy sobbing, at times I’ve gotten pretty upset and been loud almost like a angry screaming and then the tears come from pure anger and frustration. 

I can recall sessions where I have gone in and said next to nothing but have just sat there and cried my heart out. 

I think it’s a comfort thing for me. My therapist is the only person on the planet who knows everything about me. Every secret, struggle, every raw emotion. The next upcoming session is definitely going to be a heavy tear filled one for me. 

I do let it all out. I need to otherwise I’d go crazy living the life I live."
InvestmentClub,ffkcqac,t1_ffk94rg,1580020622.0,"Thank you so much for your awesome advice :) 
I’ve done a ton of reading on ETF’s but very little on Index Funds. It’s time to take the plunge :) so for now the plan of action till I am in a position to have access to a 401k/IRS again is to look into index funds & ETF’s. 

I was actually just on investopia earlier this evening. It’s a great resource. 
Thanks again for the great advice."
InvestmentClub,ffkaxd8,t1_ffk93zy,1580019804.0,"401K is Employer Sponsored? And IRA needs what the IRS defines as “earned income” so I can’t do those till I’m working again. I can’t do anything now though with the above sadly :( 

I actually cashed out my 401K from a great job in Finance when I decided to change and go to Med School and thankfully didn’t need to touch it thanks to parents."

step1,ffg1kzv,t1_ffemfu6,1579896474.0,"Let me see if I can take a stab at this and make it easy’ish :) 

So IgE is made due to previous contact with the antigen ie: prior sensitization. The IgE coats mast cells and basophils 

So now on the next encounter with the antigen, there is a IgE reaction by the preformed IgE antibodies. The antigen bonds to IgE antibodies which is called cross linking which results in degranulation of cells. 

This causes a release of histamine, leukotrines, heparin, trypase etc. 

The next steps are the physical manifestations of type 1 hypersensitivity we see. 

The mnemonic is ACID 

A= Allergic/anaphylactic/atopic (this is type 1) 
C= Cytotoxic (this is type 2) 
I= immune Complex Deposition (this is type 3) 
D= Delayed (this is type 4) 

Type 1 is immediate 
Type 4 is delayed and T cell mediated. 


Hope it helps a bit."
