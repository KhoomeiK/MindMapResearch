PS5,feg0afd,t1_fefzicm,1579071495.0,Why would you not want to use your new console to its fullest potential?
XboxSeriesX,fefz9id,t1_fefy3uh,1579070341.0,"The games released on Ps2 you mentioned were running on totally different engines and had to be developed totally individually. That's precisely the thing that Microsoft wants to avoid : they don't want 2 teams working on two radically different games with the same name.
Because they will want to develop both gen versions in tandem, design decisions will have to be made that will limit the games scope to what the lesser console can do. Xbox exclusives for 1 to 2 years will be nothing more than enhanced xbox one games. Of course they're going to be beautiful and all but they won't include features and generational leaps that ps5 exclusives or even next gen only third party titles will provide.
Ultimately, this is about Microsoft not believing in Xbox series x' chances of being a popular enough console to warrant releasing exclusive games for it.
The critical error in this calculation however is that exclusives are games that are supposed to show what is possible uniquely on this new console, sacrificing the game's reach (new consoles have smaller install bases) for getting the platform in people's homes.
Ask yourself: how long will xbox series x take until it has a bigger install base than Xbox one? Is there any guarantee that Microsoft will start releasing next gen exclusives before then? How long will the xbox series x with its supposedly stronger than ps5 hardware be nothing more than a xbox one x 2?"
PS5,fefymis,t1_fefy31b,1579069651.0,Exactly. There won't be any such tech demo-y games in Xbox series x
PS5,feepbzd,t1_feecvc1,1579038394.0,None of the games you listed were exclusives. The point of exclusives is to show what's possible on the new console

XboxSeriesX,fed7snx,t1_fed7k6c,1579002833.0,"i get what you're saying, but in my mind its not exactly the same because while the switch has comparable power to the wii u, it offers a completely new feature in that you can take the switch anywhere while you could only take the wii u gamepad maybe to the next room.

the xbox one and xbox series x are the same thing. a home console. one is way more powerful than the other. but the newer one doesn't allow you to use that awesome power for exclusive games."
XboxSeriesX,fed7cvh,t1_fed710o,1579002306.0,"yes i am, because someone who would buy an xbox series x thinking that it's the only way to play halo infinite is a consumer who's being duped.
This hypothetical consumer will buy a new generation console thinking that the 400-700 dollars they spend are being put to good use, giving him/her gameplay experiences not possible before. But oh no what's that? the literally same exact fucking game is also playable on his fucking og xbox one from 2013.

That's anti consumer as fuck."
XboxSeriesX,fed6e5n,t1_fed5xh4,1579001091.0,This is true though. Look at for example Star citizen. A game impossible on shitty CPUs. The good thing about console generation leaps is that you can finally leave behind shitty hardware. Microsoft choosing to not do this negates a lot of the potential progress that could be made. He'll we're supposed to pay for great new hardware (it will be great) and then have no games (at least no exclusives) that even take advantage of it. This is quite simply a slap in the face of anyone who buys a series x.

This year could have been the point where games finally can strip off the shackles of disastously shitty cpus but no, microsoft doesn't want to sacrifice their already meager marketshare for progress."
XboxSeriesX,fecvlfo,t1_feazhmb,1578986366.0,"Quality will for sure be comparable. But xbox games will not be able to compare in scope. The jaguar cpu is just not up to the task.

Ai, physics, destruction, size of maps, number of particles. All of these things will not be any different to an Xbox one game for the first two years. (at least for xbox exclusives). This is like playing an Xbox 360 game in 4k on Xbox one x. It's beautiful and all, but it's not next gen."

PS5,fem6xcf,t1_felw32g,1579241927.0,Looks too much like the xbox 360 slim.
PS5,fem5k02,t1_felsd2o,1579240520.0,"I have over 800 games and have completed 760 of them. I never play on pc and I never play competitive games or even multiplayer games at all. 

To your definition, am I a casual gamer?"

Stadia,fehwwnz,t1_fegwhur,1579125485.0,"While it may be that devs are preparing stadia ports right now, the stadia hardware units will be woefully underpowered in a years time. Ps5 and Xbox series x will be at least 30 percent more powerful."
Stadia,fehwl32,t1_fehf31w,1579125303.0,Lol even the wii u had a better launch. Even the xbox one had a better launch. The fact that almost nobody outside of this sub even talks about stadia anymore speaks volumes.
Stadia,fehw29f,t1_fehscly,1579125009.0,Google in a nutshell
XboxSeriesX,fehvsap,t1_fehr3gb,1579124853.0,"PS now is awesome as fuck for ps4 games. You can download them now in addition to streaming them. The games on PS now are also way better than those on gamepass. Granted, gamepass puts the xbox exclusives on there day 1 but then again... Those aren't really worth playing anyway. I was so disappointed with crackdown 3 and gears 5"
XboxSeriesX,fehvlkd,t1_fehqqyt,1579124747.0,"Because I'm mad that Microsoft already gave up and you should be, too"
PS5,fehglb4,t3_ep4gno,1579116109.0,Power isn't everything. The shit sales numbers of the xbox one x are proof of this
XboxSeriesX,feh41ze,t1_feh3g4h,1579108707.0,Enjoy joining next gen in 2022 my dude
XboxSeriesX,feh3mxz,t1_feh3g4h,1579108461.0,Gamepass sucks. PS now is way better

PS5,feg0xei,t1_feg0e3f,1579072223.0,Games that have to also be released on old hardware will not be designed to use the features unique to the new console to its fullest potential.
PS5,feg0afd,t1_fefzicm,1579071495.0,Why would you not want to use your new console to its fullest potential?
XboxSeriesX,fefz9id,t1_fefy3uh,1579070341.0,"The games released on Ps2 you mentioned were running on totally different engines and had to be developed totally individually. That's precisely the thing that Microsoft wants to avoid : they don't want 2 teams working on two radically different games with the same name.
Because they will want to develop both gen versions in tandem, design decisions will have to be made that will limit the games scope to what the lesser console can do. Xbox exclusives for 1 to 2 years will be nothing more than enhanced xbox one games. Of course they're going to be beautiful and all but they won't include features and generational leaps that ps5 exclusives or even next gen only third party titles will provide.
Ultimately, this is about Microsoft not believing in Xbox series x' chances of being a popular enough console to warrant releasing exclusive games for it.
The critical error in this calculation however is that exclusives are games that are supposed to show what is possible uniquely on this new console, sacrificing the game's reach (new consoles have smaller install bases) for getting the platform in people's homes.
Ask yourself: how long will xbox series x take until it has a bigger install base than Xbox one? Is there any guarantee that Microsoft will start releasing next gen exclusives before then? How long will the xbox series x with its supposedly stronger than ps5 hardware be nothing more than a xbox one x 2?"
PS5,fefymis,t1_fefy31b,1579069651.0,Exactly. There won't be any such tech demo-y games in Xbox series x
PS5,feepbzd,t1_feecvc1,1579038394.0,None of the games you listed were exclusives. The point of exclusives is to show what's possible on the new console
PS5,feep7ew,t1_feee65s,1579038322.0,No thanks I'd rather use my hardware to its fullest potential
PS5,feeogyu,t1_feecuji,1579037895.0,"Killzone shadow fall would never have been possible on ps3, no matter how much you would have downgraded the graphics."
PS5,feeo622,t1_feekyw7,1579037719.0,Lol your xbox one can play those games. Thats so damn sad.
PS5,feeo3d8,t1_feefk1e,1579037674.0,OK xboomer
PS5,feeo272,t1_fee94u5,1579037655.0,Interesting strategy cotton
PS5,feeny3c,t1_feekxlc,1579037589.0,"Even so, the meager amount of console game-like games you can't get on ps5 and switch is neglectable. Xbox is redundant and unnecessary"
bodybuilding,feed961,t1_fee6v6m,1579031367.0,I believe you. You've made unusually good progress in just 2 years.
bodybuilding,fee9an9,t3_eomqqf,1579029051.0,You look distinctively late nineties.
PS5,fee47bb,t1_fee257y,1579026046.0,"Also mine because I want to own all consoles. But honestly, this time around, for the first time since the nes times, maybe I'll skip the xbox."

XboxSeriesX,fedd595,t1_fed8bnx,1579008145.0,"finally someone who shares my enthusiam for actually new gaming experiences that aren't being held back by old hardware.

There are way too many apologists here."
XboxSeriesX,fed7snx,t1_fed7k6c,1579002833.0,"i get what you're saying, but in my mind its not exactly the same because while the switch has comparable power to the wii u, it offers a completely new feature in that you can take the switch anywhere while you could only take the wii u gamepad maybe to the next room.

the xbox one and xbox series x are the same thing. a home console. one is way more powerful than the other. but the newer one doesn't allow you to use that awesome power for exclusive games."
XboxSeriesX,fed7cvh,t1_fed710o,1579002306.0,"yes i am, because someone who would buy an xbox series x thinking that it's the only way to play halo infinite is a consumer who's being duped.
This hypothetical consumer will buy a new generation console thinking that the 400-700 dollars they spend are being put to good use, giving him/her gameplay experiences not possible before. But oh no what's that? the literally same exact fucking game is also playable on his fucking og xbox one from 2013.

That's anti consumer as fuck."
XboxSeriesX,fed6e5n,t1_fed5xh4,1579001091.0,This is true though. Look at for example Star citizen. A game impossible on shitty CPUs. The good thing about console generation leaps is that you can finally leave behind shitty hardware. Microsoft choosing to not do this negates a lot of the potential progress that could be made. He'll we're supposed to pay for great new hardware (it will be great) and then have no games (at least no exclusives) that even take advantage of it. This is quite simply a slap in the face of anyone who buys a series x.
greentext,fed66tv,t1_fecy89s,1579000821.0,Cut it open then
XboxSeriesX,fed5u7t,t1_fed5s5a,1579000347.0,"The design will be the same this is true. But Microsofts exclusives will have to also work on Xbox one, making your purchase of a series x stupid because you could play the same game in Xbox one."
XboxSeriesX,fed5lex,t1_fed3dcc,1579000003.0,"Thems a Lotta words defending an anti consumer decision by Microsoft. I'll call you by your name, shill"
XboxSeriesX,fed34up,t1_fecxo55,1578996424.0,"Dude the reason why games run on shitty cpus is because ps4 and xbox one have fucking atrocious cpus.

This year could have been the point where games finally can strip off the shackles of disastously shitty cpus but no, microsoft doesn't want to sacrifice their already meager marketshare for progress."
XboxSeriesX,fecvlfo,t1_feazhmb,1578986366.0,"Quality will for sure be comparable. But xbox games will not be able to compare in scope. The jaguar cpu is just not up to the task.

Ai, physics, destruction, size of maps, number of particles. All of these things will not be any different to an Xbox one game for the first two years. (at least for xbox exclusives). This is like playing an Xbox 360 game in 4k on Xbox one x. It's beautiful and all, but it's not next gen."
bodybuilding,feavcl0,t1_feaqj0m,1578952538.0,Fuck off

XboxSeriesX,fe8vgnj,t1_fe8215e,1578931478.0,Which consumer? If I buy their next console I'm also a consumer. This move sucks for the consumer. It's a pro Microsoft move because they don't want to make their games exclusives to the series x because even fewer people will buy it than Xbox one.
XboxSeriesX,fe8v9un,t1_fe77yay,1578931375.0,Xbox one was fucking 500 dollars dude. Microsofts engineers back then sucked.
XboxSeriesX,fe8v6zb,t1_fe7o2pr,1578931332.0,Then you're going to have to buy ps5

XboxSeriesX,fe8t060,t1_fe83f0m,1578930436.0,How does Phil Spencer using an early version of the series x mean that every xbox is already in the new ecosystem. Seems like some grade a mental gymnastic dear xboomer
