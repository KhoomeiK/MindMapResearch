She had benefits through her job, which means an ER visit, if she brought her there herself, would probably be $100 copay and whatever it costed for the cast and stuff. So most likely not very much. You're telling me, that you didn't believe your daughter, and when she finally goes it's broken. And then, you laugh about it? Ugh. She was not my favorite teacher."

But mine is, people should be paid a living wage and not $12 an hour for busting your ass all day. 100 mil would be an extra 500+ dollar raise."

I hated my stepmom for years and she was actually pretty nice and cared about me. It's hard to accept a new parent ESPECIALLY when grieving a dead one. I am so sorry for your loss, and she handled that like a child. You are very right. You were a grieving barely adult who just lost their mother. That's really hard."

It's not worth another chance, they most likely aren't going to change until they lose someone because of it. So I say, make a clean break, distract yourself with your friends and work hard. It's not worth it right now. Maybe in a few years you can reconnect, because people change. But you do not deserve it. There is someone who will adore you and never think of it as an option.
