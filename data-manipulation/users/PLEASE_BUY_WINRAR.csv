That really has nothing to do with socialism. Socialism is the democratic control of the means of production. In fact, social welfare policies were first introduced (in germany) to stop socialist from gaining more power.

> Under pressure from the growing popularity of the Social Democrats, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced social welfare legislation between 1883 and 1888, despite violent political opposition within his own party. Bismarck felt state pension, unemployment, accident, and health insurance programs were necessary to stave off Marx's socialist revolution. As Bismarck wrote, ""My idea was to win over the working class, or maybe I should say bribe them, for them to see the state as a social institution that exists because of them and for their benefit.""

Dude why do you feel personally attacked. Nobody is blaming you. You can hardly be at fault for something that existed long before you. You can however be blamed for perpetuating those constructs on that basis that you think it's unfair that it's named after an abstract the same construct tries to identify you with.

The entire concept of manhood and womanhood is very weird and as a rigid model that doesn't really help anyone. Your misunderstanding lies in the fact that you really identify the concept of manhood with every person with XY chromosomes, a dick, that identify as a man, or whatever other trait, while this isn't the case. This concept of manhood is neither inherent to you or me. The idea of the patriarchy is an attack on the concept of rigid gender roles and the idea that we have to abide by them. If you understand that you are more than, liking cars and BBQ and try to brake loose from concepts that hurt you and the people around you, you are breaking loose from rigid gender roles you arent the problem.

You probably you shouldn't base your opinion on something people expressed on reddit, but not because it's reddit but because they are mostly awfully sauced. But there's nothing wrong with basing your opinion on opinions you have heard, as long as those opinions are built on top of facts to support them. I doubt any person on this website has actually read all the data ever necessary to form any opinion from the ground up without the influence of other opinions.

Every interpretation and therefore opinion is biased, even the presentation of facts can lead to a bias.

I've rarely seen people change their minds on debates, even if they are far from opinion. I've personally change my opinion after witnessing debates. I mean, we constantly do, even if it's only being more confident in your opinion because something you know wasn't addressed. It's only logical to argue with the intention of presenting an comprehensible opinion for third parties, why would that be dishonest?

I don't think it has to be. You can see someone as terrible because they were racist and caused the death of a lot of people while at the same time seeing how they fought even worse people because they believed in their own freedom.
