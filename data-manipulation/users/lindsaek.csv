If you want to keep your confidence you'll need to find other things about yourself that you like and appreciate. Things that usually get better with time like intelligence, patience, work ethic, or skill. Just a thought."
offmychest,ff55qus,t3_erocuf,1579581000.0,"I know the feeling! I recently cut out a friend that over time I realized was incredibly selfish and a bad influence, and honestly it's like a weight has been lifted! So much anxiety gone!"
offmychest,ff55h83,t3_ermri2,1579580783.0,"Turbotax is your friend. I know they ripped people off, but they literally walk you through taxes step by step and for $50-80 its worth it. Try to pay off your credit card every month, otherwise the interest will kill you.   Take a first time home buyers class, and Google insurance terms like ""deductible"" ""out of pocket maximum"" ""copay"" ""co-insurance"" ""insurance network"" to get a better understanding of insurance (given you're in the U.S.) I wish you the best of luck adulting! It's hard at first, but does get easier."
offmychest,ff54fwe,t3_erifgz,1579579948.0,I'm sorry for your loss. You did the right thing.
offmychest,ff54629,t3_ern95u,1579579733.0,"I have a male coworker who has been married twice and is in his 40's. He thought women could ""hold their menstruation"", like you can urine! He didn't understand the need for pads and tampons since he thought women could just hold it in until they went to the bathroom......   Edit: many, otherwise intelligent, men seem blissfully unaware of what being a female actual entails, and I feel like it's a huge factor in gender inequality."
offmychest,fe6k086,t3_ensp21,1578893406.0,"As a straight woman I totally agree. I love men. I love to be around men. I love to listen to men talk. I love to watch them work. Men are fascinating, strong, good to look at, and so interesting!"
HappyTrees,fcge702,t3_eh33j3,1577639066.0,I used acrylic instead of oil because my mom had that on hand.
