Until one day a man tried to grope me in the dog park, he positioned himself between us and gave the most low, terrifying growl and beared his teeth. He snapped at the guy and I ran, leashed him, and ran all the way home, going in random directions to ensure he didn’t follow me. He protected me then and it was the only time he was ever scary. I will miss him for the rest of my life."

GriefSupport,fegqz5u,t1_fegkmhr,1579100475.0,It’s the worst pain I’ve ever felt to wake up and roll over and not have him immediately there to greet me and ask me to take him outside. To walk by his bed and not try to avoid his paws in the dark because I could barely see him at night. I’m devastated. I’m really sorry for your loss as well. They deserve to live forever at peace.
GriefSupport,fegqti6,t1_fegmyua,1579100368.0,"He was only 9, a mix, and he also died of cancer. It progressed very quickly and aggressively and it was horrible to see him like that. We put him down after a few days of not eating meals, throwing up from the chemo, and eventually becoming lethargic and lame and refusing to even drink water when we tried to get him to. We thought we had way more time, but we got the initial cancer diagnosis only about a month ago."

dogs,feexz5s,t3_eodqb5,1579043668.0,We just lost our baby today. It was so fast and scary and terrible. He was in pain. I had to make the decision to put him down. I watched him take his last breaths in a panic. I am destroyed at his loss. He was my baby. I only had him for 4 years but he was a rescue dog. He was abandoned at 5. His owner said he was “too needy” of his owner’s affection and love. I’m so sad to say that he spent longer with the piece of shit who dumped him in a shelter to sit for a month at the risk of euthanasia than he did in his loving forever home.

SubstituteTeach,fdrmi1m,t3_emrv04,1578686616.0,"He is completely in the wrong and I am NOT justifying any of his behaviors. However, I have found that when I try to make all 30 kids follow every rule, I have a lot crappier of a day, and I get paid the same. My job is to make sure everyone stays in the room and survives. If a kid is texting, I let it slide. I just prefer not to have to fight 30 kids on every little thing each class period. And apparently it doesn’t win you any points with the faculty either. So I say, if they’re gonna pay me dirt wages ($10 an hour, which I could make in fast food) then they aren’t gonna get a full teacher. They’re gonna get me, sitting in the room, ensuring no fires are started. And that’s about it."
