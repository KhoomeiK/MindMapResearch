It turns out after years of study, that the location has more to do about suicide than the person wanting to kill themselves. Thats why putting up fences on bridges actually lowers suicide rates, not just stops people from jumping off bridges.

""Gladwell cites an article published in 1988 by two criminologists about the link between carbon monoxide in domestic gas and suicide in England and Wales. The paper argued persuasively that the phasing out of lethal “town gas” in Britain in the 1960s and ’70s caused a decline in suicides. When cooking stoves no longer provided an easy way to kill oneself, many who might thus have ended their lives did not pursue alternative methods. ""

So someone wanting to kill themselves at a train station will not go home and kill themselves. Its about the opportunity and location, not that they want to die. Mental illness isn't logical, thats why its mental illness. Brain sick."
