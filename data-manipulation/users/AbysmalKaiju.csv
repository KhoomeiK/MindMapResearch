No pens and paper, no tv other than baby shows, no bras, no comfortable clothes one thin blanket per literal child. Spend all day doing fuck all and maybe have one group counceling session a day.

If im trying to make a point id much rather have the real facts of it, instead of garbage, but i have a tendency to read a bit fast haha. Ill try and be more careful from now on.

That said! You are right, sexual assault and harrassment are very different things. I misread it when i looked at it to begin with, and that is my fault. 

My argument is it shouldnt be happening to anyone, but i dont want to lie to make it seem worse than it already is, because the truth is bad enough. Thank you for correcting me."

And okay, yes there are more men in the military. Is your point that in all time more men have been assaulted in the military than women? Bc if so then yeah probably. 

Current statistics show that wpmen are more likely to be raped then die of combat and up to 80% have been sexually assaulted. 

Thats a huge number. Yes, men are being hurt too, but not 80% of men. Both are issues, but ome is a systematic issue and one is higher than the general pop but as far as i can tell we domt kmow exactly how high. No one should be getting sexually assaulted. Both of these are important. I homestly think we agree, but the way you spoke before lead me to believe otherwise."

I get why you are disproving this person they have flimsy arguments. But i figured maybe youd like to know  why people probably came up with this theory! Autism is pretty common and its nice to have a character you can look at and go, wow, he has the same issues as me but look how awesome he is! 

The evidence here isnt enough to prove anything, but its enough that if you want it to be true you can see it. Which i think is kinda nice too, having a way to see someone like you on a show doing awesome stuff."

Not that I've looked too hard, but yeah. And the tubes are quite small, I've used what amounts to about 3 or 4 tubes on a medium painting. Plus 20$ for a basic canvas, so it would cost about 60$ to paint and probably another 30-40 to ship. He's asking for basically 100$ and free labor, if I'm right.

A lot of your problem, id wager, is that you've lost the muscle memory you had when you were drawing more. If you keep it up it will get better. Dont hold yourself to what you made as a child because no matter how good it really was it'll be perfect in you memory. Hold yourself to what you made yesterday, or the day before.

Regardless, i dont mean to insult you or how you feel. I really am glad that you are able to feel good with yourself. I think im just tired of people irl being very rude to me about it, and i perhaps took exception here."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdov1sa,t1_fdnbao0,1578613520.0,"Ive always had the opposite. Periods are like punishment to me, like a reminder i am meant to suffer. Ive said stuff in this threat in a few other places but its truely my least favorite time. Even if i were to get to slow down during it that dosent mean im not still in pain. It blocks me from truely enjoying being slowed down bc im constantly hurting and bloated and generally just a little more aggressive, probably because of said pain.  The best thing that ever happened to me is when i got on medication to stop it. I can take a slow day of my own choosing, i dont need my body making that decision. I feel like there is a huge difference between me taking things slow and feeling good and trying to be one with myself and kind, and my body going oh hey! Its torture time!

Im sure you have a different situation of course, and im not trying to say you shouldn't find good in your situation. I just think the view on it probably depends a lot on the symptoms you face. Even in an ideal world i doubt id have your opinion on the subject, but everyone is different, and everyone knows their bodies differently."

Sometimes periods suck and hurt. Some people have it easier than others. And i am very glad for people who dont have that pain, but even on days where i am not at work, where i just sit around at my house and take baths and eat or what have you im still in pain, and im not making it up. I dont appreciate the insinuation im just hurting myself, because i gurentee 9 year old me who had never even hear of a period was not trying to fit in when it started."

I know more good stories will come in the future, but im dissapointed so far with the new comic, so thats probably not helping. Its fine, its just not anywhere near what roberts was doing, in my opinion.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdnqmq7,t1_fdngilx,1578590965.0,"Im very happy for you, but i hate feeling pissed and sad and hurt and its like i have to deal with the exact same horrible shit as every other day, except now i also have to worry if im bleeding thorugh my pants and with enough back pain that standing up hurts.

But still go to my job where i stand for 8 hours and pretend to like other humans or get fired. 

Its nice to see that there are people who connect to their bodies like that but for me it just feels like another punishment for being born a woman. Its like if there is a god he was concerned we might not suffer enough, so he made sure to give us some extra, to be sure."
