college,ffazu87,t3_esffqp,1579748329.0,My long-term friendships spawned from two sources: The people I graduated with and my rugby teammates. Get close with the people in your major and I suggest joining a pretty tight club.
college,fcz4yab,t3_ejeuio,1578093757.0,"I had my heart set on Auburn University or Tulane University for various STEM programs (I wasn't 100% sure of what degree I wanted until late in high school). The major issue for me was the cost of attendance. I did the math at the time assuming I would get only admissions-based scholarships and it would have cost me well into 6 figures to go to either school for 4 years. I eventually found the University of Southern Mississippi and enrolled in the School of Polymer Science and Engineering. I was skeptical at first since USM is a public university and it was out of state for me. I ended up completing my degree in 4 years and was hired as staff in the same school I graduated from and am currently working on my MBA at USM.

The best thing I can tell you is visit both universities and specifically visit the individual schools you would be studying in and focus on how you would fit in there. I did tour both Tulane and Auburn and neither really felt like a good fit for me and, looking back, I am very happy with the decisions I've made. 

Working as a staff member I interact with a lot of potential new students taking visits and many of the questions I get are related to culture, experiences for students, and post-graduation support. I would ask those types of questions during your visits.

Also, regarding the accountancy school rejection, I recommend emailing a faculty member in that school, possibly the dean/director highlighting your interest in the field. Potential graduate students do that all the time when they want to enroll in our graduate program and it often works in their favor. 

Good luck!"
college,fc5cua7,t3_eg3dvx,1577453620.0,"Talk to your professors and advisors about how your semester went and request any advice they would give to improve for future semesters. Also look into the academic resources your university provides like tutoring. 

As for the grades being competitive for graduate schools, I wouldn't worry too much about it. I work closely with our graduate student advisor and he tells me that grades and your GRE score are only a small portion of your ""whole package"" when you apply to graduate school. Many grad schools will look at your involvement in your degree, internships, REUs, major GPA, etc. when making the decision. He flat out told me ""the GRE has honestly become a formality for most graduate schools and is never really taken seriously"".

Good luck in your college career!"
