Overwatch,ffgqcuh,t3_etj9qq,1579912376.0,"While I get where you’re going with this sentiment - I think there are a lot of folks playing with friends they actually know in real life or just online and some legitimately want to climb the ladder together. 

Forcing people to enter team chat is another thing and I’m mostly agreeable with this thought - however there are occasions where I duck out because of fighting or direct insults. I’m not playing this game to get yelled at - I’m at work all day dealing with that as it is.

I don’t know - Overwatch has changed so so much from the original launch. It’s dying on me now - I guess that does happen at some point - but I bid you good luck on your future games sir or madam!"
