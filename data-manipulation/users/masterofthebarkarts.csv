irishtourism,ffcp5gx,t1_ffco6nk,1579804227.0,I'll need to get the exact name of the place - I won't even try to spell it on my own :)
irishtourism,ffcntt3,t1_ffcnh0g,1579803418.0,I'm sure we will! Thank you
irishtourism,ffckjts,t1_ffcjfqg,1579801422.0,That is incredibly helpful - thank you very much!
irishtourism,ffcj4uh,t1_ffci3p7,1579800567.0,"Thank you very much! Excellent points all around, and yes, exact location will likely be the deciding factor. My husband has led me to believe that it is ""close"" to Shannon, but what close means to him is anybody's guess :) Thanks for the point about buses! 

We do have some family in Ireland, but my understanding is that they are closer to Dublin. I will touch base with them though and see what they suggest (although they are on the other side of the family, and not related to the ""castle"" side)."
irishtourism,ffcirh1,t1_ffchx9i,1579800343.0,"Thanks very much for your response! I've done some pretty intense cycling  (75 km was my record) but not much of it rural, and my husband isn't as adventurous, so very good points made.

Any idea what the average 1-day cost to rent a car might be? Likely more expensive then a cab...but, like you say, freedom to set our own schedule. My understanding are the ruins are within an hour of either Shannon or Limerick.

Thanks for the advice re: animals! My husband was raised on a farm so he'd tackle me before letting me wander into livestock :) Is there any way to find out in advance if certain land/area is ""OPW""? What does that stand for?"
datingoverthirty,ff99acl,t3_es01yu,1579707794.0,"I can see how these comments could read as ""high status"", but honestly I have to echo all the other ladies here and say that it isn't about that. 

I dated three men in a row who were in dead-end low-wage jobs for around a decade; whose main hobbies were video games and drinking; and who had 0 ambition, hope, drive or joy in life. During these relationships I was going back to school, spending time with my friends, advancing my career, improving my finances and trying new hobbies. I was *alive*, and growing and learning and experiencing and trying, and they were stagnant and depressed. Dating men like that, helping them, trying to encourage them: it's exhausting. And it doesn't work.

All these men made perfectly lovely friends: kind, funny, fun to hang out with, and they (for the most part) treated people well. But my standards for a life partner are higher than my standards for friends, and with each of these guys I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of their apathy. There was no place in the future I was building for these men stuck in the quagmire of their own cowardice.

My husband had a life without me; that's how I knew he could build a life *with me.*"

fatlogic,ff9290b,t3_es061w,1579703053.0,"This is such an interesting example of the ""yes, but"" phenomenon in these spaces. Like of course the size of your body is heavily influenced by genetics, *within reason.* Your maximum adult height, the width of your hipbones, the length of your femurs, your general ""build"" are very much influenced by your genetics with a big heaping dose of nutrition thrown in. If your parents are 5'2 and 5'6'', respectively, and all their family members are under 5'8'', there is a very good chance that even with excellent nutrition you will never be 6 feet tall. Sure, of course!.

BUT. BUT BUT BUT. Even if you are genetically predisposed to a certain general shape, it is MADNESS to think that genetics would have so much clout in causing obesity."

However, if a dude you've never met is telling you all about the bullying/abuse he's suffered, he's trying to emotionally manipulate you. Do not engage!"

I also wonder how many of these dudes think of celebrities as more important than the ""average"" person, who doesn't deserve any of their precious concern (they are also better than average, which is why they don't need to be nice to you)."

If I lose 5 lbs I get a very nice ""ab-shadow"" (like...""6 pack light""??) but not where I'm at right now. 

My BMI is 22.1. It's fine. But at 20.5/21, I just look so much better. Also all my pants are just SLIGHTLY tight right now. Not enough to buy new pants...just enough to make me want to pop the fly open after 4 hours at work. :("

I know \*how\* to lose 5 lbs. I did it in the past. I was very successful. I tend to lose slowly (it took me like three months)  but I got there.

And yet, here I am, just...grumpy. I just don't want to do it. I'm lazy. I'm busy with other things. I have been having some weird neuro symptoms that haven't been helping, but they certainly aren't stopping me from not eating a bag of chips every other day.

Vindicta,fe8qnsg,t3_enrer2,1578929423.0,"I don't disagree with this sub's definition of objective beauty (for the most part), but I would argue that when it comes to individual experience your *subjective* level of beauty is much more important than your *objective* level. A healthy, pretty 7.5/10 'Becky' is going to receive totally different treatment in a crowd of models than she is in a crowd at a typical Walmart. Your geographic location (and the general levels of hotness therein) is going to influence how you are 'read' and treated much more than your objective level of beauty, so it can be really, really difficult to determine if you're ""objectively hot""."
Vindicta,fe8jyrd,t3_eo2v52,1578926998.0,"Volume of food and caloric density of food are not the same thing. You can eat relatively small portions of junk food and maintain or even gain weight because they are so high-calorie. A similar amount or volume of healthy food (ie, non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and fish and/or legumes & beans, plus small to moderate amounts of heart-healthy fat) will generally be much lower in calories.

Eating a high-processed-carb diet is also harder on your pancreas. Essentially, high-carb meals cause a spike in blood sugar, which then triggers a flood of insulin, which craters your blood sugar and can leave you tired, cranky and hungry. Lower-carb meals do not cause as much of a dramatic blood-glucose spike and so the insulin response is more regulated, causing less of a crash.

If most of what you're eating is processed junk food, you may also be deficient in B vitamins or even anemic. Also, if you live somewhere with a dark winter time, you are probably Vitamin D deficient, which can cause lethargy and low mood. A simple blood test can determine if any of these are to blame.

If you are over-fat but not over-weight, then you should start incorporating exercise into your day along with eating better. Simple body-weight exercises are a good way to start building strength and combined with an improved diet should improve your composition. Are you actually over-fat though? 

Generally, if you are eating high-calorie, high-carb processed junk food, and you replace it with a similar ""amount"" of better food (1/2 non-starchy vegetables and fruit, 1/4 protein foods and 1/4 whole-grains/starchy veg) you will generally feel better over all. You may end up losing some fat, but I would really recommend building some muscle mass as well. 

I can add more if you're interested - or even make a nutrition post (although I know there have already been a handful)."
