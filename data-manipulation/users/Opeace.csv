OnePiece,ffeutxb,t1_ffepshu,1579866510.0,"This is very similar to what I put in the comment on the survey:

Thank you for making the survey but I think putting up the link to the earliest translation no matter the quality should be done regardless of what people say in the survey. Just label it and then point out that you would be adding the better translations when they come along, and label those as well. I think my point is that it feels really bad that anyone but myself should have a say in what quality I should read. And I know that I have the freedom to look up the scans for myself, but to be honest, I haven't been able to find anything. I HAVE to rely on Reddit for the links to the new chapter. So if you have them, please put them up so I can read the shitty version.  I think most of us are big boys and girls and can decide for ourselves what we want to read. So long as stuff is labeled, I don't see an issue.

I drove around the corner from work and I saw dozens of cops on every block searching every black man there regardless of what they were wearing or body size and shape.

The adventure represents is his ""unfinished business"" and the bad guy represents Carl's inability to let go of his earthly possessions. Which might indicate why the bad guy had been stuck in purgatory for so long. As the movie goes on, Carl starts to dump out more and more things from the house which represents him ""letting go"".

OnePiece,fcsvrm4,t3_ehlny3,1577926355.0," **Best Nakama of the Year:** Artur -  [u/OharaLibrarianArtur](https://www.reddit.com/u/OharaLibrarianArtur/) \- not only does he contribute to our understanding of One Piece but his sincere effort to explain and support the entire franchise should make him a permanent Nakama of the Year.  Give him Nakama of the Decade!    **Second best:**  [/u/SirloinBurgers](https://www.reddit.com/u/SirloinBurgers/)  Amazing original content

 **Best One Piece Character of the Year:** Yasue. I'm probably in the minority here but although Oden is awesome, I feel Yasue made a lot of us cry (or at least feel something) over a very short time that we knew the character. He represents Oda's brilliance and mastery of storytelling. No other character has made me feel an emotion as strongly as Yasue. That (sad) moment has not yet happened for Oden. It will probably happen in 2020 but Oden's story is incomplete as is and therefore, I can't give him my vote (for this year). 

 **Best Manga Chapter of the Yea**: Chapter 957 Ultimate. Rocks Pirates, little bit of Garp's backstory, little bit of Roger's backstory, Yonkos' and Pirate King's bounties.  Even before the chapter was released, the spoiler posting had an absurd amount of up-votes and I knew it was going to be good. The sheer amount of information that was revealed framed by the Marines having a briefing makes it the best chapter of the year. However, the way Oda gave us so many reveals while at the same time creating intrigue (the Xebec name, where are the other Rocks pirates?, why exactly did Roger and Garp team up, the significance of God Valley). I argue that it could be a contender for the best chapter of the decade.

 **Most unexpected moment in the Manga of 2019:** Chapter 944 Pages 10-15 (approximately) Kamazou is Killer. This wasn't just unexpected, it also gave the horror of the smile fruits a personal touch that hit us hard. I believe most of us expect to find out interesting things about certain mysteries, so we're not totally surprised when certain mysteries are revealed.  For example, we knew the Yonko's bounties would be high so it didn't surprise us because the numbers fell within certain expectations. But this was surprisingly unexpected, a lot of people suspected Kamazou would be someone else but having it be Killer was genius. **Runner up:** I don't know if this qualifies but the fact THAT we got the Yonko/PK bounties WHEN we did was a real-life unexpected surprise to us. Not the numbers themselves, but the fact that Oda just dropped those bounties on us without warning was great. If this does qualify then give it #1."

I honestly believe the girls that gave me the worst rejections are the ones who would've turned out to be nightmare gf's.

Generally speaking, some people are way more aware of people's feelings, and they realize the amount of courage and pain that goes into hitting on someone and being rejected. And they react accordingly. Others are so self-involved they don't care how they make you feel. 

On that note, you also have to be aware of you how you make them feel. For instance, don't expect a positive response if you hit on a girl at a bus stop at 2:00 AM. Also, it's way harder for introverts to develop this awareness because they typically have less practice being in social situations. They should refer to online dating tips and advice as well as advice from extroverted friends, not introverts."
