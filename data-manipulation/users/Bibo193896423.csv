AskReddit,ffj4agi,t1_ffj2486,1579990024.0,"I graduated university with a BS in CS and started working my first software developer job last year. I am very happy now but the journey was definitely difficult. I switched from a liberal arts major sophomore year to CS. Before switching I thought school was easy. Just attend class and BS the homework and get an A. CS I had to actually study my ass off to understand anything. My work paid off as I am now making good money and CS jobs are actually easier than coursework IMO. 

I'll say that to be successful in CS you need to be dedicated, you won't get by half-assing it, this is coming from a serial procrastinator. On another note though, you're in high school. You have time. You can enroll in CS and then change to accounting if you feel it's not for you. A ton of my fellow undergrads switched their degree programs because they realized CS wasn't for them. It's a lot easier going from CS to accounting than vice versa because CS math courses will count for accounting majors but not the other way around."

acorns,fdinclr,t3_eljo9v,1578446756.0,"That's like saying gyms are pyramid schemes because there's a discount when you refer family/friends.

First of all, actual pyramid schemes are illegal. They probably think it's an MLM like Lu LaRoe which have some of the qualities of pyramid schemes. The main thing with MLMs that is like pyramid schemes is you make money by recruiting people under you and skimming a percentage off what they make instead of making money from the customers using the product itself. Imagine if when someone referred you to Acorns, they got 5% of your gains, and 3% of the gains anyone you referred and 1% of anyone they referred. That would be like a pyramid scheme/MLM.

Acorns has mainly made money from investments from big corporations so far, which is how they were able to give free accounts to students for so long, but their actual business model is their modest service fees and the commissions they get from other companies when you go through Found Money to buy their services, a portion of which goes back to you.

With pyramid schemes/MLM, it's very unlikely you can make any money from the underlying product like selling Lu LaRoe's crap leggings. With Acorns, investing is the expected way to make a return; referrals are just a little bonus like found money is.

Student discount went away. When their customer base is big enough, referrals will, too."

videos,fdfmpwl,t1_fdflg4z,1578365269.0,"> However, giving someone ""the benefit of the doubt"" should really only be given when there is ""reason"" to doubt. I've opposed it before but to give a stupid example, if someone steals from you and shows no indication of stopping, there's no reason to give the benefit of the doubt. 

Let me repeat: The only consistent and fair way to treat an apology is give people the benefit of the doubt until *after the apology* they give you reason to doubt them. 

>*after the apology*

You can't use what he is apologizing for as proof that the apology is insincere. That's just, as I cautioned against, judging sincerity based on how offensive/egregious what he did is. Are there many things worse than murder? Because there are murderers who are later deeply sorry for what they did and apologize from the bottom of their heart to the families of their victims and then never kill again. I think saying some deeply offensive things in defense of a rapist is bad, but not as bad as murder.

&#x200B;

> So it would be most prudent to weigh both of his comments and make a decision then. 

Why is it so hard for people to just say ""I don't know?"" You don't have to make a decision when you don't have much evidence. You're allowed to say ""I don't know if he's sincere, let's closely watch what he says and does from here on out."" Has he said or done anything since the apology that would make you think he was just BSing an apology? If so, use that as justification instead."

This shows that it's harmful to just evaluate a person's entire being based one one thing they said years ago. When people talk about cancel culture, that's what they're talking about: one small step out of line and people jump on you like a pack of wolves. It's not as simple as ""holding people accountable for what they say and do.""

Advocating caution with judging people based on one tweet from years ago is not the same thing as defending predators in power, so stop equating the two."

The thing is, you have no way of knowing what someone else is actually thinking. The only consistent and fair way to treat an apology is give people the benefit of the doubt until *after the apology* they give you reason to doubt them. Otherwise, people just judge sincerity based on how much they like the person or how offensive or egregious what they did was. I'm not saying you have to forgive him and this is in no way defending what he said, but you have no way of knowing how sincere or insincere his apology was  so don't pretend like you do because it's intellectually dishonest."
