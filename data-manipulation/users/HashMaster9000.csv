All this ridiculousness from those senators breaking the rules, what if they want to not vote but can't opt out in front of the party? If they get jailed and aren't allowed to vote if they do something outrageous, does that mean their vote goes somewhere else or simply doesn't count? Maybe they're doing crazy outlandish shit to try and level the playing field?

Fallout NV: Bugged out so terribly bad on PS3 when at the Hoover Dam because it couldn't render the fire trashcans.

Skyrim: had a HDD die on me halfway through and had to restart when it was released for PS4.

Fallout 4: the storyline wasn't as compelling and then Witcher III was released so I switched.

I actually don't really know how any of those 3 games end in the main storyline..."

However, I'd take your IT to task for wasting company funds: [This Dock](https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-USB-C-Pro-Dock-Thunderbolt/dp/B07VL675DT) is $100 cheaper, works out of the box, and isn't a huge eyesore.
