Here are pretty valuable Infos:

Charleston, South Carolina, was the only city in the antebellum South to issue these tags or badges which had to be worn by any slave that was “hired out”. Each year a slave owner who hired out a slave had to pay a tax and the slave had to wear a brass “Salve Tag” proving the tax had been paid. The greater the skill and training required, the greater the tax. Charleston slave tags are known from 1800 up to the Civil War. "

However, I chose to believe that this was a money handover thing from a kidnapping in canada. Someone was kidnapped and the kidnapper called a close person to tell them that he wants cash in a bag. The bag should be placed in the park near the bench. But then the close person called the police. Dangerous move. The police obviously have geese as police agents in Canada and they are trained for this exact situation. Just let them walk around in the designated handover place. Then we see this guy approaching. He is the kidnapper. He wants to grab the bag from the ground. There is money in it. Lots of money. But then BAM the police give the goose a ""go"" via microphone and BAM the goose attacks. Second goose was in position but didn't need to participate. At the end the police lady in disguise comes and arrest the kidnapper. He is just happy that the goose torture is over now. Because of this he doesn't run away. This actually happens a lot in Canada. Kidnapper 0 - Goose 13"
