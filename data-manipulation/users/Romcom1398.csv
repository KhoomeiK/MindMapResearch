Also it's a weighted blanket and I'm not sure if you're supposed to wash those, Just like you never really wash normal blankets but Just put them in a clean cover. I don't know for sure though haha"
NoStupidQuestions,ffuj2ky,t1_ffuim4u,1580243011.0,Also thanks for the help!
NoStupidQuestions,ffuj1q9,t1_ffuinu3,1580242996.0,Oh ok thanks! Yeah I'm kind of worried that someone Will get the blanket and it'll be icky because I used it
NoStupidQuestions,ffuiyb9,t1_ffuim4u,1580242941.0,Yeah that's what I'm worried about. But I wouldn't return it because it't broken but simply because they sent me a size smaller than I ordered. But I kind of still want to try it just to see if the Idea of a weighted blanket would work for me.

AskReddit,ffj4y3q,t1_ffioalo,1579990508.0,"Oh shit I don't do this.
I really try to remember stuff people tell me but most of the time the next day I remember maybe 20 percent of what they told me. So forgetful."
Advice,ffd76cg,t3_esxluq,1579814746.0,"I feel like she's trying to keep you close by being like 'look I'm amazing look at me look at me, and you don't have other friends so you'd be dumb to leave me'. 

Also yes. Toxic af. Friends are supposed to lift you up not pull you down. Jokes are nice of course, but this is far beyond jokes. Jokes are fun. Sometimes they make you feel a little insecure, sure, but it's all in good faith and usually when it's a good friend they'll be like 'I was just joking. I didn't mean anything by that, you know that right?' When they actually make fun of you without it being fun anymore, you shouldn't be friends with them, or at least not spend as much time together, in my opinion, because friends are not meant to make you feel sad."
actuallesbians,ffd6j13,t3_essu42,1579814385.0,Actually I was the second gay. She was really cool and basically after asking and asking about boyfriends she was like 'girlfriends?' and basically pulled me out of the closet and was like 'YES IM NOT THE ONLY DYKE ANYMORE!'. Then she told everyone else I was gay (with my permission cuz I was too shy and she was like 'can I tell them?' '... errrrrrrr sure??????) And that's how I became totally out at work and only at work.
