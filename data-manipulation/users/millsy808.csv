It’s just fetch quest after fetch quest. Meet bob, go and see Jill at the top of the island, now go back to bob, now visit Alan, Alan wants you to speak to Tony. tony wants you to speak to Helen.

And so forth.. you can’t even explore until you reach level 10.

facepalm,ff8uc46,t1_ff8tila,1579696364.0,"I don’t know about the US as I’m English living in Ireland/Northern Ireland. It’s actually laughable here how bad they are in their attitudes towards vegan or vegetarian food. For instance, there’s a thing called a vegetable roll, that people fry for breakfast. It’s mainly made out meat. It’s not so bad in the cities, as it’s more forward thinking, but in the country it is very old fashioned.

I’m 46, I genuinely don’t know about people making a point about eating meat, unless of course it’s a retort. I know what you mean about THAT guy who has to hold that attitude though. The barbecue guy. (I like barbecues btw, but tend to make mixed ones- pure meat in itself is not nice)

I completely agree with you though. It’s just a shame that I’m a total hypocrite. I don’t like how milk or eggs are produced let alone meat. The only meat I don’t eat is lamb, because I see them every springtime hopping around in the fields. Again, why not eat that, just because it’s “sweet or cute”. 

Yet I’m an animal lover. We have two cats that we treat like children. Yet I’ll eat bacon. I need to re-evaluate in some ways.

It’s certainly making me think again. I also have vegan friends who are very fair in how they treat people who eat meat, and it’s very hard for them over here as well. 

I’m with you 100% on the farming industry, I really am. I’ll keep my eye out in future to see how people are when talking about eating meat. Maybe I just never noticed it because it’s such a normality.

It all seems to point towards society needing to adopt a better understanding, and make it easier to be a vegan. 

I also understand why vegans have to bring it up, especially here. It’s almost impossible to go to a restaurant and find anything vegan in a lot of places."

To be honest, I don’t know this! Nobody has ever introduced themselves and said “by the way I eat meat”, whereas vegans have to say it at some point because of a possible social situation.

But I do see people put vegan in their profile name on Twitter or talk a lot about it on FB. I think being a vegan is a commendable thing to do, but I don’t see it as someone’s defining characteristic, but I do understand of course that for many it is a passion. It’s fair enough.

I don’t see accounts saying “British, meat eater, Remainer” or people going on about meat unless it’s a defence mechanism. I do know a couple of people who would chastise someone for eating meat, and I don’t think that’s fair.
