I am so very sorry for what you’re going through. That must be devastating. 

You have absolutely done the right thing and while things may feel overwhelming right now, you’ll be ok! And most importantly your niece, daughter and possibly other kids will be ok!"
succulents,ffk3u32,t3_etrzyz,1580014974.0,I have a pot head shirt but it’s not as obvious it’s about plants and I always gets teens and “stoner kids” telling me they like my shirt. Thanks grocery bagger boy lol

I wish I had someone like Dr Now to call me out on my shit, because I won’t do it myself"

MarriedAtFirstSight,ffgi2j0,t1_ffgh0d9,1579906721.0,"Yeah, I really wish they actually tried to make good matches. I understand the pool of people is pretty small, but maybe 3 actual matches instead of 5 crap matches."

askwomenadvice,ffeen3o,t1_ffbtt3a,1579845147.0,I’m shocked this is the top response because I was going to mention maybe having N parents. My husband does this (just happened this week!) and I def think it’s from his NMOM.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffeebgr,t1_ffednil,1579844827.0,This is the one show I really wish wasn’t trash.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffee9l2,t3_et432f,1579844775.0,I am really starting to wonder if both her and Zach are actors.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffdadgp,t1_ffd0fyg,1579816581.0,"Honestly though, I didn’t think he would be that attracted to her. She looks kind of old and, dare I say, horsey. I’m sure Zach would have wanted some young blonde, fit piece of IG influencer ass. 
A sunset heart hands, xfit, faux boho girl."
antiMLM,ffc9c2h,t1_ffb4i58,1579794497.0,I loved watching that craziness though!
antiMLM,ffc9ajd,t1_ffazwb1,1579794470.0,I was so addicted to watching those crazy videos!! Everyone had some weird set up and weird was to do give aways and stuff. Definitely one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen.
antiMLM,ffc92rt,t1_ffb65vr,1579794332.0,"Same with Mary Kay. 
I have never heard of and Avon or Mary Kay party nor had anyone ever tried to sell me on their products. (And their products are legit unlike shit like It Works)."
BeAmazed,ffc89u0,t1_ffc6v19,1579793815.0,Looks completely unprovoked - my only thought is if the kid had a horn or bell on the bike that was making noise.
BeAmazed,ffc7y3r,t1_ffbp00s,1579793607.0,This makes me sad even though it was likely the right thing to do. That was a completely unprovoked attack.
AmItheAsshole,ffc76ji,t1_ffbzhar,1579793113.0,"I hate to agree - especially because I’m thinking of my own coworker who would do this and I’d be happy to see go - but if he didn’t put his quitting in writing you might be SOL. 
My guess, if he files for unemployment and you contest it, he’ll win anyway."

I’m on delay, are there others?"
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffb1v9x,t1_ffaxn7f,1579749703.0,Zach will be subtle with his assholery though - like Luke- pushing her out then pulling her in
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffb1l8m,t3_esklg3,1579749511.0,Omg what a fucking douche nozzle hat.
