I just value that this sub is a place for people to vent those feelings and discuss their legitimate criticisms, because the majority of the grumps community are fanatical and aggressive towards anyone who questions what they’re doing.

Plus the questionable business practices. I definitely still appreciate his earlier work, but I just wish he would be more considerate of his followers.

I think Danny is kind of jaded, but still deep down wants to put out a good product since he has a sense of pride in his work. He’s just being bottled up by Aron, I think. Not that he hasn’t done some questionable things. Also, he just has a different flavor than Jon, which a lot of people don’t prefer. 

I’ve been recommending them a lot, but check out Super Beard Bros. They’ve really replaced that earlier game grumps feeling for me. While they have changed from their earlier videos, it’s not a significant change, just them getting 5 or 6 years older. They’re pretty damn consistent.

He always used to push Arin to pause the episodes when they were going nowhere, for example.

Part of having integrity involves not jumping ship just because he’s being held back and losing interest. I think part of the reason that he’s caring less is because he constantly gets pushback from Arin.

So far, I’ve always felt comfortable around anyone with fame that I’ve met, simply because I know I would feel shitty if someone reduced my personality to my work. My problem is mostly with the uglies, who have poisoned the well and set up an environment where the guys are required to have *zero* accountability for their mistakes. That goes to people’s heads.

I don’t have any real desire to seek out an opportunity to meet with them, but if I did meet them, I’d do everything to respect their personal space. I think it’s pretty dehumanizing to geek out and objectify people just because they provide you with entertainment. Fanaticism is unhealthy for both the subject and the fanatic.

One example, I actually had an opportunity to greet Gene Ween as he came off the stage at the end of a show, and just said “hey man, great show”. Meanwhile, a fanatic tried to have some deep, meaningful interaction with the guy, and dropped the guitar pick that Gene tried to hand him because he was more concerned with becoming his best friend or some shit. I grabbed the pick, and gave it to one of my friends that invited me to the show because he was a bigger fan than me."
