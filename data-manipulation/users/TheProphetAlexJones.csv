AskReddit,ffj6fwh,t3_ett7fr,1579991585.0,"Not riding with my brother years ago when he was collecting scrap. I was like 16 at the time and my brother was collecting scrap for money at the time as he was down on his luck. I stayed home when he asked if I wanted to ride with. He went to this lady’s house in town and knocked on the door to ask about the scrap laying in her yard but no one answered minus a kid crying in the upstairs window. Next thing you know the woman who owned the house is running over and yelling at my brother saying she saw him trying to break in.

He stayed and tried to explain to her he just wanted to ask about scrap but she was having none of it and called her husband and police. Next thing you know her husband is pulling up, runs up to my brother and pins him against the door screaming. Then the cops pull up and the woman tells them she watched my brother try to break in and shit while my brother explains his story. The cop basically tells my brother that since they’re saying he was trying to break in that hes getting arrested. There was even a witness across the street that stood and watched the whole ordeal, but apparently he wouldn’t say anything. 

Long story short my brother spent like 6 months in jail and was forced to take a plea agreement for something he didn’t do because we couldn’t afford his bail or legal defense. His kids were given to his heroin junkie ex girlfriend because they wouldn’t give them to us and she ended up killing his youngest daughter by giving her a blood infection through popping a blister on her thigh with a heroin needle while he was in jail. His ex got like 14 years or something like that for killing his kid. She gets out in like a year. I’ve always felt like if I had rode with I could’ve been a witness and potentially avoided all of it. It fucked my brother up bad and he’s just now starting to get his life back together after landing a really good job."

aww,fdf8fvv,t1_fde0le8,1578355727.0,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

It honestly gets embarrassing sometimes and i either have to tell him to fucking cool it or I just walk away.
