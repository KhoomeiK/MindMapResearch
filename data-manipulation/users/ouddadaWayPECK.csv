Just because her daddy said she should have it doesn't mean she can. Your current husband can save and gift her if he thinks it's important. It's telling that he'll throw the funds away that *he didn't earn*, he's had several years to set his kid up financially and didn't bother. It's so easy to spend other people's money. 

 Let him go without if darling daughter wants a windfall. He can forgo vacations and expensive toys and restaurants and drive an old car if his THIRTY year old daughter wants to play trust fund kid. You could always purchase something that a charity you're interested in could utilize, or cover a divorce. It doesn't look like your husband is the man you thought you married. Obviously this is a lot of speculation on my part, but husband and kid seem very selfish and uncouth. 

I'm sorry for your loss and wish you didn't have the extra stress and drama they are forcing upon you. A gentle hug if you want it.

I certainly don't think everything is woo, but some are freaky. Like a little 2/3 year old boy is there and then he's not.
