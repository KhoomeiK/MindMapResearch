LesbianActually,ffclves,t1_ffclpiy,1579802219.0,"Sims 4, I don’t really do game play just building. I’ve played for 20 years and saw it was free with ea access and figured I’d give it a try!"
LesbianActually,ffclmgt,t3_esvjsk,1579802071.0,"I posted one of me this morning or last night? I’m 32 though! (About to be 33)! 

It does seem this sub is mostly 25 or younger though."
LesbianActually,ffckyz8,t1_ffaho5i,1579801677.0,Thank you!
LesbianActually,ffcjrpl,t3_esv2y2,1579800950.0,I’m wasting my day on xbox 1!
LesbianActually,ffbzcsy,t1_ffbgvjo,1579787494.0,Yes!! I was waiting on someone to get it and ask!
Sims4,ff94llw,t3_esck7l,1579704708.0,"No, I think this would be pretty neat! Similar to life orb rewards in sims 3. Have a funeral to complete end of life.  Gain random points for certain things occurring during funeral such as #of sims to show up, etc. type of funeral would depend on sims life aspiration. A family or popular sim may want to be remembered by as many as possible, an evil sim may want to die with life time grudge(s) and a loner would cross happily over if no one came but have difficulties if a lot of people came."
Sims4,ff8zq7z,t3_es7wv5,1579701110.0,Looks like a bathroom remodel gone wrong
