fatlogic,ffjocud,t1_ffhabt8,1580002921.0,"Yeah, panic attacks are super serious. I went through a period where I would get panic attacks on airplanes, and they were really scary. I'd hyperventilate and feel like I was going to faint, throw up, or just die. I also remember my whole body feeling really tingly and strange, like it wasn't completely a part of the physical world. It was horrible because I was already in a scary situation (being on an airplane) and it was compounded by the frightening experience of the panic attack. I haven't had a panic attack in a while, fortunately."

fantasywriters,ff3ihgl,t1_ff2xefd,1579541749.0,">In real life people have varying relationships with names. If everyone in your town is called things like ""Tim Johnson"" and ""Sally McCarthy"" and your character is called ""Dwellson Southcusp"", then it doesn't mean they can't be called that, but it shouldn't pass without comment, and their relationship with their name should have some depth, from how they view their parents, what other people make of it, whether they're teased, whether they use a nickname because they hate it, and so on.

I have a situation like this in a story I've been working on. One character is the daughter of a successful courtesan. The girl's mother was born with a very ordinary name (like, this world's equivalent of Annie Jones or something) but is now known only by the very flowery and elaborate name that she chose when she started to gain some success in my world's demimonde. Naturally, she gave her daughter a very flowery name as well. People sometimes make comments or raise their eyebrows at this name so the daughter goes by a simple two-syllable nickname. The names are meant to convey that this courtesan is sort of ""nouveau riche""--someone with a lot of money who doesn't always follow the tastes or conventions of the aristocracy."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ff1ox9w,t1_ff1kwb1,1579482928.0,"I am also a fan of sharp cheddar on grilled cheese. Gruyère is also excellent. I dislike the highly-processed American cheese in all forms.

fatlogic,fez02r4,t1_feoq1gm,1579452603.0,"I love going on walks or hikes for dates. It’s a great way to get to know someone. (Of course, for an early date I always suggest a popular and busy trail for safety! Wilderness adventures can come after we build up some trust.)"
fatlogic,felfrx0,t1_fek8u3z,1579221136.0,"In my copy of Tribole and Resch’s Intuitive Eating book, a lot is written about paying attention to hunger and fullness cues. For example, one of their ten Principles of Intuitive Eating is “Principle 5: Feel your fullness. Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry. Observe the signs that show that you’re comfortably full. Pause in the middle of a meal or snack and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what your current fullness level is.“ Additionally, in the Foreword to my edition, they write, “eating whenever you feel like it, without regard to hunger and fullness, might not be a very satisfying experience and might also cause physical discomfort. Attunement with your body’s satiety cues is an important part of this process.”

Obviously, people get hung up on the anti-diet mentality that IE promotes—the thing about giving yourself permission to eat what you want in order to avoid a restriction/binge cycle, the instructions to not count calories, and so on. On the whole I don’t think that IE is a particularly helpful strategy, especially since it is so easily misinterpreted by people who just want an excuse to overeat. However, I do think you are mischaracterizing what Tribole and Resch actually wrote. 

If their advice has changed since publishing the book, that would be interesting."

LateStageCapitalism,fe8a8fr,t1_fe6pb2x,1578924147.0,"I’m currently interviewing folks in Appalachia for my PhD dissertation (on an entirely different topic), and politics and Trump often come up. This analysis is pretty spot-on. Lots of people don’t have the time or inclination to develop a super complex understanding of political history, movements, or ideology.  They know that both the Democrats and Republicans have been responsible for economically screwing them over for a while now.  However, Republicans have been much better at taking some of the social/cultural things they value seriously—or, at least making a show of it to score political points. If neither party offers you an obvious economic benefit, then of course you’re going to vote for the one that makes a performance of valuing your religion and that doesn’t appear to look down its nose at your culture. That said, I’ve also met several 2016 Trump voters who said they would have voted for Bernie if he had won the nomination. I think “conservative” rural folks actually prefer left-leaning economic policies much more frequently than the DC establishment seems to think."

femalefashionadvice,fe4im3p,t3_enqu5y,1578859712.0,"This is 100% going to depend on the culture of your school and your discipline. Econ and poli sci departments tend to be relatively formal. The sciences, especially anything involving fieldwork, tend to be pretty casual. Urban schools in the Northeast are often slightly more formal than Midwest or West Coast schools. Idk about the South.

Yes, politics is and has always been a tool for keeping the poor and downtrodden ""in their place.""

My own personal preference as a woman is for minimal or no makeup, and I rarely wear any other makeup than tinted lip balm. (I'm lucky to be an academic and live in a hippie community where women without makeup is the norm.)

The problem is that a lot of men seem to not recognize when women actually are wearing makeup. A lot of ""natural"" looks actually require a lot of time, effort, and skill to achieve. People who are familiar with makeup laugh when men admire women wearing these kinds of looks for being ""natural."" At the same time it's frustrating, because very very few of us can actually wake up looking like those ""natural"" women who are so admired. It feels like we're being held to an impossible standard."
