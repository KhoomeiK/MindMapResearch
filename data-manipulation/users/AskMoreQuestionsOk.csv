MomForAMinute,ffh7kbw,t1_ffd9uyl,1579925347.0,"I’m sorry, my advice comes from my own experiences with various tragedies and being a mom.  

See, as a mom, if you can’t work but your kids will starve if you don’t, then you figure it out because there isn’t another option. If you have a mental collapse with kids, you’ll pass your mental illness to them eventually if you force them to be the caretaker while you play the victim. It’s true of adults too.  You wear out goodwill, a scarce commodity. So you have to find a way to get treated or deal with it, if not for your sake, but for theirs.  It’s unacceptable to pass your untreated stuff onto unprepared people if you can take steps to help things but don’t.  Avoiding your responsibility to yourself ruins lives.  You have to pull out of the funk. Even if you never feel normal, you need to keep at it. Is it rude to think that way? 

You can see the disconnect of my experience from your perspective.  I believe in self agency first and self acceptance second. if you do not feel love, then knowing love is the best you can do and that has to be good enough so get on with living.  I’m just skipping over the drama of the 5 stages of grief. 

You seem smart and capable, have friends but are stressed.   You can clearly do social media so consider looking into that for employment or try a special needs placement agency so you can get a real therapist."
MomForAMinute,ffd79mu,t1_ffd0mup,1579814794.0,"Well, it sounds like you need to help yourself. Therapy for a few months is better than none, and you need it so I would suggest you find a way to either wait in line or pay for a few months.

As far as ptsd, you may not be able to rid yourself of it, but you may be able to learn to manage the symptoms. Rather than stress over attacks or potential attacks, I would suggest you focus on the time between them and trying to maximize your life quality during those those between times.  I’m going to tell you that it takes time to learn to do it.  You have to accept that you have them, and put them in a mental box you don’t think about until you’re having an attack and when the attack ends it goes back into the box. Think about something positive. Don’t feed the monster.  Otherwise, you’re always upset.  It takes practice but it can work eventually.  If you have three 5 minute attacks an hour, you can have up to 45 minutes without one with the right attitude.  The hard part is the attitude. 

It sounds like you need more people in your life. Relationships are work, to have anything love you you’re going to need to put a lot of work into it.  You want to be loved, and the other person wants to be loved too in a way that they appreciate.  You need to accept that it requires you to put aside your needs and give the other what they need so they can reciprocate. You can’t just be a sick person. There are lots of lonely people out there. Volunteer organizations, senior centers, animal shelters, meet ups are great ways to meet people.

You can do this, make room in your love for a happier you!"

PoliticalDiscussion,ff74u0s,t1_ff725rv,1579641145.0,"You’re probably right on that account.  When the world was less connected, your local culture reigned and the church pulpit steered you toward norms. Education and indoctrination created the illusion of unity while everyone bitched behind closed doors and at water coolers.

We are in a unique age where information is too big to consume, and widely but not uniformly distributed.  A lot of this is so new that it will take time for things to settle into a stable state from a cultural point of view. It could be that awareness of divisive online discourse is itself a cultural touchstone.  I don’t think this is the end state, though. It will evolve, hopefully into something better."
PoliticalDiscussion,ff5v6v3,t1_ff5jb99,1579611372.0,"In the 90s, people, particularly democrats, discovered that if you attached yourself to certain political issues like climate change, you could influence elections. Before this politics largely stayed out of science.  

The rise of the 24 hour news cycle created a content problem over the higher quality nightly news that preceded it, necessitating the use of ‘talking heads’ and opinion pieces that are cheaper to produce over hard news.  

The shrinking of the global associated press due to the competition from free online print made this much worse as well as events like the OJ Simpson trial which took over TV news for an entire year- it got better ratings so, alas, companies made more of it.  So tv companies want conflict and drama and the news now looks like a tabloid. 

If you turn off the TV and get off of social media, the reality is much more subdued. Your neighbors have always been a little weird but they take out the trash and clean up after their dog. You don’t really care what their birth control policy is, or what religion they ascribe to.  You don’t care what they make so long as it doesn’t look like they earn too much more than you and they mow their lawn. Your life doesn’t change much no matter who is in office; they all want more of your money so they can change the world, supposedly for the better."

This is a massive engineering problem, but it doesn’t present itself evenly across the planet or according to wealth.  Some places just aren’t as negatively affected, and would rather put scarce tax money on something more essential, like healthcare.  And, realistically, that’s most places.  

It’s the same at the consumer level. Let’s say that the solution to C02 in the US is electric heat, electric cars, expanding the solar energy infrastructure and c02 sequestering for all c02 emitting furnaces. Every commercial building and most homes would have to be retrofit, and it’s very expensive, not including the cost of heating with electricity which is way more expensive than wood, gas or oil or we would all be doing it already.  Realistically you’d have to have a very significant tax over 10-20 years and then give homeowners big rebate to retrofit along with a mandate to end oil and gas to buildings and homes and you’d have to bring the cost of electricity down to oil and gas so old and poor people don’t freeze to death.

There’s no concept of placing responsibility on the people in militias or on Iran’s leadership or the people in charge of the button.  Using this logic allows someone to shoot at an American and blame America.  Palestinians have been using this technique for decades against Israel, so it’s not an exclusively American phenomenon.

worldnews,fdw28xe,t1_fds6ps8,1578754248.0,"No. It’s been a mess since Saddam Hussein’s government was toppled.  Even before. Just because the US press hasn’t covered it doesn’t mean it wasn’t a problem.   

And unbiased inspection of the culture of the area will show that many of the problems are due to a factional/clan based culture, which democracies can’t fix.  To rephrase an expression by Margaret Thatcher, you can’t make Iraq into the US, they won’t blend. She was referring to Europe.

When Saddam was in power he repressed Shia and killed Kurds. But Christians managed to get by. 

When his government was toppled the Christians had to flee and the Sunnis were repressed and the Kurds still killed. Why? Because the armed forces wouldn’t protect people from rival factions. It’s easy to imagine militias forming from such circumstances, because if the government isn’t providing stability you have to arm your faction or risk extermination.  This is not a problem caused by any invading force, but rather cultural. To break it requires breaking the clan based culture.

When ISIS militias started attacking Kurds in the North, the Shia would not send help. Imagine your government not helping you. It’s insane. But they are perfectly okay with them being slaughtered. The US had to come back to prevent them from being wiped out.  They didn’t want to and wouldn’t have had to if the Iraqi government acted more like a democratic government and treated their citizens equally. They do not. So the US came back.

But he’s in college now and doing okay. At some point you have to learn to be responsible, and high schools think 14 is a good year. 

My brother spent his first year at college partying, and when his report card came back with Fs, his college days were over. He went to work and got his degree when he was ready some years later. He’s doing okay now but at 18 he just wasn’t ready for college.

My question is to you, if high school teachers can expect students to be responsible, and parents can expect college children to be responsible, why do you struggle with passing judgement on the ones who aren’t?  You’re too nice. 

If you have regular office hours, a working email address, you let them work on assignments in class, that’s plenty of assistance.  Give an oral participation quiz - do students understand the concepts you’re teaching? If they do, then this is a them problem. If they don’t, then maybe it’s a them and you problem - maybe you need to find a new approach but you still need to have them let you know when they are struggling. 

But if a student isn’t prepared, ask them to leave.  You’re there to teach people who want to learn. If they don’t complete their assignments, tell them to drop the class; they aren’t ready.   Maybe tell them if they don’t hand in the assignment they have to deliver it orally in the last hour of class as a Hail Mary. In front of their peers.  But at the end of the day you get what you accept."

I have a copy of my dad’s US citizens handbook on nuclear attack. Did you get one of those in school?  Probably not. It’s hilarious.  You actually live in safer times. 

One of the downsides of instant communication is that you can see all the negatives at once.  It makes you feel under threat when you aren’t. 

But if you turn off the phone for a week and look around at the world you CAN control at your doorstep, you’ll see that it’s not filled with any more hate than what you carry with you.  It’s actually filled with a lot of mundaneness. Unless you live in a hot spot.

AskReddit,fddn28g,t3_ekt86j,1578318305.0,"I hear you.  You haven’t developed a habit circuit for exercise so your brain doesn’t know where to put it. Also, you may not see it as fun, so no motivation. You might have tried to take on a program that takes too long or is too hard for you, which is a real demotivator.

Put a pair of light dumbells by your chair and do a few kinds of exercises - one or two sets with 15-20 reps. Do a few lunges, sit-ups,  and pushups and call it a day - do it a few  times a week same time of day.  You don’t want it to be hard or a negative experience. Do it for two weeks. Add a 15-20 minute walk 2-3 times a week.  Start small until you have a habit. Change up the workout a little every two weeks.  

The two week routine I got from a book - ‘the body sculpting bible for women’, although the workouts would be fine at heavier weights for men, it’s the relatively short routine length that makes it easier to get back on the wagon, rather than the 8 week programs you’ll never finish. The very first 2 week routine is low weight, high rep to prevent injury.

Now, this book is old, and there are a lot of higher intensity workouts out there, but since I had such trouble starting high intensity workouts, I needed something my brain wouldn’t hate. Sound familiar?
So my suggestion is to start small. Even lifting the dumbells for 5 minutes is progress you can build on if you make it a habit.

My other suggestion is to do something that is fun to you. Doesn’t matter if its basketball or bird watching.  Do it with a friend.  Start a 20 minute walk around the block at the office once a week.  Go geocaching once a month."

Otherwise you might look rude, lazy, or some other negative trait that most people have awareness of and can correct for.

Do you have a proper diagnosis? Was there a specific test they did? 

My son has autism and you would never know unless I told you what to look for. For example, a typical person when they meet someone they say hello! How are you? Sometimes first, sometimes second. Well, my son for the longest time never said hello first. Always second.  There are lot of subtle things like that that a neurologist can tease out but a regular person just can’t see past the weird behavior.  He also has a trait that makes him sound bored or sarcastic sometimes even when he’s not.  He doesn’t mean anything by it, but a stranger wouldn’t know about it and might take it the wrong way."

For many years I was a scout leader and I would bring a super sharp chefs knife to the campout and hand that knife to a 6 year old to cut vegetables for cooking later.  A lot of parents cut their own kids’ food forget about letting them use something that can cut their finger clean off.  I’ve had to pull the knife out of parents hands. 

Anyway if you teach that child how to to properly cut with a knife at age six, by age nine they are safely independent with it and cooking meals for the camp by age 11.  

Most parents feel it’s easier to do it themselves because it’s faster at first and forget that part of building confidence and self esteem is helping their child be independent with skills like these. So I’m really glad chef dad took the time to teach him."

Lots of people were dying in accidents.  Good times. So, the government mandated cars to be made safer and passed not just seatbelt laws but airbag laws and crumple zones. Airbags are a thing because people were too stupid to put on their seatbelts, and the government wanted something that would protect people in the face of that stupidity. The seatbelt laws changed people’s behavior, and by the time the first cars were sold with airbags, almost all people were wearing seatbelts.  We still have airbags.

The same will happen with IOTs. The government will say it must be made safer, and companies will have to design systems to be more secure in the face of stupidity.  There is simply too much technology churn compared to education to suggest that people be on top of it all. If it wasn’t taught in school, at all times a certain percentage of people will be unfamiliar with it, and some unable to learn.  It has always been this way with software and those of us in the field are continually challenged to make software that is easy to use and secure.  Security remains an area of weakness.  Poor security design is perhaps the software equivalent of something catching on fire when it shouldn’t."
