I did. Many, many times. I gave up expecting answers. Eventually I wrote down a list of 10 true statements (e.g. on this date you said this quote, and on this date you did this) and asked for True/False (they were all true, and damning) from my 2 best friends. They refused to answer any. I said it was extremely important to me and some of the things they had claimed were hallucinations at some points, then other times said they were true.

It used to be nobody believed gaslighting was real. Now people use it interchangeably with lying. Its not. She could alter memories. If ever someone like this asks you to remember something out loud DO NOT VISUAL IT while saying it. Just write everything down that you saw and read your written statement. DO NOT VISUAL IT AGAIN! They will start implanting things, asking you to remember the memory slightly differently with a twist and ask if you are 100% sure, then say you only sound 99% sure so there is doubt. Every time you remember something your brain sets up a simulation, and they will keep getting you to resimulate it and alter it each time. They will lie with such confidence and certainty that you will read your own notes from 2 weeks ago and your memory of what you wrote down is totally different to what you wrote down.

Why on Earth not? It is so horrific for men to go through, and so so common, and you have a simple quick way way to stop it, using science. Why on Earth not? When surveyed men would rather be raped than fall victim to this horrendous trap, it is that bad for us. Can you imagine having nearly all your income taken for 18 years after finding your partner had lied to you and tricked you, and you would go to jail for not paying it even after proving the kid i not yours? You have the power to remove this pain and uncertainty with one quick simple swab test, with the ONE cost being women cannot lie about paternity any more, and you say simply 'no'?

How do you feel about the government making paternity tests mandatory?

No. Those failure rates are for *over a full year*, not for each sex session. So, for using both the pill AND condoms over 9 months the odds of still getting pregnant are = .13*.06*.75 = 0.00585 **= 0.6%**

Now to put that into context, an NHS Chief went on the record to say the odds of a child not actually being biologically that of the man thought to be the father is **10%** on average. So nearly 20x the odds that both birth control methods failed over 9 months. Thats not fully fair though as the number when paternity is questioned is actually higher - its 20%+.

If you got an anonymous text off a girl saying *he cheated* without evidence, but you thought it was worth checking, and then he terminated a long term relationship on the spot despite you being pregnant - how would you feel? Imagine if you were told he cheated on X date at Y time - it would be worth checking where he was at that time rather than 100% blind trusting him would it not? Or would you totally blindly trust him? You've said you didn't trust him fully in the relationship and seem not to trust all men based on you believing your mother - so then why have you so extremely punished him for not 100% trusting you? 

Men have some reason to worry about paternity is that there is a 10% chance the child is not ours when we are being told it is, statistically, according to an NHS Chief. Also some of us have been cheated on by otherwise very nice and trustworthy women who we had no reason to believe would cheat.  If you heard there was a 10% chance somebody switched your baby with another at the hospital, and the hospital said it was impossible and you needed to trust them, would it be worth doing a DNA test on the baby? Sometimes the woman might not even believe she slept with anyone else and they had their drink spiked.

You have gone nuclear on him not fully trusting you when there was quite strong evidence (you getting pregnant despite BC and condoms while having sex with him) indicating there might be a chance you weren't. You could have had some empathy and sympathy over his predicament, all he was asking for *was facts* to alleviate his confusion and eliminate a 10% risk, yet you terminated the relationship, ghosted, then aborted his child without his input."

> 87. ENTERTAINMENT LAWYER 01/07 **13**
> It's Way Worse Than Imagined: Within the past week, I wrote a blind about a YouTuber (Lia Marie Johnson) being sexually abused by her married producer/boss (Steven Wetherbee). Even though the YouTuber is now legal, when it started she was not even old enough to drive. Apparently she is just one of many in a new 2020 scheme of casting couches and abuse with the number of victims limitless and the ages of the victims often are 15-16 years old although there are victims up to about drinking age. If they get older than that, no one is interested. This brings together abusers who like males or females. It is an equal opportunity abuse situation. This is at levels unheard of and it is essentially being done in the open. One of the big financial backers of a huge group of these teens is a former A+ list television actor (Ashton Kutcher) who talks about combating human trafficking. That is what he is doing. All of these young to late teen kids are spotted online and promised fame and fortune with their social media posts. The names of the companies and talent agencies involved are elite. Parents send their kids out here to LA where they are forced to make content and the ones who get the larger dollars are the ones who have sex with the people from these various companies. There are at least two dozen of these groups around town and each generally has a male and female manager who are barely old enough to drink. They are the ones who keep everyone in line and make sure that new recruits know exactly what and who they are supposed to be doing. The managers get the highest rates for their posts and if they want to keep getting that money, they need to recruit, train and rotate as many new people a possible. One of the tricks being used is to hire porn actresses who are just starting out. Actresses who have been living in model houses with other porn stars who are 18 or 19. These porn stars then come in and start having sex publicly with any of the people living in the house who want to participate. They don't tell anyone they do porn. They try and set the mood and encourage everyone to think there is nothing wrong about the 15 year old going to a meeting with a 35 year old because the porn star is there telling everyone what the executive can do for their career. It is child porn/pedophile/grooming heaven and the parents are blinded by the money being deposited into their own accounts. The kids go home every few weeks but the parents send them right back to go make more money. The money they make in LA is a factor of five to ten higher than what they are making back home. The parents get addicted to the cash. There is booze and there are drugs and even members of the groups have reported being raped or sexually assaulted by others that live with them. It happens on an almost nightly basis. Ad executives and the executives from the companies they represent are throwing around cash and just destroying the lives of these kids. In addition to the actor mentioned above, a former superhero actor (Henry Cavill/""Superman"") is a big backer of another of these groups. There are a pair of B list actors (Scott Caan/James Caan) (Scott Eastwood/Clint Eastwood) who are each offspring of celebrities way higher on the list that not only are financial backers but have made it a crusade to be with as many of these teens as possible. One of the actors is closeted and has focused on the male teens like it is his job. So far, the old guard has not got involved. I don't think they understand how it all works."

After doing OMAD for 3 months and reaching 12% bodyfat I recently wanted to do 4 meals a day each with 35g protein for maximum muscle protein synthesis. It was really difficult to switch back to many meals and I failed. I have been unable to eat 3 meals a day even if I wanted to for the last 2 months. I eat 1 main meal a day with a small snack meal most days. People talk about diets not being long term sustainable but I really don't believe it. If you build the habits and make changes to how many meals you eat and eat quality food I think its easy to maintain.

There are people who fast for 200+ days and they only have water and those 4 minerals, and they lose hundreds of pounds on that alone and are healthy. Dont ever do that without doctor guidance of course. But for single day fasting just replenish your salts/electrolytes. Get your potassium from 'NoSalt'."

I had Major Depression. Too hard to cook and clean after myself and wash every day. Everything, no matter how easy and simple, took 110% effort and was so hard. Making dinner when getting home from work took 40mins and I just dreaded it and hated it so much I would often get fast food or just not eat at all. I actually started to literally starve and had to move back in with parents for a bit. 

Anyway I learnt how to eat 150g protein and 8 of my 5 daily portions of veg everyday with absolutely minimal effort. The secret is:

In one frying pan with olive oil put 500g of diced chicken or low fat minced meat. Add 250g of one frozen veg mix (e.g. frozen soffriuto mix (onion celery carrot), or frozen bell pepper mix, or frozen mediterrenean veg mix, or one of the other mixes in supermarket), then add 250g of another frozen veg mix. Add a spice mix or two (buy them off amazon, get ones with no salt). Cook for 15 minutes. Eat it all, from the frying pan if you want. This is 1200 calories and all your nutrion for the day - if you are not trying to lose fat then also make some microwave rice.

But you are right that for many people they just dont want to learn it as its a real cognitive barrier (it was for me once (I overcame it and eventually lost 45lb)), so setting it as a goal is a bad idea since they dont know how to accomplish it.

You actually raise a fantastic point about a flaw with the SMART acronym: it doesn't consider the fact that a goal might be simple and constrained and measurable, yet still hard to know how to accomplish without a fair bit of reading and mental effort which is a different kind of hurdle to the task itself therefore reducing probability of success."

I do think all ADHD people should spend a month looking at top posts in r/nootropics as there are a tonne of people there self medicating with a bunch of things less extreme than conventional medications like ritalin and adderall. Ritalin and adderall target the symptoms not the cause and some nootropics (ALCAR, GABA, taurine, B vitamins, creatine, zinc piccolinate, magnesium glycinate, many others) target whatever the underlying cause of the ADHD might be, which vaires by individual. 

That said I think taking the ADHD medication modafinil once a month is phenomenol when done right.

There is a mutual trust in relationships that we keep ourselves in shape for our partner and attempt to stay attractive and make an effort to keep some element of romance and desire alive. But you have spat in the face of this and laughed at him (""My boyfriend was repulsed (I wish I had filmed his reaction it was pretty hilarious""). Imagine if he stop caring about himself, put on a lot of fat or stopped bathing and ridiculed you for not liking it. Its just really bad for the health of the relationship.

There are some expectations when dating someone that they dont just change suddenly to be undesireable by their own choice. It is *your choice* to change your appearance to be different from how its been the time you dated him, but it is not *your boyfriend's choice* to find it repulsive. We dont choose what we find attractive or disgusting, and his disgust is relatively expected. So its an asshole move to create this situation out of nowhere and to find it funny. If he dumped you would you start shaving your armpits again to find a new partner or would you stand by this deicision - most people seem to make a huge effort in makeup/losing fat and putting on muscle after a breakup. For some reason we all seem to care more about appearing beautiful to strangers than to those who loyally love us.

At one point in time if I dated someone who did this I would use DEARMAN and persuasion to try to get them not to make this new change. Then I would have played the same card against them by doing things they disliked and I liked to make thigns less one-sided and in the hope to stop them from making another change like starting smoking or getting fat or shaving your head or whatever. But these days I usually see it as a red flag that they give no shit about relationship health or will likely become very unattractive soon and will not make an effort to maintain romance in the years to come. And thats a dealbreaker since you cant really change people.
