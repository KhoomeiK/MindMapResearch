Ayahuasca,ffogowe,t1_ffo38hk,1580077444.0,"The shaman I worked with didn't have me do a dieta or fast the day before the ceremony. Their is a lot of mis guided information and pseudo science surrounding ayahuasca ceremonies. If you want to go the ""traditional"" route that you read about online, that is completely fine. Its your experience. Just make sure you know who your sources are and why they are credible. John Hopkins University doesn't instruct their participants to follow any dieta before a ceremony.
Ultimately its entirely up to you so if you still plan on following the dieta make sure you are eating sufficient calories before. Tripping all night requires lots of energy.

Also, check out my post history on how to trip for self development!"
Ayahuasca,ffnk71t,t3_euaaal,1580067060.0,The dieta isn’t that important.
Psychedelics,ff5b32g,t3_ermvxl,1579585808.0,But ayahuasca isn't a root...
medizzy,ff4z7gb,t3_em05vm,1579576003.0,You mean pencil graphite.
Psychonaut,ff4k5fk,t3_erifm2,1579565567.0,"Jordan Paterson's past authoring program has helped me greatly. The purpose of trauma therapy is to recount the event in such a way that it no longer gives any emotional reaction. You will know you have completely released it when it is just information. This is done by writing about it an how to make sure it wont happen again or you can talk through it with someone. 

Reading the letting go process by David R Halkings will help a lot as well.

I find it best to meditate on a particular trauma and release it while on a microdose or low dose (less than 1 gram). Heroic doses have their time and place but to get the most out of them you need to work up to it. I have a guide in my post history that I invite you to check out.

You said that you don't care anymore which is interesting. When the subconscious feels guilty it attempts to punish the self through self sabotage. For instance you will drive recklessly because your subconscious wants you to get into a horrific accident. The way that will help you most is not another difficult trip. Take a microdose, put on the John Hopkins psylisibin research playlist (spotify:playlist:5KWf8H2pM0tlVd7niMtqeU) and release your trauma. 

Good luck."

Everyone is different so I'm not going to tell you how to act but if a girl I was dating cheated on me that many times it would be over.

Watches,ff3likf,t1_ff38sda,1579543601.0,It was my Christmas gift to myself and since then I've worn it almost every day. The crystal is perfect but I did slightly dent the rotating bezel.
Psychonaut,ff34uzn,t3_ere6ma,1579533720.0,Government jobs typically do a basic urine test. Drink a liter of water and take two multivitamins or vitamin c supplements an hour before. I’m not sure what the exact threshold for thc metabolites is but if you dilute your Urine enough by drinking water nothing will show up.
selfimprovement,ff3405n,t1_ff2spmm,1579533104.0,If you actually read their articles you would probably change your opinion
Watches,ff2axwd,t3_er8vzl,1579499133.0,The bracelet scratches pretty easily but its still a great watch. The rotating bezel makes a nice clicking noise that I like. Honestly thats the main reason I bought it. It makes a good sport watch and is durable. Mine runs about 30 seconds fast every day which is a lot but I suspect some of the inaccuracy is due to the fact that I commute to school on a bike and all the vibrations affects the timepieces ability to keep an accurate time. Even though it has a 45 mm case diameter the bezel is smaller which gives an appearance of a smaller watch. My wrists are 6 3/4 inch in circumference and it looks good.
seduction,ff2at7c,t1_ff25tug,1579499008.0,You should probably get better at reading a persons vibes or how they are feeling during the interaction.

selfimprovement,ff1zoj8,t3_eqz32v,1579489951.0,I like having coffee in the morning and afternoon when I get tired so I drink coffee.
Psychedelics,ff1zizk,t3_er6wwu,1579489840.0,James Fadiman has a helpful guide for microdosing. It does generally help people with mood but it won't fix a shitty life unless you change your circumstances.
selfimprovement,ff1z8zx,t3_er22mx,1579489638.0,"Being present to how you are feeling is a good place to start. One of the rules in 12 Rules For Life is to treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. Take time through the day to check up on how you feel. If your pee looks like a neon sign, then drink a liter of water. Tomorrow go get a haircut, shower, shave and put on clean clothes, notice the difference it makes in how you feel. Right now start cleaning your room. Put on music while your doing it. Notice how you feel when your space is neat and clean. Start being present in your body and notice how food you eat makes your feel. Eat an entire pizza and then notice how lethargic and gross it makes you feel in half an hour and even the next day. Notice your energy. Then eat clean and see how that makes you feel. Meditation can help but its difficult to get a practice started. Guided meditations are easier for beginners. Do it for 5 minuets the first day just focusing on the sensations of the breath. Then do it for 6 minuets the next day."
selfimprovement,ff1ylmu,t1_ff1wvs6,1579489175.0,"If someone is watching porn multiple times a day it would make sense to stop. But self pleasure is generally considered healthy, I think playboy has a good article about it and why their is a stigma against pleasure. Plus its great if you're having difficulty getting to sleep."

askseddit,ff1wdcz,t1_ff1medy,1579487680.0,"Its true that she loves the attention and praise you give her. Imagine if a bunch of girls you weren't that into were constantly fawning for your attention. Its an ego boost to her and since many women get their sense of esteem from their looks, they don't want to tell you their not interested because that would mean you wouldn't keep giving them attention.

Like Legend503 said, don't be butthurt and turn into one of the r/niceguys but develop some respect for your own time and have your own values in what you accept from a relationship. Set boundaries for yourself. I've noticed a big difference when I added a qualifying statement to my dating profiles. And just in general have standards for who you want to be with. Even if its just a casual relationship!"
selfimprovement,fevdnda,t3_eqe792,1579396203.0,I've found people will mistrust you if you are too nice.
Psychonaut,fenmai7,t3_eq3zlf,1579287728.0,Your sitter should be someone you trust but also someone with experience in psychedelic so they can guide you through potentially difficult parts. You could find a shaman instead.

askseddit,felj32t,t3_eprtfg,1579223386.0,Probably stop wasting your time.
selfimprovement,felib3q,t1_fek072n,1579222845.0,"Maybe you aren't eating enough calories or you're not eating good calories. Try eating an hour or so before you lift. I have experienced general fatigue too and eating more helped a ton.

You can also vary what time you work out and see when you are at your strongest. Energy levels can be thrown off by many different factors like sleep and caffeine intake, diet and the list goes on. If you have high levels of stress you will be fatigued all the time too so maybe look into meditating or another activity to decrease stress."
selfimprovement,fejzjgw,t3_epfsgd,1579189388.0,Do you warm up before lifting? Like run and stretch a little.
JordanPeterson,fej4tfu,t3_ep1hft,1579156934.0,"It does require a fair amount of time to think and reflect. Especially when doing the past authoring part. I did the past authoring over winter break when I had some time to myself. 
I guess it depends on how busy you are but you could complete it over the course of a few weekends. 
And you can always redo the exercises before going to higher education. It will be benificial to do the past authoring right away if you are burdened by difficulties in your past.

And if you think you can articulate thoughts better in your native language then do that."

Psychedelics,feihnxb,t1_f9nazmg,1579138759.0,look at my post history or read letting go by David R Hawking
JordanPeterson,feihhql,t1_feiafq5,1579138647.0,Porn is pretty well known to have damaging effects for men. Its unnatural to have that much visual stimulation so it can decrease the pleasure in actual sex. Masturbating is normal and fun.
Psychonaut,feih7q8,t1_feif74j,1579138466.0,I think I put it on the psychedelic subreddit wiki or the psychonaut wiki.
