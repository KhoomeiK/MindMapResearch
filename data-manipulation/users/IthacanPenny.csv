MaliciousCompliance,ffk2ulo,t1_ffk2cg1,1580014097.0,I teach an AP course. College Board does NOT offer language accommodations on AP exams.

grilledcheese,ffk0til,t1_ffhkxky,1580012345.0,"I’m new to the sub and have been warned that on the whole y’all are quite rigid when it comes to the definition of “grilled cheese.” I always kind of considered it a grilled cheese if the contents of the sandwich were made up of a majority of cheese by volume. Like if it’s essentially cheese that’s got some other stuff floating in it, then it’s grilled cheese. But if it’s majority other stuff with a slice of cheese melted on top of it, then it’s a melt. I’m cool with altering my definition though. Is your definition the one primarily used here?"
donthelpjustfilm,ffjz2hj,t1_ffjvvo4,1580010904.0,"It’s an underprivileged, urban school. Most of the kids never had the option to learn how to swim in the first place. There are also cultural taboos as it relates to some African American communities and swimming— I have even had a mother say to me ‘I would never let [my child] learn how to swim! It’s too dangerous!’ This attitude is not conducive to having water-safe children. 


Our swim team is not competitive. I mean we do compete, but we have no expectation of winning. The kids on my team honestly are accomplishing something just by being in the race in the first place. I am happy to take kids who don’t know how to swim. I will teach them how to swim, they just have to be willing to try."
MaliciousCompliance,ffjyajp,t1_ffjk2qp,1580010288.0,"While this is true, the College Board doesn’t care what your native language is. They only grade AP exams in English. A good teacher would/should have given you language accommodations during class time, but tbh if you’re trying to prepare for an AP test i 100% understand only accepting English responses."
MaliciousCompliance,ffjy3p8,t1_ffjesem,1580010139.0,"I teach at a very diverse high school in Texas and, without passing judgement on the morality of the policy, the policy at my school is to grade work in English. Students have to take a number of high stakes tests that are only graded in English and we are trying to prepare them for those, as well as for entrance into and success at American universities, which also by and large grade work in English. I think that during class time it is vitally important to reach students by any means necessary, and if a language barrier is preventing me reaching a student, it is part of my job to find a way around that barrier (like having a strongly bilingual student partner with he struggling student). However, come assessment time, if a student is not able to communicate their knowledge, that is going to affect the outcome of their assessment and there is not much I can do about that. I think it’s worth noting that I teach AP Calculus. I would never ever take off points for things like spelling or grammar errors, but I definitely correct improper English, and I also have to prepare my kids for the AP exam which will only be scored in English. The decision about the scoring AP exams is well above my pay grade, all I can do is prep my kids the best I can. 


Another thing worth noting is the extent of diversity at a given school. My school, for example, has over 200 different languages represented in our student body. A number of students speak native languages that are not written languages, so their work wouldn’t be able to be translated after the fact but would have to be done in real time and that is not feasible. Similarly, a number of students speak a tribal native language but were initially schooled in a different language (this is primarily the case with African students who spoke a tribal language at home but were then schooled in French or Swahili in Africa before coming to Texas). Those kids tend to code switch using the tribal language for more familial communication and the lingua Franca for more formal communication, and getting a translator who speaks both the same languages as the kid, again, is unfeasible. Idk if there is a perfect solution to any of this, these are just some additional considerations you may not have thought of."

mensa,ffjvbhy,t1_ffjoua2,1580007947.0,"Ehhhh I think there’s not necessarily enough evidence in the linked story to know that for sure. But you’re probably right, somehow kids in being Mensa always rubs me the wrong way. Not because I think they’re not “smart enough” to be there or anything like that, but because I just generally think it’s a bad idea to tell kids that they’re gifted in that it can make kids less likely to work hard and more likely to become perfectionists and to struggle later in their schooling. I’d be curious for anyone here who was a child Mensan to weigh in. Am I way off base?"
