dataisbeautiful,ffrd96d,t1_ffnleqf,1580155677.0,"the three most common moves for white to play on move 1* are c4, d4, and e4. Against c4, d5 makes little sense. d5 is common against d4, but not as common as Nf6. Against e4, d5 is the scandinavian defense which is fine but not particularly popular."

Are you talking about the champions of Europe right now? Because I'm pretty sure youre saying that the champions of Europe didnt look that great last year. I'm pretty sure thats what you're saying, so I just want to clarify that you're actually saying that the champions of Europe didnt look that great last year, and that on that observation you think Juve is better than them."
