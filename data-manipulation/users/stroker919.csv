AskHR,fetdv7o,t1_fep10wh,1579374360.0,"You’ll want to understand valuation per share as well as how many more shares they plan to issue.

If there’s 500,000 shares out and they’ve raised $1,000,000 it’d be $2.00.  Not a likely ratio, but you get it.

You have to understand what their plan is for additional equity.  Likely they will wind up issuing a lot more shares and you’ll get diluted (the value per share will be lower) as they go for bigger tranches.

Sure there’s the millionaire maker stories out there, but when you’re working for a start up they give you the equity as something to offset the risk you are taking and have some skin in the game.

I would not consider it as anything other than gravy and not as compensating for something lacking in any other part of the offer.

Usually it winds up worthless since most startups fail.  If that happens you don’t want to double down on a bad normal package and equity that went to zero.

If they are a making it out like it makes up for not paying you much or bad benefits then you might want to understand more, but ultimately you can’t do anything about it and you’ll get what you get if they go public or get acquired.  

I would not get bogged down in it and just focus on what you think the business prospects of the company are.

For your average in healthy person the basic equation is pretty well baked in.  Eat a varied diet of mostly unprocessed foods and don’t eat too much.  Avoid sugar and especially HFCS as much as possible.  Exercise just to move around some.  Strength training first whatever floats your boat after than.  Sleep as much as your schedule allows.

If you have more specific goals or discipline/motivation problems you can get into stuff that’s more regimented or extreme to get into the community feeling and make it more of a hobby.

There are hardcore fast people who think anything other than 18-6 is weak and useless, but I’ve heard a lot more “expert” opinion that 12-12 is good.

I eat normally most days, but if I’m busy and my energy is up and I’m not hungry I’ll skip a snack or lunch.  I think basing it on feel is good psychologically and physiologically from how I feel.  Works well enough to maintain a high single digit body fat into middle age and I never have to do anything weird or deny myself the occasional dessert or just eat what the family does.  I might just eat less if it’s not on target.  I want my kids to know I work at it, but don’t obsess over it.

They key is give anything you do 90 days to see results and if you don’t like it or feel like it’s working change it up.  Before you do just make sure you’re honest about the effort you put in.  If it was 100% then move on.  If not give it another 90 days and do better.  Ultimately you’re a sample size of one and you shouldn’t care about what works for other people.  There’s no guarantee on long term outcomes with anything, but if you’re actively trying to be healthier trying something with a plan is better than nothing."
