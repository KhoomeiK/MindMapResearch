And I'd be careful with mats, I don't know a lot about petco, but a lot of general pet stores have things that are advertised as rabbit friendly, even if they aren't. It's a good idea to be careful. 

Also, if she's young, her age might have something to do with it. Make sure her diet is appropriate, and you really should take her to a vet still, any intestinal issues can be a big problem for a rabbit. Their guts are very very sensitive, and small disruptions can end up horrible. But maybe just giving her more hay would be a good idea, or just letting her eat hay for a while and leave the pellets for a bit. Just make sure she always has a big supply of fresh hay."

I would agree, that before you should have talked to your friend, most people are understanding in that kind of situation, and he would likely be able to see you'd need to be there for your GF.

But the way she responded, while sure she's grieving and has a lot of emotion to deal with, it's not okay for her to act like that when you're offering support. You need to really consider if a relationship where someone responds like that in a crisis is worth it, and then talk to her. Tell her you're still willing to support her, but if she really means what she said (probably wait a bit before you ask her, give her time to breathe a bit and think about what just happened), you should not go to the funeral. 

And I'm sorry, but who the hell gets pissy over someone not using an enthusiastic tone, to announce that they're going to a funeral? Of course it's obvious you want to go to the wedding, it's your best friend. That should make it even more meaningful that you're choosing to stay and support your GF."

It's a good idea to, when you're talking to the vet, get a time for your new bun too, to get it sexed properly so you know what to do, and make sure she has the proper shots and everything is alright. If it is a female, even though your male is getting neutered, you should definitely neuter her as well. 

If there's anything else you need tips on, or advise or anything, asking specific questions or describing what you're doing now could be a good idea, and don't hesitate to make a post or ask (I'd be more than happy to help with whatever I can). And good luck! She/he looks adorable. <3"

If he had just said ""I'm not willing to care for a child, whatever you decide is up to you, but I'm out if you decide to keep it."" would have been reasonable, except he didn't do that.

Rabbits,fe5f0co,t1_fe3x884,1578868658.0,"Vets don't have to focus a lot on animals like rabbits during their education, which is fine there are a lot of animals to learn about. That unfortunately, also means that some vets don't know enough about rabbits, to properly put them under, or perform certain procedures on them. (Or even in some cases give appropriate advise, I swear I've heard vets tell people it's okay to keep two rabbits in a relatively small cage together.) That's why it can be important to find a rabbit savvy vet, basically following u/ecofriend94 's tips. If you're at all worried that your rabbit won't be taken care of properly, or if you have any other concerns, then waiting a bit and looking around/asking the vet some questions, is a very good idea."

If you aren't 100% sure, then calling her a racist based on assumptions, even if you really feel those assumptions are true, makes you kind of an AH. Especially if she isn't racist, and truly just didn't like you and the other guy for whatever other reason. For all you know, she could be there looking for someone to hook up with, and could have heard that you and the other person have partners, and therefore wasn't interested.

Health insurance for an animal is actually financially a great idea for any pet owner. It makes it so you don't have to pay a shit ton of money every time you do need to see a vet, and with the amount of time she's already spent at the vet with this cat, it only makes it sound like it's an even better idea. Especially if all the vets seem to think it's an older cat. 

You're talking about it, like she's some kind of moron for loving a cat, and for wanting to keep it healthy and happy. That's what you're supposed to do, when you get a pet.

It takes a lot of guts to realise and acknowledge the abuse you've endured, or even to just question if your thoughts of being wrongfully treated are right or not. And they are, they have been horrible to you.

Are you sure the abuse is worth saving a bit of money? I've heard a few of JW views on education, so it's probably not the best place to stay if you want to do something that requires a college education. 

And honestly, do your parents really deserve you in their lives? With the way they've treated you? Would you accept that kind of behaviour from a friend? If not, then don't accept this kind of behaviour from your parents. If you need support, or help with how to figure things out in case you want to get out of JW, then there's a reddit community called r/exjw they seem very nice, and I'm sure there's some people there who could have some tips. 

I'd also seriously suggest therapy, if you aren't already getting that, and move out. You're not in an environment where you can get better, so therapy would be harder and maybe wouldn't help that much. 

I really hope things work out for you, and sorry but fuck your parents thoughts on you. They don't get to have an opinion on how you act, what you do, or anything like that. At least not one that matters. They're horrible people, and with how they act, you should feel proud if you disappoint them. I hope you get to that point some day."
Rabbits,fdjcu9t,t1_fdimgre,1578465617.0,"I gotta agree with the other people, it sounds like all those problems can be solved by getting him neutered. Which isn't a bad thing at all, there's no reason at all to keep a rabbit that isn't neutered, unless you plan on breeding. Your rabbit will be a lot healthier, and happier too! So there's no reason at all to feel bad about it. 

If you haven't already, you should see a rabbit savvy vet, not all vets are equally good about dealing with rabbits unfortunately, and it's good to have one who knows how to sedate your rabbit properly, and who can walk you through what will happen and what you'll have to do. It's of course a good idea for you to look into what you should prepare for.  [https://rabbit.org/vet-listings/](https://rabbit.org/vet-listings/)  This site has a list of rabbit savvy vets, if there isn't any there near you, I'd be happy to help look for one. 

With the hay, just make sure he has a fresh supply he can eat from, and maybe look up how much food you should give him, the amounts on the packages aren't always a good guide."
Rabbits,fdih1a6,t3_elgpa2,1578442728.0,"You might have to stay on them for a bit, like watch them, and whenever you see them lifting their tail to pee outside their litterbox, pick them up and place them back in their litterbox. I do remember reading about how bunnies can forget a bit of their litterbox training, when they move to a new place. So it might help to just redo some of the training.   
If they aren't neutered that could play a part too. 

I sometimes had a few issues with my rabbit peeing outside his litterbox, like he'd sit in it but pee over the edge. It usually only happened if I overfilled his litterbox with newspapers, hemp bedding, and hay. I had to learn to leave like 5-8 cm of room, so he doesn't pee outside of it (I know, it can seem pretty obvious you shouldn't fill it all the way up, but it didn't for me at first.) 

Maybe a good idea could be, again going back to a bit of litterbox training, could be to place more litterboxes around their area, specially around places they've had accidents. I know if they're already litterbox trained it could seem silly, but they're in a new place, and might need some help being reminded of where to pee. 

I hope it all works out, and they look absolutely adorable. <3"
AmItheAsshole,fdicvsc,t1_fdhmzq8,1578440033.0,"Idk about you, but I sure was a bitch sometimes when I was a teenager. I sure as hell was whiny too, and goth actually. Teenagers go through phases, and just because he's her father, doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to see when his kid is being a bitch, or whiny, or anything like that. As long as he doesn't call her any of those things to her face, I don't see what's wrong with acknowledging it. I would laugh now, if my father described my teenage self with any of those words, because it's true, and it's pretty funny to look back and realise how I was a silly teenager, who did silly teenage things. 

  
And people, teenagers more so, are influenced by the people around them. Her boyfriend could very well be a big reason why her behavior has changed. She could also just be generally more happy, most people are when they are in a happy relationship, and how someone else is can definitely rub off on you.

Rabbits,fbysygv,t3_ef13xg,1577225493.0,"No one has mentioned it yet, so I thought I might. 

If you have a bottle, throw it out and get a proper bowl instead. Rabbits drink a lot more water than you think, because they need it, and it's a lot easier for them to drink as much as they need/want throughout the day if they drink from a bowl. I know this, because I at first had a 600ml bottle, where my rabbit would drink a bit over half of it a day (300 - 400 ml a day), I got him a bowl last year that holds 1 liter (1000 ml) of water, and he drinks at least 600 ml a day, he's a lot happier with it. (and honestly, he makes smacking noises when he drinks and it's super cute) So definitely please at least consider getting a bowl. 

Also, neutering. If you haven't done so or thought about it already, specially with female rabbits, it's important to neuter them. I know it's a bit expensive, and can seem like a lot of money, but it's really the best for the rabbit. You won't have to worry about ovarian or any kind of uterus cancer (from what I remember, there's a 60% chance they'll develop that within a certain amount of years, and the chance of them developing it just increases after), plus they'll be so much easier to train with litter boxes. (If you've already made up your mind, or gone through all that, then please ignore this part.)

Have fun with your adorable new little bun."
