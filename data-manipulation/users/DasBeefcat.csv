If you do have rent for Feb and on time, I would go down to the ofc and ask to speak with the manager. Go to them, tell them your story and tell them what the deal is, with the rent check. Lay out that ""I will sign something that says if I'm late again, I will be out in 28 days"" and then ask if a small rent increase would help. If they say no, then you have used up all your chances with the person and you need to move on. That's really all there is to it. They have a right to expect their money on time.
