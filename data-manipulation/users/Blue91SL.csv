Justrolledintotheshop,ffepzki,t1_ffejf8w,1579859679.0,"The Quad 4 is just a fuel injected iron puke. The ecotec is completely different in terms of quality and performance. The ecotec was the only engine in the progression really worth a shit. And even then... I mean, they're good little commuter turds. But I wouldn't consider any engine in that family ""strong"" without a turbo. And you can't even boost an ecotec without rebuilding it. 


The iron puke, though, man... We played with a few. One of the guys I went to high school with bought an 83 Camaro as his first car (at the time it was 22-23 years old) and he was super psyched about it. We all had kind of ""fast"" old American cars, and we were happy for the kid. He was nice but didn't know Jack about cars, no one in his family did. But he earned the money and plopped down $800 for this thing. Ran great, real quiet. We used to go as a group to the local 1/8th mile strip on Saturdays, and the week he got it he came with us. We knew a guy with a Satellite wagon with a motor home 413 with a 2bbl in it, and we set them up to run. Should have been an easy kill, that wagon could roll the tires off, but it was slow as shit. So they line up, and the kid gets absolutely dusted. Pop the hood, BOOM. Iron Duke. He's devastated when we tell him it's not a V8. He went home and told his parents he was going to switch the motor, they told him in no uncertain terms that it would never happen. So we set to trying to goose it up. Buddy's dad polished and ported the heads, got a big Holley 650 2bbl, and we put exhaust on it. Took it to the Dyno... 65hp to the wheels. He drove it for a few years until he went to college, and one of my friends bought it off of him. We dropped a 383 stroker in it and ran it at the drags for a few years. Got put into a wall at 80mph and turned to scrap, sadly. 


The engine the iron Duke ""replaced"" was a better engine, imo. The Vega's overhead cam, aluminum 2.3 even got an upgrade from Cosworth and fuel injection! One of the first fuel injected cars in the states. When Pontiac developed these things, they screwed up. Instead of chopping a 400 in half (a-la Trophy-4 in the 61 Tempest), they made a boat anchor. One designed to lose cam gear teeth after 100k to get it in for a major service at the dealer. (ps if anyone has one, the Chevy 250 6 cam gear solves that)

They're remarkable at surviving, but I still have no idea how. They should have died a hundred times over."

There's nothing wrong with a fleet manager trying to improve the appearance of the trucks. And, if the company is run effectively, they're doing a necessary job in a way that prevents excess damage to the environment."

Showerthoughts,ff4zyr0,t1_ff4vgyv,1579576559.0,"I actually have. From dogs starved to the point of clinging to life, to ex-fighting dogs, and a few sexually abused animals too. Part of convincing an abused animal to trust you is proving that you're here to benefit them. Don't push yourself on them. Let them come to you on their own terms. When you consistently prove that you're there to support and care about the animal, the trust grows the bond between you. When you make that bond, that dog will always be loyal to you. My last dog lived a very hard life before I rescued her. That dog would have gladly died for me, and never left my side. The same amount of effort on a human would have had a high chance of still ending up shitty. 
The chances of rehabilitation are so low on people because they're drawn by their own selfish wants. Dogs in general seek the attention of their pack leader, and they see you as that."
