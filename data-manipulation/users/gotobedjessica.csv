As I sat with my baby trying to eat my meal, a lovely lady came up to me - put her hand on my shoulder and said “motherhood is hard, you’re doing a good job”.  I burst into tears, she gave me a hug & 2 seconds later my baby was out like a light."

I think it’s a great option as long as you’re not too hard on yourself - we still used disposables when we were travelling overnight & couldn’t wash.  You can buy cloth nappies second hand pretty affordable & there are some great Facebook groups to help you out with a wash routine. I literally just posted a pic of my washing machine and someone sent me the right settings to use :) 

Most People have trouble with their nappies and rashes If they’re not washed/sanitized correctly.  

We also bought one size fits all nappies that snap bigger and smaller which was more affordable in the long run too."
