ChoosingBeggars,ffugwy2,t1_ffuflnv,1580241707.0,"The proudest moment I ever had of thinking quick on my feet was with my stepson.  I had three stepsons, twins and their 6 year younger brother.  So the twins knew santa wasnt real but the little one didn't.  He was 5 at the time.  We had wrapped most of the twins presents and put them under the tree but the little one had very few presents under there because most of his would come from ""santa"" on christmas eve.  

He was playing around under the tree one night and then turned and asked why his brothers had lots of presents under the tree but he didn't.  His dad looked at me like ""oh shit what do we say"".  In a moment of pure brilliance I told him that Santa had called us.  His brothers had been so bad that year that Santa said he was only giving them coal and rocks so if we wanted the to have presents then we had to buy them for them.  So they had presents under the tree because we had to buy them since santa wouldn't.  But he'd been so good that year that Santa was bringing all of his presents.  But you can't tell your brothers, I told him.  It would break their hearts if they knew Santa was upset with them because they'd been so bad.  So this has to be our secret, I told him.

That night we tuck all three boys in and go to bed.  The twins said as soon as all wa quiet in the house and in their room, the little one sat straight up in bed and told them that they weren't getting ANY presents from Santa that year because of how bad they acted, lol.  He couldn't wait to tell them, lol."

ChoosingBeggars,ffh00mu,t1_ffg10i6,1579919467.0,"Since we were little she has always been this big drama queen and as we grew up it just got worse and worse.  I distanced myself from her for a very long time.  We reconnected thru our moms and facebook. She's one of those that no matter what happens to you, it has happened to her and it's a lot worse and she will tell you about it.  I'm telling you she has no filter and no boundaries whatsoever!  And a lot of times she sas things that I know are just flat out not true.   Earlier today one of her friends posted to her how she was having this horrible back pain and is getting a breast reduction to make it better.  My friend posts back to her that she used to have horrible pain and had to have a reduction.  That is such BS.  She's never had big boobs, ever.   She's posted things like she took flying lessons from Evelyn Johnson, which is BS as well.  The only planes she's been up in besides going on vacation are when my dad took us up when we were growing up.  Evelyn taught my dad to fly but this girl never had any lessons yet she says she has.

ChoosingBeggars,fff8175,t1_ffeofgy,1579878025.0,"I keep an old friend on my facebook just to read her daily drama.  It's awesome.  The entertainment value is so high.

Recently she had a major blow out with most of her female friends who have now cut her from their lives.  What was it over?  deer bacon.  I swear, lol.  Someone had left some deer bacon at one of her friend's houses for her husband who doesn't eat pork.  She says her friends ""stole"" the bacon and ate it and she found the evidence in the trash.  She went on facebook and called them out, cussed them, called them thieves, basically lost her mind.  Then evidently in private she realized she had lost it over something stupid and apologized but by then they had had enough.  So she goes back to facebook and calls them out because they won't forgive her for her one freakout.  She is a major narcisist and the kind of person who posts entirely too much info on facebook.  Yesterday she had a post that said ""drank two cups of coffee and now going to take a shower"".  So that gives you an idea of her posts.  She has NO filter an NO boundaries.

After the big fight with her friends then a few days ago she makes another post digging at them again.  The post was how you can't trust your secrets with people because then they get mad and tell your secrets.   She was saying she couldn't trust them but then she turned around and posted their secrets!

Some of my current friends are reading her page for the entertainment value now too.  It's a hoot!"

slowcooking,ffcs1u9,t1_ff94set,1579806085.0,"I'd be happy to!  I will give you the easy version I cheat and use a lot.

To me, the key is the Better Than Boulion Roasted Chicken Flavor base.  It gives the broth such a rich taste, better than I can do myself using chicken and roasted bones.  

I also usually make mine in the crockpot but you can do the same recipe on the stove, whichever you like best.

I start with chicken pieces, bone in if you have it.  The taste is better, IMO, but boneless is fine too.  I usually cook 3 or 4 breasts at a time but only use 1-2 breasts in the dumplings.  

In the crockpot but your chicken pieces.  Using the chicken base, make enough to make 2 cups and add to the crockpot.  I go a little heavy on the broth recipe because it has to flavor the dumplings too so I had an extra spoonful or two.  Mix in a large can of cream of chicken soup (or two regular cans) undiluted.  Add a stick of butter and cook on low all day.

When the chicken is ready, remove from crockpot and shred.  Taste your broth and add more base if needed to make a really rich broth.  

At this point you can do one of a few things.  My quick cheat recipe is to add a 12oz bag of dried egg noodles, extra wide.  Stir once to coat all noodles in the broth, put the lid on and crockpot on low and cook for two hours, do not stir.  The noodles get soft and squishy like this and break down a little and make really good quick dumplins this way.  My dad prefers it like this and he is a true southern man.

If you want to make dumplins from scratch they arent hard either, just a little time consuming.  If you are going to make them from scratch make about 3 cups of broth with the base when you cook the chicken.  When the chicken is done, in a bowl combine 2 cups of flour, 1/2 c of crisco shortening and cut into flour then add small amounts of the warm chicken broth until a dough consistency.  Roll out very thin, cut into strips and then into squares.  When all of your dumplings are rolled out keep them on a plate until ready to use, coating lightly in a little flour so they don't stick together so much.

when your chicken is done and you take it out and shred it, add your dumplings to the broth, stir lightly then put the lid on for about 1 hour, do not stir until finished.  Then lightly add the shredded chicken and combine and put on warm setting until supper is ready to eat.

Easy peasy southern dumplins!"

dogs,ff4i5yv,t1_ff3efdi,1579564194.0,"She guards them so obsessively that I've wondered if I should take them away from her and not give them back.  I guess she is hiding it from Zac even though she knows Zac can't get on the bed by himself like she can because she is different at bed time.  When it's just the two of us (Zac sleeps with my dad), as soon as she sees me put on my pj's she seems to relax.  She finds a final place to put it for the night in her nest but then gets comfy and doesn't sleep on top of it like she does the rest of the time.  
It's so wierd though, the burying things.  Sometimes she will just get up, go get a couple of pieces of her dry kibble and take it to her nest and bury it for no particular reason.
Should I just leave her alone and let her be how she wants to be?  I just don't want her to have behaviors that are causing her stress."

She guards her sticks obsessively constantly.  She even sleeps on it sometimes.  She will grunt at me if I get near it sometimes but lets me take it, move it, rebury it for her.  She is hiding it from our other dog but in doing so is obsessed with hiding it.  
she also buries everything in the bed especially pieces of food.  
i call the bed her ""nest"" because she has so many things buried in all the blankets.

The first time I tried them, I didn't tell my family I was trying some new egg recipe, I just cooked them low and slow.  My husband and my step son both just dug into the food like they always did....like starving men, until they both tried the eggs.  I was just sitting there acting normal.  As soon as they both tried the eggs they started saying things like ""omg what did you do to the eggs?  these are the best eggs I've ever eaten!"" type replies.  After that, I've never made scrambled eggs any other way.

She will also lay on her prize chew stick of the moment and guard it obsessively.  Ive tried taking it away from her but that distresses her even more.  Sometimes when she's trying to bury something in her blankets with her nose she will let me help her bury it.  I can take my fingers and cover it with a blanket and pat it down then she will take her cute litttle feet and pat it down after me.  The cuteness, it's adorable."

This was him on his throne of pillows on his couch.  That's where we'd lay the baby, on those pillows with him, when she was crying.  He would snuggle her and keep her safe until she stopped crying.  This was his favorite spot in the apartment."

I can't find the picture of her riding him like a horse but I will.  This was him on our Christmas float in the parade.

A newspaper guy followed the float with a drone to see when he woke up because it was so funny.  He woke up just as we were finishing and refused to get off the float.

And he was spoiled every single day of it.

aww,fepge6w,t3_eq9wl8,1579319835.0,"I didn't have a pit, I had a pug that did this.  My BFFs (a couple) moved in with me when she was about 5-6 months pregnant.  He loved to lay his little head on her belly.  The day she went into labor he literally sat staring at her belly the whole day.  He wouldn't go to bed with me that night, he insisted on getting in bed with them.  He knew immediately when she had her first contraction that night.   We'd been laughing at him that day because he was so snuggly with her that day and jokingly saying she was going to go into labor and darned if she didn't.  He knew!

My BFFs have 2 older children (3and 4 at the time).  He didn't pay them much mind at all.  But the day they brought the baby home from the hospital he claimed that baby girl as his.  He took one look at her and climbed up in her car seat and sat on her like ""mine"".   They were inseparable.   When she was an infant and wouldn't stop crying, all we had to do was lay her beside him on the couch and she would stop immediately.   Then she'd cry if you picked her back up.  He would nudge her when she was crying and give her tiny little licks and it hushed her immediately.

He helped her learn how to walk.  She would hold on to his fur and pull herself up.  She didn't take one step that he wasn't beside her for.  He even let her try to ride him like a horse when she got more mobile.

When she graduated from baby food to people food they shared everything she ate.   She taught him to love tacos.  They had to be meat/cheese only.  They would eat tacos every day if we'd let them.  One day whe they were eating them, I broke his up into pieces and put it in his bowl.  I walked around the corner to find both of them sitting in front of his bowl eating tacos from it.  It was the cutest thing ever.

When we got some stairs for him so he could get in the bed by himself, she had to teach him how to use them.  

They had the sweetest friendship you ever saw.  She's almost 5 now and sometimes she remembers him and tells me she misses him.  He passed away 2 years ago."
