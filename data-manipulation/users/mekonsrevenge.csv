Theoretically, a shrinking market would lower prices. And probably create layoff. I am not arguing in favor of that, just the lie that freezes equal cuts. No one knows. I remember that period and Democrats were facing unrelenting GOP pressure to cut all social programs to balance the budget. Democrats (I had never heard of Joe Biden then) responded, ok, freeze everything, you pricks. The repukes backed down for a couple of year, then started up again. The Dems used the same response. That is almost certainly what Biden was doing. My main point is lying is not good and shows enough desperation that he might let Trump win."

And he'd met her clubbing and she gave him her number, one digit off from mine. One night, the phone rang at about three and I went off. And the guy started yelling back at me. After some mutual unpleasantness, it turned out it was Valerie's brother and her family was worried because they'd been calling for weeks during the daytime and it just kept ringing (probably because I was at work and had no answering machine). I told him about the late night calls and he said, yeah, sounds like my sister. We live in L.A. and she's supposedly in college.
