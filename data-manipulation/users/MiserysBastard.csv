But one I remember more recently is from the originals when Elijah gets his memories back and learns that because he had chosen to lock away his memories of his life and family in the first place he allowed Haley (the woman he loved most) to die and he could have stopped it but he didn't cause he didn't know her and she was sided with what he thought was the enemy.

I'm ever angry at the fact I exist in the first place but then when I start to imagine how I'm going to attempt next my bloody mother comes into the picture. The anger has been reducing this feeling somewhat though but I still can't imagine killing myself without the thought of my mother, which is odd cause she's the reason I wanted to hang myself with a belt at age 7 (and she told me to go ahead lol)."
depression,ffeq2lg,t1_ffepr99,1579859812.0,Which isn't a problem cause I won't be alive to care whether I experience it or not unlike now where a lack of good can cause me emotional/psychological suffering. Which is MY point. And further I'll never experience the bad again.
depression,ffepnwu,t1_ffeoz0c,1579859188.0,"You have a model for that kind of society to know that that would be the case? What is appreciation anyway? In such an existence as that what would it mean to be unappreciative? What would it manifest as? Would there even be a requirement for appreciation? What would be the consequence of lacking appreciation?

Yes you experience neither good nor bad when non existent. Yet you suffer no loss for the absence of good for the absence itself is not experienced."

Which by our current standard can be termed as good."

I for one don't share my dark thoughts and feelings with people in my life. I know there's nothing they're gonna say that'll make feel better or inspired or whatever.

I've since tried to ignore everything I've ever read about confident behaviors and walking is becoming less of an anxiety inducer(amongst other things). Ironically when you stop trying to act confident sometimes you just become more confident, even if it's a little, cause really confident stems a lot from not caring about other's opinions, which can be hard to do when you're constantly thinking about whether you appear confident enough to other people."

Not that I have any experience with this (I'm FA as fuck), just going off the fact that most women are not gonna respect and wanna be with a man who seen prostitutes.

Sure they can attain varying levels of happiness in their independence yet for them to still seek relationships there's still a hungry spot to fill. Maybe it's not always there or it's there in varying degrees at different times but it's still there. The desire to share full life experiences would itself still constitute a need they have.

You speak as if the woman would be entering this relationship as a favor/duty to him. Would she have nothing to gain? Would she be going into the relationship because she felt it was her responsibility? Why? And why assume the only scenario that could play out is of her being a helicopter mom? Again you speak as if all he can do is recieve whatever it is she has to offer without give and she'd be there solely for the purpose of fulfilling her perceived duty to this person.

Would you say he's placing a burden on her shoulders even though she loves him and chooses to remain with him of her own volition? How would you define whole? Is it not possible to be in a relationship while you're on this journey to being ""whole""? Should I reject any and all romantic opportunities/proposals for the reason of ""I'm not whole yet""? Is it not possible for a relationship between two ""half "" people to fail for the very same reason a relationship between two ""whole"" people could fail (e.g straight incompatibility)?

For the other people's sake?  It's very rare to find people who actually couldn't give a quarter of a shit about having other people in their lives. But the fact is people do need others to be whole. Otherwise why all the mental health advice about seeking people who'll care and all that shit. It don't mean other people should be the ones to paint your picture but there's definitely a place for them in your picture. They can definitely help you paint it. We're a social animal after all.

depression,fdnh2ld,t1_fdnauk1,1578585652.0,Yes. Suicide by overdose is actually a fairly unsuccessful method. A lot of people don't know that. It's normally depicted as effective and just falling asleep peacefully. Documented cases show a method such as paracetamol overdose can be an extremely excruciating experience with a lot of damage to your liver and other systems. If you die it could sometimes take days of suffering before you go. Not a good way to die.

Well he came out himself before passing out and I had to drag him outside before I got someone to help me put him in the car to rush him to the hospital.  And the ride wasn't easy. I felt guilty for failing to talk him out and not driving fast/effectively enough. He survived though and he's really well mental healthwise, though he's been having challenges here and there with life. But he's overall good. Point is you shouldn't beat yourself up cause whatever happened you really did well on your part. It's not an easy situation to deal.
