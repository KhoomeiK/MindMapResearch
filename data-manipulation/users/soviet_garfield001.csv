Aquariums,fdfvc4a,t1_fdfrsm6,1578371188.0,"Nice! She looks really good I can still see a bit of similarity, but wow, I can definitely see why you might mistake mine for a male. If I can find out what type (or would it be morph? I'm really not sure) they are from they LFS I got them from, I will let you know."
Aquariums,fdfo33s,t1_fdfdc5g,1578366167.0,"also her fins aren't nearly big enough for an approximately two year old fish, if she was a male."
Aquariums,fdfns9t,t1_fdfdc5g,1578365970.0,"yes I am sure as the male is obviously a male (much larger and more colorful fins), and they have bred, the babies did not make it though. I forget what type they are, but my male is larger, but he is basically gray with bright red and black fins. Her fins aren't very red, far more of an orange color."
Aquariums,fdfnb3p,t1_fddz579,1578365656.0,"I haven't gotten into ferts or CO2, but what I use a lot is  Aquavitro Aquasolum Black Humate. It lowers the pH and is basically a fertilized soil. Unlike most captive bred fish, plants aren't as tolerant to large varieties of pH(s?), so make sure to choose the right plants. Yes, I have two HOB filters, and they do have carbon, it's just there because that's what it came with, but I don't need it as I get my water from a well. With the amount of plants I have, I guess I don't really need them except for aeration. Do you have filters in your 17? You should be doing water changes anyways, how much and how often depends on filters, plants, and fish."

DnD,fdd0s7r,t3_d93t3k,1578290298.0,"dragonborns don't have tails. What most people think a dragonborn is actually a half-dragon, complete with wings and tail. They are unfortunately too overpowered to be a player race.

Aquariums,fdd05ra,t1_fdczpib,1578289652.0,"they do. Due to the quality of the photo, you can't see how many open spaces there are between most of the plants. They swim through easily, and they like to hide in the bushy parts. The rotala jungle on the far right has a space in the middle that a lot of them like to go into."
Aquariums,fdcwttn,t1_fdcwd9r,1578286633.0,"Yeah, it's taken it a long time to get here, but I love it. It had a massive algae bloom that killed off a lot of plants. Then I decided I would upgrade to a 40g but once the algae started dying down, I began to really just appreciate it for what it is. Sure, it's nothing like a biotope, but it just feels wild. So, long story short, I agree with you."

Aquariums,fdcsvwk,t3_ekogen,1578283376.0,"I originally got her just so she and my male could breed, but she is now the prominent fish in the aquarium, while the male chills in the bushes. She recognizes me when I come into the room and responds to the glass tap that signifies dinnertime. She is honestly my favorite fish I've ever owned."
Aquariums,fdcsaac,t1_fdcs8qm,1578282866.0,thank you!
Aquariums,fdcs334,t3_eko83b,1578282701.0,"Fish

* 1 electric blue ram
* 3 honey sunset gouramis
* 3 sparkling gouramis (used to have 5, but two of the older ones died)
* 1 bumblebee catfish
* 3 otos (I need to get more)
* cockatoo dwarf cichlid pair
* 1 male platy (took down one of my other tanks and had to add him)

Plants

mostly rotala indica and pearlweed, but there is also ludwigia( I forget which species), java moss, anubias and some sagittaria.

There is a piece of spiderwood in the center that the pearlweed and, I guess rotala runners, grew around that is now basically a two story cave.
