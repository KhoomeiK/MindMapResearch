NintendoSwitch,ffsrn88,t3_euy3pu,1580190000.0,Very cool of you to do this. Hopefully you can get back into game dev with an awesome idea and keep living the dream.
mildlyinteresting,ffsmmxn,t3_euxlrd,1580185574.0,That’s just a pack of black ants all face down ass up.
aww,ffsjny5,t3_euv37u,1580183346.0,"My kitty looks the same (she’s 11) and her real name was Petunia! We have always called her Honey though. We got her for free when she was 1 from a coworker who didn’t have time for her. Best cat ever. Won’t be able to get another cat after she moves on.

Forager,ffqks45,t1_ffqjp9k,1580137275.0,Prob gonna hold off and restart once update drops. Game is fun already but I feel like I’m missing out huge right now.
Forager,ffqf9s1,t1_ffizuc0,1580132861.0,Q1 of 2020. Not January.
Forager,ffqf83n,t1_fflgg7g,1580132823.0,Weird flex but okay!

wholesomememes,ffp4muf,t3_euchub,1580086124.0,Sadly this garbage just goes to another landfill (hopefully) or on a truck where they then dump it into a river because it’s cheaper. Or the garbage just gets burned which still kills us all. We’re fucked no matter what. At least the beach looks nicer!
FortNiteBR,ffn9m9y,t3_etyx91,1580063469.0,I want a nodachi. Rippley runs with the fishing pole like a bad ass and it would be amazing.
NintendoSwitch,ffmy9h4,t3_etwkr1,1580060166.0,Amazing

minnesotavikings,ffhe62i,t1_ffds47e,1579931585.0,He had fantastic stats for the game. The defense let Jimmy G only throw it 7 times... 1 person can only do so much.
GreenBayPackers,ff4gf9b,t1_ff4au16,1579562995.0,Same. Best buddy is a Lions fan to the core. There is no winning an argument with them.
wholesomememes,ff1wx2k,t1_ff1vrbh,1579488051.0,That’s a great point actually. Intently listening and showing them you care what they have to say vs just hearing them say words. I’m glad I commented on this post!
wholesomememes,ff1syzk,t1_ff1rxwi,1579485493.0,Good point about explaining why. Though sometimes it might just be because they are talking too much lol. When you can’t even think straight... it’s hard sometimes to give an explanation. I will make sure I try harder to put myself in his shoes and how I’d feel being told to be quiet just trying to talk to my dad.
wholesomememes,ff1ibrf,t1_ff1flny,1579479671.0,Thank you
wholesomememes,ff1dn2m,t1_ff0jfc8,1579477831.0,"This hit me hard. I say this to my son (8yrs old), though a bit more politely. Doesn’t make the message any less mean though. I need to stop putting down his inquisitiveness."
mildlyinteresting,fem47px,t3_epoe07,1579239201.0,"I use these at work too, and find myself randomly drifting away from my desk at times, they are so smooth. Makes the day a bit more fun lol."
insaneparents,fem420e,t1_fejycbr,1579239046.0,I mean... it’s probably their property to break. Just sayin. Still insane though lol.
detroitlions,feb4oal,t3_eny1s2,1578955362.0,It was given to us for the no clear recovery fumble fuck up. Sorry guys. Maybe next yea... Hahaha. We’re going to tank so hard in San Fran anyways. It’s all good.
Forager,feb2bjm,t3_eob95b,1578954814.0,Will this be in the console update? Or do we have to wait for this one after the drop?
detroitlions,feaznn2,t3_eo5vp4,1578953923.0,Lol you sad fuckers.

gifsthatkeepongiving,fcoes78,t3_ei2ucl,1577830486.0,Man one small misfire on that knife and all those cut tomatoes are ruined! Love that dad and his face though. Like watching my son play Mario Odyssey and beating a boss.
Switch,fcl6d2y,t3_ehnkef,1577740772.0,Your gf just lost her bf. Congrats! I just got one for me (and my 8yr old son).
