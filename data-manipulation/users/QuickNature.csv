AskElectricians,ff6vtu6,t1_ff6v9d1,1579635924.0,"I did a little research and some calculations for you, and with the load you are trying to apply to your service, I would highly recommend a 200A service. A good electrician is going to plan for future expansion and also want a safety margin associated with his work. You could likely stay with a 100A service if you didn't get the furnace.

Edit: If you do decide to upgrade and plan on living there a while, do yourself a favor and get a 200A Square D QO panel with 42 slots. You could probably run every receptacle on a dedicated breaker with that many slots but you'll thank yourself in the future. Plus the price difference between the 30 slot and 42 slot is going to be minimal."

instant_regret,ff6tidd,t1_ff6t9x0,1579634563.0,A GFCI receptacle can detect a fault current of 0.005A or greater. Or as stated 5mA
AskElectricians,ff6sqpi,t3_erxqpj,1579634107.0,"From the minimal amount of information provided, you are absolutely going to need a 200A service. The problem you would run into with an 100A service is multiple of those high amperage appliances being on simultaneously plus whatever else you have on in the house. 

Also, I would recommend you post this to r/electricians and know the wattage of the appliances you are planning to install."
HomeImprovement,ff6bt9i,t3_erupbn,1579623762.0,"Planning and research is going to be the basis of every task you take on. Also, estimating the cost of each project is an invaluable skill. If you make a tool and materials list to create an estimate it will have several benefits. Some projects might be more cost effective to hire a professional, and some might be better handled by yourself. It also allows you to double check if you have planned for all of the required materials and tools.

Another thing is prep work, and staging of materials. Again this depends on the task, but if you think through your process before starting it helps a lot. It's often said, but I can't stress enough, measure twice and cut once.

Some work you might want to do might be dangerous, such as electrical. When it comes to tasks like that, YouTube is an invaluable resource. The main thing with stuff like plumbing, HVAC, and electrical is ensuring you can properly interpret codes and implement them correctly.

Edit: I forgot to mention, YouTubers who discuss code requirements are preferred. It isn't a guarantee that there material is 100% flawless, but it is an indication that they know what they are talking about."

instant_regret,ff65kse,t1_ff43wuw,1579619670.0,"It depends on the type of protection provided. If it's just a just a fuse like in old houses, the circuit will likely stay closed.
