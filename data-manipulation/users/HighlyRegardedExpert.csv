unpopularopinion,ff674vm,t1_ff5znb0,1579620722.0,"Honestly I think you would benefit from watching the Ken Burns documentary on the Vietnam War. 

It speaks to American, North, and South Vietnamese soldiers including POWs, infantry, and lots of people were on the ground and still have vivid recollections of the time and everything that happened. 

It gives what many consider a clear and levelheaded history of the events that led up to war, what happened on the ground, and I think it will change your perspective on Vietnamese boat people, how they got that way, and what happened to them for the better."

It's almost like Hollywood really wants to associate taking extreme measures to combat climate change with super villainy and make sure the kids who go see these movies continue those associations well into adulthood.

AskReddit,fdksig0,t1_fdkc5he,1578510241.0,"Nah. The last big fight we have I told her that she was honestly the biggest detriment to my success in college and listed all the things she did that made it unnecessarily hard for me:

1. The two raids on my bank account

2. Calling me furious about the fact that I bought a $1k laptop instead of the terrible $300 ones she said was all I needed. I was a CS major and was very happy using a MacBook Pro for all my work. TBH I think she was just furious because she wanted to use that money for something else. 

3. Threatening to not cosign my student loans, forcing me to forge her forms using old tax documents and take them out anyways. (She claims she was just trying to scare me, but that makes it worse IMO)

4. Overall being a drag on me financially while I was in school. I needed a new car and had to take out a student loan to buy one, I couldn't make payments while in school and needed a way to get back and forth. She did not offer to help me with anything. And her car was repossessed because she missed her last two payments and I had to cough up $1k to get it out of the lot. 

All of her bullshit has centered around money because, frankly, she's terrible with it and is the kind of person who'll trade in a year old brand new car for the exact same car but with some feature that was added in the next year's model. When I put a down payment on my latest vehicle (that I bought with my own money) she asked me ""if somebody is giving you money, why would you give some of it back?""

I explained to her that until I make that last payment it's not my car, it's the bank's. They have the title, they are entitled to repossess it if I stop making payments, and even if I crash it and lose it they're going to expect me to pay them back for it. 

The best thing I ever did for our relationship was unentangle us financially."
AskReddit,fdkbjc8,t1_fdj7f73,1578500388.0,"My mother absolutely stole money from the bank account she opened for me. 

The first time she did it because she didn't want me to ”waste money buying a ps3” mind you I was in college and now I have to beg her for money to eat. 

The second time was when I had my first internship and it paid out in two lump sums. The first lump sum she straight up raided my account for and told me that because she was my mother it wasn't stealing. 

Today she says she doesn't remember doing any of that, which is convenient for her"

politics,fdejjts,t1_fddz2xi,1578340379.0,I would raise the cap on Congress before removing the EC. It's always interesting to me that this simple non-constitutional change doesn't get more attention. If we need a good growth function then we can cap the size of the house at the cubed root of the current population. That would mean having ~690 representatives and a significantly less annoying EC.
