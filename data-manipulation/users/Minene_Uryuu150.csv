CasualConversation,fef5wkp,t3_eolpwf,1579048930.0,"Oh, sweetie. I’ve grown up with cats my whole life, and whenever my cat displays affection (licking me, purring, not running away) it means the world to me. You aren’t alone. Whenever someone says someone’s gonna be a lonely old cat lady, I retort with “You can’t be lonely with cats” for this very reason.
Wishing you and your cattu a great day!"

This is how you show your child that you love and support them. It’s sad that some kids have parents that throw them out for not liking the opposite sex, or not identifying with the gender they were born into. 

This is how you be a good parent. Also, you’re a stepparent, so take that homophobes!
