television,ffqwus0,t1_ffqvpek,1580145453.0,"I wouldn't compare it to Youtube. Youtube is a social media platform. People exchanging dialogue and conversations. It is on par with FB, Twitter, etc.

Netflix is no different than a premium cable channel. It is creating, choosing and pushing out content to viewers.

They are not comparable just for the sole fact that they have video content."
television,ffqvlqo,t1_ffqvc1b,1580144645.0,Entitlement is the wrong word here. I had no issue supporting the platform for years. They made a wrong decision. I no longer value the platform. That is all.
television,ffqvg1l,t1_ffqugrk,1580144543.0,Cheap would mean that I didn't want to give them money just because I wanted to save the money... I have been giving them money all these years... clearly that wasn't the issue. Why would I give money to a service I no longer value? That would be wasteful an stupid.
television,ffqv7o7,t1_ffqrq24,1580144392.0,"You can't compare social media to television and entertainment platforms. At all. They are governed completely differently. And if a person choosing to cancel their subscription is something you find to be pretentious, then I have to question if you even know what pretentious is, and how educated you are. Likely the type of person to consume that anti-vax propaganda."
Stadia,ffqubl0,t1_ffqu1f1,1580143815.0,Sure. I get that they currently are on vacation. That doesn't change the overall situation.
xbox,ffqq7xf,t1_ffqq0i9,1580141094.0,"I also came from PS4 and agree. The value far exceeds what was offered by Sony. Not to mention Microsoft was willing to push crossplay when Sony was trying to crush it. Obviously from a business standpoint it makes sense, but I am the consumer so I can give two shits about their corporate profits."
television,ffqpt8x,t1_ffqpgaq,1580140821.0,"I could still watch Netflix content elsewhere.

Also, this isn't about people getting scammed out of their money because they buy useless garbage. That is the least of my concerns. She promotes ant-vax propaganda. That doesn't just affect the person who believes the non-sense. It affects the public. It is dangerous."
television,ffqjcbw,t1_ffqgjb4,1580136190.0,If I want to do mindless scrolling for content I can just hop on YT.
television,ffqjayp,t1_ffqisxt,1580136161.0,Nope. I have known of a good few that work like a charm. I just liked streaming in 4K... but I can do without for a few shows. NBD.
television,ffqj89e,t1_ffqgepl,1580136103.0,This. Best believe I won't miss The Witcher...
television,ffqj4ld,t1_ffqiy3t,1580136025.0,"Please point out where I was ""crying"" or whining."
television,ffqj1vc,t1_ffqijm5,1580135967.0,"I am not sure what you mean about Prime video. I never used it. 

And everyone has the option to choose which company is crossing the line. We all have our individual ethical boundaries. This is my line. It was crossed. Simple as that. I am not here to change your mind. I do however think it is absurd of you to claim I will backtrack and resub when you know nothing about me."
GooglePixel,ffqig61,t3_eunq9b,1580135495.0,Sometimes... Only because the best WearOS right now is a Chinese brand. But I am not leaving Android for iOS... so that always straightens me out pretty quickly.
television,ffqib5s,t1_ffqgzya,1580135385.0,"How is it not unrealistic? It isn't the only streaming platform. In fact it is my least used platform of the ones I sub to. Granted it and Hulu are the two that I kept year-round... I am baffled by the people who actually believe this service is the end all be all of streaming. 

Lest we forget, if I genuinely felt compelled to watch some of the shows I like that are exclusive to the service there are ways to view them without giving Netflix a dime. The service is for convenience more so than it is for access to the actual content."
television,ffqgok8,t1_ffqg9fh,1580134065.0,"Sure... If you say so. I also cancelled Amazon Prime 5 years. Not due to their terrible employment practices that others have boycotted them for, but because they are just overall terrible in my area. I can spend my money elsewhere to get the things I need. Just like Netflix. I can get my streaming needs elsewhere."
television,ffqfud4,t3_eunq9d,1580133354.0,"Today is a few days before the end of my current billing cycle. An hour ago I went in and cancelled my subscription. They ask you why before going. I selected ""Other"" and wrote ""Goop. I can't support the spread of disinformation."" Simple as that. I'll vote with my dollars. It may not be much, but at least it'll be off my conscience."
Stadia,ffqdqrx,t1_ffnlz6t,1580131494.0,Shouldn't really matter where you are playing them. What should matter is where you open your account and that your billing address matches that region. It's 2020. We fucking travel. That was the whole gimmick.
Stadia,ffqdigp,t1_ffmcwjc,1580131282.0,"I think that isn't the point. If someone leaves their country for work and will be there for awhile, having access to the games you've bought on the cloud would have been nice."
