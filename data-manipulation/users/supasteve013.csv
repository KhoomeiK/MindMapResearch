WTF,ffbbefu,t1_ffb2oi2,1579758447.0,"A cloud of CO2 so large it covers an entire lake and its surrounding village is a bit of an extreme case, especially compared to the video. They're not saying it's impossible to kill you, just that it's pretty damn unlikely. Under normal circumstances your body detects high carbonic acid as dissolved CO2 and increases your respiration rate to expel more, obviously if you continue to breath in essentially pure CO2 you won't last long. The thing about CO2 vs CO is that CO doesn't let go of hemoglobin, so when you do get that one breath of fresh oxygen it's too late. With CO2 poisoning, it just leaves your blood and oxygen comes right in just like normal."

Hell since there are so many studies showing that it's ""better"" find me a meta-analysis on the topic, maybe one with low publication bias comparing cigarettes to vaping. 

Do I believe that vaping is safer? Yes, I believe it's safer and ideal for quitting, at least the ones that use good oils. We also have an huge uptick in the number of new smokers thanks to vaping being cool from companies like JUUL. Worse yet, many are getting significantly more nicotine, smoking the equivalent of multiple packs per day. 

Just because we believe it's better doesn't make it true, NEJM has numerous reports about serious lung issues that occur in a short period of time, unlike cigarettes. Sure you don't smell, you have better lung capacity, etc. but there simply isn't enough data on it to go around telling the public it's safer... at least not yet, otherwise Marlboro would do it too and no one would still be smoking cigarettes.  

There's also the question of whether or not e-cigarettes even encourage smokers to quit, and the question of whether or these flavors are to encourage teens to smoke.

AskReddit,fcocq63,t3_ei21zo,1577829036.0,"About 12 years ago I worked at Rite Aid as a pharmacy technician. This very pretty blonde comes in and has a prescription for penicillin, I thought no big deal. She's a little flirtatious, I flirt back but don't ask her out or anything. She comes back 2 weeks later for Augmentin, again flirts. 2 weeks later and she's getting Flagyl, Diflucan, and some antibiotic. This is the point where I think she's got an STI, and I wonder how I never realized before.

Now she starts talking to myself and the pharmacist about how she's had an infection for about 5 weeks that won't go away. She thinks she got it in Las Vegas, when she stayed in a penthouse suite at the Playboy Hotel and that they partied heavily and spent a lot of time in the pool and hot tub. Actually sounds fun though, let's be honest.

Now, back to the register and she totally flirts this time significantly more, this time I intentionally didn't ask for her number. 

Was this a mistake? I may never know.

Probably should have asked her out after her infection cleared up."
