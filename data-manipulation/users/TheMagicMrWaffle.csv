People kept saying “where THE lighter” and it was mine so that pissed me off.

Fast forward the next day I go out and buy like 10+ lighters and every time someone asks where the lighter went I just fucking throw one at them.

I ended the weekend with 7 lighters which were all stolen within the next 18 hours when we got back home."
