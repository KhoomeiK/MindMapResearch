It would probably be similar but I'm guessing you would lose a little volume, also you would run into a left channel right channel issue, so it may not sound great unless you play in mono.

What about adding a wifi extension or switch to a mesh network setup, Orbi, Google, etc."
politics,ff6zv4r,t1_ff676ud,1579638300.0,"That's not actually true.  Most people only think of the Cabinet members and other Secretary of an agency positions as political but there are actually alot of them across government.

For DoD agencies, they have the Secretary, Deputy or Under Secretary, and 4 Assistant Secretaries for each component (Army, Navy, Air Force, OSD).  DoD and it's components changing its top leadership all at once would be very detrimental and some of those appointees are actually quite well qualified and are acting in the best interest of accomplishing their mission.

This is why administrations change over time, make the changes but do it in a 6 month to 1 year timeframe, not overnight.  Because if that happens overnight, all the non politically appointed SES will push their pet projects as their new bosses priority and trust me, you don't want that kind of disorganization on the scale of the DoD."
