OurPresident,ffxan8q,t1_ffvd0gh,1580321238.0,"More lobbying? That’s the problem! If they’re allowed to do more lobbying, then the price of prescription drugs will skyrocket even more, now compare that to the prices other countries have on prescription drugs. Also, Bernie isn’t a socialist, he favors a social democracy."
LatinoPeopleTwitter,ffxaczc,t1_ffvzlks,1580321066.0,"It’s sad some Latinos/as are still have those blinders that disable them to see Bernie as he is. Their version of Bernie is what Univisión or Fox News tells them. Thankfully, a good chunk of Latinx voters are voting for the man who would go up against the President who has bullied our community for a long time."
TopMindsOfReddit,ffx4nw7,t3_evlxcc,1580317670.0,"Trump supporters are so hypocritical.

Trump supporters: We despise leftists who accuse us of being Nazis because we have a different opinion.

Also Trump supporters, after learning about a tv show featuring Nazis being killed: HoW dAre tHEy?! THeY jUSt wANNA kiLL uS! *sad violin music plays*"

stupidpol,ffvsy5s,t3_evbedz,1580272346.0,I heard a little bit about the whole Project Veritas’ video of an alleged Bernie staffer saying about re-education camps and stuff. What’s the story actually about? Is it true? Because I would argue Project Veritas did it to take down Bernie’s campaign and help Trump.
WayOfTheBern,ffvsjd1,t1_ffvhrvf,1580272019.0,"I realized that when this impeachment thing started, it all started simply because since Trump did his infamous phone call, corporate Dems rushed to defend Biden because Biden is part of the club (Trump is part of that club as well), and that’s why the inquiry should’ve been expanded to more stuff Trump has done."

OurPresident,ffri51u,t1_ffrgucv,1580158463.0,"As much as I love to form a third party. The fact of the matter is, there is an institutional bias against third parties, so no matter we try, our voices will still not be heard under this system. That’s why I have hopeful for Justice Dems, Our Revolution, Brand New Congress, and others who are trying to make the Democratic Party listen to working class folks, not the elites who run the party. The best thing we can do is try, by volunteering, by registering as a Democrat (in case the DNC screws the vote again), and make sure that people vote for Bernie enough that it prevents a second ballot and hopefully the Sanders team will crack some skulls so Medicare for All, for example, be included. It’s easy to be cynical and defeated even though we’re winning, but we need to give it all. We can do this!"
