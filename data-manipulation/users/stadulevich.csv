The red flags to me would be what if my house doesn't sell? What if it sells for less than anticipated?(Do I have to pay back the difference out of pocket?) What if it takes long to sell?

The whole ""after I ejaculate gay just isn't me feeling"" was cause I suppressed alot and it took a long time to become at peace about it all. You have to remember you have been trained and manipulated to be a certain way for 20-30 years. Even though you realize you were trained to be something you're not, it takes along time to undo all of that. It is a confusing process, but oh so rewarding when you manage to achieve balance with it all. As for good and bad experiences with man/woman/trans etc. I think you will find that after you find the balance I'm talking about, it wont matter so much about how they identify, but just the character and personality of the individual that matter in dating. When you build that connection and they are open minded and adventurous the sex gets out of this world."

I will say too, that he has prob been raised in an environment that praises masculinity and looks down on feminity, so it is really hard to be able to be honest with his thought and feelings because if his subconscious making him think he is weak fo doing it. There is alot of phsycological things going on beyond just him being bi. He has to break away from a whole culture that makes him feel like he isn't worthy of being a person.
