ForensicFiles,fdj1vpr,t3_ello19,1578456295.0,"I'm curious who they have narrating, either way, PT is irreplaceable. I just hope it's another deep and soothing voice. I like how FF doesn't have gratuitous reenactments that take center stage. I feel like I'm watching a shitty B movie with awful acting with some of the crime shows out there. I like the facts, the science, real crime scene photos/video. Please no sensationalism or over-dramatization, that would really kill it for me."

AskReddit,fbvhti7,t3_eeki65,1577131006.0,"Puff the Magic Dragon. It's a lovable kids song about a child and his dragon friend. The last two verses describe how the boy grows up and out grows playing with the dragon and it's sad as fuck. I remember crying over it as a kid because I felt so bad for Puff.


>
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff


>
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name


>
A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar


>
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.

:( Fuck you, Jackie Paper, you ruthless cunt!"
