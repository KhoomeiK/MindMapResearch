None of us is confused about why we're fat.  It's just very hard to stop overeating.  Most diets are just calorie counting while trying to trick yourself into believing you're not counting calories by using carbs, or changing schedules, or other methods that don't actually work for a lot of people once you're fat past a certain point.  As soon as you cut enough calories to lose weight, your body reacts like you've just quit hard drugs, and you're distractingly miserable and bad at your job and emotional and cranky with your family until you give in and binge.  There are people that manage to do it, but very few manage to maintain it over the long term.  At this point I honestly think everyone on reddit who claims losing weight is easy and simple is just so young that they've never experienced the combo of full time work plus stress plus a slowing metabolism after 25."

Over time a very harsh selection honed the tendency into a more complex-looking behavior.  No thought was ever really involved.

Grimdank,fenctx7,t1_fenb59r,1579281949.0,"* I SHALL RETURN ALIVE: These Primarchs think they can tank the most suicidal challenge.  Lion el'Johnson (Dark Angels) is known for his tremendous arrogance (he once punched Leman Russ off a cliff for laughing at him during a duel), Fulgrim (Emperor's Children) is known for his perfectionism and overachieving attitude and Ferrus Manus (Iron Hands) always had the attitude that ""the strong shall survive.""

* COOL, WHO DO I HAVE TO SUICIDE: Leman Russ (Space Wolves) is known for his enthusiasm more than his intelligence and also for obeying the Emperor whether or not it's a smart idea (also see: Burning of Prospero, laughing at Lion el'Jonson during a duel). 

* JUST GIVE ME THE ORDER: These Primarchs are known for their untiring adherence to the Emperor's plans, but also for their general weariness with the amount that rests on their shoulders (this being one reason Mortarion, Primarch of the Death Guard, defected to Horus during the Heresy, among other  story reasons).  Roboute Guilliman is Primarch of the Ultramarines, the Emperor's poster boys and the most vanilla Legion, and Rogal Dorn, of the Imperial Fists, is a close second on that.  

* FUCKING FINALLY: These are the most emo of the Primarchs.  Corvus Corax of the Raven Guard is known for his silent brooding, Angron (World Eaters) is known for wishing he had died at De'shea, and the Night Haunter (Night Lords, and only Daddy really calls him by the name Daddy gave him, Konrad Curze) has always been loud about wishing he was dead.

* NOT AGAIN: These Primarchs don't die.  Vulkan (Salamanders) is a Perpetual, a rare individual who is truly immortal and really can't be killed.  Alpharius is known for his entire legion claiming to be him, and he may or may not actually be already dead and/or be his supposedly dead twin brother and fellow co-Primarch of Alpha Legion, Omegon.  (As a side note this is why there are so many jokes about them being the shortest Primarchs, because most Primarchs are over 12 feet tall but few space marines reach 8 ft.; Alpha Legion are tall for Astartes but nowhere near average Primarch size.)"
Grimdank,fenb59r,t1_fen8l1i,1579280912.0,"Welcome!  

These are the Primarchs, the Emperor's 18 specially engineered ""sons,"" each meant to be in charge of a different Legion that shares their geneseed.  Each one also has an elaborate backstory, so I'll try to be succinct.

* SCREAMS INTERNALLY: These are Primarchs who are known for their intense frustration with their father and his edicts.  Magnus (Thousand Sons) because of the Edict of Nikaea (basically telling him to stop using his psyker powers when he was made to be a psyker), Perturabo (Iron Warriors) because his Legion was always chosen for the most grindingly awful jobs, and Horus (Sons of Horus) because his frustration with the Emperor's not confiding in him and vanishing for undisclosed reasons was part of what made him vulnerable to Chaos and kicked off the Heresy.

* I HAD A GOOD LIFE: These Primarchs are more inclined to take things philosophically, so presumably they would respond to the suicide mission concept with resignation.  Sanguinius (Blood Angels) was always very fatalistic and resigned, the Khan (White Scars) always had some kind of pithy remark, and Lorgar (Word Bearers) was very religious and liked to pontificate.
