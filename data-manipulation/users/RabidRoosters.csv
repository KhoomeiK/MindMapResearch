I know of at least two dudes who were recent widowers.  Each of them met a woman online who was ""out of their league.""  Beautiful women.  Crazy in bed, fabulous cooks, great with the kids...you name it, they did it.  Houses were bought, weddings happened, and within 2 years divorced.  

Both dudes lost the homes they bought either outright or had to sell to split the proceeds.  Both women did a 180 once everything was in place and did everything possible to push a divorce.  Drugs, stealing cash, abusing children up to but not crossing the point where authorites would need to get called.  Both guys had to throw a bunch of cash at the soon to be ex to get rid of them.

There are people out there that prey on recently widowed, emotional, lonely people to get to their money.  Both dudes I know lost over $100k in their divorces.  Both dudes got scammed.  Both dudes took a long time to recover.  Be careful out there if you are in a position like this.  Reach out and  keep an eye on people you know who are in these positions."
