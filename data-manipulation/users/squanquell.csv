aww,fevqdlh,t3_eqq87u,1579400236.0,She looks like an Evelyn  to me
AmItheAsshole,felc1kk,t3_eprvua,1579218652.0,"NTA, why can't she go after you pick up or before you guys drop the kid off? You aren't paying her to her to go to the gym. You are paying her to watch your kid."
AmItheAsshole,fe890h2,t3_eo4dr9,1578923888.0,"NTA, if you don't feel comfortable then don't go. She really shouldn't be treating your brother that way and if she does have a problem she should come out and say so"
AmItheAsshole,fe4gceb,t3_ensdw4,1578859042.0,"NTA, that type of narrative shouldn't be pushed in schools to begin with."
AmItheAsshole,fe43s23,t1_fe2f3g2,1578855535.0,"Yeah, but that's a different situation than moving into an upscale neighborhood and then being a trash neighbor."
AmItheAsshole,fe09klb,t3_enijci,1578806920.0,"Not an asshole, but slow down. Guy isn't interested, no reason to be upset. Just take it for what it is and keep on keeping on."
AmItheAsshole,fe03ueh,t3_enik0u,1578802397.0,"NTA, if the man is that frail and confused he really should not be driving to begin with, he could seriously hurt someone. And he hit you, he should be covering the repairs. It sucks but you need to look out for you not him."
AskParents,fdzodbk,t3_en9rs8,1578792426.0,"Well hopefully this will be the last time. That is very odd that they make you pay, its usually the parent with the higher income that pays for everything in these situations. But you can also request a different judge of you take it to court first. And given his behaviour i would request that he and the girlfriend get drug tested as well."
