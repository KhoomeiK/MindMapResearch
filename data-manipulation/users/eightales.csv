Skincare_Addiction,ffdehw3,t1_ff8sgx0,1579819183.0,"It cant just be things like plants, fruit and oil.. I highly doubt it.
Could you link me to the ingredient list?
Also some people with severely bad skin need certain chemicals and acids to reduce dark spots, typical acne and cystic acne, etc that other ingredients can't do alone. Chemicals =/= bad"
Skincare_Addiction,ff8oxdp,t3_es9pd8,1579689590.0,"Don't use scrubs! They are abrasive to the skin :) probs gonna edit my comment in the morning with more advice since I'm sbout to fall asleep and can barely type. But I just wanted to warn you

Edit: Sorry I took so long !

Okay, so I don't think this is really acne scarring. This just appears to be dark spots (which usually happens after a pimple goes away) with only a tiny bit of scarring which looks like a literal scar (towards the top of the photo) more than an acne scar, but I commence

The way to distinguish the two is by this definition;

""Treating dark spots from acne is different than treating acne scars. Scars require tissue to be damaged or overgrown. Scars are difficult to fully remove, and while they may fade over time, they usually remain visible. Dark spots from acne, on the other hand, are flat against the surface of your skin.""

So, in order to treat the dark spots you need to look for products designed for dark spots. I recommend any product from Paula's Choice skincare line, as the line uses no irritating ingredients such as fragrance which can cause long-term skin damage.

This product in particular is technically not designed specifically for dark spots but can help smooth out the skin and brighten it, which will help reduce their appearance and also help reduce the appearance of any acne scars.

[https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/niacinamide-and-azelaic-acid-duo/011-bundle.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/niacinamide-and-azelaic-acid-duo/011-bundle.html)

This product contains salicylic acid- which, like you mentioned- can help reduce acne scars

""Salicylic acid clears pores, reduces swelling and redness, and exfoliates the skin when applied topically. It's considered to be one of the best treatments for acne scars.""

This product in particular is also good for dark spots, as recommended by Paula's Choice.

I noticed your skin also has bumps, well good for you Paula's Choice has products for that too lol

[https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/bha-9-treatment/773.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/bha-9-treatment/773.html)

This product isn't only good for bumpy skin, but it also contains salicylic acid so you'll be helping your skin in other regards as well!

And since you still need a moisturizer (an essential step in your skincare routine!), I recommend looking on the Paula's Choice website and finding a moisturizer designed for your skin type (dry, oily, combination, sensitive, normal).

Can I ask what cleanser you're using? :) Also I couldn't tell if you just meant you were only using the cleanser on the nose or if you were only referring to the scrub with that? If so, use it on your entire face when your face is wet (**not** dry) and lather it up in your hands and apply to your face evenly and rub it in, and then rinse really good (don't use hot water, use cold - lukewarm.)

Oh and be sure to use a sunscreen daily to help avoid the dark spots getting any darker or damaging your skin and making those scars any worse ! nothing below spf 20 in my opinion, if you really want to help your skin as much as possible.

Make sure that whenever you buy a product you check the ingredient list for things such as

* Fragrance (sometimes called 'parfum' on the ingredient list)
* Essential oils (some argue about this, but nothing really proves that they have any benefits and in order to not irritate the skin they need to be 0.01% of a product and most companies don't use this little or even show a percentage)
* Things like lemon extract, lavender extract, etc. Just.. don't. If you see a product with something that ends 'extract' google it very well first (multiple sources) to see if its bad for you or not. Some extracts are good, but alot of them aren't and are in the product to smell good.
* In general, avoid products that smell very sweet, like fruit, flowers, etc. They should smell pretty neutral- if they do smell good they're probably using something that will irritate your skin.

I know that was *alottt* of information to take in, but skincare can be hard.. but I promise that once you learn what to avoid and what brands are good and what ingredients are bad, you'll find it really easy to find good products that work for your skin; short term *and* long term.

By the way, in every link I provided you can scroll down and find a little section that gives you more info about it, like why it works and when to use it in your skin-care routine, hope that helps!

man, paulas choice should totally hire me lmao. enjoy ur skincare <3"
Skincare_Addiction,ff8nl6y,t3_es6he7,1579687568.0,"I'm really this is good for you! but to be honest, there's no such thing as 'all natural' skin care products, if its gonna work its gonna have lab ingredients. but not hating:)"
Skincare_Addiction,ff4wa2j,t3_ergr2j,1579573971.0,"Take what I say lightly because I'm not a professional- but my best guess is that specific area of skin has a damaged skin barrier, but considering its been months it could either be another issue or its \*really\* damaged.

Paula's Choice has a lot of good products, and they actually have a moisturizer meant for aiding skin barrier repair. But I can't seem to find what skin type its meant for (I'm guessing its an 'all skin types' product but it never specifies this.)

[https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/resist-barrier-repair-moisturizer-with-retinol/761.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com.au/resist-barrier-repair-moisturizer-with-retinol/761.html)

The current products you are using could also be irritating your already damaged skin- if you are using **any** products with alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and dyes, don't use them as they are bad for your skin in the long term and can cause irritation, even more so if your skin is already sensitive.

Before you try any new products, like the one I recommended, visit a dermatologist in case serious damage has been done to your skin- a dermatologist can find the best skincare products for you and help you on recovering your skin."
