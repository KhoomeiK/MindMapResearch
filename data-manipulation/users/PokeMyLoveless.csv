I am currently re-reading an amazing trilogy so they are my first three books, then the rest of the year will be no re-reads. I want to get through all of my books on the shelf that need a first read!

I also play video games, mainly Pokemon, and me and the boyf are wanting to get back into disc golf on top of our weekly football sessions.

For me it holds a Christmas vibe due to when I first played 2 and 3. I came home from uni for Christmas and my mind bf had bought her Fable 2 for her to play on his xBox. It was his way of trying to get her off his back about playing it all the time. He figures if she played it sometimes too he was off the hook. Well he got her addicted to the Fable series so he actually lost a lot of game time for ages haha.
But anyway.
Every year now for at least 8 years I've played them through in December. I'm playing 2 again at the moment. My friends and family all know it's Fable time and ask if I'm playing them haha. Darn, I love those games."
