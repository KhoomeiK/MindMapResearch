This is *why* car drivers are legally liable. Car are dangerous. Pedestrians are not, and bikes much less so.

That being said, cyclist should still carry light at night. Even without cars, not doing so would be dangerous. Pedestrians can do whatever they prefer - they are only _in_ danger, they endanger no one."

Assistance,fddfb9c,t3_ekosm5,1578309688.0,"Pardon me for missing this bit of UK culture here, but what does 'pay for a small food shop' entail? Is that transferring you some money so that you can buy groceries?

Is there any way I can buy you something / cover a bill for you, rather than straight up sending you money?"
depression,fdc6vxv,t3_ekd9mp,1578268276.0,"Yeah I know. Hugs matter.

Where do you live? I'd happily simply give you a heartfelt hug, and chat about our day."
therapy,fdc5bmp,t3_ekhdkc,1578267397.0,"Ah well. I was a university student for 9 years. Got my bachelor's (3 years nominally) after 7 years. The plan was to get a master's, but I never got one.

I did have a GF, but after years of me feeling like a failure and feeling miserable yet doing nothing to change it, she couldn't take it anymore and left. I had already lost all of my friends at that point, so I was pretty much alone. Didn't know what I wanted out of life, had no plan.

It's not _about_ being a failure or not. There will always be standards that you don't meet. The point is find someplace where you _do_ meet the standards, and where _you_ want to be.

So what *do* you want to do? Do you _want_ to continue studying? If so, go for it. If not, find something else - there are other options. Do you _want_ to get a girlfriend? If so, start going to places where you could meet one. If not, that's cool too."
relationships,fczmlg2,t1_fczbk9o,1578104520.0,"To be honest, I really don't know _what_ I would be hiding. I am not cheating, there is nothing in my past that I don't want her to know about, I am not entertaining any relationships that I don't want her to know the essence of.

If something's important to either of us, I talk to her about it. What more would need to be shared?



> Otherwise, you wouldn't care.

No, I don't accept this. This is the ""if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear"" argument. Which assumes that anything that's worth hiding, is something that you shouldn't be doing in the first place. Which is a false assumption - there are plenty of things that _are_ perfectly fine, but that can easily be _seen_ as something bad. Not having privacy means that for every little thing, you need to think about how this _could be_ interpreted by anyone that has access to it. Which is one hell of a burden and has a severely limiting effect.

Pulling this back down to the personal level of me and my GF - there have been several occasions where we really did not understand each other, so no, I don't believe that she will automatically interpret any little bit of information correctly. To protect against such misunderstandings, I need to be present and able to clarify things when she learns new info."
relationships,fczhdl3,t1_fczdg89,1578101290.0,"Yes, she is insecure in the relationship. Partly because of experiences with her exes, partly because we have an as of yet unresolved conflict on a dealbreaker subject."
relationships,fczebar,t1_fcz8wi6,1578099260.0,"No, why?

I feel like I am missing some reference here."
relationships,fcyy4b6,t1_fcywvsa,1578089645.0,Oh wow. I think you hit the bullseye there.
relationships,fcyuk4k,t1_fcysl5k,1578087392.0,"Quite possibly.

How does that work then, psychologically? What do the mental steps look like that lead from ""I don't trust you"" to ""you don't trust me""?"
relationships,fcytr6n,t1_fcysjvl,1578086896.0,"Thank you, I had not looked at the matter this way! This seems reasonable and constructive.

I do certainly feel like I'm digging my heels in whenever we go through this cycle. I flat out reject the validity of her argument and don't really understand where she's coming from. I mean, I did _ask_ ""why"", but I never really _understood_ why.

I have unlocked it and given it to her on several occasions. I was fine with that; the conflict was clearly about something else. Such as what you describe above."
depression,fcvrju0,t3_ej1l29,1578008488.0,"I read all of your post.

How's that for not listening?

> Beneath that facade is a shitty and fucked up person that you want nothing to do with.

I am unconvinced. What's the worst that you've done, _really_?"
depression,fc4wu1x,t3_eg1ib1,1577431760.0,"Yep.

But hiding it does not help the friendship either, since it means I cannot be sincere to them."
therapy,fc2vwhr,t3_efq0jf,1577375450.0,"Sorry to hear that you're going through this, OP.

You sound like a kind enough person.

Please do share this burden with someone, even if just an anonymous stranger - this is not something to be dealing with alone. Plenty of people actually _like_ being there for others."
