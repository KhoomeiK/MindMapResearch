When I'm home I tend to run the same routes and focus on training for a goal or a race.   I enjoy that aspect of running and, frankly, I need that aspect too.   

On the other hand some of my most pleasurable runs are when I'm visiting a new place.  Running along the river in New Orleans, around and across the bridges of Portland, OR, over the old suspension bridge in Cincinnati, through Central Park in NYC, or around the national mall in DC.   No time or distance goals, just running and enjoying the sights.  It is meditative.

Good job on doing what seems an honest assessment of yourself.  You’d be surprised how many people are incapable of doing that.

You appear to have some interesting hobbies and tastes  so i wouldn’t say you are uninteresting.   

I would still recommend practicing social skills without the pressure of dating or trying to date.  Even community colleges have groups clubs etc.   outside of college most towns have similar.   Find one that interests you (music).

Finally you are only 17, I know that doesn’t mean much when you see others dating but The world of socializing and dating changes dramatically by 20.   

The most troubling thing you said was the lack of goals.  I would think you need to focus on that way ahead of a girlfriend, in fact it’s probably a prerequisite.  The questions I asked are what any person interested in you will ask and you need to sort yourself out."

How about answering my questions though?

Oh, happy cake day!"
IncelTears,fdixkvg,t1_fdiqmor,1578453334.0,"Sigh. 

One last try...

What’s interesting about you?  
How many female friends do you have?  Why do your female friends hang with you?  No female friends?  Why not?

If you walk into a room or bar what about you makes people want to talk to you and remember you?

If you don’t focus on yourself first , trying harder or less hard won’t matter.  if someone goes out with you, what hobbies or goals will light up your eyes and excite you when you talk about them?  

Reread my post slowly and do it, or just continue on your same path and blame women for your problems."
IncelTears,fdhzyq8,t1_fdhjm5h,1578433251.0,"This is probably a waste of time but some ideas for you.

First off, Forget dating or attracting a girl for say the next 6 months.   Literally, don’t even think about trying.

Do you have male friends?  If not, work on developing your social skills to build friendships.  Those are the same skills you need to attract women.   They aren’t a different species.   

Secondly, develop some outside interests you find fulfilling (not because you think you’ll meet women).  Train for a marathon, learn photography, write, whatever but do it because you want to.   Find something besides finding a girlfriend to be passionate about.   I’ll tell you folks that are passionate about something are interesting but only if it’s genuine.  That makes you interesting.

Third,  get involved outside the house and work.  NOT to meet women but because you are a social animal and want to.   Join a Couch to 5K group, a yoga class, etc.  Don’t eye or ask out women from the group, just enjoy the activity.  Be real.

If you are passionate about something, have outside interests, develop social skills enough to make friends, and aren’t coming off as desperate or focused on sex, you might be surprised how many people will want to be around you.   Women are not some different species that you need some magical words or actions to unlock.  

You see average to unattractive guys with girlfriends all the time.   They are genuine and not desperate so you need to focus on your life and interests not doing something that you think will be designed to “get a girl”

Lastly, drop the porn and incel echo chamber it’s not real world.  Most Women don’t cheat.    Some do, some men cheat.  So what? Forget about it.   

Change your outlook from external validation (get a girl) to internal goals (run a marathon, start a photographic instagram, join an ultimate frisbee team)."

I read a number of plans and sort of merged them into something that would fit my schedule, extra rest time for being older, but still put in the miles as much as possible during the week.  Weekend long runs though are sacred and rain or shine, I always got those in.
