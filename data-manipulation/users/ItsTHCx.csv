bigboye,ffirqej,t1_ffio7a5,1579981054.0,First thing I thought when I saw it. Looks like a weird computer animation but starts to look more realistic the longer you watch it.
The_Mueller,ffaaykj,t1_ffa4mrm,1579731344.0,"> Kentuckians are uniquely politically retarded.

That's cute if you think that's exclusive to one state. Almost everyone in this country is politically retarded. That's why we are in the mess that we are in now."
NintendoSwitch,ffaagsu,t3_escb7d,1579731058.0,At the end of the day you're an idiot if you preorder a game before its even out yet so anything after that is irrelevant. You shouldn't be looking for a refund for a preorder because you never should have preordered in the first place.
AdviceAnimals,ff8oer5,t1_ff8o2tq,1579688816.0,Nobody who checks credit scores gives a fuck about medical bills. If they did nobody would ever qualify for anything.
mousehunt,ff8nxn5,t3_es91gw,1579688100.0,Max all upgrades before you get the trap and base. They don't really do much compared to the upgrades.
todayilearned,ff7n5g4,t1_ff7jeyh,1579653537.0,"They don't give a fuck if the right person goes to jail, as long as someone goes to jail. Most if not all prosecutors are real pieces of shit."
todayilearned,ff7muis,t1_ff7ctlv,1579653328.0,Police force people into false confessions all the time. Whether it's just because they're too lazy to do their job who knows.
AskReddit,ff6k1ga,t1_ff6e3f4,1579628859.0,Being a woman is more important than anything else. They don't give a fuck about drug addiction or any of that stupid shit. Mothers get custody automatically just because they are a mother. Society has always and will always favor women by default. That's just the way the world works.

tifu,fesqlqg,t3_eqf0gs,1579367991.0,Makes sense. Literally the only thing you should be searching on Bing is porn. Bing is strictly a porn finder.
LifeProTips,fem8030,t1_fellffi,1579243069.0,That's really cute that you think millennials will get to retire at all.
blackpeoplegifs,fefjfus,t1_fefcgcd,1579057595.0,"So ""oh man shes hot I want to get in her pants fuck yeaa!"" gets all the upvotes but saying ""Eh she's not really my type"" is suddenly cringy and bad and gets all the downvotes. Reddit is weird."
LateStageCapitalism,fefgl7e,t1_fedz3s0,1579055884.0,They tried this 20 hour a week thing in illinois as well and it didnt work at all. They would hold a location where you could go and do job search and get your 20 hours recorded but mostly everyone would just sit around and sleep and fuck off until it was time to leave again. Felt more like high school detention rather than getting anything done. They eventually canceled it i assume because the extra costs involved didn't change anything.
oddlysatisfying,feey7um,t3_eor8dh,1579043824.0,Looks gross and makes me itchy.

povertyfinance,feb4qod,t1_feb14x0,1578955383.0,"Same thing goes for price increases. Prices go up every year anyways, that has nothing to do with minimum wage either. People just like finding excuses for being an asshole."

secondlife,fe68jpx,t3_endu0d,1578884133.0,"The major difference is that SecondLife allows actual adult content. Drugs, sex, the works. IMVU's ""adult content"" is more PG-13, you can get stuff but its black market and not allowed so it's more of a pain in the ass."
mousehunt,fdnx6ab,t3_elst91,1578594656.0,"Started with 23 million. Ended with a rib and 90 million. Bought the rib for 154 million so I made somewhere in the range of 220 million gold from GWH and I have 1,200 dragonvine."
tifu,fdhm68k,t1_fdhjspo,1578425591.0,"That's an insane threshold. If you're making $4,100 a month and you can't afford food you got some serious issues my friend."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdhjv8o,t1_fdhd7yl,1578424191.0,In a relatively cheap area rent is $600-$700 a month. Electric is $100. Water is $50. Gas is $20-$100. Say $30 a month for a phone. $200 a month for food. Absolutely bare minimum a working adult should be making $1100 a month and that's struggling to survive. That's bare minimum $10 an hour. There is no reason for minimum wage to be less than $10 an hour anywhere. In places with higher cost of living this should be much higher than $10.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdhishx,t1_fdh3rs5,1578423533.0,"No wonder you're at the bottom of the comments. ""Only 14 year olds work fast food and teenagers don't need a livable wage"" is not only false but shows that you know absolutely nothing about what you're talking about. The average age of a fast food worker is almost 30. Where I live the majority of fast food employees are 30+ years old and I've personally known several who are over 50."
todayilearned,fdf0plo,t3_ekxqiy,1578350681.0,"That $5,000 is equivalent to about $77,000 in today's money."
AmItheAsshole,fddzac3,t3_eksd4l,1578327586.0,"NTA. You're willing to take on $5,000 in debt and a shitty credit score for a scumbag of a mother, you're insane. Absolutely take her to court for identity theft. In my state that would be a felony with a mandatory minimum of 3 years in prison and a maximum possible sentence of 7 years."
AmItheAsshole,fdcq15s,t3_ekicbi,1578281165.0,"NTA. They need to learn sooner or later how shitty life is going to be. Very little of anything in this life is going to be good or fair, get used to it kid, there's a lot more where that came from."

mousehunt,fdcmnlf,t1_fd6mf6y,1578278698.0,But the point is everyone in the comments says they are still not done ***now***. Now after GWH has been out for the last 3 years. LNY has been out for many years. Everything you talked about has been out for a long time and apparently almost nobody is done yet. That was my point. It's weird to me. I only started 1 year ago and I'm already done with the content. How you can play for 10 years and in 2020 still not be finished I have no idea.
TwoXChromosomes,fdcevf6,t3_ekectz,1578273188.0,"""*Its your own fault you got raped.*"" What? Your family sounds like some real scumbag pieces of shit."

mousehunt,fd4qsm9,t3_ejvjfk,1578170135.0,It's weird to me that all of these people in the comments claim to be playing for 10 years and not done yet. I started August 2018 and I'm just about finished with all available content. Granted I'm easily on the more hardcore end of the playerbase but even as a 18h/7d a week player it still took me more than a year to finish.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcukr4p,t1_fcuhotx,1577983188.0,"Bound weapons are so disgustingly overpowered in general. They're nearly the strongest item you can get in the game, you can get them at level 1 and bound bow comes with infinite arrows. On top of that they automatically fill soul gems and you cannot be disarmed with a bound weapon. That's just off the top of my head. Super busted."
