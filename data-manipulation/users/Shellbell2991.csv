PlasticSurgery,ffe2d7g,t1_ff9lyag,1579834894.0,Thanks! I downloaded the app after reading your comment. I’ve already found a few surgeons in the area that I’m planning on calling tomorrow. :)
PublicFreakout,ffdu4fz,t3_et2fbi,1579828978.0,I shouldn’t have turned the volume on right after my kitty got comfy on my lap :(
PlasticSurgery,ff9ftop,t1_felt1u9,1579712101.0,"It’s so crazy because I feel like most clothes are made for people with larger breasts (larger breasts than me anyways) Lol. 
I’m a small a cup and have the hardest time finding shirts that fit me. XS tank tops are a bit saggy on me. And when I wear a sweatshirt I just look like a flat board. I haven’t worn a swimsuit in two years because I can’t find one that fits me in a flattering way. It’s awful. I’m in the process of finding a surgeon for breast augmentation."

nextfuckinglevel,fedsobp,t3_eojmso,1579019054.0,"I just read the NYTimes article on this story. I don’t know how he did it after hearing his poor dog. I would’ve been too emotionally wrecked. But, I guess survival mode kicks in and you can handle a lot more than what you might imagine.
