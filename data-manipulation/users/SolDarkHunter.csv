He's fighting for ZAFT not because he thinks they're good, but because he thinks they're the *least evil*... and also possibly just because it's his homeland.

I think people sometimes forget that Guts is no moral hero. Human life doesn't mean much to him, unless it's someone he knows personally. He doesn't actively try to find humans to kill (specifying humans there because he *has* actively hunted down Apostles), but on the other hand he makes no real effort to avoid it either.

For Guts, killing is a fact of life. I doubt he feels any remorse for 90% of the lives he's taken. That's not really an attack on his character, that's just the life he's lived. He literally grew up in a mercenary band, surrounded by war and death.

But, there are certain people he wishes he didn't kill, I think.

And no, he is not the same as an Apostle. He may not feel bad about killing people, but as far as humans go, he has only killed in war or in self-defense. 

Apostles actively seek out to kill innocents for fun... and let's not forget the whole ""sacrificing your loved ones to become a demon"" thing. Whatever else he has done, Guts would never do that to the people he cares about."

anime,fd4bger,t1_fd3hsbm,1578166086.0,"> ìIshtar, the goddess of bountiful harvest, can be seen as the Great Earth Mother, symbolizing human life. On the other hand, Ereshkigal symbolizes human death, and is the terrible Earth Mother.î
> 
> ìDoes that mean the two goddesses are two sides of the same coin, and perhaps born from the same deity?î
> 
> This idea is common in modern analysis of Inanna's descent to the netherworld, so I don't blame the anime. However, such conclusions tend to overlook the fact that the Descent is not a lone myth, but part of a cycle of Inanna/Ishtar invading the realms of other gods or stealing from them; that family trees in Mesopotamian religion vary from place to place (Inanna herself has like five different fathers depending on which myth you read); that there were other figures in Mesopotamian mythology that fit the ""mother goddess"" trope much better, like Ninhursag; and that Ereshkigal and Inanna/Ishtar didn't have any meaningful interaction in the myths beyond that tale.

This all ties into some deeper exploration of the Nasuverse's interpretation of gods. 

Basically, in the Nasuverse, the original gods were essentially concepts personified, but as time went on they became more and more affected by human thought and imagination (there is an explanation as to why, but it's too long to detail here). In the Nasuverse, Ishtar and Ereshkigal *were* originally one deity, but when human myths began to depict them as separate entities, that deity split off into the two.

Generally speaking, newer mythologies tend to take precendence over older ones, as the gods themselves are retroactively altered to fit the newer ones, which is probably why Akkadian myth is receiving the focus here over the original Sumerian myth.

The deal with the Earth Mother Goddess is similar: the original Earth Mother was a primordial deity who has been forgotten (identified in... Fate/Extra CCC I think... as the supreme goddess of Catalhoyuk, whose name is not remembered). But as the gods become less stable and more influenced by humans, that goddess's Authority and powers were continually divided into the various Earth Mother Goddesses of all human religions. They're all tied to the same origin, even if now they're separate."

But, there are certain people he wishes he didn't kill, I think.

And no, he is not the same as an Apostle. He may not feel bad about killing people, but as far as humans go, he has only killed in war or in self-defense.

Games,fddvnxh,t1_fddm2vn,1578325109.0,"Mask of Deception is a sequel to the original, but yes it is non-ero.

Frankly I found a lot of the humor in Mask of Deception to fall flat... it relies too heavily on humiliating the MC for my tastes, and especially with those tired old ""unintentional pervert"" gags.

*But*, Mask of Truth makes up for that immensely, with an actually compelling story and good character development. It also ties in to the first game's story directly.

Mask of Deception on its own is a pretty mediocre and bland piece of writing, but that's mostly because its purpose is to set things up for Mask of Truth, which is where the actual story is."

anime,fd4bger,t1_fd3hsbm,1578166086.0,"> ‚ÄúIshtar, the goddess of bountiful harvest, can be seen as the Great Earth Mother, symbolizing human life. On the other hand, Ereshkigal symbolizes human death, and is the terrible Earth Mother.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúDoes that mean the two goddesses are two sides of the same coin, and perhaps born from the same deity?‚Äù
> 
> This idea is common in modern analysis of Inanna's descent to the netherworld, so I don't blame the anime. However, such conclusions tend to overlook the fact that the Descent is not a lone myth, but part of a cycle of Inanna/Ishtar invading the realms of other gods or stealing from them; that family trees in Mesopotamian religion vary from place to place (Inanna herself has like five different fathers depending on which myth you read); that there were other figures in Mesopotamian mythology that fit the ""mother goddess"" trope much better, like Ninhursag; and that Ereshkigal and Inanna/Ishtar didn't have any meaningful interaction in the myths beyond that tale.

This all ties into some deeper exploration of the Nasuverse's interpretation of gods. 

Basically, in the Nasuverse, the original gods were essentially concepts personified, but as time went on they became more and more affected by human thought and imagination (there is an explanation as to why, but it's too long to detail here). In the Nasuverse, Ishtar and Ereshkigal *were* originally one deity, but when human myths began to depict them as separate entities, that deity split off into the two.

Generally speaking, newer mythologies tend to take precendence over older ones, as the gods themselves are retroactively altered to fit the newer ones, which is probably why Akkadian myth is receiving the focus here over the original Sumerian myth.

The deal with the Earth Mother Goddess is similar: the original Earth Mother was a primordial deity who has been forgotten (identified in... Fate/Extra CCC I think... as the supreme goddess of Catalhoyuk, whose name is not remembered). But as the gods become less stable and more influenced by humans, that goddess's Authority and powers were continually divided into the various Earth Mother Goddesses of all human religions. They're all tied to the same origin, even if now they're separate."

Sakamoto was pretty open that his intention was to attract *Japanese* fans to the franchise. While Metroid is a Japanese title, historically most of its fans have been Americans.

In any case, it didn't work. Other M did not sell any better than Metroid titles usually do in Japan, and those Japanese fans Metroid does have had similar negative opinions about it as everyone else."

Metroid has always stood out as one of the very, very few classic games with a female protagonist who is every bit as badass as all the rest (and not a male love interest in sight). Fans of Metroid love Samus for that... and the sheer *hatred* for what Other M did to her character was damn near universal from what I saw.

No one I spoke to thought her characterization there was a good thing. So I'm confused when she says the majority of gamers lambasted the review. I have no doubt that some did, because people are stupid, but I always thought that reaction was more niche."
