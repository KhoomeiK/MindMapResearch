AmItheAsshole,fes5ta4,t3_eq4yny,1579361731.0,The limited details make it too difficult to form an opinion. Your story is a little too vague.

netflix,ferw7dr,t3_eqg4u2,1579358997.0,That first car chase was sooooo long. After 10 minutes I realized there was no real point to the pointlessly long car chase. It took me 25 minutes to get through the movie bc I kept fast forwarding. I don't think I missed much.
AmItheAsshole,fert0cr,t3_eq1wll,1579358055.0,"NTA. You followed your instincts that your friend didn't know and you were right, she was shocked and broke up with him. You probably saved her life. It's surprising how many ppl on this sub would supposedly take the moral high ground. I don't believe it. If I find out one of my friends is dating someone with HIV, I'm telling them (although maybe I would do it anonymously if I wanted to keep my job)."
JUSTNOMIL,fepp6sq,t3_eq88ii,1579326716.0,Is there a place to get a list of the abreviations used in the stories for this sub?

boxoffice,fed0kjd,t3_eo41xg,1578992639.0,"Ford v Ferrari for best picture? It was ok, not even close to great.  And the scene where Matt Damon and Christian Bale have a fight on the corner was so stupid."
raisedbynarcissists,fed09l3,t1_fecyhfd,1578992219.0,Any chance you can go NC? For your own sanity and peace of mind.
unitedkingdom,fe6drlt,t1_fe59786,1578887936.0,I'm genuinely trying to figure out why the royal family would care if Harry and Megan stepped away and I can't find answer on Google. Someone please explain.
aww,fdwy5ir,t1_fdvuynx,1578763420.0,Thank you. Longer hug.

DowntonAbbey,fdih4sg,t1_fddermr,1578442792.0,"I agreed with everything you wrote except I liked Anna. I didn't like Daisy. She was so annoying. So ungrateful to people that tried to help her (including the likable Mr. Mosley and her lovable father-in-law). She was an awful friend, immature and oblivious to people's feelings."

I thought it was an interesting movie but he was so annoying that at the end I thought, ""oh well, he'll finally STFU."" I didn't feel bad. I think if he was likable then I would have loved the movie bc we root for characters we like."

I found an article about it. Sad. He got drunk on the flight home from a stint in rehab. Addiction is such a difficult decease to overcome."
