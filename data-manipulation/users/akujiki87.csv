They are currently doing Bronchoscopies to go in and clean out the gunk in his lungs. They also want to go in and get a good scan of his heart to check if any of the infection made it there as his rate was pretty elevated but last night it has come down and gone into normal range. Signs are taking a turn for the better so I am confident he will pull through. Just going to be a long annoying trip through it.

aww,fenml4n,t3_eq1boi,1579287909.0,"To ANYONE who sees this and says damn, I need one of these. Please read the following.

Unless you have a lot of free time at night, DO NOT get them. They are nocturnal and need interaction at night.

You CANNOT just get one. They need to be in pairs minimum. They are a community animal, they need buddies or they can self mutilate.

You WILL get bit. And it hurts. So expect it.

They are noisy and can sound like a pissed off lawnmower when you irritate them.

The can SMELL bad depending on the diet plan. The diet also takes more work than other pets. They cant just eat pellets and occasional treats. You need to research the diet plans then choose what you feel works best. I personally went with a blended mixture you can keep in the freezer with a mix of fresh items and meal worms. It did make a smellier diet but I felt it was closer to what they would get in the wild.(They are omnivores.)

You MUST take the time to bond with them. Keep a pouch on you(they sleep in pouches and hanging house type deals prom pet stores) with them in it so they can get used to you. It takes time.

Their nails are SHARP, so you need to keep on top of that as well be it trim by hand or a running wheel(they LOVE wheels) that has an abrasive in it to trim the nails.

Also illegal in California and potentially other states(only matters if you are in US).

That being said if you have the time and dedication they can make great little buddies. I had 4 of them but had to rehome them as I switched from a night schedule to days at work and it was not fair to them. They were adopted by a retired man who had nothing but time for them. 

A good alternative if you want something different or ""exotic"", a Chinchilla! Need a larger cage obviously, but there's not near as much work involved, though still more so than say a gerbil. Dont need to be kept in pairs and are awesome buddies when bonded."

PaymoneyWubby,fen2ln6,t1_fen047m,1579275580.0,"My comment you originally replied to was me showing its not black and white, it was not a serious wuedtion but me pointing out the flaw in the logic. There are reasons one could say they wont date trans without being transphobic. To which you yourself agreed. I then misunderstood part of what you said, which lead to my second comment. Still my only point was to show its not black and white, while adding no one should be labeling anyone at all. Its pointless and stupid. I even stated im probably ranting and not making sense at that time. 

Again I am not one of the people who needs to be convinced of anything. Im open to all people. My two comments in this thread prior to you interacting with me were the same point. Its not transphobic for every reason, as well as its not fair if someone lied about it and down the road when they cant have kids it would blow up in everyones face. I will add if i was in that situation, and found out after being years invested in a relationship with someone and them knowing my future plans for a family then bam sorry not possible, id be pretty pissed.  Now wubbys video made it kinda seem that the fiance was unaware, how true that is i dont know, i dont know anything about the youtuber he is focusing on so couldnt really confirm thst claim. But its a valid concern imo. 

But i do also think the term Transphobic, as well as homophobic and even racist get tossed around too easily. Hell ive been called racist just for mentioning one of my coworkers is mexican when telling a story. Like he literally lives in mexico, comes across to work for our company, but i guess im racist? Its weird.

And i can say im not literally a kid on a playground. Im literally a 32 year old fat guy laying in bed in my underwear dreading getting ready for work. But thats irrelevant.

Thats what I did for angels of vengeance until I decided I prefer painting green over black. Theres no perks like BA have for running FT or what not. Its just what goes on your paper haha.
theunforgiven,fehrgws,t1_fehqwi3,1579122410.0,Kinda like a Talonmaster or Sammael in Sableclaw? Either way someone else explained the reason is theres only one Master in RW which would fall on Sammael.
Games,fehqtb3,t1_feh5f12,1579122034.0,"> The fighting looks pretty good, but as a 20+ year DBZ gamer, I don't know how many fucking times I can replay the same exact story.

20+ years and trucking obviously."
theunforgiven,fehp2b5,t1_fehmjmw,1579121026.0,"Which really wouldnt effect DA as far as I am aware. Unless I missed something major we dont get any different perks or rule change for our sub chapters like say BA with Flesh Tearers. So unless someone has a hard on to make sure their list says <Angels of Vengeance> just run them AS DA, only difference at this point is the paint job for our subs."
theunforgiven,fehihf1,t1_fehhtug,1579117218.0,"> I honestly prefer this to a “must take” Primaris names character that didn’t function for successors

Not sure I understand, why wouldnt they function for successors?"

Debatable now. As far as I am aware in the current canon we dont know if he is dead or alive, just that someone else is rocking his armor. He also wasnt too bad ass until other media worked on him. He mostly just stood around, and well, had his first appearance on the Holiday special."
theunforgiven,fehd2wb,t1_fehcxx3,1579114066.0,Sounds great then! Thanks!
theunforgiven,fehc2zn,t1_fehbu57,1579113488.0,"Ah, did not know this. Makes much more sense now! Thanks!"
theunforgiven,feha5qh,t1_feh88qf,1579112339.0,"> Yeah but to help you have to be rocking a castle already, and be 6"" away from Lazarus. Sure if you find your playing alot TS or GK he could help, or vs morty or magnus perhaps, but youd have to then get said castle in or near CC for his sword to work, which you dont want to be anyways. You end up vs any of the other factions and hes a waste of points. Plus it's a 5+++, so there is still a very real chance that MW is happening regardless lol...

Oh I totally agree, I just see they did it for a narrative stand point. He's not too great and def wont replace any of my HQ choices. IMO Ezekiel would have been a more logical choice. Especially with him being a old defined character it would have worked better with the whole DA opening up to Primaris thing they are goin with Laz.

>Haha yeah, in CAD all the new primaris characters are the same price. 

That's rough."
theunforgiven,feh75eo,t3_ep44lv,1579110551.0,"I know its prob too much to hope for, but I think the option for a Master on Bike would have been a perfect addition to this."
theunforgiven,feh6w7o,t3_ep48gu,1579110399.0,"So, does this work within the already established Dev doctrine SM get? Sorry I havnt really looked at any of the new marine rules and what not, just been brooding over my sad DA haha."
