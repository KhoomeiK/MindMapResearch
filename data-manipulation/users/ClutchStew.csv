halo,fffv2gs,t3_etek51,1579892426.0,"I like Halo 2 because Bungie did an awesome job creating a sequel in the wake of CE. Plus it was the first Halo game available on Xbox Live. I remember the hype when this game was announced and released. At first I was not a fan of the dual weapon feature and the toned down pistol/frag grenades, but overall it was a huge improvement over the original. There were also 15 campaign missions. Just a great sophomore game."
