MensLib,fggi61k,t3_ey9p97,1580762371.0,My wife's last name is awesome. I would have taken it but she and her dad both didn't like the idea of me doing that.
AmItheAsshole,fg34n82,t1_ffzt527,1580470126.0,Sorry I think I didn't phrase that right.  I mean OP does that often so I doubt the video game purchase is the actual reason for the problem here.
AmItheAsshole,ffzqy16,t1_ffz5840,1580390308.0,"There's more of a problem than just that going on, clearly.  Key point is that as OP mentioned, she tends to splurge on games which means this probably happens often."

AmItheAsshole,ffsa2br,t3_euqnid,1580176810.0,Sounds like you did him a favor.  He can live without you now!

MensLib,ffq75bl,t3_eukv3a,1580124071.0,It's probably not that they resent you for it.  It's probably that their bully then had new fuel for their harassment.  Male on male bullying is like that.  Male bullies often have views of males needing to be tough and independent (hence why they are the way they are) and having a girl step in was something for them to chime in on.
AmItheAsshole,ffq6xbj,t1_ffnengk,1580123752.0,Well she's gonna learn what adult resentment looks like and that lasts for life.  I'd imagine every holiday and a lot of weekends he's going to come by and hate her guts.  Something for her to think about maybe.
AmItheAsshole,ffq6h8g,t1_ffq6eo2,1580123089.0,"Also while getting the cats fixed may make her feel better, these colonies are cesspools of FIV and FeLV.  Get your cat tested."
AmItheAsshole,ffq6eo2,t3_eub2pi,1580122981.0,"NTA.  Do it.  Domestic cats are an invasive species and people who insist on keeping ""cat colonies"" are hoarders who keep their mess outside for everyone else to deal with.  Fuck this objectively terrible lady and take your cat back."
dogs,fflw4f4,t3_eu45qv,1580044929.0,"Rescues do this ALL the time.  Our past rescue supposedly bit the father in the previous home on the hand when he picked up a child.  After we euthanized the dog for health reasons (diagnosed with SLE) we find out that the child wasn't involved at all and the dog just charged the father and bit him multiple times such that he had to go to the ER and get stitches in numerous places.  Also found out the dog had escalating aggression for years and would seemingly come out if nowhere.  All of which was told to the rescue and all of which was brushed off.   

I saw another one with a rescue I used to work with where a medium sized dog killed a small dog in the same household (tore it's throat completely out) and attacked another, both seemingly without a trigger the owners could identify.  Two days after the second incident, I find out the dog is in the rescue, playing with other dogs there, and not a single volunteer there knew what the dog had done.  

These are just the most egregious examples but this is quite common what you're describing.  

It's not just about decompression.  The rescues behavioral assessment confirms what you're seeing. They just sugar coated things to keep the belt moving as so many of them do.  Good luck regardless of what you do!"
watchpeoplesurvive,ffgyodb,t3_etc42v,1579918461.0,Terrible animals.
nextfuckinglevel,ffeuxkx,t1_ffek80y,1579866632.0,Pretty sure the dog just wanted to kill it....
ofcoursethatsathing,ffctpnf,t3_esqnvc,1579807062.0,"Alright scientists of reddit, what the fuck?"
dogs,ffcmyeq,t3_esrkmf,1579802877.0,"As a vet, this is one of the few times I've agreed with everyone on here.  It'll be fine and it definitely shouldn't be painful.  Just go to your vet when they open.  Do NOT pull it yourself as a couple have suggested.  Just as many have said, its easy to do but as with all things that are easy to do, it's easy to screw up too."
nextfuckinglevel,ff9i6qi,t3_esec21,1579713547.0,"Did you mean to misspell the inspirational title on this one, OP? Because clearly one if us is the asshole for thinking of that."
nextfuckinglevel,feug0ki,t1_feridqi,1579386153.0,Yeah.  Usually involves a hit toward the handle where it's weaker.
TwoXChromosomes,felojhw,t1_fekcx7m,1579227119.0,That's New York law for you.  California takes it next level though.
dogs,fekp7bd,t1_fejobrw,1579204737.0,"I would not recommend re-home ever for a dog that has done this.  Rescues sugar coat the hell out of bad behavior and this dog killed someone else's best friend.  Personally I would euthanize any dog that did this and if a dog came close, then I would make sure it's never going outside without a muzzle again."
WritersGroup,fejg99e,t3_epc3dy,1579172800.0,It's very good and flows well. Only comment would be to cut back on the metaphors toward the beginning.  They're well don't but I think there's two or three too many such that it becomes a little distracting.
nextfuckinglevel,fehjmsg,t3_ep08v0,1579117891.0,"They're extremely neglectful and abusive toward animals.  Our anatomy lab used to get the horse cadavers from there.  The guy in charge once had one with laminitis so bad it literally walked out of two of it's hooves. A lot of the puppy mill trainwrecks I saw in school were from Amish country as well.  I'm half posting this because it's true, and half because I feel like an Amish guy probably isn't going to post an angry reply."
writing,fdnlak3,t1_fdnkwm2,1578588174.0,"I should add that people are saying interrupting pacemaker cells but all heart tissue can in theory conduct, just at lower rates.  What you would need is an abnormal electrical loop created that sends signals abnormally such as ventricular fibrillation. If you simply fucked with the SA node and stopped it from working, you might just end up with a slower rhythm and perhaps some weakness/exercise intolerance but not death."
writing,fdnkwm2,t3_em9z7r,1578587946.0,"If there's any electrical magic then yes, probably.  Could perhaps alter conduction and simply send patient into ventricular fibrillation if your magic system allows such precision. If starting from outside in then it would leave quite a mark.  If can manipulate heart from inside body then might still leave a mark but would be as tiny as you need for your story."
writing,fdhqjne,t1_fdgz0bm,1578428200.0,"For sure.   The best improvements I've ever had in my writing were times that I read writing both unique to what I had seen and vivid.  I can even remember the books: Hyperion, The Yiddish Policeman's Union (listened to Adventures of Kavalier and Clay at same time), The Fifth Season, and currently listening to All the Light We Can Not See which I believe will become another one of those because I've never read anything quite so beautifully written through and through."
absoluteunit,fdbx8kx,t1_fdbwqbp,1578263354.0,"Low.  Honestly the problem with having a huge dog for protection (or even having any dog this large as a much smaller person) is they have the intellect of a three year old.  A three year old that could absolutely kill anyone.  A person this size (or most sizes tbh) probably couldn't control a dog like this and owning a large dog for defense is extraordinarily selfish.  It's far more likely the dog is going to hurt someone innocent than a criminal.  This dog may be nice though, just should have a sturdier owner."
