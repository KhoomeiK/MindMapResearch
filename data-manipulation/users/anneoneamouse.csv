The one exception might be the platesetter / conveggtor which is used for indirect cooking (it's just a big heat-shield).  Oddly- at low temp for e.g. pulled pork, and also screaming high temp e.g. for pizza.  That said, I did just fine without one for the first of couple years- lots of steaks, chicken, burgers, roasted veggies before I did my first pulled pork (or beef as an alternative), and pizzas.

Optics,ff9syok,t3_es76g9,1579720579.0,"From memory (don't have Goodman handy).

From object to image, you write two Fourier propagation integrals (one in. object coords,  second in aperture coords).  
One of the simplifying assumptions that removes a problematic quadratic phase term inside the integration over object coords is that the lens is mapping a single point on the object (x coords) to a single point on the image plane (x' coords).  This is usually written as a Gaussian transverse magnification term, effectively  dirac(z/z'-M), where M is constant mag If you make your M(x'), you'll be able to accurately generate psf that accounts for distortion.
A second quadratic phase term is removed if the lens makers equation is true, tying 1/z' = 1/f +1/z.  Then tie x' /x  = z'/z = M.
Now, the odd thing here is that the delta function(x,x') above ""slides inside"" the integral dx, and probably violates causality.  I've always thought that this is necessary because Goodman's describing the field behavior as entirely scalar; the lens adds a directional restriction (Snell) that I don't recall being accounted for elsewhere."

Optics,fe475d4,t1_fe3yvqr,1578856414.0,"Apologies, you're correct, I hadn't considered that.  I'll take a guess; remember that a lens acts like a spatial Fourier transform.  If the diffractives  (which are also a spatial Fourier transform) are arranged like a quilted pillow they will also behave something like a lenticular lens, creating that patchwork of images.  If the PowerPoint you showed is literal, this is probably the case.

Now, I may be completely off-base, which is possible, as I haven't built one of these devices, nor run any kind of optical model.  

So, if the lenticular setup either doesn't work, or is too optically complex, the other way to do it would be to sub-divide the fpa into macro-pixels.  Each macro pixel gets a spectral filter whose lambda value changes in a zigzag pattern.  You build your lambda image by choosing the appropriate lambda element of each macro pixel.  Describing this in PowerPoint might be a little complex.

I disagree with this statement.  A lens from Canon, Nikon etc is definitely the best performance you're going to get for the price; they've economies of scale on their side, and lots of experience of design for manufacture.  A custom built 50mm f/1 lens is probably a $200k commitment.  You might get 1.5x better MTF performance out of it over an OTS but no-one will notice that in any of the photographs you take.
