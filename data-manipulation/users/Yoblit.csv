worldnews,fexbjj6,t3_eqml5k,1579428171.0,"He should say further set up kids for addiction. We are addicted to money and the current economic system of this world. We are addicted to terrible food. We are addicted to a variety of drugs. We are addicted to the internet. As time goes on more systems of control are implemented. The loot box started off as a greedy device for corporate interest but has turned into another indoctrination machine preparing us for the eventual blindness we will have as adults. We only see as far as our desires which have already been defined for us.

Loot boxes are fucking useless they mostly offer lame vanity shit anyway."

The next year or your life is going to be hard no matter what you choose to do. You can try to move on and away, which in many ways would be the easiest choice. Or, you can attempt to make things right for yourself, however you need to. Either way this will change you. Most change is forced.

TrueOffMyChest,fe7896b,t3_enrpda,1578911281.0,"Complaining culture should be abolished. Tipping is the tipping point of the lives of many people in the industry. The industry that is on the verge of automation. Your tips feed a lot of families and removing the tip system will just create another industry where people can barely make a living. Plus taking away incentives from servers will only lessen their desire to give you good service.

As someone who has worked in the industry for over a decade ... If you don't think a server deserves a tip, don't give one."

Their business model was flawed from the beginning. Weed has a third of the shelf life of alcohal. It needs the expiry date equivalent to a bag or Doritos. The chips don't go bad at that point, but are past the level of freshness the customer would enjoy so get replaced.  This model would work better for weed because it can be sent back and it's active ingredients can be reconstituted back into other types of products."
