funny,fgq8sk7,t3_ezvjwf,1581019990.0,"Canadian. When I was in elementary school we didn't start learning metric stuff until like grade 3 or so. So I had several years where we still used the US measurements. Sadly that few years was enough to make the old way burned into my brain. But it's kind of a hodgepodge of the two in day to day life. Kilometres and liters, but feet, inches, and pounds. Weather is Celsius but oven temperature is Fahrenheit. Cooking is cups and tablespoons."

giantbomb,fgk3cyz,t3_eypo5r,1580856630.0,"Ya, I randomly find some old clip of him get reccomend on YouTube or something and it's always hard to watch. I remember being super depressed and sad for like a week after he passed crying at the drop of a hat. Which felt weird because ""celebrity"" deaths never get to me. I eventually realized it was different with Ryan because I was watching like 2-3 hours of GB everyday for years at that point. So it felt like he was a friend in my life that I lost when he suddenly wasn't there anymore. He was not just someone who made content I liked. Plus it felt like the guys were a lot more open about just their day to day bs. So it felt more real. At least that's the conclusion I came to. Thankfully I can watch his stuff now and just appreciate it."

But the one cat I had as a kid we got from a guy who was breeding Siamese and the mother got pregnant by a stray cat. She was grey and the best kitty in the world. Had her for 19 years before she passed. A few years ago I got another one. This time she was an orange cat. She climbed inside a car engine while a person was away at a camp. They never knew she was in there until they drove home for like 3 hours and heard a meowing. She needed a home so I got her. They always just seem to come I to my life so I have never been able to go pick one.

chastitytraining,ffnv4ev,t1_ffnudvv,1580071258.0,"I actually just locked myself back up today for the first time in awhile out of boredum, and I actually found that this one helps to keep it on a lot. I have one of those tiny metal nub ones on, and if the rubber around the testicles lays on top of the round ring you can position the top of the rubber to push against the nub. So while sitting your testicles get pushed away from your body but it creates like a lean that push the cage against your body. I just got back from going to the store and walking around in it all afternoon and to my glee and surprise my clitty hasn't slipped out once yet. I hope my description makes sense and can help you out. Hugs and best of luck."
chastity,ffnub49,t1_ffnrz11,1580070925.0,"If you're into cbt, or I guess anything sexual really would work, you could take some nail polish and colour code the keys. Keep a little note next to it to remember each one. Stuff like edge for an hour. Watch/read an hour of porn. Post a sexy selfie etc. Whatever your devilish mind can come up with. Keep some blank ones too so you have days of nothing. But that way you have fun possibilities to look forward to. I could see day after day of nothing could get frustrating in a not fun way. If you're worried about the feel of the key giving it away, you could go to a dollar store and invest in a cheap pair of rubber tongs so you can't feel it. Or put on a rubber glove before reaching in.

Anyway, hope I could inspire you. Would love to hear your experiences if you go through with it!"
chastitytraining,ffnkic8,t1_ffniavy,1580067197.0,"For me it's my right testicle. It's about half the size of my left one and that fucker is slippery as all hell. Even when doing cbt stuff she's always the problem child. So to speak. Lol I bought a ball stretcher [like this ](https://www.picclickimg.com/d/l400/pict/382865211966_/Perfect-Fit-Silaskin-Ball-stretcher.jpg) and cut it into 3 chunks so it wasn't as long. About half an inch thick or so. I stretch it over my testicles before doing any cbt or before putting myself in a cage. I find they work best to keep the girls from slipping out. But it can hurt if you sit certain ways if it's too tight. So make sure to walk around. Sit stretch etc to make sure it fits right. It can help with keeping in cage too, but it's far from the fantasy still sadly."
chastity,ffn9rpn,t3_etpl6s,1580063506.0,Looking perfect. Jealous and happy for you. Keep up the great work. A fun alternative is to put the key in a jar full of other keys.

chastity,ffn7sqx,t3_eu97r3,1580062914.0,"If you were mine I would be letting you out and sucking you dry. Then back in the cage for double the time. Repeat on 6 days, then 12, then 24 etc. I find it's a good ease into eventually getting you ready for permanent chastity once you reach the one year mark. Of course daily edging is a must. I want your balls blue and swollen.

CBTgenitaltorture,ffn61f4,t3_em3ydk,1580062409.0,"I started with weights as a kid. Like filling pop bottles with water. Paint cans etc. Then lift them up off the floor while jerking it. And tieing them to a string then to like a bed post and pulling back on them. Or tieing it to my foot and walking around. I would suggest chip clips too, but be careful as some clamp harder then others. So test it on your finger first. You want really light gentle ones then work your way up to stronger ones. You could also try putting them in a hard cover book and then leaning on them to see how much you can stand. I always found it harder, but slapping is a good start. With a fly swatter or sandle. You could also get heavy stuff and drop it on them.

If you have foreskin I enjoy tieing it closed super tight then peeing. It hurts and eventually pushes the string/clamp off and kinda of stings. Best to do in a bathtub for obvious reasons. You can invest in sounding tools to play with that. Find various hit things and try jerking off with them. Stuff like strong alcoholic hand santaizer is a fun start. There's actually a body wash called Irish spring that has like a tingly stuff in it that feels nice. Just start with a small area and give it several minutes to see how hot it gets. Don't want to get stuff too strong. Because water usually makes it worse so you may just have to deal with a 11/10 pain if you're not ready.

That's all I can think of atm. Just be safe and have fun. Cock rings are great to keep your balls from hiding inside. So I would invest in those asap too."
CBTgenitaltorture,ffn2lex,t3_et92ry,1580061325.0,I always wanted to find a way to keep it clamped shut then peeing. No matter how tight I get it it always slips off. Feels nice while I can keep it on though.
DnDGreentext,ffmwek2,t3_eu2z5o,1580059649.0,"If it's really bothering you, tell them to knock it off and that it makes you uncomfortable. If they don't respect that then you need new friends. Life is too damn short to allow toxic people who don't respect you. 

That said, I also enjoy fucking with the players. So I suggest you watch [teeth](https://youtu.be/J-qd-k0Vg7s) for inspiration. It's kind of a cringy sexist movie that portrays all men as rapists, but it's basically a revenge gore movie about a cute girl with teeth in her vagina. And the whole movie is about her biting off guys dicks. So ya, throw in a race like that or make some ""fun"" fantasy STDs and they will soon catch on. Plus it's DnD you could always curse them with a gender change or magic pregnancy. Just like real life Sex has consequences."

I measured and did the math and it basically came out to the same as buying a pack of 25 but like a dollar or two cheaper. The few times I accidentally bought a 25 pack I think they were like $16. So not worth it. Now with the new laws I'm paying the same but getting less. So now the cigarette companies get to make more money. Kinda dumb isn't it? Also they no longer have the filters I liked.

RATS,ffdz76v,t1_ffdymn3,1579832595.0,"Welcome. Just wanted to share the things I remembered being a surprise when I first got them as pets. And ya, the eye sight thing surpsied me too. If you notice them sitting there moving their head side to side kinda like a snake it's because of their eye sight. We thought our rats were sick before we found out they do it so they can see movement. The way it was explained to me was that by moving their head side to side they can spot movement better. If you google how their eye sight works there's some videos and articles that can explain it better than I ever could. But it's really different how their eyes work. And IIRC red eye rats have really bad eye sight, so you may need to baby them more. The couple we had with red eyes often would run off ledges and things. It was cuts/sad. Lol"
RATS,ffdxjzu,t3_et1ypm,1579831413.0,"Just some general advice, google any new food before giving it to them. There's a lot of weird stuff they can't have like oranges. It gives them cancer IIRC. When I first got them the food was the biggest surprise for me to wrap my head around. But ya, it sounds like they are just scared and adjusting to being alone. Remember they can't see more than a few feet in front of them. So to them they probably don't notice you on the other side of the room. Once they get a friend or two and time goes by they will adjust. Each rat will take different amounts of time.

Oh, and if you use wood chips for bedding Google it first. I can't recall but certain wood is bad for them. Same with wodden toys or ladders. Certain wood splinters and they can choke on it. I wish I could give specifics but it's been like 4 years since I had them. So my memory isn't the best on the details. I just remembered those being surprises I never thought about."
