AskReddit,ff1tbc7,t3_er4xhc,1579485709.0,"I feel $20 is a lot to spend on a mobile game, however so long as it isn't P2W (fine with some IAP like for cosmetics, speeding up non-competitive things, or bonuses in a single player or offline mode maybe), and doesn't have any adverts, I certainly wouldn't rule it out."

It's obvious that's not how he feels, it's just a jestful way of expressing why its wrong."
facepalm,fdkaaon,t1_fdk9xp1,1578499619.0,"Once again you're missing the entire point.
Noone here including myself is advocating any kind of exclusion or seperation of culture; I'm personally quite font of globalisation and how our language has evolved.

Take my point literally, the person that voted for the petition probably only meant the French language, not origin of French or mutual origin. 

You're taking this to other places that is not directly the point at hand.

Edit: ""Here"": Referred to myself or people upvoting my comments."
facepalm,fdk34sx,t1_fdk2vri,1578494904.0,"I will not deny that, however it's a moot point because this isn't 400 years ago; it's now. The words have already been adopted as part of the English language.

Once again, this is pointed at a language, not words that originate from a language or have mutual origin with it.

Edit: I would like to clarify, I am only debating the intent of the person that made the poll. Not the removal of any words from a British passport."
facepalm,fdk221n,t3_elshk4,1578494130.0,"I'm no expert in language, but I feel like you've intentional misinterpreted this to make a post.

It can be inferred that it's referring to French the language, not words that originate from or have the same origin as French.

Facepalm is on OP, granted I do feel the petition is a bit silly as well."
MadeMeSmile,fdjwqkb,t1_fdjv4x8,1578489964.0,"Well I can't speak for two or three year-old me as I wouldn't have any memory of it, but for as long as I can remember the only reading I've enjoyed is non-fiction, and I'm certainly not the only one that feels this way. Despite this I generally dislike reading and find it boring, however it's how I learn best as it offers the most in depth explanations compared to any other medium.

I will partially concede to the rest of your message, I just wanted to clarify that people including children can already know if they would prefer an alternate means to consume fictional content than books. Saying ""come on"", is not a justification to associate being read to as a necessary aspect of having a fulfilling childhood."
MadeMeSmile,fdjn5jh,t3_elnws6,1578478999.0,"The ending did make me smile however, the general post sounds kinda crappy. Someone being consistently pushy for their hobby that the other party has shown clear disinterest in, and going on to say he didn't have a fulfilled childhood... I didn't even know, and still doubt, reading to your child is such a norm. I've certainly never had it and quite frankly would never have wanted it; I find fictional books incredibly boring, and there is nothing wrong with preferring other media.

The end is also redundant and makes this sound fake, why the hell does he have to read the book to her, why not an audio book?

I don't mean to be a kill joy, I just hate the idea of claiming someone lost their childhood just because it wasn't the same as yours."
AskReddit,fdirav4,t3_eledtr,1578449286.0,"Regular expression; it's really quite simple but most people I know look at it like it's utter nonsense.

I'll admit it does look a bit intimidating to start but once you experiment a bit with trying to match colors, email address, or other smaller things it becomes more evident there is nothing complicated about it. Even the ""complex"" patterns are just lots of small simple things but put together."
assholedesign,fdd8s21,t1_fdbwrn4,1578300051.0,"I don't know about others but it's more a matter of principle.
Blocking is a last resort thing for me, we have the right to be subscribed and the right to be forgotten, which both apply in this case; not to mention it at the very least exposes companies with shitty practices that we'd like to avoid if they do decide to be dicks about it."
cybersecurity,fd4lcqc,t3_ejwps8,1578168596.0,"This is a typical sextortion scam, you're 99% safe.
This guy most certainly hasn't done anything to your PC however they usually operate by collecting emails and passwords from recent breaches. 

Regardless of if this particular email included your password or not, it may be worth changing some or using a password manager if you don't already?

To reiterate, you _most likely_ haven't been recorded, and there's probably no key logger etcetc, he just pulled it out of his ass. But how he obtained the email, and if it includes the password then that too, should be a concern."

(Since this does affect if the asshole design is on the app, or the author of the comic.)"

security,fbzwbps,t1_fbzgkqq,1577265111.0,"Only reason I know of is BCrypt only allows up to 72 bytes I think. (Worth noting, bytes != Characters, so if you have a password with emojies it'd significantly less since they can be multiple bytes per character.)

Edit: It's worth noting some people like Dropbox work around this limitation by hashing the password with SHA256 or SHA512 first, then use BCrypt. This avoids the byte limit."
