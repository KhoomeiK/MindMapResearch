Parenting,ff32yh2,t3_er8hoo,1579532318.0,"I always always hated this debated. Definitely felt loads of pressure to breast feed with my first baby. Last two, I bottle and breast simply bc they weren’t getting enough on just breast milk. You do what ever works for YOU and YOUR baby! We deal with enough pressures as it is when it comes to parenthood."

offmychest,feerwtv,t1_feerq7x,1579039904.0,Oh we have. They sent out a warning to everyone in my building saying that they would be fined for littering if caught.
offmychest,fe8a5a1,t3_enrwa2,1578924118.0,"Nope. Not alone at all. I hate when they’d post things about ‘fake friends’ or ‘true friends’.. like bitch, what about me? We’ve known each other since kindergarten. Lol. I always thought it was stupid to even care though bc as adults we get busy and shouldn’t expect some one to constantly be up your ass."
NoFap,fe2p8lh,t3_enlmzp,1578841379.0,">But if you happen to see someone attractive and were sexually aroused, that's fucking normal. 


I agree with your post but I think we should stop seeing people as sex objects, period. Yes, attraction is normal and, as you pointed out, not to stare or be creepy about it.. but the first thing you think about a person, esp one you just randomly see, shouldn’t be “damn I want to fuck that”."
passiveaggressive,fdscb50,t1_fdsc8aq,1578699340.0,Well passive aggressive is = to trash right?
