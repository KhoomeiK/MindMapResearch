1. Pls don’t use any dark oak signs it’s kind of hard to read.
2. Some corridors seem a bit too tight.
3. The midle part of the drop to me looks a bit ugly, in contrast to the top and bottom which are good, try removing the granite.
4. Under the sea lanterns you could put some black glass.
5. The pillar that Toriel hides behind is a bit too big, maybe maling the main stem 1 block wide might seem a bit to small but at least it would leave sone space for Toriel to be.
6. You could (with commands) put a villager (that doesn’t move on his own or when hit and that doesn’t make any sounds) to make the dummy.

Aside from those details you captured the feel of the Ruins quite well and you made a lot of block choices that I liked. 
Good job! Stay Determined!

Capitalism,fef3df3,t1_fef1x2o,1579047222.0,"Yea, everyone having equal opportunities is not possible, but the fact that there are unequal outcomes is not unethical, as this would happen regardless of the differences of opportunities. And the differences in opportunities is an issue, but it isn’t the one you asked about.
And about how you measure hard work you can’t really do that. But you can tell that some people do work more or less, this can be very clearly seen on a school and university enviourment. In school you can see that some people are lazy and get bad grades. This attitudes can persist through time, justifying that some people who work hard do better than some who don’t.
This doesn’t mean that this js always the case but it does show that effort does lead to unequal distributions in wealth"
Capitalism,feej763,t3_eol4dh,1579034838.0,Yes inequality is absolutly a logical outcome of the free market and also it is an ethical one too. This is because if you choose to work hard or do something that others would be willing to pay a lot of money you should do economicly better than someone else that doesn’t try to do his/her best

And also, I completly encurage you as you said, “to not get involved with them any longer” beeing around people like that is very mentally exhausting and gets no progress done (this is why I don’t even talk to half me fammily about politics anymore).

Capitalism,fd6fer7,t3_ejg7bm,1578190151.0,"First of all arguing against a communist with the objective of getting them to accept a new position is really, really hard, maby imposible, but if you want to attempt it ill tell you how:

First of all communists will argue for what is “better for the people” and promote the idea of absolute social equality (or for a society the closest to that possible).

Second, any economic argument will be ignored, meritocracy will be ignored unless it helps their position and using arguments like “there hasn’t existed any succesfull communist state, every single one has failed”. This point will be ingnored probably with the counterargument: “those weren’t real communist states and/or this states were boycotted by the United States.

So how can you argue against them having this in mind? You have to mention all the good things that capitalism has done for the people, especially the lower class. This must be the central argument but for it to be effective you must have MANY MANY examples, but that part is for you to reaserch, good luck"
