science,ffh3xx3,t1_fffvt45,1579922450.0,That's not the norm.  Plus those that hit big later probably already had it good.  Or at least are well connected.
creepy,ffh0kdp,t3_etgp33,1579919880.0,Actually that looks really lame.  Like hey I can be CREEPY... in a *very* lazy manner.

NOPE!

PGI seems to think it's all on the up and up. I, OTOH, am pretty unimpressed.  Again, its on modders to fix this."
Mechwarrior5,ffgrpxi,t1_ffebv4a,1579913362.0,Get a mech as in get to salvage it at the end of the mission.
news,fff14ur,t1_fff0cvf,1579872809.0,Take a few.  Be thorough... yet not too thorough.
news,fff0q7w,t1_fff0evg,1579872464.0,LoL. Im jumping to conclusions!  Got a mat for it and everything.

Mechwarrior5,ffdq1ta,t3_esmjn5,1579826222.0,Ha!  He isn't wrong. We get to run the company because we came from daddy's left nut. Not because of any actual sort of qualification.  That made me tune the story out pretty quick.
Mechwarrior5,ffdooyf,t1_ffb18kh,1579825368.0,Modders gonna finish the game.  \*sigh\*
Mechwarrior5,ffd33oh,t1_ffd0hm8,1579812469.0,"I mean you are more likely to get a mech in vanilla by coring it than legging it.  Which makes ZERO sense.

:EDIT:

By ""getting"" I meant you can salvage a cored mech more likely than legging it.  That's the part that I don't get.  Cored mech should = DESTROYED>"
