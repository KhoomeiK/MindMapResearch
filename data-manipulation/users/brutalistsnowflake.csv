No one is running against trump, there will be no Republican debates, no huge group of contenders and that's how they want it. If we do the typical Democrat thing and abstain, or "" vote our conscience"" because our perfect choice isn't on the ballot in November, we WILL have four more years of trump. That will make everyone who does the aforementioned a Trump voter. There are zero excuses for this. If he wins again, it's because we fucked ourselves."
