Not to be THAT guy, but I had a wee bone to pick with the description of GM. I think it focuses too much on book 1. The overarching idea of the book is that morality has evolved from immorality. Each book attempts to show in a different way how this is the case. Book 1 shows that good originates in strength and class. Book 2 shows that moral conscience originates from forced repression of our base, anti-social instincts. Book 3 shows how the desire for self-abnegation characterized by the ascetic ideal and glorified in praise for virtues like humility, chastity, poverty, etc., originate in a desire for power. Each book deals with a branch of the family tree that is morality. Book 1 tends to get the most press because it is first and perhaps pound-for-pound the juiciest part of N's whole corpus for the general reader. Don't get me wrong; the press is deserving; but something is lost if we focus too much on it. Just my two cents."

Nietzsche,fd3apzr,t1_fcz27uy,1578156436.0," I understand the difference between determinism and fatalism to be that for the latter there is no causal necessity between one event and the next. Each could not have been otherwise for reasons independent of one another. For the determinist, one the other hand, an event could not have been otherwise due to an antecedent event that is its cause (and which in turn has been caused by a prior antecedent event).

In this sense I see Nietzsche as a determinist and not a fatalist. 

>this is why, imo, he chooses to style himself a “fatalist”, preferring not to see the universe as mechanical or “determined”, but rather each individual as a force fated by its own momentum

As you pointed out, the individual is not what we think it is for Nietzsche. It seems to be at base what he refers to as drives, which he would ultimately explain in physiological terms. So, if we understand the individual to be the individual drive at play then it seems that his position is squarely deterministic. Would you agree? Is there something more to your account of N's fatalism that I am missing? He does speak about fate quite often and amor fati is a very important part of his philosophy but I do not see how he is not simply a determinist in the sense I have described."
Nietzsche,fcyucxp,t1_fcykqf4,1578087268.0,"Thank you for the detailed answer. It seems then that for N, when I think, I therefore am not insofar as consciousness is always a misunderstanding. If, then, we associate the ""I"" with the body, then who I am at any given moment is simply reducible to whatever drive is operating with the most strength or force at that time. It seems to me that Nietzsche is just a straight up determinist and not really one who subverts the free will-determinism debate (beyond criticising those who draw faulty moral conclusions from the assumed truth of either position). In short, I do not see how Nietzsche's philosophy allows for prescription on any level beyond the unsatisfying ""I have no choice but to believe x ought to y"". Even shorter, how can I fail to become who I am? If we all become who we are regardless of what we do, what value is there to Nietzsche showing us how?"
Nietzsche,fcxv349,t3_eizisq,1578070844.0,"Read the wikipedia entry on Nietzsche to get a basic sense of what his philosophy is about. Then read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry  on Nietzsche to get a much more detailed and philosophically-accurate sense. Then read book 1 of the Genealogy of Morals to see Nietzsche's philosophy in action (it is perhaps the clearest and most concise example of his method). Then read book 1 again (N, as with most philosophers, requires rereading). From there, continue with books 2 and 3. Then you should be primed to tackle the rest of his works. I suggest starting with Beyond Good and Evil or The Gay Science, as they are perhaps the best books to get a sense of the scope of N's philosophy. There is an argument to be made to proceed through his works chronologically beginning with The Birth of Tragedy, but that is more for those interested in being a Nietzsche scholar."

I agree that he cannot be regarded as a determinist given his rejection of cause and effect you have outlined. I was always uncomfortable with regarding N as a determinist but felt that it was difficult to avoid that conclusion (I even went so far as to write a paper on it after reading Brian Leiter's take on N as a determinist, or what he called a 'causal essentialist', iirc).

Not to be THAT guy, but I had a wee bone to pick with the description of GM. I think it focuses too much on book 1. The overarching idea of the book is that morality has evolved from immorality. Each book attempts to show in a different way how this is the case. Book 1 shows that good originates in strength and class. Book 2 shows that moral conscience originates from forced repression of our base, anti-social instincts. Book 3 shows how the desire for self-abnegation characterized by the ascetic ideal and glorified in praise for virtues like humility, chastity, poverty, etc., originate in a desire for power. Each book deals with a branch of the family tree that is morality. Book 1 tends to get the most press because it is first and perhaps pound-for-pound the juiciest part of N's whole corpus for the general reader. Don't get me wrong; the press is deserving; but something is lost if we focus too much on it. Just my two cents."

Nietzsche,fd3apzr,t1_fcz27uy,1578156436.0," I understand the difference between determinism and fatalism to be that for the latter there is no causal necessity between one event and the next. Each could not have been otherwise for reasons independent of one another. For the determinist, one the other hand, an event could not have been otherwise due to an antecedent event that is its cause (and which in turn has been caused by a prior antecedent event).

In this sense I see Nietzsche as a determinist and not a fatalist. 

>this is why, imo, he chooses to style himself a â€œfatalistâ€, preferring not to see the universe as mechanical or â€œdeterminedâ€, but rather each individual as a force fated by its own momentum

As you pointed out, the individual is not what we think it is for Nietzsche. It seems to be at base what he refers to as drives, which he would ultimately explain in physiological terms. So, if we understand the individual to be the individual drive at play then it seems that his position is squarely deterministic. Would you agree? Is there something more to your account of N's fatalism that I am missing? He does speak about fate quite often and amor fati is a very important part of his philosophy but I do not see how he is not simply a determinist in the sense I have described."
Nietzsche,fcyucxp,t1_fcykqf4,1578087268.0,"Thank you for the detailed answer. It seems then that for N, when I think, I therefore am not insofar as consciousness is always a misunderstanding. If, then, we associate the ""I"" with the body, then who I am at any given moment is simply reducible to whatever drive is operating with the most strength or force at that time. It seems to me that Nietzsche is just a straight up determinist and not really one who subverts the free will-determinism debate (beyond criticising those who draw faulty moral conclusions from the assumed truth of either position). In short, I do not see how Nietzsche's philosophy allows for prescription on any level beyond the unsatisfying ""I have no choice but to believe x ought to y"". Even shorter, how can I fail to become who I am? If we all become who we are regardless of what we do, what value is there to Nietzsche showing us how?"
Nietzsche,fcxv349,t3_eizisq,1578070844.0,"Read the wikipedia entry on Nietzsche to get a basic sense of what his philosophy is about. Then read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry  on Nietzsche to get a much more detailed and philosophically-accurate sense. Then read book 1 of the Genealogy of Morals to see Nietzsche's philosophy in action (it is perhaps the clearest and most concise example of his method). Then read book 1 again (N, as with most philosophers, requires rereading). From there, continue with books 2 and 3. Then you should be primed to tackle the rest of his works. I suggest starting with Beyond Good and Evil or The Gay Science, as they are perhaps the best books to get a sense of the scope of N's philosophy. There is an argument to be made to proceed through his works chronologically beginning with The Birth of Tragedy, but that is more for those interested in being a Nietzsche scholar."
