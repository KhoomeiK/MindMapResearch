That's good to hear. I've more or less treated ESO like a watered down Skyrim, which was already a watered down Oblivion, which was a watered down Morrowind, with the huge upside of multiplayer and many social and cosmetic features. And treating it like that has been a lot of fun. As I say, I've only finished Glenumbra as Covenant and that was done over a period of weeks."

whiteknighting,fdpg1o9,t1_fdpceck,1578627679.0,"There exists a multitude of chemicals in the brain that fire upon intercourse echoing a biological parallel to how we speak of sex in great works of literature, art, song and sentiments of religion. Existing, as it would seem, for the sole purpose of pair bonding a couple in a deeply intimate, psychologically resonant and emotional way. Unless you swallow the same social constructionist hogwash the left would on such matters, I would posit people desensitize themselves to these chemicals at their own peril. I would too argue such things play no small part in the lack of content marriages and lack of marriages of younger people entirely, with the exception of those raised in religious communities where such things are respected.

Where there's smoke there's fire, and this is no smoke you can simply blow away to justify whatever pleasures one indulges in. All things have a cost."
whiteknighting,fdp5uax,t1_fdozkg9,1578620697.0,"Then you take a notion carried thousands of years, across dozens of cultures via numerous belief systems, expressed in every form of art imaginable and cast it into the fire on the fickle whims of your junk.

whiteknighting,fdonblu,t3_emdj68,1578608651.0,"Imagine how nihilistic and unfamiliar with meaning you must be to boil the most personal, intimate interaction between two people down to a mere transaction. Once we taught monkeys about currency, the first thing they learned to do was buy sex off one another, so congratulations. You've reached chimp level sentience. Maybe in another 3 million years they'll happen across dignity, self respect and then maybe just maybe the idea of virtue and value."
KotakuInAction,fdl3b5x,t3_elw6ne,1578516336.0,"In times of antiquity, from what I understand actors, singers and performers were considered with no more esteem  on the social ladder than prostitutes. Glorified toys for adults. I don't know why or how it got so mixed up."
