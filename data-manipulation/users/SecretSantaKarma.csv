Except the women deemed ""respectable"" are still victims of male violence, rape, and murder, so.... his logic doesn't check out.  

I'm sorry, but ""We need sex workers otherwise men will relentlessly beat, rape, and murder women and children"" is the most horrible justification I've ever heard.  Honestly, hearing men low key threaten half the human population with rape and violence, on the grounds of sexual access, makes me hope for a fucking male plague.  

SEX IS NOT A HUMAN RIGHT, full stop. It is purely a want, not a right nor a necessity. If the answer is no, then that's it, end of discussion. Nobody has the right to purchase or pressure or guilt or shame or force others into having sex they don't want.  Men need to learn to control themselves. Do they think women don't enjoy sex too? They do, they just have empathy for other people, basic human decency, and the ability to control their urges."
TrollXChromosomes,fefpdyt,t3_eoof3c,1579061487.0,"There's a deeper issue at play that doesn't confront the unfortunate reality of male violence. Gay men are also victims of male dominance and violence (as well as other men, women, transwomen, transmen, children, elderly people, literally no one is exempt) so shouldn't they be included too? Why don't we ever hear men preach peace and acceptance, and make the male spaces safe for all males, even if non-conforming? In most places, the womens facilities are gender neutral, but they leave the mens spaces for men only. There are schools with gender neutral facilities who report girls are missing more school due to menstruation and fears of feeling ""period shame"", or kids who won't drink liquid all day long and/or hold their pee (putting them at risk of urinary tract/bladder/kidney infections), for fear of mixed-sex interactions in bathrooms.  Why is it always women who have to accommodate for male violence? I don't deny that everyone would be safer using womens facilities (or even better: neutral, private, floor-to-ceiling enclosed individual facilities) but also, **we should be teaching men not to be violent and to not rape; NOT using women as human shields**."
relationship_advice,fdjap6f,t1_fdj3rrd,1578463472.0,">her mom brought up that she never went to the doctor´s for the birth control shot ever and her response was that she didn’t mean to lie so what I took from that was she actually did lie?  

You do realize teenagers can go to planned parenthood and get birth control without their parents knowledge or consent? It's possible she did get birth control, and lied to her parents about it, or not, but either way, why is your son not using condoms? Even if she had an IUD or was born without a uterus or his partner was another male or any number of scenarios that would make pregnancy impossible, **he should still be using condoms.**   Was he sexually active with, and if so, was he using condoms with his girlfriend, or does she need to get tested for pregnancy and STIs as well?  

You need to teach your son that everyone is responsible for their own protection, and not to trust his potential health and reproductive capabilities to anyone else. Men should wear condoms, women should insist a man wears a condom and/or have her own form of birth control.  

If you’re having unprotected sex then you have to accept that there’s consequences that might come along with that, one of those being an unwanted pregnancy. So people who want to avoid that should either not have sex or have proper protection in place. Sure, accidents happen, but accidents happen a whole lot more when you’re having unprotected sex with people you don't know and can’t trust.  I'd say if your girlfriends friend is having sex with you, that's a pretty strong indicator that she's not trustworthy."
GenderCritical,fd75ulq,t1_fd71jiu,1578199823.0,"The conclusion that male degenerate inmates will get from this is:  
1.) Claim to be woman. (No one will verify) 
2 ) Request transfer. (No one will question it) 
3.) Sexually harass women with impunity. (No one cares) 
4.) Rape women with impunity. (Sex in prison under these conditions is absolutely rape. Not sure why they even mentioned that they ""weren't sure how consensual it was."" She was locked in a fucking cage with a violent man, what's the debate here?? But alas, no one cares.)  
5.) Get woman pregnant. (No one cares)  
6.) Savagely beat pregnant woman in front of a crowd of other inmates. (Again, no one cares)  
7.) Having successfully invaded womens prison, terrorized, raped, and assaulted these women, collect your reward: A get out of jail free card.   
8.) Leave the woman to give birth in prison and have her baby forcefully taken from her, like the fucking Handmaids Tale.  

And they'd be correct.  

I won't be surprised if they give the rapist her baby while she's serving out the rest of her sentence. Just as an extra vile form of punishment, because these people clearly hate women passionately."
GenderCritical,fd74jfm,t3_ek2w9w,1578199337.0,"What the actual fuck. What did they think would happen when you allow men to self identify into womens prisons, especially men with a long history and multiple convictions of violence against women??  

>Mr Nahir Fernández was denounced on April 4 for “savagely beating” the woman when he learned that she was pregnant, and 11 women attested to witnessing the attack. After the discovery, a judge released Mr Nahir Fernández from custody, determining that he was eligible for parole. **The woman remains in prison.** “The pregnant person has a very long sentence and could now request house arrest,” Mr Domingo Gacitúa said.  

But ""tHiS nEvEr HaPpEnS!"" tho, right?   

Also, does anyone else read that quote about the pregnant rape victim (sex in prison under these conditions is rape) being eligible for house arrest is supposed to be some kind of fucking blessing in disguise???  *Rage*  

Am I understanding this correctly, that the attorney for this rapist male is the one speaking out to the media and condemning the self-ID policy?  

>“There is no infrastructure in place for those who have a gender change,” the attorney lamented in the interview with Channel 12. “The law is much faster than the infrastructure the state can provide.” He called it “dangerous.” “What would happen if many women perceived themselves as male? They would be transferred to a men’s prison … Can you imagine a situation of women bathing in the same environment as men?”  

That's why TIFs aren't screaming and forcing their way into mens prisons. Because they KNOW they will be raped, abused, and possibly murdered, because biology is real. I remember a recent story where an actual woman was clocked as a TIM by a shitty guard on a power trip, and so was sent to the mens holding area. The men immediately started circling like wolves. She was so scared she urinated her pants and refused to move off her bunk for any reason, for several days.  I cannot imagine the fear of being literally locked in a cage with violent, depraved men, unable to escape, and with the entire prison system backing them up. This is so outrageous, why the fuck does anyone allow this?"

todayilearned,fd3wr4e,t1_fd2y949,1578162291.0,"Hoo boy, working is WAY easier than raising kids and running a household, hands down. I used to stay at home with our kids but I was really unhappy and felt unfulfilled. I'm just not wired for it.  My husband on the other hand is absolutely amazing with our kids and the household. So he quit his job to watch the kids, and I work full time. He does an amazing job with them, and goes above and beyond and does stuff like keep the house clean and cook meals (which is both of our responsibility, but he really steps up and volunteers to do more than his share). Going to work everyday is a *relief* for me, it's so much easier and less stressful, and I get adult interaction.  I would 100% choose to work over staying home to raise kids, even if I barely made enough to pay for daycare. My sanity needs it, lol.  

Huge props to stay at home parents, y'all are the real heroes!"

If he takes the kids anywhere without me, people are like, ""You're such a good dad!"" Here, let me help you!"" Lol, wut? I had a random lady lecture me about letting my kid eat grapes, and also people giving me dirty looks and make comments about taking my twin babies out without shoes on. (They're babies! They don't walk! And it was summer time, who cares?)  
My husband says he's never been parent-shamed or felt judged like that in public, and in fact, people go out of their way to be helpful to him and gush over how good of a dad he must be. 

Is the bar for dads really that low that just being with your children makes you exceptional? Fathers who are involved and loving are an amazing thing, and honestly it's a goal we as parents should all strive for imho, but it's sad that it seems to be the exception, rather than the rule. I hope we can change that and encourage dads to be more involved with their kids without worrying what society will think of them."
