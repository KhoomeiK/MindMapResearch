dankmemes,ff7opf0,t1_ff6s6f7,1579654635.0,My old science teacher would do this but on a larger scale. You’d get like 8-10 a’s then a c and then another 6 a’s. He said it taught us not to second guess ourselves but it would mess with our heads all the time.
Lineman,ff1vwpy,t1_fexmunk,1579487374.0,"Good communication when running a hand line, prepping material, and whatever you do, do it right the first time meaning bolts tight, washers square, arms level etc. Do things right and speed will follow. Be safe out there!"
Lineman,fesgae6,t3_eqghyv,1579364878.0,"Hell no it wouldn’t give you a step backwards. I was a groundman for about a year before I started my apprenticeship and it made my life so much easier as a low step apprentice. It helps you learn material, how getting a job works, and how the entire trade itself works. Your classmates who think it’s a waste of time are the real idiots. Lineschool doesn’t teach you shit except how to climb. I went to NLC and honestly regret it. Not only because I realized that I didn’t even need to go get in, but also because of the stigma that comes with it. Everyone who comes from lineschool acts like they know everything and they don’t know a damn thing. That’s pretty important to remember when you start your apprenticeship. I hope this will help you and good luck."
