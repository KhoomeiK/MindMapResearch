We have learned that The Mavericks are not going to be able to board the ship in Miami with the rest of us & instead will be boarding at the docking on Key West. That does not matter at all! I have had bottled iced tea & water ordered for our suites. Yesterday I bought a new metal bracelet & put it on. I am calling it my Alcohol Armor. It will help me protect myself from the onslaught of alcohol that I am going to subject myself to on that ship! I did it last year & I can do it again this year! It really was the greatest vacation ever! I’m ready for a repeat!

I did not realize it at the time, but now I know that the *real* growing up for The Husband & I, started with that first baby. That “baby” is now 37 years old & his baby girl, now 6, is sitting right next to me eating her breakfast of eggs, potatoes & bacon! Last night was her night to spend with Big Daddy & Gram Cracker! Thats what she calls me, her Gram Cracker! I do try not to think about what Eldest Son is trying to tell me with that Moniker! Enjoy your baby girl. I can promise you that the days will seem very long but the years will go by in a fucking flash..trust me on that!"

There was a guy in there I never saw before! Turned out it was the Principle! Was interesting to learn about myself that at 63 y/o, I am still terrified of School Principles! He introduced himself to me & I was practically speechless! And I am not one who is without words most of the time! Getting a Pedicure for the Cruise today!"

stopdrinking,ffbs9pw,t1_ff8v1z7,1579780811.0,"Headed to BB&B today!! Thank you for the tip! We will be in a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite but still quite cozy. The Husbands Manager will be in the other bedroom & I just learned the drummer will be on our couch for 2 of the 5 nights! Oh my! Years ago the Drummer & I got caught making out & he & I still have to suffer hours of teasing every time the band is all together for something. Like this Cruise! But its all in good fun. Just not for his wife...but she’s not coming!"
weightwatchers,ffbs2g0,t1_ff972ka,1579780568.0,"GREAT! When is Date #2? My second date with my Husband of soon to be 39 years on 2/11...was the first time I ever saw him in actual daylight! He’s a Musician, I was a Groupie, so not a lot of daylight involved in that action! I remember thinking that he was too good looking for me. I’m so glad I was wrong!"

stopdrinking,ffbru83,t1_ffa4502,1579780301.0,"Thank you for the “shoe support” u/Dizbetty! When we drive for a vacation, short or long, damn near everything goes! An entire box of shoes, sandals, sneakers, whatever I want! I love that your husband has a shoe thing going on too. That makes it easier for you!"
stopdrinking,ff8s2oe,t3_es7802,1579693871.0,"**6 DAYS TO OUTLAW COUNTRY CRUISE #5** I started to make a list for what to pack for the cruise Last night, when the Husband stops by the closet & casually says, “Baby? You might want to take a smaller suitcase!” Wait...what? I *had* a smaller one that I usually use, but got the bigger one down for this trip! I’m rethinking & trying to blend outfits together this morning. I know I can do laundry on the ship but who the fuck wants to do laundry on their vacation? Shoes!!! That’s gonna be my problem right there! I am so not a one pair of shoes kind of a girl! I got some thinking, not drinking, to do today!"

stopdrinking,ff8qu9u,t1_ff5tv93,1579692319.0,"I would go and do practically *anything* just to get the fuck out of Cincifuckingnati in the middle of winter. That the cruise goes to Jamaica this year, is a BONUS!"
cats,ff8qred,t1_ff65ivp,1579692210.0,"No your love will never fade. Sitting right next to me on a bookshelf are 2 cremated cats that we had for 18.5 years when we lived back home in San Diego. They were brother & sister & we’d adopted them at 9 weeks old. They died in 2014 within 4 months of each other. It was terrible. When we moved in 2016 here to Cincifuckingnati, my Husband said, “Are we really going to pay to move 2 dead cats across the country?” Yeah we are & we did! I love having them still with us! We have 3 young adult cats now, all adopted in our first years here, but separately. They all get along great. Obviously, I love cats! I hope you find another little Fred one day!"
