When dinner is late they send the one I love more to bug me and beg for dinner. I know this is a coordinated, planned thing because the other less-loved dog who is usually needier hangs back. He stands in the shadows or peeks around the door making sure that all is going according to plan. 

Fucking evil genius."

Dragged myself to the kitchen. Boiled some water. Grabbed my clay teapot, tea pet, and tray and did a whole mini knock-off ceremony.

Currently drinking some ripe pu-erh from Simon Levelt and trying to feel human again."
languagelearning,ffbqwjb,t3_ers3x6,1579779145.0,"Honestly I was wondering the same thing myself this week. I’m a native English speaker living in the Netherlands (outside the Randstad). I find that a lot of Dutch people (especially baby boomers) will say they speak English, but then when they hear my shitty Dutch they’ll admit that my Dutch is better than their English. 

My husband is Dutch. He’ll say he “speaks” 5 languages, but he’s really only A2-low B1 level in everything but Dutch and English. 

My personal definition is that you “speak” a language if you speak it well enough to be yourself in it. So you can say everything you want to say in the way you want to say it. By that metric, I don’t say I “speak” Dutch even though I work in Dutch, speak to my friends and in laws in Dutch, and consume 1/3 of my media in Dutch."

I confused this whole day with a different day.

There is no “tripel” at the Achel Kluis. Or at least it’s not called a tripel. You get to choose between brown and blonde of two different strengths and that’s it. It’s a pretty cool “no frills” kind of place. Basically just a cafeteria in the wall of the monastery. The food is terrible haha.

But they have some great beer. And they have a beer shop with hundreds of different Belgian beers."

food,ff2scnc,t1_ff2pswf,1579522041.0,"Brussel waffles are not yeasted. Instead the egg whites in them are whipped up real hard to make them light and crunchy. The stuff it’s made out of could be described as a “batter”. The shape is usually perfectly square. This is the “Belgian waffle” you get in America.

Liège waffles are actually risen with yeast so you could say they were made from a “dough”. They usually have sugar crystals embedded inside. They’re thicker, sweeter, and honestly they’re an entire meal to themselves. The shape is more free-form.

They’re both amazing. Best waffles ever."
