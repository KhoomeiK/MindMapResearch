NoStupidQuestions,ff57hij,t1_ff3jwbd,1579582469.0,I have a sweet male cat who loves everyone and snuggles but he needs his alone time. Since he was a kitten he would sneak off and nap in small spaces. I would guess its nothing to worry about unless they are otherwise acting sick or threatened.

AskReddit,fe5vnzp,t1_fe2sy7a,1578875974.0,"Don't burn any bridges is maybe the only good advice I ever got from my parents, lol, but it is very true. I was co-supervising with someone who the whole office hated and talked shit about - even management. I stayed above it and was nice to her, though I was open in my supervising style being different from hers. She ended up leaving. 2 years later she ended up being on the panel interviewing me at a different company with potential for a 20k raise. Sure am glad I was nice to her back when."
