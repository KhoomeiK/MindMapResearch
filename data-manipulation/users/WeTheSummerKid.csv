Philippines,fetci6w,t3_eqdyhq,1579373915.0,"Meth: a drug like the ADHD medications Ritalin or Adderall (it’s even almost chemically identical to Adderall). Far more powerful than either: Meth can cause brain damage in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. Popularity seems to be due to its low cost of manufacturing (therefore lower markups). In America, people can do a dangerous “shake and bake” to make meth, but in the Philippines it is commonly sold by dealers (either made in the Philippines or made as far away as North Korea). People use it either as a recreational escapist substance, or, as a performance enhancer (increases physical abilities such as suppressing appetite).
