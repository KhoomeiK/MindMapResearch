I had a daith piercing (01/30/15) in my left ear that was not happy at all. I waited six weeks, but it just kept getting worse. The piercer promised he used titanium jewelry, but when I called back to ask about purchasing titanium jewelry they said they didn't carry nor had they ever carried titanium jewelry. The whole experience was a HOT MESS, even though the shop had at least 70 5 star reviews online! I was not offered the chance to pick my own jewelry when pierced, the piercer used a clamp and then removed the needle before inserting the jewelry (100,000/10 would not recommend), I found out that the jewelry was not the proper size (18g instead of 16 or 14) and was cutting the hole to shreds whenever I moved my head because it was too thin to be sturdy during healing, it had been pierced at the wrong angle, was too shallow, was migrating, and ohhhh the pain! I cringed so hard when I saw your picture. I could feel my left ear screaming. I am relieved that you were able to get your piercing to calm down so much in a month! That is WONDERFUL PROGRESS!

My story has a happy ending. I had my right daith pierced the day my left daith piercing was removed (02/19/16) by a piercer who wanted to go find and beat up the guy who jacked up my ear (not that I encourage violence, but he made me laugh and feel very cared for when I was feeling super angry and afraid). This piercer showed me pictures of his work before he even touched my ear, used no clamp, properly sized 16g titanium jewelry that I got to choose (gun metal in color CBR with an opal bead), and proper aftercare instructions. I have a happy piercing that turns four next month! 

I think my daith is my favorite piercing, too. My rook is a temperamental brat who needs to go to anger management (I still love her, though)."
