Just a bit! 1200 a day is really, really hard, especially if you're super used to high calorie days. I'm worried you might get burnt out quickly. 

I started at 1500 calories in the beginning and slowly whittled down. I'm at about 1300 on sedentary days now, more on active days."

To combat this, I plan out what I'm going to eat and when first thing in the morning (and sometimes the night before because I have no life). I track everything. I drink a lot of water (so much water) and it certainly helps a lot.

You're going to have to accept that the first little bit is going to suck. You're rewiring your brain and body and it's going to take time (I'm still working on some kinks and I've been at this since April 2016). You're also going to have to accept that keeping this up is going to take some work once you get into a routine. Not a lot, but some.

Make sure you're eating a lot of healthy foods - stuff from the outside of the grocery store - most of the time. Make sure you're getting a balance of protein, carbs and fats. I find that when I have higher carb days I feel more hungry."

Also, I have an incentive to eat well and healthy this weekend - my trainer gave us some homework, if our goal is to lose weight. Record what we eat.

Your deficit has probably shrunk because your TDEE has gotten smaller. It's a fact of weight loss. Your options are to continue losing slowly, or decrease your intake further until you reach a loss rate that you're happy with."

SquaredCircle,fdr9jxs,t3_emrox2,1578681379.0,For a second I thought it was going to be one of his kids or something. This was a great moment to capture :)
xxfitness,fdr13ei,t3_emrxw8,1578678020.0,I love my Joe Fresh crops. Fun designs and POCKETS.
WWE,fdqwsgh,t3_emsb2h,1578676000.0,That's so far in advance you're not going to have much luck right now.
VictoriaBC,fdquetr,t1_fdqspit,1578675064.0,Also thought it might be this guy. Great minds think alike :)
loseit,fdpd91z,t1_fdp74h3,1578625692.0,"Tommaso Ciampa. He posts his workouts daily, for the most part."
loseit,fdos39j,t1_fdnpoog,1578611632.0,"I used to swim competitively, quit when I was 16 (I'm 33 now). Hard workouts four times a week. I could probably handle the warm up now."

running,fdok2dv,t3_embsa6,1578606726.0,Exercise definitely helps keep my anxiety at bay. Running is usually my drug of choice (solitary and I can listen to whatever music that makes me happy that day) but I also do fitness classes and practice martial arts.
VictoriaBC,fdo55mm,t1_fdlgqzr,1578599076.0,"That's my experience with Galaxy as well - I used their tool to figure out how much they would offer for my car if I traded it in (so I had an idea should I choose to trade up) and they spammed me with calls and text messages for a little while. It's tapered off now, mostly because I've stopped picking up (because they keep calling when I'm not able to take calls)."
fatlogic,fdntpg7,t1_fdntcb9,1578592634.0,"It was, and really tasty. That whole website has a bunch of really good egg-based recipes - since I'm vegetarian and my husband hates tofu, I need to get a little creative when I'm cooking for the both of us and don't want to make two separate meals (although he didn't eat any of this - on the one hand, makes me sad, on the other, more leftovers for me!)"
loseit,fdnobyt,t3_emb8on,1578589882.0,"The only thing IF does is limit your eating window. It's not a magic bullet to weight loss and it's still extremely easy to eat over your TDEE (I'm living proof of that).

Seriously. Start counting calories. Every single one. Get yourself a food scale and pick an app (I used LoseIt for a long time but switched to Cronometer a few months ago)."
loseit,fdnnyej,t1_fdlb3fn,1578589701.0,">Start at a slow pace, I've seen way too many quit because they expect to do an expert workout or what they use to do ""back-then"" on day 1; you won't and that's ok. Slow progress is the key.

Thiiiiis.

I had a friend who did a kickboxing class once. Once. She went balls to the wall all out at her first class after being a couch potato for a very long time, ended up vomiting and never went back."
