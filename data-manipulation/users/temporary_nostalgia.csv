Today I just looked like a bit of an idiot. I was letting the anxiety get to me, and someone mocked me for the way I sounded. They may not have meant to be rude, and I know it was my fault, I need to be better.

But the more I think about it, I think they were genuinely irritated by me. It triggers the same feeling I've had on and off for ages; which is not fitting. Being weird."

Hi papas

Have you considered talking to your doctor about what I've highlighted above? It might be worth it. I also suffer with overthinking and it may be worth talking to someone about how you feel. If you're anything like me, you might sometimes feel that a very small thing can seem like a big weight on you. Are there support services at college that you might be able to reach out to when the time comes?

I know how it can feel to send a text and not receive a reply right away, or to be not invited to things, it's happened to me. And I do my fair share of receiving texts and not responding; I tell myself that I'm just bad at keeping in touch with people :). I'm sure that you're not just a ""comic relief"" to them; and if you are, well, that's their problem and not yours."

depression,feurdux,t1_fes8mlp,1579389238.0,"I kind of felt like it would be so easy to pull myself out of this. Occasionally I get that feeling. I've heard from other people how you just have to get on with it, deal with it; I know so many others my age are probably dealing with life so much better and I feel... useless but I don't know why. 

I wondered if that really was depression, or just the way I am."
