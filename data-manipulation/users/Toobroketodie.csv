offmychest,fent1x3,t3_eq0mo8,1579290351.0,"My boyfriend and I have our own companies, we tend to think people with little to no experience are the best. You dont have to break old habits for one and most importantly you get to grow together as a company. Maybe it's because we are small bussiness but  both employee and I employer reap the benefits of getting someone who is hungry to learn and will also hopefully stay for the long haul as we continue to grow. Sucks more people arent that way."

offmychest,feluma6,t3_epttdz,1579231337.0,"Im a bussiness owner myself and I feel that everyday I wake up and I'm just swimming in an ocean trying to find land. No matter how much I swim it's always out of reach. I used to love thinking about dying, to feel nothing, to feel peace, but now that I found out I owe so much to the IRS the thought terrifies me . I dont want to leave 100k plus debt to my family. I feel so stuck and like I'll never find land...everyday I just swim, it's so exhausting,  I cant wait for it all to end but again I get anxiety thinking that way....i use drugs daily and am a highly functional drug addict....in the end be careful who you trust....I trusted my brother and yea.....but I feel you. Reading what you wrote made me feel less alone. Thank you"
