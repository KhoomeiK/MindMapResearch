AskTrumpSupporters,ff4e6q7,t1_felhd61,1579561490.0,"it has got to be see prescient, clear of mind and future-telling to know for a \*fact\* Trump did not commit crimes. Never knew it was so easy to determine political ramifications for beyond the scope of ones own clearly-written levels of power. 

Can I get next weeks winning lottery numbers? oh; and how much percentage does Trump win by in 2020 by an exact, precise amount? not gonna be convinced unless you can get it down within a margin of 10. It should be within a margin for 0, but 10 is being super generous. 

Also if anything else new comes about from any of this administration; even if it's completely 100% illegal (like a good number of things so far, has been); can I go ahead and assume they hid the info so as not to cause ""butthurt""?, i think the term is. Here's a super good question though:

If getting assistance via a foreign entity whether it be fabricated or real; is 100% a-ok for any presidential contender in the future yeah? Say, Sanders decides he wants an investigation into Trump right now, \*without providing evidence to our own US agencies\*, he is completely permitted to do it, right?

If a political opponent or; even someone sitting as president in the future, decides they want to hide any reach from congress itself into whether said opponent or President's actions, but ALL based on the idea that this contender or president has, themselves stated on national TV that they aren't to be trusted; it makes it all ok right? also legal, very legal. It makes the entire process that this person would go through; without having our agencies look into the matter, without any confirmation that anything illegal was done from our own research; the most powerful and paid for intelligence agencies in the world; be one of complete acceptance and to just assume it's all 100% legally followed through on? 

If so; I mean, sorry but there's going to be a candidate who will do that, that is not Trump and you guys will call for that person to be hanged. publicly, no less. So; yeah we notice the double standard (it's pretty clear, obvious and so on) and we notice the ""he didn't do anything wrong, he just blurred some lines, just not to far"" rhetoric. 

And none of us are buying it. We will not be voting Trump. Not that you guys should care really. I don't actually see why you bother talking about this with anyone; Trump is defacto correct (with no evidence and only his saying-so; like how he said his charity wasn't just another finance account for him. Oh! by the way; how's that charity going?). I will say this of Trump; I think given the position he is in; he \*wants\* to do right by people. Do I believe himself factually believes he committed no crimes? some yes, some no. It's clear there are some he is absolutely aware of and some where it's also clear he had no idea those would even be laws in the first place. Neither are discernible from each other considering his insisting nature of just saying everything was intentional and part of some master plan.

Problem is, his master plan is enriching himself and convincing people he's not doing all the things he is actually doing and that; it's the entirety of the other side that's specifically out to get him, and only him and only because they are ""butthurt"" or rather, ""triggered libs"". I promise you; actual litigators, professionals who have worked in these fields and even the white house for years; are completely understanding of the joke that is Trump; it's just really unfortunate that some great people out there got conned. 

And before anything is said about Obama and Biden: I hope for nearly ANYONE but Biden to win \*except Trump\*. I would go for Bill Weld over Biden if only to show republicans I have no deep hatred for republicans; i just have deep hatred for liars and thieves. Democrat and Republican alike; There have been Dem presidents who did jack shit compared to what they said they would (it is common, not knowing of exact ramifactions and protocol), but some democratic leaders were also horrible messes. Some weren't. Some Republican leaders (just not in the recent past) have been any good, with the Dem ones only being \*slightly\* less bad.

A liar is a liar, a thief a thief and an actual presidential person; a president. We do not have a good, or even acceptable president right now, and that is not unique to right now. Nor is it unique to 1 party over the other."
AskTrumpSupporters,ff225br,t1_ff1oisj,1579491759.0,"but wait a sec; it would be simply better to not respond to any subpoena at all then; since Trump can't be indicated as having plead the fifth or; numerous of the people subpoena's can't be indicated as having plead the fifth (since it 100% means you did the crime); then the real answer (as Trump has shown) is to not respond whatsoever and don't show.

There have been people subpoena'd by congress and didn't like it, but showed up. Plenty who have been vindicated, and plenty who have been proven to be wrong. But showing up means there's a chance you can plead the fifth; too: ergo admit to the crime.

So yes, we get it; we understand. If you don't show and you spin the entire thing as without having merit; you can ignore legal subpoena's because; if you;re better at getting your supporters riled up and at such a cranked-up volume; then you for sure can muddy the merit of subpoena's....

except that if you are subpoena'd by congress, you or I show up or we go away. But, since the clear answer is to question the merit and add the action of not-showing to be a virtue of proof for this very belief: it then becomes clear; following a legal subpoena is a fools errand. Can't be told you were hiding something if you simply question the whole process from the get-go and just not show up. If pleading the fifth equals guilt it's very very clear why Trump would never, in a zillion years; show up to any summons that would result in legal-ramifications and since impeachment \*does not include \*non-legal ramifications whatsoever\*: guess what that means?

No president should ever show up for any subpoena for any impeachment and; regardless of merit, if you are able to rile up your side enough to gain media traction and put the entire thing down as a broken system breaking and not acting legally; then of course it looks stupid to show up, let alone show up \*AND\* plead the fifth.

Why; you'd have to be a complete moron to show up to an impeachment subpoena as President; under any circumstances, even if you are in the right, you never gave the process itself any indication of it being real; or rather, you marketed it as not being real and sold it as believable."
AskTrumpSupporters,ff210dc,t1_felhd61,1579490913.0,Part of this I do not understand; a good number were subpoena'd and just did not show. Not showing up does not count as the other side not calling for you to show up.

So; Senate + President apparently wins against all other foes within its own system, so much more OP than any other combo that it seemingly is unfair one might say. One might also say the perpetrators and Senate all know this, they know all the shit they say is garbage and incorrect; but they learned the sleazy used car salesmen marketing tactics and just never stopped.

These tactics were so alluring to total and complete morons that they defend the one person who should actually never have had any chance at all to take the office in the first place.

Going forward; it can be assumed Republicans can be tricked and extremely easily. So it would suffice to say that the real solution (to at least corralling stupid) would be in denouncing a party overtly, having no ties to any man of this land! a real man/woman of independence with a pioneering spirit! but then discover ways to massively hide what you're actually doing, somehow make a channel to get word out to those who know you're lying and also support the things you actually stand for) for the purpose of creating the perfect mirage.

politics,fdpfoki,t3_emeboc,1578627413.0,"what kills me is; this should not be unexpected. And I don't mean that flippantly or in any kind of hyperbole; it's literally expected now.

And the reason is kills me is that I have had small conversations with an associate or two of mine and just talked what's going on in the world. Over time I discovered the way that we were able to actually connect on those points and agree, was to take the names out of everything and state things that should and should not happen. 

They wind up agreeing on at least 50% of the things, they just go much harder on immigration and stronger with a war budget because; and I have seen that this is a quintessential part of their entire structure; it's that anything else will cost us wars and lives, etc. That the world is so continually awful that; those at the top will do anything they can to stay put, break laws, etc......Just not if it involves Trump. They have a super soft spot because it seems that the entirety of ""says it like it is"" is literally their full and only point/purpose. Which \*actually means\*: ""telling it like it really is!....from the perspective of fear towards those who are different and concepts we do not fully understand"" which, the argument can be made of anyone, anywhere and of anything from any perspective that \*chooses\* as such.

It's that they themselves do not know much about how this all actually works, they just got super fucking ""lucky"" that Mitch is so excited to have his playground if blame pushing that ""it couldn't be illegal if they are all still there, there are checks and balances to that"" (from said coworker) they just are SUPER convinced Trump is NOT that guy.

Those who are smart enough to know; fucking shame on them and no one should debate them, under any circumstances. They are wasting your time on purpose. 

Basically they \*want\* to like Trump and yaknow how you reaaaaaally wanna like a slick new game that came out? but it's weak in nearly all aspects except this small little saving grace?

Sound about right you Trump supporting morons? or; rather, since it you are all so smart that none of this ""wasn't planned or; illegal in the first place"" care to tell us why; during the entire timeline that republicans had all 3 branches; why they didn't just re write a ton of stuff so none of this would have come up?

for real; i actually do want to know at some point, the reason behind that right there. If you guys wanted foreign help to be 100% legal, if you want a president to legally be able to circumvent all or any other branches in order to do a thing that they \*have had to go through the proper channels for this whole time\*; why on earth did you not push for these things to all be written in as law during that time?

Who would have stopped you? huh? Why have to deal with headlines that are annoying, right? like the impeachment and all that. Sure, it's a non factor to you guys because nothing has happened \*yet\* as a result of it; so your safety blanket is intact, but.....again, wouldn't it have done you well to not even have this type of thing even come up in the first place?

We've now seen that the democrats have been acting in good faith this entire time; there was nothing illegal or improper about the inquiry and its subsequent impeachment.....so they never went against United States precedent.....soooo you had a couple of solid years to prevent any of this from event being a problem.

so again; why didn't that happen? why; during the entirely of 2017, did they \*not\* write AND pass a bill stating ""outside foreign influence is acceptable because reasons like terrorism, safety, etc"". Why on earth did you guys not ALL stand up IMMEDIATELY in 2017 and state ""Yes, Trump can and should be able to ask the Ukraine specifically to help investigate Biden and to not use our own systems with which to do it""?

You had PLENTY of time; why did you not ask for this very specific thing? I mean, you're all brilliant and know best right? you guys know the law better than anyone.....I dunno, it sure sounds to me like none of you thought he would do that and then had to correct what you thought was acceptable as an on-the-fly thing; otherwise you might have to reconcile why your beliefs of the right and wrong nature of how these things go; is at complete odds with what Trump actually ended up doing.

Furthermore; why couldn't you all have stated ""it is not illegal to strike culture landmarks in times of war"" LONG before any of the current mess happened? again; you had plenty of time and must have known for \*sure\* he would be doing this. Afterall, you voted him in and he plays 4D chess, right?"
politics,fdg64j2,t3_el5ej9,1578381551.0,"so this opinion piece; written by someone who knows Democrats were intentionally \*not\* given info and that the \*reason\* Trump did not go through the proper channels is that; those proper channels would have decided no or; would have had the \*legally agreed upon separation of powers...yaknow? the very ones that we put there in place for exactly these reasons?\*.

So we have 2 reasons it would be ""acceptable"" to not bother with the legal channels that had been agreed upon by the very concept of our separation of powers and the law put in place to keep it this way. 

Those reasons are: ""takes to long, we gotta strike so we don't appear weak and so we maintain the upper hand"". and ""they will only say no because they have it out for him"".

Both of these reasons have no place in this discussion and if they have any self respect; they would wholeheartedly agree. 

We are talking about a President who openly tells foreign nations to do whatever the fuck they want to help him win; fuck anyone else even our own citizens and who now circumvents the constitution to assassinate a foreign official. And we are now talking about said person who will now officially (yes official; courts have ruled as per his own divine command) communicate real Presidential dictation about a real actual plan to target cultural sites.

Don't bother debating these clowns; any response aside from ""risking our nations safety for his distraction campaign \*as well as\* breaking the separation of powers and launching off of that into the stratosphere of committing a real war crime is what broke me, I can't vote for this"" is not worth going any further with anyone on.
