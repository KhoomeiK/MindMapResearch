Paranormal,ff26d4t,t1_ff1rgdj,1579495076.0,"Have felt that way a few times, otherwise it's just a heavy feeling and not wanting to be in the place or parts of it."
whatsthisbug,fezkm8n,t3_eqwegh,1579458309.0,Is that a parasite on the parasite?
offmychest,fezcyza,t3_eqwcv8,1579456035.0,Very well done! It is their fear talking. Always spread your wings and fly toward your life and away from them.
peopleofwalmart,feza1pv,t3_eqvqky,1579455205.0,The whole argument in one place. Whew. Just mental illness or is meth involved too? !
Paranormal,fez8wg2,t3_eqw5mc,1579454937.0,Oh yeah. Some buildings give off strange vibes that I don't like and as an avid antiquer there are things I've avoided because they felt bad and things I've bought because they felt good. I get the same sort of sense with people as well. I have learned to pay real attention when it comes to people for sure. I trust that instinct whenever it kicks in and it's been verifiably accurate often enough to convince me it is real. People generate energy and create realities which can persist long after they do I think.
homestead,feyw1j8,t3_eqw7pq,1579451144.0,"My hens come running from where ever when they see me. It makes me laugh evey time. They look like victorian ladies holding up their skirts  racing towards me with their silly rolling run.  They are generally rewarded well for the effort! Now I want more critters thank you! Your influence is terrible, lol."

RedditForGrownups,fec974d,t3_eo93w2,1578968879.0,"I see myself in some of this but damn, at 66 I have doing great until recently. I  just lost the man I loved who was 15 years my junior to a really crappy rare disease and that has done some damage both emotionally and physically. I ended up with AFIB in the last few weeks of his life. Surely from a broken heart. That is what sucks the most about getting older, outliving the people you shouldn't have and then trudging on  inspite of it."
relationship_advice,fdflljv,t3_eku797,1578364538.0,"My dearest friend just lost his battle with ALS. He had online friends all over the world and let them know from the get go what was going on. Their support, love and friendship meant the world to him over the last year. I am so glad that you have decided to share your struggle. They will grieve yes, but they love you and that is the most important thing there is. I wish you the best as you move forward ino whatever is ahead for you."

Permaculture,fddy9kk,t3_ekne3n,1578326897.0,"My heart goes out to you and your country. Having experienced a massively destructive wildfire in my little rural California town in the early 2000's  I have deep empathy. The will of nature  to overcome and your love of the land you care for will help the healing. Seeing life come back where you would never think it could is awesome. Just don't be too sure about the demise of those !%#* weeds. Those devils have a perverse ability to return and thrive, lol."
somethingimade,fcu41a8,t3_eirpp4,1577972006.0,Love the change. Makes a much more appealing space!
DiWHY,fcf1rlp,t3_eh4x45,1577625851.0,That is so creepy. I can't even.

animalsdoingstuff,fc7o4b1,t3_eglab7,1577514037.0,I would really like to know those creatures better.  Very cool critter it seems like.
UnsentLetters,fc72fo2,t3_egcy80,1577495740.0,You did well. Your kindness was sincere and will be remembered. We should all opt for kindness and a sincere compliment is kind.
gardening,fc4o92w,t1_fc31nc6,1577422647.0,I have never seen much difference between the two. It may just be that it got reclassified for some reason or another. Botanists seem to do that as time goes on and science becomes better. Confuses the heck out of me sometimes.
exscientology,fc438bc,t1_fc3umcz,1577405461.0,Narconon is a Scientology thing. I am a recovering scientologist from back when it pretty much was formed.

science,fc2lp1u,t3_efldql,1577366224.0,"Having moved from an area with a diverse  population where I had people of my choosing  as friends with whom to intereact and share a wide range of interests and ideas to a very rural, highly religious and conservative population area where  there is virtually no one with whom I have any desire to interact beyond a superficial level I think this is a very correct conclusion.  It hasn't been the best for me mentally. Also note that I am an introvert who enjoys solitude more than most, so for me to feel this as profoundly as I have has been  surprising to me."
aww,fc0h1gy,t3_efcbpp,1577290670.0,What a lovely thing to do!
terrariums,fbwvmw8,t3_ees3la,1577160641.0,That is lovely!
whatsthisplant,fbdt0vv,t3_ect9hj,1576770662.0,Just bought one yesterday. I had one from the dollar store for years before I had to move and leave  it behind due to size. I Hope they like it where I am now. I know I will have to move it in and out seasonally here but oh well. Loved the last one.
