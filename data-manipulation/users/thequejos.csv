HumansBeingBros,ff4fj8i,t3_erj5sb,1579562392.0,I live near a no-kill rescue shelter. It always amazes me how many people go in to 'save' an animal only to return in 3 months later. They are surprised that the pet isn't automatically affectionate (read grateful) and house trained. This video shows the time and patience needed to to 'bond with an animal for life'.  Shelters need to show these kind of videos to the prospective owners and have some training conversations as well.

dogs,fdtmdjs,t3_en21kr,1578718855.0,"I used to live among orange groves. People would dump their older family dogs as soon as they started to develop any kind of health ailment. These dogs would hide among the trees until hunger and thirst drove them to seek out our house and cars.  One little guy had a small tumor on his stomach. He was trying to sit up and beg, lay down, and basically do all his known tricks just to get us to love him. He was obviously someone's family pet that they did not want to deal with now that he wasn't a cute little puppy. Lived with us for 3 years.
