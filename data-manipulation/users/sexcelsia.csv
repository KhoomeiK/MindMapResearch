Chonkers,ff08wjb,t1_feyl6x8,1579466450.0,"Hijacking to make sure you have all the right information. Struvite crystalluria is very common in cats and can be just a random finding, i.e. it doesn’t always lead to urolith formation. That being said, if it did form a urolith then it could have contributed to the blockage. Stress is also a very common factor in urinary tract obstructions. UTIs are a common factor. And sometimes cats are just unlucky enough where they get random a urethral spasm that causes them to block. Switching the diet can help with the struvites, but sometimes these specialised diets can lead to the formation of other types of stones instead. It’s rare, but it happens. Once a cat blocks once they are more prone to it happening again, so even if you switch the diet, you have got to remain vigilant. Try to minimise stress levels if you can. Make sure he has nice places to nap and cozy places to hide. There should be 2 litter boxes per cat in your household and be good about keeping them clean. Being overweight is always unhelpful, so make sure he gets on a diet and sticks to it. I know you’ve had lots of people commenting “this worked for my cat,” etc etc, but please remember that your cat is not their cat. Talk to your veterinarian about treatment options and make your own decisions about what is best for you and your cat. God speed. Xx"
