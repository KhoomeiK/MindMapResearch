You’re doing everything right. Even though it hurts. It’s good you know your worth, and know (and stand for) how you want to be treated."
AskGaybrosOver30,ffg8cup,t3_etdyc3,1579900656.0,"It’s hard but, did you ever tell him how you felt about him? Could you?

Maybe you have the closure you need. And, maybe like all the others said... it’s just done and time to move on. But if someone flirts constantly and texts “sweet dreams” every night, there’s a care that’s deeper than even best friends, I would think. 

Regardless, it’s a process. And it sounds like a grieving process. I’m just glad you feel lighter."
MenSkincare,ff4wffg,t1_ff4drzy,1579574072.0,"I’d advise you stick with the Roc if you’re fairly young. You can talk to a dermatologist about Retin-A /tretinoin. If you’re 27+, get on Retin-A and don’t stop, unless you have touchy skin, in which case, the Roc is where you’ll want to stay if it’s working"

It’s like... “your wife doesn’t have eyes? She can’t see the blood all over you?”

So confusing

AskGaybrosOver30,fevsvof,t3_eofs65,1579401040.0,"It’s as much self-defeating madness as wanting someone to not call you blonde when you are, indeed, blonde. 

Pick up a word from another language, soften it in a cloak of descriptors that aren’t a single word, but at the end of the day, you’re one of us. And whether you call yourself “gay” “straight” “homo” “beautiful duckling”, it doesn’t matter. You are ______ as much as you’re human. 

They’re just words. They only matter if you get hung up on them."

AskGaybrosOver30,febx9jp,t3_eo8s7f,1578963800.0,"35 here. Have been in multiple types of therapy, for multiple lengths of time. And it’s hard to find a truly good therapist. 

There is no right or wrong way to feel, no matter what’s going on with you, that’s what’s going on. 

These frustrations you have with your therapist, bring them up. Work them out with your therapist. Don’t let the trauma around the family dictate your relationship with a care provider who may have your best interest at heart, but may also be just falling short. 

When we don’t get what we need in relationships, we learn to not ask. Then to cut ties, move on, and the other person never knows why. And we’re left with things feeling unresolved (I’m speaking from my own experience here). 

Give this therapist a chance to hear you out before moving on. It will help you both, no matter what you decide in the end."

AskGaybrosOver30,fdf034s,t3_ekwyn1,1578350291.0,"1. Kindergarten. A peer had a box of candy and he would give you a piece (boy or girl) if you showed him your “down-belows”. We played this game as a group, and I remember being more interested in what the boys had going on. 
2. Summer camp. Age 8. Open shower. I remember seeing my camp counselor and being attracted. And before that, I wanted to be “friends” with him, but not like the other boys. I was jealous when he was playing sports with the other boys or just being bros with them. I would sit on the sideline (in my round glasses and husky pants and gap in my teeth) and be jealous lol"
AskGaybrosOver30,fdex452,t3_ekwob0,1578348440.0,"There are a couple or people who come to mind. 

I got a text this morning that a 65-ish guy I knew died. Of what, I don’t know. But after a lot of aggressive texting/emailing, I had quit responding a while back. I was tired of feeling bad and being projected onto by him. I care for this guy, but he couldn’t be in my life. Because, frankly, I couldn’t take care of myself and be healthy while participating in his own actings out. 

The same goes for earlier this week. I got a call that a college friend of mine died in a car wreck. Like me, he suffered from substance abuse issues and family problems. He tried to get help multiple times but could never get there, get stable, sort out his relationships. I’m not sure if he was sober when he died, but I hope it was a painless death. I remember a call a while ago when I was listening to him rant about how the world was against him...I just felt “I can’t do this anymore. I won’t do this anymore. I value myself and being of service to others too much.”

It’s always sad when someone leaves our lives. But I’ve learned that all I owe the world is to take care of myself first, and not be a burden on others. If I start to become a burden on myself because of someone else, it’s likely the case that I need to walk away."
