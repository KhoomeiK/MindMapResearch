AskReddit,ffa6j5h,t1_ff9relx,1579728848.0,"A combination of marketing and the rise of collector culture. The idea that something cheap could become more valuable over time was a pretty new concept and some companies were more than willing to capitalize on that. They would specifically market their products as collectible and people would gobble them up with the expectation that they would become more valuable. 

What they didn't take into account was that the reason people spend so much on collectables is their scarcity. It's simple supply and demand. Since everyone and their mom had a box of Beanie Babies in their basement there's more than enough supply to meet the ever dwindling demand.

There are still some that are worth a good amount but that's usually because they have an extra foot or some other one-of-a-kind factory defect."

funny,ff5gk9q,t1_ff59yia,1579591916.0,Now wait just a damn minute. I'm from Philly. Are you telling me we're no longer the reigning champions of asshole sports fans? Well this simply will not do. I guess we're just going to have to crank up that dickhead dial to 11 and start chucking drunk babies at the other teams. We'll see who's the bigger asshole then.

Sometimes things are done not because they are practical but because they're entertaining."
WTF,ff2b9ei,t3_er84hq,1579499440.0,How is this even remotely WTF worthy?
