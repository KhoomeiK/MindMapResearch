As for my comment what was the context?  Was it two doctors taking an appendix out for no reason?  Am I  pro-appendicitis and suggesting people should not have their appendix removed if needed?  Nope, none of that as there is virtual no context. 

It was just a joke to pass the time on s social platform.  You just decided to Don Quixote in to fight a fictitious argument you created in your mind.  Great job!"
