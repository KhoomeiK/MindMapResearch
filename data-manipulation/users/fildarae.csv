Paid for VIP passes to meet them and everything and Vince was offended when I was more excited to meet Nikki than him. I was a teenage girl at the time, didn’t snub Vince or anything - even said hi to him first - was just more excited about Nikki because I’d read his books etc. 

He didn’t smile for our photo because of it. (Nikki was fantastic though, easily my best experience meeting a band member)."

And oh man I didn’t know that about the author. Personally I’m struggling with a lot of the language, not out of difficulty but (as I’ve seen reviewers put it) like she wrote the whole thing clutching a thesaurus. I gave the benefit of the doubt figuring it suited the narrator but now that I’ve heard that, it’s making it a bit more annoying.

But the world would be a much better place if people who weren’t suited to raise children would realise that. Then again, 99.9% of us in this sub wouldn’t be here, I guess."
raisedbynarcissists,fcu3jr8,t1_fcp64km,1577971541.0,"I rewatched the movie when I was half way through the book just so I could have a fair comparison, and I think the movie is definitely skewed more in favour of the mother/has much more of a middle ground - especially in the very early years. It has the upside of not showing her inner dialogue which is where she’s at her most judgemental and awful in general, but there are also minor changes like when she slaps him in the book it’s a proper slap, but in the movie it’s more of a “batting his hand away” type thing - so the movie gives more of an impression of “she’s finding small things to blame herself with in hindsight”.

I think what also helps is that the book has an easier time of setting her up as an unreliable narrator, especially with the letter format, whereas that’s trickier in movies unless you’re gonna go full Black Swan/Joker etc. but that’s much harder to do with Narcissism than with full on hallucinations and delusions. 

Don’t get me wrong, as he gets older and he becomes much more obviously sociopathic it gets easier to see how he’s just an absolute shit, but in the earlier stages of his life (up until he’s around 6 and starts tormenting kids at his kindergarten), a lot of the stuff she gets so outraged about and insists is on purpose genuinely does read to me like typical kid stuff. Kind of like if a person gets a puppy and then gets pissed off that it’s more interested in chewing the furniture than bringing them the paper, yknow?"
raisedbynarcissists,fcu3445,t1_fcp3bse,1577971108.0,"Firstly I’m sorry you had to deal with that over the holidays, it must’ve been absolutely exhausting. 

I’d be more than happy to message you with a link if/when I write a proper thing on it!

And honestly yeah - not so much triggering in the sense of upsetting, but the more I read her POV the more I’m gritting my teeth, and groaning over how insufferable this woman is. Not even so much in relation to her son but just how condescending and superior she always seem to act while mixing it with “everybody thinks I’m AWFUL, they’re probably RIGHT *50 more pages of her being judgemental to everybody around her*. It’s honestly like being in the head of my NMother. Like 10% through I started taking photos of pages that show her being awful. I’m now like 50% in and I have almost 30 photos so far. 

I ended up rewatching the movie and even the bit where she slaps him is changed just to batting his hand away, not a full blown slap across the face. But the movie also definitely has the limitation of not showing her inner dialogue, which is where she’s at her most pretentious."

AmItheAsshole,fcni3kf,t3_ei3eco,1577812163.0,"NTA. Listen, OP, as somebody who has been in your position more than once - these people are not your friends. It’s better to be in your own company than bad company. Don’t allow them to continue to treat you like crap by showing up.

YouOnLifetime,fcn7rqu,t1_fcn7enl,1577805478.0,"I wouldn’t struggle to believe that at all honestly - it’s just whenever I watch a show I’m always coming up with mad theories of what they’re setting up to happen (perk and burden of also being a writer) so I never can tell when it’s intentional and when it’s just me trying too hard to cling to details and work out the twists before the show reveals them.

I’m definitely leaning towards intentional in this case the more I think on it, though - in one of the first episodes when Forty mentions that the manager is an ex-dealer, I think that was an intentional move to make the viewer associate him with the victims being drugged. Although, again, probably just stating the obvious with this one."

raisedbynarcissists,fckj6ci,t3_ehn00f,1577726492.0,"Honestly people who don’t listen to you are self centred idiots who don’t want to face the truth - if it’s not abuse they don’t have to feel like shitty people for not stepping in and stopping it. So they can continue to “keep the peace” and have an easy life and not feel guilty about it. 

If/when you decide to go no contact, please remember every time they refuse to help you. Then when the ones who side with you go “I always knew that (abuser) was trouble!” You can hit back with “did you? That’s strange. That’s not what you said when I came to you for help and you said ______.”

For years after I went NC I had an aunt who would think it was “helpful” to constantly tell me how much worse my brother had it compared to me. Even my brother would roll his eyes at her and tell her to stop. Like a shitty parent is a shitty parent, it’s not a contest for who had it worse."

So I did, I got back, changed into pyjamas, and settled in for a Fallout 4 session before I studied. Within an hour my phone is going CRAZY with family members from up north calling me non stop. They usually text me first so I know something’s up - especially when my brother then calls, as he never has his phone switched on.

Whereas with many people from this forum, if we don’t accept this treatment from our own parents, there aren’t many we WILL accept it from. It’s not quite worth that they’ve put us through, and the loss of the love that we deserved, but it’s a small silver lining."
confidence,fcb28qx,t3_egskdx,1577581322.0,"I have very similar issues! What really helped me was properly looking at the people around me - on the bus, in a cafe, whatever, and finding minor flaws. I don’t mean this in a judgemental way, but there’s always something like “her eyeliner is a little smudged”, “her ponytail isn’t perfect”, “his coat is a bit too big”but whatever it is I always realise that it really doesn’t make me think less of the person, or even think they’re unattractive, it just doesn’t matter. They didn’t have to have a perfectly done full face of makeup and hair styled on a professional level to leave the house, and neither do I. Odds are people think the same way when they see you - and if they’re the type who does judge their opinion doesn’t matter anyway.
