Homebuilding,ffybpr6,t3_evp8ks,1580342630.0,"Generally speaking, in warm climates you don't find basements, while in cold climates you do.  Soil in a cold climate freezes in winter, causing shifts that can make a traditional foundation tilt.  If code requires you to dig 4 feet down to build a foundation anyway, the logic has been, may as well dig an extra 4 feet and get a basement for storage.  This can be appreciably cheaper than a second story... But generally a second story is cheaper if you don't need to excavate at all, and are allowed to build slab on grade.

Because we have been so unusual in a rural & suburban housing boom, with severe restrictions on redevelopment of existing built areas, because we have put such a huge subsidy into long term homeownership, and because consumer expectations about the size of a house have grown so much, the American fashion has turned to developing every last square foot of a house into habitable space.  Traditional basements were built in such a way that most of them leak a bit in storms, most are fairly cold, and the most are fairly damp with condensation.  That does not fly in a finished basement.  A bunch of different details have to be perfectly implemented in a durable way to make a finished basement that has a tolerably low level of moisture during a 10-year rain event.  These details require additional expenses and additional  attention.  Doing it *right* is often more expensive than a second story.

Generally speaking, a finished walkout basement makes a bit more sense to build both in terms of market value and in terms of moisture management, than a finished flat-ground cellar basement."

Note you can talk about deflection of the floor joists between supporting walls, and also deflection of the subfloor sheathing between floor joists perpendicular to that.  In this conversation we're talking about the latter.

The tile industry groups want L/720 to call the tile install correct.  The building code specs L/360 minimum under a customary loading (40psf?) for most habitable floors.

It seems that 1/4"" is ""higher strength"" only in the sense that it will bend a great deal before snapping in half.  A tile install mounted on 1/4"" without support underneath will fail long before the 1/4"" fails.  People use them for floor only because they are very evenly supported under their full span by a thick layer of plywood that reduces deflection.  On walls there is typically no rigid element underneath, they're asked to span 16 inch or 24 inch between studs all on their own.  This means that even though walls are a substantially less demanding application in terms of the direction and magnitude of the forces, they don't recommend using quarter inch on walls because quarter-inch has almost no rigidity of its own."

It's possibly the closest we've got (I also like the math on launch lasers & star wisps) to interstellar tech, but it's a napkin sketch (or rather, several napkin sketches using fundamentally different ideas at fundamentally different scales), not a technology.

Even if you assumed a civilizational effort to develop and build such a technology, there's no reason whatsoever to build it to achieve a 1G burn.   The mission listed suggests 10 days of 1G burn followed by 133 years of coasting, for a flyby mission to the nearest star;  Change that to 5 days at 1G + thousands of years of coasting + 5 days at 1G for an arrival mission (not going to even bother doing the actual acceleration math here).  Building to higher accelerations  \_dramatically multiplies your mass\_, and thus it costs you delta V / drops your payload, and it costs you money.  The only good reasons for high thrust would be to reach LEO (and we're doing this pretty effectively with chemical rockets) or for an Oberth effect maneuver, and these probably wouldn't have much impact on a shorter-duration interstellar mission at all.

Fission fragment rockets are possibly an improvement on Orion for a practical interstellar probe using known nuclear physics (they certainly scale down better), but they're very low-thrust devices."
spacex,ffs8yxo,t1_ffs5ahi,1580176063.0,">Constant thrust between Earth and Mars is 100% achievable in the long term with drive tech we can already conceive of, but can't yet build. [The engine list on Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php) serves as a fairly good guide for high-end propulsion systems that should be able to do the job.

Nope.  Read a little bit more about any one of those.  Nothing even remotely feasible to sustain 1G over the sort of timespans we're talking about (where the Internet community speculates about burns as a sort of convenience feature necessary to achieve 1G comfort;  The way most people think about it is as if a spacecraft would burn one way and then other way to achieve 1G while station-keeping, because burns in a torchship are 'free').

Why?

Because every time you double your specific impulse without changing the mass flow, you double your thrust but you quadruple your energy expenditure.  MV of inertia versus MV\^2 of kinetic energy of the exhaust.  To achieve 1000x the specific impulse, you need 1,000,000x the energy per second (power).  The Roci achieves 1000x the specific impulse of our best nuclear thermal rocket designs, and so its engines must draw 1,000,000 times as much power per unit of mass flow.  Doubling your powerplant tends to double the \*mass\* of your powerplant, slowing you down.  So to achieve that 1,000,000x specific impulse with engines that produce 1,000x as much thrust, you need to increase the mass of your powerplant by a factor of 1,000,000.  This reduces the feasible thrust to weight ratio to 0.1% of what it was.  I'm handwaving away the actual mechanics of the thruster;  Those problems are not needed in order to make a torchship unworkable.

In vacuum, for the sort of power levels we're discussing, you can't \*even\* double the power generation by doubling the mass of the power generation, because power generation is never 100% efficient, and heat in a given generation scheme is generated proportional to the third power of size, but heat is \*dissipated\* proportional only to the second.  To double the size of a large electric generator (of arbitrary type) in a vacuum, you need to increase the mass by \*more\* than 100%."

The Rocinante's reactor would generate enough power to replace the combined electrical grid of 2020 Earth 44 times over.  Everything involved in that reactor would need to dissipate waste heat, and it would not be small.  Dissipating waste heat in space requires enormous amounts of mass and surface area, because you can only do it via thermal radiation.

People say ""We did it once, with nuclear physics;  Nuclear weapons are such an insane improvement on bows and arrows, and we should expect that in the future we'll find another improvement of that order which makes nuclear weapons look as impotent as bows and arrows"".  There's no suggestion in our models of physics to indicate that this is true.  If it were true... we would expect the first accident involving these new physics to end life on Earth, right on the spot.  Pointing your engines at the target to decelerate would instantly sterilize it out to a range of thousands of kilometers.

Notably, it's not even a ""Well once we build a big enough fusion reactor"" kind of problem!  The amount of power involved in a long-duration burn is a lot less important in a spacecraft than the power to weight ratio of the equipment necessary to create that burn.  In the Expanse, manned ships are limited by the G-tolerance of human crews, meaning you should be able to generate 10-20G's from that propulsion section PLUS the rest of the ship, or probably more like 50-100G's from the propulsion section itself.  A miniaturized submarine nuclear reactor's power stack is something like 10 tons per megawatt;  achieving the Roci's thrust would require a blob of them the size of a comet, and \*that wouldn't even work\*, because they'd need surface area to disperse waste heat...."

>In 1900, just under 40 percent of the total US population lived on farms, and 60 percent lived in rural areas. Today, the respective figures are only about 1 percent and 20 percent.   
>  
>The United States had between six and seven million farms from 1910 to 1940 (figure 1). A sharp decline in the number of farms occurred from the 1940s to the 1980s. At the same time, the average farm size more than doubled, from about 150 acres to around 450 acres. 

We populated the countryside when farms required fully manual labor.  We've automated away nearly all of those jobs by now with a variety of farm machinery, but the towns and houses we built to hold that massive labor force remain, simply because we've created a system where real estate is very expensive to abandon when it becomes useless, and new housing is very difficult to build in places where it is useful, and transportation is irrationally inexpensive.

Absent their primary employer, the economy of rural areas could not survive.  Today, the federal government spends a couple dollars in rural counties for every dollar of tax revenue it extracts from rural counties, whereas it extracts a couple dollars of tax revenue from cities for every dollar it spends there.  This monetary life support comes in the form of infrastructure projects, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and various primarily family-oriented welfare systems.  There's still trade going on to a limited extent, because every dollar that leaks out of their economy through fuel use, imported goods and foods, and Walmart's profit margin is replaced by a steady influx of this money from the government.

It's also kept afloat by people working in the cities who are willing to drive three hours out of their way in order to ""pay low housing costs"", or from another perspective to salvage the waste product of housing built in the middle of nowhere.  If we're to deal with climate change, this sort of stuff has got to stop.  Driving needs to occur far fewer hours of our week, however normal it feels today to sit on the freeway going 75mph in a two ton vehicle as a punctuation of every life activity.

What happens if we don't see this steady influx?  You get what happened to Greece.  You get a now-lower-productivity economy that shares a currency with a now-higher-productivity economy, and has no answer to what happens when all of its dollars end up in the pockets of its neighbor.

If you're a professional, you want a hood and external forced air.  Tightly fitted N95 masks, N100 masks, and respirators have so much filter obstruction that they're \*hard to breath through\*, and preclude aerobic activities... and a hood doesn't require a tight fit

But most people have never tightly fitted any of these.  They're putting the cheap nuisance dust masks on their face and the masks aren't sealing, which makes them easy to breath through largely ineffective for small particulates.

What they help with is reducing the number of large droplets that escape your mouth when you cough, reducing the chance that you're infecting others.  With a disease that's only marginally infectious, or if everybody is wearing the masks prophylactically, this can help a lot."

Rigidity is less relevant for floor installs, because you are expected to start out with a thick subfloor;  1/4"" is considered acceptable because over top of this subfloor you do not require much rigidity, and because 1/4"" is cheaper, lighter, and more evenly matches the height of finish flooring in a typical install."

This is a bizarre belief;  Possibly it is also a bizarre fact.  Could we explore the validity of this a little bit more?

Rigidity increases with the third power of thickness, as a rule.  Something that's 2x as thick and made of the same uniform material is naturally 8x as stiff (flexes 1/8th as much under the same load).  Durock is probably not a uniform material;  Probably it's a stressed-skin composite sandwich of fiberglass, cement, and fillers.  Even so: it would be difficult (probably costly?) to make something 10.5x as stiff as the base material would be, by adding some sort of reinforcement.

The media widely mis-paraphrased Gabbard, then issued a whopper of a correction 2 days later.

While I dislike them both at this juncture, I don't think Clinton made any extreme jumps here.  Calling Jill Stein an asset its probably an exaggeration, but her campaign was investigated for collusion because the Russians were found to be manipulating things in her favor.  Gabbard's politics became downright weird, and she very clearly started pitching Fox News audiences and talking points, while they started pitching her (along with a prominently visible trollfarm campaign).  By the debates it seemed obvious that she was setting up for a third party run."

China has never had the sort of individualist privacy-orientation that exists in the West, and there are strong, durable psychological differences between Western peoples and Chinese in terms of how willing they are to submit to authority and group consensus.  For better and for worse.  This is seen as a goodnatured attempt to improve social harmony in a crowded world, and any coincidental resemblance to a system designed for detecting and suppressing dissent would be a cynical outlier interpretation.

Homebuilding,ff4rwz7,t1_ff4p55l,1579570978.0,"When Jesture4 says 'a larger gap at the bottom of a door vs a transfer grill above the door', they're referring to a ventilation strategy.  The gap in his hypothesis is being used as an air pathway, which means they only have to install one duct per room, for a return or a supply vent, and then they can rely on one big one of the opposite type to cover the whole floor at the end of the hallway.  The 'transfer grill' at the top would just be a pathway for air to flow past the door, if there wasn't a gap.

It's a very common way to cheap out on HVAC, because otherwise you would need two ducts per room, for both a return and a supply vent.

Even if the intention wasn't to cheap out...  Industry-wide, there is a general lack of coordination between builders/framers and HVAC techs.  You will find many house plans being committed to without any mention of how ventilation is supposed to work.  The expectation is that the HVAC guys just sort of create space magically, or that framers will already have the money and be off the site by the time the HVAC guys get to it, and so the HVAC guys will be blamed for all those incongruous ceiling stepdowns and wall cutouts.
