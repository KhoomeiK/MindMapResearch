SelfAwarewolves,fffukiq,t1_ffejry5,1579892117.0,"The most hilarious part of your reply is you assume I'm ""you folks"", as if it's impossible to take no part in ridiculous partisan america.  I've lived in rural & urban areas in several different places.  Almost all of my gay friends were from rural areas and none of them were ""disowned"" by their parents.  For most it was a non-issue.  The fact that reddit feels inclined to downvote a simple observation that conservative leaning families with a gay child won't disown them because their fragile worldview musn't be shattered by someone on the internet painting this fire and brimstone picture of what happens to ALL gay people from conservative families.

  

The more accurate picture that should be painted is that RELIGIOUS families are much, much more prone to disown their gay kids."
SelfAwarewolves,ffcia5d,t1_ffb7qeh,1579800050.0,"How the fuck am I wrong or harmful pointing out that the majority of conservative people aren’t sending their fucking kids to pray the gay away camp?  Do you people leave your house and travel anywhere, ever?"

SelfAwarewolves,ff9uk0a,t1_ff9bng0,1579721692.0,"Wow, really?  Pretty sure I know a few gay men from conservative backgrounds that have about the same coming out story as anyone else...
  
EDIT: fucking LOOOOL downvote away, god forbid anyone that leans conservative in a voting booth be cool with homosexuality."

rareinsults,ff4g1eq,t3_erichx,1579562732.0,"You know, I find Ben to be kind of whiney and annoying and I’m not conservative, but I watched the joe rogan episode with him and I respect him for what he is.  I don’t agree with him on most everything political, but he just seems like he’s an alright guy, especially compared to vast majority of conservative voices out there.
  
I think he sabotages his palatability by being a little too argumentative and coming off like he’s ambushing people he’s arguing with instead of appealing to the other side and finding common ground."
