Wow, we got really fucked up there for awhile, glad you got it together.

You didn't work in video games, you didn't graduate college, and what exactly are you doing with our life?

Oh, you work at a haunted house and you work with kids?  That first one is cool but kids?  Seriously?  When did we start liking kids?

Well high five on gaming though.  No adult to tell us what to do on that anymore.  Now we can stay up all night and.... Netflix?  You Netflix as much as you game?  More sometimes?

I think 13 year old me would be very confused about how our life turned out thus far."

If she's still younger, I've seen kids work at haunted houses if their parent is on the property.  Last October I was chased by a 10 year old!

She's incredibly talented.  We will watch her career with great intrest."

Showerthoughts,feqlei3,t1_feqb0ei,1579343199.0,"I'm in a 3 bedroom with two guys I didn't know beforehand because the previous college apartment I was in started renovations under new management.  One guy is cool and pays his rent and bills and then other constantly pays rent late and under pays on bills.

I don't have my associates degree yet so that limits my options.  My current job pays me $10/hr and I have a seasonal job right before the holidays that pays $8/hr.  I'm only ""independent"" because my grandparents help me but that lifeline is about to be cut this summer.  Last year was the first year in my life (I'm 27) where I made enough money in a year to be taxed.  I was kinda excited until I found out that Amazon paid less taxes than me.

It's a struggle to survive here in DFW if you don't have a fancy college education and even then, I know people who have to consistently scrape by.  Like I know other places are more expensive, I meet a TON of folks from California, but if wages don't come up then prices MUST come down.  It's absolute insanity that I can work a full time job and then 60+ hours a week for two months and I still struggle.

And heaven forbid I get sick and then I have doctor bills.  Oh wait, I work with kids and while I love my job and it's fantastic, kids are basically a walking taking plague of bacteria and viruses ready to jump your immune system the moment it falters.

It's too expensive to live my guys and gals.  Far too expensive."
Showerthoughts,feq6fi6,t1_fepxmpf,1579338179.0,I live in Plano which is just north of Dallas.  It's definitely not cheap here.  You gotta get like.... an hour away from DFW to find more reasonable prices.

SeriousConversation,fejn00k,t3_epfh98,1579180342.0,"I can't offer much in the way of the bureaucratic mess getting a proper diagnosis and treatment is but I can maybe help with this bit.

I have Schizoaffective Disorder ,basically schizophrenia with a mood disorder where my emotions can rapidly swing.  Most of this is inside my skull and only when it's REALLY bad (thanks to therapy) does my body language give away I'm having an episode.  Though there was a period of time in my early 20s when this combined with my PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome made life VERY difficult.  My waking hours were driven by anxiety and depression but I was terrified of sleeping because I had constant nightmares.  I got like 4 hours of sleep a night for a long time.

Bit with a few friends I'm accountable to, therapy, and a free support group I was referred to, I've improved SO much!  I no longer see being Schizoaffective as a disability, just a weird perk I have in life.  I joke about it, self manage myself very well (usually), and no I have so little drama in my life the last couple of years I'm only ever triggered into an episode by my own memories.

I wish I could show you how much more confident you'll be down the road.  To be really cliche here, we're so obsessed with the destination we give up on the journey there that builds us to that point in time.

As for others?  We can't control them or their thoughts.  Think of life as a hula hoop.  Some people might be really good at it but even the best of us drop it.  If we can't control something as simple as a hula hoop, then what hope do we have for control over others?  Just be you, be honest with yourself and others, and learn to love yourself.  Learning to love myself was the hardest challenge I've ever had to face.  But there has been no greater prize either.

Stellaris,fe6ncak,t3_envylz,1578896884.0,"I've found many fallen empires to be quite dumb.  One declared war on me awhile ago and we're neighbors though a choke point.

Long story short I sniped his transports, built a miltary space fortress with the snare upgrade and put it on said system choke point.  He spent the next 70 years in a ""war"" with me because the A.I. was too dumb to move his 260K powered fleet back two systems because the station I built stopped all his transports.  Everytime they emergency jumped it was back to their own system where they'd come back and get snared again.

I literally kept this up until I was able to conquer my neighbors plus an unawakened fallen empires so I could get around to the otherside of their empire where I could take one planet and they scrambled back to play defense.  Then I just ping-ponged my much smaller fleets on either side of them taking a couple of planets before I had enough war score to make them defeated.  Now they're down to two outposts and their home planet.  They won't be able to afford their fleet so overtime it'll get smaller and more manageable.

Also, if the enemy fleet is gonna catch you, sacrifice a few ships and transport for them to chase while your main fleet gets away.  Send your distraction across the system while everyone else jumps.

TLDR:  Enemy fleets are typically very dumb and scattering your forces into/around their Empire is the best strategy if you can't out doom stack them."

I'm not what most Texan girls look for so.... yeah.  I've been single for 8 years this month.

That being said, all three of my ex's were met online.

Runescape 2006.  We dated over the summer (She lived in Nebraska) but it wasn't anything serious.  Literally one of our online friends asked if we were dating and she said we were which was news to me.  She broke up with me via email and then another email 10min later telling me about her new boyfriend who had the same name as me.


Halo 3 in 2009.  The healthiest relationship of the three, we were together about a year and a half.  She lived in Canada and had already graduated and I was still in high school.  We broke up because of maturity differences and the distance.  It was a mutual breakup but it still hurt.


Facebook Roleplay Group 2011.  This was my ""crazy ex.""  Half Hispanic and half Irish.  She had two moods, pissed off and turned on.  There wasn't an off button for either.  We had both just started college at a community place.  She wanted me to go visit her in Indiana but I had no car, no money, and no job.  When we both got back from classes she'd want a report on my day including any and every female I talked to and why.  She was paranoid about me cheating on her.  We'd fight about it, calm down, do our homework/play games, she got in the mood and we had lots of.... Skype time, then eventually she'd fall asleep with Skype on and we'd repeat the next day.  She did a lot of psychological shit to me but we never went to bed angry at each other.  That was our one rule.  I broke up with her after 5 and a half months and we continued to be complicated for another year and a half before she cut contact.

Bonus:  I met a Scottish gal on Facebook Roleplay after I broke up with the crazy ex and we were very complicated for the next 5 and a half years.  We never officially dated but I did enable her to cheat on her abusive (now ex) boyfriend with me.  We don't talk anymore which is my choice and she has a kid now.  Her mom still really likes me to the point she's said she wishes I was her son-in-law.  So I guess I got that.  Her mom has been one.... the only? adult adult role model that has stuck around in my adult life for me.

I still use Tinder and FB Dating but.... yeah.  I'm not hopeful.  No more long distance stuff."
