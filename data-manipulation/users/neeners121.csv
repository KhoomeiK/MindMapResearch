aww,fej76ax,t3_epfk2m,1579159739.0,"Last year I rescued a little chihuahua that had spent 8 years outside in the wind, snow, and heat.  Never mind the horrific loneliness.  I cannot fathom the discomfort.  I now adore pampering her, especially in winter.  Big fluffy bed with a heating pad.  A heated blanket on the sofa during the day.  Even when the house is warm she burrows under the blanket.  Clean water.  Hugs, kisses, scratches and massages.  She is extremely grateful, and lovable.  I will never understand the ignorance, and inhumanity,  a human being can be capable of.  Please, just treat your animals EXACTLY the way you want to be treated - no exceptions."

aww,fca6wax,t1_fc838w3,1577563946.0,"Thank you thank you!  It scared me.  I have been involved in animal rescue a long time. You would have a hard time believing what I have actually seen people do to animals.  I love Reddit for the love and care people are showing their animals, but even Reddit can be distressing.  A few weeks ago someone was showing off their dog who looked very uncomfortable having to live in a doghouse outside, but clearly in the photo by the dog was a bowl of filthy water only about an inch deep.  It was just heartbreaking.  Noone is commenting, possibly out of fear.  I say let's try to teach each other."
