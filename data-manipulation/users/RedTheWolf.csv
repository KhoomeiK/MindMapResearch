You're right with your point about letting yourself shine through - I think what a lot of folk don't realise is that it's not necessarily important what you are interested in, just that you have a genuine passion for it. The passion is the attractive part.

My SO loves computer games and watching wrestling and while I have no interest in those things, seeing him be so happy to be in his hobby world makes me happy. Similarly, he indulges my interests in cryptozoology and homebrewing, without those being his interests. We both shine with our passion for our own geeky things :-)"
