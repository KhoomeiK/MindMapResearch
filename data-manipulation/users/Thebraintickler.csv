skiing,ffgqgbn,t3_etgxa0,1579912449.0,"I think this is a corrupted image, but people do actually take out skis like this for old school races.  Skis used to be super long, and some people attempt to keep the history alive by holding events with people skiing on them.  I've never seen them practically at a resort or anything. 

They also predate any real alpine skiing history, I'm talking using a single pole to attempt to navigate the sierras for mail delivery stuff, or even back to scandinavia."
AskAnAmerican,ffgft0x,t1_fffkaaq,1579905262.0,"san Jose, Berkeley and Oakland get notable recognition, IMO."
AskAnAmerican,fffw6hn,t1_ffdhdrg,1579893130.0,"If you go inland in California you are going to find some real interesting Trump people, that might compare with places like Kentucky or Alabama.  They also hate LA and SF just the same.  

But overall, yes, California is much more center than most assume, not center enough to really vote republican, especially these days,  we saw the OC republicans get strangled out in 2018,  but there is a lot of money and NIMBYism in California, which leads to more conservative ideals, in a traditional sense.  

Hell, even when I lived in ""liberal have"" Berkeley, it wasn't much different than any other town.  Maybe a little more extreme on some ends, but that's largely due to the university, which wasn't out of line with most other university environments i've been to, and is largely led by recently liberated freshmen/sophmores.  Upergraduate and graduate students are much more centrist and realistic.  You'll see bigger swings in things concerning science and government funding though, because that's where these people make their money."
skiing,fffvlfk,t1_fffv5f4,1579892759.0,I feel like treewells are more of a PNW issue.  You have a lot of avalanches (even inbounds) in the rockies though.
skiing,fffuucw,t1_fffrpa1,1579892287.0,"It totally is that, the saying just comes from skiing with equally abled friends and just snaking a friends line as a total jerk and then saying ""no friends on a powder day"".  The realistic vs. sarcastic isn't very strong with the saying, it's more of a joke  that's gone too far and gotten out of context."
skiing,fffqib9,t3_etdr3x,1579889607.0,"People get the quote wrong quite a bit.  The sentimate has more to do with resprect for others than skiing alone.  Most of us are not stupid enough enough ski alone on a deep day, but we are greedy pricks and will snake a 'friends' line right in front of him.  Hence the saying."
news,ffctfvi,t1_ffcixl1,1579806903.0,"If she's a wealthy socialite then she probably has expensive interests.  Driving submarines, like airplanes,  might be one of hers.  

Just say'n."

nonononoyes,ffcg9w2,t1_ffcfwdk,1579798817.0,"Weirdly things like pugs and bull dogs are the most surf-inclined surf dogs I have met, one would bark at people until they pushed him into another wave, and wouldn't get off the board (not for fear, but wanted to go again).  I've had a lot of dogs, none of them being super water loving myself, despite me giving them lots of options, so I never pushed them that way, despite them being much more capable in the water.  My malinois I have right now loves the ocean and the surf, but freaks out when she can't really touch, she lots runing out itnto the white water and ""body surfing"" back in, all on her own, she just does't like it when it gets too deep.  So it's definately kind of a dog dependendent thing."
nonononoyes,ffcfkja,t1_ffbzogk,1579798387.0,"Probably the case, but i have seen a lot of dogs that really liked it to not consider it an 'abusive' activity for the dog (codittions depennding).  I surf a lot and see a lot of surfing dogs, someone them can't get enough."

Bear and summit are closer, and baldy is super close if it has snow, but mammoth is the only real place to ski. It’s like a 5hour drive so flying is worth it in my opinion, especially if you aren’t transporting skis."
