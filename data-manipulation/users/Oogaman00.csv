todayilearned,fdb0qay,t1_fdaxm0p,1578252395.0,Special interest groups have nothing to do with academic Publications. You don't need a special interest group to recognize that when you are incentivized only for positive and sexy results it's no wonder that the most sexy results will be biased towards not being the most rigorous

politics,fcy3sex,t1_fcwhipi,1578074409.0,"That doesn't even ask about property tax, just a high tax state. And when I put in 150k-200k combined income, married, in high tax state, it comes out to zero cut. 150k is nothing as a combined salary in NY, DC, SF, etc. 

I don't know why you think you need to be wealthy to own ""expensive"" real estate. Property values are through the roof. Little old ladies own apartments now worth 600k. My parents small house in Long Island is worth 500k+on Zillow (and was more before Sandy). My dad is a retired govt employee and mom is a nurse. Not exactly big dick billionaires."

politics,fcvvh66,t1_fcvpycl,1578011020.0,That tax cap applies to a good amount of middle class folk in any high cost of living area. It also isn't only a cap on property is also on state income taxes I thought
nfl,fcvt9fo,t1_fcvt481,1578009592.0,He obviously is not a pro bowler at this time but he's obviously a competent starter. He's proudly in the top half of starters. Even if he has a much lower ceiling you aren't dumping a young Andy Dalton type for some random crap shoot in the middle of the draft
nfl,fcvt481,t1_fcvasm7,1578009500.0,He definitely never passed for many yards but isn't that just the Colts offense? Especially with no Wayne or Ebron for half the year?
nfl,fcv7whk,t1_fcv539h,1577996490.0,"I mean maybe ""very solid"". But 90 qb rating, great TD to int ratio, and essentially no real wr to throw to. The Oline also took a big step back"

cars,fc337mu,t3_ctinn2,1577380383.0,"Opinion on pantera tire brand? My local shop is selling Pantera A/A Touring tires at a great price, never heard of them but they have 500AA rating with pretty good reviews from the few that exist (see specs and some reviews here:  https://simpletire.com/pantera-p165-65r14-107567-tires ) 

It seems like this brand is some sort of collaboration: https://panteratire.com/about-pantera/

Anyone know anything about this brand or specific tire?

I am also considering Kelly (major brand offshoot) but these were both cheaper and seemed better in specs"
