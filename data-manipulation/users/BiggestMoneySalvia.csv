Just up and didn't text people for a couple weeks. It helps to be able to have fun alone, try to exercise or watch movies/docus, I always feel more satisfied after a good movie or summin than after a ton of youtube. Anything small and fun, don't set high standards for being alone. Sadly part of the key to happiness is pretty much just lowering your standards and trying to be as happy as you can be with what you've got. You've just got to settle."

depression,femjtzl,t3_epiyby,1579259231.0,"There's a way to cope? The more I think about it even in happy phases killing myself still seems like the best option. The only things that make me ""happy"" (weed and psychedelics) aren't accepted and I don't have personality outside of them but its a useless personality, because all my friends over took it and still have actual personality. I used to be the drug guy and now I'm not even that anymore. Not like the people I thought friends want to trip with me which has made me feel even worse lately. And studying just doesn't make me happy only sometimes, but in the end whats the point. It's not like having a job is ever gonna make me happy because having a fun job is never going to happen. And besides all that I'm always too scared to do anything even go to theatre ""what if the movie sucks? I'll have wasted my time"" everything feels like a waste of time except for wasting my time. I do nothing for myself except drugs because I have nothing i want to do for myself. So what's the point I know it's not gonna get better and I hate myself but that's besides the point because I hate myself for not just being normal so that can't be fixed. I really just want to kill myself because I never wanted to be born in the first place. Sometimes people say my ""thing"" is ""not liking anything"" and then I only think you're right I should kill myself. I go to school but it always feels like a waste of time because in the end the risk is too big. I don't have a guarantee that I'll get a job or like job, I dont have any talent and I just can't get myself to read anything to invest myself into something even if it is drugs I just cant... i grow weed and I want it to be a good grow but I can't be fucked to try and make it better I just want cheap and easy suppression. Having fun is never anything more than an attempt to drown out live for a moment because afterwards you just go back to shit."
