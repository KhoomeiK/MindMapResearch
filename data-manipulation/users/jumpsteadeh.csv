WritingPrompts,ff8f7ng,t3_es63tj,1579675893.0,"  The forgotten third brother Purgo, Eternal Steward of the In-Between finds himself dozing off in the middle of his shift where he manages the front desk of the infinite white void of purgatory. Whilst his brothers Satan and God rule their respective afterlives, Purgo rules the place between. Ironically, Purgo finds himself in a purgatory all his own, as the centuries tick away with nary a visitor. Purgo's day has been as it had always been - uneventful with not a *single* customer to process. You see, Hell considers extra waiting to be free untaxed torment on its denizens, while Heaven has implemented a multi-queue system that virtually eliminates long lines. Purgatory has, simply put, become obsolete. Nevertheless, Purgo's only purpose is to manage his eldritch plane of existence, whose lack of content apparently reinforces the Purgatory ""corporate culture"" of minimalism and emergent experience. When the desk's small wooden clock hits noon, a tiny bell rings, informing Purgo of the start of his lunch period. Purgo shuffles his  papers from one unlabeled stack onto another, and takes his suitcase with him in a non-direction of the infinite white void. Intent on eating his lunch in-transit, Purgo lines himself up where he thinks a platform might be, and waits for a train elemental to capture him. A gloved hand scoops up the deity's shirt collar, dragging him along the slick floor by the posterior of his pants. While still sliding, Purgo unbuckles his briefcase to find a single tomato sandwich, which he disinterestedly gnaws on, attempting to ascertain some level of flavor or texture from the indescribably bland sandwich. ""Purgatory would be Hell,"" says Purgo, ""if it wasn't for you, ethereal transportation ghost-thing."" The elemental didn't respond. After an uncertain amount of time, Purgo places his - now, wet - sandwich back in his briefcase and prepares to disembark. The disembodied hand releases Purgo as it arrives back at his desk, where he sits down and gets back to work organizing blank pages into unlabeled folders for another eternity."

This is not for your homies, but rather for the *risky swap*. Your hat is stifling, and you wipe the sweat from your brow as you discard your hot ass headpiece. With a flourish, you pull the bottom-most wine bottle and replace it with the bottle of Coca Cola, which looks ever the more refreshing now that you realize it's eternally inaccessible.  
  
As you look down at your hands to inspect your prize, you notice ripples in the soda puddle at your feet, and when you look up, you see two giant red eyes staring through your soul! The pile of wine splits in twain as its gaping maw opens for the first time in a thousand years, a long wet tongue flapping from its spiky mouth to the floor below. The load bearing bricks strain as the monster stands with its scaled and clawed feet,  its muscular legs straining to break from its concrete prison. As the entire cavern begins to roar and crumble, you ignore the chill rising from your spine and turn to run!"
