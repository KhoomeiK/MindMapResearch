unpopularopinion,ff94b3q,t3_esajvh,1579704511.0,That's very comforting to me because I'm fat and my face always looks like the niagara falls when I'm at it. Especially when doing cardio.
unpopularopinion,ff6xpbc,t1_ff6xmqi,1579637034.0,Yeah I knew what you were referring too. Points for you.
brandonsanderson,ff620bc,t1_ff5koiw,1579617115.0,I've read a little more since I've made the post and it's becoming a little more enjoyable to me. I just think high fantasy isn't my favourite because it's so over the top at times.
unpopularopinion,ff40wk2,t1_ff40t1r,1579553128.0,Sorry I'm not a native speaker so typos still happen sometimes.
sex,ff2mhee,t1_ff2mezz,1579513286.0,Okay. Thanks for the input.
therapy,ff1rycv,t1_ff1rsl1,1579484851.0,I would say no to every question but thanks for the input.
therapy,ff1p6v7,t1_ff1owbs,1579483090.0,I don't see it as disturbing but as taking responsibility of your actions. But thanks for the recommendation.
unpopularopinion,ff1kj3z,t1_ff1k4w9,1579480665.0,Doesn't change the aspect of it giving something back to you and not only living inside you.
unpopularopinion,ff1ilnt,t1_ff1if6d,1579479797.0,It's your kid. It will provide a return beyond massurenent in the future.
sex,ff1fipw,t1_ff0o2bp,1579478423.0,But is I'm not ready to do X because I can't say I'm ready to face any outcome it may have no matter what the odds so extreme in your opinion?
unpopularopinion,ff1emz9,t1_ff12qy5,1579478231.0,I strongly have to disagree. A parasite is a organism that is in dependence of another orgasm  for existence or support without making a useful or adequate return an I think that is realls untrue for a fetus and what it's later becoming. Many parasites even caught the hosts death just by living in it so I don't see that many resemblense at all between the two terms. You'll also find very few people referre to a fetus as a parasite. The fast majority is going to say it's a baby. It's still a human being.
sex,ff1dds5,t1_ff0pn39,1579477753.0,"But isn't it something different to say only have sex if you want to reproduce or only have sex if you're okay with case X may become you reality no matter how unrealistic it sounds. I would say I didn't support the first statement, while you described the latter or am I wrong?"
unpopularopinion,ff0j739,t1_ff0j2nk,1579469388.0,Thanks.
unpopularopinion,ff0iv8g,t1_ff0i3q3,1579469274.0,Everyone is free to have his own opinion on that but I just think that it would be irresponsible of me to have sex knowing I can't care for a possible child. But I totally respect your opinion.
unpopularopinion,ff0i5yo,t1_ff0hx1n,1579469117.0,Sorry but I think refering to a fetus as a parasite is fundamentally wrong.
therapy,ff071lc,t1_ff05whw,1579465847.0,"I also thought it was a bit of a strech hence why I asked. The only thing I know about OCD is that I've watched the Aviator if that means anything to you. Also the case shown there is maybe a bit extreme.

I don't know. I still have a hard time seeing that those ideas could bring me to dark places. Like I said it my post where is there a problem when I still enjoy those things as far as I can say?"
unpopularopinion,fezxha8,t1_fezxa80,1579462966.0,I totally respect your opinion but that's where we partly disagree.
unpopularopinion,fezvl5u,t1_fezvcxs,1579462225.0,But how could you say it's nobodys fault? The persons that had sex made the decision to do so or am I wrong?
unpopularopinion,fezv2ag,t1_fezuw2n,1579462031.0,Yeah true. But I just don't think it's fair to the child to not take responsibility if it happens against all odds.
unpopularopinion,fezuo6w,t1_fezufcv,1579461886.0,I don't know. I just think that's a overestimation. It's important but not life threatening for person to not have it.
unpopularopinion,fezu72y,t1_fezu3n3,1579461708.0,But it's not like air or water. I wouldn't say you depend on it.
unpopularopinion,fezu0cu,t1_feztuax,1579461641.0,I think there are enough virgins no matter how old that would say need is a little overestimated.
unpopularopinion,fezo06z,t1_feznwtv,1579459516.0,Why?
unpopularopinion,feznj6p,t1_fezn99t,1579459355.0,But if both becoming parents want to have children you don't need the two to begin with. Or the abortion at least.
unpopularopinion,fezmrq1,t1_fezmkit,1579459101.0,But I would say I'm more against there being unwanted children to begin with then anything else.
unpopularopinion,fezmawb,t1_fezm4nf,1579458943.0,Why anti-children? I just think parents should take responsibility.
unpopularopinion,fezki4t,t1_fezkb4v,1579458264.0,Or live the monk life.
unpopularopinion,fezes0s,t1_fezdcet,1579456561.0,Okay if I'm honest I only googled that numbers some time ago and it seems they are not always correct. But in the end you couldn't say birth control works all the times as far as I'm concerned.
unpopularopinion,fezccjc,t1_fezc5fj,1579455908.0,Okay so I was maybe misinformed there so thanks for that.
unpopularopinion,fezafy6,t1_fez9ssg,1579455339.0,"Oh okay. I thought it was short for something obvious I missed. 

I think that's where we fundamentally disagree but I totally respect your opinion. The only cases where I would agree that statement woule be if the child was a result of rape."
unpopularopinion,fez9pbw,t1_fez8yeo,1579455088.0,Sorry I'm not a native speaker and don't know what pst action means. Could you enlighten me?
unpopularopinion,fez91jj,t1_fez8r7z,1579454975.0,I would partly agree. I just think just because you  aren't married you can't be a good parent. But it would definitely help.
unpopularopinion,fez8ih1,t1_fez6dmm,1579454812.0,"As far as I know the success rate for condoms lies around 98% and for the pill around 99,8%. So I would say hugly most of the time."
unpopularopinion,fez87ze,t1_fez7irz,1579454716.0,I'm against abortion so that's why I personally don't see another option than having it. But that's something everybody has to decide for himself.
unpopularopinion,fez7ww5,t1_fez7ptr,1579454612.0,No I don't.
unpopularopinion,fez72u7,t1_fez6e2v,1579454426.0,I don't say you can't have sex just for pleasure. I think it's really important for a healthy relationship. But if someone gets pragnent against all odds you shouldn't run away from it.
unpopularopinion,fez6m3t,t1_fez61m7,1579454331.0,I think merriage can be a really important thing. For you as a person but also for possible children. But I wouldn't say that that's the only environment a child can have a good chance to grow up in. So I don't really care about that as long as the parents do everything they can to make sure their child grows up in a healthy way.
unpopularopinion,fez5xs6,t1_fez5uls,1579454108.0,In a way yeah.
Fantasy,feu5grn,t1_feu50we,1579383327.0,Thanks for the input. I will maybe try to do that more.
Fantasy,feu02dy,t1_fetzsv0,1579381783.0,That's great to hear. I should maybe try that as well. Sadly I don't know anyone that reads but that's why we have reddit to give us recommendations. I wish you a lot of fun.
Fantasy,fetse8p,t1_fetrwx3,1579379492.0,"I actually read the Martian. It was an okay book in my opinion but nothing I really loved. 

I think I've heard of the First Law and Gentleman Bastard series before and somebody else already mentioned David Gemmell. I will see if I will check them out. Thanks for mentioning them."
Fantasy,fetrric,t1_fetrlqa,1579379141.0,I wish I could agree with you but it's great that you loved that book so much.
Fantasy,fetrbhy,t1_fetqvaw,1579378817.0,You're probably right. Thanks for the recommendation. I will maybe check them out.
Fantasy,fetr6nq,t1_fetr0e8,1579378718.0,Yeah I'm totally aware that it makes no sense. It's a unrational fear to some extend.
Fantasy,fetr2hm,t1_fetql58,1579378635.0,Yeah I would mostly agree with that. I mean I don't want to take the fun from the a book for anybody so if the people in this sub love them then that's more than okay.
Fantasy,fetodvp,t1_fetnz59,1579377584.0,Yeah I already thought about reading some classic and romantic books. I think I will still finish the book because I don't like having unfinished books lying around. I just never had this motivation problem so far.
Fantasy,feto3jc,t1_fetnc5j,1579377466.0,I don't know how far you've read them but I enjoyed the first two to some extend. I think Sanderson just has a problem with writing compelling characters over a long story only judging his work with Stormlight. I was really hooked at the beginning but I slowly lose interest in the most of them. I also think his prose is mediocre at best. It works but I can't read another 'Storms!' or 'Damnation!' for the love of god.
Fantasy,fetlcrd,t1_fetl2lf,1579376542.0,Yeah I was already thinking about switching to something more grounded if that's the correct term. I just never had that motivation problem so far. Thanks for the recommendations.
Fantasy,fetkqff,t1_fetk4wc,1579376387.0,Yeah that's probably right. I just always feel bad for leaving a by so many beloved series behind for some time because I always think that I'm missing out on something if I don't do. But that's my problem.
Fantasy,fetk3f8,t1_fetj0he,1579376224.0,"I've read Robin Hobbs Farseer Trilogy and the Liveship Traders, George R. R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire, Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles and the Hobbit by Tolkin. I enjoyed them all with the exception of the Hobbit which I found a bit boring. I also read the first two Stormlight books and enjoyed them. Especialls The Way of Kings. Maybe it's me but I feel like the series is getting worser."
Fantasy,fethr7h,t1_fethih9,1579375595.0,I missed mentioning I've read the first 2 books before so I'm aware of that.
Fantasy,fethgkd,t1_feth612,1579375520.0,I read some comic books but I think they aren't really my cup of tea when it comes to media. Thanks for the book tips though. Never heard of them so far.
brandonsanderson,feslvik,t1_feskwi3,1579366602.0,Yeah I probably have the wrong mindset sometimes but like I mentioned I always feel bad leaving something behind while so many people praise it so much. I should probably work on that.
brandonsanderson,fery1zl,t1_ferxkt4,1579359492.0,I think I'm always afraid of missing out on stuff or being ignorant when I don't keep on reading or watching something I at parts don't enjoy.
brandonsanderson,fer2mh1,t1_fer29dp,1579348940.0,I tried listening to audiobooks some weeks ago to see if it's something for me but I don't think it works for me. I like reading far more as it allows me to pay more attention to everything. But thanks for the input.
brandonsanderson,fepxp3q,t1_fephmdu,1579334251.0,Will check then out. Thanks.
brandonsanderson,fepxms6,t1_fepvb5b,1579334187.0,Thanks for the recommendation. Will check it out.
brandonsanderson,feood0j,t1_feonx2i,1579302992.0,"That's another topic but I think I'm one of the rare people that really liked the second season on the range. It seems like it's one of the most disliked ones by many others. Just came to mind.

Yeah I don't know. I don't like having unfinished books lying around so I will probably bring myself to finishing it some way and see where it goes from there."
brandonsanderson,feon6xp,t1_feomdi5,1579302533.0,"I feel you with The Walking Dead even though I never got back to it. And maybe but I feel like there are so many books that I still want to read so I maybe won't do that for a while. 

No this is the first book series of his I'm reading. 

I would say I mostly read fantasy. I've read Song of Ice and Fire. Both books from the Kingkiller Chronicles. I finished reading the first witcher books some weeks ago. And Robin Hobb like I mentioned. I enjoyed them all to some extend, but I still think they all had a bunch of problems that held me back from really loving them. The only series that so far let me oversee all the flaws is The Dark Tower by Stephen King but you can't put it directly into Fantasy in my opinion. He mixed a lot of genres in that one."
brandonsanderson,feolkgp,t1_feoksxb,1579301888.0,"Mhh tricky. Loved is maybe a bit far streched but I really like Robin Hobb. I've only read The Farseer Triology and The Liveship Traders but I really like how she writes her characters. I also like her worldbuilding. I don't know why but I'm caught myself thinking about those books for more often than about others. But I still think they aren't perfect. I think I like that they are more grounded in a sense.

It's just weird to me that I've these problems now after reading more than 2000 pages on this story and even really enjoying some parts you know?"
dating_advice,fdypag4,t1_fdymg9h,1578782163.0,Thanks for the advice.
dating_advice,fdyk5fq,t1_fdyjhhh,1578780644.0,I know what you mean. I would still like to make her feel better you know?
dating_advice,fdy4kq2,t1_fdy4ebf,1578776080.0,"Yeah sure you shouldn't overdo it. Otherwise it loses meaning. 

Thanks and I will do."
dating_advice,fdy46kw,t1_fdy41qd,1578775932.0,That's pretty good.
selfimprovement,fdkunim,t1_fdkkrqj,1578511507.0,I watched some and I really likes the idea to use resistance as a guide to fight prognostication so I already got something out of it. Thanks for the tip.
sex,fdkdswm,t1_fdkca8c,1578501746.0,Sounds awful. To clarify I was talking about cuddle where both parties are absolutely okay with that is going on and I think that's what cames through in my post. I can only tell you that that's not how it's supposed to go and I hope you make better experiences soon.
sex,fdjneld,t1_fdj26so,1578479362.0,Oh than I misunderstand it. Fake News from me. Sorry to u/YT_Sharkyevno.
sex,fdindnn,t1_fdin6rc,1578446774.0,Oh okay. Well I hope for the best for you two so you continue to get the best out of it.
sex,fdimmm1,t1_fdimh81,1578446292.0,Oh man that sounds kinda dissapointing. Maybe try to talk about it with her? I feel like you both could benefit from it.
sex,fdikfrw,t1_fdikbno,1578444891.0,That's really sweet of you. Everybody needs it.
sex,fdij8xh,t1_fdij713,1578444146.0,Indeed.
GaybrosGoneWild,fd1ppp2,t1_fd1pnfh,1578134869.0,Thanks
witcher,fd0wctr,t1_fd0vyw4,1578124654.0,"I actually not only had a problem with Yennefer but Geralt as well when it comes to the romantic stuff. But I get what you're saying.

And I will look out for that."
witcher,fd0tkam,t1_fd0sqoy,1578123567.0,"I actually prefer character driven stories over action driven ones. That chapter just only annoyed me, was hard to read and made it really hard to get behind the characters emotionally. At least for me. But it sure sounds like I will enjoy the other stuff more."
witcher,fd043vn,t1_fd03k4j,1578113338.0,That's good to hear. I just had big problems with the romantic stuff so far because I didn't enjoyed any of it so far. It's also really against anything what I would want in my romantic life why I have a hard time sympathizing with them in any way. I just needed to rant a bit and get a view how that part of the story continues and that's what I received.
witcher,fd03anx,t1_fd02mh5,1578113000.0,"My problem is that it comes off to me like they just are into each other hence why they directly sleep with each other at the end of The Last Wish. I just would have loved to have a bit more than that. But I get that thats the point. The people into each other but still struggling. It's just super annoying and exhausting for me to read that, hence my frustrazion with it."
witcher,fd029a5,t1_fd027hh,1578112573.0,I have already.
witcher,fd001i0,t1_fczzyfw,1578111579.0,I'm currently reading them as I said in my post. I wanted to get the whole picture.
witcher,fczw6ch,t1_fczvmgj,1578109650.0,Yeah I get totally why it's that way. It's just hard to sit through it. It's like reading a bad teenager love story at times even though thats the point.
witcher,fczpib0,t1_fczpdkv,1578106297.0,I will see.
witcher,fczo5wa,t1_fcznydi,1578105514.0,I will see how much I like the rest of Sword of Destiny. I just don't like wasting time with reading the 'wrong' books while not having time for the books that I enjoy more.
witcher,fczmx3k,t1_fczmiy5,1578104726.0,Maybe I should see it more as what it is and not include my own views. I guess I keep reading for a time and see if it gets better or if I should better leave the series.
witcher,fczlptd,t1_fczlckh,1578103972.0,Yeah I get that but that's exacly my problem. I just have a problem with people cheating in real life and wouldn't tollerate that at all in my personal life so I think that's the source of my disliking for them.
witcher,fczlazn,t1_fczk6ux,1578103718.0,I also played Witcher 3 and thought they were fine together even though I still couldn't get behind those two completly. That's why I'm reading the books because I was hoping to understand those two more. But there is still hope if you say it gets better. Thanks for the info.
witcher,fczkwve,t1_fczk8ha,1578103475.0,Yeah that's mostly my problem so far. Would be nice if they were a little more easy going.
witcher,fczkl5c,t1_fczk2tq,1578103269.0,It's just hard to get behind them so far or really to care about them.
witcher,fczkfg1,t1_fczk8op,1578103174.0,I was asking if the rest is filled with that much drama and not saying all the books are. Would be impossible to say if I didn't read them so far.
selfimprovement,fctxkkv,t1_fctxgg2,1577964609.0,Totally agree.
selfimprovement,fctxdfq,t1_fctxbqk,1577964335.0,Oh yeah for sure. Sleep is super important. I was kinda sloppy the last year about it.
selfimprovement,fctt87j,t1_fctt3y8,1577958291.0,Thanks for the advice and the best for you as well.
selfimprovement,fctkaow,t1_fct9sqe,1577946334.0,Thank you!
selfimprovement,fctk7p9,t1_fct8v8z,1577946241.0,I will look it up! Thanks for the tip!
selfimprovement,fct141i,t1_fct104x,1577930158.0,Thank you very much!
selfimprovement,fcstxeh,t1_fcss9bb,1577925014.0,"Wow. I don't know what to say other than that's really sweet of you to say. I didn't participate that it would resonate with somebody that much. 

Funny enough that you mentioned hiking. I really like doing it myself, but sadly don't know anyone to do it with. 

I wish you a great year and I'm sure you can achieve anything you want."
selfimprovement,fcsbzz4,t1_fcsb1eb,1577914413.0,That's a great perspective to look at it. Thanks for the nice words.
normalnudes,fcrcnfa,t1_fcrckwp,1577900037.0,Thank you very much!
normalnudes,fcqat3a,t1_fcqaqdm,1577882335.0,Thank you very much and same to you!
normalnudes,fcoxtec,t1_fcoxruj,1577844549.0,Thank you.
seduction,fcjyogq,t1_fcjyh1u,1577710762.0,I'm trying to be but still need to gain experience with it. I read Models by Mark Manson wich is recommended a lot on this sub and it helped me with the mindset that is needed for it a bit.
seduction,fcjye73,t1_fcjy6qi,1577710432.0,Yeah maybe I'm a bit overreacting. We both never had a relationship. I don't know with her but I was even never on a date in my life so we're both inexperienced. Like I said it just was a complete mood killer for me and I didn't know how to act on it.
