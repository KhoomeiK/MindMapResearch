gaming,ffqg8ss,t1_ffq5tfx,1580133696.0,"Kerbal Space Program was great early access, then with every update it got even better. Space Engineers too, especially once planets came out (for me at least).  
I think one of the big keys is mod support, if you're going to be in pre-release for a few years give players the ability to do their own thing, at least for the crafting ones."
gaming,ffqfwwk,t1_ffqc300,1580133413.0,"I think I'd disagree, I bought it early release and loved it. I may not play it anymore, but I definitely count it as one of the best ten bucks I ever spent."
AskReddit,ffi9g13,t1_ffhoket,1579968489.0,"I'd argue it all depends on the movie for the ""good"" bit. If I'm watching a more fantasy, over the top action type sci-fi like Star Trek or Star Wars I want the noises, something more realistic, or at least harder sci-fi I want it silent. 2001 was the first sci-fi I ever saw with silent space scenes and I thought they were great, but imagining a big space battle in silence just seems meh."
AskReddit,ffi96l7,t1_ffhmkuc,1579968308.0,"Or that weapons need to be cocked multiple times.  
I don't know a whole lot about guns, just what I've picked up from a gunnut friend the one time he took me shooting, but I'm pretty sure if you have to cock your gun multiple times without reloading something is very wrong with it and you shouldn't be trusting it in a firefight."
AskReddit,ffi8s17,t1_ffhnlcv,1579968021.0,"tack onto that being knocked out not being dangerous. Character gets hit in the head and wakes up two hours later? Yeah, they've got so much brain damage at that point they'll probably never live a normal life again."
AskReddit,ffi8kij,t1_ffhmmuy,1579967873.0,"Although this one is a problem I just like to pretend the characters have ADD.

AskHistorians,ffgaede,t1_ffg7qnw,1579901912.0,Given that at least two or three cities hit 100k it's interesting to think of that many people gathered in one place living in homes like that.

It's probably going to be amazing, if not from the company then from  modders, it has so much potential it hurts, but right now I'd say no. 
I love the inventory system, I love the aiming system (mostly) I love that you can send out multiple squads at once.  
I hate the lack of balance, the lack of individual characters (like the chatter between NPCs between missions) the cost of units, the fact that heavy armor is the worst armor for the heavy class (and other balance issues) and that to add difficulty to enemies they just kick up the armor, and not slowly either, they just go from being 1 hit to not being able to do damage to them. And I REALLY hate unit customizations, the colors suck, and the faces are marginally better then Oblivion, and the hair looks like bastardizations of the Beetles. 

Everything I hate is fixable, so I expect it to get better"

funny,ffdaoow,t1_ffd96dn,1579816776.0,"Very extreme, we'll call the cops if there's an active situation going on, for example a few years ago someone was going through different banks driving across the state cashing fraudulent checks. We had their descriptions, the appearance of the checks, and a REALLY obvious path they were taking (they were following a major highway) the tellers called the cops when they showed up at their branch, and rightly so."

AskReddit,ffa975r,t1_ff7fake,1579730334.0,"Aw man, I always LOVED classes like that. I'm not unintelligent, I'm good at learning and comprehending, but I absolutely hate homework. My favorite class in college was a history class (well three, I took them all with the same prof, she was wonderful) the entire class grade was based on one test, one paper, and two quizzes. On top of that the prof was super chill with students she saw paying attention, and had a wonderful, albeit dry, sense of humor, and we once had a conversation full of Monty Python references in the middle of class, but didn't break tone so it sounded like I was just asking ridiculous questions."
woodworking,ff9tpql,t1_ff9e6cg,1579721059.0,"If they're old enough for it you could rig up a computer in there with Kerbal Space Program and make it a KSP simulator. That would be awesome. And you can always excuse it as educational because KSP teaches some super basic aeronautics and instills a desire to learn physics, and if you're significantly smarter than me you can even apply basic calculus in it! :D"

I came to the conclusion that I would rather make sandwiches with a single piece of a bread I really like rather than two pieces of one I just  tolerate, so I haven't tried again since."

When there was a day where I just couldn't handle it I would bury my face into the poofy fur on his neck and take deep breaths. Dog smell may not be the best smell as far as scents go, but when you're in a bad place it smells like love and comfort and hope. Its the scent of knowing that you're not alone, and is a great reminder that there is still something beautiful worth staying here for."

I told him i would take a look at it, I peaked in the back and saw that he had plugged his HDMI cable into the motherboards onboard graphics card, not the actual one."

gaming,ff4yd8b,t3_erkkd1,1579575414.0,"There was an old prank that I would do to people, I don't think it's possible now, but there was a URL that would take you to your facebook profile, not the page where you can edit it, but the actual profile that other people see. The same url goes to whoever is logged in at the time. So you go on one of those random chat websites and say ""Hold up, I'm hacking into your computer...Is this you?"" then paste the link, they click on it and of course see their own profile."
