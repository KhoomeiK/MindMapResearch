* Look distracted. Play with your phone, look at surroundings, stop walking to look at something, etc... Don't stare straight ahead.

* Walk slowly. The general advice if you think you're being followed is to change your pace several times to see if the person is matching it. Going slow and steady can help people feel at ease.

1) What type of oil did they fill the car with?

2) Engines are way more than $500. Hell, even the scrap value of the 2014 is more than that. Regardless of whether that number is ""cost of new engine"" or ""what they'll give you for the car,"" that number is way too low and not even close to real.

3) ""will no longer allow me to hit the gas"" do you mean this as in, you're getting absolutely no power when you press the pedal, or *the engine is dead and off*? Are you able to turn the car on and hear the engine turn over?

4) They say you shouldn't overfill oil because the heat from the engine running will increase the pressure (highschool physics...), which can cause the excess to spill over the engine bay and smoke while the car is running as the excess burns off. This isn't a case of ""overfill=car go boom,"" especially given that happened 40k miles ago. Unrelated issue as far as I'm concerned.

5) You shouldn't have gone to another mechanic telling them you want an engine replacement, you should have gone to them telling them you want them to diagnose your car's problem. *If* they had come back with the same diagnosis as the dealership, *then* you look into a new engine. *However*, because you came to them about an engine replacement, that's now what they're going to tell you because well - engine replacements are expensive. *Go to a third place and have them look at it*.

6) Nobody is out to ""steal"" your car. However, it definitely sounds like you need to be a lot more *aware* of car things in general.
