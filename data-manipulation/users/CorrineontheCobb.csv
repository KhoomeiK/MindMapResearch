politics,ffltq9q,t1_fflsm08,1580044051.0,I was on this boat..until the sexist smear. I don’t know what to expect from Warren now. I think it’s gonna come down to who offers her more. I think Biden would put anything on the table to get her on the ticket or at minimum an endorsement from her which would solidify his progressive credentials. Biden would have to promise her a one year term and the full support of the party behind her in ‘24 for it to be a deal she can’t refuse.
politics,fflpm1h,t3_etzrpe,1580042541.0,"This comment won’t be seen but here’s the real danger for Democrats now if Bernie really does win: He really *hasn’t* played the game. He’s *not* an establishment democrat. And for the last three 4 years the media, DNC, and most of the Democrats in Congress have been in lockstep support for “a return to normality.” That is precisely what Sanders is *against*. In fact, I think some traditional democratic advantages like ~~propaganda~~ sorry *news* or black turnout as a result of both racism and lack of support for GOTV (Jewish senator) won’t be quite as strong as even 2016.

The positives however, are that Sanders is obviously much more of a likable candidate than Hillary Clinton, he hasn’t come off as elitist, he’s been remarkably consistent in his position which I don’t know how his campaign hasn’t really hit more on.  He’s certainly braver than Hillary or almost every other dem running for his positions.

Bernie doesn’t seem like that great a campaigner though I don’t know if that’s him or if that’s his campaign manager. 

Or maybe... huh. I think I get it now. I was about to harp on Bernie for not being aggressive enough about being against the status quo and you know, *acting like a revolutionary*. But I think I understand what they’re doing.

Sanders thinks he can win by walking the tightrope and supporting his ideas while not attacking anyone up on stage with him so as to try and make these people real allies in the fall should he win. He thinks they are either going to continue tripping over themselves or just not have the support to go it for too long without a victory which is why he’s been emphatic about outright winning Iowa *and* New Hampshire. 

That’s actually pretty good. My concern with this strategy comes when Mayor Pete drops out and his voters support Biden by default. The same with Warren whose support I think will be more of a 60-40 split between Sanders and Biden. That’s the real danger of this strategy. Sanders needs these people to keep running at least until Super Tuesday in order to keep the votes split.

Mark my words, if Pete and Warren don’t drop out of the race until after Super Tuesday, Bernie Sanders is going to be the nominee.

If one (especially Pete) or both drop out before that happens, then I think the establishment will put pressure on coalescing around Biden and Sanders will eventually lose to him by a closer margin than in 2016.

It makes no sense because most judges I’ve met or read opinions of don’t subscribe to bullshit “technicalities” like you see in movies or tv. 

Performance in the typical hypo of a contract has begun upon delivery; however delivery means that the contractor has been given the item contracted for.

There are structural contractual reasons for this judges decision but IMO as a JD/bar applicant this ruling is pretty bullshit."
