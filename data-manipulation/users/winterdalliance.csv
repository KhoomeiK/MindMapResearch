crochet,fep2gpt,t3_eq32l7,1579310648.0,This is the snuggliest shark I've ever seen! So cute!
Baking,fep1tbc,t1_feozwhr,1579310236.0,"I failed the bar the first time I took it too! It majorly sucks, so I'm sorry. Cheering you on for February!"
Baking,fep1lzh,t3_eq4qw6,1579310108.0,"I failed the first bar exam I took, so I get it. It's devastating after all the time spent prepping. Take some time off (baking is a good way to do it, so you're good there!) and start studying again when you feel ready. Now that you've taken the test, you know more what you're up against so you can prepare even better. You've got this! 

Also, your baking is beautiful."
confession,fedbh0v,t1_fed5vxp,1579006631.0,"Jesus, if asking someone to be kind gets you called a snowflake, I'll take that label any day."
aww,fcvuxri,t1_fcv1au0,1578010673.0,We all go through that awkward phase. :)
aww,fcvunh9,t1_fcvg897,1578010489.0,"Okay, dad."
aww,fcvugm1,t1_fcuzwvd,1578010368.0,And it's amazing how something so simple is so interesting. My toddler got stacking cups in her Christmas stocking and likes them better than anything else.
Advice,fcsr9z4,t3_eiiv5z,1577923103.0,"Instead of a camera, why not split the chores? One day of the week, dad does them. Next day, mom. Day after that, sister, then you. Just rotate the responsibility so it doesn't keep turning into a pig sty with everyone to immature to do something about it. Everyone lives there, everyone contributes to the mess, so everyone can chip in."
tifu,fcsqey5,t1_fcsdcsn,1577922481.0,"A very good lesson. Listen to your body! I can't relate to the losing a ball because, well, I've never had any. But this summer I had appendicitis, and at first I thought no big deal, stomach pain, whatever I'll be fine. Fortunately I did eventually decide to go to the ER. By the time I had surgery, that sucker had ruptured."
aww,fcowyfy,t3_ei9hvc,1577843851.0,And now to learn how to climb down!
crochet,fcowarx,t1_fcok9r5,1577843330.0,I love that book too! That's the book that really taught me how to crochet.
Baking,fcoviaw,t3_eiacy1,1577842709.0,1. Are these for sharing? 2. Can I have one? They look so yummy.
Advice,fcg8yff,t3_eh6f14,1577637738.0,"1. Do you actually fear for your life, or are you using an expression? If you do actually fear for your life, don't tell him right away, move out of his house, get your own safe home, and tell him once that's all settled. 

2. You are 21 years old and legally an adult. You do not need your father's permission to date anyone. As other people have said, it's highly concerning that you think he'll get unreasonably overprotective about you dating a decent person. 

Eventually you'll probably have to tell him, unless you're planning to completely cut your dad out of your life. Just make sure you're safe when you do tell him, and advocate for yourself. He cannot control your whole life. 

If your dad is this controlling you may also want to look into getting a therapist to work through the damage his behavior could have caused. Therapy is a wonderful thing and nothing to be ashamed of."

Kentucky,fc3bq70,t3_efn4p4,1577386277.0,Love the Christmas lights at the bottom of the pic too!
