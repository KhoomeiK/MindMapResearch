GetMotivated,fcm7x98,t1_fcldsbr,1577766595.0,That logic can apply to any quote
GetMotivated,fcm7sao,t1_fcll9lr,1577766485.0,You've missed the point.
GetMotivated,fcm7p12,t1_fcm7bsf,1577766412.0,No worries!
GetMotivated,fcm7fsj,t1_fclugbo,1577766211.0,"Of course if you're an asshole then you should work to better yourself, but this quote is not about that. This is about when you've been beaten down at the end of your rope and you're unsure about where you're going to end up. Point being that you're at the low point, but life has ups as well as downs. Just hang in there and keep hanging on and things will get better."
GetMotivated,fcm76h7,t1_fclpdsa,1577766012.0,"Of all the things in that show, this is among the least narcissistic in context."
GetMotivated,fckzgtg,t1_fckwxvt,1577736512.0,"Your life is your life, it's not narcissistic at all."
GetMotivated,fcko8xp,t1_fcjzzvu,1577729618.0,"Here's a good quote I use from Bojack Horseman that's similar:

""You are the star of a movie. This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won’t feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don’t matter. Because this movie’s not about them. It’s never been about them.

All this time, the movie’s been about you.”

EDIT: Love all the people misinterpreting this as narcissism. Your movie = your life. No one else owns your life but you. Nothing selfish about that."
