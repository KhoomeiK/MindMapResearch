Games,ffff9ru,t1_fff5w33,1579882693.0,"Druid's been a problematic class across basically every property where it appears. They are theoretically good at everything, and as a counterbalance they end up not being good at any one thing... which is exactly what you want in a party-based RPG character. Worse for shapeshift fans, Druids in D&D tend to be better dedicated casters than dedicated fighters. Between the two ""paths,"" shapeshifting is clearly the gimmick.

Video games have it rough compared to tabletop, because there's an expectation that the player is going to get appropriate visuals, sounds, and other froo-froo for every choice they make; it's still surprising, then, how stubbornly bad even most tabletop games are at fixing the underlying issues that lead to Druids (and other classes) being bad. I think one excellent global solution would be to completely invert traditional character creation. Start with what you want your character to be able to *do* during the game's major activities (combat, stealth, investigating, diplomacy, etc.,) then make sure they're not stupidly overpowered compared to the group's other characters, and then chill the fuck out if somebody wants to be a werewolf instead of a traditional sword-and-armor fighter. You can make that happen with some tweaks that ultimately shouldn't make much difference. And, number one: don't be afraid to have rebalance discussions during campaigns. If a crazy werewolf murderbot is doing better or worse in its desired *role* than a fighter in that same *role,* just balance them out. There are so many knobs to turn!

His last comment is the most persuasive in terms of normal trials, but falls apart when you consider the differences inherent to impeachment.

That doesn't leave White's opinion in very good shape; and all of this, of course, is set against a *very* troubling backdrop that impeachment is the only way to remove Supreme Court justices. Imagine SCOTUS setting binding precedent that effectively rejects the Senate's ability to remove a SCOTUS justice, even after they got the majority of votes in the House *and* 2/3 votes in the Senate to get that done.

Maybe we'd have more movement on the issue if more people in this country knew what the laws actually *were*, instead of conflating comforting and positive rhetoric with reality.

The U.S. Constitution, to this day, contains no blanket, positive right to vote. It only contains a scattered collection of prohibitions on denying it. To wit: the government cannot deny the vote based on:

1) race, color, or previous condition of servitude (15th;)

2) sex (19th;)

3) age, except below 18 (26th.)

That's the black letter of the Constitution. That's what cannot be taken away by regular legislation.

At the state level, for state offices, one must also look to the state's constitution to know whether or not voting has been enshrined as a basic, baseline right for all citizens.
