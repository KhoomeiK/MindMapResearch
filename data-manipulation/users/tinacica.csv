Edit: I just do not get it why the defense would not have used George’s paternity at court. It makes no sense to me. It would have been a lot more damning than some witnesses who thought it was possible it happened."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffuyot3,t1_ffun0os,1580251876.0,"I never believed she was raped by George, there was never any evidence, she just blurted it out like any other lie she told police. I also think she took it back later, but I am not  entirely sure."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffq6x84,t3_euff4s,1580123749.0,"I did that too! Before I got to uni I was living in the suburbs of the city I went to school in. I had a lot of time to play these out in my head while on the metro or bus. Now that I do not have time to even sleep, I do it less often. I miss it though. I am a 110 pound female btw, and have never had a physical fight before.

Also I do not think that having a 9-5 job is that depressing though, you can have family, friends and hobbies too."

UnresolvedMysteries,fflzpz8,t1_ffkupfi,1580046310.0,"I also read an article about the irritation being caused by masturbation. Child masturbation is not uncommon and also is not  a sign of any sexual assault from the past, it is simply them discovering their bodies  without any sexual aspects, and JonBenet was right in the age it would happen to kids."

curlyhair,ff6f6d3,t3_erv7ur,1579625866.0,"Mine is the same. With the CGM method, it became pretty curly on top too, but the routine was just too much for me and just way too much products in my hair all the time, so I stopped doing it. Now I have a lowpoo routine with lots of conditioner and cowashing sometimes, when I just blowdry it (regular blowdryer, not diffuser) it has a pretty wavy texture but it is still curlier underneath.  Plopping helped a ton."

I find that my hair is shinier and has more elasticity when I use silicone, but I mostly stay away from it. Also using masks 3 times a week is definitely a lot, but it is different for everyone. Try to use it once a week and work your way up or down. Cheers!"

SuicideWatch,fet7xam,t3_eqg8kz,1579372564.0,"Honestly, that is being a teenager. Parents suck sometimes, and you growing up and having an opinion on your own can take a while for them to accept. I can really see where you are coming from, arguments with my parents made me feel so depressed when I was a teenager. Their disapproval and the whole fight makes you feel lonely and misunderstood. It WILL get better. They will get used to you being an adult and they will handle it better. You will learn to let things go.  Being a teenager sucks. Hell, family vacations as a teenager can suck even more. I thought we could never fix it and here I am with an almost perfect relationship with my parents as an adult. Once you move out you guys will start to appreciate each other more. I wish strength and patience for you. Cheers!"

It is okay you would prefer that. That still does not make it okay."
Documentaries,femuipn,t1_feln6p8,1579269962.0,I am talking about the consequences after the bombing. An atomic bomb is not just about the loss of people dying in the actual nuke. That is what I am saying.
Documentaries,felgtdx,t1_feldas0,1579221833.0,"And in the vietnamese war, US military personnels ran the same type of human experiments. We can bring up at least one great genocide the USA conducted. And please do not say you think the only thing waiting for japanese civils was “internment camps”, lol. Isn’t dropping the atomic bomb is an actual genocide? Whatever, I am tired to just think about your ignorance any longer."
Documentaries,felg4ta,t1_fekk3qq,1579221381.0,"Do you have any idea what the atomic bombs caused? How many children were born dead in the next decade? How many people perished in the years after the bombing because of the radiation? Yes, the rape of Nanking was horrific and unforgivable. But lets just not make the atomic bombs look like something smaller than it is. God, americans just have that desire to shift blame and make other nations look worse than they are."

AmItheAsshole,fdordgy,t1_fdogs9r,1578611180.0,"It wasnt pervy at all, just very, very embarassing. I returned a skirt to another shop like a year ago with the tag still on, after trying it on at home and realizing that the sequins on it cut my arms pretty badly, and the cashier guy sniffed it before taking it back also to see if I had worn it other then trying it on. It was fucking weird."
AmItheAsshole,fdnyxo1,t3_em7edc,1578595679.0,"NTA. I was around TWELVE when I was searched by a security staff member at a bigger clothes retailer. I was leaving the store and he just came up and said that I need to empty my pockets and bag. I did, he found obviously nothing and made me remove my jumper to see if it was stolen. It was from the store and he fucking sniffed it to see if it really was not new. My mum came up to us in the process and yelled his head off. I was just so shocked I did not know better then to comply. Momma bear even called the manager and filed a complaint thankfully. Would never show my bag or empty my pockets to a worker in a shop ever again."
DysmorphicDisorder,fdcauo0,t3_ee51y8,1578270579.0,"Even though I never wore a lot of makeup on a daily basis, I always did my makeup in the morning when I was younger. Since moving in together with my bf and spending sometimes weeks on end without makeup , with my glasses on ( I normally wear contact lenses) when we have exam weeks at uni, the urge to always put shit on my face when I leave home just disappeared. It feels so liberating. I actually can do my makeup when I feel like it, have fun with it, and just ditch it altogether when I am not in the mood or just do not have the time.  From years 13 to 20 I never left the house without makeup. Never. Now I live downtown , even if I just run to the store I see 50 times the people I saw when I lived with my parents and went to the store. 
It makes a world of a difference about how I feel when I leave the apartment."
DysmorphicDisorder,fdc9ths,t3_ef1m2m,1578269941.0,"Dump your boyfriend. Seriously. The things he says to you are so hurtful. A partner who loves you does not ever say things like this when they see you have problems with your body. Is it possible he even made your BDD worse with his comments? Please consider if your relationship is healthy or not. I have been in a relationship when I was younger that completely destroyed my self esteem and body image, it took me years to rebuild it. Good luck to you."

SuicideWatch,fd25phs,t1_fd1usy0,1578142097.0,"I agree with you in this, but still, I do not mean that we lose millions of people as in we become a smaller population is sad, but in the lost people’s fate individually. I have so many people in my family that were lost to war and even though I have not lived through one my grandparents and great grandparents were so heavily affected it causes me sadness to even think about their life.
I also think nationalism is just a rotten idea for the modern world.
Though OP wants a war because of even more selfish reasons, not even an idea that he thinks will lead to a better world for a nation, a continent or the whole planet. He/she thinks it would be the easiest way to go, while not thinking about how it will effect every other person on Earth. 
Depression does not give an f about reasoning for sure, but maybe this post will help him/her a little later understanding  how cloudy his/her thinking was when posting, thus helping in recovery. I just might be too much of an idealist though."
SuicideWatch,fd1tvf7,t3_ejs81a,1578136737.0,"Even though I definitely feel your pain, this is a very selfish thought. Not only you would be killed, but millions of people. Wars are the saddest thing to happen to humanity."
AmItheAsshole,fcqb8jo,t1_fcmzqxk,1577882576.0,"I wasnt talking out of stats but out of feelings. Same as the throwing-wife-under-the-bus-for-your-kid discussion.
Also if you love your partner the most, divorce is kind of out of the picture? I guess it usually happens because people were not as compatible as they believed in the beginning, or they just did not fight hard enough for the marriage. Most divorces I saw belong in the latter category. Sure there are cases that do not fit in these to, but most are. Also it is okay you said what you said, we can have differing opinions, I just stated mine. Saying it is wrong to love your spouse more than your kids is wrong though. Everybodys different, everybody loves differently."

If my mother got something and I asked why I did not, my father would say “Because she is my wife” and it always made sense. I do not think that loving your partner more than your child is bad. It is a different type of love. I also turned out pretty fine tbh. Kids are the completion of a relationship. Part of your love for your partner. If I was a man and my partner gave birth, and doctors told me either my partner or baby survive, I would choose my partner. Not because I do not love my baby. But the reason I want a baby  is my partner. That it is ours."

Another friend had a habit of flicking his lighter randomly. Drunkenly did it in the pocket of his coat, set himself on fire. 

Both of them are okay though.
