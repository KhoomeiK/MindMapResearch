Hun...That car probably meant a lot to him, the money made from it could have helped him a long way with retirement etc. My heart feels sad for the guy! Maybe you could give him some extra money? Find him and explain you got it wrong, give him another 200 or something? A lot of elderly people are left without family, money and sometimes have to sell the things they love the most in order to get by. When, which he most likely will, find out about the true value, he will feel so bad about it and that is going to suck."
