Grimdawn,ffwne9q,t1_ffwfp3f,1580306236.0,First I just choose one ability I like and max it out. Then start looking at what other abilities compliment it e.g. same damage types. It's best to focus on one or maybe two damage types.

China_Flu,fftc930,t1_fft84tt,1580216160.0,It's really not. We just need to reduce our resource usage. In the west we throw away an incredible amount of food and consumerism is rampant. The amount of pointless plastic crap we buy is insane. But rather than inconvenience ourselves we want to kill off populations in poorer countries. You're literally a monster.
Games,fftbwwf,t1_ffqtqvb,1580215840.0,You can reset everything except class choices. But you don't have to choose a second class until you want to. So you can just level pure one class and choose another later.

hmmmgifs,ffr1he5,t3_euojrf,1580148390.0,One thing I don't see mentioned a lot is how fucking boring it must be to be homeless. Like imagine just having 16+ hours to kill in a city with no money and in fact not being welcome inside most places. I've seen people say many start drugs after becoming homeless just to pass the fucking time. I know now what I'll be doing if it happens to me!

UpliftingNews,ffqnqj2,t1_ffqgx3d,1580139400.0,Data is currently the most valuable commodity around! It gives such power. Unfortunately the internet was always going to go this way in a society that values money more than people.
unitedkingdom,ffqjn17,t1_ffqdtnn,1580136420.0,I don't know social media opens up a new massive attack vector for propaganda. Targeted ads and the like seemed to have a huge affect on the election. Labour basically didn't play dirty enough.
unitedkingdom,ffqjg9u,t1_ffqicc1,1580136276.0,Based on how the public seem to react to things I imagine it would just create more social division.
TheOwlHouse,ffqhl81,t1_ffol974,1580134810.0,I feel the abominations could fall under demonology.

gamingsuggestions,ffq2qxx,t3_eudfh0,1580117186.0,Grim dawn is an amazing arpg and in my opinion the spiritual successor to diablo2. Built on the familiar diablo clone style but with so much build and loot variety. You get to select 2 of the 8 (I think) classes meaning there's huge variety before you even get to skills and items. You can easily burn 100s of hours in it. You can complete the game with pretty much any build or you can go super in depth into optimization to take on the end game super bosses etc.
gamingsuggestions,ffnw4fi,t1_ffm9ysc,1580071503.0,I've been playing arpg since the original diablo and grim dawn is my favourite by far. Such a gem of a game.

worldnews,ffmovtd,t1_ffmo4yl,1580057351.0,That's it's maximum. I thinks it's minimum is around 4. Which is actually in line with a lot of similar viruses.
China_Flu,ffmm2rv,t1_ffmd68z,1580056520.0,I mean anyone with a cold will likely be heading in. I imagine it would be pretty similar in most countries once they start quarantining cities.

China_Flu,fflfvlc,t3_etyaxs,1580039120.0,It's incredibly interesting to follow an outbreak in such detail and track it's progression. There's a lot of doomsday fear mongering and misinformation about but if you just take anything unverified with a pinch of salt it's all good though.

Grimdawn,ffjfprr,t1_ffjc624,1579997285.0,O also I just thought. Get your faction reps up as a good way to get gear.
China_Flu,ffj4pzh,t1_ffixhr4,1579990340.0,I mean it's just a fascist dictatorship really. You can dress it however you like but it is what it is.
oddlyterrifying,ffj47th,t1_ffitweu,1579989972.0,It's a perfect evolution for the first one. Maybe put a more normal looking goat as a middle one.
Grimdawn,ffj3xae,t3_etv65g,1579989757.0,I guess you could try a speed run build to get your first character through all difficulties then I believe you can buy an item to allow characters to start in ultimate. Or crucible actually.
Showerthoughts,ffixscs,t1_ffijhh3,1579985331.0,I agree 100% I remember realising that my parents really didn't know everything and were winging it most of the time.
China_Flu,ffixm09,t1_ffijksu,1579985205.0,I saw a comment from an ex pat living over there and they said people regularly go hospital when they have a cold to get an IV. I've seen a lot of similar comments as well. So I think there are certain cultural factors leading to more hysteria then we may get over here.
China_Flu,ffipaqm,t1_ffil3yo,1579979344.0,Yes but not every gene has the same affect. It isn't a one to one. Animals of lots of junk DNA as well as genes that encode common amino acids. So differences in virus mean more.
